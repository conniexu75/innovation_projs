https://openalex.org/W2040379229,"Control of integrin affinity for ligands (integrin activation) is essential for normal cell adhesion, migration, and assembly of an extracellular matrix. Integrin activation is usually mediated through the integrin beta subunit cytoplasmic tail and can be regulated by many different biochemical signaling pathways. We report that specific binding of the cytoskeletal protein talin to integrin beta subunit cytoplasmic tails leads to the conformational rearrangements of integrin extracellular domains that increase their affinity. Thus, regulated binding of talin to integrin beta tails is a final common element of cellular signaling cascades that control integrin activation."

We generated conditional mutant mice that lack expression of the cannabinoid receptor type 1 in principal forebrain neurons but not in adjacent inhibitory interneurons. In mutant mice,the excitotoxin kainic acid (KA) induced excessive seizures in vivo. The threshold to KA-induced neuronal excitation in vitro was severely reduced in hippocampal pyramidal neurons of mutants. KA administration rapidly raised hippocampal levels of anandamide and induced protective mechanisms in wild-type principal hippocampal neurons. These protective mechanisms could not be triggered in mutant mice. The endogenous cannabinoid system thus provides on-demand protection against acute excitotoxicity in central nervous system neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2135522980,"The most common inherited [correct] form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease affecting adult motor neurons, is caused by dominant mutations in the ubiquitously expressed Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1). In chimeric mice that are mixtures of normal and SOD1 mutant-expressing cells, toxicity to motor neurons is shown to require damage from mutant SOD1 acting within nonneuronal cells. Normal motor neurons in SOD1 mutant chimeras develop aspects of ALS pathology. Most important, nonneuronal cells that do not express mutant SOD1 delay degeneration and significantly extend survival of mutant-expressing motor neurons."

We show that the magnetic monopole can appear in the crystal momentum space of solids in the accessible low-energy region (approximately 0.1 to 1 electron volts) in the context of the anomalous Hall effect. We report experimental results together with first-principles calculations on the ferromagnetic crystal SrRuO3 that provide evidence for the magnetic monopole in the crystal momentum space."
https://openalex.org/W1995384886,"Nitric oxide (NO) serves as a signal in plants. An Arabidopsis mutant (Atnos1) was identified that had impaired NO production, organ growth, and abscisic acid-induced stomatal movements. Expression of AtNOS1 with a viral promoter in Atnos1 mutant plants resulted in overproduction of NO. Purified AtNOS1 protein used the substrates arginine and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and was activated by Ca2+ and calmodulin-like mammalian endothelial nitric oxide synthase and neuronal nitric oxide synthase, yet it is a distinct enzyme with no sequence similarities to any mammalian isoform. Thus, AtNOS1 encodes a distinct nitric oxide synthase that regulates growth and hormonal signaling in plants."
https://openalex.org/W2120875291,"The cytochrome b6f complex provides the electronic connection between the photosystem I and photosystem II reaction centers of oxygenic photosynthesis and generates a transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient for adenosine triphosphate synthesis. A 3.0 angstrom crystal structure of the dimeric b6f complex from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Mastigocladus laminosus reveals a large quinone exchange cavity, stabilized by lipid, in which plastoquinone, a quinone-analog inhibitor, and a novel heme are bound. The core of the b6f complex is similar to the analogous respiratory cytochrome bc1 complex, but the domain arrangement outside the core and the complement of prosthetic groups are strikingly different. The motion of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein extrinsic domain, essential for electron transfer, must also be different in the b6f complex."
https://openalex.org/W2043807089,"Vertebrate body axis extension involves progressive generation and subsequent differentiation of new cells derived from a caudal stem zone; however, molecular mechanisms that preserve caudal progenitors and coordinate differentiation are poorly understood. FGF maintains caudal progenitors and its attenuation is required for neuronal and mesodermal differentiation and to position segment boundaries. Furthermore, somitic mesoderm promotes neuronal differentiation in part by downregulating Fgf8. Here we identify retinoic acid (RA) as this somitic signal and show that retinoid and FGF pathways have opposing actions. FGF is a general repressor of differentiation, including ventral neural patterning, while RA attenuates Fgf8 in neuroepithelium and paraxial mesoderm, where it controls somite boundary position. RA is further required for neuronal differentiation and expression of key ventral neural patterning genes. Our data demonstrate that FGF and RA pathways are mutually inhibitory and suggest that their opposing actions provide a global mechanism that controls differentiation during axis extension."
https://openalex.org/W2076234930,"Consensus is emerging that the medial frontal lobe of the brain is involved in monitoring performance, but precisely what is monitored remains unclear. A saccade-countermanding task affords an experimental dissociation of neural signals of error, reinforcement, and conflict. Single-unit activity was monitored in the anterior cingulate cortex of monkeys performing this task. Neurons that signaled errors were found, half of which responded to the omission of earned reinforcement. A further diversity of neurons signaled earned or unexpected reinforcement. No neurons signaled the form of conflict engendered by interruption of saccade preparation produced in this task. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the anterior cingulate cortex monitors the consequences of actions."
https://openalex.org/W2050685506,"Agriculturally advantageous reduction in plant height is usually achieved by blocking the action or production of gibberellins. Here, we describe a different dwarfing mechanism found in maize brachytic2 (br2) mutants characterized by compact lower stalk internodes. The height reduction in these plants results from the loss of a P-glycoprotein that modulates polar auxin transport in the maize stalk. The sorghum ortholog of br2 is dwarf3 (dw3), an unstable mutant of long-standing commercial interest and concern. A direct duplication within the dw3 gene is responsible for its mutant nature and also for its instability, because it facilitates unequal crossing-over at the locus."
https://openalex.org/W2164753763,"We demonstrate enhanced generation of coherent light in the ""water window"" region of the soft x-ray spectrum at 4.4 nanometers, using quasi-phase-matched frequency conversion of ultrafast laser pulses. By periodically modulating the diameter of a gas-filled hollow waveguide, the phase mismatch normally present between the laser light and the generated soft x-ray light can be partially compensated. This makes it possible to use neon gas as the nonlinear medium to coherently convert light up to the water window, illustrating that techniques of nonlinear optics can be applied effectively in the soft x-ray region of the spectrum. These results advance the prospects for compact coherent soft x-ray sources for applications in biomicroscopy and in chemical spectroscopy."
https://openalex.org/W2050887424,"We report conductivity measurements of Cr-doped V 2 O 3 using a variable pressure technique. The critical behavior of the conductivity near the Mott insulator to metal critical endpoint is investigated in detail as a function of pressure and temperature. The critical exponents are determined, as well as the scaling function associated with the equation of state. The universal properties of a liquid-gas transition are found. This is potentially a generic description of the Mott critical endpoint in correlated electron materials."
https://openalex.org/W2136231875,"The specification of neuronal fates in the ventral spinal cord depends on the regulation of homeodomain (HD) and basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins by Sonic hedgehog (Shh). Most of these transcription factors function as repressors, leaving unresolved the link between inductive signaling pathways and transcriptional activators involved in ventral neuronal specification. We show here that retinoid signaling and the activator functions of retinoid receptors are required to pattern the expression of HD and bHLH proteins and to specify motor neuron identity. We also show that fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) repress progenitor HD protein expression, implying that evasion of FGF signaling and exposure to retinoid and Shh signals are obligate steps in the emergence of ventral neural pattern. Moreover, joint exposure of neural progenitors to retinoids and FGFs suffices to induce motor neuron differentiation in a Shh-independent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2118038184,"Some neurons (delay cells) in the prefrontal cortex elevate their activities throughout the time period during which the animal is required to remember past events and prepare future behavior, suggesting that working memory is mediated by continuous neural activity. It is unknown, however, how working memory is represented within a population of prefrontal cortical neurons. We recorded from neuronal ensembles in the prefrontal cortex as rats learned a new delayed alternation task. Ensemble activities changed in parallel with behavioral learning so that they increasingly allowed correct decoding of previous and future goal choices. In well-trained rats, considerable decoding was possible based on only a few neurons and after removing continuously active delay cells. These results show that neural activity in the prefrontal cortex changes dynamically during new task learning so that working memory is robustly represented and that working memory can be mediated by sequential activation of different neural populations."
https://openalex.org/W2048320127,"Huntington's and Kennedy's disease are autosomal dominant neurodegenerative diseases caused by pathogenic expansion of polyglutamine tracts. Expansion of glutamine repeats must in some way confer a gain of pathological function that disrupts an essential cellular process and leads to loss of affected neurons. Association of huntingtin with vesicular structures raised the possibility that axonal transport might be altered. Here we show that polypeptides containing expanded polyglutamine tracts, but not normal N-terminal huntingtin or androgen receptor, directly inhibit both fast axonal transport in isolated axoplasm and elongation of neuritic processes in intact cells. Effects were greater with truncated polypeptides and occurred without detectable morphological aggregates."
https://openalex.org/W2024056647,A C4-symmetric tetrameric aldolase was used to produce a quadratic network consisting of the enzyme as a rigid four-way connector and stiff streptavidin rods as spacers. Each aldolase subunit was furnished with a His6 tag for oriented binding to a planar surface and two tethered biotins for binding streptavidin in an oriented manner. The networks were improved by starting with composite units and also by binding to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-lipid monolayers. The mesh was adjustable in 5-nanometer increments. The production of a net with switchable mesh was initiated with the use of a calcium ion-containing beta-helix spacer that denatured on calcium ion depletion.
https://openalex.org/W2159578679,"The dissociation of methane on a nickel catalyst is a key step in steam reforming of natural gas for hydrogen production. Despite substantial effort in both experiment and theory, there is still no atomic-scale description of this important gas-surface reaction. We report quantum state-resolved studies, using pulsed laser and molecular beam techniques, of vibrationally excited methane reacting on the nickel (100) surface. For doubly deuterated methane (CD2H2), we observed that the reaction probability with two quanta of excitation in one C-H bond was greater (by as much as a factor of 5) than with one quantum in each of two C-H bonds. These results clearly exclude the possibility of statistical models correctly describing the mechanism of this process and attest to the importance of full-dimensional calculations of the reaction dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2039569400,"Cell adhesion by adherens junctions and desmosomes relies on interactions between cadherin molecules. However, the molecular interfaces that define molecular specificity and that mediate adhesion remain controversial. We used electron tomography of plastic sections from neonatal mouse skin to visualize the organization of desmosomes in situ. The resulting three-dimensional maps reveal individual cadherin molecules forming discrete groups and interacting through their tips. Fitting of an x-ray crystal structure for C-cadherin to these maps is consistent with a flexible intermolecular interface mediated by an exchange of amino-terminal tryptophans. This flexibility suggests a novel mechanism for generating both cis and trans interactions and for propagating these adhesive interactions along the junction."
https://openalex.org/W1980470187,"The latent plasma carboxypeptidase thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) is activated by thrombin/thrombomodulin on the endothelial cell surface, and functions in dampening fibrinolysis. In this study, we examined the effect of activated TAFI (TAFIa) in modulating the proinflammatory functions of bradykinin, complement C5a, and thrombin-cleaved osteopontin. Hydrolysis of bradykinin and C5a and thrombin-cleaved osteopontin peptides by TAFIa was as efficient as that of plasmin-cleaved fibrin peptides, indicating that these are also good substrates for TAFIa. Plasma carboxypeptidase N, generally regarded as the physiological regulator of kinins, was much less efficient than TAFIa. TAFIa abrogated C5a-induced neutrophil activation in vitro. Jurkat cell adhesion to osteopontin was markedly enhanced by thrombin cleavage of osteopontin. This was abolished by TAFIa treatment due to the removal of the C-terminal Arg168 by TAFIa from the exposed SVVYGLR α4β1 integrin-binding site in thrombin-cleaved osteopontin. Thus, thrombin cleavage of osteopontin followed by TAFIa treatment may sequentially up- and down-modulate the pro-inflammatory properties of osteopontin. An engineered anticoagulant thrombin, E229K, was able to activate endogenous plasma TAFI in mice, and E229K thrombin infusion effectively blocked bradykinin-induced hypotension in wild-type, but not in TAFI-deficient, mice in vivo.

Thrombin has long been regarded as a multifunctional procoagulant enzyme important in hemostasis. At sites of vascular injury it converts fibrinogen to fibrin, amplifies the clotting cascade by activating factor XI (FXI) and the cofactors FV and FVIII, stabilizes the fibrin clot by activating FXIII, and activating platelets via the protease-activated receptors (PAR). It can also function as an anticoagulant by binding to thrombomodulin (TM) 1The abbreviations used are: TMthrombomodulinTAFIthrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitorCPBcarboxypeptidase BCPNcarboxypeptidase NOPNosteopontinaPCactivated protein CBKbradykininPPACKd-phenylalanyl-propyl-arginylchlormethylketonePBSphosphate-buffered salineHBSSHanks balanced salt solutionDTTdithiothreitolGSTglutathione S-transferase. on the surface of endothelial cells and activating protein C, which inhibits FVa and FVIIIa, effectively localizing clot formation to the site of vascular injury (1Esmon C.T.

TAFI is now recognized as the second physiological substrate for the thrombin/TM complex. It is important for dampening fibrinolysis by removal of plasmin-exposed lysines on partially digested fibrin clots thereby restricting tissue plasminogen activator binding and further activation of plasminogen (2Bajzar L.

Thus, activated protein C (aPC) and TAFIa may play complementary roles in hemostasis, with aPC dampening the clotting cascade and preventing excessive thrombin generation, while TAFIa serves to protect the clot already formed at the site of injury. thrombomodulin thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor carboxypeptidase B carboxypeptidase N osteopontin activated protein C bradykinin d-phenylalanyl-propyl-arginylchlormethylketone phosphate-buffered saline Hanks balanced salt solution dithiothreitol glutathione S-transferase. Thrombin can also act as a proinflammatory molecule by the activation of PAR on monocytes, smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells, thus providing a direct link between coagulation and inflammation (8Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2140) Google Scholar). On the other hand, thrombin/TM activation of PC could also function as a negative regulator of inflammation along with its defined role as an anticoagulant (1). aPC suppressed the expression of proinflammatory cell adhesion molecules and augmented the expression of anti-apoptotic molecules in cultured endothelial cells (9Joyce D.E.

Mueller B.M. Ruf W. Science. 2002; 296: 1880-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). This anti-inflammatory role of aPC may contribute to its clinical efficacy in the treatment of severe sepsis (11Bernard G.R. Vincent J.L. Laterre P.F. LaRosa S.P. Dhainaut J.F. Lopez-Rodriguez A. Steingrub J.S. Garber G.E. Helterbrand J.D. Ely E.W. Fisher Jr., C.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (5070) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that TAFIa could also play a role in regulating inflammation by inactivation of kinins and anaphylatoxins through its arginine/lysine specific carboxypeptidase activity (12Shinohara T. Sakurada C. Suzuki T. Takeuchi O. Campbell W.D. Ikeda S. Okada N. Okada H. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1994; 103: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13Campbell W.D Lazoura E. Okada N. Okada H. Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 46: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). However, the efficiency of TAFIa in inactivating these biologically active mediators in comparison with carboxypeptidase N, the constitutively active plasma anaphylatoxin inhibitor, has not been defined. Recently, a new mechanism by which thrombin can regulate inflammation and tissue repair is revealed by its interaction with osteopontin (OPN, 14Senger D.R. Perruzzi C.A. Papadopoulos A. Tenen D.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 996: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 15Senger D.R. Perruzzi C.A. Papadopoulos-Sergiou A. Van de Water L. Mol. Biol.

OPN is a multifunctional RGD-containing phosphoprotein with adhesive and cell-signaling functions involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions important in inflammatory responses (17Denhardt D.T. Noda M. O'Regan A.W. Pavlin D. Berman J.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). It is present as an extracellular matrix component in mineralized tissues and in the subendothelial matrix of blood vessels involved by atherosclerosis. OPN also circulates as a soluble proinflammatory cytokine and is widely expressed by many inflammatory cells in culture, including T cells, macrophages, and NK cells. Its expression is enhanced in response to inflammation, tissue injury and stress. It interacts with many cells via RGD-dependent (αvβ1, αvβ3, or αvβ5) and RGD-independent integrins (α4β1, α5β1, α8β1, or α9β1) and also CD44. It is chemotactic for various cell types, notably monocytes and macrophages and stimulates cell motility and cell survival (17Denhardt D.T. Noda M. O'Regan A.W. Pavlin D. Berman J.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). Of interest, thrombin cleavage of OPN increases the adhesion, spreading, and migration of a variety of cells significantly in vitro, and this can occur in vivo suggesting an important functional role of OPN cleavage at sites of thrombin generation (15Senger D.R. Perruzzi C.A. Papadopoulos-Sergiou A. Van de Water L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 18Senger D.R. Peruzzi C.A. Gracey C.F. Papadopoulos A. Tenen D.G.

In certain cell types, such as melanoma cells, cell binding only occurs with the thrombin-cleaved, but not the intact OPN, suggesting that thrombin cleavage is critical for certain OPN-cell interactions (15Senger D.R.

Here we address the potential role of TM-dependent thrombin activation of TAFI, and the subsequent TAFIa inactivation of bradykinin, C3a, C5a, and thrombin-cleaved OPN. Our data suggest that along with aPC, TAFIa serves to counterbalance the prothrombotic and proinflammatory effects of thrombin generation and thus its biological role is not limited to fibrin clot stabilization. Materials—Synthetic peptides were synthesized and purified by the peptide synthesis core facility at the Stanford University Beckman Center (Stanford, CA). The peptides were based on residues 160-168 of the C terminus of thrombin-cleaved osteopontin (OPN160-168), residues 69-77 of activated complement C3a (C3a69-77), residues 66-74 of C5a (C5a66-74) and peptides at the fibrin plasmin cleavage sites on α-chain α-Arg104 (FBα-Arg96-104), β-chain β-Lys133 (FBβ-Lys125-133), and γ-chain γ-Lys62 (FBγ-Lys54-62) and γ-Lys85 (FBγ-Lys77-85). The same peptides were synthesized in their des-Arg or des-Lys forms for calibration curves. The anti-integrin antibodies HP2/1 (α4, CD49d), AMF7 (αV, CD51), SAM1 (α5, CD49e), 7E4 (β2, CD18), 25.3.1 (αL, CD11a), BEAR 1 (αM, CD11b), and 4B4 (β1, CD29) were from Beckman Coulter (Brea, CA). The sheep anti-human TAFI antibody SATAFI-AP was from Affinity Biologicals (Ontario, Canada) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-sheep antibody was from Pierce. Recombinant soluble human TM and human carboxypeptidase N (CPN) are from Berlex Biosciences (Richmond, CA). Human TAFI was purchased from Hematological Technologies (Essex Junction, VT). Bradykinin (BK), benzamidine, d-phenylalanyl-propyl-arginylchlormethylketone (PPACK), C5a, cytochalasin B, o-dianisidine, potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor, glutathione, and Thrombomax-HS reagent were purchased from Sigma Chemicals. The protease inhibitor mixture set III and Bugbuster™ reagent were purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI). Recombinant human wild-type and E229K thrombins were expressed and purified as described previously (25Tsiang M. Paborsky L.R. Li W.X. Jain A.K. Mao C.T. Dunn K.E. Lee D.W. Matsumura S.Y. Matteucci M.D. Coutre S.E. Leung L.L. Gibbs C.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16449-16457Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). TAFIa-mediated Hydrolysis of C-terminal Peptides—Soluble recombinant TM (40 nm) was complexed with 1 nm thrombin. TAFI (100 nm) was added and incubated at 25 °C for 20 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of PPACK (5 μm). The concentration of TAFIa was determined using an Actichrome TAFI activity kit (American Diagnostica). The peptides based on BK, OPN160-168, C3a69-77, C5a66-74, FBα-Arg96-104, FBβ-Lys125-133, FBγ-Lys54-62, and FBγ-Lys77-85 with concentrations ranging from 15 μm to 2 mm were digested with either 5 nm TAFIa or CPN for 2-5 min at 37 °C in assay buffer. Reactions were stopped by boiling for 5 min. Cleaved peptides were resolved by HPLC and the area of the cleaved peptide peak was calculated using the Waters HPLC software then converted to nmoles of peptide using a calibration curve determined with the purified des-Arg or des-Lys form of each peptide. The values for Km and kcat were determined by plotting the initial velocities of cleavage against the different substrate concentrations, then fitting to the Michaelis-Menten equation by non-linear regression analysis. Experiments were performed in duplicate and the data pooled for analysis. Escherichia coli Expression of Recombinant Osteopontin—The cDNA sequences for mature full-length human OPN (OPN-FL: amino acids 17-314), N-terminal OPN mimicking thrombin-cleaved OPN (OPN-Arg168: amino acids 17-168) and the N-terminal OPN mimicking thrombin-cleaved and TAFIa-treated OPN (OPN-LeuΔArg: amino acids 17-167) were inserted as C-terminal in-frame fusions to GST using the E. coli expression vector pGEX-6P-3 (Amersham Biosciences). The constructs pOPN-FL, pOPN-Arg168, and pOPN-LeuΔArg also incorporated the 159RGD161 to 159RAA161 substitutions by site-directed mutagenesis using the Quick-change site directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to form the constructs pRAA/OPN-FL, pRAA/OPN-Arg168, and pRAA/OPN-LeuΔArg. Constructs were sequenced and then transformed into E. coli BL21 Gold (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). For large scale expression of the constructs, transformed cells were grown in 1 liter of LB broth supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C until an OD600 of 0.6-0.7. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.2 mm) was added and grown for a further 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were pelleted and washed twice with PBS, pH 7.2. Cells were lysed with Bugbuster™ reagent supplemented with the protease inhibitor III mixture set and 2 mm DTT. The cell lysate was clarified, diluted 5-fold in low salt buffer (50 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, pH 7.5, and the protease inhibitors) and loaded onto a hiPrep QXL column utilizing an FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C. The column was washed extensively with wash buffer (50 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, pH 7.5, the protease inhibitors), then eluted with high salt buffer (50 mm Tris, 600 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, pH 7.5) containing 1 mm benzamidine. Fractions containing GST-OPN fusion proteins were pooled and loaded onto a 10-ml glutathione-Sepharose column equilibrated with low salt buffer with 2 mm DTT and 1 mm benzamidine. The column was washed with low salt buffer and OPN was eluted with low salt buffer containing 10 mm glutathione. Fractions containing GST-OPN fusion proteins were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. The recombinant proteins were greater than 95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Adhesion Assays—Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells with greater than 95% viability as demonstrated by Trypan Blue exclusion assay were washed with Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) with 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5 and adjusted to a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml in buffer containing 0.2 mm MnCl2 (21Green P.M. Ludbrook S.B. Miller D.D. Horgan C.M.T. Barry S.T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 503: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Recombinant wild-type and mutant OPN fusion proteins were diluted in PBS (concentrations ranging from 0, 0.1, 1, 10, 100 μg/ml) and coated onto high protein binding 96-well microtiter plates (Greiner Labortechnik, Ocala, FL) with a final volume of 100 μl per well, then incubated overnight at 4 °C. For experiments studying the effect of thrombin and TAFIa on OPN-FL mediated Jurkat cell adhesion, the plates were washed three times with thrombin assay buffer (25 mm Hepes, 150 mm, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1% PEG6000, pH 7.5). To some of the wells, 100 μl of thrombin (100 nm final concentration) was added, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Wells were washed three times with thrombin assay buffer. To some of the wells that had been treated with thrombin, 100 μl of TAFIa (1.7 nm final concentration) was added and incubated for 60 min at room temperature (RT). The plates were washed three times with PBS, then blocked for 1 h with 3% BSA in PBS. The wells were then washed three times with HBSS-Hepes buffer with 0.2 mm MnCl2. To each well, 100 μl of 2 × 106 cells/ml were added in the same HBSS-Hepes buffer with 0.2 mm MnCl2, and cells were allowed to adhere for 60 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with PBS, once with absolute ethanol and fixed for 20 min with absolute ethanol. Wells were then washed three times with PBS, stained with 0.1% crystal violet, and again washed three times with PBS. Cells were then lysed with 0.5% Triton X-100. Lysates were read at A570 nm using a SpectroMAX plate reader (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). For studies using recombinant GST-OPN fusion proteins (OPN-Arg168 and OPN-LeuΔArg with or without the RGD → RAA substitution), protein adsorption to the microtiter wells was carried out and Jurkat cell binding determined as described above. For antibody inhibition of Jurkat cell binding to OPN-Arg168 and OPN-LeuΔArg, cells were preincubated with 10 μg/ml of the following anti-integrin antibodies: HP2/1, AMF7, SAM1, 7E4, 25.3.1, 4B4, and BEAR1 for 10 min on ice. Cells were then allowed to attach for 60 min and the amount of cell binding determined. Neutrophil Myeloperoxidase Release Assay—Neutrophils were prepared from buffy coat concentrates obtained from Stanford Blood Bank following a published protocol (26Henson P.M. Zanolari B. Schwartzman N.A. Hong S.R. J. Immunol. 1978; 121: 851-855PubMed Google Scholar). Neutrophils (4 × 106 cells/ml) were resuspended in Hanks solution with 0.25% bovine serum albumin. To test the effect of TAFIa on C5a-mediated myeloperoxidase release, 60 nm recombinant soluble TM was complexed with 3 nm thrombin for 10 min. TM-complexed thrombin was used to activate TAFI (200 nm). Human C5a (10 μm) was hydrolyzed by 0, 1, 10, 100 nm TAFIa at RT. 10-μl aliquots were removed at 1, 5, 10, 30, and 60 min and the TAFIa inhibited with potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor. The samples were then diluted 10-fold such that the concentration of C5a/C5adesArg was 1.0 μm. 1 ml of neutrophils (4 × 106 cell/ml) was treated with 5 μg/ml cytochalasin B for 5 min at 37 °C. 1 μl of each diluted C5a/TAFIa reaction was added to the cell suspension and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C, then centrifuged. Myeloperoxidase released to the supernatant was measured by adding 20 μl of supernatant to 130 μl of 33 mm phosphate buffer pH 6.2, 0.002% H2O2, 6.7% o-dianisidine-HCl. Reaction velocities were followed at A460 for 30 min. Measurement of Mouse aPTT—Mice were anesthetized with ketamine followed by isoflurane. A midline incision was made and the internal jugular vein cannulated. Saline, wild-type, or E229K thrombin solutions were infused through the cannulated jugular vein at rates ranging from 0 to 50 μg thrombin/kg/min. Heart and respiratory rates were monitored and blood samples drawn after a 10-min infusion time. Blood was taken through a syringe inserted into the left ventricle and collected in 0.32% citrate. Blood samples were spun down for 1 min, 100 μl of plasma was warmed to 37 °C then mixed with 200 μl of prewarmed Thrombomax-HS reagent, and the aPTT determined using a BBL fibrometer. Fibrinogen levels were taken from similarly processed plasma while platelets counts were performed on whole blood collected into citrate anticoagulant tubes by the Stanford Animal Laboratory Facility (Stanford, CA). At each E229K thrombin dose, at least three mice were used. Results are presented as the mean a PTT ± S.E. (n = 5 for each data point in E229K, n = 3 for each data point in wild type thrombin). The study was approved by the Stanford Panel on Laboratory Animal Care and was conducted in compliance with university regulations. The Effect of E229K on Bradykinin-induced Hypotension in Vivo—Male C57BL/6 mice (8-12 weeks old, 25-32 g) or TAFI-deficient mice and their wild-type littermates (in a mixed background of C57BL/6 and 129/Sv) were anesthetized with isoflurane 2%. A midline incision was made in the upper thorax to expose the carotid artery and jugular vein. The carotid artery was cannulated with a pressure transduction catheter connected to a computerized pressure monitor (Powerlab, Colorado Springs, CO) to record blood pressure. The transduction system was calibrated using a sphygmomanometer. Another catheter (PE-10) was inserted into the left jugular vein serving as a route of delivery for experimental treatments. After the level of isoflurane was reduced to 1%, the blood pressure and respiratory rate of the mouse was allowed to stabilize for several minutes. Then 100 μl of either E229K thrombin (40 μg/kg) or a saline control was administered to the jugular vein. Immediately afterward, 50 μl of saline was injected to flush out the catheter, then 100 μl of BK in saline (10 nmol/kg) or the equivalent molar dosage of des-ArgBK was given to the mouse through the same jugular vein catheter. Blood pressure tracings were monitored and recorded. Data are presented as maximum drops in mean arterial pressure after administration of BK or des-Arg BK. Bradykinin, C5a and Thrombin-cleaved Osteopontin Were Good Substrates for TAFIa—The established view on TAFIa function is that it modulates clot fibrinolysis by removing exposed C-terminal lysines from partially plasmin-degraded clots. Removal of the lysines reduces t-PA and plasminogen binding thereby reducing t-PA enhanced activation of plasmin (2Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol.

Recent studies also imply the possible role of TAFIa inactivation of kinins and anaphylatoxins (4Campbell W. Okada H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 933-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 12Shinohara T. Sakurada C. Suzuki T. Takeuchi O. Campbell W.D. Ikeda S. Okada N. Okada H. Int. Arch.

To show that kinins such as BK, anaphylatoxins such as complement C3a and C5a, and the thrombin-cleaved cytokine, OPN, are potential substrates of TAFIa, we determined their Michaelis-Menten constants for hydrolysis by TAFIa. These were compared with the hydrolysis of peptides based on four major plasmin cleavage sites on fibrin clots (27Collen D. Kudryk B.J. Hessel B. Blömback B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5808-5817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the fibrin α-chain Arg104-Asp105, the β-chain Lys133-Asp134, and the γ-chain Lys62-Ala63 and Lys85-Ser86 sites (Table I). TAFIa is thermolabile (5Hendriks D. Scharpé S. van S e M. Lommaert M. P. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1989; 27: 277-285PubMed Google Scholar); however, using reaction conditions in the presence of excess substrate with short incubation times at 37 °C, no significant TAFIa thermal instability and inactivation was observed (data not shown). The Km and kcat values for hydrolysis of the fibrin peptides ranged from 14.3 μm and 13.6 s-1 for FBβLys125-133 to 361.4 μm and 1.5 s-1 for FBαArg96-104. Differences were both in Km and kcat for the fibrin peptides with FBβLys125-133 and FBγLys54-65 being the best substrates for TAFIa while FBαArg96-104 and FBγLys77-85 were the worst. By comparison, the overall specificity constants for BK (2.8 × 105m-1·s -1), OPN159-168 (4.1 × 105m-1·s-1), C5a66-74 (1.3 × 105m-1·s-1) and C3a69-77 (2.3 × 105m-1·s-1) were similar to the two best fibrin substrates FBβLys125-133 (9.5 × 105m-1·s-1) and FBγLys54-62 (7.6 × 104m-1·s-1). The in vitro data suggests that BK, C5a, C3a, thrombin-cleaved OPN and the surface exposed basic residues on partially degraded clots are all good substrates for TAFIa in vivo. It is notable that CPN, commonly regarded as the physiological inactivator of kinins and anaphylatoxins, was less efficient for hydrolysis of BK (3.0 × 104m-1·s-1), OPN159-168 (1.6 × 104m-1·s-1) and C5a66-74 (1.5 × 104m-1·s-1) with kcat/Km values ∼9- and 26-fold lower. The peptides C3a69-77, FBαArg96-104, and FBβLys125-133 appeared to be slightly better substrates for CPN (kcat/Km = 7.5 × 105m-1·s-1, 4.2 × 103m-1·s-1 and 2.1 × 106m-1·s-1, respectively).Table IInactivation of BK and OPN Peptides by TAFIa and CPNSubstrateEnzymeKmkcatkcat/Kmμms−1M−1 S−1BKTAFIa70.6 ± 4.819.7 ± 4.82.8 × 105OPN159-168TAFIa57.7 ± 5.323.6 ± 0.64.1 × 105C5a66-74TAFIa219.0 ± 16.229.5 ± 0.71.3 × 105C3a69-77TAFIa35.9 ± 6.68.4 ± 0.62.3 × 105FBα-Arg96-104TAFIa361.4 ± 20.31.5 ± 0.14.2 × 103FBβ-Lys125-133TAFIa14.3 ± 0.713.6 ± 0.29.5 × 105FBγ-Lys54-62TAFIa34.0 ± 4.12.6 ± 0.17.6 × 104FBγ-Lys77-85TAFIa238.9 ± 24.25.9 ± 0.32.5 × 104BKCPN302.7 ± 29.19.1 ± 0.23.0 × 104OPN159-168CPN141.6 ± 11.62.3 ± 0.11.6 × 104C5a66-74CPN602.2 ± 74.39.3 ± 0.41.5 × 104C3a69-77CPN77.1 ± 11.257.9 ± 2.17.5 × 105FBα-Arg96-104CPN448.9 ± 43.82.9 ± 0.16.5 × 103FBβ-Lys125-133CPN53.2 ± 4.9109.1 ± 3.62.1 × 106FBγ-Lys54-62CPN657.6 ± 20.53.5 ± 0.15.3 × 104FBγ-Lys77-85CPN3727.0 ± 408.611.8 ± 0.83.2 × 104 Open table in a new tab TAFIa Reduced Jurkat Cell Adhesion to Thrombin-cleaved Osteopontin—Recombinant full-length OPN (OPN-FL) was adsorbed to 96-well microtiter plates at various concentrations and then treated with either thrombin or thrombin followed by TAFIa and compared with untreated OPN-FL for Jurkat cell binding (Fig. 1A). Thrombin-treated OPN-FL at a concentration of 1.0 μg/ml supported a 4.7-fold increase in Jurkat cell adhesion (A570 = 0.47 ± 0.12, n = 6) compared with untreated OPN-FL (A570 = 0.10 ± 0.03, n = 13) (Fig. 1, A and B). These results are consistent with previous studies showing that the increased cell adhesion is due to exposure of a cryptic integrin-binding motif SVVYGLR at the C terminus of the thrombin-cleaved OPN fragment (15Senger D.R.

https://openalex.org/W1965384166,"Sensations from viscera, like fullness, easily become painful if the stimulus persists. Mice lacking alpha1G T-type Ca2+ channels show hyperalgesia to visceral pain. Thalamic infusion of a T-type blocker induced similar hyperalgesia in wild-type mice. In response to visceral pain, the ventroposterolateral thalamic neurons evokeda surge of single spikes, which then slowly decayed as T type-dependent burst spikes gradually increased. In alpha1G-deficient neurons, the single-spike response persisted without burst spikes. These results indicate that T-type Ca2+ channels underlie an antinociceptive mechanism operating in the thalamus andsupport the idea that burst firing plays a critical role in sensory gating in the thalamus."
https://openalex.org/W2065263158,"The mechanisms of Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores in CNS white matter remain undefined. In rat dorsal columns, electrophysiological recordings showed that in vitro ischemia caused severe injury, which persisted after removal of extracellular Ca(2+); Ca(2+) imaging confirmed that an axoplasmic Ca(2+) rise persisted in Ca(2+)-free perfusate. However, depletion of Ca(2+) stores or reduction of ischemic depolarization (low Na(+), TTX) were protective, but only in Ca(2+)-free bath. Ryanodine or blockers of L-type Ca(2+) channel voltage sensors (nimodipine, diltiazem, but not Cd(2+)) were also protective in zero Ca(2+), but their effects were not additive with ryanodine. Immunoprecipitation revealed an association between L-type Ca(2+) channels and RyRs, and immunohistochemistry confirmed colocalization of Ca(2+) channels and RyR clusters on axons. Similar to ""excitation-contraction coupling"" in skeletal muscle, these results indicate a functional coupling whereby depolarization sensed by L-type Ca(2+) channels activates RyRs, thus releasing damaging amounts of Ca(2+) under pathological conditions in white matter."

Because oxoG mispairs with adenine during replication, this oxidative lesion is a source of G·C to T·A transversion mutations. Nearly all organisms possess enzymes that safeguard against the geno-toxic effects of oxoG. The oxoG resistance pathway in bacteria, known as the “GO” system, comprises three components: MutT, MutY, and MutM (1Michaels M.L. Miller J.H. J.

MutT hydrolyzes oxo-dGTP to oxo-dGMP and inorganic pyrophosphate so as to prevent de novo incorporation of oxoG into the genome during DNA replication. MutY initiates the repair of misreplicated oxoG·A pairs in DNA by catalyzing hydrolytic excision of the adenine base. MutM (also known as Fpg) is a bifunctional DNA glycosylase/lyase that catalyzes complete excision of oxoG lesion nucleosides when paired opposite C in DNA via a complex multistep reaction cascade. Most eukaryotes possess a GO system related to that in bacteria, with orthologous versions of MutT and MutY; however, in higher organisms, MutM is replaced by the functionally analogous but structurally unrelated enzyme Ogg1 (5Nash H.M.

Recent structural studies of MutM-DNA complexes have revealed the overall architecture of the protein-DNA complex. These structures have also provided insights into the general features of lesion presentation to the MutM active site, suggesting that the oxoG nucleoside is swiveled out of the DNA helix during repair, a theme common throughout the structural biology of base excision DNA repair. A segment of the protein near the active site is disordered in the DNA-bound MutM structures lacking an oxoG nucleobase, yet is ordered in the absence of DNA, thus leading to the tantalizing suggestion that induced fit might contribute to lesion base recognition. Understanding the structural determinants of lesion recognition by MutM has been hampered by the fact that none of the available high resolution structures contain a damaged base (11Serre L.

In general, obtaining crystals of complexes comprising a DNA glycosylase bound to lesion-containing DNA is always complicated by the fact that the wild-type enzyme processes its substrate much faster than the time scale of crystallization and data collection. In several cases, this problem has been solved through introduction of amino acid changes that abrogate catalysis while preserving lesion recognition, thus enabling the preparation of homogeneous stalled glycosylase/DNA complexes (14Slupphaug G.

Studies with Escherichia coli MutM have demonstrated that conversion of a conserved active site glutamate at position 3 to glutamine provides a mutant protein lacking base excision (glycosylase) activity but retaining the ability to catalyze DNA strand scission (lyase activity) (17Lavrukhin O.V. Lloyd R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15266-15271Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We reasoned that an E3Q mutant version of MutM might allow the enzyme to bind stably to oxoG-containing DNA, thus enabling us to obtain a stalled oxoG recognition complex. Here we report the crystallization of this complex and the determination of its structure to 2.34-Å resolution. Furthermore, we have determined the 1.63-Å structure of a complex with DNA containing an alternative substrate, dihydrouracil (DHU). These structures reveal the mode of lesion recognition and hint at a substrate discrimination mechanism that couples substrate recognition with catalysis. DNA Synthesis—The DNA oligonucleotides 5′-AGGTAGACCTGGACGC-3′ and 5′-TGCGTCCAXGTCTACC-3′ (X = oxoG or DHU) were synthesized on an ABI 392 DNA synthesizer utilizing standard phosphoramidite chemistry, using the four normal phosphoramidites plus the 8-oxo-2′-deoxyguaninosine or 5,6-dihydro-2′-deoxyuridine phosphoramidites (Glen Research). Deprotection of the oxoG-containing oligonucleotide was carried out in concentrated NH4OH supplemented with 250 mm 2-mercaptoethanol for 18 h at 55 °C. Deprotection of the DHU-containing oligonucleotide was carried out in concentrated NH4OH at room temperature for 2 h. After lyophilization, all oligonucleotides were purified by urea-PAGE. Mutagenesis and Protein Purification—An expression construct of the E3Q mutant version of Bacillus stearothermophilus MutM was created by subcloning (via introduction of a GAA to CAA mutation with the oligonucleotide 5′-ggctaacatatcccgCAAttgccggaggtggaaacg-3′ used as an N-terminal primer) starting with the previously described expression construct for the wild-type protein (13Fromme J.C. Verdine G.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 544-552PubMed Google Scholar). The B. stearothermophilus E3Q MutM protein was overexpressed and purified as described (13Fromme J.C. Verdine G.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 544-552PubMed Google Scholar), except that an additional purification step employing a MonoS cation exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) was included (gradient from 100 to 500 mm NaCl). Activity assays were performed essentially as described for hOgg1 (18Norman D.P. Chung S.J. Verdine G.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1564-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) to confirm that B. stearothermophilus MutM cleaves DHU-containing DNA and that B. stearothermophilus E3Q MutM does not cleave oxoG- or DHU-containing DNA. A native electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a 7% native-PAGE gel run in 1× Tris-borate-EDTA and stained with SYBR-GOLD (Molecular Probes) was performed using 1 μm DNA and 1 μm protein to verify that B. stearothermophilus MutM E3Q forms stable complexes with both oxoG- and DHU-containing DNA. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Determination— Crystallization and cryo-protection for data collection were carried out as described (13Fromme J.C. Verdine G.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 544-552PubMed Google Scholar). Data were collected at 100 K on a Rigaku R-axis IV2+ detector using a copper rotating anode x-ray source (oxoG-containing DNA complex) or on an ADSC Q315 detector at the X25 beamline of the National Synchrotron Light Source (DHU-containing DNA complex). All data were processed with HKL2000 (19Otwinowski Z. M.W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). The structure of the oxoG-containing DNA complex was determined first, as follows: a modified model of the structure of B. stearothermophilus MutM bound to DNA containing a reduced abasic site (Protein Data Bank accession code 1L1T) in which the lesion nucleoside and all waters were completely omitted was used as a starting point for rigid body refinement followed by simulated annealing torsion angle dynamics refinement in CNS (20Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). Electron density maps calculated at this stage revealed clear density for the oxoG nucleoside and the amino acid residues (221–234) that were formerly disordered in the structure of the reduced abasic site-containing DNA complex. A revised model was built to account for all difference density, and several rounds of simulated annealing, energy minimization, and individual B-factor refinement, together with model-corrections and the addition of water molecules, were carried out while monitoring Rfree (21Brunger A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 24-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of the DHU-containing DNA complex was determined and refined in a similar manner using the oxoG-containing DNA complex as a starting point.

Open table in a new tab In the initial biochemical phase of this investigation, we verified that a mutant version of B. stearothermophilus MutM containing the E3Q modification (E3Q MutM) bound specifically to oxoG-containing DNA but failed to perform chemistry on it (data not shown). Crystals of E3Q MutM in complex with an oxoG-containing duplex 15-mer oligonucleotide were grown under the previously reported conditions (13Fromme J.C. Verdine G.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 544-552PubMed Google Scholar). X-ray diffraction data were collected, and the structure of the lesion recognition complex was determined by difference-Fourier analysis (Table I). Not surprisingly, the overall structure of the oxoG recognition complex is very similar to those of previously reported MutM co-complex structures lacking a cognate lesion, with a protein backbone root mean square deviation of 0.37 Å for the present structure versus that of MutM bound to DNA containing a reduced abasic site (13Fromme J.C. Verdine G.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 544-552PubMed Google Scholar). The most significant difference is the appearance of an ordered active site loop that was previously absent from the electron density maps of MutM/DNA structures lacking a lesion nucleobase (Fig. 1, purple). We refer to this segment, which resembles a “figure 8,” as the βF-α10 loop, owing to its location between β-sheet F and α-helix 10 (22Sugahara M. Mikawa T. Kumasaka T. Yamamoto M. Kato R. Fukuyama K. Inoue Y. Kuramitsu S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3857-3869Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Features of 8-Oxoguanine Recognition—The electron density maps in the active site region of the lesion recognition complex clearly reveal the presence of the entire oxo-dG lesion nucleoside (Fig. 2). The oxo-dG moiety is extruded from the DNA duplex and inserted into the extrahelical MutM active site, as anticipated from the oxoG-less structures (11Serre L. Pereira de Jesus K. Boiteux S. Zelwer C. Castaing B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2854-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 12Gilboa R. Zharkov D.O. Golan G. Fernandes A.S. Gerchman S.E. Matz E. Kycia J.H. Grollman A.P. Shoham G.

Biol. 2002; 9: 544-552PubMed Google Scholar) and in common with human Ogg1 (hOgg1) and other structurally characterized DNA glycosylases that act on single-base lesions. Apart from this point of similarity, the oxoG recognition mode of MutM is quite distinct from that of hOgg1. Whereas hOgg1 bears a rigid, preformed pocket into which the oxoG base fits snugly (15Bruner S.D. Norman D.P. Verdine G.L. Nature. 2000; 403: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 23Norman D.P.G. Bruner S.D. Verdine G.L. J. Am. Chem.

Biol. 2003; 10: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), MutM possesses a relatively open, plastic oxoG recognition motif that is fully assembled only upon closure of the βF-α10 loop over the oxoG nucleobase. In the MutM active site, the oxo-dG nucleoside adopts a syn glycosidic torsion angle (Fig. 2, a and b); conversely, the same lesion is recognized by hOgg1 in the anti glycosidic configuration (15Bruner S.D. Norman D.P. Verdine G.L. Nature. 2000; 403: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). The syn configuration is thermodynamically favored over anti for an isolated oxoG nucleoside (26Uesugi S. Ikehara M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1977; 99: 3250-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), but both rotamers are found in oxoG-containing duplex DNA, with syn being preferred for oxoG paired opposite A (27Kouchakdjian M.

The βF-α10 loop plays a key role in recognition of the oxoG base. A discrete projection from the loop wraps itself around the exocyclic O6 of oxoG (Fig. 2a), with four consecutive main-chain amide protons (residues 222–225) making hydrogen bonds to this one single atom of the nucleobase. None of these four residues that contact O6 is strictly conserved, perhaps unsurprisingly since lesion recognition involves only main-chain amides, and only sparse interactions are observed between side chains of the βF-α10 loop and the main body of MutM. The structure of the O6-binding projection appears to be stabilized and anchored by a bridging hydrogen bond between the side-chain hydroxyl group of Thr-221, which is conserved (Thr or Ser), and the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of Tyr-225 (Fig. 2c). On the other hand, hOgg1 makes no direct contact to O6 of oxoG, but instead has bridging contacts through the intermediacy of two ordered water molecules (15Bruner S.D. Norman D.P. Verdine G.L. Nature. 2000; 403: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). No water-mediated contacts to oxoG are evident in the present structure. MutM also recognizes the Watson-Crick face of oxoG through hydrogen-bonding contacts to two residues, Thr-224 and Glu-78. Specifically, the side-chain hydroxyl of Thr-224 is positioned suitably to interact simultaneously with both N1 and N2 of oxoG, whereas the side-chain carboxylate of Glu-78 is separated by a somewhat shorter distance from N2 (Fig. 3a). In the case of hOgg1, a single residue, Gln-315, makes a bifurcated hydrogen-bonding interaction with both N1 and N2 (15Bruner S.D. Norman D.P. Verdine G.L. Nature. 2000; 403: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar), similar to Thr-224 of MutM. MutM makes no significant interactions with the π-face of oxoG, which results in the lesion recognition pocket having a rather spacious interior. Again, this differs from hOgg1, in which the oxoG is sandwiched between two residues (Cys-253 and Phe-319), each of which contacts one of the two π-faces of the lesion nucleobase. A central question of this study is the means by which MutM distinguishes oxoG from undamaged DNA bases. The aforementioned interactions involving O6, N1, N2, and the π-face of oxoG provide an obvious basis for distinguishing oxoG from adenine (A), cytosine (C), and thymine (T) because these normal bases bear distinct functionalities at the corresponding positions. These contacts, however, do not provide a clear basis for distinguishing oxoG from G because the two bear identical functionalities at the indicated positions. The structural differences between G and oxoG are localized to their five-membered heterocyclic rings, with C–H versus C=O at the 8-position and N: versus N–H at the 7-position, respectively. MutM exploits the difference in protonation state at N7 to distinguish oxoG from G. Specifically, the main-chain carbonyl of Ser-220 lies in close hydrogen-bonding contact with the N7 amide proton of oxoG, an interaction that would be repulsed by the N7 lone electron pair on G. Although the C=O group in oxoG does appear to be hydrogen-bonded to the side-chain amide of Gln-3, this contact may be an artifact of the E3Q mutation; the side-chain carboxylate of Glu-3 would instead experience a repulsive interaction with the 8-carbonyl oxygen (see below). Taking this into account, we conclude that the enzyme indirectly detects the occurrence of oxidation at C8 by sensing the attendant addition of a proton at N7. This strategy for oxoG/G discrimination is remarkably similar to that used by hOgg1, Namely, the eukaryotic protein does not contact the C8 of oxoG but rather uses the main-chain carbonyl of Gly-42 to recognize the protonated N7 position (15Bruner S.D. Norman D.P. Verdine G.L. Nature. 2000; 403: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). In an effort to model the active form of the enzyme, we used least-squares superposition to transplant Glu-3 into the E3Q structure (Fig. 3b). Confidence in this model is strengthened by the fact that the active site structure, including the position and conformation of Glu-3, is nearly identical in several independently determined x-ray co-crystal structures of MutM (11Serre L. Pereira de Jesus K. Boiteux S. Zelwer C. Castaing B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2854-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 12Gilboa R. Zharkov D.O. Golan G. Fernandes A.S. Gerchman S.E. Matz E.

Biol. 2002; 9: 544-552PubMed Google Scholar) and EndoVIII (31Zharkov D.O. Golan G. Gilboa R. Fernandes A.S. Gerchman S.E. Kycia J.H. Rieger R.A. Grollman A.P. Shoham G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 789-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) representing different stages of the repair reaction. The only significant point of divergence among all the DNA-bound structures, apart from the differences in covalent structure of the bound lesion, is the degree of disorder in the βF-α10 loop. In all these structures, Glu-3 serves as an N-cap for helix α-E, with one carbonyl oxygen directed toward the amide NHs of Gly-173 and Tyr-176 (or the corresponding residue) and the other pointed toward the amide NHs of Asn-174 and Ile-175 (Fig. 3b). In the present structure of the E3Q mutant protein, the side-chain amide carbonyl of Gln-3 maintains a helix-capping interaction with Gly-173 and Tyr-176, but the side chain is swiveled to avoid a repulsive interaction between its amide–NH2 group and the backbone amides of Asn-174 and Ile-176. This swiveling enables the Gly-3 amide to hydrogen bond to O8 of oxoG. It is at least a formal possibility that the carboxylate side chain of Glu-3 is actually protonated when the wild-type enzyme binds oxoG and that the acidic–OH group of the protonated carboxyl hydrogen bonds to O8 of oxoG in a manner much like the amide–NH2 of Gln-3. An attraction of this scenario is that it would obviously facilitate the glycosyl transfer step by activating the oxoG leaving group; a difficulty is that carboxylates involved in helix-capping interactions have unusually high acidity and are therefore unlikely to be protonated (32Forsyth W.R. Antosiewicz J.M. Robertson A.D. Proteins. 2002; 48: 388-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The glycosylase reaction proceeds via nucleophilic substitution at C1′ by the α-amino group of Pro-2 (33Tchou J. Grollman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11671-11677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 34Zharkov D.O. Rieger R.A. Iden C.R. Grollman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5335-5341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The α-nitrogen atom of Pro-2 lies close to C1′ but is not well aligned for an in-line SN2-type displacement of oxoG. Alternatively, the reaction could proceed by an SN1-type mechanism, in which the base is excised first to yield a reactive oxocarbenium ion intermediate, which is subsequently attacked by the α-N of Pro-2 (Figs. 2B and 3B). Kinetic isotope effect studies (35Werner R.M. Stivers J.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14054-14064Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and computational evidence (36Dinner A.R. Blackburn G.M. Karplus M. Nature. 2001; 413: 752-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) indicate a substrate-assisted SN1 mechanism for uracil DNA glycosylase, and it is not unreasonable to expect that MutM performs catalysis by a similar mechanism. Additional support for a MutM-catalyzed SN1 mechanism is found in the extensive array of hydrogen-bonding interactions to O6 of oxoG, reminiscent of the oxyanion hole of serine proteases, which would activate the oxoG base as a leaving group; additional activation could possibly be gained via protonation at C8 by Glu-3. Recognition of an Alternative Substrate—In addition to oxoG, MutM repairs a number of alternative substrates, most notably formamidopyrimidine (37Boiteux S. O'Connor T.R. Lederer F. Gouyette A. Laval J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3916-3922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38O'Connor T.R. Boiteux S. Laval J. Ann. Ist. Super. Sanita. 1989; 25: 27-31PubMed Google Scholar, 39Tchou J.

Kow Y.W. Purmal A.A. Cunningham R.P. Wallace S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18814-18820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the hydantoin lesions (41Leipold M.D. Muller J.G. Burrows C.J. David S.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14984-14992Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We tested the activity of MutM on DNA containing DHU, the product resulting from reduction of the C5=C6 double bond in uridine to furnish the corresponding singly bonded CH5–CH6 system. We determined that MutM catalyzes excision and strand-nicking of DHU-containing DNA and that E3Q MutM binds stably to this lesion without catalysis (data not shown). We grew crystals of the E3Q MutM-DHU-containing DNA complex and determined the structure by difference-Fourier analysis (Table I). Electron density for the DHU moiety is clearly visible in the active site, and the density is distinct enough to observe the puckering of the non-aromatic reduced pyrimidine ring (Fig. 4a). The two carbonyl groups of DHU (O2 and O4) reside in locations virtually identical to those of oxoG (O8 and O6, respectively). Additionally, the protonated N3 atom of DHU is in roughly the same location as the protonated N7 atom of oxoG (Fig. 4b). Most active site residues are in essentially the same conformations in both recognition complexes, preserving the βF-α10 loop structure through interaction with O4 of DHU or O6 of oxoG. One exception is the side chain of Thr-224, which is disordered in the DHU recognition complex. Thus, the interactions with N1 and N2 of oxoG described above are necessary for ordering of this side chain. As a consequence of this disorder, the loop is more flexible in the vicinity of Thr-224 in the DHU recognition complex, judged by weaker electron density and nearly 2-fold higher B-factors when compared with nearby residues. Another difference between the two different recognition complex structures is the positioning of the Glu-78 side chain. This side chain is retracted from the DHU lesion base when compared with the position it occupies when interacting with N2 of oxoG. Based on these two structures of recognition complexes with different lesions, the primary structural requirements for competent MutM substrates appear to be a hydrogen bond donor and acceptor positioned approximately where N7 and O6, respectively, are located in the oxoG recognition complex. Formamidopyrimidine and the hydantoins also meet these requirements. The determinants for specific recognition of 5-hydroxycytosine are less obvious; perhaps the N4–H2 and 5-OH groups are recognized in the same ways as the N7–H and O6 of oxoG, respectively. Consequences of βF-α10 Loop Flexibility—Despite being disordered in DNA-bound structures without lesion base (11Serre L. Pereira de Jesus K. Boiteux S. Zelwer C. Castaing B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2854-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 12Gilboa R. Zharkov D.O. Golan G. Fernandes A.S. Gerchman S.E. Matz E. Kycia J.H. Grollman A.P. Shoham G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19811-19816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 13Fromme J.C. Verdine G.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 544-552PubMed Google Scholar), the βF-α10 loop is ordered in the crystal structure of Thermus thermophilus MutM determined in the absence of DNA (22Sugahara M. Mikawa T. Kumasaka T. Yamamoto M. Kato R. Fukuyama K. Inoue Y. Kuramitsu S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3857-3869Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Superimposing the T. thermophilus MutM structure on the present structure indicates that the βF-α10 loop retains approximately the same folded structure in both (Fig. 1b). This comparison is complicated by the presence of a two-residue insertion in the T. thermophilus MutM sequence; however, this insertion is articulated merely as an extension of the tip of the loop in the T. thermophilus MutM structure. The large body of structural data now available for MutM (Refs. 11Serre L. Pereira de Jesus K. Boiteux S. Zelwer C. Castaing B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2854-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 12Gilboa R. Zharkov D.O. Golan G. Fernandes A.S. Gerchman S.E. Matz E. Kycia J.H. Grollman A.P. Shoham G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19811-19816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 13Fromme J.C. Verdine G.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 544-552PubMed Google Scholar and this work) suggest that the βF-α10 loop is ordered prior to DNA binding and following oxoG insertion into the active site but becomes disordered following base excision. One way to rationalize this behavior is to hypothesize that the loop is in a relaxed state in the unliganded protein. DNA binding induces strain in the protein, perhaps by slight flexion at the domain interface, thereby causing the loop to become disordered. When oxoG is covalently linked to the DNA backbone and inserted into the lesion recognition pocket, the favorable enthalpy of loop/oxoG interactions provides conformational stability to the loop. An ordered βF-α10 loop may be necessary for catalysis of base excision chemistry, bearing in mind the wealth of main-chain amide protons employed by the enzyme to recognize O6. These amide protons may act as Lewis acids, similar to the oxyanion hole found in proteases, to accelerate base excision. The N7-discriminating Ser-220 residue (see above) lies at the N terminus of the mobile loop, and stabilization of Ser-220 via interaction with N7–H may be a prerequisite for loop ordering. If the interactions of the βF-α10 loop with O6 are accordingly contingent upon hydrogen bonding to the N7–H of oxoG, MutM would thereby couple oxoG recognition to catalysis using the βF-α10 loop. Once oxoG has been cleaved, it becomes entropically favored for the loop to become disordered, and the loop probably remains disordered during 3′- and 5′-strand-nicking that occurs via β- and δ-elimination reactions, respectively (42Bhagwat M. Gerlt J.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 659-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), because it is disordered in a borohydride-trapped reaction intermediate and in a DNA-bound end product complex (13Fromme J.C. Verdine G.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 544-552PubMed Google Scholar). The significance of βF-α10 loop flexibility upon base release is not clear. It is possible that the entropic advantage gained by disordering drives lesion base excision in the forward direction. In this scenario, the cost of ordering the loop is paid by the enthalpy of interactions with oxo-dG, but the interactions between the loop and the free oxoG base are not strong enough to balance the entropic cost of holding onto the base and keeping the loop ordered. Finally, disordering of the βF-α10 loop following base excision provides a means for water to enter the active site; water is thought to be the most likely candidate for a general acid/base to catalyze the β- and δ-elimination reactions (13Fromme J.C. Verdine G.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 544-552PubMed Google Scholar). Conclusions—We have determined structures of the catalytically inactive E3Q mutant MutM bound to an oxoG-containing DNA duplex and to a DHU-containing duplex. These structures reveal that the oxoG nucleoside is bound in the syn configuration about the glycosidic bond. The βF-α10 loop, known to be disordered in DNA-bound structures of MutM lacking a lesion base, is primarily responsible for recognizing the oxoG base through hydrogen bonds to main-chain atoms. Notably, the prime determinant of oxoG versus G selectivity is the protonation state of N7 on the nucleobase. MutM binds to the distinct DHU lesion in a manner similar to oxoG, utilizing a few identical functionalities on the smaller base. The flexibility of the βF-α10 loop suggests a possible functional role of loop ordering and disordering in oxoG recognition and catalysis by MutM.

https://openalex.org/W2070584671,"Zinc is an essential metal for all eukaryotes, and cells have evolved a complex system of proteins to maintain the precise balance of zinc uptake, intracellular storage, and efflux. In mammals, zinc uptake appears to be mediated by members of the Zrt/Irt-like protein (ZIP) superfamily of metal ion transporters. Herein, we have studied a subfamily of zip genes (zip1, zip2, and zip3) that is conserved in mice and humans. These eight-transmembrane domain proteins contain a conserved 12-amino acid signature sequence within the fourth transmembrane domain. All three of these mouse ZIP proteins function to specifically increase the uptake of zinc in transfected cultured cells, similar to the previously demonstrated functions of human ZIP1 and ZIP2 (Gaither, L. A., and Eide, D. J. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 5560–5564; Gaither, L. A., and Eide, D. J. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 22258–22264). No ZIP3 orthologs have been previously studied. Furthermore, this first systematic comparative study of the in vivo expression and dietary zinc regulation of this subfamily of zip genes revealed that 1) zip1 mRNA is abundant in many mouse tissues, whereas zip2 and zip3 mRNAs are very rare or moderately rare, respectively, and tissue-restricted in their accumulation; and 2) unlike mouse metallothionein I and zip4 mRNAs (Dufner-Beattie, J., Wang, F., Kuo, Y.-M., Gitschier, J., Eide, D., and Andrews, G. K. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 33474–33481), the abundance of zip1, zip2, and zip3 mRNAs is not regulated by dietary zinc in the intestine and visceral endoderm, tissues involved in nutrient absorption. These studies suggest that all three of these ZIP proteins may play cell-specific roles in zinc homeostasis rather than primary roles in the acquisition of dietary zinc. Zinc is an essential metal for all eukaryotes, and cells have evolved a complex system of proteins to maintain the precise balance of zinc uptake, intracellular storage, and efflux.

These studies suggest that all three of these ZIP proteins may play cell-specific roles in zinc homeostasis rather than primary roles in the acquisition of dietary zinc. Zinc is an essential trace element that is required for the catalytic activity of numerous metalloenzymes (4.Vallee B.L. Auld D.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5647-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1536) Google Scholar, 5.Berg J.M. Shi Y.G. Science. 1996; 271: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar) and can also serve a purely structural role by stabilizing the conformation of certain zinc-dependent protein domains, such as zinc fingers, zinc clusters, and RING fingers, that are commonly found in transcriptional regulatory proteins (5.Berg J.M. Shi Y.G. Science. 1996; 271: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar, 6.Krishna S.S. Majumdar I. Grishin N.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 532-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Deficiency of this essential metal can have devastating effects. In mammals, inadequate levels of zinc in the diet lead to dermatologic lesions, growth retardation, mental disorders, and compromised function of the immune and reproductive systems (7.Fraker P.J. King L.E. Laakko T. Vollmer T.L. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 1399S-1406SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Harris E.D. Nutr. Rev. 2002; 60: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 9.Apgar J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1985; 5: 43-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Likewise, high levels of zinc can be cytotoxic. Thus, cells must maintain tight control over intracellular zinc levels. This control is achieved through a balance of zinc efflux, cellular zinc storage, and zinc uptake. Each of these activities is mediated by a distinct family of proteins (8.Harris E.D. Nutr. Rev. 2002; 60: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In mammals, the zinc transporter (ZnT) 1The abbreviations used are: ZnTzinc transporterMTmetallothioneinZIPZrt/Irt-like proteinIrtiron-regulated transporterZrtzinc-regulated transporterESTexpressed sequence tagRTreverse transcriptionHAhemagglutininBACbacterial artificial chromosome. family of proteins function in a tissue-, cell-, and organelle-specific manner to regulate intracellular zinc homeostasis. These proteins contain six predicted transmembrane domains and are thought to function as multimers. Seven members of the Znt family have been identified to date in mammals (Znt1–7), and genetic studies have confirmed the importance of many of these genes in mammalian zinc metabolism (10.Palmiter R.D.

Ravindra R. Daniels P.J. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34803-34809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), and dietary zinc modulates Znt1 and Znt2 mRNA levels in the kidney, intestine, and liver (19.Liuzzi J.P. Blanchard R.K. Cousins R.J. J. Nutr. 2001; 131: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Zinc can also regulate the intracellular localization of the ZnT4 and ZnT6 proteins (16.Huang L.P. Kirschke C.P. Gitschier J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26389-26395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). zinc transporter metallothionein Zrt/Irt-like protein iron-regulated transporter zinc-regulated transporter expressed sequence tag reverse transcription hemagglutinin bacterial artificial chromosome. Intracellular zinc is bound by small cysteine-rich proteins called metallothioneins (MTs) (20.Coyle P. Philcox J.C. Carey L.C. Rofe A.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 627-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). In the mouse, the MT family consists of four members. Exposure to high levels of zinc causes MT accumulation through increased gene expression, whereas dietary zinc deficiency leads to decreased MT abundance through decreased gene expression and protein destabilization (21.Andrews G.K. Prog. Food Nutr. Sci. 1990; 14: 193-258PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins are thought to sequester zinc when present at high levels, protecting against heavy metal toxicity, and to provide a labile pool of zinc under limiting conditions that can be released for use by other proteins. In eukaryotes, uptake of several essential metals is mediated by members of the Zrt/Irt-like protein (ZIP) superfamily of metal ion transporters (22.Eide D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 23.Guerinot M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). The first member of this family to be identified was iron-regulated transporter-1 (Irt1) from Arabidopsis. Irt1 was found to preferentially import iron, but can also transport manganese, cadmium, and zinc (24.Eide D. Broderius M. Fett J. Guerinot M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5624-5628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar, 25.Eng B.H. Guerinot M.L. Eide D. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Membr.

A. 2000; 97: 12356-12360Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Subsequently, two other members of this superfamily (zinc-regulated transporter-1 (Zrt1) and Zrt2) were identified that function in zinc uptake in yeast (28.Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 29.Zhao H. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23203-23210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The acronym for the superfamily (i.e. ZIP) reflects Zrt- and Irt-like proteins. ZIP proteins contain eight putative transmembrane domains with conserved histidine, serine, and glycine residues within the fourth transmembrane domain, which may play a role in metal binding during transport. These proteins also often contain a histidine-rich loop between the third and fourth transmembrane domains. Computer searches of the human and mouse genome sequences reveal multiple members of the ZIP superfamily (12 in human) (30.Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. Biometals. 2001; 14: 251-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the regulation and function of most of these mammalian ZIP genes. A conserved subfamily of three zip genes (zip1, zip2, and zip3) has been identified in mice and humans. Human ZIP1 (SLC39A1) and ZIP2 (SLC39A2) have been demonstrated to function as zinc transporters, and ZIP1 is the major zinc uptake protein in K562 cells (1.Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5560-5564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 2.Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22258-22264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). No studies on the function of ZIP3 have been reported. The recent findings that the human ZIP4 gene (SLC39A4) is mutated in the genetic zinc metabolism disorder acrodermatitis enteropathica (31.Wang K. Zhou B. Kuo Y.-M. Gitschier J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 71: 66-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) and that this conserved gene encodes a zinc-regulated zinc transporter in mice (3.Dufner-Beattie J. Wang F. Kuo Y.-M. Gitschier J. Eide D. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33474-33481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) suggest that mammalian ZIP genes are integral components of the zinc homeostatic mechanism. Although several recent studies have examined the expression and regulation of members of this conserved subfamily of three zip genes, there have been no systematic comparative studies of their expression or regulation in vivo. zip1 mRNA has been detected in most adult rat and many embryonic mouse tissues (32.Lioumi M. Ferguson C.A. Sharpe P.T. Freeman T. Marenholz I. Mischke D. Heizmann C. Ragoussis J. Genomics. 1999; 62: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and ZIP1 mRNA is also found in most human tissues (2.Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22258-22264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and cultured human cell lines. In contrast, ZIP2 mRNA was not detectable by Northern blot analysis of human tissue RNAs (1.Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5560-5564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Expression of ZIP3 has not been examined in any system, and expression of zip1 and zip2 has not been examined in adult mouse tissues. A modest hormonal regulation of ZIP1 mRNA in cultured prostate cell lines has been reported (33.Costello L.C. Liu Y. Zou J. Franklin R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17499-17504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar); and in human monocytes and THP-1 cells treated with a zinc chelator, ZIP2 mRNA abundance increased significantly, whereas ZIP1, ZIP3, and ZIP4 mRNA abundance did not change (34.Cousins R.J. Blanchard R.K. Popp M.P. Liu L. Cao J. Moore J.B. Green C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6952-6957Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 35.Cao J. Bobo J.A. Liuzzi J.P. Cousins R.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 559-566PubMed Google Scholar). The objective of the studies presented herein was to characterize in detail the structure and function the mouse zip1, zip2, and zip3 genes and to compare and contrast their regulation in vivo in nutrient-absorptive tissues (intestine and embryonic visceral endoderm) during periods of dietary zinc deficiency. Computer Analyses of Sequence Data—Multiple sequence alignments were performed using the AlignX application within the Vector NTI Suite program (Informax, Bethesda, MD). Plasmid Construction—The expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for zip1 (GenBank™/EBI accession number BE572790) and zip3 (accession number BF100710) were obtained from Incyte Genomics (St. Louis, MO). Sequencing of these ESTs revealed that they contain the expected open reading frames. The mouse zip2 cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR from poly(A)+ RNA isolated from the placentas of day 12 zinc-deficient pregnant mice (described below). Reverse transcription was carried out using Improm-II reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI), and PCR of the open reading frame was carried out using Pfu DNA Polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). For zinc uptake studies, selectable mammalian pcDNA3.1Puro(+) expression plasmids (36.Thomas L.R. Stillman D.J. Thorburn A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34343-34348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) encoding each of the three mouse ZIP proteins with C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tags were constructed through a multistep cloning strategy. The resulting plasmids contained the open reading frame, including at least 6 bp preceding the initiator methionine for optimal translation fused in-frame at the 3′-end with an oligomer encoding an HA tag. In the case of zip3, the potential upstream initiator methionine that does not adhere to the Kozak consensus sequence (37.Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 5233-5262Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) (see “Results”) was included in the plasmid in case it is the actual translation start point. Each plasmid was sequenced in its entirety to confirm the absence of mutations introduced during the subcloning process. Animal Care and Use—All experiments involving mice were performed in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care Committee. CD-1 mice (48–60 days old) were purchased from Charles River Breeding Laboratories (Raleigh, NC). Mouse diets were purchased from Harlan Teklad (Madison, WI) and have been described in detail previously (38.Dalton T.P. Fu K. Palmiter R.D. Andrews G.K. J. Nutr. 1996; 126: 825-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Zinc levels in the diets were as follows: zinc-deficient, 1 ppm zinc; and zinc-adequate, 50 ppm zinc. These diets are otherwise identical. To examine tissue-specific expression, female or male CD-1 mice (six per group) maintained on zinc-adequate feed were killed, and the indicated tissues were harvested and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent extraction of RNA for Northern analysis. Pancreatic RNA was extracted immediately from fresh tissue. To examine the effect of dietary zinc deficiency during pregnancy on mouse zip mRNA levels, pregnant mice were subjected to moderate dietary zinc deficiency as described previously (39.Andrews G.K. Geiser J. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 40.Andrews G.K. Lee D.K. Ravindra R. Lichtlen P. Sirito M. Sawadogo M. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1114-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 41.Lee D.K. Geiser J. Dufner-Beattie J. Andrews G.K. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). CD-1 females were mated with CD-1 males; the day a vaginal plug was found was considered day 1 of pregnancy. On day 1, mice were placed in pairs in cages and provided free access to zinc-adequate feed and deionized distilled water. On day 8, mice were placed in pairs in cages with stainless steel false bottoms to reduce the recycling of zinc (42.Cook Mills J.M. Fraker P.J. Br. J. Nutr. 1993; 69: 835-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Water bottles were washed with 4 m HCl and rinsed with deionized water to remove zinc. The diet was changed to the zinc-deficient diet, or where indicated, the zinc-adequate diet was maintained. The visceral yolk sacs, placentas, and maternal small intestines were harvested on days 11–15 (six mice per group) and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA extraction and subsequent Northern analysis or RT-PCR. RNA Extraction and Northern Analysis—Total RNA was isolated either using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions or as described previously (18.Langmade S.J. Ravindra R. Daniels P.J. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34803-34809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 40.Andrews G.K. Lee D.K. Ravindra R. Lichtlen P. Sirito M. Sawadogo M. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1114-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Polyadenylated RNA was purified from total RNA using the Oligotex mRNA isolation kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (3 μg/lane) was fractionated on formaldehyde-containing 1% agarose gels, transferred to nylon membranes, and immobilized via UV cross-linking (43.Dalton T.P. Palmiter R.D. Andrews G.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5016-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Duplicate gels were stained with acridine orange to monitor RNA integrity and to normalize for loading. DNA fragments containing full-length zip1, zip2, or zip3 cDNA were excised from plasmids and used as probes for Northern blot hybridization. Probes were labeled with [32P]dCTP using the Random Primers DNA labeling system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mouse MT-I probe was as described previously (38.Dalton T.P. Fu K. Palmiter R.D. Andrews G.K. J. Nutr. 1996; 126: 825-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Membranes were hybridized and washed under stringent conditions as described previously (18.Langmade S.J. Ravindra R. Daniels P.J. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34803-34809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 38.Dalton T.P. Fu K. Palmiter R.D. Andrews G.K. J.

Hybrids were detected by autoradiography with intensifying screens at –70 °C. Cell Culture and Transient Transfections—HEK293 cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. For transient transfections, cells were seeded onto poly-l-lysine-treated 24-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well and were transfected the following day. Transfections were carried out using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Zinc uptake assays were performed 36–48 h later. Zinc Uptake Assays—Zinc uptake assays were performed as described previously (1.Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5560-5564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 2.Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22258-22264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). After transfection, cells were washed once with cold uptake buffer (15 mm HEPES, 100 mm glucose, and 150 mm KCl, pH 7.0), followed by a 10-min incubation with prewarmed uptake buffer. Cells were then incubated in prewarmed uptake buffer containing the specified concentration of 65ZnCl2 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a 37 °C shaking incubator for 15 min unless otherwise indicated. Assays were stopped by addition of an equal volume of cold uptake buffer supplemented with 1 mm EDTA (stop buffer). Cells were collected by filtration on glass fiber filters (Type A/E, Gelman Sciences) and washed three times with stop buffer (total of 10 ml). Cell-associated radioactivity was measured with a Packard Auto-Gamma 5650 γ-counter. Metal salts were obtained from Sigma. Stock solutions of the chloride salts of various metals (CuCl2, CdCl2, MnCl2, CoCl2, MgCl2, and NiCl2) and AgNO3 were prepared at 100 mm in distilled water. A ZnCl2 stock was prepared at 100 mm in 0.02 n HCl, and an FeCl3 stock was prepared at 50 mm in 0.1 n HCl. Sodium ascorbate (1 mm) was used to reduce Fe3+ to Fe2+. Ascorbate treatment alone did not alter zinc uptake activity (data not shown). Cells grown in parallel to those used for uptake experiments were washed three times with ice-cold uptake buffer, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% SDS and 1% Triton X-100 for cell lysis, and then assayed for protein content using a Bradford assay kit. Zinc accumulation and uptake rates were normalized to protein concentrations of these cell lysates. Michaelis-Menten constants were determined by nonlinear interpolation of the data using Prism (Version 3.0a for Macintosh, GraphPAD Software, San Diego, CA). RT-PCR Detection of Mouse zip2 mRNA—Tissue-specific expression of zip2 was examined by RT-PCR. Total RNA from various mouse tissues (1 μg/reaction) was DNase I-treated according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). DNase I was inactivated by addition of EDTA to 2.5 mm, followed by a 10-min incubation at 65 °C. Reverse transcription was subsequently carried out using Improm-II reverse transcriptase. Samples were then amplified using Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Stratagene) for 30 cycles. Mouse zip2 was amplified using primers 2TXTS (5′-CTTCTTGGGAGCAGGGTTGATGC-3′) and 210073AS (5′-CGCCACTGTGGCCTGTAGTCC-3′) to give a 406-bp product. Mouse zip1 was used as a control for RT reactions because it is widely expressed and was amplified using primers mZIP1KOZS (5′-CGGGATCCACAGCCACCATGGGGCCCT-3′) and mZIP1GFPAS (5′-CGGAATTCTTAGATTTGGACAAAGAGAAGGCCAGTGAGC-3′) to give a 1000-bp product. RT-PCR was used to examine the effect of dietary zinc deficiency during pregnancy on mouse zip2 mRNA abundance. Total RNA (1 μg; isolated from embryonic visceral yolk sacs from the zinc-deficient pregnant mice described above) was DNase I-treated and reverse-transcribed as described above. Samples were then amplified using Platinum Taq DNA polymerase for increasing increments of three cycles, starting at 21 cycles and proceeding to 33 cycles. Mouse zip2 was amplified using primers 2TXTS and 210073AS. Mouse zip1 was used as a negative control for regulation by dietary zinc and was amplified using primers mZIP1KOZS and mZIP1GFPAS. Mouse MT-I was used as a positive control for regulation by dietary zinc and was amplified using primers MT1S3 (5′-CACCACGACTTCAACGTCCTG-3′) and MT1AS604 (5′-TCTTGCAGGCGCAGGAGCTG-3′) to give a 138-bp product. Accession Numbers—The GenBank™/EBI accession numbers are as follows: zip1 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC), AC096622 and AC096623; zip1 pseudogene BAC, AC021434; zip2 BAC, AC079536; zip3 BAC, AC073816; zip1 EST, BE572790; and zip3 EST, BF100710. Characterization of the Mouse zip1, zip2, and zip3 Genes and cDNAs—To identify mouse ZIP subfamily members, the conserved 12-amino acid signature sequence (HSVFEGLAVGLQ) from the human ZIP1, ZIP2, and ZIP3 proteins (Fig. 1) was used to search the mouse translated high throughput genome sequences data base on the NCBI Protein Database server. This search identified three different BAC entries that were derived from the C57/B6 strain of mice (see “Experimental Procedures” for accession numbers). Alignment of the cDNA sequences of the human ZIP genes with the nucleotide sequences flanking the signature sequences within each of these three mouse BACs (Fig. 1) provided the identity of the mouse zip1, zip2, and zip3 genes. The cDNA corresponding to each gene was identified by alignment of ESTs from the mouse EST data base to generate overlapping contiguous consensus sequences. This approach worked well to identify the cDNAs for zip1 and zip3, which are ∼2300 and 3750 bp in length, respectively, because there were several ESTs for each of these genes in the data base. Unfortunately, it did not work for zip2 because there were only three zip2 EST entries in the data base. Therefore, the full-length human ZIP2 cDNA sequence was aligned with the genomic sequence in the zip2 BAC. The high degree of homology shared between the human ZIP2 cDNA sequence and the mouse zip2 genomic sequence helped reveal the zip2 cDNA sequence, which was found to be ∼1350 bp in length. PCR primers were designed using this information to amplify the cDNA containing the coding sequence. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends was carried out for each of these three mouse zip genes to identify the 5′-end of the cDNA. In each case, the 5′-end was extended either by only a few base pairs or not at all compared with the known cDNA and EST sequences in the data bases. The 3′-end of each cDNA is demarcated by a poly(A) tail. In the case of zip3, comparison of ESTs revealed two different messages that are identical in coding sequence, but one ends prematurely due to the use of a non-canonical polyadenylation signal (Fig. 2C). The number of ESTs corresponding to this shorter transcript suggests that this message is significantly less abundant than the longer message. As this alternative poly(A) tail occurs within the 3′-untranslated region, the same protein is predicted to be encoded by both messages. Both zip1 and zip3 cDNAs contain a thymidine-rich region within their long 3′-untranslated regions, but the significance of this is not yet known. Comparison of the zip1 cDNA and gene sequences initially revealed a zip1 pseudogene within this BAC in the data base. The pseudogene has no introns, terminates in a poly(A) tract, and displays mismatches and codon deletions compared with the EST sequences. To identify a BAC containing the actual expressed zip1 gene, primers were designed to differentiate between the functional gene and the pseudogene based on the sequence mismatches. These primers were sent to Incyte Genomics for PCR screening of a mouse genomic BAC library. Two positive clones were identified, and partial sequence analysis revealed that they were devoid of the nucleotide mismatches seen in the pseudogene. These BACs were then sequenced in their entirety at the Mouse Genomic Sequencing Group of the University of Oklahoma. The exon-intron structure for each gene was determined by aligning the gene with the cDNA and by identifying splice donor and acceptor consensus sequences (Fig. 2). All three genes are relatively small, spanning <10 kilobase pairs of DNA, and contain four exons. Using accession numbers for the BACs containing each zip gene, the chromosomal localization was assigned using the mouse genome server. 2Available at www.ensembl.org. Localization of zip1 to chromosome 3 is consistent with a previous report (32.Lioumi M. Ferguson C.A. Sharpe P.T. Freeman T. Marenholz I. Mischke D. Heizmann C. Ragoussis J. Genomics. 1999; 62: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The zip2 gene was localized to chromosome 14, the zip3 gene to chromosome 10, and the zip1 pseudogene to chromosome 2. Analysis of the cDNA sequence revealed that the predicted mouse ZIP1, ZIP2, and ZIP3 proteins are 324, 309, and 317 amino acids in length, respectively. Alignment of the predicted human and mouse ZIP proteins revealed significant sequence conservation along the entire length of each of the three proteins (Fig. 3). The mouse and human ZIP1, ZIP2, and ZIP3 proteins are 93, 78, and 83% identical, and 96, 85, and 90% similar, respectively. Computer analysis of the zip3 cDNA identified an open reading frame for mouse ZIP3 that contains an additional 31 amino acids N-terminal to the initiator methionine shown in Fig. 3C. This extension is due to the presence of an in-frame methionine codon located 93 nucleotides farther upstream. This potential upstream start codon does"
https://openalex.org/W1994044440,"Drosophila Roundabout (Robo) is the founding member of a conserved family of repulsive axon guidance receptors that respond to secreted Slit proteins. Here we present evidence that the SH3-SH2 adaptor protein Dreadlocks (Dock), the p21-activated serine-threonine kinase (Pak), and the Rac1/Rac2/Mtl small GTPases can function during Robo repulsion. Loss-of-function and genetic interaction experiments suggest that limiting the function of Dock, Pak, or Rac partially disrupts Robo repulsion. In addition, Dock can directly bind to Robo's cytoplasmic domain, and the association of Dock and Robo is enhanced by stimulation with Slit. Furthermore, Slit stimulation can recruit a complex of Dock and Pak to the Robo receptor and trigger an increase in Rac1 activity. These results provide a direct physical link between the Robo receptor and an important cytoskeletal regulatory protein complex and suggest that Rac can function in both attractive and repulsive axon guidance."
https://openalex.org/W2051438294,"The functional organization of adult cerebral cortex is characterized by the presence of highly ordered sensory and motor maps. Despite their archetypical organization, the maps maintain the capacity to rapidly reorganize, suggesting that the neural circuitry underlying cortical representations is inherently plastic. Here we show that the circuitry supporting motor maps is dependent upon continued protein synthesis. Injections of two different protein synthesis inhibitors into adult rat forelimb motor cortex caused an immediate and enduring loss of movement representations. The disappearance of the motor map was accompanied by a significant reduction in synapse number, synapse size, and cortical field potentials and caused skilled forelimb movement impairments. Further, motor skill training led to a reappearance of movement representations. We propose that the circuitry of adult motor cortex is perpetually labile and requires continued protein synthesis in order to maintain its functional organization."
https://openalex.org/W2057458118,"Surfactant Protein C (SP-C) is a secreted transmembrane protein that is exclusively expressed by alveolar type II epithelial cells of the lung. SP-C associates with surfactant lipids to reduce surface tension within the alveolus, maintaining lung volume at end expiration. Mutations in the gene encoding SP-C (SFTPC) have recently been linked to chronic lung disease in children and adults. The goal of this study was to determine whether a disease-linked mutation in SFTPC causes lung disease in transgenic mice. The SFTPC mutation, designated g.1728 G → A, results in the deletion of exon4, generating a truncated form of SP-C (SP-CΔexon4). cDNA encoding SP-CΔexon4 was constitutively expressed in type II epithelial cells of transgenic mice. Viable F0 transgene-positive mice were not generated after two separate rounds of pronuclear injections. Histological analysis of lung tissue harvested from embryonic day 17.5 F0 transgene-positive fetuses revealed that SP-CΔexon4 caused a dose-dependent disruption in branching morphogenesis of the lung associated with epithelial cell cytotoxicity. Transient expression of SP-CΔexon4 in isolated type II epithelial cells or HEK293 cells resulted in incomplete processing of the mutant proprotein, a dose-dependent increase in BiP transcription, trapping of the proprotein in the endoplasmic reticulum, and rapid degradation via a proteasome-dependent pathway. Taken together, these data suggest that the g.1728 G → A mutation causes misfolding of the SP-C proprotein with subsequent induction of the unfolded protein response and endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathways ultimately resulting in disrupted lung morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1965101020,"The time course and functional significance of the structural changes associated with long-term facilitation of Aplysia sensory to motor neuron synaptic connections in culture were examined by time-lapse confocal imaging of individual sensory neuron varicosities labeled with three different fluorescent markers: the whole-cell marker Alexa-594 and two presynaptic marker proteins-synaptophysin-eGFP to monitor changes in synaptic vesicle distribution and synapto-PHluorin to monitor active transmitter release sites. Repeated pulses of serotonin induce two temporally, morphologically, and molecularly distinct presynaptic changes: (1) a rapid activation of silent presynaptic terminals by filling of preexisting empty varicosities with synaptic vesicles, which parallels intermediate-term facilitation, is completed within 3-6 hr and requires translation but not transcription and (2) a slower generation of new functional varicosities which occurs between 12-18 hr and requires transcription and translation. Enrichment of empty varicosities with synaptophysin accounts for 32% of the newly activated synapses at 24 hr, whereas newly formed varicosities account for 68%."

Here, I(Ks) channels assembled naturally by monomer subunits are compared to those with linked subunits that force defined stoichiometries. Two strategies that exploit charybdotoxin (CTX)-sensitive subunit variants are applied. First, CTX on rate, off rate, and equilibrium affinity are found to be the same for channels of monomers and those with a fixed 2:4 MinK:KCNQ1 valence. Second, 3H-CTX and an antibody are used to directly quantify channels and MinK subunits, respectively, showing 1.97 +/- 0.07 MinK per I(Ks) channel. Additional MinK subunits do not enter channels of monomeric subunits or those with fixed 2:4 valence. We conclude that two MinK subunits are necessary, sufficient, and the norm in I(Ks) channels. This stoichiometry is expected for other K(+) channels that contain MinK or MinK-related peptides (MiRPs)."
https://openalex.org/W2109535272,"The identity of motor neurons diverges markedly at different rostrocaudal levels of the spinal cord, but the signals that specify their fate remain poorly defined. We show that retinoid receptor activation in newly generated spinal motor neurons has a crucial role in specifying motor neuron columnar subtypes. Blockade of retinoid receptor signaling in brachial motor neurons inhibits lateral motor column differentiation and converts many of these neurons to thoracic columnar subtypes. Conversely, expression of a constitutively active retinoid receptor derivative impairs the differentiation of thoracic motor neuron columnar subtypes. These findings provide evidence for a regionally restricted role for retinoid signaling in the postmitotic specification of motor neuron columnar identity."

Since the Ski/Sno proto-oncogenes repress AP-1 and SMAD signaling, we hypothesized that DACH1 might play a similar cellular function. Herein, DACH1 was found to be expressed in breast cancer cell lines and to inhibit transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-induced apoptosis.

The inhibition of epithelial cell proliferation, production of extracellular matrix components, regulation of differentiation, and apoptosis by TGF-β involve a tightly coordinated signaling pathway (1Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Peptide Growth Factors and Their Receptors. Springer, Berlin1990: 419-472Google Scholar). Numerous components of the TGF-β pathway are tumor suppressors that are functionally mutated in cancer (2Massague J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2053) Google Scholar), and TGF-β1, the first member of the TGF-β family, plays an important role in cancer, including breast cancer, functioning both as an antiproliferative factor and as a tumor suppressor (3Attissano L.

Upon ligand binding, a heterodimeric complex forms between the type I and type II receptor, with the type II receptor transphosphorylating the type I receptor. The activated type I receptor interacts with an adaptor protein, SARA, which recruits Smad2 and Smad3 to serve as phosphorylation substrates of the type 1 receptor.The Smad family of transcription factors participates in TGF-β signaling at multiple levels (3Attissano L. Wrana J l. Science. 2002; 296: 1646-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated pathway-restricted Smad2 and Smad3 form heterodimers with the common mediator Smad4 in the cytoplasm and translocate into the nucleus, where they bind Smad-binding elements (SBEs) at specific promoters of genes regulating cell growth (5Derynck R.

Thus, overexpression of Ski antagonizes the normal response to TGF-β signaling (i.e. inhibition of cell growth) and enables the cells to grow in the presence of TGF-β (11Liu J. Stevens J. Rote C.A.

To identify and functionally characterize the candidate co-regulators contributing to TGF-β signaling, we hypothesized that proteins structurally related to important components mediating the TGF-β signal transduction pathway are likely to play significant roles. The Ski/Sno proteins share structural homology with the Dach protein (12Kozmik Z. Pfeffer P. Kralova J. Paces J. Paces V. Kalousova A. Cvekl A. Dev.

This domain comprises the critical region of Ski responsible for its oncogenic potential. From the crystallographic analysis of the DACH1 N-BOX (DS domain), it has been proposed that DACH1 might have a general and/or specific DNA binding activity (16Kim S.-S. Zhang R.-G. Braustin S.E.

Dach1 in combination with Six6 regulates proliferation of retinal and pituitary precursor cells by repressing cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors including p27Kip1 (24Li X. Perrisi V. Liu F. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 2002; 297: 1180-1183PubMed Google Scholar). The current studies examined the role of DACH1 in TGF-β signaling. DACH1 was expressed in breast cancer cell lines and inhibited TGF-β-induced apoptosis. DACH1 regulated endogenous TGF-β responsive genes and repressed TGF-β induction of AP-1 and Smad signaling. The conserved DS domain of DACH1 was required for binding to endogenous NCoR and for repression of TGF-β signaling by DACH1. These studies thus identify DACH1 as a regulator of TGF-β signaling that may contribute a better understanding of this complex pathway.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmid Construction—The full-length DACH1, DACH1 DS domain alone (DS), or DACH1 DS domain deleted (ΔDS) were cloned to pKW10 vector containing N-terminal FLAG peptide.

Luciferase assays were performed at room temperature using an Autolumat LB 953 (EG&G Berthold) (32Watanabe G. Albanese C. Lee R.J. Reutens A. Vairo G. Henglein B. Pestell R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3212-3222Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Statistical analyses were performed using Student's t test, and significant differences were established as p < 0.05. FACS analysis was used to determine the proportion of cells in the subG1 or apoptotic phase as previously described (33Ashton A.W. Watanabe G. Albanese C. Harrington E.O. Ware J.A. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20805-20811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).Microarray Analysis—mRNA was prepared from MDA-MB-231 pIND-DACH1 stable lines, treated with either vehicle or ponasterone A (2 μg/ml) for serial time points using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Following DNase I treatment (Takara Bio Inc., Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions, total RNA was amplified according to the Eberwine procedure (34Van Gelder R.N. von Zastrow M.E. Yool A. Dement W.C. Barchas J.D. Eberwine J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1663-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar) using the Ambion MessageAmp™ kit (Ambion). During in vitro transcription, biotin-11-CTP and biotin-16-UTP (Enzo Diagnostics, Farmingdale, NY) were incorporated. 20 μg of the biotinylated cRNA product was fragmented at 94 °C for 35 min. The sample was used for each hybridization reaction. Hybridization to a set of two Affymetrix U133A GeneChips (representing ∼22,000 open reading frames and at least 17,000 genes) was performed overnight, followed by staining and washing as per the manufacturer's instructions. The clean processed chips were then scanned using Agilent GeneArray scanner. Grid alignment and raw data generation were performed using Affymetrix GeneChip 5.0 software. For quality control, oligonucleotide B2 was hybridized to analyze the checkerboard pattern in each corner of the chip bioB, bioC, and bioD probes were added to each sample with varying concentrations to standardize hybridization; and staining and washing procedures were performed. Raw expression values, representing the average difference in hybridization intensity between oligonucleotides that perfectly match the transcript sequence and oligonucleotides containing single base pair mismatches, were measured. A noise value (Q) based on the variance of low intensity probe cells was used to calculate a minimum expression threshold (2.1 × Q) for each chipGene Selection—Data generated after scanning were subjected to comparison analysis to select change calls at 100% increase or decrease compared with vehicle control at each time point. The data selected after comparison analysis were further filtered based on absolute analysis using the Mann-Whitney test and detection calls, and 422 genes were selected for multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering.Multidimensional Scaling and Cluster Analysis—Multidimensional scaling (Matlab) was used to visualize the differences between control and treated samples selected above (see “Gene Selection”). To measure distance, the Pearson correlation coefficient was applied to each pair of control (•) and treated (♦, ▴) samples. To visualize expressions of genes, those that were selected above (see “Gene Selection”) and intra- and intersample pairs, hierarchical clustering was performed using Cluster 3.0 (Stanford University). A gene list corresponding to clusters was generated using the data mining tool from Affymetrix.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—293T cells and HaCaT cells were used for the detection of protein-protein interaction in vivo. Cells were transfected with the expression plasmids, cultured for 2 days, washed, scraped, and lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and proteinase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min. The protein concentration was measured by the Bio-Rad assay. 500 μg of total protein was incubated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) or anti-Smad4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), followed by incubation with protein G-Sepharose beads. The beads were washed five times with buffer containing 0.5% Tween 20 instead of 1% Triton X-100. The immunoprecipitates were eluted by boiling for 5 min in SDS sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 4% SDS) and subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis.Protein Purification and Immunodepletion—500 μg of anti-FLAG M2 gel (Sigma) was equilibrated in TBS (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl). 1 ml of whole cell extract derived from 293T cells, transfected with expression vector-encoding FLAG-DACH1, was incubated with the gel in TBS/Ca2+ binding buffer (TBS containing 1 mm CaCl2) at 4 °C, rotating overnight. The supernatant was saved as immunoprecipitated DACH1 whole cell extract for further Western blot and EMSA. The gel was washed five times with 1 ml of TBS/Ca2+, followed by a 30-min incubation of TBS/EDTA (TBS containing 2 mm EDTA) at room temperature. FLAG-tagged DACH1 was incubated and eluted by five sequential 50-μl TBS/EDTA elutions. 10 μl of FLAG-DACH1-transfected 293T whole cell extract, 10 or 20 μl of immunoprecipitated DACH1 whole cell extract, and 5, 10, or 20 μl of purified FLAG-DACH was loaded on 4–15% precast protein gel (Bio-Rad). Electrophoresis was conducted at 150 V for 1.5 h at 4 °C, and samples were transferred to the 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) at 100 V for 2 h at 4 °C. Blocking with 5% nonfat milk (Bio-Rad) at room temperature for 2 h and a blot with 1:1000 diluted anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) were performed. Membranes were washed and blotted with anti-mouse antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The fluorescence signal was detected after SuperSignal treatment (Pierce).Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—2 μl of 293T whole cell extracts prepared from cells transfected with Smad4, 1 μl of whole cell extract transfected with DACH1, 1 μl of immunoprecipitated DACH1, and 1 μl of purified DACH1 were incubated with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) in the presence or absence of specific self-oligo competitor on ice for 10 min. The FAST-1/SBE oligonucleotide (5′-CTGCCCTAAAATGTGTATTCCATGGAAATGTCTGCCCTTCTCTCCAG-3′) (35Yeo C.-Y. Chen X. Whitman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26584-26590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) was end-labeled with polynuclotide kinase using [γ-32P]ATP and incubated with whole cell extracts of 293T cells at room temperature for 10 min. Protein-DNA complexes were separated by 5% native polyacrylamide gels, running at room temperature in 0.5 TBE. Gels were dried and visualized by autoradiography.In Vitro Expression of Protein—In vitro [35S]methionine-labeled protein was prepared by coupled transcription-translation with a Promega TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate kit (Promega, Madison, WI) using 1 μg of Smad4 expression plasmid DNA in a total of 50 μl. GST, GST-DACH1 DS/EYAD, GST-DACH1 DS, and GST-DACH1 EYAD/C-end were expressed in E. coli BL21 DE3 and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B. In vitro protein-protein interactions were performed as described (36Fu M. Wang C. Reutens A.T. Angelletti R. Siconolfi-Baez L. Ogryzko V. Avantaggiati M.L. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20853-20860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The in vitro translated protein (45 μl of Smad4) and 5 μg of purified GST protein were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads in binding buffer at 4 °C for 6 h and then washed five times; 50 μl of binding buffer and 10 μl of 6× SDS loading buffer were added after the final wash; and the samples were denatured at 95 °C and subjected to electrophoresis on 8% SDS-polyacrymide gel. The gel was fixed and incubated with Amplifier (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min to enhance the signal and dried for 1 h at 80 °C, and autoradiography was performed at –80 °C.Subcellular Localization of DACH1 and NCoR—Subcellular localization of DACH1 and NCoR was essentially examined as described (28Normura T. Khan M. Kaul S.C. Dong H. Wadhwa R. Colmenares C. Kohno I. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). A mixture of 1.5 μg of FLAG-NCoR expression plasmid and 1 μg of the plasmid encoding DACH1 was transfected into HaCaT cells. Forty hours after transfection, cells were fixed and stained with anti-FLAG polyclonal antibodies (Sigma) and the anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The DACH1 and NCoR signals were visualized by Cy3- and FITC-conjugated donkey anti-secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch), respectively, and analyzed by confocal microscopy.RESULTSDACH1 Represses TGF-β Signaling—The amino acid sequence of Dachshund has significant homology with the Ski and Sno family of proto-oncogenes, greatest in the region of DACH box-N (DS domain) (28% sequence identity with the vertebrate Ski and Sno proteins) (Fig. 1A). This domain of Ski has been implicated in transformation and the induction of myogenesis. Additional weak homology is found between DACH box-C and the C-terminal domain of the Ski/Sno proteins, which are believed to share an α-helical structure capable of forming coiled-coil structures upon homodimerization (Fig. 1A) (14Hammond K.L. Hanson I.M. Brown A.G. Lettice L.A. Hill R.E. Mech. Dev. 1998; 74: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To examine the role of the DACH1 DS domain in DACH1 function, expression constructions encoding full-length DACH1, a DS domain-deleted mutant (ΔDS), and the DS domain alone (DS) were assessed in cultured cells. Western blot analysis demonstrated that all three constructs were expressed well using either the anti-FLAG antibody or an antibody to the DACH1 DS domain. The DACH1 antibody (see “Materials and Methods”) showed no cross-immunoreactivity with Ski (Fig. 1C). Immunohistochemical study was performed of the murine 15.5-day embryo. Consistent with previous observations (20Ayres J.A. Shum L. Akarsu A.N. Dashner R. Takahashi K. Ikura T. Slavkin H.C. Nuckolls G.H. Genomics. 2001; 77: 18-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), DACH1 immunoreactivity was identified within cells of the cochlea duct and retinal epithelial cells with some staining of the overlying ectoderm (Fig. 1D). Western blot analysis was conducted with the DACH1 antibody of several TGF-β-responsive cell lines, including MCF10A, MDA-MB-231, and Panc-1 cells. A 97-kDa band corresponding to DACH1 was identified in each cell line. 293T cells transfected with the DACH1 expression vector demonstrated a band of identical molecular weight (Fig. 1E). Thus, DACH1 is expressed in human breast cancer and a pancreatic cancer cell line.Since the Sno and Ski proteins regulate TGF-β signaling (10Xu W. Angelis K. Danielpour D. Haddad M.M. Bischof O. Campisi J. Stavnezer E. Medrano E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5924-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), we assessed the role for DACH1 in this pathway. TGF-β increased activity of both the AP-1-responsive reporter 3TP Lux (38Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar) and an artificial promoter containing the Smad-binding elements (SBE-4 Luc). TGF-β induced reporter activity in the human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT (Fig. 2A). Coexpression of Ski or Sno repressed TGF-β-induced activity of both reporters (Fig. 2B), consistent with previous studies (8Sun Y. Liu X. Eaton E.N. Lane W.S. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.A. Mol.

To investigate the role of DACH1 in TGF-β signaling, DACH1 expression constructs were assessed for activity on the 3TP Lux and SBE-4 Luc reporter genes. DACH1 repressed both reporters in HaCaT cells.

https://openalex.org/W2093205075,"Carbon monoxide (CO) is a putative gaseous neurotransmitter that lacks vesicular storage and must be synthesized rapidly following neuronal depolarization. We show that the biosynthetic enzyme for CO, heme oxygenase-2 (HO2), is activated during neuronal stimulation by phosphorylation by CK2 (formerly casein kinase 2). Phorbol ester treatment of hippocampal cultures results in the phosphorylation and activation of HO2 by CK2, implicating protein kinase C (PKC) in CK2 stimulation. Odorant treatment of olfactory receptor neurons augments HO2 phosphorylation and activity as well as cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels, with all of these effects selectively blocked by CK2 inhibitors. Likewise, CO-mediated nonadrenergic, noncholinergic (NANC) relaxation of the internal anal sphincter requires CK2 activity. Our findings provide a molecular mechanism for the rapid neuronal activation of CO biosynthesis, as required for a gaseous neurotransmitter."
https://openalex.org/W1969096046,Arecibo radar observations of Titan at 13-centimeter wavelength indicate that most of the echo power is in a diffusely scattered component but that a small specular component is present for about 75% of the subearth locations observed. These specular echoes have properties consistent with those expected for areas of liquid hydrocarbons. Knowledge of the areal extent and depth of any deposits of liquid hydrocarbons could strongly constrain the history of Titan's atmosphere and surface.
https://openalex.org/W2098569746,"Structural comparison of three different haloalkane dehalogenases suggested that substrate specificity of these bacterial enzymes could be significantly influenced by the size and shape of their entrance tunnels. The surface residue leucine 177 positioned at the tunnel opening of the haloalkane dehalogenase from Sphingomonas paucimobilis UT26 was selected for modification based on structural and phylogenetic analysis; the residue partially blocks the entrance tunnel, and it is the most variable pocket residue in haloalkane dehalogenase-like proteins with nine substitutions in 14 proteins. Mutant genes coding for proteins carrying all possible substitutions in position 177 were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. In total, 15 active protein variants were obtained, suggesting a relatively high tolerance of the site for the introduction of mutations. Purified protein variants were kinetically characterized by determination of specific activities with 12 halogenated substrates and steady-state kinetic parameters with two substrates. The effect of mutation on the enzyme activities varied dramatically with the structure of the substrates, suggesting that extrapolation of one substrate to another may be misleading and that a systematic characterization of the protein variants with a number of substrates is essential. Multivariate analysis of activity data revealed that catalytic activity of mutant enzymes generally increased with the introduction of small and nonpolar amino acid in position 177. This result is consistent with the phylogenetic analysis showing that glycine and alanine are the most commonly occurring amino acids in this position among haloalkane dehalogenases. The study demonstrates the advantages of using rational engineering to develop enzymes with modified catalytic properties and substrate specificities. The strategy of using site-directed mutagenesis to modify a specific entrance tunnel residue identified by structural and phylogenetic analyses, rather than combinatorial screening, generated a high percentage of viable mutants.

Haloalkane dehalogenases are microbial enzymes acting on haloorganic compounds. The enzymes cleaves the carbon-halogen bond and replaces a halogen with a hydroxyl group from a water molecule (1Janssen D.B. Pries F. Van der Ploeg J.R. Annu. Rev.

Microbiol. 1997; 63: 3707-3710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is the enzyme isolated from a γ-hexachlorocyclohexane-degrading bacterium Sphingomonas paucimobilis UT26 (26Nagata Y. Miyauchi K. Takagi M. J. Industrial Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 23: 380-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The LinB enzyme catalyzes conversion of 1,3,4,6-tetrachloro-1,4-cyclohexadiene to 2,5-dichloro-2,5-cyclohexadiene-1,4-diol via 2,4,5-trichloro-2,5-cyclohexadien-1-ol. LinB has broad substrate specificity, and in addition to cyclic dienes, it also converts halogenated alkanes, cycloalkanes, alkenes, ethers, and alcohols (27Damborsky J. Rorije E. Jesenska A. Nagata Y. Klopman G. Peijnenburg W.J.G.M. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2001; 20: 2681-2689PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structures of three different haloalkane dehalogenases, i.e. DhlA from Xanthobacter autotrophicus GJ10, DhaA from Rhodococcus sp., and LinB from S. paucimobilis UT26 have been determined (28Verschueren K.H.G.

A comparison of these structures revealed that not only are the size, shape, and physicochemical properties of the active site important determinants of specificity but also the size and shape of the entrance tunnel (30Marek J.

In this study we attempted to modify the specificity of haloalkane dehalogenase LinB by engineering of the tunnel connecting the protein surface with its active site cavity. Amino acid residue Leu177, which is positioned in the tunnel opening (see Fig. 1), was replaced, and the effect of the mutation on enzyme activity and specificity was studied. Sequence Analysis—Retrieval and multiple alignment of protein sequences of biochemically characterized and putative haloalkane dehalogenases has been published (31Jesenska A. Bartos M. Czernekova V. Rychlik I. Pavlik I. Damborsky J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 3724-3730Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In brief, the sequences of putative haloalkane dehalogenases were identified by iterative searches of nonredundant databases using PSI-BLAST algorithm (32Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59933) Google Scholar) and BLOSUM62 substitution matrix. The protein sequences of known haloalkane dehalogenases served as the query sequences. Top scoring sequences were downloaded from the SWISS-PROT data base and aligned using CLUSTALX v1.8 (33Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55767) Google Scholar) with manual refinement.

The molecular surface of the active site pocket was calculated in the program Python Molecule Viewer 1.0 (Scripps Research Institute) using the probe radius 1.4 Å. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutagenesis of LinB was performed using three different methods. The plasmid pULBH6 (34Nagata Y. Hynkova K. Damborsky J. Takagi M.

The first method used the principle of long and accurate PCR in vitro mutagenesis kit (TaKaRa Shuzo Co., Kyoto, Japan) according to the manufacturer's protocol provided, except for using Pyrobest DNA polymerase (TaKaRa Shuzo Co.) or expand high fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science). Seven LinB mutants (L177A, L177C, L177F, L177G, L177K, L177T, and L177Y) were constructed using this technique. In the second strategy, two parts of the linB gene were amplified independently by PCR. One fragment was amplified with the M13 primer RV (5′-CAG GAA ACA GCT ATG AC-3′) and the oligonucleotide carrying a mutation in the position 177 (see below), whereas the second fragment was amplified using the M13 primer M4 (5′-GTT TTC CCA GTC ACG AC-3′) and oligonucleotide (5′-CCC TTA AGC GAA GCG GAG-3′). Both fragments were purified by the gel extraction kit (Qiagen), treated with T4-polynucleotide kinase (TaKaRa Shuzo Co.) and ligated. Full-length genes were amplified with M13 primers RV and M4, digested with appropriate restriction enzymes, and cloned in pUC18 vector. This principle was used to construct LinB mutants L177P, L177R, L177S, and L177V. The remaining mutants were constructed by invert PCR with oligonucleotides (5′-GCG CAG GAT SNN TCC GGG GAG-3′ and 5′-AAC TTG TTC GAC AAA AAC-3′). The resulting PCR product of about 3.2 bp was treated with DpnI restriction endonuclease to remove template plasmid prepared from Escherichia coli. The product was treated with T4-polynucleotide kinase, self-ligated, and transformed into E. coli DH5α. Nucleotide sequences of all the mutants were confirmed by the dideoxy-chain terminated method with an automated DNA sequencer ABI PRISM™ 310 (Applied Biosystems). The oligonucleotides that were used to introduce mutation in position 177 are as follows: L177A (5′-GCG CAG GAT CGC TCC GGG GAG-3′), L177C (5′-GCG CAG GAT ACA TCC GGG GAG-3′), L177D (5′-GCG CAG GAT GTC TCC GGG GAG-3′), L177F (5′-GCG CAG GAT GAA TCC GGG GAG-3′), L177G (5′-GCG CAG GAT CCC TCC GGG GAG-3′), L177H (5′-GCG CAG GAT GTG TCC GGG GAG-3′), L177I (5′-GCG CAG GAT GAT TCC GGG GAG-3′), L177K (5′-GCG CAG GAT CTT TCC GGG GAG-3′), L177W (5′-GCG CAG GAT CCA TCC GGG GAG-3′), L177Y (5′-GCG CAG GAT GTA TCC GGG GAG-3′), L177E, L177M, L177N, L177P, L177Q, L177R, L177S, L177T, and L177V (5′-GCG CAG GAT SNN TCC GGG GAG-3′). Overexpression and Purification—To overproduce LinB mutants in E. coli, mutant LinB genes were cloned in pAQN vector, and the genes were transcribed by the tac promoter (P tac) under the control of lacIq. E. coli BL21(DE3) containing these plasmids were cultured in 1 liter of Luria broth. When the culture reached an optical density of 0.6 at 600 nm, the induction of enzyme expression (at 30 °C) was initiated by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. The cells were harvested and disrupted by sonication using a Soniprep 150 (Sanyo Gallenkamp PLC, Loughborough, UK). The supernatant was used after centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The crude extract was further purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose column HR 16/10 (Qiagen). The His-tagged LinB (34Nagata Y. Hynkova K. Damborsky J. Takagi M. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 17: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) was bound to the resin in the equilibrating buffer (20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 m sodium chloride and 10 mm imidazole). Unbound and weakly bound proteins were washed out by the buffer containing 45 mm imidazole. The His-tagged enzyme was then eluted by the buffer containing 160 mm imidazole. The active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) overnight. The enzyme was stored in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 10% glycerol and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Circular Dichroism Spectra—Circular dichroism spectra were recorded using a Jasco J-810 spectrometer (Jasco). The data were collected at room temperature from 190 to 260 nm using a 0.1-cm quartz cuvette containing 0.3 mg/ml of dehalogenase in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). Each spectrum was corrected for absorbance caused by the buffer. The CD data were expressed in terms of the mean residue ellipticity (ΘMRE) using the equation,ΘMRE=(Θobs·Mw·100)n·c·l(Eq. 1) where Θobs is the observed ellipticity in degrees, Mw is the protein molecular weight of LinB protein (33105 g/mol), n is the number of residues in LinB protein (296), l is the cell path length (0.1 cm), c is the protein concentration (0.3 mg/ml), and the factor 100 originates from the conversion of the molecular weight to mg/dmol. Specific Activity Measurements—Specific activities of LinB with 12 different halogenated substrates: 1-chlorobutane, 1-chlorohexane, 1-bromobutane, 1-iodobutane, 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,2-dibromoethane, 1,3-diiodopropane, 1,2-dichloropropane, 1,2,3-trichloropropane, chlorocyclohexane, bromocyclohexane, and 3-chloro-2-methylpropene were assessed by determination of the substrate and product concentrations using the gas chromatograph Trace GC 2000 (Finnigen, San Jose, CA) equipped with a flame ionization detector and the capillary column DB-FFAP 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm (J & W Scientific). The reaction was conducted in 25-ml Reacti-Flasks closed by Mininert Valves. The enzymatic reaction was initiated by adding 200 μl of enzyme solution (0.004 mg/ml) into 10 ml of substrate solution (6.4 μl of halogenated compound dissolved in a glycine buffer, pH 8.6). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C and analyzed. The progress of the reaction was monitored by withdrawing 0.5-ml samples at 0, 10, 20, 30, and 60 min using a syringe needle to reduce evaporation of the substrate from the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture samples were mixed with 0.5 ml of methanol to terminate the reaction. The reaction mixture without enzyme served as an abiotic control. Steady-state Kinetics Measurements—Steady-state kinetic constants of LinB mutants with two substrates, 1-chlorobutane and 1,2-dibromoethane, were assessed by determination of the substrate and product concentrations using the gas chromatograph Trace GC 2000 (Finnigen) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a capillary column DB-FFAP 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm (J & W Scientific). Dehalogenation reaction was performed at 37 °C in 25-ml Reacti-Flasks closed by Mininert Valves in a shaking water bath. The reaction mixture consisted of enzyme preparation (0.004 mg/ml) and varied concentrations of substrate (0.01–5 mm for 1-chlorobutane and 0.1–20 mm for 1,2-dichloroethane). The reaction was stopped by the addition of methanol at three different time points (0, 10, and 20 min). All of the data points were measured in triplicate. The steady-state kinetics constants (kcat, Km, and Ksi) were calculated using the computer program EZ-Fit version 1.1. Multivariate Data Analysis—Changes in substrate specificities caused by mutations were analyzed by the principal component analysis (PCA), 1The abbreviations used are: PCAprincipal component analysiswtwild type. which is a data analysis method intended to extract and visualize systematic patterns or trends in large data matrices (35Wold S. Esbensen K. Geladi P. Chemometrics Intelligent Lab. Syst. 1987; 2: 37-52Crossref Scopus (8162) Google Scholar). The goal of PCA is to represent a multivariate data table as a low dimensional plane, usually consisting of two to five dimensions, such that an overview of the data is obtained. This overview may reveal groups of observations, trends, and outliers and also serves to uncover relationships between observations (proteins, in this case) and variables (activities). Mathematically, PCA corresponds to a factorization of the multivariate data matrix X as the product of two smaller matrices, T and P′, that store the object scores and variable loadings, respectively. In matrix notation this can be expressed as follows,X=1*x¯+T*P'+E(Eq. 2) where the residual matrix E contains the noise. The analyzed data matrix consisted of 17 proteins (wt1, L177A, L177C, L177G, L177F, L177K, L177T, and L177W from the first set and wt2, L177D, L177H, L177M, L177Q, L177R, L177S, L177V, and L177Y from the second set) and specific activities measured with eight substrates (1-chlorobutane, 1-chlorohexane, 1-bromobutane, 1-iodobutane, 1,2-dibromoethane, 1,3-diiodopropane, bromocyclohexane, and 3-chloro-2-methylpropene). Inactive mutants (L177P and L177I) and the substrates with low or no activity (1,2-dichloroethane, 1,2-dichloropropane, 1,2,3-trichloropropane, and chlorocyclohexane) were excluded from the analysis. The data were centered and scaled to unit variance prior to analysis. The multivariate data analysis was conducted using the statistical package SIMCA P, version 9.0 (Umetrics AB, Umea, Sweden). principal component analysis wild type. Design and Construction of L177 Variants—The amino acid in position 177 was identified as a probable determinant of the substrate specificity of haloalkane dehalogenase LinB by structural analysis and comparison of the primary sequence of LinB with protein sequences of other family members. Leu177 is positioned at the mouth of the largest entrance tunnel leading to the enzyme active site and points directly into the tunnel (Fig. 1). At the same time it is the most variable pocket residue of the haloalkane dehalogenase-like proteins, showing nine different substitutions in 14 proteins (Fig. 2). Seven different amino acid residues Ala, Cys, Phe, Gly, Lys, Thr, and Trp were introduced in the position 177 of LinB by site-directed mutagenesis (hereafter to be referred to as the first set of mutants) to investigate the role of Leu177 on catalytic efficiency and substrate specificity. The protein variants were overexpressed in E. coli, purified to homogeneity, and kinetically characterized. Kinetic data were analyzed using the PCA to establish relationships between the physicochemical properties of the introduced amino acids and catalytic properties of individual protein variants. The low statistical significance of the developed model caused by insufficient variability in the data set led us to construct and characterize the protein variants carrying the rest of the possible substitutions in position 177: Asp, Glu, His, Ile, Met, Asn, Pro, Gln, Arg, Ser, Val, and Tyr (hereafter to be referred to as the second set of mutants). Identification of Incorrectly Folded Protein Variants—All seven protein variants of the first set of mutants could be overexpressed in E. coli and showed activity with the majority of substrates used for characterization. In the second set of mutants, two of 12 protein variants (L177E and L177N) could not be expressed in E. coli in three independent experiments, whereas two other variants (L177I and L177P) did not show activity with any tested substrate. Circular dichroism spectra were therefore recorded for all of the proteins purified in the second set (Fig. 3). The circular dichroism spectra of all of the active mutants were identical to that of wild type with double ellipticity minimum at 210 and 222 nm typical for α-helical content. Significant differences in circular dichroism spectra of both the inactive mutants (L177I and L177P) were found in comparison with wild type LinB, indicating that the mutations had caused unintentional changes in their protein structure. Substrate Specificity of Leu177 Variants—Substrate specificity of constructed mutants was assayed by determination of specific activities with 12 halogenated substrates representing different chemical groups: mono-, di-, and tri-halogenated; chlorinated, brominated, and iodinated; α- and β-substituted; aliphatic and cyclic; and saturated and unsaturated compounds. Three of these substrates, 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,2-dichloropropane, and 1,2,3-trichloropropane, are industrially interesting chemicals toward which the wild type enzyme does not exhibit detectable activity. The specific activities were measured with purified proteins in an excess of substrate (Table I). Simple visual inspection of the data reveals that: (i) without exception, all of the mutants exhibited modified activities compared with the wild type enzyme, (ii) the impact of the mutations on activity toward different substrates was different, and (iii) none of the mutants exhibited activity toward substrates that were not attacked by the wild type enzyme. Systematic exploration of the data was done by the PCA, which was applied to the data matrix of 17 proteins and specific activities measured with eight substrates (for description of data matrix see “Materials and Methods”). The analysis resulted in two biologically interpretable principal components, which explained 63% of the data variance. The first statistically significant component explained 44% of the data variability and sorted the proteins mostly according to the size of the amino acid residue introduced in position 177. The second principal component explained 19% of data variability and sorted the proteins according to the polarity of amino acid residue introduced in position 177 (Fig. 4A). The proteins are ordered according to their overall activity toward selected substrates along the diagonal. The most active proteins (L177A, L177F, and L177M) are positioned in the top right corner, and the least active mutants (L177R, L177D, and L177H) are positioned in the bottom left corner. The overall activity is not a linear function of the size and polarity of the mutated residue. For example, L177F has large and nonpolar residue in the position 177 but is still highly active with most of the substrates. “Outlying” activities of some of the mutants toward certain substrates is obvious from a comparison of the score plot (Fig. 4A) with the loading plot (Fig. 4B). The score and leading plots should be viewed in parallel, when the positions of mutants and their favorite substrates correspond to each other and vice versa. For instance, high activity of L177W (positioned in the top left corner of the score plot) toward 1-chlorobutane (positioned in the top left corner of the loading plot) but lowered activity with almost all other substrates, or exceptionally high activity of L177T, L177S, and L177Q (positioned in the bottom right corner of the score plot) with 1-iodobutane and 1-bromobutane (positioned in the bottom right corner of the loading plot). As expected, the wild type enzymes from the first (wt1) and the second (wt2) set of mutants are positioned close to each other, confirming good homogeneity of both sets of experiments. The substrates are clustered according to their ability to undergo the dehalogenation reaction (Fig. 4B) with at least three obvious clusters: (i) 1-chlorobutane separated clearly from the rest of the substrates, (ii) 1,3-diiodopropane and 3-chloro-2-methylpropane, and (iii) 1-bromobutane and 1-iodobutane. 1-Chlorobutane exhibits a very different dehalogenation pattern compared with other substrates, especially because of its high conversion rates by L177W, low conversion rates by L177C and resistance to dehalogenation by L177T (in two independent experiments; detection limit 0.0005 μmol·s-1·mg-1 of enzyme). On the other hand similar dehalogenation patterns were observed for the pairs, 1-bromobutane and 1-iodobutane (R2 = 0.97, n = 17) and 1,3-diiodopropane and 3-chloro-2-methylpropene (R2 = 0.72, n = 17). Omitting individual groups of substrates from the analysis in a stepwise manner did not alter the model, thereby largely confirming its robustness.Table ISubstrate specificity of purified wild type and mutant haloalkane dehalogenasesRelative activitiesProteinsFirst setSecond setwt1aSpecific activities (in μmol·s-1·mg-1 of enzyme) of the wild type enzyme in the first set of mutants are 0.0338 (1-chlorobutane), 0.0208 (1-chlorohexane), 0.0633 (1-bromobutane), 0.0104 (1-iodobutane), 0.2200 (1,2-dibromoethane), 0.0463 (1,3-diiodopropane), 0.0018 (chlorocyclohexane), 0.0201 (bromocyclohexane), and 0.1366 (3-chloro-2-methylpropene).L177AL177CL177GL177FL177KL177TL177Wwt2bSpecific activities (in μmol·s-1·mg-1 of enzyme) of the wild type enzyme in the second set of mutants are 0.0287 (1-chlorobutane), 0.0315 (1-chlorohexane), 0.0477 (1-bromobutane), 0.0408 (1-iodobutane), 0.1894 (1,2-dibromoethane), 0.0262 (1,3-diiodopropane), 0.0034 (chlorocyclohexane), 0.0336 (bromocyclohexane), and 0.1312 (3-chloro-2-methylpropene).L177DL177HL177IL177ML177PL177QL177RL177SL177VL177Y% of wt1-Chlorobutane100142379422961—c—, activity not detectable.13810010456—c—, activity not detectable.144—c—, activity not detectable.54466074551-Chlorohexane100106179125215100143891004475—c—, activity not detectable.162—c—, activity not detectable.1653110480801-Bromobutane10035624338024320155360100347224—c—, activity not detectable.227—c—, a"
https://openalex.org/W2027749726,"In vivo, thalamocortical axons are susceptible to the generation of terminal spikes which antidromically promote bursting in the thalamus. Although neurotransmitters could elicit such ectopic action potentials at thalamocortical boutons, this hypothesis has never been confirmed. Prefrontal cortex is the cortical area most implicated in arousal and is innervated by thalamic neurons that are unusual since they burst rhythmically during waking. We show that a neurotransmitter critical for alertness, hypocretin (orexin), directly excites prefrontal thalamocortical synapses in acute slice. This TTX-sensitive activation of thalamic axons was demonstrated electrophysiologically and by two-photon sampling of calcium transients at single spines in apposition to thalamic boutons anterogradely labeled in vivo. Spines receiving these long-range projections constituted a unique population in terms of the presynaptic excitatory action of hypocretin. By this mechanism, the hypocretin projection to prefrontal cortex may play a larger role in prefrontal or “executive” aspects of alertness and attention than previously anticipated."

Chromatin is an important component of Tup1-Ssn6-mediated repression. Tup1 binds to underacetylated histone tails and requires multiple histone deacetylases (HDACs) for its repressive functions. Here, we describe physical interactions of the corepressor complex with the class I HDACs Rpd3, Hos2, and Hos1. In contrast, no in vivo interaction was observed between Tup-Ssn6 and Hda1, a class II HDAC. We demonstrate that Rpd3 interacts with both Tup1 and Ssn6. Rpd3 and Hos2 interact with Ssn6 independently of Tup1 via distinct tetratricopeptide domains within Ssn6, suggesting that these two HDACs may contact the corepressor at the same time.

The Tup1-Ssn6 corepressor complex mediates repression of a large and diverse set of genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (reviewed in Ref. 1.Smith R.L. Johnson A.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 325-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Examples of gene classes regulated by this co-repressor complex are genes that are repressed by glucose (e.g. SUC2), genes that respond to hypoxia (e.g. ANB1), genes induced by DNA damage (e.g. RNR2), and cell type-specific genes (e.g. STE6). Tup1-Ssn6 does not bind directly to DNA but is recruited to target genes by interactions with DNA-bound repressor proteins. The molecular mechanism by which Tup1-Ssn6 inhibits transcription is not fully understood, but Tup1-Ssn6 probably uses both interactions with chromatin and interactions with the general transcription machinery to achieve repression. Many subunits of the mediator complex that is associated with the C-terminal domain of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II interact both genetically and physically with Tup1-Ssn6 (2.Carlson M.

In this work, we demonstrate that native Tup1-Ssn6 interacts with multiple class I HDACs in vivo. Moreover, we define independent HDAC interaction domains within the complex, suggesting that Tup1-Ssn6 may use several chromatin modifying activities to repress target genes. Strains—HA-tagged alleles of Rpd3 and Hos2 were generously provided by D. Stillman (University of Utah) (15.Watson A.D. Edmondson D.G. Bone J.R. Mukai Y. Yu Y. Du W. Stillman D.J. Roth S.Y. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2737-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Strain DY5329 contains the RPD3::3xHA LEU2 allele (a C-terminal HA tag), and strain DY5330 contains a HOS2::3xHA LEU2 (a C-terminal HA tag) allele. Hos1 and Hda1 were tagged in this laboratory by the method of B. Schneider et al. (17.Schneider B.L. Seufert W. Steiner B. Yang Q.H. Futcher A.B. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Briefly, a cassette was generated by PCR that contained a 3× HA tag with URA3 flanked by direct repeats with end regions homologous to HOS1 or HDA1. Yeasts were transformed with these cassettes, plated on –Ura medium and screened by PCR for homologous integration at the desired site. Selected colonies were then plated on 5-fluoroorotic acid to select against the URA3 gene, leaving one copy of the direct repeat and the 3× HA tag. Alleles of HOS1 and HDA1 tagged at either the N terminus or the C terminus were constructed. The expression of HA-Hos1 in both strains was equivalent, and we chose to use the C-terminal 3× HA strain (JDY36) in experiments presented here. No expression was detected for HA-Hda1 with a C-terminal tag, but robust expression was observed for the N-terminal tag construct. Thus, the N-terminal 3× HA tagged strain was used for these experiments (JDY42). Kanr gene replacements (18.Guldener U. Heck S. Fielder T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar) were used to create the tup1Δ::Kanr or ssn6Δ::Kanr alleles in DY5329, DY5330, JDY36, and JDY42. Immunoprecipitations—For immunoprecipitations, 200 ml of cells were grown to an A600 of 1.0. Cells were washed once with H2O, resuspended in 8 ml of lysis buffer with protease inhibitors, and frozen dropwise into liquid nitrogen. Cell lysis buffer was composed of 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 125 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 15 mm MgCl2, 15 mm EGTA, and 0.1 to 0.01% Tween 20. The co-immunoprecipitation experiments with Hos1 (Fig. 1B) and Rpd3 (Fig. 2, A and B) used cell lysis buffer with 0.1% Tween 20. All other experiments were done with 0.01% Tween 20. The frozen pellets were then transferred to a coffee grinder with dry ice and ground (19.Peterson S.E. Stellwagen A.E. Diede S.J. Singer M.S. Haimberger Z.W. Johnson C.O. Tzoneva M. Gottschling D.E.

After the powder was thawed and centrifuged, 1 ml of the clarified supernatant was used for each immunoprecipitation. To immunoprecipitate Tup1 or Ssn6, 10 μl of anti-Tup1 (this laboratory) or anti-Sss6 (this laboratory) were prebound to 50 μl of a 50% solution of protein A-agarose beads that had been prewashed with cell lysis buffer as above. Following the prebinding, the beads were washed two times with cell lysis buffer and then used for immunoprecipitations that were performed overnight at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitations with anti-HA and anti-V5, 2 μl of anti-V5 (Invitrogen) or anti-HA (12CA5, 5 mg/ml; Roche Applied Science) were used. The antibodies were mixed with cell lysates overnight, and 20–50 μl of a 50% solution of prewashed protein A-agarose beads were then added and incubated for an additional 2 h. Beads were then collected and washed three times with cell lysis buffer before adding loading buffer, boiling, and loading supernatants on an 8% SDS-PAGE gel.Fig. 2Rpd3 and Hos2 interact with Ssn6 independently of Tup1.A, immunoblot probed for anti-HA of immunoprecipitations (IP) with anti-Ssn6 or preimmune antiserum (pre) in HA-Rpd3 wild type (DY5329), tup1D (DY5329tup1Δ), and ssn6D (DY5329ssn6Δ) strains demonstrates that HA-Rpd3 can interact with Ssn6 in the absence of Tup1. B, immunoblot probed with anti-HA of immunoprecipitations with anti-Tup1 and preimmune serum in the same strains as above demonstrates that HA-Rpd3 also interacts weakly with Tup1 in the absence of Ssn6.

WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Immunoblots were blocked in 5% milk in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). The following dilutions of primary antibody were used in 5% milk in TBST: 1:5,000 for anti-Ssn6, 1:2,500 for anti-Tup1, 1:5,000 for anti-V5 and 1:5,000 for anti-HA. Immunoblots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:25,000 dilution in 5% milk in TBST; Amersham Biosciences) and developed with Super Signal (Pierce). V5-Ssn6 Clones—Fragments of SSN6 were produced by PCR with genomic DNA and cloned into pYC2/CT (Invitrogen). Oligonucleotides used are available on our Web site (www.geocities.com/dentlab_mdacc/). The clones were under the control of the GAL1 promoter and contained a C-terminal V5 epitope tag. The SSN6 fragment within each clone was sequenced to confirm that no additional mutations had occurred. GST Pull-down Assays—GST fusion proteins were purified as in Mukai et al. (37.Mukai Y. Matsuo E. Roth S.Y. Harashima S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 8461-8468Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Yeast whole cell extracts from DY5329 (HA-Rpd3) and DY5330 (HA-Hos2) were prepared as described above for immunoprecipitations. Extracts (250 μl) were incubated with purified GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione beads for 30 min at room temperature. The beads were then washed four times in extraction buffer and resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The GST fusions used were GST-Tup1N (amino acid positions 7–253), GST-Tup1C (amino acid positions 253–713), GST-Ssn6N (amino acid positions 1–398), and GST-Ssn6C (amino acid positions 428–966). To determine whether native Tup1-Ssn6 interacts with particular HDACs, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments. We obtained or constructed strains that contained an insertion of a 3× HA epitope at the endogenous locus of RPD3, HOS1, HOS2, or HDA1. Thus, the tagged proteins are expressed from their natural promoters (Fig. 1A). HA-Rpd3, HA-Hos2, and HA-Hda1 all show robust expression as detected by an immunoblot of cell extracts using an anti-HA antibody. Hos1 is not readily detectable in whole cell extracts but is visible on an immunoblot following immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1B). Insertion of the 3× HA tag at either the N terminus or C terminus of Hos1 showed equivalent low expression of HA-Hos1 (data not shown). HA-Hos1 expression, then, is significantly lower than that of the other HDACs. We have shown previously that HA-Rpd3 co-immunoprecipitates with Tup1-Ssn6, so we looked for interactions between native Tup1-Ssn6 and other HDACs. Immunoprecipitations were performed with anti-HA, anti-Tup1, and anti-Ssn6. We find that both HA-Hos1 and HA-Hos2 immunoprecipitate with Tup1-Ssn6 (Fig. 1, B and C). Antibodies to the HA epitope immunoprecipitated HA-Hos1 and Tup1-Ssn6, as detected using anti-Ssn6 or anti-Tup1 antiserum (Fig. 1B). We did not detect Hos1 in anti-Tup1 or anti-Ssn6 immunoprecipitates. Perhaps recognition of epitopes in Tup1 or Ssn6 by our antibodies to these native proteins interfered with interactions with this HDAC. Given the very low expression level of Hos1 (Fig. 1A), it is also possible that small amounts of Hos1 immunoprecipitated by anti-Tup1 or anti-Ssn6 antibodies would be below the limits of detection of these experiments. The anti-Ssn6 antibody was able to immunoprecipitate HA-Hos2 as well as Tup1 (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, no HA-Hos2 could be detected in anti-Tup1 immunoprecipitates (data not shown), and we were unable to detect Tup1 or Ssn6 in anti-HA immunoprecipitations for Hos2. As above, the ability to detect interactions in these coimmunoprecipitations may be limited by epitope blockage or by the transient nature of the interactions. Finally, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments using strains bearing HA-Hda1, but we were unable to detect any interactions between HA-Hda1 and Tup1-Ssn6 in vivo with any of the antibodies (data not shown). Rpd3 and Hos2 Interact with Ssn6 Independently of Tup1— Next, we asked if Rpd3, Hos2, or Hos1 made contacts with Tup1, Ssn6, or both proteins in the corepressor complex. For these experiments, we disrupted TUP1 or SSN6 in the tagged HDAC stains. Interestingly, HA-Rpd3 interacts well with Ssn6 in the absence of Tup1 but can also interact, albeit more weakly, with Tup1 in the absence of Ssn6 (Fig. 2, A and B). Thus, it appears that HA-Rpd3 contacts both Ssn6 and Tup1. HA-Hos2 also interacted well with Ssn6 in the absence of Tup1 (Fig. 2C). However, since anti-Tup1 does not co-immunoprecipitate HA-Hos2, we could not address whether Tup1 interacts independently with HA-Hos2. For HA-Hos1, we were unable to detect an interaction in the absence of either Tup1 or Ssn6, suggesting that Hos1 requires both proteins to contact the complex (data not shown). The very low expression level of Hos1, however, confounded these studies, so we did not further map HA-Hos1 interactions with the corepressor. Rpd3 and Hos2 Interact with the N Terminus of Ssn6 in Vitro—To begin mapping the domains of Tup1 and Ssn6 that interact with HA-Rpd3 and HA-Hos2, we performed a GST pull-down experiment (Fig. 3). GST fusions with C-terminal or N-terminal portions of Ssn6 and Tup1 were incubated with extracts from strains bearing HA-Rpd3 or HA-Hos2. HA-Rpd3 interacts with the N terminus of Ssn6 (GST-Ssn6N) and the C terminus of Tup1 (GST-Tup1C). HA-Hos2 interacts with the N terminus of Ssn6 and shows no interaction with the N- or C-terminal regions of Tup1. We observed no binding of HA-Rpd3 or HA-Hos2 to GST alone (data not shown). Rpd3 and Hos2 Interact with the TPR Domain of Ssn6 — Since both HA-Hos2 and HA-Rpd3 interact with the N terminus of Ssn6, we mapped the domains of Ssn6 that interact with these HDACs. The N terminus of Ssn6 contains 10 TPR repeats, a protein-protein interaction motif. This region has been shown previously to contact DNA-bound repressor proteins. Moreover, Tzamarias and Struhl (20.Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) showed that different classes of Tup1-Ssn6-regulated genes require different TPR domains for repression. We patterned our clones after those used in these earlier studies (20.Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Our constructs contain a V5 epitope on the C terminus and are under the control of the GAL1 promoter. A diagram of these V5-Ssn6 fusion clones and their expression levels in galactose is shown in Fig. 4. To avoid interference from native Ssn6, these experiments were all done in ssn6Δ strains. HA-tagged HDACs coimmunoprecipitated by anti-V5 antiserum were detected with anti-HA immunoblots (Fig. 5).Fig. 5HA-Rpd3 and HA-Hos2 interact distinctly with the V5-Ssn6 deletion derivatives.A, immunoblot probed with anti-HA (HA-Rpd3) of immunoprecipitations with anti-V5 (V5-Ssn6) shows that HA-Rpd3 interacts with the full-length (FL), 597, and TPR constructs. B, immunoblot probed with anti-HA (HA-Hos2) of immunoprecipitations with anti-V5 (V5-Ssn6) shows that HA-Hos2 interacts with the full-length, 597, TPR, 351, 300, and 79–300 constructs. C, immunoblot probed with anti-HA (HA-Hda1) of immunoprecipitations with anti-V5 (V5-Ssn6) shows no evidence of an interaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) HA-Rpd3 interacts with the TPR domain of Ssn6, and this interaction appears to require the entire TPR domain (Fig. 5A). HA-Rpd3 did not interact with any construct deleted for any of the TPR repeats. HA-Hos2 also interacted with the TPR domain, but, in contrast to HA-Rpd3, HA-Hos2 interacted quite well with a construct that only contains TPRs 2–7 (Fig. 5B). Thus, HA-Hos2 does not require TPR 1, 8, 9, or 10 for interaction. Interestingly, the construct that contains only TPRs 2–7 deletes the Tup1 interaction domain, consistent with our finding above that Tup1 is not required for Hos2 interactions with Ssn6. Similar experiments under these conditions were also done using strains expressing HA-Hda1 (Fig. 5C). No interaction was observed between HA-Hda1 and any Ssn6 construct, consistent with the lack of coimmunoprecipitation of HA-Hda1 with the native Tup1-Ssn6 complex. We did note that expression of HA-Hda1 was lowered in Δssn6 cells, but sufficient levels of HA-Hda1 were present in the cell to allow detection of an interaction had one occurred under these conditions (see extract lane, Fig. 5C). Tup1-Ssn6 utilizes histone deacetylases and histone contacts to mediate repression. The details of this repression mechanism are not understood but are fundamental to understanding corepressor functions. We have shown previously that simultaneous loss of RPD3, HOS1, and HOS2 leads to complete derepression of Tup1-Ssn6-regulated genes (15.Watson A.D. Edmondson D.G. Bone J.R. Mukai Y. Yu Y. Du W. Stillman D.J. Roth S.Y. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2737-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This mutant combination also increases the acetylation at Tup1-Ssn6-regulated genes (15.Watson A.D. Edmondson D.G. Bone J.R. Mukai Y. Yu Y. Du W. Stillman D.J. Roth S.Y. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2737-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and severely inhibits the cross-linking of Tup1 to target genes (14.Davie J.K. Trumbly R.J. Dent S.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Each individual HDAC mutation has only minor effects on repression. The greater effects of the combined HDAC mutations might reflect overlaps in the substrate specificities of these enzymes. Alternatively, they might reflect the ability of the corepressor to interact with and utilize multiple chromatin remodeling activities to tailor gene-specific repressive architectures. In support of this idea, we demonstrate here that each of the class I HDACs genetically determined to be important for Tup1-Ssn6 functions interacts with native Tup1-Ssn6 in vivo. In previous studies, we also observed a modest degree of derepression of an a cell-specific reporter gene in hda1 mutant cells (21.Edmondson D.G. Zhang W. Watson A. Xu W. Bone J.R. Yu Y. Stillman D. Roth S.Y. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), consistent with the findings of Wu et al. (16.Wu J. Suka N. Carlson M. Grunstein M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 117-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) that indicate Hda1 is important to some Tup1-Ssn6 functions. However, the effects of HDA1 mutation on repression of the reporter gene, endogenous a cell-specific genes, or SUC2 were much smaller that those of the combined mutations in RPD3, HOS1 and HOS2 (15.Watson A.D. Edmondson D.G. Bone J.R. Mukai Y. Yu Y. Du W. Stillman D.J. Roth S.Y. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2737-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 21.Edmondson D.G. Zhang W. Watson A. Xu W. Bone J.R. Yu Y. Stillman D. Roth S.Y. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Furthermore, no greater loss of repression was observed upon combination of HDA1 mutations with mutations in other HDACS, in contrast to the synergistic effects of RPD3, HOS1, and HOS2 mutations on repression. These results indicate that Hda1 is less important than the class I HDACs in the repression of a cell-specific genes or SUC2. Hda1 may play a more dominant role in repression of other Tup1-Ssn6 target genes, such as ENA1 or genes located in the HAST (Hda1-associated subtelomeric) domains defined by the Grunstein laboratory (16.Wu J. Suka N. Carlson M. Grunstein M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 117-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 22.Robyr D. Suka Y. Xenarios I. Kurdistani S.K. Wang A. Suka N. Grunstein M. Cell. 2002; 109: 437-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Indeed, at ENA1, a similar pattern of changes in histone deacetylation is observed in hda1Δ cells and tup1Δ cells (16.Wu J. Suka N. Carlson M. Grunstein M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 117-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Whereas in vitro translated Hda1 interacts with GST-Tup1 in vitro (16.Wu J. Suka N. Carlson M. Grunstein M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 117-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), we do not detect any interaction between this HDAC and the corepressor in vivo, implying that such an interaction might be much more transient than interactions between Tup1-Ssn6 and the class I HDACs. In contrast, our data demonstrate that Rpd3 and Hos2 interact strongly with Tup1-Ssn6 in vivo. Interestingly, Wu et al. (16.Wu J. Suka N. Carlson M. Grunstein M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 117-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) observed increased histone acetylation in the coding region of ENA1 in rpd3Δ cells, whereas increased acetylation was observed in the ENA1 promoter region in tup1Δ cells and hda1Δ cells. Since Tup1-Ssn6 is probably recruited to the promoter region of this gene to initiate repression, these data again suggest a link between Tup1-Ssn6 functions and Hda1 at this gene. Different patterns of changes in histone deacetylation have been observed at different Tup1-Ssn6 targets (13.Deckert J. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2726-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 15.Watson A.D. Edmondson D.G. Bone J.R. Mukai Y. Yu Y. Du W. Stillman D.J. Roth S.Y. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2737-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 16.Wu J. Suka N. Carlson M. Grunstein M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 117-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), suggesting that the corepressor may utilize different combinations of activities to repress different genes and that the effects of the corepressor may reach beyond the promoter region in some cases (14.Davie J.K. Trumbly R.J. Dent S.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 23.Ducker C.E. Simpson R.T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 400-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The interactions we observe between Hos2 and Tup1-Ssn6 are particularly interesting, because Hos2 functions are correlated with transcriptional activation (24.Wang A. Kurdistani S.K. Grunstein M. Science. 2002; 298: 1412-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Genome-wide location studies indicate that Hos2 cross-links to the coding regions of active genes (24.Wang A. Kurdistani S.K. Grunstein M. Science. 2002; 298: 1412-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). These results are somewhat counterintuitive, since HDAC functions and decreases in histone acetylation are usually correlated with gene repression. Of course, deacetylation of a particular histone at a specific site might facilitate transcription, or Hos2-mediated deacetylation of a nonhistone target may be important to gene activation. In either case, interaction of Tup1-Ssn6 with Hos2 might interfere with such functions to inhibit gene expression. However, Tup1-Ssn6 participates in the activation of some genes (25.Papamichos-Chronakis M. Petrakis T. Ktistaki E. Topalidou I. Tzamarias D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1297-1305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 26.Proft M. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1307-1317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that Ssn6-Hos2 interactions might stimulate rather than inhibit transcription at these targets. Whereas Tup1 is highly enriched at the promoter regions of genes such as RNR2 and STE6 only under conditions of repression (14.Davie J.K. Trumbly R.J. Dent S.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16.Wu J. Suka N. Carlson M. Grunstein M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 117-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 23.Ducker C.E. Simpson R.T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 400-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), Tup1 is enriched at promoter sequences of SUC2 and GRE2 under conditions of both activation and repression (25.Papamichos-Chronakis M. Petrakis T. Ktistaki E. Topalidou I. Tzamarias D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1297-1305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 26.Proft M. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1307-1317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). At GRE2, Tup1 is required for the recruitment of Swi/Snf and SAGA during activation (26.Proft M. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1307-1317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), indicating that it plays a direct role in activation of this gene. Additional studies are needed to determine whether Hos2 or other HDACs co-localize with Tup1 at these genes and, if so, how the interactions impact expression of these genes. Hos2 is part of a complex that contains Set3, a putative methyltransferase (27.Pijnappel W.W. Schaft D. Roguev A. Shevchenko A. Tekotte H. Wilm M. Rigaut G. Seraphin B. Aasland R. Stewart A.F. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2991-3004Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The Set3 complex also contains Hst1, an NAD-dependent deacetylase, and Sif2, a WD repeat protein. At present, we do not know if Tup1-Ssn6 interacts with this complex or with Hos2 alone. Interestingly, the Set3 complex is suggested to be the S. cerevisiae homolog of SMRT and N-CoR (27.Pijnappel W.W. Schaft D. Roguev A. Shevchenko A. Tekotte H. Wilm M. Rigaut G. Seraphin B. Aasland R. Stewart A.F. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2991-3004Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). SMRT-N-CoR complexes also contain WD repeat proteins, TBL and TBLR1. Like Tup1, the TBL proteins interact with histones (28.Yoon H.G. Chan D.W. Huang Z.Q. Li J. Fondell J.D. Qin J. Wong J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1336-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). N-CoR and SMRT contain numerous repression domains and have been reported to interact with the mSin3A-HDAC1/2 complex as well as HDACs 3–7 (29.Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Mullen T.M. Soderstrom M.

However, when N-CoR or SMRT complexes are biochemically purified, the only histone deacetylase stably associated with the complex is HDAC3, a class I HDAC (33.Guenther M.G. Lane W.S. Fischle W. Verdin E. Lazar M.A. Shiekhattar R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1048-1057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Li J. Wang J. Nawaz Z. Liu J.M. Qin J. Wong J.

A. 2000; 97: 7202-7207Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). HDAC4, a class II HDAC, also associates with the complex, but mutations in the HDAC4 catalytic site do not affect the HDAC activity of the complex, whereas mutations in HDAC3 abolish the activity of the complex (36.Fischle W. Dequiedt F. Hendzel M.J. Guenther M.G. Lazar M.A. Voelter W. Verdin E. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 45-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). These data indicate either that HDAC4 is not active in the complex or that HDAC3 is required to activate HDAC4. It will be interesting to determine whether isolated Tup1-Ssn6 complexes purified from yeast are associated with both class I and class II HDACs and, if so, whether both are active in the context of this corepressor. Dissecting the nature of Tup1-Ssn6-HDAC interactions in vitro and understanding how Tup1-Ssn6 utilizes specific HDACs to repress target genes in vivo will greatly increase our understanding of corepressor functions.

Here, we used HeLa cells stably expressing a tetracycline-regulated dominant-negative dynamin I (dyn K44A), which selectively inhibits receptor-mediated endocytosis, and analyzed the effects on the processing of endogenous APP. Upon induction of dyn K44A, levels of mature APP rose at the cell surface, consistent with retention of APP on the plasma membrane. The α-secretase cleavage products of APP were increased by dyn K44A, in that α-APPs in medium and the C83 C-terminal stub in the membrane both rose. The β-secretase cleavage of APP, C99, also increased modestly. The use of specific γ-secretase inhibitors to study the accumulation of α- and β-cleavage products independent of their processing by γ-secretase confirmed that retention of APP on the plasma membrane results in increased processing by both α- and β-secretases. Unexpectedly, endogenous Aβ secretion was significantly increased by dyn K44A, as detected by three distinct methods: metabolic labeling, immunoprecipitation/Western blotting, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Levels of p3 (generated by sequential α- and γ-cleavage) also rose. We conclude that endogenous Aβ can be produced directly at the plasma membrane and that alterations in the degree of APP endocytosis may help regulate its production.

Sequential cleavage of APP by the aspartyl proteases BACE/β-secretase and presenilin/γ-secretase releases Aβ into the lumen/extracellular space and liberates the APP intracellular domain into the cytoplasm in a process strikingly similar to the cleavage of the Notch receptors that enables their signaling in myriad cell fate decisions (2Esler W.P.

Thus, the processing of APP by RIP, rather than being an anomaly related to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, appears to represent a conserved mechanism employed by cells to communicate information from events at the cell surface to the nucleus. Because the initiation of receptor endoproteolysis and signaling often requires the binding of a cognate ligand located on an adjacent cell (e.g. Delta or Jagged in the case of Notch) or else intercellular adhesion (e.g. in the case of E-cadherin), it is reasonable to hypothesize that APP also undergoes processing at or near the cell surface. Indeed, deletion or mutation of a cytoplasmic YENPTY motif important for the internalization of surface-inserted APP has been reported to sharply reduce Aβ generation (10Haass C. Hung A.Y.

Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, selective labeling of surface APP molecules in living cells leads to the release of labeled Aβ into the medium in a time course consistent with the internalization and endocytic recycling of APP (12Koo E.H. Squazzo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, trypsinization of surface proteins on human brain cells ex vivo leads to a decrease in secreted Aβ (13Jung S.S. Cashman N.R. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 3875-3879Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Other studies suggest a distinct pathway for generating intracellular Aβ. Immunocytochemistry has revealed Aβ in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and ER (14Cook D.G. Forman M.S. Sung J.C. Leight S. Kolson D.L. Iwatsubo T. Lee V.M.Y. Doms R.W. Nat.

Preventing APP from reaching the cell surface by treating NT2N (differentiated NT2 cells) neurons with brefeldin A abrogated Aβ secretion but resulted in its intracellular accumulation (16Chyung A.S.C. Greenberg B.D. Cook D.G. Doms R.W. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Similar results have been obtained in non-neural cells (17Wilde-Bode C. Yamazaki T. Capell A. Leimer U. Steiner H. Ihara Y. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16085-16088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Therefore, available evidence suggests that Aβ can be generated and accumulate in more than one subcellular locus. Whether the principal site of its proteolytic generation relates to the putative function of its precursor as a cell surface receptor is unclear. An approach that could help clarify this issue but has been little exploited in research on APP is to take advantage of dominant-negative mutants of proteins known to mediate endocytosis. Here, we have systematically characterized the effects on APP processing of a well characterized dominant-negative mutation in dynamin I (dyn), K44A (18Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar), that inhibits the internalization of transferrin receptor and certain other surface proteins, which undergo receptor-mediated endocytosis (18Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, 19Altschuler Y. Barbas S.M. Terlecky L.J. Tang K. Hardy S. Mostov K.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1871-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Using a tetracycline-regulated expression system, we find that induction of dyn K44A results in increased retention of endogenous, full-length APP on the plasma membrane and a consequent increase in its processing by α-secretase. Surprisingly, this inhibition of APP endocytosis was associated with more, rather than less, secretion of Aβ into the medium. The increase in the proteolytic turnover of APP held at the plasma membrane occurred in the absence of detectable changes in the levels of α-secretase or presenilin/γ-secretase. We conclude that, in addition to evidence that Aβ can be generated during endosomal recycling, it can be produced from APP directly on the plasma membrane. Our findings are consistent with a critical role for the presenilin/γ-secretase complex in the processing of numerous single-transmembrane proteins at the cell surface. Moreover, our results suggest that β- or γ-secretase inhibitors intended to lower Aβ production may be able to operate principally at the plasma membrane, without the need for full cell penetration. Cell Culture—An HeLa cell line expressing a dominant-negative dynamin I K44A protein under the control of a tetracycline transactivator was obtained from Dr. S. Schmid (Scripps Institute, La Jolla, CA). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 200 μg/ml G418, 200 ng/ml puromycin, and 1 μg/ml tetracycline. Cells were split 1 day prior to dyn K44A induction. On the day of induction, the medium was changed to medium either containing or lacking tetracycline. The medium (with or without tetracycline) was changed again after 30 min. Ten milliliters of fresh medium (again with or without tetracycline) was added at 24 h post-induction, and cells and conditioned media were collected at 48 h. For the γ-secretase inhibitor studies, 1 μm Compound E was applied from 24 to 48 h of induction, and 1 μm DAPT was applied from 48 to 52 h of induction. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). Nuclei were pelleted in an Eppendorf centrifuge (Brinkman Instruments, Inc., Westbury, NY) for 2 min at 14,000 × g. Equal protein amounts, determined using the DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), were analyzed by Western blotting. 10-20% Tris-Tricine gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were used to separate the APP C-terminal fragments, C83 and C99. 10% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) were used to separate full-length APP species. HA-tagged dyn K44A protein was detected with 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Full-length APP was blotted with the N-terminal-specific monoclonal antibody, 22C11 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). C83 was blotted with the C-terminal-specific polyclonal antibody C8, or by C8 immunoprecipitation followed by blotting with monoclonal antibody 13G8 (gift of D. Schenk, Elan Pharmaceuticals, San Francisco, CA). All immunoprecipitated samples were first pre-cleared with protein A-Sepharose (PAS) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). In some experiments, C7, an affinity-purified form of C8, was used. The epitopes for C8 and 13G8 lie in the last 20 amino acids of the APP cytoplasmic domain. C99 was immunoprecipitated with C8 and detected with 6E10 (Signet Laboratories, Inc., Dedham, MA). α-APPs was detected using the polyclonal antibody, 1736, which specifically recognizes the α- but not the β-secretase-generated ectodomain fragment. Tubulin and ribophorin were blotted with antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Aβ was immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibody 1282 and then blotted with 6E10. Biotinylated transferrin (tfn-btn, Sigma-Aldrich) was detected using neutravidin-horseradish peroxidase (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). Surface biotinylated proteins were immunoprecipitated with streptavidin-agarose (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and blotted with 22C11 and a ribophorin antibody. Western blots were developed with Pierce Femto SuperSignal (Pierce). All Western blots shown for APP and its proteolytic products were repeated in at least five independent experiments. Quantitative Western Blotting—Mature and immature APP, C99, and tfn-btn levels were quantified by densitometry using ImageQuaNT software (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Standard curves for APP and C99 were generated by transiently transfecting plasmids encoding APP695 or C99 (Effectene, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and then Western blotting 2-fold serial dilutions of these overexpressed proteins in parallel with experimental samples. Surface-bound and internalized tfn-btn were quantified using a standard curve generated from Western blots of serial 2-fold dilutions of tfn-biotin, in parallel with experimental samples Aβ ELISA. Media were conditioned and collected from 24 to 48 h of dynamin induction or non-induction. 1,10-Phenanthroline (2 mm, Sigma-Aldrich) and Complete protease inhibitor mix were added to the media and spun at 3,000 rpm for 10 min to remove debris in a Marathon 8K centrifuge (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). ELISA for Aβ X-40 was performed as described by Johnson-Wood et al. (20Johnson-Wood K. Lee M. Motter R. Hu K. Gordon G. Barbour R. Khan K. Gordon M. Tan H. Games D. Lieberburg I. Schenk D. Seubert P. MConlogue L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1550-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. 96-well plates were coated with 3 μg/ml 2G3, specific for the Aβ40 C terminus (gift of P. Seubert and D. Schenk, Athena Neurosciences, San Francisco, CA). Standards of Aβ 1-40 were diluted in unconditioned medium. Bound Aβ was detected with biotinylated 266 antibody (0.25 μg/ml), directed to the Aβ13-28 region (gift of P. Seubert and D. Schenk, Elan Pharmaceuticals, San Francisco, CA). Plates were washed two times between antibody incubations with Tris-buffered saline/0.05% Tween 20 for 1 min each, and then 2 min each before developing with tetramethylbenzidine-ELISA (Pierce). Metabolic Labeling—HeLa cells were cultured in medium with or without tetracycline. At 24 h of induction, cells were incubated for 30 min with Cys/Met-free and serum-free medium. Cells were then conditioned in medium with or without tetracycline containing 1 mCi of [35S]Cys, [35S]Met for 24 h. Media were collected and prepared as for ELISA (above). Samples were pre-cleared with PAS. p3 and Aβ were immunoprecipitated with 1282 and PAS. Samples were run on 10-20% Tris-Tricine gels and detected using a E425 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). The time course of APP biosynthesis and maturation was determined by pulse-chase experiments on HeLa cells in 10-cm dishes. After tetracycline induction (or no induction) for 48 h, cells were serum-starved for 30 min and then pulsed with 2 mCi of [35S]Cys plus [35S]Met for 7 min. Cells were washed once briefly with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen) to terminate the pulse, and 5 ml of medium with or without tetracycline was added for the chase. Cell lysates in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing Complete protease inhibitor mix were collected after cold chase times of 0, 10, and 20 min or 0, 30, 60, and 90 min. Nuclei were pelleted at 14,000 rpm for 2 min. 25 μl of lysate from each sample was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid for 20 min at 4 °C, spun at 14,000 rpm for 10 min and resolubilized in 1 ml of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 1% SDS. Incorporation of radiolabel into proteins was measured by adding 40 μl of resolubilized proteins to 4 ml of EcoScint H (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) and counted in a 1212 Rackbeta liquid scintillation counter (LKB Wallac, Gaithersburg, MD). Samples corresponding to equal radioactive counts were diluted to a 1-ml volume in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, pre-cleared with PAS, and immunoprecipitated with C8. Samples were then run on a 4-20% Tris-glycine gel and analyzed using an Amersham Biosciences E425 PhosphorImager. Each radiolabeled blot was repeated twice. Transferrin Uptake Assays—tfn-btn (8 μg/ml) was used to determine the kinetics of tfn uptake. Briefly, HeLa cells induced or non-induced for 24 h in six-well plates were washed three times in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) (Invitrogen), incubated with tfn-btn for 7 min in culture medium, then placed at 4 °C. Remaining surface-bound transferrin-biotin was removed with three brief acid washes in HBSS at pH 4. Surface-bound tfn was determined by incubating cells with tfn-btn at 4 °C for 30 min, then washing three times with HBSS. Cells were lysed in 1%Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing Complete protease inhibitor mix, and nuclei pelleted with at 14,000 rpm for 2 min. Samples were Western blotted as described above for both qualitative and quantitative analysis. Surface Biotinylation—Confluent 10-cm dishes of HeLa cells induced or not induced for 48 h were washed three times with HBSS. Cells were biotinylated with 0.5 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) for 45 min at 4 °C. Biotinylation was quenched with a 100 mm glycine/HBSS wash followed by two HBSS washes. Immunoprecipitation/Western analysis of biotinylated materials was carried out as described above. Surface biotinylated Western blots shown are representative of three independent experiments. Surface Trypsinization—10-cm dishes of HeLa cells were treated as above with or without tetracycline for 44 h. Cells were then washed twice at 4 °C with 1 mm EDTA (Sigma) in HBSS without Ca2+ or Mg2+ (Invitrogen) buffered with 10 mm HEPES (Invitrogen) (1 mm EDTA/HBSS/HEPES). Cells were treated with or without 1 ml of 0.25% trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) in 1 mm EDTA/HBSS/HEPES for 30 min at 4 °C, then quenched with the addition of 1 ml of 0.125% soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich) and 8 ml of culture medium containing fetal bovine serum. Cells were washed three times with HBSS and lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing Complete protease inhibitor mixture. Equal protein was loaded on a 4-20% Tris-glycine gel for tubulin Western blotting. C99 and full-length APP were immunoprecipitated from protein-normalized samples with C8 and detected with 6E10. Surface trypsinization experiments were repeated three times. Induction of Dynamin K44A I Potently Blocks Receptor-mediated Endocytosis—We investigated the role of receptor-mediated endocytosis in the generation of Aβ from APP by utilizing a HeLa cell line stably transfected with a dominant-negative dynamin construct, dyn K44A, under the control of a tetracycline-responsive element. Removing tetracycline from the culture medium for 48 h induces the dominant-negative dynamin and potently inhibits receptor-mediated endocytosis (18Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). We began by verifying the effects of dyn K44A on the internalization of transferrin, which is brought into cells by transferrin receptors through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The effects of dyn K44A on transferrin uptake were quantified as internalized transferrin/surface-bound transferrin/unit time. We allowed cells to internalize biotinylated transferrin for 7 min at 37 °C and then detached the residual surface-bound (non-internalized) transferrin-biotin by repeated acid washes, thus measuring the internalized transferrin. Surface-bound transferrin was measured by binding transferrin-biotin to the plasma membrane at 4 °C and then repeatedly washing with HBSS to remove non-specifically bound transferrin-biotin. As expected, the absence of tetracycline in the culture medium for 48 h led to a strong induction of dyn K44A (Fig. 1A). Following this induction, surface binding of transferrin was increased by ∼68% (Fig. 1B), reflecting an increased retention of transferrin receptor on the plasma membrane. Accordingly, the total bulk uptake of transferrin was decreased by ∼58% when dyn K44A was induced (Fig. 1C). Overall, clathrin-mediated endocytosis (internalized transferrin/surface-bound transferrin/unit time) decreased by 75% when dominant-negative dynamin was induced for 48 h (Fig. 1D). Our results are entirely consistent with previously published findings using the same cell line under similar conditions (18Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar), and they confirm the potent inhibition of receptor-mediated endocytosis by induction of dyn K44A. Expression of Dominant-negative Dynamin Selectively Increases the Level of Mature APP—When dyn K44A was induced, the total cellular levels of mature, N- plus O-glycosylated APP increased robustly, whereas the levels of the immature, N-glycosylated APP were minimally elevated (Fig. 2A). This result suggested that inhibition of dynamin function affected principally the cell surface form of APP, which is fully glycosylated. When we quantified the increase in holoAPP levels, we found that mature APP increased by ∼500% (p < 0.0005), whereas immature APP increased by only 47% (p < 0.0003) (Fig. 2B). As negative controls, we examined the levels of the cytosolic protein, tubulin, and the transmembrane protein, ribophorin, which is retained in the ER. Tubulin and ribophorin levels were unchanged in the presence versus absence of dyn K44A (Fig. 2C); quantitation of the tubulin signal showed no detectable difference (not shown). When we induced the overexpression of dynamin in a tet-off HeLa cell line stably expressing wild-type (WT) dynamin, we found no difference in the levels of full-length APP (data not shown). Because overexpression of WT dynamin exerts a minimal influence on rates of endocytosis (18Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar), we conclude that neither the presence of tetracycline nor the overexpression of WT dynamin increases mature APP levels. These data indicate that the effects of dyn K44A are specific for the dominant-negative dynamin. Furthermore, the dramatic rise in the level of mature APP, ∼10-fold greater than that of immature APP, is consistent with dyn K44A principally affecting APP molecules after they have passed through the secretory pathway, completed glycosylation, and reached the cell surface. Expression of Dominant-negative Dynamin Results in Accumulation of APP on the Plasma Membrane—To confirm that the increase in cellular APP (Fig. 2, A and B) was principally due to retention of APP at the plasma membrane, we biotinylated surface proteins with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin, which is cell-impermeant, for 45 min on ice following the 48-h induction/no induction of dyn K44A. Samples were washed thoroughly with HBSS containing 100 mm glycine as a quenching reagent, precipitated with streptavidin-agarose beads, and Western blotted. As controls for APP migration, straight cell lysates were loaded adjacent to the streptavidin-precipitated samples. The top portion of the membrane was immunoblotted with an antibody against the APP ectodomain (22C11), and the bottom portion with an antibody against ribophorin, a resident ER membrane protein, as a control. We found that after dominant-negative dynamin expression, the mature form of APP was selectively biotinylated, as confirmed by co-migration with mature APP in the straight lysate (Fig. 2D). The levels of ribophorin were again unchanged by dyn K44A induction, and no biotinylation of ribophorin occurred, as expected (Fig. 2E). The increase in plasma membrane holoAPP could be caused by increased surface retention due to the documented inhibition of receptor-mediated endocytosis (Fig. 1) and/or by decreased proteolytic processing of holoAPP due to inhibition of α- and/or β-secretase activity. As shown below, the former is the explanation. Biosynthesis and Maturation of APP Are Not Affected by Dynamin Function—To prove that the effects of dynamin dysfunction on APP trafficking and processing were not due to an effect in the secretory pathway, we performed a pulse-chase analysis. Following a 7-min pulse with 2 mCi of [35S]Cys, [35S]Met, and chase times of 0, 10, and 20 min, we found that the generation of immature APP was not significantly different between dyn K44A induced and non-induced cells (Fig. 2F). In addition, we found that the appearance of fully mature endogenous APP, reflecting the trafficking of APP through the Golgi apparatus, was also unchanged at the earliest detection time of 20 min. We next performed a second pulse-chase experiment with chase times of 0, 30, 60, and 90 min to confirm that labeled APP accumulates at times consistent with its delivery to the cell surface. As expected, the cells with blocked endocytosis showed a selective rise in mature APP levels after the 60- and 90-min chases, time points consistent with the arrival of mature APP at the cell surface, whereas immature APP levels fell equally with or without dyn K44A induction. α-Secretase Cleavage of APP Increases When Dynamin Function Is Down-regulated—α-Secretases cleave APP 12 amino acids in front of its transmembrane domain to release a soluble ectodomain fragment called α-APPs and leave a C-terminal membrane-anchored stub termed C83. Prior studies have implicated both the secretory pathway and the plasma membrane as sites of α-secretase activity. Both ADAM10 and ADAM17 (TACE) have been reported to serve as α-secretases for APP. We first asked if the levels of ADAM10 and TACE were altered when dyn K44A was induced. The levels of mature ADAM10 and TACE were both unchanged (not shown). In addition, we established that the induction of dyn K44A did not alter levels of total cellular presenilin and nicastrin (not shown). Next, we determined the accumulation of secreted α-APPs from 24 to 48 h of dyn K44A induction, compared with uninduced control cultures. α-APPs was specifically detected by antibody 1736, which recognizes the last 16 residues of α-APPs that are not present in β-APPs. In the presence of dominant-negative dynamin, the quantity of α-APPs secreted into the medium was markedly elevated (Fig. 3A). These data support previous results that identified the plasma membrane as a principal site of α-secretase activity (21Sisodia S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6075-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). In accord with the marked rise in α-APPs, the levels of C83 also increased when dynamin function was suppressed (Fig. 3B). By immunoprecipitating and blotting C83 with highly sensitive antibodies (C7 and 13G8, respectively), we could detect a small amount of endogenous C83. When dyn K44A was induced, the levels of C83 rose, in parallel with the strong increase in α-APPs levels. When γ-secretase activity wa"

PheP assembled in a mutant of E. coli lacking phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) exhibited significantly reduced active transport function and a complete inversion in topological orientation of the N terminus and adjoining transmembrane hairpin loop compared with PheP in a PE-containing strain. Introduction of PE following the assembly of PheP triggered a reorientation of the N terminus and adjacent hairpin to their native orientation associated with regain of wild-type transport function. The reversible orientation of these secondary transport proteins in response to a change in phospholipid composition might be a result of inherent conformational flexibility necessary for transport function or during protein assembly.

Although considerable progress has been made in understanding the assembly of multispanning-membrane proteins (1.Bernstein H.D. Bernstein J.M. Reddy M. Curr. Opin.

Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the precise molecular events involved in the insertion, orientation, and proper formation of tertiary and quaternary structures of proteins in the membrane are not well defined. Most investigations have been focused on the role of amino acid sequence in directing the assembly of membrane proteins, whereas only a limited number of reports have addressed the effects of the native lipid environment in determining the correct insertion, folding, and topology of membrane proteins. Therefore, there is currently little understanding of, or ability to predict, how membrane protein topogenesis occurs in a given lipid environment. Whether there are constraints imposed on the topological organization of membrane proteins by phospholipid composition in addition to simply providing an amphipathic environment for maintenance of membrane protein conformation is also not clear. The most compelling evidence for a specific role for lipids in membrane protein topological organization is the requirement for phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) 1The abbreviations used are: PEphosphatidylethanolamineTMtransmembrane domainAMS4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acidMPB(+)-biotinyl,3-maleimidopropionomidyl-3,6-dioxaoctanediaminePhePCys–cysteineless PhePIPTGisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside.1The abbreviations used are: PEphosphatidylethanolamineTMtransmembrane domainAMS4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acidMPB(+)-biotinyl,3-maleimidopropionomidyl-3,6-dioxaoctanediaminePhePCys–cysteineless PhePIPTGisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. for the proper orientation of the 12 transmembrane domains (TMs) of the lactose permease LacY of Escherichia coli (3.Bogdanov M. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2107-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Assembly in the absence of PE results in a topological inversion of the N-terminal six TMs and their associated extramembrane domains. PE is required in a late step of maturation for the proper folding of the periplasmic extramembrane domain (P7) linking TMs VII and VIII (4.Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5255-5264Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Proper folding of this domain is required for active (but not facilitated) transport of LacY substrates (5.Bogdanov M. Sun J. Kaback H.R. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11615-11618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The native topological organization of at least the C6 cytoplasmic domain (connecting TMs VI and VII), the native conformation of the P7 domain, and the active transport function of LacY assembled in vivo in the absence of PE can be restored under the following conditions: post-assembly synthesis of PE in vivo (3.Bogdanov M. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2107-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), addition of PE to isolated membrane vesicles (4.Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5255-5264Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), or reconstitution of purified LacY into liposomes containing PE (6.Wang X. Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5673-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylserine is the only physiological lipid that can substitute for PE. However, in vitro, phosphatidylcholine supports the proper topological organization of proteoliposomal LacY, but not transport or the native conformation of the P7 domain (6.Wang X. Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5673-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 7.Bogdanov M. Umeda M. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12339-12345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The minimum lipid requirement for the native conformation of the P7 domain and the function of LacY is a diacylphospholipid containing an ionizable amine head group organized in a bilayer (7.Bogdanov M. Umeda M. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12339-12345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). phosphatidylethanolamine transmembrane domain 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (+)-biotinyl,3-maleimidopropionomidyl-3,6-dioxaoctanediamine cysteineless PheP isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. phosphatidylethanolamine transmembrane domain 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (+)-biotinyl,3-maleimidopropionomidyl-3,6-dioxaoctanediamine cysteineless PheP isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The major objective of this study was to examine whether or not the topology of another polytopic membrane protein is reversibly affected by changes in phospholipid composition. To investigate the generality of the influence of specific lipids on the assembly of membrane proteins, we have focused on the high affinity phenylalanine permease PheP of E. coli. PheP and LacY are both electrochemical potential-driven transporters, but the former is a member of the amino acid/polyamine/organocation superfamily (8.Jack D.L. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1797-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), whereas the latter belongs to the larger major facilitator superfamily (9.Saier Jr., M.H. Beatty J.T. Goffeau A. Harley K.T. Heijne W.H. Huang S.C. Jack D.L. Jahn P.S. Lew K. Liu J. Pao S.S. Paulsen I.T. Tseng T.T. Virk P.S. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 1: 257-279PubMed Google Scholar). Members of these families are diverse in substrate specificity (sugars, amino acids, drugs, and other low molecular mass compounds), yet show significant homology in function, sequence, and structure as well as similarities in putative topogenic amino acid residues. Many of these transporters are characterized by a 12-TM topology with both N and C termini located in the cytoplasm (see Fig. 1). The C-terminal halves of these proteins strictly follow the positive inside rule (10.von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar) for their cytoplasmic domains. However, the N-terminal halves contain acidic amino acids in the cytoplasmic extramembrane domain. A net positive charge in these domains dictates cytoplasmic disposition, but conserved single negatively charged residues are topogenic factors favoring periplasmic location if they are present in the proximity of the aqueous-membrane interface (11.Kiefer D. Hu X. Dalbey R.E. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2197-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 12.Delgado-Partin V.M. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 33757-33763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Here, we report a systematic comparative study of the TM topology of PheP assembled in PE-containing or PE-lacking E. coli cells. Our results are consistent with a topological inversion of the N-terminal (NT) first helical hairpin (NT-TM I-P1-TM II-C2) of PheP and alterations in transport properties when PheP is assembled in membranes lacking PE. The topological inversion could be reversed by addition of PE after membrane insertion and was accompanied by a restoration of normal transport function. These results, coupled with the results for LacY, support a specific role for membrane lipid composition in determining the topological organization and function of membrane proteins. Several other polytopic membrane proteins require PE for full function (14.Wilson D.M. Ottina K. Newman M.J. Tsuchiya T. Ito S. Wilson T.H. Membr. Biochem. 1985; 5: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 15.van der Does C. Swaving J. van Klompenburg W. Driessen A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2472-2478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), suggesting that lipid-assisted topogenesis might be a general property of a subset of such proteins. The topological flexibility of these proteins revealed by changes in phospholipid environment might be related to the conformational flexibility required for transport function or assembly. Materials—Chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs Inc. Nitrocellulose sheets (0.2 μm) for immunoblotting were purchased from Schleicher & Schüll. Radiolabeled material, peroxidase-labeled antibody, and the enhanced chemiluminescence detection (ECL) kit came from Amersham Biosciences. 4-Acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (AMS) and (+)-biotinyl,3-maleimidopropionamidyl-3,6-dioxaoctanediamine (MPB) were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. and Pierce Biotechnology, respectively. Site-directed polyclonal antibody against the N terminus of PheP was prepared by Zymed Laboratories, Inc. Anti-LacZ polyclonal antibody was purchased from Rockland Inc. Avidinhorseradish peroxidase was from Pierce. Lubrol was purchased from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). Pansorbin cells came from Calbiochem. The λDE3 lysogenization kit and plasmid pET-11a were from Novagen. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—Strain AD93 (pss93::kanR) was used as the host strain. This strain cannot make PE and is not viable without either plasmid pDD72 (pssA+camR and pSC101 temperature-sensitive replicon) or growth medium containing millimolar concentrations of MgCl2 (16.DeChavigny A. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5323-5332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Strain AD93 (grown at 37 °C) lacks PE, and strain AD93/pDD72 (grown at 30 °C) retains the normal E. coli composition of phospholipids, including PE. Strain AA9256 (pss93::kanR ParaB-pssA+ ΔaraBA) (see Ref. 3.Bogdanov M. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2107-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar for description and characteristics of this strain) was used to regulate PE synthesis. Strain AA9256(T7) was made by integration of λDE3 prophage (carrying the T7 RNA polymerase gene under lac operon control) into the chromosome of strain AA9256; the strain was used to express target genes under the control of the T7 promoter. The wild-type pheP gene and the pheP gene encoding PheP lacking cysteines (PhePCys–) were subcloned into plasmid pBR322 (EcoRI and SalI site) to produce plasmids pBR-pheP and pBRphePCys–, respectively. A series of pBR322-derived plasmids encoding derivatives of PhePCys– containing single Cys replacements in extramembrane domains were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis (17.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6809) Google Scholar). The nomenclature for these plasmids is pBRpheP-X, e.g. pBRpheP-G13 has a G13C replacement (Fig. 1). pETpheP-X plasmids were constructed from pET-11a (carrying lacI) by cloning pheP-X genes into the BamHI and NdeI regions, thus placing the genes under tandem T7 promoter and lac operator control. Cells were grown in LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) as required and 50 mm MgCl2. Expression of pssA under the control of the araB promoter was either induced by growth in the presence of 0.2% arabinose or repressed by growth in the presence of 2% glucose; to maintain controlled expression, cells were maintained in exponential growth phase. Chemical Labeling of Cys Residues—A 50-ml culture of cells expressing a PheP-X derivative was grown in LB medium plus Mg2+ and ampicillin to mid-log phase (A600 = 0.5–0.6) and resuspended after harvesting to A600 = 25 in 1 ml of buffer A (100 mm K+-HEPES (pH 7.5), 250 mm sucrose, 50 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm KCl). Samples were incubated with 5 mm AMS for 30 min at 25 °C to block water-accessible Cys residues exposed to the periplasmic side of the cytoplasmic membrane. AMS was removed by two cycles of centrifugation and resuspension in buffer A. Cells (either with or without AMS pretreatment) were biotinylated by adding MPB to a final concentration of 100 μm, followed by incubation for 5 min at 25 °C. The reaction was quenched by addition of β-mercaptoethanol to 20 mm, followed by two cycles of centrifugation and resuspension in buffer A containing 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol. To expose Cys residues facing the cytoplasm to external solvent, cell suspensions were vortexed vigorously with 0.5% (v/v) toluene for 1 min and subjected to labeling as described above. Labeled cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol and then solubilized and immunoprecipitated as described below. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—After MPB labeling, cells were lysed by addition of an equal volume (0.5 ml) of 0.2 m NaOH, vortexed, incubated for 15 min on ice, and then centrifuged at 20,800 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellets were washed once with 4 m KCl and once with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and then solubilized by resuspension in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS, followed by vigorous vortexing for 30 min at room temperature and incubation for 10 min at 37 °C. Samples were diluted by adding 1.4 ml of cold 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Lubrol (immunoprecipitation buffer) and immunoprecipitated with anti-PheP polyclonal antibody overnight at 4 °C. The antibody complex was isolated by addition of 50 μl of a suspension of formalin-treated Staphylococcus aureus cells (Pansorbin) reconstituted in immunoprecipitation buffer according to the supplier's instructions. The samples were gently rocked at 4 °C for 60 min. After centrifugation, the pellet was washed once with immunoprecipitation buffer, twice with 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 m NaCl and 0.1% Lubrol, and once with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The final precipitates were solubilized by resuspension in 30 μl of SDS sample buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Samples were centrifuged, and the solubilized proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10–12% gels. The samples were transferred from the gels to nitrocellulose membranes as described previously (5.Bogdanov M. Sun J. Kaback H.R. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11615-11618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Avidin-horseradish peroxidase (1:50,000 dilution of a 2 mg/ml stock solution) and conventional ECL reagents were used to visualize biotinylated proteins according to the manufacturers' instructions. A Bio-Rad Fluor-S Max Multimager was used to record the results. Other Methods—Transport of [3H]phenylalanine was measured in intact E. coli cells as previously described (18.Wookey P.J. Pittard J. Forrest S.M. Davidson B.E. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 169-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phospholipid composition of cell membranes was analyzed after 32PO4 labeling of cells as previously described (16.DeChavigny A. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5323-5332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (65: 25:9, v/v) as the chromatography solvent. Activity and Expression of PheP—Plasmid pBRpheP (wild-type pheP gene subcloned into pBR322) was transformed into PE-containing strain AD93/pDD72, which was converted to PE-lacking strain AD93 by inducing loss of pDD72 (16.DeChavigny A. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5323-5332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phospholipid composition of all strains was verified before and after transformation (data not shown). PheP activity was measured by the ability to actively accumulate phenylalanine against a concentration gradient. The initial rate and the steady-state level of phenylalanine transport were severely inhibited in PE-lacking cells compared with PE-containing cells (Fig. 2A). Transport was also sensitive to addition of an uncoupler, verifying that active transport was occurring in both cell types. More detailed kinetic analysis showed that both the Km (34.8 versus 6.4 μm) and Vmax (4.2 versus 21.6 nmol/min/mg) were adversely affected in PE-lacking versus PE-containing cells, respectively (Fig. 2B). However, the PheP expression levels in the membranes of PE-containing and PE-lacking cells, as measured by Western blotting with anti-PheP polyclonal antibody, were nearly the same (Fig. 2C), consistent with a change in Km. Therefore, PE-lacking E. coli membranes contain the same amount of PheP, but with impaired Phe transport function. The level of PheP resulting from the chromosomal pheP gene (Fig. 2C, first lane) was barely detectable relative to the detection of gene product from the plasmidborne copy of pheP (second lane). Rationale and Methodology for Determination of Transmembrane Topology—The topology of putative hydrophilic loops connecting TMs of PheP was determined based on the accessibility in whole cells of single cysteine residues in these loops to sulfhydryl reagents. MPB is a biotinylated sulfhydryl-specific probe that readily passes through the pores of the outer membrane, but is relatively impermeable to the inner membrane (19.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 20.Long J.C. Wang S. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16235-16240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Therefore, cysteines located on the periplasmic side of the inner membrane should be derivatized by MPB, whereas cysteines located on cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane should be protected (3.Bogdanov M. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2107-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 21.Wada T. Long J.C. Zhang D. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17353-17357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) unless the membrane is first permeabilized with toluene (22.Jackson R.W. DeMoss J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1965; 90: 1420-1425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At high concentrations, some MPB does partition into the membrane and also enters the cytoplasm. To verify that MPB-derivatized cysteines were exposed to the outer surface of the inner membrane, highly hydrophilic AMS was used to block such residues prior to MPB treatment (20.Long J.C. Wang S. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16235-16240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The mildest conditions were established for each host strain as to the level of MPB that allows sufficient derivatization of periplasmic cysteines without significant reaction with cytoplasmic cysteines. Control experiments testing for biotinylation of cytoplasmic β-galactosidase (LacZ) (Fig. 3A), which contains many natural cysteine residues, demonstrated that the host cells used in this study were neither leaky nor permeable to MPB (Fig. 3B, second and fourth lanes) under the labeling conditions we chose for PheP unless the cells were first permeabilized with toluene (first and third lanes). Orientation of PheP Assembled in PE-containing and PE-lacking Cells—To assess the effect of membrane phospholipid composition on the topological organization of PheP, single Cys replacement derivatives (Fig. 1) of PhePCys– were expressed from plasmids in a PE-containing (with pDD72) or PE-lacking (without pDD72) strain (AD93) of E. coli. The replacements were in putative extramembrane domains connecting TMs, as predicted by PheP-PhoA fusion analysis (23.Pi J. Pittard A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2650-2655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and refined in this report by cysteine scanning analysis of the extramembrane domain (C2) connecting the P1 and P3 domains. All cysteine derivatives (including PhePCys–) exhibited nearly the same transport activity compared with wild-type PheP in either PE-containing or PE-lacking cells (data not shown). Western blot analysis using PheP-specific antibody showed that all these derivatives were present in the membrane fraction and at nearly the same level as wild-type PheP expressed from pBR322 (Fig. 4, A and B, lower panels). The level of endogenous PheP produced from the chromosomal copy of pheP could not be detected by either Western blotting or analysis of biotinylation at the level of protein subjected to analysis (Fig. 4, A and B, first lanes). The predicted biotinylation patterns (Fig. 4A, upper panel) were observed for single Cys derivatives (diagramed in Fig. 1) of PheP expressed and probed in PE-containing cells, i.e. only the derivatives with single cysteines in the periplasmic (P) domains were labeled, whereas the other five derivatives with single cysteines in the cytoplasmic (C) domains and the N terminus (NT) were protected from labeling. However, in PE-lacking cells (Fig. 4B, upper panel), the cysteine residues within the NT and C2 domains, which were not labeled in PE-containing cells, were strongly labeled in PE-lacking cells. Moreover, the cysteine located within the P1 loop that was fully biotinylated in PE-containing cells was not accessible in PE-lacking cells. The remainder of PheP downstream of the first helical hairpin exhibited a normal topological disposition as demonstrated by the same biotinylation patterns in PE-containing and PE-lacking cells. The Western blots (Fig. 4, A and B, lower panels) showed that the absence of a signal was not due to absence of PheP. No labeling of PheP was detected when the host strain (either +PE or –PE) expressing PhePCys– was probed, even though Western blot analysis showed that the protein was synthesized and inserted into the membrane. These results are an accurate representation of at least three experiments with each domain. To further substantiate the misorganization of the N-terminal helical hairpin (NT-TM I-P1-TM II-C2) of PheP in PE-lacking E. coli cells, single Cys derivatives expressed in both cell types were pretreated with side-specific control reagents (toluene or AMS) before MPB labeling. In PE-containing cells, when samples were permeabilized with toluene prior to MPB treatment, no additional biotinylation occurred for the periplasmic domains, but extensive biotinylation of the cytoplasmic domains occurred (Fig. 5A, left two lanes). These results are in agreement with the putative location of single cysteines in the current topology map of PheP (Fig. 1) (24.Pi J. Chow H. Pittard A.J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5842-5847Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In PE-lacking cells, the P1 domain was rendered accessible to MPB after toluene treatment, whereas the NT and C2 domains showed no increase in accessibility, consistent with an inversion in the topological orientation of the first two TMs. The remainder of the domains behaved the same as in PE-containing cells (Fig. 5A, right two lanes). AMS is a hydrophilic, membrane-impermeable, non-biotinylated sulfhydryl reagent (20.Long J.C. Wang S. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16235-16240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Periplasmic cysteines accessible to MPB in PE-containing and PE-lacking whole cells should be blocked from reaction with MPB if the cells are pretreated with AMS; however, cysteines that lie within the bilayer and that react with bilayer-partitioned MPB would not be protected by AMS. Fig. 5B shows that, in PE-lacking (but not PE-containing) cells, the NT and C2 domains were protected by AMS, as were the P3 and P5 domains in both cell types. This further establishes that, under the conditions used, MPB did not react with cysteines sequestered in either the membrane bilayer or the lumen. A Reversible Topological Switch Modulated by a Change in Phospholipid Composition—The potential reversible nature of the inverted topology observed in PE-lacking cells was addressed to better understand the molecular basis for the perturbations in the assembly and stability of this protein. In strain AA9256(T7), the chromosomal pssA gene is under tight regulation of the araB promoter, and the synthesis of PE can be induced by growth in the presence of arabinose or can be repressed by growth on glucose (3.Bogdanov M. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2107-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The pETpheP-X plasmids contain pheP genes under the control of the T7 promoter and lac operator. The T7 RNA polymerase expressed from the chromosome is also under the control of the lac operon, thereby allowing induction of PheP derivatives strictly dependent on addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to the growth medium. Cells were grown first on glucose and IPTG to allow synthesis and membrane assembly of PheP in the near absence of PE. Then, glucose and IPTG were removed, and cells were grown on arabinose to allow new synthesis of PE in the absence of newly synthesized PheP. Cells were isolated and assayed for transport function and Cys accessibility. Parallel cultures were grown with 32PO4 to determine the respective phospholipid composition. The level of PE was <10% of total phospholipids in cells grown on glucose with IPTG (Fig. 6A, left lane). PheP transport function was also reduced as expected (Fig. 6B). Treatment of intact cells expressing single Cys derivatives of PheP with MPB showed that topological misorganization of the first hairpin (NT-TM I-P1-TM II-C2) occurred (Fig. 6C), i.e. the NT, C2, and P3 domains were biotinylated with and without toluene treatment, indicating their periplasmic orientation, whereas the P1 domain was not accessible to MPB unless cells were first treated with toluene, indicating its cytoplasmic orientation. Switching to growth on arabinose in the absence of IPTG returned the phospholipid composition to normal (∼75% PE) after 90 min (Fig. 6A, right lane). Simultaneously, PheP transport function was restored (Fig. 6B), and proper topological organization was detected (Fig. 6C), i.e. the NT and C2 domains were no longer biotinylated unless cells were pretreated with toluene, whereas the P1 and P3 domains were accessible to MPB to the same extent with and without toluene. These results strongly support a reversible topological organization of the N-terminal first helical hairpin of PheP that is determined by the membrane phospholipid composition post-insertion. To establish that the restoration of PheP activity and the changes in PheP biotinylation patterns observed after switching growth from glucose to arabinose were not due to read-through expression of newly synthesized PheP in the absence of IPTG, protein radiolabeling (Fig. 6D) was performed under the same growth conditions as described above. The results indicate that there was no detectable PheP expressed during growth in the presence of arabinose without IPTG compared with the parallel positive control (induced with IPTG). Therefore, the recovered function and labeling pattern of PheP after induction of PE synthesis were due to existing PheP synthesized prior to induction of newly synthesized PE.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 906: 195-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 2Brown E.M. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 371-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Although the majority of Ca2+ is present in the bone and is in continuous turnover, there is little or no net gain or loss of Ca2+ from bone in normal young and healthy adults. To maintain calcium balance, the kidney excretes the same amount of calcium absorbed by the intestine. The amount of Ca2+ excreted by the kidney is about 2% of the total filtered load (3Friedman P.A. Gesek F. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 429-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). About 98% of the filtered Ca2+ is reabsorbed by the tubule. The absorption of Ca2+ in intestine and the reabsorption in kidney occur via both paracellular and transcellular pathways. In the kidney, the transcellular reabsorption of Ca2+ occurs mainly in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) 1The abbreviations used are: DCTdistal convoluted tubuleTRPtransient receptor potentialTRPVV type subfamily of TRP channelsCHOChinese hamster ovaryECaCepithelial Ca2+ channelCaTCa2+ transporter proteinMTSmethanethiosulfonatepHeextracellular pHBAPTA1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acidMTSEAmethanethiosulfonate ethylammoniumMTSETmethanethiosulfonate ethyltrimethylammoniumMTSESmethanethiosulfonate ethylsulfonateI-Vcurrent-voltage. and accounts for ∼15-20% of total reabsorption along the tubule.

The transcellular (re)absorption of Ca2+ is a multistep process (3Friedman P.A. Gesek F. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 429-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). It begins with passive entry of Ca2+ through the Ca2+ channels in the apical membranes followed by diffusion of Ca2+ through cytosol facilitated by binding to Ca2+-binding protein calbindin-D28K and eventually extrusion of Ca2+ across the opposing basolateral membranes. The extrusion of Ca2+ across the basolateral membranes requires energy and is mediated by Na+/Ca2+ exchangers and Ca2+-ATPases operating against the electrochemical gradient for Ca2+. It is believed that the initial step of passive entry through Ca2+ channels in the apical membranes is likely the rate-limiting step of the transepithelial Ca2+ reabsorption in the distal nephron (3Friedman P.A. Gesek F. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 429-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Several cDNAs for apical Ca2+ channels have been recently isolated from epithelial tissues. Hoenderop et al.

CaT1 is also known as ECaC2. CaT2 is the rat ortholog of ECaC1. The ECaC/CaT channels belong to the superfamily of cation-permeable ion channels known as transient receptor potential (TRP) (8Montell C. Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V. Bindels R.J. Bruford E.A.

The TRPV family is named after its first member, capsaicin (vanilloid) receptor (9Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (7090) Google Scholar). ECaC1/CaT2 and ECaC2/CaT1 are now known as TRPV5 and TRPV6, respectively (8Montell C. Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V. Bindels R.J.

Hydrophobicity analysis of the TRPV5 and TRPV6 polypeptides predicts a transmembrane topology of an amino-terminal cytoplasmic region containing many ankyrin repeats, six membrane-spanning domains with a putative pore-forming region similar to other Ca2+-permeable channels, and a carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic terminus containing potential regulatory sites for protein kinases (10Hoenderop J.G.

Hypertens. 2002; 11: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The TRPV5/6 epithelial Ca2+ channel in the apical membrane of kidney and intestine is likely the primary target for regulation of calcium homeostasis by hormones and acid-base disorders (10Hoenderop J.G.

Site-directed mutagenesis of TRPV5 was performed using a commercial mutagenesis kit (QuikChange from Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and confirmed by sequencing (15Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W.

Cell Culture and Patch Clamp Recording in Cultured Cells—CHO-K1 clone (from ATCC) was cultured in F12-K medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells (at ∼50% confluence) were co-transfected with cDNA for pEGFP plus cDNAs for wild type or mutant TRPV5 using LipofectAMINE Plus transfection kits (Invitrogen) and the protocol provided by the manufacturer's instruction manual. About 24 h after transfection, cells were dissociated by limited trypsin treatment and placed in a chamber for recording. Transfected cells were identified using epifluorescence microscopy.

Oocytes injected with cRNA (10 ng) for wild type or mutant TRPV5 were incubated in ND96 solution containing 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) at 18 °C for ∼20 h and nominal Ca2+-free ND96 for 6 h.45Ca2+ uptake was performed by incubating oocytes (in a 24-well culture dish) in an uptake solution containing 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES (at different pH values as specified), and 1 μCi/ml 45Ca2+ (specific activity, ∼0.15 μCi/μmol) at room temperature.

After three washes, oocytes were solubilized in 10% SDS and dissolved in scintillation fluid for counting for radioactivity. Where indicated, LaCl3 (1 mm) was added. Data Analysis and Statistics—To calculate the apparent second-order rate constant for inhibition of channels by MTS reagents, the time constant was obtained by fitting the time course of inhibition of channels by MTS reagents with a single exponential. The rate constant was calculated by dividing the reciprocal of the time constant by the concentration of reagent (19Lu T. Zhu Y.G. Yang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9926-9931Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To analyze the sensitivity of the channel to inhibition by extracellular protons, relative currents at different pHe values were fitted with a modified Hill equation using the Sigma-Plot program (18Leung Y.M. Zeng W.Z. Liou H.H. Solaro C.R. Huang C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10182-10189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Data are shown as mean ± S.E. of a number of observations. Statistical comparison was made using unpaired Student's t test. Inhibition of TRPV5 by Extracellular Acidification—The activity of rabbit TRPV5 expressed in CHO cells was measured using ruptured whole-cell recording (Fig. 1A). Similar to other Ca2+ channels, TRPV5 conducts monovalent cations if Ca2+ ions are removed from solution (12Vennekens R. Prenen J. Hoenderop J.G. Bindels R.J. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Pfluegers Arch. 2001; 442: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Also Ca2+ entry through TRPV5 raises intracellular Ca2+ in a microdomain near the cytoplasmic entrance of the pore and causes Ca2+-dependent inactivation (20Nilius B. Prenen J. Vennekens R. Hoenderop J.G. Bindels R.J. Droogmans G. Cell Calcium. 2001; 29: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 21Nilius B. Prenen J. Hoenderop J.G. Vennekens R. Hoefs S. Weidema A.F. Droogmans G. Bindels R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30852-30858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We used Na+ ions as charge carriers for inward currents to distinguish the direct effect of pHe on TRPV5 activity from other potential effects through alteration of Ca2+-dependent inactivation. Current-voltage (I-V) relationships were recorded using a voltage ramp protocol (-100 to 100 mV over 400 ms applied every 15 s from 0-mV holding potential) (Fig. 1B). Currents through TRPV5 were strongly inwardly rectifying and reversed at ∼15 mV at pHe 7.4 (Fig. 1C, see Fig. 6 for better illustration of reversal potential). Substitution of NaCl for NaAsp in bath solution did not alter the I-V relationship or reversal potential significantly (not shown). The effects of pHe on TRPV5 were examined by titrating HEPES in bath solution to different pH values. As shown in Fig. 1, C and D, decreasing pHe stepwise from 8.4 (maximal current) to 4.4 caused a progressive reduction in currents. The acid-induced inhibition was reversible; currents recovered as pHe was increased (Fig. 1D). The apparent pKa for acid inhibition of the currents was estimated at 6.55 ± 0.05 (Fig. 1E). This value of apparent pKa is within the range of pH (∼6-7) in the luminal fluid of DCT in physiological and pathophysiological states (22Dubose T.D. Pacacco L.R. Seldin D.W. Carter N.W. Kokko J.P. J. Clin. Investig. 1978; 78: 338-348Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Identification of Amino Acid of TRPV5 Involved in Mediating Inhibition of the Channel by Extracellular Acidification—The predicted transmembrane topology of TRPV5 resembles voltage-gated cation channels and contains six transmembrane-spanning domains and a putative pore region between the fifth and sixth domains (11Peng J.B. Hediger M.A. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2002; 11: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 12Vennekens R. Prenen J. Hoenderop J.G. Bindels R.J. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Pfluegers Arch. 2001; 442: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The two extracellular loops between the putative pore region and the last two transmembrane domains presumably form part of the outer vestibule of the pore (Fig. 2A). Proton-titratable amino acids in these loops are likely candidates for sensing and mediating the regulation of channel function by protons. To identify the amino acids responsible for proton sensing, we mutated each of the eight titratable amino acids in the two extracellular loops to a closely related non-titratable residue (Fig. 2A) and examined the sensitivity of each of the mutants to inhibition by extracellular acidification (Fig. 2, B-H). We found that mutation of glutamate 522 to glutamine (E522Q) decreased the sensitivity of the channel to inhibition by extracellular acidification (Fig. 2E). The apparent pKa for acid inhibition was shifted toward acidic pH by 1.2 pH units (pKa, 6.55 ± 0.05 for WT versus 5.32 ± 0.1 for E522Q; p < 0.01). These results suggest that titration of glutamate 522 by protons is involved in pHe regulation of TRPV5. The pKa of free glutamic acid is ∼4 (23Tanford C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1962; 17: 19-165Google Scholar). The difference between the pKa of TRPV5 conferred by glutamate 522 and that of a free glutamate in solution is likely due to the fact that titratable groups of amino acids within polypeptide chains are influenced by the local chemical environment (24Sawyer L. James M.N. Nature. 1982; 295: 79-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 25Jordt S.-E. Tominaga M. Julius D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8134-8139Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Mutations of other titratable amino acids did not alter pHe sensitivity of the channels (Fig. 2, B-D and F-H). Currents of tyrosine 547 to phenylalanine mutant (Y547F) in CHO cells were unstable, and thus the effects on this mutant were not studied (not shown). Inhibition of TRPV5-mediated 45Ca2+ Uptake by Extracellular Acidification—The physiological role of TRPV5 is to conduct Ca2+ (11Peng J.B. Hediger M.A. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2002; 11: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 12Vennekens R. Prenen J. Hoenderop J.G. Bindels R.J. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Pfluegers Arch. 2001; 442: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We examined the effects of pHe on Ca2+ permeation through TRPV5. We studied Ca2+ permeation through the channel using 45Ca2+ radioactive isotope uptake. 45Ca2+ uptake in Xenopus oocytes was used for expression cloning of cDNAs for ECaC/CaT (4Hoenderop J.G. van der Kemp A.W.

We chose the Xenopus oocyte expression system for 45Ca2+ uptake studies because of its reliability and high signal/background ratio. Oocytes expressing TRPV5 were preincubated in nominal Ca2+- and Mg2+-free solution for ∼6 h and incubated with 45Ca2+ (1 μCi/ml) for measurement of uptake over time as indicated (Fig. 3A). Oocytes expressing TRPV5 exhibited time-dependent uptake over 1 h (Fig. 3A). Control H2O-injected oocytes did not show significant uptake above background (not shown). TRPV5-mediated 45Ca2+ was more than 90% inhibited by La3+ (Fig. 3A). Similar to the results of whole-cell recording studies, extracellular acidification from pHe 9 to 4 decreased TRPV5-mediated 45Ca2+ uptake (Fig. 3B). Mutation of glutamate 522 shifted the pHe sensitivity of TRPV5-mediated 45Ca2+ uptake toward acidic pH (apparent pKa, 6.21 ± 0.25 for WT versus 5.12 ± 0.18 for E522Q; p < 0.05). Effects of Substitution of Other Titratable Amino Acids for Glutamate 522 on pHe Sensitivity—To further evaluate the importance of titration of glutamate 522 for inhibition of TRPV5 by pHe, we replaced glutamate 522 by several amino acids with a different pKa value and ionic charge in the titratable group. The pKa and charge of titratable groups of these amino acids are shown in Fig. 4A. Glutamate and aspartate have the same titratable group, carboxyl. Accordingly glutamate 522 to aspartate mutant (E522D) had virtually the same pHe sensitivity as the wild type TRPV5 (Fig. 4, B and C). Amino acids histidine, cysteine, tyrosine, and lysine are also titratable by protons. We found that the apparent pKa values for pHe regulation of E522H, E522C, and E522Y mutants were 6.2 ± 0.15, 6.69 ± 0.01, and 7.30 ± 0.01, respectively (Fig. 4, B and C). These pKa values were all significantly more alkaline than that for E522Q mutant (p < 0.05 versus pKa 5.32 ± 0.1 for E522Q), which contains the non-titratable glutamine. Cells transfected with E522K mutant, however, did not produce currents. Extracellular alkalinization from pHe 7 to 10 did not bring out currents in E522K-transfected cells (not shown). Thus, the lack of currents for E522K is not due to a very alkaline pKa for the mutant. Further studies are required to understand the reasons for lack of currents for E522K mutant. The amino acid glutamate 522 of rabbit TRPV5 is not conserved in human TRPV5 (14Peng J.B. Brown E.M. Hediger M.A. Genomics. 2001; 76: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 26Hoenderop J.G. Vennekens R. Muller D. Presnen J. Droogmans G. Bindels R.J. Nilus B. J. Physiol. 2001; 537: 747-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The human TRPV5 has the non-titratable glutamine at amino acid 522. We found that the pKa for pHe inhibition of human TRPV5 was not significantly different from that of E522Q mutant of rabbit TRPV5 (5. 60 ± 0.2 versus 5.32 ± 0.1, not significant). Overall these results support the hypothesis that titration of amino acid at the position of glutamate 522 contributes to inhibition of TRPV5 channel by extracellular protons. As mentioned above, differences between apparent pKa for pHe inhibition of TRPV5 and that of free amino acids in solution are likely caused by local chemical environment (24Sawyer L. James M.N. Nature. 1982; 295: 79-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 25Jordt S.-E. Tominaga M. Julius D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Effects of Extracellular Acidification on Single Channel Conductance of TRPV5—Single channel conductance of TRPV5 was measured by cell-attached single channel recording. At extracellular (pipette) pH 7.4, unitary inward current amplitude decreased as negative pipette potential (-Vp) was reduced from -120 to -60 mV (Fig. 5A). The unitary current-voltage relationship was linear over -120 to -60 mV, predicting a chord conductance (γ) of 91 ± 7.5 picosiemens (Fig. 5B). The effects of pHe on single channel conductance were examined by cell-attached recording using different pipette pH values. At pH 8.4, single channel conductance (104 ± 4.5 picosiemens) was higher than at pH 7.4. At pH 6.4 and 5.4, conductances were reduced to 80 ± 5.1 and 58 ± 2.6 picosiemens, respectively. Compared with the reduction in whole-cell current, the reduction in single channel conductance by extracellular acidification was much smaller (78% reduction in whole-cell current versus 40% reduction in single channel conductance by acidification from pHe 8.4 to 5.4, p < 0.05; Fig. 5C). Assuming no changes in the number of channels, reduction of whole-cell currents is due to reduction in single channel conductance and/or open probability. The above results thus suggest that extracellular acidification decreases both single channel conductance and open probability of TRPV5. As will be shown below in Fig. 5, E and F, only reduction in open probability is mediated by glutamate 522. We next examined the effects of extracellular acidification on single channel conductance on E522Q mutant. We found that single channel conductance was lower in E522Q mutant relative to wild type (Fig. 5D). Extracellular acidification also decreased the single channel conductance on E522Q by an extent similar to that on wild type (Fig. 5D). In contrast to that for wild type, the percentage of reduction in single channel conductance and in whole-cell current by extracellular acidification was the same for E522Q (Fig. 5E). Fig. 5F shows the percentage of single channel conductance (gray bar) and whole-cell current (black bar) at pHe 6.4 relative to pHe 8.4 for wild type TRPV5 and for E522Q mutant, further illustrating differences in the effect of extracellular acidification for the two constructs. These results suggest that titration of glutamate 522 of TRPV5 by protons is responsible for decrease in open probability but not in single channel conductance of the channel.

https://openalex.org/W2051852738,"The glycine receptor is a member of the ligand-gated ion channel receptor superfamily that mediates fast synaptic transmission in the brainstem and spinal cord. Following ligand binding, the receptor undergoes a conformational change that is conveyed to the transmembrane regions of the receptor resulting in the opening of the channel pore. Using the acetylcholine-binding protein structure as a template, we modeled the extracellular domain of the glycine receptor α1-subunit and identified the location of charged residues within loops 2 and 7 (the conserved Cys-loop). These loops have been postulated to interact with the M2-M3 linker region between the transmembrane domains 2 and 3 as part of the receptor activation mechanism. Charged residues were substituted with cysteine, resulting in a shift in the concentration-response curves to the right in each case. Covalent modification with 2-(trimethylammonium) ethyl methanethiosulfonate was demonstrated only for K143C, which was more accessible in the open state than the closed state, and resulted in a shift in the EC50 toward wild-type values. Charge reversal mutations (E53K, D57K, and D148K) also impaired channel activation, as inferred from increases in EC50 values and the conversion of taurine from an agonist to an antagonist in E53K and D57K. Thus, each of the residues Glu-53, Asp-57, Lys-143, and Asp-148 are implicated in channel gating. However, the double reverse charge mutations E53K:K276E, D57K:K276E, and D148K:K276E did not restore glycine receptor function. These results indicate that loops 2 and 7 in the extracellular domain play an important role in the mechanism of activation of the glycine receptor although not by a direct electrostatic mechanism.

Fast synaptic transmission in the central nervous system is mediated by members of the ligand-gated ion channel (LGIC) 1The abbreviations used are: LGICligand-gated ion channelGlyRglycine receptornAChRnicotinic acetylcholine receptor5-HT3R5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) type 3 receptorGABAARγ-aminobutyric acid type A receptorAChBPacetylcholine-binding proteinMTSES2-sulfonatoethyl methanethiosulfonateMTSET2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl methanethiosulfonate. receptor superfamily. The glycine receptor (GlyR) is a member of the nicotinic-like LGIC superfamily that includes the nicotinic acetylcholine (nAChR), serotonin type 3 (5-HT3R), and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABAAR) receptors (1.Betz H. Neuron. 1990; 5: 383-392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 2.Changeux J.P. Edelstein S.J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 959-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Each of these receptors are pentameric complexes arranged around a central ion conducting pore. Individual subunits share a similar membrane topology, with hydropathy analysis predicting a large extracellular domain at the N terminus and four putative transmembrane domains (M1–M4) (1.Betz H. Neuron. 1990; 5: 383-392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). A key characteristic of these receptors is the integral ion channel that is opened following ligand binding. The extracellular domain contains the ligand binding site, which is spatially separate from the M2 domain that lines the ion channel pore of these receptors (3.Unwin N. Cell. 1993; 72: 31-41Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 4.Corringer P.J. Le Novere N. Changeux J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Inherited mutations located in the regions flanking the M2 domain of the GlyR α1-subunit are associated with human startle disease (hyperekplexia) (5.Shiang R. Ryan S.G. Zhu Y.Z. Hahn A.F. O'Connell P. Wasmuth J.J. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) and startle syndromes in other species (6.Rajendra S. Schofield P.R. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 80-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In humans, the startle mutations R271L/Q and K276E map to the M2–M3 linker domain (5.Shiang R. Ryan S.G.

Rees M. J. Med. Genet. 1996; 33: 435-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). At both locations, the mutations result in the substitution of a positive charged residue. The effect of these mutations is to disrupt signal transduction, as inferred from the increases in EC50 for glycine and the conversion of taurine from an agonist to an antagonist (8.Rajendra S. Lynch J.W. Pierce K.D. French C.R. Barry P.H. Schofield P.R. Neuron. 1995; 14: 169-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This was also demonstrated at the single channel level for the K276E mutation (9.Lewis T.M. Sivilotti L.G. Colquhoun D. Gardiner R.M. Schoepfer R. Rees M. J. Physiol. 1998; 507: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). An inherited mutation in the M2–M3 region of the nAChR is associated with a form of congenital myasthenic syndrome (10.Croxen R. Newland C. Beeson D. Oosterhuis H. Chauplannaz G. Vincent A. Newsom-Davis J. Human Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 767-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and a mutation in the GABAAR is associated with a rare form of epilepsy (11.Baulac S. Huberfeld G. Gourfinkel-An I. Mitropoulou G. Beranger A. Prud'homme J.F. Baulac M. Brice A. Bruzzone R. LeGuern E. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 46-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar), both of which disrupt channel gating. In addition, site-directed mutagenesis and covalent modification studies have demonstrated that the M2–M3 region undergoes a conformational change that is associated with activation of the GlyR (12.Lynch J.W. Rajendra S. Pierce K.D. Handford C.A. Barry P.H. Schofield P.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 13.Lynch J.W. Han N.-L.R. Haddrill J. Pierce K.D. Schofield P.R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2589-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar evidence of conformational change of the M2–M3 domain has been found for the GABAAR (14.Bera A.K. Chatav M. Akabas M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43002-43010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We sought to identify structures within the extracellular domain of the human GlyR that are involved in the conformational change that conveys the ligand binding event to opening the channel pore. The amino acid sequence of the acetylcholine-binding protein (AChBP) from the snail Lymnaea stagnalis, was found to have a strong (15–24%) homology with the extracellular domains of LGIC subunits (15.Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of this protein provides a template with which to model these extracellular domains (15.Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). Loop 7 of the AChBP corresponds with the conserved Cys-loop of LGICs, which is essential for a functional receptor but not involved in ligand binding (16.Vandenberg R.J. Rajendra S. French C.R. Barry P.H. Schofield P.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 198-203PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Amin J. Dickerson I.M. Weiss D.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 317-323PubMed Google Scholar). The location of loop 7 in the AChBP suggests that the conserved Cys-loop of LGIC receptors is in a position to interact with the transmembrane domains of the receptor, and so may be involved in gating (15.Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar, 18.Dougherty D.A. Lester H.A. Nature. 2001; 411: 252-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Loop 2 is also a flexible loop, which in a LGIC receptor subunit is proposed to be in a position to interact with the transmembrane domains. Alignment of the AChBP and GlyR α1-subunit sequences shows that loop 2 corresponds to the location of the A52S mutation in spasmodic mice (19.Ryan S.G. Buckwalter M.S. Lynch J.W. Handford C.A. Segura L. Shiang R. Wasmuth J.J. Camper S.A. Schofield P. O'Connell P. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 20.Saul B. Volker S. Kling C. Cornel M. Gass P. Kuhse J. Becker C.-M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The effect of this mutation is to impair the GlyR activation (19.Ryan S.G. Buckwalter M.S. Lynch J.W. Handford C.A. Segura L. Shiang R. Wasmuth J.J. Camper S.A. Schofield P. O'Connell P. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 20.Saul B. Volker S. Kling C. Cornel M. Gass P. Kuhse J. Becker C.-M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), resulting in an exaggerated startle phenotype, which suggests that loop 2 might also be involved in gating of the GlyR. As charged residues and conformational changes in the M2–M3 linker are associated with the activation of the ion channel, we sought to examine the role of charged residues in loops 2 and 7 in the extracellular domain of the GlyR α1-subunit. Using a combination of cysteine accessibility techniques and mutations that reversed the charge of these residues, we evaluated the role of loops 2 and 7 in the activation of the GlyR. We demonstrate that residues in these loops play an important role in receptor activation but not by a simple electrostatic interaction as has been observed in the GABAAR (21.Kash T.L. Jenkins A. Kelley J.C. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. Nature. 2003; 421: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Molecular Modeling—Amino acid residues 31–248 of the α1-subunit of the human GlyR (Swiss Prot accession P23415) were aligned with residues 1–206 of the AChBP (Protein Data Bank accession 1I9B) according to the alignment of Brejc (15.Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). Pentameric α1-subunit models of the GlyR were built in a single run of the program Modeler (22.Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar), and the structures were then refined using the Refine_1′ function of Modeler. Mutagenesis and Expression of Human GlyR α1-Subunit cDNA—The cDNA encoding the wild-type human α1-subunit of the GlyR was subcloned into the pCIS expression vector. Note that the α1-homopentamer was expressed, not the 3α:2β native heteropentamer, in this study. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the oligonucleotide-directed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique and confirmed by DNA sequencing of the complete plasmid. To ensure that the sulfhydryl reagents only reacted with the substituted cysteine residues, we used receptor subunits in which the free cysteine residue at position 41 in the extracellular domain had been mutated to an alanine (13.Lynch J.W. Han N.-L.R. Haddrill J. Pierce K.D. Schofield P.R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2589-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of the substituted cysteine mutations were introduced on this C41A background. The mutation of acidic and basic residues in the Cys-loop and loop 2 of the extracellular domain, and in the M2–M3 linker domain were introduced on the wild-type GlyR α1-subunit. Plasmid DNA encoding wild-type or mutated α1-subunits of the human GlyR was transiently transfected into exponentially growing 293 cells (adenovirus-transformed human embryonic kidney cells; ATCC CRL 1573) along with cDNA for the CD4 protein (2:1, α1 GlyR: CD4) using the 3% CO2-calcium phosphate transfection technique. After 24 h exposure to precipitate, cells were washed with culture medium (Eagle's minimum essential medium in Hank's salts supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum). Patch-clamp studies were performed on homopentameric α1 GlyRs 24–72 h after washing the cells. Transfected cells were identified by labeling with CD4 polystyrene beads (Dynabead M-450, CD-4; Dynal, Great Neck, NY). Electrophysiology—Whole cell patch clamp experiments were performed at room temperature (22.5 ± 0.3 °C). The cells were continually superfused with an external bathing solution containing:140 mm NaCl, 5mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose, adjusted to pH 7.4 with 1 m NaOH. Glycine and taurine concentrations were made up in the external bathing solution and were applied directly to the cells with a modified U-tube. Patch pipettes were fabricated from borosilicate glass capillaries and fire polished to give a tip resistance of 2–6 MΩ. Pipettes were filled with an intracellular solution containing: 120 mm CsCl, 20 mm TEACl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 11 mm EGTA adjusted to pH 7.2 with CsOH. Whole cell currents were recorded at a holding potential of –50 mV using an Axopatch-1D amplifier and digitised using pClamp 6.0 software and a Digidata 1200 ADC interface (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). At least 80% series resistance compensation was achieved in each experiment. Concentration response curves were constructed from the peak current response to the application of a range of agonist concentrations, with a minimum of 1 min between successive applications. Inhibition curves were constructed from the peak current response to the co-application of a range of taurine concentrations and a fixed concentration of glycine, with a minimum of 1 min between successive applications. Sulfhydryl Reagents and Reactions—We used the charged methane thiosulfonate (MTS) derivatives, 2-sulfonatoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSES), and 2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSET) (Toronto Research Chemicals Inc.). Stock solutions of 100 mm MTSES and MTSET in distilled water were aliquoted into screw cap microcentrifuge tubes and rapidly frozen in an ethanol/dry ice mix before storage at –20 °C. For each application of MTS reagents, a new aliquot was thawed, diluted in bathing solution to the working concentration and used immediately. The rate of covalent modification of cysteine substituted GlyRs by MTS reagents was measured in the presence and absence of glycine. The peak amplitude of the current in response to an EC50 concentration of glycine (I50) and a maximum concentration of glycine (Imax) were recorded at least twice prior to MTS reagent addition. For reactions in the open state, 100 μm MTSET or 100 μm MTSES was co-applied with 2 mm glycine. The change in response to an EC50 concentration of glycine (relative ΔI50) was expressed relative to the maximum response according to Equation 1,RelativeΔI50=1-((I50(t)-I50(0))/Imax)(Eq. 1) where I50 (0) is the current response to an EC50 concentration of glycine before MTS addition, I50(t) is the current response for each cumulative time point, t, of the MTS reaction and Imax is the maximum current response. The data expressed in this way were fitted with a single exponential decay (Origin, Microcal Software, Northampton, MA) to obtain an estimate of the first order rate constant. The averaged first order rate constant was determined from at least 3 cells in each case. Data Analysis and Statistics—Concentration response data and inhibition data were plotted on semilogarithmic axes and fitted using a non-linear least squares routine (Origin, Microcal Software, Northampton, MA) with the empirical Hill Equation 2,I=Imax([A]nH/([A]nH+EC50nH))(Eq. 2) where I is the peak whole cell current recorded following application of a range of concentrations of the agonist, [A]; Imax is the estimated maximum current, EC50 is the glycine concentration required for a half-maximum response and nH is the Hill co-efficient. Statistics were performed on wild-type and mutant EC50 values and Hill coefficients using a one-way ANOVA with Fisher's post-hoc test. Modeling of the GlyR on the AChBP—By threading the extracellular domain of the GlyR sequence on the AChBP crystal structure we were able to identify those residues of the GlyR that are located within loop 2 and loop 7, which may be located close to the M2-M3 linker or the ion channel itself (Fig. 1). Amino acid residues with a charged side chain that were located in these loops were chosen for study, namely Glu-53 and Asp-57 in loop 2, and Lys-143 and Asp-148 in loop 7. The residues known to be involved in ligand binding are located distant (25–40 Å) from this site in the receptor (15.Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). Effects of Mutations to Cysteine—All of the cysteine mutants were constructed on an α1-subunit C41A GlyR background to eliminate the possibility of MTS reagents reacting with the free cysteine. This receptor showed no alteration in the glycine sensitivity (EC50 = 0.027 ± 0.004 mm, Table I) or any change after 500 μm MTSES or 500 μm MTSET were added for 1 min (Fig. 2).Table ISummary of glycine responses for cysteine-substituted α1 GlyRsGlyR α1aAll values are presented as mean ± S.E.ImaxEC50nHnnAmmC41A9.24 ± 1.50.027 ± 0.0042.75 ± 0.35E53C2.47 ± 1.90.90 ± 0.08bp < 0.01 compared with C41A.1.27 ± 0.12bp < 0.01 compared with C41A.4D57C0.022 ± 0.011.15 ± 0.24bp < 0.01 compared with C41A.0.78 ± 0.11bp < 0.01 compared with C41A.4K143C1.94 ± 0.90.28 ± 0.051.98 ± 0.244D148C0.012 ± 0.0030.97 ± 0.03bp < 0.01 compared with C41A.0.88 ± 0.02bp < 0.01 compared with C41A.4a All values are presented as mean ± S.E.b p < 0.01 compared with C41A. Open table in a new tab To assess the effect of replacing a charged residue with a cysteine, concentration response curves to glycine were measured for the mutant receptors E53C and D57C in loop 2, and K143C and D148C in loop 7. Each of these receptors showed an increase in EC50, with K143C showing the smallest shift (EC50 = 0.28 ± 0.05 mm, 10-fold increase) and D148C showing the largest shift (EC50 = 0.97 ± 0.03 mm, 36-fold increase), compared with the C41A receptor (Table I). Effects of MTS Addition to Substituted Cysteine Mutants— The covalent modification of cysteine residues enables the introduction of the positive charged trimethyl ammonium group from MTSET or the negative charged sulfonate group from MTSES. For each of the substituted cysteine mutants, this provides a mechanism for reintroducing a charged side chain similar to that of the original charged amino acid. However, this depends upon the substituted cysteine being available for modification. By reacting the positive charged MTSET to the K143C GlyR and the negative charged MTSES to the E53C, D57C, and D148C GlyRs, we could determine whether these cysteine residues were accessible to MTS reagents, as inferred from any detectable shifts in the concentration response curve. When 500 μm MTSES was applied for 1 min to the E53C, D57C, or D148C in the presence or absence of glycine, there was no alteration in the amplitude of the I50 or Imax (Fig. 2). This suggests either the cysteine was not accessible to MTSES for modification, or the sulfonate group of the MTSES had no effect on the response of the mutant receptors. When 500 μm MTSET was applied to the K143C in the presence or absence of glycine, there was no change in the Imax but a shift in the I50 such that it was now ∼80% of the Imax (Fig. 2). A complete concentration-response curve showed that following covalent modification the EC50 had shifted from 242 μm to a value of 70.3 μm, which is closer to that of the C41A GlyR. This indicates that the K143C receptor was accessible for modification by MTSET and the addition of a positive charge partially restored the function of the receptor. Rates of Reaction for K143C GlyR—To determine if there were conformational changes at the Lys-143 residue between the open and closed states of the receptor, the rate of MTSET modification was measured in both states. For the open state (Fig. 3), the response at an EC50 concentration of glycine (I50) and a maximum concentration of glycine (Imax) were measured before MTSET addition. Then, 100 μm MTSET was applied in the presence of a saturating concentration of glycine (2 mm) for 2 s with at least a 2 min washout before retesting of the I50 and Imax responses. Subsequent applications of 100 μm MTSET in the presence of 2 mm glycine for 3 s, followed by retesting of the I50 and Imax responses, were repeated until the reaction was complete. For the closed state (Fig. 3), the I50 and Imax responses were measured after each 3 s application of 100 μm MTSET in the absence of glycine, until the reaction was complete. The change in I50 currents were expressed relative to the Imax (relative ΔI50) and plotted against the cumulative reaction time (Fig. 3C). First order rate constants were estimated from the fit of a single exponential decay to the data. The rate of reaction in the open state (τ = 1.35 ± 0.39 s, n = 3) was faster than that of the closed state (τ = 5.36 ± 2.5 s, n = 4). This suggests that the K143C residue is more accessible in the open state than the closed state of the GlyR. Effects of Charge Reversal Mutations—We created the reverse charge mutations E53K and D57K in loop 2, and K143E and D148K in loop 7. In comparison to the wild-type, the E53K GlyR had a 46-fold increase in EC50 (1.17 ± 0.17 mm, Table II), the D57K GlyR had a 7-fold increase (0.23 ± 0.02 mm, Table II) and the D148K GlyR had a 38-fold increase (0.96 ± 0.11 mm, Table II). In contrast, the K143E GlyR showed no change in glycine (EC50 0.028 + 0.002 mm) or taurine (EC50 0.09 + 0.01 mm) activation when compared with the wild-type GlyR. Application of taurine to the E53K and D148K receptors at concentrations up to 50 mm resulted in no detectable whole cell currents, while taurine applied to D57K elicited maximum currents that were only ∼10% of those elicited by glycine (Table II). Co-application of taurine in the presence of 5 mm glycine demonstrated that taurine inhibited the glycine current of the E53K and D57K GlyRs. Taurine inhibition curves were performed for the E53K and D57K GlyRs and the obtained IC50 values were 1.78 ± 0.12 mm and 12.1 ± 1.5 mm respectively (Fig. 4; Table II). The whole cell currents elicited from the D148K receptor were too small (Imax <15 pA) to gain a reliable inhibition curve, but a 40 ± 5% reduction in current at 5 mm glycine was seen with co-application of 50 mm taurine (data not shown). Conservative mutations E53D, D57E, and K143R all showed no change from the wild-type receptor (E53D, EC50 = 0.021 ± 0.003 mm; Table II) or a slight decrease in EC50 concentration (D57E, EC50 = 0.008 ± 0.0004 mm; K143R, EC50 = 0.007 ± 0.002 mm; Table II). From these results, we would infer that channel gating is affected by the charge reversal mutations E53K and D57K in loop2, and D148K in loop 7 of the GlyR.Table IISummary of glycine and taurine responses at wild-type and charge reversal mutationsGlyR α1Glycine activationTaurine activationTaurine inhibitionImaxEC50nHnItau/IGlyEC50nHnIC50nHnnAmmmmmmWT2.87 ± 0.900.025 ± 0.001.70 ± 0.1460.79 ± 0.040.19 ± 0.021.80 ± 0.126(b)E53K0.27 ± 0.091.17 ± 0.17*1.1 ± 0.03ap < 0.01 compared to wild type (WT).4(a)1.78 ± 0.120.73 ± 0.044E53D5.29 ± 1.470.021 ± 0.0031.95 ± 0.124(c)D57K0.43 ± 0.160.23 ± 0.031.1 ± 0.05ap < 0.01 compared to wild type (WT).60.12 ± 0.040.57 ± 0.090.99 ± 0.07412.1 ± 1.50.81 ± 0.094D57E4.74 ± 1.880.008 ± 0.0011.80 ± 0.154(c)K143E7.05 ± 1.170.028 ± 0.0022.02 ± 0.2550.48 ± 0.170.09 ± 0.011.09 ± 0.123(b)K143R5.51 ± 0.940.007 ± 0.0022.42 ± 0.114(c)D148K0.01 ± 0.0020.96 ± 0.11bp < 0.05 compared to wild-type.0.94 ± 0.07bp < 0.05 compared to wild-type.5(a)(c)K276EcData reproduced from Lynch et al.

Therefore, we tested for electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged residues of loops 2 and 7, and the positively charged Lys-276 residue of the M2-M3 linker by creating the double reverse charge mutations E53K:K276E, D57K:K276E, and D148K:K276E. None of these doubly mutated GlyRs restored the function of these receptors to that of the wild-type, instead the EC50 values remained similar to that of the K276E receptor (Fig. 5; Table III). Thus, there does not appear to be any direct electrostatic interactions that influence channel gating between these residues in loops 2 and 7, and Lys-276 in the M2–M3 linker.Table IIISummary of fitted parameters for double charge reversal mutant GlyRGlyR α1aAll values are presented as mean ± S.E.ImaxEC50nHnnAmmWT2.87 ± 0.900.025 ± 0.0011.70 ± 0.146E53K:K276E0.046 ± 0.021.34 ± 0.09bp < 0.01 compared to wild type (WT).1.05 ± 0.07bp < 0.01 compared to wild type (WT).3D57K:K276E0.011 ± 0.0020.95 ± 0.08bp < 0.01 compared to wild type (WT).0.77 ± 0.05bp < 0.01 compared to wild type (WT).5D148K:K276E0.015 ± 0.0051.20 ± 0.13bp < 0.01 compared to wild type (WT).0.88 ± 0.04bp < 0.01 compared to wild type (WT).4E53K:K143E0.027 ± 0.021.36 ± 0.08bp < 0.01 compared to wild type (WT).0.81 ± 0.04bp < 0.01 compared to wild type (WT).3D57K:K143E0.58 ± 0.40.41 ± 0.020.98 ± 0.05bp < 0.01 compared to wild type (WT).5a All values are presented as mean ± S.E.b p < 0.01 compared to wild type (WT). Open table in a new tab A further hypothesis is that residues in loops 2 and 7 may interact with each other. We tested for interactions between negatively charged residues in loop 2 and Lys-143 of loop 7 by creating the double reverse charge mutations E53K:K143E and D57K:K143E. The EC50 of the E53K:K143E mutant was similar to the E53K receptor, and the D57K:K143E receptor had shifted slightly to the right of the D57K receptor (Fig. 6; Table III). Therefore, electrostatic interactions between loops 2 and 7 of the extracellular domain do not appear to influence gating. Modeling of the GlyR—By threading the amino acid sequence of the GlyR α1-subunit extracellular domain over the AChBP structure, we were able to identify the location of residues that may be involved in various functions of the receptor. In this model, the spasmodic loop and the conserved Cys-loop of the GlyR correspond to loop 2 and loop 7, respectively, of the AChBP structure. These are located in regions that are postulated to be close to the ion channel (15.Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar, 18.Dougherty D.A. Lester H.A. Nature. 2001; 411: 252-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and to the M2–M3 linker (Fig. 1). We propose that conformational changes occur in the spasmodic loop and Cys-loop of the GlyR upon ligand binding that are an important part of the process linking ligand binding to channel gating. This is consistent with the previous demonstration that the spasmodic mutation results in impaired receptor gating but does not affect ligand binding (19.Ryan S.G. Buckwalter M.S. Lynch J.W.

Chem. 2002; 277: 43002-43010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Conformational Changes That Mediate Channel Activation following Ligand Binding—By using MTS modification of cysteine residues, it is possible to identify residues that are either altered in their own conformation, or else the environment around them is altered by the conformational changes of the receptor. The cysteine-substituted mutant K143C was able to be modified by MTSET, resulting in a decrease in the EC50 value. By showing that the rate of this reaction was faster in the open state than the closed state, we demonstrate that this residue is more accessible to modification in the open state. As accessibility is dependent upon the environment surrounding the sulfur atom of the cysteine, these results suggests that the introduced cysteine is in a more hydrophilic environment when the receptor is in the open state compared with the conformation adopted in the closed state (23.Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). For each of the E53C, D57C, and D148C GlyR mutations, the receptor did not show any change in glycine activation following the addition of MTS reagents. This could be the result of one of several possibilities. The structure of the receptor may have been altered by the cysteine residue such that the introduced cysteine is not in the same position as the original residues and is now in a hydrophobic environment; the residues may be buried in a pocket that the MTS reagent cannot access, despite actually being surrounded by a hydrophilic environment; or the MTS reagents may react but not change the function of the receptor. We consider the latter possibility unlikely, considering that removal of charge on these residues changes so drastically the function of the receptor. Finally, the residues may shift from a hydrophobic to a hydrophilic area during the signal transduction process, but the length of time that the residues are accessible for modification is so short, because of the altered response of the receptor to glycine, that the MTS reactions are not detectable. Role of Charged Residues in Loops 2 and 7 of the Extracellular Domain—Both the E53K and D57K mutations resulted in an increased EC50 and the agonist taurine was converted to an antagonist. We infer from these results that these two loop 2 charged residues (Glu-53 and Asp-57) are involved in channel gating or the signal transduction process leading to channel gating. The conversion of taurine from an agonist to a partial agonist or an antagonist has previously been demonstrated by mutations within the M2–M3 linker, establishing this region as being involved in channel gating (8.Rajendra S. Lynch J.W. Pierce K.D. French C.R. Barry P.H. Schofield P.R. Neuron. 1995; 14: 169-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The two charged residues in loop 7 (Lys-143 and Asp-148) were also shown to be involved in channel gating. The D148K mutation, similar to E53K, resulted in an increased EC50 and the conversion of the agonist taurine to an antagonist. While the K143E receptor was not different to the wild-type receptor, the K143C mutation did increase the EC50. As MTSET reacted faster in the open state, we can infer this residue is not involved in ligand binding, as the MTSET would otherwise be competing with glycine to react at the introduced cysteine and thus would be expected to react faster in the closed state. This is the first study to show the role of charged residues in both loop 2 and loop 7 of the extracellular domain of the GlyR in channel gating. The reverse charge E53K mutation shifts the concentration-response curve (46-fold increase) to a similar degree as the E53C mutation (33-fold increase). This is not the case for the Asp-57 residue, where the D57K GlyR has a smaller shift in EC50 (9-fold increase) compared with the D57C GlyR (42-fold increase). The Lys-143 residue is similarly intriguing, with virtually no change in the EC50 for K143E GlyR, but a 10-fold shift in the EC50 for the K143C GlyR, compared with wild type. When the loop 7 sequence is aligned with that of other LGICs (Fig. 7), the Lys-143 residue aligns with a positively charged arginine residue in the nAChR α7-subunit, however it is a negatively charged glutamic acid residue in the GABAAR α1-subunit. Therefore, at position 143 of the GlyR the presence of a charge rather than the valency of the charge may be important for the function of the receptor. In comparison, the negatively charged glutamic acid residue at position 53 appears to be conserved as an acidic residue across α-subunits, as is the aspartic acid residue at position 148 (Fig. 7). Charged Residues in Loops 2 and 7 of the GABAAR—During the course of this study, it was shown that charged residues in loops 2 and 7 of the GABAAR α1-subunit interact with residues in the M2–M3 loop to activate channel gating (21.Kash T.L. Jenkins A. Kelley J.C. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. Nature. 2003; 421: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Kash et al. (21.Kash T.L. Jenkins A. Kelley J.C. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. Nature. 2003; 421: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) show that three negatively charged residues (Asp-57, Glu-59, and Asp-149) in these loops cause an increase in the EC50 for GABA when the charge is reversed. A sequence alignment of the GlyR α1- and GABAAR α1-subunits indicates that the residues in the GABAAR α1-subunit involved in gating interactions align with several of the residues chosen for study in the GlyR (Fig. 7). Using mutant cycle analysis of double reverse charge mutations, Kash et al. (21.Kash T.L. Jenkins A. Kelley J.C. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. Nature. 2003; 421: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) were able to demonstrate direct electrostatic interactions between both residues D57 (loop 2) and Asp-149 (loop 7) and the Lys-279 residue in the M2–M3 linker of the GABAAR α1-subunit. However, double reverse charge mutations of the Glu-53, Asp-57, and Asp-148 residues and the Lys-143 and Lys-276 residues of the GlyR failed to show any evidence for direct electrostatic interactions. This suggests that while charged residues are clearly involved in the gating process they are not acting through direct electrostatic interactions between these particular pairs of residues in the GlyR. Implications for Members of the LGIC Receptor Superfamily—This study has confirmed the importance of charged residues in loops 2 and 7 of the extracellular domain of the GlyR in the signal transduction process that links the ligand binding event to channel opening. Unlike the GABAAR (21.Kash T.L. Jenkins A. Kelley J.C. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. Nature. 2003; 421: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), there is at present no evidence for direct electrostatic interactions between charged residues in loops 2 or 7 and residue Lys-276 in the M2–M3 loop of the GlyR α1-subunit. This indicates that while the mechanism of signal transduction may be similar between the various receptors of the LGIC superfamily, it is not identical. Studies on the nAChR and 5-HT3 receptor, in addition to further studies on the GABAAR and GlyR, will be necessary to determine the breadth of difference in this mechanism between LGIC receptors. The process of forming theoretical models, mutation and covalent modification analysis and further refining of molecular models will continue to be an invaluable tool in the structural and functional definition of the processes of receptor activation in the LGIC superfamily.

We isolated and fully characterized two isoforms of a novel 38-residue antimicrobial peptide (AMP), spheniscin, belonging to the β-defensin subfamily. Spheniscin concentration was found to strongly increase during the period of food storage. Using a synthetic version of one of two spheniscin isoforms, we established that this peptide has a broad activity spectrum, affecting the growth of both pathogenic bacteria and fungi.

Lack of food resources induced by climatic changes may impair the breeding success of wild animals. For king penguins, the female usually comes back from foraging at sea to feed the chick at hatching. However, in relation to the circumpolar wave, thought to be linked with the El Niño Southern Oscillation phenomenon (1White W.B. Peterson R G. Nature. 1996; 380: 699-702Crossref Scopus (608) Google Scholar), the return of the female may be delayed due to the necessity of foraging at a greater distance than usual. The survival of the chick can still be ensured by the male, as it can provide food preserved in its stomach during the final 3 weeks of incubation (2Gauthier-Clerc M. Le Maho Y. Clerquin Y. Drault S. Handrich Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 928-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 3Gauthier-Clerc M. Le Maho Y. Clerquin Y. Bost C.-A. Handrich Y. Mar. Eco. Prog. Ser. 2002; 237: 291-300Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A remaining unanswered question is how can food be preserved from attack by microorganisms, when the rich 38 °C buffered growth medium (3Gauthier-Clerc M. Le Maho Y. Clerquin Y. Bost C.-A.

The maintained mass and energetic value of the food throughout the fast (3Gauthier-Clerc M. Le Maho Y. Clerquin Y. Bost C.-A. Handrich Y. Mar. Eco. Prog. Ser. 2002; 237: 291-300Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and the stressed-induced characteristics of the stomach bacteria (4Thouzeau C. Froget G. Monteil H. Le Maho Y. Harf-Monteil C. Polar. Biol. 2003; 26: 115-123Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) altogether suggest the existence of a protection mechanism against food degradation by microorganisms. Like other mucosal surfaces, the gastrointestinal tract surface interacts directly with the external environment and therefore has to be protected from damage and invasion by ingested or indigenous microorganisms.

The role of these AMPs is not limited to epithelial protection through innate immune responses since they can attract human blood cells, alert the adaptive immune system and induce gastrointestinal secretions (8Bals R.

An additional role could then be the participation of AMPs in the control of microbial proliferation, contributing to the preservation of retained food. antimicrobial peptide acetonitrile matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry minimal inhibitory concentration analysis of variance ANOVA for repeated measures reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography spheniscin-1 spheniscin-2. antimicrobial peptide acetonitrile matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry minimal inhibitory concentration analysis of variance ANOVA for repeated measures reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography spheniscin-1 spheniscin-2. In the present study, we found numerous, strongly active antimicrobial substances in the stomach contents of male penguins that efficiently conserve food during their incubation fast. Among these substances, two isoforms of a novel 38-residue AMP were identified and named spheniscin. Spheniscin belongs to the β-defensin subfamily, a well documented AMP group in vertebrates. Its concentration is markedly higher in conserving than in digesting birds and, in the former, it increases during the period of food conservation up to the micromolar level. Using a synthetic version of spheniscin, we demonstrated that this peptide was active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and filamentous fungi including some human pathogens. The results of this study therefore support the idea that the identified spheniscin, in addition or in synergy with other not yet identified AMPs, may play a role in the preservation of penguin stomach contents during the incubation fast. The study was carried out on Possession Island (46°25′S, 51°45′E), Crozet Archipelago, during the incubation period of the breeding cycle of the king penguin, Aptenodytes patagonicus, from December 2000 to March 2001. Stomach food sampling of seven male king penguins was performed at three points during the fast, which occurs over last part of incubation. The sampling time points were at the beginning and the middle (7 days after first sampling) of incubation, then at the end of incubation after relief by the female. Birds were handled with extreme care to minimize stress and potential injury. Handling did not result in breeding failure as the birds thereafter continued the incubation task. Samples of stomach contents were collected non-invasively by sucking up food with a sterile rubber tubing introduced via the bill down in to the stomach. About 60 ml of food were retrieved and homogenized in a cold and sterile tube. Aliquots for AMPs study were maintained at -80 °C. Another sample was frozen at -20 °C for determination of the level of food preservation. To determine the level of food preservation three criteria were selected: (a) the existence of bile pigment coloration from duodenogastric refluxes, indicating active gastric digestion; (b) the evolution of the food pH during the fast, close to pH 2 being the optimum for gastric digestive enzymes in birds (13Duke G.E. Sturkie P.D. Avian Physiology. Springer-Verlag, New York1986: 289-302Crossref Google Scholar); (c) the energetic value of food (through lipid content analysis). These criteria allowed the distinction to be made between birds that conserved (n = 3) or digested (n = 3) their stomach contents during the incubation fast. Another bird that conserved his stomach content during the first part of the fast and digested it during the second part was studied separately. Frozen food samples were ground on ice using an ultra-turrax and then sonicated (5 × 30 s bursts separated by 30-s cooling periods) in 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid (1:10 w/v) containing aprotinin (Sigma) as a protease inhibitor (22.5 μg/ml). Sample pH was adjusted to between 2.5-3.0, and the samples were left agitating overnight at 4 °C. Extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 6 °C, and the supernatants were prepurified by solid phase extraction on Sep-Pak C18 Cartridges (Waters™). Peptides were eluted with 80% acetonitrile (ACN) acidified with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (acidified water) and freeze-dried. Spheniscin Purification—6 mg of extract were subjected to reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) on Aquapore RP-300 C18 column (250 × 7 mm, Brownlee™) using a 2-72% linear gradient of ACN in acidified water at a flow rate of 1.3 ml/min. The manually collected fractions were freeze-dried, then resuspended in 150 μl of ultrapure water, and aliquots were assayed for antimicrobial activities. The RP-HPLC fraction with the broadest activity at the end of the fast (see Fig. 1C, star) was further subjected to RP-HPLC on an Aquapore OD-300 column (220 × 4.6 mm, Brownlee™), using a linear biphasic gradient of ACN in acidified water. Fractions were manually collected, then freeze-dried prior to resuspension in 70 μl of ultrapure water and assayed for antimicrobial activity. The active compounds were finally purified to homogeneity in a third step on the same column as above, using linear biphasic gradients of ACN in acidified water. During the course of purification, the purity of the fraction was controlled by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), performed on a Bruker Daltonique (Bremen, Germany) BIFLEX III™ mass spectrometer operating in positive linear mode as described previously (14Uttenweiler-Joseph S. Moniatte M. Lambert J. Van Dorsselaer A. Bulet P. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 366-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Reduction and S-Pyridylethylation—An aliquot of purified spheniscins was subjected to reduction and alkylation as previously described (15Bulet P. Cociancich S. Reuland M. Sauber F. Bischoff R. Hegy G. Van Dorsselaer A. Hetru C. Hoffmann J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The S-pyridylethylated peptides were desalted by RP-HPLC on a narrow bore Delta Pak HPIC18 column (150 × 2 mm, Waters™) with a 2-60% linear gradient of ACN in acidified water at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min, analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS, and sequenced using automated Edman degradation on a pulse liquid automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc., model 473A). Enzymatic Digestion—The S-pyridylethylated peptides were treated with chymotrypsin (Roche Applied Science) at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:20 (w/w) and digestion products were characterized by MALDI-TOF-MS. Disulfide Array Assignment—Purified spheniscin (native or synthetic) was treated with trypsin (Roche Applied Science) at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:10 (w/w), and the mixture of digestion products was analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS. Screening Bioassays—Antimicrobial activity was determined against selected test organisms: Escherichia coli SBS 363 (Gram-negative bacteria), Micrococcus luteus (Gram-positive bacteria), and Neurospora crassa (fungus). Activity was detected using liquid growth inhibition assays in microtiter plates as previously described (16Hétru C. Bulet P. Shafer, W.M. Methods in Molecular Biology. Vol. 78. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1997: 35-49Google Scholar). Spheniscin Quantitation—For all food samples, the RP-HPLC fractions initially collected between a 2 and 72% gradient of ACN were checked for the presence of both forms of spheniscins by MALDI-TOF-MS. For each food sample, the fractions of interest were pooled and subjected to successive RP-HPLC until sufficient purification was achieved. The spheniscin concentration was determined using capillary zone electrophoresis (details of the procedure in Ref. 17Lamberty M. Ades S. Uttenweiler-Joseph S. Brookhart G. Bushey D. Hoffmann J.A. Bulet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9320-9326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) by comparing peaks from the fraction analyzed and a calibrated solution of highly purified spheniscins. The quantities were normalized to the amount of initial food sample collected. Two-way ANOVA for repeated measures (rm ANOVA) followed by multiple comparison (Tukey test) was performed using the SigmaStat software (Jandel-SPSS), and values quoted in results are means ± S.E. Activity Spectrum of Synthetic Spheniscin-2—The activity spectrum of spheniscin-2 was estimated using a synthesized version of the molecule (Altergen Laboratory, France). The integrity, purity, and correct refolding of the synthetic peptide were confirmed by MALDI-TOF-MS and treatment with trypsin (Roche Applied Science), as described above. The activity spectrum (minimal inhibitory concentration, MIC) of the synthetic peptide (concentration range, 0.75 μm up to 100 μm) was determined against bacteria, yeast, and fungi using liquid growth inhibition assays (16Hétru C. Bulet P. Shafer, W.M. Methods in Molecular Biology. Vol. 78. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1997: 35-49Google Scholar). Bactericidal or bacteriostatic effects were measured by colony forming unit counting at +24 h. When the antimicrobial activity was assayed in different pH conditions, the pH of the medium was adjusted with hydrochloric acid. Two positive controls MSI-94 (a broad spectrum linear amphipathic magainin variant, Ref. 18Maloy W.L. Kari U.P. Biopolymers. 1995; 37: 105-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) and thanatin (a broad spectrum antifungal peptide, Ref. 19Fehlbaum P. Bulet P. Chernysh S. Briand J.P. Roussel J.P.

Zasloff (Magainin Scientific Institute, Plymouth Meeting, Philadelphia). The MIC value corresponded to the interval of concentration [a] - [b], where [a] is the highest concentration tested at which the bacteria are growing and [b] is the lowest concentration that cause 100% inhibitory growth (20Casteels P. Tempst P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The strains used were those previously reported (21Lowenberger C. Bulet P. Charlet M. Hetru C.

Monteil and Piémont, Institute of Bacteriology, University of Strasbourg, France), E. coli SBS 363 (Dr. Boquet, Centre d'Etudes Nucléaires, Saclay, France), Vibrio metshnikovii, and V. anguillarum (Dr. Bachère, IFREMER, Montpellier, France), Candida albicans IHEM 8060 (EntoMed, Strasbourg, France), and C. tropicalis (Dr. Koenig, Hôpital Civil, Strasbourg, France). Detection of Several Antimicrobial Substances—Following solid-phase extraction of the acidified extracts from stomach contents of king penguins, RP-HPLC revealed the presence of numerous fractions with antimicrobial activity mostly in the elution zone between 20 and 40% ACN (Fig. 1). Some were active against one, two, or all of the three tested microorganisms, namely M. luteus, E. coli, and N. crassa. Fractions with antimicrobial activity were more frequent in the stomach contents of birds conserving food, particularly at the onset and middle of the fast (Fig. 1). Furthermore, most recorded antimicrobial activity corresponded to full growth inhibition in samples from conserving birds, while growth delay was predominant in digesting birds, suggesting higher concentrations of AMPs in samples from the conserving birds (Fig. 2). In conserving birds, fractions active against the three tested microorganisms were present for each fasting period (Fig. 2A). Conversely, a fraction active against E. coli was present in only one single sample from the digesting birds (Figs. 1C and 2B). Isolation and Identification of the Antimicrobial Substances from the Most Active RP-HPLC Fraction Observed in Conserving Birds—As the strongest activities were observed in the fraction eluted at 29% ACN in conserving birds (Fig. 1C, star), an extensive purification was performed on this fraction. Two compounds with molecular masses of 4482.8 MH+ and 4501.7 MH+ were obtained (Fig. 3A). Mass spectrometry analysis after reduction and S-pyridylethylation indicated that the two compounds contained six cysteine residues involved in the formation of three internal disulfide bridges (Fig. 3B, mass excess of 6 × 105 Da). Sequencing by Edman degradation on the pyridylethylated peptides yielded two sequences of 38 residues: SFGLC*RLRRGFC*AH/RGRC*RFPSIPIGRC*SRFXQC*C*RRXW, where C* stands for a pyridylethylated cysteine, H/R stands for two residues found at position 14, and X for unidentified residues. To solve the identity of residues at position 31 and 37, the pyridylethylated peptide was subjected to chymotrypsin digestion and the proteolytic fragments were analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS. The resulting mass fingerprint established that residues 31 and 37 corresponded to valines. The calculated molecular masses of the peptides with histidine or arginine residues in position 14 were 4482.4 and 4501.4 Da, respectively. Comparison of the calculated molecular masses with those measures by MALDI-TOF-MS (Fig. 3A) confirmed the two sequences (Fig. 3C) obtained by automatic Edman degradation. The disulfide array of the peptide was investigated using trypsin digestion and analysis of the products by MALDI-TOF-MS. One fragment, containing cysteine residues in positions 12 and 27 linked by a disulfide bridge, was observed at MH+ 915.4. A second fragment containing the four other cysteine residues, and including two disulfide bridges, was observed at MH+ 1709.6. These data agreed with folding typical for the β-defensin family. In addition, data bank searches (FASTA.genome, NCBI-TBLASTN) revealed that the two peptides isolated were homologuous to β-defensins from chicken and turkey. The β-defensins isolated from the king penguin were named spheniscin-1 (Sphe-1, synonym pBD-1; histidine as residue 14; molecular mass, 4481.8 Da), and spheniscin-2 (Sphe-2, synonym pBD-2; arginine at position 14; molecular mass, 4500.7 Da), after the order name of penguins. Quantification of Spheniscins in the Stomach Content During the Incubation Fast—Sphe-2 was detected in all birds, while Sphe-1 was detected only in the three samples from one of the conserving birds. The concentration of spheniscins in the stomach contents was markedly higher in conserving compared with digesting birds (Fig. 3D; rm ANOVA, F1,17 = 31.2, p = 0.005), whatever the fasting period (Tukey test, p < 0.05). The concentration of spheniscins increased 13-fold from the onset to the end of the fast in conserving birds (74 ± 48 nm and 943 ± 311 nm, respectively). In contrast, spheniscins concentration remained at a low level in digesting birds at all time points (maximum: middle fast, 24 ± 14 nm). Interestingly, a drop in spheniscin concentration was observed during the second part of the fast in one particular bird where food was initially stored then digested (Fig. 3D). Activity Spectrum of Sphe-2—To investigate the antimicrobial activity of spheniscin, a synthetic version of properly folded Sphe-2 was used. Sphe-2 affected the growth of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, yeast and filamentous fungi (Table I). When used at a range of concentrations identical to that of the broad spectrum control antibiotic peptide (MSI-94), Sphe-2 was highly effective against all the Gram-positive bacteria tested. It had a bactericidal effect against all the Gram-positive bacteria, with the exception of S. saprophyticus. Sphe-2 showed activity against most of the Gram-negative bacteria tested. This activity was mainly bacteriostatic, except against E. coli 1106 and V. metshnikovii. No activity could be detected against the enteropathogenic Gram-positive bacteria Enterobacter cloacae and A. faecalis at up to 100 μm peptide. Sphe-2 was also active against yeast and filamentous fungi. While moderately active against C. albicans and C. glabrata (MIC = 50-100 μm and MIC > 100 μm, respectively), Sphe-2 was highly effective against C. tropicalis (MIC = 1.5-3.0 μm). The two filamentous fungi tested were found to be susceptible to Sphe-2 in the same range of concentration as the control antibiotic, thanatin (< 6 μm). Interestingly, Sphe-2 was even more active against human pathogenic strain Aspergillus fumigatus (MIC = 3-6 μm) than thanatin (MIC close to 20 μm), and it was even found to inhibit fungal sporulation at 6 μm (Fig. 4).Table IAntimicrobial activity of synthetic Sphe-2 and of control antibioticsMicroorganismsMICBactericidal effect of Sphe-2SpheniscinControl antibioticμmGram-positive bacteriaM. luteus1.5-3.00.63-1.25YesB. subtilis0.8-1.51.25-2.50YesB. cereus ATCC 117783-61.25-2.50YesB. megaterium0.4-0.80.31-0.63YesS. aureus1.5-3.01.25-2.50YesS. saprophyticus1.5-3.00.63-1.25NoS. haemolyticus1.5-3.00.63-1.25YesN. asteroides0.8-1.51.25-2.50YesA. viridans0.4-0.81.25-2.50L. monocytogenes6-122.5-5Gram-negative bacteriaE. coli SBS 3630.8-1.51.25-2.50NoE. coli 11061.5-3.01.25-2.50YesE. cloacaeND5-10S. typhimurium6-122.5-5.0NoK. pneumoniae50-1002.5-5.0NoP. aeruginosa ATCC 821186-120.63-1.25NoA. faecalisND2.5-5.0V. metshnikovii NCTC 848325-50YesV. anguillarum ATCC 1926425-50NoYeastC. glabrata>100NDC. albicans IHEM 806050-1002.5-5.0C. tropicalis1.5-3.02.5-5.0FungiN. crassa3-62.0-4.0A. fumigatus3-6close to 20 Open table in a new tab In order to see if the moderate acidity of the preserved stomach content (pH 4-6) (4Thouzeau C. Froget G. Monteil H. Le Maho Y. Harf-Monteil C. Polar. Biol. 2003; 26: 115-123Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) might impair the efficacy of spheniscins in vivo, the effect of Sphe-2 on the bacterial growth was tested at pH ranging from 4.2 to 6.1. Sphe-2 is highly effective against E. coli throughout this pH range (MIC = 6-12, 25-50, and 6-12 μm at pH of 4.2, 5.2, and 6.1, respectively). This study reports the presence of antimicrobial activity in the stomach contents of those king penguins that efficiently conserve food for more than 2 weeks (Fig. 1). This activity was found throughout the RP-HPLC profile, suggesting the existence of several antimicrobial substances. Among the active RP-HPLC fractions, we identified two isoforms of a 38-residue AMP, spheniscin-1 and spheniscin-2. The presence of both isoforms in only one of the birds analyzed suggested a gene polymorphism. Comparison of the primary spheniscin sequences with others in databanks revealed high similarities to vertebrate β-defensins (Fig. 5). The closest similarity was with β-defensins from chicken (50% identity versus 63% including conservative residues) and turkey (47% identities versus 58% including conservative residues) (23Zhao C. Nguyen T. Liu L. Sacco R.E. Brogden K.A. Lehrer R.I. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 2684-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The quantitation of the spheniscins in two types of penguin, those conserving and those digesting stomach contents, initially allowed us to demonstrate that the concentration of spheniscins was markedly higher in penguins with well-preserved stomach contents. Secondly, it was shown that the maintenance of food preservation throughout the incubation period was associated with an increase in the concentration of spheniscins. This increase could be due to an increase of de novo synthesis or to a decrease in peptide degradation. However, as the level of spheniscin increased in the stomach contents whereas the pH was maintained at a constant and high level from the beginning of the fast in preserving birds, 2C. Thouzeau, unpublished data. it would appear that de novo synthesis is the most likely hypothesis. In addition, the observed stability of peptide activity within the 4.2-6.1 pH range strongly suggests that the peptide is not affected by conserving conditions in the stomach. The stomach contents are conserved in anticipation of feeding the newly-hatched chick in cases where the mate is not back at eclosion (2Gauthier-Clerc M. Le Maho Y. Clerquin Y. Drault S. Handrich Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 928-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Consequently, to remain a valuable nutrient resource, the stomach contents must be protected from degradation by microorganisms during storage. We had previously shown that most of the bacteria in the well preserved stomach food exhibit morphological characteristics of stressed bacteria (sporulated, deformed, or dead cells (4Thouzeau C. Froget G. Monteil H. Le Maho Y. Harf-Monteil C. Polar. Biol. 2003; 26: 115-123Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar)). These data suggested factors inhibiting bacterial growth in penguins with well preserved stomach contents. It is therefore tempting to assume that spheniscins, among other antimicrobial substances detected, may play a pivotal function in the protection of food storage and protection from digestion by microorganisms introduced with the food. This would not exclude a potential contribution from non-pathogenic outgrowing microorganisms preventing the growth of others. With regard to the potential for spheniscins to inhibit bacterial and/or fungal growth, synthetic Sphe-2 was found to be active against most of the microorganisms tested. Highest potency was seen against Gram-positive bacteria with significant activity against Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. AMP activity greatly depends on electrostatic interactions (24Hwang P.M. Vogel H.J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), and with a large number of positively charged amino acids (9 arginine residues and 1 histidine for Sphe-1; 10 arginine for Sphe-2) and no negatively charged residues present, the spheniscins are highly cationic. Under physiological conditions, the isoelectric points of Sphe-1 and Sphe-2 are pH 12.90 and 12.95 (see Fig. 5). These characteristics could all contribute to the wide activity spectrum observed for synthetic spheniscin. Moreover, penguin β-defensins have a higher proportion of positively charged amino acids as compared with other avian β-defensins, possibly reflecting a greater antimicrobial activity for the penguin molecules in vivo. It is important to note that synthetic Sphe-2 was functionally active, in vitro, at pH conditions found in the penguin stomach contents. The inhibition of A. fumigatus sporulation by spheniscin is similar to that described for stomoxin, an AMP from the anterior midgut of the blood-feeding insect Stomoxys calcitrans (25Boulanger N. Munks R.J. Hamilton J.V. Vovelle F. Brun R. Lehane M.J. Bulet P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49921-49926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and for termicin, an antifungal defensin from the termite Pseudacanthotermes spiniger (26Lamberty M. Zachary D. Lanot R. Bordereau C. Robert A. Hoffmann J.A. Bulet P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4085-4092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). A. fumigatus is the most frequently isolated strain in invasive aspergillosis found in immunocompromised humans and animals. Birds, and particularly penguins, are known to be especially sensitive too. The high activity of spheniscin against this fungus and other potentially pathogenic microorganisms, such as S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, or Listeria monocytogenes, indicates a potential therapeutic capacity of such peptides. In the mammalian intestinal host defense model presented by Bevins et al. (11Bevins C.L. Martin-Porter E. Ganz T. Gut. 1999; 45: 911-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), an AMP concentration in the micromolar range is estimated to be sufficient for the defensins present in the intestinal lumen to influence the resident microflora. Such a level of spheniscin was found in stomach content samples (see Fig. 3D). At the intestinal epithelial level the estimated concentrations of α-defensin in humans and the cryptdins of mice approach the millimolar level, i.e. up to 1,000-fold higher than the estimated concentrations in the intestinal lumen (11Bevins C.L. Martin-Porter E. Ganz T. Gut. 1999; 45: 911-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 27Ayabe T. Satchell D.P. Wilson C.L. Parks W.C. Selsted M.E. Ouellette A.J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). Therefore, the local concentration of spheniscin in the penguin upper digestive tract may easily reach higher levels than those found in food samples. The possibility also exists that the additional antimicrobially active fractions found in preserved stomach content samples may complement the in vivo efficacy of the spheniscin through a synergistic effect (28Bevins C.L. Contrib. Microbiol. 2003; 10: 106-148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or act in an additive way (29Singh P.K. Tack B.F. McCray Jr., P.B. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L799-L805PubMed Google Scholar). The exact mode of action of spheniscin and the other antimicrobial substances found within the stomach contents necessitates further studies, which are underway. In conjunction with our data, these observations made in other studies tend to support the hypothesis that the antimicrobial substances detected in the stomach contents of king penguins are participants in food preservation. The presence of exogenous microorganisms induces a local immune response at the epithelial surface, which includes the rapid secretion of AMPs (8Bals R. Respir. Res. 2000; 1: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). In the king penguin stomach, it is possible that such an immune response is induced by exogenous microorganisms which reach the stomach cavity during feeding or as a consequence of pecking behavior of the incubating adults, as well as through the irritant contact of food with the gastric epithelial surface. At this juncture it is also tempting to make the parallel with blood-sucking insects where, following feeding, production of AMPs is thought to aid in the conservation of the blood meal prior to digestion (25Boulanger N. Munks R.J. Hamilton J.V. Vovelle F. Brun R. Lehane M.J. Bulet P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49921-49926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 30Munks R.J. Hamilton J.V. Lehane S.M. Lehane M.J. Insect. Mol. Biol. 2001; 10: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Whatever the direct or indirect effect of AMP secretion on the stomach contents of king penguins, it is critical for the reproductive success of these birds, as conservation of undigested food during the key breeding stage of incubation determines the survival of the newly-hatched chick. Our data further illustrate the general interest that lie in physiological adaptations of free-ranging wild animals, a situation that cannot easily be mimicked in the laboratory (31Le Maho Y. Nature. 2002; 416: 21Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We thank P. Irving for critical editing of the manuscript. We also thank N. Chatelain, M. Schneider, and M. Charlet for their help."
https://openalex.org/W2112336169,"Prion diseases are associated with conformational conversion of the cellular prion protein, PrPC, into a misfolded form, PrPSc. We have investigated the equilibrium unfolding of the structured domain of recombinant murine prion protein, comprising residues 121–231 (mPrP-(121–231)). The equilibrium unfolding of mPrP-(121–231) by urea monitored by intrinsic fluorescence and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopies indicated a two-state transition, without detectable folding intermediates. The fluorescent probe 4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5-disulfonic acid (bis-ANS) binds to native mPrP-(121–231), indicating exposure of hydrophobic domains on the protein surface. Increasing concentrations of urea (up to 4 m) caused the release of bound bis-ANS, whereas changes in intrinsic fluorescence and CD of mPrP took place only above 4 m urea. This indicates the existence of a partially unfolded conformation of mPrP, characterized by loss of bis-ANS binding and preservation of the overall structure of the protein, stabilized at low concentrations of urea. Hydrostatic pressure and low temperatures were also used to stabilize partially folded intermediates that are not detectable in the presence of chemical denaturants. Compression of mPrP to 3.5 kbar at 25 °C and pH 7 caused a slight decrease in intrinsic fluorescence emission and an 8-fold increase in bis-ANS fluorescence. Lowering the temperature to –9 °C under pressure reversed the decrease in intrinsic fluorescence and caused a marked (∼40-fold) increase in bis-ANS fluorescence. The increase in bis-ANS fluorescence at low temperatures was similar to that observed for mPrP at 1 atm at pH 4. These results suggest that pressure-assisted cold denaturation of mPrP stabilizes a partially folded intermediate that is qualitatively similar to the state obtained at acidic pH. Compression of mPrP in the presence of a subdenaturing concentration of urea stabilized another partially folded intermediate, and cold denaturation under these conditions led to complete unfolding of the protein. Possible implications of the existence of such partially folded intermediates in the folding of the prion protein and in the conversion to the PrPSc conformer are discussed.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease generally presents itself as a form of progressive dementia, whereas scrapie and BSE are generally manifest as ataxic illnesses (1.Wells G.A.H. Scott A.C. Johnson C.T.

The latter is a self-folding domain and contains three α-helices and a two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (9.Hornemann S. Glockshuber R. J. Mol.

Nature. 1996; 382: 180-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Prion diseases may be considered as disorders resulting from abnormal protein folding. The transition between PrPC and PrPSc occurs by a post-translational mechanism and appears to take place without any detectable covalent modification of the protein (11.Stahl N.

One of the main characteristics distinguishing PrPC from PrPSc is the resistance of the latter to proteolytic digestion (12.Oesch B. Westaway D. Walchli M. McKinley M.P. Kent S.B.H. Aebersold R.

Fourier transform infrared and CD spectroscopy studies indicate that PrPC is highly helical (42%), with little β-sheet structure (3%) (16.Pan K.M. Baldwin M. Nguyen J. Gasset M. Serban A. Groth D. Huang Z. Fletterick R.J. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10962-10966Crossref PubMed Scopus (2084) Google Scholar). In contrast, PrPSc contains a large amount of β-structure (43%) and less helical structure (30%). According to the current hypothesis, PrPSc propagates by impressing its abnormal conformation on PrPC, thereby generating additional PrPSc molecules in an autocatalytic reaction (19.Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 793-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). This conversion reaction is thought to occur either by a template-assisted refolding mechanism in which binding of PrPSc to PrPC lowers the activation energy that separates the two states (20.Cohen F.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) or via a nucleated polymerization process in which PrPSc serves as a seed that recruits and stabilizes abnormal conformations of PrP that are in dynamic equilibrium with PrPC (21.Caughey B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 235-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 22.Ferreira S.T. De Felice F.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Despite intensive research, the molecular mechanisms underlying the conformational transition between the normal and pathogenic conformers of PrP remain unknown. Partially structured folding intermediates have been implicated in the conversion of PrPC to PrPSc (23.Cohen F.E. Pan K.M. Huang Z. Baldwin M. Fletterick R.J. Prusiner S.B. Science. 1994; 264: 530-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Partially folded intermediates are also believed to play central roles in amyloid formation by others proteins, such as transthyretin and lysozyme variants (24.Jiang X. Smith C.S. Petrassi H.M.

However, folding intermediates of the prion protein have proved very difficult to detect and characterize (26.Wildegger G. Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 27.Hosszu L.L.P. Baxter N.J. Jackson G.S. Power A. Clarke A.R. Waltho J.P. Craven C.J. Collinge J. Nat. Struct.

In recent years, elevated hydrostatic pressure and low temperatures have been used as tools to stabilize partially folded intermediate states that are not detectable in equilibrium in the presence of chemical denaturants (29.Zhang J. Peng X. Jonas A. Jonas J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8631-8641Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 30.Sasahara K. Nitta K.

Here, we characterize two partially folded equilibrium intermediates of the murine prion protein stabilized by high hydrostatic pressure and low temperature. Demonstration of the existence of these species supports the notion that partially folded intermediates present during the folding of the prion protein may have a potential involvement in the PrPC → PrPSc conversion or in the formation of neurotoxic PrP species in vivo. Chemicals—bis-ANS was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Stock solutions were prepared in methanol, and the concentration was determined using the extinction coefficient, ϵ360 = 23,000 m–1 cm–1 (33.Haugland R.P. Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Products, 9th Ed. Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR2002: 537-541Google Scholar). Urea was from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). All other reagents were of the highest analytical grade commercially available. Protein Expression and Purification—The plasmids for bacterial expression of wild-type and F175W variant of murine PrP-(121–231) were generous gifts from Dr. R. Glockshuber (Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, Switzerland). The recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified as previously described (34.Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3258-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The concentrations of wild-type and F175W mPrP-(121–231) were determined using ϵ280 = 19,890 m–1 cm–1 and ϵ280 = 28,800 m–1 cm–1 (26.Wildegger G. Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 34.Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3258-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), respectively. Fluorescence Measurements—Unless otherwise noted, fluorescence emission spectra were measured at 25 °C on an ISS PC1 spectrofluorometer (ISS Inc., Champaign, IL). For intrinsic fluorescence measurements, excitation was at 280 nm and emission spectra were recorded from 300 to 420 nm using a WG 320 filter on the emission channel. bis-ANS fluorescence was excited at 365 nm, and emission spectra were recorded from 420 to 600 nm. Bandpasses of 8 and 16 nm were used for excitation and emission, respectively. Fluorescence measurements under pressure were performed using a pressure cell equipped with sapphire optical windows, similar to that originally described by Paladini and Weber (35.Paladini Jr., A. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2587-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The temperature was controlled by connecting the thermostatted pressure cell to a circulating bath. During compression or cooling, the samples were allowed to equilibrate for 10 min at each condition prior to acquisition of the emission spectra. In low temperature experiments, the windows of the pressure bomb were flushed with nitrogen to prevent condensation. All experiments (unless otherwise indicated) were carried out in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, with 2.0 μm mPrP-(121–231). The concentration of bis-ANS was 8.0 μm. Thermodynamic Parameters of Unfolding of mPrP(121–231)—ΔGuH2O (the free energy of unfolding in the absence of denaturant) and the m value, which measures the steepness of the dependence of the unfolding transition on the concentration of denaturant, were obtained from urea unfolding data using the linear extrapolation method (36.Greene R.F. Pace C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5388-5393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pressure unfolding data were analyzed using a two-state model for monomer unfolding. The dimensionless equilibrium unfolding constant at atmospheric pressure (K0) and the molar volume change of folding (ΔV) can be calculated from the following thermodynamic relation (31.Chapeaurouge A. Johansson J.S. Ferreira S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14861-14866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar),Kp=K0exp(pΔV/RT)(Eq. 1) where Kp is the unfolding constant at pressure p, and R and T have their usual meanings. The equation can be rewritten by introducing the degree of unfolding, αp, at pressure p,In[αp/(1-αp)]=lnK0+p(ΔV/RT)(Eq. 2) where ln[αp/(1 – αp)] equals ln Kp for the unfolding of a monomer. Thus, a plot of ln[αp/(1 – αp)] versus pressure yields the molar volume change of folding (ΔV) from the slope and ln K0 from the intercept on the ordinate. At constant pressure, the temperature dependence of the equilibrium constant for a two-state unfolding transition is described by the van't Hoff equation,ΔG/T=(1/T)ΔH-ΔS=-RlnKT(Eq. 3) where KT is the equilibrium constant for denaturation at temperature T, and ΔG is the corresponding Gibbs free-energy change. From a plot of ΔG/T versus the inverse temperature, the changes in enthalpy (ΔH) and entropy (ΔS) of unfolding can be extracted. In the present study, the equilibrium unfolding of the recombinant murine prion protein, mPrP-(121–231), was investigated using chemical and physical denaturants. mPrP-(121–231) corresponds to the structured 111-residue domain of the cellular prion protein, and its structure is the same as that in the context of the full-length protein (7.Riek R. Hornemann S. Wider G. Glockshuber R. Wüthrich K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 10.Riek R. Hornemann S. Wider R. Billeter M. Glockshuber R. Wüthrich K. Nature. 1996; 382: 180-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Wild-type mPrP-(121–231) does not exhibit a change in intrinsic fluorescence upon unfolding, probably because of the solvent-exposed location of the sole tryptophan residue (Trp-145) at the N terminus of α-helix 1 (26.Wildegger G. Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In the structure of wild-type mPrP-(121–231), Phe-175 is located in α-helix 2, with its side chain participating in the hydrophobic core of the protein (26.Wildegger G. Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Replacement of this Phe residue by a Trp residue allowed creation of a folding-sensitive fluorescent variant of mPrP-(121–231), known as variant F175W (26.Wildegger G. Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In contrast to the wild-type protein, the variant exhibits a 2.5-fold increase in intrinsic fluorescence upon unfolding (26.Wildegger G. Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In addition, the urea-induced unfolding of mPrP-(121–231) monitored by tryptophan fluorescence and circular dichroism has been shown to be a two-state transition, without detectable folding intermediates (26.Wildegger G. Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the equilibrium unfolding of F175W mPrP-(121–231) by urea monitored by both intrinsic and bis-ANS fluorescence intensities. In accord with a previous report (26.Wildegger G. Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), unfolding of mPrP-(121–231) took place between 4 and 8 m urea, with a 2.5-fold increase in intrinsic fluorescence emission and a transition mid-point at ∼5.5 m urea. The changes in intrinsic fluorescence were paralleled by changes in CD, as monitored by the loss of ellipticity at 222 nm (data not shown). The structural changes induced by urea in mPrP-(121–231) were also monitored by bis-ANS fluorescence. Bis-ANS is an environment-sensitive fluorescent dye that normally binds to exposed hydrophobic surfaces in partially folded intermediates more tightly than to both the native and random coil states of proteins (37.York S.S. Lawson R.C. Worah D.M. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4480-4486Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Binding to exposed hydrophobic domains in proteins brings about a large increase in bis-ANS fluorescence emission and a blue shift of the emission maximum (31.Chapeaurouge A. Johansson J.S. Ferreira S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14861-14866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 32.Chapeaurouge A. Johansson J.S. Ferreira S.T. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 39.Martins S.M. Chapeaurouge A. Ferreira S.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5484-5491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Titration of the native prion protein (2 μm) with bis-ANS (0–12 μm) showed saturation of bis-ANS binding sites at 4 μm bis-ANS, suggesting that there are two bis-ANS binding sites/molecule of prion protein (data not shown). Interestingly, maximal binding of bis-ANS to F175W mPrP-(121–231) occurred in the absence of urea (Fig. 1), indicating the exposure of hydrophobic patches on the protein surface in the native state. A similar result was obtained when binding of bis-ANS to wild-type mPrP was investigated (data not shown). Surprisingly, increasing concentrations of urea (between 1 and 4 m) caused a sharp decrease in bis-ANS fluorescence, whereas changes in intrinsic fluorescence emission (Fig. 1) and in CD (data not shown) only took place above 4 m urea. It is noteworthy that the fluorescence emission of bis-ANS in the presence of prion protein, at pH 7.0 and in the absence of urea, is 3- to 4-fold higher than the fluorescence of the free dye (Figs. 1 and 3, insets). In addition, the fluorescence of free bis-ANS hardly changes as a function of increasing urea concentrations (Fig. 1, inset), indicating that the decrease in bis-ANS fluorescence observed in Fig. 1 is not due to a direct effect of urea on the fluorescence intensity of the free dye. Importantly, previous studies have shown that the decrease in bis-ANS fluorescence at high urea concentrations is not due to competitive inhibition of bis-ANS-protein interactions (40.Horowitz P.M. Butler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2500-2504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that conformational changes causing disorganization of bis-ANS binding sites on the prion protein surface take place at lower concentrations of urea than those needed to bring about changes in the intrinsic fluorescence and secondary structure of mPrP. These observations challenge the notion that the transition between native and unfolded mPrP-(121–231), at atmospheric pressure and 25 °C, is a true two-state transition. In recent years, hydrostatic pressure and low temperatures have been used to stabilize partially folded intermediate states of proteins that are not detectable in the presence of chemical denaturants (for recent examples, see Refs. 29.Zhang J. Peng X. Jonas A. Jonas J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8631-8641Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 30.Sasahara K. Nitta K.

Chem. 2002; 277: 16478-16483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the pressure-assisted cold denaturation of F175W mPrP-(121–231). Compression of mPrP to 3.5 kbar at 25 °C and pH 7.0 caused a 40% decrease in intrinsic fluorescence emission (Fig. 2A). A similar result was obtained when wild-type mPrP (in which there is a single Trp residue at position 145) was compressed to 3.5 kbar under the same conditions (data not shown), indicating that the change in intrinsic fluorescence emission observed upon compression of mPrP reflects the effect of pressure on the fluorescence intensity of Trp-145. An 8-fold increase in bis-ANS fluorescence was observed upon compression of mPrP to 3.5 kbar at 25 °C and pH 7.0 (Fig. 2C), suggesting increased exposure of hydrophobic domains on the protein surface. To further investigate the existence of folding intermediates of F175W mPrP-(121–231), we carried out cold denaturation experiments under pressure. The freezing point of water is significantly decreased under pressure (41.Bridgman P.W. The Physics of High Pressure. G. Bell and Sons, Ltd., London1931: 233-243Google Scholar), allowing analysis of aqueous samples at sub-zero temperatures without the need for addition of cryosolvent additives. Fig. 2B shows that cooling the sample to –9 °C at 3.5 kbar of pressure reversed the decrease in intrinsic fluorescence emission of mPrP caused by pressure alone. Indeed, the fluorescence intensity of the sample at 1 atm and 25 °C was quite similar to that observed at –9 °C and 3.5 kbar. This suggests that the combined pressure/cold treatment did not lead to significant unfolding of mPrP. Interestingly, however, a marked (∼40-fold) increase in bis-ANS fluorescence was observed under the same conditions (Fig. 2D). Importantly, upon return of the sample to 25 °C and decompression, complete recoveries of both intrinsic and bis-ANS fluorescence emission were obtained, indicating reversible refolding of mPrP-(121–231) to a state qualitatively similar to the native-like protein (Fig. 2, open symbols). These results indicate that the combination of high pressure and low temperature induced a transition to a stable conformation, detected by greatly increased bis-ANS fluorescence, that is different from both the native and fully denatured states of mPrP. Control experiments showed that compression to 3.5 kbar at pH 7.0 led to ∼50% decrease in the fluorescence of free bis-ANS and that decreasing the temperature to –9 °C (at 3.5 kbar) caused a 50% increase in the fluorescence of the free dye (data not shown). These observations show that direct effects of pressure and temperature on the fluorescence intensity of free bis-ANS are not responsible for the results obtained in the presence of prion protein, supporting the view that the marked increase in bis-ANS fluorescence at elevated pressures and low temperature reflects a transition of the prion protein to a stable conformation, i.e. a folding intermediate. Fig. 3 shows the bis-ANS fluorescence emission spectra of native, compressed and cold-denatured states of F175W mPrP-(121–231). Remarkably, the large increase in bis-ANS fluorescence observed in the cold-denatured state at pH 7.0 is similar to that observed for F175W mPrP-(121–231) at 1 atm at pH 4.0 (Fig. 4). This suggests that the partially folded conformation of mPrP stabilized by high pressure and low temperature may be qualitatively similar to the conformation adopted by mPrP-(121–231) at acidic pH. Compression to 3.5 kbar at 25 °C and pH 7.0 was not sufficient to produce extensive unfolding of F175W mPrP (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, equilibrium unfolding experiments showed that urea concentrations up to 4 m are subdenaturing for mPrP-(121–231) (Fig. 1). Pressure unfolding experiments were then repeated in the presence of different subdenaturing concentrations of urea to poise the system toward unfolding. Addition of up to 3 m urea had little effect on the pressure sensitivity of mPrP-(121–231) (data not shown). However, pressure denaturation of F175W mPrP-(121–231) in the presence of 4 m urea exhibited a clearly defined plateau leveling at about 1.3-fold the intrinsic fluorescence intensity of the native protein (Fig. 5A). As noted above, fully unfolded F175W mPrP-(121–231) exhibits an increase of ∼2.5-fold in intrinsic fluorescence (Fig. 1). Thus, the plateau reached in the intrinsic fluorescence emission of the pressure-denatured state seems to correspond to a stable partially unfolded intermediate of mPrP. Interestingly, this partially unfolded intermediate does not bind bis-ANS (data not shown), suggesting disorganization of bis-ANS binding domains on the protein. Fig. 5B shows that lowering the temperature to –9"

Here we show that genotoxin-induced Chk1 activation requires Cut5 (Mus101/TopBP1) in a process that is independent of the role of Cut5 in DNA replication. Analysis of the role of Cut5 in checkpoint activation revealed that it associated with chromatin following DNA damage in a process that required RPA. Additionally, Cut5 was required for the recruitment of Atr, DNA polymerase α, and Rad1 but not RPA to chromatin following DNA damage. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Cut5 plays an integral role in the recruitment and assembly of the Chk1 signaling cascade components following DNA damage.

Activated Chk1 then stabilizes stalled replication forks and impedes S-phase progression by blocking the firing of origins of replication (10Zachos G. Rainey M.D. Gillespie D.A.

Although much progress has been made in the identification and ordering of checkpoint signaling proteins, it is clear that additional components also participate in the signaling pathways. Possible candidate participants in the pathways are the Cut5/Dpb11/Mus101 orthologs. Cut5 and Dpb11 were identified in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, respectively (13Araki H. Leem S.H. Phongdara A. Sugino A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11791-11795Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 14Saka Y. Yanagida M. Cell. 1993; 74: 383-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Although these proteins are required for DNA replication, they are also essential for activation of the replication checkpoint, indicating that they participate in checkpoint signaling. In higher eukaryotes, orthologs of Cut5 and Dpb11 have also been identified. Drosophila Mus101, human TopBP1, and Xenopus Cut5 (also known as Mus101) are highly related to one another and more distantly related to Cut5/Dpb11 (15Yamamoto R.R. Axton J.M. Yamamoto Y.

Likewise, human TopBP1 forms nuclear foci that co-localize with 53BP1, BRCA1, and NBS in response to replication arrest and ionizing radiation (20Yamane K. Wu X. Chen J. Mol. Cell.

In addition, human TopBP1 is phosphorylated by PIKKs in response to genotoxic stress and interacts with the checkpoint signaling proteins Rad9 and 53BP1 (20Yamane K. Wu X. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 21Makiniemi M. Hillukkala T. Tuusa J. Reini K. Vaara M. Huang D. Pospiech H. Majuri I. Westerling T. Makela T.P. Syvaoja J.E. J.

These observations suggest that the putative TopBP1/Mus101/Cut5 orthologs found in higher eukaryotes also participate cellular responses to DNA damage; however, the role of Cut5 orthologs in checkpoint signaling has not been explored. Besides their role in checkpoint activation, Cut5 orthologs are also required for DNA replication in yeast and higher eukaryotes (13Araki H. Leem S.H. Phongdara A. Sugino A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11791-11795Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 14Saka Y. Yanagida M. Cell. 1993; 74: 383-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 17Van Hatten R.A.

Detailed biochemical analyses of Cut5 in Xenopus egg extracts have shown that Cut5 is required for the loading of Cdc45 onto chromatin during the initiation of DNA replication (17Van Hatten R.A. Tutter A.V. Holway A.H. Khederian A.M. Walter J.C. Michael W.M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 18Hashimoto Y. Takisawa H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2526-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Cdc45 is recruited to pre-replication complexes following activation of the S-phase specific cyclin-dependent kinase (S-Cdk) and Cdc7-Dbf4 (17Van Hatten R.A. Tutter A.V. Holway A.H. Khederian A.M. Walter J.C. Michael W.M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 18Hashimoto Y. Takisawa H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2526-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Cdc45 then coordinates helicase-dependent DNA unwinding, the accumulation of the single-stranded DNA-binding protein replication protein A (RPA), and the loading of DNA polymerase α (Pol α) on chromatin. Despite the fact that Cut5 orthologs participate in both replication and activation of the replication checkpoint in the yeasts, it is unclear how these processes overlap in any organism. Here, we have used the biochemically tractable Xenopus egg extract system to explore the role of Cut5 in genotoxin-induced S-phase checkpoint activation. Using a method that bypasses the required role of Cut5 in replication initiation, we demonstrate that Cut5 is required for activation of the Chk1 signaling pathway and identify where Cut5 functions in this signaling pathway. Additionally, we show that the role of Cut5 in checkpoint activation differs from its role in DNA replication. Preparation of Antibodies—A glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Cut5 fusion protein (amino acids 972–1279 of Cut5) was used to immunize rabbits. Rad1 antibodies were a kind gift from K. Cimprich (4Lupardus P.J. Byun T. Yee M.C. Hekmat-Nejad M. Cimprich K.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2327-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Antisera for immunoblotting the p180 subunit of Pol α, RPA, and ORC2 were generously supplied by S. Waga, H. Takisawa, and J. Newport, respectively (22Waga S. Masuda T. Takisawa H. Sugino A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4978-4983Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 23Mimura S. Takisawa H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5699-5707Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 24Hua X.H. Yan H. Newport J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Antisera to immunodeplete RPA were prepared in rabbits with a GST-p70 fusion protein (amino acids 113–157 of the p70 RPA subunit). Anti-Atr antiserum was prepared by injecting rabbits with a GST-Atr fusion protein (amino acids 414–467). A full-length cDNA of Xenopus Cut5 was provided by H. Takisawa (18Hashimoto Y. Takisawa H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2526-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Recombinant p27 kip was prepared as described (25Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Cell. 1994; 78: 67-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). Extract Preparation, Immunodepletion, and Initiated Chromatin Isolation—Crude Xenopus egg extracts were prepared as described (26Walters J. Newport J. Cotterill S. Eukaryotic DNA Replication. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1999: 201-222Google Scholar). Extracts were immunodepleted by incubating 100 μl of extract with 60 μl of packed protein A-Sepharose beads pre-bound with 250 μl of anti-Cut5 or 500 μl of anti-RPA antiserum. Three rounds of immunodepletion were performed. To isolate initiated chromatin (IC), sperm chromatin (2000/μl) was incubated in crude egg extract for 25 min. Nuclei were then recovered by centrifugation (6000 × g, 15 min) through a 0.75 m sucrose cushion in ELB (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and resuspended in fresh extracts that had been pretreated as indicated. Chk1, Chk2, Replication, and Histone H1 Kinase Assay—To assess Chk1 activation, 35S-labeled, in vitro-translated, Myc-tagged Chk1-ΔKD (27Michael W.M. Ott R. Fanning E. Newport J. Science. 2000; 289: 2133-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) was added to 50 μl of mock- or depleted extract. Etoposide (30 μm) or aphidicolin (100 μg/ml) was then added, followed by the addition of IC to start the reaction. Samples were incubated for 60 min, and nuclei were then recovered by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 2 min) through a 0.75 m sucrose cushion in ELB and lysed in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA. Myc-Chk1-ΔKD was immunoprecipitated from clarified nuclear lysates using anti-Myc monoclonal antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P, and exposed to film to detect radiolabeled Chk1. Chk2 activation was assayed as described for Chk1 except that extracts were treated with the double-stranded break mimetic (dA·dT)70 (50 μg/ml) and supplemented with 35S-labeled, in vitro translated Xenopus Chk2-AU14. The Chk2-AU14 was constructed by PCR amplifying full-length Chk2 from a Xenopus laevis oocyte cDNA library (Clontech, 5′-STRETCH PLUS), appending four copies of the AU1 epitope to the carboxyl terminus of Chk2, and inserting the construct into pcDNA3 (Clontech). Replication and histone H1 kinase assays were carried out as described (28Murray A.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 581-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Chromatin and Oligonucleotide Binding Assay—To assay Atr, RPA, Rad1, and Pol α binding to chromatin, IC was added to 50 μl of extracts (pretreated as indicated) and incubated for 1 h. The samples were then resuspended in chromatin extraction buffer (50 mm KCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.15 mm spermine, 2 mm dithiothreitol), layered over a 30% sucrose cushion, and centrifuged (6000 × g, 15 min). Pellets were resuspended in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted for the indicated proteins. Cut5 chromatin binding assays were performed using the same procedures except that 100 mm KCl and 0.25% Triton X-100 were used in the chromatin extraction buffer. For the oligonucleotide binding assays, 50 μl of extract was incubated with vehicle or 100 ng/μl biotinylated poly(dA)70 (7Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). After a 30-min incubation, extracts were diluted in 500 μl of oligonucleotide binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 1 mm sodium orthovandate). Following centrifugation, the diluted extracts were incubated with 10 μl of packed streptavidin-conjugated beads for 1 h and washed three times with oligonucleotide binding buffer. Bound proteins were immunoblotted as indicated. To analyze the role of Cut5 in replication and checkpoint activation in Xenopus interphase extracts, we prepared anti-Cut5 antibodies that immunoblotted a 170-kDa protein in extracts (Fig. 1A) and immunoprecipitated a protein of identical molecular weight following in vitro translation of Xenopus Cut5 (data not shown). The antibodies also immunodepleted Cut5 from extracts (Fig. 1A). Cut5 is essential for the initiation of DNA replication in Xenopus egg extracts (17Van Hatten R.A. Tutter A.V. Holway A.H. Khederian A.M. Walter J.C. Michael W.M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 18Hashimoto Y. Takisawa H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2526-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Thus, immunodepletion of Cut5 would prevent entry into S-phase and preclude an examination of its role in genotoxin-induced cell cycle arrest. The fact that Cut5 is required for replication initiation but not elongation (17Van Hatten R.A. Tutter A.V. Holway A.H. Khederian A.M. Walter J.C. Michael W.M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 18Hashimoto Y. Takisawa H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2526-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) suggested that we could initiate replication in the presence of Cut5 and then analyze genotoxin-induced cell cycle arrest in its absence. To confirm that Cut5 was only required for initiation of DNA replication, we prepared “initiated” Xenopus sperm chromatin (IC) by incubating chromatin in extracts for 25 min to allow initiation of DNA replication (Fig. 1B). IC was then isolated by centrifugation through a 30% sucrose cushion. As described previously (17Van Hatten R.A. Tutter A.V. Holway A.H. Khederian A.M. Walter J.C. Michael W.M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 18Hashimoto Y. Takisawa H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2526-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), chromatin-bound Cut5 was removed during the isolation of IC and was not transferred to the Cut5-depleted extract (Fig. 1C). Replication was analyzed by adding IC to mock- or Cut5-depleted extracts. As a control, we compared the replication of the IC to the replication of sperm chromatin (uninitiated chromatin) in mock- or Cut5-depleted extracts. Pulse labeling of the extracts with [α-32P]dATP to detect DNA synthesis revealed that Cut5 was required for the replication of uninitiated chromatin. In contrast, replication of IC did not require Cut5 (Fig. 1D). We then asked whether the replication that occurred when IC was transferred to the mock- or Cut5-depleted extract was due to elongation or the firing of new origins. To block origin firing, we used p27 kip , which inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase 2 and thereby prevents the firing of additional origins. The replication of uninitiated chromatin was blocked by the addition of p27 kip (Fig. 1D). In contrast, addition of p27 kip had no effect on [α-32P]dATP incorporation into IC, demonstrating that DNA synthesis in the IC was due to elongation. We then assessed whether Cut5 participates in checkpoint-mediated, genotoxin-induced cell cycle arrest. We added IC to control extracts or extracts containing the DNA topoisomerase II poison etoposide and monitored entry into mitosis by examining the Cdc2-CyclinB1-catalyzed phosphorylation of histone H1. As shown in Fig. 1E, etoposide delayed the appearance of histone H1 kinase activity, and this delay was blocked by caffeine, a well characterized checkpoint disrupter (29Sarkaria J.N. Busby E.C.

Biol. 1999; 9: 1135-1138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Immunodepletion of Cut5 was as effective as caffeine in abrogating the checkpoint, demonstrating that Cut5 plays a critical role in activation of the replication checkpoint. Chk1 is a key mediator of the genotoxin-activated S-phase checkpoint (11Heffernan T.P. Simpson D.A. Frank A.R. Heinloth A.N. Paules R.S. Cordeiro-Stone M. Kaufmann W.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8552-8561Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 12Guo N. Faller D.V. Vaziri C. Cell Growth Differ. 2002; 13: 77-86PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the results described above raised the possibility that etoposide activates Chk1. To determine whether etoposide activated Chk1, we added chromatin to extract containing etoposide, and, as a positive control, to extract containing aphidicolin, an inhibitor of DNA replication. We then assessed Chk1 activation using a radiolabeled Chk1 fragment that undergoes a phosphorylation-dependent mobility shift when analyzed by SDS-PAGE (27Michael W.M. Ott R. Fanning E. Newport J. Science. 2000; 289: 2133-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Chk1 was robustly phosphorylated in response to etoposide and aphidicolin (Fig. 2A). Chk1 activation is triggered by stalled replication in extracts (4Lupardus P.J. Byun T. Yee M.C. Hekmat-Nejad M. Cimprich K.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2327-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 27Michael W.M. Ott R. Fanning E. Newport J. Science. 2000; 289: 2133-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 32Stokes M.P. Van Hatten R. Lindsay H.D. Michael W.M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 863-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and etoposide toxicity is due in large part to the collision of replication forks with topoisomerase II-etoposide-stabilized complexes (33D'Arpa P. Beardmore C. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6919-6924PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that etoposide, like aphidicolin, might activate Chk1 by stalling replication forks. Thus, we assessed the role of DNA replication in Chk1 activation by adding uninitiated chromatin to extracts containing p27 kip. Neither etoposide nor aphidicolin activated Chk1 when origin firing was suppressed (Fig. 2A), demonstrating that etoposide-induced Chk1 activation requires DNA replication. Cut5 is required at an early step in the initiation of replication, including the loading of Pol α (17Van Hatten R.A. Tutter A.V. Holway A.H. Khederian A.M. Walter J.C. Michael W.M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 18Hashimoto Y. Takisawa H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2526-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Because DNA replication and Pol α activity are required for Chk1 activation in extracts (4Lupardus P.J. Byun T. Yee M.C. Hekmat-Nejad M. Cimprich K.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2327-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 27Michael W.M. Ott R. Fanning E. Newport J. Science. 2000; 289: 2133-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 32Stokes M.P. Van Hatten R. Lindsay H.D. Michael W.M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 863-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), depletion of Cut5 would block not only replication but also Chk1 activation. To overcome this limitation, we again used IC to ask whether Cut5 played a role in Chk1 activation. IC was incubated in mock- and Cut5-immunodepleted extracts that contained vehicle or etoposide (Fig. 2B). Although Chk1 was efficiently activated by etoposide in mock-depleted extracts during a 60-min incubation, Chk1 was not activated when Cut5 was absent (Fig. 2B). Even when the reactions were incubated for up to 220 min after the addition of etoposide, Chk1 was still not activated (data not shown), demonstrating that the absence of Cut5 did not slow the process of Chk1 activation. The addition of recombinant, in vitro translated Cut5 restored etoposide-induced Chk1 activation, whereas in vitro translated luciferase did not, demonstrating that the Chk1 activation defect is due to the loss of Cut5 (Fig. 2C). To ensure that the role of Cut5 in checkpoint activation was not limited to etoposide, we showed that aphidicolin-induced Chk1 activation also required Cut5 (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these results establish that Cut5 plays a critical role in the activation of Chk1, and this role is independent of the function of Cut5 in the initiation of DNA replication. In human cells, ionizing radiation induces the accumulation of Cut5 in nuclear foci and Cut5 is phosphorylated by Atm (20Yamane K. Wu X. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 21Makiniemi M. Hillukkala T. Tuusa J. Reini K. Vaara M. Huang D. Pospiech H. Majuri I. Westerling T. Makela T.P. Syvaoja J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30399-30406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that Cut5 participates in the Atm-Chk2 signaling pathway activated by double-strand DNA breaks. However, Cut5 was not required for Chk2 activation induced by a double-strand DNA break mimetic (Fig. 2E), suggesting that Cut5 may play an alternate role in cellular responses to double-strand breaks. Numerous studies characterizing the biochemical steps leading to Chk1 activation have shown that Atr and the 9-1-1 complex are independently recruited to chromatin (4Lupardus P.J. Byun T. Yee M.C. Hekmat-Nejad M. Cimprich K.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2327-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 5You Z. Kong L. Newport J. J. Biol.

In this process, DNA damage leads to the accumulation of RPA-coated single-stranded DNA, an event that precedes and is required for the binding of ATR and Pol α to the chromatin (34Walters J. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 617-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Chromatin-bound Pol α is then required for the binding of the 9-1-1 complex after Pol α-mediated RNA primer synthesis (5You Z. Kong L. Newport J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27088-27093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Once bound, the 9-1-1 complex and Atr mediate Chk1 activation. We reasoned that Cut5, like other checkpoint signaling proteins, might also associate with chromatin. Correspondingly, we found that Cut5 binding to uninitiated chromatin was dramatically induced by etoposide treatment (Fig. 3A), suggesting that Cut5 might participate in the chromatin binding of other checkpoint signaling proteins. Thus, we asked whether Cut5 was required for the binding of Atr, Pol α, Rad1, and RPA to chromatin following DNA damage. IC was added to mock- and Cut5-depleted extracts in the presence or absence of etoposide (Fig. 3B). Following incubation for 60 min, chromatin was then purified to assess checkpoint protein association. Like other genotoxins, etoposide induced RPA, Atr, Pol α, and Rad1 chromatin binding (Fig. 3B). In contrast, RPA chromatin binding did not require Cut5. This finding raised the possibility that Cut5 chromatin binding might depend on RPA. Accordingly, immunodepletion of RPA (Fig. 3C) blocked etoposide-induced Cut5 activation (Fig. 3D), demonstrating that Cut5 is recruited to chromatin following DNA damage in a process that requires RPA. Taken together, these results suggest a model in which RPA-coated single-stranded DNA recruits Cut5, which, in turn, facilitates the binding of Atr, Pol α, and Rad1 to chromatin in response to genotoxic stress. The results presented above indicated that RPA is required for Cut5 chromatin binding. This contrasts with the situation during DNA replication, where Cut5 is required for the recruitment of RPA to chromatin (17Van Hatten R.A. Tutter A.V. Holway A.H. Khederian A.M. Walter J.C. Michael W.M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 18Hashimoto Y. Takisawa H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2526-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Thus, these findings suggest that Cut5 performs different roles in the firing of replication origins and the activation of the Chk1 signaling pathway. To further explore this possibility, we used single-stranded, biotinylated oligonucleotide poly(dA)70 that binds Atr in a process that requires RPA (7Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). However, poly(dA)70 is not replicated in extracts and does not activate Chk1 (35Guo Z. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 11: 1535-1546Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 36Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol.

Because no DNA replication occurs in this system, we examined whether Cut5 was required for the binding of Atr and Pol α to poly(dA)70. As shown in Fig. 3E, the oligonucleotide bound RPA and Atr in mock-depleted extracts; however, it did not bind Pol α, consistent with the observation that the oligonucleotide does not activate Chk1 (36Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In contrast, analysis of the role of Cut5 in Atr binding revealed that Cut5 was required for Atr poly(dA)70 binding but not for RPA binding to the oligonucleotide. Taken together with the results in Fig. 3B, these findings demonstrate that Cut5 facilitates the RPA-dependent binding of Atr to chromatin and to the poly(dA)70 oligonucleotide. Additionally, because Pol α was not recruited to the oligonucleotide, they further support the notion that the role of Cut5 in checkpoint complex assembly differs from its role in DNA replication. Recent studies have demonstrated that DNA damage induces the accumulation of checkpoint signaling proteins on chromatin. However, it has remained unclear how the assembly of these proteins is coordinated. The present studies show that Cut5 is a critical intermediate in the assembly of the checkpoint signaling machinery and they suggest a model for the role of Cut5 in the assembly of the signaling machinery. In this model (Fig. 4), single-stranded DNA, such as that generated at a stalled replication fork, is coated with RPA, leading to Cut5 chromatin association. Cut5 then facilitates the chromatin association of Atr and Pol α, which, in turn, leads to the loading of the 9–1-1 complex. A key feature of our studies is the observation that Cut5 is essential for the binding of both Atr and Pol α to stalled replication forks, two fundamental events in checkpoint activation. The role of Cut5 in this process may be 2-fold. One the one hand, Cut5 facilitates the loading of Pol α, which is then required for the loading of the 9-1-1 complex. On the other hand, Cut5 also recruits Atr. Two observations suggest that the recruitment of Atr and Pol α to chromatin can be mechanistically separated. First, Atr chromatin binding does not require Pol α (5You Z. Kong L. Newport J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27088-27093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Second, the binding of Atr to the single-stranded poly(dA)70 oligonucleotide occurred in the absence of Pol α binding, and this process required Cut5. Collectively, these results suggest that Cut5 may serve as a central integrator that recruits key elements of the checkpoint signaling machinery to regions of RPA-coated single-stranded DNA that are generated in response to DNA lesions.

ClpX binds and, subsequently, unfolds and translocates substrate proteins into the ClpP chamber in an ATP-dependent manner. Other Clp/Hsp100 chaperones in E. coli include ClpA and ClpB. Both ClpA and ClpB have an NH2-terminal domain followed by two AAA domains. ClpA also binds as a hexamer to ClpP oligomer, while ClpB does not seem to associate with any proteases. The N-domain of ClpA has been shown to be important for substrate binding (24.Lo J.H. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 551-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) as well as for the binding of the cofactor ClpS (25.Dougan D.A. Reid B.G. Horwich A.L. Bukau B. Mol.

In an earlier paper (31.Wojtyra U. Thibault G. Tuite A. Houry W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48981-48990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we had shown that the NH2-terminal domain of ClpX is a C4-type ZBD involved in substrate and cofactor recognition. ZBD was shown to form a very stable dimer that is essential for promoting the degradation of some typical ClpXP substrates such as γO and MuA, but not green fluorescent protein-SsrA. Additional studies have shown that ZBD contains an essential binding site for the γO substrate and for the cofactor SspB. Removal of ZBD from the ClpX sequence renders the ATPase activity of ClpX largely insensitive to the presence of ClpP, substrates, or SspB cofactor. All these results indicate that ZBD plays an essential role in the ClpX mechanism of function and that ATP binding and/or hydrolysis drives a conformational change in ClpX involving ZBD. As a subsequent step toward further characterizing the role of ZBD in the ClpX function, we have determined the solution structure of the ZBD homodimer using NMR methods. Although the structure of the monomeric subunit is well represented in the Protein Data Bank, the structure of the ZBD dimer is unique. The overall shape and internal symmetry observed for the ZBD dimer led us to create a trimer-of-dimers model with a ring-like structure that complements the topology of the ClpX ATPase domain. Protein Expression and Purification—Standard molecular biology techniques were used to construct a gene fragment encoding an aminoterminal Gly-His6 tag followed by residues 1–60 of E. coli ClpX (residue number according to Swiss-Prot) that encompass the zinc binding domain. This fragment, flanked by NcoI and BamHI restriction sites, was inserted into pET28b (Novagen) for expression in E. coli BL21(DE3). A 2 L culture was incubated in a BioFlo 110 fermentor (New Brunswick Scientific) with [15N]ammonium chloride and [13C]glucose as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources following a published fermentation protocol (32.Cai M. Huang Y. Sakaguchi K. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Craigie R. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 11: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Divalent zinc was present as a trace mineral during the fermentation. Purification of ZBD was achieved by nickel affinity chromatography (Qiagen) and S-100 gel filtration (Amersham Biosciences). Gel Filtration and Protein Cross-linking—Size exclusion chromatography was performed using a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 (Amersham Biosciences) column attached to an AKTA FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). The column was equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Molecular mass standards (Sigma) used were: thryoglobulin (669 kDa), apoferritin (443 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (21 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.4 kDa). All runs were performed at 4 °C, and the absorbance was monitored at 280 nm. For cross-linking, glutaraldehyde was added to a final concentration of 0.05% to a 30 μm solution of ZBD in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 100 μm ZnCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Cross-linking was allowed to proceed for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Circular Dichroism Spectra—CD spectra were obtained using an AVIV circular dichroism spectrometer model 62ADS equipped with a temperature controlled sample holder. The average of three spectra is reported, where each spectrum was collected by averaging the signal at every 1 nm for 1 s. Protein samples were measured in a 1-mm path length cuvette at a concentration of 30 μm. NMR Spectroscopy—Samples for NMR spectroscopy contained 0.6–1.2 mm ZBD monomer in 10% D2O, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.02% sodium azide. Backbone and side chain assignments were obtained using a combination of 15N-HSQC, 13C-HSQC, HNCO, HNCACB, H(CCO)NH-TOCSY, C(CO)NH-TOCSY, and (Hβ)C-β(CγCδ)Hδ/Hϵ spectra recorded on 500 MHz Varian Inova and 600 MHz Bruker Avance NMR spectrometers at 30 °C. Data were processed and interpreted using NMRPipe (33.Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol.

This hybrid sample was prepared by mixing equimolar quantities of unlabeled and isotopically labeled ZBD in the presence of 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride followed by rapid dilution into a 40-fold excess of NMR sample buffer to induce folding. Structure Calculations and Model Building—Backbone dihedral angles were predicted from chemical shift information using the TALOS method (36.Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). One Zn(II) ion was coordinated tetrahedrally to Cys14, Cys17, Cys36, and Cys39 by a combination of bond and angle constraints. Initial structures from NOE and dihedral angle restraints were calculated using a modified ARIA 1.2 protocol (37.Linge J.P. O'Donoghue S.I. Nilges M.

Chemical shift assignments have been deposited in the BioMagResBank under accession code 5665. Structure of ZBD Monomeric Subunit—The structure of ZBD was solved based on 565 intramolecular NOE observations and data base derived torsion angle restraints (Table I). Resonances from the first ten residues and the last two residues of ZBD were either unobservable or unassignable indicating that these regions were largely unstructured (Figs. 1 and 2). Measurements of the amide heteronuclear 1H-15N NOEs, which are sensitive to bond motions occurring faster than overall rotational correlation time of the molecule, indicate that the folded ZBD core spans residues Leu11–Arg48 (Fig. 1). The core of ZBD is organized into two hairpins (Tyr13 to Ser20; Lys26 to Ser36) followed by one α-helix (D37 to I46). No long range (i, i + 4) NOEs were observed from Arg48 to His57.Table IStatistics for the ensemble of structures calculated for the dimeric ZBD of ClpXDistance restraints: Intramolecular, unambiguousIntraresidue216Sequential (i - j = 1)143Medium range (2 ≤ i - j ≤ 4)56Long range (4 < i - j)60Hydrogen bonds (HN-O, N-O)12 Intramolecular, ambiguous90 Intermolecular47Dihedral angle restraints: φ/ψ pairs30Pairwise r.m.s.d.

Although ZBD and the NH2-terminal DNA binding domain of GATA-1 (45.Omichinski J.G. Clore G.M. Schaad O. Felsenfeld G. Trainor C. Appella E. Stahl S.J. Gronenborn A.M.

Treble clef zinc fingers are characterized by two β-hairpins and one α-helix. Among members of the treble clef zinc finger family, a Zn(II) ion is coordinated by two residues in the first β-hairpin, one residue in the second β-hairpin and one residues in the NH2 terminus of the α-helix. In ZBD, four cysteines (Cys14, Cys17, Cys36, and Cys39) are involved in the coordination of one Zn(II) ion per monomer (31.Wojtyra U. Thibault G. Tuite A. Houry W.A. J. Biol.

Despite that only six residues are similar between the treble clef zinc fingers of ClpX and chicken GATA-1, with four of these residues being the coordinating cysteines, the Cα atoms of ZBD and GATA-1 (Protein Data Bank code 1GAT) superimpose with an r.m.s.d. of 1.9 Å. On the other hand, according to CE (47.Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Protein Eng. 1988; 11: 739-747Crossref Scopus (1702) Google Scholar) and DALI (48.Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar) search engines using a 3-Å similarity threshold, the ZBD dimer is not related to any protein fold that has been described to date. The Dimer Interface—The ZBD dimer (Fig. 2) is defined by 47 intermolecular NOEs originating predominantly from a hydrophobic cluster consisting of Phe16, Ile28, Val33, Ile35, Val40, Cys43, and Ile47 (Fig. 2C). From an alignment of 100 bacterial ClpX NH2-terminal sequences (Fig. 3), this hydrophobic cluster is well conserved suggesting a strong evolutionary pressure to maintain the dimeric form. In contrast, monomeric chicken GATA-1 does not possess these sequence signatures (Fig. 1). As calculated by MOLMOL (40.Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (51–55): 29-32Crossref Scopus (6498) Google Scholar) each monomer has a solvent accessible surface area of 3242 Å and contributes 945 Å2 to the dimer interface. Dimerization brings the sole α-helices from each monomer together in an anti-parallel orientation when viewed from one symmetry axis, and the second β-hairpins (Fig. 1) together along a second symmetry axis (Fig. 2). The nature and extent of the interface explain why the ZBD dimer is very stable (ΔGU = 9.9 kcal/mol at 25 °C) and does not dissociate into monomers even at 1 μm concentrations (31.Wojtyra U.

To further characterize the sequence elements involved in the dimer interface, ZBD-(1–60) (residues 1–60) and different truncations of ZBD were analyzed by size exclusion chromatography. ZBD-(1–60) migrated as a dimer in a single peak as determined by cross-linking: cross-linked ZBD-(1–60) migrated mainly at the same position as the non-cross-linked sample (second panel from top in Fig. 4A). Mutating Cys43 to alanine or serine did not affect the migration pattern of ZBD-(1–60), indicating that this fifth cysteine in the ClpX sequence is not involved in the dimerization of ZBD. Removal of residues 1–13 preceding the first cysteine or residues 54–60 after the α-helix also did not affect ZBD dimerization. ZBD-(14–60) was not very stable and had a tendency to aggregate in a time-dependent manner, while ZBD-(1–53) represents the fragment identified by Singh et al. (22.Singh S.K. Rozycki J. Ortega J. Ishikawa T. Lo J. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29420-29429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Only the truncation of the α-helix, represented by ZBD-(1–41), weakened the affinity between the monomers and as a result both monomers and dimers could be detected (second panel from bottom in Fig. 4A). The results of the size exclusion chromatography were further substantiated by CD scans of the different truncation mutants (Fig. 4, B and C). Analysis of the CD spectra of all the mutants examined indicated that their secondary structure content were similar to that of ZBD-(1–60) except for ZBD-(1–41), which had little α-helical content and increased β content (Fig. 4C) as expected from the structure (Fig. 2). Evolutionary Aspects of the ZBD Structure—ClpA and ClpB are two other members of the Clp/Hsp100 family of proteins in E. coli. ClpA and ClpB have an NH2-terminal domain of about 140–150 residues followed by two ATPase domains (49.Hoskins J.R. Sharma S. Sathyanarayana B.K. Wickner S. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 59: 413-429Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). ClpA proteins, which lack the NH2-terminal domain, can mediate the ClpP dependent degradation of SsrA-tagged substrates (22.Singh S.K. Rozycki J. Ortega J. Ishikawa T. Lo J. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R.

Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 551-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The NH2 terminus of ClpA is also important for cofactor binding such as ClpS (25.Dougan D.A. Reid B.G. Horwich A.L. Bukau B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 673-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). On the other hand, ClpB lacking its NH2 terminus was shown to be either inactive or active as a chaperone in vitro depending on the assay being used (26.Barnett M.E. Zolkiewska A. Zolkiewski M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37565-37571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The structures of the ClpA and ClpB NH2-terminal domains have been solved by x-ray crystallographic methods (30.Guo F. Maurizi M.R. Esser L. Xia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46743-46752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 50.Zeth K. Ravelli R.B. Paal K. Cusack S. Bukau B. Dougan D.A. Nat. Struct.

The structures of the two domains reveal two four-helix tandem repeats, about 70 residues in length, with pseudo 2-fold symmetry. Despite the lack of sequence and secondary structure conservation, the ClpX ZBD dimer and the NH2-terminal domains of ClpA and ClpB have a similar overall general topology (Fig. 5). The dimerization of the NH2 terminus of ClpX and the formation of a pseudodimer by the NH2-terminal domains of ClpA and ClpB may have been the result of a series of convergent evolutionary events. In ClpX, dimerization is facilitated by the self-association of the treble clef zinger motifs from two separate molecules, while the formation of the pseudo dimer by the NH2-terminal domains of ClpA and ClpB is promoted by a tandemly repeated motif. Alternatively, if a divergent evolutionary relationship is assumed to exist among the ClpX ZBD and the NH2-terminal domains of ClpA and ClpB, it presupposes a common structural ancestor. In this scenario, a clpX-like gene would have inserted itself into another clpX-like gene at a location corresponding to the linker region between ZBD and the AAA domains. This has also been proposed by Guo et al. (30.Guo F. Maurizi M.R. Esser L. Xia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46743-46752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 52.Guo F. Esser L. Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. Xia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46753-46762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Following this view, two similarly positioned antiparallel α-helices in the ClpX ZBD dimer and in the NH2-terminal pseudodimer of ClpA and ClpB (the helices facing the reader in Fig. 5) could be considered a vestigal element of a distantly related progenitor. It is intriguing to note that the NH2-terminal domain of ClpA has the rudiments of zinc binding via two histidines, one glutamic acid, and a water molecule (52.Guo F. Esser L. Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. Xia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46753-46762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) rather than four cysteines as in the case of ClpX. In any case, it is important to emphasize that there is no strutural similarity between the ClpX ZBD dimer and the NH2-terminal domains of ClpA and ClpB. The Trimer-of-Dimers Model of ZBD—Electron microscopy studies demonstrate that the ClpX ATPase domain forms hexamers in the presence or absence of ZBD (22.Singh S.K. Rozycki J. Ortega J. Ishikawa T. Lo J. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29420-29429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 27.Ortega J. Singh S.K. Ishikawa T. Maurizi M.R. Steven A.C. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1515-1521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). As the ZBD forms dimers when segregated from ClpX, the ClpX hexamer may be considered as a trimer-of-dimers. When ZBD is viewed in an orientation shown in Fig. 2, there is an element of 3-fold symmetry where the second β-hairpins cross. Building on this observation, a simple 3-fold rotation of the dimer produces a ring-like model whose subunits complement each other well (Fig. 6A). Although this model is purely speculative, arrangement of three ClpX ZBD dimers in this manner produces a structure that agrees with the structural and functional organization expected for the ClpXP complex. This model satisfies the 3-fold symmetry of the structure, creates a ring structure that is consistent with the other parts of ClpX and with ClpP, and minimizes steric clashes. When the ZBD trimer-of-dimers model is viewed from the side of the ring, a second 3-fold symmetry element is apparent. This element is composed of three two-stranded anti-parallel β sheets. Two of the β sheets are derived from each of the monomers in the ZBD dimer, while the third β sheet is created from an intermolecular interaction between residues Leu11–Tyr13 of adjacent dimers. In the dimeric ZBD structure, residues Leu11–Tyr13 are deemed to be in an extended conformation as evidenced by relatively lower 1H{15N} heteronuclear NOE values; however, backbone chemical shift analysis suggests that they form a short β-strand. In light of the proposed hexameric model, a degree of conformational freedom in Leu11–Tyr13 would facilitate the interaction of β-strands from two adjacent ZBD dimers. As can be seen from the space-filling representation of the hexameric model (Fig. 6A), much of the possible interdimer interactions are localized to this region. We further speculate that the entropic cost of ordering Leu11–Tyr13 might reduce the possibility of formation of the hexameric state until further stabilizing conditions such as substrate binding are met. The space-filling model of the ZBD trimer-of-dimers also highlights a central pore of about 14 Å in diameter. The residues that comprise the pore in this model are predominantly hydrophobic. If the ClpX ATPase domain is modeled on the solved structure of the HslU ATPase domain (53.Bochtler M. Hartmann C. Song H.K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 2000; 403: 800-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 54.Wang J. Song J.J. Franklin M.C. Kamtekar S. Im Y.J. Rho S.H. Seong I.S. Lee C.S. Chung C.H. Eom S.H.

Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 1107-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), then the pore lined by the GYVG sequence motif has an approximate diameter of 25 Å. The outer diameter of the ZBD hexamer is 60 Å or approximately half the distance of the modeled ATPase domain (Fig. 6B). From Arg48, the last structured residue observed in the ZBD dimer, to Ala62, which represents the modeled NH2-terminal boundary of the AAA domain, a 14-residue linker remains. If this linker is extended in the ClpX hexamer, three ZBD dimers are afforded a considerable degree of flexibility, assuming 3.6 Å per residue (56.Creighton T.E. Proteins: Structures and Molecular Properties. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1993: 1-47Google Scholar). Mechanistically, such conformational freedom would allow the ZBD dimers to reach out from the ATPase ring toward a substrate protein. The trimer-of-dimers model of ZBD may represent a closed conformation of ClpX. We speculate that in this state, an unfolded substrate protein would be trapped underneath the ZBD lid forcing the substrate to be translocated into the ClpP chamber. The sequence of events producing movement of the ZBD to form the closed conformation likely requires ATP binding and/or hydrolysis in the ATPase domain of ClpX. Since it has been shown that ZBD has low affinity to the rest of ClpX (22.Singh S.K. Rozycki J. Ortega J. Ishikawa T. Lo J. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29420-29429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), the linker between ZBD and the AAA domain might play a major role in communicating the conformational changes between these two domains. If the trimer-of-dimers model of ZBD (Fig. 6A) represents the closed conformation of ClpX, then it follows that an open conformation of the chaperone exists where the dimers are apart ready to capture an incoming substrate protein or to bind a cofactor. Experiments are under way to test these hypotheses. Zinc fingers in proteins that interact with DNA or RNA are among the best studied domains, but, more recently, it is becoming clear that zinc fingers can also mediate protein-protein interactions (57.Mackay J.P. Crossley M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there are several known cases of zinc fingers that form homo- or heterodimers (58.McCarty A.S. Kleiger G. Eisenberg D. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The ClpX ZBD dimer represents another such case. The structure of the ClpX ZBD provides insight as to how chaperones with multiple AAA domains, such as ClpA and ClpB, are guided evolutionarily toward a common function. Furthermore, the structure also sheds some light on the possible conformational changes that ClpX might undergo during its functional cycle.

The data indicate that multiple and distinct determinants of selectivity exist for individual receptors. While the A1 adenosine receptor does not distinguish between Gi1α and Gtα sequences, the 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B serotonin and M2 muscarinic receptors can couple with Gi1 but not Gt. It is possible to distinguish domains that eliminate coupling and are defined as “critical,” from those that impair coupling and are defined as “important.” Domains within the N terminus, α4-helix, and α4-helix-α4/β6-loop of Gi1α are involved in 5-HT and M2 receptor interactions. Chimeric Gi1α/Gqα subunits verify the critical role of the Gα C terminus in receptor coupling, however, the individual receptors differ in the C-terminal amino acids required for coupling. Furthermore, the EC50 for interactions with Gi1 differ among the individual receptors. These results suggest that coupling selectivity ultimately involves subtle and cooperative interactions among various domains on both the G-protein and the associated receptor as well as the G-protein concentration.

J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28308-28313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) are involved in receptor-coupling selectivity. Some of these domains contact the receptor directly, while others regulate receptor-coupling selectivity indirectly by playing a role in nucleotide exchange. Despite the fact that many of the receptor-interacting domains have been identified, the relationship between receptor subtypes and Gα domains involved in receptor coupling has not been clearly established. Thus, it is difficult to predict which Gα domains will be utilized by a specific receptor. Here we propose that individual receptors recognize specific patterns formed by amino acids of Gα thus making G-protein interface look different for different receptors. The C terminus of Gα is a well accepted receptor recognition domain, which contacts receptors directly (17.Conklin B.R. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1993; 73: 631-641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Although individual C-terminal amino acids important for receptor coupling have been identified in several Gα subunits, the specific Gα amino acids participating in receptor recognition may differ among receptors. The α4-helix-α4/β6-loop domain, first described as an effector domain, has been shown to be important for 5-HT1B receptor coupling to Gi1 (11.Bae H. Anderson K. Flood L.A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Graber S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32071-32077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Later it was demonstrated that Gln-304 and Glu-308 in the α4-helix of Gi1α are important for 5-HT1B receptor coupling (18.Bae H. Cabrera-Vera T.M. Depree K.M. Graber S.G. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14963-14971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However the generality of the role for the α4-helix-α4/β6-loop domain in receptor coupling selectivity has not been determined.Gi1α and Gtα are closely related Gα subunits, which belong to the Gi/o class of G-protein α-subunits, share 68% homology, and have nearly identical overall structures. Although the 5-HT1B receptor discriminates between Gi1 and Gt (11.Bae H. Anderson K. Flood L.A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Graber S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32071-32077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 19.Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), the fact that their C termini are identical render Gi1α/Gtα chimeras useless for exploring the role of this domain in receptor coupling. However, the extreme C terminus of Gqα differs from that of Gi1α by four amino acids, while their α5-helices differ by an additional nine amino acids. Thus Gi1α/Gqα chimeras are ideal for studying the role of this domain in coupling. Since several different GPCRs can couple to the same G-protein, we wanted to test the hypothesis that individual receptors utilize slightly different domains on Gα subunits to achieve coupling. G-protein receptor coupling selectivity may also be regulated at the level of G-protein concentration. In fact, Clawges et al. (20.Clawges H.M. Depree K.M. Parker E.M. Graber S.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12930-12938Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) demonstrated that 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors distinguish themselves by the affinity with which they interact with G-proteins. Therefore we also wanted to test the generality of this mechanism with different receptors. Here we compare the coupling behavior of four Gi/o-coupled receptors (5-HT1A and 5-HT1B serotonin, A1 adenosine and M2 muscarinic) by reconstituting them with G-protein heterotrimers containing native or chimeric Gα subunits composed of Gαi1, Gαt, and Gαq. Our data demonstrate that selective coupling between Gi1 and the members of Gi/o-coupled receptor family is directed by multiple and distinct Gα domains and is regulated at the level of G-protein concentration.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—[3H]Oxotremorine-M acetate ([3H]OXO-M) (85.8 Ci/mmol), [3H]hydroxytryptamine binoxalate (5-[3H]HT) (25.5 Ci/mmol), and chloro-N6-[3H]cyclopentyladenosine ([3H]CCPA) (30 Ci/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Science Products, Inc.

Figler R.A. Kalman-Maltese V.K. Robishaw J.D. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13123-13126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To prepare membranes, harvested cells were thawed in 15× their wet weight of ice-cold homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0 at 4 °C, 25 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml of benzamidine, and 2 μg/ml of each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A) and burst by nitrogen cavitation (600 psi, 20 min). Cavitated cells were centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 500 × g to remove the unbroken nuclei and cell debris. The supernatant from the low speed spin was centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min at 28,000 × g. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellets were resuspended and pooled in 35 ml of HE buffer (5 mm NaHEPES, l mm EDTA, pH 7.5) containing the same protease inhibitors as used in the homogenization buffer. Adenosine receptor HE buffer included 100 mm NaCl in addition to the above components. The membranes were washed twice in HE, resuspended in the same buffer at a concentration of 1–3 mg protein/ml, aliquoted, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –70 °C.Reconstitution of Receptors with Exogenous G-proteins—Frozen membranes were thawed, pelleted in a refrigerated microcentrifuge (10 min, 12,000 rpm), and resuspended at about 10 mg/ml in a reconstitution buffer consisting of 5 mm NaHEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 500 nm GDP, 0.04% CHAPS (0.08% CHAPS for M2 receptor), pH 7.5. G-protein subunits were diluted in the same buffer such that the desired amount of subunit was contained in 1–5 μl. Typically, 1–2 μl of G-protein subunits were added to 40 μl of membrane suspension, the mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 15 min and held on ice until the start of the binding assay.Radioligand Binding—Just prior to the start of the binding assay the reconstitution mixture was diluted 10–12-fold with binding assay buffer appropriate to the receptor of interest such that the desired amount of membranes (5–25 μg/assay tube) were contained in 10–50 μl. Binding buffer for 5-HT and M2 receptors was 50 mm Tris, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5. Binding buffer for A1 adenosine receptor was 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. Radioligand binding in the affinity shift assay was determined in the presence of the [3H]OXO-M for M2 muscarinic receptor, 5-[3H]HT for 5-HT serotonin receptors and [3H]CCPA for A1 adenosine receptor. Adenosine deaminase was added to the [3H]CCPA solution at 12 μg/ml in binding buffer. Nonspecific binding was determined by addition of 1000-fold excess of unlabeled ligand, 5-HT for 5-HT receptors, atropine sulfate for M2 receptor and R-PIA for A1 receptor. Incubations were for times sufficient to achieve equilibrium in a temperature controlled shaker (1 h for M2 receptor, 1.5 h for 5-HT receptors, 2 h for A1 receptor) and were terminated by filtration over Whatman GF/C filters using a Brandel Cell Harvester. The filters were rinsed thrice with 4 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Tris-Cl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.01% sodium azide, pH 7.5 at 4 °C, placed in 4.5 ml of CytoScint (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Costa Mesa, CA) and counted to constant error in a scintillation counter. For reconstitution of high affinity agonist binding in affinity shift assays, a single concentration of radioligand near the high affinity KD of the receptor of interest was used in a final volume of 150 μl. [3H]-5-HT radioligand purity was monitored by HPLC or TLC using an appropriate mobile phase. Radioligands were repurified or replaced when the radiochemical purity fell below 85%.Affinity Shift Activity Assay—The Sf9 cell membranes expressing individual receptors were reconstituted with saturating amounts of native or chimeric Gi1 protein heterotrimers (≥25 nm or 40–400-fold molar excess over receptors) to achieve the maximal specific binding during the binding assays. Because the magnitude of the affinity shifts observed with native Gi1 protein heterotrimers varied significantly among the individual receptors affinity shift activity was normalized to Gi1 activity and expressed as percent affinity shift activity, which is (Chimera Reconstituted Binding – Control Binding/Gil Reconstituted Binding – Control Binding) × 100.Analysis of Data—Data analysis was done using the GraphPad Prism software package (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). For affinity shift assays, triplicate determinations were used within each experiment, and experiments were repeated three or more times. Data represent the mean ± S.E. from multiple experiments. One-way analysis of variance with Tukey's multiple comparison post-test was used to compare the activities of chimeras.RESULTSPreviously we have shown that amino acids 299–318 and 1–219 of Gi1α are molecular determinants of 5-HT1B receptor coupling (11.Bae H.

Chem. 1997; 272: 32071-32077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and that two amino acids in the α4-helix of Gi1α (Gln-304 and Glu-308) are especially important for 5-HT1B receptor coupling (18.Bae H. Cabrera-Vera T.M. Depree K.M. Graber S.G. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14963-14971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The goal of the present study was to examine the generality of these findings among closely related members of the Gi/o-coupled receptor family. Our general strategy involves reconstitution of purified G-proteins containing chimeric α-subunits with receptors expressed in Sf9 insect cell membranes and comparison of the abilities of these chimeric G-proteins to stabilize the high affinity agonist binding state of the receptors in an affinity shift activity assay. In the present study we compared the coupling behavior of four different Gi/o-coupled receptors: 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B serotonin receptors, M2 muscarinic receptors, and A1 adenosine receptors.Affinities of Individual Receptors for G-proteins—First we determined the concentration of G-proteins in the binding assay that produced the maximum affinity shift for each receptor. Increasing amounts of G-protein heterotrimers were reconstituted with individual receptors and EC50 values for reconstitution of high affinity agonist binding were determined. The data indicate that A1, 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, and M2 receptors have different EC50 values for Gi1 (Fig. 1). A1 receptors have the highest apparent affinity (0.4 nm) and M2 receptors have the lowest apparent affinity (47 nm) for the Gi1 heterotrimer. 5-HT receptors have intermediate EC50 values of 3.7 and 16.2 nm for the 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors, respectively. Titration experiments similar to those shown in Fig. 1 were used to determine the concentration of chimeric G-proteins needed to saturate affinity shift activities with individual receptors. In agreement with earlier studies (11.Bae H. Anderson K. Flood L.A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Graber S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32071-32077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 18.Bae H. Cabrera-Vera T.M. Depree K.M. Graber S.G. Hamm H.E. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12930-12938Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the EC50 values of the active G-proteins were not significantly different for individual receptors, and even high concentrations (>600 nm) of inactive chimeras did not have affinity shift activity (data not shown). All affinity shift activities were determined with saturating concentrations of G-proteins.Affinity Shift Activity of Chimeric Gα Subunits—Fig. 2 depicts the secondary structures of the Gi1α/Gtα chimeras used in this study. All of these chimeras have been previously described and were used to study Gi1α domains involved in 5-HT1B receptor coupling (11.Bae H. Anderson K. Flood L.A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Graber S.G. J.

Fig. 3, in which 100% activity corresponds to the affinity shift activity of Gi1, shows the percent affinity shift activity of Chi2, Chi3, Chi6, Chi13, and Chi21. Chi6 was constructed as a soluble analog of Gtα and has the same functional properties as Gtα (19.Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Chi6 is primarily Gtα in character as it includes N-terminal amino acids 1–215 and C-terminal amino acids 295–350 of Gtα with the amino acids corresponding to 216–294 from Gi1α to maintain solubility. In this region there are just 26 amino acids that differ between Chi6 and Gtα. As shown in Fig. 3, Chi6 was inactive with 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, and M2 muscarinic receptors. Earlier experiments with native transducin demonstrated it also failed to couple with the 5-HT receptors (20.Clawges H.M. Depree K.M. Parker E.M. Graber S.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12930-12938Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In contrast, the data in Fig. 3 demonstrate Chi6 was 74% active with the A1 adenosine receptor, indicating that A1 adenosine receptor does not discriminate well between Gt and Gi1 sequences. Similarly, native transducin was 80% active with the A1 adenosine receptor, which is not significantly different from Chi6 (data not shown). Although the activity of Chi6 (and native transducin) with the A1 adenosine receptor was significantly lower (p < 0.001) than the activity of Gi1, the magnitude of the difference was too small to be of use in identifying the precise domains responsible for the reduced activity. However, the inability of the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, and M2 muscarinic receptors to couple with Chi6 allowed us to use additional chimeras containing less Gtα sequence to more precisely identify the domains required for coupling.Fig. 2Secondary structure of Gα subunits.

Sf9 cell membranes expressing individual receptors were reconstituted with the indicated chimeric Gα and βγ subunits.

Chi21 has N-terminal amino acids 1–215 of Gtα with the rest of the molecule Gi1α sequence (Fig. 2). Chi21 was fully active with the A1 adenosine receptor, indicating that the A1 receptor does not distinguish between N-terminal amino acid sequences of Gi1α and Gtα (Fig. 3). The activity of Chi21 with 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, and M2 receptors was significantly (p < 0.001) reduced (44, 57, and 42% respectively, Fig. 3) demonstrating that amino acids 1–219 of Gi1α contain an important determinant of Gi coupling with these receptors. Chi2 has the C-terminal amino acids 295–350 of Gtα with the rest of the chimera Gi1α sequence (Fig. 2). Fig. 3 demonstrates that amino acids 299–354 of Gi1α contain residues critical for 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, and M2 receptor coupling because the affinity shift activity of Chi2 with these receptors (2, 9, and 23% respectively) was not significantly different from Chi6 activity. In contrast, Chi2 was fully active with A1 adenosine receptors supporting our conclusion that A1 adenosine receptor does not distinguish well between Gi1α and Gtα sequences. To further evaluate the role of amino acids 299–354 of Gi1α in 5-HT and M2 receptor coupling we tested two additional chimeras, Chi3 and Chi13 (Fig. 2). Chi3 has amino acids 299–319 of Gi1α replaced with the corresponding amino acids of Gtα (amino acids 295–315) while Chi13 has the 35 C-terminal amino acids of Gi1α replaced with the corresponding amino acids of Gtα. As shown in Fig. 3, the affinity shift activities of Chi3 show that amino acids 299–319 of Gi1α (α4-helix and α4/β6-loop) are critical for 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, and M2 receptor coupling, but not for A1 adenosine receptor coupling. In contrast, Chi13, with six amino acids variant from Gi1α, was active with all four receptors indicating that the 35 C-terminal amino acids of Gi1α and Gtα are functionally interchangeable in coupling these receptors. Nevertheless, the significantly (p < 0.01) reduced activity of Chi13 (85.9%) with the M2 receptor and the significantly (p < 0.01) increased activity with both 5-HT1A (128%) and 5-HT1B (124.5%) receptors suggest subtle differences in the coupling mechanism of these receptors. The role of the extreme C terminus of Gi1α cannot be evaluated with these chimeras because the eight C-terminal amino acids of Gi1α and Gtα are identical.Role of the α4-Helix and α4/β6-Loop of Gi1α in Receptor Coupling—In order to investigate the α4-α4/β6 region of Gi1α in more detail we used several additional chimeras to subdivide this region (Fig. 4). Chi22 has the α4-helix of Gi1α replaced with that from Gtα while Chi25 has the α4/β6-loop of Gi1α replaced with that from Gtα. Chi23 has the α4/β6-loop of Gi1α replaced with that from Gtα and also switches the Glu in Gi1α at the end of the α4-helix for the Leu found in Gtα. Chi24 has the central part of the α4/β6-loop with two variant amino acids switched between Gi1α and Gtα. These chimeras were fully active with the A1 adenosine receptor (data not shown), supporting our conclusion that the A1 receptor does not use the α4-α4/β6 region to distinguish between Gt and Gi1 (see Fig. 3). Fig. 5 shows the affinity shift activity of these chimeras with 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, and M2 receptors. Chi22 had low affinity shift activity with all three receptors indicating that a critical determinant of coupling selectivity for these receptors is located in the α4-helix of Gi1α (Fig. 5). For the 5-HT1B receptor, the activity of Chi22 was significantly higher than the activity of Chi3 (p < 0.01), indicating that the α4/β6-loop may also play a role in 5-HT1B receptor coupling. This conclusion is supported by the Chi25 activity with the 5-HT1B receptor (73%), which was significantly (p < 0.001) lower than the activity of Gi1 (100%). However, Chi25 was 91% as active with M2 muscarinic receptor) which was not significantly different (p > 0.05) from Gi1 activity) and was 121% as active with the 5-HT1A receptor (which was significantly (p < 0.001) higher than Gi1). Taken together the data suggest the α4/β6-loop is utilized differently by these receptors. Chi24 was fully active with all three receptors (Fig. 5), which suggests that the reduced activity of"

However, in a recent study (Mironova, R., Niwa, T., Hayashi, H., Dimitrova, R., and Ivanov, I. (2001) Mol. Microbiol. 39, 1061-1068), we have shown that glycation takes place in Escherichia coli as well. In the present study, we demonstrate that the post-translational processing (proteolysis and covalent dimerization) observed with cysteineless recombinant human interferon-γ (rhIFN-γ) is tightly associated with its in vivo glycation. Our results show that, at the time of isolation, rhIFN-γ contained early (but not advanced) glycation products. Using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography in conjunction with fluorescence measurements, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and mass spectrometry, we found that advanced glycation end products arose in rhIFN-γ during storage. The latter were identified mainly in the Arg/Lys-rich C terminus of the protein, which was also the main target of proteolysis. Mass spectral analysis and N-terminal sequencing revealed four major (Arg140↓Arg141, Phe137↓Arg138, Met135↓Leu136, and Lys131↓Arg132) and two minor (Lys109↓Ala110 and Arg90↓Asp91) cleavage sites in this region. Tryptic peptide mapping indicated that the covalent dimers of rhIFN-γ originating during storage were formed mainly by lateral cross-linking of the monomer subunits. Antiviral assay showed that proteolysis lowered the antiviral activity of rhIFN-γ, whereas covalent dimerization completely abolished it.

Extensive experimental evidence indicates that cleavage of rhIFN-γ occurs at its C terminus adjacent to basic amino acids (17Zhang Z. Tong K.T. Belew M. Pettersson T. Janson J.C. J.

Escherichia coli lacks enzyme activities for protein glycosylation of the type occurring in eukaryotes. Thus, hIFN-γ synthesized in this bacterium is devoid of the native glycosylation pattern. However, proteins may become glycoproteins in an alternative type of glycosylation called glycation (to be distinguished from the enzymatic type of glycosylation). Glycation does not require enzyme catalysis and therefore is thought to proceed slowly under physiological conditions. The first step of glycation includes the formation of reversible Schiff bases (aldimines) at free amino groups in proteins, which are then converted to more stable Amadori products. Subsequent chemical rearrangements lead to the formation of complex terminal adducts, which remain tightly bound to proteins and are designated as advanced glycation end products (AGEs). After the initial attachment of glucose, the next rearrangements may occur under sugar-free conditions (24Eble A.S. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9406-9412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glycation was extensively studied in humans because of its clinical importance (25Vlassara H. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1994; 124: 19-30PubMed Google Scholar) and relation to aging (26Monnier V.M. Baynes J.W. Monnier V.M. The Maillard Reaction in Aging, Diabetes, and Nutrition. Alan R. Liss, New York1989: 1-22Google Scholar). However, no one expected that glycation could occur in bacteria because of their short life span and intense protein turnover. This could explain why bacterial glycoproteins are scarcely studied. Such proteins are speculated to account for the existence of the enzymatic rather than nonenzymatic type of glycosylation in prokaryotes (27Benz I. Schmidt M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The only bacterial glycoprotein considered so far as being a result of glycation is the Bacillus thuringiensis crystal protein (28Pfannenstiel M.A. Muthukumar G. Couche G.A. Nickerson K.W. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 796-801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Muthukumar G. Nickerson K.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1987; 53: 2650-2655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, because this protein is secreted in the culture medium, it was concluded that the “sugars detected were the product of fermentation conditions rather than bacterial genetics” (30Bhattacharya M. Plantz B.A. Swanson-Kobler J.D. Nickerson K.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 2666-2672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that nonenzymatic glycosylation occurs also in E. coli under physiological conditions (20Mironova R. Niwa T. Hayashi H. Dimitrova R. Ivanov I. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To the best of our knowledge, this was the first report providing evidence for endogenous glycation in bacteria. We also demonstrated that 4-month-old rhIFN-γ preparations isolated from E. coli were modified with AGEs. The purified protein was also prone to progressive proteolysis and covalent dimerization during storage. It is well known that chemical rearrangements in the late glycation stages cause peptide bond cleavage (31Ookawara T. Kawamura N. Kitagawa Y. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18505-18510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Islam K.N. Takahashi M. Higashiyama S. Myint T. Uozumi N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 1054-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and covalent cross-linking at lysine and arginine (but not cysteine) residues (33Njoroge F.G. Fernandes A.A. Monnier V.M. J.

That is why we concluded that glycation might provide a rational explanation for both the proteolysis and dimerization of purified rhIFN-γ over time. Here, we present new data in favor of the link between glycation and post-translational processing of rhIFN-γ. Purification of rhIFN-γ—A gene coding for cysteineless hIFN-γ was expressed constitutively (35Ivanov I. Tam J. Wishart P. Jay E. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 59: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) in E. coli XL1-Blue (supE44 hsdR17 recA1 endA1 gyrA46 thi relA1 lac- F′ (proAB+lacIqlacZΔM15 Tn10 (tetr))). Transformed cells were cultured overnight at 37 °C in 1-liter flasks containing 250 ml of LB medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml tetracycline and 0.1% glucose. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation; suspended in buffer containing 1 m urea, 0.4 m guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl), and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8); and disrupted by sonication. Cell lysate was centrifuged for 20 min at 10,000 × g. The crude pellet containing rhIFN-γ in the form of inclusion bodies was suspended in 7 m GdnHCl (pH 7), slowly diluted to 1 m GdnHCl with ice-cold water, and clarified by centrifugation. The supernatant was loaded onto an octyl-Sepharose CL-4B column (25 × 200 mm) and eluted with a linear gradient of 1.0-6.0 m GdnHCl (pH 7.0) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions collected at 2.0-3.0 m GdnHCl were pooled and applied to a CM-Sepharose column (25 × 110 mm). The latter was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.2-1.0 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.2) at a flow rate of 4 ml/min, and 8-ml fractions were collected. Concentration Measurements and SDS-PAGE—The concentration of rhIFN-γ was measured either by the method of Bradford (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216068) Google Scholar) or spectrophotometrically. Standards in the Bradford assay were prepared with bovine serum albumin (BSA) at 10-100 μg/ml. In the spectrophotometric measurements at 280 nm, an extinction coefficient of 0.6 for 0.1% protein solution was used. 18% SDS-polyacrylamide gels were run according to Laemmli (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207139) Google Scholar). Thiobarbituric Acid Colorimetric Method—After the second chromatography step (see above), rhIFN-γ fractions with different retention times were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid at a final concentration of 20%. The trichloroacetic acid pellet was dissolved in Tris-buffered saline, and the protein concentration was adjusted to 5 mg/ml based on the absorbance at 280 nm. The Amadori product content in rhIFN-γ was determined (as nmol of Fru eq) by the thiobarbituric acid method (38Fluckiger R. Gallop P.M. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 106: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) using a standard curve prepared with fructose at 10-100 nmol/ml. Reverse Phase High Performance Liquid Chromatography (RP-HPLC)—Purified rhIFN-γ samples were analyzed on a TSKgel phenyl 5PW column (4.6 × 75 mm) at a flow rate 0.5 ml/min at ambient temperature. Solvent A was 0.8% trifluoroacetic acid in water, and solvent B was 1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. Elution was carried out isocratically for 5 min at 15% solvent B and then with a linear gradient to 90% solvent B for 30 min. The HPLC system (Japan Spectroscopic) was equipped with a Model 875-UV detector and a Model 820-FP fluorescence detector. For preparative isolation of glycated peptides, 100 μg of rhIFN-γ was loaded onto the RP-HPLC column, and the fluorescent fraction (designated as F in Fig. 2) was collected manually, evaporated to dryness, and dissolved in 10 μl of distilled water. The peptide fraction was loaded onto an ODS HG-5 column (2.0 × 150 mm) and eluted at a flow rate 0.3 ml/min isocratically for 5 min with 5% solvent B (2.0% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile), followed by raising its concentration to 70% in 40 min. Solvent A was 1.6% trifluoroacetic acid in water. Competitive Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—BSA was dissolved in 0.5 m d-glucose at 10 mg/ml, filter-sterilized, and incubated at 37 °C for 3 months to obtain AGE-modified BSA for use in the assay. Glycated BSA was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. Then, 96-well microtiter plates were coated with 50 μl/well AGE/BSA solution at 0.5 mg/ml. Plates were blocked overnight at 4 °C and then washed three times with 0.05% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline. Samples or standards (25 μl/well) dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline were mixed with 50 μl of assay buffer (0.25% BSA in phosphate-buffered saline) and 50 μl of horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-AGE antibody (diluted 1:20 in assay buffer). The two monoclonal anti-AGE antibodies used (AG-1 and AG-10) were specific for imidazolone and Nϵ-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML), respectively (39Niwa T. Sato M. Katsuzaki T. Tomoo T. Miyazaki T.

Tatemichi N. Takei Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1272-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Competition reaction was carried out for 40 min at room temperature. After three washing steps, color was developed with 100 μl/well o-phenylenediamine dissolved in 0.2 m Na2HPO4 citrate buffer (pH 5.2) and 0.02% H2O2 at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. The reaction was stopped with 100 μl/well 0.8 m H2SO4, and the absorption at 492 nm was read with a microplate reader. AGE/BSA was used as a standard at 0.05-0.6 mg/ml. The concentration of AGE-modified rhIFN-γ was expressed as mg/ml AGE/BSA eq. Liquid Chromatography/Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS)—Mass spectra of rhIFN-γ were obtained on a Finnigan MAT triple stage quadrupole TSQ 7000 mass spectrometer with an atmospheric pressure ionization ion source operating in the positive ion mode. The electrospray was created at a potential difference of 4.5 kV. The nitrogen sheath gas was set to 70 p.s.i. (1 p.s.i. = 6894.76 pascals). Nitrogen heated to 250 °C was used as a drying gas and was introduced into the capillary region at a flow rate of 25 liters/min. The system was run in an automated LC-MS mode. The mass spectrometer was equipped with a Hewlett-Packard HPLC Series 1050 system. Protein samples were applied to the RP-HPLC column at an injection speed of 2 μl/s. The HPLC method employed was the same as the RP-HPLC method described above except for acetic acid, which was substituted for trifluoroacetic acid in solvents A and B. Experiments were performed at a mass spectrometric resolution of 1000 using a step size of 0.1 atomic mass unit. External calibration of the mass scale was achieved with multiple charge ions by injection of human β2-microglobulin (average molecular mass of 11,732.2 Da; Sigma). Mass spectra were acquired in the m/z range of 600-1400 atomic mass units by scanning the magnetic field in 2 s and analyzed in the BIOMASS™ Deconvolution and BIOMASS™ Calculation modules of the BioWorks ICIS window (Version 8.2). N-terminal Sequencing—Peptides were custom-sequenced by Aproscience Co. (Tokushima, Japan). LC/ESI-MS Peptide Mapping—Tryptic digestion was performed by the gel matrix method of Rosenfeld et al. (42Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar) with some modifications. SDS-polyacrylamide gels were stained with a fresh solution of 0.2% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in 10% acetic acid and 25% methanol and destained with 30% methanol until bands became visible. The latter were excised from the gel, washed twice with 0.5 ml of 50% acetonitrile in 0.2 m NH4HCO3 (pH 8.9) for 20 min at 30 °C and once with 0.5 ml of 0.2 m NH4HCO3 (pH 8.9), and evaporated to a semidry state in a rotary evaporator. Gel slices were rehydrated in 20 μl of enzyme solution containing 0.5 mg of modified trypsin (Promega) in 0.2 m NH4HCO3 (pH 8.9). After absorption of the protease solution, aliquots of 5 μl of ammonium carbonate buffer were added until the slices regained their original size and became completely immersed in the reaction solution. The slices were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C, and the resulting peptides were extracted twice with 60% acetonitrile for 20 min at 30 °C and once with 60% acetonitrile and 0.02% Tween 20. The extracts were combined and concentrated to 20 μl in a rotary evaporator. The peptides were introduced into the ion source of the triple stage quadrupole mass spectrometer via the RP-HPLC method described for peptide isolation. Acetic acid was used instead of trifluoroacetic acid in the mobile phase solutions. Peptide samples were injected automatically at a speed 1 μl/s, and the ion source was operated in the positive ion mode. Drying nitrogen was heated to 275 °C, and mass spectra were acquired by scanning the magnetic field for 3 s in the m/z range of 300-1300 atomic mass units. Data were analyzed in the PEPMAP™ module of the BioWorks ICIS window (Version 8.2) at a mass tolerance of 1.0 atomic mass unit. Gel Filtration Chromatography—Gel filtration was performed using an LKB Bromma HPLC system equipped with an LKB/UltroPac TSK-G3000SW column (7.5 × 300 mm) according to the method described by Lauren et al. (18Lauren S.L. Arakawa T. Stoney K. Rohde M.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Antiviral Assay—The antiviral assay was based on the protective effect of hIFN-γ against the cytopathic action of the vesicular stomatitis virus on the human amnionic cell line WISH as described (43Familletti P.C. Rubinstein S. Pestka S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 78: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Purified Preparations of rhIFN-γ Undergo Proteolysis and Dimerization over Time—rhIFN-γ was purified from E. coli inclusion bodies by two consecutive chromatography steps. The second step included separation of refolded proteins on CM-Sepharose based on their net charge. Refolded rhIFN-γ was usually eluted from the second column as a broad peak covering the salt concentration range of 0.4-0.5 m NaCl (data not shown). Eluted rhIFN-γ was pooled into three fractions, designated as Fraction 1 (retention time of 39 min), Fraction 2 (retention time of 43 min), and Fraction 3 (retention time of 45 min). Fig. 1A shows the SDS-PAGE pattern of these three fractions immediately after purification, whereas Fig. 1B represents the same fractions after filter sterilization and storage at 4 °C for 2 months. As shown in Fig. 1A (lanes 1-3), at the time of isolation, the three fractions contained apparently homogeneous rhIFN-γ. However, 2 months later, Fraction 1 was completely converted into lower molecular mass form(s) (Fig. 1B, lane 1). rhIFN-γ in Fraction 2 underwent partial cleavage concomitant with the appearance of higher molecular mass forms (Fig. 1B, lane 2). The electrophoretic mobility of the latter was indicative of covalent dimerization affecting both the full-length and truncated rhIFN-γ species. Fraction 3 turned out to be unaffected during storage (Fig. 1B, lane 3). Truncation and dimerization of rhIFN-γ in Fractions 1 and 2 were observed even upon storage at -20 °C (data not shown). Fresh rhIFN-γ Preparations Contain Early (but Not Late) Glycation Products—We tested fresh rhIFN-γ Fractions 1-3 for modifications with the early glycation marker fructosamine (or the Amadori product). As shown in Table I, the Amadori product was detected only in Fractions 1 and 2, but not in Fraction 3. Additionally, the content of the Amadori product in Fraction 1 was about six times higher than that in Fraction 2. The protein content in the three fractions was measured by two independent methods: Coomassie Brilliant Blue G staining (Bradford assay) and absorption at 280 nm (A280). The concentrations for rhIFN-γ in Fractions 1 and 2, determined by the Bradford assay, were five and two times lower, respectively, compared with the values obtained by A280 (Table I). Fraction 3 gave comparable concentrations independent of the method used. Bearing in mind that Coomassie Brilliant Blue dye interacts with positively charged groups in proteins, which are also glycation targets (44Iberg N. Fluckiger R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13542-13545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Arai K. Maguchi S. Fujii S. Ishibashi H. Oikawa K. Taniguchi N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 5587-5592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we are tempted to explain the lower concentrations obtained by the Bradford assay as the result of glycation of rhIFN-γ in Fractions 1 and 2. As glycation does not affect tryptophan residues, A280 values remain unchanged. Fresh rhIFN-γ Fractions 1-3 were also tested for the presence of AGEs by ELISA using CML- and imidazolone-specific monoclonal antibodies. Neither of these two compounds was detected in the fresh rhIFN-γ preparations.Table IAmadori products and protein content in fresh rhIFN-γ preparationsFractionAPaMean ± S.D.

Open table in a new tab Processed rhIFN-γ Fractions Contain AGEs—Two months later, the above three rhIFN-γ fractions were analyzed by RP-HPLC. The eluate was monitored for both absorption at 280 nm and AGE-specific fluorescence (Ex370 nm/Em420 nm). ELISA was also applied to test the peak fractions for the presence of AGEs. Our results show that the truncated protein form(s) in Fraction 1, which eluted at a retention time of 22.6 min, was neither fluorescent nor reactive to either of the anti-AGE antibodies (Fig. 2A). However, this fraction contained some material with a low retention time (5.4 min), which was AGE-positive as determined by both fluorescence analysis and ELISA. Notably, this fraction (designated as fraction F) did not absorb at 280 nm (Fig. 2A, lower panel) and demonstrated strong reactivity to the anti-imidazolone antibody (upper panel). Fraction 2 showed two peaks with close retention times (22.2 and 22.6 min) in the RP-HPLC chromatogram (Fig. 2B, lower panel). The earlier peak (retention time of 22.2 min) showed poor fluorescence and was not immunoreactive, and its SDS-PAGE mobility corresponded to that of full-length rhIFN-γ (data not shown). The later (shoulder) peak (retention time of 22.6 min) was highly fluorescent and represented a mixture of dimer and truncated rhIFN-γ species. Because truncated rhIFN-γ species were not fluorescent (Fig. 2A, lower panel), dimers should account for the high AGE-specific florescence in this mixed fraction. In the RP-HPLC chromatogram of Fraction 2, one can also see the same AGE-positive fraction F (retention time of 5.4 min) observed in Fraction 1. rhIFN-γ in Fraction 3, which eluted at a retention time of 22.2 min, was ELISA-negative and non-fluorescent and was composed of full-length protein only (Fig. 2C). These results clearly demonstrate that, after 2 months of storage, glycation of rhIFN-γ in Fractions 1 and 2 had come to its terminal stages, leading to accumulation of typical AGEs. AGE-modified C-terminal Fragments Are Cut Off from the rhIFN-γ Molecules—The fluorescent fraction F was collected and reloaded onto a narrow-bore RP-HPLC column. As shown in Fig. 3, in addition to the bulky early eluting material, two peaks, designated as P1 (retention time of 24.8 min) and P2 (retention time of 26.9 min), were clearly distinguished. The eluate corresponding to these two peaks was collected, concentrated, and subjected to both N-terminal sequencing and LC/ESI-MS analysis. Sequence analysis revealed sequence DDFEK for peptide P1 and sequence AIHEL for peptide P2, accounting for proteolysis in the rhIFN-γ molecule between Arg90↓Asp91 and Lys109↓Ala110, respectively. The absence of tryptophan in rhIFN-γ following Arg90 (23Rinderknecht E. O'Connor B.H. Rodriguez H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6790-6797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) explains the lack of absorption at 280 nm in fraction F (see above). The two cleavage sites were further confirmed by LC/ESI-MS analysis (Fig. 4 and Table II). The m/z values observed in this experiment were matched against the monoisotopic m/z values expected for peptides P1 (Asp91-Gln144) and P2 (Ala110-Gln144). In addition, we expanded the set of calculated m/z values with those corresponding to putative modifications of the two peptides with either CML or imidazolone. We were motivated to do this by the observed reactivity of fraction F with both the anti-CML and anti-imidazolone antibodies. Thus, for peptide P1, we detected four mu"

By performing an alanine scan of TbCet1, we identified six amino acids that are essential for triphosphatase activity (Glu-52, Arg-127, Glu-168, Arg-186, Glu-216, and Glu-218). These results consolidate the proposal that protozoan, fungal, and Chlorella virus RNA triphosphatases belong to a single family of metal-dependent NTP phosphohydrolases with a unique tunnel active site composed of eight β strands. Limited proteolysis of TbCet1 suggests that the hydrophilic N terminus is surface-exposed, whereas the catalytic core domain is tightly folded with the exception of a protease-sensitive loop (76WKGRRARKT84) between two of the putative tunnel strands. The catalytic domain of TbCet1 is extraordinarily thermostable. It remains active after heating for 2 h at 75 °C. Analysis by zonal velocity sedimentation indicates that TbCet1 is a monomeric enzyme, unlike fungal RNA triphosphatases, which are homodimers. We show that tripolyphosphate is a potent competitive inhibitor of TbCet1 (Ki 1.4 μm) that binds more avidly to the active site than the ATP substrate (Km 25 μm). We present evidence of synergistic activation of the TbCet1 triphosphatase by manganese and magnesium, consistent with a two-metal mechanism of catalysis.

The cap is formed by three enzymes. The 5′-triphosphate end of the nascent pre-mRNA is hydrolyzed to a diphosphate by RNA triphosphatase. The diphosphate end is capped with GMP by RNA guanylyltransferase, and the GpppN cap is methylated by RNA (guanine-N7) methyltransferase (1Shuman S. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant.

Pei Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34151-34156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the crystal structure of the S. cerevisiae RNA triphosphatase Cet1 revealed that the active site is located within a topologically closed β barrel (the triphosphate tunnel) composed of eight antiparallel strands (Fig. 1) (17Lima C.D. Wang L.K. Shuman S. Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Each of the eight β strands contributes one or more functional groups to the Cet1 active site (16Ho C.K. Pei Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34151-34156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar-19Bisaillon M. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17261-17266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A single sulfate in the tunnel, which is proposed to mimic the γ phosphate of the substrate, is coordinated by multiple basic side chains projecting into the cavity from the tunnel walls (17Lima C.D. Wang L.K. Shuman S. Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). A single manganese ion within the tunnel cavity is coordinated with octahedral geometry to the sulfate to the side chain carboxylates of the two glutamates in β1 and a glutamate in β11. It is not clear whether the enzyme-bound divalent cation seen in the Cet1 crystal structure is the sole metal cofactor for the triphosphatase activity. The amino acid sequence alignment in Fig. 1 illustrates that the β strands that comprise the Cet1 triphosphate tunnel are conserved in the known RNA triphosphatases of fungi and protozoa and also in the RNA triphosphatase encoded by an algal virus, Paramecium bursaria Chlorella virus-1 (20Ho C.K. Gong C. Shuman S. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1744-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We have proposed that the active site folds of the fungal, microsprodian, protozoan, and Chlorella virus RNA triphosphatases are conserved as β barrels, implying a common evolutionary origin for these enzymes (21Gong C. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15317-15324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Extensive mutational analyses of the C. albicans and Chlorella virus RNA triphosphatases indicates that their active site architecture and catalytic mechanism adhere closely to those of yeast Cet1 (21Gong C.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1885-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae Cet1 and the S. pombe RNA triphosphatase Pct1 are both homodimers (17Lima C.D. Wang L.K. Shuman S. Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 23Lehman K. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Rouzankina I. Shuman S. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 387-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Available evidence indicates that homodimeric quaternary structure is essential for Cet1 and Pct1 function in vivo but not for their catalytic activity (25Lehman K. Ho C.K. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14996-15002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 26Hausmann S. Pei Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30487-30496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The two tunnels are at opposite poles of the Cet1 homodimer in a parallel orientation. Each tunnel rests on a globular domain (the pedestal) composed of elements from both protomers of the homodimer. Disruption of the Cet1 dimer interface by a single alanine substitution is lethal in vivo and renders Cet1 activity acutely thermolabile at physiological temperatures in vitro (26Hausmann S. Pei Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30487-30496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Similarly, a catalytically active monomer of fission yeast Pct1 is defective in vivo in S. pombe and hypersensitive to thermal inactivation in vitro (26Hausmann S. Pei Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30487-30496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). These findings suggested an explanation for the conservation of quaternary structure in fungal RNA triphosphatases, whereby the delicate tunnel architecture of the active site is stabilized by the homodimeric pedestal domain. The trypanosome RNA triphosphatase TbCet1 has been shown to function in cap formation in vivo in S. cerevisiae in lieu of Cet1 (11Ho C.K. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46182-46186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, the enzyme has not been characterized biochemically beyond the initial documentation of the manganese-dependent NTPase activity of a recombinant TbCet1 fusion protein (11Ho C.K. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46182-46186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Here we present a physical characterization of untagged native TbCet1 including the following: (i) probing TbCet1 tertiary structure by limited proteolysis; (ii) assessment of quaternary structure by zonal velocity sedimentation; (iii) domain demarcation by N-terminal deletion; and (iv) an analysis of TbCet1 thermal stability. The results of these experiments reveal striking differences between TbCet1 and Cet1, insofar as TbCet1 is a monomeric enzyme and it is extremely resistant to thermal inactivation. We also present a mechanistic characterization of TbCet1 that includes the following: (i) an alanine scan pinpointing six amino acids essential for catalysis in vitro; (ii) identification of tripolyphosphate as a potent competitive inhibitor; and (iii) evidence of synergistic activation of the TbCet1 triphosphatase by manganese and magnesium, consistent with a two-metal mechanism of catalysis. Our findings provide further insight to the evolution of the metal-dependent RNA triphosphatase family and its utility as an anti-infective drug target. Expression and Purification of Recombinant TbCet1—The bacterial expression plasmid pET-His10/Smt3-TbCet1 encodes T. brucei RNA triphosphatase fused in-frame to an N-terminal His10/Smt3 domain, consisting of a His10 leader peptide (MGHHHHHHHHHHSSGHIEGRH) followed by the 98-amino acid S. cerevisiae Smt3 protein and a single serine (Smt3 is the yeast ortholog of the small ubiquitin-like modifier SUMO). pET-His10/Smt3-TbCet1 was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). A 200-ml bacterial culture was grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 60 μg/ml kanamycin until the A600 reached ∼0.5. The culture was placed on ice for 10 min, adjusted to 2% ethanol and 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and then incubated at 17 °C for 18 h with constant shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was stored at -80 °C. All of the subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C. Thawed bacteria were resuspended in 20 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25 m NaCl, 10% sucrose). Cell lysis was achieved by the addition of lysozyme and Triton X-100 to final concentrations of 50 μg/ml and 0.1%, respectively. The lysate was sonicated to reduce viscosity, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The soluble extract was applied to a 1-ml column of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen) that had been equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The column was washed with 10 ml of the same buffer and then eluted stepwise with 3-ml aliquots of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.25 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100) containing 0, 50, 100, 200, and 500 mm imidazole. The polypeptide compositions of the column fractions were monitored by SDS-PAGE. The 45-kDa recombinant His10/Smt3-TbCet1 polypeptide was recovered predominantly in the 200 mm imidazole fraction (containing ∼3 mg of protein). N-terminal Deletion Mutants of TbCet1—N-terminal-truncated alleles TbCet1(23-252) (NΔ22) and TbCet1(34-252) (NΔ33) were generated by PCR amplification using sense primers that introduced a BamHI site at the 5′ end of the truncated coding region. The PCR products were digested with BamHI and HindIII and then inserted into pET28-His10/Smt3 that had been digested with BamHI and HindIII. The inserts were sequenced completely to confirm the in-frame fusion junction and exclude unwanted coding changes. The His10/Smt3-tagged NΔ22 and NΔ33 proteins were produced in E. coli and purified by nickel-agarose affinity chromatography as described above. Alanine Mutagenesis of TbCet1—Silent diagnostic restriction sites and single alanine substitutions were introduced into the TbCet1 gene by two-stage overlap extension PCR. BamHI restriction fragments of the PCR-amplified mutated DNAs were inserted into the T7-based expression plasmid pET28-His10/Smt3 that had been digested with BamHI. The presence of the desired mutations was confirmed in each case by sequencing the entire insert. The occurrence of PCR-generated mutations outside the targeted region was thereby excluded. The His10/Smt3-tagged TbCet1-Ala proteins were produced in E. coli and purified by nickel-agarose affinity chromatography as described above. Removal of the His10-Smt3 Tag—Aliquots of the 200 mm imidazole fractions of wild-type His10-Smt3-tagged TbCet1 (2 mg), NΔ22 (2 mg), and NΔ33 (1 mg) were treated for 1 h on ice with purified recombinant His-tagged S. cerevisiae Ulp1, a Smt3-specific cysteine protease (27Mossessova E. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 865-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), at a 1/1000 ratio of Ulp1 to His10-Smt3-TbCet1. The digests were adjusted to 50 mm NaCl by 1:4 dilution with buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100). The samples were applied to 1-ml phosphocellulose columns that had been equilibrated with 50 mm NaCl in buffer C. The bound material was eluted stepwise with 2-ml aliquots of 200, 500, and 1000 mm NaCl in buffer C. The His10-Smt3 polypeptide was recovered mainly in the flow-through and 200 mm NaCl eluate fractions, whereas the released native TbCet1 proteins were recovered predominantly in the 500 mm NaCl eluates. The 500 mm NaCl fractions were then applied to 0.5-ml column of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose to adsorb any residual His10-Smt3. The nickel-agarose flow-though fractions of TbCet1 (1 mg), NΔ22 (1 mg), and NΔ33 (0.3 mg) were used for biochemical and physical studies. Nucleoside Triphosphate Phosphohydrolase Assay—Reaction mixtures (10 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm MnCl2, 0.2 mm [γ-32P]ATP, and serial 2-fold dilutions of either wild-type or mutant TbCet1 proteins (0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 ng) were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The reactions were quenched by adding 2.5 μl of 5 m formic acid. Aliquots of the mixtures were applied to polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plates, which were developed with 1 m formic acid, 0.5 m LiCl. 32Pi release was quantified by scanning the chromatogram with a Fujix phosphorimaging device. The specific activities were calculated from the slopes of the titration curves. The activity values for the mutant enzymes were then normalized to the specific activity of wild-type TbCet1. Tripolyphosphatase Assay—Reaction mixtures (50 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm MnCl2, 0.2 mm tripolyphosphate (or pyrophosphate or ATP), and TbCet1 as specified were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The reactions were quenched by adding 1 ml of malachite green reagent (BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA). Phosphate release was determined by measuring A620 and interpolating the value to a phosphate standard curve. Background levels of inorganic phosphate (typically 2-4% of the input levels of PPPi, PPi, or ATP substrate) determined from the A620 of a control reaction mixture lacking TbCet1 were subtracted from the values measured for the reactions containing TbCet1. Limited Proteolysis of TbCet1—Reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 10 μg of native TbCet1 and trypsin or chymotrypsin as specified were incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The reactions were quenched by adding SDS, and the digests were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Polypeptides were transferred electrophoretically to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and visualized by staining the membrane with Coomassie Blue dye. Membrane slices containing intact TbCet1 and individual proteolytic products were excised and subjected to automated Edman sequencing. Glycerol Gradient Sedimentation—Native TbCet1 (100 μg) was mixed with catalase (50 μg), BSA (50 μg), and cytochrome c (50 μg) in 200 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol. The mixture was applied to a 4.8-ml 15-30% glycerol gradient containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The gradient was centrifuged in a Beckman SW50 rotor at 50,000 rpm for 18 h at 4 °C. Fractions (∼0.21 ml) were collected from the bottom of the tube. Aliquots (15 μl) of odd-numbered gradient fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Structure-based Alanine Scan of TbCet1—To test the structural and mechanistic relation of the T. brucei and fungal RNA triphosphatases, we conducted a limited alanine scan of TbCet1 using the tunnel of Cet1 as a guide. We targeted eight amino acids of TbCet1 corresponding to side chains in five of the β strands of the Cet1 tunnel: Glu-52 and Arg-56 (β1); Arg-217 (β6); Glu-168 (β8); Arg-186 (β9); and Glu-214, Glu-216, and Glu-218 (β11). The eight targeted residues are conserved in all of the members of the tunnel family (Fig. 1). The TbCet1-Ala proteins were expressed as His10-Smt3-tagged fusions in E. coli in parallel with wild-type TbCet1. The recombinant proteins were purified from soluble bacterial extracts by nickel-agarose chromatography. SDS-PAGE analysis of the polypeptide compositions of the nickel-agarose protein preparations revealed similar extents of purification (Fig. 2A). The 45-kDa His10-Smt3-TbCet1 polypeptide was the predominant species in every case. The triphosphatase activities of the wild-type and mutant His10-Smt3-TbCet1 proteins were assayed by the release of 32Pi from 0.2 mm [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of 1 mm manganese. The extent of ATP hydrolysis by the wild-type enzyme was proportional to enzyme concentration, and the reaction proceeded to completion at saturating enzyme (data not shown). We calculated a specific activity of 0.88 nmol of 32Pi formed per nanogram of His10-Smt3-TbCet1 during a 15-min reaction, which corresponded to a turnover number of 44 s-1. The specific activities of the eight Ala mutants normalized to the wild-type specific activity are shown in Fig. 2B. Alanine substitutions at six of the eight positions examined elicited at least a 50-fold decrement in catalytic activity. These residues were Glu-52, Arg-127, Glu-168, Arg-186, Glu-216, and Glu-218. We designated these six residues as essential for the phosphohydrolase activity of TbCet1 by applying a criterion for essentiality of a 20-fold activity decrement incurred by side-chain removal. One residue at which alanine substitution reduced activity between 6 and 20% of wild type (Glu-214 in β11) was deemed to be important but not essential. Arg-56 was judged not to be important, because the R56A mutant retained 64% of wild-type activity. Fig. 2B shows a comparison of the effects of alanine mutations at the eight “equivalent” amino acids of TbCet1 and yeast Cet1 on manganese-dependent ATP hydrolysis (16Ho C.K. Pei Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34151-34156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 18Pei Y. Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 17261-17266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The salient point is that the mutational effects are perfectly concordant at seven positions with the exception being the β9 arginine, which is deemed essential in TbCet1 and important in Cet1. The results of this focused mutational analysis indicate that (i) at least six of the putative β strands of TbCet1 probably contribute to the triphosphatase active site and (ii) the active site of TbCet1 is likely to adopt a tunnel fold analogous to that seen in the Cet1 crystal structure. Purification and Characterization of Recombinant Native TbCet1—The His10-Smt3 domain was removed by treatment of the His10-Smt3-TbCet1 protein with purified His6-tagged Ulp1, a Smt3-specific protease that hydrolyzes the polypeptide chain at the junction between His10-Smt3 and the fused downstream protein (27Mossessova E. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 865-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). The tag-free native TbCet1 was purified away from the His10-Smt3 fragment by phosphocellulose and nickel-agarose chromatography. SDS-PAGE analysis of the native TbCet1 preparation revealed a predominant 32-kDa polypeptide and no trace of the original His10-Smt3-TbCet1 fusion protein (Fig. 3A). N-terminal sequence analysis confirmed that the 32-kDa polypeptide corresponds to native TbCet1 (see below). Native TbCet1 catalyzed manganese-dependent hydrolysis of 32Pi from 0.2 mm [γ-32P]ATP. Product formation was proportional to enzyme concentration, and the reaction proceeded to completion at saturating TbCet1 (Fig. 3B). Native TbCet1 released 1.82 nmol of 32Pi/ng protein during a 15-min reaction, corresponding to a turnover number of 59 s-1 (similar to that of the Smt3-TbCet1 fusion protein). The ATPase activity of native TbCet1 increased with ATP concentration in the range of 5-40 μm and leveled off at 40-80 μm. A Km of 25 μm ATP was calculated from a double-reciprocal plot of the data (Fig. 3C). Structure Probing of Native TbCet1 by Limited Proteolysis— Native TbCet1 was subjected to proteolysis with increasing amounts of trypsin or chymotrypsin. N-terminal sequencing of the undigested TbCet1 polypeptide by automated Edman chemistry after transfer from an SDS gel to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane confirmed that the N-terminal sequence (SMEATER) corresponded to that of the native TbCet1 (MEATER) plus a single N-terminal serine derived from the P1 position of the Smt3 cleavage site (Fig. 4). Initial scission of the 32-kDa TbCet1 protein by trypsin yielded two major products, an ∼23-kDa doublet and a single lower molecular mass species of <10 kDa (Fig. 4). The upper and lower components of the doublet had overlapping N-terminal sequences (83KTRTEVM and 84TRTEVMP) arising through trypsin cleavage at adjacent residues Arg-82 and Lys-83, respectively, which are located between the putative equivalents of Cet1 strands β1 and β5 (Fig. 1). The smaller species retained the intact N terminus (SMEATER). Thus, trypsin cleavage at two tightly clustered sites split the enzyme into a ∼9-kDa N-terminal fragment and a ∼23-kDa carboxyl domain. We surmise that the C-terminal domain fragments are themselves tightly folded, insofar as they were resistant to digestion by concentrations of trypsin sufficient to cleave all of the input TbCet1 (Fig. 4). In contrast, the N-terminal fragment was converted at higher trypsin concentration into a lower molecular weight peptide with an N-terminal sequence (11ERNERND) indicative of secondary tryptic cleavage at residue Arg-10. Treatment of TbCet1 with limiting concentrations of chymotrypsin yielded a strikingly similar pattern comprising a doublet of ∼23 kDa and a single peptide of ∼9 kDa (Fig. 4). The 9-kDa chymotryptic digestion product retained the original N terminus (SMEATER). The upper and lower components of the chymotryptic doublet had identical N-terminal sequences (76KGRRARK83) derived from scission at residue Trp-76, which is situated just proximal to Arg-82 and Lys-83, the major sites accessible to trypsin. (The two components of the chymotrypsin doublet obviously differ at their C termini, implying the existence of a chymotrypsin-sensitive site close to the C terminus of native TbCet1.) The results of the proteolytic analysis suggest that TbCet1 is a compact protein punctuated by a surface-accessible loop between the two of the putative β strands of its tunnel. N-terminal Deletions of TbCet1—The N-terminal segment of TbCet1 is extremely hydrophilic. 17 of the first 22 side chains are either positively or negatively charged (Fig. 3). The trypsin sensitivity of the N-terminal Arg-10/Glu-11 dipeptide suggested that the N-terminal segment might be flexible or surface-exposed, in which case it might not be critical for catalysis. To test this idea, we engineered a deletion mutant NΔ22 containing the TbCet1-(23-301) polypeptide fused to His10-Smt3. A more extensive truncation, NΔ33, was also constructed as a His10-Smt3 fusion. The two truncated fusion proteins were produced in bacteria and purified from soluble lysates by nickel-agarose chromatography. The His10-Smt3 tags were removed with Ulp1, and the native forms of NΔ22 and NΔ33 were isolated by phosphocellulose and nickel-agarose chromatography. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the truncated enzymes were pure and that they displayed the expected incremental shifts in electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 3A). The ATPase-specific activities of NΔ22 and NΔ33 were 46 and 30% of the activity of full-length native TbCet1, respectively (Fig. 3B). These effects do not meet the 5-fold criterion of significance that we used above to designate a mutated structural element as being important for triphosphatase activity. We conclude that the N terminus is dispensable for TbCet1 function in vitro and as few as 19 amino acids upstream of the first catalytic glutamate (Glu-54) in the putative β1 strand suffice for catalysis.

https://openalex.org/W2023756559,"Hemolysin E (HlyE) is a 34 kDa protein toxin, recently isolated from a pathogenic strain of Escherichia coli, which is believed to exert its toxic activity via formation of pores in the target cell membrane. With the goal of understanding the involvement of different segments of hemolysin E in the membrane interaction and assembly of the toxin, a conserved, amphipathic leucine zipper-like motif has been identified. In order to evaluate the possible structural and functional roles of this segment in HlyE, a 30-residue peptide (H-205) corresponding to the leucine zipper motif (amino acid 205-234) and two mutant peptides of the same size were synthesized and labeled by fluorescent probes at their N termini. The results show that the wild-type H-205 binds to both zwitterionic (PC/Chol) and negatively charged (PC/PG/Chol) phospholipid vesicles and also self-assemble therein. Detailed membrane-binding experiments revealed that this synthetic motif (H-205) formed large aggregates and inserted into the bilayer of only negatively charged lipid vesicles but not of zwitterionic membrane. Although both the mutants bound to zwitterionic and negatively charged lipid vesicles, neither of them inserted into the lipid bilayers nor assembled in any of these lipid vesicles. Furthermore, H-205 adopted a significant helical structure in membrane mimetic environments and induced the permeation of monovalent ions and release of entrapped calcein across the phospholipid vesicles more efficiently than the mutant peptides. The results presented here indicate that this H-205 (amino acid 205-234) segment may be an important structural element in hemolysin E, which could play a significant role in the binding and assembly of the toxin in the target cell membrane and its destabilization.

Proteinaceous toxins are often major weapons of pathogenic organisms to invade their target cells and overcome the host defense system. Hemolysin E, also known as cytolysin A (ClyA) and silent hemolysin A (SheA), is a recently identified cytotoxic agent from a pathogenic strain of Escherichia coli (1Oscarsson J. Mizunoe Y. Uhlin B.E.

Bacteria expressing hemolysin E are able to lyse erythrocytes from several mammalian species including human in both solid and liquid media (1Oscarsson J. Mizunoe Y. Uhlin B.E. Haydon D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 2Del Castillo F.J. Leal S.C. Moreno F. del Castillo I. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Macrophages grown in tissue culture media are also lysed by an E. coli strain expressing HlyE (9Oscarsson J Mizunoe Y. Li L. Lai L.H. Wieslander A. Uhlin B.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1226-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Sequence comparisons show that typhoid-causing bacterium Salmonella typhi and dysentery-causing organism Shigella flexneri express highly homologous proteins to HlyE of E. coli (10Wallace A.J Stillman T.J. Atkins A. Jamieson S.J. Bullough P.A. Green J. Artymiuk P.J. Cell. 2000; 100: 265-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the expression of HlyE in the absence of the RTX-family toxins is sufficient to give a hemolytic phenotype of E. coli (11Ralph E.T. Guest J.R. Green J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10449-10452Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Recently hlye homologous genes have been cloned from human-specific Salmonella enterica serovars Typhi and Paratyphi A and the hemolytic activity of the expressed proteins have been characterized in detail (12Oscarsson J. Westermark M. Löfdahl S. Olsen B. Palmgren H. Mizunoe Y. Wai S.N. Uhlin B.E. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 5759-5769Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). All these data indicate that HlyE similar to other hemolysins (13Welch R.A. Dellinger E.P. Minshew B. Falkow S. Nature. 1981; 294: 665-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 14Welch R.A. Falkow S. Infect. Immun. 1984; 43: 156-160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is likely to be a significant virulence factor responsible for pathogenic infection in human. Experiments in lipid bilayer indicated that hemolysin E forms pores in membrane (4Ludwig A. Bauer S. Benz R. Bergmann B. Goebel W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 7Ludwig A. Tengel C. Bauer S. Bubert A. Benz R. Mollenkopf H.J. Goebel W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 474-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This pore-forming activity of the toxin is considered to be associated with the infection of the pathogenic organism in the target cell. Crystal structure of the water-soluble form of the toxin has been solved at high resolution, which showed that the toxin mainly consists of long helical structures (10Wallace A.J Stillman T.J. Atkins A. Jamieson S.J. Bullough P.A. Green J. Artymiuk P.J. Cell. 2000; 100: 265-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In a recent structure-function study, it has been reported that the deletion of 37 amino acids, by site-directed mutagenesis, from the C-terminal rendered the toxin non-hemolytic (15Atkins A. Wyborn N.R. Wallace A.J. Stillman T.J. Black L.K. Fielding A.B. Hisakado M Artymiuk P.J. Green J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41150-41155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, this loss of hemolytic activity of hemolysin E may be due to misfolding of the protein, resulted from the deletion of amino acids (15Atkins A. Wyborn N.R. Wallace A.J. Stillman T.J. Black L.K. Fielding A.B. Hisakado M Artymiuk P.J. Green J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41150-41155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although hemolysin E has been characterized biochemically and biophysically by several groups, a number of questions remain to be answered. For example, it is not known how this toxin assembles in membrane and which part of the toxin is involved in membrane interaction and pore formation. With the primary objective to find out possible membrane-interacting domains in hemolysin E, a conserved, amphipathic leucine zipper-like motif has been identified. This leucine zipper-like motif (amino acid 205-234) contains three heptads with two heptadic positions occupied by leucine and isoleucine and other two positions occupied by valine and phenylalanine. Three peptides including the wild type (H-205) and two mutants have been designed and synthesized from this hemolysin E segment. One of the mutants (Mu1-H-205) is a scrambled peptide in which the positions of two heptadic amino acids, leucine and isoleucine, were interchanged with the positions of two hydrophilic amino acids lysine and serine keeping the amino acid composition of the peptide the same as the wild type. In the other mutant (Mu2-H-205), a heptadic leucine was replaced by another hydrophobic and helix-forming amino acid alanine. In order to detect its membrane interaction and assembly in aqueous and in membrane environment, peptides were labeled by fluorescent probes NBD 1The abbreviations used are: NBD7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazoleFmocN-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonylPBSphosphate-buffered salineTFEtrifluoroethanolSUVsmall unilamellar vesiclesPCphosphatidylcholinePGphosphatidylglycerolCholcholesterol. (7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole) and rhodamine (tetramethylrhodamine, Rho). Secondary structures, membrane interaction, assembly and membrane bilayer destabilization ability of H-205 and its analogues were studied. The results obtained from these studies have been discussed in terms of the role of this conserved segment in hemolysin E-mediated binding and destabilization of the target cell membrane. 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl phosphate-buffered saline trifluoroethanol small unilamellar vesicles phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylglycerol cholesterol. Materials—Rink amide MBHA resin (loading capacity: 0.4-0.8 mmol/g) and all the N-α-Fmoc and necessary side-chain protected amino acids were purchased from Novabiochem, Switzerland. Coupling reagents for peptide synthesis like 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT), di-isopropylcarbodiimide (DIC), 1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU), and N,N′-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) were purchased from Sigma. Dichloromethane, N,N′ dimethylformamide (DMF) and piperidine were of standard grades and procured from reputed local companies. Acetonitrile (HPLC grade) was procured from Merck, India while trifluoroacetic acid, trifluoroethanol (TFE), and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) were purchased from Sigma. Egg phosphatidylcholine (PC) and egg phosphatidylglycerol (PG) were obtained from Northern Lipids Inc., Canada while cholesterol (Chol) was purchased from Sigma. 3,3′-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide (diS-C3-5), NBD-fluoride (4-fluoro-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1, 3-diazole) and tetramethylrhodamine succinimidyl ester were procured from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The rest of the reagents were of analytical grade and procured locally; buffers were prepared in milli Q water. Peptide Synthesis, Fluorescent Labeling, and Purification—All the peptides were synthesized manually on solid phase. Stepwise solid phase syntheses were carried out on rink amide MBHA resin (0.15 mmol) utilizing the standard Fmoc chemistry, employing DIC/HOBT or TBTU/HOBT/DIPEA coupling procedure (16Fields G.B. Noble R.L. Int. J. Pep. Prot. Res. 1990; 35: 161-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (2333) Google Scholar, 17Wild C. Oas T. Mcdanal C. Bolognesi D. Matthews T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cook P. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 34: 595Crossref PubMed Scopus (3510) Google Scholar) for primary amines and chloranil test for secondary amine (20Vojkovsky T. Pept. Res. 1995; 8: 236PubMed Google Scholar). After the synthesis was over, each peptide was cleaved from the resin with simultaneous de-protection of side chains by treatment with a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid/phenol/thioanisole/1,2-ethanedithiol/water (82.5:5:5:2.5:5 v/v) for 6-7 h. Labeling at the N terminus of a peptide was achieved by a standard procedure reported earlier (21Rapaport D. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6502-6509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ghosh J.K. Ovadia M. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15451-15462Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In brief, 15-20 mg of resin-bound peptide was treated with 25% piperidine (in DMF) to remove the Fmoc group from the N-terminal amino group. The resin was washed and dried. Then Fmoc de-protected resin-bound peptides were incubated with tetramethylrhodamine succinimidyl ester (2-3 equiv.) in dimethylformamide in the presence of 5% diisopropylethylamine for 48-72 h, which ultimately resulted in the formation of Nα-Rho-peptides. Similarly, resin-bound peptides were treated with NBD-fluoride (2-3 equiv.) to obtain Nα-NBD-peptides. After sufficient labeling, the resins were washed with DMF and DCM in order to remove the unreacted probe. The peptides were cleaved from the resin as above and precipitated with dry ether. All the peptides were purified by RP-HPLC on an analytical Vydac C4 column using a linear gradient of 0-80% acetonitrile in 45 min with a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. Both acetonitrile and water contained 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The purified peptides were ∼90% homogeneous as shown by HPLC. Each peptide was subjected to ES-MS analysis for the detection of molecular mass. Preparation of Small Unilamellar Vesicles (SUVs)—SUVs were prepared by a standard procedure (23Shai Y. Hadari Y.R. Finkels A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22346-22354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Ghosh J.K. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7252-7259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) as follows. Dry lipids (either PC/cholesterol (8:1 w/w) or PC/PG/cholesterol (4:4:1 w/w)) of required amounts were dissolved in CHCl3/MeOH (2:1 v/v) in small glass vial. Solvents were evaporated under a stream of nitrogen, which resulted in the formation of a thin film on the wall of glass vessel. The thin film was resuspended in buffer at a concentration of 8.2 mg/ml by vortex mixing. The lipid dispersions were then sonicated in a bath-type sonicator (Laboratory Supplies Company, New York) for 10-20 min until it became transparent. The lipid concentration was determined by phosphorus estimation (25Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism (CD) Experiments—The CD spectra of peptides were recorded in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4), 40% TFE, and 1% SDS by utilizing a Jasco J-710 spectropolarimeter. The spectropolarimeter was calibrated routinely with 10-camphor sulfonic acid. The samples were scanned at room temperature (∼30 °C) with the help of a capped quartz cuvette of 0.2-cm path length in the wavelength range of 250-195 nm. An average of 4-6 scans were taken for each sample with a scan speed of 20 nm/min and data interval of 0.5 nm for peptide concentration of 10-20 μm. The fractional helicities were calculated by Equation 1 (26Greenfield N. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3322) Google Scholar, 27Wu C.S.C. Ikeda K. Yang J.T. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 566-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar),Fh=[θ]222-[θ]2220[θ]222100-[θ]2220(Eq. 1) where [θ]222 was the experimentally observed mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm. The values for [θ]222100 and [θ]2220 that correspond to 100 and 0% helix contents were considered to have mean residue ellipticity values of -32,000 and -2,000, respectively, at 222 nm (27Wu C.S.C. Ikeda K. Yang J.T. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 566-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Membrane Binding Experiments—The affinities of the peptides for phospholipid vesicles were determined by binding experiments as reported earlier (28Schwarz G. Gerke H. Rizzo V. Stankowski S. Biophys. J. 1987; 52: 685-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 29Beschiaschvili G. Seelig J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 30Rapaport D. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23769-23775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,22Ghosh J.K. Ovadia M. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15451-15462Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In brief, small unilamellar vesicles were added gradually to 0.2-0.3 μm of NBD-labeled peptide at room temperature. Fluorescence intensities of NBD-labeled peptides alone and after each addition of lipid vesicles were recorded on a PerkinElmer spectrofluorimeter LS-50B, with the excitation set at 467 nm and emission at 528 nm. The excitation and emission slits were fixed at 8 and 6 nm, respectively. The contributions of lipid to any of the recorded signal were measured by titrating the unlabeled peptide (concentration same as NBD-labeled peptide) with the same amount of lipid vesicles and were subtracted from the original signal. The binding isotherms were analyzed by Equation 2,Xb*=Kp*Cf(Eq. 2) where Xb* is defined as the molar ratio of bound peptide per 60% of the total lipid, assuming that the peptides were initially partitioned only over the outer leaflet of the SUV as suggested by Beschiaschvili and Seelig (29Beschiaschvili G. Seelig J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Kp* represents the partition coefficient and Cf indicates the concentration of the free peptide at equilibrium. Xb was calculated by extrapolating the fluorescence signal Finfinity (fluorescence signal when all the peptides were bound to lipid) from a double-reciprocal plot of F (peptide fluorescence in the presence of lipid) versus CL (lipid concentration). Fraction of peptide bound (fb) was determined by Equation 3,fb=(F-F0)/(Finfinity-F0)(Eq. 3) where F is the fluorescence of the peptide when it is bound to lipid and F0 is the fluorescence of the peptide in its unbound state. If fb is known, Cf can easily be calculated for each concentration of the lipid. Kp* can easily be determined from the slope of the plot of Xb* and Cf. Enzymatic Cleavage Experiments—In order to detect the location of a NBD-labeled peptide in its membrane-bound state, enzymatic cleavage experiments were performed as reported earlier (31Gazit E. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3429-3436Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 22Ghosh J.K. Ovadia M. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15451-15462Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In brief, lipid vesicles made of either PC/Chol or PC/PG/Chol were first added to the NBD-labeled peptide. When major portion of the peptide was bound to the lipid vesicles as detected by the saturation of the fluorescence level, proteinase-k (final concentration, 10.0 μg/ml) was added. In this experiment fluorescence of NBD-labeled peptide was recorded at 528 nm with respect to time (in s) with excitation wavelength set at 467 nm. In the control experiment proteinase-k was first added to NBD-labeled peptide, and then lipid vesicles were added. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer Experiment—Fluorescence energy transfer experiments were performed with excitation wavelength set at 467 nm and emission range of 500-600 nm. Desired amount of the NBD-labeled peptide was taken in a fluorimeter cuvette. Sufficient amounts of the phospholipid vesicles were added to the NBD-labeled peptide to ensure that the peptides were bound to the membrane. Now Rho-labeled acceptor peptide was added to the donor peptide-lipid complex. Energy transfer from donor to acceptor was determined by subtracting the acceptor fluorescence in the presence of lipid and unlabeled donor from the fluorescence signal obtained in the presence of donor, acceptor and lipid vesicles. The efficiency of energy transfer (E) was determined by the decrease in donor fluorescence in the presence of the acceptor as reported earlier (32Gazit E. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2571-2578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 22Ghosh J.K. Ovadia M. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15451-15462Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The percentage of energy transfer was calculated by Equation 4,E={(ID0-IDA)/ID0}×100(Eq. 4) where ID0 and IDA are the fluorescence intensities of the NBD-labeled donor peptide in the absence and presence of the Rho-labeled acceptor peptide respectively at the emission maxima of the donor after correcting the light scattering of the lipid vesicles and emission of the acceptor. Membrane Permeability Assays: Dissipation of Diffusion Potential from the Small Unilamellar Lipid Vesicles—The ability of the peptides to destabilize the phospholipid bilayer was detected by their efficacy to dissipate the diffusion potential across the membrane. The experiments were performed as follows (33Sims P.J. Waggoner A.S. Wang C.H. Hoffmann J.R. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3315-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 34Loew L.M. Rosenberg I. Bridge M. Gitler C. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 837-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Lipid vesicles were prepared in K+ buffer (50 mm K2SO4/25 mm HEPES sulfate, pH 6.8). Required amounts of the lipid vesicles were mixed with isotonic (K+-free) Na+ buffer (50 mm Na2SO4/25 mm HEPES sulfate, pH 6.8) followed by the addition of the potential sensitive dye diS-C3-5. Addition of valinomycin created a negative potential inside the lipid vesicles by the selective efflux of K+ ions from the lipid vesicles. As a result of that a quenching of the fluorescence of the dye occurred. When the dye exhibited a steady fluorescence level, peptides were added. Membrane permeability of the peptide was detected by the increase in fluorescence, which resulted from the dissipation of diffusion potential. Fluorescence was monitored at 670 nm with respect to time (s) with excitation wavelength of 620 nm. The peptide-induced dissipation of diffusion potential was measured in terms of percentage of fluorescence recovery (Ft) as defined by Refs. 21Rapaport D. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6502-6509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 22Ghosh J.K. Ovadia M. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15451-15462Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar in Equation 5,Ft=[(It-I0)/(If-I0)]×100&percnt;(Eq. 5) where It = the observed fluorescence after the addition of a peptide at time t (10 min after the addition of the peptide), I0 = the fluorescence after the addition valinomycin and If = the total fluorescence observed before the addition of valinomycin. Calcein Release from Calcein-entrapped Lipid Vesicles—Peptide induced release of calcein from calcein-entrapped vesicles is often employed to detect the pore-forming activity of proteins and peptides. Calcein-entrapped lipid vesicles were prepared with a self-quenching concentration (60 mm) of the dye in 10 mm HEPES at pH 7.4 as reported earlier (35Allen T.M. Cleland L.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 597: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 36Pouny Y. Rapaport D. Mor A. Nicolas P. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12416-12423Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Briefly, thin film of lipid (either PC/PG/Chol or PC/Chol) was re-suspended in calcein solution, vortexed for 1-2 min and then sonicated in a bath-type sonicator. The non-encapsulated calcein was removed from the liposome suspension by gel filtration using a Sephadex G-50 column. Usually lipid vesicles are diluted to ∼10-fold after passing through a G-50 column. The eluted calcein-entrapped vesicles were diluted further in the same buffer to a final lipid concentration of 3.0 μm for the experiment. Peptide-induced release of calcein from the lipid vesicles was monitored by the increase in fluorescence due to the dilution of the dye from its self-quenched concentration. Fluorescence was monitored at room temperature with excitation and emission wavelengths fixed at 490 and 520 nm, respectively. Calcein release as measured by the fluorescence recovery is defined by the same equation as used to determine the dissipation of diffusion potential. However, in this case If, the total fluorescence, was determined after the addition of Triton X-100 (0.1% final concentration) to the dye-entrapped vesicle suspension. Hemolysin E is a recently identified toxin from a pathogenic strain of E. coli. Since it is a pore-forming toxin, membrane-interaction and assembly therein are the key steps, associated with its mechanism of action.

In order to understand the possible contribution of different parts of hemolysin E to its membrane interaction and assembly, we have identified an amphipathic leucine zipper-like motif H-205 (amino acid 205-234) in this toxin. Sequence alignment, shown in panel A of Fig. 1, clearly describes that this particular segment and the heptadic amino acids are conserved in the homologous proteins of the same family. Panel B of Fig. 1 depicts all the sequences of the peptides including their NBD- and Rho-labeled analogues, used in this study. H-205 and two mutants were synthesized by standard solid phase synthesis. Experimental mass of each of the peptides as detected by ES-MS was within 0.5 Da of the respective desired mass. Panel C of Fig. 1 shows the helical-wheel projections of H-205 and Mu1-H-205. Panel D of Fig. 1 represents the Schiffer Edmundson wheel projections of the wild-type H-205, which shows the segregation of hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids in opposite sides, indicating amphipathic nature of the peptide.

The classical opioid prohormones can generate several bioactive peptides, and these divergent families of prohormones share a common well conserved ancestral opioid motif (Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe). Evidence from pharmacological and molecular cloning studies indicates the presence of multiple isoforms of opioid ligands and receptors that are as yet uncharacterized. To identify potential new members we used the opioid motif as an anchor sequence and isolated two distinct isoforms (Xen-dorphins A and B) of an opioid prohormone from Xenopus laevis brain cDNA library. Xen-dorphin prohormones can generate multiple novel opioid ligands distinct from the known members of this family. Both isoforms are present in a wide variety of tissues including the brain. Two potential bioactive peptides, Xen-dorphin-1A and -1B, that were chemically synthesized showed opioid agonist activity in frog and rat brain membranes using a [35S]GTPγS assay. Initial radioligand binding experiments demonstrated that Xen-dorphin-1B binds with high affinity to opioid receptor(s) and with potential preference to the kappa-opioid receptor subtype. Cloning of the Xen-dorphin prohormone provides new evidence for the potential presence of other members in the opioid peptide superfamily.

This suggests there are as yet uncharacterized endogenous opioid ligands and receptors. The opioid receptors mu, delta, and kappa belong to the family of G-protein-coupled receptors with a putative structure of seven transmembrane domains (8Chen Y. Mestek A. Liu J. Hurley J.A. Yu L.

The enkephalin motif is therefore a well conserved ancestral sequence in a large and divergent family of opioid-like prohormones, which can be used to identify other as yet uncharacterized and structurally distinct endogenous opioid-like peptides.Frogs and toads are rich sources of opioid peptides (19Cone R.I.

In addition to the classical mammalian-like peptides, two extremely potent opioid prohormones, the dermorphins and deltorphins, have been isolated from the skin of the poison-arrow frog Phyllomedusa. These amphibian peptides have been shown to have high affinities for mammalian receptors (24Negri L. Erspamer G.F. Severini C. Potenza R.L. Melchiorri P. Erspamer V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7203-7207Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In this study we used the frog Xenopus laevis, because ligands and receptors previously isolated from this species were represented in mammals without exception (25Erspamer V. Melchiorri P. Espamer C.F. Negri L. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1978; 106: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To discover potential new ligands of the opioid family, RT-PCR 1The abbreviations used are: RT-PCRreverse transcriptase-PCRGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphateDAMGO[d-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalinDIDIIle5,6-deltorphin-II.1The abbreviations used are: RT-PCRreverse transcriptase-PCRGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphateDAMGO[d-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalinDIDIIle5,6-deltorphin-II. was performed using the enkephalin motif (YGGF) as an anchor sequence to generate partial cDNAs. Multiple full-length cDNA clones were isolated from a X. laevis brain cDNA library, which encodes for two distinct isoforms of an opioid prohormone. Here we report the isolation of two novel opioid prohormone isoforms, Xen-dorphin A and B, from the X. laevis brain, which are distinct from proenkephalin and prodynorphin. Additionally, we demonstrate the functional activity of potential peptides from the isoforms of this prohormone in the mammalian brain.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals and Reagents—African clawed frogs (X. laevis) were obtained from California Zoological Supply (Santa Ana, CA). Green frogs for receptor binding studies (Rana esculenta) were from a local fishing company in Szeged, Hungary. Wistar rats were provided by the Biological Research Center Animal House in Szeged, Hungary. Enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), or Promega (Madison, WI). 32P-Labeled isotopes and tritiated [d-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalin ([3H]DAMGO, 56 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [3H]Naloxone (72 Ci/mmol), [3H-Ile5,6]deltorphin-II ([3H]DIDI, 49 Ci/mmol), and [3H]dynorphin-(1-17 (40 Ci/mmol) were prepared in the Biological Research Center Isotope Laboratory (Szeged, Hungary) as described previously (26Simon J. Szucs M. Benyhe S. Borsodi A. Zeman P. Wollemann M. J. Neurochem. 1984; 43: 957-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 27Nevin S.T. Kabasakal L. Otvos F. Toth G. Borsodi A. Neuropeptides. 1994; 26: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Synthesis of the unlabeled peptides was carried out by the solid-phase method (AdvanceChem Tech, M200) using tert-butoxycarbonyl chemistry, followed by high pressure liquid chromatography purification (Merck) on a Vydac 218TP54 column. Purified peptides were identified by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. Details of the synthesis will be published elsewhere.Reverse Transcription and Polymerase Chain Reaction—RT-PCR was performed as described previously (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis R.T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For cloning the partial cDNAs, 5 μg of total RNA from X. laevis brain tissue was reverse-transcribed with 25 pmol of oligo(dT)18, 1× first strand buffer, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 500 μm dNTPs, and 200 units of superscript-II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in a 20-μl volume at 37 °C for 1 h. Amplification was performed with a degenerate primer corresponding to the N terminus sequence Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe and oligo(dT). Reaction conditions were 10 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 1.25 mm MgCl2, 0.3 μm dNTPs, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Promega), for 35 cycles at 92 °C × 1 min, 55 °C × 1 min, and 72 °C × 1.5 min. An aliquot (15 μl) of the product was electrophoresed. A single abundant 650-nucleotide fragment was gel-isolated and subcloned into a PCR plasmid vector (pGEM-T, Promega). Miniprep DNAs prepared from multiple colonies were sequenced and analyzed.cDNA Library Construction and Screening—Poly(A+) RNA was prepared by standard methods (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis R.T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A brain cDNA library was prepared per the vendor's protocol (Stratagene, Zap Express) with a few modifications as described previously (29Nagalla S.R. Gibson B.W. Tang D. Reeve Jr., J.R. Spindel E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6916-6922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 1.0 × 106 plaque-forming units were screened using a 32P-labeled cRNA probe generated from the partial cDNA isolated by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction as indicated elsewhere (30Nagalla S.R.

Hybridization was performed at 45 °C in 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 50 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, 0.5% SDS, and sonicated denatured salmon sperm (200 μg/ml). Hybridizing clones were plaque-purified and DNA sequence analysis was performed on both strands using an ABI 377 automated sequencer. Sequence alignments were performed using the DNA star program (Madison, WI).Tissue Distribution—Total RNAs from 11 X. laevis organs were reverse-transcribed followed by 35 cycles of amplification with a primer pair (5′-tcttatcttctccaagaaggg and 3′-gaggtctcgtagtgtatattt), which recognized both isoforms. The PCR products were cleaned using a PCR purification column (Promega), and 10 μl of product was digested with the restriction enzyme HindIII at 37 °C for 3 h and resolved on a 3% Nuseive agarose gel.Brain Membrane Preparation—Rat brain membranes were prepared according to a method of Pasternak with small modifications, as described in Ref. 31Simon J. Benyhe S. Abutidze K. Borsodi A. Szucs M. Toth G. Wollemann M. J. Neurochem. 1986; 46: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, with small modifications. Wistar rats were decapitated, and the brains, without cerebella, were rapidly removed and homogenized in 30 volumes of ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) buffer in a Teflon-glass homogenizer. After centrifugation (40,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min), the pellet was resuspended in 30 volumes of the same buffer and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C to remove endogenous opioids. Centrifugation was repeated, and the final pellet was suspended in 5 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer supplemented with 0.32 m sucrose (pH 7.4) and stored in 5-ml aliquots at -70 °C. Before use, membranes were thawed and centrifuged (40,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min) to remove the sucrose. The resulting pellet was taken up in fresh 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) buffer and immediately used. Frog (R. esculenta) brain membranes were prepared as described previously (26Simon J. Szucs M. Benyhe S. Borsodi A. Zeman P. Wollemann M. J. Neurochem. 1984; 43: 957-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Whole brains were homogenized in 10 volumes of ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) buffer containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml bacitracin, and 40 kIU of aprotinin. The homogenate was centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was suspended in the above buffer containing 0.32 m sucrose and stored at -70 °C until use. On the day of the assays, membranes were washed and centrifuged to eliminate sucrose, resuspended in fresh buffer, and used immediately.Radioligand Binding Experiments—All binding tests were carried out in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) buffer containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in a final volume of 1 ml containing 0.3-0.4 mg/ml brain membrane protein. In the case of [3H]dynorphin-(1-17) isotope, the experiments were performed in plastic tubes, and the buffer was supplemented with 2 mm MgCl2. Incubations were started with the addition of membrane suspension and terminated by rapid filtration through Whatman GF/B or GF/C glass fiber filters using a Brandel cell harvester. Filters were washed with 3 × 5 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4). When the [3H]dynorphin-(1-17) isotope was used, filters were presoaked in 0.3% polyethyleneimine at pH 10, and the washing buffer contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (pH 7.4). The radioactivity was measured in a toluene-based scintillation mixture using a Wallac 1409 scintillation counter. All experiments were performed in duplicate and repeated at least three times. Competition curves were analyzed by GraphPad Prism software.[35S]GTPγS Binding Assay—Agonist-induced G-protein activation was measured as described by Traynor and Nahorsky (32Traynor J.R. Nahorsky S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 848-854PubMed Google Scholar). Tubes containing 10 μg of membrane protein, 30 μm guanosine diphosphate, opioid ligand (10-5-10-9m), and 0.05 nm [35S]GTPγS all in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 3 mm MgCl2 in a final volume of 1 ml were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. Nonstimulated activity was measured in the absence of the tested peptide. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 100 μm unlabeled GTPγS. The reaction was started by the addition of [35S]GTPγS and terminated by filtrating the samples through Whatman GF/B glass fiber filters. Filters were washed three times with ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) using a Brandel cell harvester and then were dried. Radioactivity was measured in a Wallac 1409 scintillation counter using a toluene-based scintillation mixture. Stimulation is given as percent of the specific binding. Data were calculated from three independent experiments performed in triplicate using the GraphPad Prism computer program. Mean values ± S.E. are given.RESULTSTo identify new opioid polypeptide precursor molecules we have used the conserved opioid motif, YGGF, and applied RT-PCR to generate partial cDNAs representing a novel opioid-like prohormone (Xen-dorphin). Using the partial cDNA, full-length coding sequences corresponding to isoforms of this prohormone (Xen-dorphins A and B) were isolated from a X. laevis brain cDNA library. Nucleotide sequence analysis of Xen-dorphins A and B show multiple nucleotide substitutions (Fig. 1). The nucleotide differences between the two forms also resulted in amino acid substitutions that could produce potentially distinct ligands (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Deduced amino acid sequence of the amphibian Xen-dorphin A and B prohormones. Residues differing between A and B are boxed. Potential peptides that can originate from Xen-dorphin B are highlighted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Tissue distribution of the Xen-dorphin A and B isoforms was determined using RT-PCR. A primer pair that recognizes both forms (202 nucleotides in size) was used to amplify the prohormone from total RNA of various tissues. Digestion of the PCR product with HindIII restriction enzyme cleaved Xen-dorphin A, but not Xen-dorphin B, into two fragments of 148 and 54 nucleotides. Although both forms are widely expressed, Xen-dorphin A is expressed at a higher level than Xen-dorphin B in most of the tissues analyzed (Fig. 3).Fig. 3a, tissue distribution of Xen-dorphin A and B. b, PCR product generated from a common set of primers for both Xen-dorphin A and B and digested with Hind III, which is unique to Xen-dorphin A, shows the relative abundance of both forms of Xen-dorphins. The 202-bp band represents Xen-dorphin B, and the 148- and 54-bp bands represent the Xen-dorphin A digest.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We determined the binding characteristics and the functional biochemical properties of two potential opioid-like peptides of the Xen-dorphin prohormone (isoforms A and B of the Xen-dorphin-1 peptides, which differ in two amino acids, Fig. 2). These hexadecapeptides, termed Xen-dorphin-1A (YGGFIRKPDKNKFLNG) and Xen-dorphin-1B (YGGFIRKPDKYKFLNA), have been synthesized and tested in radioligand binding assays. Wistar rat and green frog (R. esculenta) brain membrane preparations were used as tissue sources of mammalian and amphibian opioid receptors. Displacement experiments with the general opioid antagonist [3H]naloxone (1 nm) were carried out in the presence and absence of 100 mm NaCl, and the so-called sodium index (INa) was determined (Table I). Sodium index is defined as the ratio of the Ki values of the competitor in the presence and absence of 100 mm NaCl and is widely accepted in characterizing ligand-receptor interactions (33Pert C.B. Pasternak G. Snyder S.H. Science. 1973; 182: 1359-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Both peptides tested had high affinity toward opioid binding sites, with Ki values of 1.44 and 7.3 nm for Xen-dorphin-1B and -1A, respectively. The presence of Na+ ions in the assay mixtures significantly reduced the affinity of the peptides (413.2 and 355.4 nm for Xen-dorphin-1B and -1A, respectively) suggesting the in vitro opioid agonist nature of the Xenopus oligopeptides.Table IEffect of Xen-dorphin peptides in equilibrium competition studies measured by [3H]naloxone in rat brain membranesPeptideKi (↑ Na)Ki (+Na)Sodium indexaSodium indices for pure agonists ≥10 and for pure antagonists ≤2 (Ref. 32).

Open table in a new tab To assess the affinity and selectivity profile of Xen-dorphin-1B for the three types of opioid receptors (mu, delta, and kappa) in this initial analysis, a few highly selective heterologous competition assays were carried out with rat brain membranes. Mu, delta, and kappa bindings were determined by [3H]DAMGO, [3H]DIDI, and [3H]dynorphin-A-(1-17), respectively. The representative binding curves of the Xen-dorphin-1B to mu, delta, and kappa binding sites are shown in Fig. 4. Equilibrium inhibition constants (Ki values) representing the binding affinity are summarized in Table II. The highest affinity was observed to potential kappa-receptors (nanomolar Ki value in [3H]dynorphin assays), whereas mu and delta potencies were substantially smaller.Fig. 4Heterologous competition curves for Xen-dorphin-1B binding in rat brain membranes using receptor-type selective assays with selective radioligands.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IIReceptor type selectivity of Xen-dorphin-1B in rat brain membranesReceptor typeLabeled ligandAffinity KiMu[3H]DAMGO222 ± 58Delta[3H]DIDI240 ± 40Kappa[3H]dynorphin-(1-17)6.2 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab A [35S]GTPγS functional assay was used to investigate the effect of Xen-dorphin-1B and -1A upon receptor-mediated activation of regulatory G-proteins in rat and frog brain membrane fractions. Both peptides stimulate [35S]GTPγS binding in rat brain membranes in a dose-dependent manner, with an EC50 of 0.87 ± 0.18 × 10-6m for Xen-dorphin-1B and an EC50 of 1.42 ± 0.12 × 10-6m for Xen-dorphin-1A (Fig. 5, top panel). Similar behavior of Xen-dorphin-1B and -1A in the GTPγS assay was also observed in frog brain membranes (Fig. 5, bottom panel). The EC50 values were 3.71 ± 1.3 × 10-6m in the case of Xen-dorphin-1B and 3.17 ± 1.5 × 10-6m for Xen-dorphin-1A. Xen-dorphin-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding was inhibited by naloxone, proving opioid receptor-mediated events and the opioid agonist character of the peptides (data not shown). When comparing the stimulation of [35S]GTPγS binding induced by the highest concentration of ligands used (10-5m), we can observe the significantly higher stimulation of Xen-dorphin-1B in frog brain membranes than in rat brain membranes (p = 0.0021, Student's t test comparison).Fig. 5Effect of Xen-dorphin-1A and -1B on [35S]GTPγS binding in different membrane preparations.Top panel, stimulation in rat brain membranes; bottom panel, stimulation in frog brain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONUnderstanding opioid effects such as analgesia and complex opioid behavioral effects such as tolerance and dependence have been greatly facilitated by the molecular cloning of opioid receptors and endogenous opioid peptide precursor molecules. Three well characterized opioid prototypic precursors, the proenkephalin (PROENK, which processes enkephalins), prodynorphin (PRODYN, the source of dynorphin A and rimorphin), and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC, a precursor for β-endorphin) are structurally and physiologically different molecules (4Noda M. Furutani Y. Takahashi H. Toyosato M. Hirose T. Inayama S. Nakanishi S. Numa S. Nature. 1982; 295: 202-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 5Kakidani H. Furutani Y. Takahashi H. Noda M.

Numa S. Nature. 1979; 278: 423-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). Yet these opioid molecules share a well conserved common core sequence, YGGF, termed the “opioid motif ” (Fig. 6). Extensive studies in opioid pharmacology indicate that the opioid family is much more diverse, and potentially many forms of ligands as well as their receptors, yet uncharacterized, may still exist. We used the opioid motif to clone a new amphibian brain prohormone, Xen-dorphin, and its isoforms Xen-dorphins A and B. The presence of multiple differences in nucleotides between Xen-dorphin A (1447 nucleotides) and Xen-dorphin B (909 nucleotides) suggests that these prohormones potentially could be encoded by two distinct sets of genes. An analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences revealed a typical opioid-like prohormone structure. The Xen-dorphin B prohormone, as shown in Fig. 2, contains several dibasic and monobasic cleavage sites that could generate multiple copies of Leu-enkephalin, a copy of Ile-enkephalin (Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Ile), a copy of dynorphin, and three potentially new oligopeptides named Xen-dorphins 1, 2, and 3. Amino acid comparisons of the Xen-dorphin B prohormone with amphibian enkephalin and mammalian prodynorphin show that the Xen-dorphin prohormone is distinct from these previously cloned precursors. The Xen-dorphin prohormone exhibited only 20 and 30% similarity with Xenopus enkephalin (GenBank™ accession number P01212) and human prodynorphin (GenBank™ accession number NP_077722) precursors, respectively, compared with >60% homology between Xenopus and human enkephalin (GenBank™ accession number NP_006202). Phylogenetic analysis of opioid-like peptide prohormones (DNAstar, version 3.13, Madison, WI) reveals that the Xenopus opioid-like prohormones (XOLP, Xen-dorphins A and B) and a similar opioid-like prohormone isolated from Bombina orientalis 2P. Pattee and S. R. Nagalla, unpublished data, accession number AY188505. are more closely related and distinct from enkephalins, dynorphins, dermorphins, and deltorphins. The presence and high degree of conserved sequence homology between amphibian and mammalian enkephalins indicates that a potential mammalian representative of the Xen-dorphins, distinct from enkephalins, could potentially exist. In addition, the Xen-dorphin prohormone encodes"

FN plays important roles in many physiological events through its binding to cell-surface receptors such as integrins and membrane-bound heparan sulfate proteoglycans (e.g. syndecans) (1.Hynes R.O. Fibronectins. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1990Crossref Google Scholar). FN consists of three types of homologous repeating units (types I–III) and exists as a dimer of 220–250-kDa subunits linked together by a pair of disulfide bonds located at the C-terminal end. The dimeric structure of FN is essential for its self-assembly into the extracellular matrix (2.Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1463-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Many functional domains, including the N-terminal heparin-1/fibrin-1 domain and the central cell-binding domain (CCBD) containing the integrin-binding Arg-Gly-Asp motif, have been shown to be involved in FN matrix assembly (2.Schwarzbauer J.E.

Furthermore, the binding affinity of FN for integrins, particularly α5β1, modulates the deposition of FN in the extracellular matrix (6.Fogerty F.J. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. Mosher D.F. J.

FN is encoded by a single gene, but exhibits molecular heterogeneity arising from alternative splicing of the primary transcript at three distinct regions termed EDA (or EIIIA), EDB (or EIIIB), and IIICS (or V) (8.Schwarzbauer J.E. BioEssays. 1991; 13: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 9.ffrench-Constant C. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). These alternatively spliced regions have been shown to have their own biological activities or to modulate the functions of neighboring domains (10.Humphries M.J. Komoriya A. Akiyama S.K. Olden K.

Chem. 2002; 277: 14467-14474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), thereby mediating cell adhesion to substrates, whereas insertion of EDA adjacent to the CCBD potentiates the cell-adhesive and integrin-binding activities of the CCBD possibly through altering the global conformation of FN (13.Manabe R. Ohe N. Maeda T. Fukuda T. Sekiguchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The biological function of EDB still remains elusive, but embryonic fibroblasts deficient in production of EDB-containing FNs exhibit reduced cell proliferation and FN matrix assembly in vitro (15.Fukuda T. Yoshida N. Kataoka Y. Manabe R. Mizuno-Horikawa Y. Sato M. Kuriyama K. Yasui N. Sekiguchi K. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5603-5610PubMed Google Scholar). Besides these alternatively spliced regions, the III-15 and I-10 modules have been shown to be eliminated from the FN molecule along with the IIICS region by alternative RNA splicing in cartilaginous tissues (17.MacLeod J.N. Burton-Wurster N. Gu D.N. Lust G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18954-18960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This novel FN isoform lacking the region encompassing IIICS through the I-10 module (designated the “V+C” region) appears to be unique to normal cartilaginous tissues because it was barely detectable in osteochondrogenic tumors (18.Matsui Y. Nakata K. Araki N. Ozono K. Fujita Y. Tsumaki N. Kawabata H. Yasui N. Sekiguchi K. Yoshikawa H. Anticancer Res. 2001; 21: 1103-1106PubMed Google Scholar). The function of this cartilage-specific FN isoform remains to be elucidated. In this study, we constructed a mammalian expression plasmid for cartilage-type FN and purified the recombinant FN secreted into the conditioned medium. Comparative analyses of recombinant cartilage-type and plasma-type FNs showed that cartilage-type FN was secreted mainly as a monomer and was barely assembled into FN fibrils. It was also less potent than plasma-type FN in binding to integrin α5β1 and in mediating cell spreading, although it exhibited a strong binding activity for chondroitin sulfate E. cDNA Construction—The cDNA expression vector pAIFNC, which encodes recombinant plasma-type FN (designated rFN/C), was described previously (13.Manabe R. Ohe N. Maeda T. Fukuda T. Sekiguchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). For construction of an expression vector encoding cartilage-type FN, we first isolated total RNA from human rib cartilage and amplified the FN cDNA fragment encoding III-12 through I-12 by reverse transcription-PCR. An internal BglII/NdeI fragment encoding III-14 through I-12 but lacking IIICS through I-10 was excised from the amplified cDNA and substituted for the corresponding fragment in pAIFNC, yielding an expression plasmid encoding recombinant cartilage-type FN (designated rFN/O). For construction of an expression vector encoding monomeric recombinant plasma-type FN (designated rFN/Cm), pAI70F2mono, which encodes the C-terminal 37-kDa region with substitution of Ser for both Cys2427 and Cys2431 within the dimer-forming segment (19.Ichihara-Tanaka K. Titani K. Sekiguchi K. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 907-915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was digested with ApaI/NspV, and the resulting 1017-bp fragment was ligated to ApaI/NspV-cleaved pBluescript containing the BamHI-cleaved fragment of pAIFNC, followed by excision of a 3316-bp BamHI fragment and insertion into BamHI-cleaved pAIFNC, yielding the expression vector pAIFNCm, which encodes rFN/Cm. Cell Culture, DNA Transfection, and Selection of Stable Transformed Cells—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) DG44 cells deficient in dihydrofolate reductase activity were obtained from Dr. Lawrence Chasin (Columbia University) and grown in α-minimal essential medium containing ribonucleosides/deoxyribonucleosides and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The expression vectors for rFN/O, rFN/C, and rFN/Cm were cotransfected into CHO DG44 cells together with pGEMSVdhfr, which encodes a dihydrofolate reductase minigene (provided by Dr. Hiroshi Teraoka, Shionogi Research Laboratory, Shionogi and Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan), by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (20.Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). Selection of stable transfectants and subsequent amplification of the introduced cDNA were carried out as described (21.Kaufman R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 537-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Stable transfectants overexpressing recombinant human FNs were maintained in α-minimal essential medium without ribonucleosides/deoxyribonucleosides in the presence of 10% FBS. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS. HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells were obtained from the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS. Antibodies and Peptides—Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against human FN (136H, 119A, and 17E) and hamster FN (YFN3 and 3C12) were established in our laboratory by fusion of SP2 myeloma cells with the spleen cells of BALB/c mice immunized with human plasma FN or hamster plasma FN, respectively. The epitopes for mAbs 136H and 119A have been mapped to the III-1 module, and that for mAb 17E to the collagen/gelatin-binding domain. mAb FN1-1, which recognizes the extreme C-terminal segment containing the dimer-forming cysteines, was purchased from Takara Bio Inc. (Otsu, Japan). Function-blocking mAbs against integrin α5 (8F1) and β1 (4G2) subunits were established in our laboratory (13.Manabe R. Ohe N. Maeda T. Fukuda T. Sekiguchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The mAb against human integrin αvβ3 (LM609) was purchased from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). A polyclonal antibody against human FN was raised in rabbits by repeated immunization with purified human plasma FN emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant. Dialyzed control mouse IgG was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Goat anti-mouse IgG and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG were from Cappel Worthington Biochemicals (Malvern, PA). The synthetic peptides GRGDSP and GRGESP were obtained from Iwaki Glass (Chiba, Japan). Purification of Recombinant FNs and Immunoblot Analysis—CHO transfectants overexpressing recombinant FNs were maintained in α-minimal essential medium containing 1% FN-depleted FBS. The conditioned medium (∼2 liters) was clarified by centrifugation, concentrated using the Labscale™ TFF system (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and passed over an immunoaffinity column containing mAb 3C12 to remove endogenous hamster FN secreted by the CHO cells. The flow-through fractions were applied to an immunoaffinity column containing mAb 119A to capture recombinant FNs. Proteins bound to the columns were eluted with 0.1 m triethylamine (pH 11.5), immediately neutralized with 2 m NaH2PO4 (pH 3.6), and then dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). For the immunoblot analysis, purified FNs were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 6% polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 3% skim milk and stained with monoclonal antibody against human FN or hamster FN using ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Indirect Immunofluorescence Staining—Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were plated on glass coverslips placed in a 24-well culture plate in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FN-depleted FBS and cultured for 24 h. The medium was then replaced with serum-free medium containing 50 nm recombinant human FNs and incubated for another 24 h. Cells were washed three times with PBS, fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, and then double-stained with mouse anti-human FN mAb 136H and rabbit anti-FN polyclonal antibody at room temperature for 1 h. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor™ 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor™ 546-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG at a dilution of 1:400 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) at room temperature for 1 h. The labeled cells were washed three times with PBS, mounted in PermaFluor Aqueous Mountant (Thermo Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA), and examined with a Zeiss LSM5 PASCAL confocal laser microscope. Cell Spreading Assay—Cell spreading assays were performed using 96-well microtiter plates (Maxisorp, Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) coated with various concentrations of recombinant FNs as specified and blocked with 1% heat-denatured bovine serum albumin. HT1080 cells detached with 1 mm EDTA at 37 °C were plated on the plates at a density of 3 × 104 cells/ml and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. For cell adhesion inhibition assays, cells were preincubated with function-blocking mAbs against different types of integrins or synthetic peptides in serum-free medium at a density of 3 × 105 cells/ml at 4 °C for 30 min before plating. Nonadherent cells were removed by washing with serum-free medium, and attached cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde and then stained with Diff-Quick (International Reagent Corp., Kobe, Japan). Cells showing a well spread morphology (i.e. cells that had become flattened with their long axis more than twice the diameter of their nucleus) were counted per square millimeter. Purification of Integrin α5β1 and Integrin-containing Liposome Binding Assay—Integrin α5β1 was purified and reconstituted into liposomes as described by Pytela et al. (22.Pytela R. Pierschbacher M.D. Argraves S. Suzuki S. Ruoslahti E. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 144: 475-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Briefly, fresh human placental tissue was extracted with Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.13 m NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2) containing 100 mm octyl glucoside and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The extract was applied to a Sepharose affinity column conjugated with 155/145-kDa thermolysin fragments containing the CCBD. The integrin α5β1 bound to the affinity column was eluted with Tris-buffered saline containing 1 mm GRGDSP peptide. The eluted integrin was mixed with egg yolk lecithin containing [3H]dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and then dialyzed overnight against Tris-buffered saline containing 2 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mm MgCl2 at 4 °C. The reconstituted integrin-containing liposomes were added to microtiter wells coated with recombinant FNs (50 nm) and incubated for 6 h at room temperature. In some experiments, recombinant FNs were immobilized on microtiter wells via mAb 119A preadsorbed on the plates. The wells were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline, and then bound liposomes were solubilized with 1% SDS, followed by quantification of the radioactivity with a Packard Tri-Carb 1500 liquid scintillation analyzer. Heparin Binding Assay—Heparin-binding activity was assessed by heparin affinity chromatography using HiTrap™ heparin (Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Purified recombinant FNs were applied to a HiTrap heparin column (1-ml volume), which had been equilibrated with 10 mm phosphate buffer containing 0.14 m NaCl, and eluted with a gradient of 0.14–1.0 m NaCl (flow rate of 0.1 ml/min). The protein concentration in each fraction was monitored by the absorbance at 280 nm. Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) Binding Assay—Phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated glycosaminoglycans (PE-GAGs) were synthesized as described previously (23.Sugiura N. Sakurai K. Hori Y. Karasawa K. Suzuki S. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15779-15787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Maxisorp 96-well microtiter plates were coated with 20 μg/ml PE-GAG at 4 °C overnight, followed by blocking with 1% denatured bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing the wells three times with PBS, recombinant FNs (20 nm) were incubated with the PE-GAG-coated wells for 2 h at room temperature. The amounts of FN bound to the PE-GAGs were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using anti-human FN mAb 136H and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. Cartilage-type FN Is Secreted as a Monomer—The structures of the recombinant human FN isoforms used in this study are illustrated in Fig. 1. These full-length FN isoforms are identical except for the alternatively spliced modules and two Cys residues within the C-terminal dimer-forming segment. A novel FN isoform lacking IIICS through the I-10 module has been shown to be expressed in normal cartilaginous tissues (17.MacLeod J.N. Burton-Wurster N. Gu D.N. Lust G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18954-18960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To elucidate the physiological functions of this cartilage-type FN, we constructed an expression vector for this isoform and cotransfected CHO DG44 cells with the vector and a selection plasmid encoding a dihydrofolate reductase minigene. The resulting stable transfectants were treated with increasing concentrations of methotrexate to amplify the introduced recombinant genes. Immunoblot analyses of the conditioned medium of the transfectants showed that rFN/O was secreted into the medium (data not shown). rFN/O was purified from the conditioned medium of stable transfectants by immunoaffinity chromatography using anti-human FN mAb 119A, which recognizes the III-1 module. Purified rFN/O gave a single band with an apparent molecular mass of ∼220 kDa under reducing conditions, which is significantly smaller than the molecular masses of the bands given by both rFN/C and FN purified from human plasma (Fig. 2A, left panel). Unexpectedly, rFN/O still migrated around the 200-kDa region under nonreducing conditions, whereas rFN/C and plasma FN gave bands in the ∼500-kDa region, indicative of their dimeric nature (Fig. 2A, right panel). These results indicate that rFN/O was secreted predominantly as a monomer. The failure of rFN/O to form a dimer does not seem to be due to the removal of the C-terminal dimer-forming segment by proteolytic cleavage because rFN/O retained the reactivity with mAb FN1-1, which recognizes the extreme C-terminal segment (Fig. 2B, right panel). The absence of CHO cell-derived hamster FN in the purified recombinant FNs was also confirmed by immunoblot analysis with hamster FN-specific mAb YFN3 (Fig. 2B, middle panel). Decreased Cell-adhesive Activity of Cartilage-type FN—The structure of cartilage-type FN raises the question of whether cartilage-type FN and other FN isoforms are functionally different. The monomeric configuration and the absence of the III-15 and I-10 modules might individually influence the biological functions of FNs. To examine the effect of the monomeric configuration, we produced a monomeric form of rFN/C by replacing two Cys residues in the dimer-forming segment with Ser (see Fig. 1). As expected, the resulting monomeric rFN/C (rFN/Cm) was secreted as a monomer (Fig. 3A). To explore the physiological functions of cartilage-type FN, we compared the cell-adhesive activity of rFN/O with those of rFN/C and rFN/Cm in cell spreading assays using HT1080 cells. When HT1080 cells were plated on substrates coated with rFN/O, the cells attached and spread on the substrates, although rFN/O was slightly less potent than rFN/C and rFN/Cm in promoting cell spreading (Fig. 3B). The concentration of FN in the coating solution required to attain the maximal level of cell spreading was ∼10 nm for rFN/C and rFN/Cm, but ∼20 nm for rFN/O. The reduced cell-spreading activity of rFN/O is unlikely to be due to its monomeric nature because rFN/Cm was as equally active as dimeric rFN/C in cell spreading assays despite its monomeric configuration. When recombinant FNs are directly immobilized on plastic plates, the native conformation in solution might be transformed into an elongated conformation through hydrophobic interaction with the polystyrene substrates (24.Wolff C. Lai C.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 268: 536-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 25.Wolff C.E. Lai C.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3354-3361Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To avoid such conformational change imposed by direct coating onto plastic substrates, FNs were indirectly immobilized via anti-FN mAb 119A, which recognizes the III-1 module, for comparison of their cell-spreading activities. The difference in cell-spreading activity between rFN/O and rFN/C was more pronounced when FNs were indirectly immobilized on the substrates (Fig. 3C). Similar results were obtained when recombinant FNs were captured with another anti-FN mAb recognizing the collagen/gelatin-binding domain (data not shown). Cartilage-type FN Binds to Integrin α5β1 via the RGD Motif—The RGD motif in the CCBD is retained in cartilage-type FN (Fig. 1), making it likely that integrin α5β1 is the major receptor mediating cell adhesion to cartilage-type FN, as is the case with other FN isoforms. Indeed, adhesion of HT1080 cells to rFN/O was strongly inhibited by preincubation of the cells with function-blocking mAbs against the integrin α5 and β1 subunits, but not with those against integrin αvβ3 (Fig. 4A). Consistent with the role of integrin α5β1 as the major receptor for rFN/O, adhesion of HT1080 cells to rFN/O was almost completely inhibited with 1 mm GRGDSP peptide, but not with 1 mm GRGESP peptide or 50 nm GRGDSP peptide (Fig. 4B). Decreased Affinity of Integrin α5β1 for Cartilage-type FN— Our data show that cartilage-type FN is less active in promoting cell spreading than plasma-type FN. Given that integrin α5β1 is the major adhesive receptor for cartilage-type FN, we hypothesized that the decreased cell-spreading activity of rFN/O was due to its decreased affinity for integrin α5β1. To explore this possibility, integrin α5β1 was purified from human placenta and reconstituted into [3H]phosphatidylcholine-containing liposomes to determine its binding activity for various recombinant FNs by solid-phase integrin-containing liposome binding assays. We found that integrin α5β1-containing liposomes bound less avidly to rFN/O than to rFN/Cm or rFN/C (Fig. 5). The difference in the integrin α5β1-containing liposome-binding activity between cartilage-type and plasma-type FNs became more pronounced when FNs were captured on the substrates via an anti-FN mAb instead of being directly coated onto the substrates (Fig. 3, B and C), consistent with the difference observed in the cell spreading assays. The binding of integrin α5β1-containing liposomes to recombinant FNs was completely blocked by the anti-integrin α5 mAb (data not shown), indicating that the reduced cell-spreading activity of cartilage-type FN was due primarily to the decreased binding affinity for integrin α5β1. Cartilage-type FN Binds Strongly to Chondroitin Sulfate E— Not only integrin α5β1, but also heparan sulfate proteoglycans or other proteoglycans on cell surfaces have been shown to mediate interactions of cells with the FN matrix (26.Woods A. Couchman J.R. Johansson S. Hook M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 665-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 27.Bidanset D.J. LeBaron R. Rosenberg L. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Hook M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1523-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus, the reduced cell-spreading activity of cartilage-type FN may result from its decreased affinity for heparan sulfate proteoglycans. To explore the possible involvement of surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans in the reduced cell-spreading activity of cartilage-type FN, the affinity of recombinant FNs for heparin was assessed by heparin affinity chromatography using elution with a linear gradient of NaCl. The NaCl concentration needed to elute bound recombinant FNs was taken as an index to estimate their affinity for heparin. There were no significant differences in the elution profiles among rFN/O, rFN/Cm, and rFN/C, indicating that cartilage-type FN bound to heparin with an affinity comparable with that of plasma-type FN (Fig. 6). The binding activities of recombinant FNs for other GAG chains were also determined by solid-phase binding assays using a panel of PE-GAGs (23.Sugiura N. Sakurai K. Hori Y. Karasawa K. Suzuki S. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15779-15787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipid moieties were attached to facilitate adsorption of GAGs onto hydrophobic plastic surfaces. No significant difference was observed between plasma-type and cartilage-type FNs in the binding to phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated heparin (Fig. 7), confirming the results obtained by heparin affinity chromatography. In contrast, none of the recombinant FNs examined showed significant binding to chondroitin sulfate (CS) A, CS-C, CS-D, dermatan sulfate, or hyaluronic acid, consistent with previous reports (28.Sekiguchi K. Hakomori S. Funahashi M. Matsumoto I. Seno N. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14359-14365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Barkalow F.J. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3957-3962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, rFN/O exhibited significant binding to CS-E, containing 4,6-disulfated N-acetylgalactosamine residues, although dimeric rFN/C was only moderately active in binding to CS-E, and rFN/Cm was barely active. Differential GAG binding between rFN/O and rFN/Cm, both in the monomeric configuration, was also observed for binding to heparan sulfate; rFN/O, but not rFN/Cm, was capable of binding to heparan sulfate. rFN/C was also active in binding to heparan sulfate, possibly because of its divalent structure. Matrix Assembly of Cartilage-type FN—Dimerization through disulfide bonds near the C terminus has been shown to be essential for FN matrix assembly (2.Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1463-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Because of the monomeric nature of rFN/O, we assumed that cartilage-type FN could not assemble into the FN matrix. To explore this possibility, rFN/O, rFN/Cm, and rFN/C were incubated with mouse embryonic fibroblasts for 24 h to see whether they could coassemble with endogenous mouse FN into the FN matrix. Despite the extensive matrix assembly of mouse FN, rFN/O was only marginally incorporated into the FN matrix, whereas rFN/C was fully capable of assembling into the FN matrix (Fig. 8). rFN/Cm exhibited very weak matrix-assembling activity due to its monomeric configuration, but it was reproducibly more active than rFN/O, suggesting that the nearly complete loss of matrix-assembling activity in cartilage-type FN was not due simply to its monomeric configuration, but rather the combined effects of the monomeric configuration and reduction of either the integrin α5β1-binding or ill-defined self-binding activity. The first feature of cartilage-type FN is that it is secreted as a monomer. All other FN isoforms identified so far, except for some recombinant FNs lacking the IIICS region (30.Guan J.L. Trevithick J.E. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 833-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) or the fibrin-2 domain (31.Sottile J. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1641-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), are secreted as dimers. Our results are apparently contradictory to previous reports that rat deminectin lacking the V+C region is expressed predominantly as a homodimer (32.Chen H. Gu D.N. Burton-Wurster N. MacLeod J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20095-20103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 33.Burton-Wurster N. Gendelman R. Chen H. Gu D.N. Tetreault J.W. Lust G. Schwarzbauer J.E. MacLeod J.N. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This apparent discrepancy could be due to the N-terminal truncation in deminectins, which would likely induce a global conformational change in the FN subunits, thereby modifying their dimerizing potential. Although we have not yet examined the monomer/dimer ratio of FNs in human cartilage, Burton-Wurster et al. (33.Burton-Wurster N. Gendelman R. Chen H. Gu D.N. Tetreault J.W. Lust G. Schwarzbauer J.E. MacLeod J.N. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) reported that >80% of cartilage-type FN extracted from canine cartilage exists as a monomer, making it likely that the monomeric configuration of our rFN/O is not an artifact, but rather a reflection of a general feature of cartilage-type FNs in different species. The second feature of cartilage-type FN is its reduced integrin-binding activity. Many lines of evidence indicate that integrin α5β1 binds to the CCBD consisting of the III-8 through III-10 modules (13.Manabe R. Ohe N. Maeda T. Fukuda T. Sekiguchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 34.Aota S. Nagai T. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15938-15943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the CCBD remains intact after cartilage-specific alternative RNA splicing, the reduced integrin binding of cartilage-type FN could be due to either global or local conformational changes in the FN molecule, resulting in reduced accessibility and/or binding affinity of integrin α5β1 for the CCBD. The dependence on the global conformation of the integrin-binding activity of cartilage-type FN was implicated by the differences in the integrin α5β1-binding activities of rFN/O either directly adsorbed onto the substrates or indirectly immobilized via substrate-adsorbed antibodies. Direct adsorption of FNs onto hydrophobic polystyrene surfaces has been shown to induce a global conformational change in the molecules, converting their compact shape into a more extended conformation (24.Wolff C. Lai C.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 268: 536-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 25.Wolff C.E. Lai C.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3354-3361Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). rFN/O directly adsorbed onto the substrates was more active in binding to integrin α5β1 than rFN/O indirectly immobilized via antibodies, lending support to the possibility that the reduced integrin binding of rFN/O results from a global conformational change in the FN molecule imposed by the removal of the V+C region. Consistent with this possibility, the reactivities of a panel of mAbs against human FN were found to be different between cartilage-type and plasma-type FNs (Supplemental Fig. 1 (41.Katayama M. Hino F. Odate Y. Goto S. Kimizuka F. Kato I. Titani K. Sekiguchi K. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 185: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar)). mAbs recognizing the CCBD bound less to cartilage-type than to plasma-type FN, although the mAbs recognizing III-1 and III-13 modules bound equally to cartilage-type and plasma-type FNs, demonstrating that the accessibility of the CCBD for mAbs was reduced upon removal of the V+C region. The third feature of cartilage-type FN is enhanced binding to CS-E. Several lines of evidence have indicated that FNs bind to CS through the C-terminal heparin-binding domain consisting of the III-12 through III-14 modules (29.Barkalow F.J. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3957-3962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Iida J. Skubitz A.P. Furcht L.T. Wayner E.A. McCarthy J.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 431-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Because the C-terminal heparin-binding domain remains intact in cartilage-type FN, it seems likely that the enhanced CS-E binding of cartilage-type FN is due to the conformational perturbation resulting from the removal of the V+C region, as also speculated for the reduced binding of cartilage-type FN to integrin α5β1. Relevant to this possibility is the previous observation that deminectin exhibits higher binding affinity for CS compared with intact FN (29.Barkalow F.J. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3957-3962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enhanced CS binding of deminectin has been ascribed to the regulatory role of the N-terminal region, which may modulate the CS-binding activity of the C-terminal heparin-binding domain through either direct domain-domain interaction or modulation of the global conformation, thereby leading to the unmasking of cryptic CS-binding sites other than the C-terminal heparin-binding domain. The enhanced binding of cartilage-type FN to CS-E raises the possibility that cartilage-type FN forms a complex with aggrecan, the major CS-containing proteoglycan in cartilage, because more than half of the terminal N-acetylgalactosamine residues of aggrecan have been shown to be 4,6-disulfated, hence existing as CS-E (36.Plaas A.H. Wong-Palms S. Roughley P.J. Midura R.J. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20603-20610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Recently, Gendelman et al. (37.Gendelman R. Burton-Wurster N.I. MacLeod J.N. Lust G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11175-11181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) reported that cartilage-type FN has a higher affinity for decorin compared with plasma-type FN at a low salt concentration (i.e. 30 mm NaCl). The binding was considered to be mediated by the CS chains because FN binding to decorin was abolished by chondroitinase ABC treatment. It remains unclear, however, whether binding of cartilage-type FN to the CS chains of decorin persists even under physiological ionic conditions. The fourth feature of cartilage-type FN is its poor ability to assemble into the fibrillar FN matrix, which is attributable to its monomeric configuration. It has been well documented that monomeric forms of recombinant FNs possess very poor matrix-assembling activity, mostly due to their lack of self-polymerizing activity (2.Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1463-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 19.Ichihara-Tanaka K. Titani K. Sekiguchi K. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 907-915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that rFN/O was less active than rFN/Cm in assembling into the FN matrix of fibroblasts, even though both recombinant FNs existed as monomers. The difference in their matrix-assembling activity could be due to the absence of the I-10 module in rFN/O because deletion of the I-10 module from “mini-FN,” which consists of the N-terminal 70-kDa region and the C-terminal 37-kDa region, the latter of which encompasses the III-15 module through the C terminus, results in a small, yet reproducible reduction of its FN matrix-assembling activity (19.Ichihara-Tanaka K. Titani K. Sekiguchi K. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 907-915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The involvement of the fibrin-2 domain, which consists of the I-10 through I-12 modules, in FN matrix assembly was previously documented by Sottile and Mosher (31.Sottile J. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1641-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), consistent with the potential role of the I-10 module in FN matrix assembly. The reduced integrin α5β1 binding of rFN/O may also contribute to the difference in the matrix-assembling activity because the binding of FN to the cell-surface integrin receptors, particularly α5β1, has been considered to be the initial event in a cascade of FN matrix assembly processes (38.Mosher D.F. Sottile J. Wu C. McDonald J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 810-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 39.Schwarzbauer J.E. Sechler J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 622-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 40.Pankov R. Cukierman E. Katz B.Z. Matsumoto K. Lin D.C. Lin S. Hahn C. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1075-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Recently, Chen et al. (32.Chen H. Gu D.N. Burton-Wurster N. MacLeod J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20095-20103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) reported that rat rFN/O can assemble into a fibrillar matrix as efficiently as plasma-type and cellular-type FNs. The authors did not refer to whether the rFN/O was secreted as a dimer or monomer, making it difficult to reconcile the poor FN matrix-assembling activity of our cartilage-type FN with the apparently normal matrix assembly of their rFN/O. This discrepancy could be due to a species difference in the matrix-assembling activity between rat and human cartilage-type FNs or reflect a difference in the cells used for the assays of the FN matrix-assembling activity. Chen et al. used mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in FN expression; therefore, exogenous FNs did not compete with endogenously secreted FNs for the cell-surface FN receptors, whereas we used wild-type embryonic fibroblasts, which secrete a large amount of endogenous cell-type FNs, which did compete with exogenous FNs, thereby blocking the assembly of exogenously added cartilage-type FN. The cartilage matrix is characterized by its amorphous, nonfibrillar structure composed of collagen II and CS-containing proteoglycans, e.g. aggrecan. Given the monomeric configuration of cartilage-type FN and its poor FN matrix-assembling activity, it is conceivable that cartilage-type FN assembles into the cartilage matrix through binding to other constituents, particularly aggrecan. Enhanced binding of cartilage-type FN to CS-E supports this possibility. Combined with the reduced integrin α5β1-binding activity, the monomeric configuration of cartilage-type FN may thus contribute to the mechanical and functional properties of the cartilage matrix characterized by its resilience and cytostatic environment for the resident cells. Further studies on the physiological roles of cartilage-type FN and the structural basis of its monomeric configuration and unique biological activities should shed light on the molecular basis of the structure and functions of the cartilage matrix.
