https://openalex.org/W2070398649,"Although El Niño and La Niña are the largest single sources of global interannual climate variability, climate shifts on longer time scales than El Niño's 2 to 7 years are also drawing the attention of researchers. On multidecadal time scales of 40 to 80 years, a restless North Atlantic seems to be at work, alternately countering and enhancing humankind's alterations of climate. The evidence for this is turning up in such records as tree rings, ice cores, and corals."
https://openalex.org/W2029285374,"Starch, a major storage metabolite in plants, positively affects the agricultural yield of a number of crops. Its biosynthetic reactions use adenosine diphosphate glucose (ADPGlc) as a substrate; ADPGlc pyrophosphorylase, the enzyme involved in ADPGlc formation, is regulated by allosteric effectors. Evidence that this plastidial enzyme catalyzes a rate-limiting reaction in starch biosynthesis was derived by expression in plants of a gene that encodes a regulatory variant of this enzyme. Allosteric regulation was demonstrated to be the major physiological mechanism that controls starch biosynthesis. Thus, plant and bacterial systems for starch and glycogen biosynthesis are similar and distinct from yeast and mammalian systems, wherein glycogen synthase has been demonstrated to be the rate-limiting regulatory step."
https://openalex.org/W2011564699,"Oxygen-18 (δ18O) variations in a 36-centimeter-long core (DH-11) of vein calcite from Devils Hole, Nevada, yield an uninterrupted 500,000-year paleotemperature record that closely mimics all major features in the Vostok (Antarctica) paleotemperature and marine δ18O ice-volume records. The chronology for this continental record is based on 21 replicated mass-spectrometric uranium-series dates. Between the middle and latest Pleistocene, the duration of the last four glacial cycles recorded in the calcite increased from 80,000 to 130,000 years; this variation suggests that major climate changes were aperiodic. The timing of specific climatic events indicates that orbitally controlled variations in solar insolation were not a major factor in triggering deglaciations. Interglacial climates lasted about 20,000 years. Collectively, these observations are inconsistent with the Milankovitch hypothesis for the origin of the Pleistocene glacial cycles but they are consistent with the thesis that these cycles originated from internal nonlinear feedbacks within the atmosphere-ice sheet-ocean system."
https://openalex.org/W2033566601,"The Devils Hole calcite vein contains a long-term climatic record, but requires accurate chronologic control for its interpretation. Mass-spectrometric U-series ages for samples from core DH-11 yielded (230)Th ages with precisions ranging from less than 1,000 years (2sigma) for samples younger than approximately 140 ka (thousands of years ago) to less than 50,000 years for the oldest samples ( approximately 566 ka). The (234)U/(238)U ages could be determined to a precision of approximately 20,000 years for all ages. Calcite accumulated continuously from 566 ka until approximately 60 ka at an average rate of 0.7 millimeter per 10(3) years. The precise agreement between replicte analyses and the concordance of the (230)Th/(238)U (234)U/(238)U ages for the oldest samples indicate that the DH-11 samples were closed systems and validate the dating technique in general."

Feldspar and quartz fragments were placed in anoxic, organic-rich ground water, left for 14 months, recovered, and compared to unreacted controls with scanning electron microscopy. Ground-water geochemistry was characterized before and after the experiment. Localized mineral etching probably occurred in a reaction zone at the bacteria-mineral interface where high concentrations of organic acids, formed by bacteria during metabolism of hydrocarbon, selectively mobilized silica and aluminum from the mineral surface."

https://openalex.org/W2020280777,"Freeze-fracture transmission electron micrographs of the smectic A(*) phase confirm the twist grain boundary model of Renn and Lubensky. The fracture surface has an undulating structure with a 0.5-micrometer helical pitch parallel to 4.1-nanometer smectic layers. The layers are disrupted by a lattice of screw dislocations oriented normal to the helical axis. Optical diffraction shows that rotation of smectic blocks occurs in discrete steps of about 17 degrees ; hence, the screw dislocations are 14 to 15 nanometers apart and the grain boundaries are 24 nanometers apart. These observations show that the SmA(*) phase is the liquid-crystal analog of the Abrikosov phase in superconductors."

https://openalex.org/W2058472012,"Multiple-junction structures were formed, on a microscopic scale, at room temperature, by the application of a strong electric field across originally homogeneous crystals of the ternary chalcopyrite semiconductor CuInSe2. After removal of the electric field, the structures were examined with electron beam-induced current microscopy and their current-voltage characteristics were measured. Bipolar transistor action was observed, indicating that sharp bulk junctions can form in this way at low ambient temperatures. The devices are stable under normal (low-voltage) operating conditions. Possible causes for this effect, including electromigration and electric field-assisted defect reactions, are suggested."

https://openalex.org/W1970555284,"Most materials become narrower in cross section when stretched, but some materials, such as foams, have the counterintuitive property of becoming fatter when stretched (they have a negative Poisson's ratio). In this Perspective, Lakes discusses how his unusual property may arise in isotropic and anisotropic materials. He highlights the study by Baughman et al., who show that anisotropic materials with a negative Poisson's ratio in one direction can be incompressible, i.e., without an overall change in volume upon stretching. This behavior is predicted for materials with very high density, such as neutron star crusts, or very low density, such as ion plasmas, and the validity of the prediction is demonstrated with experimental data for ion plasmas."
https://openalex.org/W2078322690,"The slip rate of a fault segment is related to the length of the fault zone of which it is part. In turn, the slip rate of a fault zone is related to its connectivity with adjoining or contiguous fault zones. The observed variation in slip rate on fault segments in the San Francisco Bay area in California is consistent with connectivity between the Hayward, Calaveras, and San Andreas fault zones. Slip rates on the southern Hayward fault taper northward from a maximum of more than 10 millimeters per year and are sensitive to the active length of the Maacama fault."

In this Perspective, Bender highlights a study by Luz and Barkan, who exploit the anomalous isotopic composition of molecular oxygen to determine the gross rate of photosynthesis in seawater. The method allows much longer time scales and larger spatial scales to be covered than with traditional oceanographic techniques."

https://openalex.org/W2054831864,"In terms of sheer mass, there's no contest. In one corner, there's a land-based record of ice age climates that takes the form of a single carbonate cylinder about the size of the cardboard tube in a roll of paper towels. In the other corner, there's the marine record, which draws on the tons of deep-sea mud cored around the world during the past 20 years. But a group of researchers argues that the lone continental record, drilled from a wall of calcite in Devil's Hole, Nevada, is enough to unseat the conventional wisdom about the causes of the ice ages. The reason a single stick of carbonate has received all this attention is the unique resource it contains: a precisely dated continental climate record of the past 600,000 years. The record was deposited from ground water, which carried a measure of air temperature in the form of the water's oxygen isotope composition. As the water seeped into Devil's Hole - an open, water-filled fault zone - carbonate crystallized out, locking up some of the water's oxygen and building up a climate record layer by layer. Drilling into the walls of the fault, a core was retrieved spanning layers formedmore » between 60,000 and 560,000 years ago, as measured by high-precision uranium thorium dating.« less"

https://openalex.org/W1986463104,"Researchers have long doubted that solar cycles affect terrestrial climate, because no one has yet come up with a convincing mechanism to explain how tiny changes on the sun might change climate on Earth. Now, however, two such correlations--a 22-year climate cycle recorded in glacial sediments and the tracing of an 11-year cycle from the stratosphere into the lower atmosphere--may be robust enough to give the sun-climate link a touch more respectability."
