https://openalex.org/W2009720434,"Major international projects are underway that are aimed at creating a comprehensive catalogue of all the genes responsible for the initiation and progression of cancer. These studies involve the sequencing of matched tumour-normal samples followed by mathematical analysis to identify those genes in which mutations occur more frequently than expected by random chance. Here we describe a fundamental problem with cancer genome studies: as the sample size increases, the list of putatively significant genes produced by current analytical methods burgeons into the hundreds. The list includes many implausible genes (such as those encoding olfactory receptors and the muscle protein titin), suggesting extensive false-positive findings that overshadow true driver events. We show that this problem stems largely from mutational heterogeneity and provide a novel analytical methodology, MutSigCV, for resolving the problem. We apply MutSigCV to exome sequences from 3,083 tumour-normal pairs and discover extraordinary variation in mutation frequency and spectrum within cancer types, which sheds light on mutational processes and disease aetiology, and in mutation frequency across the genome, which is strongly correlated with DNA replication timing and also with transcriptional activity. By incorporating mutational heterogeneity into the analyses, MutSigCV is able to eliminate most of the apparent artefactual findings and enable the identification of genes truly associated with cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2140930678,"Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is crucial for tumour suppression. Senescent cells implement a complex pro-inflammatory response termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The SASP reinforces senescence, activates immune surveillance and paradoxically also has pro-tumorigenic properties. Here, we present evidence that the SASP can also induce paracrine senescence in normal cells both in culture and in human and mouse models of OIS in vivo. Coupling quantitative proteomics with small-molecule screens, we identified multiple SASP components mediating paracrine senescence, including TGF-β family ligands, VEGF, CCL2 and CCL20. Amongst them, TGF-β ligands play a major role by regulating p15(INK4b) and p21(CIP1). Expression of the SASP is controlled by inflammasome-mediated IL-1 signalling. The inflammasome and IL-1 signalling are activated in senescent cells and IL-1α expression can reproduce SASP activation, resulting in senescence. Our results demonstrate that the SASP can cause paracrine senescence and impact on tumour suppression and senescence in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2122522583,"Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe neurological disorder that is caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene. Many missense mutations causing RTT are clustered in the DNA-binding domain of MeCP2, suggesting that association with chromatin is critical for its function. We identified a second mutational cluster in a previously uncharacterized region of MeCP2. We found that RTT mutations in this region abolished the interaction between MeCP2 and the NCoR/SMRT co-repressor complexes. Mice bearing a common missense RTT mutation in this domain exhibited severe RTT-like phenotypes. Our data are compatible with the hypothesis that brain dysfunction in RTT is caused by a loss of the MeCP2 'bridge' between the NCoR/SMRT co-repressors and chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W2001036497,"DNA hydroxylation catalyzed by Tet dioxygenases occurs abundantly in embryonic stem cells and neurons in mammals. However, its biological function in vivo is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Tet1 plays an important role in regulating neural progenitor cell proliferation in adult mouse brain. Mice lacking Tet1 exhibit impaired hippocampal neurogenesis accompanied by poor learning and memory. In adult neural progenitor cells deficient in Tet1, a cohort of genes involved in progenitor proliferation were hypermethylated and downregulated. Our results indicate that Tet1 is positively involved in the epigenetic regulation of neural progenitor cell proliferation in the adult brain."
https://openalex.org/W2004684279,"Major depression is a highly prevalent severe mood disorder that is treated with antidepressants. The molecular targets of antidepressants require definition. We investigated the role of the acid sphingomyelinase (Asm)-ceramide system as a target for antidepressants. Therapeutic concentrations of the antidepressants amitriptyline and fluoxetine reduced Asm activity and ceramide concentrations in the hippocampus, increased neuronal proliferation, maturation and survival and improved behavior in mouse models of stress-induced depression. Genetic Asm deficiency abrogated these effects. Mice overexpressing Asm, heterozygous for acid ceramidase, treated with blockers of ceramide metabolism or directly injected with C16 ceramide in the hippocampus had higher ceramide concentrations and lower rates of neuronal proliferation, maturation and survival compared with controls and showed depression-like behavior even in the absence of stress. The decrease of ceramide abundance achieved by antidepressant-mediated inhibition of Asm normalized these effects. Lowering ceramide abundance may thus be a central goal for the future development of antidepressants."
https://openalex.org/W2036335143,"Below a certain level, table salt (NaCl) is beneficial for animals, whereas excessive salt is harmful. However, it remains unclear how low- and high-salt taste perceptions are differentially encoded. We identified a salt-taste coding mechanism in Drosophila melanogaster. Flies use distinct types of gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) to respond to different concentrations of salt. We demonstrated that a member of the newly discovered ionotropic glutamate receptor (IR) family, IR76b, functioned in the detection of low salt and was a Na(+) channel. The loss of IR76b selectively impaired the attractive pathway, leaving salt-aversive GRNs unaffected. Consequently, low salt became aversive. Our work demonstrated that the opposing behavioral responses to low and high salt were determined largely by an elegant bimodal switch system operating in GRNs."
https://openalex.org/W2168391253,"Collective cell migration in morphogenesis and cancer progression often involves the coordination of multiple cell types. How reciprocal interactions between adjacent cell populations lead to new emergent behaviours remains unknown. Here we studied the interaction between neural crest (NC) cells, a highly migratory cell population, and placodal cells, an epithelial tissue that contributes to sensory organs. We found that NC cells chase placodal cells by chemotaxis, and placodal cells run when contacted by NC. Chemotaxis to Sdf1 underlies the chase, and repulsion involving PCP and N-cadherin signalling is responsible for the run. This chase-and-run requires the generation of asymmetric forces, which depend on local inhibition of focal adhesions. The cell interactions described here are essential for correct NC migration and for segregation of placodes in vivo and are likely to represent a general mechanism of coordinated migration. Mayor and colleagues observed that placodal cell movements in Xenopus and zebrafish embryos are controlled by their interaction with adjacent neural crest cells. Neural crest cells chemotactically migrated towards placodal cells and, on contact, induced neural crest cells to migrate away, revealing a ‘chase-and-run’ behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W2010860074,"The capacity for goal-directed action depends on encoding specific action-outcome associations, a learning process mediated by the posterior dorsomedial striatum (pDMS). In a changing environment, plasticity has to remain flexible, requiring interference between new and existing learning to be minimized, yet it is not known how new and existing learning are interlaced in this way. Here we investigated the role of the thalamostriatal pathway linking the parafascicular thalamus (Pf) with cholinergic interneurons (CINs) in the pDMS in this process. Removing the excitatory input from Pf to the CINs was found to reduce the firing rate and intrinsic activity of these neurons and produced an enduring deficit in goal-directed learning after changes in the action-outcome contingency. Disconnection of the Pf-pDMS pathway produced similar behavioral effects. These data suggest that CINs reduce interference between new and existing learning, consistent with claims that the thalamostriatal pathway exerts state control over learning-related plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W1979539207,"The fluorescent protein toolbox has revolutionized experimental biology. Despite this advance, no fluorescent proteins have been identified from vertebrates, nor has chromogenic ligand-inducible activation or clinical utility been demonstrated. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of UnaG, a fluorescent protein from Japanese eel. UnaG belongs to the fatty-acid-binding protein (FABP) family, and expression in eel is restricted to small-diameter muscle fibers. On heterologous expression in cell lines or mouse brain, UnaG produces oxygen-independent green fluorescence. Remarkably, UnaG fluorescence is triggered by an endogenous ligand, bilirubin, a membrane-permeable heme metabolite and clinical health biomarker. The holoUnaG structure at 1.2 Å revealed a biplanar coordination of bilirubin by reversible π-conjugation, and we used this high-affinity and high-specificity interaction to establish a fluorescence-based human bilirubin assay with promising clinical utility. UnaG will be the prototype for a versatile class of ligand-activated fluorescent proteins, with applications in research, medicine, and bioengineering."
https://openalex.org/W2081756408,"Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked human neurodevelopmental disorder with features of autism and severe neurological dysfunction in females. RTT is caused by mutations in methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2), a nuclear protein that, in neurons, regulates transcription, is expressed at high levels similar to that of histones, and binds to methylated cytosines broadly across the genome. By phosphotryptic mapping, we identify three sites (S86, S274 and T308) of activity-dependent MeCP2 phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of these sites is differentially induced by neuronal activity, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or agents that elevate the intracellular level of 3',5'-cyclic AMP (cAMP), indicating that MeCP2 may function as an epigenetic regulator of gene expression that integrates diverse signals from the environment. Here we show that the phosphorylation of T308 blocks the interaction of the repressor domain of MeCP2 with the nuclear receptor co-repressor (NCoR) complex and suppresses the ability of MeCP2 to repress transcription. In knock-in mice bearing the common human RTT missense mutation R306C, neuronal activity fails to induce MeCP2 T308 phosphorylation, suggesting that the loss of T308 phosphorylation might contribute to RTT. Consistent with this possibility, the mutation of MeCP2 T308A in mice leads to a decrease in the induction of a subset of activity-regulated genes and to RTT-like symptoms. These findings indicate that the activity-dependent phosphorylation of MeCP2 at T308 regulates the interaction of MeCP2 with the NCoR complex, and that RTT in humans may be due, in part, to the loss of activity-dependent MeCP2 T308 phosphorylation and a disruption of the phosphorylation-regulated interaction of MeCP2 with the NCoR complex."
https://openalex.org/W1994899810,"Definitive hematopoiesis emerges during embryogenesis via an endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition. We attempted to induce this process in mouse fibroblasts by screening a panel of factors for hemogenic activity. We identified a combination of four transcription factors, Gata2, Gfi1b, cFos, and Etv6, that efficiently induces endothelial-like precursor cells, with the subsequent appearance of hematopoietic cells. The precursor cells express a human CD34 reporter, Sca1, and Prominin1 within a global endothelial transcription program. Emergent hematopoietic cells possess nascent hematopoietic stem cell gene-expression profiles and cell-surface phenotypes. After transgene silencing and reaggregation culture, the specified cells generate hematopoietic colonies in vitro. Thus, we show that a simple combination of transcription factors is sufficient to induce a complex, dynamic, and multistep developmental program in vitro. These findings provide insights into the specification of definitive hemogenesis and a platform for future development of patient-specific stem and progenitor cells, as well as more-differentiated blood products."
https://openalex.org/W2011785195,"Recent studies by our group and others show that microRNAs can be actively secreted into the extracellular environment through microvesicles (MVs) and function as secretory signaling molecules that influence the recipient cell phenotypes. Here we investigate the role of monocyte-secreted miR-150 in promoting the capillary tube formation of endothelial cells and in enhancing angiogenesis. In vitro capillary tube formation and in vivo angiogenesis assays showed that monocyte-derived MVs have strong pro-angiogenic activities. By depleting miR-150 from monocytic MVs and increasing miR-150 in MVs derived from cells that normally contain low levels of miR-150, we further demonstrated that the miR-150 content accounted for the pro-angiogenic activity of monocytic MVs in these assays. Using tumor-implanted mice and ob/ob mice as models, we revealed that miR-150 secretion, which is increased for diseases such as cancers and diabetes, significantly promotes angiogenesis. The delivery of anti-miR-150 antisense oligonucleotides into tumor-implanted mice and ob/ob mice via MVs, however, strongly reduced angiogenesis in both types of mice. Our results collectively demonstrate that secretion of miR-150 via MVs can promote angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo, and we also present a novel microRNA-based therapeutic approach for disease treatment."

https://openalex.org/W2069329627,"Chondrosarcoma is a heterogeneous collection of malignant bone tumors and is the second most common primary malignancy of bone after osteosarcoma. Recent work has identified frequent, recurrent mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 in nearly half of central chondrosarcomas. However, there has been little systematic genomic analysis of this tumor type, and, thus, the contribution of other genes is unclear. Here we report comprehensive genomic analyses of 49 individuals with chondrosarcoma (cases). We identified hypermutability of the major cartilage collagen gene COL2A1, with insertions, deletions and rearrangements identified in 37% of cases. The patterns of mutation were consistent with selection for variants likely to impair normal collagen biosynthesis. In addition, we identified mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 (59%), TP53 (20%), the RB1 pathway (33%) and Hedgehog signaling (18%)."

They must be selective for water, without binding it so tightly as to impede transport, and they must prevent proton transfer by rapid exchange between hydrogen-bonded water molecules. Kosinska Eriksson et al.

https://openalex.org/W2049684926,"Despite their apparent diversity, many problems in the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data are merely special cases of two general problems, signal detection and signal estimation. Here we adapt formally optimal solutions from signal processing theory to analyze signals of DNA sequence reads mapped to a genome. We describe DFilter, a detection algorithm that identifies regulatory features in ChIP-seq, DNase-seq and FAIRE-seq data more accurately than assay-specific algorithms. We also describe EFilter, an estimation algorithm that accurately predicts mRNA levels from as few as 1-2 histone profiles (R ∼0.9). Notably, the presence of regulatory motifs in promoters correlates more with histone modifications than with mRNA levels, suggesting that histone profiles are more predictive of cis-regulatory mechanisms. We show by applying DFilter and EFilter to embryonic forebrain ChIP-seq data that regulatory protein identification and functional annotation are feasible despite tissue heterogeneity. The mathematical formalism underlying our tools facilitates integrative analysis of data from virtually any sequencing-based functional profile."
https://openalex.org/W2089616767,"Short-term synaptic plasticity, the dynamic alteration of synaptic strength during high-frequency activity, is a fundamental characteristic of all synapses. At the calyx of Held, repetitive activity eventually results in short-term synaptic depression, which is in part due to the gradual exhaustion of releasable synaptic vesicles. This is counterbalanced by Ca(2+)-dependent vesicle replenishment, but the molecular mechanisms of this replenishment are largely unknown. We studied calyces of Held in knockin mice that express a Ca(2+)-Calmodulin insensitive Munc13-1(W464R) variant of the synaptic vesicle priming protein Munc13-1. Calyces of these mice exhibit a slower rate of synaptic vesicle replenishment, aberrant short-term depression and reduced recovery from synaptic depression after high-frequency stimulation. Our data establish Munc13-1 as a major presynaptic target of Ca(2+)-Calmodulin signaling and show that the Ca(2+)-Calmodulin-Munc13-1 complex is a pivotal component of the molecular machinery that determines short-term synaptic plasticity characteristics."

https://openalex.org/W2022478161,"Hormone-sensitive prostate cancer typically progresses to castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) after the androgen deprivation therapy. We investigated the impact of microRNAs (miRs) in the transition of prostate cancer to CRPC. MiR-221/-222 was highly expressed in bone metastatic CRPC tumor specimens. We previously demonstrated that transient overexpression of miR-221/-222 in LNCaP promoted the development of the CRPC phenotype. In current study, we show that stably overexpressing miR-221 confers androgen independent (AI) cell growth in LNCaP by rescuing LNCaP cells from growth arrest at G1 phase due to the lack of androgen. Overexpressing of miR-221 in LNCaP reduced the transcription of a subgroup of androgen-responsive genes without affecting the androgen receptor (AR) or AR-androgen integrity. By performing systematic biochemical and bioinformatical analyses, we identified two miR-221 targets, HECTD2 and RAB1A, which could mediate the development of CRPC phenotype in multiple prostate cancer cell lines. Downregulation of HECTD2 significantly affected the androgen-induced and AR-mediated transcription, and downregulation of HECTD2 or RAB1A enhances AI cell growth. As a result of the elevated expression of miR-221, expression of many cell cycle genes was altered and pathways promoting epithelial to mesenchymal transition/tumor metastasis were activated. We hypothesize that a major biological consequence of upregulation of miR-221 is reprogramming of AR signaling, which in turn may mediate the transition to the CRPC phenotype."

https://openalex.org/W2138397902,"We report a new class of thiophene (TP) compounds that kill Mycobacterium tuberculosis by the previously uncharacterized mechanism of Pks13 inhibition. An F79S mutation near the catalytic Ser55 site in Pks13 conferred TP resistance in M. tuberculosis. Overexpression of wild-type Pks13 resulted in TP resistance, and overexpression of the Pks13(F79S) mutant conferred high resistance. In vitro, TP inhibited fatty acyl-AMP loading onto Pks13. TP inhibited mycolic acid biosynthesis in wild-type M. tuberculosis, but it did so to a much lesser extent in TP-resistant M. tuberculosis. TP treatment was bactericidal and equivalent to treatment with the first-line drug isoniazid, but it was less likely to permit emergent resistance. Combined isoniazid and TP treatment resulted in sterilizing activity. Computational docking identified a possible TP-binding groove within the Pks13 acyl carrier protein domain. This study confirms that M. tuberculosis Pks13 is required for mycolic acid biosynthesis, validates it as a druggable target and demonstrates the therapeutic potential of simultaneously inhibiting multiple targets in the same biosynthetic pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2015070282,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most deadly cancers. Aberrant oncogenic activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway contributes to hepatocellular carcinogenesis. Various epigenetic modifications of the Wnt antagonist secreted frizzled-related protein (SFRP) family have been implicated in regulating Wnt signaling. Here, we report that Hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein downregulates SFRP1 expression when it is expressed in Huh7 and HepG2 cells. SFRP1 expression can be effectively restored by using either a DNA methylation inhibitor alone or in combination with a histone deacetylase inhibitor. DNA methylation analysis of the SFRP1 promoter revealed that cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) islands close to the transcriptional start site (TSS) in the SFRP1 promoter were hypermethylated in core-expressing Huh7 cells, suggesting that HCV core protein may downregulate SFRP1 expression by inducing hypermethylation of the SFRP1 promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that HCV core protein markedly increased the expression level and binding of DNA methyltransferase-1 (Dnmt1) and histone deacetylase-1 (HDAC1) to the TSS of the SFRP1 promoter region, resulting in repression of acetyl-histone H3-binding capacity to SFRP1 promoter and the eventual epigenetic silencing of SFRP1 expression. Furthermore, the core protein-promoted cell proliferation, migration and invasiveness were effectively abrogated either by Dnmt1 knockdown or restoration of SFRP1 expression in hepatoma cells. Dnmt1 knockdown or SFRP1 overexpression also inhibited HCV core-induced epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and significantly decreased the expression levels of activated β-catenin and Wnt/β-catenin target genes, c-Myc and cyclin D1. We further showed that knockdown of Dnmt1 and restoration of SFRP1 inhibited core-induced in vivo tumor growth and aggressiveness in a xenograft HCC model. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that the HCV core-induced epigenetic silencing of SFRP1 may lead to the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway and thus contribute to HCC aggressiveness through induction of EMT."

These events occur without premeiotic chromosomal replication, sister chromatid cohesion, synapsis or recombination.

https://openalex.org/W1978482772,"The X-ray crystal structure of a member of the glucose-specific phosphotransferase system (EIIAGlc) bound to the MalFGK2 maltose transporter is presented, revealing that two EIIAGlcproteins bind to the cytoplasmic ATPase subunits of the maltose transporter to stabilize it in an inward-facing conformation that prevents ATP hydrolysis. When a preferred carbon source is available, bacteria use a system known as carbon catabolite repression (CCR) to halt the synthesis and activity of proteins involved in the usage of less-preferred carbon sources. In Escherichia coli the glucose-specific phosphotransferase system, enzyme IIA (EIIAGlc), is central to this control system, and when glucose is available in the environment transport of other sugars, such as maltose, is shut down. This paper reports the X-ray crystal structure of a EIIAGlc bound to the MalFGK2 maltose transporter. The structure reveals that two EIIAGlc molecules bind to the cytoplasmic ATPase subunits of the maltose transporter, stabilizing it in an inward-facing conformation and preventing the structural rearrangements necessary for ATP hydrolysis — and maltose transport. Efficient carbon utilization is critical to the survival of microorganisms in competitive environments. To optimize energy usage, bacteria have developed an integrated control system to preferentially uptake carbohydrates that support rapid growth. The availability of a preferred carbon source, such as glucose, represses the synthesis and activities of proteins necessary for the transport and metabolism of secondary carbon sources. This regulatory phenomenon is defined as carbon catabolite repression1. In enteric bacteria, the key player of carbon catabolite repression is a component of the glucose-specific phosphotransferase system, enzyme IIA (EIIAGlc)1,2. It is known that unphosphorylated EIIAGlc binds to and inhibits a variety of transporters when glucose is available1,2. However, understanding the underlying molecular mechanism has been hindered by the complete absence of structures for any EIIAGlc–transporter complexes. Here we present the 3.9 Å crystal structure of Escherichia coli EIIAGlc in complex with the maltose transporter, an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter. The structure shows that two EIIAGlc molecules bind to the cytoplasmic ATPase subunits, stabilizing the transporter in an inward-facing conformation and preventing the structural rearrangements necessary for ATP hydrolysis. We also show that the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of the full-length EIIAGlc and an amino-terminal truncation mutant differ by 60-fold, consistent with the hypothesis that the amino-terminal region, disordered in the crystal structure, functions as a membrane anchor to increase the effective EIIAGlc concentration at the membrane3,4. Together these data suggest a model of how the central regulatory protein EIIAGlc allosterically inhibits maltose uptake in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W2102025023,"The four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV-1 to -4) cause the most important arthropod-borne viral disease of humans. DENV non-structural protein 5 (NS5) contains enzymatic activities required for capping and replication of the viral RNA genome that occurs in the host cytoplasm. However, previous studies have shown that DENV-2 NS5 accumulates in the nucleus during infection. In this study, we examined the nuclear localization of NS5 for all four DENV serotypes. We demonstrate for the first time that there are serotypic differences in NS5 nuclear localization. Whereas the DENV-2 and -3 proteins accumulate in the nucleus, DENV-1 and -4 NS5 are predominantly if not exclusively localized to the cytoplasm. Comparative studies on the DENV-2 and -4 NS5 proteins revealed that the difference in DENV-4 NS5 nuclear localization was not due to rapid nuclear export but rather the lack of a functional nuclear localization sequence. Interaction studies using DENV-2 and -4 NS5 and human importin-α isoforms failed to identify an interaction that supported the differential nuclear localization of NS5. siRNA knockdown of the human importin-α isoform KPNA2, corresponding to the murine importin-α isoform previously shown to bind to DENV-2 NS5, did not substantially affect DENV-2 NS5 nuclear localization, whereas knockdown of importin-β did. The serotypic differences in NS5 nuclear localization did not correlate with differences in IL-8 gene expression.

We also noted a significant reduction in the frequency of CD44+p27+ cells in parous women and showed, using explant cultures, that parity-related signaling pathways play a role in regulating the number of p27+ cells and their proliferation.

A single full-term pregnancy in early adulthood decreases the risk for estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) postmenopausal breast cancer, the most common form of the disease (Colditz et al., 2004Colditz G.A. Rosner B.A. Chen W.Y. Holmes M.D. Hankinson S.E. Risk factors for breast cancer according to estrogen and progesterone receptor status.J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2004; 96: 218-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Age at first pregnancy is critical because the protective effect decreases after the mid 20s, and women aged >35 at first birth have increased risk for both ER+ and ER− breast cancer. Parity-associated risk is also influenced by germline variants. For example, BRCA1 and BRCA2 (hereafter BRCA1/BRCA2) mutation carriers do not experience the same risk reduction as do women in the general population (Cullinane et al., 2005Cullinane C.A. Lubinski J. Neuhausen S.L. Ghadirian P. Lynch H.T. Isaacs C. Weber B. Moller P. Offit K. Kim-Sing C. et al.Effect of pregnancy as a risk factor for breast cancer in BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers.Int. J. Cancer. 2005; 117: 988-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These epidemiological data suggest that pregnancy induces long-lasting changes in the normal breast epithelium and that its effects are distinct for ER+ and ER− tumors. The protective effect of pregnancy is also observed in animal models and can be mimicked by hormonal factors (Ginger and Rosen, 2003Ginger M.R. Rosen J.M.

The cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie pregnancy and hormone-induced refractoriness to tumorigenesis are largely undefined. Hypotheses proposed include induction of differentiation, decreased susceptibility to carcinogens, reduction in cell proliferation and in stem cell number, and altered systemic environment due to a decrease in circulating growth hormone and other endocrine factors (Ginger and Rosen, 2003Ginger M.R.

Almost all studies investigating pregnancy-induced changes and the breast cancer-preventative effects of pregnancy have been conducted in rodents and mostly focused on the mammary gland. Global gene expression profiling of mammary glands from virgin and parous rats identified changes in TGF-β and IGF signaling and in the expression of extracellular matrix proteins (Blakely et al., 2006Blakely C.M. Stoddard A.J. Belka G.K. Dugan K.D. Notarfrancesco K.L. Moody S.E. D’Cruz C.M. Chodosh L.A.

Related studies in humans also identified consistent differences in gene expression profiles between nulliparous and parous women (Asztalos et al., 2010Asztalos S. Gann P.H. Hayes M.K. Nonn L.

Cancer. 2012; 131: 1059-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, because these studies have used mammary gland or organoids, which are composed of multiple cell types, the cellular origin of these gene expression differences remains unknown. Emerging data indicate that mammary epithelial progenitor or stem cells are the normal cell of origin of breast carcinomas, and breast cancer risk factors may alter the number and/or properties of these cells (Visvader, 2011Visvader J.E. Cells of origin in cancer.Nature. 2011; 469: 314-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). Studies assessing changes in mammary epithelial stem cells following pregnancy have been conducted only in mice and so far have been inconclusive (Asselin-Labat et al., 2010Asselin-Labat M.L.

Thus, the effect of pregnancy on the number and functional properties of murine mammary epithelial progenitors remains elusive and has not yet been analyzed in humans. Here, we describe the detailed molecular characterization of luminal and myoepithelial cells, lineage-negative (lin−) cells with progenitor features, and stromal fibroblasts from nulliparous and parous women including BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers, the identification of cell-type-specific differences related to parity, functional validation of hormonal factors and selected parity-related pathways on the proliferation of mammary epithelial cells, and the relevance of these to breast cancer risk. To investigate parity-associated differences in the normal human breast, first, we defined three distinct mammary epithelial cell populations by FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorting) for cell surface markers previously associated with luminal (CD24), myoepithelial (CD10), and progenitor features (lin−/CD44+) (Bloushtain-Qimron et al., 2008Bloushtain-Qimron N.

Cells stained for these markers showed minimal overlap both in nulliparous and parous tissues, with CD24+ and CD44+ fractions being especially distinct (Figures S1A and S1B available online). The fraction of CD44+ cells was slightly higher in parous compared to nulliparous samples, likely due to the more-developed lobulo-alveolar structures in parous women (Russo et al., 2001Russo J. Lynch H. Russo I.H. Mammary gland architecture as a determining factor in the susceptibility of the human breast to cancer.Breast J. 2001; 7: 278-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) that appear to contain many CD44+ cells (Figures S1B and S1C). We also performed multicolor immunofluorescence analyses for these three cell surface markers and genes specific for luminal (e.g., GATA3) and myoepithelial (e.g., SMA) cells to further confirm the identity of the cells (Figure S1D). To investigate parity-related differences in gene expression profiles, we analyzed immunomagnetic bead-purified (Bloushtain-Qimron et al., 2008Bloushtain-Qimron N. Yao J. Snyder E.L. Shipitsin M. Campbell L.L. Mani S.A. Hu M. Chen H. Ustyansky V. Antosiewicz J.E. et al.Cell type-specific DNA methylation patterns in the human breast.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Shipitsin M. Choudhury S. Wu Z. Protopopov A. Yao J. Lo P.K. Bessarabova M. Ishkin A. Nikolsky Y. et al.Altered antisense-to-sense transcript ratios in breast cancer.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 2820-2824Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To minimize variability unrelated to parity status, women were closely matched for age, number of pregnancies, age at first and time since last pregnancy, and ethnicity (Table S1). The expression of known cell-type-specific genes was consistently observed in each cell type from nulliparous and parous samples based on SAGE-seq confirming the purity and identity of the cells (Figure S2A). Comparison of each cell type between nulliparous and parous samples revealed the most pronounced differences in CD44+ cells, where the numbers of significantly (p < 0.05) differentially expressed genes and the fold differences were the largest (Figure 1A; Table S2). The degrees of differences were smaller and similar in CD10+ and CD24+ cells, whereas stromal fibroblasts had the fewest differentially expressed genes (Table S2). Further examination using principal component analysis (PCA) confirmed that CD24+ and CD10+ cells and fibroblasts from nulliparous and parous women were highly similar, whereas CD44+ cells formed very distinct nulliparous and parous clusters (Figure 1B). In line with this, CD44+ cells demonstrated the largest distance in gene expression patterns between nulliparous and parous samples (Figure 1C). To validate our findings in an independent data set, we analyzed the levels of our differentially expressed genes in a Norwegian cohort (Haakensen et al., 2011aHaakensen V.D. Bjøro T. Lüders T. Riis M. Bukholm I.K. Kristensen V.N. Troester M.A. Homen M.M. Ursin G. Børresen-Dale A.L. Helland Å.

Lingjaerde O.C. Lüders T. Riis M. Prat A. Troester M.A. Holmen M.M. Frantzen J.O. Romundstad L. Navjord D. et al.Gene expression profiles of breast biopsies from healthy women identify a group with claudin-low features.BMC Med. Genomics. 2011; 4: 77Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) matched to our samples for age (<40) and parity (P2). Clustering analysis using our differentially expressed gene sets divided these samples into a distinct nulliparous and a mixed parous/nulliparous group (Figure 1D). Using genes differentially expressed in all four cell types combined or only in CD44+ cells gave identical results. Interestingly, nulliparous samples that formed a distinct cluster (nulliparous B) or were closer to parous cases (nulliparous A) displayed significant differences in serum estradiol levels (SELs) with samples more similar to parous cases having low SELs (Figure 1E). Because SEL and breast epithelial cell proliferation are higher in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, our findings imply that cells from nulliparous and parous women may be more distinct in luteal phase. The expression of selected genes was validated in additional samples by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) using CD44+ cells from multiple nulliparous and parous cases to confirm SAGE-seq data (Figure S2B). Based on these findings in gene expression profiles, we focused our follow-up studies on CD44+ and CD24+ cells. To strengthen our hypothesis that the parity-associated differences we detected in CD44+ cells might be related to the risk for breast cancer, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of CD44+ cells from parous BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers (Table S3), whose risk is not decreased by parity (Cullinane et al., 2005Cullinane C.A. Lubinski J. Neuhausen S.L. Ghadirian P. Lynch H.T. Isaacs C. Weber B. Moller P. Offit K. Kim-Sing C. et al.Effect of pregnancy as a risk factor for breast cancer in BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers.Int. J. Cancer. 2005; 117: 988-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). CD44+ cells from parous BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers clustered with CD44+ cells from nulliparous controls (Figure 1F), suggesting that parity-associated changes observed in non-BRCA1/BRCA2 carriers may not occur in these high-risk women. To determine if the lack of parity-associated changes in CD44+ cells from BRCA1/BRCA2 women is due to differences in the distribution of cell populations, we performed FACS analysis of multiple tissue samples from BRCA1/BRCA2 and noncarrier women. The relative frequency of CD44+ was slightly higher in parous compared to nulliparous samples, which was associated with a slight decrease in CD24+ cells, whereas the relative frequency of CD10+ cells was about the same in all groups (Figure 1G). The increase in ratio of CD44+-to-CD24+ cells in parous samples could potentially be due to the increased number of lobulo-alveolar structures observed in parous women (Figure S1B) (Russo et al., 2001Russo J. Lynch H. Russo I.H. Mammary gland architecture as a determining factor in the susceptibility of the human breast to cancer.Breast J. 2001; 7: 278-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) or due to the loss of CD24+ cells during involution. Because the ultimate goal of our study is to identify targets for chemoprevention that would mimic the cancer-protective effects of parity, we investigated which signaling pathways might be affected by parity-related molecular changes. Because early pregnancy specifically decreases the risk for ER+ breast tumors, we first explored our differentially expressed gene lists in CD44+ cells for candidate mediators of this effect. We found several genes that may change cellular response to steroid hormones by altering metabolism (e.g., HSD17B11) or by modulating nuclear receptors (e.g., NCOR1) (Table S2). Androgen receptor (AR) and one of its key targets PSA (KLK3) were highly expressed in nulliparous CD44+ cells, implying active androgen signaling that is decreased by parity. Among genes highly expressed in parous CD44+ cells were a number of known tumor suppressors, including CASP8 (Cox et al., 2007Cox A. Dunning A.M. Garcia-Closas M. Balasubramanian S. Reed M.W. Pooley K.A. Scollen S. Baynes C. Ponder B.A. Chanock S. et al.Kathleen Cunningham Foundation Consortium for Research into Familial Breast Cancer; Breast Cancer Association ConsortiumA common coding variant in CASP8 is associated with breast cancer risk.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 352-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), SCRIB (Humbert et al., 2008Humbert P.O. Grzeschik N.A. Brumby A.M. Galea R. Elsum I. Richardson H.E. Control of tumourigenesis by the Scribble/Dlg/Lgl polarity module.Oncogene. 2008; 27: 6888-6907Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), and DNA repair genes (e.g., PRKDC). To determine overall activation of specific biological functions due to parity, we performed pathway enrichment, network, and protein interactome analyses using the MetaCore platform (Nikolsky et al., 2009Nikolsky Y. Kirillov E. Zuev R. Rakhmatulin E. Nikolskaya T. Functional analysis of OMICs data and small molecule compounds in an integrated “knowledge-based” platform.Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 563: 177-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We found that parity has similar global effects on three of the four cell types analyzed because pathways built on expression patterns in CD10+ and CD44+ cells and stroma cluster together for parous and nulliparous states (Figure 2A). The most significant pathways highly active in parous samples in all three cell types included apoptosis, survival, and immune response, whereas stem cells and development-related pathways were enriched only in CD44+ cells from nulliparous women (Figure 2B; Table S4). Pathways highly active in parous stroma were enriched in fatty acid metabolism and adipocyte differentiation, consistent with adipose tissue development and a decrease in breast density following pregnancy (Boyd et al., 2009Boyd N.F. Martin L.J. Yaffe M. Minkin S. Mammographic density.Breast Cancer Res. 2009; 11: S4Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The functional categories of genes affected by parity were similar in all four cell types with receptors and enzymes representing the most enriched groups (Figure 2C; Table S5). We focused our further analysis on CD44+ cells that showed the most pronounced differences between parous and nulliparous states. Pathways highly active in nulliparous samples are related to major developmental and tumorigenic pathways including cytoskeleton remodeling, DNA methylation, and WNT signaling, whereas pathways more active in parous samples include PI3K/AKT signaling and apoptosis (Table S4). Importantly, the highest-scored pathway for high-in nulliparous genes is four orders of magnitude more statistically significant than those for high-in-parous genes, suggesting that downregulation of protumorigenic developmental pathways is a prominent feature of CD44+ cells from parous women. Interactome analysis also demonstrated a much larger number of overconnected proteins in nulliparous than in parous state in all four cell types, but particularly in CD44+ cells (Figure 2C). Because the relative number of interactions (connectivity) is directly related to the functional activity of a data set (Nikolsky et al., 2008Nikolsky Y. Sviridov E. Yao J. Dosymbekov D. Ustyansky V. Kaznacheev V. Dezso Z. Mulvey L. Macconaill L.E. Winckler W. et al.Genome-wide functional synergy between amplified and mutated genes in human breast cancer.Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 9532-9540Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), these results suggest that parous cells are substantially less active than nulliparous ones. The most overconnected (and overexpressed) transcription factor (TF) in nulliparous CD44+ cells is SCMH-1, a component of PRC1, which is required for the repression of many genes during development and for the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (Ohtsubo et al., 2008Ohtsubo M. Yasunaga S. Ohno Y. Tsumura M. Okada S. Ishikawa N. Shirao K. Kikuchi A. Nishitani H. Kobayashi M. Takihara Y. Polycomb-group complex 1 acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for Geminin to sustain hematopoietic stem cell activity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 10396-10401Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The causal network assembled from the top-scored pathways and overconnected genes high in nulliparous CD44+ cells included a number of tumorigenic pathways. The network’s key “triggers” (i.e., secreted ligands) comprise IL-6, VEGFA, PDGF-B, CCL-2, NOTCH, and BMP4, signaling through major hubs such as PI3K, GSKβ, β-catenin, RhoA/Rac1, MEK3, and MEK4. The network activated in CD44+ cells from parous women featured IL-10, IL-23, TGF-β2 as ligands, β3 adrenergic receptor, and TFs STAT1, STAT4, STAT5, and NF-κB. We also explored pathways significantly different in CD44+ cells from control parous and BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers. Very few pathways were common between cells from BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers, implying that although both are distinct compared to control parous women, they are also different from one another. Several of the top-scoring pathways in cells from BRCA1 mutation carriers relate to DNA damage, cell cycle, and apoptosis, whereas in cells of BRCA2 mutation carriers, many significantly high-scoring pathways are involved in stem cells such as WNT, Slit-Robo, and IGF signaling (Table S4). Because pregnancy-induced protection against mammary tumors is also observed in rodents, we investigated whether pathways altered by parity are conserved across species. We compared pathways in CD44+ cells to those generated based on genes differentially expressed between virgin and parous rats (Blakely et al., 2006Blakely C.M. Stoddard A.J. Belka G.K. Dugan K.D. Notarfrancesco K.L. Moody S.E. D’Cruz C.M. Chodosh L.A. Hormone-induced protection against mammary tumorigenesis is conserved in multiple rat strains and identifies a core gene expression signature induced by pregnancy.Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 6421-6431Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We found a significant overlap between pathways highly active in nulliparous and virgin samples, with top-ranked pathways, including cytoskeleton remodeling and cell adhesion, known to be highly relevant in stem cells (Figures 2D and 2E). A network built of the common pathways included a complete NOTCH pathway, IGF, EGF, CD44, CD9, and ITGB1 as triggers (i.e., ligands and receptors), c-Src, PKC, and FAK as major signaling kinases, and c-Jun, p53, SNAIL1, and LEF as TFs. Thus, pregnancy appears to induce similar alterations in the mammary gland regardless of species. Reduction of breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women conferred by full-term pregnancy in early adulthood implies the induction of long-lasting changes such as alterations in epigenetic patterns. To investigate this hypothesis, we analyzed the comprehensive DNA methylation and histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (K27) profiles of CD24+ and CD44+ cells from nulliparous and parous women using MSDK-seq (methylation-specific digital karyotyping applied to high-throughput sequencing) (Hu et al., 2005Hu M. Yao J. Cai L. Bachman K.E. van den Brûle F. Velculescu V. Polyak K. Distinct epigenetic changes in the stromal cells of breast cancers.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 899-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) and ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation applied to high-throughput sequencing) (Maruyama et al., 2011Maruyama R. Choudhury S. Kowalczyk A. Bessarabova M. Beresford-Smith B. Conway T. Kaspi A. Wu Z. Nikolskaya T. Merino V.F. et al.Epigenetic regulation of cell type-specific expression patterns in the human mammary epithelium.PLoS Genet. 2011; 7: e1001369Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), respectively. Comparison of MSDK-seq libraries of nulliparous and parous samples within each cell type showed a higher number of significantly (p < 0.05) differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in CD44+ cells. In both cell types, more DMRs were hypermethylated in nulliparous than in parous cells (Figure 3A; Table S6). The differences in methylation of selected genes were validated in additional samples by quantitative methylation-specific PCR (qMSP) using CD44+ cells from multiple nulliparous and parous cases to confirm MSDK-seq data (Figure S3A). To investigate pathways affected by parity-related epigenetic alterations, we analyzed pathways enriched by genes associated with gene body or promoter DMRs in CD44+ cells from nulliparous and parous samples and found very little overlap among the four distinct categories (Figure 3B). Promoter hypermethylation in parous CD44+ cells involved stem cell (e.g., H3K9 demethylase, FGF2, BMP, EGFR, pluripotency) and apoptosis and survival pathways, whereas promoter hypermethylation in nulliparous CD44+ cells involved stem cell (e.g., TGF-β/SMAD, H3K4 demethylase) pathways, cell cycle, and nucleotide metabolism. The fraction of TFs among differentially methylated genes is 2- to 3-fold higher than expected and than observed for differentially expressed genes, implying that promoter methylation is a preferred control mechanism of their expression (Figures 3C and 3D). Similar to the expression data, DMRs in nulliparous samples had higher numbers of overconnected objects than in parous ones. Gene body DMRs in nulliparous CD44+ cells had the highest number of overconnected objects, and TFs represented a significant fraction of overconnected objects in promoter hypermethylated DMRs in nulliparous CD44+ cells (Figure 3C). We also analyzed associations between differential gene expression and presence of DMRs in CD44+ and CD24+cells. However, we found no significant correlation at the global scale (data not shown), potentially due to the complex relationship between DNA methylation and transcription because DNA methylation can have both positive and negative effects on gene expression, depending on the location relative to the transcription start site (Jones, 1999Jones P.A.

Even so, the expression of several TFs with key roles in stem cells (e.g., HES7, STAT1) was correlated with the degree of promoter or gene body DNA methylation (Figure 3E).

https://openalex.org/W2047369520,"Too Much or Too Little An important task of the nervous system is to distribute information appropriately throughout the brain. The olfactory and gustatory systems of Drosophila provide good models for understanding these processes and the underlying mechanisms (see the Perspective by Su and Carlson ). Lin et al. (p. 1338 ) mapped out the circuit that detects carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), an important environmental and communication signal for fruit flies. Two distinct classes of projection neurons mediate avoidance of high and low concentrations of CO 2 , while a third class, comprising inhibitory neurons, shuts down the low-concentration pathway at high concentrations. In contrast to other basic taste qualities, salt is innately attractive at low concentrations, but aversive at high concentrations. The mechanisms underlying salt detection are poorly understood in any species mainly because of a lack of specific molecular tools. Zhang et al. (p. 1334 ) discovered that Drosophila uses two types of gustatory receptor neurons to distinguish between high and low concentrations of salt. One type is activated maximally by low salt and induces attractive feeding behavior. The other class of receptors is activated primarily by high salt and leads to avoidance behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2000031429,"Overexpression of the adverse prognostic marker ERBB2 occurs in 30% of breast cancers and is associated with aggressive disease and poor outcomes. Our recent findings have shown that NR1D1 and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ)-binding protein (PBP) act through a common pathway in upregulating several genes in the de novo fatty acid synthesis network, which is highly active in ERBB2-positive breast cancer cells. NR1D1 and PBP are functionally related to PPARγ, a well-established positive regulator of adipogenesis and lipid storage. Here, we report that inhibition of the PPARγ pathway reduces the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)-positive population in ERBB2-positive breast cancer cells. Results from in vitro tumorsphere formation assays demonstrate that the PPARγ antagonists GW9662 and T0070907 decrease tumorsphere formation in ERBB2-positive cells, but not other breast cells. We show that the mechanism by which GW9662 treatment causes a reduction in ALDH-positive population cells is partially due to ROS, as it can be rescued by treatment with N-acetyl-cysteine. Furthermore, global gene expression analyses show that GW9662 treatment suppresses the expression of several lipogenic genes, including ACLY, MIG12, FASN and NR1D1, and the stem-cell related genes KLF4 and ALDH in BT474 cells. Antagonist treatment also decreases the level of acetylation in histone 3 and histone 4 in BT474 cells, compared with MCF7 cells. In vivo, GW9662 pre-treatment inhibits the tumor-seeding ability of BT474 cells. Together, these results show that the PPARγ pathway is critical for the cancer stem cell properties of ERBB2-positive breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2054674322,"Chromatin structure and gene expression are both regulated by nucleosome assembly. How environmental factors influence histone nuclear import and the nucleosome assembly pathway, leading to changes in chromatin organization and transcription, remains unknown. Acrolein (Acr) is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, which is abundant in the environment, especially in cigarette smoke. It has recently been implicated as a potential major carcinogen of smoking-related lung cancer. Here we show that Acr forms adducts with histone proteins in vitro and in vivo and preferentially reacts with free histones rather than with nucleosomal histones. Cellular fractionation analyses reveal that Acr exposure specifically inhibits acetylations of N-terminal tails of cytosolic histones H3 and H4, modifications that are important for nuclear import and chromatin assembly. Notably, Acr exposure compromises the delivery of histone H3 into chromatin and increases chromatin accessibility. Moreover, changes in nucleosome occupancy at several genomic loci are correlated with transcriptional responses to Acr exposure. Our data provide new insights into mechanisms whereby environmental factors interact with the genome and influence genome function."
https://openalex.org/W2019116051,"Ca(2+) signaling is essential for bone homeostasis and skeletal development. Here, we show that the transient receptor potential canonical 1 (TRPC1) channel and the inhibitor of MyoD family, I-mfa, function antagonistically in the regulation of osteoclastogenesis. I-mfa null mice have an osteopenic phenotype characterized by increased osteoclast numbers and surface, which are normalized in mice lacking both Trpc1 and I-mfa. In vitro differentiation of pre-osteoclasts derived from I-mfa-deficient mice leads to an increased number of mature osteoclasts and higher bone resorption per osteoclast. These parameters return to normal levels in osteoclasts derived from double mutant mice. Consistently, whole cell currents activated in response to the depletion of intracellular Ca(2+) stores are larger in pre-osteoclasts derived from I-mfa knock-out mice compared with currents in wild type mice and normalized in cells derived from double mutant mice, suggesting a cell-autonomous effect of I-mfa on TRPC1 in these cells. A new splice variant of TRPC1 (TRPC1ε) was identified in early pre-osteoclasts. Heterologous expression of TRPC1ε in HEK293 cells revealed that it is unique among all known TRPC1 isoforms in its ability to amplify the activity of the Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channel, mediating store-operated currents. TRPC1ε physically interacts with Orai1, the pore-forming subunit of the CRAC channel, and I-mfa is recruited to the TRPC1ε-Orai1 complex through TRPC1ε suppressing CRAC channel activity. We propose that the positive and negative modulation of the CRAC channel by TRPC1ε and I-mfa, respectively, fine-tunes the dynamic range of the CRAC channel regulating osteoclastogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2051581852,"Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in pancreatic beta-cells is potentiated by fatty acids (FA). The initial step in the metabolism of intracellular FA is the conversion to acyl-CoA by long chain acyl-CoA synthetases (Acsls). Because the predominantly expressed Acsl isoforms in INS 832/13 cells are Acsl4 and -5, we characterized the role of these Acsls in beta-cell function by using siRNA to knock down Acsl4 or Acsl5. Compared with control cells, an 80% suppression of Acsl4 decreased GSIS and FA-potentiated GSIS by 32 and 54%, respectively. Knockdown of Acsl5 did not alter GSIS. Acsl4 knockdown did not alter FA oxidation or long chain acyl-CoA levels.

Arachidonate (AA; 20:4ω6) is normally esterified to glycerophospholipids and represents ∼30% of the fatty acid mass in pancreatic islet glycerophospholipids (9.Ramanadham S. Bohrer A. Mueller M.

Glucose stimulates the synthesis of 12-HETE, and inhibiting 12-HETE synthesis in isolated rat islets suppresses GSIS. Similarly, different EET species also alter beta-cell function. Thus, 5,6-EET, but not 8,9-, 11,12-, or 14,15-EET, stimulates insulin secretion in isolated rat islets (17.Falck J.R. Manna S. Moltz J. Chacos N. Capdevila J. Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids stimulate glucagon and insulin release from isolated rat pancreatic islets.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 114: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-EET stimulate glucagon release from the same islets. Although AA and its metabolites play a role in GSIS, it is not understood how these metabolites are regulated in the beta-cell or how they might stimulate or impair insulin secretion. Central to the intracellular metabolism of fatty acids is their activation by one of a family of five long chain acyl-CoA synthetases (Acsl1, 3–6). Each of the long chain acyl-CoA synthetases is encoded by a separate gene and differs in substrate preference, enzyme kinetics, subcellular location, and tissue-specific expression (18.Coleman R.A. Lewin T.M. Van Horn C.G. Gonzalez-Baro M.R. Do long chain acyl-CoA synthetases regulate fatty acid entry into synthetic versus degradative pathways?.J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 2123-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Activation to an acyl-CoA is required before FA can be oxidized for ATP production, esterified for the synthesis of glycerolipids or cholesterol esters, or used in a signaling pathway. Both loss of function and gain of function studies suggest that each Acsl isoform is distinct in directing acyl-CoAs to one or more specific pathways. For example, Acsl1 deficiency in adipose or heart does not alter glycerolipid synthesis but profoundly diminishes FA oxidation (19.Ellis J.M. Mentock S.M. Depetrillo M.A. Koves T.R. Sen S. Watkins S.M. Muoio D.M. Cline G.W. Taegtmeyer H. Shulman G.I. Willis M.S. Coleman R.A.

Nutr. 2000; 130: 299S-304SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the Acsl isoforms that synthesize acyl-CoAs and their role in regulating FA flux and FA metabolites in beta-cells have not been directly examined. Using INS 832/13 insulinoma cells, we show that knocking down Acsl4 impairs GSIS by increasing free EETs, that direct incubation of INS 832/13 cells with EETs reduces insulin secretion, and that Acsl4 activates EETs to produce EET-CoAs that may then be re-esterified into glycerophospholipids.

After cooling to room temperature, PBS was added to bring the pH to ∼8.0. The saponified lipid products and media lipids were extracted twice with ethyl ether after adding internal standards (30 ng of prostaglandin E2-d4, 10,11-dihydroxynonadecanoic acid, and 10,11-epoxyheptadecanoic acid (Cayman Chemicals)) and butylated hydroxytoluene. Media and cellular eicosanoid levels were quantified by liquid chromatography with an Agilent 1200 Series capillary HPLC (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The samples were analyzed in triplicate. Negative ion electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry was used for detection. Analyses were performed on an MDS Sciex API 3000 equipped with a TurboIonSpray source (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) (28.Edin M.L. Wang Z. Bradbury J.A. Graves J.P. Lih F.B. DeGraff L.M.

Heptadecanoyl CoA was employed as an internal standard. The data are expressed as means ± S.E. The significance of data was declared at p < 0.05 by Student's t test. Profiling of Acsl mRNA expression by quantitative PCR in INS-1 832/13 revealed that Acsl4 and -5 are the predominantly expressed Acsl isoforms; Acsl1, -3, and -6 were expressed at lower levels (Fig. 1A). To determine the role of the major Acsls in INS 832/13 cell lipid metabolism and to determine whether their activity plays a role in insulin secretion, we used siRNAs to knock down either Acsl4 or Acsl5. A siRNA targeted against Acsl5 reduced the level of Acsl5 mRNA by more than 80% and reduced Acsl5 protein expression by ∼30% relative to siControl (Fig. 1, B and C), but the expression of Acsl4 mRNA did not significantly change, and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was not significantly altered (Fig. 1D). These data indicate that, despite being expressed at a level higher than any of the other Acsl isoforms, Acsl5 in INS 832/13 cells does not play a role in GSIS. To determine the role of Acsl4 in INS 832/13 cell lipid metabolism and insulin secretion, two siRNAs targeted against Acsl4 reduced the level of Acsl4 mRNA by more than 75% (Fig. 2A). This knockdown of Acsl4 did not significantly change the expression of Acsl5 mRNA, indicating that Acsl5 did not compensate for the Acsl4 deficiency. Likewise, the other Acsl isoforms (1, 3, and 6) and fatty acid transport proteins (Fatp4 and Fatp5) mRNAs were unaffected (data not shown). Both of the Acsl4 siRNAs reduced the level of Acsl4 protein expression after transfection by greater than 80% (Fig. 2B). Acsl specific activity in total cell membranes was then measured with three different FA substrates, AA, palmitate, and oleate (32.Kang M.J. Fujino T. Sasano H. Minekura H. Yabuki N. Nagura H. Iijima H. Yamamoto T.T. A novel arachidonate-preferring acyl-CoA synthetase is present in steroidogenic cells of the rat adrenal, ovary, and testis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 2880-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Knockdown of Acsl4 significantly decreased Acsl specific activity by 57% for AA, 46% for palmitate, and 53% for oleate (Fig. 2C). Residual Acsl activity results from the other Acsl isoforms that are still expressed and remain functional. Interestingly, compared with both palmitate and oleate, AA gave the highest Acsl specific activity, as suggested previously (32.Kang M.J. Fujino T. Sasano H. Minekura H. Yabuki N. Nagura H. Iijima H. Yamamoto T.T. A novel arachidonate-preferring acyl-CoA synthetase is present in steroidogenic cells of the rat adrenal, ovary, and testis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 2880-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and its activity was diminished the most by siAcsl4. These data suggest that in INS 832/13 cells, Acsl4 contributes approximately half of the total cellular Acsl activity. Given the substrate preference and tissue distribution of Acsl4 (32.Kang M.J. Fujino T. Sasano H. Minekura H. Yabuki N. Nagura H. Iijima H. Yamamoto T.T. A novel arachidonate-preferring acyl-CoA synthetase is present in steroidogenic cells of the rat adrenal, ovary, and testis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 2004-2010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), we evaluated the effect of Acsl4 knockdown on insulin secretion. In the presence of various secretagogues, including glucose, specific fatty acids, and KCl, knockdown of Acsl4 expression significantly reduced insulin secretion (Fig. 2D). In siAcsl4 knockdown cells stimulated solely with 17 mm glucose, GSIS was reduced by 32%. Further, the addition of a combination of oleate and palmitate in a physiologic 2:1 unsaturated:saturated molar ratio increased insulin secretion relative to the effect of glucose alone. However, in all treatment groups compared with the siControl cells, the siAcsl4 cells secreted less insulin. In both siControl and siAcsl4 cells, the differential rise in insulin secretion with exogenous FA was likely due to the known effects of GPR40 on FA-augmented insulin secretion (7.Itoh Y. Kawamata Y. Harada M. Kobayashi M. Fujii R. Fukusumi S. Ogi K. Hosoya M. Tanaka Y. Uejima H. Tanaka H. Maruyama M. Satoh R. Okubo S. Kizawa H. Komatsu H. Matsumura F. Noguchi Y. Shinohara T. Hinuma S. Fujisawa Y. Fujino M. Free fatty acids regulate insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells through GPR40.Nature. 2003; 422: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). Likewise, in siAcsl4 cells relative to siControl, the reduction in insulin secretion was probably due to generation of FA metabolites with signaling properties formed from AA. These results indicate that a single specific Acsl isoform, Acsl4, mediates the majority of intracellular Acsl activity and that normal GSIS requires Acsl4 activity. To further characterize the consequences of Acsl4 knockdown, we evaluated the incorporation of oleate and AA into neutral lipids and phospholipids. Incorporation of oleate into total glycerolipids was not affected by the knockdown of Acsl4 (Fig. 3A), and no changes were observed in the incorporation of oleate into neutral lipids (triacylglycerol, diacylglycerol, or cholesterol esters) (Fig. 3C), or phospholipids (Fig. 3E). However, Acsl4 knockdown resulted in 20% lower incorporation of AA into total lipids (Fig. 3B) with a 51% reduction in its incorporation into neutral lipids (Fig. 3D), without altering the incorporation of AA into phospholipids (Fig. 3F). These results suggest that Acsl4 preferentially channels arachidonate toward the synthesis of specific intracellular glycerolipids. We evaluated the effect of Acsl4 knockdown on the oxidation of palmitate at basal and stimulatory glucose concentrations (3 or 17 mm glucose) to determine whether a defect in FA oxidation might have reduced"
https://openalex.org/W2000781625,"SLC35A3 is considered the main UDP-N-acetylglucosamine transporter (NGT) in mammals. Detailed analysis of NGT is restricted because mammalian mutant cells defective in this activity have not been isolated. Therefore, using the siRNA approach, we developed and characterized several NGT-deficient mammalian cell lines. CHO, CHO-Lec8, and HeLa cells deficient in NGT activity displayed a decrease in the amount of highly branched tri- and tetraantennary N-glycans, whereas monoantennary and diantennary ones remained unchanged or even were accumulated. Silencing the expression of NGT in Madin-Darby canine kidney II cells resulted in a dramatic decrease in the keratan sulfate content, whereas no changes in biosynthesis of heparan sulfate were observed. We also demonstrated for the first time close proximity between NGT and mannosyl (α-1,6-)-glycoprotein β-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (Mgat5) in the Golgi membrane. We conclude that NGT may be important for the biosynthesis of highly branched, multiantennary complex N-glycans and keratan sulfate. We hypothesize that NGT may specifically supply β-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyl-transferase 7 (β3GnT7), Mgat5, and possibly mannosyl (α-1,3-)-glycoprotein β-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (Mgat4) with UDP-GlcNAc."
https://openalex.org/W2093612804,"ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters belong to one of the largest protein superfamilies that expands from prokaryotes to man. Recent x-ray crystal structures of bacterial and mammalian ABC exporters suggest a common alternating access mechanism of substrate transport, which has also been biochemically substantiated. However, the current model does not yet explain the coupling between substrate binding and ATP hydrolysis that underlies ATP-dependent substrate transport. In our studies on the homodimeric multidrug/lipid A ABC exporter MsbA from Escherichia coli, we performed cysteine cross-linking, fluorescence energy transfer, and cysteine accessibility studies on two reporter positions, near the nucleotide-binding domains and in the membrane domains, for transporter embedded in a biological membrane. Our results suggest for the first time that substrate binding by MsbA stimulates the maximum rate of ATP hydrolysis by facilitating the dimerization of nucleotide-binding domains in a state, which is markedly distinct from the previously described nucleotide-free, inward-facing and nucleotide-bound, outward-facing conformations of ABC exporters and which binds ATP."
https://openalex.org/W2008590826,"We previously demonstrated that sphingosine kinase 1 (Sphk1) expression and activity are up-regulated by exogenous palmitate (PAL) in a skeletal muscle model system and in diet-induced obesity in mice; however, potential functions and in vivo relevance of this have not been addressed. Here, we aimed to determine the mechanism by which PAL regulates SphK1 in muscle, and to determine potential roles for its product, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), in muscle biology in the context of obesity. Cloning and analysis of the mouse Sphk1 promoter revealed a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α cis-element that mediated activation of a reporter under control of the Sphk1 promoter; direct interaction of PPARα was demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation. PAL treatment induced the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-6 in a manner dependent on SphK1, and this was attenuated by inhibition of the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 3 (S1PR3). Diet-induced obesity in mice demonstrated that IL-6 expression in muscle, but not adipose tissue, increased in obesity, but this was attenuated in Sphk1(-/-) mice. Moreover, plasma IL-6 levels were significantly decreased in obese Sphk1(-/-) mice relative to obese wild type mice, and muscle, but not adipose tissue IL-6 signaling was activated. These data indicate that PPARα regulates Sphk1 expression in the context of fatty acid oversupply and links PAL to muscle IL-6 production. Moreover, this function of SphK1 in diet-induced obesity suggests a potential role for SphK1 in obesity-associated pathological outcomes."

https://openalex.org/W2614667111,"FOXO (forkhead box O) transcription factors are tumor suppressors and increase the life spans of model organisms. Cellular stress, in particular oxidative stress caused by an increase in levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), activates FOXOs through JNK-mediated phosphorylation. Importantly, JNK regulation of FOXO is evolutionarily conserved. Here we identified the pathway that mediates ROS-induced JNK-dependent FOXO regulation. Following increased ROS, RALA is activated by the exchange factor RLF (RalGDS-like factor), which is in complex with JIP1 (C-Jun-amino-terminal-interacting protein 1) and JNK. Active RALA consequently regulates assembly and activation of MLK3, MKK4, and JNK onto the JIP1 scaffold. Furthermore, regulation of FOXO by RALA and JIP1 is conserved in C. elegans, where both ral-1 and jip-1 depletion impairs heat shock-induced nuclear translocation of the FOXO orthologue DAF16."

Chick PEPCK-C declines through the embryonic period, and adult chick liver contains only PEPCK-M.

It is thought that generation by PEPCK-M of phosphoenolpyruvate from lactate in mitochondria can help maintain redox balance (28.Yang J. Kalhan S.C. Hanson R.W.

PEPCK-M is constitutively expressed in adult animals (29.Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Regulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) gene expression.Annu. Rev.

Furthermore, the two enzymes were shown to be independently regulated. Although PEPCK-C levels are understood to be controlled largely by transcriptional changes in response to hormonal and nutrient signals (29.Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Regulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) gene expression.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), posttranslational modifications of PEPCK have begun to receive attention. PEPCK has been reported to be targeted for phosphorylation (33.Walker R.P. Chen Z.H. Acheson R.M. Leegood R.C.

Furthermore, PEPCK-C acetylation has been reported to enhance its degradation (36.Jiang W. Wang S. Xiao M. Lin Y. Zhou L. Lei Q. Xiong Y. Guan K.L. Zhao S.

Cell. 2011; 43: 33-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). We report here that PEPCK-C and PEPCK-M undergo ADP-ribosylation, extending the portfolio of posttranslational modifications for PEPCK. Furthermore, we show that the enhancement of ADP-ribosylation of PEPCK-C and PEPCK-M by TCDD is mediated by AHR-induced TiPARP, strengthening a role for TiPARP in TCDD dysregulation of nutrient signaling and energy balance and identifying a pathway by which AHR transcriptional activity can lead to a downstream posttranslational modification of a TCDD target protein. We also report the surprising finding that although AHR activation enhances ADP-ribosylation through TiPARP, AHR suppression also enhances ADP-ribosylation by a PARP-independent mechanism. Fertilized white Leghorn eggs (Gallus gallus) (Burr Farm, Inc., Hampton, CT) were incubated at 37 °C at high humidity. Chick embryo hepatocytes (CEH) were obtained from chick embryo livers (CEL) as previously described (20.Diani-Moore S. Labitzke E. Brown R. Garvin A. Wong L. Rifkind A.B. Sunlight generates multiple tryptophan photoproducts eliciting high efficacy CYP1A induction in chick hepatocytes and in vivo.Toxicol. Sci. 2006; 90: 96-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). CEH were plated in 6-well Cell Culture Cluster plates (Costar, St Louis, MO) usually at 3 × 106 cells per well and maintained in culture medium for 48 h before treatment. Rat H4IIE, mouse Hepa1–6 and Hepa1c1c7, and human HepG2 and HEK293 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Primary rat hepatocytes were from Invitrogen. H4IIE and HepG2 cells were cultured in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS (ATCC) and 1% Pen-Strep solution (Invitrogen); Hepa1–6 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% Pen-Strep solution; Hepa1c1c7 cells were cultured in α-minimum essential medium with 10% FBS and 1% Pen-Strep; and HEK293 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. Rat primary hepatocytes were maintained for 24 h after arrival in William's Medium E without phenol red and supplementation according to the supplier's instructions using the Maintenance Supplement Pack provided by the manufacturer. After 24 h the medium was replaced with William's medium without further supplementation and treated with TCDD or dioxane. Chick embryos were used at 17 days of gestation for in ovo treatments and at 15 days for hepatocyte cultures before hatching at 21 days. Treatments with TCDD were at 1 nmol per egg in 0.005 ml dioxane in ovo or at 1 nm in CE hepatocyte cultures, 10 nm in cultures of rat primary hepatocytes, Hepa1c1c7, and Hepa1–6 cells, and 30 nm for HepG2 cells. All treatments were for 24 h unless otherwise indicated. Controls received dioxane in amounts equivalent to those used as solvent for the TCDD treatments. For cytosol from CEL, livers were isolated, weighed, and homogenized in 250 mm sucrose buffer (1:3, w/v). Homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants, containing cytosol, were stored at −80 °C. For CEH, ∼20 × 106 CEH (about 7 × 106 cells per 6-cm dish), were scraped in 1× PBS and centrifuged at 500 × g for 2 min at 4 °C; the pellets containing nuclei were resuspended in 0.2 ml of Cell Lysis Buffer (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA). The supernatants were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting mitochondria-enriched pellets were resuspended in 0.1 ml of Cell Lysis Buffer, and the supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to obtain cytosol. The fractions were stored at −80 °C. Culture medium was aspirated, and cells were washed twice with 1× PBS and scraped. Lysates were prepared in 0.175 ml of Cell Lysis Buffer per well (Cell Signaling) supplemented with 1 mm 3-aminobenzamide and 5 μm adenosine 5′-diphosphate (hydroxymethyl)pyrrolidinediol, NH4·2H2O (ADP-HDP) (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY) to inhibit PARP and poly(ADP-ribose)glycohydrolase activity, respectively, during sample preparation. Protein was measured using Bio-Rad DC or RC DC Protein assays (Bio-Rad). The coding region of chick PEPCK-C was amplified by PCR. Primers were designed using the chick PEPCK-C mRNA sequence (GenBankTM, NM_205471.1). The PCR amplification mixture contained: Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs, Inc., Ipswich, MA); forward primer, 5′-CACCatggccccagagctgaaa-3′ (5′-CACC was added as a modification for cloning purposes); reverse primer, 5′-tgttttattctcatctccaagg-3′ and cDNA from CEH as template. The PCR amplification product was purified using Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-up System (Promega Co., Madison, WI) and cloned into pcDNA™3.1 using pcDNA™3.1 Directional TOPO Expression kit (Invitrogen/Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's directions. Sequencing confirmed the PCR product as chicken PEPCK-C. For CEH, hepatocytes from CEL prepared as described above were collected by centrifugation (50 × g, 20 °C, 7 min) and resuspended in Mouse ES Cell Nucleofector Solution (Lonza Walkersville, Inc., Walkersville, MD) at 7 × 106 cells/0.1 ml. Hepatocyte suspensions were mixed with 5 μg of a pcDNA-TiPARP-FLAG construct generated in our laboratory (9.Diani-Moore S. Ram P. Li X. Mondal P. Youn D.Y. Sauve A.A. Rifkind A.B.

The following sequences were used for silencing TiPARP and the AHR: for TiPARP, SMARTpool dsRNA (Dharmacon/ThermoScientific, Waltham, MA) (5′-ggagatacaccgtgggcaa-3′, 5′-gctatgaagttatacgaaa-3′, 5′-ggatctgggaccttggata-3′, and 5′-gccagaaaggcaagctatt-3′); for AHR, a dsRNA targeting AHR sequence, 5′-gctcttactgcaggcatta-3′ (Invitrogen); for control, siGENOME Non-Targeting siRNA #3 (Dharmacon, Lafayette CO). Transfections were performed using the Lonza system following the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected CEH were plated in 6-well plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) in 2.5 ml of medium. After 24 h, lysates were prepared for Western blotting as described above. HEK293 cells were plated at 0.5 × 106 cells/well in 6-well plates. PEPCK-C-His (5 μg) with or without TiPARP-FLAG (5 μg) or pmaxGFP (5 μg) was diluted with distilled H2O to 87.6 μl. After adding 12 μl of 2 m CaCl2, 100 μl of 2× Hepes-buffered saline were added dropwise while vortexing. The transfection solution was incubated for 1 min at room temperature, vortexed again, and added dropwise to wells containing the HEK293 cells. After 6 h, medium was removed, replaced with fresh medium, and incubated overnight. For IP of ADP-ribosylated proteins, CEH lysates were precleared by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C with protein A-agarose beads to avoid nonspecific binding during the immunoprecipitation step. The agarose beads were removed by centrifugation, and lysates were incubated with 5 μg of an anti-PAR (polyADP-ribose) antibody (Trevigen, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) or normal rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling) overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Protein A-agarose beads previously washed 3 times with Cell Lysis Buffer and incubated overnight with 1 mg/ml BSA were added to the samples for 2 h at 4 °C. The samples were then centrifuged. The beads were washed 5 times with Cell Lysis buffer (5 min per wash). After the last wash, 2× sample buffer (see below) was added. Samples were boiled for 5 min and stored at −80 °C before SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blotting. For IP of PEPCK, anti-PEPCK IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), normal goat IgG (Santa Cruz), protein A/G-agarose beads, and washes with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Sigma) were used. For CE, livers were homogenized in 2× sample buffer (125 mm TRIS-HCl, 4% SDS, 16% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.002% bromphenol blue) and boiled for 5 min. For primary CEH, rat hepatocytes, and cell lines, cells were scraped in 2× sample buffer, or lysates were prepared in Cell L"

Here we show that beginning at 2 months of age, when mice first acquire the ability to discriminate between closely related contexts, RAS-GRF1 begins to contribute to the induction of long term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 hippocampus by mediating the action of calcium-permeable, AMPA-type glutamate receptors (CP-AMPARs). Surprisingly, LTP induction by CP-AMPARs through RAS-GRF1 occurs via activation of p38 MAP kinase rather than ERK MAP kinase, which has more frequently been linked to LTP. Moreover, contextual discrimination is blocked by knockdown of Ras-Grf1 expression specifically in the CA1 hippocampus, infusion of a p38 MAP kinase inhibitor into the CA1 hippocampus, or the injection of an inhibitor of CP-AMPARs.

https://openalex.org/W2091005907,"Recognition and elimination of malignant cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes depends on antigenic peptides generated by proteasomes. It has been established that impairment of the immunoproteasome subunits, that is, PSMB8, PSMB9 and PSMB10 (PSMBs), is critical for malignant cells to escape immune recognition. We report here the regulatory mechanism of the repression of PU.1-dependent activation of PSMBs by PML/RARα in the pathogenesis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and the unidentified function of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) as an immunomodulator in the treatment of APL. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays showed that PU.1 directly bound to and coordinately transactivated the promoters of PSMBs, indicating that PSMBs were transcriptional targets of PU.1 and PU.1 regulated their basal expression. Analysis of expression profiling data from a large population of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients revealed that the expression levels of PSMBs were significantly lower in APL patients than in non-APL AML patients. Further evidence demonstrated that the decrease in their expression was achieved through PML/RARα-mediated repression of both PU.1-dependent transactivation and PU.1 expression. Moreover, ATRA but not arsenic trioxide induced the expression of PSMBs in APL cells, indicating that ATRA treatment might activate the antigen-processing/presentation machinery. Finally, the above observations were confirmed in primary APL samples. Collectively, our data demonstrate that PML/RARα suppresses PU.1-dependent activation of the immunosubunits, which may facilitate the escape of APL cells from immune surveillance in leukemia development, and ATRA treatment is able to reactivate their expression, which would promote more efficient T-cell-mediated recognition in the treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1996738870,"The API2-MALT1 fusion oncoprotein is created by the recurrent t(11;18)(q21;q21) chromosomal translocation in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. We identified receptor interacting protein-1 (RIP1) as a novel API2–MALT1-associated protein, and demonstrate that RIP1 is required for API2–MALT1 to stimulate canonical nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). API2–MALT1 promotes ubiquitination of RIP1 at lysine (K) 377, which is necessary for full NF-κB activation. Furthermore, we found that TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) recruitment is required for API2–MALT1 to induce RIP1 ubiquitination, NF-κB activation and cellular transformation. Although both TRAF2 and RIP1 interact with the API2 moiety of API2–MALT1, this moiety alone is insufficient to induce RIP1 ubiquitination or activate NF-κB, indicating that API2–MALT1-dependent RIP1 ubiquitination represents a gain of function requiring the concerted actions of both the API2 and MALT1 moieties of the fusion. Intriguingly, constitutive RIP1 ubiquitination was recently demonstrated in several solid tumors, and now our study implicates RIP1 ubiquitination as a critical component of API2–MALT1-dependent lymphomagenesis."

As demonstrated some years ago, the adenylate cyclase ESAG-4 is also targeted to the flagellar membrane in Trypanosoma brucei (14.Paindavoine P. Rolin S. Van Assel S. Geuskens M. Jauniaux J.C. Dinsart C. Huet G. Pays E. A gene from the variant surface glycoprotein expression site encodes one of several transmembrane adenylate cyclases located on the flagellum of Trypanosoma brucei.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1218-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Additionally, the aquaglyceroporin channel of Leishmania major (LmjAQP1) is specifically targeted to the flagellar membrane where it is involved in detection of extracellular osmotic gradients and osmotaxis (15.Figarella K. Uzcategui N.L. Zhou Y. LeFurgey A. Ouellette M. Bhattacharjee H. Mukhopadhyay R. Biochemical characterization of Leishmania major aquaglyceroporin LmAQP1.

Furthermore, the L. mexicana glucose transporter LmxGT1 is also selectively localized to the flagellar membrane where it may act as a glucose sensor (16.Burchmore R.J. Rodriguez-Contreras D. McBride K. Merkel P. Barrett M.P. Modi G. Sacks D. Landfear S.M. Genetic characterization of glucose transporter function in Leishmania mexicana.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Both sequence and context are important for flagellar targeting of a glucose transporter.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125: 3293-3298Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The cis-acting flagellar targeting signal of LmxGT1 has been described previously (17.Tran K.D. Rodriguez-Contreras D. Shinde U. Landfear S.M. Both sequence and context are important for flagellar targeting of a glucose transporter.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125: 3293-3298Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Three critical residues within the N-terminal hydrophilic domain, Asn95-Pro96-Met97, are required for efficient flagellar targeting of this permease. However, comparative analysis of the LmxGT1 targeting motif with other known ciliary targeting signals (18.Pazour G.J. Bloodgood R.A. Targeting proteins to the ciliary membrane.Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2008; 85: 115-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 19.Nachury M.V. Seeley E.S. Jin H. Trafficking to the ciliary membrane. How to get across the periciliary diffusion barrier?.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2010; 26: 59-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) has not identified a similar motif among other eukaryotes, supporting the possibility that novel flagellar targeting machinery may exist in these ancient protozoa. Thus, identification of proteins that interact with the flagellar targeting domain of LmxGT1 and are critical for flagellar trafficking may reveal new flagellar targeting components. Here we report the identification of a protein, designated KHARON1 (KH1), 4The abbreviations used are: KH1, KHARON1; HBH, hexa-histidine-biotinylation motif-hexa-histidine tandem affinity tag; HA3 or 3HA, 3X hemagluttinin epitope tag; FM, flagellar membrane; FP, flagellar pocket; PPM, pellicular plasma membrane; TAP, tandem affinity purification. which recognizes the flagellar targeting domain of LmxGT1 and is required for efficient targeting of this permease to the flagellar membrane. A combination of immunolocalization, subcellular fractionation, and ultrastructural studies of tagged KH1 revealed that it is associated with the proximal region of the flagellar axoneme located adjacent to the flagellar pocket of Leishmania promastigotes. Remarkably, KH1 also appears to be important for the viability of the disease causing amastigote stage of the parasite within phagolysosomal vesicles of mammalian host macrophages, raising the possibility that KH1 may be critical for Leishmania pathogenesis. Furthermore, these studies underscore the likely role of the “residual” flagellum of the intracellular amastigote in critical interactions with the host macrophage. KH1 is the first protein identified in kinetoplastid protozoa that functions to selectively target an integral membrane protein to the flagellar compartment. Further characterization of KH1 function may help elucidate novel aspects of flagellar targeting pathways and pathogenesis in kinetoplastid parasites. Wild type Leishmania mexicana promastigotes were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Thermo Scientific Hyclone, Logan, UT), 0.1 mm xanthine, and 5 μg/ml of hemin. Parasite lines carrying episomal expression vectors were cultured in the same medium with 100 μg/ml of G418 (Invitrogen), 80 μg/ml of hygromycin B (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA). Δlmxkh1 (Δkh1) null mutants were maintained in RPMI and RPMI supplemented with 50 μg/ml of puromycin and 50 μg/ml of phleomycin (InvivoGen). All cultures were maintained at 26 °C. Leishmania promastigotes were transfected according to previously described electroporation techniques using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser Xcell (16.Burchmore R.J. Rodriguez-Contreras D. McBride K. Merkel P.

Subsequently, the open reading frame of LmxGT1 was amplified and cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites to generate the LmxGT1::HBH gene fusion. The LmxGT1(Δ84–100)::HBH fusion protein was created in the same manner using template DNA from the previously generated (17.Tran K.D. Rodriguez-Contreras D. Shinde U. Landfear S.M.

All primer sequences are available upon request. DNA constructs were sequenced at the OHSU sequencing core to verify for accuracy. L. mexicana promastigotes were grown to a density of ∼5 × 106 cells/ml. Approximately 1 × 109 cells were used per sample for experiments employing whole cells, and twice as many were used for experiments using membrane preparations. Cells were collected, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4), and resuspended in PBS. For cross-linking with 1% formaldehyde (Ultra Pure EM grade, Polysciences, Warrington, PA), cells were incubated at 25 °C for 10 min followed by another 5 min after the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 125 mm (to stop the cross-linking reaction). PBS was added in place of formaldehyde for non-cross-linked control samples. Cells were washed once with PBS, then resuspended in 1 ml of Buffer 1 (8 m urea, 300 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaH2PO4, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0) on ice. Samples were sonicated on ice at maximum amplitude for 3 × 15 s with 1 min between pulses. For samples where membrane preparations were required, cells were collected, washed, and resuspended in membrane preparation buffer (0.1 m KH2PO4, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol) containing Complete Mini protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Samples were sonicated as described above and cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were transferred into Beckman Polyallomer tubes and centrifuged at 124,000 × g using a TLA-45 rotor for 2 h at 4 °C. Membrane pellets were resuspended in Buffer 1. The cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Cleared supernatants were incubated with 750 μl of HisPurTM Cobalt Resin (Thermo Scientific Pierce, Rockford, IL) on a rocker for 45 min at room temperature. The resins were washed with 5 × 1 ml of Buffer 1 (5 min each), 5 × 1 ml of Buffer 1 at pH 6.4 (5 min each), and 5 × 1 ml of Buffer 1 pH 6.4 with 10 mm imidazole (5 min each). Protein complexes were eluted with 1 ml of Buffer 2 (Elution buffer: 45 mm NaH2PO4, 8 m urea, 270 mm NaCl, 150 mm imidazole). The eluates were incubated with 400 μl of Pierce® High Capacity Streptavidin-agarose Resin (Thermo Scientific Pierce) on a rocker for 16 h at 4 °C. Streptavidin columns were washed with 5 × 1 ml of Buffer 3 (8 m urea, 200 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0) containing 0.2% SDS (5 min each), 5 × 1 ml of Buffer 3 with 2.0% SDS (5 min each), 5 × 1 ml of Buffer 3 with no SDS (5 min each), 2 × 1 ml of Buffer A (200 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.0), and 2 × 1 ml of Tris, pH 8.0. Samples were stored in 500 μl of Tris, pH 8.0, at 4 °C. The beads were suspended in 500 μl of 100 mm Tris buffer, pelleted by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 5 min, resuspended in 100 μl of ammonium bicarbonate buffer, and 1 μg of trypsin (Sigma) was added. After incubation overnight at 37 °C with shaking, the sample containing the suspended beads, digested proteins, and an additional 100 μl wash of water were transferred to 0.45-μm spin filters (Millipore, Burlington, MA) and beads were removed by brief centrifugation. The filtrate was dried by vacuum centrifugation, dissolved in 40 μl of 5% formic acid, and peptides identified by LC-MS/MS analysis. After trypsin digestion, the proteins present in the cross-linked and non-cross-link control fractions were identified by MS/MS by the Oregon Health & Science University Proteomics Shared Resource. Tryptic peptides were injected into a trap cartridge in 0.1% formic acid, placed inline with a Zorbax SB-C18 column, and separated using a 2–30% acetonitrile gradient. Eluted peptides were analyzed using a LTQ Velos linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) and identified by comparing MS/MS spectra to theoretical fragmentation spectra of peptides generated from the L. mexicana protein database using Sequest software (version 27, Thermo Scientific). Subsequently, the relative levels of specific proteins in the cross-linked and non-cross-linked samples were estimated by “spectral counting,” the quantification of the relative number of spectral counts obtained for peptides in each sample. For comparison of the two samples, the spectral counts of the HBH tag present in both samples were employed for normalization. Putative LmxGT1 binding partners were identified as proteins with high peptide counts in the cross-linked sample and zero counts in the non-cross-linked samples when using wild type LmxGT1::HBH bait protein, and not identified in experiments where the LmxGT1(Δ84–100)::HBH mutant was used. The LmxM36.5850 (Kharon1) open reading frame (ORF) was genetically removed by two rounds of homologous recombination. Sequences surrounding the Kharon1 ORF were cloned using the following primers containing SfiI sites (underlined) compatible with a previously described method to rapidly generate knock-out constructs (23.Fulwiler A.L. Soysa D.R. Ullman B. Yates P.A. A rapid, efficient and economical method for generating leishmanial gene targeting constructs.Mol. Biochem.

Mutant clones were isolated based on the ability of transformants to grow on agar plates containing puromycin (50 μg/ml) and phleomycin (50 μg/ml) and analyzed by Southern blots to verify the absence of the Kharon1 coding region. Two independent clones were analyzed and both showed similar LmxGT1::GFP targeting defects. A rescue construct containing the Kharon1 ORF was cloned into the KpnI and EcoRV sites of a modified pX72-Hyg vector (24.Nasser M.I. Landfear S.M. Sequences required for the flagellar targeting of an integral membrane protein.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 135: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Primer sequences are available upon request. All constructs were verified by sequencing at the Oregon Health & Science University DNA Sequencing Core. The LmxGT1 ORF was amplified with primers that contained a SmaI site for the forward primer and an XbaI site for the reverse primer. The amplified product was then subcloned into a modified pX63NEO-3HA expression vector (D. Rodriguez-Contreras), encoding an in-frame HA3 tag downstream of SmaI and XbaI restriction sites, to generate an ORF encoding LmxGT1::HA3. DNA constructs were sequenced at the Oregon Health & Science University sequencing core. To isolate L. mexicana promastigote flagella, ∼4 × 109 cells were washed and resuspended in Buffer S1 (25 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.32 m sucrose, pH 7.4) with HaltTM Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Thermo Scientific Pierce). Cells were sonicated with 3 pulses lasting for 1 s at 25% amplitude with 1-min rest between pulses using a Sonic Dismembrator 505 (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Detachment of flagella was monitored using phase-contrast microscopy. Cell bodies were separated from flagella by centrifugation at 700 × g for 15 min. Flagella were pelleted at 6,800 × g for 20 min, resuspended in Buffer S2 (25 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, protease inhibitor), and layered on top of a 0.8 m sucrose cushion (in Buffer S2). After centrifugation at 1,080 × g for 20 min, the top layer was removed and layered on top of a discontinuous sucrose gradient (1.65 and 1.85 m) in Buffer S2. The samples were centrifuged at 133,000 × g for 3 h at 4 °C. The flagellar fraction at the interface between the two sucrose layers was collected, pelleted at 143,000 × g for 45 min, and resuspended in Buffer S1. A small fraction of collected flagella was used for protein quantification using a Bio-Rad DCTM Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad). The equivalent of 5 μg of protein were loaded into each lane in the experiments shown in Fig. 3D. A 3xFLAG::3xHA (referred to as HA3 throughout the text for all HA-tagged proteins) tag was amplified from a previously described vector (25.Tran K.D. Miller M.R. Doe C.Q. Recombineering Hunchback identifies two conserved domains required to maintain neuroblast competence and specify early-born neuronal identity.Development. 2010; 137: 1421-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and cloned into the SmaI (N terminus tag) or BglII (C terminus tag) site of the modified pX72-Hyg vector as described above. The KH1::HA3-tagged protein was generated by cloning the Kh1 ORF into the KpnI and EcoRV sites of the vector describe above. HA3::KH1 was made in a similar manner with the exception that the reverse primer contains a stop codon (TAG) and the vector for N terminus tag was used. All other 3xFLAG::3xHA-tagged proteins described in this article were tagged on the C terminus. The LmxMIT::GFP fusion protein was generated by cloning the LmxMIT ORF into the BamHI and EcoRV sites of pXG-′GFP+ (26.Ha D.S. Schwarz J.K. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Use of the green fluorescent protein as a marker in transfected Leishmania.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The LmjAQP1 ORF was amplified using previously described primers (27.Gourbal B. Sonuc N. Bhattacharjee H. Legare D. Sundar S. Ouellette M. Rosen B.P. Mukhopadhyay R.

All primer sequences are available upon request. To monitor the localization of KH1 expressed at near endogenous levels, the Kh1 ORF was tagged at its C terminus with HA3, the Thosea asigna virus 2A (TaV2A) peptide, Renilla luciferase (Luc), and the blasticidin resistance (BSD) protein, in that order, and then flanked by sequences immediately upstream and downstream of the Kh1 ORF in the L. mexicana genome. The linearized construct was transfected into wild type L. mexicana promastigotes, and transgenic parasites containing the integrated transgene replacing one Kh1 allele were selected on agar containing 80 μg/ml of blasticidin. Because the TaV2A peptide induces a co-translational intra-ribosomal cleavage during synthesis of the fusion protein (28.Heras S.R. Thomas M.C. García-Canadas M. de Felipe P. García-Pérez J.L. Ryan M.D. López M.C. L1Tc non-LTR retrotransposons from Trypanosoma cruzi contain a functional viral-like self-cleaving 2A sequence in-frame with the active proteins they encode.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 1449-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the KH1::HA3::TaV2A fusion protein (without the attached Luc::BSD fusion protein) is expressed in all transgenic parasites from one allele of the endogenous Kh1 gene locus encompassing the correct 5′ and 3′ flanking sequences. The KH1::HA3::TaV2A fusion protein was detected with anti-HA and anti-TaV2A antiserum described below. The development of this methodology will be described elsewhere. 5P. Yates, manuscript in preparation. For immunofluorescence, parasites were collected, washed once with PBS, and attached to poly-l-lysine-treated coverslips for 20 min.

For FM4-64 labeling, parasites were collected and washed once with cold PBS. Cells were incubated on ice with FM4-64FX (Molecular Probes) at 5 μg/ml for 2 min. After labeling, cells were pelleted in a microcentrifuge at 5,000 × g for 15 s and washed once with cold PBS. Cells were incubated at 26 °C in serum-free RPMI for a chase period of 5 min, washed once with cold PBS, and then fixed with 4% ultra-pure formaldehyde and attached to poly-l-lysine-treated coverslips for 30 min at room temperature. After fixation, parasites were washed 3 × 5 min with PBS, and incubated in 5% normal goat serum in PBS containing 0.01% saponin. Primary and secondary antibody incubations were also performed in PBS containing 0.01% saponin. For immunoblotting, promastigotes at early-mid log density were collected and washed with PBS. Cells were lysed in 1× lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer (Invitrogen) containing 5 mm DTT and loaded onto 4–12% polyacrylamide gels for electrophoresis (Invitrogen). Proteins were then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, blocked with 3% BSA or 5% milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, and probed with primary antibodies in blocking solution. Primary antibodies were used as described above. Anti-mouse and anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were used at 1:20,000 (Thermo Scientific Pierce) with 5% milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. For the experiment in Fig. 5F, cells were pelleted and washed in Buffer S (25 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.32 m sucrose, pH 7.4) with Halt Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Thermo Scientific Pierce). Cells were sonicated in Buffer S using 5 pulses of 5 s each at maximum amplitude, and checked for cell breakage by phase-contrast microscopy. Pellet and supernatant were separated by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Detergent extractions were performed using PBS buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and Halt Protease Inhibitor Mixture for 30 min at 25 °C. Insoluble and soluble fractions were separated by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. For all experiments, the same proportion of each fraction was used in SDS-gel electrophoresis. L. mexicana promastigote cytoskeletons were obtained by extraction with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min at 25 °C, pelleted, and washed once in PBS.

https://openalex.org/W2088197634,"Deregulation of Shp2, a non-receptor tyrosine phosphatase, causes hyperactivation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), leading to growth abnormality. Here, we show that inhibition of RhoA-Dia is sufficient to upregulate ERK activation in epithelial cells. Oncogenic Shp2 expression attenuates RhoA-Dia signaling, by which microtubule (MT) is destabilized with reduced level of acetylation. Either MT stabilization, silencing of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) or enforcing RhoA-Dia signal prevents oncogenic Shp2-induced ERK hyperactivation. We provide evidence that downregulation of RhoA-Dia-EB1 pathway by oncogenic Shp2 leads to HDAC6-mediated reduction in MT acetylation, in turn affecting ERK regulation. In response to serum stimulation, cells expressing wild-type Shp2 display transient ERK activation. In contrast, cells expressing oncogenic Shp2 have prolonged ERK activation. HDAC6 inhibition diminishes sustained activation of ERK and slows down the growth of these cells. Likewise, in human cancer cells, blocking Shp2 increases MT acetylation and decreases ERK phosphorylation, which are reversed by inhibition of Dia. As such, HDAC6 inhibition in these cells also reduces ERK activity. Our findings link MT regulation by HDAC6 to oncogenic Shp2 and ERK regulation, implicating the therapeutic potential of HDAC6 inhibitor in diseases involving Shp2 deregulation."
https://openalex.org/W2083598610,"Arylamine N-acetyltransferases (NATs), a class of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes, catalyze the acetylation of aromatic amine compounds through a strictly conserved Cys-His-Asp catalytic triad. Each residue is essential for catalysis in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic NATs. Indeed, in (HUMAN)NAT2 variants, mutation of the Asp residue to Asn, Gln, or Glu dramatically impairs enzyme activity. However, a putative atypical NAT harboring a catalytic triad Glu residue was recently identified in Bacillus cereus ((BACCR)NAT3) but has not yet been characterized. We report here the crystal structure and functional characterization of this atypical NAT. The overall fold of (BACCR)NAT3 and the geometry of its Cys-His-Glu catalytic triad are similar to those present in functional NATs. Importantly, the enzyme was found to be active and to acetylate prototypic arylamine NAT substrates. In contrast to (HUMAN) NAT2, the presence of a Glu or Asp in the triad of (BACCR)NAT3 did not significantly affect enzyme structure or function. Computational analysis identified differences in residue packing and steric constraints in the active site of (BACCR)NAT3 that allow it to accommodate a Cys-His-Glu triad. These findings overturn the conventional view, demonstrating that the catalytic triad of this family of acetyltransferases is plastic. Moreover, they highlight the need for further study of the evolutionary history of NATs and the functional significance of the predominant Cys-His-Asp triad in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic forms."
https://openalex.org/W1972726807,"Group II activators of G-protein signaling play diverse functional roles through their interaction with Gαi, Gαt, and Gαo via a G-protein regulatory (GPR) motif that serves as a docking site for Gα-GDP. We recently reported the regulation of the AGS3-Gαi signaling module by a cell surface, seven-transmembrane receptor. Upon receptor activation, AGS3 reversibly dissociates from the cell cortex, suggesting that it may function as a signal transducer with downstream signaling implications, and this question is addressed in the current report. In HEK-293 and COS-7 cells expressing the α2A/D-AR and Gαi3, receptor activation resulted in the translocation of endogenous AGS3 and AGS3-GFP from the cell cortex to a juxtanuclear region, where it co-localized with markers of the Golgi apparatus (GA). The agonist-induced translocation of AGS3 was reversed by the α2-AR antagonist rauwolscine. The TPR domain of AGS3 was required for agonist-induced translocation of AGS3 from the cell cortex to the GA, and the translocation was blocked by pertussis toxin pretreatment or by the phospholipase Cβ inhibitor U73122. Agonist-induced translocation of AGS3 to the GA altered the functional organization and protein sorting at the trans-Golgi network. The regulated movement of AGS3 between the cell cortex and the GA offers unexpected mechanisms for modulating protein secretion and/or endosome recycling events at the trans-Golgi network."
https://openalex.org/W1983752059,"Integrin expression and activity are altered in tumors, and aberrant integrin signaling promotes malignancy. However, how integrins become altered in tumors remains poorly understood. We discovered that oncogenic activation of MEK signaling induces cell growth and survival, and promotes the malignant phenotype of mammary epithelial cells (MECs) by increasing α5 integrin expression. We determined that MEK activates c-Myc to reduce the transcription of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling enzyme Brahma (BRM). Our studies revealed that reduced BRM expression and/or activity drives the malignant behavior of MECs by epigenetically promoting C/EBPβ expression to directly induce α5 integrin transcription. Consistently, we could show that restoring BRM levels normalized the malignant behavior of transformed MECs in culture and in vivo by preventing C/EBPβ-dependent α5 integrin transcription. Our findings identify a novel mechanism whereby oncogenic signaling promotes malignant transformation by regulating transcription of a key chromatin remodeling molecule that regulates integrin-dependent stromal-epithelial interactions."

A loss-of-function variant of zebrafish Abcc4 was identified with a single amino acid substitution in the cytoplasmic loop T804M. Because this substituted amino acid is highly conserved among ABCC4 orthologs and is located in cytoplasmic loop 3 (CL3), we investigated the impact of this mutation on human and zebrafish Abcc4 expression. We demonstrate that zebrafish Abcc4 T804M or human ABCC4 T796M exhibit substantially reduced expression, coupled with impaired plasma membrane localization. To understand the molecular basis for the localization defect, we developed a homology model of zebrafish Abcc4. The homology model suggested that the bulky methionine substitution disrupted side-chain contacts. Molecular dynamic simulations of a fragment of human or zebrafish CL3 containing a methionine substitution indicated altered helicity coupled with reduced thermal stability. Trifluoroethanol challenge coupled with circular dichroism revealed that the methionine substitution disrupted the ability of this fragment of CL3 to readily form an α-helix. Furthermore, expression and plasma membrane localization of these mutant ABCC4/Abcc4 proteins are mostly rescued by growing cells at subphysiological temperatures. Because the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (ABCC7) is closely related to ABCC4, we extended this by engineering certain pathogenic CFTR-CL3 mutations, and we showed they destabilized human and zebrafish ABCC4. Altogether, our studies provide the first evidence for a conserved domain in CL3 of ABCC4 that is crucial in ensuring its proper plasma membrane localization."
