https://openalex.org/W2140880926,"The Internet has recently made possible the free global availability of scientific journal articles. Open Access (OA) can occur either via OA scientific journals, or via authors posting manuscripts of articles published in subscription journals in open web repositories. So far there have been few systematic studies showing how big the extent of OA is, in particular studies covering all fields of science.The proportion of peer reviewed scholarly journal articles, which are available openly in full text on the web, was studied using a random sample of 1837 titles and a web search engine. Of articles published in 2008, 8.5% were freely available at the publishers' sites. For an additional 11.9% free manuscript versions could be found using search engines, making the overall OA percentage 20.4%. Chemistry (13%) had the lowest overall share of OA, Earth Sciences (33%) the highest. In medicine, biochemistry and chemistry publishing in OA journals was more common. In all other fields author-posted manuscript copies dominated the picture.The results show that OA already has a significant positive impact on the availability of the scientific journal literature and that there are big differences between scientific disciplines in the uptake. Due to the lack of awareness of OA-publishing among scientists in most fields outside physics, the results should be of general interest to all scholars. The results should also interest academic publishers, who need to take into account OA in their business strategies and copyright policies, as well as research funders, who like the NIH are starting to require OA availability of results from research projects they fund. The method and search tools developed also offer a good basis for more in-depth studies as well as longitudinal studies."
https://openalex.org/W2028524298,"Background Protective respiratory face masks protect the nose and mouth of the wearer from vapor drops carrying viruses or other infectious pathogens. However, incorrect use and disposal may actually increase the risk of pathogen transmission, rather than reduce it, especially when masks are used by non-professionals such as the lay public. Copper oxide displays potent antiviral properties. A platform technology has been developed that permanently introduces copper oxide into polymeric materials, conferring them with potent biocidal properties. Methodology/Principal Findings We demonstrate that impregnation of copper oxide into respiratory protective face masks endows them with potent biocidal properties in addition to their inherent filtration properties. Both control and copper oxide impregnated masks filtered above 99.85% of aerosolized viruses when challenged with 5.66±0.51 and 6.17±0.37 log10TCID50 of human influenza A virus (H1N1) and avian influenza virus (H9N2), respectively, under simulated breathing conditions (28.3 L/min). Importantly, no infectious human influenza A viral titers were recovered from the copper oxide containing masks within 30 minutes (≤0.88 log10TCID50), while 4.67±1.35 log10TCID50 were recovered from the control masks. Similarly, the infectious avian influenza titers recovered from the copper oxide containing masks were ≤0.97±0.01 log10TCID50 and from the control masks 5.03±0.54 log10TCID50. The copper oxide containing masks successfully passed Bacterial Filtration Efficacy, Differential Pressure, Latex Particle Challenge, and Resistance to Penetration by Synthetic Blood tests designed to test the filtration properties of face masks in accordance with the European EN 14683:2005 and NIOSH N95 standards. Conclusions/Significance Impregnation of copper oxide into respiratory protective face masks endows them with potent anti-influenza biocidal properties without altering their physical barrier properties. The use of biocidal masks may significantly reduce the risk of hand or environmental contamination, and thereby subsequent infection, due to improper handling and disposal of the masks."

https://openalex.org/W1965249701,"The packaging of newly replicated and repaired DNA into chromatin is crucial for the maintenance of genomic integrity. Acetylation of histone H3 core domain lysine 56 (H3K56ac) has been shown to play a crucial role in compaction of DNA into chromatin following replication and repair in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, the occurrence and function of such acetylation has not been reported in mammals. Here we show that H3K56 is acetylated and that this modification is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner in mammalian cells. We also demonstrate that the histone acetyltransferase p300 acetylates H3K56 in vitro and in vivo, whereas hSIRT2 and hSIRT3 deacetylate H3K56ac in vivo. Further we show that following DNA damage H3K56 acetylation levels increased, and acetylated H3K56, which is localized at the sites of DNA repair. It also colocalized with other proteins involved in DNA damage signaling pathways such as phospho-ATM, CHK2, and p53. Interestingly, analysis of occurrence of H3K56 acetylation using ChIP-on-chip revealed its genome-wide spread, affecting genes involved in several pathways that are implicated in tumorigenesis such as cell cycle, DNA damage response, DNA repair, and apoptosis."

The normal function of αS is thought to be linked to the ability of the protein to bind to the surface of synaptic vesicles. Upon binding to vesicles, αS undergoes a structural reorganization from a dynamic and disordered ensemble to a conformation consisting of a long extended helix. In the presence of small spheroidal detergent micelles, however, this extended helix conformation can convert into a broken helix state, in which a region near the middle of the helix unwinds to form a linker between the two resulting separated helices. Membrane-bound conformations of αS likely mediate the function of the protein, but may also play a role in the aggregation and toxicity of the protein. Here we have undertaken a study of the effects of the three known PD-linked mutations on the detergent- and membrane-bound conformations of αS, as well as factors that govern the transition of the protein between the extended helix and broken helix states. Using pulsed dipolar ESR measurements of distances up to 8.7 nm, we show that all three PD-linked αS mutants retain the ability to transition from the broken helix to the extended helix conformation. In addition, we find that the ratio of protein to detergent, rather than just the absolute detergent concentration, determines whether the protein adopts the broken or extended helix conformation. α-Synuclein (αS) is linked to Parkinson disease through its deposition in an amyloid fibril form within Lewy Body deposits, and by the existence of three αS point mutations that lead to early onset autosomal dominant Parkinsonism.

IntroductionSince its initial discovery as a protein enriched in the electric organ of the Pacific electric ray, Torpedo californica (1Maroteaux L. Campanelli J.T. Scheller R.H. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 2804-2815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the protein α-synuclein has been progressively associated with a role in neurodegeneration in humans, starting with its identification as the precursor protein of a non-amyloid-β peptide component of amyloid plaques (the so-called NAC peptide) (2Uéda K. Fukushima H. Masliah E. Xia Y. Iwai A. Yoshimoto M. Otero D.A. Kondo J. Ihara Y. Saitoh T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 11282-11286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar) and culminating in its discovery as the first gene product to be linked to familial Parkinson disease (3Polymeropoulos M.H. Higgins J.J. Golbe L.I. Johnson W.G. Ide S.E. Di Iorio G. Sanges G. Stenroos E.S. Pho L.T. Schaffer A.A. Lazzarini A.M. Nussbaum R.L. Duvoisin R.C. Science. 1996; 274: 1197-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar) and its contemporaneous identification as the primary component of the fibrillary aggregates found in the hallmark Lewy body deposits associated with Parkinson (4Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Goedert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 839-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (5964) Google Scholar).Subsequently, a great deal of effort has been made to clarify and understand the mechanisms by which αS causes neuronal degeneration, as well as to understand the normal functional roles of αS and how these are related to its role in disease (5Tofaris G.K. Spillantini M.G. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2007; 64: 2194-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 6Waxman E.A. Giasson B.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1792: 616-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Although aggregation of αS remains a key focus in these efforts, it remains possible that other, or additional, effects beyond the presence of various aggregated species of αS may be involved in the etiology of synuclein-associated PD. A key piece of the puzzle that remains unanswered is which of the various forms of αS that have been observed in vitro are involved in mediating the toxicity of the protein in vivo. In particular, although αS is highly disordered when isolated in solution in vitro (7Weinreb P.H. Zhen W. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar, 8Eliezer D. Kutluay E. Bussell Jr., R. Browne G. J. Mol.

Sci. 2009; 10: 483-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) it is not clear to what extent this intrinsically disordered state is populated in vivo. Because αS has been shown to interact with lipid membranes and synaptic vesicles in situ (10George J.M. Jin H. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F.

Thus, membrane-bound conformations of the protein may provide clues regarding both the normal and pathological pathways in which αS participates.Early spectroscopic studies of membrane-bound αS revealed a highly helical structure (14Davidson W.S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 34393-34398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). More detailed studies using membrane-mimetic spheroidal detergent micelles showed that this structure could take the form of two individual helices, separated by a non-helical linker (17Bussell Jr., R. Eliezer D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 763-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 18Chandra S. Chen X. Rizo J. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. J. Biol.

Nussbaum R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9595-9603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Subsequent ESR studies confirmed this broken helix structure by explicitly measuring distances between the two helices (20Borbat P. Ramlall T.F. Freed J.H. Eliezer D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 10004-10005Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). More recent ESR work also demonstrated that when αS is bound to lipid vesicles, lipid bicelles, or rod-like detergent micelles, the protein can take the form of a single extended helix, based on direct measurement of the ensuing long (4–7.5 nm) distances (21Georgieva E.R. Ramlall T.F. Borbat P.P. Freed J.H. Eliezer D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008; 130: 12856-12857Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and also on modeling using shorter (2–4 nm) measured distances (22Jao C.C. Hegde B.G. Chen J. Haworth I.S. Langen R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 19666-19671Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). This result was further confirmed by recent fluorescence-based measurements (23Ferreon A.C. Gambin Y. Lemke E.A. Deniz A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 5645-5650Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 24Trexler A. Rhoades E. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 2304-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In addition, it was observed that the protein can apparently interchange between the broken helix and extended helix conformations (21Georgieva E.R. Ramlall T.F. Borbat P.P. Freed J.H. Eliezer D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008; 130: 12856-12857Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 23Ferreon A.C. Gambin Y. Lemke E.A. Deniz A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 5645-5650Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar).Here we have undertaken studies of the effects of PD-linked mutations on the membrane- and detergent-bound conformations of αS, as well as of the factors that govern the interconversion of the protein between the broken helix and extended helix conformations. We find evidence that αS fluctuates between compact and extended conformations when the protein is free in solution, in the absence of membrane or detergent. We also confirm previous reports that in the presence of detergent, the conformation selected by αS is dependent on the detergent concentration (23Ferreon A.C. Gambin Y. Lemke E.A. Deniz A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 5645-5650Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 25Ferreon A.C. Deniz A.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 4499-4509Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, the detergent concentration alone does not always dictate whether the extended or broken helix structure will form. Instead, the protein-to-detergent ratio is also a determinant of which structure is observed. This suggests that whereas the membrane environment exerts an influence on the conformation of the protein, the protein in turn can affect the membrane structure. Finally, we find that the PD-linked αS mutations remain capable of adopting both the broken helix and extended helix forms of the protein. The implications of these observations are discussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and PurificationDouble cysteine mutants of wild type (WT), and Parkinson disease (PD) 3The abbreviations used are: PDParkinson diseaseDMPG1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol), sodium saltDMPC1,2-dimyritroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholineDHPC1,2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholineLPPGlyso-1-palmitoyl-phosphatidylglycerolMEMmaximum entropy method. mutants A30P, E46K, and A53T of αS were expressed, purified, and spin-labeled with MTSSL as described in the literature (8Eliezer D.

Fully deuterated SDS-d25 was purchased from Sigma. All compounds were used as received. Five different membrane mimetics were used: 1) spheroidal micelles at low concentration of SDS-d25 (from 5 to 60 mm); 2) lyso-1-palmitoyl-phosphatidylglycerol (LPPG) micelles with LPPG concentration of 40 and 80 mm; 3) rod-like micelles prepared at 450 mm SDS-d25; 4) DMPC/DMPG/DHPC bicelles with q (the ratio of long chain to short chain lipids) of 2.6 and [DMPC] to [DMPG] ratio of 8.75; and 5) liposomes composed of DMPC/DMPG in a 1:1 molar ratio. The LPPG micelles, rod-like SDS micelles, bicelles, and liposomes were prepared as described previously (20Borbat P. Ramlall T.F. Freed J.H. Eliezer D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 10004-10005Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 21Georgieva E.R. Ramlall T.F. Borbat P.P. Freed J.H. Eliezer D. J. Am. Chem.

Crepeau R.H. Freed J.H. J. Magn. Reson. 1997; 127: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 29Borbat P.P. Freed J.H. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 423: 52-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 30Upadhyay A.K. Borbat P.P. Wang J. Freed J.H. Edmondson D.E. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 1554-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) set to operate in 4-pulse DEER mode (21Georgieva E.R. Ramlall T.F. Borbat P.P. Freed J.H. Eliezer D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008; 130: 12856-12857Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 31Jeschke G. Koch A. Jonas U. Godt A. J. Magn. Reson. 2002; 155: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The π/2 and π pulses of the detection mode had widths of 16 and 32 ns. The pump pulse typically was set to 32 ns, but was 20 ns in some cases. The pump pulse was set at the central maximum of the nitroxide spectrum. The detection frequency was 70 MHz above the pumping frequency, corresponding to the low-field edge of the nitroxide spectrum. The spin-spin distances in some of the double mutants, in particular 24/83, were as large as 8.7 nm, necessitating the use of evolution times as long as 14 μs. For such long evolution times the spin echo amplitude decays by phase relaxation, leaving no detectable signal in spin-labeled proteins. To overcome this challenge, we used 70% deuterated proteins with spin labels at positions 24 and 72, and 24 and 83. In addition, DMPC-d67 and DMPG-d54 were used for liposome or bicelle preparations. By these means the phase relaxation was sufficiently suppressed, enabling evolution times as long as 14 μs (see supplemental materials). In cases of shorter distances, depending on the particular sample the signal averaging time varied from 2 to 10 h. The time domain signals for proteins, having spin labels at positions 24 and 72, and 24 and 83, were averaged over periods of nearly 30 h. The pulse repetition rate was 1 kHz in all measurements.Protein and Spin ConcentrationsProtein stock solutions were prepared by dissolving lyophilized protein in the appropriate buffer and concentrations were determined based on the mass and volume used. Samples for measurement were prepared through dilutions using the stock solutions. To assess the degree of spin labeling, we used a standard sample of 100 μm 4-hydroxy-TEMPO-free radical in D2O:Gly-d8 as a reference to estimate the spin concentration per total protein concentration, by quantitative comparison of initial spin-echo intensities. Spin labeling efficiency was estimated, and was typically found to be less than 100%. In particular we estimated relatively low spin labeling efficiency at positions 72 and 83. Importantly, the presence of unlabeled protein would not affect any of the results or conclusions presented here, which are based on total protein concentration.Data AnalysisThe distance analysis of experimental time domain data has been conducted using the L-curve Tikhonov regularization method (32Chiang Y.W. Borbat P.P. Freed J.H. J. Magn. Reson. 2005; 172: 279-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) to yield inter-spin distance distributions from which average distances and their variations were inferred. The distance distributions produced by the L-curve method were refined, as needed, by the maximum entropy method (MEM) (33Chiang Y.W. Borbat P.P. Freed J.H. J. Magn. Reson. 2005; 177: 184-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In some cases, to aid in the interpretation of these distance distributions we further analyzed them by fitting them with one or two Gaussians, using a MATLAB script developed in our laboratories (see supplemental data). In all cases the distance distributions (or their Gaussian representations) were characterized in terms of average distance, R, and their full width at half-maximum, abbreviated as ΔR. Distance distributions from more than 100 sets of data were obtained in this study.Sample Preparation for DEER MeasurementsProteins in Free StateWT αS and its PD-liked mutants with spin labels at positions 24/61, 24/72, and 24/83 were prepared in 1:1 D2O:glycerol-d8, pD 7.4. The protein concentration was 100 μm.Membrane-bound ProteinsWT αS and its PD-liked mutants with spin labels at positions 50/72, 24/61, 24/72, and 24/83 were prepared in solutions of spheroidal SDS or LPPG micelles, rod-like SDS micelles, DMPC/DMPG liposomes, and DMPC/DMPG/DHPC isotropic bicelles. The protein-micelle, proteoliposome, and protein-bicelle samples were prepared according to procedures described previously (20Borbat P. Ramlall T.F. Freed J.H. Eliezer D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 10004-10005Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 21Georgieva E.R. Ramlall T.F. Borbat P.P. Freed J.H. Eliezer D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008; 130: 12856-12857Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). For concentration-dependent measurements several batches of samples with a molar ratio of SDS to protein varying over the range of 150 to 2000 were prepared by either changing the protein or SDS concentration. For these measurements we used proteins with spin labels at sites 24/61 or 24/72. Protein concentrations span from 20 to 100 μm. SDS concentration was varied over the range of 5 to 60 mm.Doubly spin-labeled 24/61 mutants of all protein variants were prepared in LPPG micelles with protein/LPPG concentrations of 60 μm/40 mm, 60 μm/80 mm, and 120 μm/40 mm. Protein concentrations of 50 and 120 μm for all αS variants were employed in the case of bicelles. The bicelle solution contained 162 mm total phopholipid concentration.All samples for ESR spectroscopy measurements were made using D2O buffers at pD 7.4 (uncorrected pH meter reading) and 100 mm NaCl with the subsequent addition of 10% (weight) glycerol-d8 to bicelles samples and 30% (weight) to SDS and LPPG samples. As a control, we studied bicelle-bound WT αS with spin labels at positions 24/61 in both non-deuterated and deuterated phospholipids, and no differences were noted.To estimate the extent of protein crowding on the surface of liposomes, we considered that a freely rotating protein molecule requires a disc of surface area corresponding to that of a circle with a radius equal to the maximum dimension of the protein, which for αS is about 15 nm in the extended helix conformation. Given the average liposome radius of 30 nm, ∼4πrlipo2/πrsyn2 = 16 freely rotating αS molecules could coexist on the liposome surface.RESULTSInter-spin Distances in Free State (D2O:Glycerol-d8 Medium)To characterize the spatial extent of the highly disordered free state of αS, we used pulsed dipolar ESR spectroscopy employing the DEER pulse sequence to measure intramolecular distances between paramagnetic spin labels attached to selected residues in the WT protein and also of PD-associated mutants A30P, A53T, and E46K (Fig. 1). Three different doubly spin-labeled cysteine mutants of each protein variant were examined: 24/61, 24/72, and 24/83. One spin label was attached at position 24, located in the N-terminal domain of the protein, and a second spin label was attached to a site at the very beginning (position 61) or the middle part (positions 72 or 83) of the NAC domain. Fig. 2 illustrates the time domain data and extracted distance distributions for WT and mutant αS. For all doubly spin-labeled proteins we observed a broad distribution of distances between spin labels, which could be interpreted as a superposition of dipole-dipole interactions between spin labels in individual protein molecules sampling an ensemble of conformations. Theoretically there are several sources of spectral broadening in pulsed dipolar spectroscopy (34Borbat P.P. McHaourab H.S. Freed J.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 5304-5314Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), which include random mutual orientation of the spin labels, and a limited resolution due to the finite length of sampling interval also should be taken into account (29Borbat P.P. Freed J.H. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 423: 52-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 34Borbat P.P. McHaourab H.S. Freed J.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 5304-5314Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 35Borbat P.P. Freed J.H. EPR Newsletter. 2007; 17: 21-33Google Scholar). However, for the highly dynamic free state of αS, we consider protein flexibility to be the primary source for the observed signal broadening. Where appropriate, we further quantified the observed distance distributions by approximating the distance distributions obtained by Tikhonov regularization using sums of up to two Gaussians, as illustrated in Fig. 2. The values of inter-spin distances and the widths of the distributions, as obtained from the modeling, are summarized in Table 1.FIGURE 2Experimental time domain data (top) and corresponding distance distributions for WT αS and its PD-linked mutants for three spin-labeled variants 24/61 (curve 1 in top panels), 24/72 (curve 2 in top panels), and 24/83 (curve 3 in top panels). The figure shows the data from the measurements on 100 μm total protein concentration in 1:1 D2O:Gly-d8. The distances were reconstructed by the Tikhonov regularization method with an additional refinement made by using MEM, as appropriate.

Open table in a new tab Our results show a similar overall behavior among all αS variants in terms of the distance distributions measured between spin labels attached to the same positions in the polypeptide chains. Interestingly, for the 24/61 and 24/72 pairs of spin labels, we observed bimodal distance distributions in each case, which were resolved by the two Gaussians approximation to have maximally probable distances ranging, among the four αS variants, from 3.2 to 3.6 and 5.0 to 5.2 nm for 24/61 and 3.5 to 4.2 and 5.3 to 6.1 nm for 24/72. For the 24/83 pair of spin labels, we observed a single maximally probable distance for all variants ranging from 3.6 to 4.1 nm (Table 1).To better understand the structural properties of αS in solution, we considered polymer models previously employed in the analysis of protein structure (36Flory P.J.

For polypeptide chains obeying random-flight statistics (Gaussian chain), the expected average mean square distance between two points (putative end-to-end distance) is 〈R2〉 = nl2 + 2L2, where n is the number of chain segments (residues), l is the length of a segment (length of residue, generally taken to be 0.38 nm), and 2L2 is a term for two spin labels with a length of 0.8 nm. Straightforward calculations show that when spin labels are attached at positions 24/61, 24/72, and 24/83 in the proteins studied the expected values for spin-spin distances according to this model are 2.6, 2.9, and 3.1 nm, respectively. These calculated distances are somewhat smaller than the lower of the experimentally measured maximally probable distances (3.2–3.6, 3.5–4.2, and 3.6–4.1 nm for the 24/61-, 24/72-, and 24/83-labeled proteins, respectively, see Table 1), suggesting that this model does not describe adequately the structural properties of αS in solution, most likely as a result of some local stiffness of the polypeptide chain. We next applied a model that accounts for chain stiffness (see supplemental materials), which previously showed good agreement with NMR paramagnetic relaxation enhancement data in the highly charged C-terminal tail of αS (27Sung Y.H. Eliezer D. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 689-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), whereas at the same time indicating that the N-terminal lipid-binding domain of the protein was more compact than predicted. This model yields expected values for spin-spin distances of 6.6, 7.7, and 8.6 nm for the three different spin-probe pairs. These distances are higher than the shorter of our experimentally observed values (3.2–3.6, 3.5–4.2, and 3.6–4.1 nm for the 24/61, 24/72, and 24/83 labeled proteins, respectively) indicating, in agreement with the NMR paramagnetic relaxation enhancement data (27Sung Y.H. Eliezer D. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 689-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), that the lipid-binding domain samples conformations that are considerably more compact than the random coil model. The calculated distances are more similar to, but still slightly larger than, the longer distances observed in the experimental distance distribution (5.0–5.2 and 5.3–6.1 nm for 24/61- and 24/72-labeled proteins, no longer distance was observed for 24/83-labeled protein) suggesting that some fraction of the protein ensemble may sample conformations that are more consistent with those described by this statistical model. For the 24/83 pair, the calculated distance, 8.6 nm, is at the limit of our current measurement capability, which could explain why a long distance was not observed in the corresponding data.Inter-spin Distances in Membrane-bound αSProteins Bound to SDS and LPPG MicellesMicellar detergents have often been used as membrane mimetics capable of inducing native structure in membrane-binding proteins, despite their activity as protein denaturants (e.g. Refs. 39Jaroniec C.P.

https://openalex.org/W2045046849,"The S100B-p53 protein complex was discovered in C8146A malignant melanoma, but the consequences of this interaction required further study. When S100B expression was inhibited in C8146As by siRNA (siRNA(S100B)), wt p53 mRNA levels were unchanged, but p53 protein, phosphorylated p53, and p53 gene products (i.e. p21 and PIDD) were increased. siRNA(S100B) transfections also restored p53-dependent apoptosis in C8146As as judged by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, DNA ladder formation, caspase 3 and 8 activation, and aggregation of the Fas death receptor (+UV); whereas, siRNA(S100B) had no effect in SK-MEL-28 cells containing elevated S100B and inactive p53 (p53R145L mutant). siRNA(S100B)-mediated apoptosis was independent of the mitochondria, because no changes were observed in mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release, caspase 9 activation, or ratios of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins (BAX, Bcl-2, and Bcl-X(L)). As expected, cells lacking S100B (LOX-IM VI) were not affected by siRNA(S100B), and introduction of S100B reduced their UV-induced apoptosis activity by 7-fold, further demonstrating that S100B inhibits apoptosis activities in p53-containing cells. In other wild-type p53 cells (i.e. C8146A, UACC-2571, and UACC-62), S100B was found to contribute to cell survival after UV treatment, and for C8146As, the decrease in survival after siRNA(S100B) transfection (+UV) could be reversed by the p53 inhibitor, pifithrin-alpha. In summary, reducing S100B expression with siRNA was sufficient to activate p53, its transcriptional activation activities, and p53-dependent apoptosis pathway(s) in melanoma involving the Fas death receptor and perhaps PIDD. Thus, a well known marker for malignant melanoma, S100B, likely contributes to cancer progression by down-regulating the tumor suppressor protein, p53."
https://openalex.org/W2141026950,"Coenzyme Q (ubiquinone or Q) is a crucial mitochondrial lipid required for respiratory electron transport in eukaryotes. 4-Hydroxybenozoate (4HB) is an aromatic ring precursor that forms the benzoquinone ring of Q and is used extensively to examine Q biosynthesis. However, the direct precursor compounds and enzymatic steps for synthesis of 4HB in yeast are unknown. Here we show that para-aminobenzoic acid (pABA), a well known precursor of folate, also functions as a precursor for Q biosynthesis. A hexaprenylated form of pABA (prenyl-pABA) is normally present in wild-type yeast crude lipid extracts but is absent in yeast abz1 mutants starved for pABA. A stable 13C6-isotope of pABA (p- amino[aromatic-13C6]benzoic acid ([13C6]pABA)), is prenylated in either wild-type or abz1 mutant yeast to form prenyl-[13C6]pABA. We demonstrate by HPLC and mass spectrometry that yeast incubated with either [13C6]pABA or [13C6]4HB generate both 13C6-demethoxy-Q (DMQ), a late stage Q biosynthetic intermediate, as well as the final product 13C6-coenzyme Q. Pulse-labeling analyses show that formation of prenyl-pABA occurs within minutes and precedes the synthesis of Q. Yeast utilizing pABA as a ring precursor produce another nitrogen containing intermediate, 4-imino-DMQ6. This intermediate is produced in small quantities in wild-type yeast cultured in standard media and in abz1 mutants supplemented with pABA. We suggest a mechanism where Schiff base-mediated deimination forms DMQ6 quinone, thereby eliminating the nitrogen contributed by pABA. This scheme results in the convergence of the 4HB and pABA pathways in eukaryotic Q biosynthesis and has implications regarding the action of pABA-based antifolates."
https://openalex.org/W1990683510,"Autophagy is regulated for IFN-gamma-mediated antimicrobial efficacy; however, its molecular effects for IFN-gamma signaling are largely unknown. Here, we show that autophagy facilitates IFN-gamma-activated Jak2-STAT1. IFN-gamma induces autophagy in wild-type but not in autophagy protein 5 (Atg5(-/-))-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), and, autophagy-dependently, IFN-gamma induces IFN regulatory factor 1 and cellular inflammatory responses. Pharmacologically inhibiting autophagy using 3-methyladenine, a known inhibitor of class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, confirms these effects. Either Atg5(-/-) or Atg7(-/-) MEFs are, independent of changes in IFN-gamma receptor expression, resistant to IFN-gamma-activated Jak2-STAT1, which suggests that autophagy is important for IFN-gamma signal transduction. Lentivirus-based short hairpin RNA for Atg5 knockdown confirmed the importance of autophagy for IFN-gamma-activated STAT1. Without autophagy, reactive oxygen species increase and cause SHP2 (Src homology-2 domain-containing phosphatase 2)-regulated STAT1 inactivation. Inhibiting SHP2 reversed both cellular inflammation and the IFN-gamma-induced activation of STAT1 in Atg5(-/-) MEFs. Our study provides evidence that there is a link between autophagy and both IFN-gamma signaling and cellular inflammation and that autophagy, because it inhibits the expression of reactive oxygen species and SHP2, is pivotal for Jak2-STAT1 activation."
https://openalex.org/W2044244669,"Background Hybrid speciation is classified into homoploid and polyploid based on ploidy level. Common wheat is an allohexaploid species that originated from a naturally occurring interploidy cross between tetraploid wheat and diploid wild wheat Aegilops tauschii Coss. Aegilops tauschii provides wide naturally occurring genetic variation. Sometimes its triploid hybrids with tetraploid wheat show the following four types of hybrid growth abnormalities: types II and III hybrid necrosis, hybrid chlorosis, and severe growth abortion. The growth abnormalities in the triploid hybrids could act as postzygotic hybridization barriers to prevent formation of hexaploid wheat. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we report on the geographical and phylogenetic distribution of Ae. tauschii accessions inducing the hybrid growth abnormalities and showed that they are widely distributed across growth habitats in Ae. tauschii. Molecular and cytological characterization of the type III necrosis phenotype was performed. The hybrid abnormality causing accessions were widely distributed across growth habitats in Ae. tauschii. Transcriptome analysis showed that a number of defense-related genes such as pathogenesis-related genes were highly up-regulated in the type III necrosis lines. Transmission electron microscope observation revealed that cell death occurred accompanied by generation of reactive oxygen species in leaves undergoing type III necrosis. The reduction of photosynthetic activity occurred prior to the appearance of necrotic symptoms on the leaves exhibiting hybrid necrosis. Conclusions/Significance Taking these results together strongly suggests that an autoimmune response might be triggered by intergenomic incompatibility between the tetraploid wheat and Ae. tauschii genomes in type III necrosis, and that genetically programmed cell death could be regarded as a hypersensitive response-like cell death similar to that observed in Arabidopsis intraspecific and Nicotiana interspecific hybrids. Only Ae. tauschii accessions without such inhibiting factors could be candidates for the D-genome donor for the present hexaploid wheat."
https://openalex.org/W2061197367,"Despite progress in reducing ischemic stroke damage, complete protection remains elusive. Here we demonstrate that, after permanent occlusion of a major cortical artery (middle cerebral artery; MCA), single whisker stimulation can induce complete protection of the adult rat cortex, but only if administered within a critical time window. Animals that receive early treatment are histologically and behaviorally equivalent to healthy controls and have normal neuronal function. Protection of the cortex clearly requires reperfusion to the ischemic area despite permanent occlusion. Using blood flow imaging and other techniques we found evidence of reversed blood flow into MCA branches from an alternate arterial source via collateral vessels (inter-arterial connections), a potential mechanism for reperfusion. These findings suggest that the cortex is capable of extensive blood flow reorganization and more importantly that mild sensory stimulation can provide complete protection from impending stroke given early intervention. Such non-invasive, non-pharmacological intervention has clear translational potential."

Ascorbate peroxidase from Leishmania major (LmAPX) has been shown to be central to the redox defense system of Leishmania. To investigate further its exact physiological role in Leishmania, we attempted to create LmAPX -knockout mutants by gene replacement in L. major strains.The null mutant cell culture contains a higher percentage of metacyclic and apoptotic cells compared to both wild type and LmAPX overexpressing cells. Flowcytometric analysis reveals the presence of a higher concentration of intracellular H(2)O(2), indicative of increased oxidative stress in parasites lacking LmAPX. IC(50) value for exogenously added H(2)O(2) shows that deletion of LmAPX in L. major renders the cell more susceptible to H(2)O(2). Real time PCR studies demonstrate an elevated mRNA level of non-selenium glutathione peroxidase in LmAPX null mutant cell line, suggesting that these enzymes were induced to compensate the LmAPX enzyme. The null mutant cells exhibit hypervirulence after infection with macrophages as well as inoculation into BALB/c mice; in contrast, overexpressing cells show avirulence.Collectively, these data provide strong evidence that LmAPX is an important factor for controlling parasite differentiation and survival within macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2113977451,"Background Microbial communities in aquatic environments are spatially and temporally dynamic due to environmental fluctuations and varied external input sources. A large percentage of the urban watersheds in the United States are affected by fecal pollution, including human pathogens, thus warranting comprehensive monitoring. Methodology/Principal Findings Using a high-density microarray (PhyloChip), we examined water column bacterial community DNA extracted from two connecting urban watersheds, elucidating variable and stable bacterial subpopulations over a 3-day period and community composition profiles that were distinct to fecal and non-fecal sources. Two approaches were used for indication of fecal influence. The first approach utilized similarity of 503 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) common to all fecal samples analyzed in this study with the watershed samples as an index of fecal pollution. A majority of the 503 OTUs were found in the phyla Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria. The second approach incorporated relative richness of 4 bacterial classes (Bacilli, Bacteroidetes, Clostridia and α-proteobacteria) found to have the highest variance in fecal and non-fecal samples. The ratio of these 4 classes (BBC∶A) from the watershed samples demonstrated a trend where bacterial communities from gut and sewage sources had higher ratios than from sources not impacted by fecal material. This trend was also observed in the 124 bacterial communities from previously published and unpublished sequencing or PhyloChip- analyzed studies. Conclusions/Significance This study provided a detailed characterization of bacterial community variability during dry weather across a 3-day period in two urban watersheds. The comparative analysis of watershed community composition resulted in alternative community-based indicators that could be useful for assessing ecosystem health."
https://openalex.org/W2020726762,"Hematopoiesis is the process by which hemocytes mature and subsequently enter the circulation. Vertebrate prokineticins (PKs) are known to take part in this process, as are the invertebrate prokineticin domain proteins, astakines. In <i>Pacifastacus leniusculus</i>, astakine 1 is essential for the release of new hemocytes into the open circulatory system of these animals. In addition to astakine 1, we have now cloned a homologue of astakine 1 with an insert of 13 amino acids, named as astakine 2. Both crustacean astakines lack the N-terminal AVIT motif, which is present in vertebrate PKs, and hence receptor binding differs from that of vertebrate PKs. We have found astakine-like sequences in 19 different invertebrate species, and the sequences show that some motifs are conserved among invertebrate groups. Previously we showed that astakine 1 is directly involved in hematopoiesis, and now we show that astakine 1 and astakine 2 have different roles in hemocyte lineage differentiation. Astakine 1 can stimulate proliferation of hematopoietic tissue (Hpt) cells (precursor of hemocytes) as well as specifically induce differentiation of Hpt cells along the semigranular cell lineage, whereas astakine 2 plays a role in granular cell differentiation. Moreover, we discuss the impact of the putative structures of different astakines in comparison with the vertebrate prokineticins."

Bacteriol. 1969; 98: 519-527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in the adherence of S. aureus to nasal epithelial cells (20Weidenmaier C. Kokai-Kun J.F. Kristian S.A. Chanturiya T. Kalbacher H. Gross M. Nicholson G. Neumeister B. Mond J.J. Peschel A. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 243-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Several reports have demonstrated that MBL bound to S. aureus induces activation of the complement pathway (15Neth O. Jack D.L. Dodds A.W. Holzel H. Klein N.J. Turner M.W. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 688-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 16Shi L. Takahashi K. Dundee J. Shahroor-Karni S. Thiel S. Jensenius J.C. Gad F. Hamblin M.R. Sastry K.N. Ezekowitz R.A. J. Exp.

We have reported that human MBL binds to S. aureus PG and activates the lectin pathway (21Ma Y.G. Cho M.Y. Zhao M. Park J.W. Matsushita M. Fujita T. Lee B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25307-25312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and two other studies have demonstrated MBL binding to S. aureus LTA (22Polotsky V.Y. Fischer W.

Med. 2008; 205: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). S. aureus LTA was also reported to be a ligand of l-ficolin to activate the lectin complement pathway (14Lynch N.J. Roscher S. Hartung T. Morath S. Matsushita M. Maennel D.N. Kuraya M. Fujita T. Schwaeble W.J. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 1198-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Bacterial glycopolymers may also be important antigens to activate the classical complement pathway and adaptive immunity and can be desirable vaccination targets (18Weidenmaier C. Peschel A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). For example, LTA-specific monoclonal antibodies have yielded promising results as a passive vaccine for severe S. aureus infections (24Weisman L.E. Arch. Pediatr. 2007; 14: S31-S34Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Also, anti-capsular polysaccharide 5 and 8 antibodies of S. aureus are on the clinical trial now (25Fattom A.I. Horwith G. Fuller S. Propst M. Naso R. Vaccine. 2004; 22: 880-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In this report, we investigated S. aureus cell wall component mutants including WTA- or LTA-deficient strains, which have recently become available (20Weidenmaier C. Kokai-Kun J.F. Kristian S.A.

Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 2521-2530Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) to determine the ligand in the complement system. We demonstrate that S. aureus WTA functions as a natural ligand of human MBL and induces MBL-mediated C4 deposition on the bacterium in vitro. Additionally, MBL-WTA interaction enhances the opsonophagocytosis of S. aureus by human neutrophils. Unexpectedly, serum MBL of adults cannot recognize WTA because of competition by WTA-specific antibodies. In contrast, serum MBL of infants whose adaptive immunity is immature does bind WTA. Infants who have low levels of both MBL and anti-WTA-antibodies have weak ability to activate the complement system. These results indicate that S. aureus WTA is an important pathogen-associated molecular pattern for the complement activation. The native human MBL/MASP complex and human l-ficolin were purified from human sera as described (4Matsushita M. Fujita T. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1497-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 27Matsushita M. Endo Y. Taira S. Sato Y. Fujita T. Ichikawa N. Nakata M. Mizuochi T. J. Biol.

Recombinant human MBL was expressed in a CHO cell line and chromatographically purified as described (28Kang H.J. Lee S.M. Lee H.H. Kim J.Y. Lee B.C. Yum J.S. Moon H.M. Lee B.L.

MBL-deficient serum was obtained from a person homozygous for the codon54 mutation of the MBL gene, and C1q-deficient sera were obtained from Calbiochem/EMD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). Infant sera were obtained from the clinical laboratory, and adult sera were obtained from healthy volunteers with informed consent. S. aureus cell surface component mutants were derivatives of RN4220 and are listed in Table 1.

T258 and T358 strains were constructed via phage transduction using phage80 (31Oku Y. Kurokawa K. Matsuo M. Yamada S. Lee B.L. Sekimizu K. J.

Kim J.H. Je B.R. Roh K.B. Kim S.J. Lee H.H. Ryu J.H. Lim J.H. Oh B.H. Lee W.J. Ha N.C. Lee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 6602-6607Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, WTA-attached insoluble PG was obtained from the S. aureus T002 strain, a PG O-acetyltransferase-deficient oatA mutant, which is sensitive to lysozyme (33Bera A. Herbert S. Jakob A. Vollmer W. Götz F. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 778-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). WTA-free PG was obtained from a WTA-deficient S. aureus ΔtagO mutant. To purify WTA, insoluble WTA-attached PG (20 mg) was incubated with lysostaphin (0.17 mg, Sigma-Aldrich) in 1 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0) for 6 h at 37 °C and then with lysozyme (1 mg, Bioshop) for 18 h at 37 °C. The digested materials were boiled for 10 min, passed through a 0.45-μm membrane filter, and 1/10 amounts were then loaded onto a HiTrap-Q column (1 ml) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed, followed by elution with a 20-ml gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl in buffer A. Fractions (1 ml) were collected and assayed for inorganic phosphate (34Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and PAGE was performed with silver staining to detect WTA. The pooled WTA fraction (8 mg from 20 mg of PG) was precipitated with acetone and dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.5) and used for further experiments. Fully grown S. aureus cells (2.0 × 109 cells) were fixed with 70% ethanol, washed, incubated with 1 μg of recombinant MBL (rMBL) or l-ficolin in 500 μl of buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl containing 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm CaCl2, and 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4) at 4 °C for 2 h. Bacterial cells were recovered by centrifugation, washed, and treated with 500 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 containing 10 mm EDTA. The supernatant and eluted proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and analyzed with 12% SDS-PAGE. IgG-binding protein A-deficient S. aureus Δspa mutant (M0107) and its derivates were used. Ethanol-fixed S. aureus cells (1.0 × 109 cells) were incubated with MBL/MASP (1 μg) in 500 μl of buffer C (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 1% BSA, and 0.05% Tween 20) for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing with washing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 1 mm CaCl2), C4 (800 ng, Complement Tech.) was incubated with S. aureus cells in 150 μl of buffer C for 1 h at 37 °C. Alternatively, fixed S. aureus cells were incubated with 2–20% human serum with in buffer C (500 μl) for 1 h at 37 °C. To detect bound C4b, mouse anti-human C4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (Bioporto, Denmark, diluted 1:500) and goat F(ab′)2 anti-mouse IgG antibodies conjugated with fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate (FITC) (Beckman Coulter, diluted 1:200) were used. To detect bound MBL, mouse anti-human MBL mAb (Dobeel, Korea, diluted 1:1,000) was used. Then, S. aureus cells were sonicated for 30 s to make cells single to perform flow cytometry analysis (Beckman Coulter). MBL binding to purified WTA and resulting C4 deposition were evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, 23), with some modifications. Briefly, 5 μg of each ligand in 50 μl of PBS (pH 7.5) were applied to F96 Cert. maxisorp immuno plates (duplicate, Nunc) and absorbed overnight at room temperature. Wells were washed with washing buffer and blocked with 200 μl of a buffer D (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the wells were incubated with 100 ng of MBL or MBL/MASP in 50 μl of buffer C for 2 h at 4 °C. When the C4 deposition was determined, wells were washed and incubated with C4 (100 ng) in 50 μl of buffer C for 1 h at 37 °C. Alternatively, immobilized ligands were incubated with 6% human serum (3 μl) in 50 μl of buffer C. Primary antibodies for MBL and C4b were used for flow cytometry analyses with a dilution of 1:1,000 and 1:3,000, respectively. Secondary antibodies were goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Beckman Coulter, 1:10,000 dilution). The resulting plates were developed with the substrate, 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) in the dark and stopped with 2 n H2SO4. Absorbance at 450 nm was recorded using a microplate reader (Thermo Scientific). To monitor the inhibition of MBL binding to WTA by total IgGs, or anti-WTA-IgGs, the tested materials, and rMBL were mixed and used for ELISA. Also, to examine the inhibitory effects of MBL binding to WTA by mannan, mannose, or EDTA, we prepared the mixture of MBL (10 ng) with mannan (0.5 and 5 μg), mannose (final concentration 10 and 100 mm) or EDTA (10 and 100 mm), and then the mixtures were added to the WTA-coated microplate wells. The binding ability of MBL to WTA was estimated as the same method as described above. Data were representative of at least three independent experiments. Levels of anti-WTA-IgGs in human serum were determined by ELISA. WTA (5 μg)-coated microplates were incubated with 0.1 μl of human serum in 50 μl of buffer E (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 1% BSA for 2 h at 4 °C, and bound IgGs were detected with mouse monoclonal anti-human-IgG antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich) and Goat F(ab′)2 anti-mouse IgG (H+L) antibodies conjugated with HRP (Human Ads). The concentration was estimated compared with that of control, purified anti-WTA-IgGs. Anti-WTA-IgGs were affinity-purified as described (32Park J.W. Kim C.H. Kim J.H. Je B.R. Roh K.B. Kim S.J. Lee H.H. Ryu J.H. Lim J.H. Oh B.H. Lee W.J. Ha N.C. Lee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 6602-6607Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μg of purified WTA or WTA-free PG in 5 μl of PBS was spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (10 × 3 mm, Whatman, pore 0.45 μm), and baked at 100 °C for 1 h. The membranes were washed with buffer E and blocked with buffer D for 1 h at room temperature. Twenty sheets of membrane were prepared for each sample and were incubated with 250 mg of commercially available human intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG, SK Chemicals, Seoul) in 25 ml of buffer E for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing with buffer E, bound IgGs were eluted with 1 ml of 0.1 m glycine (pH 2.8) and immediately neutralized with 1 n KOH to pH 7.5. The peripheral blood neutrophils were isolated from healthy young donors using a method involving dextran sedimentation and differential centrifugation through a Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient as described our previous method (35Jo E.J. Lee H.Y. Lee Y.N. Kim J.I. Kang H.K. Park D.W. Baek S.H. Kwak J.Y. Bae Y.S. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 6433-6439Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The donors were confirmed not to have taken any anti-inflammatory drugs for at least 3 weeks before sampling. Informed consent was obtained from all participants and the local institutional review board at Dong-A University Hospital approved the study. The contaminating monocytes were deficient using anti-CD14 Ab-coated magnetic beads (Milteny Biotec Inc., Auburn, CA). The detection of CD14+ cells in the separated neutrophils was less than 0.1% in flow cytometry analysis using FITC-conjugated anti-CD14 Ab. The neutrophils were shown to be 98% pure by CD66b staining. The neutrophils (1 × 107/1 ml) were labeled by PKH67 Green Fluorescent Cell Linker kit (Sigma-Aldrich) and rMBL- or MBL/MASP-treated S. aureus (1 × 108/1 ml) cells were labeled with PKH26 Red Fluorescent Cell Linker kit (Sigma-Aldrich). The cells were washed three times using PBS. The PKH67-labeled neutrophils (1 × 105/100 μl) were cultured with or without PKH26-labeled wild type or mutant S. aureus (1 × 106/100 μl) cells for 1 h in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 1% glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in the presence or absence of 5% FBS at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The percentage of PKH26-staining cells in total neutrophils was analyzed using flow cytometry. Neutrophils were shown to be 99% viable by Trypan Blue exclusion and 98–99% pure by staining with Giemsa. We have previously reported that human MBL binds to S. aureus PG and activates the PG-dependent lectin complement pathway (21Ma Y.G. Cho M.Y. Zhao M. Park J.W. Matsushita M. Fujita T. Lee B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25307-25312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Retrospectively, the commercially available PG in our previous study is suspected to have other bacterial components, including WTA, LTA, and lipoproteins. PG, WTA, and LTA are major glycopolymers containing N-GlcNAc on S. aureus cell surface (see supplemental Fig. S1 for structures of PG and WTA). The recent availability of several S. aureus cell wall component-deficient mutants has prompted us to re-examine which molecule(s) of the S. aureus cell envelope is recognized by human MBL. In this experiment, we used seven S. aureus mutant strains, such as the WTA-deficient ΔtagO mutant (20Weidenmaier C. Kokai-Kun J.F. Kristian S.A. Chanturiya T. Kalbacher H. Gross M. Nicholson G.

Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3506-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), the IgG-binding protein A-deficient Δspa mutant (31Oku Y. Kurokawa K. Matsuo M. Yamada S. Lee B.L. Sekimizu K. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and a parental S. aureus RN4220 strain (40Novick R.P. Ross H.F. Projan S.J. Kornblum J. Kreiswirth B. Moghazeh S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3967-3975Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). After incubation with human rMBL and S. aureus mutants, bacteria were precipitated, and the MBL bound to bacteria was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 1a, only WTA-deficient ΔtagO mutant cannot bind to MBL (lane 3) and the ΔtagO mutant introduced by a plasmid harboring tagO gene (ΔtagO/pStagO) restored the binding ability to MBL (lane 4). Under the same conditions, human l-ficolin, another serum protein involved in the lectin complement pathway, did not bind any of these S. aureus mutants (data not shown). Requirement of the S. aureus tagO gene for MBL binding to S. aureus cells was also observed in the S. aureus MW2 strain background (41Baba T. Takeuchi F. Kuroda M. Yuzawa H. Aoki K. Oguchi A. Nagai Y. Iwama N. Asano K. Naimi T. Kuroda H. Cui L. Yamamoto K. Hiramatsu K. Lancet. 2002; 359: 1819-1827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar) (data not shown). To further examine whether the tagO-dependent MBL binding to S. aureus cells is functional for complement activation or not, we determined the induction of MBL/MASP complex-mediated C4 deposition on the S. aureus cell surface by flow cytometry analysis. To avoid the nonspecific binding by S. aureus protein-A with primary and secondary IgG antibody, we used S. aureus protein-A-deficient Δspa mutant as a parental strain. As expected, ΔtagO mutant did not show C4 deposition, whereas the parental strain and ΔtagO mutant harboring pStagO clearly induced C4 deposition (Fig. 1b). Taken together, these results demonstrate that a requirement of the S. aureus tagO gene for MBL/MASP activation, suggesting that S. aureus WTA is a ligand for the MBL/MASP complex. To investigate whether the tagO-dependent MBL binding to S. aureus cells functions as an opsonin, parental or WTA-deficient ΔtagO mutant cells were incubated with rMBL or MBL/MASP complex, and were examined for neutrophilic phagocytosis (Fig. 1c). When neutrophilic phagocytosis was determined after 1 h of incubation, rMBL (500 ng) and MBL/MASP complex (2 μg) increased the phagocytosis of S. aureus parental cells by 37.3 and 50.5%, respectively, while there was no or only little increase for ΔtagO mutants (0% by MBL and 7.5% by MBL/MASP complex, respectively) (flow cytometry data are shown in supplemental Fig. S2). These results suggest that the binding of the rMBL or MBL/MASP complex to S. aureus WTA enhances neutrophilic opsonophagocytosis. The logical next experiment was to purify WTA from S. aureus parental cells to confirm that WTA is a MBL ligand. S. aureus WTA is known to be covalently bound to the N- MurNAc residue of the PG layer. Therefore, we took the following purification scheme: First we purified insoluble PG from S. aureus and then treated it with two well-known PG-degrading enzymes: lysozyme and lysostaphin. This purification method yielded soluble WTA harboring N-GlcNAc-N-MurNAc disaccharide with l-Ala-d-isoGln-l-Lys-d-Ala tetrapeptide (named purified WTA) as shown in supplemental Fig. S1. As expected, WTA was o"

Indeed, mutations of Pax6 are associated with diabetic phenotype. Importantly, homozygous mutant mice for Pax6 are characterized by markedly decreased β and δ cells and absent α cells. To better understand the critical role that Pax6 exerts in glucagon-producing cells, we developed a model of primary rat α cells. To study the transcriptional network of Pax6 in adult and differentiated α cells, we generated Pax6-deficient primary rat α cells and glucagon-producing cells, using either specific siRNA or cells expressing constitutively a dominant-negative form of Pax6. In primary rat α cells, we confirm that Pax6 controls the transcription of the Proglucagon and processing enzyme PC2 genes and identify three new target genes coding for MafB, cMaf, and NeuroD1/Beta2, which are all critical for Glucagon gene transcription and α cell differentiation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Pax6 directly binds and activates the promoter region of the three genes through specific binding sites and that constitutive expression of a dominant-negative form of Pax6 in glucagon-producing cells (InR1G9) inhibits the activities of the promoters. Finally our results suggest that the critical role of Pax6 action on α cell differentiation is independent of those of Arx and Foxa2, two transcription factors that are necessary for α cell development. We conclude that Pax6 is critical for α cell function and differentiation through the transcriptional control of key genes involved in glucagon gene transcription, proglucagon processing, and α cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2060789791,"Background In periaqueductal grey (PAG) matter, cross-talk between the Mu-opioid receptor (MOR) and the glutamate N-methyl-D-Aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-CaMKII pathway supports the development of analgesic tolerance to morphine. In neurons, histidine triad nucleotide binding protein 1 (HINT1) connects the regulators of G protein signaling RGSZ1 and RGSZ2 to the C terminus of the MOR. In response to morphine, this HINT1-RGSZ complex binds PKCγ, and afterwards, the interplay between PKCγ, Src and Gz/Gi proteins leads to sustained potentiation of NMDAR-mediated glutamate responses. Methodology/Principal Findings Following an intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of 10 nmol morphine, Akt was recruited to the synaptosomal membrane and activated by Thr308 and Ser473 phosphorylation. The Akt activation was immediately transferred to neural Nitric Oxide Synthase (nNOS) Ser1417. Afterwards, nitric oxide (NO)-released zinc ions recruited PKCγ to the MOR to promote the Src-mediated phosphorylation of the Tyr1325 NMDAR2A subunit. This action increased NMDAR calcium flux and CaMKII was activated in a calcium-calmodulin dependent manner. CaMKII then acted on nNOS Ser847 to produce a sustained reduction in NO levels. The activation of the Akt-nNOS pathway was also reduced by the binding of these proteins to the MOR-HINT1 complex where they remained inactive. Tolerance to acute morphine developed as a result of phosphorylation of MOR cytosolic residues, uncoupling from the regulated G proteins which are transferred to RGSZ2 proteins. The diminished effect of morphine was prevented by LNNA, an inhibitor of nNOS function, and naltrindole, a delta-opioid receptor antagonist that also inhibits Akt. Conclusions/Significance Analysis of the regulatory phosphorylation of the proteins included in the study indicated that morphine produces a transient activation of the Akt/PKB-nNOS pathway. This activation occurs upstream of PKCγ and Src mediated potentiation of NMDAR activity, ultimately leading to morphine tolerance. In summary, the Akt-nNOS pathway acts as a primer for morphine-triggered events which leads to the sustained potentiation of the NMDAR-CaMKII pathway and MOR inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1964402407,"Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) inhibits tissue factor-induced coagulation, but may, via its C terminus, also modulate cell surface, heparin, and lipopolysaccharide interactions as well as participate in growth inhibition. Here we show that C-terminal TFPI peptide sequences are antimicrobial against the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, gram-positive Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, as well as the fungi Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis. Fluorescence studies of peptide-treated bacteria, paired with analysis of peptide effects on liposomes, showed that the peptides exerted membrane-breaking effects similar to those seen for the ""classic"" human antimicrobial peptide LL-37. The killing of E. coli, but not P. aeruginosa, by the C-terminal peptide GGLIKTKRKRKKQRVKIAYEEIFVKNM (GGL27), was enhanced in human plasma and largely abolished in heat-inactivated plasma, a phenomenon linked to generation of antimicrobial C3a and activation of the classic pathway of complement activation. Furthermore, GGL27 displayed anti-endotoxic effects in vitro and in vivo in a mouse model of LPS shock. Importantly, TFPI was found to be expressed in the basal layers of normal epidermis, and was markedly up-regulated in acute skin wounds as well as wound edges of chronic leg ulcers. Furthermore, C-terminal fragments of TFPI were associated with bacteria present in human chronic leg ulcers. These findings suggest a new role for TFPI in cutaneous defense against infections."
https://openalex.org/W2032779307,"We discovered novel catalytic activities of two atypical NADPH-dependent oxidoreductases (EhNO1/2) from the enteric protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica. EhNO1/2 were previously annotated as the small subunit of glutamate synthase (glutamine:2-oxoglutarate amidotransferase) based on similarity to authentic bacterial homologs. As E. histolytica lacks the large subunit of glutamate synthase, EhNO1/2 were presumed to play an unknown role other than glutamine/glutamate conversion. Transcriptomic and quantitative reverse PCR analyses revealed that supplementation or deprivation of extracellular L-cysteine caused dramatic up- or down-regulation, respectively, of EhNO2, but not EhNO1 expression. Biochemical analysis showed that these FAD- and 2[4Fe-4S]-containing enzymes do not act as glutamate synthases, a conclusion which was supported by phylogenetic analyses. Rather, they catalyze the NADPH-dependent reduction of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide and L-cystine to L-cysteine and also function as ferric and ferredoxin-NADP(+) reductases. EhNO1/2 showed notable differences in substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency; EhNO1 had lower K(m) and higher k(cat)/K(m) values for ferric ion and ferredoxin than EhNO2, whereas EhNO2 preferred L-cystine as a substrate. In accordance with these properties, only EhNO1 was observed to physically interact with intrinsic ferredoxin. Interestingly, EhNO1/2 also reduced metronidazole, and E. histolytica transformants overexpressing either of these proteins were more sensitive to metronidazole, suggesting that EhNO1/2 are targets of this anti-amebic drug. To date, this is the first report to demonstrate that small subunit-like proteins of glutamate synthase could play an important role in redox maintenance, L-cysteine/L-cystine homeostasis, iron reduction, and the activation of metronidazole."
https://openalex.org/W2032811319,"Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is a common stress sensor, and its rapid induction by cellular stresses (e.g. DNA damage) is crucial for cells to mount appropriate responses (e.g. activating the tumor suppressor p53) and maintain homeostasis. Although emerging evidence suggests that dysregulation of ATF3 contributes to occurrences of human diseases including cancer, the mechanism(s) by which ATF3 expression is regulated is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) is a bona fide E3 ubiquitin ligase for ATF3 and regulates ATF3 expression by promoting its degradation. MDM2 via its C-terminal RING finger can bind to the Basic region of ATF3 and mediate the addition of ubiquitin moieties to the ATF3 leucine zipper domain. As a consequence, ATF3, but not a mutant deficient in MDM2 binding (Delta80-100), is degraded by MDM2-mediated proteolysis. Consistent with these results, ablation of MDM2 in cells not only increases basal ATF3 levels, but results in stabilization of ATF3 in late stages of DNA damage responses. Because ATF3 was recently identified as a p53 activator, these results suggest that MDM2 could inactivate p53 through an additional feedback mechanism involving ATF3. Therefore, we provide the first evidence demonstrating that ATF3 is regulated by a posttranslational mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2133174299,"In NCX proteins CBD1 and CBD2 domains are connected through a short linker (3 or 4 amino acids) forming a regulatory tandem (CBD12). Only three of the six CBD12 Ca(2+)-binding sites contribute to NCX regulation. Two of them are located on CBD1 (K(d) = approximately 0.2 microM), and one is on CBD2 (K(d) = approximately 5 microM). Here we analyze how the intrinsic properties of individual regulatory sites are affected by linker-dependent interactions in CBD12 (AD splice variant). The three sites of CBD12 and CBD1 + CBD2 have comparable K(d) values but differ dramatically in their Ca(2+) dissociation kinetics. CBD12 exhibits multiphasic kinetics for the dissociation of three Ca(2+) ions (k(r) = 280 s(-1), k(f) = 7 s(-1), and k(s) = 0.4 s(-1)), whereas the dissociation of two Ca(2+) ions from CBD1 (k(f) = 16 s(-1)) and one Ca(2+) ion from CBD2 (k(r) = 125 s(-1)) is monophasic. Insertion of seven alanines into the linker (CBD12-7Ala) abolishes slow dissociation of Ca(2+), whereas the kinetic and equilibrium properties of three Ca(2+) sites of CBD12-7Ala and CBD1 + CBD2 are similar. Therefore, the linker-dependent interactions in CBD12 decelerate the Ca(2+) on/off kinetics at a specific CBD1 site by 50-80-fold, thereby representing Ca(2+) ""occlusion"" at CBD12. Notably, the kinetic and equilibrium properties of the remaining two sites of CBD12 are ""linker-independent,"" so their intrinsic properties are preserved in CBD12. In conclusion, the dynamic properties of three sites are specifically modified, conserved, diversified, and integrated by the linker in CBD12, thereby generating a wide range dynamic sensor."
https://openalex.org/W1981494299,"In trypanosomatids, all mRNAs are processed via trans-splicing, although cis-splicing also occurs. In trans-splicing, a common small exon, the spliced leader (SL), which is derived from a small SL RNA species, is added to all mRNAs.

In this study, SmD3- and Lsm3-associated complexes were purified to homogeneity from Leishmania tarentolae.

IntroductionPre-mRNA processing is mediated by the spliceosome, which is assembled in a stepwise manner on pre-mRNA (1Brow D.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2002; 36: 333-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Although pre-mRNA splicing is mediated by RNA, the splicing factors not only play key roles in the formation of the spliceosome but may even directly participate in catalysis (2Abelson J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 1235-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).The human spliceosome contains 45 distinct snRNP 3The abbreviations used are: snRNPsmall nuclear ribonucleoproteinSLspliced leaderCFPcyan fluorescent proteinntnucleotidePTPProtC-TEV protease site-ProtAsnoRNAsmall nucleolar RNAPAPpoly(A) polymeraseDICdifferential interference contrast. -associated proteins, and up to 300 distinct proteins co-purify with the complex (3Rappsilber J. Ryder U. Lamond A.I. Mann M. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 1231-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). However, only 170 of these proteins were identified as part of active spliceosomes (4Makarov E.M. Makarova O.V. Urlaub H. Gentzel M. Will C.L. Wilm M. Lührmann R. Science. 2002; 298: 2205-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar).In contrast to the mammalian and yeast systems, little is known about trypanosome snRNP proteins. In trypanosomes, all mRNAs are processed by trans-splicing. trans-Splicing is mediated by ligating a common spliced leader (SL) to all mRNAs from a small RNA donor, the SL RNA (5Liang X.H. Haritan A. Uliel S. Michaeli S. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 830-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Trypanosomes possess all the U snRNPs, but only U2, U4, U5, and U6 were suggested to function in trans-splicing (5Liang X.H. Haritan A. Uliel S. Michaeli S. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 830-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 6Tschudi C. Ullu E. Cell. 1990; 61: 459-466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). U1 snRNP exists in trypanosomes, most probably for mediating the splicing of cis-spliced introns, but its role in trans-splicing has not been investigated (7Mair G. Shi H. Li H. Djikeng A. Aviles H.O. Bishop J.R. Falcone F.H. Gavrilescu C. Montgomery J.L. Santori M.I. Stern L.S. Wang Z. Ullu E. Tschudi C. RNA. 2000; 6: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 8Palfi Z. Schimanski B. Günzl A. Lücke S. Bindereif A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 2493-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Over the past few years, progress has been made in describing a variety of trypanosome splicing factors, and their function was elucidated by down-regulation via RNAi. Among these factors are Sm proteins, Lsm proteins, and SSm proteins (9Mandelboim M. Barth S. Biton M. Liang X.H. Michaeli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51469-51478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 10Zeiner G.M. Hitchcock R.A. Sturm N.R. Campbell D.A. Mol. Cell.

RNA. 2007; 13: 30-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). SSm proteins are specific Sm proteins that bind either U2 or U4 snRNP and substitute for the canonical Sm proteins (12Wang P. Palfi Z. Preusser C. Lücke S. Lane W.S. Kambach C. Bindereif A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4513-4523Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 13Tkacz I.D. Lustig Y. Stern M.Z. Biton M. Salmon-Divon M. Das A. Bellofatto V. Michaeli S. RNA. 2007; 13: 30-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Splicing defects such as an increase in the level of SL RNA and changes in the level of the Y structure intermediate were observed upon the depletion of the splicing factors, PRP31 and PRP43 (14Liang X.H. Liu Q. Liu L. Tschudi C. Michaeli S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2006; 145: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). More recently, U2AF35, U2AF65, and SF1, the factors that function to select the correct 3′ AG splice sites were identified, and their function in trans-splicing was elucidated (15Vazquez M.P. Mualem D. Bercovich N. Stern M.Z. Nyambega B. Barda O. Nasiga D. Gupta S.K. Michaeli S. Levin M.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2009; 164: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). An ∼45-S complex that carries all the U snRNPs, including U1 snRNP and SL RNP and the splicing intermediates, was identified, suggesting the existence of a single spliceosome complex that can potentially conduct both trans- and cis-splicing reactions(14Liang X.H. Liu Q. Liu L. Tschudi C. Michaeli S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2006; 145: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).SL RNA, the donor of the trans-spliced exon, has a very unique biogenesis. As opposed to U snRNAs, which are transcribed in trypanosomes by polymerase III (16Nakaar V. Dare A.O. Hong D. Ullu E. Tschudi C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6736-6742Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), the SL RNA is transcribed from a defined polymerase II promoter, and its transcription requires the tSNAP complex (17Gilinger G. Bellofatto V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1556-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 18Das A. Zhang Q. Palenchar J.B. Chatterjee B. Cross G.A. Bellofatto V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7314-7322Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Transcription of SL RNA takes place in a distinct nuclear site, near the nucleolus (19Dossin Fde M. Schenkman S. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 960-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This compartment was termed the “SL RNP factory” because Sm assembly and modification, such as the pseudouridylation by spliced leader-associated (SLA1) RNA, take place in this subdomain (13Tkacz I.D. Lustig Y. Stern M.Z. Biton M. Salmon-Divon M. Das A. Bellofatto V. Michaeli S. RNA. 2007; 13: 30-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 20Hury A. Goldshmidt H. Tkacz I.D. Michaeli S. Eukaryot. Cell. 2009; 8: 56-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).Two recent studies purified and analyzed Trypanosoma brucei snRNP proteins by mass spectrometry. The first study purified proteins associated with SmB (21Palfi Z. Jaé N. Preusser C. Kaminska K.H. Bujnicki J.M. Lee J.H. Günzl A. Kambach C. Urlaub H. Bindereif A. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 1650-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and led to the identification of 30 components of the trypanosome spliceosome. One protein, SMN (survival of motor neurons), was studied in detail. In metazoa, this protein, along with the proteins GEMIN2–8, serves as the scaffold for snRNP assembly in the cytoplasm (22Yong J. Wan L. Dreyfuss G. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 226-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The trypanosome SMN homologue is smaller, localized in the nucleus, and specifically and stably interacts with the SmD3/B subcomplex. In vitro experiments demonstrated that SMN is sufficient to confer specificity to Sm core assembly and to discriminate against binding of the canonical Sm core to nonspecific RNA species and to snRNAs with noncanonical Sm sites, such as U2 and U4 snRNAs (21Palfi Z. Jaé N. Preusser C. Kaminska K.H. Bujnicki J.M. Lee J.H. Günzl A. Kambach C. Urlaub H. Bindereif A. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 1650-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A homologue of GEMIN2 was also identified, but its exact role during Sm core assembly was not established (21Palfi Z. Jaé N. Preusser C. Kaminska K.H. Bujnicki J.M. Lee J.H. Günzl A. Kambach C. Urlaub H. Bindereif A. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 1650-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Purification of SmD1 complexes from T. brucei was also recently published. This study identified 47 spliceosome proteins, as well as 21 novel proteins lacking a specific annotation (23Luz Ambrósio D. Lee J.H. Panigrahi A.K. Nguyen T.N. Cicarelli R.M. Günzl A. Eukaryot. Cell. 2009; 8: 990-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Lsm proteins, unlike Sm proteins, are involved in nuclear processing and turnover of RNAs in eukaryotes. Lsm proteins form two distinct complexes, the Lsm2–8 complex, which binds U6 snRNA, and the Lsm1–7 complex, which governs mRNA degradation (24Salgado-Garrido J. Bragado-Nilsson E. Kandels-Lewis S. Séraphin B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3451-3462Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 25Bouveret E. Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Séraphin B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1661-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Initially, seven Sm-like (Lsm) proteins were identified in T. brucei (11Liu Q. Liang X.H. Uliel S. Belahcen M. Unger R. Michaeli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18210-18219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Functional studies on two of these proteins, Lsm3 and Lsm8, suggest that these proteins not only bind U6 but also affect mRNA stability (11Liu Q. Liang X.H. Uliel S. Belahcen M. Unger R. Michaeli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18210-18219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Two of these proteins were later identified as SSm proteins that bind to U2 and U4 snRNAs (13Tkacz I.D. Lustig Y. Stern M.Z. Biton M. Salmon-Divon M. Das A. Bellofatto V. Michaeli S. RNA. 2007; 13: 30-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and ultimately, the entire complex that binds the U6 snRNA was identified (26Tkacz I.D. Cohen S. Salmon-Divon M. Michaeli S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2008; 160: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Interestingly, localization studies demonstrated that the Lsm proteins localize near the nucleolus but cannot be detected in cytoplasmic bodies analogous to P-bodies in other eukaryotes (26Tkacz I.D. Cohen S. Salmon-Divon M. Michaeli S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2008; 160: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).In this study, the SmD3-, Lsm3-, and U1A-associated proteins were purified from Leishmania tarentolae and subjected to mass spectrometry. Interestingly, Lsm purification did not reveal any factors involved in mRNA degradation. The function of selected snRNP proteins that were identified by mass spectrometry in Leishmania was elucidated by RNAi silencing and in situ tagging in T. brucei. Silencing of U1A, as opposed to other U1 snRNP proteins, affected both cis- and trans-splicing as well as polyadenylation. The purification of U1A-associated proteins from L. tarentolae also identified, in addition to the U1 snRNP proteins, factors involved in splicing and polyadenylation. PRP19, a splicing factor that is associated with U5 snRNP in active cis-spliceosomes (27Wahl M.C. Will C.L. Lührmann R. Cell. 2009; 136: 701-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar), affected the capping of SL RNA and is also found in the SL RNP factory, suggesting a unique function in trypanosomes. GEMIN2, the factor that associates with SMN was localized to the SL RNP factory, but also to other domains in the nucleus. Silencing of GEMIN2 affected the level of all sn and SL RNAs, suggesting a major role in snRNP biogenesis. Although U1, U5, and SL RNA assemble with the same core Sm proteins, U1 and U5 snRNP proteins are not found in the SL RNP factory, suggesting that the SL RNP factory is a distinct and exclusive site for SL RNP production. This study highlights the function of universal splicing factors that acquired unique functions in trypanosomes, as well as that of trypanosome-specific splicing factors.DISCUSSIONIn this study, the Sm, Lsm, and U1A complexes were purified from Leishmania. This is the first purification of Lsm complex from trypanosomatids, leading to the identification of 39 snRNP U6-associated proteins. Interestingly, the purification did not reveal factors associated with mRNA stability, suggesting that Lsm proteins are either not involved in this process or that these factors are not tightly bound to the Lsm complex, as in other eukaryotes (25Bouveret E. Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Séraphin B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1661-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The purification of SmD3-associated proteins revealed 30 snRNP proteins already identified in T. brucei. However, 20 additional proteins were also discovered that were either not previously identified or were not annotated before. The function of proteins identified by mass spectrometry in Leishmania was studied in T. brucei, including that of U1- and U5-binding proteins, as well as PRP19 and GEMIN2, and additional proteins that have no homologues in other eukaryotes. The results suggest that U1 snRNP is not essential for trans-splicing, but one of the U1 snRNP proteins U1A is. To investigate the function of U1A in mRNA processing, the U1A complex was purified, and 45 additional proteins were identified, including the polyadenylation factor, CPSF73. U1A was found to be required for polyadenylation, because 3′ end formation is linked to trans-splicing (38Matthews K.R. Tschudi C. Ullu E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 39LeBowitz J.H. Smith H.Q. Rusche L. Beverley S.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 996-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), explaining how its depletion affects the trans-splicing process. This study also revealed conventional splicing factors that acquired trypanosome-specific functions. One such factor is PRP19, which is not only essential for trans-splicing but also plays a role in SL RNA biogenesis and is localized in the SL RNP factory. Another factor belonging to this family is the SMN complex protein, GEMIN2, which was found to be a master regulator of snRNP assembly. The factor is localized to the SL RNP factory, but is also found in other nuclear locations and most probably functions to deliver the SmD3/B proteins to SMN, and initiates the assembly of Sm core proteins on U1, U5, and SL RNAs. The SL RNP factory does not contain mature U1 and U5 snRNPs, suggesting that this site is exclusively devoted to SL RNP production. Several proteins that were co-purified with SmD3 are trypanosome-specific, are localized in nuclear speckles, and affect snRNP biogenesis, suggesting that in addition to canonical splicing factors, trypanosomes express specific splicing factors.U1 Functions in cis-Splicing but U1A Affects trans-Splicing via Its Direct Role in PolyadenylationThe function of U1 snRNP in trypanosome processing was always very puzzling, given that only three cis-splicing substrates have been found in the genome (36Ivens A.C.

The finding that U1 snRNP seems to be essential only for cis-splicing but not for trans-splicing (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3) is in agreement with results obtained in vitro in a nematode trans-splicing system (35Denker J.A. Maroney P.A. Yu Y.T. Kanost R.A. Nilsen T.W. RNA. 1996; 2: 746-755PubMed Google Scholar). However, our analysis of U1A silencing demonstrates that U1A is essential for both cis- and trans-splicing (Fig. 4), suggesting that this factor might have additional functions in the cell in addition to its cis-splicing role. U1 snRNP, and especially U1A, were shown in other eukaryotes to regulate 3′ end processing of its own mRNA (43Boelens W.C. Jansen E.J. van Venrooij W.J. Stripecke R. Mattaj I.W. Gunderson S.I. Cell. 1993; 72: 881-892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The effect of U1A depletion on trans-splicing may stem from its role in polyadenylation, due to the linkage between these processes (38Matthews K.R. Tschudi C. Ullu E.

Indeed, U1A was shown to associate with mammalian poly(A) polymerase (44Gunderson S.I. Beyer K. Martin G. Keller W. Boelens W.C. Mattaj L.W. Cell. 1994; 76: 531-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 45Guan F. Caratozzolo R.M. Goraczniak R. Ho E.S. Gunderson S.I. RNA. 2007; 13: 2129-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To examine if the effect of U1A depletion on trans-splicing stems from its direct role in polyadenylation, two different approaches were taken; these included purification of protein complexes carrying U1A and examining the direct role of the factor in polyadenylation. Because poly(A) polymerase is itself a substrate of cis-splicing, one can argue that affecting the level of U1 snRNP affects the production of PAP. However, this does not appear to be the case, as can be deduced from the different phenotypes observed for the U1A and U1- 70-kDa silencing. Whereas silencing of the U1 70 kDa was already efficient after 2 days of silencing, no trans-splicing defect was observed. However, U1A silencing resulted in a clear defect in trans-splicing after 2 days of silencing, and the effect became stronger as a result of more complete depletion of the protein (Fig. 4E, panels b and c). More convincing support for the direct involvement of U1A in polyadenylation comes from the effect of silencing on the length of the poly(A) tail. The effect of U1A silencing on the poly(A) tails was similar to that in cells silenced for the poly(A) polymerase itself. No effect on the length of poly(A) was observed in the first days of U1 70-kDa silencing. Additional, strong evidence for the involvement of U1A in polyadenylation comes from the mass spectrometry analysis of the U1A-associated proteins. First, the polyadenylation factor CPSF73 was detected in association with U1A. In addition, out of 45 proteins identified, 25 were found to be associated with complexes purified in L. tarentolae with CPSF73. Note that these common proteins are unique to these complexes, because the majority of these proteins did not appear in the purification of SmD3 or Lsm3 nor in the purification of splicing factors such as U2AF35, SF1, TSR1, and TSRIP.4Interestingly, a recently purified mammalian complex active in 3′ end formation was shown to contain, in addition to known polyadenylation factors, factors involved in splicing, transcription, signaling, translation, and DNA-damage response (46Shi Y. Di Giammartino D.C. Taylor D. Sarkeshik A. Rice W.J. Yates 3rd, J.R. Frank J. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. 2009; 33: 365-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The purification of U1A revealed the expected U1 snRNP proteins but also other factors (Table 3), including splicing factors, helicases, and proteins involved in DNA damage and repair. One such protein is encoding for Tb927.8.2230, related to HUS-1 protein implicated in DNA damage response, and factors involved in ADP-ribosylation. ADP-ribosylation controls various processes, including DNA-repair pathways (47Hassa P.O. Haenni S.S. Elser M. Hottiger M.O. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 789-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). The purification also revealed factors involved in ubiquitinylation and the proteasome. Indeed it was demonstrated in mammalian cells that small ubiquitin-like modifier regulates PAP and CPSF73 activity (48Vethantham V. Rao N. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 8848-8858Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 49Vethantham V. Rao N. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, PAP was shown to be regulated by ubiquitinylation in yeast (50del Olmo M. Mizrahi N. Gross S. Moore C.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the same ADP-ribosylation and ubiquitinylation factors co-purified with U1A were shown to associate with L. tarentolae CPSF73,4 suggesting that these factors are important to execute or regulate 3′ end formation.PRP19 Is an Essential Splicing Factor That Is Also Involved in Regulating cap-4 FormationThe purification of PRP19 with its associated factors using Sm proteins as bait suggests that this purification approach is able not only to capture the U5 mono-particles and the tri-snRNP complex but also the U5 complex that exists in the active spliceosome, known as the NTC complex (27Wahl M.C. Will C.L. Lührmann R. Cell. 2009; 136: 701-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the trypanosome NTC-like complex with its associated proteins was detected only in the purification of SmD3 but not in the purification of the Lsm complex. It was shown that Lsm proteins are released in the active spliceosome, whereas Sm proteins remain associated with the active spliceosomal complex (27Wahl M.C. Will C.L. Lührmann R. Cell. 2009; 136: 701-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar, 40Bessonov S. Anokhina M. Will C.L. Urlaub H. Lührmann R. Nature. 2008; 452: 846-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). This explains why the NTC complex was not detected among the proteins co-purified with the Lsm complex.PRP19 is a very essential component of the NTC complex. The trypanosome PRP19, like its homologues, contains three domains (indicated in supplemental S-2). The three domains include an N-terminal U box, a predicted coiled-coil domain, and a WD repeat domain at its C terminus (51Ohi M.D. Vander Kooi C.W. Rosenberg J.A. Ren L. Hirsch J.P. Chazin W.J. Walz T. Gould K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The U-box is structurally similar to RING finger domains. Like many proteins containing RING finger domains, PRP19 proteins exhibit E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro (51Ohi M.D. Vander Kooi C.W. Rosenberg J.A. Ren L. Hirsch J.P. Chazin W.J. Walz T. Gould K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Recently, it was demonstrated that ubiquitinylation/de-ubiquitinylation takes place during spliceosome activation (52Bellare P. Small E.C. Huang X. Wohlschlegel J.A. Staley J.P. Sontheimer E.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 444-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The trypanosome PRP19 might also serve as a ubiquitin ligase during splicing activation, as in cis-splicing. Of special interest are the following: 1) the localization of PRP19 in the SL RNP factory, which was established based on its distinct co-localization with tSNAP42 (Fig. 6), and 2) the effect of PRP19 on capping of the SL RNA. Silencing led to the accumulation of capped SL RNA at the +2 position. The effect on capping is surprising. It will be interesting to examine whether MT57, which carries out the +2 modification (41Arhin G.K. Li H. Ullu E. Tschudi C. RNA. 2006; 12: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), is controlled by PRP19. Further research is necessary to elucidate the exact role of PRP19 during SL RNA capping and biogenesis. Because of the close association of PRP19 with the SL RNP factory and because this factor is retained throughout the splicing reaction, it might serve as the factor that helps incorporate the SL RNP into the spliceosome.Lsm Complex Purification Revealed the Entire Subset of U4, U5, and U6 Proteins but No Factors Involved in mRNA StabilityThe purification of the Lsm complex led to the identification of the following: 1) five out of the seven Lsm proteins; 2) six of the Sm proteins (all except SmE); 3) six U5 snRNP proteins; and 4) three U4/U6 proteins, suggesting that the U4/U6 and the tri-snRNP complex are sufficiently stable to be purified via an Lsm protein. Of special interest are the five helicases revealed in this purification, one of which was identified as DED1 (Tb927.10.14550). Among the helicases was also DHH1, which was shown to exist in P-bodies in other eukaryotes and in stress granules in trypanosomes (53Kramer S. Queiroz R. Ellis L. Webb H. Hoheisel J.D. Clayton C. Carrington M. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 3002-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The other helicases are of unknown function. These helicases are not homologues of known helicases that function in cis-splicing such as SUB2, PRP2, PRP16, PRP22, and PRP434 and might be specific to trans-splicing. Note that U5 snRNA interacts by base-pairing with SL RNA in both intron and exon domains, and therefore helicase(s) may be needed to unwind this interaction (54Xu Y. Liu L. Michaeli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27883-27892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).The purification of Lsm3 also did not reveal factors involved in mRNA decay. However, our previous study of Lsm8 silencing indicated changes in mRNA stability as a result of depleting this factor, suggesting the involvement of Lsm proteins in mRNA degradation (11Liu Q. Liang X.H. Uliel S. Belahcen M. Unger R. Michaeli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18210-18219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Previously, we also provided evidence that Lsm proteins could not be detected in P-bodies or stress granules. However, these bodies in trypanosomes may function in the storage of mRNA but not their degradation (26Tkacz I.D. Cohen S. Salmon-Divon M. Michaeli S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 200"

https://openalex.org/W2027223101,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects 170 million people worldwide, and is a major public health problem in Brazil, where over 1% of the population may be infected and where multiple viral genotypes co-circulate. Chronically infected individuals are both the source of transmission to others and are at risk for HCV-related diseases, such as liver cancer and cirrhosis. Before the adoption of anti-HCV control measures in blood banks, this virus was mainly transmitted via blood transfusion. Today, needle sharing among injecting drug users is the most common form of HCV transmission. Of particular importance is that HCV prevalence is growing in non-risk groups. Since there is no vaccine against HCV, it is important to determine the factors that control viral transmission in order to develop more efficient control measures. However, despite the health costs associated with HCV, the factors that determine the spread of virus at the epidemiological scale are often poorly understood. Here, we sequenced partial NS5b gene sequences sampled from blood samples collected from 591 patients in São Paulo state, Brazil. We show that different viral genotypes entered São Paulo at different times, grew at different rates, and are associated with different age groups and risk behaviors. In particular, subtype 1b is older and grew more slowly than subtypes 1a and 3a, and is associated with multiple age classes. In contrast, subtypes 1a and 3b are associated with younger people infected more recently, possibly with higher rates of sexual transmission. The transmission dynamics of HCV in São Paulo therefore vary by subtype and are determined by a combination of age, risk exposure and underlying social network. We conclude that social factors may play a key role in determining the rate and pattern of HCV spread, and should influence future intervention policies."
https://openalex.org/W2096944866,"Protein kinase B/Akt protein kinases control an array of diverse functions, including cell growth, survival, proliferation, and metabolism. We report here the identification of pleckstrin homology-like domain family B member 1 (PHLDB1) as an insulin-responsive protein that enhances Akt activation. PHLDB1 contains a pleckstrin homology domain, which we show binds phosphatidylinositol PI(3,4)P(2), PI(3,5)P(2), and PI(3,4,5)P(3), as well as a Forkhead-associated domain and coiled coil regions. PHLDB1 expression is increased during adipocyte differentiation, and it is abundant in many mouse tissues. Both endogenous and HA- or GFP-tagged PHLDB1 displayed a cytoplasmic disposition in unstimulated cultured adipocytes but translocated to the plasma membrane in response to insulin. Depletion of PHLDB1 by siRNA inhibited insulin stimulation of Akt phosphorylation but not tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. RNAi-based silencing of PHLDB1 in cultured adipocytes also attenuated insulin-stimulated deoxyglucose transport and Myc-GLUT4-EGFP translocation to the plasma membrane, whereas knockdown of the PHLDB1 isoform PHLDB2 failed to attenuate insulin-stimulated deoxyglucose transport. Furthermore, adenovirus-mediated expression of PHLDB1 in adipocytes enhanced insulin-stimulated Akt and p70 S6 kinase phosphorylation, as well as GLUT4 translocation. These results indicate that PHLDB1 is a novel modulator of Akt protein kinase activation by insulin."
https://openalex.org/W2000934719,"Dopamine is a catecholamine neurotransmitter, which plays an important role in the regulation of T cell functions. In activated T cells from normal volunteers, stimulation of D(1) and D(2) dopamine receptors inhibit cell proliferation and cytokine secretion. However, there is no report yet regarding the regulatory role of D(1) and D(2) dopamine receptors in abnormally proliferating T cells. The present study investigates the expression and effect of activation of these dopamine receptors in Jurkat cells, a leukemic T cell line showing uncontrolled proliferation. Like normal human T cells, in Jurkat cells, D(1) and D(2) dopamine receptors are also expressed; however, unlike activated normal T cells, stimulation of these dopamine receptors in Jurkat cells fails to inhibit their T cell receptor-induced proliferation. This alteration is due to failure of D(1) dopamine receptor-mediated activation of cyclic AMP signaling and a missense mutation at the third cytoplasmic loop of D(2) dopamine receptors affecting inhibition of phosphorylation of ZAP-70, an important downstream protein transducing signal from the T cell receptor. These results help to understand the biology of abnormal proliferation of T cells in pathophysiological conditions where dopamine plays an important role."
https://openalex.org/W1979850723,"An outstanding question in sensory neuroscience is whether the perceived timing of events is mediated by a central supra-modal timing mechanism, or multiple modality-specific systems. We use a perceptual learning paradigm to address this question.Three groups were trained daily for 10 sessions on an auditory, a visual or a combined audiovisual temporal order judgment (TOJ). Groups were pre-tested on a range TOJ tasks within and between their group modality prior to learning so that transfer of any learning from the trained task could be measured by post-testing other tasks. Robust TOJ learning (reduced temporal order discrimination thresholds) occurred for all groups, although auditory learning (dichotic 500/2000 Hz tones) was slightly weaker than visual learning (lateralised grating patches). Crossmodal TOJs also displayed robust learning. Post-testing revealed that improvements in temporal resolution acquired during visual learning transferred within modality to other retinotopic locations and orientations, but not to auditory or crossmodal tasks. Auditory learning did not transfer to visual or crossmodal tasks, and neither did it transfer within audition to another frequency pair. In an interesting asymmetry, crossmodal learning transferred to all visual tasks but not to auditory tasks. Finally, in all conditions, learning to make TOJs for stimulus onsets did not transfer at all to discriminating temporal offsets. These data present a complex picture of timing processes.The lack of transfer between unimodal groups indicates no central supramodal timing process for this task; however, the audiovisual-to-visual transfer cannot be explained without some form of sensory interaction. We propose that auditory learning occurred in frequency-tuned processes in the periphery, precluding interactions with more central visual and audiovisual timing processes. Functionally the patterns of featural transfer suggest that perceptual learning of temporal order may be optimised to object-centered rather than viewer-centered constraints."

NADPH oxidases (Nox) and Dual oxidases (Duox) are multienzymatic complexes found in many cell types (1Sumimoto H. FEBS J. 2008; 275: 3249-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) that play a wide range of physiological roles (2Bedard K. Krause K.H. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 245-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (4720) Google Scholar). The seven different isoforms of these enzymatic complexes differ in their membrane redox components: Nox1 to Nox5, Duox1 and Duox2. Despite this molecular heterogeneity, they all share the common feature of reactive oxygen species production, which is either constitutive (Nox4) or inducible by cytosolic factors (Nox1, Nox2, and Nox3) or Ca2+ (Nox5, Duox1, and Duox2). The neutrophilic isoform containing Nox2, formerly called gp91phox, is often referred to as a specialized reactive oxygen species producer as its main role is to trigger the oxidative burst in neutrophilic phagosomes leading to the killing of phagocytized pathogens. Of course, this catalytic activity must be tightly regulated to avoid excessive reactive oxygen species production, leading to oxidation of macromolecules, DNA mutations, aging, and cell death. In contrast, a defect in NADPH oxidase activity results in chronic granulomatous disease, an inherited immunodeficiency characterized by an abnormal inflammatory response and recurrent bacterial and fungal infections (3Segal A.W. Mol. Med. Today. 1996; 2: 129-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This tight regulation is enabled by a physical separation before activation between the membrane-related flavocytochrome b558 (heterodimer of Nox2 and p22phox), a small G protein (Rac1 or Rac2), and the cytosolic factors p40phox, p47phox, and p67phox. In the resting state, these modular proteins form a heterotrimeric complex based on different interactions between their conserved binding domains (4Lapouge K. Smith S.J. Groemping Y. Rittinger K. J.

The p47phox subunit is a key component in the activation process. It contains an N-terminal phox homology domain (PX) and SH3 domains arranged in tandem and ends with a proline-rich region (see Fig. 1). In the whole NADPH oxidase assembly, it acts as a sensor of the activation signal through multiple phosphorylations on serines within its autoinhibitory region (AIR). The activated form of p47phox drives the translocation of the other cytosolic factors for assembly onto flavocytochrome b558 through the following mechanisms. Upon activation, the PX and tandem SH3s domains promote assembly through interactions with phosphoinositides (8Ago T. Kuribayashi F. Hiroaki H. Takeya R. Ito T. Kohda D. Sumimoto H. Proc. Natl. Acad.

To avoid any constitutive binding to the membrane and maintain the cytosolic location of p47phox, the tandem SH3s and PX domains must be masked in the resting state. Two functional states of p47phox had already been proposed, corresponding to both activated and autoinhibited conformations. The first p47phox autoinhibited model suggested an interaction between the tandem SH3s and some downstream residues (13Sumimoto H. Kage Y. Nunoi H. Sasaki H. Nose T. Fukumaki Y. Ohno M. Minakami S.

Since the original proposal, many studies have tried to decipher the relative organization of the different domains in the autoinhibited state.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7185-7193Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Recently, our group proposed a model for the global conformation of the entire p47phox in the autoinhibited form, using small angle x-ray scattering (20Durand D. Cannella D. Dubosclard V. Pebay-Peyroula E. Vachette P. Fieschi F. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7185-7193Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It allowed us to definitely discard the hypothesis of an interaction between the PX and SH3B domains. p47phox small angle x-ray scattering envelopes suggested that the PX domain was located in the proximity of the first SH3 domain (SH3A), but it was not possible to conclude on whether the PX interacts directly with the SH3A or is maintained in close proximity by a structured linker. Moreover, this work has strengthened the AIR-tandem SH3s interaction hypothesis initially based on studies using p47phox isolated modules. The AIR release from the tandem SH3s, occurring upon activation, has recently been confirmed by limited proteolysis coupled to mass spectrometry (21Marcoux J. Man P. Castellan M. Vivès C. Forest E. Fieschi F. FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Coupling between the AIR release and enhanced lipid binding affinity was shown, suggesting changes in PX domain accessibility. Deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry (DXMS) performed on the entire proteins confirmed the conformational difference between the activated and autoinhibited state (21Marcoux J. Man P. Castellan M. Vivès C. Forest E. Fieschi F. FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, conclusive data regarding the molecular mechanism of PX inhibition in the resting state and more precisely proofs of its involvement in any intramolecular interaction were still missing. To get detailed insight into the structural changes of p47phox, we extended our previous study and followed local deuteration kinetics in the individual parts of the protein in both states. We confirmed and more precisely described the exposure of the Src loops, from both SH3s, due to AIR release. Remarkably, for the first time, we identify a novel surface within the SH3A domain that is unmasked during activation. Using site-directed mutagenesis and the liposome binding assay, we confirm that this region is involved in the inhibition of the PX domain lipid binding properties. This study contributes a final response to the question of the p47phox autoinhibitory mechanism. The modular organization deciphered here, involving up to four regions, has never been reported, particularly regarding PX and SH3 domain interaction. Glutathione-Sepharose high performance and SP Sepharose high performance columns were from GE Healthcare (Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK). Jupiter C18 column (50 × 1 mm; 5 μm, 300 Å) was from Phenomenex (Torrance, CA). C4 and C8 macro traps were from Michrom Bioresources, Inc. (Auburn, CA). Pepsin from porcine gastric mucosa and protease type XIII from Aspergillus saitoi were from Sigma-Aldrich. The following products were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL): 1-palmitoyl-2-oleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (POPA), and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-(phosphoinositol-3,4-biphosphate) (PtdIns(3,4)P2). cDNA encoding p47phox residues 1–390 (p47phox) or 1–342 (p47phoxΔCter) and the cytosolic region of p22phox (residues 132–195) were cloned into pGex-6P vectors, adding an N-terminal GST fusion tag (see Fig. 1). Mutations were introduced by PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis. Due to the genetic construct, the full-length p47phox harbors 7 additional residues at the C terminus. All constructs were sequenced to confirm their identities. p47phox, p47phoxΔCter, and GST-p22phoxCter constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified according to Durand et al. (20Durand D. Cannella D. Dubosclard V. Pebay-Peyroula E. Vachette P. Fieschi F. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7185-7193Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), with slight differences described hereafter. Lysis buffer for p47phox purification included 1 mm EDTA, but we used 2 mm MgCl2 supplemented with DNase and Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) for GST-p22phoxCter purification. Buffers were set at pH 7.5 for p47phox construct purification and at pH 7 (lysis buffer) and pH 8 (elution buffer) for GST-p22phoxCter purification. GST cleavage gave rise to p47phox encoding residues 1–342, which will be referred to as p47phoxΔCter. GST-p22phoxCter was not cleaved after glutathione-Sepharose elution but was reloaded twice on the same column to bind any residual GST and concentrated on an Amicon centrifugal device with a 10-kDa cutoff (Millipore, Billerica, MA). GST used for surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments was obtained after GST-p47phoxΔCter overnight cleavage with PreScission protease (GE Healthcare). It was recovered from SP Sepharose column flow-through and concentrated on an Amicon centrifugal device with a 10-kDa cutoff. p47phoxtandem SH3s was also purified according to Durand et al. (20Durand D. Cannella D. Dubosclard V. Pebay-Peyroula E. Vachette P. Fieschi F. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7185-7193Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), with slight differences. The culture pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 7, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 4 mm 1–4-dithiothreitol (DTT) in the presence of Complete protease inhibitor. After overnight digestion at 4 °C with PreScission protease, the cleaved protein was precipitated with 60% ammonium sulfate and purified using a Superdex 75 prep grade column (GE Healthcare). The p47phoxtandem SH3s was finally eluted as a dimer, and the fractions were pooled and concentrated to 2.5 mg/ml on an Amicon centrifugal device with a 10-kDa cutoff. SPR experiments were conducted using a Biacore 3000 instrument (Biacore AB, Paris, France) equipped with a CM4 sensor chip. The machine was primed with the running buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, and 0.005% surfactant P20). p47phox was diluted in the running buffer to the required concentrations reported in Fig. 2. Before immobilization, 70 μl of N-hydroxysuccinimide and 70 μl of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide were first mixed, and 50 μl of the resulting mix were injected to prime the surface at 5 μl/min, as recommended by the manufacturer. Ten microliters of 78.2 nm GST-p22phoxCter diluted in 4 mm sodium acetate, pH 5, were then immobilized at 5 μl/min, and 30 μl of ethanolamine were finally injected to saturate the surface. All runs were carried out at 20 °C and at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. After each injection, the surface was regenerated by a 10-μl injection of 10 mm NaOH at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. For each p47phox injection (60 μl), a blank was run in parallel on a surface functionalized with 78.2 nm GST to subtract nonspecific binding. For the p47phoxΔCter and p47phoxTM-ΔCter comparison, we carried out crossed scales to overcome the possible problems of surface degradation over time by alternating injections between p47phoxΔCter, p47phoxTM-ΔCter, and p47phoxtandem SH3s. For point mutation analysis, crossed scales between p47phoxtandem SH3s and the mutants analyzed were carried out. For every third full-scale analysis, new CM4 surfaces were functionalized with both GST and GST-p22phoxCter. The in vitro semiquantitative liposome binding assay was adapted from Ago et al. (8Ago T. Kuribayashi F. Hiroaki H. Takeya R. Ito T. Kohda D. Sumimoto H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 4474-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Liposomes were prepared by mixing POPC and POPE (50:50) for the control (MLV1) and POPC, POPE, POPA, and PtdIns(3,4)P2 (45:45:5:5) for specific liposomes (MLV2). The mixture was then dried under nitrogen and resuspended to a concentration of 2 mm of total lipids in a binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT). After 2 h of incubation on ice, liposomes were obtained by vortexing. Proteins (5 μm) were incubated with liposomes (1 mm) for 15 min at 20 °C in 100 μl of binding buffer. Liposomes were collected by ultracentrifugation (1 h at 100,000 × g in an Airfuge rotor). Aliquots of bound (liposome pellet) and unbound p47phox (supernatant) were taken for further analysis by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Coomassie Blue-stained gels were scanned and analyzed by densitometry. Three independent experiments were conducted. Deuteration of p47phoxΔCter and p47phoxTM-ΔCter was initiated by a 20-fold dilution into a deuterated buffer (5 mm Hepes, pD 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, and 200 mm NaCl). Aliquots (40 μl) were taken after 30 s, 1 min, 5 min, 10 min, 30 min, 1 h, 3 h, 5 h, 6 h, and 8 h for the local kinetics and 10 s, 30 s, 1 min, 5 min, 10 min, 30 min, and 1 h for the global kinetics. The exchange was done at 21 °C and was quenched by the addition of 5.6 μl of 50 mm HCl and rapid freezing in liquid nitrogen. Each sample was quickly thawed and digested on ice for 2 min with pepsin (enzyme/protein w/w ratio 1) or protease type XIII (enzyme/protein w/w ratio 12) before mass spectrometric analysis. The digestion mixture was loaded on a peptide MacroTrap and desalted with 0.03% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA: solvent A) for 1 min at a flow rate of 400 μl/min. After that, peptides were eluted with a linear gradient (from 17 to 45% solvent B in 20 min, where solvent B was 95% acetonitrile, 0.03% TFA). Peptide sequencing was performed using a quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer (ESQUIRE 3000+, Bruker Daltonics) equipped with an electrospray source. For the MS/MS experiments, the three most intense ions from the preceding MS scan were fragmented. Tandem mass spectra were searched using Mascot, and the assignments were verified manually and by accurate mass measurements. Accurate mass measurements and the analysis of the local kinetics of deuteration were done on a time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer (6210, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) equipped with an electrospray source. Data were processed with Analyst QS and MassHunter Qualitative Analysis, and the deconvolution and calculation of the average masses were carried out in Magtran (22Zhang Z. Marshall A.G. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1998; 9: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Deuteration percentages (%D) were calculated using Equation 1 %D =[(mx%−m)/N]×100(Eq. 1) where m and mx% represent the average molecular mass of nondeuterated and partially deuterated samples, respectively, and N represents the number of exchangeable amide protons. Two independent measurements were taken, and the data were averaged. Data were processed with the scripts available at the Laboratory of Molecular Structure Characterization (IMIC, Prague) MS Tools web page. To study the structural modifications occurring in p47phox upon activation, we previously designed two recombinant forms corresponding to the autoinhibited and activated states (21Marcoux J. Man P. Castellan M. Vivès C. Forest E. Fieschi F. FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These p47phox constructs are C-terminally truncated but still contain all the domains involved in the activation process (PX domain, tandem SH3s, and AIR) (Fig. 1). This C-terminal truncation (from residue 343) improves the homogeneity of the purified protein without affecting the structural integrity of the protein, as published previously (23Shen K. Sergeant S. Hantgan R.R. McPhail L.C. Horita D.A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 8855-8865Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To mimic serine phosphorylations occurring upon p47phox activation, the corresponding serines 303, 304, and 328 were mutated into glutamic acid. We and others have shown that this triple mutant (p47phoxTM-ΔCter) presented an enhanced binding affinity for phosphoinositide lipids when compared with p47phoxΔCter (8Ago T. Kuribayashi F. Hiroaki H. Takeya R. Ito T. Kohda D. Sumimoto H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 4474-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 16Karathanassis D. Stahelin R.V. Bravo J. Perisic O. Pacold C.M. Cho W. Williams R.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5057-5068Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 21Marcoux J. Man P. Castellan M. Vivès C. Forest E. Fieschi F. FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition, structural analysis by deuterium exchange and limited proteolysis coupled to mass spectrometry also showed that this p47phoxTM-ΔCter presented a more open conformation, notably through release of the AIR (21Marcoux J. Man P. Castellan M. Vivès C. Forest E. Fieschi F. FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These previous characterizations supported the notion that p47phoxTM-ΔCter is a good mimic of the activated state. However, as a prerequisite to pursuing the detailed structural characterization of these two constructs, we needed to fully validate that the p47phoxTM-ΔCter is able to interact with p22phox, as described earlier on the full-length p47phox (18Groemping Y. Lapouge K. Smerdon S.J. Rittinger K. Cell. 2003; 113: 343-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 24Ago T. Nunoi H. Ito T. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33644-33653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). SPR was used to quantify this interaction. CM4 surfaces were functionalized with a GST-p22phoxCter construct (Fig. 1) or GST alone (negative control). Increasing p47phoxtandem SH3 concentrations were used as positive control experiments to compare with other p47phox constructs. No significant interaction with the GST-p22phoxCter surface could be detected using p47phoxΔCter, confirming its autoinhibited state (Fig. 2). The triple mutation S303E/S304E/S328E was sufficient to recover an affinity similar to that of p47phoxtandem SH3s alone: 187 nm versus 69 nm (supplemental Fig. S1 and supplemental Table S1). Similar results were obtained with the full-length forms of the protein; no interaction between GST-p22phoxCter and p47phox was observed, and the dissociation constant was determined at 55 nm for the full-length p47phoxTM (data not shown). The lack of affinity of wild-type p47phox constructs when compared with the S303E/S304E/S328E triple mutants clearly shows the conformational change occurring during p47phox activation and validates the use of p47phoxTM-ΔCter as a true mimic of the activated state. Proteolysis with acidic proteases was used to localize the differences in deuteration between the activated and autoinhibited forms of p47phox. Due to ragged and nonspecific digestion, the generated peptides had to be identified by means of tandem mass spectrometry. The separate use of pepsin and protease type XIII generated 89 cleavage sites, providing a total of 127 peptides with only five occurring in both digests (supplemental Fig. S2). The combination of peptides generated by both proteases provided 99% sequence coverage. Generated peptides have an average size of 14 residues. The average number of cleavage sites and generated peptides in the AIR was twice as low (17 cleavage sites and 23 peptides per 100 residues) as in the rest of the protein where a rather good resolution was obtained (28 cleavage sites and 40 peptides per 100 residues). The polybasic nature of the AIR is most probably behind the low spatial resolution in this region. Although pepsin is known to prefer hydrophobic sites (25Tang J. Nature. 1963; 199: 1094-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and thus provided only long peptides, fungal protease XIII was shown to have preference for basic amino acids (26Zhang H.M. Kazazic S. Schaub T.M. Tipton J.D. Emmett M.R. Marshall A.G. Anal. Chem. 2008; 80: 9034-9041Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and thus most probably generated very short peptides that were not detected. The exchange kinetics of individual p47phoxΔCter regions were followed on 30 peptides from the pepsin digest and 10 from the protease XIII digest, together covering 92% of the sequence. The missing 7% are due to the 4 N-terminal residues and to the gaps coming from the fact that we do not monitor exchange on the N-terminal amine of the peptides. Peptides used for DXMS study are shown in supplemental Fig. S2, and deuteration kinetics for selected peptides are shown in supplemental Fig. S3. Seven regions were determined by the difference between overlapping peptides. As an example, the deuteration percentage of region 276–279 was obtained by subtracting peptides 264–275 data from peptides 264–279 data (supplemental Fig. S4A). Moreover, spatial resolution was increased by the presence of short peptides. For instance, information given by peptides 161–174 was improved by the combined use of peptides 161–166 and 167–174 (supplemental Fig. S4, B–D). The first information given by the local kinetics is the solvent accessibility of different p47phox regions (supplemental Fig. S4A). As expected, the C-terminal region of p47phox (residues 333–342) was quickly deuterated, as was the linker region between the PX domain and the first SH3 (residues 119–160). As shown by the protection plots (Fig. 3, A and B), these two regions are already deuterated more than 50% after only 30 s of deuterium exchange. This is in complete agreement with the predicted unfolded nature of these segments (20Durand D. Cannella D. Dubosclard V. Pebay-Peyroula E. Vachette P. Fieschi F. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7185-7193Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It is also supported by our recent results obtained by limited proteolysis (21Marcoux J. Man P. Castellan M. Vivès C. Forest E. Fieschi F. FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Even if it seems poorly compatible with the structural and functional role that has recently been suggested for this linker (23Shen K. Sergeant S. Hantgan R.R. McPhail L.C. Horita D.A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 8855-8865Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), the latter one cannot be excluded as other structured regions show fast deuteration kinetics (e.g. helix 3 from PX; supplemental Fig. S4A). Regarding the AIR, fast deuteration kinetics are also observed, as expected from the structure, due to its unfolded sequence exposed at the surface of the tandem SH3s (18Groemping Y. Lapouge K. Smerdon S.J. Rittinger K. Cell. 2003; 113: 343-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1967784821,"Syndecans are a family of type-I transmembrane proteins that are involved in cell-matrix adhesion, migration, neuronal development, and inflammation. Previous quantitative genetic studies pinpointed Drosophila Syndecan (dSdc) as a positional candidate gene affecting variation in fat storage between two Drosophila melanogaster strains. Here, we first used quantitative complementation tests with dSdc mutants to confirm that natural variation in this gene affects variability in Drosophila fat storage. Next, we examined the effects of a viable dSdc mutant on Drosophila whole-body energy metabolism and associated traits. We observed that young flies homozygous for the dSdc mutation had reduced fat storage and slept longer than homozygous wild-type flies. They also displayed significantly reduced metabolic rate, lower expression of spargel (the Drosophila homologue of PGC-1), and reduced mitochondrial respiration. Compared to control flies, dSdc mutants had lower expression of brain insulin-like peptides, were less fecund, more sensitive to starvation, and had reduced life span. Finally, we tested for association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human SDC4 gene and variation in body composition, metabolism, glucose homeostasis, and sleep traits in a cohort of healthy early pubertal children. We found that SNP rs4599 was significantly associated with resting energy expenditure (P = 0.001 after Bonferroni correction) and nominally associated with fasting glucose levels (P = 0.01) and sleep duration (P = 0.044). On average, children homozygous for the minor allele had lower levels of glucose, higher resting energy expenditure, and slept shorter than children homozygous for the common allele. We also observed that SNP rs1981429 was nominally associated with lean tissue mass (P = 0.035) and intra-abdominal fat (P = 0.049), and SNP rs2267871 with insulin sensitivity (P = 0.037). Collectively, our results in Drosophila and humans argue that syndecan family members play a key role in the regulation of body metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2099061452,"The neonatal Fc receptor, FcRn, is responsible for the long half-life of IgG molecules in vivo and is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. A family of peptides comprising the consensus motif GHFGGXY, where X is preferably a hydrophobic amino acid, was shown previously to inhibit the human IgG:human FcRn protein-protein interaction (Mezo, A. R., McDonnell, K. A., Tan Hehir, C. A., Low, S. C., Palombella, V. J., Stattel, J. M., Kamphaus, G. D., Fraley, C., Zhang, Y., Dumont, J. A., and Bitonti, A. J. (2008) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 105, 2337-2342). Herein, the x-ray crystal structure of a representative monomeric peptide in complex with human FcRn was solved to 2.6 A resolution. The structure shows that the peptide binds to human FcRn at the same general binding site as does the Fc domain of IgG. The data correlate well with structure-activity relationship data relating to how the peptide family binds to human FcRn. In addition, the x-ray crystal structure of a representative dimeric peptide in complex with human FcRn shows how the bivalent ligand can bridge two FcRn molecules, which may be relevant to the mechanism by which the dimeric peptides inhibit FcRn and increase IgG catabolism in vivo. Modeling of the peptide:FcRn structure as compared with available structural data on Fc and FcRn suggest that the His-6 and Phe-7 (peptide) partially mimic the interaction of His-310 and Ile-253 (Fc) in binding to FcRn, but using a different backbone topology."
https://openalex.org/W2057554913,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activates the innate immune response through the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4).MD-2 complex. A synthetic lipid A precursor, lipid IV(A), induces an innate immune response in mice but not in humans. Both TLR4 and MD-2 are required for the agonist activity of lipid IV(A) in mice, with TLR4 interacting through specific surface charges at the dimerization interface. In this study, we used site-directed mutagenesis to identify the MD-2 residues that determine lipid IV(A) species specificity. A single mutation of murine MD-2 at the hydrophobic pocket entrance, E122K, substantially reduced the response to lipid IV(A). Combining the murine MD-2 E122K with the murine TLR4 K367E/S386K/R434Q mutations completely abolished the response to lipid IV(A), effectively converting the murine cellular response to a human-like response. In human cells, however, simultaneous mutations of K122E, K125L, Y41F, and R69G on human MD-2 were required to promote a response to lipid IV(A). Combining the human MD-2 quadruple mutations with the human TLR4 E369K/Q436R mutations completely converted the human MD-2/human TLR4 receptor to a murine-like receptor. Because MD-2 residues 122 and 125 reside at the dimerization interface near the pocket entrance, surface charge differences here directly affect receptor dimerization. In comparison, residues 42 and 69 reside at the MD-2/TLR4 interaction surface opposite the dimerization interface. Surface charge differences there likely affect the binding angle and/or rigidity between MD-2 and TLR4, exerting an indirect influence on receptor dimerization and activation. Thus, surface charge differences at the two MD-2/TLR4 interfaces determine the species-specific activation of lipid IV(A)."
https://openalex.org/W1994972931,"Alpha-galactosidases catalyze the hydrolysis of terminal alpha-1,6-galactosyl units from galacto-oligosaccharides and polymeric galactomannans. The crystal structures of tetrameric Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-galactosidase and its complexes with the substrates melibiose and raffinose have been determined to 1.95, 2.40, and 2.70 A resolution. The monomer folds into a catalytic (alpha/beta)(8) barrel and a C-terminal beta-sandwich domain with unassigned function. This pattern is conserved with other family 27 glycosidases, but this enzyme presents a unique 45-residue insertion in the beta-sandwich domain that folds over the barrel protecting it from the solvent and likely explaining its high stability. The structure of the complexes and the mutational analysis show that oligomerization is a key factor in substrate binding, as the substrates are located in a deep cavity making direct interactions with the adjacent subunit. Furthermore, docking analysis suggests that the supplementary domain could be involved in binding sugar units distal from the scissile bond, therefore ascribing a role in fine-tuning substrate specificity to this domain. It may also have a role in promoting association with the polymeric substrate because of the ordered arrangement that the four domains present in one face of the tetramer. Our analysis extends to other family 27 glycosidases, where some traits regarding specificity and oligomerization can be formulated on the basis of their sequence and the structures available. These results improve our knowledge on the activity of this important family of enzymes and give a deeper insight into the structural features that rule modularity and protein-carbohydrate interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2057154278,"The nitric-oxide synthases (NOS, EC 1.14.13.39) are modular enzymes containing attached flavoprotein and heme (NOSoxy) domains. To generate nitric oxide (NO), the NOS FMN subdomain must interact with the NOSoxy domain to deliver electrons to the heme for O(2) activation during catalysis. The molecular basis and how the interaction is regulated is unclear. We explored the role of eight positively charged residues that create an electropositive patch on NOSoxy in enabling the electron transfer by incorporating mutations that neutralized or reversed their individual charges. Stopped-flow and steady-state experiments revealed that individual charges at Lys(423), Lys(620), and Lys(660) were the most important in enabling heme reduction in nNOS. Charge reversal was more disruptive than neutralization in all cases, and the effects on heme reduction were not due to a weakening in the thermodynamic driving force for heme reduction. Mutant NO synthesis activities displayed a complex pattern that could be simulated by a global model for NOS catalysis. This analysis revealed that the mutations impact the NO synthesis activity only through their effects on heme reduction rates. We conclude that heme reduction and NO synthesis in nNOS is enabled by electrostatic interactions involving Lys(423), Lys(620), and Lys(660), which form a triad of positive charges on the NOSoxy surface. A simulated docking study reveals how electrostatic interactions of this triad can enable an FMN-NOSoxy interaction that is productive for electron transfer."

These receptors belong to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, one of the largest membrane protein families involved in cellular signaling (2Fredriksson R. Lagerström M.C. Lundin L.G. Schiöth H.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 1256-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2118) Google Scholar, 3Lagerström M.C. Schiöth H.B. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2008; 7: 339-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). The β1AR is the predominant βAR subtype in the heart, mediating the increase in cardiac rate and force of contraction (4Rockman H.A. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 2002; 415: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 5Brodde O.E. Bruck H. Leineweber K. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2006; 100: 323-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). This makes it the most important target receptor for the β-blockers that are used to treat common cardiac diseases such as chronic heart failure, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and arrhythmias. The mechanisms that regulate human β1AR (hβ1AR) are therefore of considerable interest.The hβ2AR is one of the most extensively studied GPCRs, but much less is known about hβ1AR.

Chem. 2003; 278: 39773-39781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) could indicate that the two receptors are regulated by distinct mechanisms. Their ligand-binding sites are well conserved, but the overall homology of the two βARs is only 54% (15Frielle T. Collins S. Daniel K.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Kobilka B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1987; 84: 7920-7924Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The most diverse regions are the intervening loops that connect the transmembrane domains, the extracellular N terminus and the intracellular C terminus. The third intracellular loops and the C-terminal tails of β1AR and β2AR have been implicated in the mediation of interactions with distinct intracellular proteins, including a number of PSD-95/Discs-large/ZO-1-homology (PDZ) domain-containing proteins that have divergent roles in receptor signaling and trafficking (reviewed in Refs. 16Hall R.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 17Marchese A. Paing M.M. Temple B.R. Trejo J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2008; 48: 601-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). In contrast, the extracellular domains of the two βARs have aroused only limited interest and have been thought to have a negligible role in receptor activation and regulation. This is probably related to the relatively short length of the N termini and the absence of noticeable functional domains with conserved motifs as opposed to GPCRs, e.g. in the adhesion receptor family (2Fredriksson R. Lagerström M.C. Lundin L.G. Schiöth H.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 1256-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2118) Google Scholar, 3Lagerström M.C. Schiöth H.B. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2008; 7: 339-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). Recent evidence nevertheless suggests that the extracellular βAR domains may have a more important role than had been anticipated. For example, the crystal structure of turkey β1AR revealed that the second extracellular loop participates in ligand binding, defining the entrance to the ligand binding pocket within the 7-transmembrane domain bundle (18Warne T. Serrano-Vega M.J. Baker J.G. Moukhametzianov R. Edwards P.C. Henderson R. Leslie A.G. Tate C.G. Schertler G.F. Nature. 2008; 454: 486-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar). On the other hand, ligand binding was found to lead to conformational changes in the β2AR N terminus and extracellular loops, as was revealed by conformation-specific antibodies and NMR spectroscopy, respectively (19Gupta A.

Nature. 2010; 463: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar).To initiate investigations into the mechanisms that regulate hβ1AR, we set out to characterize the specific steps that take place during the biogenesis of this GPCR. We demonstrate here that the receptor N terminus is extensively modified by mucin-type O-glycosylation during the rapid transport to the cell surface in addition to one N-glycan. Furthermore, the N terminus of the mature receptor with fully processed oligosaccharides was found to be subject to proteolytic cleavage by metalloproteinases, a cleavage that occurred both in vitro and in vivo. This cleavage was enhanced by agonist-mediated receptor activation and by direct activation of protein kinase C and adenylyl cyclase. On the other hand, mutation of the primary cleavage site was found to lead to stabilization of mature receptors. These results allow us to hypothesize that the N-terminal cleavage represents a novel way of controlling the number of functionally active cell surface β1ARs.DISCUSSIONThe present description of the biosynthetic profile of the hβ1AR in a heterologous expression system reveals several distinct features of the behavior of the receptor that are relevant to its regulation. We show that the hβ1AR is a GPCR that is efficiently expressed at the cell surface and is extensively glycosylated during transport to the plasma membrane. One N-glycan is added to the conserved Asn at position 15, and several mucin-type sialylated O-glycans are added to the N-terminal Ser/Thr residues. However, despite these modifications, the N terminus appears to be very susceptible to cleavage by a metalloproteinase of either the matrix metalloproteinase or the ADAM families, resulting in the formation of at least two smaller membrane-bound C-terminal receptor fragments. The cleavage was found to take place constitutively in vivo and, importantly, was enhanced after agonist-mediated receptor activation or direct stimulation of protein kinase C and adenylyl cyclase. Furthermore, inhibition of the cleavage by mutation of the major Arg31↓Leu32 cleavage site of the receptor was found to stabilize the mature receptors. These results suggest that the extracellular N terminus of the β1AR has a distinct functional role in receptor regulation. This N-terminal cleavage may be a way of altering the number of β1ARs at the cell surface, thus regulating cellular responsiveness to βAR ligands.Metalloproteinase-mediated N-terminal cleavage of the β1AR was first reported for the turkey receptor expressed in erythrocytes (29Jürss R. Hekman M. Helmreich E.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3349-3354Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Various mammalian species, including rats, rabbits, dogs, pigs, and humans, have also been shown to express multiple β1AR forms in endogenous tissues (31Stiles G.L. Strasser R.H. Lavin T.N. Jones L.R. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8443-8449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the same phenomenon has been described for a number of heterologous expression systems expressing hβ1ARs (10McLean A.J. Milligan G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 130: 1825-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 13Dunigan C.D. Hoang Q. Curran P.K. Fishman P.H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8019-8030Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 14Liang W. Austin S. Hoang Q. Fishman P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39773-39781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, susceptibility to limited proteolysis appears to be an evolutionally conserved property of this GPCR. Nevertheless, the general notion has been that the cleavage is entirely an in vitro event that takes place during sample preparation. To our knowledge, this study represents the first demonstration that the receptor is also cleaved in a regulated manner in vivo. Several lines of direct and indirect evidence support this notion. (i) Only the mature hβ1AR with fully processed N- and O-glycans was found to be cleaved, whereas the receptor precursor existed only as a full-length polypeptide. In pulse-chase labeling experiments, the cleaved receptor fragments appeared after the receptor precursors had been converted to the mature form, and furthermore, if receptor transport to the cell surface was blocked with BFA, no cleavage occurred. These results suggest that the receptor is cleaved constitutively after the newly synthesized receptors have reached the cell surface or are being transported through the trans-Golgi network. (ii) The appearance of the cleaved receptor fragments was partially inhibited by adding the metalloproteinase inhibitors GM6001 and TAPI-1 to the culture medium, whereas the inactive GM6001 had no apparent effect. (iii) Inhibition of the N-terminal cleavage by mutation of the major Arg31↓Leu32 cleavage site stabilized mature receptors. (iv) The cleavage was enhanced by PMA and forskolin, indicating that the event can be modulated by protein kinase C and adenylyl cyclase activation. (v) Furthermore, the βAR agonists ISO and dobutamine were found to enhance the cleavage. As the N-terminal sequences of the Mr 54,000 fragments purified from cells treated with 10 μm ISO for 3 h or not were identical (data not shown), the cleavage induced by the agonists appears to take place at the same site(s) as the cleavage occurring in vitro during membrane preparation. The agonist-mediated enhancement of receptor cleavage was both concentration- and time-dependent and was inhibited by the β1AR-specific antagonist CGP-20712. There is thus compelling evidence that mature hβ1ARs are subject to both homologous and heterologous regulation via limited proteolysis of the N terminus.Metalloproteinase-mediated N-terminal cleavage has been described previously for a limited number of GPCRs in the rhodopsin family, i.e. for endothelin B (35Kozuka M.

The V2 vasopressin receptor, on the other hand, has been shown to be cleaved at the interface between the second transmembrane domain and the first extracellular loop (42Kojro E. Fahrenholz F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6476-6481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 43Kojro E. Postina R. Gilbert S. Bender F. Krause G. Fahrenholz F. Eur. J.

Consistent with the findings obtained for the hβ1AR, the endothelin B, V2 vasopressin, and thyrotropin receptors are cleaved in an activation-dependent manner following agonist binding (36Grantcharova E.

Chen C.R. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the thrombin-mediated cleavage of PAR-1 has been shown to take place following protein kinase C activation (40Ludeman M.J. Zheng Y.W. Ishii K. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18592-18599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and furthermore, it has been shown that matrix metalloproteinase I can mediate the cleavage and activation of PAR-1, which leads to invasion and metastasis of tumor cells (41Boire A. Covic L. Agarwal A. Jacques S. Sherifi S. Kuliopulos A. Cell. 2005; 120: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Otherwise, the functional consequences of metalloproteinase-mediated cleavage have not been fully revealed for any other family A GPCRs. The existence of this phenomenon in distinct subfamilies of the rhodopsin-type GPCRs suggests, however, that regulated cleavage may be a more common property than has previously been anticipated.What is the functional significance of the hβ1AR N-terminal cleavage? Several other cell surface transmembrane proteins are known to be cleaved in the extracellular domain by metalloproteinases. All the epidermal growth factor ligand family members, for example, are synthesized as inactive transmembrane precursors that undergo ectodomain proteolytic cleavage. The growth factors released this way then act in an endocrine, paracrine, or autocrine manner via binding to their cognate receptors (45Blobel C.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). A similar functional role for the cleaved hβ1AR N terminus is very unlikely, however, as it lacks any apparent functional protein domains. It is more likely that the cleavage has a role in attenuating receptor activity and activation-mediated signaling in cells. This notion was supported by the observation that the inhibition of receptor cleavage by mutation of the Arg31↓Leu32 cleavage site stabilized mature receptors, suggesting that the proteolytic cleavage may have a role in the turnover of cell surface receptors. Removal of the receptor N terminus may represent the first step in a pathway that directs the receptor protein toward degradation. It remains to be demonstrated in future studies whether cleavage of the receptor requires internalization or whether it occurs at the cell surface. Internalization and targeting to lysosomal degradation may be the primary way of disposing of cell surface GPCRs (46Hanyaloglu A.C. von Zastrow M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2008; 48: 537-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), but it has also been suggested, e.g. for the β2AR (47Jockers R. Angers S. Da Silva A. Benaroch P. Strosberg A.D. Bouvier M. Marullo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28900-28908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), that receptor degradation may occur without internalization at the cell surface.The β1AR ligand-binding site resides within the 7-transmembrane helix bundle and involves amino acids in transmembrane helices 3 and 5–7 and in the second extracellular loop (18Warne T. Serrano-Vega M.J. Baker J.G. Moukhametzianov R. Edwards P.C. Henderson R. Leslie A.G. Tate C.G. Schertler G.F. Nature. 2008; 454: 486-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar). Thus, it is not immediately obvious why agonist binding and receptor activation should lead to enhanced cleavage of the receptor in the N-terminal domain. It can be hypothesized, however, that activation-induced conformational changes in the transmembrane α-helices may be reflected in the N terminus. This may in turn increase susceptibility to enzymatic cleavage. This possibility is in line with previous findings that have suggested that metalloproteinase-mediated cleavage is not necessarily dependent on the primary structure of the substrate protein but rather on conformational attributes (48Huovila A.P. Turner A.J. Pelto-Huikko M. Kärkkäinen I. Ortiz R.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 413-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Interestingly, recent studies by Gupta et al. (19Gupta A. Décaillot F.M. Gomes I. Tkalych O. Heimann A.S. Ferro E.S. Devi L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5116-5124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 49Gupta A. Rozenfeld R. Gomes I. Raehal K.M. Décaillot F.M. Bohn L.M. Devi L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10735-10744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that activation-induced conformational alterations do indeed occur in the N terminus of several GPCRs in the rhodopsin family, including the β2AR. Furthermore, it was also found that an N-terminally directed antibody of the δ-opioid receptor was able to recognize post-activation-mediated changes in the receptor C terminus, an ability that was impaired after mutations at the C-terminal phosphorylation sites (49Gupta A. Rozenfeld R. Gomes I. Raehal K.M. Décaillot F.M. Bohn L.M. Devi L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10735-10744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). If changes in the phosphorylation of β1AR intracellular domains are converted to conformational changes in the receptor N terminus, it can be hypothesized that the observed increase in the cleavage of the hβ1AR by PMA and forskolin may be mediated by the same mechanism as binding of the agonist to the receptor. An alternative hypothesis is that the enhanced cleavage of the receptor results from increased functional activity of the cleaving enzyme itself. This could occur via phosphorylation of the metalloprotease through a protein kinase that is activated by the second messengers. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), for example, is known to phosphorylate ADAM-17 in response to PMA at Thr735 (50Díaz-Rodríguez E. Montero J.C. Esparís-Ogando A. Yuste L. Pandiella A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2031-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), a modification that is indispensable for maturation of the protein and its inducible trafficking to the cell surface (51Soond S.M. Everson B. Riches D.W. Murphy G. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). These highly speculative mechanisms that may be responsible for regulated hβ1AR cleavage need to be verified in future studies.The hβ1AR was found to be modified by both N- and O-glycosylation. The latter modification was first suggested by the fact that removal of the single N-glycan at Asn15 in the mature receptor resulted in a receptor form that migrated more slowly than the corresponding de-N-glycosylated receptor precursor. Treatment of the mature receptor with neuraminidase and O-glycosidase revealed that it carries mucin-type sialylated O-glycans. Because of a lack of the consensus sequence for O-glycosylation, we used the NetOGlyc 3.1 Server (52Julenius K. Mølgaard A. Gupta R. Brunak S. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar) to predict the mucin-type O-glycosylation sites in the receptor N terminus. This program predicts five potential O-glycosylation sites for the hβ1AR, namely Thr28, Ser37, Ser41, Ser47, and Ser49, which are well conserved in mammalian β1ARs (Fig. 4).Apart from the hβ1AR, an increasing number of other GPCRs in the rhodopsin family have been reported to be modified by O-linked carbohydrates.

On the other hand, Sadeghi and Birnbaumer (54Sadeghi H. Birnbaumer M. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 731-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) showed that neither the level of expression of the V2 vasopressin receptor nor its function is altered by eliminating the putatively O-glycosylated Ser/Thr residues. We cannot at the moment deduce the functional role of the O-glycosylation of the hβ1AR, and further studies will have to be performed before any definite conclusions are drawn. One intriguing possibility is that the extensive O-glycosylation might modulate the susceptibility of the N-terminal domain to metalloproteinases, possibly by restricting the conformational flexibility of the N terminus or by introducing negative charges. By comparison, O-glycans of several other cell surface proteins, including the transferrin receptor, have been shown to protect the protein from excessive proteolytic cleavage (59Rutledge E.A. Root B.J. Lucas J.J. Enns C.A. Blood. 1994; 83: 580-586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The clustered Ser residues in the hβ1AR N terminus (Ser37, Ser41, Ser47, and Ser49) are flanked by two proteolytic cleavage sites identified here, Arg31↓Leu32 and Pro52↓Leu53 (Fig. 4), which speaks for the possibility that O-glycans may indeed have a protective role.

Out of the many TAS described, the relBE family is one of the most abundant, being present in the three first sequenced strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (D39, TIGR4 and R6). To address the function of the pneumococcal relBE2Spn TAS in the bacterial physiology, we have compared the response of the R6-relBE2Spn wild type strain with that of an isogenic derivative, Delta relB2Spn under different stress conditions such as carbon and amino acid starvation and antibiotic exposure. Differences on viability between the wild type and mutant strains were found only when treatment directly impaired protein synthesis. As a criterion for the permanence of this locus in a variety of clinical strains, we checked whether the relBE2Spn locus was conserved in around 100 pneumococcal strains, including clinical isolates and strains with known genomes. All strains, although having various types of polymorphisms at the vicinity of the TA region, contained a functional relBE2Spn locus and the type of its structure correlated with the multilocus sequence type. Functionality of this TAS was maintained even in cases where severe rearrangements around the relBE2Spn region were found. We conclude that even though the relBE2Spn TAS is not essential for pneumococcus, it may provide additional advantages to the bacteria for colonization and/or infection."

Several disorders, including Liddle syndrome and pseudohypoaldosteronism type I, result from ENaC mutations in humans (2Rossier B.C. Pradervand S. Schild L. Hummler E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 877-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). ENaC is regulated by many factors, which affect either channel density at the membrane surface or open probability (Po). Among regulators of ENaC Po is Na+ self-inhibition, a down-regulation of both native and cloned ENaCs by extracellular Na+. As urinary [Na+] in distal renal tubules vary considerably under different physiological and pathological conditions, the existence of Na+ self-inhibition provides a mechanism for epithelial cells to rapidly tune the rate of Na+ influx according to fluctuations of the urinary [Na+]. It may protect cells from damage by a sudden rise of intracellular [Na+] and limit Na+ absorption in kidney tubules to maintain body fluid balance. When the urinary [Na+] is lower in the distal tubules, ENaCs are relieved from Na+ self-inhibition, thus enhancing Na+ reabsorption to minimize urinary Na+ losses. Recent studies of the Na+ self-inhibition response of cloned ENaCs in Xenopus oocytes have yielded some clues regarding this intrinsic regulatory mechanism.

A functional ENaC complex likely is formed by three homologous subunits in a manner similar to the trimeric structure of chicken acid-sensing ion channel 1 (cASIC1) (3Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar), a member of the ENaC/degenerin superfamily. All three subunits contribute to the channel pore. ENaC subunits have two transmembrane domains (M1 and M2) linked by a large extracellular domain (ECD) and intracellular termini. Recent mutagenesis studies have revealed several structural elements that are required for conferring the Na+ self-inhibition response. In a chimeric study, the proximal part of the ECD was found to control the speed of the inhibition (4Babini E. Geisler H.S. Siba M. Gründer S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28418-28426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We reported that substitution of His239 of mouse γENaC with Asp, Arg, or Cys eliminated and the homologous mutations of αHis282 enhanced Na+ self-inhibition of mouse αβγENaCs (5Sheng S. Bruns J.B. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9743-9749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). All three ENaC subunits contain 16 conserved Cys residues in the ECD. Point mutations of eight α- and nine γCys residues significantly alter the Na+ self-inhibition response, suggesting they are necessary for the formation of correct tertiary structure permitting this allosteric regulation (6Sheng S.

The Na+ self-inhibition response is dramatically changed by mutations at the homologous αGly481 and γMet438 within the thumb domains of the ECD (7Maarouf A.B. Sheng N. Chen J. Winarski K.L.

In addition, several ENaC regulators, including transition metals, proteases, and extracellular H+ and Cl−, affect ENaC activity in part via alterations of Na+ self-inhibition (8Sheng S. Perry C.J.

It appears that one of the functions of the ECDs of ENaC subunits is to confer the negative regulation by extracellular Na+, as the mutated residues and potential sites of action for the above mentioned regulators are all within the ECDs. The crystal structure of cASIC1 revealed a highly organized ECD structure consisting of five distinct subdomains termed palm, β-ball, finger, thumb, and knuckle (3Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). The ECDs of ENaC subunits are expected to have a similar overall organization. However, some subdomains likely differ in structure given their limited homology. For example, sequence alignments indicate that the least conserved region between ASICs and ENaCs is in their proximal ECDs that encompasses the finger domain (3Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar) and contains some of the sites implicated in Na+ self-inhibition. The poor conservation precludes the possibility of mapping these sites of interest on the cASIC1 structure with reasonable accuracy. To gain additional insights regarding the structural requirements of Na+ self-inhibition, we systematically investigated the functional roles of selected residues in the vicinity of γHis239, which we previously termed the extracellular allosteric regulatory site (EARS) (5Sheng S. Bruns J.B. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9743-9749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 8Sheng S. Perry C.J. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31687-31696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that mutations of multiple residues significantly suppressed Na+ self-inhibition and suggest that the critical γHis239 functions within a regulatory subdomain of 22 residues that has a specific role in conferring Na+ self-inhibition. In addition, we demonstrate that an ENaC mutant that has lost Na+ self-inhibition still undergoes gating transitions. Point mutations were introduced into mouse α, β, and γ ENaC (αβγmENaC) cDNAs in pBluescript SK-vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The intended mutation was verified by DNA sequencing. Wild-type and mutant ENaC cRNAs were made using T3 RNA polymerase (Ambion, Inc.), purified by an RNA purification kit (Qiagen), and quantified by spectrophotometry. ENaC expression in Xenopus oocytes and current measurements by two-electrode voltage clamp were performed as reported previously (15Sheng S. Li J. McNulty K.A. Avery D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8572-8581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Stage V and VI oocytes with the follicle cell layer removed were injected with 50 nL/cell of mixed cRNAs composed of 0.5–2 ng of each mENaC subunit (α, β, and γ) and incubated at 18 °C in modified Barth's solution (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 15 mm Hepes, 0.3 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 10 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 100 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate, pH 7.4). All experiments were performed at room temperature (20–24 °C) 20–52 h following injection. Oocytes were placed in a recording chamber from Warner Instruments (Hamden, CT) and perfused with a constant flow rate of 12–15 ml/min. Voltage clamp was performed using a TEV-200 voltage clamp amplifier (Dagan Corp.) and the DigiData 1322A interface controlled by pClamp (version 9.2, Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). Na+ self-inhibition was examined by rapidly replacing a low [Na+] bath solution (NaCl-1; containing 1 mm NaCl, 109 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 2 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) with a high [Na+] bath solution (NaCl-110; containing 110 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) while the oocytes were continuously clamped to −60 or −100 mV as specified. Bath solution exchange was done with a Teflon valve perfusion system controlled by computer (AutoMate Scientific, Inc, Berkeley, CA). Upon completion of the experiment, 10 μm amiloride was added to the bath solution to determine the amiloride-insensitive portion of the whole cell current. Inward currents present in 10 μm amiloride at −60 or −100 mV were mostly <200 nA. Data from oocytes with unusually high amiloride-insensitive currents (>5% of the total current) were eliminated to minimize current contamination from membrane leak and endogenous channels. To avoid complications from the observable variability in the Na+ self-inhibition response of wild-type (WT) ENaCs among different batches of oocytes (6Sheng S. Maarouf A.B. Bruns J.B. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20180-20190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the response of WT channels was always tested in an alternating manner with mutants in the same batch of oocytes. An exponential equation by Clampfit (version 9.2, Molecular Devices Corp.) was used to fit the first 40 s of current decay following the maximal inward current (peak current, Ipeak) directly after the bath solution change from a low to high Na+ concentration. Steady state current (Iss) was measured at 40 s after Ipeak. The amiloride-insensitive currents were subtracted from Iss and Ipeak currents to determine the amiloride-sensitive current ratio of Iss/Ipeak, the index for the magnitude of Na+ self-inhibition. Oocytes were perfused with NaCl-110 while clamped to −30, −60, or −100 mV. Control currents were measured for 2 min, and then the bath solution was changed to NaCl-110 supplemented with 1 mm [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET, Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc.) or 5 mm sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTSES, Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc.) for 2 min. The reagent was then washed out with NaCl-110 for 1 min, followed by perfusion with 10 μm amiloride in NaCl-110 to determine the amiloride-insensitive current. Due to the short half-life of the reagents in aqueous solutions (16Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), reagents were measured in powder form and dissolved in bath solution immediately prior to use. Oocytes with unstable currents were not used in these experiments. Oocytes were placed in a hypertonic solution (NaCl-110 supplemented with 200 mm sucrose) for 5 min. The vitelline membranes were manually removed, and the oocytes were then placed in a recording chamber with NaCl-110 at room temperature (22–25 °C) for least 20 min before initiating recordings. The pipette solution was the same as bath solution (NaCl-110). Patch pipettes with a tip resistance of 5–10 megohms were used. Patch clamp in the cell-attached configuration was performed using a PC-One Patch Clamp amplifier (Dagan Corp.) and a DigiData 1322A interface connected to a personal computer. Patches were clamped at membrane potentials (negative value of pipette potentials) of −40 to −100 mV. pClamp (versions 8 and 10, Molecular Devices Corp.) were used for data acquisition and analyses, respectively. Single channel recordings were acquired at 5 kHz, filtered at 300 Hz by a four-pole low pass Bessel filter built in the amplifier, and stored on the hard disk. Open probability was estimated by single channel search function of pClamp (version 10) from recordings that contained no more than five current levels (four channels) and lasted for at least 5 min. Voltages were not corrected by the junction potential. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Significance comparisons between groups were performed with Student's t tests. A p value of <0.05 was considered significantly different. Na+ self-inhibition is absent in oocytes expressing αβγmENaC with γHis239 mutated to Asp, Arg, or Cys (5Sheng S. Bruns J.B. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9743-9749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We tested whether more conservative mutations of γHis239 with aromatic residues would retain their functional role in the regulation of ENaC by external Na+. As shown in Fig. 1, substitution of γHis239 with Phe, Trp, or Tyr eliminated Na+ self-inhibition, suggesting this His residue has an important role in this process. Mutations of γHis239 alter ENaC inhibition by extracellular Na+, Ni2+, and Cl−, as well as ENaC activation by external Zn2+ and H+ (5Sheng S. Bruns J.B. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 50098-50111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As gating properties of γHis239 mutant channels have not been explored, we obtained single channel recordings of αβγH239F channels expressed in oocytes. Cell-attached patch records revealed an average Po of αβγH239F (0.73 ± 0.06, n = 10) that was significantly higher than that of the WT (0.39 ± 0.08, n = 8, p < 0.01, Fig. 1). The product of Po and channel number (N × Po) of the mutant (1.55 ± 0.23, n = 10) also was significantly greater than that of WT (0.67 ± 0.21, n = 8, p < 0.05). However, channel numbers in the patches were similar, 1.6 ± 0.3 (n = 10) for the mutant and 2.3 ± 0.4 (n = 8, p > 0.05) for WT. Single channel conductance of the mutant (4.7 ± 0.2 pS, n = 6) was not different significantly from that of WT (4.4 ± 0.1 pS, n = 7, p > 0.05). These results demonstrate that in the absence of a Na+ self-inhibition response, ENaCs still transition between open and closed states although at a higher Po. To ascertain whether residues in the vicinity of γHis239 influence Na+ self-inhibition, we performed scanning mutagenesis in the region from Ser214 to Glu261 of γmENaC. This 48-residue tract is conserved among human, mouse, and rat γENaC subunits and is predicted to contain helical, extended, and coiled structures (see Fig. 5, A and B). The 47 consecutive residues (excluding the native Cys220), were mutated individually to Cys, and mutant γmENaC subunits were co-expressed with wild-type α- and βmENaCs in oocytes. Na+ self-inhibition responses of the mutants were examined and compared with WT in the same batches of oocytes. Among the 47 mutants, 16 significantly altered both the speed and magnitude of Na+ self-inhibition, and four increased only the time constant (p < 0.01, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). A suppressed and slowed response was observed in 13 mutants (F225C, S227C, G228C, N230C, I232C, W235C, Y236C, H239C, N242C, I243C, M244C, A245C, and Q246C), and a greater and faster response was seen in the other three mutants (E234C, L238C, and Y240C). These 16 mutants, including H239C, are located in a 22-residue tract between γPhe225 and γGln246 (Fig. 3), suggesting a specific role of this segment in Na+ self-inhibition. Interestingly, Fig. 3, A and B, show certain patterns in the distribution of residues where mutations led to significant changes in Na+ self-inhibition. For example, from Gln233 to Met241, three contiguous residues where substitutions altered Na+ self-inhibition (Fig. 3, black bars) were flanked by residues where mutations did not alter Na+ self-inhibition (open bars), suggestive of a helical structure.FIGURE 2Multiple mutations alter the Na+ self-inhibition response. Representative recordings for Na+ self-inhibition responses of WT and selected mutants are shown. Oocytes were clamped at −60 mV and whole cell currents were continuously recorded, while bath [Na+] was rapidly increased from 1 mm (open bar) to 110 mm (gray bar).

These experiments also may provide clues regarding relative locations of the residues in the channel complex (i.e. exposed or buried). Positively charged and membrane impermeant MTSET was used to avoid unwanted modifications of sulfhydryl groups in transmembrane or intracellular domains of ENaCs (18Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. Bucher D.B.

These results indicated that at least 12 residues in the scanned region were exposed to solvent. The first seven residues modified by MTSET are within the 22-residue tract (γPhe225 to γGln246), which hosts residues whose mutations resulted in significant changes in Na+ self-inhibition. This confirms the important functional role of this tract. The last five sites modified by MTSET are located in a stretch of 15 residues (γVal247 to γGlu261) immediately following the 22-residue tract. Mutations within this 15-residue tract did not significantly alter Na+ self-inhibition, suggesting these residues are not essential to the mechanism of Na+ self-inhibition. The observation that MTSET significantly increased currents of multiple mutants implies that this 15-residue tract also contains functionally important sites. A lack of response to MTSET may reflect a solvent inaccessible residue. Alternatively, the residue may be accessible and modified by MTEST but lack a change in functional activity following MTSET treatment. For example, channels that lack a Na+ self-inhibition response and have a high baseline Po are unable respond to MTSET treatment with an increase in current. We examined whether the lack of response of γH239C to MTSET reflected a high Po state by co-expressing γH239C with an α subunit mutant that lowers Po (αG481M) (7Maarouf A.B. Sheng N. Chen J. Winarski K.L. Okumura S. Carattino M.D. Boyd C.R. Kleyman T.R. Sheng S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7756-7765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). αG481M/βγH239C channels exhibited a Na+ self-inhibition response that was significantly greater than WT (Iss/Ipeak = 0.33 ± 0.01, n = 5, p < 0.001 versus WT or αβγH239C). However, these channels did not respond to MTSET with a significant change in current (IMTSET/I = 1.32 ± 0.05, n = 5, p > 0.05 versus WT), suggesting that γHis239 is solvent inaccessible. The two sets of data, mutation-induced changes in Na+ self-inhibition and responses to MTSET, allowed us to analyze potential secondary structures. Our data were consistent with an α helix comprised of residues γAla231–Ile243. As shown in Fig. 5C, all residues where mutations led to significant reductions in Na+ self-inhibition were located on the same face in a helical wheel projection, whereas residues whose replacements did not alter or moderately enhanced Na+ self-inhibition lined the opposite face. The two residues where introduced sulfhydryl groups were modified by MTSET shared the same face with the residues whose mutations did not suppress Na+ self-inhibition. We attempted to map functional data to helical wheels that had various lengths and starting residues. The above 13-residue helix was the one most compatible with all three criteria: secondary structural predictions (Fig. 5B), mutation-induced changes in Na+ self-inhibition, and responses to MTSET (Fig. 3). In addition, the four residues whose substitutions by Cys residues rendered the mutants responding to MTSET with irreversible increases in currents line the same face of a helical wheel comprising 10 residues from γGlu250 to γAla259, suggesting a second helical structure (Fig. 5D). For residues between γPhe225 and γAsn230, no consensus secondary structures could be elucidated from our functional studies. Of all of the mutants tested, MTSET had the greatest effect on γE234C with an IMTSET/I of 3.2 ± 0.2 (n = 27). The large stimulatory effect was somewhat surprising given the moderate enhancement of Na+ self-inhibition observed with this mutation (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). We performed additional studies to examine the functional role of γGlu234. Substitutions with Gln, Lys, or Arg showed an enhancement of Na+ self-inhibition similar to that of γE234C. The Iss/Ipeak values were 0.47 ± 0.02 (n = 6) for γE234Q, 0.41 ± 0.02 (n = 6) for γE234K, 0.44 ± 0.02 (n = 6) for γE234R, and 0.59 ± 0.02 (n = 6) for WT. The time constants were 5.2 ± 0.3 (n = 6) for γE234Q, 5.0 ± 0.3 (n = 6) for γE234K, 5.1 ± 0.3 (n = 6) for γE234R, and 7.8 ± 0.2 (n = 6) for WT. All above values for the mutants significantly were less than that of WT (p < 0.01). The results suggest that γGlu234 is not critical for the Na+ self-inhibition response and rather may function as a moderate suppressor of Na+ self-inhibition in WT channels. To test whether modification of γE234C is charge-dependent, we examined the effect of a negatively charged sulfhydryl reagent, MTSES. As shown in Fig. 6B, 5 mm MTSES did not significantly alter whole cell Na+ currents. However, MTSES application blocked the stimulatory effect of MTSET (Fig. 6C), indicating that the mutant was modified by MTSES without an observable change in current. As MTSET and MTSES have similar volumes but carry opposite charges at neutral pH (16Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), these data suggest that access to γE234C is not charge-dependent but the modification-induced effect requires a positive charge. We tested whether the large activation of αβγE234C channels by MTSET resulted from a suppression of Na+ self-inhibition by comparing self-inhibition responses before and after MTSET modification. As shown in Fig. 6D, Na+ self-inhibition was reduced greatly but not eliminated. A similar result was observed in oocytes treated with MTSET in the low Na+ bath solution (Fig. 6E), indicating that the introduced Cys was accessible in both a low and high [Na+] bath. These observations suggest that MTSET activated γE234C by primarily suppressing Na+ self-inhibition and thus increasing channel Po, and that MTSET modification under the current experimental conditions was insufficient to eliminate Na+ self-inhibition. If MTSET activates γE234C channels by suppressing Na+ self-inhibition, the expression of γE234C with an additional mutation that eliminates Na+ self-inhibition should blunt the activation by MTSET. We expressed γE234C with additional mutations including γH239R, γR143A-Δ144–186, and βS518K. Mutant mENaCs with γH239R had no Na+ self-inhibition response (5Sheng S. Bruns J.B. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9743-9749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The degeneration mutation βS518K has a Po of ∼1 (20Snyder P.M. Bucher D.B. Olson D.R.

Indeed, we observed no Na+ self- inhibition in oocytes expressing αβS519Kγ mENaC (Iss/Ipeak = 0.95 ± 0.02, n = 4, p < 0.001 versus WT). γR143A-Δ144–"

Type 1 diabetes is a complex disease caused by multiple genetic and environmental factors. Persistent organochlorine pollutants (POPs) have been suggested as a triggering factor for developing childhood type 1 diabetes. The aim of this case-control study was to assess possible impacts of in utero exposure to POPs on type 1 diabetes.The study was performed as a case-control study within a biobank in Malmö, a city located in the Southern part of Sweden. The study included 150 cases (children who had their diagnosis mostly before 18 years of age) and 150 controls, matched for gender and day of birth. 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB-153) and the major DDT metabolite 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis (p-chlorophenyl)-ethylene (p,p'-DDE) were used as a biomarkers for POP exposure. When comparing the quartile with the highest maternal serum concentrations of PCB-153 with the other quartiles, an odds ratio (OR) of 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.42, 1.27) was obtained. Similar results was obtained for p,p'-DDE (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.29, 1.08).The hypothesis that in utero exposure to POPs will trigger the risk for developing type 1 diabetes was not supported by the results. The risk estimates did, although not statistically significant, go in the opposite direction. However, it is not reasonable to believe that exposure to POPs should protect against type 1 diabetes."

IntroductionComplement is an essential component of innate immunity due to its ability to recognize pathogens and to limit infection in the vertebrate host. In addition, activation of the complement system enhances the migration of phagocytic cells to infected areas and stimulates the adaptive immune response (1Duncan R.C. Wijeyewickrema L.C. Pike R.N. Biochimie. 2008; 90: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 2Frank M.M. Fries L.F. Immunol. Today. 1991; 12: 322-326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The initial steps of the complement cascade involve modular proteases that are activated in a sequential manner via one of three pathways: the classic, lectin, and alternative pathways. The classic pathway is triggered by C1, a 790-kDa Ca2+-dependent complex resulting from the association of a recognition protein C1q and a tetramer comprising two copies of the serine proteases C1r and C1s (3Arlaud G.J.

Recognition of targets such as pathogens or immune complexes by the C1q moiety of C1 elicits self-activation of C1r, which in turn converts C1s into its active form. Once activated, C1s specifically cleaves C4 and C2, thereby initiating a series of sequential and highly specific proteolytic reactions leading to the formation of the membrane-attack complex and the elimination of the target. The classic pathway of complement is also involved in immune tolerance due to the ability of C1 to recognize and induce clearance of apoptotic cells and plays a major role in xenograft rejection (7Botto M. Walport M.J. Immunobiology. 2002; 205: 395-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The uncontrolled activation of the complement system, however, can result in self-tissue damages and pathologic inflammation.During the last years, the three-dimensional structure of several fragments of C1r, C1s, and C1q has been solved by x-ray crystallography and other biophysical methods (6Gaboriaud C.

Whereas the CCP1-CCP2-SP regions of C1r and C1s mediate their enzymatic properties, their N-terminal CUB1-EGF segments are involved in the Ca2+-dependent C1r-C1s interactions required for assembly of the C1s-C1r-C1r-C1s tetramer. Available structural data have led to low resolution models of the C1 complex in which C1s-C1r-C1r-C1s (hereafter named the tetramer) adopts a compact conformation when bound to C1q (13Arlaud G.J.

The main ionic interactions between the C1q collagen stems and the tetramer were initially supposed to be mediated by an acidic cluster located in the C1r EGF module (16Gregory L.A. Thielens N.M.

Mutagenesis experiments have recently ruled out this hypothesis (17Bally I. Rossi V. Lunardi T. Thielens N.M. Gaboriaud C. Arlaud G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 19340-19348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and led to a refined three-dimensional model of the C1 complex in which acidic residues involved in the Ca2+-binding sites of the C1r CUB1 and CUB2 and C1s CUB1 modules interact with the C1q stems. Given the location of these sites, the CUB1-EGF-CUB2 interaction domains of C1r and C1s are now proposed to be located entirely inside the cone delimited by the six C1q stems, in sharp contrast with the original model.To gain further information about the assembly and structure of human C1, we have used stable chemical modifications associated with a mass spectrometry-based strategy and a label-free semi-quantitative approach to investigate the changes of surface accessibility taking place in the tetramer upon C1 assembly. Lysine acetylation is one of the most common chemical modifications used to analyze protein complexes (18Chen H. Schuster M.C. Sfyroera G. Geisbrecht B.V. Lambris J.D. J. Am. Soc.

U.S.A. 1992; 89: 5630-5634Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Because these residues are charged, they are likely to occupy solvent-exposed regions of proteins, which makes them excellent candidates to identify protein-protein interactions. In addition, the relatively large number of lysines (146 in total) present in the tetramer and their distribution provide the opportunity to investigate the effects of C1q binding on the whole tetramer structure. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that the C1s interaction domains interact with each other in C1 and provide experimental evidence that the C1s catalytic domains are partly located inside the C1q cone, yielding further insights into C1 architecture.RESULTSMost of our current knowledge about the overall architecture of C1 arises from low resolution studies by electron microscopy and neutron scattering as well as from the crystal structure of C1r and C1s fragments and of the C1q globular heads. The main barriers to solve the whole structure of C1 and decipher the mechanism of its assembly lie in the size of the complex and the fact that it involves non-covalent interactions. To gain access to new structural information about this complex, we used mass spectrometry in association with a stable chemical modification of lysine residues. We chose to investigate the solvent accessibility of lysines in the free and complexed forms of the tetramer for several reasons: (i) these residues are abundant and evenly distributed in the tetramer; (ii) lysine residues are mostly located on the surface of proteins and are therefore ideal candidates for probing protein-protein interfaces; and (iii) unlike C1q, the tetramer does not have an oligomeric organization, which is expected to facilitate identification of the areas of C1r and C1s involved in conformational changes and/or in binding to C1q. In addition, previous studies have shown that chemical modifications of the lysine residues of the tetramer do not prevent assembly of C1 (29Illy C. Thielens N.M. Arlaud G.J. J. Protein Chem. 1993; 12: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).The solvent accessibility of lysine residues was probed by stable chemical modification with the primary amine-specific reagent sulfo-NHS acetate. The free tetramer and the reconstituted C1 complex were both exposed to an excess of reagent, and unlabeled controls were prepared in parallel to calculate the unmodified fraction of each lysine-containing peptide (see below). The labeling was then quenched by decreasing the pH to 3.0 using a TCEP-HCl solution. Following reduction of the disulfide bridges, labeled and unlabeled protein samples were both subjected to proteolysis by pepsin, an acid protease that retains its enzymatic activity under the quenching conditions, i.e. at low pH, low temperature, and high concentration of the reducing agent (30Hamuro Y. Coales S.J. Morrow J.A. Molnar K.S. Tuske S.J. Southern M.R. Griffin P.R. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 1883-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 31Yan X. Zhang H. Watson J. Schimerlik M.I. Deinzer M.L. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2113-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). After proteolysis, pepsin was irreversibly denatured by increasing the pH to 8.0.Effects of C1q Binding on the Lysine Acetylation Pattern of C1rTo validate our approach, it was essential to ensure that the acetylation reaction was carried out under conditions where the integrity of the C1 complex was fully preserved. First, labeling was performed at neutral pH so that the native conformation of C1 was retained. In addition, the activation state of C1 was checked throughout the labeling procedure, considering that C1 is known to undergo spontaneous activation in vitro even without binding to a target (32Ziccardi R.J. J. Immunol. 1982; 128: 2500-2504PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of the complex induces structural changes within the tetramer (9Budayova-Spano M. Grabarse W. Thielens N.M. Hillen H. Lacroix M.

As a result, both activated C1r and C1s proteins comprise two chains linked by a disulfide bridge (Fig. 2A). To evaluate the extent of C1 activation under the experimental conditions used, the complex was incubated at room temperature for 30 min at pH 7.3, this incubation time corresponding to the duration of the whole procedure, except pepsin digestion. As shown in Fig. 2B, a minor fraction of the tetramer was found to be activated in the absence of C1q. This activation mainly occurred during the multiple purification steps required to isolate the tetramer from human plasma. However, the activated fraction of the tetramer did not increase in the C1 complex after incubation for 30 min at room temperature (Fig. 2C), indicating that, under the experimental conditions used, the structural integrity of C1 was preserved throughout the labeling procedure.Thirty-six peptides containing lysine residues were assigned to C1r by LC-MS/MS analysis of the pepsin digests, thus accounting for 25 of the 36 lysines of this protein (Fig. 3A). Residues that were not recovered were mainly located at the C-terminal end of the CCP2 module (Lys419, Lys423, Lys426, and Lys436) and in the SP domain (Lys490, Lys514, and Lys610). To assess the effects of C1q binding on the accessibility of each lysine residue, a statistical Mann and Whitney U test with a two-sided p value of 1% was applied on the 15 independent MS data sets collected. As listed in Table 1, the solvent accessibility of most of the residues located in modules CUB1 and CUB2 remained unchanged upon C1q binding. Interestingly, a single lysine located in the N-terminal part of CUB1 (Fig. 3A) behaved differently. The box-and-whisker diagram of fragment 2–8 revealed that Lys7 is highly exposed in the free tetramer, as only 3% remained unmodified after acetylation (Fig. 3B). This value shifted to ∼23% in the presence of C1q, indicating that Lys7 is partially protected from chemical modification within C1.FIGURE 3Modification of the C1r solvent accessibility upon association of the C1s-C1r-C1r-C1s tetramer with C1q.

Open table in a new tab C1r Lys291 and Lys296 are also fully exposed to the solvent in the free tetramer, with solvent accessibility surface area (SASA) values of 81.2 and 159.0 Å2, respectively. These two residues are located in the N-terminal part of the CCP1 module and are covered by two distinct overlapping peptides 289–300 and 289–301 (Fig. 3, A and C). Surprisingly, the overall acetylation extent of Lys291 and Lys296 in the free tetramer was strikingly different in these peptides: ∼3% of peptide 289–300 remained unacetylated, whereas this value increased to 58% for peptide 289–301 (Fig. 3B). This difference was observed consistently in all experiments, suggesting the presence of two distinct conformations in solution. In addition, the chemical reactivity of both peptides toward the acetylating agent was also significantly different in the presence of C1q. Upon C1 formation, the unmodified fraction of peptide 289–301 remained unchanged, whereas the accessibility of peptide 289–300 slightly decreased (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these observations suggested that the N-terminal end of the C1r CCP1 module exhibits two different conformations, both in the isolated tetramer and in C1.Four other lysines exhibiting reduced solvent accessibility upon C1q binding are also identified in the C1r CCP2 and SP domains. Residues Lys382 and Lys395 are both located in the CCP2 region (Fig. 3C) and were fully exposed to the solvent, as judged by their calculated SASA values of 114.3 Å2 and 145.6 Å2. Upon C1q binding, both lysines became protected from modification, with a 30% increase of their respective unmodified fraction (data not shown). Similar results were observed with Lys452 and Lys454 from the SP domain. As seen in the crystal structure of the proenzyme SP domain, these latter residues are very close to the activation segment of C1r (Fig. 3, A and C) and display similar SASA values (Table 1). When the C1 complex is formed, both lysines become less accessible to the acetylating reagent, with an increase of 20% of their unmodified fraction (Fig. 3B). This result was surprising, because the activation segment contains the susceptible Arg446–Ile447 bond cleaved upon autolytic activation of C1r. Therefore, no major change in the solvent accessibility of this region was expected, considering that this site should remain fully accessible. A possibility is that the activation segment becomes less exposed to the solvent in the resting C1 complex to adopt a conformation inappropriate for C1r self-activation. However, this hypothesis does not appear consistent with previous data indicating that the C1r activation potential is prevented in the free tetramer and restored in C1 (34Thielens N.M. Illy C. Bally I. Arlaud G.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Effects of C1q Binding on the Lysine Acetylation Pattern of C1sWe next investigated the effects of C1 assembly on the acetylation pattern of C1s. As summarized in Fig. 4A, 30 peptic peptides were assigned to C1s by MS/MS, thus accounting for 26 of the 37 lysine residues of the protein. Most of the lysines that were not recovered are clustered in the C-terminal part of the CUB2 module (Lys249, Lys265, Lys266, and Lys269) and in the SP domain (Lys560, Lys568, Lys579, and Lys581). Two lysines exhibiting reduced solvent accessibility in C1 were identified in C1s CUB1 and CUB2. Residues Lys90 (CUB1) and Lys195 (CUB2) appearred fully exposed in the isolated tetramer and became less accessible in the presence of C1q. This effect was particularly striking in the case of Lys90, which showed a 40% increase of its unmodified fraction, thereby becoming virtually inaccessible in C1 (Fig. 4, B and C). A similar overall tendency was observed for the lysine residues located in the CCP1 module, except for Lys281 and Lys338 (Table 2). In contrast to the above observation, the two lysine residues located in CCP2, and the single lysine Lys420 found in the activation segment showed no change in accessibility upon assembly of the C1 complex (Table 2 and supplemental Fig. S2). Lys420 is located in the activation segment of C1s that contains the Arg422–Ile423 bond cleaved upon activation by C1r. The activation segment of C1s thus appears to remain fully accessible in C1, in contrast to our observation in C1r.FIGURE 4Modification of the C1s solvent accessibility upon interaction of the C1s-C1r-C1r-C1s tetramer with C1q.

https://openalex.org/W1967038041,"L3MBTL1, a paralogue of Drosophila tumor suppressor lethal(3)malignant brain tumor (l(3)mbt), binds histones in a methylation state-dependent manner and contributes to higher order chromatin structure and transcriptional repression. It is the founding member of a family of MBT domain-containing proteins that has three members in Drosophila and nine in mice and humans. Knockdown experiments in cell lines suggested that L3MBTL1 has non-redundant roles in the suppression of oncogene expression. We generated a mutant mouse strain that lacks exons 13-20 of L3mbtl1. Markedly reduced levels of a mutant mRNA with an out-of-frame fusion of exons 12 and 21 were expressed, but a mutant protein was undetectable by Western blot analysis. L3MBTL1(-/-) mice developed and reproduced normally. The highest expression of L3MBTL1 was detected in the brain, but its disruption did not affect brain development, spontaneous movement, and motor coordination. Despite previous implications of L3mbtl1 in the biology of hematopoietic transcriptional regulators, lack of L3MBTL1 did not result in deficiencies in lymphopoiesis or hematopoiesis. In contrast with its demonstrated biochemical activities, embryonic stem (ES) cells lacking L3MBTL1 displayed no abnormalities in H4 lysine 20 (H4K20) mono-, di-, or trimethylation; had normal global chromatin density as assessed by micrococcal nuclease digests; and expressed normal levels of c-myc. Embryonic fibroblasts lacking L3MBTL1 displayed unaltered cell cycle arrest and down-regulation of cyclin E expression after irradiation. In cohorts of mice followed for more than 2 years, lack of L3MBTL1 did not alter normal lifespan or survival with or without sublethal irradiation."

IL-8 is a member of the proinflammatory chemokine family that is important for various functions, such as mediating the adhesion of eosinophilic granulocytes onto endothelial cells. The influence of PPARδ activators on the expression of IL-8 in noninduced quiescent endothelial cells is unclear. Therefore, we explored the influence of PPARδ activators on the expression of IL-8 in nonstimulated endothelial cells. PPARδ agonists induce IL-8 expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. This induction is demonstrated at the level of both protein and mRNA expression. Transcriptional activation studies using IL-8 reporter gene constructs and DNA binding assays revealed that PPARδ agonists mediated their effects via an NFκB binding site. It is well known that IL-8 is also regulated by mRNA stability. To provide further evidence for this concept, we performed mRNA stability assays and found that PPARδ agonists induce the mRNA stability of IL-8. In addition, we showed that PPARδ agonists induce the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38, which are known to be involved in the increase of mRNA stability. The inhibition of these MAPK signaling pathways resulted in a significant suppression of the induced IL-8 expression and the reduced mRNA stability.

https://openalex.org/W2058022740,"Cytoskeletal tension is an intracellular mechanism through which cells convert a mechanical signal into a biochemical response, including production of cytokines and activation of various signaling pathways.Adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs) were allowed to spread into large cells by seeding them at a low-density (1,250 cells/cm(2)), which was observed to induce osteogenesis. Conversely, ASCs seeded at a high-density (25,000 cells/cm(2)) featured small cells that promoted adipogenesis. RhoA and actin filaments were altered by changes in cell size. Blocking actin polymerization by Cytochalasin D influenced cytoskeletal tension and differentiation of ASCs. To understand the potential regulatory mechanisms leading to actin cytoskeletal tension, cDNA microarray was performed on large and small ASCs. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) was identified as a major regulator of osteogenesis associated with RhoA mediated cytoskeletal tension. Subsequently, knock-down of CTGF by siRNA in ASCs inhibited this osteogenesis.We conclude that CTGF is important in the regulation of cytoskeletal tension mediated ASC osteogenic differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2093276293,"Erythropoietic and megakaryocytic programs are specified from multipotential progenitors by the transcription factor GATA1. FOG1, a GATA1-interaction partner, is critical for GATA1 function in several contexts by bringing multiple complexes into association with GATA1 to facilitate activation or repression of target genes. To further elucidate regulation of these associations by cellular and extracellular cues, we examined FOG1 for post-translational modifications. We found that FOG1 is SUMOylated and phosphorylated in erythroid cells in a differentiation-dependent manner. Removal of the SUMOylation sites in FOG1 does not impair nuclear localization, protein stability, or chromatin occupancy. However, SUMOylation of FOG1 modulates interactions with C-terminal binding protein family members, specifically promoting CTBP1 binding. Phosphorylation of FOG1 modulates SUMOylation and, therefore, indirectly regulates the CTBP interaction. Post-translational modification of FOG1 may contribute to control of co-occupancy by CTBP family members, the NuRD complex, and GATA1 at differentially regulated genes."

S3Pvac and EG95 are the only field trial-tested vaccine candidates against cysticercosis and hydatidosis, respectively. S3Pvac is composed of three peptides (KETc1, GK1 and KETc12), originally identified in a Taenia crassiceps cDNA library. S3Pvac synthetically and recombinantly expressed is effective against experimentally and naturally acquired cysticercosis.In this study, the homologous sequences of two of the S3Pvac peptides, GK1 and KETc1, were identified and further characterized in Taenia crassiceps WFU, Taenia solium, Taenia saginata, Echinococcus granulosus and Echinococcus multilocularis. Comparisons of the nucleotide and amino acid sequences coding for KETc1 and GK1 revealed significant homologies in these species. The predicted secondary structure of GK1 is almost identical between the species, while some differences were observed in the C terminal region of KETc1 according to 3D modeling. A KETc1 variant with a deletion of three C-terminal amino acids protected to the same extent against experimental murine cysticercosis as the entire peptide. On the contrary, immunization with the truncated GK1 failed to induce protection. Immunolocalization studies revealed the non stage-specificity of the two S3Pvac epitopes and their persistence in the larval tegument of all species and in Taenia adult tapeworms.These results indicate that GK1 and KETc1 may be considered candidates to be included in the formulation of a multivalent and multistage vaccine against these cestodiases because of their enhancing effects on other available vaccine candidates."
https://openalex.org/W1988834631,"Background Placental malaria is a disease linked to the sequestration of Plasmodium falciparum infected red blood cells (IRBC) in the placenta, leading to reduced materno-fetal exchanges and to local inflammation. One of the virulence factors of P. falciparum involved in cytoadherence to chondroitin sulfate A, its placental receptor, is the adhesive protein VAR2CSA. Its localisation on the surface of IRBC makes it accessible to the immune system. VAR2CSA contains six DBL domains. The DBL6ε domain is the most variable. High variability constitutes a means for the parasite to evade the host immune response. The DBL6ε domain could constitute a very attractive basis for a vaccine candidate but its reported variability necessitates, for antigenic characterisations, identifying and classifying commonalities across isolates. Methodology/Principal Findings Local alignment analysis of the DBL6ε domain had revealed that it is not as variable as previously described. Variability is concentrated in seven regions present on the surface of the DBL6ε domain. The main goal of our work is to classify and group variable sequences that will simplify further research to determine dominant epitopes. Firstly, variable sequences were grouped following their average percent pairwise identity (APPI). Groups comprising many variable sequences sharing low variability were found. Secondly, ELISA experiments following the IgG recognition of a recombinant DBL6ε domain, and of peptides mimicking its seven variable blocks, allowed to determine an APPI cut-off and to isolate groups represented by a single consensus sequence. Conclusions/Significance A new sequence approach is used to compare variable regions in sequences that have extensive segmental gene relationship. Using this approach, the VAR2CSA DBL6 domain is composed of 7 variable blocks with limited polymorphism. Each variable block is composed of a limited number of consensus types. Based on peptide based ELISA, variable blocks with 85% or greater sequence identity are expected to be recognized equally well by antibody and can be considered the same consensus type. Therefore, the analysis of the antibody response against the classified small number of sequences should be helpful to determine epitopes."

TRPM8 is basically gated in a voltage-dependent process enhanced by cold temperatures and cooling compounds such as menthol and icilin. The putative S4 voltage sensor of TRPM8 is closely similar to that of TRPM2, which, however, is mostly devoid of voltage sensitivity. To gain insight into principal interactions of critical channel domains during the gating process, we created chimeras in which the entire S5-pore-S6 domains were reciprocally exchanged. The chimera M2-M8P (i.e. TRPM2 with the pore of TRPM8) responded to ADP-ribose and hydrogen peroxide and was regulated by extracellular and intracellular Ca2+ as was wild-type TRPM2. Single-channel recordings revealed the characteristic pattern of TRPM2 with extremely long open times. Only at far-negative membrane potentials (−120 to −140 mV) did differences become apparent because currents were reduced by hyperpolarization in M2-M8P but not in TRPM2. The reciprocal chimera, M8-M2P, showed currents after stimulation with high concentrations of menthol and icilin, but these currents were only slightly larger than in controls. The transfer of the NUDT9 domain to the C terminus of TRPM8 produced a channel sensitive to cold, menthol, or icilin but insensitive to ADP-ribose or hydrogen peroxide. We conclude that the gating processes in TRPM2 and TRPM8 differ in their requirements for specific structures within the pore.

https://openalex.org/W2056073729,"Transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) is a member of the NF-κB pathway and regulates inflammatory responses. We previously showed that TAK1 also regulates keratinocyte growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. However, it is unknown whether TAK1 has any role in epithelial–mesenchymal interactions. To examine this possibility, we studied the role of TAK1 in mouse hair follicle development and cycling as an instructive model system. By comparing keratinocyte-specific TAK1-deficient mice (Map3k7fl/flK5-Cre) with control mice, we found that the number of hair germs (hair follicles precursors) in Map3k7fl/flK5-Cre mice was significantly reduced at E15.5, and that subsequent hair follicle morphogenesis was retarded. Next, we analyzed the role of TAK1 in the cyclic remodeling in follicles by analyzing hair cycle progression in mice with a tamoxifen-inducible keratinocyte-specific TAK1 deficiency (Map3k7fl/flK14-Cre-ERT2). After active hair growth (anagen) was induced by depilation, TAK1 was deleted by topical tamoxifen application. This resulted in significantly retarded anagen development in TAK1-deficient mice. Deletion of TAK1 in hair follicles that were already in anagen induced premature, apoptosis-driven hair follicle regression, along with hair follicle damage. These studies provide the first evidence that the inflammatory mediator TAK1 regulates hair follicle induction and morphogenesis, and is required for anagen induction and anagen maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W1963649327,"The O chain polysaccharide (O PS) of Bordetella bronchiseptica and Bordetella parapertussis lipopolysaccharide is a homopolymer of 2,3-diacetamido-2,3-dideoxygalacturonic acid (GalNAc3NAcA) in which some of the sugars are present as uronamides. The terminal residue contains several unusual modifications. To date, two types of modification have been characterized, and a survey of numerous strains demonstrated that each contained one of these two modification types. Host antibody responses against the O PS are directed against the terminal residue modifications, and there is little cross-reactivity between the two types. This suggests that Bordetella O PS modifications represent a means of antigenic variation. Here we report the characterization of the O PS of B. bronchiseptica strain MO149. It consists of a novel two-sugar repeating unit and a novel terminal residue modification, with the structure Me-4-α-l-GalNAc3NAcA-(4-β-d-GlcNAc3NAcA-4-α-l-GalNAc3NAcA-)5–6-, which we propose be defined as the B. bronchiseptica O3 PS. We show that the O3 PS is very poorly immunogenic and that the MO149 strain contains a novel wbm (O PS biosynthesis) locus. Thus, there is greater diversity among Bordetella O PSs than previously recognized, which is likely to be a result of selection pressure from host immunity. We also determine experimentally, for the first time, the absolute configuration of the diacetimido-uronic acid sugars in Bordetella O PS. The O chain polysaccharide (O PS) of Bordetella bronchiseptica and Bordetella parapertussis lipopolysaccharide is a homopolymer of 2,3-diacetamido-2,3-dideoxygalacturonic acid (GalNAc3NAcA) in which some of the sugars are present as uronamides. The terminal residue contains several unusual modifications. To date, two types of modification have been characterized, and a survey of numerous strains demonstrated that each contained one of these two modification types. Host antibody responses against the O PS are directed against the terminal residue modifications, and there is little cross-reactivity between the two types. This suggests that Bordetella O PS modifications represent a means of antigenic variation. Here we report the characterization of the O PS of B. bronchiseptica strain MO149. It consists of a novel two-sugar repeating unit and a novel terminal residue modification, with the structure Me-4-α-l-GalNAc3NAcA-(4-β-d-GlcNAc3NAcA-4-α-l-GalNAc3NAcA-)5–6-, which we propose be defined as the B. bronchiseptica O3 PS. We show that the O3 PS is very poorly immunogenic and that the MO149 strain contains a novel wbm (O PS biosynthesis) locus. Thus, there is greater diversity among Bordetella O PSs than previously recognized, which is likely to be a result of selection pressure from host immunity. We also determine experimentally, for the first time, the absolute configuration of the diacetimido-uronic acid sugars in Bordetella O PS. IntroductionThe genus Bordetella currently comprises nine species of Gram-negative bacteria. The most extensively studied of these are the pathogens Bordetella pertussis, Bordetella parapertussis, and Bordetella bronchiseptica. B. pertussis infects only humans and is the causative agent of whooping cough in infants and persistent respiratory infections in adults (1Cherry J.D. J. Infect. Dis. 1996; 174: S259-S263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). B. parapertussis exists as two separate lineages. One is adapted to the human host and causes whooping cough; the other is adapted to the ovine host, in which it can cause chronic pneumonia (2Porter J.F. Connor K. Donachie W. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 3Heininger U. Stehr K. Schmitt-Grohé S. Lorenz C. Rost R. Christenson P.D. Uberall M. Cherry J.D. Pediatr. Infect. Dis. J. 1994; 13: 306-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In contrast, B. bronchiseptica colonizes the respiratory tract of a large number of animals, and although it causes respiratory diseases in some farm, companion, and wild animals, most B. bronchiseptica infections are asymptomatic and chronic (4Goodnow R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1980; 44: 722-738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). B. bronchiseptica is occasionally isolated from the respiratory tract of humans and is probably acquired through contact with infected animals (5Gueirard P. Weber C. Le Coustumier A. Guiso N. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1995; 33: 2002-2006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Bordetella lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plays a number of different roles in Bordetella biology, including during infection (e.g. see Refs. 6Zhang X. Goebel E.M. Rodríguez M.E. Preston A. Harvill E.T. Infect. Immun. 2009; 77: 5050-5058Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 7Zhang X. Rodríguez M.E. Harvill E.T.

Immun. 2000; 68: 6720-6728Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We and others have defined the structures of the LPS of these Bordetella (Fig. 1). All three synthesize a very similar LPS core. In B. bronchiseptica and B. pertussis, the core can be further substituted by a trisaccharide to produce the structure referred to as Band A LPS (10Peppler M.S. Infect. Immun. 1984; 43: 224-232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Caroff M. Brisson J. Martin A. Karibian D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). B. parapertussis and B. bronchiseptica, but not B. pertussis, synthesize O PSs. 2The abbreviations used are: O PSO chain polysaccharideGalNAc3NAcA2,3-diacetamido-2,3-dideoxygalacturonic acidHFhydrofluoric acidManNAc3NAcA2,3-diacetamido-2,3-dideoxymannuronic acidGlcNAc3NAcA2,3-diacetamido-2,3-dideoxy-glucuronic acidSDRshort chain dehydrogenase/reductaseaaamino acid(s)TricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. Initially, the O PSs of both species were reported to be identical and composed of linear polymers of 1,4-linked GalNAc3NAcA (12Di Fabio J.L. Caroff M. Karibian D. Richards J.C. Perry M.B. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 76: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), but later it was discovered that the terminal residue contained a number of modifications, that these modifications can vary between strains (13Vinogradov E. Peppler M.S. Perry M.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 7230-7237Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and that the O PS polymer is linked to the rest of the LPS molecule via an unusual 5-sugar linker (14Preston A. Petersen B.O.

To date, two types of modification, O1 and O2, have been described (13Vinogradov E. Peppler M.S. Perry M.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 7230-7237Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 15Buboltz A.M. Nicholson T.L. Karanikas A.T. Preston A. Harvill E.T. Infect. Immun. 2009; 77: 3249-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). O1 and O2 PSs both contain 2,3,4-triamino-2,3,4-trideoxy-α-galacturonamide derivatives at their non-reducing ends. In O1 PS, this residue is formylated at positions 3 and 4 and has N-formyl-l-alanyl or l-alanyl substituents at N-2. In O2 PS, the amino group at position 2 is acetylated, at position 3 it is formylated, and at position 4 it is modified with a 2-methoxypropionyl substituent. Importantly, antibody responses to O PS appear to be wholly directed against the modified terminal residue because antisera raised against O1 type O PS did not recognize O2 type O PSs and vice versa, and in mice, immunization with LPS of one type did not confer protection against strains with the other type (15Buboltz A.M. Nicholson T.L. Karanikas A.T. Preston A. Harvill E.T. Infect. Immun. 2009; 77: 3249-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This suggests that Bordetella O PSs display antigenic variation in order to help evade cross-reaction with existing immunity within hosts.We have also studied the genetics of O PS biosynthesis (14Preston A.

B. bronchiseptica and B. parapertussis each contain a locus, wbm, containing 24 genes that is responsible for biosynthesis of the linker, polymer repeat, modifications of the terminal residue, and export of the O PS from the cytoplasm. We proposed that the central region of the wbm locus contains the genes that direct biosynthesis of the terminal residue modifications, and supporting this, the gene content of this region correlates with the modification type (14Preston A. Petersen B.O. Duus J.Ø. Kubler-Kielb J. Ben-Menachem G. Li J. Vinogradov E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18135-18144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A number of studies have used postgenomic technologies to investigate genetic diversity among the Bordetella (17Cummings C.A. Brinig M.M. Lepp P.W. van de Pas S. Relman D.A. J Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1484-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 18Diavatopoulos D.A. Cummings C.A. Schouls L.M. Brinig M.M. Relman D.A. Mooi F.R. PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). From these, the wbm locus emerged as one of the very few loci that exhibited clear variability among strains. In particular, these studies described a group of B. bronchiseptica strains (named Complex IV) that appeared more closely related to the human-restricted pathogen B. pertussis than other B. bronchiseptica. A majority of these B. bronchiseptica strains were isolated from cases of disease in humans and are thought to represent a lineage of human-adapted B. bronchiseptica (18Diavatopoulos D.A. Cummings C.A. Schouls L.M. Brinig M.M. Relman D.A. Mooi F.R. PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Using comparative genomic hybridization analyses, Complex IV strains appeared to contain polymorphic wbm loci (18Diavatopoulos D.A. Cummings C.A. Schouls L.M. Brinig M.M. Relman D.A. Mooi F.R. PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). By these analyses, MO149 was identified as a B. bronchiseptica strain that expressed an O PS but contained homologues of just three previously characterized wbm genes, suggesting that it contained a novel wbm locus.In this report, we describe a novel O PS structure for strain MO149, confirm that it contains a novel wbm locus, and demonstrate that its O PS is very poorly immunogenic compared with type O1 or O2 O PSs. Our data support proposals that the wbm locus is one of the few regions of the Bordetella genome that undergoes extensive recombination and/or lateral gene transfer (15Buboltz A.M. Nicholson T.L. Karanikas A.T. Preston A. Harvill E.T. Infect. Immun. 2009; 77: 3249-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 18Diavatopoulos D.A. Cummings C.A. Schouls L.M. Brinig M.M. Relman D.A. Mooi F.R. PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), that a greater number of O PS structures exist in the Bordetella population than was previously thought, and suggest that escape from host immunity might be a driver for the generation of this diversity.DISCUSSIONPrevious analyses suggested that many B. bronchiseptica strains had either O1 or O2 type O PSs (15Buboltz A.M. Nicholson T.L. Karanikas A.T. Preston A. Harvill E.T. Infect. Immun. 2009; 77: 3249-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and that variation among B. bronchiseptica and B. parapertussis O PS occurred at the terminal residue with the polymer backbone being highly conserved among strains (13Vinogradov E. Peppler M.S. Perry M.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 7230-7237Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 14Preston A. Petersen B.O. Duus J.Ø. Kubler-Kielb J. Ben-Menachem G. Li J. Vinogradov E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18135-18144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). One other variant O-antigen locus had been described, for the ovine B. parapertussis strain BPP5 (34Brinig M.M. Cummings C.A. Sanden G.N. Stefanelli P. Lawrence A. Relman D.A. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2375-2382Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Its wbm locus resembles that of the human B. parapertussis strain 12822 except for the presence of single nucleotide frameshift mutations in three genes, the absence of a wbmE and a wbmK homologue, and the presence of a unique methyltransferase-encoding gene. However, it is not known if this strain synthesizes an O-antigen or if these genetic differences lead to the biosynthesis of a different O PS. Our findings demonstrate that at least one other O PS type exists, that the extent of variability among wbm loci is greater than previously thought, and that variability is not confined to the terminal residue.Previously, we described the B. bronchiseptica RB50 and B. parapertussis 12822 wbm loci as being composed of a variable central portion that contained genes involved in synthesis of the strain variable terminal residue modifications flanked by highly conserved genes involved in synthesis of the highly conserved linker-polymer region (14Preston A. Petersen B.O. Duus J.Ø. Kubler-Kielb J. Ben-Menachem G. Li J. Vinogradov E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18135-18144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). B. parapertussis BPP5 wbm also conforms to this model, containing the unique methlytransferase gene and other medium conserved genes flanked by very highly conserved wbm homologues. All of the MO149 wbm genes display homology to RB50 and/or 12822 wbm genes except for the putative methyltransferase that we propose as the sole terminal residue modification function in this locus. However, the gene arrangement in the MO149 locus is very different from that of the 12822/RB50 loci (Fig. 5), including multiple differences in regions that we had previously described as being part of the highly conserved flanking regions of the Bordetella wbm locus. The MO149 locus shows nearly complete DNA identity with the RB50/12822 loci at both ends, but there are clearly visible points at which divergence begins. At one end, this are 13 bp upstream of the wbmC stop codon (Fig. 7), resulting in MO149 WbmC containing a different C-terminal 5 amino acids compared with RB50/12822 WbmC, and at the other end it is 21 bp upstream of the BB0120 homologue start codon (Fig. 7), suggesting that in MO149, the BB0120 homologue may have a different promoter compared with RB50/12822 strains.FIGURE 7Alignment of the conserved ends of B. bronchiseptica RB50 and MO149 wbm loci.

The WbmC stop codons and BB0120 start codons are boxed in order to show the positions of these junctions relative to protein coding sequences.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Bordetella genomes have relatively high GC content genomes (Table 3). In all of the Bordetella strains for which sequence information is available, the GC contents of their wbm loci are considerably lower than their overall genome GC contents (Table 3). Interestingly, the variable regions have a lower GC content than the relatively conserved wbmA to -C genes, which in turn have a GC content different from either the variable region or the overall genome average. Even in the relatively distantly related Bordetella, Bordetella avium and Bordetella petrii, the wbm loci have low GC contents. These loci have not been functionally characterized but were designated as the wbm loci for these analyses on the basis that they are adjacent to the wlb locus in each strain and contain genes that encode proteins that are homologous to other O-antigen biosynthesis enzymes.TABLE 3The GC contents of Bordetella genomes compared with their wbm lociStrainGC content of genomeGC content of variable region of wbm locusGC content of wbmA to -C%%%B. bronchiseptica RB5068.0757.9864.64B. bronchiseptica M014968.4158.2164.85B. bronchiseptica 25367.6258.6464.57B. parapertussis 1282268.1058.6264.43B. parapertussis BPP567.8159.264.44B. avium 19761.5855aThe genes BAV0081–BAV0089, adjacent to the B. avium wlb locus and displaying homology to other O-antigen biosynthesis genes, were used as comprising the O-antigen biosynthesis locus in this strain.AbsentB. petrii DSMZ1280465.4856.24bThe genes BPE4829–BPE4837, adjacent to the B. petrii wlb locus and displaying homology to other O-antigen biosynthesis genes, were used as comprising the O-antigen biosynthesis locus in this strain.Absenta The genes BAV0081–BAV0089, adjacent to the B. avium wlb locus and displaying homology to other O-antigen biosynthesis genes, were used as comprising the O-antigen biosynthesis locus in this strain.b The genes BPE4829–BPE4837, adjacent to the B. petrii wlb locus and displaying homology to other O-antigen biosynthesis genes, were used as comprising the O-antigen biosynthesis locus in this strain. Open table in a new tab Low GC content is one of the signatures of horizontally acquired DNA. We propose that the Bordetella wbm loci are genomic islands, although they lack any obvious DNA mobility functions that are often associated with genomic islands. In the mammalian-adapted Bordetella, these islands are integrated at a highly conserved site and in all Bordetella are situated immediately adjacent to the wlb LPS biosynthesis locus. Our findings suggest that a repertoire of wbm genomic islands exists among the Bordetellae, conferring variability to the O PS of Bordetella LPS.There is little cross-reactivity between antibody responses generated to the previously characterized O1 and O2 PS (Fig. 6) (15Buboltz A.M. Nicholson T.L. Karanikas A.T. Preston A. Harvill E.T. Infect. Immun. 2009; 77: 3249-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This suggests that O PS diversity might represent a means of antigenic variation that allows escape from preexisting host immunity. The poor immunogenicity of MO149 PS suggests that some strains of B. bronchiseptica employ a different means by which they escape host immunity by avoiding the generation of strong anti-O PS responses. It is interesting that B. bronchiseptica MO149 is a Complex IV strain that was isolated from infection in a human. Complex IV strains are proposed to be more closely related to the human-adapted B. pertussis than they are to Complex I B. bronchiseptica strains that have been isolated mainly from non-human sources (18Diavatopoulos D.A. Cummings C.A. Schouls L.M. Brinig M.M. Relman D.A. Mooi F.R. PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). B. pertussis does not express O PS because the wbm locus has been deleted from seemingly all B. pertussis strains (17Cummings C.A. Brinig M.M. Lepp P.W. van de Pas S. Relman D.A. J Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1484-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). It is hypothesized that B. pertussis evolved from a human-adapted B. bronchiseptica (or B. bronchiseptica-like) ancestor and that avoidance of existing anti-B. bronchiseptica immunity in the human host was key to its emergence in this niche (18Diavatopoulos D.A. Cummings C.A. Schouls L.M. Brinig M.M. Relman D.A. Mooi F.R. PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Loss of expression of highly immunogenic O PS was probably part of this avoidance. The O PS confers protection on B. bronchiseptica against host immune mechanisms, such as complement-mediated killing (20Burns V.C. Pishko E.J. Preston A. Maskell D.J. Harvill E.T. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), but B. pertussis appears to have evolved alternative protection mechanisms to compensate for the loss of O PS. Previously, analysis of the gene content of a large number of B. bronchiseptica strains identified the O1 or O2 wbm locus in all non-Complex IV strains studied. However, 4 of 13 Complex IV strains contained variant loci, including apparent deletions that abrogated expression of the Band A/O PS LPS (18Diavatopoulos D.A. Cummings C.A. Schouls L.M. Brinig M.M. Relman D.A. Mooi F.R. PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that avoidance of a strong anti-O PS host immune response, either through a poorly immunogenic O PS, such as O3, or absence of O PS expression, is required for B. bronchiseptica strains to exist in human hosts and that this generates selection pressure for the generation of O PS diversity that appears to be a feature among Complex IV B. bronchiseptica strains (18Diavatopoulos D.A. Cummings C.A. Schouls L.M. Brinig M.M. Relman D.A. Mooi F.R. PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we have identified the O3 wbm cluster in a number of Complex IV strains but not in any of 96 Complex I strains analyzed, suggesting that the O3 PS is specific to Complex IV and thus either advantageous for some aspect of Complex IV biology or selected against in Complex I strains. 5S. Hester, L. Goodfield, and E. Harvill, manuscript in preparation. Interestingly, anti-MO149 recognized Band A LPS but gave a strong signal in Western blots only from strains deleted for wbm although MO149 and WT 1289 appeared to express high levels of Band A LPS. This suggests that the presence of O PS appears to reduce recognition of Band A LPS by anti-MO149 antisera. Thus, the wbm locus might modify Band A LPS in some subtle way that prevents efficient antibody binding. In turn, this could result in anti-MO149 antibodies recognizing B. pertussis that expresses high levels of Band A LPS, which would be unmodified due to the loss of wbm from B. pertussis and possibly result in cross-species immunity that would help eliminate B. pertussis from human hosts and promote survival of B. bronchiseptica strains in this niche. It is evident that the role of O PS in Bordetella infection is not yet fully understood. IntroductionThe genus Bordetella currently comprises nine species of Gram-negative bacteria. The most extensively studied of these are the pathogens Bordetella pertussis, Bordetella parapertussis, and Bordetella bronchiseptica.

B. bronchiseptica and B. parapertussis each contain a locus, wbm, containing 24 genes that is responsible for biosynthesis of the linker, polymer repeat, modifications of the terminal residue, and export of the O PS from the cytoplasm. We proposed that the central region of the wbm locus contains the genes that direct biosynthesis of the terminal residue modifications, and supporting this, the gene content of this region correlates with the modification type (14Preston A.

A number of studies have used postgenomic technologies to investigate genetic diversity among the Bordetella (17Cummings C.A. Brinig M.M. Lepp P.W. van de Pas S. Relman D.A.

In particular, these studies described a group of B. bronchiseptica strains (named Complex IV) that appeared more closely related to the human-restricted pathogen B. pertussis than other B. bronchiseptica. A majority of these B. bronchiseptica strains were isolated from cases of disease in humans and are thought to represent a lineage of human-adapted B. bronchiseptica (18Diavatopoulos D.A.

This study evaluated the effect of matching/mismatching vaccine strains, type/subtype pattern changes in Taiwan's influenza viruses, and the impact of post-SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) public health efforts on excess influenza-associated mortalities among the elderly. A negative binomial model was developed to estimate Taiwan's monthly influenza-associated mortality among the elderly. We calculated three winter and annual excess influenza-associated mortalities [pneumonia and influenza (P&I), respiratory and circulatory, and all-cause] from the 1999-2000 through the 2006-2007 influenza seasons. Obtaining influenza virus sequences from the months/years in which death from P&I was excessive, we investigated molecular variation in vaccine-mismatched influenza viruses by comparing hemagglutinin 1 (HA1) of the circulating and vaccine strains. We found that the higher the isolation rate of A (H3N2) and vaccine-mismatched influenza viruses, the greater the monthly P&I mortality. However, this significant positive association became negative for higher matching of A (H3N2) and public health efforts with post-SARS effect. Mean excess P&I mortality for winters was significantly higher before 2003 than after that year [mean +/- S.D.: 1.44+/-1.35 vs. 0.35+/-1.13, p = 0.04]. Further analysis revealed that vaccine-matched circulating influenza A viruses were significantly associated with lower excess P&I mortality during post-SARS winters (i.e., 2005-2007) than during pre-SARS winters [0.03+/-0.06 vs. 1.57+/-1.27, p = 0.01]. Stratification of these vaccine-matching and post-SARS effect showed substantial trends toward lower elderly excess P&I mortalities in winters with either mismatching vaccines during the post-SARS period or matching vaccines during the pre-SARS period. Importantly, all three excess mortalities were at their highest in May, 2003, when inter-hospital nosocomial infections were peaking. Furthermore, vaccine-mismatched H3N2 viruses circulating in the years with high excess P&I mortality exhibited both a lower amino acid identity percentage of HA1 between vaccine and circulating strains and a higher numbers of variations at epitope B. Our model can help future decision makers to estimate excess P&I mortality effectively, select and test virus strains for antigenic variation, and evaluate public health strategy effectiveness."
