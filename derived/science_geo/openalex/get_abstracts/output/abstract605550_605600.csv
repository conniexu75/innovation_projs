As the nitrogen weakly shares its own electrons, some electrons from the metal reach back out to it. Nonmetals would not seem to have the capacity for this type of bonding, but now Légaré et al. show that conventionally electron-deficient boron can be coaxed into it (see the Perspective by Broere and Holland). The authors treated boron-based precursors with potassium under a nitrogen atmosphere to produce several compounds with sandwiched dinitrogen between two boron centers in reduced motifs reminiscent of metal complexes.

Condensin has been shown to exhibit a DNA-translocating motor function, but extrusion has not been observed directly. Using single-molecule imaging, Ganji et al. visualized in real time a condensin-mediated, adenosine triphosphate-dependent, fast DNA loop extrusion process. Loop extrusion occurred asymmetrically, with condensin reeling in only one end of the DNA. These data provide unambiguous evidence of a loop extrusion mechanism for chromosome organization.

Kroodsma et al. took advantage of the automatic identification system installed on all industrial fishing vessels to map and quantify fishing efforts across the world (see the Perspective by Poloczanska). More than half of the world's oceans are subject to industrial-scale harvest, spanning an area four times that covered by terrestrial agriculture. Furthermore, fishing efforts seem not to depend on economic or environmental drivers, but rather social and political schedules. Thus, more active measures will likely be needed to ensure sustainable use of ocean resources. Science , this issue p. 904 ; see also p. 864"
https://openalex.org/W2788480107,"The great escape Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a potent damage-associated molecular pattern that, if it reaches the cytoplasm or extracellular milieu, triggers innate immune pathways. mtDNA signaling has been implicated in a wide range of diseases; however, the mechanisms of mtDNA release are unclear, and the process has not been observed in real time thus far. McArthur et al. used live-cell lattice light-sheet microscopy to look at mtDNA release during intrinsic apoptosis. Activation of the pro-death proteins BAK and BAX resulted in the formation of large macro-pores in the mitochondrial outer membrane. These massive holes caused the inner mitochondrial membrane to balloon out into the cytoplasm, resulting in mitochondrial herniation. This process allowed the contents of the mitochondrial matrix, including mtDNA, to escape into the cytoplasm. Science , this issue p. eaao6047"
https://openalex.org/W2739057358,"Light detection and ranging (LIDAR) is critical to many fields in science and industry. Over the last decade, optical frequency combs were shown to offer unique advantages in optical ranging, in particular when it comes to fast distance acquisition with high accuracy. However, current comb-based concepts are not suited for emerging high-volume applications such as drone navigation or autonomous driving. These applications critically rely on LIDAR systems that are not only accurate and fast, but also compact, robust, and amenable to cost-efficient mass-production. Here we show that integrated dissipative Kerr-soliton (DKS) comb sources provide a route to chip-scale LIDAR systems that combine sub-wavelength accuracy and unprecedented acquisition speed with the opportunity to exploit advanced photonic integration concepts for wafer-scale mass production. In our experiments, we use a pair of free-running DKS combs, each providing more than 100 carriers for massively parallel synthetic-wavelength interferometry. We demonstrate dual-comb distance measurements with record-low Allan deviations down to 12 nm at averaging times of 14 $\mu$s as well as ultrafast ranging at unprecedented measurement rates of up to 100 MHz. We prove the viability of our technique by sampling the naturally scattering surface of air-gun projectiles flying at 150 m/s (Mach 0.47). Combining integrated dual-comb LIDAR engines with chip-scale nanophotonic phased arrays, the approach could allow widespread use of compact ultrafast ranging systems in emerging mass applications."
https://openalex.org/W2614394993,"Laser-based range measurement systems (LIDAR) are important in many application areas including autonomous vehicles, robotics, manufacturing, formation-flying of satellites, and basic science. Coherent laser ranging systems using dual frequency combs provide an unprecedented combination of long range, high precision and fast update rate. Here, dual-comb distance measurement using chip-based soliton microcombs is demonstrated. Moreover, the dual frequency combs are generated within a single microresonator as counter-propating solitons using a single pump laser. Time-of-flight measurement with 200 nm precision at 500 ms averaging time is demonstrated. Also, the dual comb method extends the ambiguity distance to 26 km despite a soliton spatial period of only 16 mm. This chip-based source is an important step towards miniature dual-comb laser ranging systems that are suitable for photonic integration."

We develop a mid-infrared hyperbolic metasurface by nanostructuring a thin layer of hexagonal boron nitride supporting deep subwavelength-scale phonon polaritons that propagate with in-plane hyperbolic dispersion. By applying an infrared nanoimaging technique, we visualize the concave (anomalous) wavefronts of a diverging polariton beam, which represent a landmark feature of hyperbolic polaritons. The results illustrate how near-field microscopy can be applied to reveal the exotic wavefronts of polaritons in anisotropic materials, and demonstrate that nanostructured van der Waals materials can form a highly variable and compact platform for hyperbolic infrared metasurface devices and circuits."

Mi et al. used single-cell transcriptomics to investigate when these subtypes emerge during interneuron development in the mouse. Transcriptomes of embryonic interneurons showed similarities to adult classes of differentiated interneurons, thus dividing the immature embryonic interneurons themselves into classes. Nearly a dozen classes of embryonic neurons could be identified soon after their last mitosis by transcriptomic similarity with known classes of adult cortical interneurons. Thus, the fate of embryonic interneurons can be read in their transcriptomes well before the neurons migrate and reach their final sites of differentiation and circuit integration.

https://openalex.org/W2618967021,"Even though the evolution of an isolated quantum system is unitary, the complexity of interacting many-body systems prevents the observation of recurrences of quantum states for all but the smallest systems. For large systems one can not access the full complexity of the quantum states and the requirements to observe a recurrence in experiments reduces to being close to the initial state with respect to the employed observable. Selecting an observable connected to the collective excitations in one-dimensional superfluids, we demonstrate recurrences of coherence and long range order in an interacting quantum many-body system containing thousands of particles. This opens up a new window into the dynamics of large quantum systems even after they reached a transient thermal-like state."

Nevertheless, there remains limited comparable evidence across multiple countries and regions regarding the global extent of climate shocks affecting smallholder food security. We examine data from 5,299 household surveys across 15 countries in Latin America, Africa and South Asia to assess the extent of climate shocks and their association with food insecurity, as well as what strategies may help buffer against climate shocks. We find that 71% of households reported experiencing a climate shock in the previous five years. Fifty-four percent reported experiencing food insecurity during one or more months annually. A multilevel statistical model estimated factors correlated with food insecurity as well as factors correlated with food insecurity among households that had experienced a climate shock. Households that reported experiencing a climate shock were 1.73 times more likely to be food insecure. As well, larger and poorer households were associated with higher odds of food insecurity while using pesticides, keeping large livestock, and being more educated are associated with lower odds of food insecurity. Among households that had experienced a climate shock, additional factors are correlated with lower odds of food insecurity when compared to otherwise similar households: use of fertilizers, pesticides, veterinary medicines, large livestock, and household assets. Together, these results demonstrate the extent of existing climate shocks affecting smallholder farmers and how interventions may potentially support adaptation and reduce food insecurity."

Evidence has begun to accumulate suggesting that old, carbon-rich water accumulated at depth in the Southern Ocean, which then released its charge when Southern Ocean stratification broke down as the climate there warmed. Basak et al. present measurements of neodymium isotopes that clearly show that the deepwater column of the glacial southern South Pacific was stratified, just as would be necessary for the accumulation of old, carbon-rich water.

When the gene for a self-assembling protein duplicates, it might be expected that the related proteins (paralogs) would retain interfaces that would allow coassembly. Hochberg et al. show that the majority of paralogs that oligomerize in fact self-assemble. These paralogs have more diverse functions than those that coassemble, implying that maintaining coassembly would constrain evolution of new function. The authors experimentally investigated how two oligomeric small heat-shock protein paralogs avoid coassembly and found that flexibility at regions outside of the interaction interfaces played a key role.

https://openalex.org/W2792686376,"Mobile phones have a large spectrum of applications, aiding in risk prevention and improving health and wellbeing of their owners. So far, however, they have not been used for direct assessment of personal exposure to air pollution. In this study, we comprehensively evaluated the first, and the only available, mobile phone—BROAD Life—equipped with air pollution sensors (PM2.5 and VOC), to answer the question whether this technology is a viable option in the quest of reducing the burden of disease to air pollution. We tested its performance, applicability and suitability for the purpose by subjecting it to varied concentrations of different types of aerosol particles (cigarette smoke, petrol exhaust and concrete dust) and formaldehyde under controlled laboratory conditions, as well as to ambient particles during field measurements. Six reference instruments were used in the study: AEROTRAK Optical Particle Counter (OPC model number 9306), DustTrak, Aerodynamic Particle Counter (APS), Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS), Tapered Element Oscillating Microbalance (TEOM) and Formaldehyde Analyser. Overall, we found that the phone’s response was linear at higher particle number concentrations in the chamber, above 5 and 10 μg m-3, for combustion and concrete dust particles, respectively, and for higher formaldehyde concentrations, making it potentially suitable for applications in polluted environments. At lower ambient concentrations of particles around 10 ug m-3 and 20 μg m-3 for PM2.5 and PM10, respectively, the phone’s response was below its noise level, suggesting that it is not suitable for ambient monitoring under relatively clean urban conditions. This mobile phone has a number of limitations that may hinder its use in personal exposure and for continuous monitoring. Despite these limitations, it may be used for comparative assessments, for example when comparing outcomes of intervention measures or local impacts of air pollution sources. It should be kept in mind, however, that a mobile phone measuring air quality alone cannot as such 'reduce the burden of disease to air pollution, as knowing ambient concentrations is only one of the building block in this quest. As long as individuals cannot avoid exposure e.g. in urban areas, knowing concentrations is not sufficient to reduce potential adverse effects. Yet, there are many situations and microenvironments, which individuals could avoid knowing the concentrations and also being aware of the risk caused by exposure to them. This includes for example to proximity to vehicle emissions, either for social purposes (e.g. street cafes) or exercising (e.g. walking or jogging along busy roads)or indoor environments affected by combustion emissions (smoking, candle burning, open fire)."
https://openalex.org/W2791380403,"Although socioeconomic inequalities in health have long been observed in Europe, few studies have analysed their recent patterning. In this paper, we examined how educational inequalities in self-reported health have evolved in different European countries and welfare state regimes over the last decade, which was troubled by the Great Recession.We used cross-sectional data from the EU-SILC survey for adults from 26 European countries, from 2005 to 2014 (n = 3,030,595). We first calculated education-related absolute (SII) and relative (RII) inequalities in poor self-reported health by country-year, adjusting for age, sex, and EU-SILC survey weights. We then regressed the year- and country-specific RII and SII on a yearly time trend, globally and by welfare regime, adjusting for country fixed effects. We further adjusted the analysis for the economic cycle using GDP growth, unemployment, and income inequality.Overall, absolute inequalities persisted and relative inequalities slightly widened (betaRII = 0.0313, p<0.05). There were substantial differences by welfare regime: Anglo-Saxon countries experienced the largest increase in absolute inequalities (betaSII = 0.0032, p<0.05), followed by Bismarkian countries (betaSII = 0.0024, p<0.001), while they reduced in Post-Communist countries (betaSII = -0.0022, p<0.001). Post-Communist countries also experienced a widening in relative inequalities (betaRII = 0.1112, p<0.001), which were found to be stable elsewhere. Adjustment for income inequality only explained such trend in Anglo-Saxon countries.Educational inequalities in health have overall persisted across European countries over the last decade. However, there is considerable variation across welfare regimes, possibly related to underpinning social safety nets and to austerity measures implemented during this 10-year period."
https://openalex.org/W2792846887,"Background Factors associated with delirium among community-dwelling older adults have been poorly studied. Our aim was to describe the prevalence of predisposing and precipitating factors for delirium among patients admitted for delirium and to assess whether these factors were appropriately recognized at the first patient assessment at hospital. Methods Consecutive community-dwelling individuals admitted to three geriatric acute care units with a confirmed initial diagnosis of delirium were prospectively included. An independent investigator recorded, using a predefined form, any acute medical condition considered by the attending geriatrician to be a precipitating factor, at the first patient assessment and at the end of his stay in acute care. Results A total of 208 patients were included, 80.0% had a pre-existing cognitive or neurological disorder, or both. The most frequent precipitating factor found were infections (49.0% of all patients, mainly lung and urinary tract infections), followed by drugs (30.8%), dehydration (26.4%) and electrolytic disturbances (18.7%, mostly hyponatremia). 91% of patients had a cerebral imagery, but acute neurological conditions were found in only 18.3%. Fewer precipitating factors were found at first than at final assessment (1.4 (95%CI 1.3–1.6) versus 1.9 (95%CI 1.8–2.0) respectively, p<0.001). This difference was significant for all main categories of precipitating factors. Conclusions Infections, followed by drugs and hydro-electrolytic disorders seem to be the most frequent precipitating factors for delirium in community-dwelling elderly individuals. Early diagnostic and management of precipitating factors in these patients should be improved, as a significant number of them are missed at the initial assessment."

However, information concerning the outcomes and associated factors for PM/DM patients who are hospitalized is limited. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the medical charts of PM/DM patients admitted to a Chinese tertiary referral hospital (Peking Union Medical College Hospital, PUMCH) from 2008 to 2014. The deceased group included 63 patients who had “deceased discharge” status or were confirmed to have died within two weeks of hospital discharge. The demographic data, clinical manifestations, and direct causes of death were analyzed retrospectively. Medical records for 126 age- and sex-matched PM/DM patients were selected as controls from 982 inpatients successively admitted to the same center during the same period. In addition to the comparison of clinical manifestations between the two groups, binary logistic regression was conducted to explore the risk factors related to PM/DM mortality. Results Over the past 6 years at PUMCH, the in-hospital mortality rate of PM/DM patients was 4.58%. The male gender and the elder patients had a high risk of death (P = 0.031 and P = 0.001 respectively). The three most frequent causes of death for PM/DM patients were pulmonary infection (35%), ILD exacerbation (21%) or both conditions (25%). Pulmonary infection (P<0.001, OR = 5.63, 95% CI, 2.37–13.36), pneumomediastinum (P = 0.041, OR = 11.02, 95%CI, 1.10–110.54), Gottron’s papules (P = 0.010, OR = 3.24, 95%CI, 1.32–7.97), and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (P = 0.005, OR = 9.9, 95%CI 2.0–49.0) were independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality of PM/DM patients. Conclusion PM/DM patients continue to display high in-hospital mortality. Pulmonary infection is the strongest predictor of poor prognosis in PM/DM patients, followed by pneumomediastinum, Gottron’s papules, and elevated ESR."
https://openalex.org/W2793159292,"Augmented mortality and morbidity following an acute myocardial infarction in patients with diabetes mellitus Type 2 (T2DM) may be caused by increased sensitivity to ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury or altered activation of endogenous cardioprotective pathways modified by T2DM per se or ischemic preconditioning (IPC). We aimed to investigate, whether the duration of T2DM influences sensitivity against IR injury and the efficacy of IPC, and how myocardial glucose oxidation rate was involved. Male Zucker diabetic fatty rats (homozygote (fa/fa)) at ages 6-(prediabetic), 12- (onset diabetes) and 24-weeks of age (late diabetes) and their age-matched non-diabetic controls (heterozygote (fa/+) were subjected to IR injury in the Langendorff model and randomised to IPC stimulus or control. T2DM rats were endogenously protected at onset of diabetes, as infarct size was lower in 12-weeks T2DM animals than in 6- (35±2% vs 53±4%; P = 0.006) and 24-weeks animals (35±2% vs 72±4%; P<0.0001). IPC reduced infarct size in all groups irrespective of the presence of T2DM and its duration (32±3%; 20±2%; 36±4% respectively; (ANOVA P<0.0001). Compared to prediabetic rats, myocardial glucose oxidation rates were reduced during stabilisation and early reperfusion at onset of T2DM, but these animals retained the ability to increase oxidation rate in late reperfusion. Late diabetic rats had low glucose oxidation rates throughout stabilisation and reperfusion. Despite inherent differences in sensitivity to IR injury, the cardioprotective effect of IPC was preserved in our animal model of pre-, early and late stage T2DM and associated with adaptations to myocardial glucose oxidation capacity."

Mycolic acids are the hallmark of the mycobacterial cell envelope with a characteristic α-alkyl β-hydroxy structure and a very long, C60–C90 hydrocarbon chain. The main meromycolate chain is typically modified in two distinct positions along the hydrocarbon chain, with the proximal position closer to the carboxyl group and the distal position closer to the ω-end of the meromycolate (Fig. S1). These modifications include various functional groups, such as double bonds, methyl groups, cyclopropane, and oxygenated groups. The latter are present only at the distal position of the meromycolate chain and have a methyl group attached at the adjacent carbon (2Marrakchi H. Lanéelle M.A. Daffé M. Mycolic acids: structures, biosynthesis, and beyond.Chem. Biol. 2014; 21 (24374164): 67-8510.1016/j.chembiol.2013.11.011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Based on the presence of functional groups, a few types of mycolic acids were defined, and interestingly, mycobacterial species synthesize distinct sets of several mycolic acid classes. For example, in M. tuberculosis, the least polar α-mycolates with two cyclopropane rings can be found, as well as methoxy- and ketomycolates (Fig. S1). The fast growing environmental strain M. smegmatis, which is a widely used model organism in mycobacteriology, produces mainly α-mycolates with two double bonds, shorter α′-mycolates and epoxymycolates. The biosynthesis of mycolic acids involves the production of (i) C22–C26 α-alkyl chain by the mycobacterial type I fatty acid synthase (FASI) system and (ii) the meromycolate, which is synthesized by elongation of C16–C18 FASI products to fatty acids up to C54 long by enzymes of the type II fatty acid synthase (FASII) system (2Marrakchi H.

It is generally accepted that the attachment of functional groups to the proximal and distal positions of the meromycolate is initiated by desaturation of the chain, although neither the enzyme(s) nor the precise stage at which these reactions occur have been identified. In M. tuberculosis, the chains with double bonds serve as the substrates for at least six S-adenosyl methionine-dependent methyltransferases encoded by mmaA1–mmaA4, cmaA2, and pcaA genes (9Barkan D. Hedhli D. Yan H.G. Huygen K. Glickman M.S. Mycobacterium tuberculosis lacking all mycolic acid cyclopropanation is viable but highly attenuated and hyperinflammatory in mice.Infect.

Although catalytic activities of MmaA1, MmaA2, CmaA2, and PcaA give rise to specific cyclopropane and methyl groups, the methyltransferase MmaA4 (Hma) has been shown to be required for the production of methoxy and ketomycolates (10Dinadayala P.

Synthesis of oxygenated mycolates in M. tuberculosis probably occurs through a hydroxy fatty acid precursor, which can be either O-methylated by the methyltransferase MmaA3, leading to the production of methoxymycolates, or further oxidized resulting in ketomycolates (12Yuan Y. Barry 3rd., C.E. A common mechanism for the biosynthesis of methoxy and cyclopropyl mycolic acids in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Studies of protein–protein interactions of core enzymes of FASII system with known meromycolate modifying enzymes from M. tuberculosis have strengthened the hypothesis that reactions of modifications of the meromycolate chain probably take place during its elongation by FASII (13Veyron-Churlet R.

The biosynthesis of mycolic acids in Mycobacterium tuberculosis relies on multiple specialized elongation complexes interconnected by specific protein–protein interactions.J. Mol.

The biosynthesis of individual classes of mycolates in M. smegmatis has been extensively studied, including several important observations related to the growth of this organism at different temperatures. In this respect, it was shown that the amounts of epoxymycolates relative to α-mycolates and α′-mycolates produced by M. smegmatis, increase at lower temperatures (15Baba T. Kaneda K. Kusunose E. Kusunose M. Yano I. Thermally adaptive changes of mycolic acids in Mycobacterium smegmatis.J. Biochem. 1989; 106 (2777756): 81-8610.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a122825Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although most α-mycolates in M. smegmatis grown at 37 °C are diunsaturated, some level of cyclopropanation was also detected, and it appears to be induced at lower growth temperatures (16Laval F.

Temperature-induced changes in mycolic acid composition were also observed in Mycobacterium thermoresistibile, in which cyclopropanation of α-mycolates decreased at 55 °C compared with 37 °C (18Kremer L. Guérardel Y. Gurcha S.S. Locht C. Besra G.S.

It is therefore of significance to address the temperature dependence of mycolate composition in fast-growing mycobacteria when studying individual mycolic acid classes in these species. These data are not very surprising, given the range of growth conditions to which environmental species are exposed and must adapt to, including possibly via modification of their mycolic acid content. Although this adaptability is more pronounced in environmental mycobacteria, pathogenic species also face different hostile conditions encountered in infected macrophages, which require adaptation to maintain virulence (19Singh A.

In this work we describe the involvement of a novel protein: the epoxide hydrolase EphD from M. tuberculosis H37Rv and its ortholog MSMEG_4280 from M. smegmatis mc2155, hereafter referred to as EphDtb and EphDsmeg, respectively, in the metabolism of mycolic acids in mycobacteria. Epoxide hydrolases (EHs) are enzymes that catalyze the addition of water to epoxides to yield the corresponding 1,2-diols and can use a broad range of substrates, among which are lipids such as arachidonic acid and cholesterol metabolites (Fig. 1A) (21Morisseau C. Role of epoxide hydrolases in lipid metabolism.Biochimie. 2013; 95 (22722082): 91-9510.1016/j.biochi.2012.06.011Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). EphDtb is one of the seven putative EHs predicted in the genome of M. tuberculosis H37Rv, six of which (EphA–EphF) share similarity to mammalian EHs and one of which (EphG) is related to the limonene EH from Rhodococcus erythropolis (22Johansson P. Unge T. Cronin A. Arand M. Bergfors T. Jones T.A. Mowbray S.L. Structure of an atypical epoxide hydrolase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis gives insights into its function.J. Mol.

So far, none of these EHs was ascribed a physiological function, although mycobacterial EHs have been suggested to play a role in fatty acid metabolism (23Tekaia F. Gordon S.V. Garnier T. Brosch R. Barrell B.G. Cole S.T. Analysis of the proteome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in silico.Tuber Lung. Dis. 1999; 79 (10694977): 329-34210.1054/tuld.1999.0220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Contrary to all other human-like soluble EHs, proteins EphD and EphE are conserved across the Mycobacterium genus. Comparing bioinformatic data of EHs from M. tuberculosis, EphDtb shows several distinct features: (i) it is the only membrane-associated putative EH and (ii) along with having an α/β-hydrolase domain characteristic of most soluble EHs, it contains a C-terminal short-chain dehydrogenase (SDR) domain (Fig. S2). The epoxide hydrolase activity of EphDtb and EphDsmeg was tested using cell-free extracts of Escherichia coli strains producing these proteins, as well as recombinant proteins corresponding to the individual EH and SDR domains of EphDtb. Testing EH activity in cell-free extracts of E. coli without the need to purify individual proteins is possible due to the lack of endogenous EH activity in this microorganism (24van Loo B. Kingma J. Arand M. Wubbolts M.G. Janssen D.B. Diversity and biocatalytic potential of epoxide hydrolases identified by genome analysis.Appl Environ Microbiol. 2006; 72 (16597997): 2905-291710.1128/AEM.72.4.2905-2917.2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The ephD gene from M. smegmatis mc2155, orthologous gene from M. tuberculosis H37Rv and the EH- and SDR-encoding segments of ephDtb were individually expressed as C-terminal histidine-tagged proteins in E. coli BL21(DE3) using the expression system pET29a (Fig. 1B). Cell-free extracts from the resulting strains BL21(DE3) pET29a-ephDtb, BL21(DE3) pET29a-ephDtb-EH, BL21(DE3) pET29a-ephDtb-SDR, and BL21(DE3) pET29a-ephDsmeg together with the control strain BL21(DE3) pET29a were used as enzyme sources in an EH assay where each recombinant protein was tested for its ability to hydrolyze the generic substrate [14C]9,10-cis-epoxystearic acid (Fig. 1C) (25Arand M. Cronin A. Adamska M. Oesch F. Epoxide hydrolases: structure, function, mechanism, and assay.Methods Enzymol. 2005; 400 (16399371): 569-58810.1016/S0076-6879(05)00032-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). TLC analyses of organic solvent-extracted lipids clearly demonstrated that cell-free extracts from the EphDtb- and EphDsmeg-producing strains, but not those from the control strain, were capable of converting 9,10-epoxystearic acid into the corresponding diol. The identity of the diol product was confirmed by LC-MS/MS (Fig. S3). Formation of the diol was also evident when a cell-free extract from BL21(DE3) pET29a-ephDtb-EH was used as an enzyme source, whereas the lipids extracted from the reaction containing BL21(DE3) pET29a-ephDtb-SDR were comparable to the negative control (Fig. 1C). We thus conclude that EphDtb and EphDsmeg are functional EHs in vitro and that the α/β-hydrolase domain of EphD alone is responsible for this activity. In the context of this study, we addressed also the epoxide hydrolase activity of all remaining putative EHs from M. tuberculosis H37Rv, and we confirmed that all of these proteins except EphC catalyze the cleavage of 9,10-epoxystearic acid (Fig. 1, B and D). To assess the effect of ephD expression on lipids and mycolic acids, EphDtb and EphDsmeg were individually overproduced in M. smegmatis mc2155 using the inducible expression system pHAM at three different temperatures. The production of recombinant proteins was confirmed by Western blotting analysis and immunodetection with anti-His antibodies (Fig. S4). The cells were harvested, and the total lipids extracted from these cells were analyzed by TLC in different solvent systems. Compared with the negative control strain, strains overproducing EphDtb and EphDsmeg synthesized a novel lipid species (X) migrating slightly faster than TMM (Fig. 2A). Moreover, analysis of mycolic acid methyl esters (MAMEs) extracted and further derivatized from the same batch of whole cells revealed a new fatty acid (Y) correlating with depletion of epoxymycolates in the overproducing strains (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, these changes were not observed in cells grown at 42 °C. Next, we analyzed fatty and mycolic acid compositions of the individual mycolic acid-containing molecules including TMM, TDM, delipidated cell residues, and lipid X synthesized by the overproducing strains grown at 30 °C. Individual lipids were purified by preparative TLC and further subjected to saponification, and free fatty and mycolic acids were derivatized to their corresponding methyl esters and analyzed by TLC. This unveiled that the majority of species Y is bound to populations of extractable lipids, mainly TMM and lipid X; surprisingly, the latter compound contained practically no α-, α′-, or epoxymycolates (Fig. 3). Y in the form of methyl ester was further isolated using preparative TLC and subjected to structural analysis. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry showed that species Y represents a series of odd and even carbon number mycolic acids with mass values expected for dicarboxymycolates (m/z 925 (C57), 939 (C58), 953 (C59), 967 (C60), and 981 (C61)) (26Laval F.

The presence of an ω-carboxyl group in molecules of population Y was confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy, with characteristic singlets at 3.65 and 3.70 ppm, corresponding to the signals of two methyl protons linked to carboxyl groups (Fig. S5). Similar dicarboxy mycolic acids were previously reported in several Mycobacterium species that synthesize wax-ester mycolates, such as Mycobacterium aurum, Mycobacterium phlei, or the Mycobacterium avium–intracellulare–scrofulaceumcomplex (27Minnikin D.E.

Dicarboxymycolates are formed from wax-ester mycolates of these strains during the isolation of mycolic acids from their native complex forms, which involves drastic hydrolysis in alkaline conditions (saponification). To confirm whether detected dicarboxymycolates really originated from wax-ester mycolates, we attempted circumventing the need for saponification. We reasoned that the presence of wax-ester mycolates should be detectable by MALDI-TOF analysis of the purified intact lipid molecules TMM and lipid X. The comparative analysis of MALDI-TOF mass spectra of TMM from control and overproducing strains yielded the following results (Table 1): In the mass spectra of TMM from the control strain, the peaks with [M+Na]+ at m/z 1470 and 1498 were assigned to TMM with C77 and C79 α-mycolic acids and the peaks of [M+Na]+ at m/z 1514 and 1528 to the main representatives of TMM with C79 and C80 epoxymycolic acids. In the case of TMM from EphDtb- and EphDsmeg-overproducing strains, the mass values were respectively assigned to TMM with α-C77 and α-C79, as well as epoxy-C79–C80 as in the control strain, but also additional peaks at m/z 1502, 1516, 1530, and 1544 were observed. The mass values of these peaks could be interpreted as TMM molecules bearing a supplementary oxygens in the meromycolate chain (31Fujita Y. Naka T. Doi T. Yano I. Direct molecular mass determination of trehalose monomycolate from 11 species of mycobacteria by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.Microbiology. 2005; 151 (15870454): 1443-145210.1099/mic.0.27791-0Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).Table 1Comparative MALDI-MS analysis of TMMType of mycolic acidNumber of carbonsUnknown number of carbons7778798081821. pHAM α-14701498 Epoxy-1486150015141528154215562. pHAM-ephDtb α-14701498 Epoxy-1486150015141528 Unknown15021516153015443. pHAM-ephDsmeg α-14701498 Epoxy-1486150015141528 Unknown1502151615301544 Open table in a new tab Each representative peak was further analyzed by MS/MS fragmentation, which confirmed the identity of trehalose esters by the appearance of a fragment at m/z 715, indicating C2–C3 cleavage of the mycolate unit releasing a C24 fragment with trehalose (Table S1). Loss of glucose in high mass values was observed in all of the samples, as well as the presence of a peak at m/z 365, assigned to trehalose. Comparative 1H NMR studies of TMM isolated from the control and EphD-overproducing strains confirmed the presence of disaccharide trehalose with one glucose acylated at the 6 position, as well as 2-alkyl 3-hydroxy fatty acids (H-2 and H-3 at 2.35 and 3.60 ppm). Other specific signals characteristic for mycolic acids of M. smegmatis were found, including those for cis and trans double bonds and epoxy ring; this last signal was absent in TMMs from both overproducers. The signals corresponding to a wax-ester were not clearly identified. However, MALDI-MS analysis of mycolic acids released after saponification of TMM confirmed the presence of dicarboxymycolic acids in the samples from the strains overproducing EphD (Table 2). Interestingly, no diol mycolic acids were observed, but the presence of peaks of pseudomolecular [M+Na]+ species at m/z 1220, 1234, 1248, and 1262 was identified in these spectra. These mass values could be interpreted as either hydroxy-mycolic acid (1220 for the C80 homolog) or long chain dicarboxylic mycolic acid (1248 for the C80 homolog) or mycolic acid harboring an internal ester function; however, this last structure needs strong alkaline conditions for their isolation. These data together with the results of MALDI-TOF analysis of the purified intact TMMs from EphD-overproducing strains suggested that the analyzed TMM population contains mycolic acids with internal ester group.Table 2Comparative MALDI-MS analysis of methylated mycolic acidsType of mycolic acidNumber of carbonsUnknown number of carbons585960617778798081821. pHAM α-117411881202 Epoxy-119012041218123212462. pHAM-ephDtb117411881202 α-11601188 Epoxy-11761204121812321246 Unknown1220123412481262 Dicarboxy-9399539679813. pHAM-ephDsmeg α-116011741188 Epoxy-11761190120412181232 Unknown12201234124812621276 Dicarboxy-939953967981 Open table in a new tab The MALDI-TOF mass spectra of isolated intact lipid X contained a mixture of three populations of lipids (Table S2): (i) glycopeptidolipids represented by two peaks at m/z 1232 and 1260 corresponding to one series of the species-specific lipids of M. smegmatis and characterized by their fragmentation pattern; (ii) trehalose β-keto esters with C77 and C79 diethylenic meromycolate chains, characterized by the main peaks with [M+Na]+ at m/z 1468 and 1496; These compounds, intermediates of mycolic acids synthesis, did not show C2–C3 cleavage of the mycolate by MS/MS, as the hallmark of the mycolic acid motif is absent in these molecules; and (iii) in the high mass values, at m/z from 1740 to 1894, ultra long-chain complex lipids ranging from C95 to C105 and belonging likely to the TMM series. The MS/MS fragmentation of the long chain compounds confirmed the nature of trehalose monomycolates by the occurrence of peak at m/z 715 indicating C2–C3 cleavage. Another peak resulting from this cleavage could be interpreted as a possible fragment of the meroaldehyde at m/z 1068, 1173, and 1201. The long-chain mycolic acid could explain the higher migration of this TMM fraction. Ultra long-chain mycolic acids possessing three functional groups have already been identified as minor components of M. tuberculosis (32Watanabe M. Aoyagi Y. Ridell M. Minnikin D.E.

These plasticizers may leach out into infused solutions during clinical practice, especially during risk-situations, e.g multiple infusions in Intensive Care Units and thus may enter into contact with the patients. The migrability of the plasticizers is dependent of several clinical parameters such as temperature, contact time, nature of the simulant, etc… However, no data is available about the influence of the flow rate at which drug solutions are administrated. In this study, we evaluated the impact of different flow rates on the release of the different plasticizers during an infusion procedure in order to assess if they could expose the patients to more toxic amounts of plasticizers. Migration assays with different PVC infusion sets and extension lines were performed with different flow rates that are used in clinical practice during 1h, 2h, 4h, 8h and 24h, using a lipophilic drug simulant. From a clinical point of view, the results showed that, regardless of the plasticizer, the faster the flow rate, the higher the infused volume and the higher the quantities of plasticizers released, both from infusion sets and extension lines, leading to higher patient exposure. However, physically, there was no significant difference of the migration kinetics linked to the flow rate for a same medical device, reflecting complex interactions between the PVC matrix and the simulant. The migration was especially dependent on the nature and the composition of the medical device."

State-of-the-art models have been developed to mimic the visual attention system of young adults that, however, largely ignore the variations that occur with age. In this paper, we investigated how visual scene processing changes with age and we propose an age-adapted framework that helps to develop a computational model that can predict saliency across different age groups. Our analysis uncovers how the explorativeness of an observer varies with age, how well saliency maps of an age group agree with fixation points of observers from the same or different age groups, and how age influences the center bias. We analyzed the eye movement behavior of 82 observers belonging to four age groups while they explored visual scenes. Explorativeness was quantified in terms of the entropy of a saliency map, and area under the curve (AUC) metrics was used to quantify the agreement analysis and the center bias. These results were used to develop age adapted saliency models. Our results suggest that the proposed age-adapted saliency model outperforms existing saliency models in predicting the regions of interest across age groups."
https://openalex.org/W2790243418,"RNA interference (RNAi) is a complex and highly conserved regulatory mechanism mediated via small RNAs (sRNAs). Recent technical advances in high throughput sequencing have enabled an increasingly detailed analysis of sRNA abundances and profiles in specific body parts and tissues. This enables investigations of the localized roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). However, variation in the proportions of non-coding RNAs in the samples being compared can hinder these analyses. Specific tissues may vary significantly in the proportions of fragments of longer non-coding RNAs (such as ribosomal RNA or transfer RNA) present, potentially reflecting tissue-specific differences in biological functions. For example, in Drosophila, some tissues contain a highly abundant 30nt rRNA fragment (the 2S rRNA) as well as abundant 5’ and 3’ terminal rRNA fragments. These can pose difficulties for the construction of sRNA libraries as they can swamp the sequencing space and obscure sRNA abundances. Here we addressed this problem and present a modified “rRNA blocking” protocol for the construction of high-definition (HD) adapter sRNA libraries, in D. melanogaster reproductive tissues. The results showed that 2S rRNAs targeted by blocking oligos were reduced from >80% to < 0.01% total reads. In addition, the use of multiple rRNA blocking oligos to bind the most abundant rRNA fragments allowed us to reveal the underlying sRNA populations at increased resolution. Side-by-side comparisons of sequencing libraries of blocked and non-blocked samples revealed that rRNA blocking did not change the miRNA populations present, but instead enhanced their abundances. We suggest that this rRNA blocking procedure offers the potential to improve the in-depth analysis of differentially expressed sRNAs within and across different tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2793426052,"CR6 interacting factor 1 (CRIF1) deficiency impairs mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complexes, contributing to increased mitochondrial and cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. CRIF1 downregulation has also been revealed to decrease sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) expression and impair vascular function. Inhibition of SIRT1 disturbs oxidative energy metabolism and stimulates nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB)-induced inflammation. Therefore, we hypothesized that both CRIF1 deficiency-induced mitochondrial ROS production and SIRT1 reduction play stimulatory roles in vascular inflammation.Plasma levels and mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6) were markedly elevated in endothelium-specific CRIF1-knockout mice and CRIF1-silenced endothelial cells, respectively. Moreover, CRIF1 deficiency-induced vascular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expression was consistently attenuated by the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine and NF-κB inhibitor (BAY11). We next showed that siRNA-mediated CRIF1 downregulation markedly activated NF-κB. SIRT1 overexpression not only rescued CRIF1 deficiency-induced NF-κB activation but also decreased inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) and VCAM-1 expression levels in endothelial cells.These results strongly suggest that CRIF1 deficiency promotes endothelial cell inflammation by increasing VCAM-1 expression, elevating inflammatory cytokines levels, and activating the transcription factor NF-κB, all of which were inhibited by SIRT1 overexpression."
https://openalex.org/W2793472432,"Peptidoglycan (PGN), a major component of bacterial cell walls, is a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) that causes innate immune cells to produce inflammatory cytokines that escalate the host response during infection. In order to better understand the role of PGN in infection, we wanted to gain insight into the cellular receptor for PGN. Although the receptor was initially identified as Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), this receptor has remained controversial and other PGN receptors have been reported. We produced PGN from live cultures of Bacillus anthracis and Staphylococcus aureus and tested samples of PGN isolated during the purification process to determine at what point TLR2 activity was removed, if at all. Our results indicate that although live B. anthracis and S. aureus express abundant TLR2 ligands, highly-purified PGN from either bacterial source is not recognized by TLR2."
https://openalex.org/W2789165013,"The ubiquitin-proteasome system regulates the abundance of many cellular proteins by mediating their targeted degradation. We previously developed a method—differential proteomics–based identification of ubiquitylation substrates (DiPIUS)—for the comprehensive identification of substrates for a given F-box protein subunit of SCF-type ubiquitin ligases. We have now applied DiPIUS to the F-box protein Fbxw7 in three cell lines (mHepa, Neuro2A, and C2C12) and thereby identified myelin regulatory factor (MyRF), an endoplasmic reticulum–anchored transcription factor that is essential for myelination of nerves in the central nervous system, as a candidate substrate of Fbxw7 specifically in mHepa cells. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that the NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain of MyRF interacted with Fbxw7 in these cells. Furthermore, an in vitro ubiquitylation assay revealed that MyRF undergoes polyubiquitylation in the presence of purified recombinant SCFFbxw7. In addition, the stability of MyRF in mHepa cells was increased by mutation of a putative phosphodegron sequence or by exposure of the cells to an inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3). We found that MyRF mRNA is not restricted to the central nervous system but is instead distributed widely among mouse tissues. Furthermore, with the use of RNA sequencing in mHepa cells overexpressing or depleted of MyRF, we identified many novel potential target genes of MyRF. Our results thus suggest that Fbxw7 controls the transcription of MyRF target genes in various tissues through regulation of MyRF protein stability in a manner dependent on MyRF phosphorylation by GSK-3.

https://openalex.org/W2789288582,"Protected areas (PAs) are often considered the most important biodiversity conservation areas in national plans, but PAs often do not represent national-scale biodiversity. We evaluate the current conservation status of plant biodiversity within current existing PAs, and identify potential additional PAs for South Korea. We modeled species ranges for 2,297 plant species using Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines and compared the level of mean range representation in South Korea's existing PAs, which comprise 5.7% of the country's mainland area, with an equal-area alternative PA strategy selected with the reserve algorithm Marxan. We also used Marxan to model two additional conservation scenarios that add lands to approach the Aichi Biodiversity Target objectives (17% of the country). Existing PAs in South Korea contain an average of 6.3% of each plant species' range, compared to 5.9% in the modeled equal-area alternative. However, existing PAs primarily represent a high percentage of the ranges for high-elevation and small range size species. The additional PAs scenario that adds lands to the existing PAs covers 14,587.55 km2, and would improve overall plant range representation to a mean of 16.8% of every species' range. The other additional PAs scenario, which selects new PAs from all lands and covers 13,197.35 km2, would improve overall plant range representation to a mean of 13.5%. Even though the additional PAs that includes existing PAs represents higher percentages of species' ranges, it is missing many biodiversity hotspots in non-mountainous areas and the additional PAs without locking in the existing PAs represent almost all species' ranges evenly, including low-elevation ones with larger ranges. Some priority conservation areas we identified are expansions of, or near, existing PAs, especially in northeastern and southern South Korea. However, lowland coastal areas and areas surrounding the capital city, Seoul, are also critical for biodiversity conservation in South Korea."
https://openalex.org/W2790925720,"Emotion recognition is important for social interaction and communication, yet previous research has identified a cross-cultural emotion recognition deficit: Recognition is less accurate for emotions expressed by individuals from a cultural group different than one's own. The current study examined whether social categorization based on race, in the absence of cultural differences, influences emotion recognition in a diverse context. South Asian and White Canadians in the Greater Toronto Area completed an emotion recognition task that required them to identify the seven basic emotional expressions when posed by members of the same two groups, allowing us to tease apart the contributions of culture and social group membership. Contrary to our hypothesis, there was no mutual in-group advantage in emotion recognition: Participants were not more accurate at recognizing emotions posed by their respective racial in-groups. Both groups were more accurate at recognizing expressions when posed by South Asian faces, and White participants were more accurate overall compared to South Asian participants. These results suggest that in a diverse environment, categorization based on race alone does not lead to the creation of social out-groups in a way that negatively impacts emotion recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2787202324,"The membrane potential helps determine pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell (PASMC) contraction. The Kv7 channel activators, retigabine and flupirtine, are thought to dilate pulmonary arteries by hyperpolarising PASMC. Zinc pyrithione activates Kv7 channels by a mechanism distinct from retigabine and with different Kv7 subunit selectivity. This study aimed to determine if zinc pyrithione selectively activates Kv7 channels in rat PASMC to evoke pulmonary artery dilation. Zinc pyrithione relaxed pulmonary arteries with half-maximal effect at 4.3μM. At 10μM it activated pronounced voltage-dependent K+ current and hyperpolarized PASMCs by around 10mV. Tetraethylammonium ions (TEA, 10mM) and paxilline (1μM) abolished both the current and hyperpolarisation. XE991 (10μM) blocked the hyperpolarization and reduced the current by 30%. Iberiotoxin (50nM) had no effect on the hyperpolarisation, but reduced the current by 40%. The XE991-sensitive current activated with an exponential time course (time constant 17ms), whereas the iberiotoxin-sensitive current followed a bi-exponential time course (time constants 6 and 57ms), suggesting that the drugs blocked different components of the zinc pyrithione-induced current. Zinc pyrithione therefore appears to activate at least two types of K+ channel in PASMC; an XE991, TEA and paxilline-sensitive Kv7 channel and a TEA, paxilline and iberiotoxin-sensitive BKCa channel. Both could contribute to the relaxing effect of zinc pyrithione on pulmonary artery."
https://openalex.org/W2789977939,"Emerging technologies have enabled the isolation and characterization of rare circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from the blood of metastatic cancer patients. CTCs represent a non-invasive opportunity to gain information regarding the primary tumor and recent reports suggest CTCs have value as an indicator of disease status. CTCs are fragile and difficult to expand in vitro, so typically molecular characterization must be performed immediately following isolation. To ease experimental timelines and enable biobanking, cryopreservation methods are needed. However, extensive cellular heterogeneity and the rarity of CTCs complicates the optimization of cryopreservation methods based upon cell type, necessitating a standardized protocol. Here, we optimized a previously reported vitrification protocol to preserve patient-derived CTC cell lines using highly conductive silica microcapillaries to achieve ultra-fast cooling rates with low cryoprotectant concentrations. Using this vitrification protocol, five CTC cell lines were cooled to cryogenic temperatures. Thawed CTCs exhibited high cell viability and expanded under in vitro cell culture conditions. EpCAM biomarker expression was maintained for each CTC cell line. One CTC cell line was selected for molecular characterization, revealing that RNA integrity was maintained after storage. A qPCR panel showed no significant difference in thawed CTCs compared to fresh controls. The data presented here suggests vitrification may enable the standardization of cryopreservation methods for CTCs."
https://openalex.org/W2792682911,"While diseases caused by nematodes remains a considerable drawback for the livestock, agriculture and public health, anthelmintics drug resistance has been observed over the past years and is a major concern for parasite control. Ivermectin, initially considered as a highly potent drug, currently presents a reduced anti-helminthic efficacy, which is influenced by expression of several ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC), among them the P-glycoproteins (Pgps). Here we present some evidences of Pgps dominance during Ivermectin resistance/susceptibility using Pgps double silencing in C. elegans and the phylogenetic relationship of Pgps among nematodes, which strengthen the use of this model for study of drug resistance in nematodes. Firstly, we evaluated the quantitative gene expression of 12 out the 15 known Pgps from resistant and WT strains of C. elegans, we demonstrated the upregulation of Pgps 12 and 13 and downregulation of all remaining Pgps in ivermectin resistant strain. By using an RNAi loss-of-function approach we observed that Pgp 12 gene silencing reverts the resistance phenotype to ivermectin, while Pgp 4 gene silencing does not alter the resistance phenotype but induces a resistance in wild type strain. Interestingly, the dual silencing of Pgp 12 and Pgp 4 expression demonstrates the dominance of phenotype promoted by Pgp 12 silencing. Finally, in silico analysis reveals a close relationship between Pgps from C. elegans and several nematodes parasites. Taken together, our results indicate that Pgp 12 is crucial for the resistance to ivermectin and thus a good candidate for further studies aiming to develop specific inhibitors to this transporter, allowing the continuous use of ivermectin to control the burden on animal and human health inflicted by nematode parasites globally."
https://openalex.org/W2793720470,"Severe obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) can lead to neurocognitive alterations, including gait impairments. The beneficial effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on improving excessive daytime sleepiness and daily functioning have been documented. However, a demonstration of CPAP treatment efficacy on gait control is still lacking. This study aims to test the hypothesis that CPAP improves gait control in severe OSA patients.In this prospective controlled study, twelve severe OSA patients (age = 57.2±8.9 years, body mass index = 27.4±3.1 kg·m-2, apnoea-hypopnoea index = 46.3±11.7 events·h-1) and 10 healthy matched subjects were included. Overground gait parameters were recorded at spontaneous speed and stride time variability, a clinical marker of gait control, was calculated. To assess the role of executive functions in gait and postural control, a dual-task paradigm was applied using a Stroop test as secondary cognitive task. All assessments were performed before and after 8 weeks of CPAP treatment.Before CPAP treatment, OSA patients had significantly larger stride time variability (3.1±1.1% vs 2.1±0.5%) and lower cognitive performances under dual task compared to controls. After CPAP treatment, stride time variability was significantly improved and no longer different compared to controls. Cognitive performance under dual task also improved after CPAP treatment.Eight weeks of CPAP treatment improves gait control of severe OSA patients, suggesting morphological and functional cerebral improvements. Our data provide a rationale for further mechanistic studies and the use of gait as a biomarker of OSA brain consequences."
https://openalex.org/W2789705717,"Relationships between Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) mRNA levels in blood and intragenic FMR1 CGG triplet expansions support the pathogenic role of RNA gain of function toxicity in premutation (PM: 55–199 CGGs) related disorders. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) studies reporting these findings normalised FMR1 mRNA level to a single internal control gene called β-glucuronidase (GUS). This study evaluated FMR1 mRNA-CGG correlations in 33 PM and 33 age- and IQ-matched control females using three normalisation strategies in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs): (i) GUS as a single internal control; (ii) the mean of GUS, Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 4A2 (EIF4A2) and succinate dehydrogenase complex flavoprotein subunit A (SDHA); and (iii) the mean of EIF4A2 and SDHA (with no contribution from GUS). GUS mRNA levels normalised to the mean of EIF4A2 and SDHA mRNA levels and EIF4A2/SDHA ratio were also evaluated. FMR1mRNA level normalised to the mean of EIF4A2 and SDHA mRNA levels, with no contribution from GUS, showed the most significant correlation with CGG size and the greatest difference between PM and control groups (p = 10−11). Only 15% of FMR1 mRNA PM results exceeded the maximum control value when normalised to GUS, compared with over 42% when normalised to the mean of EIF4A2 and SDHA mRNA levels. Neither GUS mRNA level normalised to the mean RNA levels of EIF4A2 and SDHA, nor to the EIF4A2/SDHA ratio were correlated with CGG size. However, greater variability in GUS mRNA levels were observed for both PM and control females across the full range of CGG repeat as compared to the EIF4A2/SDHA ratio. In conclusion, normalisation with multiple control genes, excluding GUS, can improve assessment of the biological significance of FMR1 mRNA-CGG size relationships."
https://openalex.org/W2789898161,"In the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus, early studies suggested a relationship between smaller crabs, which molt more frequently, and higher rates of infection by the dinoflagellate parasite, Hematodinium perezi. In order to better explore the influence of size and molting on infections, blue crabs were collected from the Maryland coastal bays and screened for the presence of H. perezi in hemolymph samples using a quantitative PCR assay. Molt stage was determined by a radioimmunoassay which measured ecdysteroid concentrations in blue crab hemolymph. Differences were seen in infection prevalence between size classes, with the medium size class (crabs 61 to 90 mm carapace width) and juvenile crabs (≤ 30 mm carapace width) having the highest infection prevalence at 47.2% and 46.7%, respectively. All size classes were susceptible to infection, although fall months favored disease acquisition by juveniles, whereas mid-sized animals (31–90 mm carapace width) acquired infection predominantly in summer. Disease intensity was also most pronounced in the summer, with blue crabs > 61 mm being primary sources of proliferation. Molt status appeared to be influenced by infection, with infected crabs having significantly lower concentrations of ecdysteroids than uninfected crabs in the spring and the fall. We hypothesize that infection by H. perezi may increase molt intervals, with a delay in the spring molt cycle as an evolutionary adaptation functioning to coincide with increased host metabolism, providing optimal conditions for H. perezi propagation. Regardless of season, postmolt crabs harbored significantly higher proportions of moderate and heavy infections, suggesting that the process of ecdysis, and the postmolt recovery period, has a positive effect on parasite proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2792414389,"Pancreatic cancer is the 5th leading cause of cancer deaths, and there are no effective treatments. We developed a poxvirus platform vaccine with improved immunogenicity and inserted the mesothelin gene to create an anti-mesothelin cancer vaccine. Mesothelin expression is mostly restricted to tumors in adult mammals and thus may be a good target for cancer treatment. We show here that the modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) virus expressing mesothelin and the enhanced MVA virus missing the immunosuppressive A35 gene and expressing mesothelin were both safe in mice and were able to induce IFN-gamma secreting T cells in response to mesothelin expressing tumor cells. In addition, the MVA virus has oncolytic properties in vitro as it can replicate in and kill Panc02 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line tumor cells, even though it is unable to replicate in most mammalian cells. Deletion of the A35 gene in MVA improved T cell responses as expected. However, we were unable to demonstrate inhibition of Panc02 tumor growth in immunocompetent mice with pre-vaccination of mice, boosts, or even intratumoral injections of the recombinant viruses. Vaccine efficacy may be limited by shedding of mesothelin from tumor cells thus creating a protective screen from the immune system."

https://openalex.org/W2788198805,"Oceanographers have put a stethoscope on the coursing circulatory system of the Atlantic Ocean, and they have found a skittish pulse that9s surprisingly strong in the waters east of Greenland—discoveries that should improve climate models. The powerful currents known as the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) are an engine in Earth9s climate. The AMOC9s shallower limbs—which include the Gulf Stream—move warm water from the tropics northward, warming Western Europe. In the north, the waters cool and sink, forming deeper limbs that transport the cold water back south—and sequester anthropogenic carbon in the process. Last week, at the American Geophysical Union9s Ocean Sciences meeting, scientists presented the first data from an array of instruments moored in the subpolar North Atlantic, a $35 million, seven-nation project known as the Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program (OSNAP). Since 2004, researchers have gathered data from another array, at 26°N, stretching from Florida to Africa. But OSNAP is the first to monitor the circulation farther north, where a critical aspect of the overturning occurs. The observations reveal unexpected eddies and strong variability in the AMOC currents. They also show that the currents east of Greenland contribute the most to the total AMOC flow. Climate models, on the other hand, have emphasized the currents west of Greenland in the Labrador Sea."
https://openalex.org/W2790802357,"In this manuscript, we first reveal a simple ultra violet laser lithographic method to design and produce plain tailored multielectrode arrays. Secondly, we use the same lithographic setup for surface patterning to enable controlled attachment of primary neuronal cells and help neurite guidance. For multielectrode array production, we used flat borosilicate glass directly structured with the laser lithography system. The multi layered electrode system consists of a layer of titanium coated with a layer of di-titanium nitride. Finally, these electrodes are covered with silicon nitride for insulation. The quality of the custom made multielectrode arrays was investigated by light microscopy, electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The performance was verified by the detection of action potentials of primary neurons. The electrical noise of the custom-made MEA was equal to commercially available multielectrode arrays. Additionally, we demonstrated that structured coating with poly lysine, obtained with the aid of the same lithographic system, could be used to attach and guide neurons to designed structures. The process of neuron attachment and neurite guidance was investigated by light microscopy and charged particle microscopy. Importantly, the utilization of the same lithographic system for MEA fabrication and poly lysine structuring will make it easy to align the architecture of the neuronal network to the arrangement of the MEA electrode.. In future studies, this will lead to multielectrode arrays, which are able to specifically attach neuronal cell bodies to their chemically defined electrodes and guide their neurites, gaining a controlled connectivity in the neuronal network. This type of multielectrode array would be able to precisely assign a signal to a certain neuron resulting in an efficient way for analyzing the maturation of the neuronal connectivity in small neuronal networks."

An additional purpose was to clarify associations between different parameters with special emphasis on pain.This was a prospective randomized double-blind 4-weeks study on men with moderate lower urinary tract symptoms who underwent the evaluation for quality of life at the baseline and at the end of the study. The symptoms were characterized by International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS) and National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-PSI), the maximum urinary flow and the main prostate-related indices. In order to obtain more comprehensive information about the effects of fermented whey product on systemic oxidative stress marker 8-EPI and seminal plasma inflammatory markers (interleukin-6 and interleukin-8) were also measured.After 4 weeks consumption of fermented whey product there was a statistically significant decrease of prostate-specific antigen level in serum and systemic stress marker 8-EPI in urine compared to control group. Maximum urinary flow and NIH-PSI all studied scores and sub-scores had also significant improvement. In addition, seminal plasma interleukin-8 level substantially decreased.The consumption of special fermented whey product improved urinary function, reduced lower urinary tract symptoms, systemic oxidative stress marker and seminal plasma inflammatory status.

https://openalex.org/W2789131364,"Growing up, I idealized independence. I always wanted my own efforts to be enough, whether it was completing school assignments without help from my parents or moving into a new apartment by myself. When I decided to pursue a graduate degree, I wanted to develop a novel research program and quickly establish myself as an independent scientist. I sought out an adviser who would give me complete agency over my doctoral work while also offering strong mentorship. But I was naively optimistic about what I could accomplish.

I figured that my adviser and labmates could help me learn to conduct sound experiments and become a successful researcher, and I could rely on published literature to learn the specific techniques I would need. As I began designing experiments to investigate the symbiotic relationship between legumes and nitrogen-fixing bacteria, my committee members applauded my ambition to pioneer a project far beyond the scope of my lab, which focuses on plant-pollinator interactions. They also warned me about the challenges I would face.

> “I … embarked on a cross-country road trip to develop the expertise I needed.” 

But my need for independence drove me to push forward with my research plan. As a result, the first 4 years of my graduate career were defined by a series of failures. My head spun with possible questions to explore, but I struggled to translate these ideas into feasible studies. Because my research interests were distinct from ongoing work in the lab, I rarely asked for help. When I did seek assistance, my labmates were often at a loss because they didn't have the expertise I needed.

During my second year, I solicited little feedback about the research proposal I was writing for my comprehensive exam—and I went on to fail part of the exam because it was unclear whether the experiments I proposed would lead to conclusive results. Unwilling to abandon my project, I spent the next 3 months rethinking, redesigning, and rewriting my proposal. I developed a clear vision for my research, but the setbacks weren't over. During my third year, I had grand ambitions to genetically manipulate plants, only to discover that after treating thousands of seeds, I obtained just one plant I could use for experiments.

By my fourth year, my desperation to succeed overshadowed my desire for independence. The only thing I cared about was generating publishable data. I was disappointed by my inability to conduct a successful experiment on my own, but I knew that I needed to take a new approach.

A few months later, I packed my car and embarked on a cross-country road trip to develop the expertise I needed. My adviser and I had devised a somewhat unusual solution: I would spend a 3-month “sabbatical” in a collaborating lab to obtain specialized training. I worked extensively with other students, constantly asked questions, and offered to help with ongoing projects to learn everything I could. For the culmination of my sabbatical, I executed an elegant experiment that would not have been possible without the dedicated help of the principal investigator, three graduate students, and numerous undergrads.

But the experiment still failed. Thirty percent of my control plants were contaminated with bacteria. My data were unpublishable. I drove back to Pennsylvania with the same feeling of desperation I had earlier in my graduate career. Even asking for help was not enough to produce a successful experiment.

My adviser, on the other hand, saw this experience as a groundbreaking success, emphasizing the extensive skill set I acquired. A few months later, when I repeated the experiment in my home lab, I produced publishable data. By learning when to ask for help, I had found the perfect balance of independence and assistance, which ultimately led to success.

Being an independent scientist doesn't require me to do everything on my own. I can address novel questions without feeling obligated to master every aspect of the scientific process. Now when I get stuck, I don't hesitate to ask others for help, whether they're across the country or in my own lab.
