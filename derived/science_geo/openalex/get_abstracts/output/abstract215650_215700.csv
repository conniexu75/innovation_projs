Since the relationship between the independent variable, Cs, and the dependent variable, v, is curvilinear, it has long been customary to facilitate estimation of the two parameters by plotting the experimental data according to one of the following three linear transformations of Equation 1. v = Vmax - K&/C’s) (la) (Cs/v) = (Km/Vm,x) + (l/Vm,x)Cs (lb)"

The test system (total volume, 3.00 ml) was 100 mM in Tris-HCI buffer (pH S.5), 5.2 mM in MgSO+ 0.27 mM in NADP, and 0.20 mM in UDP-glucose and contained nucleotide pyrophosphatase and 0.1 ml or more of a solution of phosphoglucomutase (0.09 mg per ml) and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (0.032 mg per ml) that was 70 mM in imidazole and 2 mM in MgS04. A control was prepared that contained the ingredients in the reaction system with the exception of UDP-glucose. When purified nucleotide pyrophosphatase was available, the pyrophosphatase, instead of the UDP-glucose, was sometimes left out of the control. The reaction was followed by measuring NADP reduction spectrophotometrically at 340 rnp at room temperature. When glucose l-phosphate (at 0.20 mM) was tested in the reaction system in place of UDP-glucose, the initial velocity was at least 0.34 pmole of NADPH formed per minute. This is at least 10 to 50 times the velocity obtained with UDP-glucose. One unit of nucleotide pyrophosphatase activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the formation of NADPH at an initial velocity of 1.00 pmole per minute. Activity is expressed as units per ml of enzyme, and specific activity is expressed as units per mg of protein. This assay was used with all substrates that could form glucose l-phosphate upon hydrolysis. The initial velocity varied linearly with the amount of enzyme added as seen in Fig. 1. Assay Method B for Nucleotide Pyrophosphatase Activity-As an alternative method the following procedure was used. The test system (total volume, 3.00 ml) was 100 mM in Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) and 5.2 mM in MgS04, and contained nucleotide pyrophosphatase and the appropriate substrate. Controls were prepared by omission of enzyme or substrate. After addition of the substrate, the solutions were mixed and incubated at 37”. The reaction was followed by measuring loss of substrate, as described in the section “Other Measurements” below. When NAD was the substrate, nicotinamide was frequently included at 100 mM to inhibit any NAD nucleotidase activity. The specific activity was expressed as the micromoles of substrate destroyed per minute per mg of protein. When the substrate was ADP, all tubes were incubated at 37” for the"

https://openalex.org/W90102645,"Considerable evidence that the interaction of cr-chymotrypsin with substrates or inhibitors results in conformational changes in the enzyme has been reported (l-6). This evidence was provided in part by experiments with covalently bound enzymesubstrate complexes which indicated that the optical rotatory dispersion parameters (l-3) and the thermodynamic parameters of reversible, temperature-induced phase transitions (4) differ from those of the free enzyme and depend on the nature of the substrate. Other evidence was provided by measurements of difference spectra between enzyme and covalently bound enzymesubstrate complexes (5, 7). The difference spectrum (see, for example, Fig. 3b), with a major peak at 290 rnp, was observed to be the same whether the group attached to the enzyme was diisopropylphosphoryl, acetyl, trimethylacetyl, or cinnamoyl. Recent data on x-ray diffraction from crystals of native y-chymotrypsin and of a covalently bonded inhibitor-enzyme complex also suggest that some deformation of the protein structure accompanies the formation of the enzyme-inhibitor complex (8). In order to understand the interrelationships of the steps which are associated with the spectral changes, the changes in specific rotation of the enzyme, and the catalytic reaction, we have undertaken a kinetic study of the reaction of cY-chymotrypsin with diisopropyl fluorophosphate in the pH range of 2.0 to 10.0 (9). This reaction yields covalcntly bonded diisopropylphosphoryl-oc-chymotrypsin and HF in stoichiometric amounts (10). In this paper we are reporting equilibrium and kinetic studies of this reaction at pH 2.0, including data on the spectral changes, the change in optical rotation, and the phosphorylation and inhibition of the enzyme. We are also reporting on the chymotrypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis at pH 2.0 of a specific substrate, N-acetyl-n-phenylalanine ethyl ester, and on the spectral changes of the enzyme which accompany this reaction."

L-Triiodothyronine also forms an insoluble com- plex with lysozyme, but is much less effective t,han thyroxine. An insoluble complex does not form between lysozyme and ap- propriate similar amounts of nn-thyronine, diiodotyrosine, potas- sium iodide, or iodine. The formation of an insoluble complex does not occur when lysozyme is replaced by isomolecular masses of ribonuclease or cytochrome c. 2. Formation of an insoluble complex also occurs between lysozyme and thyroglobulin. The complex forms to about the same extent over a pH range of 6.4 to 8.0 and is reproducible owing to the greater solubility of thyroglobulin than of thyroxine. The formation of an insoluble complex does not occur when lysozyme is replaced by isomolecular masses of ribonuclease, cytochrome c, or performate-oxidized lysozyme. The insoluble complex has been identified by sucrose density gradient centri- fugation, and results of sucrose density gradient analysis have been confirmed with free boundary electrophoresis. 3. Addition of increasing amounts of L-thyroxine to thyro- globulin causes a linear increase in the formation of an insoluble complex with lysozyme until about, 80% of the total protein in the system has been precipitated. Higher amounts of n-thy- roxine added to the thyroglobulin-lysozyme system continue increase the amount of precipitate formed, but at a lower rate. Addition of increasing amounts of L-thyroxine to ribonuclease and thyroglobulin, or to cytochrome c do not result in insoluble complex formation. 4. Experiments with 13iI-thyroxine and with 3H-lysozyme, which retains 70% of its enzymatic activity after exposure to tritium gas, confirm the participation of the two reactants in the insoluble complex.
