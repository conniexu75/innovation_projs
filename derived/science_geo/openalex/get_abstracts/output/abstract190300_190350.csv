Then the proportion S of animals remaining uninfected after the intake of n organisms each is given by: S = (1 — λ)n, and by definition 0.5 = (1 — λ)c, Expressing n in units of c that is, n = fc, S = (1 — λ)fc = 0.5f."

More recently it was shown2,3 that for many of the indigenous soil bacteria dependent upon essential growth-factors supplied by soil extract, the nutrilite effect of the latter could be replaced by vitamin B12. Other micro-organisms, however, remained dependent upon unidentified growth-promoting substances in soil."

https://openalex.org/W4250293089,"WHEN whole normal blood clots in a glass tube, the generation of thrombin can be observed by removing 0.1-ml. amounts at intervals and adding these to fibrinogen. The clotting times of the fibrinogen samples will record the amount of thrombin present. When this is done, it is found that there is a phase lasting 3–4 min. in Which no thrombin can be detected. Thereafter an extremely rapid formation of thrombin occurs, and all the prothrombin is converted to thrombin in 2 or 3 min. This separation of thrombin formation into two phases suggests that there is a powerful intrinsic thromboplastic activity of blood, but that 3–4 min. are required for its formation."

https://openalex.org/W1972381231,"IN a recent communication in Nature, further evidence was presented by Dr. E. Elliot1 relating to the concept of Giltay2, and supported afterwards by Priestley and Scott3, that at cell division each daughter protoplast secretes a continuous wall around itself. The suggestion was also made that this method of cell-wall formation may prove to be general in the higher plants. Recent work in this laboratory on cell division in the cambium of angiosperms and gymnosperms further supports this suggestion."

https://openalex.org/W1996607395,"FERGUSON1, in a discussion in a paper entitled “Heritable Antigens in Erythrocytes of Cattle”, raised the possibility that certain of these cellular antigens may be used as ‘markers’ in a study of the inheritance of complex physiological characters such as milk production. Filmer (personal communication) suggested that the most logical antigen production factors to test would be antigen A and butterfat test, because of the direct correlation between high frequency of antigen A and of high butterfat test in Jersey, and low frequency of antigen A and low butterfat test in Friesian cattle. Owen et al.2 reported that 87.6 per cent of a group of Guernsey and 46.1 per cent of a group of Holstein Friesian cattle carried antigen A. Stormont (personal communication) mentioned that the frequency of antigen A in Jersey cattle is similar to that of Guernsey cattle. Results from New Zealand showed a frequency of antigen A in Jerseys and Friesians of an order similar to, but lower than, Owen's Guernsey and Friesian frequencies."

https://openalex.org/W2011743358,"ON the basis of studies of Chlorella mutants a biosynthetic chain has been formulated leading from protoporphyrin through Mg protoporphyrin, Mg vinyl pheoporphyrin and protochlorophyll finally to chlorophyll1. We have recently isolated a Chlorella mutant which promises to reveal some of the precursor porphyrins leading up to protoporphyrin."
https://openalex.org/W2014773006,"THE employment of radioautographic techniques has been of much value in botanical studies in demonstrating the presence and localization of tracer elements within plant organs and tissue. In this respect the work of Arnon et al.1, Colwell2, and Harrison et al.3, may be cited as typical. Pearson et al.4 prepared radioautographs of fungus cultures, but stated that because of the limitations of the materials and methods employed it was not possible to obtain radioautographs of single cells or hyphae. Boyd et al.5, however, were able to obtain single cell autographs of leucocytes and erythrocytes. More recently, Fitzgerald et al.6, using tritium, obtained radioautographs of single yeast cells and Paramecia."

https://openalex.org/W2095364236,"INTRAVENOUS injection of small doses of adrenaline has been observed to cause a temporary reduction of the flow of urine in water-loaded dogs1,2. According to Pickford and Watt2, this action of adrenaline is dependent on alterations in renal blood pressure and flow1. We believe We have obtained evidence for the release of the antidiuretic hormone by moderate doses of adrenaline."

https://openalex.org/W1993728348,"MOSQUITOES which on dissection show infective filarial forms are often regarded as vectors of human filariasis in a particular area where mosquito collections are made. As mosquitoes of the same species may also play the part of vectors of animal filarial infections, findings in any given area have to be interpreted carefully. A short account of conditions pertaining in a small village in Sakhigopal, Orissa State, India, Where Wuchereria bancrofti is the known cause of filarial infection in man, is given below."
https://openalex.org/W2038578425,THE two essentials for successful tissue culture are a sufficient supply of nutrients and adequate aeration. In the culture of plant embryos from an early stage of development it is also often desirable that cultures shall be suitable for microscopical examination.
https://openalex.org/W2056758753,"DEHYDROCHLORINATION of DDT by certain chemicals concerns not only agriculture1 but is also of great importance in anti-mosquito campaigns. A major factor here is the time during which DDT, sprayed on walls of houses, retains its insecticidal power. It has been shown2 that great differences may exist between apparently identical walls, and that iron and aluminium ions are responsible for rapid dehydrochlorination. The difference in the percentage of mosquitoes killed on wooden and pisé walls, as reported by Wilkinson3, might perhaps be explained on these lines."

These have been related mainly to relatively slow potential variations, of the nature of retinal potentials, recorded from the eye itself. In addition, impulses in the circum-œsophageal commissures of Locusta migratoria correlated with changes of illumination have been reported2."
