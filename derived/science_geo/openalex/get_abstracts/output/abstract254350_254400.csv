https://openalex.org/W2046713808,"Theories of instrumental learning are centred on understanding how success and failure are used to improve future decisions. These theories highlight a central role for reward prediction errors in updating the values associated with available actions. In animals, substantial evidence indicates that the neurotransmitter dopamine might have a key function in this type of learning, through its ability to modulate cortico-striatal synaptic efficacy. However, no direct evidence links dopamine, striatal activity and behavioural choice in humans. Here we show that, during instrumental learning, the magnitude of reward prediction error expressed in the striatum is modulated by the administration of drugs enhancing (3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine; L-DOPA) or reducing (haloperidol) dopaminergic function. Accordingly, subjects treated with L-DOPA have a greater propensity to choose the most rewarding action relative to subjects treated with haloperidol. Furthermore, incorporating the magnitude of the prediction errors into a standard action-value learning algorithm accurately reproduced subjects' behavioural choices under the different drug conditions. We conclude that dopamine-dependent modulation of striatal activity can account for how the human brain uses reward prediction errors to improve future decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2023150460,"Since it was first suggested1 that a single molecule might function as an active electronic component, a number of techniques have been developed to measure the charge transport properties of single molecules2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. Although scanning tunnelling microscopy observations under high vacuum conditions can allow stable measurements of electron transport, most measurements of a single molecule bonded in a metal–molecule–metal junction exhibit relatively large variations in conductance. As a result, even simple predictions about how molecules behave in such junctions have still not been rigorously tested. For instance, it is well known13,14 that the tunnelling current passing through a molecule depends on its conformation; but although some experiments have verified this effect15,16,17,18, a comprehensive mapping of how junction conductance changes with molecular conformation is not yet available. In the simple case of a biphenyl—a molecule with two phenyl rings linked by a single C–C bond—conductance is expected to change with the relative twist angle between the two rings, with the planar conformation having the highest conductance. Here we use amine link groups to form single-molecule junctions with more reproducible current–voltage characteristics19. This allows us to extract average conductance values from thousands of individual measurements on a series of seven biphenyl molecules with different ring substitutions that alter the twist angle of the molecules. We find that the conductance for the series decreases with increasing twist angle, consistent with a cosine-squared relation predicted for transport through π-conjugated biphenyl systems13."

The others, sour (or 'acid') and salt, were elusive. Now the cells and a candidate receptor mediating sour taste have been identified. PKD2L1, a polycystic kidney disease-like ion channel, is proposed to act as part of the mammalian sour taste receptor, and shown to define the population of cells on the tongue required for sour taste. PKD2L1 is also found in neurons around the central canal of the spinal cord that trigger action potentials in response to a fall in extracellular pH. These cells could be long-sought components of the cerebrospinal fluid chemosensory system. This work points to a common basis for acid sensing in very different physiological settings. On the cover, tongue tissue with taste receptor cells labelled red for sour sensing and green for sweet, umami and bitter. Mammals taste many compounds yet use a sensory palette consisting of only five basic taste modalities: sweet, bitter, sour, salty and umami (the taste of monosodium glutamate)1,2. Although this repertoire may seem modest, it provides animals with critical information about the nature and quality of food. Sour taste detection functions as an important sensory input to warn against the ingestion of acidic (for example, spoiled or unripe) food sources1,2,3. We have used a combination of bioinformatics, genetic and functional studies to identify PKD2L1, a polycystic-kidney-disease-like ion channel4, as a candidate mammalian sour taste sensor. In the tongue, PKD2L1 is expressed in a subset of taste receptor cells distinct from those responsible for sweet, bitter and umami taste. To examine the role of PKD2L1-expressing taste cells in vivo, we engineered mice with targeted genetic ablations of selected populations of taste receptor cells. Animals lacking PKD2L1-expressing cells are completely devoid of taste responses to sour stimuli. Notably, responses to all other tastants remained unaffected, proving that the segregation of taste qualities even extends to ionic stimuli. Our results now establish independent cellular substrates for four of the five basic taste modalities, and support a comprehensive labelled-line mode of taste coding at the periphery5,6,7,8,9,10. Notably, PKD2L1 is also expressed in specific neurons surrounding the central canal of the spinal cord. Here we demonstrate that these PKD2L1-expressing neurons send projections to the central canal, and selectively trigger action potentials in response to decreases in extracellular pH. We propose that these cells correspond to the long-sought components of the cerebrospinal fluid chemosensory system11. Taken together, our results suggest a common basis for acid sensing in disparate physiological settings."

https://openalex.org/W2035595761,"In higher eukaryotes, a multiprotein exon junction complex is deposited on spliced messenger RNAs. The complex is organized around a stable core, which serves as a binding platform for numerous factors that influence messenger RNA function. Here, we present the crystal structure of a tetrameric exon junction core complex containing the DEAD-box adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) eukaryotic initiation factor 4AIII (eIF4AIII) bound to an ATP analog, MAGOH, Y14, a fragment of MLN51, and a polyuracil mRNA mimic. eIF4AIII interacts with the phosphate-ribose backbone of six consecutive nucleotides and prevents part of the bound RNA from being double stranded. The MAGOH and Y14 subunits lock eIF4AIII in a prehydrolysis state, and activation of the ATPase probably requires only modest conformational changes in eIF4AIII motif I."

https://openalex.org/W2018295108,"An important factor that will determine the therapeutic potential of RNA interference (RNAi) is the longevity of its inhibitory effect. Previously the inheritance of RNAi induced transcriptional silencing was demonstrated for one generation in mice. Now a single RNAi episode in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is shown to induce transcriptional silencing that is inherited indefinitely over generations of sexual reproduction, in the absence of the trigger and of RNAi machinery. Small RNA molecules participate in a variety of activities in the cell: in a process known as RNA interference (RNAi), double-stranded RNA triggers the degradation of messenger RNA that has a matching sequence; the small RNA intermediates of this process can also modify gene expression in the nucleus1. Here we show that a single episode of RNAi in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans can induce transcriptional silencing effects that are inherited indefinitely in the absence of the original trigger. Our findings may prove useful in the ongoing development of RNAi to treat disease."

Loss-of-function mutations in <i>RET</i> are implicated in Hirschsprung disease, whereas activating mutations in <i>RET</i> are found in human cancers, including familial medullar thyroid carcinoma and multiple endocrine neoplasias 2A and 2B. We report here the biochemical characterization of the human RET tyrosine kinase domain and the structure determination of the non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated forms. Both structures adopt the same active kinase conformation competent to bind ATP and substrate and have a pre-organized activation loop conformation that is independent of phosphorylation status. In agreement with the structural data, enzyme kinetic data show that autophosphorylation produces only a modest increase in activity. Longer forms of RET containing the juxtamembrane domain and C-terminal tail exhibited similar kinetic behavior, implying that there is no <i>cis</i>-inhibitory mechanism within the RET intracellular domain. Our results suggest the existence of alternative inhibitory mechanisms, possibly in <i>trans</i>, for the autoregulation of RET kinase activity. We also present the structures of the RET tyrosine kinase domain bound to two inhibitors, the pyrazolopyrimidine PP1 and the clinically relevant 4-anilinoquinazoline ZD6474. These structures explain why certain multiple endocrine neoplasia 2-associated RET mutants found in patients are resistant to inhibition and form the basis for design of more effective inhibitors."

Although several stromal cells and molecular pathways have been identified, the microenvironment of the stem cell niche remains largely unclear.

In this report, we demonstrate that hypoxia reversibly arrests preadipocytes in an undifferentiated state. Consistent with this observation, hypoxia maintains the expression of pref-1, a key stem/precursor cell gene that negatively regulates adipogenic differentiation.

Our findings suggest that hypoxia in the stem cell niche is critical for the maintenance of the undifferentiated stem or precursor cell phenotype. Stem and/or precursor cells exist in a distinct tissue structure called the niche that regulates the self-renewal and differentiation of stem cells (1Eckfeldt C.E. Mendenhall E.M. Verfaillie C.M.

However, the role of hypoxia in stem cell maintenance remains to be fully understood. Hypoxia can regulate cellular differentiation. Under hypoxic conditions, the differentiation of embryonal stem cells, as well as precursor cells is inhibited (4Ezashi T. Das P. Roberts R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Studies in cancer biology have shown that hypoxia is strongly correlated with an undifferentiated phenotype in solid tumors such as neuroblastoma (7Jogi A. Ora I. Nilsson H. Poellinger L. Axelson H. Pahlman S. Cancer Lett. 2003; 197: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), breast cancer (8Helczynska K. Kronblad A. Jogi A. Nilsson E. Beckman S. Landberg G. Pahlman S.

Cellular response to hypoxia is manifested by the activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), 4The abbreviations used are: HIF-1, hypoxia-inducible factor-1; ODD, O2-dependent degradation; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ; siRNA, small interfering RNA; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; DFO, deferoxamine mesylate; ADVM, adipose-derived vascular-mesenchymal. 4The abbreviations used are: HIF-1, hypoxia-inducible factor-1; ODD, O2-dependent degradation; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ; siRNA, small interfering RNA; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; DFO, deferoxamine mesylate; ADVM, adipose-derived vascular-mesenchymal. a transcription factor of the basic helix-loop-helix Per, Arnt, and Sim family (10Semenza G.L.

HIF-1 consists of the O2-regulated HIF-1α subunit and the O2-independent HIF-1β subunit. Under normoxia, HIF-1α protein becomes hydroxylated at proline-402 and proline-564 in its O2-dependent degradation (ODD) domain and is targeted by the von Hippel-Lindau protein for proteasome-mediated degradation (10Semenza G.L.

As pO2 decreases to hypoxic levels, HIF-1α is no longer hydroxylated and thus becomes stabilized. Upon nuclear translocation, HIF-1α dimerizes with the O2-independent HIF-1β to initiate gene transcription (10Semenza G.L. Physiology (Bethesda). 2004; 19: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 11Maxwell P.H. Exp. Physiol. 2005; 90: 791-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar).

Conversely, the prodifferentiation gene, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), is down-regulated as a result of HIF activation (6Yun Z. Maecker H.L. Johnson R.S. Giaccia A.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Using the 3T3-L1 preadipocytes as a model, we have investigated the effects of hypoxia on the maintenance of the precursor phenotype. Our data demonstrate that the preadipocytes treated with adipogenic hormones under hypoxia maintain their precursor phenotype and can fully commit to adipogenic differentiation upon returning to normoxia. We have also found that hypoxia is capable of maintaining the preadipocyte phenotype of the adipose-derived primary mesenchymal cells. Based on these findings, we propose that hypoxia plays an essential role in the maintenance of stem and/or precursor cells. Our results underline the importance of hypoxia in the stem cell niche. Plasmids—The siRNA against HIF-1α was cloned into pSI-REN-RetroQ between BamHI and EcoRI (BD Biosciences). The sequences for the siRNA against HIF-1α are: 5′-GATCCGTCTAGAGATGCAGCAAGATTCAAGAGATCTTGCTGCATCTCTAGACTTTTTTG-3′ (sense strand) and 5′-AATTCAAAAAAGTCTAGAGATGCAGCAAGATCTCTTGAATCTTGCTGCATCTCTAGACG-3′ (antisense strand). The sequences for the scrambled siRNA sequence are: 5′-GATCCTCAGAACGATGACTGAGAGTTCAAGAGACTCTCAGTCATCGTTCTGATTTTTTG-3′ (sense strand) and 5′-AATTCAAAAAATCAGAACGATGACTGAGAGTCTCTTGAACTCTCAGTCATCGTTCTGAG-3′ (antisense strand). The scrambled siRNA sequence did not share homology to any known mammalian genes in the GenBank™ data bank. These constructs were sequence-verified using a primer for the U6 promoter. The constitutively active HIF-1α mutants: ΔODD (deletion of the oxygen-dependent degradation domain) and Pro/Mut (P402G/P564A) were described previously (5Yun Z. Lin Q. Giaccia A.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 3040-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Adipogenic Differentiation—3T3-L1 preadipocytes (ATCC) were maintained in growth medium: DMEM containing 10% calf serum and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. For adipogenic differentiation (6Yun Z. Maecker H.L. Johnson R.S. Giaccia A.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), confluent 3T3-L1 cells were maintained in growth medium for 2 days before stimulation for 2 days in the differentiation medium: DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and IDM (10 μg/ml insulin, 1 μm dexamethasone, and 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine). Cells were then maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 μg/ml insulin, and the medium was replaced every other day. For retroviral infection, 3T3-L1 cells were infected at 30–50% confluence as described previously (5Yun Z. Lin Q. Giaccia A.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 3040-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 6Yun Z. Maecker H.L. Johnson R.S. Giaccia A.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The infected cells were allowed to reach confluence and subjected to differentiation as described above. For hypoxia treatment, preadipocytes were maintained in a hypoxia chamber (Invivo2 400, Ruskinn Inc.), and the media were replaced every other day inside the chamber. In this study, normoxia was considered as the ambient atmosphere containing 21% O2 and hypoxia, 1% O2. Deferoxamine mesylate (DFO, Sigma) was used to mimic the hypoxic effects at 21% O2 (6Yun Z. Maecker H.L. Johnson R.S. Giaccia A.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Mature adipocytes were visualized by staining with 60% of the Oil Red O solution, as described previously (6Yun Z. Maecker H.L. Johnson R.S. Giaccia A.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). For quantitative analysis, the cell-absorbed Oil Red O was extracted in 100% isopropyl alcohol, and optical density was measured at 510 nm. Isolation and Differentiation of Adipose-derived Vascular-Mesenchymal (ADVM) Cells—Epididymal fat pads were aseptically excised from four 5–6-week-old BALB/c mice. Fat pads were minced with scissors and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C in a collagenase buffer containing 0.1 m HEPES at pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 5.2 mm KCl, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 0.09% d-glucose, 1.5% bovine serum albumin, and 1% Type I collagenase (Worthington Biochemical Co., Lakewood, NJ). The undigested tissue was removed by filtration through a nylon mesh. Adipocytes were removed by centrifugation. Red blood cells were eliminated by resuspension of cell pellets in red blood cell lysis buffer containing 155 mm NH4Cl, 5.7 mm K2HPO4, and 0.1 mm EDTA at pH 7.3. After washing, ADVM cells were plated in preadipocyte growth medium and expanded for 1–2 additional passages. For the adipogenesis assay, ADVM cells were plated in triplicates into 24-well plates. The confluent monolayer culture was differentiated using the standard IDM protocol. Northern and Western Blotting—Total cellular RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The following plasmids were used for cDNA template preparations: MSV-C/EBPα, MSV-C/EBPβ, and MSV-C/EBPδ (S. L. McKnight), pSVsport-PPARγ2 and pBS-adipsin (B. M. Spiegelman), pTrcHis-adiponectin (H. F. Lodish), pCMV-Sport6.1-pref-1 (IMAGE 6393667), pCMV-Sport6.1-AP2α (IMAGE 6438317), pBabe-GATA3 (G. S. Hotamisligil). The cDNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. Hybridization was carried out at 65 °C for 6–12 h. The radioactive blots were exposed to Kodak Biomax films or alternatively visualized on Storm 860 PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). For Western blotting analysis, cell lysates were prepared on ice using 25 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete™, Roche Diagnostics). Equal amounts of proteins were analyzed with the following primary antibodies: polyclonal rabbit anti-pref-1 (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA), anti-β-tubulin (CRP, Inc.), according to the chemiluminescence method. For detection of HIF-1α, HIF-1β, and HIF-2α, nuclear extracts were prepared using the high salt extraction method as described previously (5Yun Z. Lin Q. Giaccia A.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 3040-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibody against HIF-1α, HIF-1β, and HIF-2α were purchased from Novus Biologicals, Inc. (Littleton, CO). Statistical Analysis—The statistical difference between two groups was analyzed by the two-tailed, unpaired Student's t test using Prizm 3.0cx (GraphPad Software Inc.). Significant difference between two groups was declared if p < 0.05. Hypoxia Maintains Precursor Phenotype—Adipogenic differentiation is controlled by sequential expression of adipocyte-related genes (15Ntambi J.M. Young-Cheul K. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 3122S-3126SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1293-1307PubMed Google Scholar). During the normal differentiation of preadipocytes (lanes 2–8, Fig. 1), CAAT enhancer binding protein β (C/EBPβ) and C/EBPδ (Group I) were induced within hours of adipogenic stimulation by the IDM mixture. The adipogenic determination genes PPARγ2 and C/EBPα (Group II) were induced between 24 and 48 h after the IDM treatment. The mature adipocytes were characterized by the expression of aP2, adipsin, and adiponectin (Group III). The key event during adipogenesis is the transcriptional induction of PPARγ2 and/or C/EBPα (15Ntambi J.M. Young-Cheul K. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 3122S-3126SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1293-1307PubMed Google Scholar). Hypoxia inhibited adipogenic differentiation of preadipocytes. At the transcriptional level, hypoxia repressed the expression of the essential adipogenic genes PPARγ2 and C/EBPα (lanes 9–14, Fig. 1). The lack of adipocyte-specific genes: aP2, adipsin, and adiponectin (Group III, lanes 9–14, Fig. 1), confirmed that no terminal differentiation occurred under hypoxia. Hypoxia had minimal effect on the expression of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ within the first 24 h of the adipogenic stimulation (lanes 9–11 versus lanes 3–5, Fig. 1). However, the effect of hypoxia on the expression of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ became more pronounced after 2 days of hypoxia treatment (lanes 12–14, Fig. 1), as compared with the normoxia control (lanes 6–8, Fig. 1). The latter phenomenon may indicate cellular adaptation to the chronic exposure to hypoxia. Further analysis is warranted for mechanistic understanding of the transcriptional regulation of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ under chronic hypoxia. Nevertheless, this result suggests that the endogenously induced C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ are not sufficient to facilitate the transcription of PPARγ2 and/or C/EBPα under hypoxia. Our previous study showed that the hypoxia-induced transcription repressor DEC1/Stra13 repressed PPARγ2 expression and was sufficient to inhibit adipogenesis (6Yun Z. Maecker H.L. Johnson R.S. Giaccia A.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). As shown by our data, the transcriptional induction of PPARγ2 is repressed by hypoxia in the IDM-treated preadipocytes. In contrast, hypoxia does not seem to affect the steady-state transcription of PPARγ2 in mature adipocytes (17Chen B. Lam K.S. Wang Y. Wu D. Lam M.C. Shen J. Wong L. Hoo R.L. Zhang J. Xu A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 341: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Such discrepancy may suggest the transcriptional regulation of PPARγ2 in mature adipocytes is different from that in preadipocytes. Three possibilities exist for the fate of the preadipocytes that have been stimulated by the adipogenic IDM mixture under hypoxia. First, the hypoxia-treated preadipocytes remain undifferentiated despite adipogenic stimulation. Second, these preadipocytes are committed to, but are blocked from, terminal differentiation under hypoxia. Third, the precursor phenotype is altered by hypoxia and thus unable to undergo adipogenesis. To test these hypotheses, we treated 3T3-L1 cells for 4 days under hypoxia (1% O2 or the hypoxia-mimetic compound DFO) with or without IDM, allowed the cells to recover for 2 days at 21% O2, and then restimulated with IDM or left untreated for 6 days (Fig. 2A). As a control, 3T3-L1 cells differentiated into Oil Red O-positive adipocytes at 21% O2 after IDM treatment but not under hypoxic conditions (Fig. 2B). Quantitative differences were shown in Fig. 2E (“B: Control”). 3T3-L1 cells pretreated by hypoxia alone retained the full differentiation ability upon restimulation by IDM (Fig. 2C and “C: Hypoxia” in Fig. 2E), indicating that hypoxia per se does not affect the adipogenic potential of preadipocytes. Interestingly, preadipocytes pretreated with IDM under hypoxia remained undifferentiated even after returning to normoxia (Fig. 2D and “D: Hypoxia/IDM” in Fig. 2E), indicating that these preadipocytes were not committed to terminal differentiation. Nevertheless, they were able to fully differentiate into adipocytes upon restimulation with IDM (Fig. 2D and “D: Hypoxia/IDM” in Fig. 2E), proving that hypoxia arrested the preadipocytes in their precursor stage without reducing their adipogenic potential. We obtained the same results when preadipocytes were pretreated for 6 days under hypoxia in the presence of IDM before returning to normoxia (data not shown). To further test this hypothesis, we used primary ADVM cells isolated from mouse epididymal fat pads. The ADVM cells contained a subpopulation of precursor cells capable of adipogenic differentiation in response to IDM (Fig. 2F). Consistent with the observations using 3T3-L1 cells, hypoxia inhibited the adipogenic differentiation of the ADVM cells (Fig. 2F). Our data further showed that the ADVM cells pretreated under hypoxia were still capable of adipogenic differentiation upon returning to normoxia (Fig. 2G). These results suggest that hypoxia has the potential to arrest the primary adipose precursor cells in the undifferentiated state in vivo. Hypoxia Maintains the Expression of pref-1—Preadipocytes express a distinct set of precursor cell genes including the transmembrane protein pref-1 (18Villena J.A. Kim K.H. Sul H.S. Horm. Metab.

Lee S. Kang C. Sul H.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the transcription factor AP-2α has the potential to inhibit the transcription of C/EBPα (20Jiang M.S. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12519-12523Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The transcription factor GATA-3 can repress the transcription of PPARγ2 (21Tong Q. Dalgin G. Xu H. Ting C.N. Leiden J.M. Hotamisligil G.S. Science. 2000; 290: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is not clear how these preadipocyte genes potentially interact to maintain the preadipocyte phenotype. Under the normal differentiation condition of 21% O2, the decrease of pref-1 mRNA after adipogenic stimulation (lanes 5 and 6, Fig. 3A) coincided with the robust induction of both PPARγ2 and C/EBPα (lanes 5 and 6, Fig. 1) within first 2 days of IDM treatment. In contrast, pref-1 mRNA remained elevated for the entire 6 days at 1% O2 despite adipogenic stimulation by IDM (lanes 9–14, Fig. 3A). The expression of GATA-3 rapidly decreased within 2 h following IDM treatment at either 21 or 1% O2 (lanes 3 and 9, Fig. 3A), suggesting that hypoxia does not affect transcriptional regulation of GATA-3. The expression of AP-2α was also rapidly repressed within 2 h of adipogenic stimulation at 21% O2 (lane 3, Fig. 3A). Hypoxia only partially prevented the down-regulation of AP-2α by IDM (lane 9, Fig. 3A). Taken together, these findings suggest that the maintenance of pref-1 mRNA by hypoxia may be a critical mechanism by which hypoxia regulates the preadipocyte phenotype. Consistent with its mRNA, pref-1 protein was also maintained at elevated levels under hypoxia (lanes 7–11, Fig. 3C) in IDM-treated preadipocytes. We further found that hypoxia did not affect the half-life of either pref-1 mRNA or protein (data not shown). These observations suggest that the persistent expression of pref-1 protein under hypoxia in IDM-treated preadipocytes results from the sustained transcription of pref-1 mRNA under hypoxia. We next investigated the role of HIF in the regulation of pref-1 expression. HIF-1α mRNA is constitutively expressed from preadipocytes (lanes 1 and 2, supplemental Fig. 1A) to mature adipocytes (lanes 7 and 8, supplemental Fig. 1A). The expression of HIF-1α protein is controlled by its posttranslational hydroxylation of proline residues (10Semenza G.L. Physiology (Bethesda). 2004; 19: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 11Maxwell P.H. Exp. Physiol. 2005; 90: 791-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The levels of HIF-1α protein changed only slightly during adipogenic differentiation at 21% O2 but was robustly induced by hypoxia (lanes 7 and 8, Fig. 3D) before returning to the basal level after 2 days (lanes 9–11, Fig. 3D). On the other hand, the O2-insensitive HIF-1β subunit was not affected by hypoxia nor did its expression change during adipogenic differentiation (Fig. 3D). HIF-2α, the structurally and functionally related homologue of HIF-1α (10Semenza G.L. Physiology (Bethesda). 2004; 19: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 11Maxwell P.H. Exp. Physiol. 2005; 90: 791-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), showed a distinct profile of expression during adipogenesis. HIF-2α mRNA was not found in preadipocytes (lanes 1 and 2, supplemental Fig. 1B) but was expressed in differentiating adipocytes after IDM stimulation (lanes 3–7, supplemental Fig. 1B). Similarly, HIF-2α protein was not detected in preadipocytes but only in differentiated adipocytes after 4 days of adipogenesis at 21% O2 (lanes 5 and 6, Fig. 3E). Consistent with our findings, Shimba et al. (24Shimba S. Wada T. Hara S. Tezuka M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40946-40953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) also reported that HIF-2α protein was only found in mature adipocytes but not in preadipocytes. Our data also revealed that HIF-2α protein was mainly detected in whole cell lysates (WCL) of adipocytes (lanes 5 and 6, Fig. 3E). These results indicate that HIF-2α protein is primarily expressed in mature adipocytes and is likely to be regulated by a hypoxia-independent pathway. In contrast, HIF-1α is the predominant hypoxia-sensing pathway in preadipocytes. However, we found that neither HIF-1 nor hypoxia affected the transcription activity of a 10-kb rat pref-1 promoter in preadipocytes using the luciferase reporter gene assay (data not shown). In addition, ectopic expression of constitutively active HIF-1α did not have significant effect on the expression of pref-1 mRNA or its protein (supplemental Fig. 2). As shown recently, hypoxia regulates histone deacetylase activity in stem cells (25Maltepe E. Krampitz G.W. Okazaki K.M. Red-Horse K. Mak W. Simon M.C. Fisher S.J. Development (Camb.). 2005; 132: 3393-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It is possible that hypoxia may regulate pref-1 expression in preadipocyte via modulation of histone deacetylase activities. It has also been shown that dexamethasone in the IDM mixture can cause down-regulation of pref-1 transcription (26Smas C.M. Chen L. Zhao L. Latasa M.J. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12632-12641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that hypoxia may block the dexamethasone-dependent repression of pref-1 transcription. We further investigated whether knocking down pref-1 protein by siRNA could rescue adipogenic differentiation under hypoxia. Down-regulation of pref-1 alone did not restore adipogenesis under hypoxia (data not shown), suggesting that maintenance of precursor phenotype requires multiple preadipocyte genes. HIF-1 Is Involved in Maintenance of Preadipocytes—Because HIF-1 is the predominant hypoxia-signal transduction pathway in preadipocytes, we investigated the role of HIF-1 in the regulation of the preadipocyte phenotype. We used siRNA to specifically repress the expression of HIF-1α protein. We found that HIF-1α protein was no longer induced by hypoxia in the siRNA-expressing cells (lanes 5 and 6 versus lanes 2 and 3 and lanes 8 and 9, Fig. 4C). Consistent with the knocking down of HIF-1α protein, the HIF-dependent transcription was also repressed in cells treated with the siRNA as compared with those treated with vector control or the scrambled siRNA (Fig. 4D). Importantly, when HIF-1α was repressed by siRNA, the preadipocytes were able to undergo adipogenic differentiation in the presence of the hypoxic mimetic compound DFO (Fig. 4, A and B). However, knocking down HIF-1α protein by siRNA was not sufficient to restore adipogenic differentiation under the low pO2 condition (data not shown). This discrepancy could potentially be explained by the fact that pref-1 expression was not directly affected by HIF-1 but was rather maintained under the low pO2 condition. Nevertheless, ectopic expression of the constitutively active HIF-1α protein mutants completely prevented preadipocytes from undergoing adipogenic differentiation (Fig. 4F). Under the same condition, the preadipocytes infected with a control retroviral vector differentiated normally into mature adipocytes (Oil Red O-positive). Consistent with our previous findings (6Yun Z. Maecker H.L. Johnson R.S. Giaccia A.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), adipogenic differentiation was completely blocked in preadipocytes infected with retrovirus containing DEC1/Stra13, a transcription repressor for PPARγ2 expression and a direct target of HIF-1 (Fig. 4F). These results indicate that HIF-1 plays a direct role in regulation of preadipocyte differentiation. Significance—Recent evidence suggests that stem cells may reside in a hypoxic microenvironment (3Ceradini D.J. Kulkarni A.R. Callaghan M.J. Tepper O.M. Bastidas N. Kleinman M.E. Capla J.M. Galiano R.D. Levine J.P. Gurtner G.C. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 858-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar). Our study demonstrated that hypoxia was able to maintain preadipocytes in their undifferentiated state without decreasing their differentiation potential. Our observations suggest that hypoxia in the stem cell niche may be important for the maintenance of the undifferentiated stem cell phenotype. The HIF-1 pathway potentially constitutes an important mechanism in the maintenance of stem/precursor cells. We thank the following colleagues who generously provided us with plasmids: Dr. B. M.

https://openalex.org/W2052384637,"Elongation factor eEF3 is an ATPase that, in addition to the two canonical factors eEF1A and eEF2, serves an essential function in the translation cycle of fungi. eEF3 is required for the binding of the aminoacyl-tRNA-eEF1A-GTP ternary complex to the ribosomal A-site and has been suggested to facilitate the clearance of deacyl-tRNA from the E-site. Here we present the crystal structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae eEF3, showing that it consists of an amino-terminal HEAT repeat domain, followed by a four-helix bundle and two ABC-type ATPase domains, with a chromodomain inserted in ABC2. Moreover, we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the ATP-bound form of eEF3 in complex with the post-translocational-state 80S ribosome from yeast. eEF3 uses an entirely new factor binding site near the ribosomal E-site, with the chromodomain likely to stabilize the ribosomal L1 stalk in an open conformation, thus allowing tRNA release."
https://openalex.org/W2006659423,"A quantum point contact (QPC) is a narrow constriction between two wider electron reservoirs, and is the standard building block of sub-micrometre devices such as quantum dots and qubits (the proposed basic elements of quantum computers). The conductance through a QPC changes as a function of its width in integer steps of G(0) = 2e2/h (where e is the charge on an electron, and h is Planck's constant), signalling the quantization of its transverse modes. But measurements of these conductance steps also reveal an additional shoulder at a value around 0.7G(0) (refs 1-4), an observation that has remained a puzzle for more than a decade. It has recently been suggested that this phenomenon can be explained by the existence of a magnetic 'impurity' in the QPC at low electron densities. Here we present extensive numerical density-functional calculations that reveal the formation of an electronic state with a spin-1/2 magnetic moment in the channel under very general conditions. In addition, we show that such an impurity will also form at large magnetic fields, for a specific value of the field, and sometimes even at the opening of the second transverse mode in the QPC. Beyond explaining the source of the '0.7 anomaly', these results may have far-reaching implications for spin-filling of electronic states in quantum dots and for the dephasing of quantum information stored in semiconductor qubits."
https://openalex.org/W1966503522,Detailed high-resolution observations of the innermost regions of nearby galaxies have revealed the presence of supermassive black holes. These black holes may interact with their host galaxies by means of 'feedback' in the form of energy and material jets; this feedback affects the evolution of the host and gives rise to observed relations between the black hole and the host. Here we report observations of the ultraviolet emissions of massive early-type galaxies. We derive an empirical relation for a critical black-hole mass (as a function of velocity dispersion) above which the outflows from these black holes suppress star formation in their hosts by heating and expelling all available cold gas. Supermassive black holes are negligible in mass compared to their hosts but nevertheless seem to play a critical role in the star formation history of galaxies.

https://openalex.org/W2024250469,"Micromolar concentrations of extracellular beta-NAD+ (NAD(e)+) activate human granulocytes (superoxide and NO generation and chemotaxis) by triggering: (i) overproduction of cAMP, (ii) activation of protein kinase A, (iii) stimulation of ADP-ribosyl cyclase and overproduction of cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR), a universal Ca2+ mobilizer, and (iv) influx of extracellular Ca2+. Here we demonstrate that exposure of granulocytes to millimolar rather than to micromolar NAD(e)+ generates both inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and cAMP, with a two-step elevation of intracellular calcium levels ([Ca2+]i): a rapid, IP3-mediated Ca2+ release, followed by a sustained influx of extracellular Ca2+ mediated by cADPR. Suramin, an inhibitor of P2Y receptors, abrogated NAD(e)+-induced intracellular increases of IP3, cAMP, cADPR, and [Ca2+]i, suggesting a role for a P2Y receptor coupled to both phospholipase C and adenylyl cyclase. The P2Y(11) receptor is the only known member of the P2Y receptor subfamily coupled to both phospholipase C and adenylyl cyclase. Therefore, we performed experiments on hP2Y(11)-transfected 1321N1 astrocytoma cells: micromolar NAD(e)+ promoted a two-step elevation of the [Ca2+]i due to the enhanced intracellular production of IP3, cAMP, and cADPR in 1321N1-hP2Y(11) but not in untransfected 1321N1 cells. In human granulocytes NF157, a selective and potent inhibitor of P2Y(11), and the down-regulation of P2Y(11) expression by short interference RNA prevented NAD(e)+-induced intracellular increases of [Ca2+]i and chemotaxis. These results demonstrate that beta-NAD(e)+ is an agonist of the P2Y(11) purinoceptor and that P2Y(11) is the endogenous receptor in granulocytes mediating the sustained [Ca2+]i increase responsible for their functional activation."
https://openalex.org/W2088559146,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are secreted polypeptides belonging to the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily that activates a broad range of biological responses in the metazoan organism. The BMP-initiated signaling pathway is under tight control by processes including regulation of the ligands, the receptors, and the key downstream intracellular effector Smads. A critical point of control in BMP signaling is the phosphorylation of Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 in their C-terminal SXS motif. Although such phosphorylation, which is mediated by the type I BMP receptor kinases in response to BMP stimulation, is well characterized, biochemical mechanisms underlying Smad dephosphorylation remain to be elucidated. In this study, we have found that PPM1A, a metal ion-dependent protein serine/threonine phosphatase, physically interacts with and dephosphorylates Smad1 both in vitro and in vivo. Functionally, overexpression of PPM1A abolishes BMP-induced transcriptional responses, whereas RNA interference-mediated knockdown of PPM1A enhances BMP signaling.

Science. 1965; 150: 893-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (4463) Google Scholar), are signaling molecules that belong to the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily. Presently, the biological functions of BMPs have been greatly expanded. BMPs regulate skeletal development as well as many non-osteogenic developmental processes, such as mesoderm patterning, left-right symmetry, neuronal patterning, and hematopoiesis (2Chen D. Zhao M. Harris S.E. Mi Z. Front. Biosci. 2004; 9: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 5Wan M. Cao X. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence indicates that BMPs play an important role in the regulation of stem cell properties (3Kishigami S. Mishina Y. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 6Chambers I. Smith A.

Signals from BMP ligands are transduced through binding to type I and II receptors on the cell surface, where type II receptors activate type I receptors, which in turn phosphorylate the downstream Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8. The phospho-R-Smads (P-Smads) form a complex with Smad4 and translocate into the nucleus, where they bind to the Smad binding sites and cooperate with other transcription factors to regulate BMP-induced gene expression (5Wan M. Cao X. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 9Feng X.H. Derynck R. Ann. Rev. Cell Dev.

Despite substantial effort devoted to understanding the actions of BMP/TGF-β and Smads, the precise regulation of Smads remains enigmatic. Regulation of Smads can be accomplished via various post-translational mechanisms, including phosphorylation and ubiquitin-dependent modifications (11Feng X.H. Lin X. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.H. Smad Signal Transduction. Springer, The Netherlands2006: 253-276Google Scholar, 12Izzi L. Attisano L. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2071-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Among these, BMP-induced phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8, which is carried out by the BMP type I receptor (BMPRIA or BMPRIB) and occurs at the C-terminal SXS motif of Smad1/5/8, represents the most critical step in Smad signaling. The SXS phosphorylation triggers a cascade of intracellular events from Smad complex assembly in the cytoplasm to transcriptional control in the nucleus. The reversible phosphorylation and dephosphorylation represents a fundamental strategy used by eukaryotic organisms to regulate a battery of biological functions. The cellular protein phosphorylation state is modulated by protein kinases and phosphatases. Until recently, how Smad functions are fine-tuned by Smad dephosphorylation remains poorly understood. R-Smads undergo continuous nucleocytoplasmic shutting, and their export from the nucleus requires dephosphorylation (13Inman G.J. Nicolas F.J. Hill C.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 283-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 14Xu L. Kang Y. Col S. Massague J. Mol.

A recent work identifies pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDP) as a Smad phosphatase in the decapentaplegic pathway in Drosophila (15Chen H.B. Shen J. Ip Y.T. Xu L. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 648-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). On the other hand, we have found that PPM1A (but not PDPs) acts as a phosphatase for TGF-β-activated Smad2 and Smad3 (16Lin X. Duan X. Liang Y.Y. Su Y. Wrighton K. Long J. Hu M. Davis C. Wang J. Brunicardi F.C. Shi Y. Chen Y.G. Meng A. Feng X.H.

We have demonstrated that PPM1A physically interacts with and dephosphorylates Smad1. Furthermore, overexpression of PPM1A attenuates or abolishes BMP-induced transcription, and conversely RNA interference-mediated knockdown of PPM1A enhances BMP signaling. Thus, PPM1A-mediated dephosphorylation provides a novel mechanism in terminating BMP signaling. Plasmids—Expression plasmids for epitope-tagged Smads have been previously described (17Lin X. Liang M.

Anti-HA or anti-FLAG antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate Smad1 from transfected cell lysates.

Each target was measured in triplicates. Data were analyzed using Excel. Reporter Assays—HepG2 cells at 25–30% confluency were co-transfected with expression plasmids for PPM1A (indicated in the text) and reporter plasmids. Cells were transfected with reporter plasmids (e.g. GCCG-lux, Id1-luc, Xvent-luc, or FR-luc) and expression plasmids for PPM1A and then treated for 12 h with or without 25 ng/ml BMP2. BMP2-induced transcription was analyzed by measuring luciferase activity using a Luciferase Assay kit (Promega). PPM1A Dephosphorylates Smad1—In a search to study Smad2/3 dephosphorylation in the phospho-SXS motif, we recently identified PPM1A as the phosphatase for Smad2 and Smad3 that is responsible for termination of TGF-β signals (Lin et al., (16Lin X.

Considering the highly conserved nature of the SXS motif in all R-Smads, we reasoned that PPM1A might also recognize the SXS motif in the BMP-activated Smad1. To test this, BMP-induced Smad1 phosphorylation was analyzed in HeLa cells that were transfected with HA-Smad1 and His-PPM1A. The phosphorylation level of Smad1 (P-Smad1) was determined by a phospho-SXS motif-specific antibody. In the absence of PPM1A, the level of P-Smad1 increased upon 1 h of BMP2 stimulation (Fig. 1A, lane 2). In contrast, co-transfection of His-PPM1A abolished BMP-induced Smad1 phosphorylation (Fig. 1A, lane 3), suggesting that PPM1A either prevents Smad1 phosphorylation or directly dephosphorylates Smad1. To rule out the possibility that PPM1A dephosphorylates BMP receptors to prevent Smad1 phosphorylation and activation, we used a mutant of BMP receptor ALK3(Q233D) that constitutively activates Smad1. Clearly, P-Smad1 level was increased by ALK3(Q233D) (Fig. 1A, lane 5), and this increase was abolished by the co-expression of PPM1A (Fig. 1A, lane 6). Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 are three R-Smads transducing BMP signals in vertebrates. After having established that PPM1A dephosphorylates Smad1, we then carried out an experiment to test whether PPM1A also dephosphorylates Smad5 and Smad8. The results of analysis showed that PPM1A dephosphorylated P-Smad5 (Fig. 1B) and P-Smad8 (Fig. 1C), which were recognized by the same P-Smad1 antibody (αPS1). We next determined whether the phosphatase activity of PPM1A is essential in reducing Smad1 phosphorylation. PPM1A point mutants at its catalytic domain (D239N and R174G) were generated (23Jackson M.D. Fjeld C.C. Denu J.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8513-8521Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1D, both D239N and R174G mutants were unable to eliminate ALK3(Q233D)-induced P-Smad1. In addition, three N-terminal deletion mutants (Met-29, Met-36, and Met-112) of PPM1A were tested for their Smad1-dephosphorylating activity in 293T cells. We found that all three deletion mutants lost their activity toward Smad1 dephosphorylation (Fig. 1E). These results suggest that PPM1A reduces the P-Smad1 level through its phosphatase activity. To further determine whether the effect of PPM1A on P-Smad1 accumulation is due to direct dephosphorylation of P-Smad1, an in vitro phosphatase assay was performed using purified PPM1A and P-Smad1 (Fig. 1F). P-Smad1 and PPM1A (wild type or mutants) were separately purified by immunoprecipitation from 293T cells, which were transfected with either F-Smad1 or His-PPM1A. Results in Fig. 1F showed clearly that the P-Smad1 level was reduced by wild-type PPM1A but not by either the D239N or R174G mutant, suggesting PPM1A directly dephosphorylates Smad1. To exclude the possibility that PPM1A causes reduction in Smad1 phosphorylation dependent on the 26 S proteasome, the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 was included. Inhibition of the 26 S proteasome by MG-132 did not reverse the effect of PPM1A on the P-Smad1 level (Fig. 1G). This suggests that proteasome-dependent degradation does not contribute to PPM1A-induced loss of Smad1 phosphorylation. Finally, we examined the effect of PPM1A on the dephosphorylation of endogenous Smad1. Mv1Lu cell lines that stably express PPM1A under the control of the tet-off promoter were established. Withdrawal of doxycycline (–Dox), a tetracycline derivative, induced PPM1A expression (Fig. 1H, lanes 3 and 4). As a control, BMP2 treatment (1 h) resulted in a strong increase in the endogenous P-Smad1 level (lane 2). However, BMP2-induced Smad1 phosphorylation was eliminated when PPM1A expression was induced (–Dox) (Fig. 1H, lane 4). PPM1A Physically Interacts with Smad1—To determine whether PPM1A interacts with Smad1, we carried out a coimmunoprecipitation experiment. FLAG-PPM1A was co-transfected with HA-Smad1 in 293T cells. Results from coimmunoprecipitation showed that PPM1A could interact with Smad1 (Fig. 2A, lane 3). To determine whether there is a direct interaction between PPM1A and Smad1, an in vitro GST binding assay was performed. In vitro translated, 35S-labeled wild type (WT), D239N, or R174G mutant of PPM1A was incubated with purified GST or GST-Smad1 fusion protein immobilized to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Wild-type PPM1A and its mutants clearly interacted with GST-Smad1 fusion protein but not with GST protein alone (Fig. 2B). This result indicates a direct interaction between PPM1A and Smad1 protein. To map the PPM1A binding domain on Smad1, recombinant GST fusions of the Smad1 N terminus, linker region, and C terminus were tested for their binding to in vitro translated, 35S-labeled His-PPM1A. Interestingly, PPM1A interacts with both the N and C termini of Smad1; no interaction was found on the linker region (Fig. 2C). Ectopic Expression of PPM1A Attenuates BMP Signaling—Upon BMP ligand binding, Smad1 is phosphorylated by the type I receptor and then forms a complex with Smad4, which translocates into the nucleus, where they exert their transcriptional regulation. After having determined that PPM1A dephosphorylates Smad1, we sought to investigate whether PPM1A affects accumulation of the Smad complex. Presence of the complex between FLAG-Smad1 and Myc-Smad4 was examined in 293T cells co-transfected with either WT or the D239N mutant of PPM1A. As a control, BMP2 induced an interaction between Smad1 and Smad4 (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 1 and 2). This interaction was significantly reduced in the presence of wild-type PPM1A (Fig. 3A, lane 3), whereas PPM1A D239N mutant had no effect on the Smad1-Smad4 interaction (Fig. 3A, lane 4), suggesting PPM1A antagonizes accumulation of the Smad1-Smad4 complex. In the light of its nuclear localization of PPM1A (data not shown), PPM1A may cause dissociation of the nuclear Smad1-Smad4 complex. Because PPM1A dephosphorylates Smad1, we reasoned that PPM1A might inhibit the transactivation activity of Smad1. Using a Gal4 reporter system, where Smad1 was fused with the Gal4 DNA binding domain (Gal4-Smad1), we assessed the transcriptional activity of Smad1 on FR-luc, a heterologous Gal4 binding reporter gene. As expected, transcriptional activity of Smad1, as reflected by FR-Luc luciferase activity, was induced by BMP2 treatment (Fig. 3B). Co-transfection of wild-type PPM1A (but not R174G mutant) abolished BMP2-induced transcriptional activity of Smad1. We next determined the effect of PPM1A on BMP-regulated Smad-dependent gene transcription. To this end, we used a synthetic reporter construct GCCG-lux, which contains multiple repeats of the GCCG motif and specifically responds to BMP stimulation but not to TGF-β or activin (19Kusanagi K. Inoue H. Ishidou Y. Mishima H.K. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3C, BMP2 treatment caused an increased GCCG-lux reporter activity in HepG2 cells. In contrast, the presence of PPM1A completely blocked BMP2-dependent expression of GCCG-lux. Several BMP early target genes have been reported. Among them, Id-1 encodes a protein that acts as a positive regulator of cell proliferation and a negative regulator of cell differentiation (24Miyazono K. Miyazawa K. Science's STKE. 2002; : E40Google Scholar). Xvent1 is another BMP direct target gene, which is a member of the vox/vent homeobox gene family and is involved in dorsoventral axis determination (25Gilardelli C.N. Pozzoli O. Sordino P. Matassi G. Cotelli F. Dev. Dyn. 2004; 230: 494-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We studied the effect of PPM1A on the transcriptional activity of these target genes. As shown in Fig. 3D, BMP2 treatment caused an increased promoter activity of Id-1 in HepG2 cells. Co-expression of PPM1A completely eliminated this induction. Moreover, PPM1A D239N and R174G mutants did not affect Id1 promoter activity. Similarly, expression of PPM1A profoundly inhibited the transcription of Xvent-luc reporter gene (Fig. 3E). Knockdown of PPM1A Enhances BMP Signaling—Having established the inhibitory effect of PPM1A overexpression on BMP-induced Smad1 phosphorylation and Smad1-dependent transcriptional responses, we took a loss-of-function approach to knock down PPM1A expression by RNA interference. Expression of small interfering RNA against human PPM1A (shPPM1A494) could efficiently knock down the exogenous expression of human PPM1A but not zebrafish PPM1A (Fig. 4A). As a result, shPPM1A blocked Smad1 dephosphorylation induced by hPPM1A (lane 3). The effect of PPM1A knockdown could be rescued by the expression of zPPM1A (lane 5). zPPM1A, which was resistant to shPPM1A-mediated knockdown, led to Smad1 dephosphorylation in the presence of shPPM1A494 (lane 6). We also assessed the effect of PPM1A knockdown on BMP2-induced promoter activity. When the shPPM1A plasmid was transfected in HepG2 cells, Id1 promoter activity was markedly increased compared with control cells (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, expression of zPPM1A abolished the increased induction of Id promoter activity by shPPM1A (Fig. 4B). We also noticed that HepG2 cells exhibited a weak p21 response to BMP2. Notably, shPPM1A could sensitize the cells to respond to BMP2, and conversely, zPPM1A completely shuts off BMP2-induced p21 response (Fig. 4C). We have stably knocked down PPM1A expression in HaCaT cells (Fig. 4D). In PPM1A-depleted HaCaT-stable cells, called shPPM1A-stable cells, the level of P-Smad1 induced by BMP2 was profoundly higher than that in control cells (Fig. 4D, lanes 2 and 4). To characterize the effect of PPM1A knockdown on BMP transcriptional responses, we examined the levels of p21 and Id1 mRNAs in HaCaT stable cells. p21 and Id1 are two representative Smad-dependent BMP target genes (20ten Korchynskyi O. Dijke P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4883-4891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 26Pardali K. Kowanetz M. Heldin C.H. Moustakas A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2005; 204: 260-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In control cells, BMP2 induced a gradual increase in the p21 mRNA level over a period of 24 h, at which time it reached 2.5-fold higher than the basal level. Notably, knockdown of PPM1A in shPPM1A cells rendered cells more sensitive to BMP2, which induced a higher level of p21 mRNA (Fig. 4E). Similar results were obtained on BMP2-induced Id1 mRNA as higher and better induction of Id1 mRNA was observed in shPPM1A cells (Fig. 4F). Taken together, these results suggest that knockdown of PPM1A enhances Smad-dependent transcription responses. It is generally accepted that phosphorylation in the SXS motif of R-Smads is the most critical intracellular event in the BMP/TGF-β signal transduction pathways. Conversely, dephosphorylation of the SXS motif should provide a counter-mechanism terminating or antagonizing the functions of activated Smads. This study describes the identification and characterization of PPM1A as a phosphatase for BMP-activated Smad1. Our initial study on PPM1A-mediated dephosphorylation of Smad2/3 (16Lin X. Duan X. Liang Y.Y. Su Y. Wrighton K. Long J. Hu M. Davis C. Wang J. Brunicardi F.C. Shi Y. Chen Y.G. Meng A. Feng X.H. Cell. 2006; 125: 915-928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) led us to investigate whether PPM1A also acts as a Smad1 phosphatase. Considering the highly conserved sequences upstream of the distal SXS motif among all R-Smads, it is not surprising that all R-Smads are dephosphorylated by the same phosphatase. PPM1A physically interacts with Smad1 in both co-immunoprecipitation and GST pulldown assays. PPM1A dephosphorylates Smad1 in a number of cell lines tested, including 293T, HepG2, HaCaT, Mv1Lu, and C2C12 cells. Because of its activity toward the dephosphorylation of Smad1, overexpression of PPM1A inhibits BMP-induced transcriptional responses, whereas knockdown of its expression promotes BMP responses. In addition to our finding that Smad1 is dephosphorylated by PPM1A, we have found that PPM1A effectively dephosphorylates the phospho-SXS motif in Smad5 and Smad8. Our finding that PPM1A is a phosphatase for R-Smads does not preclude the existence of other Smad phosphatases. We expect there is redundancy on Smad dephosphorylation. Recently, Chen et al. (15Chen H.B. Shen J. Ip Y.T. Xu L. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 648-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) has reported that PDP is a Mad phosphatase in Drosophila (15Chen H.B. Shen J. Ip Y.T. Xu L. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 648-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mammalian PDPs (e.g. PDP1/PPM2C and PDP2) have no effect on Smad2 dephosphorylation (15Chen H.B. Shen J. Ip Y.T. Xu L. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 648-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 16Lin X. Duan X. Liang Y.Y. Su Y. Wrighton K. Long J. Hu M. Davis C. Wang J. Brunicardi F.C. Shi Y. Chen Y.G. Meng A. Feng X.H. Cell. 2006; 125: 915-928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), whereas PPM1A dephosphorylates all R-Smads (Ref. 16Lin X. Duan X. Liang Y.Y. Su Y.

Unexpectedly, we failed to observe any effects of PDP1 or PDP2 overexpression on dephosphorylation of P-Smad1 (supplemental Fig. S2). Although our manuscript is in revision, Knockaert et al. (27Knockaert M. Sapkota G. Alarcon C. Massague J. Brivanlou A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 11940-11945Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) report dephosphorylation of Smad1 by small C-terminal domain phosphatases (SCPs) (27Knockaert M. Sapkota G. Alarcon C. Massague J. Brivanlou A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 11940-11945Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Similar to the PDPs, overexpression of SCP1–3 has no effect on Smad1 dephosphorylation in mammalian cells, 4X. Duan, Y.-Y. Liang, X.-H. Feng, and X. Lin, unpublished data. although SCP1–3 clearly dephosphorylates the linker region of Smad2/3 (28Wrighton, K., Willis, D., Long, J., Liu, F., Lin, X., and Feng, X.H. (October 10, 2006) J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc.M607246200Google Scholar). These discrepancies may be explained by the possibility that PDPs and/or SCPs may require additional cofactors or downstream effectors (which is limiting in mammalian cells) to have their full phosphatase activity toward dephosphorylation of the phospho-SXS motif of Smad1. Thus, in the absence of increased expression of these cofactors, increased expression of PDPs or SCPs does not suffice to achieve their effects. Further experiments are needed to clarify these issues, to identify new Smad phosphatases, and to characterize how these phosphatases specifically impact Smad-dependent responses. Identification of PPM1A as a Smad1 phosphatase will aid in the understanding of the mechanisms underlying shut-off of BMP signaling. We anticipate that PPM1A might be involved in the regulation of many developmental processes such as skeletal and cardiovascular development as well as human diseases, partly through its role as a Smad phosphatase.

https://openalex.org/W1966094320,"Cisplatin is one of the most common DNA-damaging agents used for treating patients with solid tumors such as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Unfortunately, significant levels of resistance in SCC cells emerge rapidly following cisplatin treatment. Here we report that the proteasome inhibitor PS-341, the representative of a new class of chemotherapeutic drugs, was capable of inducing apoptosis in cisplatin-resistant SCC cells via the endoplasmic reticulum stress. PS-341 stimulated the phosphorylation of PERK and the unfolded protein response, resulting in the induction of the transcription factor ATF-4. Importantly, the Bcl-2 homology domain 3-only (BH3-only) protein Noxa was found to be strongly induced in cisplatin-resistant SCC cells by PS-341 but not by cisplatin. The knock-down of Noxa using small interference RNA significantly abolished PS-341-mediated apoptosis in SCC cells. Using eIF2α mutant mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we found that functional eIF2α played an essential role in PS-341-induced Noxa expression. Taken together, our novel findings reveal a direct link between PS-341-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress and the mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway and suggest that PS-341 may be utilized for overcoming cisplatin-resistance in human SCC."
https://openalex.org/W2028187888,"Abstract l-Asparaginase is important in the induction regimen for treating acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Cytotoxic complications are clinically significant problems lacking mechanistic insight. To reveal tissue-specific molecular responses to this drug, mice were administered asparaginase from either Escherichia coli (clinically used) or Wolinella succinogenes (novel, glutaminase-free form). Both enzymes abolished serum asparagine, but only the E. coli form reduced circulating glutamine. E. coli asparaginase reduced protein synthesis in liver and spleen but not pancreas via increased phosphorylation of the translation factor eIF2. In contrast, treatment with Wolinella caused no untoward changes in protein synthesis in any tissue examined. Treating mice deleted for the eIF2 kinase, GCN2, with the E. coli enzyme showed eIF2 phosphorylation to be GCN2-dependent, but only initially. Furthermore, although eIF2 phosphorylation was not increased in the pancreas or by Wolinella asparaginase, expression of the amino acid stress response genes, asparagine synthetase and CHOP/GADD153, increased as a result of both enzymes, even in tissues demonstrating no change in eIF2 phosphorylation. Finally, signaling downstream of the mammalian target of rapamycin kinase was repressed in liver and pancreas by E. coli but not Wolinella asparaginase. These data demonstrate that the nutrient stress response to asparaginase is tissue-specific and exacerbated by glutamine depletion. Importantly, increased expression of asparagine synthetase and CHOP does not require eIF2 phosphorylation, signifying alternate or auxiliary means of inducing gene expression under conditions of amino acid depletion in the whole animal."
https://openalex.org/W1991979219,"In this work, we determine that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ccr4-Not complex controls ubiquitination of the conserved ribosome-associated heterodimeric EGD (enhancer of Gal4p DNA binding) complex, which consists of the Egd1p and Egd2p subunits in yeast and is named NAC (nascent polypeptide-associated complex) in mammals. We show that the EGD complex subunits are ubiquitinated proteins, whose ubiquitination status is regulated during cell growth. Egd2p has a UBA domain that is not essential for interaction with Egd1p but is required for stability of Egd2p and Egd1p. Ubiquitination of Egd1p requires Not4p. Ubiquitination of Egd2p also requires Not4p, an intact Not4p RING finger domain, and all other subunits of the Ccr4-Not complex tested. In the absence of Not4p, Egd2p mislocalizes to punctuate structures. Finally, the EGD complex can be ubiquitinated in vitro by Not4p and Ubc4p, one of the E2 enzymes with which Not4p can interact. Taken together our results reveal that the EGD ribosome-associated complex is ubiquitinated in a regulated manner, and they show a new role for the Ccr4-Not complex in this ubiquitination."
https://openalex.org/W1991456063,"In response to elevated temperatures, cells from many organisms rapidly transcribe a number of mRNAs. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, this protective response involves two regulatory systems: the heat shock transcription factor (Hsf1) and the Msn2 and Msn4 (Msn2/4) transcription factors. Both systems modulate the induction of specific heat shock genes. However, the contribution of Hsf1, independent of Msn2/4, is only beginning to emerge. To address this question, we constructed an msn2/4 double mutant and used microarrays to elucidate the genome-wide expression program of Hsf1. The data showed that 7.6% of the genome was heat-induced. The up-regulated genes belong to a wide range of functional categories, with a significant increase in the chaperone and metabolism genes. We then focused on the contribution of the activation domains of Hsf1 to the expression profile and extended our analysis to include msn2/4Δ strains deleted for the N-terminal or C-terminal activation domain of Hsf1. Cluster analysis of the heat-induced genes revealed activation domain-specific patterns of expression, with each cluster also showing distinct preferences for functional categories. Computational analysis of the promoters of the induced genes affected by the loss of an activation domain showed a distinct preference for positioning and topology of the Hsf1 binding site. This study provides insight into the important role that both activation domains play for the Hsf1 regulatory system to rapidly and effectively transcribe its regulon in response to heat shock.

This study provides insight into the important role that both activation domains play for the Hsf1 regulatory system to rapidly and effectively transcribe its regulon in response to heat shock. The ability to respond to a large number of environmental stresses is crucial for the survival of all organisms (1Morimoto R.I. Kline M.P. Bimston D.N. Cotto J.J. Essays Biochem. 1997; 32: 17-29PubMed Google Scholar). Heat shock is among a highly diverse group of environmental conditions that alter gene expression in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. The response to heat shock is characterized by a rapid induction of a conserved group of heat shock proteins (HSPs). 2The abbreviations used are: HSP, heat shock protein; Hsf1, heat shock transcription factor; Msn2/4, Msn2 and Msn4 transcription factor; HSE, heat shock element; NAD, N-terminal activation domain; CAD, C-terminal activation domain; STRE, stress response element; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; ORF, open reading frame; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; SGD, Saccharomyces Genome Database; QT, quality threshold; TAF, TATA-binding protein-associated factor.

Yeast Hsf1 is an essential protein that binds to inverted repeats of nGAAn called heat shock elements (HSEs) within the promoters of many HSPs and activates their transcription. Hsf1 is composed of several well defined domains that are important for its function. They include the highly conserved central core, which is made up of the winged-helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain (6Harrison C.J. Bohm A.A. Nelson H.C.M. Science. 1994; 263: 224-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 7Littlefield O. Nelson H.C.M. Nat. Struct.

In addition, yeast Hsf1 has two trans-activation domains, one at the N terminus and the other at the C terminus (11Nieto-Sotelo J. Wiederrecht G. Okuda A. Parker C.S. Cell. 1990; 62: 807-817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 12Sorger P.K. Cell. 1990; 62: 793-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Although the structure and function of HSF is generally conserved from various organisms, there is variability in the number and importance of HSF genes in any particular organism. The yeasts, S. cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, have one HSF gene that is essential for cell survival (2Sorger P.K. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 855-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 13Gallo G.J. Prentice H. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1988; 54: 841-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), whereas Drosophila melanogaster has a single HSF gene that is essential for oogenesis, early larval development, and survival in response to acute stress but is unnecessary for cell growth and viability (15Jedlicka P. Mortin M.A. Wu C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2452-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In contrast, chickens and mammals have 3 HSF genes that vary in their cellular and physiological roles (16Pirkkala L. Nykanen P. Sistonen L. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1118-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar), whereas Arabidopsis thaliana has 21 HSF genes that are tightly regulated into a network of interacting proteins (17Baniwal S.K. Bharti K. Chan K.Y. Fauth M. Ganguli A. Kotak S. Mishra S.K. Nover L. Port M. Scharf K.D. Tripp J. Weber C. Zielinski D. von Koskull-Doring P. J. Biosci. 2004; 29: 471-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The existence of multiple HSF species in higher eukaryotes suggests that HSF isoforms may have specific functions that are triggered by distinct stimuli or activate specific target genes. So how does S. cerevisiae, with one Hsf1 isoform, regulate such a complex response to environmental stress? Yeast Hsf1 differs from metazoan HSFs in several important ways (16Pirkkala L. Nykanen P. Sistonen L. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1118-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). First, S. cerevisiae utilizes the single essential Hsf1 to activate the expression of a wide variety of genes under normal physiological conditions and in response to environmental stress. Metazoan cells have three heat shock factors that only function under specific developmental or environmental conditions. Second, in the absence of heat shock, S. cerevisiae Hsf1 exists in the nucleus as a trimer bound to HSEs. In contrast, mammalian HSF1 exists in the cytoplasm as an inactive monomer. In response to heat shock, mammalian HSF undergoes nuclear localization, trimerizes, and binds to HSEs. Third, S. cerevisiae Hsf1 has two trans-activation domains, whereas the metazoan HSF has only one located at the C terminus. The activation domains of the S. cerevisiae Hsf1 appear to mediate different temporal aspects of the heat shock response, which can be divided into two phases: the transient response and the sustained response (11Nieto-Sotelo J. Wiederrecht G. Okuda A. Parker C.S. Cell. 1990; 62: 807-817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 12Sorger P.K. Cell. 1990; 62: 793-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 18Young M.R. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5637-5646Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The transient response is characterized as how cells tolerate an increase in temperature over 35 °C for <1 h, whereas the sustained response is characterized as how cells acclimate to the higher temperatures for long periods of time. The N-terminal activation domain (NAD), found in the first 65 amino acids, is thought to mediate the transient response, whereas the C-terminal activation domain (CAD), found between residues 595 and 783, is thought to be responsible for the sustained response to stress. Although there have been no detailed studies of the genes effected by the NAD, the effect of the CAD has been studied for specific genes. The CAD is critical for the heat-induced expression of CUP1, HSP82, and HSP26, whereas the loss of the CAD has no effect on the heat-induced expression of SSA1, SSA3, and HSP104 (19Amoros M.

These proteins are non-essential transcription factors that bind to stress response elements (STREs) found in the promoters of most HSPs (22Estruch F. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 24: 469-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Msn2 and Msn4 are 41% identical in amino acid sequence and 100% conserved at three residues that are pertinent for DNA sequence recognition (23Martinez-Pastor M.T. Marchler G. Schuller C. Marchler-Bauer A. Ruis H. Estruch F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2227-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). Under constitutive conditions, Msn2/4 proteins are localized to the cytoplasm; however, during heat shock, they are transported to the nucleus where they activate transcription of HSPs (24Gorner W. Durchschlag E. Martinez-Pastor M.T. Estruch F. Ammerer G. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Schuller C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 586-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). The contributions of Msn2/4 and Hsf1 proteins to the yeast heat shock response have been addressed previously (25Boy-Marcotte E. Lagniel G. Perrot M. Bussereau F. Boudsocq A. Jacquet M. Labarre J.

These studies, although not exhaustive, establish that each regulatory system contributes differently to the expression of genes. For some genes, such as HSP26 and HSP104, their expression is regulated by cooperation between both Msn2/4 and Hsf1 (19Amoros M. Estruch F. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1523-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 29Grably M.R. Stanhill A. Tell O. Engelberg D. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 21-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), whereas other genes appear to be regulated by only one system. The Msn2/4 regulatory system controls the expression of genes classified as chaperones, carbon metabolism, and oxidative stress (25Boy-Marcotte E. Lagniel G. Perrot M. Bussereau F. Boudsocq A. Jacquet M. Labarre J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 274-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 28Treger J.M. Schmitt A.P. Simon J.R. McEntee K. J. Biol.

In this study, we used DNA microarrays to quantify the contribution that the Hsf1 regulatory system makes to the transient heat shock response in the absence of the Msn2/4 transcription factors. In particular, we focused on the roles of the activation domains of Hsf1 by analyzing the expression patterns of strains with NAD or CAD deletions. We applied clustering algorithms to our data to illuminate physiological and mechanical relationships among genes. Promoter analysis showed architectural distinctions between the different clustered genes. These data show that Hsf1, its activation domains, and HSEs all play distinctive roles in the reorganizing and orchestrating of cellular events during the heat shock response. Yeast Strains and Growth Conditions—All strains were constructed in our laboratory and derived from the S. cerevisiae strain W303-1A (MATa ade2-1 trp-1 can-1 leu2, 3-112 his-11, 15 ura3-1). We used the KanMX cassette in combination with cre-loxP recombination technology to create the msn2::loxP msn4::loxP null alleles (31Ferguson S.B. Anderson E.S. Harshaw R.B. Thate T. Craig N.L. Nelson H.C. Genetics. 2005; 169: 1203-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Creation of the activation domain deletion strains has been previously described (32Ferguson S.B. Negative Regulation of the Heat Shock Transcription Factor by Protein Kinase A in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Ph.D. dissertation, Cell and Molecular Biology. University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA2005Google Scholar). Briefly, URA3-marked integration plasmids that contained Hsf1 genes deleted for either the N- or C-terminal activation domains were constructed. These plasmids were used to replace the wild-type HSF1 allele with either the hsf1(66-833) or hsf1(1-583) alleles in both MSN2/4 and msn2/4Δ strains. Strains with the wild-type HSF1 were designated HSF, strains with hsf1(66-833) allele were designated HSFΔNAD, and strains with the hsf1(1-583) allele were designated HSFΔCAD. Cells were grown in yeast extract-peptone-dextrose medium supplemented with adenine (YPAD) at 30 °C to mid-log phase (A600 of 0.5). RNA Preparation and Northern Blot Analysis—The culture was split into two, with one half remaining at standard growing conditions, while the other half was heat shocked at 37 °C for 15 min. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 258 × g at 4 °C for 5 min, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Total RNA was isolated using the hot acidic phenol method (33Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, Inc., and John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2004: 13-12.1-13-12.5Google Scholar). Pellets were resuspended in RNase-free dH2O, quantified, and store at -80 °C until needed. RNA samples (7 μg/lane) were incubated in a 1:1 ratio of loading buffer (54% formamide, 19% formaldehyde, 40 mm MOPS, pH 7, 10 mm sodium acetate, 4.2% glycerol, 0.03% xylene cyanol, 0.03% bromphenol blue, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8) at 65 °C for 10 min. The RNA samples were resolved on formaldehyde-agarose gels and then transferred onto ZetaProbe Nylon membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was cross-linked in the UV Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene) and washed in 0.1× SSC at room temperature. The membrane was pre-hybridized in RapidHyb buffer (Amersham Biosciences) at 55 °C for a minimum of 2 h. Probes were generated by incorporating Biotin-16-dUP nucleotide (Roche Applied Science) into PCR products of the HSP12, HSP26, HSP82, HSP104, SSA3, SSA4, and SSE2 open reading frames (ORFs). Hybridization was carried out with denatured probes in the same buffer at 55 °C overnight. The following day, the filters were washed three times in 300 mm NaCl; 30 mm sodium citrate, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C for 20 min. The protocol from the North2South Chemiluminescent Detection Kit (Pierce) was used for probe detection and substrate development. Signals were then quantified on a Fluorchem 8800 cooled charge-coupled device detection system (Alpha Innotech Corp.). Microarray Hybridization—The Affymetrix yeast genome YG_S98 microarrays used in this study contain ∼6400 known or predicted open reading frames as described in the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) and additional probe sets representing putative ORFs identified by SAGE analysis, mitochondrial proteins, and TY proteins (Affymetrix). All protocols were conducted as described in the Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual. Briefly, 10 μg of total RNA was incubated with Superscript II reverse transcriptase primed by a poly(T) oligomer that incorporated the T7 promoter to convert the RNA into first-strand cDNA. Second-strand cDNA synthesis was followed by in vitro transcription for linear amplification of each transcript and incorporation of biotinylated CTP and UTP. The cRNA products were fragmented to an average of 200 nucleotides, heated at 99 °C for 5 min, and hybridized for 16 h at 45 °C to the Affymetrix microarrays at the University of Pennsylvania Microarray Core Facility. The microarrays were then washed at low (0.9 m NaCl, 60 mm Na H2PO4, pH7.5, 6 mm EDTA, 0.005% Triton X-100) and high (100 mm MES, 0.1 m NaCl) stringency and stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin. Fluorescence was amplified by adding biotinylated anti-streptavidin and an additional aliquot of streptavidin-phycoerythrin stain. A confocal scanner was used to collect fluorescence signal at 3-μm resolution after excitation at 570 nm. The average signal from two sequential scans was calculated for each microarray feature. Gene expression values were calculated using Affymetrix Microarray Suite, version 5.0, and exported as “chp” files. The data were imported and analyzed using GeneSpring GX version 7.2 (Agilent Technologies). The chp files were pre-normalized (centered on a trimmed mean of 150). In GeneSpring, the values were further normalized “per chip” by dividing each intensity value by the median intensity of the entire chip, and then “per gene” by dividing the signal levels of a given gene across all 18 samples by the median signal across the same samples for that gene. Data Acquisition and Analysis—First, an experiment was set up to group the three independent replicates of each condition and strain together. This generated an average signal log ratio value, which reflects the abundance of each Affymetrix probe set. At the end of this summarization process, there were six normalized values for each replicate group, one for each strain and condition tested. Then, a pair-wise comparative analysis was performed between the experimental heat shock and the baseline constitutive microarrays for each of the three strains. The probe sets were designated present or induced if they were enriched by a minimum of 2-fold (normalized fold change (NFC) = 2.0). The loci that pass the filter were saved as a gene list. In parallel with the above analysis, normalized signal values for all probe sets were statistically analyzed to identify probe sets that changed in each of the strains in response to heat shock. We applied Significance Analysis of Microarrays, version 2.2 (SAM) (34Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9801) Google Scholar) to the experimental heat shock and the baseline constitutive microarrays for each of three strains in two-sample unpaired mode, with no fold-change cutoff. The stringency for calling loci significant was set at a moderate threshold (Δ) of 0.6. This analysis generated a differentially expressed probe set list for each of the three comparisons. The false discovery rates for the lists were 3.6% for strain HSF, 4.2% for strain HSFΔNAD, and 3.9% for strain HSFΔCAD. We then imported the gene lists of statistically significant probe sets identified by SAM into GeneSpring and compared it to the gene list with >2-fold change generated by the GeneSpring software. The overlapping probe sets that met both qualifications, Δ= 0.6 and normalized fold change (NFC) = 2.0, were used for further analysis. Quality threshold (QT) clustering was performed to uncover patterns of gene expression and the relationships between these patterns (35Heyer L.J. Kruglyak S. Yooseph S. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 1106-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). The algorithm builds a cluster by starting with a single locus and a cluster diameter of zero. One by one, other loci are added to the cluster and a new cluster diameter is calculated. If a locus cannot be placed into an existing cluster without sacrificing the quality or the diameter threshold, it is placed into a new cluster. As a starting point, we analyzed the loci induced in the HSF strain with the QT clustering algorithm of GeneSpring. When all of the loci had been placed, 18 clusters had been generated. We then manually varied the diameter from 0.3 to 0.7 to reduce the number of clusters and to be able to add more loci to each cluster while maintaining a well matched pattern within the cluster. The end result was a five-cluster pattern. To identify Hsf1 binding sites in the promoter sequences, we analyzed 1000 bp upstream of the start codon of the loci that represented verifiable ORFs. Sequences were retrieved from the SGD (36Ball C.A. Dolinski K. Dwight S.S. Harris M.A. Issel-Tarver L. Kasarskis A. Scafe C.R. Sherlock G. Binkley G. Jin H. Kaloper M. Orr S.D. Schroeder M. Weng S.

We defined three types of HSEs, each having three nGAAn repeats in Perfect (PFT), GAP (GAP), and STEP (STP) arrangements. The perfect HSE (PFT) consists of three contiguous, inverted repeats of the nGAAn sequence, either nGAAnnTTCnnGAAn or nTTCnnGAAnnTTCn. The GAP HSE consists of an nGAAn repeat, followed by any 5 bp and 2 inverted nGAAn repeats (nGAAn-(5-bp)-nGAAnnTTCn) and its complement (nGAAnnTTCn-(5-bp)-nTTCn), as well as the related sequences nTTCn-(5-bp)-nTTCnnGAAn and nTTC-nnGAAn-(5-bp)-nGAAn. The STP HSE has a 5-bp insert between each of the 3 nGAAn repeats, yielding the sequences nGAAn-(5-bp)-nGAAn-(5-bp)-nGAAn and nTTCn-(5-bp)-nTTCn-(5-bp)-nTTCn (30Yamamoto A. Mizukami Y. Sakurai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11911-11919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). As per previous studies (27Hahn J.S. Hu Z. Thiele D.J. Iyer V.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5249-5256Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 30Yamamoto A. Mizukami Y. Sakurai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11911-11919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), we also allowed a single mismatch (nGAR) in one of the three nGAAn repeats for PFT or GAP. Both Activation Domains of Hsf1 Contribute to the Transient Heat Shock Response—Yeast Hsf1 has two activation domains that play distinct temporal roles during the heat shock response (12Sorger P.K. Cell. 1990; 62: 793-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 18Young M.R. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5637-5646Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To compare their relative contributions in the initial response to heat stress, we constructed six isogenic strains, three in an MSN2/4 background and three in an msn2/4Δ background. In both backgrounds, we tested various truncations of Hsf1: HSF, wild-type Hsf1; HSFΔNAD, which eliminated the first 65 residues of Hsf1; and HSFΔCAD, which eliminated the last 250 residues of Hsf1 (Fig. 1). The six strains were subjected to a 15-min heat shock at a moderate (37 °C) temperature. Northern blot analysis was used to measure the constitutive and heat-induced levels of several HSF-controlled mRNAs. In all six strains, the constitutive levels of HSP104, HSP82, and HSP26 mRNAs were low, whereas the heat-induced levels of the same mRNAs increased to varying degrees (Fig. 2). When we compared the heat induction of HSP104 and HSP26 in the MSN2/4 strain versus the msn2/4Δ strain, there was only a slight increase, whereas HSP82 was significantly reduced in the same background comparison. When we analyzed the contribution of the NAD or the CAD in MSN2/4 strains, the results were similar to those obtained in the HSF strain. The effects of the deleted activation domains were masked and/or compensated for by the Msn2/4 regulatory system.FIGURE 2Removal of a single activation domain of Hsf1 reveals promoter-specific defects in heat shock induction of HSPs in the absence of msn2/4. A and B, total RNA was isolated from six different strains that were either maintained at constitutive conditions (30 °C) or heat shocked at 37 °C for 15 min. A representative Northern blot is shown for the transcripts HSP104, HSP12, HSP26, and ACT1 (loading control). The bar graph below illustrates heat induction, which was calculated as the -fold change of the normalized transcript between heat shock conditions versus constitutive conditions. The asterisks indicate significant differences between wild-type and the condition tested using Student's t test: **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) On the other hand, in the msn2/4Δ strains, each of the HSPs tested was affected differently by the loss of one of the Hsf1 activation domains (Fig. 2B). In the HSF strain, the heat-induced mRNA levels increased moderately for HSP104 (12-fold) and HSP82 (4-fold) and dramatically for HSP26 (37-fold). In the HSFΔNAD strain, the heat-induced mRNA levels increased moderately for HSP104 (7-fold) and HSP26 (7-fold) and dramatically for HSP82 (34-fold). In the HSFΔCAD strain, the heat-induced mRNA levels increased moderately for HSP104 (5-fold) and HSP82 (6-fold) but had no effect on the levels of HSP26 (0.9-fold). From these experiments we were able to confirm that both regulatory systems cooperate in the expression of many genes. More importantly, we could use the msn2/4 null strains to look specifically at the contribution of the Hsf1 regulatory system. Global Transcript Profiling of mRNAs Shows a Unique Response to Mutations in Hsf1 during Heat Shock—To understand the broader utilization of Hsf1 and its activation domains during the transient heat shock response, we used microarrays to examine genome-wide changes in transcription levels. For each msn2/4Δ strain, we isolated RNA from constitutive and heat-induced conditions in triplicate, resulting in 18 RNA samples. These samples served as templates to generate biotinylated antisense probes for hybridization to Affymetrix yeast genome YG_S98 microarrays. After spot quantitation and normalization, the signal log ratio for each locus on the microarray was determined. We compared the constitutive and heat shock conditions in each strain and identified loci that responded with significant changes in their transcript level. We then imported the list into the SGD to identify the loci that represented known or putative genes. In the HSF strain, 442 genes were heat-induced. The induction of these genes is significantly higher than would be expected if induction was not correlated with heat shock expression (p = 2.1 × 10-21). Of the 442 genes, 63% were increased by 2- to 3-fold, 28% increased by 3- to 6-fold, and 9% increased by more than 6-fold. The highest expression profile was for the HSP70 homolog SSA4, which increased its levels by 137-fold. In the HSFΔNAD strain, 329 genes were heat-induced (p = 4.3 × 10-16). Of the 329 genes, 63% were increased by 2- to 3-fold, 31% increased by 3- to 6-fold, and 6% increased by"
https://openalex.org/W2055945784,"Although several studies have shown that a subset of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signals require the activation of heterotrimeric G proteins, the molecular mechanisms underlying IGF-stimulated G protein signaling remain poorly understood. Here, we have studied the mechanism by which endogenous IGF receptors activate the ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade in HEK293 cells. In these cells, treatment with pertussis toxin and expression of a Gαq/11-(305–359) peptide that inhibits Gq/11 signaling additively inhibited IGF-stimulated ERK1/2 activation, indicating that the signal was almost completely G protein-dependent. Treatment with IGF-1 or IGF-2 promoted translocation of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged sphingosine kinase (SK) 1 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, increased endogenous SK activity within 30 s of stimulation, and caused a statistically significant increase in intracellular and extracellular sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) concentration. Using a GFP-tagged S1P1 receptor as a biological sensor for the generation of physiologically relevant S1P levels, we found that IGF-1 and IGF-2 induced GFP-S1P receptor internalization and that the effect was blocked by pretreatment with the SK inhibitor, dimethylsphingosine. Treating cells with dimethylsphingosine, silencing SK1 expression by RNA interference, and blocking endogenous S1P receptors with the competitive antagonist VPC23019 all significantly inhibited IGF-stimulated ERK1/2 activation, suggesting that IGFs elicit G protein-dependent ERK1/2 activation by stimulating SK1-dependent transactivation of S1P receptors. Given the ubiquity of SK and S1P receptor expression, S1P receptor transactivation may represent a general mechanism for G protein-dependent signaling by non-G protein-coupled receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2029498141,"The identification of ABCA1 as a key transporter responsible for cellular lipid efflux has led to considerable interest in defining its role in cholesterol metabolism and atherosclerosis. In this study, the effect of overexpressing ABCA1 in the liver of LDLr-KO mice was investigated. Compared with LDLr-KO mice, ABCA1-Tg × LDLr-KO (ABCA1-Tg) mice had significantly increased plasma cholesterol levels, mostly because of a 2.8-fold increase in cholesterol associated with a large pool of apoB-lipoproteins. ApoB synthesis was unchanged but the catabolism of 125I-apoB-VLDL and -LDL were significantly delayed, accounting for the 1.35-fold increase in plasma apoB levels in ABCA1-Tg mice. We also found rapid in vivo transfer of free cholesterol from HDL to apoB-lipoproteins in ABCA1-Tg mice, associated with a significant 2.7-fold increase in the LCAT-derived cholesteryl linoleate content found primarily in apoB-lipoproteins. ABCA1-Tg mice had 1.4-fold increased hepatic cholesterol concentrations, leading to a compensatory 71% decrease in de novo hepatic cholesterol synthesis, as well as enhanced biliary cholesterol, and bile acid secretion. CAV-1, CYP2b10, and ABCG1 were significantly induced in ABCA1-overexpressing livers; however, no differences were observed in the hepatic expression of CYP7α1, CYP27α1, or ABCG5/G8 between ABCA1-Tg and control mice. As expected from the pro-atherogenic plasma lipid profile, aortic atherosclerosis was increased 10-fold in ABCA1-Tg mice. In summary, hepatic overexpression of ABCA1 in LDLr-KO mice leads to: 1) expansion of the pro-atherogenic apoB-lipoprotein cholesterol pool size via enhanced transfer of HDL-cholesterol to apoB-lipoproteins and delayed catabolism of cholesterol-enriched apoB-lipoproteins; 2) increased cholesterol concentration in the liver, resulting in up-regulated hepatobiliary sterol secretion; and 3) significantly enhanced aortic atherosclerotic lesions.

Thus, ABCA1-mediated formation of nascent HDL represents a critical initiating step in the atheroprotective mechanism of RCT, followed by HDL maturation via LCAT, which converts cholesterol to the more hydrophobic cholesterol esters (CE) present in the HDL core.Because ABCA1 enhances cellular cholesterol efflux and facilitates RCT, therapeutic up-regulation of ABCA1 gene expression has been anticipated to promote the prevention and regression of atherosclerosis. Unexpectedly, studies in various mouse models have led to divergent results regarding the anti-atherogenic role of ABCA1 expression.

Investig. 2006; 116: 1052-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar).Taken together, these studies revealed that macrophage ABCA1 expression does not contribute to plasma HDL levels but does control the development of atherosclerosis in apoE-KO and LDLr-KO mice, while the role of hepatic ABCA1 expression in the development of atherosclerosis and the regulation of non-HDL lipoprotein formation has not yet been fully established.In the present study, LDLr-KO mice overexpressing human ABCA1 in the liver were used to investigate the effect of hepatic ABCA1 on hepatic cholesterol balance, apoB-Lp metabolism and the development of atherosclerosis. We report that hepatic overexpression of ABCA1 in LDLr-KO mice consuming a chow diet leads to significantly increased hepatic cholesterol levels, resulting in the induction of compensatory sterol secretion and reduced cholesterol synthesis. The plasma lipoprotein profile in ABCA1-transgenic LDLr-KO mice was found to be highly pro-atherogenic with accumulation of cholesterol-enriched apoB-Lps because of delayed apoB-Lp catabolism and rapid transfer of free cholesterol from HDL to apoB-Lps. In accordance with the plasma lipoprotein profile changes, aortic atherosclerosis was significantly increased in ABCA1-Tg mice compared with LDLr-KO mice. These results establish that hepatic up-regulation of ABCA1 in LDLr-KO mice, a mouse model with genetic abnormality in apoB-clearance, is pro-atherogenic and further support the concept that genetic background as well as tissue-specific regulation of ABCA1 are critical factors that modulate the atheroprotective properties of ABCA1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals—Human ABCA1-Tg mice were produced with a construct containing the human ABCA1 cDNA driven by the murine apoE promoter, as previously described (18Vaisman B.L.

Investig. 2001; 108: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). These mice were crossed to homozygosity with C57Bl/6 LDLr-KO mice. Expression of human ABCA1 was determined by dot blot hybridization, as previously described (19Joyce C. Amar M.J.A. Lambert G. Vaisman B.L. Paigen B. Najib-Fruchart J. Hoyt Jr., R.F. Neufeld E.D.

LDLr genotype status was determined by PCR screening, using mouse LDLr-specific PCR primers that generate a 383-bp PCR amplicon (5′-accccaagacgtgctcccaggatga-3′ and 5′-cgcagtgctcctcatctgacttgt-3′), and neo-specific PCR primers that generate a 200-bp amplicon (5′-aggatctcgtcgtgacccatggcga-3′ and 5′-gagcggcgataccgtaaagcacgagg-3′). LDLr-KO and human ABCA1-Tg mice were maintained on a chow diet containing 0.02% cholesterol and 4% fat, or were placed on a Western Diet (TD88137; Harlan Teklad; Madison, WI), containing 0.2% cholesterol and 21.2% fat for either 4, 9, or 12 weeks prior to sacrifice. The mice were housed under protocols approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.Real-time PCR—Total RNA from liver, small intestine, kidney, heart, adrenals, testis, lung, brain, and spleen from age-matched male mice was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and further purified using RNeasy RNA-binding columns with on-column DNase treatment (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Total RNA from peritoneal macrophages was extracted from a pool of macrophages (n = 6 male mice per genotype) after allowing the cells to attach for 3 h on Primaria cell culture dishes (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 4.5 g of glucose/liter and penicillin/streptomycin/l-glutamine (Sigma). Cells were washed, and RNA was isolated with RNeasy RNA-binding columns followed by an on-column DNase treatment (Qiagen).Purified RNA (2 μg) was reverse-transcribed (TaqMan Reverse Transcription Core Reagents, ABI, Foster City, CA), and PCR was performed on the SDS7300 (ABI). Each primer and probe set was tested for linearity in the respective tissues (0.1–100 ng of cDNA) in a total volume of 25 μl (TaqMan PCR Mastermix, ABI). Final PCR was done using 3 and 30 ng of cDNA in duplicates for each sample concentration. Predeveloped TaqMan primer and probe sets were purchased from ABI: mAbca1, Mm00442646_m1; hABCA1, Hs00194045_m1 (ex 30–31), Hs01059118_m1 (ex 3–4), Hs00442663_m1 (ex 49–50); mAbcb4, Mm00435630_m1; mAbcb11, Mm00445168_m1; mAbcg1, Mm01351001_m1; mAbcg5, Mm00446249_m1; mAbcg8, Mm00445970_m1; mCyp7α, Mm00484152_m1; mCav1, Mm00483057_m1 and mCyp2b10, Mm00456591_m1. β-Actin (4352341E, ABI) was used as endogenous control.Western Blot Analysis—Protein analyses of m, hABCA1, mABCG1, mCYP27α1, mLRP, mSR-BI, and mCAV-1 were performed by homogenizing ∼100 mg of snap-frozen liver samples in cell lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 1× protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) as well as 50 μm calpain inhibitor II (Sigma). Macrophage protein was isolated from pools of macrophages of six male mice from each group, after allowing the cells to attach to Primaria cell culture dishes (BD Biosciences) for 3 h in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 4.5g glucose/liter, and penicillin/streptomycin/l-glutamine (Sigma). Cells were washed, and protein was isolated as described above.Protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay (Pierce), and 5–20 μg of protein were separated under reducing conditions on a Novex 3–8% Tris-acetate gel or 4–12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). After transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Invitrogen), blots were incubated with the following antibodies: rabbit anti-mouse LRP (Resarch Diagnostics Inc.), rabbit anti-human/mouse ABCA1 and SR-BI (Novus, Littleton, CO), rabbit anti-human/mouse ABCG1 (E-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rabbit anti-human/mouse caveolin-1 (Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Rabbit anti-human/mouse CYP27α1 was provided by Dr. David Russell, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX and was diluted 1:2000 before use (1 h at room temperature). Corresponding horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies were purchased from Amersham Biosciences and from Santa Cruz Biotechnology for all other primary antibodies. Visualization of chemiluminescence was performed with Western Lightning Reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Anti-Human/mouse β-actin (BioLegend, San Diego, CA) was used to control for equal loading and transfer. If not otherwise indicated, equal amounts of protein were analyzed.

We show here that no such regulation is observed when VMAT1 or VMAT2 are expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. However, when the intracellular compartments of VMAT-expressing CHO cells are preloaded with different monoamines, transport becomes susceptible to G-protein-dependent regulation, with differences between the two transporter isoforms. Epinephrine induces G-protein-mediated inhibition of transmitter uptake in CHOVMAT1 cells but prevents inhibition induced by dopamine in CHOVMAT2 cells. Epinephrine also antagonizes G-protein-mediated inhibition of monoamine uptake by VMAT2 expressing platelets or synaptic vesicles. In CHOVMAT2 cells G-protein-mediated inhibition of monoamine uptake can be induced by 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) 1B receptor agonists, whereas α1 receptor agonists modulate uptake into CHOVMAT1 cells.

The first luminal loop of VMATs may represent a G-protein-coupled receptor that adapts vesicular filling. Communication between neurons in the central nervous system mainly occurs at specialized structures, the synapses. Variations in the input and output at synapses confer to synaptic plasticity, which involves changes at the post- and presynaptic sites, respectively. At the presynaptic site, availability and fusion competence of synaptic vesicles as well as the vesicular transmitter content contribute to the strength of postsynaptic answers.Vesicular monoamine transporters (VMATs) 2The abbreviations used are: VMAT, vesicular monoamine transporter; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; 5HT1B, 5-hydroxytryptamine 1B; SLO, streptolysin O; PBS, phosphate buffered saline; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; GMP-P(NH)P, guanosine 5′-(β;γ-imido) triphosphate. 2The abbreviations used are: VMAT, vesicular monoamine transporter; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; 5HT1B, 5-hydroxytryptamine 1B; SLO, streptolysin O; PBS, phosphate buffered saline; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; GMP-P(NH)P, guanosine 5′-(β;γ-imido) triphosphate. translocate monoamines from the cytosol into the secretory vesicles of monoaminergic neurons, neuroendocrine cells, and platelets. Transport is driven by an electrochemical proton gradient (ΔμH+) across the vesicular membrane, which is generated by a vacuolar H+-ATPase (1Kanner B.I. Schuldiner S. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 22: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). In mammals two closely related isoforms of the monoamine transporter, termed VMAT1 and VMAT2, respectively, were identified (2Liu Y. Peter D. Rhogani A. Schuldiner S. Prive G.G. Eisenberg D.

In contrast to VMAT2, VMAT1 prefers epinephrine over norepinephrine, and the Kd for serotonin uptake is around 1 μm for VMAT1 but below 1 μm for VMAT2. Furthermore, histamine is only transported by VMAT2. The activity of both transporters is irreversibly inhibited by reserpine, whereas tetrabenazine exclusively inhibits VMAT2 (6Peter D. Jiminez J.

These findings indicate that the monoamines stored inside the vesicle control the ability of G-proteins to regulate VMAT activity. However, it is not known how the intravesicular serotonin concentration is sensed and how the signal is transmitted to the G-protein.The present study was undertaken to shed light on the upstream signaling events involved in the down-regulation of monoamine uptake by G-proteins. As an approach, we used CHO cell lines transfected with VMAT1 or VMAT2. Such cells express endogenous Gαo2 but are devoid of monoamine transporters or monoamine synthesizing and degrading enzymes, allowing for unperturbed external manipulation of monoamines. We found that, similar to our previous observations in platelets, G-protein-mediated regulation is dependent on the loading status of the vesicles, but with differences between the two transporter isoforms. Furthermore, deletion mutagenesis of the first intravesicular loop of VMAT1 and VMAT2 revealed that this domain is essential for the manifestation of G-protein-dependent transport regulation, suggesting that it is the transporter itself that operates as an upstream sensor in the signal transduction to heterotrimeric G-proteins.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies—A mouse monoclonal antibody against Gαo2 (clone 101.4 and 101.1) (14Winter S.

The following oligonucleotides were used: VMAT2-1, 5′-CATGGCCCTGAGCGATCTGG-3′; VMAT2-2, 5′-AATTCGCCGCCGCCGCCGCCAACCACGACGGTGAGCAGCATG-3′; VMAT2-3, 5′-GAATTCGATTTCCGTAGAGTTTTTCTCATGC-3′; VMAT2-4, 5′-GAATTCGTCCCTTCGGACTGTCCCAG-3′; VMAT2-5, 5′-GAATTCCAAGTTGGGCTGCTGTTTGCC-3′; and VMAT2-6, 5′-CTCGAGTCAGTCACTTTCAGATTCTTC-3′.PCR was performed using Pfu polymerase, and the amplicons from VMAT2-1/VMAT2-2, VMAT2-1/VMAT2-3, VMAT2-4/VMAT2-6, and VMAT2-5/VMAT2-6 were individually cloned into PCR-script vector from Stratagene. Subsequently, the VMAT2-1/VMAT2-2 and VMAT2-1/VMAT2-3 were subjected to a restriction digestion using HindIII and EcoRI from the respective PCR-script clones and ligated to either VMAT2-4/VMAT2-6 or VMAT2-5/VMAT2-6 to generate VMAT2ΔQ61-T113 (short loop, i.e. variable region deleted) and VMAT2ΔP42-V130 (no loop, i.e. loop substituted by 5× Gly) (see Fig. 6), respectively. VMAT2 cDNA and the loop deletion mutants were subcloned into pCDNA 3.0 into HindIII and XhoI sites.VMAT1 DNA (accession number M97380) was used to create a deletion mutant of the variable region from His62-Val117 using the following oligonucleotides: VMAT1-1, 5′-ATCGGATCCATGCTCCAGGTTGTTCTG-3′; VMAT1-2, 5′-CTCGAATTCCAGAGAAGAGTTGCTGTCTTTG-3′; VMAT1-3, 5′-CAGAATTCCCAAAAAACAACTGCTTGCAAGG-3′; and VMAT1-4, 5′-ACACTCGAGTTACTCCCCGCTGCTAGGATC-3′.PCR was performed using Pfu polymerase, and the amplicons from VMAT1-1/VMAT1-2 and VMAT1-3/VMAT1-4 were subjected to a restriction digestion using BamHI and EcoRI for VMAT1-1/VMAT1-2 and EcoRI and XhoI for VMAT1-3/VMAT1-4 from the respective PCR-script clones and then ligated to generate VMAT1ΔH62-V117. VMAT1 cDNA and the loop deletion mutant were subcloned into pCDNA 3.0 into BamHI and XhoI sites.CHO Cell Lines—CHO cells were transfected with wild-type VMAT-DNA using calcium-phosphate precipitation. The cells were grown in 35-mm dishes, the culture medium was changed 4 h prior to transfection to achieve exponential growth at the time of transfection. Briefly, plasmid was mixed with calcium and then with phosphate (final concentrations: 10 μg/ml plasmid DNA, 125 mm CaCl2, and 0.75 mm Na2HPO4). After 1 min 100 μl of the resulting suspension was added, and cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Then cells were washed in PBS containing 1 mm EGTA, detached, and seeded on 100 mm dishes. In some experiments the Lipofectamine™ transfection reagent (Invitrogen) was used instead according to the manufacturer's instructions.To create stable cell lines, geneticin was added 48 h after the transfection procedure, and the medium was changed daily. The remaining cells were isolated by limiting dilution, and the clones were analyzed by immunoblot analysis, immunofluorescence microscopy, and serotonin uptake for VMAT expression and activity. The VMAT1-expressing CHO clone (CHOF14.6) used in some of the experiments was kindly provided by B. Nürnberg (Heinrich-Heine-Universität, Düsseldorf, Germany).CHO and CHOVMAT1 cells were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. CHO cells expressing wild-type or mutant VMAT2 were cultured in the same medium supplemented with 400 μg/ml geneticin.Immunoblot Analysis—The cells were collected and centrifuged for 5 min at 200 × g. All of the following steps were carried out at 4 °C. After resuspension in 320 mm sucrose, 4 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, supplemented with protease-inhibitors (pepstatin, leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), the cells were homogenized using a ball homogenizer (40 cycles; EMBL Germany). The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 × g, and the postnuclear supernatant was spun down for 30 min at 360,000 × g. The resulting pellet was resuspended in sucrose buffer, analyzed for protein content, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. After transfer to nitrocellulose, the proteins were analyzed using the indicated antibodies and the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences).Immunofluorescence Microscopy—The cells were grown on glass coverslips, washed twice with PBS, and fixed in 4% formaline in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 45 min at room temperature. After three rinses with PBS they were incubated with blocking solution containing 5% normal goat serum and 2% bovine serum albumin dissolved in PBS supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature. Incubation with VMAT1, VMAT2, and Gαo2 antibodies diluted in blocking solution was performed at 4 °C overnight. After two rinses with PBS the cells were incubated in the dark with fluorescence marker labeled secondary antibody diluted in 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1.5 h at room temperature. After two rinses with PBS and one rinse in water, the coverslips were mounted on glass slides for fluorescence microscopic analysis.Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy—The localization of VMAT1, VMAT2, and Gαo2 was visualized using a Leica TCS confocal laser scanning microscope and a 40× oil immersion objective. Fluorescent dyes (goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 488 and goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 594, obtained from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were excited at wavelengths of 488 and 543 nm, respectively. Fluorescent signals from the green and red channels were collected sequentially using two filters at 498-535 and 587-666 nm, respectively. The data from the two channels were merged into two-color images (resolution 1024 × 1024 pixels).Serotonin Uptake into CHOVMAT Cells—The cells were collected and centrifuged for 5 min at 200 × g. Incubation with SLO was performed in KG buffer containing 150 mm potassium glutamate, 20 mm PIPES, 4 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, adjusted to pH 7.0 with KOH as described elsewhere. Briefly, the cells were incubated with SLO (about 500 hemolytic units/3-5 × 105 cells) for 10 min on ice. Under this condition SLO monomers bind to the cholesterol of the plasma membrane. After removal of unbound SLO, oligomerization and pore formation can be initiated by elevation of the temperature, restricting permeability to the plasma membrane (5Höltje M. von Jagow B. Pahner I.

Incubation was performed at 37 °C for 15 min. Preloading solution was removed by centrifugation (2 min, 1090 × g, 4 °C). The cells were washed in KG buffer and divided into individual reaction cups. Uptake was started by resuspending cells in 50 μl of KG buffer containing 1 mm ATP supplemented with 1 mm ascorbic acid and 40 nm [3H]serotonin. Additives such as the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue GMP-P(NH)P or reserpine were applied during this step. Incubation was performed for 10 min at 37 °C and stopped by adding 1 ml of ice-cold KG buffer followed by rapid centrifugation. The pellets were then lysed in 0.4% Triton X-100 to determine radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting and protein content using the bicinchoninic acid method.Serotonin Uptake into Blood Platelets—Mouse or rat platelets were prepared as described elsewhere (10Höltje M.

The 350,000 × g pellet was resuspended in potassium glutamate buffer by passing it five times each through 23- and 27-gauge needles, respectively. Then synaptic vesicles were divided into individual reaction cups. Uptake was performed as described above but was stopped by the addition of 400 μl of ice-cold KG buffer followed by rapid centrifugation at 440,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellets were analyzed for radioactivity and protein content.Experimental Design—All of the experiments presented were repeated at least two or three times. Individual uptake experiments were performed in triplicate.RESULTSG-protein-mediated Inhibition of VMAT Activity Is Reconstituted in CHO Cells and Depends on Preloading of Internal Storage Organelles—For measuring serotonin uptake into VMAT-containing intracellular vesicles, we permeabilized CHO cells transfected either with VMAT1 (CHOVMAT1) or VMAT2 (CHOVMAT2) with SLO. SLO creates stable pores in the plasma membrane, which allow for direct access of metabolites to the cell interior while effectively equilibrating all metabolite and ion gradients between the cytoplasm and the incubation medium (5Höltje M. von Jagow B.

Just Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology, 2000: 557-575Crossref Google Scholar).Permeabilized CHOVMAT1 and CHOVMAT2 cells exhibited robust ATP-dependent serotonin uptake that was inhibited by reserpine. Some serotonin accumulation was also observed when nontransfected CHO cells were used, but this probably represents unspecific adsorption because it was not affected by reserpine (Fig. 1A). Similarly, no reserpine-sensitive transport was observed in either transfected or nontransfected cells when the permeabilization step was omitted (Fig. 1A). To exclude that the residual transport activity by nonpermeabilized cells is due to the presence of the plasma membrane transporter for serotonin, uptake was also monitored in the presence of the serotonin inhibitor fluoxetine. No change was observed (not shown).FIGURE 1Expression and activity of VMAT1 and VMAT2 in stably transfected CHO cells. A, intact and SLO-permeabilized cells were incubated with [3H] serotonin (40 nm). Unspecific uptake was determined in the presence of 6 μm reserpine. Transfected but nonpermeabilized (intact) CHOVMAT cells exhibit no reserpine-sensitive uptake. Following permeabilization with SLO, only transfected cell lines show a reserpine-sensitive vesicular accumulation of serotonin between 2.5 and 3 pmol/mg of protein. B, postnuclear supernatants of VMAT-expressing and native CHO cells were centrifuged at 360,000 × g for 30 min. The resuspended pellets were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Native and transfected CHO cells express Gαo2. VMAT1 and VMAT2 is detected only in the respective stably transfected cell lines. C, VMAT1 or VMAT2 is detected by immunofluorescence microscopy in transfected cell lines using isoform specific antibodies. D, partial co-expression of VMAT1 and VMAT2 with Gαo2 in stably transfected cell lines. Confocal laser scanning microscopy reveals a predominant cytoplasmatic localization of VMAT1 and VMAT2 in CHO cells. Gαo2 (detected by clone 101.1), in addition, also localizes to the plasma membrane. Scale bar,30 μm. E, kinetics of serotonin transport by VMAT1 (top panel) and VMAT2 (bottom panel) were analyzed in stably transfected CHO cells following SLO permeabilization. Uptake was performed for 10 min at 37 °C using KG-ATP buffer containing 40 nm [3H] serotonin and increasing concentrations of unlabeled serotonin. Transport corrected for unspecific uptake in the presence of reserpine saturated at 100 μm. Under these conditions the Km values were in the range of 5-15 μm. Higher affinities were observed when the reaction was carried out at 29 °C with apparent Km ranging between 1 and 3 μm (6Peter D. Jiminez J. Liu Y. Kim J. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7231-7237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; data not shown). Each experiment was repeated at least twice. The values represent the means of three samples ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Immunoblot and immunofluorescence microscopic analysis confirmed that transfection resulted in robust expression of VMAT1 and VMAT2 in the respective cell lines (Fig. 1, B and C). Furthermore, CHO cells contain endogenous Gαo2 as shown by a previously characterized monoclonal antibody specific for Gαo2 (Fig. 1B). Double immunolabeling experiments in either CHOVMAT1 or CHOVMAT2 cells revealed a broad co-localization between Gαo2 and the respective transporter on internal membranes (Fig. 1D). Finally we determined uptake kinetics at different serotonin concentrations into SLO permeabilized CHOVMAT1 or CHOVMAT2 cells (Fig. 1E). Collectively, these data show that both CHOVMAT1 and CHO-VMAT2 cell lines display serotonin uptake with properties typical for VMATs in other systems and furthermore that VMATs are localized to internal membranes that also contain endogenous Go2.To investigate whether VMAT activity is regulated by G-proteins, we performed uptake experiments in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue GMP-P(NH)P, which is commonly used as an effective activator of trimeric GTPases. As shown in Fig. 2 (first columns) GMP-P(HN)P did not inhibit serotonin uptake by VMAT1 and VMAT2 expressing CHO cells. However, when permeabilized CHOVMAT1 and CHO-VMAT2 cells were preloaded with increasing concentration of various monoamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, and histamine), G-protein-mediated inhibition of serotonin uptake became apparent (Fig. 2). These findings resemble our previous observations of the serotonin-depleted platelets of Tph1-/- mice, in which G-protein-mediated inhibition of serotonin uptake was dependent on preloading with serotonin or norepinephrine (10Höltje M. Winter S. Walther D. Pahner I. Hörtnagl H. Ottersen O.P. Bader M. Ahnert-Hilger G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15850-15858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Monoamine concentrations required for effective preloading of CHOVMAT cells were somewhat higher than for preloading of platelets (10Höltje M. Winter S. Walther D. Pahner I. Hörtnagl H.

The reasons for this difference are unclear, but it is conceivable that this is related to the need of the VMATs to fill endosomal compartments that are considerably larger than secretory vesicles.FIGURE 2GMP-P(NH)P-mediated inhibition of serotonin uptake by VMAT expressing CHO cells following preloading with various monoamines. Permeabilized CHOVMAT1 (top panel) and CHOVMAT2 (bottom panel) cells were incubated with 30, 300, or 3000 μm of the indicated monoamines for 15 min at 37 °C in KG-ATP buffer. The cells were then washed, and uptake of [3H] serotonin was performed with or without 100 μm GMP-P(NH)P as described. For CHOVMAT1 cells, prior to preloading there is no GMP-P(NH)P-induced inhibition. After preincubation with 300 μm or 3 mm of each monoamine G-protein activation inhibited vesicular uptake of serotonin by 20-45%. For CHOVMAT2 cells, prior to preloading, there is no GMP-P(NH)P-induced inhibition. G-protein activation inhibits serotonin uptake following preincubation with 300 or 3000 μm of norepinephrine, dopamine or serotonin. The values represent the means of three samples ± S.D. The values are obtained from different experiments each repeated twice and run in triplicate with a control (no preloading) and preloading with one of the indicated monoamines at concentrations from 30 to 3000 μm. GMP-P(NH)P-induced inhibition in control cells represents the mean value (n = 12) from four different experiments. Uptake in the absence of GMP-P(NH)P for each monoamine concentration used during preloading was set as 100%; the percentage of the respective GMP-P(NH)P-mediated inhibition is shown. Individual experiments for CHOVMAT1 cells preloaded with epinephrine and for CHOVMAT2 cells preloaded with either epinephrine or norepinephrine are inserted. Preloading with monoamines decreased the following serotonin uptake and initiated G-protein-mediated inhibition. Note that there is no inhibition of serotonin uptake in CHOVMAT2 cells following epinephrine preloading.

https://openalex.org/W1988109163,"We have previously demonstrated that the transcription factor NF-κB is activated by histone deacetylase inhibitors in a PI3K/Akt-dependent manner. The molecular mechanisms governing this process have not been well described. By virtue of their inhibitory action, it is unclear whether the addition of histone deacetylase inhibitors simply preserves the acetylation status of RelA/p65 or whether they actively stimulate signaling cascades that result in increased acetylation and transcription of NF-κB. Here we provide evidence that suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid stimulates NF-κB transcription through a signaling cascade that involves activation of both the serine/threonine kinase Akt and the p300 acetyltransferase. Using newly developed phosphospecific antibodies to p300 (pSer1834), and site-directed mutant proteins, we find that suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid stimulates Akt activity, which is required to phosphorylate p300 at Ser1834. Akt-mediated phosphorylation of p300 dramatically increases its acetyltransferase activity as measured by an increased acetylation of RelA/p65 at Lys310, a modification that is required for full NF-κB transcription. Importantly, coordinate activation of Akt/p300 pathway by suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid occurs at the chromatin level, resulting in recruitment of activated Akt (pSer473), p300 (pSer1834), acetylated RelA/p65 (Lys310), and RNA polymerase II to the NF-κB-dependent cIAP-2 and Bfl-1/A1 promoters. These studies provide evidence that histone deacetylase inhibitors, such as suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, not only inhibit deacetylase activity but also stimulate active NF-κB transcription and cell survival through signaling pathways involving Akt and increased p300 acetyltransferase activity."

The periplasmic protein FhuD binds and transfers ferrichrome to the cytoplasmic membrane-associated permease FhuB/C. We exploited phage display to map protein-protein interactions in the E. coli cell envelope that contribute to ferrichrome transport. By panning random phage libraries against TonB and against FhuD, we identified interaction surfaces on each of these two proteins. Their interactions were detected in vitro by dynamic light scattering and indicated a 1:1 TonB-FhuD complex. FhuD residue Thr-181, located within the siderophore-binding site and mapping to a predicted TonB-interaction surface, was mutated to cysteine. FhuD T181C was reacted with two thiol-specific fluorescent probes; addition of the siderophore ferricrocin quenched fluorescence emissions of these conjugates. Similarly, quenching of fluorescence from both probes confirmed binding of TonB and established an apparent KD of 300 nM. Prior saturation of the siderophorebinding site of FhuD with ferricrocin did not alter affinity of TonB for FhuD. Binding, further characterized with surface plasmon resonance, indicated a higher affinity complex with KD values in the low nanomolar range. Addition of FhuD to a preformed TonB-FhuA complex resulted in formation of a ternary complex. These observations led us to propose a novel mechanism in which TonB acts as a scaffold, directing FhuD to regions within the periplasm where it is poised to accept and deliver siderophore. Iron, an essential nutrient for almost all bacterial species, is required for metabolic processes, including electron transfer, oxygen activation, and biosynthesis of amino acids and nucleosides (1). However, Fe 3 is scarce in the extracellular environment. Gram-negative bacteria have evolved transport processes that utilize siderophores to scavenge extracellular Fe 3 by high affinity chelation.

https://openalex.org/W2092647221,"PhlD, a type III polyketide synthase from Pseudomonas fluorescens, catalyzes the synthesis of phloroglucinol from three molecules of malonyl-CoA. Kinetic analysis by direct measurement of the appearance of the CoASH product (k(cat) = 24 +/- 4 min(-1) and Km = 13 +/- 1 microM) gave a k(cat) value more than an order of magnitude higher than that of any other known type III polyketide synthase. PhlD exhibits broad substrate specificity, accepting C4-C12 aliphatic acyl-CoAs and phenylacetyl-CoA as the starters to form C6-polyoxoalkylated alpha-pyrones from sequential condensation with malonyl-CoA. Interestingly, when primed with long chain acyl-CoAs, PhlD catalyzed extra polyketide elongation to form up to heptaketide products. A homology structural model of PhlD showed the presence of a buried tunnel extending out from the active site to assist the binding of long chain acyl-CoAs. To probe the structural basis for the unusual ability of PhlD to accept long chain acyl-CoAs, both site-directed mutagenesis and saturation mutagenesis were carried out on key residues lining the tunnel. Three mutations, M21I, H24V, and L59M, were found to significantly reduce the reactivity of PhlD with lauroyl-CoA while still retaining its physiological activity to synthesize phloroglucinol. Our homology modeling and mutational studies indicated that even subtle changes in the tunnel volume could affect the ability of PhlD to accept long chain acyl-CoAs. This suggested novel strategies for combinatorial biosynthesis of unnatural pharmaceutically important polyketides."
https://openalex.org/W1965529563,"Thyroid hormone activation is catalyzed by two deiodinases, D1 and D2. Whereas D1 is a stable plasma membrane protein, D2 is resident in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and has a 20-min half-life due to selective ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Here we have shown that stable retention explains D2 residency in the ER, a mechanism that is nevertheless over-ridden by fusion to the long-lived plasma membrane protein, sodium-iodine symporter. Fusion to D2, but not D1, dramatically shortened sodium-iodine symporter half-life through a mechanism dependent on an 18-amino acid D2-specific instability loop. Similarly, the D2-specific loop-mediated protein destabilization was also observed after D2, but not D1, was fused to the stable ER resident protein SEC62. This indicates that the instability loop in D2, but not its subcellular localization, is the key determinant of D2 susceptibility to ubiquitination and rapid turnover rate. Our data also show that the 6 N-terminal amino acids, but not the 12 C-terminal ones, are the ones required for D2 recognition by WSB-1."
https://openalex.org/W2093092552,"This study provides evidence that the tumor suppressor protein, p53, is a transcriptional repressor of PKD1. Kidneys of p53-null mice expressed higher Pkd1 mRNA levels than wild-type littermates; γ-irradiation suppressed PKD1 gene expression in p53+/+ but not p53–/– cells; and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated the binding of p53 to the PKD1 promoter in vivo. In transient transfection assays, p53 repressed PKD1 promoter activity independently of endogenous p21. Deletion analysis mapped p53-mediated repression to the proximal promoter region of PKD1. Mutations of the DNA binding or C-terminal minimal repression domains of p53 abolished its ability to repress PKD1. Moreover, trichostatin A, an inhibitor of histone deacetylase activity, attenuated p53-induced repression of the PKD1 promoter. These findings, together with previous reports showing that dedifferentiated Pkd1-deficient cells express lower p53 and p21 levels, suggest a model whereby PKD1 signaling activates the p53-p21 differentiation pathway. In turn, p53 cooperates with histone deacetylases to repress PKD1 gene transcription. Loss of a p53-mediated negative feedback loop in PKD1 mutant cells may therefore contribute to deregulated PKD1 expression and cystogenesis."

The identity of all constructs was confirmed by sequencing. Adenoviral Constructs—The AdEasy-vector system (Qbiogene) was used to generate adenoviral constructs (31He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3250) Google Scholar). The His c-myc-tagged COMP constructs were cloned from the pCEP-Pu plasmids generated here or in previous studies (25Thur J. Rosenberg K. Nitsche D.P. Pihlajamaa T. Ala-Kokko L. Heinegård D.

This vector was linearized with PmeI, gel-purified, and extracted with phenol/chloroform. The vector pAdEasy-1 was purified by cesium chloride gradient centrifugation and cotransformed with the linearized pShuttleCMV into electrocompetent BJ1583 bacterial cells (Qbiogene), where homologous recombination between both plasmids took place. Resulting clones were screened for recombination by BamHI digestion. The DNA of positive clones was amplified in ultracompetent XL10-Gold bacterial cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Control digests were performed with BamHI, HindIII, XhoI, NotI, NheI, PaeI, KpnI, SnaI, and AclI to ensure the presence of the insert and the stability of the recombinant DNA. Recombinants were digested with PacI, purified by phenol/chloroform, and transfected into QBI-293 cells using FuGene6 (Roche Applied Science, 5 μg of DNA with 15 μl of FuGENE for 1.5 × 109 cells). The adenoviruses were serially amplified until 1012 viral particles were obtained. These were purified by cesium chloride gradient centrifugation, and CsCl was removed by dialysis before storage of the adenovirus at -80 °C. Viral infectious titers were determined using plaque assay and tissue culture infectious dose 50 (viral dilution, at which 50% of wells contain growing virus) methods in triplicate experiments. The resulting titer was verified using a Southern hybridization technique (32Kreppel F. Biermann V. Kochanek S. Schiedner G. Hum. Gene Ther. 2002; 13: 1151-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and ranged from 2 × 109 to 4 × 1010 infectious particles/ml with good concordance of the Southern hybridization technique with the tissue culture infectious dose 50. Titers obtained with plaque assays were 10- to 100-fold lower. Culture of Primary Bovine Chondrocytes—Primary bovine articular chondrocytes were isolated by enzymatic digestion of cartilage from shoulder joints of 18- to 24-month-old animals as described earlier (33Zaucke F. Dinser R. Maurer P. Paulsson M. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Chondrocytes were cultured in monolayer and transfected 5 days after isolation. Cellular viability and COMP secretion was monitored 3-6 days after transfection. For long term experiments, cells were transduced with 20 multiplicities of infection (m.o.i.) of the adenoviral vectors and then embedded in 1.2% alginate gels as described earlier (33Zaucke F. Dinser R. Maurer P. Paulsson M. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The culture medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum was changed twice weekly. 100 μm ascorbate was added to the culture medium to enhance collagen biosynthesis. Transfection and Transduction of Chondrocytes with Wild-type and Mutated COMP Constructs—Plasmids encoding for wild-type and mutated COMP constructs were transfected into primary chondrocytes with FuGene6 using previously established conditions (34Dinser R. Kreppel F. Zaucke F. Blank C. Paulsson M. Kochanek S. Maurer P. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 116: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Adenoviral infection was performed with 20 m.o.i. using 8 × 109 chondrocytes in 500 μl of serumfree medium, directly after isolation if not otherwise indicated. The suspension was incubated for 1 h. Cells were then pelleted and resuspended in 1.2% alginate for gel culture (14Dinser R. Zaucke F. Kreppel F. Hultenby K. Kochanek S. Paulsson M. Maurer P. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 33Zaucke F. Dinser R. Maurer P. Paulsson M. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). XTT Assay—The cellular viability was determined using XTT (2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium hydroxide) in a microculture assay. XTT is metabolized by living cells to a formazan product, which is soluble in water and detectable by photometry. To obtain a more efficient reduction of XTT by the cells, phenazine methosulfate (Sigma) was added to the assay as described earlier (35Scudiero D.A. Shoemaker R.H. Paull K. D Monks A. Tierney S. Nofziger T.H. Currens M.J. Seniff D. Boyd M.R. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 4827-4833PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in 6-well plates, and the XTT assay was performed 6 days after transfection. After 4 h of incubation, the optical density was measured at 450 nm. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207123) Google Scholar). Secretion of recombinant proteins was analyzed by SDS-PAGE of cell culture supernatants and cell extracts, obtained by sonication, followed by immunoblotting. Samples were concentrated by ethanol precipitation. For immunoblots, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and incubated with a mouse antibody directed against the c-myc epitope (9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) diluted in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% low fat milk powder. Bound antibodies were detected by luminescence using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit antimouse IgG (DAKO), 1.25 mm 3-aminophthalhydrazide, 225 mm p-coumaric acid, and 0.01% H2O2. Metabolic Labeling of COMP—The kinetics of COMP secretion was assessed in pulse-chase experiments. Cells in monolayer were starved for 2 h in cysteine- and methionine-free medium, pulsed for 1 h with medium containing 50 μCi/ml of a [35S]methionine/cysteine labeling mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and chased in normal medium. After harvest of culture supernatants, monolayer cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4 (lysis buffer). Alginate beads were analyzed after 4 weeks of culture. Beads were starved over night in cysteine- and methionine-free medium, pulsed for 4 h with medium containing 50 μCi/ml of a [35S]methionine/cysteine labeling mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and chased in normal medium for 72 h. Supernatants were harvested, and the beads were dissolved in 55 mm sodium citrate and 150 mm sodium chloride as described previously (33Zaucke F. Dinser R. Maurer P. Paulsson M. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The citrate-resistant fraction was treated with lysis buffer. Supernatants, citrate-soluble fractions, and the lysed citrate-resistant fraction were immunoprecipitated as described below. Immunoprecipitation of COMP—A mouse monoclonal antibody directed against the c-myc epitope (9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was coupled to protein A-agarose for 4 h at room temperature. Unspecific binding was blocked with 10% bovine serum albumin, and samples were precleared with protein A-agarose. The antibody-protein A beads were added, and the mixtures were incubated overnight at 4 °C. After precipitation, the beads were washed three times with 1% Triton X-100 in Tris-buffered saline and boiled for 10 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 4% mercaptoethanol to elute the bound protein. SDS-PAGE was performed in 7.5% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were incubated in 1 m sodium salicylate and dried, and the radioactivity in the bands was determined with a PhosphorImager and ImageQuaNT software (Amersham Biosciences). Immunohistochemical Staining of Chondrocytes—Cells were plated and transfected in chamber slides (Nunc) and grown for 3 more days. After fixation with 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilization using 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, the cultures were treated with 2% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline as blocking reagent. The cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h, followed by incubation with a secondary antibody for 1 more h. Primary antibodies directed against protein disulfide isomerase (Biomol), a marker for the ER, and 58K (Sigma), a marker for the Golgi apparatus, were used together with a polyclonal rabbit antibody directed against the c-myc epitope (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), visualizing transgenic COMP, followed by secondary Cy3- and Alexa 488-conjugated antibodies against mouse or rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes). The slides were finally mounted in DAKO fluorescent mounting medium and evaluated with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica TCS SP) using krypton and argon lasers. Alginate beads were embedded in paraffin, processed, and stained as described previously (33Zaucke F. Dinser R. Maurer P. Paulsson M. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), using the monoclonal mouse antibody 9E10 against the c-myc epitope. Analysis of Collagen Synthesis—Alginate cultures were analyzed 4 weeks after transduction with 20 m.o.i. of virus. On day -7, fresh complete medium containing 5 μCi/ml of [14C]proline was added. On days -5 and -3, the supernatant was harvested and replaced by fresh medium of identical composition. On day 0, the harvested supernatants were combined, and the alginate beads were dissolved as described above. Equal proportions of the supernatant and the citrate-soluble matrix were precipitated with 30% ammonium sulfate. The resulting pellets and the citrate-resistant alginate fraction were digested with 100 μg/ml pepsin in 0.5 m acetic acid at 4 °C for 5 days. Samples were dialyzed against 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate and lyophilized prior to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (14Dinser R. Zaucke F. Kreppel F. Hultenby K. Kochanek S. Paulsson M. Maurer P. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) followed by determination of radioactivity (see above). Transmission Electron Microscopy—After 4 weeks of culture, alginate beads were fixed overnight in 3% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde, 3 mm calcium chloride, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4, postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide (Chempur) in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4, dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, and precontrasted in 1.5% ethanolic uranyl acetate. The beads were further dehydrated in a graded ethanol series to 100% and transferred into propylene oxide for embedding in araldite CY212 (Serva). Ultrathin sections (70 nm) were prepared, picked up on Formvar-coated copper grids, and contrasted in 1.5% aqueous uranyl acetate and 0.1% lead citrate before viewing the samples by transmission electron microscopy (Leo 902, Zeiss). Electron micrographs were taken with the Megaview camera system (Soft Imaging System). Immunogold Labeling—Alginate beads were incubated overnight in 2% glutaraldehyde, 0.5% paraformaldehyde, 3 mm calcium chloride, 0.1 m cacodylate, pH 7.4. The beads were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series and finally embedded in LR gold (Fluka). The polymerization took place at -25 °C for 24 h under UV light. For immunoreaction, ultrathin sections were incubated with a gold-labeled c-myc antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Contrasting and viewing was as described above. Cell Attachment Assay—Primary bovine chondrocytes were isolated as described above, and COMP variants were expressed and purified as described earlier (25Thur J. Rosenberg K. Nitsche D.P.

Paulsson M. Maurer P. Zaucke F. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 479-487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 96-well plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with purified proteins. Unspecific binding sites were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin. 5 × 104 chondrocytes were incubated for 20 h at 37 °C in substrate-coated wells as described earlier (37DiCesare P.E. Mörgelin M. Mann K. Paulsson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 927-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Non-attached cells were removed by careful washing with phosphate-buffered saline. Attached cells were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde and stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 30 min. The excess of dye was washed off and after addition of 0.2% Triton X-100, the plate was measured in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader at 562 nm. COMP carrying mutations associated with PSACH or MED was expressed in primary bovine chondrocytes after plasmid-based and adenoviral gene transfer. All constructs encoded an N-terminal His c-Myc tag to allow the discrimination between transgenic and endogenous COMP (Fig. 1). The mutation D469Δ was chosen because it is the most frequent PSACH-associated COMP mutation (3Hecht J.T. Nelson L.D. Crowder E. Wang Y. Elder F.F. Harrison W.R. Francomano C.A. Prange C.K.

The mutation D361Y was for comparison, because it is also an aspartate exchange located in the type 3 domain and is associated with the milder disease form MED (39Loughlin J. Irven C. Mustafa Z.

H587R is particularly interesting, being one of the very few PSACH-associated COMP mutations within the putative collagen binding site in the C-terminal domain (27Holden P. Meadows R.S. Chapman K.L.

https://openalex.org/W2048850293,"Interleukin (IL)-6 is a proinflammatory cytokine that has been implicated in the expression of acute phase plasma proteins and hepatic insulin resistance through activation of the JAK/STAT3 pathway. Although previous studies have demonstrated that pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) exerts protection against inflammatory responses, its role in the regulation of IL-6 receptor signaling remains unclear. Here we show that treatment of cultured HepG2 hepatoma cells with PDTC inhibits IL-6-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation of STAT3 in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. No inhibition of JAK-1 activity was observed. To provide insight into PDTC signaling, we constructed a conditionally active STAT3 by fusing it with the ligand binding domain of the estrogen receptor (STAT3-ER). In the presence of 4-hydroxytamoxifen STAT3-ER was translocated in the nucleus of HepG2 cells in a phosphorylation-independent manner, and treatment with PDTC mitigated the response. Although STAT3 coprecipitated with heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) in control cells, coprecipitation of the two proteins was greatly reduced after PDTC treatment or after exposure to geldanamycin, an Hsp90 inhibitor. As a result there was a decrease in IL-6-induced association of STAT3 with the transcriptional coactivators FOXO1a and C/EBPbeta together with significant reduction in the expression of SOCS-3 protein and that of two major acute phase plasma proteins. Importantly, treatment of HepG2 cells and a primary culture of rat hepatocytes with PDTC restored insulin responsiveness that was abrogated by IL-6. These studies are consistent with the ability of PDTC to down-regulate IL-6-induced STAT3 activation by altering the stability of STAT3-Hsp90 complex."
https://openalex.org/W2151872315,"Rap2-interacting protein x (RPIPx) is a homolog of RPIP8, a specific effector of Rap2 GTPase. The N-terminal region of RPIP8, which contains the RUN domain, interacts with Rap2. Using cell-free synthesis and NMR, we determined that the region encompassing residues 83-255 of mouse RPIPx, which is 40-residues larger than the predicted RUN domain (residues 113-245), is the minimum fragment that forms a correctly folded protein. This fragment, the RPIPx RUN domain, interacted specifically with Rap2B in vitro in a nucleotide-dependent manner. The crystal structure of the RPIPx RUN domain was determined at 2.0A of resolution by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) method. The RPIPx RUN domain comprises eight anti-parallel α-helices, which form an extensive hydrophobic core, followed by an extended segment. The residues in the core region are highly conserved, suggesting the conservation of the RUN domain-fold among the RUN domain-containing proteins. The residues forming a positively charged surface are conserved between RPIP8 and its homologs, suggesting that this surface is important for Rap2 binding. In the crystal the putative Rap2 binding site of the RPIPx RUN domain interacts with the extended segment in a segment-swapping manner."
https://openalex.org/W1973900552,"Deletion of the yeast gene PKR1 (YMR123W) results in an inability to grow on iron-limited medium. Pkr1p is localized to the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. Cells lacking Pkr1p show reduced levels of the V-ATPase subunit Vph1p due to increased turnover of the protein in mutant cells. Reduced levels of the V-ATPase lead to defective copper loading of Fet3p, a component of the high affinity iron transport system. Levels of Vph1p in cells lacking Pkr1p are similar to cells unable to assemble a functional V-ATPase due to lack of a V0 subunit or an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) assembly factor. However, unlike yeast mutants lacking a V0 subunit or a V-ATPase assembly factor, low levels of Vph1p present in cells lacking Pkr1p are assembled into a V-ATPase complex, which exits the ER and is present on the vacuolar membrane. The V-ATPase assembled in the absence of Pkr1p is fully functional because the mutant cells are able to weakly acidify their vacuoles. Finally, overexpression of the V-ATPase assembly factor Vma21p suppresses the growth and acidification defects of pkr1Δ cells. Our data indicate that Pkr1p functions together with the other V-ATPase assembly factors in the ER to efficiently assemble the V-ATPase membrane sector."
https://openalex.org/W1992806337,"Dual leucine zipper-bearing kinase (DLK) is a mixed-lineage kinase family member that acts as an upstream activator of the c-Jun N-terminal kinases. As opposed to other components of this pathway, very little is currently known regarding the mechanisms by which DLK is regulated in mammalian cells. Here we identify the stress-inducible heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) as a negative regulator of DLK expression and activity. Support for this notion derives from data showing that Hsp70 induces the proteasomal degradation of DLK when both proteins are co-expressed in COS-7 cells. Hsp70-mediated degradation occurs with expression of wild-type DLK, which functions as a constitutively activated protein in these cells but not kinase-defective DLK. Interestingly, the Hsp70 co-chaperone CHIP, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, seems to be indispensable for this process since Hsp70 failed to induce DLK degradation in COS-7 cells expressing a CHIP mutant unable to catalyze ubiquitination or in immortalized fibroblasts derived from CHIP knock-out mice. Consistent with these data, we have found that endogenous DLK becomes sensitive to CHIP-dependent proteasomal degradation when it is activated by okadaic acid and that down-regulation of Hsp70 levels with an Hsp70 antisense attenuates this sensitivity. Therefore, our studies suggest that Hsp70 contributes to the regulation of activated DLK by promoting its CHIP-dependent proteasomal degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1994549057,"Lipoteichoic acid (LTA) represents immunostimulatory molecules expressed by Gram-positive bacteria. They activate the innate immune system via Toll-like receptors. We have investigated the role of serum proteins in activation of human macrophages by LTA from Staphylococcus aureus and found it to be strongly attenuated by serum. In contrast, the same cells showed a sensitive response to LTA and a significantly enhanced production of tumor necrosis factor alpha under serum-free conditions. We show that LTA interacts with the serum protein lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) and inhibits the integration of LBP into phospholipid membranes, indicating the formation of complexes of LTA and soluble LBP. The addition of recombinant human LBP to serum-free medium inhibited the production of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukins 6 and 8 after stimulation of human macrophages with LTA in a dose-dependent manner. Using anti-LBP antibodies, this inhibitory effect could be attributed to soluble LBP, whereas LBP in its recently described transmembrane configuration did not modulate cell activation. Also, using primary alveolar macrophages from rats, we show a sensitive cytokine response to LTA under serum-free culture conditions that was strongly attenuated in the presence of serum. In summary, our data suggest that innate immune recognition of LTA is organ-specific with negative regulation by LBP in serum-containing compartments and sensitive recognition in serum-free compartments like the lung."
https://openalex.org/W2160509949,"NAD functions in multiple aspects of cellular metabolism and signaling through enzymes that covalently transfer ADP-ribose from NAD to acceptor proteins, thereby altering their function. NAD is a substrate for two enzyme families, mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases (mARTs) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs), that covalently transfer an ADP-ribose monomer or polymer, respectively, to acceptor proteins. ART2, a mART, is a phenotypic marker of immunoregulatory cells found on the surface of T lymphocytes, including intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs). We have shown that the auto-ADP-ribosylation of the ART2.2 allelic protein is multimeric. Our backbone structural alignment of ART2 (two alleles of the rat art2 gene have been reported, for simplicity, the ART2.2 protein investigated in this study will be referred to as ART2) and PARP suggested that multimeric auto-ADP-ribosylation of ART2 may represent an ADP-ribose polymer, rather than multiple sites of mono-ADP-ribosylation. To investigate this, we used highly purified recombinant ART2 and demonstrated that ART2 catalyzes the formation of an ADP-ribose polymer by sequencing gel and by HPLC and MS/MS mass spectrometry identification of PR-AMP, a breakdown product specific to poly(ADP-ribose). Furthermore, we identified the site of ADP-ribose polymer attachment on ART2 as Arg-185, an arginine in a crucial loop of its catalytic core. We found that endogenous ART2 on IELs undergoes multimeric auto-ADP-ribosylation more efficiently than ART2 on peripheral T cells, suggesting that these distinct lymphocyte populations differ in their ART2 surface topology. Furthermore, ART2.2 IELs are more resistant to NAD-induced cell death than ART2.1 IELs that do not have multimeric auto-ADP-ribosylation activity. The data suggest that capability of polymerizing ADP-ribose may not be unique to PARPs and that poly(ADP-ribosylation), an established nuclear activity, may occur extracellularly and modulate cell function.

In infectious diseases like diphtheria, cholera, and pertussis, prokaryotic mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases (mARTs) act as toxins. They typically catalyze post-translational modification of specific proteins, often GTP-binding proteins, with one or more mono-ADP-ribose moieties. These modifications disrupt cellular metabolism by altering target protein function, resulting in disease (4Okazaki I.J. Kim H.J. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22052-22057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Mammalian mARTs are cytoplasmic and extracellular enzymes first isolated from muscle and lymphoid tissues (5Zolkiewska A. Nightingale M.S. Moss J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11352-11356Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). ART2 in the mouse functions as an mART; ART2 in the rat functions as an NAD glycohydrolase (generating free ADP-ribose and nicotinamide). Rat art2 encodes two allelic proteins, ART2.1 and ART2.2, that differ by 10 amino acids; whereas both proteins have NAD glycohydrolase activity, only ART2.2 has auto-ADP-ribosyltransferase activity (6Koch-Nolte F.

ART2 is anchored to the surface of T cells, including intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage, and it is also present in serum (9Waite D.J. Handler E.S. Mordes J.P. Rossini A.A. Greiner D.L. Cell. Immunol. 1993; 152: 82-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Addition of NAD to T cells reportedly inhibits proliferation (10Bortell R. Moss J. McKenna R.C. Rigby M.R. Niedzwiecki D. Stevens L.A. Patton W.A. Mordes J.P. Greiner D.L. Rossini A.A. J.

Mono-ADP-ribosylation involves nucleophilic attack on NAD by acceptor substrates such as the amino acids arginine, asparagine, or glutamate (16Oppenheimer N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4907-4910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Zhang R.G. Scott D.L. Westbrook M.L. Nance S. Spangler B.D. Shipley G.G. Westbrook E.M. J. Mol.

Many mARTs exhibit NAD glycohydrolase activity, consistent with water serving as a nucleophile. Polymers of ADP-ribose appear to be formed by a similar stereospecific, SN2-like, nucleophilic reaction in which a hydroxyl group from ribose is the nucleophile (19Miwa M. Saito H. Sakura H. Saikawa N. Watanabe F. Matsushima T. Sugimura T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1977; 4: 3997-4005Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 20Miwa M. Ishihara M. Takishima S. Takasuka N. Maeda M. Yamaizumi Z. Sugimura T. Yokoyama S. Miyazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2916-2921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The best understood structural determinant of nucleophile specificity is the ADP-ribosylating turn-turn (ARTT) motif in the catalytic core (21Han S. Arvai A.S. Clancy S.B. Tainer J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The sequence of the ARTT motif appears to control whether arginine or asparagine can act as a nucleophile in mART toxins. In PARPs, the ARTT motif region appears to define an acceptor site for ADP-ribose polymer elongation, suggesting that a hydroxyl group from ribose serves as the nucleophile (22Jung S. Miranda E.A. Demurcia J.M. Niedergang C. Delarue M. Schulz G.E. Demurcia G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 23Ruf A. Rolli V. de Murcia G. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In the case of ART2, the ARTT motif permits water to act as a nucleophile, resulting in NAD glycohydrolase activity (7Hara N. Tsuchiya M. Shimoyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29552-29555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 24Stevens L.A. Bourgeois C. Bortell R. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19591-19596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In previous studies of mARTs, including the prokaryotic mART toxins, multimeric ADP-ribosylation has been synonymous with mono-ADP-ribosylation at multiple sites (25Moss J. Stanley S.J. Watkins P.A. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7835-7837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and there are no reported exceptions. We have recently demonstrated that the auto-ADP-ribosylation of recombinant ART2 in vitro is multimeric, yet all automodification of ART2 was lost when a single arginine in the ARTT motif was mutated (24Stevens L.A. Bourgeois C. Bortell R. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19591-19596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In the present study, we observed multimeric auto-ADP-ribosylation of ART2 on IELs and on lymph node T cells following cell membrane disruption. We hypothesized that this multimeric ADP-ribosylation of ART2 represents extracellular poly(ADP-ribose) formation, and our results document for the first time the existence of extracellular PARP-like activity. Materials—Chemicals were purchased from Sigma. PCR primers were from the University of Massachusetts Medical School Center for AIDS Research. The pMAL-c2x vector was from New England Biolabs. PCR, ligation, and PCR purification (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) followed the manufacturer's protocols. Radiolabeled ([adenylate-32P]NAD, 1000 Ci/mmol, and [carbonyl-14C]NAD, 30-62 mCi/mmol) β-NAD were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Animals—WF rats have the art2b locus (expressing the ART2.2 allelic protein) and were obtained from Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Indianapolis, IN); WF.art2a congenic rats were developed at the University of Massachusetts. They express at least one copy of the “a” rather than the “b” allotype of the ART2 T cell alloantigen on chromosome 1 (26Mordes J.P. Leif J. Novak S. DeScipio C. Greiner D.L. Blankenhorn E.P. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3254-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For simplicity, we refer to them as WF.ART2.1 rats; wild type WF rats are designated WF.ART2.2. All animals (8-12 weeks of age) were housed in a viral antibody-free facility and maintained in accordance with recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, 1996) and the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Massachusetts Medical School. T Cell and IEL Isolation—Cervical and mesenteric lymph nodes were removed from rats killed in an atmosphere of 100% CO2. Single cell suspensions were prepared and T cells were purified by nylon wool column as described (13Todd D.J. Forsberg E.M. Greiner D.L. Mordes J.P. Rossini A.A. Bortell R. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 5356-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). IELs were prepared from rat small intestine by Percoll density gradient centrifugation as described (27Todd D. Singh A.J. Greiner D.L. Mordes J.P. Rossini A.A. Bortell R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 224: 111-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In some studies, IELs were incubated in serum-free medium (AIMV, plus 20 μm 2-mercaptoethanol) (Invitrogen). Structural Comparisons—Structures from the Protein Data Bank included: 1A26, 1GXY, 1GXZ, 1TOX, and 1XTC. Backbone structural alignments were generated with program O and figures with Pymol. Recombinant ART2—The pMAL-c2x vector was modified to express a His6 tag at the N terminus of maltose-binding protein by ligating the PCR product from the PMAL-c2x vector: forward primer, 5′-GTCAGCCGCCATATGCATCATCATCATCATCATAAAATCGAAGAAGGTAAACTGG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GGCGTGCCGCTCAGCACGCCAACGAAC-3′. Recombinant ART2 was subcloned from the pCR2.1 vector (8Rigby M.R. Bortell R. Stevens L.A. Moss J. Kanaitsuka T. Shigeta H. Mordes J.P. Greiner D.L. Rossini A.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4259-4265PubMed Google Scholar) into the His6-modified pMAL-c2x for expression. PCR primers were: forward primer, 5′-GTCAGCCGCGGATCCATGCTAGACACGGCTCCC-3′; and reverse primer, 5′-GGCGTGCCGTCGACTCACTTATTAGCTGTATAAGCAATTGTAGTTG-3′. Sequencing was performed by the University of Massachusetts Medical School Center for AIDS Research. The BL21(DE3) strain was transformed and selected for ampicillin (100 μg/ml) resistance. Expression was induced by 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 60 min at 37 °C. Cells were lysed by sonication, and inclusion bodies were pelleted by centrifugation at 32,000 × g, for 40 min at 4 °C. ART2 inclusion bodies were resolubilized in 6 m guanidine buffer (25 mm Tris·Cl, 1 mm reduced glutathione) and applied to nickelcharged iminodiacetic acid-agarose. A linear gradient was applied from the guanidine buffer to an activation buffer (50 mm Tris·Cl, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.5). HIS6MBPART2 fusion protein was eluted in an imidazole gradient (0-400 mm). The sample was then dialyzed against 25 mm Tris·Cl (pH 7.5). Anion exchange purification used a Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences), fractions with a NaCl gradient of 0-250 mm. NAD glycohydrolase activity was pooled, and the fusion partner was removed by digestion with factor Xa (New England Biolabs). The sample was washed through amylose resin (New England Biolabs) to remove residual HIS6MBP and undigested HIS6MBPART2 fusion proteins. Protein was quantified using Protein Dye Reagent Concentrate (Bio-Rad). Electrophoresis—Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue, autoradiography, or Western blot with the rabbit polyclonal antibody 1126 or 1742 (8Rigby M.R. Bortell R. Stevens L.A. Moss J. Kanaitsuka T. Shigeta H. Mordes J.P. Greiner D.L. Rossini A.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4259-4265PubMed Google Scholar) and ECL chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Autoradiography used Kodak X-Omat AR2 film. Poly(ADP-ribose) was resolved by electrophoresis using a modified sequencing gel format (28Alvarez-Gonzalez R. Jacobson M.K. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3218-3224Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Enzyme Assays—NADase activity was assayed in a volume of 0.3 ml containing 50 mm K3PO4 (pH 7.5), 100 μm NAD, and [carbonyl-14C]NAD (55,000 cpm) for 5 min at 30 °C (29Moss J. Manganiello V.C. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 4424-4427Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Assays of NAD concentration dependence were carried out in a volume of 0.15 ml containing 1.25 μg of ART2, 100 mm K3PO4 (pH 7.5), and radiolabeled NAD at a ratio of 1.5 μCi of 32P-labeled NAD/0.1 mm NAD; assays were run for 6 min at 30 °C with 0.1-10 mm NAD. Time course assays were carried out in a volume of 0.8 ml containing 6.5 μg of purified ART2 protein, 100 mm K3PO4 (pH 7.5), 20 mm NAD, and 1 mCi of 32P-labeled NAD at 30 °C. Polymer assays were carried out in a volume of 6 ml containing either 4 nmol of ADP-ribose-agmatine, 4 nmol of poly(ADPR) (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), 4 nmol of cholera toxin (List Biological Laboratories, Campbell, CA), 4 nmol of ART2, or 0.33 nmol of PARP (Biomol). The reaction buffer included 100 mm K3PO4 (pH 7.5), 10 mm NAD, and 100 μCi of 32P-labeled NAD (20 μCi in PARP sample); incubations were for 240 min at 30 °C. Proteins were precipitated with 25% trichloroacetic acid and washed with ethanol:acetone before MS studies. Dihydroxylboronyl Chromatography—Dihydroxylboronyl Bio-Rex affinity resin was used for isolation of ADP-ribose as described (30Shah G.M. Poirier D. Duchaine C. Brochu G. Desnoyers S. Lagueux J. Verreault A. Hoflack J.C. Kirkland J.B. Poirier G.G. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 227: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Hydroxylamine Cleavage—ADP-ribosyl protein bonds were hydrolyzed using 2 m hydroxylamine at pH 7.0 at 37 °C for 40 min as described (24Stevens L.A. Bourgeois C. Bortell R. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19591-19596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Endopeptidase Digestion—Auto-ADP-ribosylation reactions were carried out in a 10-ml volume containing 200 μg of ART2, 100 mm K3PO4 (pH 7.5), and 20 mm NAD for 60 min at 30 °C. Proteins were digested with chymotrypsin, trypsin, or Glu-C. Digests containing 100 μg of ART2 protein, 50 mm NH4HCO3 buffer (pH 7.8), 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% (w/v) RapiGest SF detergent (Waters, Milford, MA) were incubated for 60 min at 60 °C. After 30 min incubation at room temperature with 15 mm iodoacetamide, 2 μg of endopeptidase (1:50 protease:protein) were added, and the mixture (volume 50 μl) was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. HPLC—HPLC was carried out using a Waters 600 pump with a dual absorbance model 2487 detector and model 600 controller. Product identification anion exchange chromatography was run on a SynChropak Q column (Eichrom, 250 × 4.6 mm inner diameter) with a 50-mm guard column. Samples were digested with snake venom phosphodiesterase I (Worthington, Freehold, NJ) for 30 min at 37 °C as described (30Shah G.M. Poirier D. Duchaine C. Brochu G. Desnoyers S. Lagueux J. Verreault A. Hoflack J.C. Kirkland J.B. Poirier G.G. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 227: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and injected into the HPLC, which was subjected to a linear NaCl gradient at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min (average pressure 300 p.s.i.). Eluates were monitored by absorption at 260 nm. Mass Spectrometry—HPLC samples for ESI-MS were analyzed at a concentration of 100 μg/ml in 50% methanol and infused at 5 μl/min into the ESI ion source using a ThermoFinnigan LCQ quadruple ion trap mass spectrometer in negative ion mode. Full spectra were acquired from m/z 150-1500, and the major ions were subjected to collisional activation decomposition (CAD) analysis. MALDI-TOF MS (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry) was carried out on a Waters MALDI-L/R mass spectrometer. Sinnapinic acid or α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid was used as matrix. Peptides were identified using theoretical digests of ART2. Quadruple time-of-flight (Q-TOF) nanoscale HPLC-MS (MS/MS) analysis was carried out on a Waters model Q-TOF API-US mass spectrometer. Peptides were separated on a PorousR2 (Applied Biosciences, Salt Lake City, UT), 10 cm × 75-μm internal diameter, C18 reverse phase HPLC column and directly introduced into the nanoelectrospray ion source. Peptide sequence determination was carried out by CAD analysis in the Q-TOF. Conservation of Structural Elements and Catalytic Regions of ART2 and PARP—ART2.2 has auto-ADP-ribosyltransferase activity, and we have previously demonstrated that, in the presence of millimolar concentrations of NAD, the automodifications of recombinant ART2 protein are multimeric (24Stevens L.A. Bourgeois C. Bortell R. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19591-19596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Because all auto-ADP-ribosylations are lost upon mutation of a single arginine, we hypothesized that this multimeric auto-ADP-ribosylation of ART2 could represent poly(ADP-ribose) formation rather than mono-ADP-ribosylation at multiple sites. To investigate this we first compared the structures of PARP and ART2. Primary sequence analysis revealed three regions of similarity in the catalytic cores of mARTs and a typical PARP (PARP1, PDB 1A26) (31Okazaki I.J. Moss J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 485-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Backbone structural alignment of PARP and ART2 (ART2.2, PDB 1GXZ) also demonstrated three regions of structural similarity (Fig. 1, A and B). Region I contains three largely non-polar β-strands forming a small β-sheet. The first two β-strands bind the adenosine portion of the donor NAD (18Bell C.E. Eisenberg D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1137-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The third β-strand contains an arginine or histidine typically followed by a glycine and appears to be crucial for binding the nicotinamide mononucleotide of the donor NAD (18Bell C.E. Eisenberg D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1137-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 32Mueller-Dieckmann C. Ritter H. Haag F. Koch-Nolte F. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Region II is a motif (Y/SXS-X10-Y/F) that, by its U-shape, appears to form a critical hydrophobic pocket, holding the nicotinamide mononucleotide in a rigid conformation. Region III contains the ARTT motif within a loop, which appears to define an ADP-ribose acceptor site, as well as a short β-strand sequence. Both ART2 and PARP contain catalytic glutamates (Glu-190 and Glu-988, respectively, Fig. 1) that are critical for NAD catalysis and are highly conserved (7Hara N. Tsuchiya M. Shimoyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29552-29555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 32Mueller-Dieckmann C. Ritter H. Haag F. Koch-Nolte F. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). PARP lysine 903 (Lys-903), which is important for the polymerization activity (23Ruf A. Rolli V. de Murcia G. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), is part of the α-helix of its Region II. The amide group of Lys-903 extends toward the catalytic glutamate, suggesting a functional role in PARP activity. Instead of lysine, ART2 contains a valine (Val-155) in the Region II helix that is directed away from the catalytic glutamate; however, a glutamine (Gln-188) in the ARTT motif of ART2 does project an amide group toward the same region as the amide of Lys-903 of PARP (Fig. 1A). A methionine (Met-890) provides a hydrophobic cushion for the acceptor adenine in the PARP model. In ART2, the hydrophobic side chain of a phenylalanine (Phe-184) in the ARTT motif loop occupies a space comparable with that occupied by Met-890 of PARP. Multimeric Auto-ADP-ribosylation of Recombinant ART2— To determine whether ART2 could polymerize ADP-ribose from NAD, we generated recombinant ART2 with high specific activity (2.3 μmol/min/mg) (7Hara N. Tsuchiya M. Shimoyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29552-29555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 8Rigby M.R. Bortell R. Stevens L.A. Moss J. Kanaitsuka T. Shigeta H.

Purified ART2 appeared as a band at 28 kDa by SDS-PAGE and had auto-ADP-ribosyltransferase activity demonstrable by Western blot and autoradiography (data not shown). In a 6-min reaction, the extent of ART2 modification increased as the NAD concentration was increased from 0 to 10 mm, reaching a maximum at ∼7.5-10 mm NAD (Fig. 2A). The assay used concentrations of NAD comparable with intracellular concentrations (0.4-4 mm) (33Williams G.T. Lau K.M. Coote J.M. Johnstone A.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1985; 160: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 34Anderson R.M. Latorre-Esteves M. Neves A.R. Lavu S. Medvedik O. Taylor C. Howitz K.T. Santos H. Sinclair D.A. Science. 2003; 302: 2124-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The variable extent of auto-ADP-ribosylation over time (Fig. 2B) resulted in heterogeneous protein band shifts on SDS-PAGE that were comparable with band shifts reported in studies of PARP (30Shah G.M. Poirier D. Duchaine C. Brochu G. Desnoyers S. Lagueux J. Verreault A. Hoflack J.C. Kirkland J.B. Poirier G.G. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 227: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). ART2 Produces ADP-ribose Polymers—To determine whether the multiple ADP-ribose modifications were linked together as a polymer rather than monomers attached at multiple sites, radiolabeled ADP-ribose moieties were cleaved from the ART2 protein. After affinity purification, these moieties were resolved in a modified sequencing gel next to lanes containing radiolabeled PARP-generated polymers (Fig. 2C). Autoradiography showed that the ART2 sample contained ADP-ribose polymers that were 2-12 ADP-ribose residues in length and were similar to, but smaller than, those produced by PARP. Previous studies have shown that, under high-salt and alkaline conditions, NAD can be a highly reactive molecule that reacts non-enzymatically with ADP-ribose polymers and covalently attaches ADP-ribose (35Ikejima M. Gill D.M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5039-5045Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). To exclude the unlikely possibility of non-enzymatic ADP-ribosylation in our system, mono-ADP-ribosylated agmatine, ADP-ribose polymer, and auto-ADP-ribosylated cholera toxin, which is known to be mono-ADP-ribosylated at multiple sites (25Moss J. Stanley S.J. Watkins P.A. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7835-7837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were analyzed using the same conditions (Fig. 2C). There was no evidence of non-enzymatic formation of poly(ADP-ribose). Digestion of ART2 Polymers with Phosphodiesterase Produces PR-AMP—Additional evidence for the enzymatic generation of poly-ADP-ribose polymers by ART2 was obtained in snake venom phosphodiesterase (SVP) analyses. Digestion of PARP-generated ADP-ribose polymers with SVP generates two major products, 2′-O-α-d-ribosyladenosine 5′,5″-bisphosphate (PR-AMP) and AMP (1Sugimura T. Miwa M. Mol. Cell.

Expression of the chemokine IP-10 (interferon-γ-inducible protein) has been documented in several inflammatory and autoimmune disorders including type 1 diabetes. However, the mechanism of its expression in monocytes or its functional role in diabetes is not known. Advanced glycation end products acting via their receptor, RAGE, play major roles in diabetic complications. In this study, we observed for the first time that S100b, an inflammatory protein as well as a specific RAGE ligand, significantly increased IP-10 mRNA and protein levels in THP-1 monocytes as well as peripheral blood monocytes. Promoter luciferase assays showed that IP-10 mRNA accumulation by S100b was not via increased transcription. On the other hand, S100b significantly increased IP-10 mRNA half-life and stability. This appeared to be mediated by S100b-induced binding of specific RNA-binding protein(s) to a 3′-untranslated region-responsive region of the IP-10 mRNA. Our results demonstrate for the first time that diabetic stimuli such as RAGE ligands can induce inflammatory gene expression in monocytes via increased message stability."
https://openalex.org/W2101957829,"To understand protein sorting and quality control in the secretory pathway, we have analyzed intracellular trafficking of the yeast plasma membrane ATPase, Pma1. Pma1 is ideal for such studies because it is a very abundant polytopic membrane protein, and its localization and activity at the plasma membrane are essential for cell viability and growth. We have tested whether the cytoplasmic amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains of Pma1 carry sorting information. As the sole copy of Pma1, mutants truncated at either NH2 or COOH termini are targeted at least partially to the plasma membrane and have catalytic activity to sustain cell viability. The mutants are also delivered to degradative pathways. Strikingly, NH2- and COOH-terminal Pma1 mutants are differentially recognized for degradation at distinct cellular locales. COOH-terminal mutants are recognized for destruction by endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation. By contrast, NH2-terminal mutants escape detection by endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation entirely, and undergo endocytosis for vacuolar degradation after apparently normal cell surface targeting. Both NH2- and COOH-terminal mutants are conformationally abnormal, as revealed by increased sensitivity to tryptic cleavage, but are able to assemble to form oligomers. We propose that different quality control mechanisms may assess discrete domains of Pma1 rather than a global conformational state."
https://openalex.org/W1987883086,"The sigma(54) promoter specificity factor is distinct from other bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) sigma factors in that it forms a transcriptionally silent closed complex upon promoter binding. Transcriptional activation occurs through a nucleotide-dependent isomerization of sigma(54), mediated via its interactions with an enhancer-binding activator protein that utilizes the energy released in ATP hydrolysis to effect structural changes in sigma(54) and core RNA polymerase. The organization of sigma(54)-promoter and sigma(54)-RNAP-promoter complexes was investigated by fluorescence resonance energy transfer assays using sigma(54) single cysteine-mutants labeled with an acceptor fluorophore and donor fluorophore-labeled DNA sequences containing mismatches that mimic nifH early- and late-melted promoters. The results show that sigma(54) undergoes spatial rearrangements of functionally important domains upon closed complex formation. sigma(54) and sigma(54)-RNAP promoter complexes reconstituted with the different mismatched DNA constructs were assayed by the addition of the activator phage shock protein F in the presence or absence of ATP and of non-hydrolysable analogues. Nucleotide-dependent alterations in fluorescence resonance energy transfer efficiencies identify different functional states of the activator-sigma(54)-RNAP-promoter complex that exist throughout the mechano-chemical transduction pathway of transcriptional activation, i.e. from closed to open promoter complexes. The results suggest that open complex formation only occurs efficiently on replacement of a repressive fork junction with down-stream melted DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1990152556,"Deletion of Phe-508 (ΔF508) in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator causes cystic fibrosis because of misfolding of the protein. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) containing the equivalent mutation (ΔY490) is also misfolded but can be rescued with drug substrates. Whether rescue is due to direct binding of drug substrate to the transmembrane (TM) segments or to indirect effects on cellular protein folding pathways is still controversial. P-gp-drug substrate interactions likely involve hydrogen bonds. If the mechanism of drug rescue involves changes to TM packing then we should be able to identify suppressor mutations in the TM segments that can mimic the drug rescue effects. We predicted that an arginine residue in the TM segments predicted to line the drug-binding pocket of P-gp (I306(TM5) or F343(TM6)) might suppress ΔY490 P-gp protein misfolding because it has the highest propensity to form hydrogen bonds. We show that R306(TM5) or R343(TM6) increased the relative amount of mature ΔY490 P-gp by 6-fold. Most other changes to Ile-306 or Phe-343 did not enhance maturation of ΔY490 P-gp. The I306R mutant also promoted maturation of misprocessed mutants that had mutations in the second nucleotide-binding domain (L1260A), the cytoplasmic loops (G251V, F804A), the linker region (P709A), or in TM segments (G300V, G722A). These results show that arginine residues in the TM domains can mimic the drug rescue effects and are effective suppressor mutations for processing mutations located throughout the molecule.

Cystic Fibrosis (CF) 2The abbreviations used are: CF, cystic fibrosis; ABC, ATP-binding cassette; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; P-gp, P-glycoprotein; NBD, nucleotide-binding domain; HEK, human embryonic kidney; TM, transmembrane; TMD, transmembrane domain; PNGase F, peptide:N-glycosidase F. is a lethal inherited disorder caused by mutations in the gene coding for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein (1Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Plavsic N. Chou J.L. Drumm M.L. Iannuzzi M.C. Collins F.S. Tsui L.-C. Science. 1989; 245: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (5977) Google Scholar). The most common CF-associated mutation is deletion of Phe508 (ΔF508) in the first nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1) (2Bobadilla J.L. Macek Jr., M. Fine J.P. Farrell P.M. Hum. Mutat. 2002; 19: 575-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). The mutation causes protein misfolding. The misfolded protein is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and is rapidly degraded (3Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E.

Genet. 1992; 1: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The equivalent deletion in human P-glycoprotein (ΔY490) also leads to defective folding and rapid degradation (5Hoof T. Demmer A. Hadam M.R. Riordan J.R. Tummler B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20575-20583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of the ΔF508 mutation in CFTR has little effect on the conformation of NBD1, its in vitro stability, or folding kinetics (6Lewis H.A. Zhao X. Wang C. Sauder J.M. Rooney I. Noland B.W. Lorimer D. Kearins M.C. Conners K. Condon B. Maloney P.C. Guggino W.B. Hunt J.F. Emtage S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1346-1353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The primary effect of ΔF508 is disruption of NBD1-TMD1 interactions. In P-gp, the ΔY490 mutation also disrupts NBD1-TMD1 interactions (7Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27585-27588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Disruption of NBD1-TMD1 interactions then appears to disrupt subsequent interactions between TMD1 and TMD2 (8Chen E.Y. Bartlett M.C. Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39620-39627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 9Kleizen B. van Vlijmen T. de Jonge H.R. Braakman I. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). An important clinical goal in CF is to specifically correct the folding defect in ΔF508-CFTR as the mature protein still has cAMP-activated chloride channel activity (10Dalemans W. Barbry P. Champigny G. Jallat S. Dott K. Dreyer D. Crystal R.G. Pavirani A. Lecocq J.P. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1991; 354: 526-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Studies on the ΔY490 P-gp model system suggest that specific drug interactions with the TM segments can promote maturation of the mutant protein. Therefore, the results imply that the TM segments of ΔF508-CFTR would be a good target for the development of pharmacological chaperones. The mechanism of how pharmacological chaperones rescue folding defects in P-gp (11Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) is controversial because it is difficult to distinguish whether increased maturation was due to direct effects on TM packing (12Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14671-14674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) or due to indirect effects on cellular folding pathways. For example, stress-induced alterations in molecular chaperone levels (13Goldfarb S.B. Kashlan O.B. Watkins J.N. Suaud L. Yan W. Kleyman T.R. Rubenstein R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17369-17378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) could potentially promote maturation of ΔF508 CFTR or ΔY490 P-gp. Therefore, it is important to demonstrate that manipulation of the TM segments can promote folding of mutant proteins in the absence of potential stress-induced cell responses. In this study, we tested whether mutations introduced in the TM segments forming part of the drug-binding pocket could promote maturation of ΔY490 Pgp. Construction of Mutants—Two tagged versions of human P-gp were used in this study. A P-gp cDNA contained the epitope for monoclonal antibody A52 at the COOH-terminal end was used to distinguish the expressed protein from any endogenous P-gp (17Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7243-7248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second P-gp cDNA was modified to contain a 10-histidine tag at the COOH-terminal end to facilitate purification of the expressed protein by nickel-chelate chromatography (18Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced into wild-type P-gp cDNAs and ΔY490 P-gp cDNAs as described previously (7Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27585-27588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 19Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14049-14057Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The integrity of all the mutant cDNAs was confirmed by sequencing the entire cDNA (20Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). Expression and Detection of Mutants—The mutant P-gps were transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells in plain media as described previously (18Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Whole cell SDS extracts were subjected to immunoblot analysis with monoclonal antibody A52 (21Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28683-28689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Digestion with endoglycosidase H or peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) (New England Biolabs, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) and cell surface labeling of P-gp with biotin-LC-hydrazide (Invitrogen, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) were performed as described previously (21Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28683-28689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24759-24765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Purification of P-gp and Measurement of ATPase Activity—Histidine-tagged P-gp was expressed in HEK 293 cells and then isolated by nickel-chelate chromatography as described previously (18Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). A sample of the isolated histidine-tagged P-gp was mixed with an equal volume of 10 mg/ml sheep brain phosphatidylethanolamine (Type II-S, Sigma) that had been washed and suspended in Tris-buffered saline. The sample was sonicated and ATPase activity measured in the presence of various concentrations of verapamil or colchicine. Mutations in the TM segments, cytoplasmic loops connecting the TM segments, the two NBDs, and within the linker region connecting the two halves of P-gp inhibit maturation of the protein (processing mutations) (Fig. 1A). Residue Tyr-490 in P-gp is equivalent to Phe-508 in CFTR (5Hoof T. Demmer A. Hadam M.R. Riordan J.R. Tummler B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20575-20583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of Tyr-490 in P-gp also inhibits maturation of the protein (7Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27585-27588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These mutants can be rescued, however, by carrying out expression in the presence of a P-gp drug substrate such as cyclosporin A, vinblastine, or verapamil (11Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). We had proposed that drug substrates rescue misfolded P-gp mutants through interactions with the TM segments (12Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14671-14674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It is possible, however, that drug substrates have indirectly altered the general cellular protein pathways since the drug substrates can have pleiotropic effects on cells. If drug substrates can promote maturation of P-gp mutants (drug rescue) by occupation of the drug-binding site (where it acts as a scaffold during biosynthesis of the protein), then it should be possible to introduce suppressor mutations in the drug-binding pocket of P-gp that would mimic the drug rescue effects. Hydrophobic residues or residues that can form hydrogen bonds would be predicted to promote protein maturation since it has been postulated that drug substrate/P-gp interactions appear to be mediated by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding (23Ambudkar S.V. Kimchi-Sarfaty C. Sauna Z.E. Gottesman M.M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7468-7485Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). The number and strength of hydrogen bonds are important determinants of P-gp-drug substrate interactions (24Ecker G.F. Csaszar E. Kopp S. Plagens B. Holzer W. Ernst W. Chiba P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 25Omote H. Al-Shawi M.K. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 4046-4059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Residue I306(TM5) (Fig. 1A) was initially selected for mutational analysis because cysteine mutagenesis and thiol-labeling studies indicated that it lies within the drug-binding pocket of P-gp. It was found that modification of Cys-306 with a thiol-reactive analog of verapamil permanently activated the ATPase activity (26Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20449-20452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition, mutations to Ile-306 can decrease the affinity of P-gp for some substrates by up to 50-fold (27Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12081-12089Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Accordingly, mutations were made to Ile-306 in the ΔY490 P-gp. Residue Ile-306 was changed to a positively charged (Arg), a negatively charged (Glu), polar (Gln, Ser), a large non-polar residue (Trp), or to relatively small (Ala, Gly) residues. The mutants were expressed in HEK 293 cells and whole cell SDS extracts subjected to immunoblot analysis. Fig. 1B shows that very little (<10%) of the mature product (170 kDa) was present in cells transfected with mutant I306/ΔY490 P-gp cDNA. By contrast, the I306R mutation caused about a 6-fold increase in mature (170 kDa) protein. Smaller increases in the mature protein were observed with the I306Q (about 3-fold) and the I306W (about 2-fold) mutants. No increase in the amount of mature protein (170 kDa) was detected for mutants I306S, I306A, I306E, or I306G. These results show that introduction of an arginine at position I306 was the most efficient change that promoted maturation of mutant ΔY490 P-gp. We then tested whether the presence of an arginine at other positions in TM5 would promote maturation of mutant ΔY490 P-gp. An arginine residue was introduced at positions 304, 305, 307, or 308 in TM5 in the ΔY490 P-gp mutant. The mutants were expressed in HEK 293 cells and whole cell extracts subjected to immunoblot analysis. Fig. 1D shows that only the I306R mutation promoted maturation of the ΔY490 P-gp mutant. The next step was to test whether the most effective suppressor mutation (I306R) of ΔY490 P-gp could promote folding of other P-gp processing mutations. The I306R mutation was introduced into mutants containing a processing mutation in the TM segments (G300V in TM5, G722A in TM7), the loops connecting the TM segments (G251V in intracellular loop 2, F804A in intracellular loop 3), the linker region (P709A), and NBD2 (L1260A) (Fig. 1A). The mutants were expressed in HEK 293 cells and whole cell extracts were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Fig. 2A shows that I306R promoted maturation of all misprocessed mutants. The I306R mutation was more efficient, however, in promoting maturation of mutants G251V, G300V, P709A, and G722A than mutants F804A and L1260A. Mutants G251V and G251V/I306R were then subjected to endoglycosidase digestion to see if the increased amount of 170-kDa protein was mature P-gp. Fig. 2B shows that the immature 150-kDa protein of mutant G251V was sensitive to both endoglycosidase H and PNGase F. Similarly, the 150-kDa G251V/I306R mutant protein was also sensitive to digestion by both endoglycosidases. The 170-kDa mature protein of mutant G251V/I306R, however, was only sensitive to PNGase F. These results indicate that the 170-kDa protein must have exited the endoplasmic reticulum and traversed the Golgi apparatus. To determine whether the mature 170-kDa protein was at the cell surface, cells expressing A52-tagged mutant G251V or G251V/I306R were subjected to cell surface biotinylation with biotin-LC-hydrazide. The biotinylated P-gps were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody A52. The immunoprecipitated P-gps were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a sheet of nitrocellulose, and detected with streptavidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Fig. 2C shows that the mature 170-kDa protein was detected at the cell surface only in mutant G251V/I306R. Introduction of I306R into other processing mutants such as ΔY490 P-gp also increased cell surface expression of P-gp (data not shown). These results indicate that introduction of the I306R mutation results in increased expression of mature P-gp at the cell surface. The next step was to test whether introduction of an arginine mutation at another site in the drug-binding pocket would promote maturation of the ΔY490 P-gp mutant. A potential site would be Phe-343 in TM6. Residue Phe-343 also lines the drug-binding pocket because mutant F343C could be labeled with the thiol-reactive drug substrate methanethiosulfonate-rhodamine to activate P-gp ATPase activity (28Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50136-50141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Accordingly, ΔY490-P-gp mutants were constructed in which Phe-343 was replaced with Trp, Arg, Ala, Ser, Tyr, Gly, Asn, Ile, or Asp. The mutants were expressed in HEK 293 cells and whole cell extracts were subjected to immunoblot analysis, Fig. 3A shows that introduction of an Arg mutation at position 343 significantly increased (about 6-fold) the amount of mature P-gp compared with mutant F343/ΔY490 P-gp. Increased maturation efficiency was also observed in mutant F343N (about 3-fold), while smaller increases (1.5–2-fold) were observed with Trp or Tyr. Although mutant F343Y showed a small increase in the relative amount of mature protein, it also promoted degradation of the protein (seen as a product of about 130 kDa). The 130-kDa protein appears to be a degradation product that is found with P-gp mutants with mutations in TM6 (29Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32373-32376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To further test whether Phe-343 does reside within the drug-binding pocket of P-gp, we determined whether the F343R mutation altered the affinity of wild-type P-gp for substrates. Interaction of purified P-gp with drug substrates such as verapamil and colchicine can be monitored by stimulation of ATPase activity. Wild-type P-gp showed about a 21-fold maximal activation with verapamil with half-maximal activation (A50) at 46 μm verapamil (supplemental Fig. 1). The mutant F343R showed a marked reduction (69%) in maximal activity and a 21-fold decrease in apparent affinity for verapamil (A50 of 960 μm) (data not shown). The mutant also showed about a 70% reduction in maximal colchicine-stimulated ATPase activity compared with wild-type P-gp but no significant change in apparent affinity (A50 of about 1 mm for wild-type and mutant F343R). Therefore, the F343R mutation appears to reduce P-gp/verapamil interactions as well as coupling of colchicine or verapamil binding to stimulation of ATPase activity. Previous studies on mutant F343C by disulfide cross-linking analysis (30Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31800-31805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) or fluorescence labeling (31Rothnie A. Storm J. Campbell J. Linton K.J. Kerr I.D. Callaghan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34913-34921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) have shown that Phe-343 is involved in conformational changes associated with coupling of drug binding to ATP hydrolysis. Since the I306R and F343R mutations were the most efficient changes that promoted maturation of the ΔY490 P-gp, we then tested whether the presence of both mutations would have an additive effect. Arginine residues were introduced at positions 306 and 343 in the ΔY490 P-gp mutant and the I306R/F343R ΔY490 P-gp mutant was expressed in HEK 293 cells. Whole cell SDS extracts were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Fig. 3C shows introduction of two arginine residues in different TMs of ΔY490 P-gp increased the yield of mature enzyme (8.8-fold in mutant I306R/F343R ΔY490 P-gp versus 6–6.3-fold in mutants I306R/ΔY490 P-gp or F343R/ΔY490 P-gp). The results show that introduction of arginine mutations into the TM segments can suppress folding defects caused by processing mutations located throughout P-gp. An implication of the results is that the TM segments are ideal targets for pharmacological chaperones to promote folding of misfolded membrane proteins such as P-gp and CFTR. The TM segments may be particularly sensitive to the effects of processing mutations because packing of the TM segments may be the last step in the folding of ABC transporters (9Kleizen B. van Vlijmen T. de Jonge H.R.

In vitro translation studies on CFTR with semipermeabilized cells in combination with limited proteolysis revealed that the cytosolic domains acquired their structures cotranslationally whereas post-translational folding only involved the TM domains (9Kleizen B. van Vlijmen T. de Jonge H.R. Braakman I. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Mutations such as ΔY490 in P-gp and ΔF508 in CFTR appear to interfere with post-translational folding of the proteins by disrupting NBD1-TMD1 interactions that are required for subsequent TMD1 and TMD2 interactions (6Lewis H.A. Zhao X. Wang C. Sauder J.M. Rooney I. Noland B.W. Lorimer D. Kearins M.C. Conners K. Condon B. Maloney P.C. Guggino W.B. Hunt J.F. Emtage S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 39620-39627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Maturation of the ΔY490 P-gp mutant was promoted by introducing mutations into the TM segments forming the drug-binding pocket. An arginine at positions 306(TM5) or 343(TM6) acted as the most effective suppressor mutation. The ability of an arginine residue in a TM segment to promote protein folding may be unexpected because it has been reported that the most common disease-causing mutation in membrane proteins is due to the presence of arginine in the TM segments (32Partridge A.W. Therien A.G. Deber C.M. Proteins. 2004; 54: 648-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Arginine in the TM segments may promote maturation of P-gp processing mutants because its side chain contains three polar atoms and therefore has the potential to form three H-bonds with other TM segments. It is unlikely that the introduced arginine residues form ionic interactions with acidic groups because there are no Glu or Asp residues in the TMs of P-gp. The ability of arginine in the TM segments to form a H-bonded network between the TM segments has been reported for bovine rhodopsin (32Partridge A.W. Therien A.G. Deber C.M. Proteins. 2004; 54: 648-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 33Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar). Since there is evidence that drug substrates promote interactions between the two TMDs of P-gp (12Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14671-14674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we would predict that the I306R or F343R mutations also promote interactions between the TMDs through H-bond formation. Fig. 4 shows a model of ΔY490 P-gp folding. The NBDs would fold cotranslationally but the presence of the ΔY490 mutation interferes with formation of the NBD1-TMD1 contacts. This in turn would disrupt proper packing of the TM segments (Fig. 4A) resulting in a protein that is trapped in a prefolded and inactive conformation (34Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1724-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The presence of drug substrate (Fig. 4B) or I306R or F343R mutations (Fig. 4C) would promote post-translational packing of the TM segments. A reason that the drug substrates are better than arginine at promoting maturation of ΔY490 P-gp (>10-fold increase in mature protein with cyclosporin A (11Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar)) could be due to the larger number of contacts (or H-bonds) that drug substrates could make with the TM segments (25Omote H. Al-Shawi M.K. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 4046-4059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) compared with an arginine side chain. Therefore, drug substrates would be better as scaffolds for stabilizing the mutant intermediate during biosynthesis than arginine. Another possible explanation for the observed results is that the introduced arginines mimic low temperature rescue by simply slowing protein folding to allow for the system to sample different folding pathways. It appears, however, that different mechanisms must operate during rescue by the introduced arginines compared with rescue by low temperature incubation. This is supported by the observation that maturation of mutant G251V is temperature-insensitive (very little mature P-gp is detected after expression for 48 h at 26 °C) (17Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7243-7248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but introduction of the I306R mutation caused about an 8-fold increase in mature P-gp (Fig. 3). In addition, the I306R mutation did not slow folding of wild-type P-gp (27Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12081-12089Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Similar results were observed with mutant F343R in the wild-type background (data not shown). In summary, the results show that arginines in the TM segments are effective suppressor mutations that mimic the drug rescue effects and can promote maturation of a mutant ABC transporter that has a processing mutation in any domain of the molecule.

https://openalex.org/W1981002981,"Electrons utilized in the heme oxygenase (HO) reaction are provided by NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR). To investigate the electron transfer pathway from CPR to HO, we examined the reactions of heme and verdoheme, the second intermediate in the heme degradation, complexed with rat HO-1 (rHO-1) using a rat FMN-depleted CPR; the FMN-depleted CPR was prepared by dialyzing the CPR mutant, Y140A/Y178A, against 2 m KBr. Degradation of heme in complex with rHO-1 did not occur with FMN-depleted CPR, notwithstanding that the FMN-depleted CPR was able to associate with the heme-rHO-1 complex with a binding affinity comparable with that of the wild-type CPR. Thus, the first electron to reduce the ferric iron of heme complexed with rHO-1 must be transferred from FMN. In contrast, verdoheme was converted to the ferric biliverdin-iron chelate with FMN-depleted CPR, and this conversion was inhibited by ferricyanide, indicating that electrons are certainly required for conversion of verdoheme to a ferric biliverdin-iron chelate and that they can be supplied from the FMN-depleted CPR through a pathway not involving FMN, probably via FAD. This conclusion was supported by the observation that verdoheme dimethyl esters were accumulated in the reaction of the ferriprotoporphyrin IX dimethyl ester-rHO-1 complex with the wild-type CPR. Ferric biliverdin-iron chelate, generated with the FMN-depleted CPR, was converted to biliverdin by the addition of the wild-type CPR or desferrioxamine. Thus, the final electron for reducing ferric biliverdin-iron chelate to release ferrous iron and biliverdin is apparently provided by the FMN of CPR."
https://openalex.org/W1980129149,"It was previously shown that ALA1, the only alanyl-tRNA synthetase gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, codes for two functionally exclusive protein isoforms through alternative initiation at two consecutive ACG codons and an in-frame downstream AUG. We reported here the cloning and characterization of a homologous gene from Candida albicans. Functional assays show that this gene can substitute for both the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial functions of ALA1 in S. cerevisiae and codes for two distinct protein isoforms through alternative initiation from two in-frame AUG triplets 8-codons apart. Unexpectedly, although the short form acts exclusively in cytoplasm, the longer form provides function in both compartments. Similar observations are made in fractionation assays. Thus, the alanyl-tRNA synthetase gene of C. albicans has evolved an unusual pattern of translation initiation and protein partitioning and codes for protein isoforms that can aminoacylate isoaccepting tRNAs from a different species and from across cellular compartments."

Recent structural and biochemical studies of Fpg-DNA and hOgg1-DNA complexes point to the existence of extensive interactions between phosphate groups and amino acids. However, the role of these contacts and their physiological relevance remains unclear. In the present study, we combined chemical cross-linking and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI/MS/MS) approaches to identify interacting residues in the Fpg-DNA and hOgg1-DNA complexes. The active centers of Fpg and hOgg1 were cross-linked with a series of reactive oligonucleotide duplexes containing both a single 8-oxoG residue and an O-ethyl-substituted pyrophosphate internucleotide (SPI) group at different positions in duplex DNA. The cross-linking efficiency reached 50% for Fpg and 30% for hOgg1. We have identified seven phosphate groups on both strands of the DNA duplex specifically interacting with nucleophilic amino acids in Fpg, and eight in hOgg1.

Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4272) Google Scholar). 8-OxoG is a miscoding lesion, because it pairs preferentially with adenine instead of cytosine and induces G·C → T·A transversions in vivo and in vitro (5Shibutani S. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Nature. 1991; 349: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (2023) Google Scholar, 6Moriya M. Ou C. Bodepudi V. Johnson F. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Mutat. Res. 1991; 254: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Thus the Fpg and hOgg1 DNA glycosylases are important in prevention of the mutagenic effects of 8-oxoG residues present in DNA and maintenance of genome integrity.To date, most studies have focused on the interactions of Fpg and hOgg1 with oxidized bases, and little attention has been paid to contacts with phosphate groups in damaged DNA. However, it is evident that interactions of the DNA glycosylases with DNA phosphate groups are critical for the target search along DNA and base lesion recognition. It has been shown that the interaction of Fpg and hOgg1 with damaged DNA causes significant conformational changes in helix structure, such as partial denaturation, widening of the minor groove, sharp kinking of the DNA backbone at the lesion site, and flipping-out of the oxidized base from the DNA duplex (7Gilboa R. Zharkov D.O. Golan G. Fernandes A.S. Gerchman S.E. Matz E. Kycia J.H. Grollman A.P. Shoham G. J. Biol.

Nature. 2000; 403: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). Such enzyme-induced changes in DNA duplex structure occur mostly through specific contacts between amino acids in the active centers of Fpg and hOgg1, on the one hand, and DNA phosphate groups in the specific protein-DNA complexes, on the other (9Zharkov D.O. Ishchenko A.A. Douglas K.T. Nevinsky G.A. Mutat. Res. 2003; 531: 141-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 10Kirpota O.O. Zharkov D.O. Buneva V.N. Nevinsky G.A. Mol. Biol. (Mosc.). 2006; 5: 512-523Google Scholar). In contrast to the nonspecific weak interactions of Fpg and hOgg1 with phosphates found in non-damaged DNA, complex formation between DNA glycosylase and damaged DNA takes on a cooperative character and involves separate directly interacting groups (9Zharkov D.O. Ishchenko A.A. Douglas K.T. Nevinsky G.A. Mutat. Res. 2003; 531: 141-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 10Kirpota O.O. Zharkov D.O. Buneva V.N. Nevinsky G.A. Mol. Biol. (Mosc.). 2006; 5: 512-523Google Scholar). However, detailed study of such interactions has not yet been carried out.In this work, we examined specific contacts between DNA phosphate groups and nucleophilic amino acids of Fpg and hOgg1 in the specific enzyme-substrate complexes, under physiological conditions, using combined cross-linking and proteomic approaches. Chemical cross-linking is widely used to study protein-DNA interactions. The method provides information about the geometry of the contacts and the binding centers of the interacting molecules, and also allows identification of single atoms or groups of atoms involved in the specific interaction in aqueous solutions (11Wong S.S. Chemistry of Protein Conjugation and Cross-linking. 1st Ed. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991Google Scholar). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) is a technique that has been used in cross-linking studies for peptide identification and sequencing (12Back J.W. de Jong L. Muijsers A.O. de Koster C.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The principal advantage of ESI-MS is an ability to accurately determine the masses of molecules analyzed in a complex mixture. The ability of most modern mass spectrometers to fragment parent ions (MS/MS) provides highly reliable information on their identity. In this work, we present two alternative strategies combining cross-linking and ESI/MS/MS to identify the amino acids of 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylases interacting with DNA phosphate groups under physiological conditions. The role of phosphate-protein contacts in substrate recognition is also discussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESOligonucleotides—Oligonucleotide DNA duplexes I–XI used in this study are shown in Fig. 1. The 8-oxoG residue was introduced into the oligonucleotides by a standard phosphoramidite procedure using an Applied Biosystems 380B DNA synthesizer and commercially available 3′-phosphoramidite of modified 2′-deoxyguanosine (Glenn Research, Sterling, VA). Modified oligonucleotides containing internucleotide SPI groups at the positions indicated by arrows in Fig. 1A were made by template-directed chemical ligation as described (13Kuznetsova S. Rykhlevskaya A. Taranenko M. Sidorkina O. Oretskaya T. Laval J. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, equimolar amounts of the O-ethyl-substituted 3′-phosphate upstream oligonucleotide, the 5′-[32P]phosphate downstream oligonucleotide to be ligated, and a complementary 22-mer oligonucleotide used as a template to appose the two phosphate groups (the total oligonucleotide concentration was 10–3 m), dissolved in 20 μl of buffer A containing 0.05 m MES-HCl (pH 6.0), 0.02 m MgCl2, were heated to 80 °C for 2 min and slowly cooled. The mixture thus obtained was treated with 0.2 m water-soluble carbodiimide for 72 h at 10 °C in the dark. Ligation products carrying a pOC2H5-[32P]phosphate-substituted pyrophosphate group at the ligation site (Fig. 1A) were isolated by electrophoresis on a 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea, followed by elution with 2 m LiClO4 and precipitation with 5 volumes of acetone. Ligation efficiency was dependent on the nature of nucleotides at the ligation site and varied between 12 and 60%. The influence of the nature of nucleotides at the ligation site on the ligation efficiency was noted earlier (13Kuznetsova S. Rykhlevskaya A. Taranenko M. Sidorkina O. Oretskaya T. Laval J. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 14Kuznetsova S.A. Clusel C. Ugarte E. Elias I. Vasseur M. Blumenfeld M. Shabarova Z.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4783-4790Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).The SPI-containing oligonucleotide of DNA duplex IV used for mass spectrometry experiments was synthesized on a preparative scale. 20 nmol of the oligonucleotide with 5′-phosphate, 20 nmol of the oligonucleotide with 3′-ethylphosphate, and 22 nmol of the DNA template oligonucleotide in 50 μl of buffer A were annealed as described above. Carbodiimide (5 mg) was added and the solution was thoroughly vortexed and incubated at 10 °C for 72 h. SPI-containing oligonucleotide was isolated by electrophoresis on a 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea. The gel was examined by UV shadowing, the bands corresponding to the ligation product were excised, and the oligonucleotide was recovered by passive elution at room temperature as described above.All oligonucleotides were tested by HPLC and, if necessary, purified by HPLC or denaturing 20% PAGE. Oligonucleotides were 5′-32P-labeled as described (15Gros L. Ishchenko A.A. Ide H. Elder R.H. Saparbaev M.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). DNA duplexes I–XI were obtained by annealing (heating to 40 °C for 2 min and slow cooling) the respective SPI-containing oligonucleotides with an equimolar amount of the complementary strand. The reactivity of these modified duplexes was confirmed as described earlier (16Shabarova Z.A. Sheflyan G.Y. Kuznetsova S.A. Kubareva E.A. Sysoev O.H. Ivanovskaya M.G. Gromova E.S. Bioorg. Khim. 1994; 20: 413-419PubMed Google Scholar). DNA duplexes I–XI were selectively cleaved under the action of aqueous solutions of N-MeIm or ethylenediamine at pH 8.0 according to the mechanism of nucleophilic substitution at the phosphorus atom as was determined previously (16Shabarova Z.A. Sheflyan G.Y. Kuznetsova S.A. Kubareva E.A. Sysoev O.H. Ivanovskaya M.G. Gromova E.S. Bioorg. Khim. 1994; 20: 413-419PubMed Google Scholar). DNA duplex XII contained no internal SPI groups.Protein Preparation—The non-labeled wild-type and mutant Fpg and hOgg1 proteins were purified as previously described (17Boiteux S. O'Connor T.R. Lederer F. Gouyette A. Laval J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3916-3922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Rogacheva M.V. Saparbaev M.K. Afanasov I.M. Kuznetsova S.A. Biochimie (Paris). 2005; 87: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In the present work, to facilitate MS data manipulation, the amino acid sequence of the Fpg protein was numbered beginning from P1, E2... Lys56 etc. Site-directed mutations R53G, R54G, K56R, and K56G within the Fpg coding sequence in pFPG220 were generated by a site-directed mutagenesis kit (QuikChange® XL, Stratagene) as described (19Sidorkina O.M. Laval J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5351-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 20Sidorkina O.M. Laval J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9924-9929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To obtain stable isotope-labeled DNA glycosylases, the cDNAs of Fpg and hOgg1 were cloned into vectors pET11a and pET28c(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI), respectively, and transformed into the E. coli strain Rosetta (DE3) (Invitrogen SARL, Gergy Pontoise, France). M9 medium, containing either 14NH4Cl or 15NH4Cl supplemented with 50 μg/ml of appropriate antibiotics was inoculated with overnight culture and incubated at 18 °C until A600 nm = 1.0. At this point, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and the proteins were overproduced for 6 h at 37°C. Homogeneity of the protein preparations was verified by SDS-PAGE.Chemical Cross-linking—Sample manipulations for mass spectrometry analyses were performed in methanol-washed tubes to reduce polymer contamination. Chemical cross-linking of Fpg and hOgg1 to modified oligonucleotide duplexes I–X was performed on both analytical and preparative scales. For analytical scale cross-linking, 1–10 nm Fpg and 10–100 nm hOgg1 were incubated with 2–20 fmol of oligonucleotide duplexes in 20 μl of buffer B containing 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm Na2EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 6% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.05 m N-methylimidazole (N-MeIm) for 14 h at 0, 22, or 37 °C unless otherwise stated. In all DNA duplexes only the disubstituted phosphate group of the modified pyrophosphate residue was 32P-labeled (Fig. 1A). Reaction mixtures were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel after heating samples in 0.1% SDS, 1 m 2-mercaptoethanol solution at 95 °C. Gels were exposed to a Fuji FLA-3000 PhosphorScreen and analyzed using Image Gauge version 3.12 software. Cross-linking efficiency was determined as the ratio of the amount of DNA-enzyme covalent complex to the total amount of the DNA (conjugate plus unbound DNA).In the preparative scale experiment, 42.5 μm Fpg or 50 μm hOgg1 were incubated with 20 μm oligonucleotide duplex IV spiked with 32P-labeled DNA in 40 μl of buffer B without bovine serum albumin for 16 h at 37 °C. A small amount of the reaction mixture was separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and radio-activity was quantified by phosphorimaging. The yields of Fpg-DNA and hOgg1-DNA heteroconjugates were about 50 and 30%, respectively. Cross-linked Fpg and hOgg1 were separated from free proteins by 12% SDS-PAGE and stained with Sypro-Red and colloidal Coomassie G-250, respectively.Isolation of Oligonucleotide-hOgg1 Peptide Conjugate—Approximately 20 pmol each of free and cross-linked hOgg1 proteins were cut from the stained preparative gel. The gel slices were minced to cubes of about 1 mm3 and washed three times with 300 μl of 0.1 m NH4HCO3, 50% acetonitrile at 25 °C for 5 min in 1.5-ml tubes. Gel slices were first dried in 100% acetonitrile for 15 min and then in a SpeedVac for 10 min; they were next allowed to swell in 300 μl of freshly prepared 0.1 m NH4HCO3, 10 mm dithiothreitol at 56 °C for 1 h without shaking. The supernatant was discarded, and the proteins were alkylated in-gel in 300 μl of 55 mm iodoacetamide, 0.1 m NH4HCO3 at room temperature for 45 min in the dark (briefly mixed every 10 min). After alkylation, gel slices were washed and dried as described above.For trypsin digestion, gel slices were re-hydrated in 25 mm NH4HCO3, 1 mm CaCl2, preincubated on ice for 15 min, and incubated with trypsin (Promega France, Charbonnieres) at a w/w ratio of 1:20 (trypsin:hOgg1) at 37 °C for 16 h. To extract the residual peptides, gel slices were washed in 25 μl of 25 mm NH4HCO3 at 25 °C by shaking at 1400 rpm for 10 min. Supernatant was removed, and gel slices were washed twice with 25 μl of 0.1% formic acid and 50% acetonitrile at 25 °C by shaking at 1400 rpm for 10 min. All the supernatants containing peptides were pooled together and concentrated to 10 μl for mass spectrometry experiments.Isolation of Oligonucleotide-Fpg Peptide Conjugate—After preparative cross-linking, the reaction mixture was denatured in 0.1% SDS at 95 °C for 2 min, cooled to room temperature, and incubated on ice for 10 min. Proteolytic digestion was performed by the addition of chymotrypsin at a ratio of 1:20 (w/w) for protease:protein. Aliquots of the digestion mixture were analyzed on 12% denaturing PAGE gels (0.5 × TBE, 2 m urea) to ensure complete digestion. Afterward, the sample was loaded onto a 0.5-ml column packed with Q-Sepharose Fast Flow resin (Amersham Biosciences). The column was sequentially washed with 0.2 m NaCl, 0.4 m NaCl, and 1 m NH4HCO3 to remove peptides that were not cross-linked to DNA. The retained material, comprising unreacted oligonucleotides and peptide-oligonucleotide conjugates, was eluted with 2 m NH4HCO3 and then incubated at 95 °C and dried in a SpeedVac concentrator to desalt the sample. Selective cleavage of the phosphoroamide linkage in the heteroconjugate was achieved by treatment with 5% formic acid at room temperature for 30 min.Mass Spectrometry—The peptide mixtures obtained after protease digestions were analyzed by nano-HPLC (LC Packing) directly coupled to an ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan LCQ Deca XP) equipped with a nanoelectrospray source. The mass spectrometer was run in several different modes. For peptide identification, the ion trap acquired successive sets of 4 scan modes consisting of: full scan MS over the ranges of 200–2000 m/z, followed by 3 data-dependent MS/MS scans of the 3 most abundant ions in the full scan. The MS/MS spectra were acquired with a relative collision energy of 35% and exclusion width of 2.0 Da. The spectra were interpreted with the Bioworks software package. Alternatively, for confirmation and quantification of the presence of a particular peptide in the sample, the ion trap was set in a SRM mode. The quantity of the corresponding peptides was estimated by the peak intensity. For the stable isotope experiments, the mass spectrometer was set in a Zoom scan mode to target the area that covers masses of candidate peptides and the isotope-labeled controls. Comparison of experimentally obtained molecular masses of the peptides with theoretically possible peptides formed during trypsin digestion of hOgg1 and chymotrypsin digestion of the Fpg protein was carried out using the program PeptMass.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay and Determination of the Apparent Dissociation Constants (KD)—The assay mixture (20 μl final volume) contained 32P-labeled DNA duplex IV at a concentration of 20 pm and Fpg proteins (0.1–12 nm wild-type Fpg or 1–30 nm FpgK56R, or 1–150 nm FpgK56G, Fpg R53G, or FpgR54G) in buffer B without N-MeIm. The reactions were performed at 0 °C for 10 min and immediately loaded onto pre-run non-denaturing 10% PAGE gels as described (21Castaing B. Boiteux S. Zelwer C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 22Castaing B. Geiger A. Seliger H. Nehls P. Laval J. Zelwer C. Boiteux S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2899-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Gel electrophoresis was carried out at 4 °C for 1.5 h. Gels were exposed and analyzed as described above. Binding efficiency was determined as the ratio of the amount of protein-DNA complex to the total amount of DNA (bound and unbound). Assuming that the complexes contained one enzyme molecule per molecule of DNA, the apparent dissociation constant (KD) can be calculated from the concentrations of free protein ([E]), free DNA (f), and bound protein-DNA complex (1-f) at equilibrium: KD = [E] × f/(1-f). If the total concentration of protein [E]0 is close to that of the free protein at equilibrium, KD = [E]0 when 50% of the DNA is bound by the enzyme (21Castaing B. Boiteux S. Zelwer C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 22Castaing B. Geiger A. Seliger H. Nehls P. Laval J. Zelwer C. Boiteux S.

Rykhlevskaya A. Taranenko M. Sidorkina O. Oretskaya T. Laval J. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We established previously that nucleic acid fragments containing an SPI group are easily and quantitatively cleaved by primary and secondary amines, including nucleophilic amino acids (16Shabarova Z.A. Sheflyan G.Y. Kuznetsova S.A. Kubareva E.A. Sysoev O.H. Ivanovskaya M.G. Gromova E.S. Bioorg. Khim. 1994; 20: 413-419PubMed Google Scholar, 23Naryshkin N.A. Farrow M.A. Ivanovskaya M.G. Oretskaya T.S. Shabarova Z.A. Gait M.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3496-3505Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The reaction mechanism involves nucleophilic attack at the disubstituted phosphorous atom of the SPI group and elimination of an oligonucleotide remnant that contains the 3′-O-ethylphosphate derived from the modified phosphate of the pyrophosphate linkage (Fig. 1B). The cleavage of the modified group is accompanied by a transfer of the nucleic acid fragment onto the amine or amino acid. As a result, a phosphoamide (P-N) bond is formed. Nucleic acid fragments containing an SPI group may be regarded as phosphorylating reagents, acting on the nucleophil and covalently modifying it with a segment of oligonucleotide from the original DNA or RNA. The selective attack of the nucleophil on the disubstituted phosphorous atom of an SPI group can be explained by the stability of the eliminated group (monoanionphosphate is more stable (pKa ∼ 1), than bianionphosphate (pKa ∼ 6)) and by a greater steric accessibility of the flipped-out disubstituted phosphate versus the trisubstituted phosphate of the SPI group. 3M. V. Rogacheva, A. V. Bochenkova, S. A. Kuznetsova, and A. V. Nemukhin, unpublished observations. Phosphoamide covalent bonds are stable in alkaline solution (0.1 m NaOH), but are hydrolyzed by treatment with acids (0.1 m HCl, 15% CH3COOH) (24Purmal A.A. Shabarova Z.A. Gumport R.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3713-3719Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Importantly, the covalent bond between a DNA phosphate group and a histidine is cleaved by treatment with N-MeIm, whereas the bond between DNA phosphate and other nucleophilic amino acids is stable under these conditions (25Rudakova E.A. Ivanovskaya M.G. Kozlov M.V. Khoretonenko M.V. Oretskaya T.S. Nikiforov V.G. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2000; 65: 640-650PubMed Google Scholar). We also have established that DNA duplexes bearing SPI groups can cross-link with nucleophilic amino acids from DNA-binding enzymes situated within the DNA interface under near-physiological conditions (16Shabarova Z.A. Sheflyan G.Y. Kuznetsova S.A. Kubareva E.A. Sysoev O.H. Ivanovskaya M.G. Gromova E.S. Bioorg. Khim. 1994; 20: 413-419PubMed Google Scholar, 23Naryshkin N.A. Farrow M.A. Ivanovskaya M.G.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that Fpg can cover six nucleotides on the damaged strand and also make contacts with the complementary strand (27Castaing B. Fourrey J.L. Hervouet N. Thomas M. Boiteux S. Zelwer C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 608-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We introduced single reactive SPI groups within an 8-oxoG-containing hexanucleotide sequence in the lesion-containing strand and at four positions of the opposite complementary strand.Modeling of oligonucleotide duplex containing an SPI group using a combined quantum mechanical-molecular mechanical approach has revealed that stacking and Watson-Crick interactions between base pairs flanking the SPI group were not significantly affected.3 Interestingly, the SPI group fits into the helix structure without elongation of the internucleotide distance, due to flipping out of the bi-substituted phosphate. The bi-substituted and tri-substituted phosphorus atoms of an SPI group are situated with respect to the native phosphorus atom of analogous non-modified duplex DNA, at distances of about 2.3 and 1.3 Å, respectively.3Chemical Cross-linking of DNA Duplexes Containing O-Ethyl-substituted Pyrophosphate Groups to the Fpg and hOgg1 Proteins—Oligonucleotide duplexes I–X structurally resemble the natural substrates of Fpg and hOgg1. Indeed, we have shown that both of these DNA glycosylases recognize and specifically bind to DNA duplexes with identical nucleotide sequences but bearing SPI groups at various positions (13Kuznetsova S. Rykhlevskaya A. Taranenko M. Sidorkina O. Oretskaya T. Laval J. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 16Shabarova Z.A. Sheflyan G.Y. Kuznetsova S.A. Kubareva E.A. Sysoev O.H. Ivanovskaya M.G. Gromova E.S. Bioorg. Khim. 1994; 20: 413-419PubMed Google Scholar). To probe specific contacts between DNA phosphate groups and the proteins we used a chemical cross-linking approach. Reactions were carried out according to the scheme shown in Fig. 1B. The enzymes were incubated with internally labeled DNA duplexes I–X in the buffer used for measuring DNA glycosylase activity. To optimize formation of the enzyme-substrate complex, we varied temperature, time of incubation, and concentration of reagents in the reaction mixture. It was shown previously that the addition of N-MeIm can lead to an increase in cross-linking efficiency (24Purmal A.A. Shabarova Z.A. Gumport R.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3713-3719Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Therefore, the incubations were carried out in the presence or absence of N-MeIm. Optimal cross-linking conditions were found to be: 50 pm DNA duplex, 10 nm Fpg, 50 nm hOgg1, and 14-h reaction time. Maximum cross-linking efficiency of Fpg to all tested DNA duplexes, except IV and V, was achieved at 22 °C. Because DNA duplexes IV and V are non-cleavable substrate analogs, the maximum yield of protein cross-linking with these duplexes was obtained at 37 °C. In contrast with Fpg, maximum cross-linking efficiency of hOgg1 to all tested DNA duplexes, except III, was achieved at 37 °C. After covalent bond formation, the reaction mixtures were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 1C and Table 1, 7 and 8 phosphate groups in both strands of the oligonucleotide duplexes form covalent bonds with the Fpg and hOgg1 proteins, respectively. In both enzymes, the amino acids contact P2, P0, P–1, P–2, and P–3 phosphates in the 8-oxoG-containing strand and P(–1) phosphate in the complementary strand. In addition, hOgg1 covalently interacts with the P1 and P(–3) phosphate groups, and Fpg with the P(–2) phosphate.TABLE 1Cross-linking efficiency of the DNA phosphate group to the E. coli Fpg and human hOgg1 proteinsDNA duplexIIIIIIIVVVIVIIVIIIIXXXIProteinP2P1P0P-1P-2P-3P(0)P(-1)P(-2)P(-3)P-1Fpg30%0%10%50%35%18%0%20%22%0%0%22 °C22 °C37 °C37 °C22 °C22 °C22 °C+MeIm+MeIm+MeIm+MeIm+MeIm+MeIm+MeImhOgg16%10%15%30%15%8%0%25%0%7%0%37 °C37 °C22 °C37 °C37 °C37 °C37 °C37 °C+MeIm-MeIm-MeIm+MeIm-MeIm-MeIm-MeIm+MeIm Open ta"
