Of the many varieties of liquid and solid media tested, we have finally adopted the following : Autolysed yeast extract 0.25 percent Glucose 0.5 percent Distilled water to 100 ml. The reaction adjusted to a pH of 6.0 to 7.0. Increasing the yeast extract content of the media beyond 0.25 percent leads to a reduction in antibiotic production."

From this observation Fischbeck1 concluded that iron, not oxygen, migrates through the reaction product. Starting from this fact, we have worked out the following simple method for ascertaining the direction of migration in reactions between solid substances."

Jacobson and Williams2 have suggested the use of splenectomized rabbits for the assessment of anti-anæmic factors, and Bavin and Middleton3 have shown that thymine causes a reticulocytosis when injected into such splenectomized rabbits. We have used a similar method for the study of the hæmopoietic activity of various thymine derivatives."

Since that time, the ticks have been reared to maturity and the following results obtained."

https://openalex.org/W4239412530,DR. MELLANBY'S communication in Nature of October 19 describes an investigation in progress on the reactions of different individuals to mosquito bites. These investigations could provide an opportunity to test another matter which might lead to results of far-reaching importance.

https://openalex.org/W1991774981,"FROM exploratory surveys of the production of bacteriostatic substances by wood-rotting fungi both in Great Britain and in the United States, it appears that the authors, Wilkins1 and Bobbins et al.2, have tested the antibacterial activity of the metabolism-solution periodically up to a maximum of 30 days and 22 days respectively, and that their test-organisms have always been Bacterium coli and Staphylococcus aureus. On the basis of my experiences stated below, I suggest that : (1) this period of test should be extended, and that (2) some other organisms should also be employed as test-organisms from time to time."
