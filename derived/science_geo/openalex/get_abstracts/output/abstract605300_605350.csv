https://openalex.org/W2788797941,"Though motor neurons selectively degenerate in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, other cell types are likely involved in this disease. We recently generated rNLS8 mice in which human TDP-43 (hTDP-43) pathology could be reversibly induced in neurons and expected that microglia would contribute to neurodegeneration. However, only subtle microglial changes were detected during disease in the spinal cord, despite progressive motor neuron loss; microglia still reacted to inflammatory triggers in these mice. Notably, after hTDP-43 expression was suppressed, microglia dramatically proliferated and changed their morphology and gene expression profiles. These abundant, reactive microglia selectively cleared neuronal hTDP-43. Finally, when microgliosis was blocked during the early recovery phase using PLX3397, a CSF1R and c-kit inhibitor, rNLS8 mice failed to regain full motor function, revealing an important neuroprotective role for microglia. Therefore, reactive microglia exert neuroprotective functions in this amyotrophic lateral sclerosis model, and definition of the underlying mechanism could point toward novel therapeutic strategies. Using an inducible mouse model of sporadic ALS, Spiller et al. show that spinal microgliosis is not a major feature of TDP-43-triggered disease. Instead, microglia mediate TDP-43 clearance and motor recovery, suggesting a neuroprotective role in ALS."
https://openalex.org/W2788772427,"Different immune activation states require distinct metabolic features and activities in immune cells. For instance, inhibition of fatty acid synthase (FASN), which catalyzes the synthesis of long-chain fatty acids, prevents the proinflammatory response in macrophages; however, the precise role of this enzyme in this response remains poorly defined. Consistent with previous studies, we found here that FASN is essential for lipopolysaccharide-induced, Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated macrophage activation. Interestingly, only agents that block FASN upstream of acetoacetyl-CoA synthesis, including the well-characterized FASN inhibitor C75, inhibited TLR4 signaling, while those acting downstream had no effect. We found that acetoacetyl-CoA could overcome C75's inhibitory effect, whereas other FASN metabolites, including palmitate, did not prevent C75-mediated inhibition. This suggested an unexpected role for acetoacetyl-CoA in inflammation that is independent of its role in palmitate synthesis. Our evidence further suggested that acetoacetyl-CoA arising from FASN activity promotes cholesterol production, indicating a surprising link between fatty acid synthesis and cholesterol synthesis. We further demonstrate that this process is required for TLR4 to enter lipid rafts and facilitate TLR4 signaling. In conclusion, we have uncovered an unexpected link between FASN and cholesterol synthesis that appears to be required for TLR signal transduction and proinflammatory macrophage activation.

https://openalex.org/W2787484152,"Polymyxins such as colistin are antibiotics used as a final line of defense in the management of infections with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Although natural resistance to polymyxins is rare, the discovery of a mobilized colistin resistance gene (mcr-1) in gut bacteria has raised significant concern. As an intramembrane enzyme, MCR-1 catalyzes the transfer of phosphoethanolamine (PEA) to the 1 (or 4′)-phosphate group of the lipid A moiety of lipopolysaccharide, thereby conferring colistin resistance. However, the structural and biochemical mechanisms used by this integral membrane enzyme remain poorly understood. Here, we report the modeled structure of the full-length MCR-1 membrane protein. Together with molecular docking, our structural and functional dissection of the complex of MCR-1 with its phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) substrate suggested the presence of a 12 residue–containing cavity for substrate entry, which is critical for both enzymatic activity and its resultant phenotypic resistance to colistin. More importantly, two periplasm-facing helices (PH2 and PH2′) of the trans-membrane domain were essential for MCR-1 activity. MALDI-TOF MS and thin-layer chromatography assays provide both in vivo and in vitro evidence that MCR-1 catalyzes the transfer of PEA from the PE donor substrate to its recipient substrate lipid A. Also, the chemical modification of lipid A species was detected in clinical species of bacteria carrying mcr-1. Our results provide mechanistic insights into transferable MCR-1 polymyxin resistance, raising the prospect of rational design of small molecules that reverse bacterial polymyxin resistance, as a last-resort clinical option to combat pathogens with carbapenem resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2787416181,"Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) is a Ca2+-permeable channel of the transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily activated by diverse stimuli, including warm temperature, mechanical forces, and lipid mediators such as arachidonic acid (AA) and its metabolites. This activation is tightly regulated by protein phosphorylation carried out by various serine/threonine or tyrosine kinases. It remains poorly understood how phosphorylation differentially regulates TRPV4 activation in response to different stimuli. We investigated how TRPV4 activation by AA, an important signaling process in the dilation of coronary arterioles, is affected by protein kinase A (PKA)–mediated phosphorylation at Ser-824. Wildtype and mutant TRPV4 channels were expressed in human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs). AA-induced TRPV4 activation was blunted in the S824A mutant but was enhanced in the phosphomimetic S824E mutant, whereas the channel activation by the synthetic agonist GSK1016790A was not affected. The low level of basal phosphorylation at Ser-824 was robustly increased by the redox signaling molecule hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The H2O2-induced phosphorylation was accompanied by an enhanced channel activation by AA, and this enhanced response was largely abolished by PKA inhibition or S824A mutation. We further identified a potential structural context dependence of Ser-824 phosphorylation–mediated TRPV4 regulation involving an interplay between AA binding and the possible phosphorylation-induced rearrangements of the C-terminal helix bearing Ser-824. These results provide insight into how phosphorylation specifically regulates TRPV4 activation.

The mechanisms by which TRPV4 is activated by such diverse stimuli are currently poorly understood, yet evidence indicates at least two independent pathways of activation. The synthetic agonist 4α-PDD activates TRPV4 by directly binding to its TM3 and TM4 segments in a ligand-like manner (38Vriens J. Owsianik G. Janssens A. Voets T. Nilius B.

Mutating a tyrosine residue (Y555A) in the TM3 strongly impairs activation of TRPV4 by 4α-PDD but has no effect on activation by cell swelling or AA, a finding consistent with an independent activation mechanism by AA or its metabolites (39Vriens J.

It is well established that phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC) and protein kinase A (PKA) can phosphorylate and sensitize TRPV1 channel in the development of heat hyperalgesia (43Zhang X.

Phosphorylation of TRPV4 by these protein kinases, although at different sites (Ser-162, Thr-175, and Ser-189 residues by PKC and Ser-824 residue by PKA), enhances TRPV4 activation induced by hypotonic swelling (40Fan H.C.

A subsequent study confirmed that PKC and possibly PKA phosphorylate TRPV4 at Ser-824 resulting in its sensitization to the hypotonic solution (42Peng H. Lewandrowski U. Müller B. Sickmann A. Walz G.

However, the mechanisms by which phosphorylation regulates TRPV4 activation in response to different stimuli, as well as the exact pathways responsible for TRPV4 phosphorylation under physiological or pathophysiological conditions, remain to be defined. Using native human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) and TRPV4-overexpressing HCAECs, we recently reported that AA activates TRPV4, and this activation requires PKA-mediated protein phosphorylation (36Zheng X.

Furthermore, TRPV4 mediates shear stress–induced and endothelium-dependent vasodilation in human coronary arterioles (HCAs) isolated from subjects with coronary artery disease, a condition associated with enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (45Bubolz A.H.

In this study, we explored the role and mechanism of PKA-mediated Ser-824 phosphorylation in TRPV4 activation by AA. The present study shows that AA-induced TRPV4 activation is strongly and specifically regulated by Ser-824 phosphorylation of the channel. We demonstrate that H2O2 stimulates PKA-dependent phosphorylation of TRPV4 at Ser-824 and consequently enhances AA-induced channel activation in both cultured and native HCAECs. To further identify the potential structural context by which Ser-824 phosphorylation confers specific regulation of TRPV4 activation by AA, we have developed a homology model of the human TRPV4, including the domain harboring the previously postulated arachidonate recognition sequence (ARS) (1Nilius B. Vriens J. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Voets T. TRPV4 calcium entry channel: A paradigm for gating diversity.Am. J. Physiol.

We have used an automated docking approach to infer a likely conformation of AA in the putative binding region and hypothesized on a potential mechanism of TRPV4 activation by AA binding, the restraint on activation by the C-terminal domain, and facilitation of gating by Ser-824 phosphorylation that might dislodge the C-terminal domain from its inhibitory location. TRPV4 is expressed in endothelial cells of different species and vascular beds including HCAECs (12Mendoza S.A. Fang J. Gutterman D.D. Wilcox D.A. Bubolz A.H. Li R. Suzuki M. Zhang D.X.

https://openalex.org/W2788377804,"Cofilin/ADF proteins are actin-remodeling proteins, essential for actin disassembly in various cellular processes, including cell division, intracellular transport, and motility. Cofilins bind actin filaments cooperatively and sever them preferentially at boundaries between bare and cofilin-decorated (cofilactin) segments. The cooperative binding to actin has been proposed to originate from conformational changes that propagate allosterically from clusters of bound cofilin to bare actin segments. Estimates of the lengths over which these cooperative conformational changes propagate vary dramatically, ranging from 2 to >100 subunits. Here, we present a general, structure-based method for detecting from cryo-EM micrographs small variations in filament geometry (i.e. twist) with single-subunit precision. How these variations correlate with regulatory protein occupancy reveals how far allosteric, conformational changes propagate along filaments. We used this method to determine the effects of cofilin on the actin filament twist. Our results indicate that cofilin-induced changes in filament twist propagate only 1–2 subunits from the boundary into the bare actin segment, independently of the boundary polarity (i.e. irrespective of whether or not the bare actin segment flanks the pointed or barbed-end side of the boundary) and the pyrene fluorophore labeling of actin. These observations indicate that the filament twist changes abruptly at boundaries between bare and cofilin-decorated segments, thereby constraining mechanistic models of cooperative actin filament interactions and severing by cofilin. The methods presented here extend the capability of cryo-EM to analyze biologically relevant deviations from helical symmetry in actin as well as other classes of linear polymers."
https://openalex.org/W2788633957,"The StARkin superfamily comprises proteins with steroidogenic acute regulatory protein-related lipid transfer (StART) domains that are implicated in intracellular, non-vesicular lipid transport. A new family of membrane-anchored StARkins was recently identified, including six members, Lam1-Lam6, in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Lam1-Lam4 are anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane at sites where the ER is tethered to the plasma membrane and proposed to be involved in sterol homeostasis in yeast. To better understand the biological roles of these proteins, we carried out a structure-function analysis of the second StARkin domain of Lam4, here termed Lam4S2. NMR experiments indicated that Lam4S2 undergoes specific conformational changes upon binding sterol, and fluorescence-based assays revealed that it catalyzes sterol transport between vesicle populations in vitro, exhibiting a preference for vesicles containing anionic lipids. Using such vesicles, we found that sterols are transported at a rate of ∼50 molecules per Lam4S2 per minute. Crystal structures of Lam4S2, with and without bound sterol, revealed a largely hydrophobic but surprisingly accessible sterol-binding pocket with the 3-OH group of the sterol oriented toward its base. Single or multiple alanine or aspartic acid replacements of conserved lysine residues in a basic patch on the surface of Lam4S2 near the likely sterol entry/egress site strongly attenuated sterol transport. Our results suggest that Lam4S2 engages anionic membranes via a basic surface patch, enabling ""head-first"" entry of sterol into the binding pocket followed by partial closure of the entryway. Reversal of these steps enables sterol egress."
https://openalex.org/W2792991562,"Background Efforts to reduce racial disparities in total hip replacement (THR) have focused mainly on patient behaviors. While these efforts are no doubt important, they ignore the potentially important role of provider- and system-level factors, which may be easier to modify. We aimed to determine whether the patterns of interaction among physicians around THR episodes differ in communities with low versus high concentrations of black residents. Materials and methods We analyzed national Medicare claims from 2008 to 2011, identifying all fee-for-service beneficiaries who underwent THR. Based on physician encounter data, we then mapped the physician referral networks at the hospitals where beneficiaries’ procedures were performed. Next, we measured two structural properties of these networks that could affect care coordination and information sharing: clustering, and the number of external ties. Finally, we estimated multivariate regression models to determine the relationship between the concentration of black residents in the community [as measured by the hospital service area (HSA)] served by a given network and each of these 2 network properties. Results Our sample included 336,506 beneficiaries (mean age 76.3 ± SD), 63.1% of whom were women. HSAs with higher concentrations of black residents tended to be more impoverished than those with lower concentrations. While HSAs with higher concentrations of black residents had, on average, more acute care beds and medical specialists, they had fewer surgeons per capita than those with lower concentrations. After adjusting for these differences, we found that HSAs with higher concentrations of black residents were served by physician referral networks that had significantly higher within-network clustering but fewer external ties. Conclusions We observed differences in the patterns of interaction among physicians around THR episodes in communities with low versus high concentrations of black residents. Studies investigating the impact of these differences on access to quality providers and on THR outcomes are needed."

In A. thaliana, 19 genes encode GH3 proteins, but the physiological roles for many of these enzymes remain unclear. Early bioinformatic studies suggested that GH3 proteins group into JA-specific, IAA-specific, and benzoate-specific families (15Terol J. Domingo C. Talón M.

Group 1 consists of the (+)-7-iso-jasmonyl-l-isoleucine biosynthesis enzyme AtGH3.11/JAR1. The eight IAA-conjugating enzymes AtGH3.1, AtGH3.2, AtGH3.3, AtGH3.4, AtGH3.5/WES1, AtGH3.6/DFL1, AtGH3.9, and AtGH3.17/VAS2 form group 2.

A non-physiological substrate for AtGH3.12/PBS3 has been used for activity assays (16Okrent R.A. Brooks M.D. Wildermuth M.C. Arabidopsis GH3.12 (PBS3) conjugates amino acids to 4-substituted benzoates and is inhibited by salicylate.J. Biol.

In an effort to elucidate potential biological roles for the uncharacterized Arabidopsis GH3 proteins, we used a biochemical screening approach with AtGH3.15, a representative member of group 6. Here, we identify AtGH3.15 as an acyl acid amido synthetase specific for indole-3-butyric acid (IBA). Although several IAA-using GH3 proteins accept IBA as a substrate (8Staswick P.E. Serban B.

Kinetic analysis of wildtype and mutant AtGH3.15 and the three-dimensional structure of the AtGH3.15·AMP complex provide molecular details that distinguish this protein from other structurally characterized GH3 proteins. In planta examination of Arabidopsis AtGH3.15 knockout and overexpression lines and expression analysis indicate a role for the enzyme throughout growth and development. Overall, this study reveals a broader role for GH3 proteins beyond the conjugation of JA and IAA in plant hormone homeostasis. To identify a biochemical function for AtGH3.15, the protein was expressed in bacteria and purified with an N-terminal His tag. Screening for activity used JA, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, IAA, IBA, phenylacetic acid, benzoic acid, salicylic acid, gibberillic acid, and abscisic acid as potential acyl acid substrates, each with all 20 amino acids in a coupled enzyme assay (12Chen Q.

AtGH3.15 had the highest specific activity with IBA and glutamine as substrates (193 nmol min−1 mg−1 protein) but also displayed moderate activity with JA and glutamine (28 nmol min−1 mg−1 protein) (Fig. 1A). To confirm enzymatic formation of the IBA-Gln conjugate in the in vitro assay, QTRAP mass spectrometry analysis was performed. Incubation of AtGH3.15 with IBA, ATP, and glutamine led to formation of IBA-Gln (deprotonated molecular ion (M-H)− m/z = 330.3; Fig. S1). Assays in the absence of protein or any one substrate did not yield a product peak corresponding to the IBA-Gln conjugate. As reported for other GH3 proteins (8Staswick P.E. Serban B. Rowe M.

Determination of steady-state kinetic parameters for AtGH3.15 confirms the ∼5-fold higher catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for IBA versus JA as the acyl acid substrate (Table 1). Comparison of the kinetic parameters for the amino acid substrates indicates that glutamine and cysteine displayed comparable catalytic efficiencies that were each 4–7-fold higher than the kcat/Km values for histidine, methionine, or tyrosine (Table 1). The up to 10-fold higher Km values for histidine, methionine, and tyrosine indicate that these are probably not preferred amino acid substrates.

To further examine whether side chain length influenced AtGH3.15 activity, assays using indoles with acidic side chains 2–6 carbons in length were performed (Table 2). AtGH3.15 used IAA, but less efficiently than IBA. Although IAA and IBA have similar Km values, the turnover rate was 14-fold slower with IAA. The three-carbon indole-3-propionic acid substrate displayed a 6-fold lower kcat/Km compared with IBA. Indole-3-valeric acid with a five-carbon side chain was used; however, saturation was not observed with indole-3-valeric acid (IVA; 250 μm maximum). An estimate of catalytic efficiency based on specific activity suggests comparable activity with IBA. No detectable activity was observed with the 6-carbon side-chain indole-3-caproic acid.

https://openalex.org/W2783182260,"Autophagy is systematically regulated by upstream factors and nutrients. Recent studies reported that telomerase and hexokinase 2 [HK2) regulate autophagy through mTOR and that telomerase has the capacity to bind to the HK2 promoter. However, the molecular linkage among telomerase, HK2, and autophagy is not fully understood. Here, we show that HK2 connects telomerase to autophagy. HK2 inhibition in HepG2 cells suppressed TERT-induced autophagy activation and further enhancement by glucose deprivation. The HK2 downstream factor mTOR was responsible for the TERT-induced autophagy activation under glucose deprivation, implying that TERT promotes autophagy through an HK2-mTOR pathway. TERC played a role similar to that of TERT, and simultaneous expression of TERT and TERC synergistically enhanced HK2 expression and autophagy. At the gene level, TERT bound to the HK2 promoter at a specific region harboring the telomerase-responsive sequence 'TTGGG.' Mutagenesis of TERC and the TERT-responsive element in the HK2 promoter revealed that TERC is required for the binding of TERT to the HK2 promoter. We demonstrate the existence of a telomerase-HK2-mTOR-autophagy axis and suggest that inhibition of the interaction between telomerase and the HK2 promoter diminishes glucose starvation-induced autophagy."
https://openalex.org/W2790955237,"With recent aging demographic trends, the needs for enhancing geo-spatial analysis capabilities and monitoring the status of accessibilities of its citizens with healthcare services have increased. The accessibility to healthcare is determined not only by geographic distances to service locations, but also includes travel time, available modes of transportation, and departure time. Having access to the latest and accurate information regarding the healthcare accessibility allows the municipal government to plan for improvements, including expansion of healthcare infrastructure, effective labor distribution, alternative healthcare options for the regions with low accessibilities, and redesigning the public transportation routes and schedules. This paper proposes a new method named, Seoul Enhanced 2-Step Floating Catchment Area (SE2SFCA), which is customized for the city of Seoul, where population density is higher and the average distance between healthcare-service locations tends to be shorter than the typical North American or European cities. The proposed method of SE2SFCA is found to be realistic and effective in determining the weak accessibility regions. It resolves the over-estimation issues of the past, arising from the assignment of high healthcare accessibility for the regions with large hospitals and high density of population and hospitals."
https://openalex.org/W2785625069,"Peroxidases are considered essential agents of lignin degradation by white-rot basidiomycetes. However, low-molecular-weight oxidants likely have a primary role in lignin breakdown because many of these fungi delignify wood before its porosity has sufficiently increased for enzymes to infiltrate. It has been proposed that lignin peroxidases (LPs, EC 1.11.1.14) fulfill this role by oxidizing the secreted fungal metabolite veratryl alcohol (VA) to its aryl cation radical (VA+•), releasing it to act as a one-electron lignin oxidant within woody plant cell walls. Here, we attached the fluorescent oxidant sensor BODIPY 581/591 throughout beads with a nominal porosity of 6 kDa and assessed whether peroxidase-generated aryl cation radical systems could oxidize the beads. As positive control, we used the 1,2,4,5-tetramethoxybenzene (TMB) cation radical, generated from TMB by horseradish peroxidase. This control oxidized the beads to depths that increased with the amount of oxidant supplied, ultimately resulting in completely oxidized beads. A reaction-diffusion computer model yielded oxidation profiles that were within the 95% confidence intervals for the data. By contrast, bead oxidation caused by VA and the LPA isozyme of Phanerochaete chrysosporium was confined to a shallow shell of LP-accessible volume at the bead surface, regardless of how much oxidant was supplied. This finding contrasted with the modeling results, which showed that if the LP/VA system were to release VA+•, it would oxidize the bead interiors. We conclude that LPA releases insignificant quantities of VA+• and that a different mechanism produces small ligninolytic oxidants during white rot."
https://openalex.org/W2793248292,"Depression is a relevant risk factor for low back pain and is associated with the outcomes of low back pain. Depression also often overlaps with somatisation. As previous studies have suggested that somatisation or a higher somatic symptom burden has a role in the outcomes of low back pain, the aim of the present cross-sectional study was to examine whether somatic symptom burden was associated with health-related quality of life in individuals with chronic low back pain independent of depression. We analyzed internet survey data on physical and mental health in Japanese adults aged 20-64 years with chronic low back pain (n = 3,100). Health-related quality of life was assessed using the EuroQol five dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire. Somatic symptom burden and depression were assessed using the Somatic Symptom Scale-8 (SSS-8) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2), respectively. SSS-8 score was categorized as no to minimal (0-3), low (4-7), medium (8-11), high (12-15), and very high (16-32). The association between SSS-8 and EQ-5D was examined using linear regression models, adjusting for depression and other covariates, including age, sex, BMI, smoking, marital status, education, exercise, employment, and the number of comorbid diseases. A higher somatic symptom burden was significantly associated with a lower health-related quality of life independent of depression and the number of comorbid diseases (regression coefficient = 0.040 for SSS-8 high vs. very high and 0.218 for non to minimal vs. very high, p trend <0.0001). In conclusion, somatic symptom burden might be important for the health-related quality of life of individuals with chronic low back pain."
https://openalex.org/W2789443590,"Payment for hydrological services (PHS) are popular tools for conserving ecosystems and their water-related services. However, improving the spatial targeting and impacts of PHS, as well as their ability to foster synergies with other ecosystem services (ES), remain challenging. We aimed at using spatial analyses to evaluate the targeting performance of México’s National PHS program in central Veracruz. We quantified the effectiveness of areas targeted for PHS in actually covering areas of high HS provision and social priority during 2003–2013. First, we quantified provisioning and spatial distributions of two target (water yield and soil retention), and one non-target ES (carbon storage) using InVEST. Subsequently, pairwise relationships among ES were quantified by using spatial correlation and overlap analyses. Finally, we evaluated targeting by: (i) prioritizing areas of individual and overlapping ES; (ii) quantifying spatial co-occurrences of these priority areas with those targeted by PHS; (iii) evaluating the extent to which PHS directly contribute to HS delivery; and (iv), testing if PHS targeted areas disproportionately covered areas with high ecological and social priority. We found that modelled priority areas exhibited non-random distributions and distinct spatial patterns. Our results show significant pairwise correlations between all ES suggesting synergistic relationships. However, our analysis showed a significantly lower overlap than expected and thus significant mismatches between PHS targeted areas and all types of priority areas. These findings suggest that the targeting of areas with high HS provisioning and social priority by Mexico’s PHS program could be improved significantly. This study underscores: (1) the importance of using maps of HS provisioning as main targeting criteria in PHS design to channel payments towards areas that require future conservation, and (2) the need for future research that helps balance ecological and socioeconomic targeting criteria."

However, the development of inhalation flow meters for various inhalation devices has been unable to keep up with the increasing number of newly launched inhalation devices. In the present study, we developed simple attachment orifices for the inhalation flow pattern monitoring system, which are suitable for all commercial inhalers, and investigated the efficacy of the system on the clinical inhalation instruction for patients co-prescribed dry powder inhaler (DPI) and soft mist inhaler (SMI). First, we constructed simple attachment orifices that were adjusted for 13 commercial inhalers, and examined the correlation between orifice and inhalation device. Second, the inhalation flow patterns (peak inspiratory flow rate, PIFR; inhalation duration time, DT) of patients prescribed a combination of DPI and SMI were monitored before and after inhalation instruction. The inhalation resistance of commercial inhalers are listed in the following order; Twincaps® > Handihaler® > Swinghaler® = Clickhaler® > Twisthaler® > Turbuhaler® > Jenuair® > Diskus® = Ellipta® > Diskhaler® > Breezhaler® > Respimat® = pMDI. The pressure drop via orifice was significantly correlated with that via the commercial inhaler. For the confirmation, all participants achieved the DPI criterion of PIFR. On the other hand, 4 participants (6 clinical visits) of 10 experimented participants could not achieve the essential criterion of DT (> 1.5 sec) for SMI, but all participants improved their duration time after inhalation instruction by pharmacists (P<0.05). In the present study, we successfully developed simple attachment orifice suitable for 13 commercial inhalation devices. These data suggested that our simple attachment orifices for the inhalation flow pattern monitoring system can detect patients with inadequate inhalation patterns via SMI."
https://openalex.org/W2792411282,"Purpose To determine whether there is a significant association between prior cataract surgery and cognitive function in an elderly Japanese cohort. Setting Nara Medical University, Nara, Japan. Design The Fujiwara-kyo Eye Study was a cross-sectional epidemiological study. Methods The subjects were ≥ 68-years who lived in the Nara Prefecture and responded to recruitment notices. All of the subjects received comprehensive ophthalmological examinations, and answered questionnaires on their socio-demographic and medical history including prior cataract surgery. The association between prior cataract surgery and cognitive function was determined. Results A total of the 2764 subjects whose mean age was 76.3±4.8 years (±standard deviation) was studied. Of these, 668 individuals (24.2%) had undergone cataract surgery. Of these, 150 (5.4%) had dementia as determined by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score ≤23, and 877 individuals (31.7%) had mild cognitive impairment (MCI; MMSE score 24–26). The subjects who had prior cataract surgery had significantly lower odds ratio (OR) of having MCI (OR = 0.78, 95% confidence interval; CI 0.64–0.96, P = 0.019) than those who had not had cataract surgery after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, education, hypertension, diabetes, depression, and history of stroke. The OR was still lower when the visual acuity was also added to the adjusted factors (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64–0.97, P = 0.025). However, prior cataract surgery did not contribute significantly to the low OR for dementia. Conclusions Cataract surgery may play a role in reducing the risk of developing MCI independently of visual acuity but not for dementia."
https://openalex.org/W2788268344,"Growing numbers of therapeutic antibodies offer excellent treatment strategies for many diseases. Elucidation of the interaction between a potential therapeutic antibody and its target protein by structural analysis reveals the mechanism of action and offers useful information for developing rational antibody designs for improved affinity. Here, we developed a rapid, high-yield cell-free system using dialysis mode to synthesize antibody fragments for the structural analysis of antibody–antigen complexes. Optimal synthesis conditions of fragments (Fv and Fab) of the anti-EGFR antibody 059–152 were rapidly determined in a day by using a 30-μl-scale unit. The concentration of supplemented disulfide isomerase, DsbC, was critical to obtaining soluble antibody fragments. The optimal conditions were directly applicable to a 9-ml-scale reaction, with linear scalable yields of more than 1 mg/ml. Analyses of purified 059-152-Fv and Fab showed that the cell-free synthesized antibody fragments were disulfide-bridged, with antigen binding activity comparable to that of clinical antibodies. Examination of the crystal structure of cell-free synthesized 059-152-Fv in complex with the extracellular domain of human EGFR revealed that the epitope of 059-152-Fv broadly covers the EGF binding surface on domain III, including residues that formed critical hydrogen bonds with EGF (Asp355EGFR, Gln384EGFR, H409EGFR, and Lys465EGFR), so that the antibody inhibited EGFR activation. We further demonstrated the application of the cell-free system to site-specific integration of non-natural amino acids for antibody engineering, which would expand the availability of therapeutic antibodies based on structural information and rational design. This cell-free system could be an ideal antibody-fragment production platform for functional and structural analysis of potential therapeutic antibodies and for engineered antibody development."
https://openalex.org/W4211011011,"Background International guidelines recommend 4 weeks of treatment with ampicillin plus gentamicin (A+G) for uncomplicated native valve Enterococcus faecalis infective endocarditis (EFIE) and 6 weeks in the remaining cases. Ampicillin plus ceftriaxone (A+C) is always recommended for at least 6w, with no available studies assessing its suitability for 4w. We aimed to investigate differences in the outcome of EFIE according to the duration (4 versus 6 weeks) of antibiotic treatment (A+G or A+C). Methods Retrospective analysis from a prospectively collected cohort of 78 EFIE patients treated with either A+G or A+C. Results 32 cases (41%) were treated with A+G (9 for 4w, 28%) and 46 (59%) with A+C (14 for 4w, 30%). No significant differences were found in 1-year mortality according to the type of treatment (31% and 24% in A+G and A+C, respectively; P = 0.646) or duration (26% and 27% at 4 and 6w, respectively; P = 0.863). Relapses were more frequent among survivors treated for 4w than in those treated for 6w (3/18 [17%] at 4w and 1/41 [2%] at 6w; P = 0.045). Three out of 4 (75%) relapses occurred in cirrhotic patients. Conclusions A 4-week course of antibiotic treatment might not be suitable neither for A+G nor A+C for treating uncomplicated native valve EFIE."

https://openalex.org/W2787635308,"A newly recognized third fundamental mechanism of energy conservation in biology, electron bifurcation, uses free energy from exergonic redox reactions to drive endergonic redox reactions. Flavin-based electron bifurcation furnishes low-potential electrons to demanding chemical reactions, such as reduction of dinitrogen to ammonia. We employed the heterodimeric flavoenzyme FixAB from the diazotrophic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris to elucidate unique properties that underpin flavin-based electron bifurcation. FixAB is distinguished from canonical electron transfer flavoproteins (ETFs) by a second FAD that replaces the AMP of canonical ETF. We exploited near-UV–visible CD spectroscopy to resolve signals from the different flavin sites in FixAB and to interrogate the putative bifurcating FAD. CD aided in assigning the measured reduction midpoint potentials (E° values) to individual flavins, and the E° values tested the accepted model regarding the redox properties required for bifurcation. We found that the higher-E° flavin displays sequential one-electron (1-e−) reductions to anionic semiquinone and then to hydroquinone, consistent with the reactivity seen in canonical ETFs. In contrast, the lower-E° flavin displayed a single two-electron (2-e−) reduction without detectable accumulation of semiquinone, consistent with unstable semiquinone states, as required for bifurcation. This is the first demonstration that a FixAB protein possesses the thermodynamic prerequisites for bifurcating activity, and the separation of distinct optical signatures for the two flavins lays a foundation for mechanistic studies to learn how electron flow can be directed in a protein environment. We propose that a novel optical signal observed at long wavelength may reflect electron delocalization between the two flavins."
https://openalex.org/W2788398507,"Early fertilizer nitrogen (N) application on cover crops or their residues during the off-season is a practice adopted in Brazil subtropical conditions under no-tillage corn (Zea mays L.) systems. However, the effect of early N application on yield, plant N content, and N recovery efficiency (NRE) for corn is not yet well documented. Five fertilizer N timings in an oat-corn system were evaluated in two studies utilizing an isotopic-labeled N determination, 15N isotope. The N fertilization timings were: (i) oat tillering, (ii) 15 days before corn planting time, over the oat residues, (iii) at corn planting time, (iv) in-season at the three-leaf growth stage (V3), and (v) in-season split application at V3 and six-leaf (V6) growth stages. Based on the statistical analysis, the N fertilization timings were separated into three groups: 1) N-OATS, designated to N applied at oat; 2) N-PLANT, referred to pre-plant and planting N applications; and 3) N-CORN, designated to in-season corn N applications. Corn yield was not affected by the N fertilization timing. However, the N-CORN N fertilization timings enhanced NRE by 17% and 35% and final N recovery system (plant plus soil) by 16% and 24% all relative to N-OATS and N-PLANT groups, respectively. Overall, N-OATS resulted in the largest N derived from fertilizer (NDFF) amount in the deeper soil layer, in overall a delta of 10 kg N ha-1 relative to the rest of the groups. Notwithstanding corn yield was not affected, early N fertilization under subtropical conditions is not a viable option since NRE was diminished and the non-recovery N increased relative to the in-season N applications."
https://openalex.org/W2793939351,"Plant parasitic nematodes, including root knot nematode Meloidogyne species, cause extensive damage to agriculture and horticultural crops. As Vitis vinifera cultivars are susceptible to root knot nematode parasitism, rootstocks resistant to these soil pests provide a sustainable approach to maintain grapevine production. Currently, most of the commercially available root knot nematode resistant rootstocks are highly vigorous and take up excess potassium, which reduces wine quality. As a result, there is a pressing need to breed new root knot nematode resistant rootstocks, which have no impact on wine quality. To develop molecular markers that predict root knot nematode resistance for marker assisted breeding, a genetic approach was employed to identify a root knot nematode resistance locus in grapevine. To this end, a Meloidogyne javanica resistant Vitis cinerea accession was crossed to a susceptible Vitis vinifera cultivar Riesling and results from screening the F1 individuals support a model that root knot nematode resistance, is conferred by a single dominant allele, referred as MELOIDOGYNE JAVANICA RESISTANCE1 (MJR1). Further, MJR1 resistance appears to be mediated by a hypersensitive response that occurs in the root apical meristem. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified using genotyping-by-sequencing and results from association and genetic mapping identified the MJR1 locus, which is located on chromosome 18 in the Vitis cinerea accession. Validation of the SNPs linked to the MJR1 locus using a Sequenom MassARRAY platform found that only 50% could be validated. The validated SNPs that flank and co-segregate with the MJR1 locus can be used for marker-assisted selection for Meloidogyne javanica resistance in grapevine."
https://openalex.org/W2787969499,"The Nedd4 family of HECT domain-containing E3 ligases ubiquitinate many transcription factors and signaling proteins, and their activity is tightly regulated. Normally, intramolecular interactions curb the catalytic activity of the HECT domain, but these can be broken by the binding of PY motifs, found on substrate molecules and adaptors, to the WW domains characteristic of this E3 ligase family. This raises the prospect of substrates automatically activating the ligases, frustrating the purpose of ligase regulation. Here we show that soluble protein substrates and adaptors such as α arrestins, even with multiple PY elements, cannot activate ligase activity efficiently. However, we found that polymerization or membrane tethering of these substrates dramatically increases the ligase activity both in vivo and in vitro Aggregation of luciferase-containing substrates upon heat shock had a similar effect and could also expose cryptic PY elements in the substrates. We inferred that ligase activation critically requires a substantial array of clustered PY motifs and that the formation of such arrays on membranes or in polymeric aggregates may be an essential step in this mode of ligase regulation. We conclude that recruitment of α arrestins to membrane receptors and aggregation of unstable proteins after heat shock may be physiologically relevant mechanisms for triggering ubiquitination by Nedd4 family HECT domain-containing E3 ligases."
https://openalex.org/W2790083532,"Background The global increase in C-section rates is real. In Brazil, these indices correspond to 58.94% in the Midwest region and 52.77% in the Federal District. Objective To evaluate the C-section rates and identify the groups with the greatest risk at two reference hospitals in the public network of Federal District/Brazil, using 10-Group Robson System. Method A cross-sectional study of 6579 births assisted at the Hospital A (HA) and the Hospital B (HB) during 2013. The C-section rates in each group and its respective contribution to the total hospital C-sections was compared between HA and HB. To this, was used the proportion difference test (similar to chi-square test), with RR and 95% CI, and the logistic regression analysis (OR; 95% CI) among the groups with higher C-section/total C-section. The significance limit of p < 0.05 was defined for all tests. Results The C-section rates were 50.8% at the HA and 42.3% at the HB, with 1.20 RR (95%CI = 1.13–1.28) at the HA. The highest rates were observed in Robson groups G5, G1, and G2. At the HA, G1 had a 21.5% C-section rate, which was greater than at the HB (13.8%; p < 0.05); the cesarean rates for groups G2 and G5 were higher at the HB (respectively, 18.6 and 38.1%) than at the HA (14.8 and 32.5%, respectively; p < 0.05). Conclusion These results point out specific goals to be achieved in order to reduce abusive cesarean rates in both A and B hospitals, especially in the primigravida and in those with previous C-section."
https://openalex.org/W2790308484,"Peritoneal infection after colorectal cancer surgery is associated with a higher rate of tumor relapse. We have recently proposed that soluble inflammatory factors released in response to a postoperative infection enhance tumor progression features in residual tumor cells. In an effort to set up models to study the mechanisms of residual tumor cell activation during surgery-associated inflammation, we have analyzed the phenotypic response of colon cancer cell lines to the paracrine effects of THP-1 and U937 differentiated human macrophages, which release an inflammatory medium characteristic of an innate immune response. The exposure of the colon cancer cell lines HT-29 and SW620 to conditioned media isolated from differentiated THP-1 and U937 macrophages induced a mesenchymal-like phenotypic shift, involving the activation of in vitro invasiveness. The inflammatory media activated the β-catenin/TCF4 transcriptional pathway and induced the expression of several mesenchymal (e.g., FN1 and VIM) and TCF4 target genes (e.g., MMP7, PTGS2, MET, and CCD1). Similarly, differential expression of some transcription factors involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions (i.e. ZEB1, SNAI1, and SNAI2) was variably observed in the colon cancer cell lines when exposed to the inflammatory media. THP-1 and U937 macrophages, which displayed characteristics of M1 differentiation, overexpressed some cytokines previously shown to be induced in colorectal cancer patients with increased rates of tumor recurrence associated with postoperative peritoneal infections, thus suggesting their pro-tumoral character. Therefore, the environment created by inflammatory M1 macrophages enhances features of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and may be useful as a model to characterize pro-inflammatory cytokines as putative biomarkers of tumor recurrence risk."

Reasons for low levels of PA have not previously been explored among Asians living within their endogenous environment. This qualitative study was performed to explore the contextual reasons that limited PA among type 2 diabetic patients living in a rural community.Purposeful sampling recruited 40 participants with long standing type 2 diabetes for this qualitative study. Semi-structered questions utilising in-depth interviews were used to collect data on PA patterns, barriers to PA and factors that would facilitate PA. The interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed. Data were analyzed using a framework approach.The sample consisted of 11 males and 29 females. Mean age was 55.4 (SD 8.9) years. The mean duration of diabetes in the study population was 8.5 (SD 6.8) years. Inability to differentitate household and daily activities from PA emerged as a recurring theme. Most did not have a clear understanding of the type or duration of PA that they should perform. Health related issues, lifestyle and time management, envronmental and social factors like social embarrassment, prioritizing household activities over PA were important factors that limited PA. Most stated that the concept of exercising was alien to their culture and lifestyle.Culturally appropriate programmes that strengthen health education and empower communities to overcome socio-economic barriers that limit PA should be implemented to better manage diabetes among rural Sri Lankan diabetic patients."
https://openalex.org/W2786690884,"Many pathogenic bacteria, including Streptococcus gordonii, possess a pathway for the cellular export of a single serine-rich-repeat protein that mediates the adhesion of bacteria to host cells and the extracellular matrix. This adhesin protein is O-glycosylated by several cytosolic glycosyltransferases and requires three accessory Sec proteins (Asp1–3) for export, but how the adhesin protein is processed for export is not well understood. Here, we report that the S. gordonii adhesin GspB is sequentially O-glycosylated by three enzymes (GtfA/B, Nss, and Gly) that attach N-acetylglucosamine and glucose to Ser/Thr residues.

We further observed that Asp1 also has an affinity for phospholipids, which is attenuated by Asp2. In summary, our findings support a model in which the GspB adhesin is sequentially glycosylated by GtfA/B, Nss, and Gly and then transferred to the Asp1/2/3 complex in which Asp1 mediates the interaction of the Asp1/2/3 complex with the lipid bilayer for targeting of matured GspB to the export machinery.

In the canonical pathway, proteins are moved by the SecA ATPase through the protein-conducting SecY channel. In the accessory Sec pathway, export is mediated by distinct SecA and SecY proteins (SecA2 and SecY2).

Here, we show that the modification of the adhesin GspB of S. gordonii by the glycosyltransferases occurs in a sequential manner. First, GlcNAc residues are attached to Ser/Thr residues in the SRR domains of GspB. Next, Nss adds glucose to GlcNAc, and finally, Gly adds glucose to previously attached glucose residues. Interestingly, Gly remains bound to the modified substrate. Release of modified GspB from Gly is caused by the complex of the three Asps (Asp complex). Crystal structures suggest that both Asp1 and Asp3 are indeed carbohydrate-binding proteins. Asp1 seems to be a catalytically inactive member of the GT-B family of glycosyltransferases, and Asp3 contains a carbohydrate-binding module also found in several glycosidases. Our results also show that Asp1 has an affinity for negatively charged phospholipids, which may facilitate substrate delivery to the membrane. Taken together, our results suggest a model for the pathway by which the adhesin is modified and targeted to the export machinery. To test the role of the glycosyltransferases in adhesin modification, we produced a fragment of the GspB substrate by in vitro translation in reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine. The GspB fragment (GspB-F; Fig. S1) contains residues 91–736, including the first Ser/Thr-rich domain (SRR1), an intervening sequence that normally binds to host cells (binding region), and the N-terminal part of the second Ser/Thr-rich domain (SRR2N). It lacks the N-terminal signal sequence. GspB-F with the signal sequence is glycosylated in S. gordonii cells and secreted with the same efficiency as full-length adhesin (29Bensing B.A. Takamatsu D. Sullam P.M. Determinants of the streptococcal surface glycoprotein GspB that facilitate export by the accessory Sec system.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58 (16313630): 1468-148110.1111/j.1365-2958.2005.04919.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In vitro translation of GspB-F generated non-glycosylated protein that could be visualized as a single band after SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 1A, lane 1). As described previously, when a purified complex of GtfA and GftB and UDP-GlcNAc was added after translation, a size shift was observed, caused by modification of GspB-F with GlcNAc residues (G1 species; Fig. 1A, lane 2). Subsequent addition of purified Nss and UDP-Glc resulted in a further size shift (G2 species; Fig. 1A, lane 3). Nss did not function with UDP-GlcNAc (Fig. 1B, lane 3 versus lane 2). Finally, yet a larger species was generated when purified Gly was introduced (G3 species; Fig. 1A, lane 4). Nss did not attach Glc residues to unmodified GspB-F (Fig. 1C, lane 1 versus lane 3), indicating that it can only modify substrate after GtfA/B has added GlcNAc residues. The same is true for Gly (Fig. 1D, lane 1). Finally, modification by Gly was dependent on the prior action of Nss (Fig. 1E, lane 3 versus lane 4). Taken together, these results indicate that GtfA/B, Nss, and Gly function in a defined order; GtfA adds GlcNAc residues to Ser/Thr residues in the SRR domains, which are then further modified with Glc residues by the sequential action of Nss and Gly. To test whether the modification of GspB with multiple sugars occurs in vivo, we purified GspB-F secreted from S. gordonii and used mass spectrometry to analyze sugars released by β-elimination (Fig. S2, A and B). The major peaks were further analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (Fig. S2C), and the monosaccharide composition of tryptic peptides was determined after hydrolysis by anion-exchange chromatography (Fig. S2D). These experiments indicated that the main glycan species were GlcNAc (mass 330.19), GlcGlcNAc (mass 534.29), and Glc2GlcNAc (mass 738.39). Similar results were obtained when GspB-F was expressed in Escherichia coli together with GtfA/B, Nss, and Gly, and the purified protein was subjected to glycan analysis (Fig. S3, A–D); again, GlcNAc, GlcGlcNAc, and Glc2GlcNAc were the major species. Although identification of modified GspB-F peptides by mass spectrometry was challenging, we identified with confidence an SRR1 peptide that contained a Ser modified by one N-acetylhexosamine (HexNAc) and two hexoses (Fig. S3E). Taken together, these results are consistent with the idea that Nss and Gly add glucose residues to GlcNAc attached by GtfA/B to Ser/Thr of GspB-F. Nss consists of a single domain that has a typical GT-B glycosyltransferase fold (20Zhu F. Erlandsen H. Ding L. Li J. Huang Y. Zhou M. Liang X. Ma J. Wu H.

Wu H. The highly conserved domain of unknown function 1792 has a distinct glycosyltransferase fold.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 (25023666)4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We found that the isolated GT-D of S. gordonii Gly was capable of adding Glc residues to GspB-F pre-modified with GtfA/B and Nss (Fig. 1F, right panel, lane 6), whereas the isolated N-terminal fragment containing the GT-A and GT-B folds was inactive (lane 5). Thus, despite the fact that the N-terminal domains are sequence-related to glycosyltransferases, they seem to lack enzymatic activity. To our surprise, we noticed that the fully modified GspB-F remained associated with Gly, the last glycosyltransferase; essentially, all G3 species could be recovered with a fusion of Gly with glutathione S-transferase (Gly-GST), followed by binding to a glutathione resin (Fig. 2A, lane 2). In contrast, neither GtfA/B (10Chen Y. Seepersaud R. Bensing B.A. Sullam P.M. Rapoport T.A. Mechanism of a cytosolic O-glycosyltransferase essential for the synthesis of a bacterial adhesion protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The material bound to Gly-GST could be partially released from the beads with a 100-fold excess of full-length Gly (Fig. 2B, lane 4) but not with the isolated C-terminal GT-D domain (lane 2). These data suggest that the modified substrate is reversibly bound by the N-terminal GT-A/B domains. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the isolated GT-D domain can generate the G3 species but does not interact strongly with it, as demonstrated by the absence of competition with the full-length Gly protein (Fig. 2C, lane 1). This experiment also shows that the binding of Gly to its enzymatic product is separable from the modification reaction per se. In our system, product binding by the N-terminal GT-A/B domains does not interfere with the enzymatic activity of the C-terminal GT-D domain, because Gly is in large excess over substrate and the N-terminal domains binds reversibly to the product. Next, we tested the role of the Asps. Neither of the three Asps had an effect on the glycosylation reactions catalyzed by GtfA/B, Nss, or Gly (Fig. S4). However, the complex of the three Asps released the fully glycosylated G3 species from Gly-GST (Fig. 2D, lane 4). Asp1 alone or a complex of Asp1 and Asp3 (Asp1/3) was inactive in the release reaction (Fig. 2D, lanes 2 and 3). These results suggest that the complex of all three Asp proteins may be involved in the transfer of glycosylated substrate from the last glycosyltransferase to the next step in the export pathway. Because our data suggest that the Asp complex can accept fully glycosylated substrate from Gly, we suspected that it can interact with carbohydrates. To test this possibility, we determined the crystal structures of Asp1 alone (resolution of 2.77 Å) and of an Asp1/3 complex (resolution of 3.11 Å) (Table S1). The structure of Asp1 is similar to that of GtfA and GtfB (Fig. 3, A, B, and F)., Like GtfA or GtfB, Asp1 has two Rossmann-like folds (R-folds I and II), which are typical for the GT-B family of glycosyltransferases (Fig. 3A). In addition, it has the typical extended β-sheet domain (EBD). Together, these domains form a U-shaped structure. As in the enzymatically inactive GtfB protein, the cleft between R-folds I and II is negatively charged (Fig. 3B). In contrast, GtfA and other enzymatically active GT-B family members have a positively charged cleft that is required to bind UDP-sugars (Fig. 3B). Like GtfB, Asp1 lacks two positively charged residues in the active site and has a Gln residue at position 438 in place of an essential Glu residue (Fig. 3B, lower panels). The structure thus supports the idea that Asp1, like GtfB, is a carbohydrate-binding protein, rather than an active glycosyltransferase. Consistent with the postulated substrate-binding site, when two conserved Asp residues in the cleft between the R-folds were mutated to Arg, secretion of GspB-F from S. gordonii cells was abolished (Fig. 4, A and B; sequence alignment shown"

We aimed to compare the new 4-tiered classification (4TC) for LVH with the established 2-tiered classification (2TC) in a cohort of normotensive non-elite endurance athletes. Methods Male participants of a 10-mile race were recruited and included when blood pressure (BP) was normal (<140/90 mmHg). Phenotypic characterization of LVH was based on relative wall thickness (2TC), and on LV concentricity2/3 (LV mass/end-diastolic volume [LVM/EDV]2/3) plus LVEDV index (4TC). Parameters of LV geometry, BP, cumulative training hours, and race time were compared between 2TC and 4TC by analysis of variance, and post-hoc analysis. Results Of 198 athletes recruited, 174 were included. Mean age was 41.6±7.5 years. Forty-two (24%) athletes had LVH. Allocation in the 2TC was: 32 (76%) eccentric LVH and 10 (24%) concentric LVH. Using the 4TC 12 were reclassified to concentric LVH, and 2 to eccentric LVH, resulting in 22 (52%) eccentric LVH (7 non-dilated, 15 dilated), and 20 (48%) concentric LVH (all non-dilated). Based on the 2TC, markers of endurance training did not differ between eccentric and concentric LVH. Based on the 4TC, athletes with eccentric LVH had more cumulative training hours and faster race times, with highest values thereof in athletes with eccentric dilated LVH. Conclusions In our cohort of normotensive endurance athletes, the new 4TC demonstrated a superior discrimination of exercise-induced LVH patterns, compared to the established 2TC, most likely because it takes three-dimensional information of the ventricular geometry into account."

HBV genotypes have distinct geographic distributions and play a role in course of infection and treatment management. However, in Ethiopia there is paucity of information about distribution of HBV genotypes. This study was done to determine genotype, mutation and sero-virological profiles of HBV isolates in Southern Ethiopia. Cross-sectional, laboratory based study was conducted on 103HBsAg sero-positive samples from a total of 2,237 screened blood donors. HBV serological markers and biochemical assays were done. Serum viral load was measured using quantitative real-time PCR. Partial HBV S-gene was amplified with nested PCR and sequenced. Bioinformatics tools were utilized to determine genotypes, serotypes and mutations. Of 103 HBsAg reactive serum samples, 14.6% and 70.9% were sero-positive for HBeAg and HBeAb, respectively. Ninety-eight samples gave detectable viral load with a median of 3.46(2.62-4.82) log IU/ml. HBeAg sero-positive donors carried elevated levels of viral load. Eighty five isolates were successfully amplified, sequenced and genotyped into 58 (68.2%) genotype A (HBV/A) and 27 (31.8%) genotype D (HBV/D). HBV serotypes found were adw2 (74.1%), ayw2 (24.7%), and ayw3 (1.2%). In twenty-four (28.2%) samples mutations in the major hydrophilic region (MHR) were observed. Donors infected with HBV/A had higher viral load and more frequent MHR mutation than HBV/D infected donors. This study illustrated distribution of HBV genotype A and D among blood donors in southern Ethiopia. It also demonstrated occurrence HBV variants that may influence clinical aspects of HBV infection. The study contributes in narrowing the existing gap of HBV molecular study in Ethiopia."
https://openalex.org/W2790200707,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is the fourth-leading cause of cancer death in the United States with a 5-year overall survival rate of 8% for all stages combined. But this decreases to 3% for the majority of patients that present with stage IV PDA at time of diagnosis. The lack of distinct early symptoms for PDA is one of the primary reasons for the late diagnosis. Common symptoms like weight loss, abdominal and back pains, and jaundice are often mistaken for symptoms of other issues and do not appear until the cancer has progressed to a late stage. Thus the development of novel imaging platforms for PDA is crucial for the early detection of the disease. MUC1 is a tumor-associated antigen (tMUC1) expressed on 80% of PDA. The goal of this study was to determine the targeting and detection capabilities of a tMUC1 specific antibody, TAB004. TAB004 antibody conjugated to a near infrared fluorescent probe was injected intraperitoneally into immune competent orthotopic and spontaneous models of PDA. Results show that fluorophore conjugated TAB004 specifically targets a) 1 week old small tumor in the pancreas in an orthotopic PDA model and b) very early pre-neoplastic lesions (PanIN lesions) that develop in the spontaneous PDA model before progression to adenocarcinoma. Thus, TAB004 is a promising antibody to deliver imaging agents directly to the pancreatic tumor microenvironment, significantly affecting early detection of PDA."

Recent crystal structures of DNA-bound human flap endonuclease (hFEN1) offer new insights into how conformational changes in the DNA and hFEN1 may facilitate the reaction mechanism. For example, previous biochemical studies of DNA conformation performed under non-catalytic conditions with Ca2+ have suggested that base unpairing at the 5′-flap:template junction is an important step in the reaction, but the new structural data suggest otherwise. To clarify the role of DNA changes in the kinetic mechanism, we measured a series of transient steps, from substrate binding to product release, during the hFEN1-catalyzed reaction in the presence of Mg2+. We found that whereas hFEN1 binds and bends DNA at a fast, diffusion-limited rate, much slower Mg2+-dependent conformational changes in DNA around the active site are subsequently necessary and rate-limiting for 5′-flap cleavage. These changes are reported overall by fluorescence of 2-aminopurine at the 5′-flap:template junction, indicating that local DNA distortion (e.g. disruption of base stacking observed in structures), associated with positioning the 5′-flap scissile phosphodiester bond in the hFEN1 active site, controls catalysis. hFEN1 residues with distinct roles in the catalytic mechanism, including those binding metal ions (Asp-34 and Asp-181), steering the 5′-flap through the active site and binding the scissile phosphate (Lys-93 and Arg-100), and stacking against the base 5′ to the scissile phosphate (Tyr-40), all contribute to these rate-limiting conformational changes, ensuring efficient and specific cleavage of 5′-flaps.

In terms of local DNA conformation, changes in the exciton-coupled circular dichroic spectra (ECCD) of a pair of 2-aminopurine adenine analogs at −1/−2 or +1/−1 positions in the 5′-flap strand have been interpreted as unpairing of the last two base pairs at the 5′-flap:template junction needed to position the scissile phosphate in the active site (16Algasaier S.I.

Assuming that the ECCD signal of hFEN1-DNA complexes formed with Ca2+, which does not support catalysis, reports catalytically viable conformations, the studies indicate differential contributions of active-site residues to this process. On a single 3′-flap substrate analog missing the 5′-flap, mutations of Asp-181 (hFEN1D181A), which coordinates metal ion A to facilitate nucleophile formation, and Tyr-40 (hFEN1Y40A) appear to disrupt the proposed unpairing between +1/−1 bases in the 5′-flap strand and template, but mutations of Arg-100 (hFEN1R100A) and Lys-93 (hFEN1K93A) have little to no disruptive effect, respectively. On a 5′/3′ double-flap substrate, hFEN1R100A and hFEN1Y40A partially disrupt the proposed base unpairing (16Algasaier S.I. Exell J.C. Bennet I.A. Thompson M.J. Gotham V.J. Shaw S.J. Craggs T.D.

These equilibrium binding data were supported by the structure of a wildtype hFEN1-nicked product complex in which the −1 base in the 5′-flap strand was unpaired from the template (18Tsutakawa S.E.

A more recent structure of hFEN1R100A-DNA substrate complex also has the 5′-flap strand +1 and −1 bases unpaired from the template as it threads through the cap-helical gateway; however, the scissile phosphate remains ∼4–5 Å away from the metal ions in the active site, suggesting that this conformation is not catalytically competent (12Tsutakawa S.E.

More significantly, the structure of an hFEN1D86N-DNA substrate complex shows the scissile phosphate coordinated to metal ion A, indicating a catalytically competent conformation, but the +1 and −1 bases remain paired to the template strand (Fig. 1C; PDB code 5UM9; metal ion B is absent because the Asp-86 ligand is mutated to Asn) (12Tsutakawa S.E.

Hellinga H.W. Beese L.S. Interplay of catalysis, fidelity, threading, and processivity in the exo- and endonucleolytic reactions of human exonuclease I. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Despite the intact base pairing, both 5′-flap and template strands are distorted around the scissile phosphate, such that stacking is disrupted between the +1 and −1 bases and absent between the −1 and −2 bases in the 5′-flap strand, and the −2 base stacks with the template strand instead. There is also a dramatic inversion of the phosphodiester backbone between the +1 and +2 nucleotides under the cap-helical gateway, such that the +2 base is flipped outward (Fig. 1, B and C); this inversion, observed in hExo1-DNA structures as well, is proposed to protect the 5′-flap from premature cleavage during the threading process. In the hFEN1D86N-DNA substrate structure and that of an hFEN1D233N-DNA product complex (Fig. 1C; PDB code 5K97), basic residues lining the cap-helical gateway, including Lys-93 and Arg-100, appear necessary to electrostatically steer the phosphodiester backbone into a catalytically competent conformation, with the scissile phosphate coordinated by the metal ions and a nucleophilic water within striking distance in the active site. Meanwhile, Tyr-40 adopts different rotamer conformations, stacked with the +1 base of the double-flap substrate or the −1 base of the nicked duplex product, suggesting that this residue helps lock the junction in position before and after catalysis (12Tsutakawa S.E.

Because the structural data imply that Lys-93, Arg-100, and Tyr-40 play important roles in the hFEN1-DNA complex achieving a catalytically competent state, the relatively mild effects of their mutations reported by the ECCD signal are somewhat surprising (16Algasaier S.I.

Moreover, because the DNA binding studies of hFEN1 were conducted in equilibrium under non-catalytic conditions with Ca2+, the significance of the proposed conformational changes for the hFEN1 kinetic mechanism is not fully understood. To address this gap in our knowledge, we examined multiple steps of the hFEN1 reaction, from substrate binding to product release and any associated DNA isomerization, under catalytic conditions with Mg2+ by ensemble stopped-flow and rapid-quench experiments. We also examined active-site residue mutants of hFEN1 under these conditions to parse their contributions to the kinetic mechanism. The results show that after the bent DNA complex is formed at a diffusion-limited rate, slower Mg2+-specific local changes in the 5′-flap:template junction conformation limit the rate of catalysis. These changes are reported by unquenching of 2-aminopurine fluorescence, implying that they involve changes in the extent of base stacking at the junction, as suggested by the structural data (12Tsutakawa S.E.

In addition, active-site residues known for distinct roles in the catalytic mechanism all contribute to this rate-limiting stage of the 5′-flap cleavage mechanism. We monitored individual steps in the hFEN1-catalyzed reaction with a variety of fluorophore-labeled DNAs to investigate the order and significance of DNA conformational changes in the kinetic mechanism. Transient kinetic measurements from ensemble stopped-flow and rapid-quench experiments yielded rate constants for multiple steps in the reaction, from substrate binding to product release, revealing rate-limiting steps that control catalysis and turnover.

Recently, GALR1 was also suggested as a tumor suppressor gene that was frequently silenced in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; moreover, galanin and GALR1 were reported to inhibit human oral cancer cell proliferation. However, the exact role of galanin in gastric cancer is unclear. Here, we describe the epigenetic silencing of galanin in human gastric cancer. Five gastric cancer cell lines (SNU-1, SNU-601, SNU-638, KATOIII, and AGS) showed a significant reduction in galanin expression that was restored by the demethylating agent 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine. We confirmed the hypermethylation of CpG islands in the galanin promoter region by methylation-specific and bisulfate sequencing polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Interestingly, hypermethylated galanin did not affect galanin receptor expression. Exogenous galanin expression in silenced cells induced apoptosis and decreased phosphorylated Akt expression. Taken together, these data suggest that galanin hypermethylation impairs its tumor suppressor function in gastric cancer carcinogenesis."

The FISH results showed that the total number of microorganisms ranges from 2.3×102 to 4.0×108 cells per gram of sample during fermentation and is mainly dominated by fungi. In the early fermentation stages, molds are dominant (0.6×102~2.8×106 cells/g, 0~35 d). However, in the late stages of fermentation, yeasts are dominant (3.6×104~9.6×106 cells/g, 35~56 d). The bacteria have little effect during the fermentation of tea (102~103 cells/g, <1% of fungus values). Of these fungi, A. niger (Aspergillus niger) and B. adeninivorans (Blastobotrys adeninivorans) are identified as the two most common strains, based on Next-generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis.

The population was 74% male, 30.5% in CDC stage C, with median age of 52 years (48.0–56.5) and median liver stiffness of 7.8 kPa (6.7–9.2). Median baseline eGFR was 102.0 (90.8–108.1), changing to 99.8 (83.5–104.8) at the end of treatment (EoT), and 100.0 (87.3–105.6) 12 weeks after the EoT (FU12), p<0.0001. No patient had grade 3–4 increase of creatinine. At EoT 60/144 (41.7%) patients had ≥ 5% reduction in their eGFR, confirmed at FU12 in 39/60 (65.0%) cases. Longer duration of HCV infection (cut-off 12.9 years), lower HCV-RNA viral load (cut-off 1,970,160 IU/ml) and lower platelet count (cut-off 167,000 x106/L) were significantly associated with eGFR decline at logistic analysis (adjOR 2.9, 95%CI 1.0–8.8, p = 0.05; adjOR 3.5, 95%CI 1.2–10.4, p = 0.02; adjOR 2.8, 95%CI 1.1–6.8, p = 0.03, respectively). After repeating the analysis throughout a mixed model, a higher eGFR decline was highlighted in patients concomitantly treated with tenofovir (p = 0.0001), ribavirin (p = 0.0001), or integrase inhibitors (p <0.0001), with longer duration of HIV (p = 0.0002) and HCV infection (p = 0.035), lower baseline HCV RNA (p <0.0001), previous HCV treatment (p<0.0001), and older age (p<0.0001). In conclusion, our study confirms a good renal safety profile of OBV/PTV/r + DSV treatment in HIV/HCV patients, and the median decline of 2 ml/min in eGFR, albeit statistically significant, is of doubtful clinical significance. The role of aging, concomitant therapies and duration of HIV/HCV infection needs to be further investigated."

To test this idea, we asked whether rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) show choice behavior that is similar to humans in response to sex and social status in advertising. Our results show that monkeys form preferences for brand logos repeatedly paired with images of macaque genitals and high status monkeys. Moreover, monkeys sustain preferences for these brand logos even though choosing them provided no tangible rewards, a finding that cannot be explained by a decision mechanism operating solely on material outcomes. Together, our results endorse the hypothesis that the power of sex and status in advertising emerges from the spontaneous engagement of shared, ancestral neural circuits that prioritize information useful for navigating the social environment.

In this study, we found that while T cells were decreased, the frequency of thymic B cells was greatly increased in these mutants in the perinatal period. We used this model to characterize the mechanisms in the thymus controlling B cell development.Foxn1lacZ mutants, T cell committed intrathymic progenitors (DN1a,b) were progressively reduced beginning one week after birth, while thymic B cells peaked at 3-4 weeks with pre-B-II progenitor phenotype, and originated in the thymus. Heterochronic chimeras showed that the capacity for thymic B cell production was due to a combination of higher B potential of neonatal HSCs, combined with a thymic microenvironment deficiency including reduction of DL4 and increase of IL-7 that promoted B cell fate.Our findings indicate that the capacity and time course for thymic B-cell production are primarily controlled by the hematopoietic-intrinsic potential for B cells themselves during ontogeny, but that signals from TECs microenvironment also influence the frequency and differentiation potential of B cell development in the thymus."
https://openalex.org/W2790639118,"Building prediction models based on complex omics datasets such as transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics remains a challenge in bioinformatics and biostatistics. Regularized regression techniques are typically used to deal with the high dimensionality of these datasets. However, due to the presence of correlation in the datasets, it is difficult to select the best model and application of these methods yields unstable results. We propose a novel strategy for model selection where the obtained models also perform well in terms of overall predictability. Several three step approaches are considered, where the steps are 1) network construction, 2) clustering to empirically derive modules or pathways, and 3) building a prediction model incorporating the information on the modules. For the first step, we use weighted correlation networks and Gaussian graphical modelling. Identification of groups of features is performed by hierarchical clustering. The grouping information is included in the prediction model by using group-based variable selection or group-specific penalization. We compare the performance of our new approaches with standard regularized regression via simulations. Based on these results we provide recommendations for selecting a strategy for building a prediction model given the specific goal of the analysis and the sizes of the datasets. Finally we illustrate the advantages of our approach by application of the methodology to two problems, namely prediction of body mass index in the DIetary, Lifestyle, and Genetic determinants of Obesity and Metabolic syndrome study (DILGOM) and prediction of response of each breast cancer cell line to treatment with specific drugs using a breast cancer cell lines pharmacogenomics dataset."
https://openalex.org/W2794278059,"Rift Valley fever (RVF) is endemic in Africa and parts of the Middle East. It is an emerging zoonotic disease threat to veterinary and public health. Outbreaks of the disease have severe socio-economic impacts. RVF virus emergence is closely associated with specific endorheic wetlands that are utilized by the virus' mosquito vectors. Limited botanical vegetation surveys had been published with regard to RVF virus (RVFV) ecology. We report on a phytosociological classification, analysis and description of wetland vegetation and related abiotic parameters to elucidate factors possibly associated with the 2010-2011 RVFV disease outbreak in South Africa. The study sites were located in the western Free State and adjacent Northern Cape covering an area of ~40,000 km2 with wetlands associated with high RVF mortality rates in livestock. Other study sites included areas where no RVF activity was reported during the 2010-11 RVF outbreak. A total of 129 plots (30 m2) were selected where a visible difference could be seen in the wetland and upland vegetation. The Braun-Blanquet method was used for plant sampling. Classification was done using modified Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis. The vegetation analysis resulted in the identification of eight plant communities, seven sub-communities and two variants. Indirect ordination was carried out using CANOCO to investigate the relationship between species and wetland ecology. The study also identified 5 categories of wetlands including anthropogenic wetlands. Locations of reported RVF cases overlapped sites characterized by high clay-content soils and specific wetland vegetation. These findings indicate ecological and environmental parameters that represent preferred breeding habitat for RVFV competent mosquito vectors."
https://openalex.org/W2793149001,"In this paper, we propose a connectivity-preserving flocking algorithm for multi-agent systems in which the neighbor set of each agent is determined by the hybrid metric-topological distance so that the interaction topology can be represented as the range-limited Delaunay graph, which combines the properties of the commonly used disk graph and Delaunay graph. As a result, the proposed flocking algorithm has the following advantages over the existing ones. First, range-limited Delaunay graph is sparser than the disk graph so that the information exchange among agents is reduced significantly. Second, some links irrelevant to the connectivity can be dynamically deleted during the evolution of the system. Thus, the proposed flocking algorithm is more flexible than existing algorithms, where links are not allowed to be disconnected once they are created. Finally, the multi-agent system spontaneously generates a regular quasi-lattice formation without imposing the constraint on the ratio of the sensing range of the agent to the desired distance between two adjacent agents. With the interaction topology induced by the hybrid distance, the proposed flocking algorithm can still be implemented in a distributed manner. We prove that the proposed flocking algorithm can steer the multi-agent system to a stable flocking motion, provided the initial interaction topology of multi-agent systems is connected and the hysteresis in link addition is smaller than a derived upper bound. The correctness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm are verified by extensive numerical simulations, where the flocking algorithms based on the disk and Delaunay graph are compared."
https://openalex.org/W2786184336,"Most newly synthesized proteins destined for the secretory pathway contain a signal peptide (SP) that triggers cotranslational translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, how small polypeptides undergo ER translocation is not fully understood. In this issue of JBC, Guo et al. describe a mechanism for posttranslational translocation of small secretory proteins featuring a positive charge within the SP N-terminal region. Defects in this element disrupt proper secretion and explain the effects of genetic mutations associated with one type of diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2789613170,"The postnatal thymus is an efficient microenvironment for T cell specification and differentiation. B cells are also present in the thymus and have been recently shown to impact T cell selection, however, the mechanisms controlling B cell development in the thymus are largely unknown. In Foxn1lacZ mutant mice, down-regulation of Foxn1 expression in thymic epithelial cells beginning 1 week after birth caused a dramatic reduction of T progenitors and an increase of B cell progenitors. This time point is coincident with the switch from fetal to adult-type hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which is regulated by the Lin28-Let7 system. We hypothesize that the thymic environment might regulate this process to suppress fetal-type B cell development in the thymus. In this study we show that in the Foxn1lacZ thymus, although the down-regulation of Lin28 in thymocytes was normal, up-regulation of Let-7 was impaired. The failure to up-regulate Let-7 caused a transient increase of Arid3a in B precursors, which is known to promote fetal-type B cell fate. Over-expression of Lin28a in HSCs also reduced Let-7 and promoted Arid3a expression in BM and thymic B progenitors, increasing B cell production in the thymus. The level of Let-7 in thymic B progenitors was up regulated by in vitro co-culture with IL15, Vitamin-D3, and retinoic acid, thus down-regulating Arid3a to promote B cell differentiation. All of these signals were produced in thymic epithelial cells (TECs) related to Let-7 expression in thymic B progenitors, and down-regulated in Foxn1lacZ mutants. Our data show that signals provided by TEC control thymic B cell development by up-regulating Let-7, suppressing Arid3a expression in intrathymic progenitor B cells to limit their proliferation during the neonatal to adult transition."
https://openalex.org/W2789621977,"There is no evidence-based definition of the temperature limit defining fever (TLDF) in children with neutropenia. Lowering the TLDF is known to increase the number of episodes of fever in neutropenia (FN). This study aimed to investigate the influence of a lower versus standard TLDF on diagnostics and therapy.In a single pediatric cancer center using a high standard TLDF (39°C tympanic-temperature) patients were observed prospectively (NCT01683370). The effect of applying lower TLDFs (range 37.5°C to 38.9°C) versus 39.0°C on these measures was simulated in silicon.In reality, 45 FN episodes were diagnosed. Of 3391 temperatures measured, 193 were ≥39.0°C, and 937 ≥38.0°C. For persisting fever ≥24 hours, additional blood cultures were taken in 31 (69%) episodes in reality. This number decreased to 22 (49%) when applying 39.0°C, and increased to 33 for 38.0°C (73%; plus 11 episodes; plus 24%). For persisting fever ≥48 hours, i.v.-antibiotics were escalated in 25 (56%) episodes. This number decreased to 15 (33%) when applying 39.0°C, and increased to 26 for 38.0°C (58%; plus 11 episodes; plus 24%). For persisting fever ≥120 hours, i.v.-antifungals were added in 4 (9%) episodes. This number increased to 6 (13%) by virtually applying 39.0°C, and to 11 for 38.0°C (24%; plus 5 episodes; plus 11%). The median length of stay was 5.7 days (range, 0.8 to 43.4). In 43 episodes with hospital discharge beyond 24 hours, applying 38.0°C led to discharge delay by ≥12 hours in 24 episodes (56%; 95% CI, 40 to 71), with a median delay of 13 hours, and a cumulative delay of 68 days.Applying a low versus standard TLDF led to relevant increases of diagnostics, antimicrobial therapy, and length of stay. The differences between management in reality versus simply applying 39.0° as TLDF reflect the important impact of clinical assessment."
https://openalex.org/W2793809737,"Myocardial infarction (MI) causes significant loss of cardiomyocytes, myocardial tissue damage, and impairment of myocardial function. The inability of cardiomyocytes to proliferate prevents the heart from self-regeneration. The treatment for advanced heart failure following an MI is heart transplantation despite the limited availability of the organs. Thus, stem-cell-based cardiac therapies could ultimately prevent heart failure by repairing injured myocardium that reverses cardiomyocyte loss. However, stem-cell-based therapies lack understanding of the mechanisms behind a successful therapy, including difficulty tracking stem cells to provide information on cell migration, proliferation and differentiation. In this study, we have investigated the interaction between different types of stem and inflammatory cells and cell-targeted imaging molecules, 18F-FDG and 6-NBDG, to identify uptake patterns and pharmacokinetics in vitro.Macrophages (both M1 and M2), human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), and human amniotic mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs) were incubated with either 18F-FDG or 6-NBDG. Excess radiotracer and fluorescence were removed and a 100 μm-thin CdWO4 scintillator plate was placed on top of the cells for radioluminescence microscopy imaging of 18F-FDG uptake, while no scintillator was needed for fluorescence imaging of 6-NBDG uptake. Light produced following beta decay was imaged with a highly sensitive inverted microscope (LV200, Olympus) and an Electron Multiplying Charge-Couple Device (EM-CCD) camera. Custom-written software was developed in MATLAB for image processing.The average cellular activity of 18F-FDG in a single cell of hAMSCs (0.670±0.028 fCi/μm2, P = 0.001) was 20% and 36% higher compared to uptake in hiPSCs (0.540±0.026 fCi/μm2, P = 0.003) and macrophages (0.430±0.023 fCi/μm2, P = 0.002), respectively. hAMSCs exhibited the slowest influx (0.210 min-1) but the fastest efflux (0.327 min-1) rate compared to the other tested cell lines for 18F-FDG. This cell line also has the highest phosphorylation but exhibited the lowest rate of de-phosphorylation. The uptake pattern for 6-NBDG was very different in these three cell lines. The average cellular activity of 6-NBDG in a single cell of macrophages (0.570±0.230 fM/μm2, P = 0.004) was 38% and 14% higher compared to hiPSCs (0.350±0.160 fM/μm2, P = 0.001) and hAMSCs (0.490±0.028 fM/μm2, P = 0.006), respectively. The influx (0.276 min-1), efflux (0.612 min-1), phosphorylation (0.269 min-1), and de-phosphorylation (0.049 min-1) rates were also highest for macrophages compared to the other two tested cell lines.hAMSCs were found to be 2-3× more sensitive to 18F-FDG molecule compared to hiPSCs/macrophages. However, macrophages exhibited the most sensitivity towards 6-NBDG. Based on this result, hAMSCs targeted with 18F-FDG could be more suitable for understanding the mechanisms behind successful therapy for treating MI patients by gathering information on cell migration, proliferation and differentiation."
