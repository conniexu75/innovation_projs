https://openalex.org/W2154896616,"Once upon a time philosophers and cosmographers insisted that the motions of the planets must be circular and uniform. An irrelevant aesthetic concept of ‘perfection’ and a more valid mathematical need for simplicity were at the root of this long-held error. Nowadays, theoretical cosmologists insist that the large-scale distribution of galaxies most be homogeneous and isotropic, and most astonomers believe that the expansion of the universe is linear and isotropic and that it proceeds at a uniform rate measured by the Hubble ‘constant’ H.1, 2"

A granulocytopenia, leukopenia, hypocellularity of bone marrow and, occasionally, an anemia. 2. Hyalinization, necrosis and calcification of voluntary muscle. 3. Hyaline sclerosis and calcification of blood vessels. 4. A dermatitis which can be prevented or successfully treated with crystalline biotin. We have also observed necrosis of heart muscle, hemorrhage into various organs and subcutaneous tissues, and liver damage."

https://openalex.org/W2045480943,"The following facts are those which are put forth through paleontological observation, for verification by others: 1. That many origins of new characters are through some internal action in heredity. 2. That many important adaptive characters arise determinately, definitely, but by extremely slow stages. 3. That degrees of similarity in such origins correspond with degrees of kinship. 4. That degrees of kinship also affect to a certain extent, but not absolutely the time of appearance, or the time of the origin, or the rate of evolution. 5. That such origins find expression not sponta. neously, or irrespective of conditions, or from purely internal mechanical causes, but through some entirely unknown and at present inconceivable relation to ontogeny (habit and use), to environment (external conditions), and to selection. 6. That if such origins do spring from internal hereditary principles, as they appear to do in many eases, slow origins (mutations of de Vries) may be simply due to the same law operating with a different velocity."
