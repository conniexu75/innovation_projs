Administration of either rapidly elevates stereospecific [3H]dihydromorphine binding to mouse brain extracts by 40 to 100 percent, but antagonists are 10 to 1000 times more potent than agonists; as little as 0.02 milligram of naloxone per kilogram of body weight significantly enhances opiate receptor binding. Sodium enhances antagonist binding in vitro but decreases agonist binding, a qualitative difference that may be relevant to the divergent pharmacological properties of opiate agonists and antagonists."
https://openalex.org/W1532992926,"Abstract Differential scanning calorimetry has been applied to the study of some simple model biomembranes, i.e. lipid-water systems, and the endothermic phase transitions which they exhibit when transforming from the gel to liquid crystal phase have been studied. These studies show that: 1. When lipids of the same class, e.g. lecithins with dissimilar chain lengths C14 and C16 are mixed, a continuous series of solid solutions are formed below the Tc line and co-crystallization occurs. No great change in the range of the thermal transition occurs as a result of the mixing. 2. When lipids of different classes, i.e. lecithin and phosphatidylethanolamine classes but of the same chain length, are mixed, a considerable increase in transition range occurs. Clusters of gel and liquid crystalline lipids can coexist within this temperature range. 3. Small amounts of 1,2-dimyristoyl phosphatidylethanolamine present in a lecithin bilayer cause pronounced effects associated with the head group transition of the lecithin. This appears to be an example of a more general effect, i.e. the presence of small amounts of a foreign molecule in a membrane surface can sometimes affect the packing of the polar groups of many other lipid molecules in the surface. 4. Interactions of divalent cations with the polar groups of the lipids raise the gel to liquid crystalline transition temperature. This behavior parallels the properties observed in monolayer systems. 5. Electrostatic binding of proteins and basic polypeptides to the (anionic) polar groups of phospholipids shifts the temperature of the gel-liquid crystal transition of the lipid and also affects the energy barrier for reorientation of a spin label in the hydrocarbon phase. This behavior may be relevant to the interpretation of thermal transitions observed with some biomembranes. 6. Admixture of the ionophore gramicidin A with dipalmitoyl lecithin at low concentrations affects the lipid polar group packing and at higher concentrations causes a marked decrease in the energy associated with the lipid endothermic phase transition. This effect may occur because of intercalation of gramicidine A molecules among the lipid chains."

Lysosomes of activated macrophages are secreted directly into the cytoplasm of susceptible target cells, which subsequently undergo heterolysis. This reaction can be inhibited by agents which prevent the exocytosis of macrophage lysosomes (hydrocortisone) or which interfere with the action of lysosomal enzymes (trypan blue)."

https://openalex.org/W1528852151,"Abstract Myelin basic protein, an encephalitogenic protein, was phosphorylated by adenosine 3' : 5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP)-dependent protein kinase from bovine brain, and its phosphorylation was stimulated by cyclic AMP. The ability of the protein to serve as substrate for the protein kinase was comparable to that of histone fractions and better than that of casein, protamine, or phosvitin. The apparent Km of the enzyme for the protein was 2 x 10-5 m. The protein phosphorylated by the protein kinase showed a different migration on disc gel electrophoresis from that of the native protein, suggesting that the modification of the protein molecule by phosphorylation resulted in an alteration of physicochemical properties of the protein. The protein caused the activation of the protein kinase, and preincubation of the enzyme with the protein resulted in a substantial increase of cyclic AMP-independent activity. Protein kinase modulator inhibited the enzyme activity in the presence or absence of cyclic AMP when myelin basic protein was used as substrate. Amino acid residues of myelin basic protein which were phosphorylated by bovine brain protein kinase were seryl and threonyl. The maximum amount of phosphate incorporated into the protein was 3.80 moles per mole of protein, which was 3.6 times higher than that incorporated into histone on the basis of weight. Native myelin basic protein contained 0.20 mole of phosphorus per mole of protein, of which 0.07 and 0.09 mole were associated with phosphoserine and phosphothreonine, respectively. An extensively washed myelin fraction contained an endogenous protein kinase which catalyzed the endogenous phosphorylation of myelin basic protein in the presence of ATP and Mg2+. In vivo phosphorylation of myelin basic protein was observed by injection of [32P]orthophosphate into the ventricle of rat brain. Myelin basic protein fraction showed the highest specific radioactivity on the basis of protein amount, compared to that of crude homogenate and myelin fraction. Incorporated phosphate was released in the course of time. The results indicate that the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of myelin basic protein may be in a dynamic state and that the turnover rate of phosphate in the protein may be relatively rapid."
https://openalex.org/W1583446932,"Cathepsin D, purified from bovine and rabbit liver, hydrolyzed primarily one peptide bond in the A1 protein from bovine central nervous system myelin, the Phe-Phe bond between residues 42 and 43. Surprisingly, the other Phe-Phe linkage (residues 88 to 89) was not cleaved. In view of the high affinity of cathepsin D for the Phe-Phe bond, it was postulated that the resistant linkage was protected from enzymic attack either by the influence of surrounding amino acids or by conformational restrictions. The two peptides (Peptides CD1 and CD2), resulting from the action of bovine liver cathepsin D, were obtained in high yield by cellulose phosphate chromatography and shown to be homogeneous by gel electrophoresis at pH 4.5 and in sodium dodecyl sulfate. Peptide CD1 was identified as residues 1 to 42 and Peptide CD2 as residues 43 to 169 of the A1 protein sequence. The identity of Peptides CD1 and CD2 was established by end group analysis, by molecular weights obtained from sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, by amino acid analysis, and finally by peptide mapping of tryptic digests and analysis of each peptide. The amino acid analysis of each tryptic peptide was in excellent agreement with that expected from the position of the peptide on the peptide map. Peptide CD1, the 42-residue peptide, has special immunological significance since it contains a minor determinant responsible for allergic encephalomyelitis in the monkey. It also contains an antigenic determinant which displaces 80% of labeled A1 protein from rabbit antibody."

https://openalex.org/W1566949230,"Abstract Membrane vesicles from Escherichia coli have been shown to accumulate sugars and amino acids in response to an artificially imposed membrane potential, in the absence of any metabolizable substrate. Membrane vesicles were first loaded with K+ by incubation at 40° in 0.5 m potassium phosphate and then transferred to K+-free medium. Addition of the potassium ionophores valinomycin, monactin, or enniatin elicited rapid efflux of K+ ions, down the concentration gradient, with the generation of a membrane potential, interior negative. These potassium ionophores also induced concentrative uptake of amino acids and sugars by the vesicles. By contrast, nigericin and monensin, which catalyze electrically neutral exchange of K+ or Na+ for H+, did not induce metabolite accumulation. Accumulation of proline in response to valinomycin was a function of the gradient of K+ concentration across the membrane. Accumulation was not affected by inhibitors of the respiratory chain nor by N, N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, but was completely abolished by reagents which render the membrane permeable to protons or which inhibit the transport carrier itself. The optimal external pH for valinomycin-induced proline uptake lay between 7 and 8; in addition, membrane vesicles prepared so as to create an alkaline lumen accumulated proline better than did those whose lumen pH was acid. The results suggest that the driving force for proline accumulation is the electrical potential; a pH gradient is not required. Potassium-loaded vesicles, prepared from a mutant defective in proline transport, failed to accumulate proline in response to valinomycin, but did accumulate glycine and thiomethyl-β-d-galactoside. This and other experiments with mutants and inhibitors strongly suggest that the accumulation driven by an artificial membrane potential is mediated by the physiological transport systems. The results are consistent with the chemiosmotic interpretation of metabolite transport by membrane vesicles."

https://openalex.org/W1577778242,"Direct determination of fibrinopeptides A and B in purified plasmic degradation products of human fibrinogen shows that fibrinogen and Fragments X and Y contain 2 moles of fibrinopeptide A per mole; Fragment E has approximately 0.3 mole of fibrinopeptide A per mole. Fibrinopeptide B is present in only trace amount in some Fragment X preparations and is absent from Fragments Y and E. Fragment D contains neither fibrinopeptide A nor B. These data and the results on molecular weight, carbohydrate content, and reactivity with thrombin of polypeptide chains of the purified degradation products were used to assign these chains to the Aα, Bβ, or γ chains of the original fibrinogen molecule. Fragment X has altered Aα chains with a molecular weight of 25,000, Bβ chains that are either intact (58,000) or cleaved at the NH2-terminal end (53,000), and γ chains that are either intact (48,000) or cleaved at the COOH-terminal end (40,000). Fragment Y has two distinct sets of polypeptide chains; the heavier ones are almost the same as those of the smallest Fragment X species. The lighter chains of Fragment Y are similar to those of Fragment E, which has three major components of 13,000, 8,000, and 10,000 assigned tentatively as Aα, Bβ, and γ fibrinogen chain remnants, respectively. The chains of Fragment D have been classified as a 13,000 molecular weight α chain remnant, a 42,000 β chain remnant and a heterogeneous group (39,000, 32,000, and 26,000) of γ chain remnants. The presence of 2 moles of fibrinopeptide A per mole of Fragment Y and the demonstration of the heavy and light sets of polypeptide chains in Fragment Y provide substantive evidence for its asymmetric structure."
https://openalex.org/W1551634200,"The ability of immunoglobulin E (IgE) to bind to the cell membrane of basophiles and mast cells is progressively lost when the molecule is heated at 56°. In the present study, we have investigated the structural changes induced by heating under conditions known to destroy this biological function, although direct measurements of cytotropic activity were not made. After 30 min at 56° circular dichroism spectrum of intact IgE showed changes in both the aromatic side chain and peptide bond spectral regions. These effects were only partially reversible upon cooling to 25°. Ultraviolet absorption difference spectra suggested that tyrosine and tryptophan residues were exposed following the heat treatment. The structural effects observed upon heating could be reversed by complete unfolding in guanidine HCl and subsequent refolding upon removal of the guanidine. Parallel studies with proteolytic fragments of IgE (F(ab′)2, Fc′′, and Fc) indicated that the irreversible thermal effects were restricted to the COOH-terminal region of the heavy (e) chain of IgE. F(ab′)2 and Fc′′ underwent fully reversible conformational changes at 56°, as judged by circular dichroism and difference spectra. The irreversible transition seen in IgE was localized in the Fc region, which is known to carry the cytophilic site. Antigenic analysis showed that determinants localized in the Fc′′ region were unaffected by exposure to 56° for up to 150 min. However, determinants restricted to the two COOH-terminal domains of the e chain were progressively lost upon heating IgE over the same time period. The data indicate that the thermal sensitivity of IgE is restricted to that region which interacts with cell membranes and is not due to a general unfolding of the molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2012038863,"The amino terminal sequences of five light and heavy immunoglobulin chains from myeloma proteins of the BALB/c mouse with binding activity to phosphorylcholine are presented. Except for a single substitution in position 4, all five heavy chains have identical amino terminal sequences through the first hypervariable region. Proteins which share unique (idiotypic) antigenic determinants are identical through the first hypervariable region of their light and heavy chains. Proteins with differing idiotypic determinants have light chains of differing amino acid sequence. These observations suggest that the heavy chain plays a more important role than the light chain in determining the phosphorylcholine binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1594236372,"Abstract We have studied the accumulation of amino acids by a strain of Streptococcus faecalis (faecium) which does not carry out oxidative phosphorylation but relies upon glycolysis for metabolic energy. In the absence of exogenous substrate, cells take up limited amounts of glycine, l-alanine, l-serine, and l-threonine by exchange for components of the free amino acid pool. Net flux is much slower. When an energy source is provided, extensive net uptake takes place. Glycine and threonine accumulate largely as such, attaining concentration gradients of about 400 between cytoplasm and medium. Glycine, alanine, serine, and threonine undergo reciprocal exchange in starving cells, suggesting that they share a common transport system. A mutant, isolated by virtue of its resistance to cycloserine, was severely deficient in the transport of all four amino acids, both in the presence and in absence of an energy source. It thus appears that there is a single transport system for these amino acids, which can operate in two modes: tightly coupled exchange which is independent of metabolism, and net uptake linked to energy generation. The energy donor for metabolic accumulation is most probably ATP. Inhibition of accumulation by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide further implicates the membrane-bound ATPase in coupling glycolysis to the transport system. No evidence for an obligatory involvement of either K+ or Na+ was obtained, but inhibition by uncouplers strongly suggests that protons play a key role in energy coupling of amino acid transport. The effects of ionophores on amino acid accumulation are best understood in terms of Mitchell's chemiosmotic hypothesis: extrusion of protons by the ATPase would generate a gradient of pH and of electrical potential (proton-motive force) across the membrane and establish a circulation of protons which is the immediate driving force for active transport. Metabolic accumulation (unlike exchange in starving cells) was totally blocked by proton-conducting uncouplers. These also induced release of glycine and threonine previously accumulated by the cells. Nigericin also inhibited accumulation and elicited release, but valinomycin and monactin were severely inhibitory only at K+ concentrations comparable to those in the cytoplasm. These and other results suggest that the membrane potential is the primary component of the proton-motive force. A pH gradient is not obligatory, but an alkaline cytoplasm may well be necessary. Accumulation of threonine and glycine could be elicited even in starving cells, by artificially imposing an electrical potential across the membrane. This was done by addition of valinomycin to K+-loaded cells suspended in a medium free of K+, so as to induce K+ efflux. Accumulation under these conditions did not involve ATP or the ATPase, but was sensitive to proton-conducting uncouplers. We believe that the electrical potential supports accumulation by co-transport of the substrate with protons, as envisaged in the chemiosmotic hypothesis."

https://openalex.org/W2018057395,"Thymus lymphocytes of normal adult rats were autosensitized in vitro against soluble antigens extracted from the brains of syngeneic rats. Injection of the autosensitized lymphocytes into syngeneic rats led to the development of brain lesions suggestive of autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Injection of control lymphocytes or the antigen extract alone did not cause lesions. Since sensitization in vitro requires the presence of lymphocytes programmed with specific receptors, the results indicate that normal rats have lymphocytes capable of recognizing central nervous system self-antigens. Hence, regulatory mechanisms, inoperative in vitro, probably function in vivo to prevent immune activation of self-recognizing lymphocytes and autoimmunity. This concept suggests a new approach to exploring the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases."

It is postulated that the immunochemical difference between S. cerevisiae X2180 and strain 4484-24D (Antalis, C., Fogel, S., and Ballou, C. E. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 4655–4659) results from the presence or absence of this single enzyme. In its absence, the mannosylphosphate groups that are added to mannotriose side chains through the action of a mannosylphosphate transferase act as characteristic antigenic determinants in the 4484-24D mannan. However, in strain X2180, or in the hybrid diploid obtained by a cross of X2180 with 4484-24D, these mannosylphosphate groups are converted to α(1→3)-mannobiosylphosphate groups. In the resulting mannan, the various terminal α(1→3)-linked mannobiose units confer on the molecule a new immunological specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1802295832,"Abstract The general pattern of biosynthesis of the bluensidine (1D-1-O-carbamoyl-3-guanidino-3-deoxy-scyllo-inositol) moiety of bluensomycin, a monoguanidinated analogue of dihydrostreptomycin, has been studied in extracts of Streptomyces hygroscopicus forma glebosus ATCC 14607 (S. glebosus). Our results are consistent with the following biosynthetic pathway: myo-inositol (C)/→ keto-scyllo-inositol (D)/→ aminodeoxy-scyllo-inositol (E)/→ 1-amino-1-deoxy-scyllo-inositol-4-P (U)/→ 1D-1-O-carbamoyl-3-amino-3-deoxy-scyllo-inositol-6-P (F)/→ 1D-1-O-carbamoyl-3-guanidino-3-deoxy-scyllo-inositol-6-P →→ bluensomycin. A major uncertainty concerns the step (U) at which the carbamoyl group is introduced. Carbamoylation might occur, for example, prior to phosphorylation or following transamidination. myo-Inositol:NAD oxidoreductase activity (C) is reported for the first time in extracts of Streptomyces; activity was assayed by two radiochemical methods, both involving coupling with aminotransferase (D). l-Glutamine:keto-scyllo-inositol aminotransferase (D) was also found to catalyze aminodeoxy-scyllo-inositol:keto-scyllo-inositol, aminodeoxy-scyllo-inositol:pyruvate, and 1,3-diamino-1,3-dideoxy-scyllo-inositol:keto-scyllo-inositol transaminations. l-Arginine:inosamine-P amidinotransferase (F) catalyzed transamidinations with the following compounds as amidino acceptors: NH2OH, 1-amino-1-deoxy-scyllo-inositol-4-P, 1D-1-guanidino-3-amino-1,3-dideoxy-scyllo-inositol-6-P, 1D-1,3-diamino-1,3-dideoxy-scyllo-inositol-6-P, 1D-1,3-diamino-1,2,3-trideoxy-scyllo-inositol-6-P, and a compound present in S. glebosus extracts believed to be 1D-1-O-carbamoyl-3-amino-3-deoxy-scyllo-inositol-6-P. The latter transamidination is markedly enhanced in crude extracts by carbamoyl-P. S. glebosus extracts also have 1-guanidino-1-deoxy-scyllo-inositol-4-P phosphohydrolase activity; neither this enzyme nor the corresponding enzyme from streptomycin producers can dephosphorylate the transamidination product presumed to be bluensidine-6-P. Acid hydrolysis of the latter compound gave a compound which, unlike the unhydrolyzed compound, was converted to 1D-1-guanidino-3-amino-1,3-dideoxy-scyllo-inositol by enzymes from a streptomycin producing strain. S. glebosus cannot carry out the above conversion since it apparently lacks at least two enzymes which occur in streptomycin producers: guanidinodeoxy-(scyllo)-inositol dehydrogenase and l-alanine:1D-1-guanidino-3-keto-1-deoxy-scyllo-inositol aminotransferase. It is suggested that streptomycin producing strains might be descendents of an ancestral strain which, like S. glebosus, produced the monoguanidinated inositol derivative, bluensomycin. It is further suggested that gene duplication and subsequent evolutionary divergence resulted in biosynthesis of the diguanidinated inositol derivative, streptomycin, which is 10 times more effective than bluensomycin as an antibiotic and inhibitor of protein biosynthesis."

The parallelism among the three is principally that of prominent negative bands that appear consistently at characteristic loci throughout a wide range of chromosome compaction. The correlation of those bands with regions of low optical density in nonbanded Fuelgen-stained chromosomes suggests that they are loci of DNA that is inherently difluse or readily labile. The instances of disparity among the patterns of the three modes of banding occur at the telomeres and at known regions of heterochromatin, and are interpreted here as reflecting the heterogeneity of the protein moieties in their reactivity to the cytochemical treatments."

The effects of mercurials on mitochondria can be duplicated by the addition in their place of either purified mitochondrial Na+/K+ ionophore or a classical ionophorous species (e.g. gramicidin). Mitochondria which are submitted in turn to each of these three experimentally defined conditions acquire the capacity not only for energized proton release, but also for nonenergized proton uptake, nonenergized swelling in the presence of 0.10 m potassium or sodium chloride or nitrate in a sucrose-free medium, active transport of sodium or potassium acetate, and increased succinatedependent respiration. While such an extensive spectrum of near identical agent-activity relationships has led us to adopt the present thesis, more directly in support of the latter is the observation that the yield of ethanol-extractable Na+/K+ ionophore from mitochondria is consistently increased upon pretreatment of mitochondria with mercurials such as fluorescein mercuric acetate."
https://openalex.org/W1640504901,"Abstract NAD-linked glycerol-3-P dehydrogenase which was proved to be pure with disc gel electrophoresis was isolated from rat liver, rat skeletal muscle, and rabbit liver. Plasma containing anti-dehydrogenase antibodies was obtained from the rat and rabbit that had been immunized with the dehydrogenase from the liver and skeletal muscle of the rabbits and rats, respectively. γ-Globulin fraction was separated from plasma of the immunized and control animals by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. γ-Globulin containing anti-dehydrogenase antibodies in an excess amount completely inhibited the enzymatic activity of the corresponding purified dehydrogenase, and the inhibition was not very significantly pH-dependent in the range from 6.0 to 10.5. The precipitin reaction in each case is one of the monospecific system, and mole ratio of anti-dehydrogenase antibody to the corresponding pure dehydrogenase preparation was estimated to be approximately 2 at the point of maximum precipitation. Antibodies against the pure hepatic and skeletal muscle dehydrogenase of the rat and rabbit cross-reacted with the dehydrogenase in the cytosolic fraction from liver, kidney, spleen, brain, skeletal muscle, diaphragm, lung, and heart of these two species. An excess amount of antibodies almost totally inhibited the dehydrogenase activity in the cytosolic fraction from various tissues of the rat and rabbit, but failed to inhibit totally the dehydrogenase activity from rat and rabbit heart. The heart tissue of the rat and rabbit was found to contain an appreciable amount of another glycerol-3-P dehydrogenase activity which did not cross-react with antibodies against the purified liver and skeletal muscle dehydrogenase. Antibody against this second type of the dehydrogenase in the rat and rabbit heart showed no cross-reaction with the purified liver and skeletal muscle dehydrogenase of the rat and rabbit, but specifically inhibited the activity of the corresponding dehydrogenase completely. This immunologically distinct dehydrogenase was also found in the cytosolic fraction from rat and rabbit liver in very small amounts."

https://openalex.org/W1503312827,"Abstract The physicochemical and biochemical properties of hemoglobin associated with haptoglobin were compared with those of hemoglobin bound by antihemoglobin antibody. The mechanism of enhanced peroxidase activity of hemoglobin bound by haptoglobin was concluded not to be activation but stabilization of hemoglobin at acidic pH by haptoglobin. Haptoglobin protects hemoglobin from denaturation by acid, and moreover it can regenerate denatured hemoglobin at acidic pH. Specific antibody, on the other hand, does not enhance the peroxidase activity of hemoglobin, nor does it prevent the acid denaturation of hemoglobin. Hydrogen peroxide-peroxidase complex (Compound I), which has not yet been detected in the H2O2-hemoglobin system, was observed in the H2O2-hemoglobin-haptoglobin complex system, indicating that haptoglobin stabilized the H2O2-hemoglobin complex. Hemoglobin bound by antibody shows a higher affinity for oxygen than free hemoglobin (p50 = 2.0 mm Hg at pH 7.0, and p50 = 3.0 mm Hg at pH 7.4), a biphasic Hill plot, and slight preservation of heme-heme interaction (n = 1.6 at y/1 - y g 1.5, and n = 1.0 at y/1 - y l 1.5) and somewhat reduced Bohr effect (r = -0.37). These characteristic functions of hemoglobin bound by antibody are in striking contrast to those of hemoglobin bound by haptoglobin. Hemes of hemoglobin-antibody complex are not degraded by dithionite under aerobic conditions, whereas those of hemoglobin-haptoglobin complex are degraded, being consistent with the view that hemoglobin bound by antibody is tetrameric, whereas hemoglobin bound by haptoglobin is dissociated. The binding site of hemoglobin for haptoglobin was investigated through immunological experiments. From the data on the immune precipitation reaction of antihemoglobin serum in gels with free hemoglobin, hemoglobin-haptoglobin (human) complex, and hemoglobin-haptoglobin (rabbit) complex, it was apparent that the antigenic determinants of hemoglobin were not modified nor masked and moreover new antigenic determinants of hemoglobin did not appear on complex formation with haptoglobin. These observations suggest that the binding site of hemoglobin for haptoglobin is quite different from that for antihemoglobin antibody."
