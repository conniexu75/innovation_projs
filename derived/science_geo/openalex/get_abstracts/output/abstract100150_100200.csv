https://openalex.org/W1992772703,"Several different oncogenes and growth factors promote G1 phase progression. Cyclin D1, the regulatory subunit of several cyclin-dependent kinases, is required for, and capable of shortening, the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The present study demonstrates that transforming mutants of p21ras (Ras Val-12, Ras Leu-61) induce the cyclin D1 promoter in human trophoblasts (JEG-3), mink lung epithelial (Mv1.Lu), and in Chinese hamster ovary fibroblast cell lines. Site-directed mutagenesis of AP-1-like sequences at -954 abolished p21ras-dependent activation of cyclin D1 expression. The AP-1-like sequences were also required for activation of the cyclin D1 promoter by c-Jun. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays using nuclear extracts from cultured cells and primary tissues, several AP-1 proteins (c-Jun, JunB, JunD, and c-Fos) bound the cyclin D1 -954 region. Cyclin D1 promoter activity was stimulated by overexpression of mitogen-activated protein kinase (p41MAPK) or c-Ets-2 through the proximal 22 base pairs. Expression of plasmids encoding either dominant negative MAPK (p41MAPKi) or dominant negatives of ETS activation (Ets-LacZ), antagonized MAPK-dependent induction of cyclin D1 promoter activity. Epidermal growth factor induction of cyclin D1 transcription, through the proximal promoter region, was antagonized by either p41MAPKi or Ets-LacZ, suggesting that ETS functions downstream of epidermal growth factor and MAPK in the context of the cyclin D1 promoter. The activation of cyclin D1 transcription by p21ras provides evidence for cross-talk between the p21ras and cell cycle regulatory pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1975299036,"Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) has been suggested to be the mediator of insulin resistance in infection, tumor cachexia, and obesity. We have previously shown that TNF diminishes insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1). The current work examines potential mechanisms that mediate this event. TNF effect on IRS-1 in Fao hepatoma cells was not associated with a significant reduction in insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity as measured in vitro but impaired the association of IRS-1 with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, localizing TNF impact to IRS-1. TNF did not increase protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity and protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibition by vanadate did not change TNF effect on IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting that protein-tyrosine phosphatases are not involved in this TNF effect. In contrast, TNF increased IRS-1 phosphorylation on serine residues, leading to a decrease in its electrophoretic mobility. TNF effect on IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was not abolished by inhibiting protein kinase C using staurosporine, while inactivation of Ser/Thr phosphatases by calyculin A and okadaic acid mimicked it. Our data suggest that TNF induces serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 through inhibition of serine phosphatases or activation of serine kinases other than protein kinase C. This increased serine phosphorylation interferes with insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and impairs insulin action.

Alternatively, TNF inhibitory effect may be mediated through the activation of specific tyrosine phosphatases(30Totpal K. Agarwal S. Aggarwal B.B. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 2557-2562PubMed Google Scholar). This study tries to elucidate whether these mechanisms are involved in the TNF effect on insulin signaling pathways. Recombinant murine TNF was kindly provided by Boehringer (Ingelheim, FRG). Recombinant human insulin was a gift from Novo-Nordisk (Copenhagen, Denmark). Carrier-free [32P]orthophosphate was from Rotem Industries (Beer-Sheba, Israel) and [γ-32P]ATP from Amersham (Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Protein G- and protein A-Sepharose were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc., and wheat germ agglutinin coupled to agarose was from Bio-Makor (Rehovot, Israel). All other reagents were from Sigma. Rabbit polyclonal IR antibodies were generated against a synthetic peptide corresponding to positions 1309-1324 of the human IR(31Kanety H. Moshe S. Shafrir E. Lunenfeld B. Karasik A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1853-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). IRS-1 immunoprecipitation was performed with antibodies from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY) and immunoblotting with rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal 14 amino acids of rat IRS-1 (gift from Y. Zick, Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel). Polyclonal antibody directed against the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) antibodies used in immunoblotting experiments were a gift from M. White (Boston, MA), while for immunoprecipitation, monoclonal Tyr(P) antibodies (PY-20) from ICN were used. Rat hepatoma Fao cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Biological Industries, Beth Haemek, Israel). Confluent monolayers of Fao cells, grown in 60-mm dishes, were deprived of serum for 16 h prior to each experiment. The medium was removed, and cells were incubated with or without 5 nM TNF in serum-free medium for the indicated time interval. Fao cells were then incubated without or with 100 nM insulin for 1 min at 37°C. The reaction was terminated by removing the medium and freezing cell monolayers with liquid nitrogen. In some experiments, cells were preincubated with 50 μM sodium orthovanadate or 10-50 nM staurosporine for 16 h or 30 min, respectively. Cells were solubilized at 4°C with 0.4 ml/dish of buffer A (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.6, 150 mM sucrose, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 80 mM β-glycerophosphate, 10 mM NaF, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mM sodium EGTA, 2 mM sodium EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor). The solubilized cells were scraped and sedimented by centrifugation for 15 min at 4°C at 12,000 × g. Aliquots of the supernatants were normalized for protein, mixed with concentrated (5×) Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and resolved on 7.5 or 6% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Cells were treated with ligands as described above and solubilized with buffer B (buffer A without SDS). Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated for 4 h at 4°C with antibodies to IRS-1 (15 μg/ml) or Tyr(P) (10 μg/ml) preadsorbed on protein G-Sepharose beads or with antibodies to IR (1:200 dilution) coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads. The immunocomplexes were pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g and washed twice with buffer B and twice with buffer B containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The pellets were then suspended in Laemmli sample buffer and resolved on 7.5 or 6% SDS-PAGE. Electrophoretic transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose papers was carried out as described previously(10Feinstein R. Kanety H. Papa M.Z. Lunenfeld B. Karasik A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26055-26058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were incubated with the appropriate antibodies, and proteins were detected by Enhanced Chemiluminescence using either horseradish peroxidase-labeled Protein A or horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG (Amersham). Fao cells in phosphate-free RPMI medium were labeled for 3 h at 37°C with [32P]orthophosphate (0.1 mCi/ml). Cells were then incubated for 20 min without or with TNF or calyculin A or for 1 min with 100 nM insulin. Cells were rapidly washed in ice-cold phosphate-free medium and solubilized for 40 min in 0.4 ml of buffer C (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 100 mM NaF, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor). After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min, supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation at 4°C with IRS-1 or Tyr(P) antibodies preadsorbed on protein G-Sepharose beads for 4 h. The immune pellets were washed twice with buffer C, twice with buffer C without Nonidet P-40 supplemented with 0.5 M NaCl, and once with buffer C. Immunoprecipitated proteins were treated with Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and exposed to autoradiography. Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed as described by Boyle et al.(32Boyle W.J. Van Der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Briefly, immunoprecipitated [32]phosphate-labeled IRS-1 was separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The IRS-1 phosphorylated bands were excised from the membrane and hydrolyzed in 6 N HCl at 110°C for 1 h. The hydrolysates were dried by Speed-vac, dissolved in electrophoresis buffer (pH 1.9) containing phosphoamino acid standards, and analyzed by one-dimensional thin layer electrophoresis. Individual amino acids were detected by ninhydrin staining and autoradiography. Cells were incubated at 37°C with or without 5 nM TNF for different periods of time. Insulin was also added (100 nM final concentration) to the indicated plates for the final 10 min at 37°C. Cells were lysed and then immunoprecipitated with IR antibody for 4 h at 4°C, and IR tyrosine kinase activity was determined as described by Chin et al. using poly(Glu,Tyr) (4:1) as an exogenous substrate(28Chin J.E. Liu F. Roth R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). To verify that the amount of receptor in each reaction was comparable, the immunoprecipitates were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies to IR as described above. Cells were incubated at 37°C with or without 5 nM TNF for different periods of time, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer in buffer D (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 5 mM EDTA, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 250 mM sucrose, 0.5 mM benzamidine, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor). Homogenates were centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min, the supernatants were recentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min, and the supernatants after this procedure were retained as the “cytosolic fraction.” Pellets were resuspended in buffer D supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 and were retained as the “particulate fraction.” IR was purified from homogenized rat liver on wheat germ agglutinin-agarose as described previously (31Kanety H. Moshe S. Shafrir E. Lunenfeld B. Karasik A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1853-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and subjected to immunoprecipitation with a specific IR antibody coupled to protein A-Sepharose for 4 h at 4°C. The immunocomplexes were allowed to undergo insulin-induced autophosphorylation in 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, in the presence of 5 μM [γ-32P]ATP, 10 mM MnCl2, and 100 nM insulin. Autophosphorylation was terminated by adding 10 mM EDTA and 1 mM ATP. Immunocomplexes were washed and resuspended in 25 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, containing 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol and protease inhibitors. Particulate and cytosolic fractions from Fao cells (50 μg) were added to the immunocomplexes to evaluate protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity. After incubation for 20 min at 30°C the dephosphorylation reaction was terminated by adding Laemmli sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The degree of dephosphorylation was evaluated by densitometry and expressed as density of the IR β-subunit band after incubation with buffer alone or with the appropriate hepatic fraction. Fao cells were treated for 60 min with 5 nM TNF prior to stimulation for 1 min by 100 nM insulin. Cell extracts and Tyr(P) antibody immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with Tyr(P) antibodies. Insulin treatment caused tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins at 95 and 180-185 kDa (Fig. 1, upper and lowerleftpanels, laneb). Preincubation with TNF alone did not induce any tyrosine phosphorylation of these bands (Fig. 1, upper and lowerleftpanels, lanec) but caused a decrease in the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of both bands (Fig. 1, upper and lowerleftpanels, laned). Moreover, TNF treatment led to a delay in the electrophoretic mobility of the 185-kDa band. The identity of the lower component of the 180-185-kDa broad band as IRS-1 (10Feinstein R. Kanety H.

(Fig. 1, upper and lowerrightpanels). TNF inhibitory influence was more pronounced on the insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 than on IR β-subunit and was apparent already after 15 min of incubation (Fig. 2). Insulin-stimulated increase in receptor tyrosine kinase activity, when assessed in vitro with an artificial substrate, was not significantly decreased after treatment with TNF (Fig. 3).Figure 2:Time course of TNF effect on insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1.

Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35White M.F. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). TNF effect on IRS-1 function was evaluated by the cytokine impact on insulin-induced association between IRS-1 and one of these enzymes, PI 3-kinase. Preincubation with TNF prior to insulin stimulation led to a decrease in the amount of the 85-kDa subunit of PI 3-kinase that coprecipitated with IRS-1 (Fig. 4, rightpanel). This decrease did not result from a reduction in IRS-1 content (Fig. 4, leftpanel) but rather from a decrease in its tyrosine phosphorylation state (Fig. 4, middlepanel). To evaluate protein-tyrosine phosphatase involvement we reexamined TNF effect on insulin-induced phosphorylation in the absence (Fig. 5, leftsixlanes) or presence (Fig. 5, rightsixlanes) of vanadate, a protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor. TNF inhibitory effect was unchanged by preincubation with vanadate under conditions where vanadate markedly increased both IRS-1 and IR tyrosine phosphorylation through inactivation of protein-tyrosine phosphatases. In addition, TNF did not alter either cytosolic or particulate protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity as measured with the tyrosine-phosphorylated β-subunit of the IR as a substrate (Fig. 6).Figure 6:Effect of TNF on protein-tyrosine phosphatases. Particulate and cytosolic fractions from Fao cells treated with 5 nM TNF for the indicated times were added to immunopurified 32P-tyrosine-phosphorylated IR. After a 20-min incubation at 30°C the receptor was separated on SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. The degree of dephosphorylation was evaluated by densitometry and expressed as density of the IR β-subunit band after incubation with buffer alone or with the appropriate cellular fraction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The delay in electrophoretic mobility of IRS-1 in TNF-treated cells and its decreased tyrosine phosphorylation can be attributed to an increase in Ser/Thr phosphorylation of this protein. To evaluate this possibility 32P-labeled Fao cells were stimulated with TNF, and cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with IRS-1 antibody to demonstrate total phosphorylation of this protein (Fig. 7, upperleftpanel) and in parallel with Tyr(P) antibodies to detect any TNF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and of IR (Fig. 7, upperrightpanel). IRS-1 was phosphorylated already in the basal state (Fig. 7, upperleftpanel, firstlane) but not on tyrosine residues (Fig. 7, upperrightpanel, thirdlane). TNF alone led to a 60% increase in total phosphorylation of IRS-1 as well as to a mild delay in its electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 7, upperleftpanel, secondlane). Insulin but not TNF led to tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and the IR β-subunit, implying that the increased phosphorylation with TNF stimulation is on Ser/Thr residues (Fig. 7, upperrightpanel). This suggestion was further supported by phosphoamino acid analysis showing only phosphoserine in IRS-1 from cells stimulated with TNF (Fig. 7, lowerpanel). It has recently been shown that inhibition of Ser/Thr phosphatases increases IRS-1 Ser/Thr phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes(29Tanti J.F. Gremeaux T. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6051-6057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our system, 20-min incubation with calyculin A, a specific Ser/Thr phosphatase inhibitor, mimicked the effect of TNF and led to an apparent increase in the degree of IRS-1 phosphorylation and to a decrease in its electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 7, upperleftpanel, thirdlane). We further compared the effects of both calyculin A and okadaic acid, another inhibitor of the protein phosphatases 2A and 1, to the TNF effect on IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Preincubation of Fao cells with these agents decreased insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 as did incubation with TNF (Fig. 8). Moreover, both treatments led to a comparable lag in the electrophoretic mobility of IRS-1. A dose- and time-dependent effect of calyculin A inhibition was demonstrated (Fig. 8, lanesd-h). To evaluate whether TNF-induced Ser/Thr phosphorylation of IRS-1 is mediated by activation of the calcium-phospholipid-dependent kinase, protein kinase C, the original experiment depicted in Fig. 1was repeated in Fao cells pretreated with staurosporine, a protein kinase C inhibitor(36Tamaoki T. Nomoto H. Takahashi I. Kato Y. Morimoto M. Tomita F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 135: 397-402.Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar). Incubation with 50 nM of staurosporine for 30 min, prior to insulin stimulation, resulted in an increase in the degree of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation due to attenuation of protein kinase C-mediated Ser/Thr phosphorylation of IRS-1 (Fig. 9). Restriction of protein kinase C did not change the degree of TNF inhibition of insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. Kinase activity of the IR is regulated by multisite phosphorylation(34White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IR phosphorylation on Ser/Thr sites has an inhibitory regulatory effect on the insulin-induced autophosphorylation of the β-subunit(26Takayama S. White M.F. Lauris V. Kahn C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In our study we supplied ample evidence to suggest that TNF leads to a reduction in insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 through increased serine phosphorylation of the substrate. Upstream to IRS-1, no significant reduction in IR kinase activity was observed in purified receptors from cells treated with TNF. This is similar to the findings in protein kinase Cα-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells, where 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate inhibition of insulin action was shown to occur through an increase in IRS-1 Ser/Thr phosphorylation, leading to a decrease in its tyrosine phosphorylation. Like in our system it was not associated with a decline in the IR kinase activity as measured in vitro(28Chin J.E. Liu F. Roth R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Downstream to IRS-1, TNF exposure led to decreased PI 3-kinase association with the substrate, suggesting that the IRS-1 impairment is central to TNF induction of insulin resistance. Of special interest is the close mimicry between TNF effects and those achieved using the Ser/Thr phosphatase inhibitors, okadaic acid and calyculin A. All three reagents inhibit insulin metabolic effects (37Shisheva A. Shechter Y. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 2279-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 38Jullien D. Tanti J.F. Heydrick S.J.

Moreover, this was linked to a decrease in IRS-1 electrophoretic mobility due to phosphorylation on Ser/Thr residues(29Tanti J.F. Gremeaux T. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6051-6057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our similar data in Fao cells confirm the uniquely parallel pattern induced by TNF and Ser/Thr phosphatase inhibitors on IRS-1 phosphorylation and suggest that TNF-induced increase in serine phosphorylation may occur through inactivation of these phosphatases. An alternative pathway leading to increased Ser/Thr content of IRS-1 may be TNF activation of serine kinases. Indeed, TNF has been shown to activate multiple serine kinases including protein kinase C, protein kinase A, β-casein kinase, and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases(16Zhang Y. Lin J.-X. Yip Y.K.

In addition, TNF activates protein kinase C in several cell lines(22Schutze S. Nottrott S. Pfizenmaier K. Kronke M. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2604-2608PubMed Google Scholar, 23Gorospe M. Kumar S. Baglioni C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6214-6220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), making it a candidate for conveying the TNF effect. The possibility to down-regulate protein kinase C was not utilized in our system, since phorbol esters can potentially lead to shedding of TNF receptors(40Brakebusch C. Nophar Y. Kemper O. Engelmann H. Wallach D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Use of staurosporine, a potent nonspecific protein kinase C inhibitor, augmented IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation but did not alter TNF effect. It is noteworthy that in FS-4 fibroblasts TNF induction of heat shock protein 28 phosphorylation was also not inhibited by staurosporine and other protein kinase C inhibitors, and the increased serine phosphorylation of this protein was attributed to inhibition of serine phosphatases(41Vietor I. Vilcek J. Lymphokine Cytokine Res. 1994; 13: 315-323PubMed Google Scholar). Other well characterized kinases whose activity was shown to be increased by TNF in several cells including hepatocytes are the MAP kinase isoforms(17Van Lint J. Agostinis P. Vandevoorde V.

Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar). Recently, IRS-1 phosphorylation by MAP kinase was suggested, making it a plausible candidate to be involved in TNF-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1(34White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35White M.F. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Moreover, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes Kletzien et al.(12Kletzien R.F. Foellmi-adams L.A. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 82AGoogle Scholar) underlined the complex potential interactions between the multiple MAP kinase species, TNF and insulin. While TNF obliterated the insulin-induced phosphorylation and activation of p44 MAP kinase, it stimulated a p38 MAP kinase. Serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 may not be the only mechanism mediating TNF inhibition of insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. In this study obliteration of protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity by vanadate did not reverse TNF inhibition, implying that protein-tyrosine phosphatases are not involved in this effect. Moreover, TNF did not alter protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity in Fao cells when measured in vitro using the phosphorylated IR β-subunit as a substrate. In summary, the phenomenon investigated in this work constitutes an interesting example for the complex cross-talk between cytokines and growth factors that operate through receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. This may represent one of the delicate physiological regulatory mechanisms of insulin action that when exaggerated may lead to insulin resistance. The immediate clinical significance of this interaction was recently underlined by Hotamisligil and Spiegelman (10Feinstein R. Kanety H. Papa M.Z. Lunenfeld B. Karasik A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26055-26058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who suggested that TNF is the cause and link in obesity-induced insulin resistance. According to their hypothesis, TNF overproduced by adipose tissue inhibits insulin action and is connected to the development of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Better understanding of the cascade of events involved in obesity-linked non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus may form the basis for reversal of this prevalent deleterious disease.

Depending on the N-terminal amino acid from which a fluorescent leaving group like MCA is cleaved by the proteasome, the REG activates the proteasome 20-50-fold (Suc-LLVY-MCA, (Z)-LLE-βNA), 10-fold (PFR-MCA), or 3-fold (GGF-MCA). The REG has been isolated from human blood as a hexa- or heptameric 180-kDa particle consisting of two subunits with apparent molecular weights of 29 and 31 in SDS-PAGE. In evolution both subunits are higly conserved with about 90% amino acid sequence identity between human and rat. The 29- and 31-kDa subunits may be functionally different as they display only about 50% identity between each other(24Ahn J.Y. Tanahashi N. Akiyama K.-y. Hisamatsu H. Noda C. Tanaka K. Chung C.H.

Electron microscopy has shown that the ringshaped REG binds to the α-end plates of the proteasome(26Gray C.W. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). It thus competes with another complex activator, called the 19 S regulator, for binding to the 20 S proteasomes(27Yoshimura T. Kameyama T. Takagi T. Ikai A. Tokunaga F. Koide T. Tanahashi N. Tamura T. Cejka Z. Baumeister W. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. J. Struct. Biol. 1993; 111: 200-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the reversible association between REG and 20 S proteasome which is energy independent, formation of the 26 S proteasome out of the 20 S proteasome and the 19 S regulator is ATP-dependent(28Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16890-16895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At least four of the 13-15 subunits of the 19 S regulator belong to a novel family of ATPases, and one subunit has been shown to be the receptor of ubiquitin, crucial for the function of the 26 S protease in degrading ubiquitinated proteins(29Rechsteiner M.

The finding that two subunits of the proteasome and of the REG are IFN-γ inducible is a strong indication that the proteasome is involved in the production of antigenic peptides. In fact, proteasome inhibitors prevent an in vivo production of peptide ligands for MHC class I molecules from ovalbumin(31Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D.

Mice deficient for the LMP7 gene show a decrease in MHC class I surface expression on lymphocytes and the in vitro stimulation of HY-antigen-specific T cells was reduced(34Fehling H.J. Swat W. Laplace C. Kuehn R. Rajewsky K. Mueller U. von Boehmer H. Science. 1994; 265: 1234-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). LMP2-deficient mice, in contrast, are not reduced in MHC class I expression but show a diminution of CD4-8+ T cells. Upon infection with influenza A virus, these mice show a reduction in the frequency of precursors of antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells while no change in cell number was noted in Sendai virus infection(35Van Kaer L.

It appears that the presence of LMP2 and LMP7 subunits in the 20 S proteasome is not required for MHC class I expression and antigen presentation (36Arnold D. Driscoll J. Androlewicz M. Hughes E. Cresswell P. Spies T. Nature. 1993; 360: 171-174Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 37Momburg F. Ortiz-Navarrete V. Neefjes J. Goulmy E. van-de-Wal Y. Spits H. Powis S.J. Butcher G.W. Howard J.C. Walden P. Haemmerling G. Nature. 1993; 360: 174-177Crossref Scopus (231) Google Scholar) but some viral antigens are presented more efficiently. How LMP2 and LMP7 mediate these effects on antigen presentation remained a controversial issue. In some laboratories in vitro experiments with fluorogenic peptides and proteasomes from an LMP2/LMP7 doubly deficient lymphoblastoid cell line yielded a reduction in cleavage at the C terminus of tyrosine and arginine residues as compared to wild type(38Gaczynska M. Rock K.L. Goldberg A.L. Nature. 1993; 365: 264-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 39Driscoll J. Brown M.G. Finley D. Monaco J.J. Nature. 1993; 365: 262-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), whereas this was not found by other investigators(32Boes B. Hengel H. Ruppert T. Multhaup G. Koszinowski U.H. Kloetzel P.M. J.

A. 1995; 92: 584-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We have therefore readdressed this issue by strongly overexpressing LMP2 and LMP7 alone or together in transfected murine fibroblast cells. We further tested how the REG would influence these proteasome populations in in vitro digests of a 25-mer peptide. While LMP2 and LMP7 caused substantial variation in the quantity of different peptides produced, binding of the REG to any of these 20 S proteasome preparations led to a characteristic qualitative and quantitative shift in the cleavage products generated. C4 is a murine fibroblast line derived from embryonic BALB/c mice by SV40 infection in vitro. 2U. Koszinowski, unpublished results. The B8 clone had been derived by cotransfection of the C4 line with plasmid pIE100, an expression construct encoding the pp89 protein of the murine cytomegalovirus(41Koszinowski U.M. Keil G.M. Volkmer H. Fibl M.R. Ebeling-Keil A. Muench K. J. Virol. 1986; 58: 59-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and pAG60 encoding the neomycin resistance gene. B8 cells were grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mML-glutamine, 5 × 10-5M 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 250 μg/ml G418. B8 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding BALB/c-derived LMP2 or LMP7 full-length cDNAs cloned into pSG5 (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) by direct cloning using EcoRI sites for LMP7 (42Frentzel S. Graf U. Hammerling G.J. Kloetzel P.M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 302: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and PCR cloning using BamHI/BglII sites and primers as described for LMP2(15Frentzel S. Kuhn H.I. Gernold M. Gött P. Seelig A. Kloetzel P.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cells (5 × 105) plated to 60% confluence were transfected by standard calcium phosphate precipitation methods with 8 μg of pLMP2 or 8 μg of pLMP7 or 4 μg of each in cotransfection with 2 μg of either puromycin (pLXSP) or hygromycin (pLXSH) resistance expression constructs (generous gifts of Dr. Ed Palmer, Basel, Switzerland). One day after transfection cells were replated in 96-well plates under cloning conditions and selected after 2 days in 2.5 μg/ml puromycin or 400 μg/ml hygromycin. The detailed purification procedure will be documented in a separate publication. 3L. Kuehn and B. Dahlmann, manuscript submitted for publication. In brief, rabbits (source: SAVO-Ivanovas GmbH, Kisslegg, Germany) were bled, and blood was collected in anti-coagulant solution. All subsequent steps were performed at 6°C. Following four washes with 0.9% NaCl and centrifugation, packed cells were lysed with 3 volumes of TEAD buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM NaN3, 1 mM DTE, pH 7.5) and cell debris was spun down (80,000 × g, 60 min). The resulting supernatant was batch-adsorbed to DEAE-cellulose (DEAE-Servacel, Serva, Heidelberg), and the gel was washed with TEAD buffer. Elution of proteins containing REG was done with TEAD buffer containing 0.5 M NaCl. This step was followed by fractionation with ammonium sulfate (0-40 and 40-70% saturation with respect to the salt. The precipitate resulting from 40 to 70% salt cut was dissolved in TEAD buffer and dialyzed against the same buffer. Further enrichment of REG was achieved by consecutive anion-exchange chromatography on a DEAE-Sephacel and FPLC®-MonoQ column (both from Pharmacia, Freiburg). Purification to apparent homogeneity was performed by hydrophobic interaction chromatography on an FPLC®-phenyl-Superose column, yielding a preparation which showed a single band of about 200 kDa in native PAGE, and which is resolved into the two constituent subunits of 29 and 31 kDa upon SDS-PAGE (see Fig. 3). When stored at 6°C in TEAD buffer, supplemented with 1 volume of glycerol, REG protein purified according to this protocol was found to retain full activity over a period of at least 8 weeks. Frozen pellets of 4 × 108 B8 cells were lysed in 10 ml of lysis buffer (80 mM KAc, 5 mM MgAc2, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.1% Triton X-100) on ice and homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer. The 40,000 × g supernatant of the lysate was bound for 45 min to DEAE-Sephacel (Pharmacia), unbound protein was removed by washing with buffer A (80 mM KAc, 5 mM MgAc2, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2), and protein was eluted with buffer B (500 mM KAc, 5 mM MgAc2, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2). Protein containing fractions were concentrated on a concentrator (Amicon Corp.) and loaded on a 10-40% sucrose gradient in buffer A. After centrifugation at 40,000 revolutions/min in a Beckman SW40 Ti rotor for 15.49 h, gradient fractions were tested for protease activity and active fractions pooled and concentrated for FPLC® chromatography on a MonoQ HR5/5 column (Pharmacia). A linear gradient was developed with buffers C (100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2) and D (1 M KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2) and a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The 20 S proteasome eluted at 29% D as a single peak upon rechromatography and was >90% pure as judged by Coomassie-stained PAGE gels. Quantification of native proteasome protein was done by UV absorbtion at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 1.0 cm2/mg. A typical yield was 200 μg of proteasome/4 × 108 cells. 20 μl of proteasome digest were separated by reverse phase HPLC (SMART-system equipped with a μRPC C2/C18 SC 2.1/10 column (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany). Eluent A, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; eluent B, 70% acetonitrile containing 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid. Gradient 20-65% B in 32 min, flow rate 50 μL/min) and analyzed on-line by a tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer TSQ 7000 (FInningan MAT, Bremen, Germany) equipped with an electrospray ion source. Each scan was acquired over the range m/z 200-1700 in 3 s. The peptides were identified by their molecular mass calculated from the m/z peaks of the single or multiple charged ions. Additionally, the amino acid sequences of the major cleavage products were determined in MS/MS experiments from the fragmentation spectra after collision-induced dissociation with argon atoms. Fluorogenic substrate peptides Succ-LLVY-MCA, (Z)-GGL-MCA, VGR-MCA (Bachem, Heidelberg) were prepared from 10 mM stocks in Me2SO and incubated at several final concentrations with 100 ng of purified proteasome in 100 μl of buffer E (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH, 7.5, 25 mM KCl, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA) at 37°C for 30 min, and the reaction was stopped by addition of 10 μl of buffer F (30 mM NaAc, pH 4.3, 100 mM CH2ClCOOH, 70 mM acetic acid); fluorescence was determined with a RF-5001 PC spectrofluorometer (Shimadzu) at 380 nm excitation/440 nm emission. The (Z)-LLE-βNA substrate was dissolved freshly for each experiment, the reaction stopped by addition of 1 volume of ethanol, and the measurement was performed at 335 nm excitation/410 nm emission. For digestion of a synthetic 25-mer peptide derived from the sequence of Murine Cytomegalovirus pp89 IE protein, 20 μg of peptide (kindly provided by Dr. P. Henklein, Berlin) were dissolved in 300 μl of buffer G (30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTE) and digested with 1 μg of purified proteasome for indicated times at 37°C. REG was added at 8-fold molar excess in TEAD buffer + 1 volume of glycerol, and the negative controls were supplemented with TEAD/glycerol buffer only. Cleavage products were analyzed by reverse phase HPLC: 50 μl of digest was applied to a 4.6 × 250 mm Ultrasphere RP18 column (Beckman) on a System Gold (Beckman) and eluted with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and a linear gradient of solution A (water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and solution B (acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid): 0-5 min 0% B, 5-40 min linear increase to 60% B, peaks were detected at 220 nm. Trichloroacetic acid precipitates of 50 μg of proteasome were agitated overnight in 60 μl of NEPHGE sample buffer (9.5 M urea, 2% Nonidet P-40, 5% ampholines, pH 3-10, (Servalyt, Serva), 0.3% SDS, 5%β-mercaptoethanol). Gel rods were poured as described (43O'Farrell P.Z. Goodman H.M. O'Farrell P.H. Cell. 1977; 12: 1133-1142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar) by addition of 27 μl of 10% ammoniumpersulfate and 19 μl of TEMED to a filtered and degassed solution of 5.5 g of urea in 1.32 ml of acrylamide stock (28.38% acrylamide, 1.62% bisacrylamide), 4.0 ml of 5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 ml of Servalyte 3-10. The gel was topped up with overlay solution (8 M urea, 2, 5% Servalyt 3-10) and polymerized for 1 h. The sample was applied to the gel, topped with 20 μl of overlay solution, and run for 4 h at 400 V from acidic (0.01 M H3PO4, plus pole) to the basic side (0.02 M NaOH, minus pole). The rod was equilibrated for 45 min in 25 ml of equilibration buffer (10% glycerol, 10%β-mercaptoethanol, 2.3% SDS, 90 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) and fixed to the top of a 15% SDS-PAGE with Laemmli SDS sample buffer + 1% agarose. The gels were run for 1050 V/h and stained with Coomassie stain. B8, a fibroblast line derived from a BALB/c mouse, was shown before to express low endogenous levels of LMP2 and LMP7 proteins in isolated 20 S proteasomes in the absence of IFN-γ stimulation(32Boes B. Hengel H. Ruppert T. Multhaup G. Koszinowski U.H. Kloetzel P.M. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 901-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). We mimicked the IFN-γ-mediated induction of these two subunits by single or joint constitutive overexpression of LMP genes in B8 cells which permits the analysis of each subunit independent of other IFN-γ-mediated effects. Full-length cDNAs encoding LMP2 and LMP7 from a BALB/c derived library had been cloned by PCR into the pSG5 expression vector(15Frentzel S. Kuhn H.I. Gernold M. Gött P. Seelig A. Kloetzel P.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 44Frentzel S. Pesold-Hurt B. Seelig A. Kloetzel P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 975-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and the constructs were cotransfected with either hygromycin or puromycin resistance vectors under clonal conditions. Out of 20 drug resistant clones analyzed by genomic PCR, we have obtained 76% positive clones in LMP2 transfection, 85% positive clones in LMP7 transfection, and 57% LMP2/LMP7 double positive clones in the double transfection experiment, suggesting that LMP2 and LMP7 overexpression neither inhibits cellular growth nor survival. Virtually all PCR positive clones overexpressed the respective LMP proteins in Western blots as compared to untransfected B8 cells, albeit at different intensity. The LMP2 and LMP7 reactive antisera (15Frentzel S. Kuhn H.I. Gernold M. Gött P. Seelig A. Kloetzel P.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) detected proteins of 24 and 21 kDa for LMP2 and 30 and 23 kDa for LMP7 which are the molecular masses of the precursor and mature proteins, respectively. Thus, the expression and processing of overexpressed LMP subunits is normal. A representative clone out of the LMP2 (BC2P6), the LMP7 (B7H6), and double transfectants (BC27P7) were raised in bulk culture, and 20 S proteasomes were purified. Analysis of the subunit pattern on two-dimensional NEPHGE-PAGE gels (Fig. 1) convincingly documents the overexpression of LMP2 and LMP7 as well as an extensive replacement of subunit δ by LMP2 and MB1 by LMP7, respectively. Except for this exchange no other consistent alterations in the two-dimensional pattern of the 20 S proteasome were noted. The significant acidic shift of the subunit C8 (30 kDa, basic of delta) in the double transfectant might be due to phosphorylation(45Arizti P. Arribas J. Castano J.G. Enzyme Protein. 1993; 47: 285-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), but as it was not observed in a second preparation we did not further investigate this issue. The size and isoelectric point of the overexpressed LMP2 and LMP7 proteins in single and double transfectants are identical to those of the endogenously expressed proteins. Overexpression of one LMP subunit does not affect the endogenous expression of the other LMP subunit. Thus, in contrast to what has been suggested by other investigators(46Gaczynska M. Rock K.L. Spies T. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9213-9217Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), in our system LMP2 and LMP7 do not need each other nor any further IFN-γ-inducible factor for incorporation into the 20 S proteasome. We used freshly prepared 20 S proteasome preparations from B8 transfectants to assess the impact of LMP subunits on the cleavage of fluorogenic peptides with F, R, L, Y, or E at the C-terminal P-1 position. The results, summarized in Table 1, reveal two marked effects. First, proteasomes isolated from an LMP2/LMP7 double-transfectant cleaved the substrate Suc-LLVY-MCA at a significantly reduced rate when compared to those from wild-type B8 cells or single transfectants. Second, proteasomes purified from LMP2 or LMP2+7 transfectants cleaved the substrate (Z)-LLE-βNA much less efficiently than those derived from B8 cells or LMP7 transfectants. A kinetic analysis performed over a broad range of substrate concentrations has confirmed these findings (data not shown). The same changes in cleavage-site preference have been observed following similar transfection experiments in T2 lymphoblastoid cells (47Kuckelkorn U. Frentzel S. Kraft R. Kostka S. Groettrup M. Kloetzel P.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) and after induction of RMA T cells with IFN-γ.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The evidence that LMP2 and LMP7 exert their effects by altering the cleavage pattern produced by the 20 S proteasome has largely been derived from experiments using short fluorogenic peptides. Using these substrates, the results reported by different investigators may differ dramatically from each other and even appear contradictory(32Boes B. Hengel H. Ruppert T. Multhaup G.

To determine whether Arg-gingipain is important for periodontopathogenicity of the organism, Arg-gingipain-deficient mutants were constructed via gene disruption by use of suicide plasmid systems. First, Southern hybridization analyses suggested that two separate Arg-gingipain-encoding genes designated rgpA and rgpB existed on 12.5- and 7.8-kilobase pair HindIII chromosomal fragments of P. gingivalis ATCC33277, respectively. rgpA and rgpB single mutants were constructed by mobilization of a suicide plasmid. Then, an rgpA rgpB double mutant was isolated by electroporation with a second suicide plasmid. No proteolytic activity for Arg-gingipain was observed in either the cell extract or the culture supernatant of the rgpA rgpB mutant. The chemiluminescence response of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, which is closely related to their bactericidal function, was not inhibited by the culture supernatant of the rgpA rgpB mutant, while the wild type parent showed a significant inhibition of the response. The result suggests that Arg-gingipain is responsible for disruption of the function of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. In addition, the rgpA rgpB double mutations caused a marked decrease in the hemagglutination of P. gingivalis, indicating that a major part of the hemagglutinin activity of the organism is associated with the two genes.

Microbiol. 1992; 36: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, there has been little agreement as yet on the identity of the two molecules. Nishikata and Yoshimura (29Nishikata M. Yoshimura F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) found that one molecule possesses both the proteinase and hemagglutinin activities. On the other hand, Pike et al.(30Pike R. McGraw W. Potempa J. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 406-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Shah et al.(31Shah H.N. Gharbia S.E. Progulske-Fox A. Brocklehurst K. J. Med. Microbiol. 1992; 36: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) reported that the proteinase and hemagglutinin are separate molecules, although the two molecules are noncovalently bound to each other. Recently, based on the cloning and sequence analysis of the gene encoding arginine-specific cysteine proteinase (argingipain)(19Okamoto K. Misumi Y. Kadowaki T. Yoneda M. Yamamoto K. Ikehara Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 917-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we have suggested that the enzyme results from processing of a 109-kDa preproenzyme comprising four domains, i.e. the signal peptide, the amino-terminal domain, the proteinase domain, and the carboxyl-terminal hemagglutinin domain. This finding is consistent with the results of Ciborowski et al.(28Ciborowski P. Nishikata M. Allen R.D. Lantz M.S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4549-4557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who have suggested that the proteinase and hemagglutinin molecules are formed by processing of the primary product from the same gene. Pavloff et al.(21Pavloff N. Potempa J. Pike R.N. Prochazka V. Kiefer M.C. Travis J. Barr P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1007-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) also have sequenced the gene encoding arginine-specific cysteine proteinase (Arg-gingipain-1) from a different P. gingivalis strain. Comparison of the amino acid sequences deduced from the nucleotide sequences of argingipain and Arg-gingipain-1 genes have revealed that they are essentially identical, except that the argingipain gene lacks a sequence intervening between direct repeats in the carboxyl-terminal domain. Especially, the proteinase domains of argingipain and Arg-gingipain-1 genes were completely identical. Therefore, the arginine-specific cysteine proteinase “argingipain” was renamed “Arg-gingipain” in the present study to avoid redundancies in nomenclature. We have shown previously that Arg-gingipain is a major cysteine proteinase of P. gingivalis, a part of which is secreted extracellularly, and have strongly suggested that the enzyme is directly involved in the destruction of periodontal tissue(32Kadowaki T. Yoneda M. Okamoto K. Maeda K. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21371-21378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, based on its strong inhibition of the chemiluminescence (CL) 1The abbreviations used are: CLchemiluminescencePMNpolymorphonuclear leukocyteEmrerythromycin-resistantTcrtetracycline-resistantTLCKN α-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketoneZcarbobenzoxyMCA4-methyl-7-coumaryl-amideBoct-butyloxycarbonylPBSphosphate-buffered salinekbpkilobase pair(s). response of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and its ability to degrade human immunoglobulins G and A, we have proposed that the enzyme can impair host defense mechanisms(32Kadowaki T. Yoneda M. Okamoto K. Maeda K. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21371-21378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we do not understand to what extent Arg-gingipain contributes to the virulence of P. gingivalis. Also, there is little information available on the physiological significance of the enzyme in the organism. To gain some insight into these questions, it is necessary to undertake the molecular genetic approach. For this, we constructed Arg-gingipain-deficient mutants via disruption of the Arg-gingipain gene by use of suicide plasmid systems (33Nakayama K. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1939-1943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the course of construction, we found that two different Arg-gingipain genes existed on the chromosome of P. gingivalis ATCC33277. The results obtained with the Arg-gingipain-deficient mutants provide the evidence that Arg-gingipain is a major virulence factor of P. gingivalis. chemiluminescence polymorphonuclear leukocyte erythromycin-resistant tetracycline-resistant N α-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone carbobenzoxy 4-methyl-7-coumaryl-amide t-butyloxycarbonyl phosphate-buffered saline kilobase pair(s). P. gingivalis ATCC33277, P. gingivalis 381, and Escherichia coli DH5 were used. Plasmids pUC18(34Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11450) Google Scholar), pKDCMZ(33Nakayama K. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1939-1943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pMJF-3(35Feldhaus M.J. Hwa V. Cheng Q. Saylers A.A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4540-4543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and R751 (36Meyer R.J. Shapiro J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 1362-1373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used for construction of suicide/integration plasmids for P. gingivalis. Plasmid P.g./pUC118 (19Okamoto K. Misumi Y. Kadowaki T. Yoneda M. Yamamoto K. Ikehara Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 917-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) was used as a source of the Arg-gingipain gene. Plasmids pKD274, pKD279, pKD280, and pKD290 and P. gingivalis mutants KDP110, KDP111, and KDP112 were obtained in this study. P. gingivalis cells were grown anaerobically (10% CO2, 10% H2, 80% N2) in enriched BHI broth (containing, per liter, 37 g of brain heart infusion (Difco), 5 g of yeast extract (Difco), 1 g of cysteine, 5 mg of hemin, and 1 mg of vitamin K1) and on enriched tryptic soy agar (containing, per liter, 40 g of Trypto-Soya agar (Nissui, Tokyo, Japan), 5 g of brain heart infusion, 1 g of cysteine, 5 mg of hemin, and 1 mg of vitamin K1). L broth (containing, per liter, 10 g of tryptone (Difco), 5 g of yeast extract, and 5 g of sodium chloride) was used for growing E. coli cells. For selection or maintenance of the antibiotic-resistant strains, antibiotics were added to the media at the following concentrations (ampicillin, 50 μg/ml; chloramphenicol, 25 μg/ml; erythromycin, 10 μg/ml; gentamicin, 100 μg/ml; and tetracycline, 1 μg/ml). Proteinase inhibitors, Nα-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK) and leupeptin were purchased from Sigma and Peptide Institute Inc. (Osaka, Japan), respectively. Synthetic substrates, carbobenzoxy-L-phenylalanyl-L-arginine 4-methyl-7-coumarylamide (Z-Phe-Arg-MCA) and t-butyloxycarbonyl-L-phenylalanyl-L-seryl-L-arginine 4-methyl-7-coumarylamide (Boc-Phe-Ser-Arg-MCA) were obtained from Peptide Institute Inc. Casein, bovine hemoglobin, oyster glycogen, and zymosan A were obtained from Sigma. DNA restriction enzymes and T4 ligase were purchased from Takara (Kyoto, Japan). Plasmid DNA was purified from E. coli cells by using the Wizard™ DNA purification system (Promega, Madison, WI). Chromosomal DNA was isolated from P. gingivalis cells by the guanidine isothiocyanate method (37Lippke J.A. Strzempko M.N. Raia F.F. Simon S.L. French C.K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1987; 53: 2588-2589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the IsoQuick DNA extraction kit (MicroProbe, Garden Grove, CA). Suicide plasmids constructed in this study are depicted in Fig. 1. A 1.8-kbp SmaI-BamHI fragment of P.g./pUC118 plasmid was ligated with a HincII-BamHI digest of pUC18. The resulting plasmid was then digested with EcoRV and ligated with a BglII linker oligonucleotide to convert the EcoRV site to BglII, giving rise to plasmid pKD274. Plasmid pKD274 was digested with BglII and BamHI and self-ligated to yield pKD279. A 0.7-kbp BglII-PstI fragment of pKD274, which corresponded to the EcoRV-PstI fragment within the Arg-gingipain gene, was ligated with a BamHI-PstI digest of pKDCMZ plasmid to yield pKD280. A 0.7-kbp HindIII-BglII fragment of pKD274 was ligated with a HindIII-BamHI digest of pMJF-3 plasmid, resulting in plasmid pKD290. A 2.8-kbp SmaI fragment of P.g./pUC118 (probe I) and a 0.7-kbp PstI-EcoRI fragment of pKD279 (probe II) were labeled with digoxigenin-dUTP (Boehringer GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Synthetic oligonucleotides, 5′-GTAGCTTGTGTGAATGGCGATTTCC-3′ (probe III), 5′-CGGCACGAAGATCAAGGAAGGTCTG-3′ (probe IV), 5′-TTGGACTCGGAGACTTTGTGCAGAC-3′ (probe V), and 5′-CCGAATCCAAATCCGAATCCGAATC-3′ (probe VI) were obtained from Funakoshi (Tokyo, Japan) and were labeled with fluorescein-dUTP (Amersham International plc, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom). Southern blotting was performed by using a nylon membrane (Hybond™-N; Amersham) essentially according to Southern(38Southern E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21440) Google Scholar). Hybridization with probes I and II was done by using the Boehringer nonradioactive DNA labeling and detection kit, and the ECL 3′-oligolabeling and detection systems (Amersham) were used for Southern analyses with the oligonucleotide probes. The procedure for the mobilization was described previously(33Nakayama K. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1939-1943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the culture of E. coli DH5 harboring pKD280 and R751 plasmids was mixed with an equal volume of the culture of P. gingivalis ATCC33277 and the cultures were harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in prewarmed enriched BHI broth and spotted on enriched tryptic soy agar. The plates were aerobically incubated at 37°C for 4 h prior to anaerobic incubation at 37°C for 36 h. Bacterial cells on the plates were collected with a cotton swab, resuspended in enriched BHI broth, spread on enriched tryptic soy agar containing erythromycin and gentamicin, and incubated anaerobically at 37°C for 7 days. Erythromycin-resistant (Emr) transconjugants were obtained at the frequency of 2.5 × 10-8/recipient cell. P. gingivalis cells were anaerobically grown to 6 × 108/ml at 37°C in enriched BHI broth. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation, washed with the electroporation solution (300 mM sucrose), and resuspended in 0.1 volume of the same solution. Fifteen microliters of pKD290 plasmid DNA solution (270 μg of DNA/ml in TE buffer) were added to 0.4 ml of the cell suspension. The whole volume of the DNA-containing cell suspension was poured into a cuvette for electroporation (Pulser™ cuvette with 0.2-cm electrode gap; Bio-Rad). Electroporation was performed on the condition (voltage, 2.0 kV; time constant, 5 ms) with an electroporation apparatus (Gene Pulser™; Bio-Rad). These procedures were carried out at 4°C. The cell suspension was immediately mixed with 10 ml of prewarmed enriched BHI broth and incubated anaerobically at 37°C for 15 h. Cells of the culture were spread on enriched tryptic soy agar containing tetracycline and incubated anaerobically at 37°C for 7 days. Tetracycline-resistant (Tcr) transformants were obtained at the frequency of 3.7 × 10-8/recipient cell. Twenty-four-hour cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C. Ammonium sulfate was added to the culture supernatant to a final concentration of 75% saturation. The precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min and suspended in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.05% Brij 35. After overnight dialysis against the same buffer at 4°C, insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was used as a culture supernatant in this study. On the other hand, bacterial cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.05% Brij 35. Cell extracts were prepared by ultrasonication followed by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 30 min. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to the method of Laemmli(39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). The proteinase inhibitor leupeptin was added to a solubilizing buffer to avoid proteolysis by endogenous proteinases. For immunoblotting, proteins on SDS gels were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes according to the method of Towbin et al.(40Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44843) Google Scholar). The blotted membranes were immunostained with anti-Arg-gingipain IgG, essentially according to the procedure described previously(41Yamamoto K. Takeda M. Yamamoto H. Tatsumi M. Kato Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 97: 821-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Arginine-specific cysteine proteinase activity on the two synthetic substrates, Z-Phe-Arg-MCA and Boc-Phe-Ser-Arg-MCA, was determined by the method described previously (32Kadowaki T. Yoneda M. Okamoto K. Maeda K. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21371-21378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixture (1 ml) contained various amounts of cell extracts or culture supernatants, 10 μM synthetic substrates, and 5 mM cysteine in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). After incubation at 40°C for 10 min, the reaction was terminated by adding 1 ml of 10 mM iodoacetic acid (pH 5.0), and the released 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin was measured at 460 nm (excitation at 380 nm). The casein- and hemoglobin-hydrolyzing activities were determined by measuring acid-soluble products by the method described earlier (42Takeda-Ezaki M. Yamamoto K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 304: 352-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) with slight modification. The reaction mixture (0.5 ml) containing various amounts of culture supernatants, 2.5 mg of casein or bovine hemoglobin, and 1 mM dithiothreitol in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) was incubated at 40°C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.5 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid and keeping on ice for 10 min. After centrifugation, 300 μl of the resulting supernatant were added to 2 ml of 0.2 M borate buffer (pH 8.9) and then mixed with 1 ml of fluorescamine (0.1 mg/ml in acetone). The fluorescence was measured at 475 nm (excitation at 390 nm) on a fluorescence spectrophotometer (model F-3010; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). CL response of PMNs was measured according to the method described previously(32Kadowaki T. Yoneda M. Okamoto K. Maeda K. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21371-21378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, sterilized oyster glycogen (0.2% in saline) was intraperitoneally injected into guinea pigs. At 14 h after the injection, the cells in the peritoneal exudate were collected and washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution (Nissui), and suspended in the same medium. The cell suspension (1 × 107 cells/ml) was preincubated at 37°C for 30 min with the indicated concentrations of bacterial culture supernatants. Then, PMNs were washed with PBS and resuspended in PBS at a final cell concentration of 2 × 107 cells/ml. Zymosan A (20 mg/ml in PBS) was boiled for 10 min and washed with PBS prior to being opsonized to reduce clumping. The zymosan suspension was incubated with an equal volume of serum from guinea pig at 37°C for 30 min. The particles were washed twice with PBS and suspended in the original volume of PBS. The cuvette that contained the reaction mixture consisting of 0.1 ml of freshly diluted luminol solution (0.2 mM), 0.1 ml of the PMNs suspension (2 × 107 cells/ml), and 0.1 ml of the opsonized zymosan (20 mg/ml) was maintained at 37°C in a luminescence analyzer (model LB9505AT; Berthold, Wildbad, Germany). The intensity of light emitted in the cuvette was measured for 30 min. The CL response is expressed by the peak intensity of CL. Overnight cultures of P. gingivalis strains were centrifuged, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in PBS at an optical density at 660 nm of 0.44. The bacterial suspensions were then diluted in a two-fold series with PBS. A 100-μl aliquot each of the dilutions was mixed with an equal volume of sheep erythrocyte suspension (2.5% in PBS) and incubated in a round-bottom microtiter plate at room temperature for 3 h. The hemagglutination titer was determined as the last dilution exhibiting full agglutination. The Arg-gingipain-encoding gene has been cloned from P. gingivalis 381, and its nucleotide sequence has been determined (19Okamoto K. Misumi Y. Kadowaki T. Yoneda M. Yamamoto K. Ikehara Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 917-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Since it was difficult to use this strain for construction of Arg-gingipain-deficient mutants because of its low efficiency in mobilization and electrotransformation, 2K. Nakayama, unpublished results. we chose P. gingivalis ATCC33277 from which we had isolated a superoxide dismutase-deficient mutant by mobilization of a suicide plasmid(33Nakayama K. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1939-1943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether the Arg-gingipain gene is located on the chromosome of P. gingivalis ATCC33277, Southern hybridization of its chromosomal DNA was performed with a 2.8-kbp SmaI fragment of P.g./pUC118 corresponding to the SmaI-PvuII region of Arg-gingipain gene (probe I) as a DNA probe (Fig. 2). Interestingly, probe I DNA hybridized to four and five separate HindIII fragments of the chromosomes of P. gingivalis ATCC33277 and 381, respectively. Since probe I DNA has no HindIII site, the result indicates that P. gingivalis chromosome may possess several regions which share homology with the probe DNA. Then, we analyzed the chromosome of ATCC33277 with other Arg-gingipain gene-associated DNA probes. A 0.7-kbp PstI-EcoRI fragment of pKD279, which corresponded to the SmaI-EcoRV region encoding the amino-terminal region of the proteinase domain (probe II) and an oligonucleotide probe encoding a putative catalytic site for the proteinase (probe III)(19Okamoto K. Misumi Y. Kadowaki T. Yoneda M. Yamamoto K. Ikehara Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 917-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), hybridized to two separate HindIII fragments, suggesting that P. gingivalis ATCC33277 may possess two different chromosomal loci encoding Arg-gingipain (Fig. 2). One of the gene loci (12.5-kbp HindIII fragment) and the other (7.8-kbp HindIII fragment) were tentatively designated rgpA and rgpB, respectively. The rgpA locus was also hybridized with two oligonucleotide probes for the carboxyl-terminal domain of Arg-gingipain (probe IV) and for the region downstream from the Arg-gingipain gene (probe V), whereas the rgpB locus was hybridized with neither of them (Fig. 2). The result suggests that the rgpA locus may encode the carboxyl-terminal domain of Arg-gingipain in addition to the proteinase domain, while the rgpB locus may not. Recently, Pavloff et al.(21Pavloff N. Potempa J. Pike R.N. Prochazka V. Kiefer M.C. Travis J. Barr P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1007-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) have sequenced the Arg-gingipain-1 gene (rgp1) of P. gingivalis H66. Comparison between the amino acid sequences of Arg-gingipain gene of 381 and Arg-gingipain-1 gene of H66 revealed that their proteinase domains were identical but their carboxyl-terminal domains were different (Fig. 2). The Arg-gingipain-1 gene contains three direct repeats of the nucleotide sequence that encodes 17 amino acids starting from YTYTVYRD in its carboxyl-terminal region. A DNA region intervening between the first repeating sequence and the third one is completely deleted from the carboxyl-terminal region of the Arg-gingipain gene. To determine whether the rgpA locus of ATCC33277 contains this intervening sequence, the oligonucleotide probe for the intervening sequence (probe VI) was used. The rgpA locus was hybridized with this probe, and the restriction maps of the rgpA locus of ATCC33277 and the rgp1 locus of H66 were so far identical, suggesting that the rgpA of ATCC33277 is probably equivalent to the rgp1 of H66. From these Southern analyses, we also found that at least two separate chromosomal regions other than the rgpA locus might encode the carboxyl-terminal domain of Arg-gingipain-1. To determine the importance of Arg-gingipain for pathogenecity of P. gingivalis, we constructed Arg-gingipain-deficient mutants via gene disruption by use of a suicide plasmid containing an internal DNA fragment of the Arg-gingipain gene. Thus, Emr transconjugants were obtained after mobilization of pKD280 containing the 0.7-kbp EcoRV-PstI fragment of the Arg-gingipain gene into P. gingivalis ATCC33277. Southern hybridization analysis of the chromosomes of the Emr transconjugants showed that two classes of transconjugants were obtained with respect to the location of the integrated plasmid. In one class (a representative strain, KDP110) the rgpA locus is disrupted, while in the other class (a representative strain, KDP111) disruption occurred at the rgpB locus (Figure 3:, Figure 4:). Thus, integration of pKD280 plasmid DNA into the chromosome at the rgpA locus resulted in the disappearance of the 12.5-kbp hybridizing HindIII fragment and the appearance of the 7.9-kbp"
https://openalex.org/W2060449732,"We reported recently that the gene that encodes tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of catecholamines, is regulated by hypoxia in the dopaminergic cells of the mammalian carotid body (Czyzyk-Krzeska, M. F., Bayliss, D. A., Lawson, E. E. & Millhorn, D. E.(1992) <i>J. Neurochem.</i> 58, 1538-1546) and in pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells (CzyzykKrzeska, M. F., Furnari, B. A., Lawson, E. E. & Millhorn, D. E.(1994) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 269, 760-764). Regulation of this gene during low O<sup>2</sup> conditions occurs at both the level of transcription and RNA stability. Increased transcription during hypoxia is regulated by a region of the proximal promoter that extends from −284 to +27 bases, relative to transcription start site. The present study was undertaken to further characterize the sequences that confer O<sup>2</sup> responsiveness of the TH gene and to identify hypoxia-induced protein interactions with these sequences. Results from chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays identified a region between bases −284 and −150 that contains the essential sequences for O<sup>2</sup> regulation. This region contains a number of regulatory elements including AP1, AP2, and HIF-1. Gel shift assays revealed enhanced protein interactions at the AP1 and HIF-1 elements of the native gene. Further investigations using supershift and shift-Western analysis showed that c-Fos and JunB bind to the AP1 element during hypoxia and that these protein levels are stimulated by hypoxia. Mutation of the AP1 sequence prevented stimulation of transcription of the TH-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene by hypoxia."

https://openalex.org/W2040842912,"We performed a detailed kinetic analysis of the uptake of dehydroascorbic acid by HL-60 cells under experimental conditions that enabled the differentiation of dehydroascorbic acid transport from the intracellular reduction/accumulation of ascorbic acid. Immunoblotting and immunolocalization experiments identified GLUT1 as the main glucose transporter expressed in the HL-60 cells. Kinetic analysis allowed the identification of a single functional activity involved in the transport of dehydroascorbic acid in the HL-60 cells. Transport was inhibited in a competitive manner by both 3-O-methyl-D-glucose and 2-deoxy-D-glucose. In turn, dehydroascorbic acid competitively inhibited the transport of both sugars. A second functional component identified in experiments measuring the accumulation of ascorbic acid appears to be associated with the intracellular reduction of dehydroascorbic acid to ascorbic acid and is not directly involved in the transport of dehydroascorbic acid via GLUT1. Transport of dehydroascorbic acid by HL-60 cells was independent of the presence of external Na+, whereas the intracellular accumulation of ascorbic acid was found to be a Na+-sensitive process. Thus, the transport of dehydroascorbic acid via glucose transporters is a Na+-independent process which is kinetically and biologically separable from the reduction of dehydroascorbic acid to ascorbic acid and its subsequent intracellular accumulation. We performed a detailed kinetic analysis of the uptake of dehydroascorbic acid by HL-60 cells under experimental conditions that enabled the differentiation of dehydroascorbic acid transport from the intracellular reduction/accumulation of ascorbic acid. Immunoblotting and immunolocalization experiments identified GLUT1 as the main glucose transporter expressed in the HL-60 cells. Kinetic analysis allowed the identification of a single functional activity involved in the transport of dehydroascorbic acid in the HL-60 cells. Transport was inhibited in a competitive manner by both 3-O-methyl-D-glucose and 2-deoxy-D-glucose. In turn, dehydroascorbic acid competitively inhibited the transport of both sugars. A second functional component identified in experiments measuring the accumulation of ascorbic acid appears to be associated with the intracellular reduction of dehydroascorbic acid to ascorbic acid and is not directly involved in the transport of dehydroascorbic acid via GLUT1. Transport of dehydroascorbic acid by HL-60 cells was independent of the presence of external Na+, whereas the intracellular accumulation of ascorbic acid was found to be a Na+-sensitive process. Thus, the transport of dehydroascorbic acid via glucose transporters is a Na+-independent process which is kinetically and biologically separable from the reduction of dehydroascorbic acid to ascorbic acid and its subsequent intracellular accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W2123628070,"Interferon-inducible membrane proteins of approximately 17 kDa have been suggested to play a role in the antiproliferative activity of interferons based on (1) their pattern of induction in interferon-sensitive and -resistant cell lines and (2) the ability of a membrane fraction enriched in 17-kDa proteins to inhibit cell growth. To gain insight into the nature of the proteins that mediate the antiproliferative activity of interferons, a monoclonal antibody, 13A5, was generated that reacted specifically with a 17-kDa interferon-inducible cell surface protein. The expression pattern of this 17-kDa protein by human cell lines correlated with sensitivity to the antiproliferative activity of interferons. To obtain information regarding the structure of this protein, the 13A5 antibody was used to screen COS cells transfected with a human cDNA expression library. Sequence analysis of a full-length cDNA clone revealed identity with the 9-27 cDNA, previously isolated on the basis of its interferon inducibility by differential screening. In addition, the 17-kDa protein encoded by the 9-27 gene was shown to be identical to the Leu-13 antigen. Leu-13 was previously identified as a 16-kDa interferon-inducible protein in leukocytes and endothelial cells and is a component of a multimeric complex involved in the transduction of antiproliferative and homotypic adhesion signals. These results suggest a novel level of cellular regulation by interferons involving a membrane protein, encoded by the interferon-inducible 9-27 gene, which associates with other proteins at the cell surface, forming a complex relaying growth inhibitory and aggregation signals."

The chemical structure of MccC7 has been characterized by use of 1H homonuclear and heteronuclear (13C, 13N, 13P) nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy as well as mass spectrometry (1177 ± 1 Da). The heptapeptide Met-Arg-Thr-Gly-Asn-Ala-Asp is substituted at the N terminus by a N-formyl group. The C-terminal substituent consists of the phosphodiester of 5′-adenylic acid and n-aminopropanol (AMPap), which is linked via the phosphorus atom to an amide group, thus forming a phosphoramide. The main chain carbonyl of the C-terminal aspartic acid residue is connected via this amide bond to the modified nucleotide unit. MccC7 and the peptide unit inhibit protein translation in vitro while a synthetic analog of the AMPap substituent is not active. Neither the peptide nor the AMPap molecule has an effect on the growth of MccC7-sensible cells.

Two-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (first dimension, nonreducing conditions; second dimension, reducing conditions) revealed that the immunoprecipitated laminin-5 from a SCC-25 cell fraction consisted of α3, β3, and γ2 monomers, a β3γ2 heterodimer, and an α3β3γ2 heterotrimer. The presence of the β3γ2 heterodimer, but not heterodimers containing an α3 chain and any of the other chains, was suggestive of assembly of laminin-5 proceeding from a β3γ2 heterodimer to an α3β3γ2 heterotrimer. We showed, by cotransfection experiments using full-length recombinant β3 and γ2 chains in a human cell line devoid of endogenous laminin-5, that stable heterodimers can be formed in the absence of α3 chain expression. In the SCC-25 cell fraction, the α3 monomer pool was the smallest of the monomers. Pulse-chase experiments using the cell fraction also indicated that the heterotrimer was assembled after a 10-min pulse and was nearly absent after a 24-h chase. These results are consistent with the synthesis of α3 being limiting for heterotrimer assembly, with rapid association of the α3 chain with β3γ2 heterodimers to form complete heterotrimers. Treatment with tunicamycin reduced the size of each of the laminin-5 subunits, indicating that all chains are glycosylated, but that N-linked glycosylation is not necessary for chain assembly and secretion.

Several studies in human and murine models have suggested that TNF-α release may be dependent on the activity of one or more serine proteases. For example, Nα-p-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester, a specific serine proteinase inhibitor, has been reported to suppress the secretion of TNF-α without affecting the level of TNF-α mRNA or the expression of its cell surface form(6Scuderi P. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 168-173PubMed Google Scholar). Serine proteinase inhibitors were also shown to suppress the secretion of TNF-α from murine activated macrophages(7Kim K.U. Kwon O.J. Jue D.M. Immunology. 1993; 80: 134-139PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, mice pretreated with the serine proteinase inhibitor α1-antitrypsin (α1-AT) were not able to secrete TNF-α in response to D-galactosamine/lipopolysaccharide thus becoming fully protected against D-galactosamine/lipopolysaccharide-induced hepatitis(8Nierörster M. Tiegs G. Schade U.F. Wendel A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 40: 1601-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Recent reports suggest, however, the implication of a metalloprotease in the processing of TNF-α(9Mohler K.M. Sleath P.R. Fitzner J.N. Cerretti D.P. Anderson M. Kerwar S.S. Torrance D.S.

In this report, we describe the processing of in vitro translated 26-kDa TNF-α using cellular fractions derived from human monocytes or monocytic cell lines. Such processing generated active 17-kDa TNF-α and could be blocked with serine proteinase inhibitors. Experimental evidences suggest that proteinase-3 (PR-3) is the enzyme responsible for this in vitro observed activity. The potential physiological relevance of these findings are discussed. Human leukocyte neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G are from Calbiochem Biochemicals. PR-3 and sera containing anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA) were obtained from Wieslab AB (Lund, Sweden). α1-AT, 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin (DCIC), E-64 (trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane), leupeptin, and pepstatin were purchased from Sigma. Methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val chloromethylketone (MeOSuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-CMK) was from Bachem, Inc. (Torrance, CA). Human secretory protease inhibitor (hSLPI) was from R& systems (Abingdon, UK). Synthetic substrates MeOSuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-pNA and MeOSuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Met-pNA were from Sigma. HL-60, U937, Raji, and Jurkat human cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD. Cells were grown in suspension (at 37°C, 5% CO2) in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mM Hepes, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mML-glutamine, 1% penicillin and streptomycin. Human monocytes were obtained from healthy donors' leukophoresis bags. Briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were separated by standard Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation. The enriched population of monocytes and lymphocytes were plated into dishes containing RPMI supplemented with fetal calf serum and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. The dishes were extensively washed with RPMI, leaving only adherent monocytes. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells were collected by centrifugation at 1200 rpm, resuspended at a density of 108/ml in lysis buffer (Tris, 10 mM, pH 7.5, EDTA, 1 mM), and homogenized at 200 rpm with a motor-driven Potter-Elvehjem (Teflon/glass) homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min. Pellets were discarded, and the supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 160,000 × g for 2 h. The cytosol fractions (supernatants) were stored at −80°C, and pellets containing membrane/particulate fraction were resuspended at a density of 7 × 108 cells/ml in membrane buffer (10 mM Tris, 250 mM sucrose), homogenized with 15 passes of the Teflon/glass homogenizer at 200 rpm, and stored at −80°C. The protein concentrations of the fractions were determined by a colorimetric BCA assay (Pierce). A 0.8-kilobase cDNA, obtained from HL-60 RNA and containing the entire coding sequence of TNF-α precursor, was inserted into KpnI/SacI-digested pBS-SK+ plasmid DNA and propagated in Escherichia coli. Purified plasmid was transcribed in vitro by using a T7 RNA polymerase and translated in vitro in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (TNTTM T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system, Promega Biotech Inc.) in the presence of 40 μCi of [35S]Cys (1 mCi = 37 MBq; Amersham Corp.) for 1 h at 30°C to produce [35S]Cys-labeled 26-kDa TNF-α. Cleavage of TNF-α precursor was performed by incubating 200 μl of in vitro translated TNF-α precursor with different amounts of crude membrane cellular extract in a final volume of 1.5 ml in 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol. Each reaction was incubated for 1 h at 30°C and immunoprecipitated with 10 μl of rabbit anti-human TNF-α polyclonal antisera (PS30, Monosan) and 60 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia). Sepharose pellets were washed four times, resuspended, and boiled for 3 min in 80 μl of 0.25 M Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 0.5% bromphenol blue, 0.5 M dithiothreitol, and 50% glycerol. Samples were migrated on a 13.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and autoradiographied. Mutants were generated by polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotides encoding an Ala/Val site where the valine residue at position +1 is either deleted or substituted by glycine or alanine. Two overlapping fragments were generated in a initial reaction using as template a wild-type TNF-α precursor cDNA obtained from HL-60 RNA and a complementary set of oligonucleotides, both of which include the point mutation. In a subsequent reaction the two fragments were joined using flanking oligonucleotides as primers. TNF-delVal1 mutant, where the amino acid valine at position +1 is deleted, was obtained with a 33-mer oligonucleotide (upstream) 5′- TCGAGAAGATGATCTTGCCTGGGCCAGAGGGCT-3′ and a 28-mer oligonucleotide (downstream) 5′-GGCCCAGGCAAGATCATCTTCTCGAACC-3′. TNF-Gly1 mutant, where the amino acid valine at position +1 is substituted by a glycine, was obtained with a 24-mer oligonucleotide (upstream) 5′- TCGAGAAGATGATCTGCCTGCCTG-3′ and a 24-mer oligonucleotide (downstream) 5′-CAGGCAGGCAGATCATCTTCTCGA-3′. TNF-Ala1 mutant, where the amino acid valine at position +1 is substituted by an alanine, was obtained with a 24-mer oligonucleotide (upstream) 5′-TCGAGAAGATGATCTGGCTGCCTG-3′ and a 24-mer oligonucleotide (downstream) 5′-CAGGCAGCCAGATCATCTTCTCGA-3′. The cDNAs encoding for the mutated TNF-α proteins were cloned into the KpnI/SacI-digested pBS-SK+ plasmid DNA. The mutations were verified by sequence analysis. The TNF-α precursor was translated in vitro as described above except that 80 μCi of L-[3,4-3H]valine (1 mCi = 37 MBq; Amersham) was used as radiolabeled amino acid. Cleavage reactions were performed using 100 μg of HL-60 membrane proteins or 1 μg of purified PR-3. Radiolabeled TNF-α product was purified from the processing reaction by migration on SDS-PAGE gel followed by transfer to poly(vinylidene difluoride) membrane. NH2-terminal sequencing of radiolabeled cleavage product was performed by automated Edman degradation on a 470 A gas phase microsequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). Each degradation cycle product was counted in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments). Proteolysis of the synthetic substrates for elastase and PR-3 (MeO-Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-pNA) or cathepsin G (MeO-Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Met-pNA) was assayed in 200 μl, total volume, consisting of 2 mM of the corresponding substrate in PBS with 0.1% (v/v) Tween-80, 1.25%(v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide, and 25 nM enzyme. pNA release was followed by continuously measuring the change of absorbance at 405 nm at 30°C during a 1-h period using a Microplate reader ThermoMax (Molecular Devices). Specific activities determined under these conditions for elastase, PR-3, and cathepsin G were 20, 0.2, and 6 units/mg, respectively. One unit corresponds to 1 μmol/min released pNA. Crude membrane and cytosol fractions were prepared from the myelomonocytic cell lines HL-60 and U937 as well as from human monocytes and tested for their ability to cleave in vitro translated and [35S]Cys radiolabeled 26-kDa TNF-α. Reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography after immunoprecipitation with an anti-TNF-α polyclonal antibody. While cytosol fractions did not exhibit any processing activity, incubation of TNF-α precursor with crude membrane fractions prepared from these cells generated a 17-kDa band that comigrated with a recombinant 35I-labeled TNF-α (Fig. 1A). A 24-kDa band could be systematically detected under these conditions. In the in vitro assay, the crude membrane extract derived from HL-60 was significantly more active than those from monocytes and U937. No processing could be observed when TNF-α precursor was incubated with crude membranes obtained from Jurkat (human T cell line) or Raji (human B cell line). Titration of HL-60 membrane fractions showed that the processing activity was dose-dependent (Fig. 1B). Thus 100 μg of total protein derived from the HL-60 membrane fraction almost completely processed the 26-kDa precursor in 60 min. Interestingly, when 100 μg of crude membrane extracts were used in the assay, the 24-kDa band disappeared, suggesting that this band could result of the use of an intermediate cleavage site located in the 14-kDa precursor portion of TNF-α. When assayed using the L929 assay, the cleavage product was as active as the precursor form, indicating that the 17-kDa protein resulting from the in vitro processing was biologically active (data not shown). In order to characterize the enzymatic nature of the proteolytic activity found in the crude membrane extracts of HL-60, we tested the effect of a series of protease inhibitors in the TNF-α cleavage assay. The results shown in Fig. 2indicate that the serine proteinase inhibitors DCIC, α1-AT, and MeO-Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-CMK efficiently inhibited the generation of 17-kDa TNF-α by HL-60 membrane proteins. In contrast, E-64, pepstatin, EDTA, and leupeptin, which are specific inhibitors of cysteine, aspartate, metallo, and serine/cysteine proteinases, respectively, failed to inhibit the in vitro processing of TNF-α. These results strongly suggest that the in vitro TNF-α processing activity detected in HL-60 membrane proteins is dependent on one or several serine proteinases. In order to further confirm previous results, we studied the in vitro processing activity of three purified serine proteinases: human leukocyte elastase, cathepsin G, and PR-3. As shown in Fig. 3, whereas cathepsin G did not efficiently process the TNF-α precursor, elastase and PR-3 generated a 17-kDa protein in a dose-dependent manner. It should be noted that PR3 was more efficient than elastase to generate the 17-kDa TNF-α. Moreover PR-3 reproduced the same pattern of proteolysis (17- and 24-kDa bands) previously found with HL-60 membrane fractions. Among the natural serine proteinase inhibitors, the secretory leukoproteinase inhibitor (SLPI) has been shown to inhibit both elastase and cathepsin G but not PR-3(12Rao N.V. Wehner N.G.

Biol. 1993; 8: 612-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The proteolytic activity of elastase and PR-3 on the synthetic substrate MeO-Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-pNA was studied in the presence of different concentrations of recombinant SLPI. This molecule completely inhibited the elastase activity at a 5:1 molar ratio without affecting the PR-3 activity (data not shown). In the in vitro TNF-α cleavage assay, SLPI (1 μg) inhibited the weak processing activity of elastase without affecting the PR-3 one (Fig. 4). In addition, the same concentration of SLPI did not inhibit the processing activity of HL-60 membrane fraction, suggesting that elastase was not implicated in this reaction.Figure 4:Effects of SLPI on TNF-α in vitro processing. Aliquots of 800 ng of elastase, 80 ng of PR-3, or 100 μg of HL-60 crude membrane preparation proteins were incubated with 1 μg of SLPI for 10 min at room temperature before cleavage assay on the in vitro translated TNF-α precursor, immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography. Results were analyzed by scanning and are expressed as percentage of the activity found in controls performed in the absence of SLPI.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Classic ANCA are specific markers for active WG.

Recently, IgG from patients with active WG were shown to significantly inhibit PR-3 proteolytic activity(17van de Wiel B.A. Dolman K.M. van der Meer-Gerritsen C.H. Hack C.E. von dem Borne Jr., A.E.G. Goldschmeding R. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1992; 90: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We therefore evaluated the inhibitory capacity of IgGs purified from five WG patients' sera on the PR-3 enzymatic activity measured on the synthetic substrate MeO-Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-pNA. IgG derived from the serum IO5•PR inhibited the PR-3 activity at a 50-fold molar excess without affecting the activity of elastase. The incubation of purified PR-3 or elastase with 100 μg of IO5 IgGs inhibited the PR-3 but not the elastase-mediated TNF-α in vitro processing activity (data not shown). At the same concentration, IO5 IgGs completely inhibited the processing activity of the monocytes and HL-60-derived membrane fractions (Fig. 5). These results support that PR-3 is most probably the enzyme responsible for the in vitro cleavage of 26-kDa TNF-α by HL-60 or monocyte-derived crude membrane preparations. We have constructed three mutants in which the residue Val77 (the NH2-terminal amino acid in the secreted TNF-α) has been either deleted or substituted by Gly or Ala. HL-60-derived membrane preparations were unable to generate any 17-kDa protein from either the deleted (Fig. 6) or glycine-substituted (data not shown) mutants. Interestingly, the generation of the 24-kDa band was not modified in these two mutants. In contrast, any major changes could be detected in the mutant in which Val77 was substituted by an Ala (data not shown). These results indicate that Val77 is crucial for the in vitro detected TNF-α processing activity. To identify the amino terminus of the 17-kDa cleavage product, [3H]Val-labeled 26-kDa TNF-α was cleaved by HL-60-derived membrane fraction, immunoprecipitated, electrophoresed, transferred to poly(vinylidene difluoride) membrane, and subjected to automated sequencing. Peaks of radiolabeled Val were detected at cycles 12, 15, and 16 (Fig. 7). The same radioactivity pattern was observed when purified PR-3 was used in the in vitro cleavage assay (data not shown). Our results show that cleavage of the TNF-α precursor by both PR-3 and HL-60 membrane preparations occurs between Val77 and Arg78.Figure 7:Sequence analysis of 17-kDa cleavage product. [3H]Val-labeled TNF-α precursor was cleaved with 100 μg of HL-60 crude membrane preparation proteins and the cleavage product was sequenced after SDS-PAGE and transferred to poly(vinylidene difluoride) membrane. Fractions from the sequence run were counted for associated radioactivity. Peaks of radioactivity were found in cycles 12, 15, and 16 corresponding to the Val amino acids of mature TNF-α, which are plotted on the ordinate axis. Amino acids are depicted by the single-letter code.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Using an in vitro TNF-α precursor cleavage assay, we have identified a serine proteinase activity in the crude membrane fractions from monocytic cells, which is capable of generating a bioactive 17-kDa TNF-α form. Experiments carried out to characterize the enzymatic nature of this activity suggest that the neutral serine proteinase PR-3 or a related enzyme is responsible for this effect. First, purified PR-3 processed the TNF-α precursor with a pattern identical to the one obtained with the crude membrane preparations. In addition to the 17-kDa protein, a 24-kDa band was observed when the TNF-α precursor was incubated with active membrane fractions or PR-3. Second, SLPI, a natural serine anti-proteinase secreted by cells of mucosal surfaces that interacts with both cathepsin G and elastase but is devoid of inhibitory activity against PR-3(12Rao N.V.

Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1993; 8: 612-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), did not affect the proteolytic activity of the membrane preparations. Third, purified IgG prepared from an ANCA-positive serum (previously shown to specifically interfere with the PR-3 in vitro proteolytic activity) completely inhibited the in vitro processing activity of the membrane fractions. Finally, the NH2-terminal sequence of the 17-kDa product derived from the proteolysis with both crude membrane extracts or purified PR-3 were shown to be identical. Different biological properties of PR-3 have been reported. PR-3 degrades a variety of extracellular matrix proteins including elastin (18Kao R.C. Wehner N.G. Skubitz K.M. Gray B.H. Hoidal J.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 1963-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), fibronectin, type IV collagen, and laminin(12Rao N.V. Wehner N.G. Marshall B.C. Gray W.R. Gray B.H. Hoidal J.R. J. Biol.

It cleaves and inactivates the human C1 inhibitor leading to activation of the classical complement pathway(21Wes Leid R. Ballieux B.E.P.B. van der Heijden I. Kleyburg-van der Keur C.

Halbwachs-Macarelli L. Nusbaum P. Lesavre P. Chignard M. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4612-4617PubMed Google Scholar) and may play an important role in neutrophil-mediated endothelial damage(23Ballieux B.E.P.B. Hiemstra P.S. Klar-Mohamad N.

Finally, PR-3 has been shown to process in vitro interleukin-8 (24Padrines M. Wolf M. Walz A. Baggiolini M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and the nuclear factor-κB subunit p65(25Franzoso G. Biswas P. Poli G. Carlson L.M. Brown K.D. Tomita-Yamaguchi M. Fauci A.S. Siebenlist U.K. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1445-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). At the cellular level, PR-3 is not only localized in the azurophil granules of granulocytes, but is also present in small granules of monocytes(26Csernok E. Lüdemann J. Gross W.L. Bainton D.F. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 137: 1113-1120PubMed Google Scholar), in human endothelial cells(27Mayet W.-J. Csernok E. Szymkowiak C. Gross W.L. Meyer zum Büschenfelde K.-H. Blood. 1993; 82: 1221-1229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in mastocytes(28Braun M.G. Csernok E. Gross W.L. Müller-Hermelink H.-K. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 139: 831-838PubMed Google Scholar). Several stimuli such as TNF-α or IL-8 can even induce translocation of PR-3 from the intragranular loci to the cell surface of polymorphonuclear leukocytes(29Csernok E. Ernst M. Schmitt W. Bainton D.F. Gross W.L. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1994; 95: 244-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that PR-3 is capable of cleaving in vitro synthesized TNF-α precursor in a site-specific manner between Val77 and Arg78, thus generating a 17-kDa TNF-α with an Arg at its NH2 terminus. The importance of this site was confirmed by using TNF-α mutants in which Val77 was either deleted or changed by Ala or Gly (Fig. 6). Accordingly, studies previously conducted to map the active site of PR-3 showed that the preferred P1 residue is a small aliphatic amino acid such as valine or alanine(30Brubaker M.J. Groutas W.C. Hoidal J.R. Rao N.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1992; 188: 1318-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As described above, an additional 24-kDa band was generated in the in vitro cleavage assay by PR-3, thus indicating the existence of a second proteolytic site in the TNF-α precursor. This second proteolytic site is more probably located in the 14-kDa prosequence because (i) it disappeared with high amounts of membrane preparations (Fig. 1B) or when longer incubation times were performed (data not shown), and (ii) membrane preparations did not cleave the recombinant soluble 17-kDa TNF-α (data not shown). A potential site theoretically susceptible to generate a 24-kDa protein is located between alanine 15 and leucine 16. This is in agreement with the studies on the primary specificity of PR-3 against the insulin-B chain showing that a major site of cleavage was an alanine/leucine bond(12Rao N.V. Wehner N.G. Marshall B.C. Gray W.R. Gray B.H. Hoidal J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9540-9548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the existence of a Zn2+-containing endopeptidase capable of cleaving the 26-kDa TNF-α to a 17-kDa form beginning at Val77 was reported(9Mohler K.M. Sleath P.R. Fitzner J.N. Cerretti D.P.

Val77 was previously shown to correspond to the NH2 terminus of the TNF-α secreted by cultured cell lines(31Aggarwal B.B. Kohr W.J. Hass P.E. Moffat B. Spencer S.A. Henzel W.J. Bringman T.S.

This, together with the in vivo efficacy of metalloprotease inhibitors to block TNF-α secretion(9Mohler K.M. Sleath P.R. Fitzner J.N. Cerretti D.P. Anderson M. Kerwar S.S. Torrance D.S. Otten-Evans C. Greenstreet T. Weerawarna K. Kronheim S.R. Petersen M. Gerhart M. Kozlosky C.J. March C.J. Black R.A.

Wood L.M. Woolley K. Nature. 1994; 370: 555-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar), strongly suggests that the enzyme primarily responsible for TNF-α processing is a metalloprotease. Our results suggest, however, that accessory sites and perhaps accessory enzymes could exist to generate active TNF-α. Indeed, we demonstrated that Val77-Arg78 is a possible alternative cleavage site. Additional sites could exist since it was shown that deletion of residues between Val77 and Pro78 did not affect the generation of active TNF-α(33Perez C. Albert I. DeFay K. Zachariades N. Gooding L. Kriegler M. Cell. 1990; 63: 251-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Furthermore, pulse-chase studies suggest that the processing of TNF-α primarily takes place at the cell surface(34Jue D.-M. Sherry B. Luedke C. Manogue K.R. Cerami A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8371-8377Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 35Crowe P.D. Walter B.N. Mohler K.M. Otten-Evans C. Black R.A. Ware C.F. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), raising the possibility of an extracellular cleavage of TNF-α by serum proteinases. Interestingly, PR-3 is present in large amounts in the serum of normal subjects and its levels are significantly high in patients with connective tissue disease(36Henshaw T.J. Malone C.C. Gabay J.E. Williams Jr., R.C. Arthritis Rheum. 1994; 37: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Along with this line, the serine proteinase inhibitor α1-AT was shown to block TNF-α release in vitro(37Scuderi P. Dorr R.T. Liddil J.D. Finley P.R. Meltzer P. Raitano A.B. Rybski J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 939-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and in vivo(8Nierörster M. Tiegs G. Schade U.F. Wendel A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 40: 1601-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). More recently, the TNF-α concentration in synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis patients was shown to be inversely correlated with α1-AT activity (38Chidwick K. Whichelow C.E. Zhang Z. Fairburn K. Sachs J.A. Blake D.R. Winyard P.G. Arthritis Rheum. 1994; 37: 1723-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Altogether our results show that PR-3 can play a role in cleaving the TNF-α precursor to generate a bioactive form. The relevance of PR-3-mediated TNF-α processing under normal and pathological situations remains to be elucidated. We thank Drs. A. Diu, H. Fridman, and R. Westwood for stimulating discussions and critical reading of the manuscript. We are also grateful to Dr. F. Fassy for help with some experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2119997930,"A set of five mutations (A62V, V75I, F77L, F116Y, and Q151M) in the polymerase domain of reverse transcriptase (RT) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), which confers on the virus a reduced sensitivity to multiple therapeutic dideoxynucleosides (ddNs), has been identified. In this study, we defined the biochemical properties of RT with such mutations by using site-directed mutagenesis, overproduction of recombinant RTs, and steady-state kinetic analyses. A single mutation, Q151M, which developed first among the five mutations in patients receiving therapy, most profoundly reduced the sensitivity of RT to multiple ddN 5′-triphosphates (ddNTPs). Addition of other mutations to Q151M further reduced the sensitivity of RT to ddNTPs. RT with the five mutations proved to be resistant by 65-fold to 3′-azido-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine 5′-triphosphate (AZTTP), 12-fold to ddCTP, 8.8-fold to ddATP, and 3.3-fold to 2′,3′-dideoxyguanosine 5′-triphosphate (ddGTP), compared with wild-type RT (RTwt). Steady-state kinetic studies revealed comparable catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of RTs carrying combined mutations as compared with that of RTwt (<3-fold), although a marked difference was noted in inhibition constants (Ki) (e.g.Ki of a mutant RT carrying the five mutations was 62-fold higher for AZTTP than that of RTwt). Thus, we conclude that the alteration of RT's substrate recognition, caused by these mutations, accounts for the observed multi-ddN resistance of HIV-1. The features of multi-ddNTP-resistant RTs should provide insights into the molecular mechanism of RT discriminating ddNTPs from natural substrates.

It has been shown that the high error rate of HIV-1 RT, approximately 1-10 misincorporations/HIV-1 genome/round of replication(7Preston B.D. Poiesz B.J. Loeb L.A.

Loeb L.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 954-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), suggests that misincorporation by HIV-1 RT is responsible for the hypermutability of HIV-1, enabling HIV-1 to rapidly acquire drug resistance. This notable diversity of HIV-1 genome resulting from error-prone RT is likely to be associated with “natural” drug resistance seen in HIV-1 from patients receiving no prior antiretroviral therapy(10Nájera I. Holguín A. Quiñones-Mateu M.E. Muñoz-Fernández M.A. Nájera R. López-Galíndez C. Domingo E. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 23-31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this regard, the combined use of multiple antiretroviral agents has been postulated to block or retard the emergence of HIV-1 less susceptible to therapeutic agents. However, several recent reports have demonstrated that HIV-1 can acquire resistance to multiple drugs in vitro and in vivo(11Shirasaka T. Yarchoan R. O'Brien M. Husson R. Anderson B. Kojima E.

These data may suggest that even combination therapy may ultimately fail to suppress the replication of this hypermutable virus, although it is possible that combination chemotherapy continues to be efficacious if HIV-1 variants have a substantial replication disadvantage due to the altered enzymatic conformation/function as compared with wild type HIV-1; thus, the progression of the disease may be significantly delayed(17Coffin J.M.

Two restriction sites, XmaI and NheI, were introduced to pTZRT2 without deduced amino acid substitution (Fig. 1), and the first amino acid, proline, was substituted with alanine (an original BH10 amino acid), resulting in the loss of the NcoI site, giving rise to pTZRT06. The XmaI-NheI region of pTZRT06 was replaced with the XmNh oligonucleotide linker (5′-CCGGGATTTGATAGTCTAGAACAG-3′), generating pTZRT07, which was digested with EcoRI and HindIII and reinserted into pKRT2, generating pKRT07. An XmaI-NheI fragment excised from pTZRT06 was subcloned to pTZT, whose multicloning site of pTZ19R had been replaced with a linker (5′-AATTCGACGTCGTTAACGGGCCCGCCGGCCCCGGGCTAGCTGGCCAT-3′) containing XmaI and NheI sites, generating pTZNX1. The entire RT-encoding regions of pTZRT07 and pTZNX1 were sequenced by the dideoxy sequencing method using Sequenase version 2 (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) as directed in the manufacturer's protocol, confirming the absence of any base substitutions other than the intended mutations. Mutations of interest (A62V, V75I, F77L, F116Y, and Q151M) were introduced by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using the plus strand of pTZNX1 as a template. Mutagenesis was carried out by introducing one mutation in each mutagenesis reaction. Additional mutations were introduced by the same method as needed. Insertion of these intended mutations was confirmed by determination of nucleotide sequence. To construct a wild-type RT expression vector, pKRT08, the XmaI-NheI fragment of pTZNX1 replaced the XmNh linker region of pKRT07. Escherichia coli JM109 (Promega, Madison, WI), transformed with a wild-type or mutant RT expression vector, were cultured overnight in ampicillin (100 μg/ml)-containing 2 × YT medium (0.32 g of tryptophane, 0.2 g of yeast extract, 0.1 g of NaCl, in 20 ml of distilled water), further propagated in the same medium (200 ml) with shaking for 2 h at 37°C and then exposed to 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactoside and cultured for an additional 7 h. Cells were harvested, frozen at −20°C overnight, thawed on ice, suspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50% sucrose, 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 50 μg/ml lysozyme), and then disrupted by osmotic shock through rapid dilution with 10 ml of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA). Following a 15-min incubation on ice, the cell lysate was subjected to sonication and centrifugation, and the supernatant recovered was dialyzed against 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl overnight at 4°C. This RT-containing fraction was applied to a DE52-packed disposable column (5-ml bed, pre-equilibrated with the dialysis buffer), and the RT-containing flow-through fraction was collected. This pooled fraction was then applied to a Sepharose 4B column (1-ml bed) coupled to an RT-specific monoclonal antibody, M33, which reacts with both 51- (p51) and 66- (p66) kDa subunits of RT as described previously by Di Marzo Veronese et al.(19Di Marzo Veronese F. Copeland T.D. DeVico A.L. Rahman R. Oroszlan S. Gallo R.C. Sarngadharan M.G. Science. 1986; 231: 1289-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) and pre-equilibrated with 100 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl. Following thorough washing (15 ml) with the equilibration buffer, RT was eluted with 200 mM glycine-HCl, pH 2.8, and the RT-containing fraction was immediately neutralized with volume of 1 M Tris. This RT preparation was concentrated using a Centricon-30 concentrator (Amicon, MA), dialyzed against 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 3 mM dithiothreitol overnight at 4°C, and stored at −70°C until use. The purity of thus prepared RT-derived polypeptides was >90% as assessed by a polyacrylamide gel analysis (see “Results”). Four different template-primers were employed in enzymatic assays with RT, depending on the nucleotide substrate examined: three homopolymeric template-primers (poly(rA)•(dT)12-18, poly(rC)•(dG)12-18, and poly(rI)•(dC)12-18) and a heteropolymeric template-primer (MS2/22A). DNA primer 22A (5′-CGTTAGCCACTCCGAAGTGCGT-3′) was complementary to nucleotides 3326-3347 of phage MS2 genomic RNA(23Fiers W. Contreras R. Duerinck F. Haegeman G. Iserentant D. Merregaert J. Min Jou W. Molemans F. Raeymaekers A. Van den Berghe A. Volckaert G. Ysebaert M. Nature. 1976; 260: 500-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). When MS2/22A is used as a template-primer, the first and second incoming nucleotide substrates should be dATP and dTTP, respectively. The molar ratios of RNA template and DNA primer used were 2:1 and 1:1 for homopolymeric and heteropolymeric template-primers, respectively. All DNA and RNA were dissolved in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA, to yield appropriate concentrations. Template and primer solutions were combined, heated to 75°C for 5 min, and cooled slowly to room temperature over 1 h. Annealed template-primers were stored at −20°C until use. Products from experiments using 3H-labeled nucleotides were analyzed using a DE81 filter (Whatman) binding assay. In order to remove unincorporated [3H]nucleotides, filters were washed four times in 2 × SSC (0.3 M NaCl, 0.03 M sodium citrate, pH 7.0), twice in ethanol, and once in acetone and dried in the air. The amount of [3H]nucleotides incorporated into DNA and adsorbed on the filter was determined in liquid scintillation fluid using a scintillation counter. Buffer compositions of reaction mixtures used for determination of susceptibilities of RT were as follows: buffer A, used for poly(rA)•(dT)12-18 and poly(rC)•(dG)12-18, contained 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 6 mM MgCl2, 0.01% Triton X-100, and either 10 μM [3H]dTTP or [3H]dGTP in a total volume of 50 μl, respectively; buffer B, used for poly(rI)•(dC)12-18, contained 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 20 μM [3H]dCTP in a total volume of 50 μl; buffer C, used for MS2/22A, contained 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 6 mM MgCl2, 150 mM KCl, 0.01% Triton X-100, 20 μM [3H]dATP, and 200 μM each of the remaining dNTPs. The KCl concentration used (150 mM) in buffer C was chosen as an optimal concentration as assessed by the incorporation activity using the wild-type RT (RTwt). The concentration of RT in each reaction was 0.5-1.5 nM (see “Results” for determining concentrations of active RT molecules). Concentrations of homopolymeric template-primers and MS2/22A were 0.5 and 0.1 μM (expressed as 3′-hydroxyl primer termini), respectively. Reactions were initiated by raising the reaction temperature from 0 to 37°C, and the reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 37°C and quenched by 25 μl of 0.5 M EDTA. Products were analyzed by a DE81 filter binding assay as described above. The buffer used for steady-state kinetic analysis for the homopolymeric template-primers was the same as buffer A or B with the exception of [3H]dNTP concentrations and the volume of reaction mixture (100 μl). The buffer composition for conducting a single nucleotide incorporation assay using 0.5 μM MS2/22A (expressed as 3′-hydroxyl primer termini) was the same as that of buffer C except that only [3H]dATP was present as a nucleotide substrate. Enzyme concentrations used were 1-3 nM for homopolymeric template-primer and 5-10 nM for MS2/22A. After the reaction mixtures were equilibrated at 37°C, the reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme at 37°C. Portions of the reaction mixture (15 or 20 μl) were removed periodically four or five times during the course of the assay and spotted on a DE81 filter, and the radioactivity in the product formed was counted as described above. The Km, Ki, and Vmax values were determined from initial linear steady-state velocities with Lineweaver-Burk plot analyses, and the kcat values were calculated by dividing Vmax by active enzyme concentrations. Wild-type RT (designated RTwt) and all mutant RTs were overproduced at about 1 mg of protein/200-ml culture and were purified using a Sepharose 4B column coupled to a monoclonal antibody, M33(19Di Marzo Veronese F. Copeland T.D. DeVico A.L. Rahman R. Oroszlan S. Gallo R.C. Sarngadharan M.G. Science. 1986; 231: 1289-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Thus obtained RT-derived polypeptides were >90% pure as assessed by an SDS-polyacrylamide gel analysis with Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (Fig. 2). Although the mature HIV-1-associated RT is a heterodimer of p51 and p66(19Di Marzo Veronese F. Copeland T.D. DeVico A.L. Rahman R. Oroszlan S. Gallo R.C. Sarngadharan M.G. Science. 1986; 231: 1289-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), all RT preparations produced were p66-dominant with a small amount of two truncated proteins of molecular masses of 62 and 55 kDa. Extended incubation of the p66-containing cytoplasm fraction (overnight at room temperature) did not change the p66/p51 ratio but decreased the total RT activity (data not shown). In order to confirm that p66 homodimer RT preparations were suitable for the study of substrate recognitions between RTwt and mutant RT preparations, we subjected a p51/p66 heterodimer RTwt(21Mizrahi V. Lazarus G.M. Miles L.M. Meyers C.A. Debouck C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 273: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) to our assay system. With regard to dTMP incorporation into poly(rA)•(dT)12-18, the Km and kcat values of the p51/p66 heterodimer RTwt were 3.3 ± 0.8 μM and 2.0 ± 0.1 s-1, respectively (data not shown). These values were comparable with the Km and kcat values of our p66 homodimer RTwt, being 6.5 ± 0.5 μM and 1.8 ± 0.3 s-1, respectively (Table 2). Indeed, Beard et al.(24Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9745-9753Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that the two forms of RTwt, homodimer (p66/p66) and heterodimer (p51/p66), have comparable kinetic parameters of enzyme-template/primer interactions, concluding that the homodimeric form of RT can serve as a model for the interactions of heterodimeric form of RT with template-primers.Table II Open table in a new tab We first asked which of the five mutations (A62V, V75I, F77L, F116Y, and Q151M), seen in HIV-1 variants isolated from patients receiving combination chemotherapy(11Shirasaka T.

Virol. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), had the most profound effect on the sensitivity of RT against ddNTPs (Table 1). The A62V mutant RT (designated RT62) was slightly more sensitive to all ddNTPs examined, relative to RTwt. The V75I mutant RT (RT75) was slightly less sensitive to ddNTPs except to ddATP, and both F77L and F116Y mutant RTs (RT77 and RT116, respectively) had IC50 values to ddNTPs tested comparable with that of RTwt. In contrast, the Q151M mutant RT (RT151) proved to be substantially less sensitive to all ddNTPs tested (Table 1).Table I Open table in a new tab In order to examine the effects of various combinations of mutations on the sensitivity of RT against ddNTPs, we introduced four mutations (A62V, V75I, F77L, F116Y) in addition to the Q151M mutation. In contrast to inconsiderable changes observed with single substitution of each of these four amino acids, combined mutations brought about marked increases in IC50 values (Table 1, Fig. 3). RT with four mutations (RT75/77/116/151) and that with all five mutations (RT62/75/77/116/151) had the most profound effect on the sensitivity of RT to ddNTPs tested (Table 1). We also examined the sensitivity of selected RTs to a non-nucleoside RT inhibitor, nevirapine(22Merluzzi V.J. Hargrave K.D. Labadia M. Grozinger K. Skoog M. Wu J.C. Shih C.-K. Eckner K. Hattox S.

Science. 1990; 250: 1411-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar), using [3H]dGTP and poly(rC)•(dG)12-18 as a nucleotide substrate and a template-primer, respectively. The IC50 values of nevirapine with RTwt and RT62/75/77/116/151 were 0.50 and 0.59 μM, respectively. These results are consistent with our previous observations that the infectious mutant HIV-1 carrying all five mutations was as sensitive to nevirapine as wild-type HIV-1(18Shirasaka T. Kavlick M.F. Ueno T. Gao W.-Y. Kojima E. Alcaide M.L. Chokekijchai S. Roy B.M. Arnold E. Yarchoan R. Mitsuya H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2398-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Because of the nature of immunoaffinity chromatography, it was possible that improperly unfolded and/or degraded proteins were co-purified with active enzyme molecules. We therefore determined the concentration of active RT using the method previously described by Reardon and Miller(26Reardon J.E. Miller W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20302-20307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the dissociation of enzyme•template-primer complex (koff) is slow relative to the rate of polymerization, the amplitude of the burst formation at a pre-steady state under the condition of single nucleotide incorporation is stoichiometric with regard to the number of active enzyme molecules(26Reardon J.E. Miller W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20302-20307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Reardon J.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4473-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 28Kati W.M.

In this assay, the incorporation of a single [3H]dAMP to heteropolymeric RNA/DNA template-primer (MS2/22A) mediated by any of five RT preparations tested (RTwt, RT151, RT75/77/116/151, RT62/75/77/116/151, RT151/215) was biphasic with respect to time (as shown in Fig. 4). The burst formation was observed with slow steady-state rates of 0.024, 0.016, 0.012, 0.015, and 0.022 s-1 for RTwt, RT151, RT75/77/116/151, RT62/75/77/116/151, and RT151/215, respectively. These rates were in agreement with kcat values determined by Lineweaver-Burk analyses (Table II, Table III, Table IV, Table V), and also agreed with previously reported values ranging 0.0065-0.06 s-1 for RTwt(26Reardon J.E.

A. 1993; 90: 6135-6139Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). From the replot of the burst amplitudes (extrapolated y intercept) versus RT amounts added in the reactions, the concentration of active RT was determined (as shown in Fig. 4). These data indicated that approximately 40% of the total protein in the RT preparations represented active RT molecules.Table III Open table in a new tab Table IV Open table in a new tab Table V Open table in a new tab We also determined steady-state kinetic constants of RTwt and mutant RT preparations in processive (using poly(rA)•(dT)12-18 or poly(rC)•(dG)12-18 as a template-primer) and distributive (using poly(rI)•(dC)12-18 or MS2/22A as a template-primer) modes. It was found that steady-state constants of RTwt to natural substrates were in the range previously reported by other groups(12Im G.-J. Tramontano E. Gonzalez C.J. Cheng Y.-C. Biochem.

This receptor harbors at the amino terminus a cluster of eight tandemly arranged repeats typical of the ligand binding domains of members of this family and is designated low density lipoprotein receptor relative with 8 repeats (LR8). Here, we demonstrate by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, Northern, and Western blot analyses that the chicken expresses two forms of LR8, which are generated by differential splicing of an exon encoding a serine- and threonine-rich region characteristic of LRs, termed O-linked sugar domain. The female germ cell of the chicken expresses extremely high levels of the short form of LR8 (LR8-), i.e. the 95-kDa protein; in contrast, somatic cells express lower but detectable levels of the form containing the O-linked sugar domain (LR8+). The main sites of LR8+ expression in the chicken are the heart and skeletal muscle, i.e. the same tissues where LR8 mRNAs predominate in mammals; in addition, in situ hybridization demonstrates that a significant amount of LR8+ is produced in the hen's ovarian follicular granulosa cells. We found no apparent functional difference between the two receptor forms; however, cell type-specific targeting of the multiple ligands of these receptors possibly relates to their respective expression on the cell surface.

Receptors belonging to the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) 1The abbreviations used are: LDLRlow density lipoprotein receptor, VLDL, very low density lipoproteinLR8LDLR relative with eight binding repeatsRT-PCRreverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactionRAPreceptor-associated proteinapoapolipoproteinBSAbovine serum albuminbpbase pair(s)PBSphosphate-buffered salinekbkilobase(s). supergene family play key roles in both systemic transport processes and oocyte growth in oviparous species (Schneider and Nimpf, 1993; Schneider, 1995). One of the recently characterized receptors in this group is a chicken protein whose established major functions are the transport of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), vitellogenin, α2-macroglobulin, and lactoferrin into rapidly growing oocytes (Bujo et al., 1994, Jacobsen et al., 1995; Hiesberger et al., 1995). This chicken receptor, as well as its mammalian homologues (the so-called VLDL receptors), possesses in its ligand binding domain eight tandemly arranged complement-type repeats, each consisting of approximately 40 residues, that display a triple-disulfide bond-stabilized negatively charged surface. Receptors with eight ligand-binding repeats have been shown to interact with apolipoprotein (apo)B (George et al., 1987; Nimpf et al., 1988), apoE-rich VLDL and so-called β-migrating VLDL (Hayashi et al., 1989; Takahashi et al., 1992; Sakai et al., 1994), and the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP) (Battey et al., 1994; Wiborg Simonsen et al., 1994; Hiesberger et al., 1995). Because this broad ligand specificity does not allow for unambiguous nomenclature based on ligand definition, we here designate them LDLR relatives with eight repeats, LR8 in short, to distinguish them from the classical LDLRs (LR7), which harbor a cluster of seven such repeats. low density lipoprotein receptor, VLDL, very low density lipoprotein LDLR relative with eight binding repeats reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction receptor-associated protein apolipoprotein bovine serum albumin base pair(s) phosphate-buffered saline kilobase(s). Analysis of the mutant “restricted ovulator” hen, characterized by lack of oocyte growth that results in severe hyperlipidemia and sterility (Ho et al., 1974; Jones et al., 1975), revealed that its oocytes neither express normal LR8 nor bind VLDL or vitellogenin (Nimpf et al., 1989; Stifani et al., 1990a). These results indicate that LR8 is essential for yolk lipoprotein deposition into oocytes, a key requirement for reproduction. In this context, the expression of LR8 in mammals is of interest. In contrast to the major site of expression in oviparous species, the ovary, mammalian LR8s are found in tissues with active metabolism of fatty acids, such as skeletal muscle, heart, adipose tissue, and brain (Takahashi et al., 1992; Gåfvels et al., 1993, 1994; Oka et al., 1994b; Webb et al., 1994; Jokinen et al., 1994). The chicken oocyte, on the other hand, avidly takes up yolk proteins including VLDL, not for immediate catabolism but rather for storage and later use as energy supply for the developing embryo. Previously, we have identified by Northern blotting transcripts of a size similar to that of the oocyte LR8 in tissues of the chicken other than the ovary (Bujo et al., 1994). In particular, low levels of cross-reactive mRNA species were found in heart and skeletal muscle, i.e. the major sites of expression of mammalian LR8s (Takahashi et al., 1992; Gåfvels et al., 1993, 1994; Oka et al., 1994b; Webb et al., 1994; Jokinen et al., 1994). Mammalian LR8 transcripts exist in splice variant forms: the major form is a mRNA that contains an exon coding for the so-called clustered O-linked sugar domain, but mRNAs coding for LR8 lacking that domain have also been identified (Sakai et al., 1994; Webb et al., 1994; Jokinen et al., 1994). The sites of expression of the different forms in mammals have not been studied in detail. Since lack of the O-linked sugar domain is one of the characteristics of the well characterized chicken oocyte LR8, we considered the possibility that other somatic tissues of the chicken may produce low levels of a differently spliced LR8 transcript. Recently, in the course of studies on the mutation in LR8 causing the restricted ovulator phenotype, 2H. Bujo, T. Yamamoto, K. Hayashi, M. Hermann, J. Nimpf, and W. J. Schneider, unpublished observations. we have identified such a transcript because of its enhanced expression in mutant ovaries. Here, we demonstrate that chickens indeed produce these two differently spliced LR8 mRNAs, differing by 90 nucleotides, and the corresponding proteins in cell type-specific fashion. Interestingly, we could not detect a functional difference between the two receptor forms in vitro. However, since only rapidly growing oocytes express on their surface high levels of LR8 lacking the O-linked sugar domain, cell type-specific receptor production may be important for ligand targeting in vivo. Total RNA was extracted from adult (>6 months old) female chicken tissues, and poly(A+)-RNA was isolated as described previously (Bujo et al., 1994). Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized from poly(A)+-RNA using SuperScriptTM reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and random primers. Four oligonucleotides (P1, −2, −3, and −4) were synthesized for use as PCR primers: P1, 5′-CGACGGGATATCAGGAAGATTGGCC-3′; P2, 5′-AGGAAGAACAGCCCAAGCTCCTGCT-3′; P3, 5′-ACCCTAGTAAACAACCTCAATGATG-3′; and P4, 5′-TGGAGGAAGTCTTTCAGCCACAAGC-3′. The nucleotide sequences of the primers were corresponding to nucleotide numbers 1396-1420 (sense), 2358-2382 (antisense), 2098-2122 (sense), and 2656-2680 (antisense) of chicken LR8- (see Fig. 1A). One-fourth of the synthesized cDNA was used for subsequent PCR amplifications. These were performed with the three pairs of primers, P1/P2, P3/P4, or P3/P2, respectively, using the GeneAmp PCR kit (Perkin-Elmer) on a Perkin-Elmer Thermal Cycler 480. PCR parameters were 94°C for 1 min, 60°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 2 min for 30 cycles. The amplified products were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide. The resulting amplified fragments were subcloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega), and several clones from each fragment were isolated and sequenced using Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Poly(A+)-RNA prepared from various chicken tissues was denatured using glyoxal dimethyl sulfoxide, separated by electrophoresis on agarose gels, and blotted onto Hybond C Extra membranes (Amersham) using standard methods (Sambrook et al., 1989). Two independent cDNA probes for hybridization were prepared: 1) a mixture of two cDNA fragments covering the whole ligand binding domain and part of the epidermal growth factor precursor homology domain of chicken LR8 as previously described (Bujo et al., 1994) (see Fig. 1A) and 2) a 90-bp fragment corresponding to the entire sequence of the O-linked sugar domain found in the alternate form of chicken LR8 described here (see Fig. 1C). To prepare the 90-bp fragment as a probe, two oligonucleotides were synthesized: OSKF, 5′-TTTCAGGTACTGGAACAACTGTGGCTTACACTGAGGCTAAAGATACCAGC-3′, and OSKR, 5′-CTCCAGGAACTAGTCCAACAGTTGGAGATTTTTCAGTTGTGCTGGTATCT-3′. These sequences are corresponding to 50 bp of the 5′-side (sense) and the 3′-side (antisense) of the 90-bp fragment, respectively. The two oligonucleotides were annealed, and the resulting DNA fragment was labeled with 32P using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase (Sambrook et al., 1989). Northern blot analysis was performed as previously described (Bujo et al., 1994). Membranes were exposed to Fuji RX film with intensifying screens. Membrane fractions of the indicated tissues from adult chickens were prepared as previously described (Bujo et al., 1994). Samples were applied without heating or adding dithiothreitol (non-reducing conditions) to 4.5-18% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels according to Laemmli(1970). Electrophoresis, transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunodetection were performed as previously described (Bujo et al., 1994). The rabbit IgG used for immunological analysis was prepared against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the last 14 amino acids of the deduced amino acid sequence of chicken LR8 (Bujo et al., 1994). Immunoblots were exposed to HyperfilmTM-ECL (Amersham) for 10 s. In preparation for ligand blots, nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubating the membrane overnight at +4°C in buffer A (90 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mM CaCl2) containing 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Incubations with ligand were for 2 h at 23°C with 125I-labeled RAP (Hiesberger et al., 1995) (250 cpm/ng; 1 × 106 cpm/ml) in buffer A containing 5% BSA. The membrane was then washed extensively with buffer A containing 1% BSA, dried, and subjected to autoradiography using ReflectionTM film (DuPont NEN) with intensifying screens at −80°C for the times indicated. Follicles from the ovaries of adult hens were dissected in ice-cold PBS, embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT compound (Miles) and immediately frozen with 2-methylbutane precooled in liquid nitrogen. Cryostat sections of 10-μm thickness were prepared, freeze-thawed onto glass slides pretreated with 2% 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, and stored at −70°C. For in situ hybridization, the sections were dried, washed twice with PBS for 5 min each, and treated with 1 μg/ml proteinase K for 5 min at 37°C. The slides were washed twice with PBS for 3 min, treated with 50 mM triethanolamine and 0.2% acetic anhydride in PBS for 2 min at 23°C, and then washed twice for 2 min in 2 × SSC (Sambrook et al., 1989). Prehybridization was then carried out for 5 h at room temperature in a solution containing 5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, 2% Denhardt's solution, 250 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 250 μg/ml tRNA, and 50% formamide. Digoxigenin-labeled antisense or sense RNA probes against the O-linked sugar region were prepared as follows. First, cDNA was prepared from heart mRNA by RT-PCR using two primers, 5′-TTTCAGGTACTGGAACAA-3′ and 5′-CTCCAGGAACTAGTCCAA-3′, annealing to the ends of the 90 nucleotides coding for the O-linked sugar domain. The amplified 90-nucleotide fragment was then separated on a 1.5% agarose gel, purified using the QIAEX DNA gel extraction kit (QIAGEN), and subcloned into the pGEM-T vector. The purified plasmids were then linearized for run-off RNA polymerase transcription in both directions with the DIG RNA labeling kit (SP6/T7, Boehringer Mannheim, no. 1175 025). Hybridization was performed overnight at 45°C with prehybridization solution containing 10% dextran sulfate and 300 ng/ml of the sense or antisense RNAs, and the slides were washed 3 × 10 min with 0.2 × SSC and 2 × 10 min with 0.1 × SSC at 50°C. The following operations were performed at 23°C. The slides were prepared for immundetection by incubation in 150 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (buffer B), containing 3% normal goat serum and 1% BSA for 30 min, then exposed to anti-DIG-alkaline phosphatase Fab fragments (1:1000 dilution) in the same buffer for 2 h, and extensively washed first with buffer B and then with 100 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM MgCl2, pH 9.5. The alkaline phosphatase-tagged antibody was then detected by incubating the slides overnight with a precipitating purple alkaline phosphatase substrate (Boehringer Mannheim, no. 1442 074). The reaction was stopped by incubating the slides in 10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, and mounting them in Aquamount (BDH, Poole). Photographs were taken with a Zeiss Axiovert 10 light microscope. To test in chicken for the expression of splice variants of LR8 possibly including the O-linked sugar domain, RT-PCR was performed with two pairs of oligonucleotide primers. These (P1/P2, and P3/P4 in Fig. 1A) encompassed the region corresponding to the alternative splice site in human LR8 (Sakai et al., 1994; Webb et al., 1994). The products amplified with the primer pair P3/P4 from ovarian cDNA showed, in addition to the expected 583-bp band, a larger and much less abundant band (Fig. 1B, filled and openarrows, respectively). Sequence analysis of the amplified fragments revealed that the unexpected larger product contained an insert of 90 nucleotides2 between positions 2311 and 2312 of the previously characterized LR8- cDNA, corresponding to a site between the epidermal growth factor precursor homology and transmembrane domains of LR8 (amino acid residues 726/727) (Bujo et al., 1994). As shown in Fig. 1C, the deduced amino acid sequence of the 90-bp insert revealed that 11 of the encoded 30 amino acids were serine and threonine residues, typical of the O-linked sugar domains (Schneider, 1989) in LR8+ proteins of rat, mouse, rabbit, and man. This indicates that LR8 mRNA coding for an O-linked sugar domain is not only expressed in mammals (Takahashi et al., 1992; Gåfvels et al., 1993, 1994; Sakai et al., 1994; Oka et al., 1994a, 1994b; Webb et al., 1994; Jokinen et al., 1994) but also in the chicken. Alignment with the known O-linked sugar domains of mammalian LR8s showed extensive identity with rabbit (70%) (Takahashi et al., 1992), human (67% according to Gåfvels et al.(1993), Sakai et al.(1994), and Webb et al.(1994); 63% according to Oka et al. (1994a)), mouse (57% according to Gåfvels et al.(1994); 53% according to Oka et al. (1994b)), and rat (53%) (Jokinen et al., 1994), respectively. In the following, LR8 lacking the O-linked sugar domain is designated LR8-, and the longer form is designated LR8+. We have already shown that chicken LR8- is the predominant, if not the only, form of the receptor present in oocytes (Nimpf et al., 1989; Barber et al., 1991; Bujo et al., 1994). However, Northern blot analysis revealed that muscle and heart, and possibly the ovary, express very low levels (0.5-1% of LR8- in the ovary) of a cross-reactive slightly larger mRNA (Bujo et al., 1994). In this context, in rabbit, mouse, and rat, LR8 mRNAs are abundant in heart, muscle, adipose tissue, and brain (Takahashi et al., 1992; Gåfvels et al., 1994; Oka et al., 1994b; Jokinen et al., 1994), and human receptor transcripts (Gåfvels et al., 1993; Webb et al., 1994) and rat protein (Jokinen et al., 1994) were reported to be expressed at high levels in ovary, heart, and muscle. However, it has not been determined which of the variant forms contribute to expression in the individual tissues. Our previous studies at the protein level (George et al., 1987; Hayashi et al., 1989; Barber et al., 1991; Bujo et al., 1994), which suggested exclusive expression of chicken LR8 in growing oocytes and did not demonstrate receptor variants, prompted us to reconcile these findings, particularly with those in mammals. At the same time, we wanted to determine the exact cellular distribution of LR8 splice variants. Thus, we performed RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis of transcripts in different chicken tissues. PCR with the primer pair P3/P2 (cf. Fig. 1A) showed that the relative levels of expression in ovary, muscle, and heart of the variants described in Fig. 1were significantly different (Fig. 2). The product corresponding to the amplified region in LR8+ (openarrow, of the expected size (375 bp)) predominates in muscle and heart (lanes2 and 3) in distinct contrast to the ovary, where LR8- (closedarrow, product of the expected size (285 bp)) is by far the major form. In fact, the ratios of intensities of the two amplified fragments (LR8-/LR8+) were similar in muscle and heart but opposite to that in ovary. These results indicate that the splice variants are expressed at vastly different levels in these major sites of LR8 expression in the chicken. Only very few, if any, RT-PCR amplifiable transcripts were found in brain, kidney, and liver (data not shown; see below). To obtain further evidence for the production of differently spliced transcripts, we next directly identified LR8- and LR8+ mRNAs in chicken tissues by Northern blot analysis. Previously, chicken LR8 transcripts in ovary, heart, and muscle have been shown, with probes corresponding to regions outside the O-linked domain, to have a size of ~3.5 kb (Bujo et al., 1994). However, the current results suggest that these ~3.5-kb signals might actually represent both splice variant forms of chicken LR8. Therefore, we analyzed the original Northern blot with the 90-bp probe specifying exactly the O-linked sugar domain in chicken LR8+. With this probe, an expression pattern very different from that obtained with the probe corresponding to the common domains (Bujo et al., 1994) was obtained (Fig. 3). Under these conditions, the ~3.5-kb signal, representing exclusively LR8+ transcripts, was detected only in muscle and heart but not in the ovary (upon prolonged exposure, there was a faint signal in ovary). These results reveal that there exist two forms of LR8 mRNA in the chicken, characterized by possessing or lacking a region coding for an O-linked sugar domain, and that their relative levels of expression vary greatly among different tissues and/or cells. Next, we wanted to identify the protein products of the two LR8 transcripts. We have already shown that the cloned oocyte LR8 cDNA specifies a 95-kDa protein, characterized its ligand binding functions, and established its localization in oocytes (George et al., 1987; Nimpf et al., 1989; Steyrer et al., 1990; Barber et al., 1991; Shen et al., 1993; Bujo et al., 1994; Jacobsen et al., 1995; Hiesberger et al., 1995). Here, based on the results of RT-PCR and Northern blotting, we used an antibody directed against the C-terminal 14 residues of the receptor, which are common to LR8- and LR8+, to analyze the immunoreactive proteins in hearts of roosters and laying hens, and in ovarian follicles (Fig. 4). In the follicles, a very strong 95-kDa band was visualized in only 0.2 μg of total protein (lane1, filledarrow). In both heart samples (lanes2 and 3), a very weak band, visible only upon analysis of at least 100-fold more protein than of follicle extract, comigrated with the major follicle protein, and a stronger band migrated slower (openarrow, approximate Mr, 105,000). Taken together with the above results at the transcriptional level, these data lead us to conclude that the two immunoreactive proteins represent the splice variant forms of chicken LR8. To gain insight into possible functional differences between the two receptor forms, we expressed them in heterologous somatic cell systems (for the expression of LR8-, cf. Bujo et al. (1994) and Jacobsen et al.(1995)) and attempted to study their properties in cell surface binding studies. However, we consistently observed vastly different degrees of surface expression of the two forms, rendering such an approach inappropriate. Furthermore, the very low expression of LR8+ in tissues (cf. Fig. 4) precluded analysis by binding studies with physiological ligands. However, we already know that the best characterized non-lipoprotein ligand of the LR family, i.e. RAP, binds to LR8- with higher affinity than lipoproteins (Hiesberger et al., 1995). Thus, having identified the heart as a site of co-expression of LR8- and LR8+, we used 125I-RAP in ligand blots (Fig. 5) on extracts from this tissue; follicle extract served as positive control for the binding of RAP to LR8-. Clearly, LR8+ binds RAP as well; importantly, the ratio of intensities of the bands visualized via binding of 125I-RAP (Fig. 5) and 125I-VLDL (not shown) is equal to that detected by Western blotting (Fig. 4) or at the transcript level (Figure 2:, Figure 3:). The major site of expression of chicken LR8- is the growing oocyte (George et al., 1987; Hayashi et al., 1989; Barber et al., 1991; Shen et al., 1993; Bujo et al., 1994). Interestingly, previous in situ hybridization analysis of ovarian sections showed that receptor mRNA is concentrated in a narrow zone underlying the plasma membrane of vitellogenic oocytes (Bujo et al., 1994). The ovarian follicle preparations analyzed routinely consist of the giant oocyte as well as somatic cells, in particular granulosa cells and theca cells that surround the oocyte. To determine whether the small amount of LR8+ transcript detected in follicles (Figure 2:, Figure 3:) was derived from any or all of the somatic cells, we performed the following experiments (Figure 6:, Figure 7:). For analysis of cell-specific mRNAs, the follicle was mechanically dissected (Gilbert et al., 1977) to isolate the granulosa cell monolayer (lanes1) and the thecal cells (lanes2). We also analyzed mRNA isolated from undissected follicles containing oocytes at different growth stages (lanes3 and 4). The mRNAs were hybridized with the probes reacting with both LR8 transcripts or with the O-linked sugar domain-specific probe, respectively. The results of Fig. 6demonstrate that granulosa cells, as well as follicles (both 0.3 and 2 cm in diameter), contain detectable levels of LR8 transcripts; the oocyte-containing follicles clearly express high levels of LR8-, and the somatic cells express LR8+.Figure 7:Localization in a chicken follicle of the LR8+ mRNA. Cryostat sections of a chicken follicle (diameter, 6 mm) were subjected to in situ hybridization with an antisense (A) and a sense (B) digoxigenin-labeled RNA probe corresponding to the O-linked sugar domain of LR8+. The hybridized probe was visualized using alkaline phosphatase-coupled goat anti-digoxigenin IgG as described under “Materials and Methods.” The horizontal cell layer, distinctively stained in the middle part of panelA, represents the granulosa cells (g), which separate the theca cell layer (t) from the oocyteproper (o). Bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since granulosa cells are present in the follicle preparations (see above), these results suggested that the minute amounts of LR8+ transcript seen in lanes3 and 4, rightpanel (better visualized by prolonged exposure), are derived from these somatic cells. Direct evidence for exclusive expression of LR8+ in granulosa cells was obtained by in situ hybridization analysis of a vitellogenic follicle (Fig. 7). To this end, we used a 90-nucleotide probe corresponding exactly to the O-linked sugar domain in LR8+; the oocyte showed no reactivity with this probe. These findings are in accordance with our previous conclusion (George et al., 1987; Hayashi et al., 1989; Barber et al., 1991; Shen et al., 1993; Bujo et al., 1994) that within the follicle, it is the female germ cell that expresses LR8-. LDL receptor family members containing a single cluster of eight complement-type repeats co-exist with other relatives in the same organism (Takahashi et al., 1992; Gåfvels et al., 1993, 1994; Sakai et al., 1994; Oka et al., 1994a, 1994b; Webb et al., 1994; Bujo et al., 1994; Jokinen et al., 1994). Of particular interest is the emerging notion that such co-expression cannot be required because of exclusive ligand recognition by these receptors (Brown and Goldstein, 1986; Strickland et al., 1990, 1991; Beisiegel et al., 1991; Herz et al., 1991; Stifani et al., 1990b; Bu et al., 1992; Chappell et al., 1992; Huettinger et al., 1992; Orth et al., 1992; Willnow et al., 1992; Kounnas et al., 1992, 1993; Nykjaer et al., 1992, 1993; Battey et al., 1994; Fischer et al., 1993; Hofer et al., 1994; Wiborg Simonsen et al., 1994; Schneider, 1995). In fact, several ligands, such as apoE, β-migrating VLDL, and RAP are ligands for all, and others, such as LDL and chylomicron remnants, for more than one of the known members of the family. The family thus far includes the classical LDLR, the so-called VLDL receptor, and the ambiguously named LDLR-related protein/α2-macroglobulin receptor(s) (LRP/α2MR) as well as glycoprotein 330/megalin (Saito et al., 1994). We feel that the extensively overlapping and currently poorly understood ligand recognition spectra of these receptors preclude a useful nomenclature based on ligand designation; rather, we suggest to use the distinct structural features of these molecules (in particular the number of complement-type repeats) for their identification. Thus, here we designate these LDLR relatives (LRs) as LR7 and LR8 and propose the designations LR31 to LR36 for the large members of the family. Mammalian LR8s are most abundantly expressed in heart, skeletal muscle, brain, and adipose tissue, but not in liver, one of the the major sites of expression of LR7 and LR31 (Takahashi et al., 1992; Gåfvels et al., 1993, 1994; Oka et al., 1994b; Webb et al., 1994; Jokinen et al., 1994). Recently, it has been reported that the human ovary also expresses LR8 (Webb et al., 1994); this is of potential significance in the light of our finding that in the chicken, LR8 expression is by far the highest in oocytes (George et al.(1987); Hayashi et al.(1989); Barber et al.(1991); Shen et al.(1993); Bujo et al.(1994) and present data). We have now discovered that those tissues which express LR8 in mammals also express this receptor in chicken, albeit at very low levels compared to the oocytes. In the chicken, the role of LR8 as an important mediator of oocyte growth via yolk deposition has been established both by biochemical and genetic evidence (George et al., 1987; Nimpf et al., 1989; Barber et al., 1991; Stifani et al., 1990b; Shen et al., 1993). However, in mammals neither the function nor the exact site of expression of LR8 in the ovary is known. One difference in the structures of the major LR8s in mammals and the chicken oocyte LR8, i.e. the presence and absence of the O-linked sugar domain, respectively, prompted us to investigate in detail the expression of LR8 splice variants in the egg-laying animal. The results strongly suggest that somatic cells and tissues, in particular granulosa cells, heart, and skeletal muscle express predominantly LR8+, while the oocyte is by far the major site of LR8- expression. In the context of findings in the rat (Jokinen et al., 1994), which are compatible with a role of LR8 other than in lipoprotein metabolism, we interpret the results in the laying hen as follows. Oocytic LR8- is a multifunctional receptor, which transports lipoproteins and other components (Mac Lachlan et al., 1994; Jacobsen et al., 1995) required for embryonic growth; with the exception of unique yolk precursors, this may hold true for other tissues, including the mammalian ovary. However, a definitive answer to the physiological role of LR8- in mammals cannot be provided at present. LR8+, on the other hand, is likely to perform similar functions in mammals and oviparous species, as they express this receptor in the same tissues. Again, a physiological role of LR8+, not directly related to the transport of lipoproteins, has been suggested (Jokinen et al., 1994). It is noteworthy that for rat and mouse LR8+, possible alternative splicing outside the region considered here has been discovered during cloning studies (Gåfvels et al., 1994; Jokinen et al., 1994). Northern blot analysis in rabbit, rat, mouse, and human tissues revealed, in addition to the transcripts corresponding to LR8-/LR8+, transcripts of 9.5 kb in rabbit (Takahashi et al., 1992), 9.1 kb in rat (Jokinen et al., 1994), 4.5 and 7.9 kb (Oka et al., 1994b) or 8 kb (Gåfvels et al., 1994) in mouse, and 6.0 kb (Gåfvels et al., 1993) or 5.2 kb (Webb et al., 1994) in human. The exact nature of these transcripts has not been delineated; in rats, all transcripts are coordinately regulated in response to changes in the thyroid status (Jokinen et al., 1994). We have not detected any other but the ~3.5-kb LR8 transcripts in the chicken. In the light of our limited knowledge of the true physiological ligand(s) of LR8s, we can only speculate about the functional role of their O-linked sugar domain. In this context, preliminary experiments indicate that LR8- expressed in COS-7 or LR7-negative Chinese hamster ovary cells leads to detectable but poor surface activity (Bujo et al., 1994), while LR8+ is much more efficiently presented at the cell surface (data not shown). 3T. Yamamoto, personal communication. Thus, due to the very low levels of LR8+ protein in tissues, and as a result of these vastly different levels of surface expression of LR8+ versus LR8- in transfected cells, we could only analyze binding of the ligand with the highest affinity for the receptors (Fig. 5). Based on current results, we consider it unlikely, but nevertheless possible, that the ligand specificities of the two variant receptors differ sufficiently to direct different ligands to oocytes and somatic cells, respectively. Rather, it appears that regulation of surface expression of the variants in different cells or tissues holds the key to ligand targeting (Schneider, 1995). In strong support of this notion, deletion of the O-linked sugar domain in LR7, which is associated with very poor surface expression, brings about the clinical symptoms of familial hypercholesterolemia (Kajinami et al., 1988; Koivisto et al., 1992, 1993) despite unaltered ligand recognition by the mutant protein in vitro (Davis et al., 1986). We postulate that the chicken's female germ cell has specific means to express high levels of LR8- on the cell surface (George et al., 1987; Barber et al., 1991), and that this might be a regulatory mechanism for initiating oocyte growth. Namely, in situ hybridization studies (Bujo et al., 1994) and electron microscopical immunocytochemistry (Shen et al., 1993) have shown that LR8- mRNA and protein are present throughout the cytoplasm of previtellogenic oocytes. Upon onset of oocyte growth, mRNA becomes localized to the periphery, and the receptor is translocated to the plasma membrane (Shen et al., 1993), where it initiates and maintains oocyte growth through yolk precursor uptake. This translocation event could be a control site for tight regulation of oocyte growth and may require oocyte-specific mechanism(s) and protein factor(s). The absence of such mechanism or its activation in COS-7 and Chinese hamster ovary cells would explain the poor surface expression of LR8- in these cells. We also do not know whether LR8- in muscle and heart (Fig. 4) do reach the cell surface. LR8+ of somatic granulosa cells, which surround the oocytes during all phases from quiescence to rapid growth, may provide these cells with important substrates for their own sustenance and/or production of oocyte-directed regulatory signals. Current efforts are directed toward identification of these signals to possibly delineate their precursors, among them physiological ligands of LR8+. These considerations imply that ovarian LR8- and LR8+ cooperate to regulate and support normal oocyte growth and maturation. Detailed understanding of this synergism in the follicle may identify principles and functions of LR8s that are equally applicable to mammalian physiology. We appreciate the expert technical assistance by Martin Blaschek, Romana Kukina, and Michelle Mahon."

A 79-nucleotide fragment of the CD18 promoter is sufficient to direct myeloid transcription. The CD18 promoter is bound by the B lymphocyte- and myeloid-restricted ets factor, PU.1, and disruption of the PU.1-binding sites significantly reduces promoter activity. However, PU.1 alone cannot fully account for the leukocyte-specific and myeloid-inducible transcription of CD18. We identified a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein complex of extremely low electrophoretic mobility that also binds to this region of the CD18 promoter. This binding complex is a heterotetramer composed of GABPα, an ets factor, and GABPβ, a subunit with homology to Drosophila Notch. GABPα competes with the lineage restricted factor, PU.1, for the same critical CD18 ets sites. The CD18 promoter is activated in myeloid cells by transfection with both GABPα and GABPβ together, but not by either factor alone. Transfection of non-hematopoietic cells with the two GABP subunits together with PU.1 is sufficient to activate CD18 transcription in otherwise non-permissive cells. Thus, GABP and PU.1 compete for the same binding sites but cooperate to activate CD18 transcription.

Cellular differentiation is linked to tightly regulated gene expression, and most developmentally regulated genes are controlled at the transcriptional level(1Maniatis T. Goodbourn S. Fischer J.A. Science. 1987; 236: 1237-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). In some tissues, e.g. erythroid cells(2Weiss M.J. Keller G. Orkin S.H. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1184-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), cellular differentiation and gene expression are governed by lineage restricted transcription factors. However, many lineage-specific or developmentally controlled genes are regulated by transcription factors that are expressed in a broader range of cell types. In such cases, specific combinations of these more widely expressed factors, or their lineage restricted modification, may contribute to tissue-specific gene expression. CD18 (β2 leukocyte integrin) is a cell surface molecule that plays a crucial role in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. It is expressed exclusively by lymphocytes and myeloid cells (monocytes and granulocytes). During myeloid differentiation, CD18 expression increases due to increased transcription(3Rosmarin A.G.

We have shown that this region of the promoter is bound by PU.1, an ets-related transcription factor that is expressed by B lymphocytes and myeloid cells. Mutagenesis of these PU.1-binding sites in the CD18 promoter decreases promoter activity and commensurately decreases PU.1 binding (8Rosmarin A.G. Caprio D. Levy R. Simkevich C. Proc. Natl. Acad.

CD18 and PU.1 are co-expressed in some cell types, e.g. myeloid cells and B lymphocytes. However, other transcription factors must contribute to the regulated transcription of CD18. T lymphocytes express CD18 in the absence of PU.1 expression(9Klemsz M.J. McKercher S.R. Celada A. Van Beveren C. Maki R.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 113-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 10Galson D.L. Hensold J.O. Bishop T.R. Schalling M. D'Andrea A.D. Jones C. Auron P.E. Housman D.E. Mol. Cell.

Blood. 1993; 82: 2998-3004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and transfection of PU.1 is not sufficient to activate the CD18 promoter in non-hematopoietic cells. CD18 expression increases 4-fold during myeloid differentiation while PU.1 binding activity is not appreciably altered(8Rosmarin A.G. Caprio D. Levy R. Simkevich C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 12Chen H. Zhang P. Voso M.T. Hohaus S. Gonzalez D.A. Glass C.K. Zhang D-E. Tenen D.G. Blood. 1995; 85: 2918-2928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, PU.1 alone does not fully account for the leukocyte-specific and myeloid-inducible expression of CD18. We have found, using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), that multiple nuclear proteins bind to the crucial regulatory region of the CD18 promoter. We characterized these factors in order to better define the regulated transcription of CD18. The sequence GGAA, which is the core binding site for several members of the ets transcription factor family, is present at three locations in the CD18 −79-nt promoter. We identified a protein complex of extremely low electrophoretic mobility that binds to these crucial regulatory elements. This complex contains both GABPα, an ets-related factor, and GABPβ, a subunit with homology to Drosophila Notch(13Thompson C.C Brown T. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 253: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 14Watanabe H. Sawada J.-I. Yano K.-I. Yamaguchi K. Goto M. Handa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1385-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). GABPβ alone does not bind to DNA, but together these proteins form a heterotetrameric complex on the CD18 promoter. GABPα competes with PU.1 for binding to regulatory elements in the CD18 promoter. Transfection into myeloid cells of GABPα and GABPβ together, but of neither factor alone, activates the CD18 promoter. Transfection of both GABP subunits along with PU.1 into non-hematopoietic cells is sufficient to activate a CD18 reporter construct. Thus, two different ets-related transcription factors, the lineage restricted factor PU.1 and the ubiquitously expressed factor GABPα, compete for binding to crucial regulatory sites in the CD18 promoter, yet they functionally cooperate to activate CD18 transcription. U937 (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) catalog no. CRL 1593), Raji (ATCC no. CCL 86), and Jurkat (ATCC no. CRL 8163) cells were passaged twice weekly in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. HeLa cells were passaged twice weekly in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.)/10% fetal calf serum. About 5 × 106 cells were transfected in a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser at 960 microfarads, 300 V with 20 μg of CD18/luc constructs and 1 μg of cytomegalovirus promoter/human growth hormone construct (CMV/hGH). Where indicated, 5 μg of the human homologues of GABPα and GABPβ1-1 (E4TF1-60 and E4TF1-53, respectively (14Watanabe H. Sawada J.-I. Yano K.-I. Yamaguchi K. Goto M. Handa H. Mol. Cell.

Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar)) were co-transfected with 20 μg of CD18/luc constructs and pGEM3zf - was added to bring the total amount of transfected DNA to 30 μg. Fourteen h after transfection, luciferase activity was assayed, and growth hormone was measured from 100 μl of supernatant. Promoter activity is expressed as normalized relative light units, by dividing luciferase activity by growth hormone, to account for transfection efficiency(8Rosmarin A.G. Caprio D. Levy R. Simkevich C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Transfection results represent the mean and S.E. from three separate experiments. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described(8Rosmarin A.G. Caprio D. Levy R. Simkevich C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In vitro translated proteins were prepared with 1 μg of the following supercoiled cDNAs in the TNT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI): PU.1 (a gift of Richard Maki, La Jolla Cancer Research Institute, La Jolla, CA); Elf-1 and Ets-1 (gifts of Jeff Leiden, University of Chicago); Fli-1 (a gift of Michael Klemsz, University of Indiana). GABPα and GABPβ1-1(16LaMarco K. Thompson C.C. Byers B.P. Walton E.M. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 253: 789-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), purified by nickel chelate chromatography, were gifts of Tom Brown (Pfizer, Inc., Groton, CT). GST-PU.1 (a gift of Tony Kouzarides, Wellcome/CRC Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom) and GST-GABPα (as E4TF1-60, the human homologue of GABPα) fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli, isolated with glutathione-Sepharose, and quantitated by staining with known protein standards in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. EMSA probes are schematized in Fig. 2A. The GGAA ets sites in the EMSA probes presented below are underlined (note that the GGAA sequence at −72/−75 is encoded on the bottom strand). Probes that correspond to −85/−37 of the CD18 promoter (AACCCACCACTTCCTCCAAGGAGGAGCTGAGAGGAACAGGAAGTGTCAG and its complement) were annealed and 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (ICN) by Polynucleotide Kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly MA). Probes that correspond to −89/−58 (GTGCAACCCACCACTTCCTCCAAGGAGGAGCT and its complement) and −59/−32 (CTGAGAGGAACAGGAAGTGTCAGGACTTC and its complement), and corresponding mutant versions that contain GG → CC mutations in the underlined ets sites, include SalI and BamHI compatible sites at either end and were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by the Klenow fragment of DNA Polymerase I. Radiolabeled probe (0.1 ng) was incubated for 10 min on ice with 1 μl of unprogrammed reticulocyte lysate, 1 μl of in vitro translated or purified protein, or 10 μg of nuclear extract in a 15-μl reaction containing 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5,50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM β mercaptoethanol, 1% Ficoll and poly(dI•dC) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.; 2.0 μg for nuclear extracts, 0.5 μg for proteins). Where indicated, a 100-fold molar excess of homologous DNA or irrelevant probe that lacks an ets-binding site (corresponding to CD18 −903/−883; GCGAAGCTTGCAGTGAGCTGAGATCACGGATCCGCG, and its complement) were used as unlabeled competitors. Where indicated, up to 10-fold greater amounts of competing GST fusion proteins were added to binding reactions. Products were electrophoresed at 180 V in a 5% acrylamide/bis (19:1) gel in 0.5 × TBE (1 × TBE is 90 mM Tris-base, 90 mM boric acid, 2 mM EDTA) prior to autoradiography. Because binding by GABP proteins is sensitive to the ionic content of the electrophoretic gel(12Chen H. Zhang P. Voso M.T. Hohaus S. Gonzalez D.A. Glass C.K. Zhang D-E. Tenen D.G. Blood. 1995; 85: 2918-2928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), EMSA with purified GABP was performed in 0.25 × TBE, where indicated. For supershift experiments, reactions were preincubated for 10 min on ice with either 1 μl of preimmune rabbit serum or 1 μl of polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against either GABPα or GABPβ (gifts of Tom Brown). A probe corresponding to −148/+28 relative to the dominant start site of CD18 transcription, radiolabeled on the non-coding strand, was prepared by a modification of the polymerase chain reaction, as described(8Rosmarin A.G. Caprio D. Levy R. Simkevich C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). One μl of purified GABPα protein was equilibrated in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 40 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Ficoll, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol for 10 min at room temperature, incubated with 5,000 counts/min of probe for 30 min at room temperature, and digested with 1 μg/ml DNase I (Sigma) at room temperature for precisely 1 min, phenol extracted, and ethanol-precipitated. Identical samples, which lacked added protein, were treated similarly, except they were digested with 0.5 μg/ml DNase I at room temperature for 20 s. Half of the resultant products were electrophoresed in a 6% polyacrylamide, 7 M urea gel alongside the same probe subjected to chemical sequencing and autoradiography performed. A 79-nt fragment of the CD18 promoter is active after transient transfection into U937 myeloid cells. The B lymphocyte and myeloid-restricted ets transcription factor PU.1 binds to this region of the promoter, and mutagenesis of each PU.1 site reduces promoter activity and commensurately decreases PU.1 binding(8Rosmarin A.G. Caprio D. Levy R. Simkevich C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Because PU.1 alone cannot fully account for its lineage restricted expression, we sought to identify other factors that may control CD18 transcription. In order to localize its leukocyte-specific activity, we transfected a variety of cell types with constructs that contain either 918 or 79 nt of the CD18 promoter; cells were co-transfected with CMV/hGH as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Fig. 1indicates that both the 918- and 79-nt CD18 promoter fragments are active in myeloid cells (U937), B lymphocytes (Raji), and T lymphocytes (Jurkat). In Raji cells, the 79-nt construct is significantly less active than the full-length promoter, indicating the presence of an element between −918 and −79 that enhances CD18 activity in B lymphoid cells. Neither CD18 promoter construct is active following transfection into non-hematopoietic HeLa cells (cervical carcinoma). These studies indicate that the 79-nt CD18 minimal promoter encodes the cell type-specific expression of the endogenous gene. We performed EMSA with a radiolabeled, double-stranded probe corresponding to −85/−37 of the CD18 promoter, which contains three potential ets-binding sites (see Fig. 2A; GGAA at −72/−75, −53/−50, and −47/−44). Using nuclear extracts from U937, Raji, HeLa, and Jurkat cells, we found that several different protein species bind to this region of the CD18 promoter. Consistent with its known pattern of expression, PU.1 binding activity was present only in extracts of myeloid cells and B lymphocytes (Fig. 2B, lanes 9 and 10, right arrow)(8Rosmarin A.G. Caprio D. Levy R. Simkevich C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). An as yet unidentified T cell-specific band (lane 12, curved arrow) is observed with the Jurkat nuclear extract. All other binding species are present in all of the nuclear extracts tested (lanes 9-12). ets transcription factors bind to related sequences, typically containing a core of GGAA. Therefore, we sought to determine if other ets factors besides PU.1 bind to the CD18 promoter. We performed EMSA with the −85/−37 probe and in vitro translated PU.1, Ets-1, Fli-1, and Elf-1. In addition to PU.1 (Fig. 2B, lane 3), Elf-1 (lane 6), and Spi-B (not shown) bound avidly to −85/−37. However, neither Elf-1 nor Spi-B formed a complex that co-migrates with binding species from nuclear extracts (lanes 9-12). Neither Ets-1 (lane 4), Fli-1 (lane 5), nor Ets-2 (not shown) bound to the CD18 −85/−37 probe, although each of these in vitro translated transcription factors bound to appropriate positive control probes (data not shown). None of these factors co-migrated with the unidentified binding species from Jurkat nuclear extracts. We performed EMSA with the CD18 −85/−37 probe and GABPα, a ubiquitously expressed member of the ets family. Recombinant GABPα, purified from bacteria, forms two binding complexes with the CD18 promoter (Fig. 2B, lane 7). GABPβ, which exhibits homology to Drosophila Notch and is not related to the ets transcription factors, interacts with GABPα via its ankyrin repeats(13Thompson C.C Brown T. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 253: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 17Sawada J.-I. Goto M. Sawa C. Watanabe H. Handa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1396-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). When purified GABPβ is added to GABPα, three distinct complexes are generated. Each complex co-migrates with a binding species present in the myeloid, lymphoid, and non-hematopoietic nuclear extracts (compare lane 8 to lanes 9-12), suggesting that the ubiquitous CD18 binding species (lanes 9-12) is GABP. The multimeric pattern of binding by GABPα and GABPβ to the CD18 promoter resembles GABP binding to the HSV IE promoter and other genes that contain multiple ets sites. Gel filtration, sedimentation, and cross-linking studies were used to characterize the nature of each of these binding species on the HSV IE promoter(13Thompson C.C Brown T. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 253: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). We used UV cross-linking and mutagenesis of the GABP subunits to confirm the multimeric nature of the binding complexes on the adenovirus E4 promoter(17Sawada J.-I. Goto M. Sawa C. Watanabe H. Handa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1396-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The two complexes formed on the CD18 promoter by GABPα correspond to monomeric and homodimeric forms of the protein (Fig. 3, lane 2, M and D). GABPβ alone does not bind to CD18 (lane 3). However, GABPα and GABPβ together can generate three distinct binding species. These correspond to the monomeric GABPα (lane 4, M), heterodimeric GABPα/GABPβ (D, which co-migrates with homodimeric GABPα2), and heterotetrameric GABPα2/GABPβ2 (T) species demonstrated in previous studies(13Thompson C.C Brown T. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 253: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 17Sawada J.-I. Goto M. Sawa C. Watanabe H. Handa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1396-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We used antibodies to confirm the identity of the nuclear proteins that co-migrate with purified GABPα and GABPβ. Preimmune serum does not appreciably alter binding by myeloid nuclear proteins to CD18 −85/−37 (Fig. 3, lane 8). However, an antibody against GABPα abrogates the monomeric and dimeric species and sharply reduces the intensity of the tetrameric species (lane 6, M, D, and T, respectively). Binding by this antibody results in a supershift of these proteins, as indicated by the open arrow. Note that a binding species of slightly slower electrophoretic mobility than the dimeric species is unaffected by the GABPα antibody. Antibody against GABPβ abrogates the dimeric and tetrameric species and results in a supershift of the binding complexes (lane 7, open arrow). These results demonstrate that myeloid nuclei contain CD18-binding proteins that are immunologically related to GABP. We prepared additional EMSA probes to further localize the GABP-binding sites within the crucial region of the CD18 promoter. Because binding by GABP proteins is dependent on the ionic strength of the electrophoretic gel(13Thompson C.C Brown T. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 253: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), the following experiments with purified proteins were performed in 0.25 × TBE. The region from −89/−58 contains one potential ets-binding site (GGAA at −72/−75, labeled A in Fig. 2A). GABPα alone can form monomeric, but not dimeric binding species on this DNA fragment (Fig. 4A, lane 5, M). GABPα and GABPβ, together, can form the monomeric and dimeric (lane 6, M and D), but not the tetrameric binding species. The probe corresponding to −59/−31 of the CD18 promoter contains two potential ets sites (at −53/−50 and −47/−44, labeled B and C in Fig. 2A). GABPα alone forms predominantly a monomeric species (lane 8, M), with a small amount of homodimer (more apparent in Fig. 4B, lane 8). However, GABPα and GABPβ together generate all three species that form on the larger −85/−37 probe (compare lane 9 to lane 3). Thus, each of the three potential ets sites supports GABPα binding and can contribute to formation of tetrameric GABP binding on the CD18 promoter. We prepared EMSA probes with mutations in each of the ets-binding sites to determine if GABP binding is dependent on the integrity of the conserved ets sites. Mutagenesis of the ets site in the −89/−58 probe (GGAA → CCAA at −73/−72 in site A) abrogates all GABP binding (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 5 and 6 to lanes 2 and 3). Similarly, mutagenesis of the two ets sites in the −59/−31 probe (GGAA → CCAA at −53/−52 in site B and −47/−46 in site C) abrogates GABP binding (compare lanes 11 and 12 to lanes 8 and 9). Thus, GABP binding depends on integrity of the ets sites. We performed DNase I footprinting in order to further define the binding sites of GABP. A probe which corresponds to −148/+28 relative to the start site of CD18 transcription was prepared by polymerase chain reaction and labeled on the antisense strand. Purified GABPα protects three regions of the CD18 promoter from DNase I digestion (Fig. 5, vertical bars; compare lanes N (naked DNA) to lane α (GABPα)). The protected regions encompass the three ets-binding sites, labeled A-C in Fig. 2A, and they correspond to the footprints that we have previously demonstrated with U937 nuclear extract. The asterisk indicates a DNase I-hypersensitive site that is also seen with myeloid nuclear extracts(8Rosmarin A.G. Caprio D. Levy R. Simkevich C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The addition of GABPβ to GABPα has little effect on the footprints (data not shown). We sought to determine if GABPα and PU.1 compete for binding to the same ets sites in the CD18 promoter. These factors were expressed in E. coli as fusion proteins with GST and isolated with glutathione-Sepharose beads. No binding to the CD18 −85/−37 probe is seen with GST alone (not shown). EMSA with GST-GABPα generates two distinct bands, corresponding to monomeric and homodimeric binding species (Fig. 6A, lane 2, M and D, respectively). Their binding specificity is indicated by abrogation with 100-fold excess of unlabeled homologous probe (lane 3), but not by 100-fold excess of nonspecific competitor oligonucleotide (lane 4). Addition of increasing amounts of GST-PU.1 to a fixed amount of GABPα in the binding reaction recruits bound probe from GABPα to PU.1 (lanes 5-8). As PU.1 increases, there is preferential loss of binding to the monomeric form, relative to the dimeric form of GABPα, indicating the higher binding affinity of the dimeric GABPα species. Similarly, EMSA with GST-PU.1 (Fig. 6B, lane 2, labeled PU.1) forms a distinct binding species with the CD18 −85/−37 probe that is abrogated by a 100-fold molar excess of homologous unlabeled probe but not by nonspecific probe (lanes 3 and 4, respectively). A species of high electrophoretic mobility (indicated by the asterisks in Fig. 6, A and B) is caused by binding to the probe by a proteolytic degradation product of PU.1(8Rosmarin A.G. Caprio D. Levy R. Simkevich C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Addition of increasing amounts of GABPα to a fixed amount of PU.1 in the binding reaction recruits probe to the GABPα complexes. We sought to determine if GABPα and GABPβ could activate the CD18 promoter in vivo. We co-transfected CD18(−918)/luc with mammalian expression vectors containing the human homologues of GABPα and GABPβ1-1 (E4TF1-60 and E4TF1-53, respectively). Neither GABPα nor GABPβ, alone, activated the CD18 promoter construct following transfection into U937 myeloid cells (Fig. 7A). However, co-transfection of both GABPα and GABPβ with the CD18 promoter increased luciferase activity more than 10-fold. Interestingly, transfection into U937 cells of a PU.1 expression vector fails to substantially activate the CD18 promoter (not shown). Thus, the GABP complex activates myeloid expression from the CD18 promoter in vivo. The CD18 promoter encodes the lineage-specific activity of the endogenous CD18 gene, for it directs reporter expression in myeloid and lymphoid cells but not in non-hematopoietic cells (Fig. 1). We sought to determine if GABP co-activates the CD18 promoter following transfection into otherwise non-permissive HeLa cells. Transfection into HeLa cells of either GABPα or GABPβ alone had no effect on CD18 promoter activity, and transfection of both GABP subunits had only a modest effect (Fig. 7B). Transfection into HeLa cells of PU.1, which is required for myeloid expression of CD18, fails to activate the CD18 promoter. However, co-transfection of both GABP subunits together with PU.1 increases CD18 promoter activity more than 10-fold. This indicates that although these two ets factors compete for the same CD18 promoter-binding sites, they functionally cooperate to increase CD18 expression in otherwise non-permissive cells. In order to better define the molecular basis of myeloid differentiation, we are studying the factors that regulate transcription of the leukocyte β2 integrin, CD18. A 79-nt fragment of the CD18 promoter is required for transcription in myeloid cells(6Böttinger E.P. Shelley C.S. Farokhzad O.C. Arnaout M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 4: 2604-2615Crossref Google Scholar, 8Rosmarin A.G. Caprio D. Levy R. Simkevich C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and we have previously shown that the ets-related transcription factor PU.1 binds to this region (8Rosmarin A.G. Caprio D. Levy R. Simkevich C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that GABPα, a second ets factor, competes with PU.1 for binding to these sites in the CD18 promoter. GABPα forms multimeric complexes with its Notch-related partner GABPβ, and together these factors activate CD18 transcription in myeloid cells. Furthermore, we show that GABP and PU.1 are sufficient to activate the CD18 promoter in non-hematopoietic cells. Thus, although these ets factors compete for promoter binding, they functionally cooperate to activate CD18 transcription. The region of CD18 that is required for promoter activity contains three potential ets sites. Because ets transcription factors bind to similar core DNA sequences, we sought to determine if other ets factors, besides PU.1, bind to CD18. We detected a widely expressed nuclear factor of extremely low electrophoretic mobility that binds to this region of the CD18 promoter. Böttinger et al.(6Böttinger E.P. Shelley C.S. Farokhzad O.C. Arnaout M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 4: 2604-2615Crossref Google Scholar) suggested that GABP might bind to the CD18 promoter. We now demonstrate that purified GABPα binds to all three CD18 ets regulatory elements. Purified GABPα alone forms monomers and homodimers on these sites and its binding is sensitive to mutation (GGAA → CCAA) of the consensus ets sequence. GABPβ alone does not bind to the CD18 promoter, but in the presence of GABPα it forms a complex that co-migrates with the low mobility nuclear binding complex. We used antibodies to confirm that this myeloid-binding complex contains proteins that are immunologically related to both GABPα and GABPβ. GABP was originally identified as a factor from rat nuclei that binds to critical regulatory elements in HSV IE genes(13Thompson C.C Brown T. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 253: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 16LaMarco K. Thompson C.C. Byers B.P. Walton E.M. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 253: 789-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). GABP is composed of two distinct polypeptides, which together are required for high affinity DNA binding and transcriptional activation. The human equivalents of GABPα and GABPβ were independently cloned as regulators of adenovirus E4 gene transcription (E4TF1-60 and E4TF1-53/47, respectively) (14Watanabe H. Sawada J.-I. Yano K.-I. Yamaguchi K. Goto M. Handa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1385-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and as nuclear respiratory factor 2 (NRF-2α and NRF-2β/γ, respectively) (18Gugneja S. Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 102-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) GABPα is a DNA-binding protein with homology to the ets family of transcription factors. GABPβ is unrelated to the ets family, but it has homology to Drosophila Notch and Caenorhabditis elegans Glp-1 and Lin-1. Four ankyrin repeats in its amino terminus are required for its interaction with GABPα, and a coiled-coil motif in its carboxyl terminus permits GABPβ homotypic dimerization(13Thompson C.C Brown T.

GABP generates a complex of extremely low electrophoretic mobility when it binds to CD18 promoter probes that contain at least two of its three ets-binding sites. Gel filtration, gradient sedimentation, and cross-linking studies were used to conclusively demonstrate the heterotetrameric nature of GABP complexes on a similar arrangement of three ets sites on HSV IE genes(13Thompson C.C Brown T. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 253: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). We used UV cross-linking and mutagenesis of the GABP subunits to confirm the multimeric nature of the binding complexes to the adenovirus E4 transcriptional promoter(17Sawada J.-I. Goto M. Sawa C.

In the present study, we used mutagenesis of CD18 ets sites to demonstrate an identical pattern of binding by GABPα and GABPβ. Other genes with multiple ets-binding sites, including folate-binding protein(20Sadasivan E. Cedeno M.M. Rothenberg S.P. J. Biol.

As with each of these genes, the low mobility CD18 promoter binding complex represents GABPα2/GABPβ2 heterotetramers. The two ets factors that bind to the CD18 promoter, PU.1 and GABPα, are expressed in very different lineage-specific patterns. PU.1 is expressed by B lymphocytes and myeloid cells(9Klemsz M.J.

PU.1 appears to control the transcription of several leukocyte-specific genes including CD11b (24Pahl H.L. Scheibe R.J. Zhang D.-E. Chen H.-M. Galson D.L. Maki R.A. Tenen D.G. J. Biol.

A. 1995; 92: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). PU.1 is required for myeloid colony formation(29Voso M.T. Burn T.C. Wulf G. Lim B. Leone G. Tenen D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7932-7936Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and its targeted disruption by homologous recombination abrogates lymphopoiesis and myelopoiesis(30Scott E.W. Simon M.C. Anastasi J. Singh H. Science. 1994; 265: 1573-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). Thus, PU.1 is essential for normal hematopoiesis and may control transcription of some myeloid genes. In contrast to PU.1, GABPα and GABPβ are widely expressed(16LaMarco K. Thompson C.C. Byers B.P. Walton E.M. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 253: 789-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). We detected binding to CD18 by the heterotetrameric GABP species in all cell types examined. Thus, GABP binding activity is present both in cells that express CD18 (myeloid cells and B and T lymphocytes) and in cells that do not express CD18 (HeLa). Although most genes whose activity is controlled by GABP are widely expressed, GABP also controls genes that are expressed in a lineage-restricted manner. For example, the gene encoding α4 integrin, which is expressed predominantly by leukocytes(31Rosen G.D. Barks J.L. Iademarco M.F. Fisher R.J. Dean D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15652-15660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the F promoter of 6-phosphofructo-2 kinase (32Dupriez V.J. Darville M.I. Antoine I.V. Gegonne A. Ghysdael J. Rousseau G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8224-8228Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) are transcriptionally regulated by GABP. How can the widely expressed GABP transcription complex control the lineage-restricted expression of genes such as CD18 and α4 integrin? There are multiple isoforms of the GABPβ(14Watanabe H. Sawada J.-I. Yano K.-I. Yamaguchi K. Goto M. Handa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1385-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16LaMarco K. Thompson C.C. Byers B.P. Walton E.M. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 253: 789-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 22Virbasius J.V. Virbasius C.A. Scarpulla R.C. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 380-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), the subunit that controls transcriptional activation by GABP(17Sawada J.-I. Goto M. Sawa C. Watanabe H. Handa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1396-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 18Gugneja S. Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 102-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These isoforms, which may be derived from alternative splicing of the mRNA transcript differ primarily in the region of the protein that is responsible for GABPβ homodimerization. Alternate forms of GABPβ1 may affect formation of GABP complexes and their interactions with other components of the transcriptional apparatus. Recently, GABPβ2-1, a distinct but related gene that is encoded on a different chromosome, was described(33de la Brousse F.C. Birkenmeier E.H. King D.S. Rowe L.B. McKnight S.L. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1853-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The two distinct GABPβ genes differ in the region of the protein that is responsible for transcriptional activation. GABPβ1 and GABPβ2 can form heteromeric complexes with one another, thereby adding another level of complexity to the regulation to GABP function(33de la Brousse F.C. Birkenmeier E.H. King D.S. Rowe L.B. McKnight S.L. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1853-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The cell type-specific and differentiation-associated expression of the GABPβ genes and their various isoforms have not been well defined. Thus, subtle lineage-specific alterations in GABPβ expression may control GABP complex formation and transcriptional activation and thereby contribute to the regulated expression of CD18. Cell type-specific transcriptional activation by the ubiquitously expressed GABP may also be influenced by lineage-restricted factors such as PU.1. Other genes besides CD18 are also controlled by more than one ets factor. Immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer function is regulated by binding of different ets factors including PU.1, Ets-1, and Erg-3(34Nelsen B. Tian G. Erman B. Gregoire J. Maki R. Graves B. Sen R. Science. 1993; 261: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 35Rivera R.R. Stuiver M.H. Steenbergen R. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7163-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The α4 integrin promoter may be bound by a second ets factor besides GABPα(31Rosen G.D. Barks J.L. Iademarco M.F. Fisher R.J. Dean D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15652-15660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although we cannot exclude the possibility that GABP and PU.1 physically interact on the CD18 promoter in vivo, we identified no novel binding complexes that are formed by these factors in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Rather, titration of increasing amounts of PU.1 competes for GABPα binding to the CD18 promoter and vice versa. Furthermore, antibodies to GABP do not supershift the EMSA probes that are bound by PU.1 and vice versa(8Rosmarin A.G. Caprio D. Levy R. Simkevich C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus, PU.1 and GABPα appear to compete for the same CD18 promoter sites and their binding appears to be mutually exclusive. Jurkat (T lymphoid) cells express CD18, yet they lack PU.1 expression. These cells possess a unique nuclear binding species which does not co-migrate with other ets factors that are expressed by T lymphocytes (Fig. 2). Additional mutagenesis studies and supershift assays (not shown) suggest that this binding species likely represents an as yet unidentified ets factor. We propose that this T cell factor acts in lieu of PU.1 and contributes to T lymphoid expression of CD18. These findings suggest that at least one other ets factor may functionally cooperate with GABP to effect CD18 transcription. Transfection of both GABPα and GABPβ into myeloid cells activates CD18 reporter activity more than 10-fold; we have found no such activation of CD18 myeloid transcription by PU.1. Furthermore, co-transfection of both GABP and PU.1 activates CD18 transcription in non-hematopoietic cells. This confirms our previous proposal that although PU.1 is necessary for myeloid expression of CD18, it alone is not sufficient to control CD18 transcription. Although these two ets factors compete for the same CD18 promoter-binding sites, they functionally cooperate to activate its transcription. GABP and PU.1 may have different roles in the process of transcriptional activation. For example, because PU.1 directly interacts with TATA-binding protein(36Hagemeier C. Bannister A.J. Cook A. Kouzarides T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1580-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), it may recruit the basal transcriptional apparatus to the TATA-less CD18 promoter, while GABP enhances other aspects of transcriptional activation. Further analysis of these factors should demonstrate the means by which these two ets factors cooperate to control CD18 transcription.

https://openalex.org/W1975972186,"Previous studies with U937 cells, a human monocyte cell line, have shown that the activity of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) is increased by agents that elevate cyclic AMP content. The present experiments were conducted to determine 1) whether an increase in PDE4 steady-state message and/or protein accompanies the up-regulation of PDE4 activity and 2) whether the up-regulation changes the functional responses of U937 cells to activators of adenylyl cyclase. To up-regulate PDE4 activity, U937 cells were treated for 4 h with a combination of 1 μM salbutamol, a β-adrenoceptor agonist, and 30 μM rolipram, a PDE4 inhibitor. Cells were washed extensively to remove drugs and used immediately in various experimental protocols. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions conducted with primers specific for the four PDE4 subtypes suggested that pretreatment with salbutamol and rolipram increased steady-state mRNA levels of PDE4A and PDE4B, but not PDE4C or PDE4D. Immunoblot analyses using two rabbit polyclonal antibodies, one directed against human recombinant PDE4A and PDE4D and a second directed against human recombinant PDE4B, revealed bands of immunoreactivity corresponding to ∼125 kDa (PDE4A) and ∼70 kDa (PDE4B), respectively, that increased in intensity after cells were treated with salbutamol and rolipram. As demonstrated in both time course and concentration-response studies with prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), an agent that activates adenylyl cyclase by a non-β-adrenoceptor-mediated mechanism, cAMP accumulation was substantially decreased in cells in which PDE4 activity had been up-regulated. The difference in PGE2-stimulated cAMP accumulation between control and PDE4 up-regulated cells was greatly reduced in the presence of rolipram, consistent with the notion that an increase in PDE4 activity was responsible for the heterologous desensitization. Functionally, up-regulation of PDE4 markedly decreased the ability of PGE2 to inhibit LTD4-induced Ca2+ mobilization in intact cells. A hypothetical implication of these results is that increasing PDE4 activity in vivo by administering β-adrenoceptor agonists could exacerbate inflammatory processes by decreasing the activity of endogenous anti-inflammatory agents such as PGE2.

INTRODUCTIONCyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) 1The abbreviations used are: PDEphosphodiesteraseLTD4leukotriene D4hrPDEhuman recombinant phosphodiesterasePDE4cAMP-specific PDEPGE2prostaglandin E2RT-PCRreverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactionPBSphosphate-buffered salinebpbase pairs. are a family of isozymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of the 3′-phosphoester bond on adenosine cyclic 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) and guanosine cyclic 3′,5′-monophosphate to form the inactive 5′-monophosphate products. Consequently, PDEs have a major role in regulating cellular cyclic nucleotide content. It is now recognized that PDEs represent a diverse family of isozymes, each with different kinetic and physical characteristics, tissue distribution, and sensitivity to endogenous regulators (Beavo, 1988). At least seven classes of PDE isozymes exist, some of which contain multiple subtypes (Conti et al. 1991; Beavo et al., 1994). All of these isozymes as well as many of the subtypes are encoded by distinct genes (Beavo et al., 1994).The cAMP-specific PDE, designated PDE4 (for nomenclature see Beavo et al., 1994), is the predominant cAMP hydrolyzing isozyme class found in most, if not all, immune and inflammatory cells (Torphy and Undem, 1991; Giembycz and Dent, 1992). This, coupled with the well defined role of cAMP as a second messenger mediating a generalized suppression of immune and inflammatory cell activity (Bourne et al., 1973, 1974; Kammer 1988;), has led to the recognition that PDE4 plays a critical role in regulating the function of these cells (Torphy and Undem, 1991). Consequently, this isozyme has received considerable attention as a target for new antiinflammatory and immunomodulator drugs.The PDE4 isozyme class is comprised of four subtypes, PDE4A through PDE4D (Beavo et al., 1994). The activity of certain subtypes can be increased in situ by either a short term regulatory process involving protein phosphorylation or by a long term regulatory process involving increased gene expression (Conti et al., 1991; Sette et al., 1994a, 1994b). Both of these regulatory mechanisms are cAMP-dependent and can be triggered by a variety of activators of adenylyl cyclase (Bourne et al., 1973; Conti et al., 1991; Torphy et al., 1992). This raises the possibility that PDE4 activity can be regulated in vivo by various hormones, drugs, and growth factors (Conti et al., 1991). Because of the predominance of PDE4 in immune and inflammatory cells, these regulatory pathways may have a substantial influence on the responsiveness of these cells to a variety of hormones, autacoids, and drugs.We previously reported that treatment of undifferentiated U937 cells, a human monocytic cell line, with salbutamol, a β-adrenoceptor agonist, or prostaglandin (PG) E2 produces a 2-4-fold increase in the activity of PDE4, the major PDE in these cells (Torphy et al., 1992). This increase in activity develops after 2-4 h of agonist exposure and is: 1) preceded by an increase in cAMP content and cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity; 2) potentiated by cotreatment with rolipram, a PDE4 inhibitor; 3) mimicked by 8-bromo-cAMP; 4) marked by an increase in Vmax with no change in the cAMP Km; 5) abolished by inhibitors of mRNA or protein synthesis; and 6) reversible within 3 h of agonist removal. In light of these results, the present experiments were conducted to determine whether treatment of U937 cells with β-adrenoceptor agonists increases the steady-state levels of PDE4 protein or transcript and, if so, whether this phenomenon changes the functional responsiveness of these cells to activators of adenylyl cyclase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Drug PretreatmentsU937 cells from the American Type Culture Collection were grown in plastic flasks (80 cm2) in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)-1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. Culture medium was changed every 2-3 days and always 24 h before harvest. Cells were seeded at densities of 0.075-0.15 × 106 cells/ml and harvested at 0.75-1 × 106 cells/ml. The cells were preincubated with vehicle (distilled water for salbutamol, 0.03% dimethyl sulfoxide for rolipram), or 1 μM salbutamol plus 30 μM rolipram for 4 h. Although treatment with salbutamol alone increases PDE4 activity, the magnitude is greater using the combination of an adenylyl cyclase activator and PDE4 inhibitor (Torphy et al., 1992). Consequently, the combination protocol was used in the present experiments to increase the opportunity to detect differences between control and PDE4-up-regulated cells.To prepare human monocytes, heparinized whole blood was centrifuged at 350 × g for 30 min over Ficoll-Hypaque to remove erythrocytes and granulocytes. The mononuclear cell layer was removed, washed twice with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1 mM EGTA, and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2.5 mM HEPES, 20 mML-glutamine, 100 U penicillin/ml, and 100 mg streptomycin/ml (RPMI). The suspension was underlaid with iso-osmotic Percoll adjusted to a density of 1.062 g/cm3 with RPMI and centrifuged at 560 × g for 30 min. Monocytes were harvested from the interface, washed twice with HBS, and resuspended in RPMI. Cells were incubated overnight at a density of 0.5-1 × 106 cells/ml in 175-cm2 flasks in a humidified, 37°C atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2.When PGE2-induced cAMP accumulation was determined, control and “PDE4-induced” cells were centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min and washed two times with cold Krebs-Ringer-Henseleit buffer composed of 118 mM NaCl; 4.6 mM KCl, 24.9 mM NaHCO3, 1 mM KH2PO4, 11.1 mMD-glucose, 1 mM CaCl2, 1.1 mM MgCl2, and 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. Cells were then resuspended at a final concentration of 106 cells/ml in Krebs-Ringer-Henseleit buffer containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (radioimmunoassay grade) and treated for the indicated times with different concentrations of PGE2 in the absence or presence of 30 μM rolipram.Immunoblot AnalysisFollowing their exposure to various pharmacological agents, cells were harvested by centrifugation. Cells were washed twice (10 min, 400 × g) with 20 mM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), counted, and resuspended at 2 × 108 cells/ml in 50 mM Tris homogenization buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 2 mM benzamidine, 2.5 mM dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 100 μM tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 200 μM leupeptin, and 50 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Suspensions were frozen in a methanol/dry ice bath and quickly thawed in a 37°C water bath for three cycles to lyse the cells. The lysed suspensions were centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 revolutions/min in an Eppendorf microfuge to remove nuclei and cellular debris. Supernatants were quick-frozen and stored at −80°C.Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad (modified Bradford) protein assay. Proteins (∼100 μg/lane) were separated via electrophoresis (Bio-Rad) on SDS-8% polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) using a tank electroblotter. Blots were briefly washed in PBS, 0.1% Tween-20 and then blocked overnight in PBS/Tween-20/5% nonfat dry milk. Blocked membranes were washed three times with PBS/Tween-20 before incubation with the primary antibody.Blots were incubated for 1 h with a 1:2000 dilution of polyclonal serum produced in New Zealand White rabbits. One antibody was raised against a galK-hPDE-1 fusion protein containing a major fragment of PDE4A, which included the conserved PDE4 catalytic domain (Livi et al., 1990). Preliminary characterization of this antibody indicated cross-reactivity with PDE4D, but not PDE4B (recombinant PDE4C is not available). A second antibody was raised against a peptide representing the unique carboxyl terminus of PDE4B2 (CDIDIATEDKSPVDT). For blocked antibody experiments, the antibody was diluted 1:100 into a lysate of either the nontransfected PDE-deficient Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain GL62 (control) or the same strain engineered to express a 686-residue fragment of human recombinant PDE4A (hrPDE4A) containing the conserved catalytic domain of PDE4. The mixtures were incubated overnight at 4°C with gentle agitation. The antibody was used at a final dilution of 1:2000 in PBS/Tween-20, 1% nonfat dry milk.After three washes with PBS/Tween-20 blots were then incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit Ig whole antibody from donkey (Amersham) and washed five times with PBS/Tween-20. Immunoreactive proteins were detected by chemiluminescence (Amersham ECL reagents).Reverse Transcription and Amplification by Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)RNA was purified using the single-step total RNA isolation procedure (Chirgwin et al., 1979; Chomczynski and Sacchi, 1987). Washed and pelleted monocytes (28.6 × 106 cells/ml) were resuspended in denaturing solution (4 M guanidinium isothiocyanate, 25 mM sodium citrate, pH 7, 0.1 M 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine) and quick-frozen in methanol/dry ice for later extraction. All preparations were DNase treated for 15 min at 37°C and repurified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation.RT-PCR was carried out using a commercial RNA PCR kit (Saiki et al., 1988). First strand cDNA was generated from total RNA using random hexamers to prime the reverse transcription and was directly amplified by PCR following the addition of specific primer pairs (0.36 μg/tube) and Ampli-taq DNA polymerase. Oligonucleotide primers were: PDE4A5, 5′-AACAGCCTGAACAACTCTAAC-3′ and 3′-TCAGAGTCCACCCAAAATAAC-5′, defining a 907-bp product containing a XhoI site (Bolger et al., 1993); PDE4B2, 5′-AGCTCATGACCCAGATAAGTG-3′ and 3′-CTGTGAGTCCTTCTACCAATA-5′, defining a 625-bp product containing a SalI site (McLaughlin et al., 1993; Obernolte et al., 1993); PDE4C1, 5′-TCGACAACCAGAGGACTTAGG-3′ and 3′-GAAAGAGGACCCGAAGATAGG-5′, defining a 289-bp product containing an SstI site (Bolger et al., 1993); and PDE4D3, 5′-CGGAGATGACTTGATTGTGAC-3′ and 3′-CGTGTGGTAAAAAGTCCTTGC-5′, defining a 641-bp product containing a StuI site (Bolger et al., 1993; Baecker et al., 1994). A human β-actin primer set was used in the presence and absence of reverse transcriptase as a control for each RNA sample. Reactions were 1 min at 95°C, 30 s at 52°C, and 1 min at 72°C for a subsaturating cycle number (35 or 40 cycles). Products were electrophoresed on 3% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.cAMP AssayTo stop the incubation, 900-μl aliquots of incubation medium containing ∼1 × 106 cells were added to test tubes containing 100 μl of 100% trichloroacetic acid and 4000 counts/min of [3H]cAMP (added as a tracer). The samples were stored at −20°C before being assayed for cAMP content. When cAMP content was determined, the precipitated protein was separated from the soluble extract by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min. Trichloroacetic acid was removed with five successive extractions with water-saturated ether (Brooker et al. 1979). Cyclic AMP was measured following acetylation using commercially available radioimmunoassay kits (DuPont NEN). Cyclic AMP content was corrected for percentage of recovery (85-95%) and expressed as pmol of cAMP/106 cells.Calcium MobilizationAfter preincubating U937 cells with vehicle or 1 μM salbutamol and 30 μM rolipram for 3.25 h, the cells were centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min and resuspended to a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml in Krebs-Ringer-Henseleit buffer (plus 0.1% BSA) containing vehicle (control cells) or1 μM salbutamol plus 30 μM rolipram (treated cells). Cells were then exposed to 2 μM fura-2/AM, the pentacetoxymethyl ester of fura-2, at 32°C for 30 min. After the 30-min incubation period, cells were washed by centrifugation and resuspended in Krebs-Ringer-Henseleit buffer (plus 0.1% BSA) containing vehicle (control cells) or 1 μM salbutamol and 30 μM rolipram (treated cells) at 32°C for an additional 15 min to allow complete hydrolysis of the intracellular fura-2 ester. Using this protocol cells were exposed to vehicle or a combination of salbutamol and rolipram for a total of 4 h before Ca2+ mobilization was assessed. Cells were centrifuged and washed two times with cold Krebs-Ringer-Henseleit buffer (plus 0.1% BSA) and kept at room temperature until used for fluorescence determination as described previously (Winkler et al., 1988). Cells were exposed to vehicle or rolipram (10 μM) for 1 min before the addition of various concentrations of PGE2. One min after the addition of PGE2, cells were challenged with 3.3 nM leukotriene D4 (LTD4), and Ca2+ mobilization was monitored and quantified via fura-2 fluorescence (Winkler et al., 1988).Data Analysis and Statistical EvaluationData are expressed as the mean ± standard error. Significant differences between two means were determined by an unpaired or paired Student's t test. Differences among the means of more than two groups were determined using analysis of variance and a Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test. Differences among means were accepted as significant at p < 0.05.MaterialshrPDE4A, hrPDE4B, and hrPDE4D for use as standards were kindly prepared and provided by G. Livi and M. McLaughlin (SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, King of Prussia, PA). Racemic salbutamol (albuterol), (±)-rolipram, and LTD4 were obtained from SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals. Dithiothreitol was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. PGE2 and all other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Cyclic AMP radioimmunoassay kits were obtained from DuPont NEN. PGE2 and (±)-rolipram were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide as stock solutions (10 and 100 mM, respectively). The final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide never exceeded 0.1%. All other drugs were prepared as aqueous solutions.RESULTSPDE4 Subtype Gene ExpressionPDE4 subtype-specific RT-PCR products in control and PDE4-up-regulated cells are shown in Fig. 1. Transcripts for PDE4B and PDE4D were detected in untreated cells, whereas only a faint band corresponding to PDE4A was apparent. After treating cells for 4 h with a combination of salbutamol (1 μM) and rolipram (30 μM), conditions previously shown to produce a 2-4-fold increase in PDE4 catalytic activity (Torphy et al., 1992), the intensity of the bands corresponding to the PCR products for PDE4A and PDE4B increased. Interestingly, the PCR product derived from PDE4D message appeared to decrease. Transcript for PDE4C was not detected using this method. Equivalent intensities of the β-actin-specific bands were seen in control versus treated cells, confirming successful normalization of the mRNA. A PCR product for β-actin was not detected in the absence of reverse transcriptase, indicating that the RNA preparation was not contaminated with intact DNA.PDE4 ImmunoreactivityWestern analyses of PDE4 immunoreactivity were carried out using a polyclonal antibody raised against a purified GalK-hrPDE4A fusion protein or against a synthetic peptide unique to PDE4B. An immunblot representative of results from four experiments using the GalK-hrPDE4A antiserum is shown in Fig. 2. In none of the experiments was significant immunoreactivity detected that corresponded to a large molecular mass protein (∼60-120 kDa) in untreated U937 cells (Fig. 2A). However, after 4 h of treatment with salbutamol and rolipram a band of immunoreactivity was consistently observed. The band corresponded to a molecular mass of approximately 125-kDa, identical in size to a band of immunoreactivity detected in human blood monocytes. As expected, the antibody also bound to a truncated form of hrPDE4A that lacks 264 N-terminal amino acids. To demonstrate that the 125-kDa protein was indeed PDE4, studies were conducted in which the antibody was saturated with the truncated hrPDE4A before it was exposed to the immunoblot (Fig. 2B). Preabsorbing the antibody in this manner virtually abolished its ability to detect either hrPDE4A or U937 cell PDE4. Note that the preabsorption procedure also reduced or eliminated the immunoreactivity directed against several other minor bands in U937 cells, suggesting that these proteins represented fragments of PDE4.Figure 2:Western blot analysis of PDE4 immunoreactivity in U937 cells and human monocytes using antibody raised against GalK-hrPDE4A. Panel A, U937 cells were untreated or exposed to 1 μM salbutamol and 30 μM rolipram for 4 h. After the treatment period cells were washed extensively and lysed. Supernatant fractions were then prepared and identical amounts of protein (∼100 μg) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Also run in these studies were untreated human monocyte supernatants and lysates from yeast engineered to express a truncated form of hrPDE4A that lacked 265 amino acids on the N terminus. The data are representative of results from four (U937 cells) or three (monocytes) experiments. Panel B, additional experiments were conducted to confirm that the antibody was detecting PDE4 protein in U937 cells. In these studies, the antibody was diluted 1:100 into a lysate of either nontransfected yeast (control) or yeast that had been engineered to produce the truncated form of hrPDE4A (blocked). The following day, hrPDE4A (panel B, left) and treated (1 μM salbutamol plus 30 μM rolipram) U937 cell supernatants (panel B, right) were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels which were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with the control or preadsorbed antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The antibody raised against the GalK-hrPDE4 also detected hrPDE4D, but not hrPDE4B (Fig. 3A). Although a faint band of immunoreactivity in U937 cells was observed that corresponded to the appropriate molecular mass for PDE4D (∼92 kDa), its intensity was not increased in PDE4-up-regulated cells (Fig. 3A).Figure 3:Western blot analysis of PDE4A, PDE4B, and PDE4D immunoreactivity in U937 cells. Panel A, as in Fig. 2A, U937 cells were untreated or exposed to 1 μM salbutamol and 30 μM rolipram for 4 h. After the treatment period cells were washed extensively and lysed. Supernatant fractions were then prepared and identical amounts of protein (∼100 μg) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoreactivity was determined using antibody raised against GalK-hrPDE4A. Also run in these studies were lysates from yeast engineered to express hrPDE4A (full-length), PDE4B, or PDE4D. The data are representative of results from four (U937 cell lysates) or two (hrPDE4 subtypes) experiments. Panel B, additional experiments were conducted to detect PDE4B immunoreactivity in control U937 cells and cells treated for 4 h with salbutamol (1 μM) and rolipram (30 μM). For reference purposes, hrPDE4B was also run. The antibody used in these studies was raised against a unique carboxyl-terminal PDE4B peptide. The data are representative of two experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)An immunoblot produced with the antiserum raised against the PDE4B peptide is shown in Fig. 3B. Two bands of immunoreactivity were detected with hrPDE4B, a major band at ∼70 kDa and a minor band at ∼52 kDa. Several bands were detected in U937 cells, but only those corresponding to 70 and 52 kDa were increased in intensity after treating cells with a combination of rolipram and salbutamol. Preabsorbing the antiserum with PDE4B eliminated these two bands, but not the others.Effect of Up-regulating PDE4 Activity on PGE2-stimulated cAMP AccumulationTo determine whether up-regulating PDE4 activity had an impact on agonist-induced cAMP accumulation, U937 cells were treated for 4 h with vehicle or a combination of salbutamol (1 μM) and rolipram (30 μM). At the end of the 4-h pretreatment period, cells were washed extensively to remove drugs before being resuspended in drug-free Krebs-Ringer-Henseleit buffer. The cells were then exposed to 1 μM of PGE2 and cAMP was measured at various times over a 15-min period (Fig. 4). In vehicle-pretreated cells, basal cAMP content (1.7 ± 0.2 pmol/106 cells) was increased by 25-fold (41.5 ± 7.8 pmol/106 cells) within 2 min of being exposed to PGE2. In cells in which PDE4 activity had been up-regulated, basal cAMP content (2.4 ± 0.3 pmol/106 cells) was not significantly different from control cells. However, PGE2-stimulated cAMP accumulation was substantially less, reaching a maximum of only 23.3 ± 7.3 pmol/106 cells within 2 min. A pattern virtually identical to this was observed in separate studies using a larger concentration (10 μM) of PGE2 (data not shown).Figure 4:Effect of up-regulating PDE4 activity on the time course for PGE2-stimulated cAMP accumulation in U937 cells. Control cells (solid symbols) and cells treated for 4 h with 1 μM salbutamol and 30 μM rolipram (open symbols) were washed extensively and treated with 1 μM PGE2 in the absence (circles) or presence (squares) of 30 μM (±)-rolipram. When present, rolipram was reintroduced into the incubation medium 1 min before the addition of PGE2. Cyclic AMP content was determined at the times indicated. Basal cAMP content was 1.7 ± 0.2 pmol/106 cells in control cells and 2.4 ± 0.3 pmol/106 cells in PDE4 up-regulated cells. The values represent the mean ± S.E. of five experiments. ∗Significantly less than the value in cells not pretreated with rolipram and salbutamol (p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)PGE2-induced cAMP accumulation in control and PDE4 up-regulated cells was also assessed in the presence of 30 μM rolipram (Fig. 4). We reasoned that if the decrease in PGE2-stimulated cAMP accumulation observed in salbutamol-pretreated cells was due, at least in part, to an up-regulation of PDE4 activity, then inhibiting PDE4 in these cells with rolipram would tend to normalize their responsiveness to PGE2. Indeed, in the presence of rolipram, PGE2-stimulated cAMP accumulation over the 15-min time course was virtually identical in control versus PDE4-induced cells (Fig. 4). Only after 15 min of exposure to PGE2 was cAMP content slightly less in PDE4 up-regulated cells (68.2 ± 11.2 pmol/106 cells) than in control cells (89.4 ± 9.6 pmol/106 cells).The ability of a range of PGE2 concentrations (1 nM-10 μM) to elevate cAMP content in control and PDE4-up-regulated U937 cells is shown in Fig. 5. The conditions of these experiments were identical to those of the time course studies, except that cells were treated with various concentrations of PGE2 for a single fixed time (15 min) before cAMP content was determined. In control cells PGE2 produced a large, concentration-related increase in cAMP accumulation. For example, basal cAMP content (0.99 ± 0.14 pmol/106 cells) was increased to 52.9 ± 2.9 pmol/106 cells by 10 μM PGE2, greater than 50-fold over the basal level. In contrast, PGE2 had much less effect on cAMP content in cells in which PDE4 activity had been up-regulated. In fact, cAMP accumulation stimulated by 10 μM PGE2 was only 5.4 ± 0.5 pmol/106 cells, nearly 10-fold less than in control cells and only 5-fold above basal cAMP content (0.97 ± 0.12 pmol/106 cells).Figure 5:Effect of up-regulating PDE4 activity on concentration-response curves for PGE2-stimulated cAMP accumulation in U937 cells. Control cells (solid symbols) and cells treated for 4 h with 1 μM salbutamol and 30 (±) μM rolipram (open symbols) were washed extensively and treated with PGE2 in the absence (circles) or presence (squares) of 10 μM (±) rolipram. When used, rolipram was reintroduced into the incubation medium 1 min before the addition of PGE2. The cells were then exposed to various concentrations of PGE2 (1-10,000 nM). Cyclic AMP content was determined 15 min after the addition of PGE2. Basal cAMP content was 0.99 ± 0.14 pmol/106 cells in control cells and 0.97 ± 0.12 pmol/106 cells in PDE4 up-regulated cells. The values represent the mean ± S.E. of five experiments. ∗Significantly less than value in cells not pretreated with rolipram and salbutamol (p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In the presence of 10 μM rolipram, PGE2-induced cAMP accumulation was greater in both control cells and, even more impressively, cells in which PDE4 activity had been up-regulated. Overall, inhibiting PDE4 activity with rolipram increased PGE2-stimulated cAMP accumulation by 2-fold in control cells and 12-fold in PDE4 up-regulated cells. Thus, in the presence of rolipram, maximal PGE2-stimulated cAMP accumulation in cells in which PDE4 activity had been up-regulated was only 2-fold less than in control cells. This contrasts wi"

The 14.3.3 polypeptides endogenous to Sf9 cells associate in situ with both active and inactive recombinant Raf and copurify at a fairly reproducible molar ratio that is probably ≥1. Purified baculoviral recombinant Raf, despite its preassociated 14.3.3 polypeptide, binds additional recombinant 14.3.3 ζ polypeptide in vitro, in a saturable and specific reaction, forming a complex that is resistant to 1 M LiCl. A two-hybrid analysis indicates that 14.3.3 ζ binds primarily to Raf noncatalytic sequences distinct from those that bind Ras-GTP, and in vitro 14.3.3 ζ binds to Raf without inhibiting the Ras-Raf association or Raf-catalyzed MEK phosphorylation. Deletion analysis of 14.3.3 ζ (1-245) indicates that the 14.3.3 domain responsible for binding to Raf extends over the carboxyl-terminal 100 amino acids, whereas 14.3.3 dimerization is mediated by amino-terminal sequences. As with Ras, the 14.3.3 ζ polypeptide does not activate purified Raf directly in vitro. Moreover, expression of recombinant 14.3.3 ζ in COS cells beyond the substantial level of endogenous 14.3.3 protein does not alter endogenous Raf kinase, as judged by the activity of a cotransfected Erk-1 reporter. Coexpression of recombinant 14.3.3 with recombinant Myc-tagged Raf in COS cells does increase substantially the Myc-Raf kinase activity achieved during transient expression, which is attributable primarily to an increased level of Myc-Raf polypeptide, without alteration of Myc-Raf specific activity or the activation that occurs in response to epidermal growth factor or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. Nevertheless, evidence that 14.3.3 actively participates in Raf activation in situ is provided by the finding that although full-length 14.3.3 ζ binds active Raf in situ, truncated versions of 14.3.3, some of which bind Raf polypeptide in situ nearly as well as full-length 14.3.3 ζ, are recovered in association only with inactive Raf polypeptides. Thus, 14.3.3 polypeptides bind tightly to one or more sites on c-Raf. Overexpression of 14.3.3 ζ enhances the expression of recombinant Raf, perhaps by stabilizing the Raf polypeptide. In addition, Raf polypeptides bound to truncated 14.3.3 polypeptides are unable to undergo activation in situ, indicating that 14.3.3 participates in the process of Raf activation by mechanisms that remain to be elucidated.

An important insight into the initial step in Raf activation was the discovery that Raf binds directly to the GTP-bound form of Ras (1Zhang X.-f. Settleman J. Kyriakis J.M. Takeuchi-Suzuki E.

This Raf-Ras-GTP interaction does not result directly in Raf activation, inasmuch as addition of Ras GTP to inactive, baculoviral recombinant Raf in vitro does not alter Raf kinase activity. Presumably, Ras GTP functions in situ to translocate Raf to the surface membrane so as to enable its activation by other processes. Support for this model is provided by the demonstration that fusion of plasma membrane targeting (CAAX) sequences onto the Raf carboxyl terminus is transforming and bypasses the need for Ras in Raf activation; a large increase in the activity of membrane-associated Raf is observed in growth factor-deprived cells, and EGF stimulates Raf CAAX activity a further 10-fold in a Ras-independent reaction(4Leevers S.J.

The inability of Ras to directly activate Raf, together with the finding that mitogen activation of Raf becomes Ras independent if Raf is targeted directly to the plasma membrane, implies that physiologic activation of (Ras bound) Raf requires Raf interaction with other plasma membrane components, e.g. lipids, polypeptides, or both.

In this report, we describe the binding of c Raf-1 in vitro and in situ to the 14.3.3 ζ polypeptide, an arachidonate-selective acyl transferase and putative phospholipase A2(7Zupan L.A. Steffens D.L. Berry C.A. Landt M. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8707-8710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We define the Raf domain employed for the binding of 14.3.3 ζ in situ and the 14.3.3 ζ domains necessary for self-association and Raf binding; we find that while carboxyl-terminal fragments of 14.3.3 bind Raf in situ nearly as well as full-length 14.3.3, only the latter is found in association with catalytically active Raf polypeptides in situ. cDNAs encoding murine 14.3.3 ζ were isolated from a murine T cell DNA library by two-hybrid expression cloning according to Durfee et al.(8Durfee T.

The binding in vitro of various polypeptides to GST or GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose was carried out at 30°C for 30 min in buffer A containing 25 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol; polypeptide concentrations are described in the figure legends. The beads were washed in excess binding buffer three times; the retained polypeptides were eluted directly into SDS-containing buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by protein staining, immunoblot, or autoradiography as described. The association of polypeptides in situ was assessed during transient expression in COS M7 cells and transfected by the DEAE-dextran method. The cDNA sequences encoding Raf were inserted into two mammalian expression vectors; Myc-Raf contains a 33-amino acid epitope from human c-Myc, known to be reactive with the monoclonal antibody 9B7.3(13Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar), appended to the Raf amino terminus, and inserted into pMT2. Raf was also expressed as a GST fusion protein using the vector pEBG, which encodes glutathione S-transferase driven by the EF1α promoter/enhancer. The cDNA encoding 14.3.3 ζ was introduced unmodified into the vector CMV5, into the pEB vector (lacking the glutathione S-transferase sequences) with a 9-amino acid epitope from the influenza hemagglutinin (HA epitope, (14Field J.

Deletion mutation of the 14.3.3 ζ was made by polymerase chain reaction from the 5′- and 3′-ends of the cDNA. The polymerase chain reaction products were subcloned into the pEBG vector, and the structures were verified by DNA sequence analysis. All transfections utilized a total of 20 μg of DNA; 48 h after transfection, extracts were prepared by homogenization in a buffer containing 25 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 25 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 1% Triton X-100, and proteinase inhibitors. Immunoprecipitations were carried out for 1 h at 4°C using the monoclonal antibody 12CA5 for the HA epitope or the anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9B7; immune complexes were harvested with protein G-Sepharose. GST-Raf and GST-14.3.3 fusions were recovered using glutathione-Sepharose beads. Immunoblots of Raf were carried out using 9B7.3 for Myc-Raf or a polyclonal antipeptide antibody raised to the carboxyl-terminal 12 amino acids of human c-Raf-1. Immunoblot of 14.3.3 was carried out using a polyclonal antibody raised to cleaved, purified recombinant murine 14.3.3 ζ.

This truncated Raf polypeptide, also known as BXB-Raf(15Bruder J.T. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R.

Five of these cDNAs gave much more rapid complementation of LacZ+ activity than the remaining cDNAs; the former all encoded MEK1 or MEK2. Among the remaining 15 cDNAs were 5 that encoded polypeptide sequences 100% identical to the rat ζ isoform of the 14.3.3 polypeptide, and that differed from a human platelet PLA2 polypeptide by a single conservative substitution(7Zupan L.A.

No interaction of 14.3.3 ζ with p70 S6 kinase and amino-terminal regulatory domain of protein kinase C ζ (residues 1-245) or c-Ha-Ras (1-185) was detected (data not shown). The relative selectivity of the 14.3.3-Raf association led us to undertake a further characterization of this interaction. The two-hybrid method was employed to identify the region on Raf that interacts with 14.3.3 ζ in comparison to MEK1 and Ras, proteins known to interact with Raf in a physiologic context. The Ras binding site has previously been localized to Raf residues 50-150(3Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.

Biol. 1994; 14: 5318-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), whereas neither MEK nor 14.3.3 ζ interacts with Raf 1-257. MEK, a known Raf substrate, interacts strongly with the BXB-Raf and holo-Raf (1-648) but not at all with Raf 1-332 (Table 1). By contrast, 14.3.3 ζ interacts weakly with BXB-Raf and holo-Raf (1-648) but associates strongly with the Raf 1-332 (Table 1). Thus, 14.3.3 ζ binds in situ most avidly to a segment of Raf between amino acids 257 and 332, a noncatalytic region distinct from those that bind to Ras or MEK.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The ability of recombinant Raf to interact directly with recombinant 14.3.3 ζ was investigated. The 14.3.3 ζ polypeptide was expressed in E. coli as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein(9Guan K.-L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar), purified by GSH affinity chromatography, and employed with and without thrombin cleavage (Fig. 1). The functional integrity of the recombinant 14.3.3 ζ was evaluated by examining its ability to catalyze autoacylation from [14C]arachidonate sn-2-phosphatidylethanalomine. The GST-14.3.3 fusion protein and thrombin-cleaved 14.3.3 ζ polypeptides, although devoid of PLA2 activity using a variety of substrates, each catalyze the cleavage of the sn-2 fatty acid of [14C]arachidonyl sn-2-phosphatidylethanolamine and the formation of a covalent [14C]arachidonyl-14.3.3 protein adduct, presumably an acyl-enzyme intermediate. Thus, the recombinant prokaryotic 14.3.3 exhibits an acyl transferase but not a PLA2 function, similar to that described by Gross and colleagues(7Zupan L.A. Steffens D.L. Berry C.A. Landt M. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8707-8710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Raf 1 containing a hexahistidine tag at its carboxyl terminus was expressed in Sf9 cells by baculoviral infection and purified by nickel chelate chromatography, either as a catalytically inactive polypeptide (Fig. 2, lane6) or in a catalytically active form, as a result of coinfection with baculoviral v-Ras plus v-Src (Fig. 2, lanes1 and 3-5)(10Williams N.G.

An antiserum against prokaryotic recombinant murine 14.3.3 ζ, reactive primarily with epitopes in the amino-terminal half of 14.3.3 ζ (Fig. 5C, upperpanel), readily immunoblots the 28- and 30-kDa 14.3.3 polypeptides endogenous to Sf9 (Fig. 2, lane2) and COS cell (Fig. 7A, upperpanel) extracts; immunoblot of several Raf-1 isolates (Fig. 2, lanes2-6) shows that both the active (lanes3-5) and inactive (lane6) Raf polypeptides purified from Sf9 cells are recovered in association with endogenous Sf9 14.3.3 polypeptides. Both the recombinant Raf and Sf9 14.3.3 polypeptides are readily visualized on Coomassie Blue-stained gels of the preparations of purified Raf (Fig. 2, lane1); although the relative Coomassie Blue binding per unit mass for c-Raf-1 and 14.3.3 is unknown, the comparable staining intensities observed for Raf and the co-purified 14.3.3, together with the general tendency of acidic polypeptides such as 14.3.3 to stain weakly with Coomassie Blue, suggests that the molar ratio of 14.3.3 to Raf in these isolates is at least 1. Moreover, a relatively constant ratio of the two polypeptides is recovered in different isolates of Raf, whether active (Fig. 2, lanes3-5) or inactive (Fig. 2, lane6).Figure 5:Deletion analysis of functional domains of 14.3.3 ζ.

The ability of 14.3.3 to bind active baculoviral Raf was verified by the demonstration that GST-14.3.3 can specifically immobilize essentially all of the MEK phosphorylating activity in a preparation of active Raf (Fig. 3, lowerpanel, lanes1-4), and the complex of active Raf and GST-14.3.3 is resistant to washing with 1 M LiCl. Extensive Raf autophosphorylation in vitro did not interfere with Raf binding to GST-14.3.3 ζ (Fig. 3, upperpanel, lanes6 and 7); inactive Raf polypeptide (identifiable by its slightly faster mobility in SDS-PAGE) also binds specifically to GST-14.3.3 ζ (Fig. 3, upperpanel, lane5). These results demonstrate that baculoviral recombinant Raf, although purified as a complex with Sf9 14.3.3, binds additional 14.3.3 in vitro, and this binding is saturable. The ability of GST-14.3.3 to specifically adsorb essentially all the Raf polypeptides, both active (Fig. 3) and inactive, from such preparations indicates that GST-14.3.3 must bind Raf polypeptides that already contain bound Sf9 14.3.3. Although displacement of or dimerization with the preassociated Sf9 14.3.3 is possible, the most plausible model envisions more than one binding site on Raf for 14.3.3. Thus, the ability of 14.3.3 ζ to interact with Raf in the two-hybrid yeast expression system certainly reflects the direct binding of the two polypeptides; however, the number of 14.3.3 binding sites on Raf and their precise localization remain to be more fully defined. The interaction of recombinant 14.3.3 ζ with Raf in situ was examined further by cotransfection (Fig. 4). An epitope-tagged recombinant 14.3.3 ζ polypeptide was created by fusion of a 9-amino acid epitope from the influenza hemagglutinin to either the amino terminus or carboxyl terminus, enabling the selective immunoprecipitation of the tagged 14.3.3 ζ polypeptide with anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5(14Field J. Nikawa J-I. Broek D. MacDonald B. Rodgers L. Wilson I.A. Lerner R.A. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2159-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). After transfection of either tagged version of 14.3.3 ζ, the anti-HA immunoprecipitates contain, in addition to a 30-kDa band of HA-tagged recombinant 14.3.3 ζ, a 28-kDa polypeptide that is not reactive with the HA antibody but is reactive with the anti-14.3.3 antiserum (data not shown). Thus, the recombinant HA-tagged 14.3.3 ζ forms complexes (presumably dimers) with endogenous 14.3.3 polypeptides, and free amino or carboxyl termini are not crucial for dimerization. Two tagged versions of recombinant Raf-1 were constructed by introduction at the Raf amino terminus of a Myc epitope (13Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar) or by fusion to GST. After cotransfection of HA-tagged 14.3.3 ζ with either version of Raf into COS cells, anti-HA 14.3.3 ζ immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4, lanes3, 4, 7, 8) contain substantial immunoreactive Raf-1, ranging from 30 to 100% of the amount of Raf polypeptide recovered from an identical aliquot of the COS cell extract by anti-Myc immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4, lanes5 and 6) or by binding to GSH-Sepharose (Fig. 4lanes1 and 2). The anti-Myc immunoprecipitates of Raf-1 contained in addition to the recombinant 30-kDa HA-tagged 14.3.3 ζ polypeptide some endogenous 28-kDa 14.3.3 polypeptide, as visualized by immunoblot with anti-14.3.3 antiserum (not shown). Thus, a substantial portion of recombinant Raf is recovered in association with the coexpressed 14.3.3 ζ, indicating clearly that the 14.3.3 ζ associates in situ with most or all of the recombinant Raf-1 in COS cells. The domains of 14.3.3 ζ responsible for dimerization and Raf association were determined by coexpression in COS cells of Myc-Raf or Myc-14.3.3 with GST-14.3.3 (1-245) and a series of 14.3.3 fragments constructed as GST fusions (Fig. 5A). The transiently expressed GST-14.3.3 fusions were purified from COS cell extracts using GSH-Sepharose, and the isolates were evaluated for the presence of the cotransfected full-length Myc-tagged 14.3.3 polypeptide (Fig. 5B) or Myc-Raf (Fig. 5C). The Coomassie Blue stain of the purified, COS recombinant GST-14.3.3 fusions and their associated polypeptides is shown in Fig. 5B, upperpanel. The variation in Coomassie Blue staining of the GST-14.3.3 fusions reflects the variability in their expression in situ rather than in their recovery, inasmuch as recovery of the irrelevant endogenous COS polypeptides that bind to GSH-Sepharose (designated as A and B, Fig. 5B, upperpanel) is identical in all lanes. The binding of cotransfected Myc-tagged 14.3.3 polypeptides to the GST-14.3.3 fusions is evident as the 30-kDa Coomassie band seen just above bandA in lane2 (absent in lane1) and more faintly in lanes3-5. The identity of this band as Myc-14.3.3 is verified by anti-Myc immunoblot (Fig. 5B, lowerpanel). These results indicate that although a free NH2 terminus is not critical for 14.3.3 self-association, the amino-terminal 80 amino acids of 14.3.3 are sufficient to confer some 14.3.3 self-association, and nearly full self-association is seen with GST-14.3.3 (1-140). Reciprocally, deletion of the amino-terminal amino acids from 14.3.3 markedly reduces its ability to self-associate; little (Fig. 5B, l"

Methylation at both the N-7 position of the mismatched G and the N-3 position of the mispaired A interfere with MutY binding. In addition to these mismatched bases, MutY also contacts purines on both sides of the mismatch. Binding and endonuclease activities of MutY were assayed with 20-mer oligonucleotides containing A/G, A/C, A/7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-guanine (A/GO), A/inosine (A/I), A/2-aminopurine (A/2AP), nebularine/G (N/G), inosine/G (I/G), 2AP/G, and 7-deaza-adenosine/G (Z/G) mispairs. The C-8 keto group of GO in A/GO contributes to a much tighter binding but weaker endonuclease activity than is seen with A/G. Because A/I is not specifically well recognized by MutY, the 2-amino group of G in A/G is essential for recognition. The C-6 keto group present in A/G but absent in A/2AP is also important for recognition. The 6-amino group of adenine appears not to be required for either binding or endonuclease activity because N/G is as good a substrate as A/G. The 2AP/G mispair is bound and cleaved weaker than is the A/G mispair. Binding and endonuclease activities are abolished when the N-7 group of A is replaced by C-7 as in the Z/G mispair.

INTRODUCTIONPlastocyanin is a small (97-104 amino acids), lumen-localized, copper-binding protein that functions in photosynthesis to catalyze electron transfer from cytochrome f of the membrane-associated cyt 1The abbreviations used are: cytcytochromeRubiscoribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenaseTAPtris-acetate-phosphate medium. b6f complex to P700+ in Photosystem I, and in respiration (in cyanobacteria) to catalyze electron transfer from the cytochrome b6f complex to the terminal oxidase (reviewed recently by Morand et al., 1994; Redinbo et al., 1994). It contains a single redox active copper (Em ~370 mV) and is referred to as a “blue” copper protein owing to the absorption properties of the oxidized form of the protein. The catalytic activity of plastocyanin is, of course, dependent on this copper center. Accordingly, copper-deficient plants or chelator-treated thylakoid membranes display loss of plastocyanin activity and impaired photosynthesis.In the case of green algae and cyanobacteria, however, some species have the capacity to survive copper deficiency by inducing a soluble c-type cytochrome to serve as a functional backup for plastocyanin (Wood, 1978; Sandmann et al., 1983; reviewed by Merchant, 1995). In these organisms, if copper is available in amounts sufficient to satisfy the plastocyanin biosynthetic pathway, this copper protein accumulates and is used for photosynthetic electron transfer. Generally, cyt c6 is not detected in such cultures. However, under conditions of copper deficiency (which would limit or prevent the synthesis of a functional form of plastocyanin), green algae and cyanobacteria remain photosynthetically competent by inducing the synthesis of heme-containing cyt c6. These organisms thus serve as excellent model systems for the study of the copper-dependent synthesis of plastocyanin.Regulation of plastocyanin accumulation has been examined in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Scenedesmus obliquus, and Pediastrum boryanum among the green algae, and Anabaena and Synechocystis spp. among the cyanobacteria (Merchant and Bogorad, 1986a, 1986b; van der Plas et al., 1989; Briggs et al., 1990; Bovy et al., 1992; Li and Merchant, 1992; Nakamura et al., 1992; Zhang et al., 1992; Ghassemian et al., 1994). Examination of mRNA and protein abundance as a function of copper concentration provides evidence for copper-responsive regulation at two stages in plastocyanin biosynthesis: 1) at the level of template accumulation (mRNA abundance) and 2) at the level of accumulation of mature protein. The relative contribution of processes regulating mRNA abundance versus protein abundance differs in various organisms and can depend upon the growth phase of the culture (reviewed by Merchant, 1996). In general, when both levels of control are displayed, lower concentrations of copper are required to induce the accumulation of plastocyanin-encoding mRNAs than are required for the accumulation of the protein. For the latter, the requirement for copper appears to be stoichiometric (Merchant et al., 1991). This suggests that the binding of copper to the polypeptide might be an important factor in determining the steady state abundance of the protein.The mechanisms underlying differential accumulation of the protein have been investigated further in Chlamydomonas by pulse-radiolabeling experiments. The results indicate that translation of the message as well as import and processing of the translation product occur normally and regardless of whether copper is present, which is consistent with a model in which association of copper with apoplastocyanin occurs after translocation of the protein into the thylakoid lumen (Merchant and Bogorad, 1986b; Li et al., 1990). However, in copper-deficient cells, mature plastocyanin is degraded (t < 20 min), whereas in copper-supplemented cells, the newly synthesized protein is extremely stable (t > several hours). If the apoform of the protein were a better substrate for proteolysis than the holoform, the copper-dependent differential degradation of plastocyanin could be explained. In copper-deficient cells, the newly synthesized protein would remain in the protease-susceptible apoform, whereas in copper-supplemented cells, it would convert to the protease-resistant holoform. Crystallographic studies reveal only minimal structural changes between apoplastocyanin and holoplastocyanin (Garrett et al., 1984); however, in solution, the apoprotein was noted to be much less stable (Koide et al., 1993). Thus, it is reasonable to suggest that it might indeed be more susceptible to one or more chloroplast proteases in vivo compared to the holoprotein, whose conformation is metal-stabilized (McLendon and Radany, 1978; Parsell and Sauer, 1989; Koide et al., 1993).There are many well-documented examples of specific degradation of proteins in chloroplasts. In Chlamydomonas, the small subunit of Rubisco is selectively degraded if it cannot assemble with large subunits to form the multimeric holoenzyme (Schmidt and Mishkind, 1983). Likewise, in rye, the nuclear-encoded subunits of the chloroplast coupling factor are degraded in the absence of synthesis of the chloroplast-encoded subunits (Biekmann and Feierabend, 1985). In the case of chlorophyll-protein complexes, the apoproteins are degraded under conditions where chlorophyll synthesis is reduced (e.g. Bennett, 1981; Slovin and Tobin, 1982; Kim et al., 1994). And, for the electron transfer complexes, the pleiotropic effects of mutations affecting a single subunit of the photosynthetic complexes have been shown, in many cases, to result from the specific degradation of the remaining subunits of the affected complex while other (unaffected) complexes accumulate normally (Erickson et al., 1986; Kuchka et al., 1989; Pakrasi et al., 1991; Takahashi et al., 1991; Kuras and Wollman, 1994). Distinct protease activities have been localized to chloroplasts, but their relationships to specific degradation processes have not yet been fully described (Liu and Jagendorf, 1984; Kuwabara and Hashimoto, 1990; Hoober and Hughes, 1992; Bushnell et al., 1993). Questions of interest with regard to proteolytic events in the chloroplast relate to location, regulation, substrate recognition, and substrate specificity. In the case of plastocyanin, the degradative activity is presumed to be lumen-localized, or at least thylakoid membrane-associated, since the fully processed form of the protein serves as the substrate for degradation.We sought to compare the properties of purified apo- and holoplastocyanin with respect to protease susceptibility in vitro and in vivo with a view to increasing our understanding of 1) proteolytic processes in chloroplasts and 2) the mechanism of adaptation of the photosynthetic apparatus to copper-deficiency. The data presented in this work support a model in which apoplastocyanin is relatively unstable in solution. We also show that apoplastocyanin is highly susceptible in vitro to proteases. Nevertheless, the increased susceptibility of apoplastocyanin to proteolysis may not be sufficient to explain the regulation of its degradation in vivo. We propose that a specific mechanism exists for activating an apoplastocyanin-degrading protease in copper-deficient cells and that this additional factor is an important determinant of the rate of apoplastocyanin degradation in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Growth and CultureC. reinhardtii strain CC125 (wild-type) was grown at 22°C under 125 μmol/m2/s illumination in either copper-deficient or copper-supplemented Tris acetate-phosphate (TAP) medium (Merchant and Bogorad, 1986a; Harris, 1988). A plastocyanin-deficient mutant, strain pc235, was maintained at room temperature in TAP medium under fluorescent house lights on the laboratory bench with occasional swirling. The mutant strain was transferred to an incubator (15-25 μmol/m2/s, 22°C, with continuous agitation at 225 revolutions/min) for 1 or 2 days before collecting cells for isolation of protein or other analysis.Analysis of ProteinProtein concentration was determined using the Coomassie Blue G-250 dye binding method as described by the manufacturer of the reagent (Pierce). Cell extracts containing soluble proteins were separated by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis (Li and Merchant, 1992), and proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue R-250 or silver staining (Oakley et al., 1980). Western blot analysis of plastocyanin levels was performed as described previously (Li and Merchant, 1992). Bound antibody was detected with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad). To ensure that plastocyanin was quantitatively released into the supernatant fraction after freeze-thaw lysis of the cells, the pellet fractions were occasionally analyzed (after detergent solubilization) for immunoreactive plastocyanin species. In vivo radiolabeling and analysis of the radiolabeled products was carried out as described previously (Merchant and Bogorad, 1986).Purification of PlastocyaninPlastocyanin was purified as described by Redinbo et al.(1993) except that the final ultrafiltration step on Centricon-30 was eliminated. No impurities were detected by silver staining of 1 μg of protein eluted from the G-50 column and analyzed after electrophoresis on SDS-containing polyacrylamide gels.Preparation of Apoplastocyanin and Reconstitution of HoloplastocyaninApoplastocyanin was prepared by removal of Cu(I) from purified plastocyanin under a nitrogen atmosphere (see Tamilarasan and McMillin, 1986; Li and Merchant, 1992). In a typical reaction, 60 μM plastocyanin in 5 ml of 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) was reduced by the addition of sodium ascorbate (5-fold molar excess) and dialyzed against 500 ml of a solution containing 25 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.05) and 10 mM KCN for 2 h at 0°C. Excess cyanide was removed by dialysis (also under a nitrogen atmosphere) against a solution containing 25 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.05) for 3 h with one change. The yield of apoplastocyanin was about 84-90%. To prepare apoplastocyanin in a high salt solution, (NH4)2SO4 was added to 0.5 M into the dialysis buffers. Reconstitution of holoplastocyanin was performed by direct addition of cupric ions (10-fold molar excess) in the form of cupric acetate into the above apoplastocyanin preparation (concentration ~60 μM in total volumes ranging from 1 to 5 ml). Excess copper was removed by dialysis against 500 ml of a solution containing 25 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.05) with one change. Where indicated, the dialysis buffer included 0.5 M (NH4)2SO4. All protein samples (apoplastocyanin and reconstituted holoplastocyanin) were stored at −20°C for subsequent analysis including determination of protein concentration, difference spectroscopy, and protease susceptibility assays. About 50-85% of the apoprotein was reconstituted with copper by this method. Copper-containing plastocyanin was detected by a difference spectrum (ferricyanide-oxidized minus ascorbate-reduced), and the amount of holoplastocyanin was estimated using a difference extinction coefficient of 49 mM-1 cm-1 at 595 nm. The difference spectra representative of the samples of plastocyanin used for measurement of CD spectra and protease susceptibility are shown (Fig. 1). The visible and UV spectra (not shown) were recorded on a Uvikon 930 spectrophotometer. The estimation of holoplastocyanin content was not affected by salt concentration.Measurement of Circular Dichroic SpectraThe CD spectra were measured in a Jasco 600 spectropolarimeter (Japan Spectroscopic Co., Ltd. Japan) in a 0.1-mm cylindrical quartz cuvette with samples containing 1) purified (apo)plastocyanin, 2) purified holoplastocyanin, or 3) reconstituted holoplastocyanin (all at 0.56 mg/ml) in a solution buffered with 25 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.05). Measurements (at 2-nm intervals, measuring time 1 s, averaged over four measuring cycles) were made at room temperature. The spectrum of the solvent was subtracted from the protein spectra.Modification of the Cysteinyl Side Chain in ApoplastocyaninTo apo- or holoplastocyanin (12 μg in 50 μl of a solution containing 25 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.05)), 1 μl of 4 mM maleimidylphenyl methylcoumarin (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) in dimethyl formamide was added. After 60 min at room temperature, the sample was diluted 20-fold with 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), and 2 μl of dithiothreitol was added from a 100 mM stock solution to a final concentration representing a 50-fold molar excess with respect to the maleimidylphenyl methylcoumarin concentration. Under these conditions, the dissociation of copper from holoplastocyanin is avoided. The protein in the diluted sample was subsequently concentrated in a Centricon-3 unit (Amicon Corp., Beverly, MA) to remove excess dye and dithiothreitol. One-third of the concentrated sample was analyzed by electrophoretic separation in polyacrylamide gels under non-denaturing conditions to resolve the various forms of plastocyanin (Li and Merchant, 1992). Each of the samples was also analyzed on an SDS-containing gel after reduction of disulfide linkages to confirm that each form indeed comigrated after denaturation.Protease Susceptibility Assay10 μg of protein (holoplastocyanin or apoplastocyanin) was incubated at 25°C with 0.02 units of chymotrypsin (diluted from a 1 mg/ml stock) in a solution buffered with 100 mM sodium Tricine (pH 8.0) with or without the addition of 0.5 M (NH4)2SO4 as indicated, in a total volume of 30 μl. The reaction was timed from the addition of protease. At each time interval, a 5-μl aliquot was removed and transferred to another tube containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 μl of a 1 mg/ml stock solution in 100% isopropyl alcohol) to stop the reaction. The product was diluted with H2O so that the final salt concentration was <50 mM. Each sample was analyzed by non-denaturing electrophoresis in a polyacrylamide gel as described (Li and Merchant, 1992). The protein was visualized by staining with a silver reagent (Oakley et al., 1980). The specific activity of chymotrypsin at different salt concentrations, assessed according to the manufacturer's instructions using BTEE (N-benzoyl-L-tyrosine ethyl ester) (Sigma) as a substrate, was found to be independent of salt concentration within the range tested (0-0.5 M (NH4)2SO4).Strain pc235The plastocyanin-deficient strain pc235 was chosen from a collection of non-photosynthetic mutants enriched by metronidazole treatment after UV mutagenesis (Harris, 1989). Survivors of the metronidazole enrichment step were tested on minimal and TAP media to confirm their acetate-requiring phenotype. Western blot analysis of cell extracts prepared from non-photosynthetic mutants allowed us to identify strains displaying a plastocyanin-minus (or plastocyanin-deficient) phenotype. Five such mutants (referred to as pc strains) were identified. 2H. Li, J. Quinn, D. Culler, J. Girard-Bascou, S. Merchant, manuscript in preparation. The defect in these strains appeared to be localized to plastocyanin biosynthesis, since the pc mutants displayed a conditional acetate-requiring phenotype. Specifically, pc strains were acetate requiring in copper-containing medium but not in copper-deficient medium (when plastocyanin function is taken over by cyt c6). One of the pc strains, strain pc235, which exhibited a leaky non-photosynthetic phenotype, was found to accumulate higher levels of apoplastocyanin, but lower levels of holoplastocyanin, relative to wild-type strains, despite full copper supplementation of the medium. Northern blot analysis of the mRNA isolated from pc235 indicated that it contains normal amounts of plastocyanin encoding messages. The mRNA encoded a preprotein that could be precipitated with antibodies raised against plastocyanin and that co-migrated with the wild-type pre-protein. 3H. Li and S. Merchant, unpublished results. In vivo radiolabeling experiments indicated that plastocyanin synthesis and maturation in this strain was normal (see Fig. 6) and comparable to a wild-type strain. Further, sequence analysis of the plastocyanin-encoding genomic DNA in pc235 indicated a wild-type sequence for the entire transcribed region, including the intron. The phenotype therefore was concluded to result from a mutation lying outside the structural gene for plastocyanin. The defect in pc235 is thus attributed to a trans-acting factor that determines either the formation of holoplastocyanin from apoplastocyanin or that stabilizes the holoprotein in vivo after it is assembled. In either case, most of the plastocyanin in strain pc235 must be thermodynamically less stable (see “Results”).Figure 6:Synthesis of mature plastocyanin in strain pc235. C. reinhardtii strain pc235 was cultured in copper-deficient medium (-Cu) or supplemented with copper chloride (+Cu) prior to radiolabeling with Na235SO4 for 15 min. The cells were sampled after a 100-fold dilution of the radiolabel by the addition of unlabeled Na2SO4 to 10 mM, and after addition of copper chloride to the copper-deficient culture to 6 μM. Label incorporation into total soluble proteins in equivalent volumes of cell extract are displayed in the top panel. Plastocyanin was quantitatively immunoprecipitated from equal volumes of soluble cell extract and analyzed by electrophoresis through a (12%) polyacrylamide gel under denaturing conditions (bottom panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Miscellaneous Materials“Gold-label” chemicals for preparation of copper-free medium were purchased from Aldrich.

A simple explanation for differential degradation was that copper-deficient cells contained a form of plastocyanin that was more susceptible to degradation. Since copper-deficient cells were found to synthesize and process plastocyanin precursors at approximately the same rate as copper-supplemented cells, it was likely that mature apoplastocyanin was the protease-susceptible species in vivo. To test the properties of apoplastocyanin with respect to its structure and susceptibility to proteases, it was necessary to prepare purified apoplastocyanin, and this was accomplished by chelation of copper with cyanide (Fig. 1). Visible spectroscopy confirmed that the preparation of apoplastocyanin displayed very little absorbance characteristic of the blue copper center. The yield of apoplastocyanin in various preparations ranged from 84 to 90%. The ability of apoplastocyanin to reconstitute with copper indicated that the preparation was not irreversibly denatured (Fig. 1C).The structure of the native protein in the crystal form revealed that it is an eight-stranded, anti-parallel β-sandwich (Colman et al., 1978; Guss and Freeman, 1983). Removal of the copper from the crystal did not affect the structure very significantly, and it was concluded that copper was not required for the folding of the polypeptide into its native structure (Garrett et al., 1984). Nevertheless, in vitro folding studies revealed that although apoplastocyanin was capable of folding in the absence of copper, the folded structure was not stable in solution in the absence of high concentrations of salt (Koide et al., 1993). Our preparation of apoplastocyanin was therefore characterized by CD spectroscopy for the diagnostic β-strand spectrum (Draheim et al., 1986) (Fig. 2). The spectra of the native holoprotein and the reconstituted holoprotein were very similar. In fact, the estimated secondary structure of the reconstituted holoprotein was not significantly different from the secondary structure of the native protein (Table 1). However, the spectrum of the apoprotein is clearly altered. Specifically, the apoprotein has significantly reduced β-sheet content, which suggests that it does not display substantial native structure under these conditions. The fact that the apoprotein could be reconstituted with copper to yield a holoprotein that displayed the characteristic spectroscopic properties (Figure 1:, Figure 2:) indicates that our preparation was indeed capable of adopting the native structure and was not irreversibly denatured.Figure 2:Far UV CD spectra of apo-, holo-, and reconstituted plastocyanin. The plastocyanin content of each sample was the same (0.56 mg/ml). Each sample was in a solution containing 25 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.05) in a cuvette with a pathlength of 0.1 mm. All measurements were made at room temperature.

In earlier work, we had identified the three species as apoplastocyanin, a disulfide-linked dimer of apoplastocyanin, and residual holoplastocyanin (Li and Merchant, 1992). Similar analysis of spinach apoplastocyanin revealed the same population of species (Li et al., 1990). Bacterial amicyanin also readily dimerizes once the copper is removed from the holoprotein (Kumar and Davidson, 1992). To demonstrate more convincingly that the species identified as apoplastocyanin indeed contained a reactive accessible thiol group (as opposed to holoplastocyanin where the single cysteine provides a ligand to the copper, or the dimer where the cysteine participates in the disulfide bond), the preparation was treated with a fluorescent maleimide (Fig. 3). As expected, only the band corresponding to apoplastocyanin was found to react with the thiol reagent.Figure 3:Accessibility of the cysteinyl thiol in apo- versus holoplastocyanin to reaction with maleimidylphenyl methylcoumarin. Apo- and holoplastocyanin were treated with a thiol-reactive reagent, maleimidylphenyl methylcoumarin, for 60 min. Equivalent amounts of apo- and holoplastocyanin were analyzed as follows after separation by electrophoresis through a 15% polyacrylamide gel under either non-denaturing (A) or denaturing (B) conditions: under UV-illumination to detect the fluorescent reagent (lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8) or by staining with Coomassie Blue R-250 to detect protein (lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6). The arrows on the left point to apoplastocyanin (a), disulfide-linked dimer of apoplastocyanin (d), holoplastocyanin (h). The arrows and the numbers on the right indicate the size of the molecular weight markers separated on the SDS-containing denaturing gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Protease Susceptibility of Apoplastocyanin in VitroThe CD spectra, electrophoretic mobility (Figure 2:, Figure 3:), and increased immunoreactivity (Li and Merchant, 1992) of preparations of apoplastocyanin are all supportive of a different conformation of apoplastocyanin relative to holoplastocyanin. To test whether the apoprotein is indeed more susceptible to proteases compared to holoplastocyanin, equal amounts of apo- and holoplastocyanin were separately incubated with proteases, and the residual protein was analyzed by silver staining after electrophoretic separation on a non-denaturing gel (Fig. 4). Apoplastocyanin was found to be highly susceptible to digestion by either trypsin (not shown) or chymotrypsin (Fig. 4A) whereas holoplastocyanin was resistant for an extended period of time during an identical incubation. Conditions (high salt) which stabilize the folded conformation of apoplastocyanin (Koide et al., 1993) also inhibit degradation (Fig. 4B). The protease assays were highly reproducible; identical results were obtained when the experiment was repeated under the same conditions. These data suggest that the unfolded conformation is indeed more susceptible to proteolysis. Since the same results are obtained with trypsin, chymotrypsin, or (as yet uncharacterized) proteases found in extracts of chloroplasts (data not shown), it is unlikely that there is a single particularly susceptible site on the polypeptide.Figure 4:Protease susceptibility of apo- versus holoplastocyanin. 10 μg each of apo- or holoplastocyanin was incubated with 0.02 units of chymotrypsin in 100 mM Tricine (pH 8.0) in a total volume of 30 μl for the indicated amounts of time. The reaction was terminated by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to >100 μg/ml. Portions of the products (about 200 ng each lane) were loaded onto alternate lanes of a 12% polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions (Davis, 1964), which separates apo- and holoplastocyanin (Li and Merchant, 1992). The residual protein was visualized by staining with a silver reagent (Oakley et al., 1980). In panel B, 0.5 M (NH4)2SO4 was added to the samples before the incubation with protease. The arrows point to the positions of migration of apo- and holoplastocyanin. The products of digestion are probably too small (<15 amino acid residues) to be retained on the gel. In the absence of added protease, apoplastocyanin is not degraded.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It is not surprising that high salt (which stabilizes the native conformation) only delays rather than prevents degradation. If the kinetic barrier to unfolding is small and the two species (i.e. protease-resistant and protease-susceptible) are in equilibrium (see Koide et al., 1993), the degradation of one form would eventually lead to the degradation of the entire population of molecules. Thus, the fact that the apoprotein can adopt a native structure in the absence of the cofactor does not preclude its recognition as a non-native structure by a protease. The identity of the protease in vivo is not known, but"

Induction of ISG expression by virus appears to be mediated through production of viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Previously, we identified two novel dsRNA-activated factors (DRAFs) that bind to the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE), the DNA sequence that mediates transcriptional activation by IFN-α/β. In this report we define sequences that flank the classical ISRE to be necessary for DRAF1 binding. More significantly, it is shown that the sequences required to bind DRAF1 correlate with the ability to mediate ISG induction by virus. These results strongly suggest that DRAF1 is a positive regulator of ISG transcription. DRAF1 is shown to bind selectively to the promoters of those ISGs which are strongly induced by viral infection, again suggesting the functional significance of this factor. UV cross-linking experiments indicate that DRAF1 and DRAF2 share a common DNA-binding subunit of approximately 70 kDa which is referred to as the DRAF binding component (DRAFB). DRAFB is shown to preexist in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells. Consistent with this observation, both DRAF1 and DRAF2 are activated in the cytoplasm prior to nuclear translocation.

INTRODUCTIONA cell responds to viral infection with the transcriptional induction of specific genes that can function in the defense against the invading virus.

DeMaeyer-Guignard J. Interferons and Other Regulatory Cytokines. Wiley-Interscience, New York1988: 1-153Google Scholar)). Once synthesized, the IFN-α/β cytokines are secreted from the cell, bind to cell surface receptors, and function in an autocrine or paracrine manner to confer resistance to viral infection (reviewed in (2Staeheli P. Adv. Virus Res. 1990; 38: 147-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar)). The protective effects of IFNs-α/β are mediated through the activation of a specific set of genes known as interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) whose products function in cellular defense (reviewed in (1DeMaeyer E. DeMaeyer-Guignard J. Interferons and Other Regulatory Cytokines. Wiley-Interscience, New York1988: 1-153Google Scholar, 2Staeheli P. Adv.

It has now become clear that transcription of many of the ISGs is also directly activated during viral infection, independent of the synthesis or action of IFNs(5Bazzigher L. Pavlovic J. Haller O.

Berr P.M. Huez G.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The direct activation of the ISGs in response to viral infection allows cells to express the ISG-encoded proteins rapidly, before the synthesis, secretion, or action of IFNs. Such a response pathway may be critical to the survival of virally infected cells and an important component of the immune response against virus. In this study we examine the basis of direct activation of ISGs by viral infection and dsRNA, the apparent mediator of induction.ISGs induced by IFNs-α/β contain a promoter sequence known as the interferon-stimulated response element, or ISRE (reviewed in Refs. 3 and 4). Following IFN binding to its receptor, a multimeric transcription factor, the interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation in the cytoplasm of the cells and subsequently translocates to the nucleus to bind to the ISRE. Despite the potential significance of direct activation of the ISGs by viral infection, little has been characterized of this pathway at the molecular level. Preliminary experiments have suggested that a DNA sequence containing the ISRE can mediate a transcriptional response to virus(6Daly C. Reich N.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3756-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 11Wu C. Ohmori Y. Bandyopadhyay S. Sen G. Hamilton T. J. Interferon Res. 1994; 14: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, ISG induction by viral infection is independent of ISGF3 activation(6Daly C. Reich N.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3756-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, we have identified two novel nuclear factors rapidly induced by viral infection or dsRNA transfection that recognize an ISRE-containing DNA sequence (6Daly C. Reich N.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3756-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These factors have been termed dsRNA-activated factor 1 and 2 (DRAF1 and DRAF2).An important question concerns the DNA sequence transcriptionally responsive to viral infection or dsRNA. Experiments suggesting that the ISRE is sufficient to mediate the transcriptional response to virus have employed DNA elements that contain sequence flanking the classical ISRE(6Daly C. Reich N.C.

In addition, certain ISGs are induced weakly or undetectably by virus although they are strongly induced by IFNs-α/β(10Wathelet M.G. Berr P.M. Huez G.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This suggests that the DNA sequence which determines a strong transcriptional response to virus is different from the classical ISRE. In this report, we examine the functional significance of the DRAFs by determining more precisely the DNA sequence required to mediate viral induction of ISGs and correlating it with the ability of the induced DRAFs to bind to this sequence. It is demonstrated that the DNA sequence required to mediate a response to virus correlates with binding to DRAF1. This is the first strong evidence that DRAF1 is a positive activator of ISG transcription during infection. In addition, we provide a characterization of DRAF1 and DRAF2 that indicates that they share a common DNA-binding protein which preexists in the cytoplasm of untreated cells. DRAF activation is also demonstrated to initiate in the cytoplasm of the cell. Thus, this report forms the basis of understanding the nature of a DNA element and transcription factors which mediate the direct activation of ISGs during viral infection.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell CultureHEC-1B (ATCC HTB 113) and HeLa S3 cells (ATCC CCL2.2) were maintained as monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% calf serum.Viral InfectionsNewcastle disease virus (NDV) was a gift from Dr. Paula M. Pitha-Rowe (The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). HEC-1B cells were infected with NDV at 100 hemagglutination units per ml as follows: cells in 150-mm plates were washed with serum-free DMEM and then overlaid with 4 ml of serum-free DMEM containing the appropriate amount of virus. After 1 h, the medium was removed and the cells were fed with DMEM containing 5% calf serum.TransfectionsdsRNA transfections were performed as described(6Daly C. Reich N.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3756-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with DNA by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation technique(13Wigler M. Pellicer A. Silverstein S. Axel R. Urlaub G. Chasin L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1373-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). 24 h after transfection, cells were split into duplicate plates. Subsequently, one of the duplicate plates was infected with NDV and one was left untreated.The ISRE-TK and TK-109 plasmids have been described previously(14Reich N.C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3415-3424Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The ISRE-TK plasmid contains 3 copies of the ISRE (from −111 to −94 of the human ISG15 promoter) cloned into the −109 position of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene promoter. The dl ISG15-E1B plasmids contain various regions of the ISG15 promoter (−96, −108, or −115 to +44) fused to the 3′ region of the adenovirus E1B gene(15Reich N. Evans B. Levy D. Fahey D. Knight Jr., E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6394-6398Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The SVβ globin plasmid used to control for transfection efficiency has been described(16Costa R.H. Lai E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4697-4708Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).mRNA AnalysisCytoplasmic RNA was isolated from cells as described(6Daly C. Reich N.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3756-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The levels of specific mRNAs were determined by T2 RNase protection assay as described(14Reich N.C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3415-3424Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 15Reich N. Evans B. Levy D. Fahey D. Knight Jr., E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6394-6398Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The endogenous ISG15 probe was generated from a second exon PstI-EcoRI fragment. The γ-actin probe was generated from a human cDNA clone (17Enoch T. Zinn K. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar).Gel Mobility Shift AssayNuclear and cytoplasmic extracts used in gel shift assays were prepared as described(18Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9142) Google Scholar). The gel shift assay was performed as described(6Daly C. Reich N.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3756-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The gel shift probe was a double-stranded 27-mer corresponding to the sequence from −114 to −92 of the human ISG15 promoter: 5′-GATCGGGAAAGGGAAACCGAAACTGAA-3′. The exact sequences of all of the double-stranded oligonucleotides used as competitors in gel shift assays are provided in the figures in which they were used.Partial Purification of DRAF1 and DRAF2HEC-1B cells were treated with dsRNA for 1 h as described above, and nuclear extracts were prepared from the treated cells. Crude nuclear extract (~50 mg of protein) was loaded onto a 20-ml phosphocellulose P11 (Whatman Biosystems, United Kingdom) cation exchange column. Protein was eluted with increasing concentrations of KCl. Fractions containing DRAF1 and DRAF2 activity, as assayed by gel shift, were then applied to a 2-ml ISRE-Sepharose column. The ISRE-Sepharose column was prepared using CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B beads obtained from Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc. Protein was eluted with increasing concentrations of KCl, and fractions containing DRAF1 and DRAF2 activity were then determined by gel shift assay.UV Cross-linkingThe DNA probe used in UV cross-linking experiments was identical with the normal gel shift probe, except that one strand was substituted with 5-bromodeoxyuridine to increase the efficiency of cross-linking. Gel shift assays were performed with partially purified DRAF1, DRAF2, and DRAFB. Following electrophoresis, the entire gel was exposed to 254 nm UV irradiation for 5 min in a Stratagene UV Stratalinker 1800. The wet gel was then subjected to autoradiography at 4°C to allow visualization of the protein-ISRE complexes of interest. The appropriate complexes were excised from the gel, electroeluted directly into a 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and visualized by autoradiography.Glycerol Gradient Sedimentation AnalysisA fraction containing affinity-purified DRAFB (0.3 ml) was layered on top of an 11-ml glycerol gradient containing 25-40% glycerol, 0.1 M KCl, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.2 mM K-EDTA, 0.2 mM EGTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. A solution containing 50 μg each of 3 protein standards with known sedimentation coefficients (s) was layered on top of an identical gradient. The protein standards (Sigma) were: carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa; 2.8 S), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa; 4.2 S), and yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa; 7.5 S). The gradients were centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 45 h at 4°C. Fractions of 0.15 ml were collected from the top of each gradient. Fractions from the DRAFB gradient were assayed by gel shift to determine the position of DRAFB. The fractions from the protein standard gradient were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. The s value for DRAFB was estimated by construction of a standard curve plotting sversus distance traveled (fraction). The s value for DRAFB was used to estimate its molecular weight(19Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry. Vol. 2. W. H. Freeman, New York1980: 591-623Google Scholar).RESULTSViral Infection Activates ISG Expression through a DNA Sequence Containing the ISREWe have demonstrated previously that infection of HeLa cells with adenovirus can induce expression of a reporter gene driven by a DNA sequence containing the ISRE(6Daly C. Reich N.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3756-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In that experiment, the infection was performed in the presence of cycloheximide to prevent virally infected cells from synthesizing IFN-α/β. However, subsequent experiments suggested that even in the presence of cycloheximide, virally infected HeLa cells can synthesize enough IFN-α/β to induce detectable ISGF3 activation(6Daly C. Reich N.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3756-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was possible that some or all of the ISRE-dependent reporter gene expression observed in response to adenovirus infection of HeLa cells was due to the action of IFN-α/β and not directly to the adenovirus. In order to establish definitively that virus can activate transcription through the ISRE, independently of IFN-α/β action, it was necessary to use a cell line (HEC-1B) which is resistant to IFN-α/β. HEC-1B is a human endometrial carcinoma cell line which does not respond to IFN-α/β (5Bazzigher L. Pavlovic J. Haller O. Staeheli P. Virology. 1992; 186: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 9Wathelet M.G. Clauss I.M. Content J. Huez G.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 20Fuse A. Ashino-Fuse H. Kuwata T. Gann. 1984; 75: 379-384PubMed Google Scholar). HEC-1B cells were transfected with either a plasmid containing 3 copies of the ISG15 ISRE cloned into the promoter of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene (ISRE-TK) or a plasmid containing the TK promoter without the ISRE (TK-109) (Fig. 1A). The ISRE-TK plasmid has been used previously to demonstrate that the ISRE is sufficient to mediate a transcriptional response to IFN-α/β(14Reich N.C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3415-3424Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A plasmid encoding β-globin was cotransfected to control for transfection efficiency (16Costa R.H. Lai E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4697-4708Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Following transfection, cells were either untreated (lanes 2 and 4) or infected with Newcastle disease virus (NDV), an RNA virus that produces dsRNA during the course of infection (lanes 3 and 5). Cytoplasmic RNA was isolated from the cells, and the level of reporter gene (TK) expression was quantified. As a control, HEC-1B cells were treated with IFN-α to demonstrate the lack of response of these cells to IFNs (lane 1). NDV was chosen as an inducing agent for the transfected cultures since it is known to be a very efficient activator of ISG expression in HEC-1B cells(5Bazzigher L. Pavlovic J. Haller O. Staeheli P. Virology. 1992; 186: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 9Wathelet M.G. Clauss I.M. Content J. Huez G.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and an infection will introduce viral dsRNA into the maximum number of the cells in the transfected culture. In our studies, we have found that NDV infection primarily induces the appearance of DRAF1 and less notably DRAF2 (data not shown). NDV infection of the transfected cultures was found to strongly induce expression of the TK gene driven by the ISRE (lane 4), but it did not induce expression of the control TK gene without the ISRE (lane 2). The efficiency of the viral infection was equivalent in both cases, as judged by the induced expression of the endogenous ISG15 gene (lanes 2 and 4). This experiment conclusively demonstrates that a DNA sequence containing the ISRE can mediate gene expression in response to viral infection, and that the ISRE-dependent gene expression observed is not due to the action of IFN-α/β-induced ISGF3.The ISRE-TK plasmid used in Fig. 1A contains an ISRE oligonucleotide corresponding to positions −111 to −94 of the ISG15 promoter. Therefore, the sequence from −111 to −94 is sufficient to support a transcriptional response to virus. To define more precisely the region of the ISG15 promoter which is required to mediate a response to virus, three plasmids containing various regions of the ISG15 promoter were tested. These plasmids, called dl ISG15-E1B, contain from −96, −108, or −115 to +44 of the ISG15 gene linked to the adenovirus E1B gene as a reporter. These plasmids have been used previously to define the region of the ISG15 promoter required to mediate a transcriptional response to IFN-α/β(15Reich N. Evans B. Levy D. Fahey D. Knight Jr., E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6394-6398Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 17Enoch T. Zinn K. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Each of these plasmids was transfected into HEC-1B cells along with a plasmid encoding β-globin as a cotransfection control (Fig. 1B). Following transfection, cells were either left untreated (lanes 1, 3, and 5) or infected with NDV (lanes 2, 4, and 6). Cytoplasmic RNA was isolated from the cells, and the levels of reporter gene expression were quantified. As expected, the −96 plasmid, which does not contain the ISRE, did not mediate any induction of the ISG15-E1B reporter gene (lane 2). The −108 plasmid did respond to virus with a relatively weak (~2-fold, by densitometry) but reproducible induction of the reporter gene (lane 4). The −115 plasmid responded strongly to viral infection, with more than a 5-fold induction of reporter gene expression (lane 6). It should be noted that the actual induction is greater than it appears to be, since we have observed a general destabilization of mRNA following viral infection or dsRNA treatment (compare actin levels in lanes 2, 4, and 6 with those in lanes 1, 3, and 5). Thus, if reporter gene mRNA levels are normalized to actin levels, the viral induction is severalfold greater. The different responses mediated by the −108 and −115 plasmids is not due to a difference in the efficiency of viral infection, since the endogenous ISG15 gene was induced to similar levels in both cases (lanes 4 and 6). These results demonstrate that several nucleotides upstream of the consensus ISRE (−107 to −95) are required to mediate a maximal response to virus, although the ISRE alone (−108 plasmid) is able to mediate modest transcriptional activation.Binding of DRAF1 to the ISG15 Promoter Correlates with Transcriptional Activation by VirusCells respond to dsRNA transfection in the absence of new protein synthesis with the activation of two DNA-binding factors, DRAF1 and DRAF2, that recognize a sequence containing the ISRE (6Daly C. Reich N.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3756-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). DRAF1 migrates very slowly in the electrophoretic gel shift assay and appears just below the gel well suggesting that it is a large molecular complex. Although both the DRAFs and ISGF3 bind to an oligonucleotide containing the ISRE, the DRAFs do not contain any of the protein components of ISGF3 as measured by antibody cross-reactivity ((6Daly C. Reich N.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3756-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and data not shown).Figure 2:A, activation of DRAF1 and DRAF2 by dsRNA transfection. HEC-1B cells were untreated(-) or transfected with dsRNA (dsRNA). Nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed by gel mobility shift assay with a radiolabeled ISRE probe (−114/−92) derived from the human ISG15 gene promoter(15Reich N. Evans B. Levy D. Fahey D. Knight Jr., E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6394-6398Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). B, definition of the 5′ boundary of the DRAF1 and DRAF2 binding sites within the ISG15 promoter. Nuclear extract containing DRAF1 and DRAF2 from dsRNA-treated cells was used in a gel mobility shift assay with a radiolabeled ISRE probe (−114/−92 of ISG15). The DNA binding reactions were performed in the absence (lane 1) or presence (lanes 2-4) of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor DNAs. The sequences of the DNAs used as competitors are shown at the bottom. C, definition of the 3′ boundary of the DRAF1 and DRAF2 binding sites within the ISG15 promoter.

The sequences of the DNAs used as competitors are shown at the bottom.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Since the −115 and −108 plasmids demonstrated a measurable difference in inducibility by viral infection, we determined if efficient binding of DRAF1 and/or DRAF2 to these sequences correlated with gene expression. To define more precisely the 5′ boundary of the sequence required to bind DRAF1 and DRAF2, a competitive gel mobility shift assay was performed (Fig. 2B). The DNA binding reactions were performed with a radiolabeled ISG15 ISRE oligonucleotide (−114/−92) in the absence (lane 1) or presence (lanes 2-4) of a 100-fold molar excess of various unlabeled competitor DNAs. The competitor DNAs corresponded to −115/−94, −111/−94, or −108/−94 of the ISG15 promoter. The −115/−94 and −111/−94 DNAs competed efficiently for binding of both DRAF1 and DRAF2 (lanes 2 and 3). However, the −108/−94 DNA only competed efficiently for DRAF2 binding (lane 4). DRAF1 binding therefore requires a nucleotide(s) between −109 and −111, directly adjacent to the ISRE (AAA in the ISG15 promoter). Thus, the stronger induction of reporter gene expression observed for the −115 plasmid compared to that seen with the −108 plasmid (Fig. 1B) appears to be due to the ability of DRAF1 to bind much more efficiently to the −115 plasmid than to the −108 plasmid. This suggests that DRAF1 is the major positive transcriptional regulator, since DRAF1 binding to the ISG15 ISRE is tightly correlated with induced transcription of this gene during viral infection. The DNA binding specificity of DRAF1 is distinct from ISGF3 and suggests that DRAF1 activates a subset of ISGs(14Reich N.C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3415-3424Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).To define the 3′ boundary of the DRAF1 and DRAF2 binding sites within the ISG15 promoter, a similar DNA binding competition experiment was performed (Fig. 2C). Each DNA binding reaction contained radiolabeled ISRE probe in the absence (lane 1) or presence (lanes 2-4) of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor DNA. The competitor DNAs contained −111/−94 of the ISG15 ISRE or a deletion of nucleotides −98 and −97 (dl 98) or of nucleotides −96 to −94 (dl 96) as shown. As expected, the −111/−94 DNA competed efficiently for binding of DRAF1 and DRAF2 (lane 2). However, neither the dl 98 nor the dl 96 DNAs competed for DRAF1 or DRAF2 binding (lanes 3 and 4). Thus, binding of DRAF1 and DRAF2 requires the AAA nucleotides at −99 to −97 and the CTG sequence between −96 and −94. These residues are highly conserved among the ISREs of various ISGs.DRAF1 Binding to Various ISG Promoters Is Correlated with Potent Transcriptional Activation by VirusThe fact that DRAF1 and DRAF2 require slightly different sequences for efficient DNA binding suggested the possibility that these factors bind to distinct subsets of ISG promoters. Since efficient DRAF1 binding requires a nucleotide(s) upstream of the consensus ISRE (Fig. 2B), DRAF1 may bind selectively to ISG promoters, as these flanking nucleotides (AAA) are not strictly conserved. Since DRAF2 binds efficiently to an oligonucleotide containing just the consensus ISRE (Fig. 2B), DRAF2 may bind to the ISRE of most, if not all, ISGs. In order to test this, a gel mobility shift assay was performed using nuclear extract containing DRAF1 and DRAF2 activity (Fig. 3). The competitor DNAs contained the ISRE from the human ISG15(15Reich N. Evans B. Levy D. Fahey D. Knight Jr., E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this study, the transcription start sites and major DNA promoter elements controlling the expression of this gene have been characterized by structural and functional studies. Immediately upstream of the first untranslated exon of the gene are GC-rich sequences containing consensus binding sites for several transcription factors, including Sp1, EGR-1 and AP2. In vitro transcription studies and RNase protection analyses of mRNA isolated from human NT2/D1 teratocarcinoma cells reveal that two closely spaced transcription cap sites are located at a consensus initiator (Inr) element similar to that found in the terminal transferase gene. Transient transfection of mutant genes shows that removal of three bases of this initiator sequence reduces promoter activity by 98% in NT2/D1 cells. In vitro transcription studies and transient transfection of a series of 5′ deletion mutants of the ACHE promoter linked to a luciferase reporter show an Sp1 site at −71 to be essential for promoter activity. Purified Sp1 protein protects this site from DNase cleavage during in vitro footprinting experiments. A conserved AP2 consensus binding site, located between the GC box elements and the Inr, is protected by recombinant AP2 protein in DNase footprinting experiments, induces a mobility shift with AP2 protein and AP2-containing cell extracts, and fosters inhibition of transcription by AP2 as measured by transient transfection in mouse and human cell lines and in in vitro transcription reactions.

INTRODUCTIONA defining feature of neurotransmitter systems is the coordinated use of disparate molecular elements to achieve a specific functional goal. Cholinergic neurons exemplify this by utilizing nicotinic and muscarinic receptors and the enzymes choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholinesterase (AChE, 1The abbreviations used are: AChEacetylcholinesterasebpbase pair(s)PCRpolymerase chain reactionkbkilobase(s)EGRearly growth responseCMVcytomegalovirus. EC 3.1.1.7) to modulate the effects of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. AChE is a serine hydrolase that is located in a variety of tissue environments by linkage of diverse anchoring subunits or carboxyl-terminal sequences to the constant catalytic domain of the enzyme (reviewed in Massoulie et al., 1993; Taylor and Radic, 1994). In humans AChE activity is encoded by a single gene, ACHE, located within 6 kilobases of DNA sequence on chromosome 7q22 (Getman et al., 1992; Ehrlich et al., 1992). Multiple forms of AChE protein arise from alternative splicing of exons found at the 3′ end of the open reading frame (Li et al., 1991). The alternative splicing gives rise to carboxyl termini which differ in their capacity to disulfide bond with other catalytic and structural subunits or associate with the plasma membrane (cf. Massoulie et al., 1993; Taylor and Radic, 1994).The necessity for coordinated expression of each component of cholinergic neuronal systems for the maintenance of homeostasis is illustrated by the loss of receptor function and skeletal muscle tone in myasthenia gravis and the profound symptoms associated with AChE inhibition from organophosphate poisoning. Many components of cholinergic neural systems have not been investigated at the level of the gene, and the nature of regulatory mechanisms which foster coordinated expression of cholinergic macromolecules remains obscure.One approach useful for investigating gene structure and expression relies on interspecies comparison of a single genetic locus. The genomic structure, alternative RNA splicing, and amino acid sequence of genes encoding AChE have been investigated in a wide variety of species (Rachinsky et al., 1990; Li et al., 1991, 1993). Promoter elements controlling expression of AChE genes in mammalian cells have been identified and studied functionally in Torpedo (Ekström et al., 1993) and mouse muscle (Mutero et al., 1995). Partial sequences of the human ACHE 5′-flanking region have been reported (Ben Aziz-Aloya et al., 1993), but little is known about functional promoter elements or transcriptional regulation of ACHE in mammalian cells. We have cloned and characterized putative promoter sequences for the human ACHE gene and have determined the transcription initiation sites. From functional studies we find that GC-rich sequence elements containing consensus binding sites for Sp1 are essential for transcription of ACHE, while the transcription factor AP2 acts as a repressor of human ACHE and mouse Ache transcription in vitro.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell CultureHuman cell lines and the mouse fibroblast cell line C3H10T1/2 (10T1/2) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The human cholinergic teratocarcinoma subline NTera2/D1, SK-N-SH neuroblastoma, and embryonic kidney (HEK) lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g sucrose/liter and 10% fetal bovine serum. The human hepatocarcinoma cell line Hep-G2 was grown in Earl's minimal essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and non-essential amino acids. The myoblast cell line C3H10TFL2-3B (10TFL2-3), a clone of 10T1/2 cells that constitutively expresses myogenin (described previously in Brennan et al., 1991), was a generous gift of Dr. Eric Olson, The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX. The 10TFL2-3 cells were differentiated into myotubes by switching the culture medium to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% horse serum and 0.5% fetal bovine serum. All cells were grown at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.Library Screening and Construction of 5′-Flanking Region Deletion MutantsGenomic clones of the human ACHE gene were obtained by screening a pWE15 cosmid library (gift from Dr. Glen Evans, University of Texas, Dallas, TX) containing human placental genomic DNA. The library was screened from duplicate filter lifts with a 357-bp PCR fragment amplified from exon 2 of the human ACHE gene cDNA sequence (Soreq et al., 1990). The sequences of PCR primers were (5′) AACCGTGAGCTGAGCGAGGACT (HUX1-4) and (3′) CCAAACAGCGTCACTGATGTCG (HUX1-5). Taq polymerase (Perkin Elmer) and an Ericomp Thermal Cycler were used to amplify human genomic DNA in a 50-μl reaction using 10 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 64°C for 2 min, and 72°C for 2 min. This was followed by 25 cycles of 94°C for 1 min and 72°C for 2 min, and a final extension reaction at 72°C for 7 min. A 6-kb NotI DNA restriction fragment from cosmid clone 18D1-1 was subcloned into pSK II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Deletions of 5′-flanking DNA sequences were accomplished by both restriction digestion (constructions A and F) and PCR amplification (constructions B-E). The 5′ primers used to construct the latter four clones contained the following sequences: (B) CCGGGAGAGCGGGGAGG; (C) CAGTGGGCGGGGGCGGG; (D) CGGGCGGGGGCGCTGTG; and (E) CGGCTGTCAGAGTCGGCTC. All amplifications used the same 3′ primer (CGTCCTGGGCCTCGGAGG) located 90 bp downstream of the KpnI site in the intronic region between exons one and two and were achieved by using five cycles at 94°C for 30 s, 57°C for 4 min, followed by 25 cycles of 97°C for 30 s, 59°C for 4 min, and a final extension reaction at 59°C for 7 min. After band isolation and end polishing with Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, the PCR products were digested with KpnI and cloned into SmaI and KpnI sites in pSK II Bluescript. Plasmid inserts were then removed by digestion with BamHI and KpnI and ligated into the luciferase reporter vector pXP1 (a generous gift of Dr. Steven Nordeen, University of Colorado) containing human ACHE gene sequences consisting of 1-2 intron DNA from the KpnI site to an NlaIII site 16 bases downstream of the 5′ splice junction of exon 2. Clones A and F were constructed by digesting the 6-kb NotI fragment with KpnI and SacI or Bsu36I, respectively, and ligating to the same KpnI-NlaIII fragment in pXP1. The integrity of ligation junctions was confirmed by sequencing. The mouse Ache promoter fragments were obtained from genomic clones described previously (Li et al., 1993).SequencingDNA sequencing employed the dideoxy method (Sanger et al., 1977) using fragments cloned into both M13 and pBluescript SKII+ phagemid vectors as templates and primed with sequence-specific oligonucleotides. The immediate promoter region is especially GC-rich, and to obtain consistent sequences in both the 3′ and 5′ directions required the use of Taq polymerase at 70°, Gene 32 protein, and deaza dGTP to prevent formation of secondary structure.Cell Transfection, Luciferase, and AChE AssaysCells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method as described previously (Ekström et al., 1993). Transfection reactions contained a total of 25 μg of DNA/10-cm plate, consisting of the reporter plasmid and 5 μg of pCMV/β-Gal for normalization of transfection efficiencies. DNA precipitates were incubated with cell cultures overnight in serum-containing medium in a 3% CO2 atmosphere. After transfection, cells were incubated in fresh medium for an additional 24 h, followed by lysis of harvested cells by sonication. Luciferase activity in cell lysates was determined by autoinjecting 30 μl of lysate containing 70 μM luciferin (Analytical Luminescence, La Jolla, CA) and 0.25 mM ATP in a Turner Design luminometer. AChE enzyme activity was determined by the method of Ellman et al.(1961).Electrophoretic Mobility Shift AssaysNuclear extracts were prepared as described (Schreiber et al., 1989). Protein concentrations in the extracts were estimated using BCA reagent (Pierce). For AP2, double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the intact or mutated AP2 site and associated flanking sequences corresponded to the following sequences: 5′-TGCGGGGGGCCGGAGGCGGCTGTCA-3′; and 5′-TGCGGGGGACAGGAAGTGGCTGTCA-3′. These fragments were labeled with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I in the presence of [32P]dCTP. Oligonucleotides containing the mutated (m) and wild-type (wt) AP2 consensus sequence of the mouse Ache promoter were used as unlabeled competing oligonucleotide. The wt competing oligonucleotide contained the sequence 5′-GATCGAACTGACCGCCGGAGGCCCGT-3′. Recombinant AP2 protein was from Promega. AP2 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Mobility shift reactions contained 5 μg of nuclear extract protein, antibodies, or unlabeled competing oligonucleotides, 5 μg of bovine serum albumin, 4 μg of poly(dI-dC) in 12% glycerol, 12 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mM KCl. After a 10-min incubation on ice, 20,000 counts/min of the 32P-radiolabeled probe was added. The mixture was then incubated for 15 min on ice. The complexes were resolved from free DNA on 6% polyacrylamide gel in 1 × TGE buffer (Tris-glycine-EDTA, pH 8.5) at 4°C.In Vitro Transcription and RNase ProtectionIn vitro transcription was performed as described previously (Dignam et al., 1983), using DNA fragments containing varying lengths of sequence upstream of exon 1 of the ACHE gene and extending down to the KpnI site in the 1-2 intron. RNase protection experiments were conducted by cloning fragments from the ACHE genomic cosmid clone 18D1-1 in pBluescript SKII+. Antisense cRNA probes were made with these templates by in vitro transcription essentially as described by Ausubel et al.(1987). RNase digestions contained 25,000 units/ml RNase A, 225,000 units/ml RNase T1, and 50 μg of total RNA.Site-specific MutagenesisA 493-bp fragment extending from 113 bases upstream of the 3′ cap site to the KpnI site in the 1-2 intron was mutated (Kunkel et al., 1987) after single strand rescue of the insert, contained in pSK Bluescript II-, with helper phage VCSM13, then inserted into the ACHE-luciferase reporter construct. The sequence of the mutant sense oligonucleotide was GTGTGCGGGGGACAGGAAGTGGCGGCTGTCA. The mutated region in the AP2 site and the integrity of the entire DNA insert were ascertained by DNA sequencing.DNase FootprintingFootprinting experiments were performed as described previously (Jones et al., 1985). Purified recombinant AP2 and Sp1 proteins were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). Transcription factors were incubated with end-labeled DNA probes for 30 min at 0°C. DNase I digestions were conducted at room temperature for 45-60 s.RESULTSIsolation of ACHE Genomic Clones and Characterization of 5′-Flanking RegionTo identify regulatory elements of ACHE, a human genomic cosmid library was screened with a DNA fragment amplified by PCR from human genomic DNA obtained from a blood sample from one of the authors. This fragment corresponded to 357 bp of exon 2, the first translated exon of both the human ACHE and mouse Ache genes (Li et al., 1991). Using this fragment as probe, eight distinct cosmid clones were obtained, with inserts averaging 30 Kb in size. To locate potential regulatory regions of ACHE, restriction digests of cosmid inserts were Southern blotted and probed with mouse Ache cDNA clones representing upstream regions of the gene (Li et al., 1991). Cross-hybridization revealed a region of similarity between the two species that is located 1-2 kb upstream of exon 2 (data not shown). Sequence analysis of 2.6 kb of human genomic DNA upstream of the 5′ end of exon 2 of ACHE revealed a short region of DNA with 91% sequence identity to a 216 bp portion of the 5′ termini of mouse cDNA clones (Li et al., 1993) (Fig. 1). Like genomic mouse Ache clones, this region is approximately 1.5 kb upstream of exon 2. Part of this human sequence corresponds to exon 1 in the mouse gene, an untranslated sequence that splices to the open reading frame of Ache that begins in exon 2 (Li et al., 1993). Substantial sequence identity between mouse and human genes was also noted upstream of exon 1, encompassing what has previously been defined as a promoter for mouse Ache expression (Li et al., 1993). This putative human promoter region contains a preponderance of G and C bases, lacks a TATA box, and contains four consensus binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1 and three sites corresponding to the early growth response (EGR-1) transcription factor (Wang et al., 1993). Also present are two consensus binding sites for the transcription factor AP2 (Williams et al., 1991) and a consensus binding site for NF-κB (Kunsch et al., 1992) in the intronic region 21 bp downstream of the conserved RNA splice donor site corresponding to the 3′ junction of exon 1 in mouse Ache.Assessment of Promoter Activity of 5′-Flanking Regions of the ACHE GenePotential promoter activities of ACHE gene fragments were ascertained by constructing fusion genes of the 5′-flanking region of ACHE linked to luciferase as a reporter. A 2.6-kb ACHE genomic DNA fragment was subcloned into the luciferase reporter vector pXP1. This fragment consisted of approximately 1.1 kb of DNA sequence upstream of the region similar to mouse Ache exon 1, exon 1, and 1.5 kb of the putative intronic region between sequences corresponding to exons 1 and 2 in Ache. The 3′ end of this and all subsequent promoter fragments constructed includes the first 16 bases of exon 2 upstream of the ATG start codon to ensure that the RNA splice acceptor site at the 5′ end of exon 2 facilitates proper splicing of exon 1 sequences to the luciferase open reading frame. Transient transfection of this construct, denoted A, into various established human cell lines revealed substantial promoter activity when luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity (Table 1). The magnitude of this promoter activity correlated roughly with the amount of AChE enzymatic activity expressed by the cell lines. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) and human hepatocarcinoma Hep-G2 cell lines fostered the lowest promoter activity of construction A; AChE enzyme activity was not detected in these cell lines. When construction A was transfected into the human cell line NTera2/D1, an AChE-expressing cholinergic subline of the teratocarcinoma cell line NTera 2 (NT2), luciferase activity was 8-13-fold higher than HEK and Hep-G2.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Since the NT2/D1 cells displayed greater AChE enzyme activity and promoter activity of ACHE upstream sequences relative to other human cell lines, this cell line was chosen for defining the location of the promoter region of the ACHE gene. Given the sequence similarity between the human and mouse genes upstream of exon 1, and the known promoter activity of the mouse Ache gene in this region (Li et al., 1993), we constructed 5′ deletion mutants by PCR amplification of construction A to analyze the promoter potential of this region. The locations of the upstream primers used for amplification of constructions B through E were chosen so that the Sp1 consensus sites in the putative promoter region upstream of exon 1 would be sequentially deleted (Fig. 2). An additional 5′ deletion mutant (construction F) was prepared by restriction digestion of construction A with Bsu36I. This resulted in the removal of the GC-rich region and most of the sequence similar to mouse exon 1. Transient transfection of constructions A through F in NT2/D1 cells revealed no significant difference in promoter activity between constructions A, B, and C. However, construction D was almost 5-fold lower in promoter activity than A and B, suggesting that the second upstream Sp1 consensus sequence (Fig. 1) is essential for activated transcription of ACHE.Figure 2:Promoter activity of ACHE-luciferase (Lucif) gene chimeras transiently transfected into NT2/D1 teratocarcinoma cells. Transfection efficiencies were normalized by co-transfection with the lacZ gene driven by the CMV early promoter. Data represent the means and standard errors of three separate experiments, each performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Mapping of the Transcription Start SitesPrevious studies have revealed that transcription of endogenous Ache in mouse erythroleukemia and myoblast cell lines is characterized by the use of multiple transcription start sites (Li et al., 1993) (cf.Fig. 1). Attempts at determining the transcription start sites of human ACHE by primer extension from sequence-specific primers in exon 2 yielded DNA products which lacked the clear definition of cap sites seen in mouse. To define the cap site and regulatory elements, in vitro transcription experiments were conducted using HeLa cell nuclear extract and linear DNA templates with 5′ termini corresponding to constructions B through E. To obtain RNA transcripts that were of sufficient size for analysis by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, constructions B-E were cut with KpnI, yielding templates (B‘-E‘) that were 495-410 bp in size (Fig. 3). These templates were expected to yield RNA transcripts that were 380-395 bases long if human ACHE utilized the same cap sites as mouse Ache. Transcription in vitro with these reagents revealed that a RNA transcript approximately 385 bases long was produced in equal amounts by both constructions B‘ and C‘. Constructions D‘ and E‘ were totally inactive in these assays (Fig. 3, A and B). Hence, the 12 bp which comprise the difference between C‘ and D‘ are essential for transcription of ACHE in HeLa nuclear extracts. Loss of this region, which contains the second upstream Sp1 site, abolishes transcription completely. These data agree with the transient transfection experiments with constructs B through E, which showed this Sp1 consensus sequence to be important for promoter activity in NT2/D1 cells (cf. Fig. 2).Figure 3:In vitro transcription of ACHE gene 5′-flanking fragments in HeLa cell nuclear extracts. A, representative autoradiograph of one in vitro transcription experiment. B, map of DNA templates used for in vitro transcription experiments. ACHE mRNA levels were normalized to a transcript produced from a DNA fragment containing the CMV promoter included in each reaction. Data represent the means and standard deviations of three separate in vitro transcription experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The size of the RNA transcript produced in these in vitro transcription reactions suggested that, unlike mouse Ache RNA transcripts isolated from myoblast and erythroleukemia cell lines, a dominant transcription start site is used by human ACHE. The approximate location of this cap site corresponds to the most 3′ site used by mouse Ache and coincides with a consensus DNA sequence for an initiator (Inr) element similar to one found in the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase gene promoter (Smale et al., 1990). To confirm the location of the mRNA cap site used by ACHE, RNase protection analysis was performed with RNA isolated from NT2/D1 cells. A 750-bp antisense cRNA probe was generated by transcribing a human DNA fragment containing sequences corresponding to exon 1. This probe was then used to protect NT2/D1 total cellular RNA. Two closely spaced bands, 73 and 76 bases in length, were protected from digestion (Fig. 4A). The size of these bands is consistent with RNA transcripts resulting from the use of two different cap sites at the 5′ end of exon 1. Similar to the ACHE in vitro transcription product seen in Fig. 3A, the 5′ end of these two bands coincides with the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase Inr element consensus site present at the 5′ end of exon 1. However, the in vitro transcription assays revealed only one band, suggesting a single cap site was used in the HeLa cell nuclear extract environment. To resolve this apparent discrepancy, ACHE RNA products from in vitro transcription reactions with HeLa cell nuclear extract were electrophoresed on a higher percentage polyacrylamide gel. Under these conditions, the band representing the ACHE-specific transcript resolved into two bands as well (Fig. 4B). Thus evidence from experiments using distinct methodologies and two different human cell lines indicates that two mRNA cap sites are present at the 5′ end of exon 1 in ACHE and that these sites reside within a consensus sequence for an initiator element (Fig. 4C).Figure 4:Determination of transcription start sites of ACHE.

C, location of cap sites at the consensus Inr element of human ACHE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In order to ascertain the importance of the initiator element consensus site in ACHE transcription, three bases within this site were deleted by digesting construction B with Bpu1102I, blunting the ends with S1 nuclease, and ligating the ends. This resulted in the removal of three bases, TCA, in the putative Inr sequence GGCTCAGCC, yielding the Inr element deletion mutant BΔ3. Insertion of this mutant Inr construction, which was otherwise identical to construction B, into the luciferase reporter vector and transfection into NT2/D1 cells revealed that these three bases are essential for promoter activity. The BΔ3 construction displayed less than 2% of the promoter activity compared to the wild-type construction B (Table 2). This result is in accord with the RNase protection data described above which tentatively placed the two mRNA cap sites for ACHE at base 3 (C) and base 6 (A) of this putative Inr element.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Repression of ACHE Expression by AP2AP2 binds to DNA as a homodimer, with an aggregate molecular mass of 104 kDa (Williams et al., 1991). Promoters which have been reported to be activated by AP2 contain consensus binding sites for the factor several hundred bp upstream of core promoter elements (Haslinger and Karin, 1985; Lee et al., 1987). The presence of two AP2 consensus binding sites between essential GC box elements and the transcription cap sites in the ACHE promoter (cf. Fig. 1) suggested that AP2 might influence expression of the gene by interfering with activated or basal transcription. To assess the effect of AP2 on ACHE transcription, construction B was co-transfected into NT2/D1 cells with an expression vector containing a cDNA encoding the open reading frame for wild-type AP2. Transient transfection experiments showed that AP2 has an inhibitory effect on ACHE promoter activity when normalized against β-galactosidase. When the AP2 site proximal to exon 1 was deleted by site-directed mutagenesis (construction BmtAP2), the repressive effect of AP2 was abolished (Table 2).To examine the possibility that increased levels of AP2 protein expressed in the transfected cells were repressing ACHE promoter function by competition with endogenous transcription factors (squelching), an amino-terminal deletion mutant of the AP2 open reading frame was cotransfected into untreated NT2/D1 cells with construction B. This AP2 mutant, ΔN165AP2, lacks the transcriptional activation domain of the wild-type factor but retains the dimerization and DNA-binding domains. ΔN165AP2 can therefore still homodimerize and bind to DNA but is unable to form protein-protein interactions with other members of the RNA polymerase transcription complex (Williams et al., 1991). Similar to wild-type AP2, co-transfection of ΔN165AP2 decreases ACHE promoter activity approximately 6-fold (Table 2). These data suggest AP2 specifically represses ACHE transcription by sterically interfering either with the function of the transcription complex at the cap sites 19 bp downstream, or with the binding of Sp1 transcription factors 21 bp upstream.To assess the universal nature and functional significance of AP2-mediated repression of AChE gene expression, two mouse cell lines that express AP2 were used to test the effect of this transcription factor on a DNA fragment containing the mouse Ache promoter. RNase protection experiments revealed that fibroblast cell line 10T1/2 and myoblast cell line 10TFL2-3 (a 10T1/2-derived line with transfected myogenin stably integrated into its genome) contain mRNA for AP2, indicating the factor is expressed in these cell lines (data not shown). Transient transfection of 10T1/2 and 10TFL2-3 cells with Ache promoter-luciferase reporter constructions containing either a native or mutated AP2-binding site showed that the reporter gene containing a mutated AP2 site exhibited 5-fold higher promoter activity than the wild-type promoter (Table 2). Thus mouse cell lines which express AP2 are able to repress mouse Ache expression in a manner similar to the repression of human ACHE transcription in recombinant AP2 co-transfection experiments in human NT2/D1 cells.Induction of Gel Mobility Shifts by AP2-containing Nuclear ExtractsTo confirm the specificity of endogenous AP2 activity interacting with the AP2-binding site of the mouse Ache promoter, nuclear extracts prepared from 10T1/2 fibroblasts and differentiated 10TFL2-3 myotube cells were used in band shift experiments containing end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the conserved AP2 element in the mouse Ache promoter region. Fig. 5shows that nuclear extract from 10T1/2 cells induces a mobility shift of the wild-type AP2 oligonucl"

Both responses were markedly, but the former response to a phorbol ester was not at all, inhibited when the cellular cAMP level was raised by prostaglandin E1 combined with a cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Increasing cAMP was also inhibitory to fMLP-induced activation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and Ca2+ influx without any effect on the cation mobilization from intracellular stores. The fMLP-induced respiratory burst was abolished when PI 3-kinase was inhibited by wortmannin or LY294002, but was not affected when Ca2+ influx was inhibited. On the contrary, fMLP released arachidonic acid from the cells treated with the PI 3-kinase inhibitors as well as from nontreated cells, but it did not so when cellular Ca2+ uptake was prevented. The chemotactic peptide activated PI 3-kinase even in cells in which the receptor-mediated intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and respiratory burst were both abolished by exposure of the cells to a permeable Ca2+-chelating agent.

https://openalex.org/W2056106327,"The mechanism for the regulation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I (CaM kinase I) was investigated using a series of COOH-terminal truncated mutants. These mutants were expressed in bacteria as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase and purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione Sepharose 4B. A mutant (residues 1-332) showed complete Ca2+/CaM-dependent activity. Truncation mutants (residues 1-321, 1-314, and 1-309) exhibited decreasing affinities for Ca2+/CaM and also exhibited decreasing Ca2+/CaM-dependent activities. Truncation mutants (residues 1-305 or 1-299) were unable to bind Ca2+/CaM and were inactive. In contrast, truncation mutants (residues 1-293 or 1-277) were constitutively active at a slightly higher level (2-fold) than fully active CaM kinase I. These results indicate the location of the Ca2+/CaM-binding domain on CaM kinase I (residues 294-321) and predict the existence of an autoinhibitory domain near, or overlapping, the Ca2+/CaM-binding domain. These conclusions were supported by studies which showed that a synthetic peptide (CaM kinase I(294-321)) corresponding to residues 294-321 of CaM kinase I inhibited the fully active kinase in a manner that was competitive with Ca2+/CaM and also inhibited the constitutively active mutant (residues 1-293) in a manner that was competitive with Syntide-2, a peptide substrate, (Ki = 1.2 μM) but was non-competitive with ATP. Thus, these results suggest that CaM kinase I is regulated through an intrasteric mechanism common to other members of the family of Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinases. The mechanism for the regulation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I (CaM kinase I) was investigated using a series of COOH-terminal truncated mutants. These mutants were expressed in bacteria as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase and purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione Sepharose 4B. A mutant (residues 1-332) showed complete Ca2+/CaM-dependent activity. Truncation mutants (residues 1-321, 1-314, and 1-309) exhibited decreasing affinities for Ca2+/CaM and also exhibited decreasing Ca2+/CaM-dependent activities. Truncation mutants (residues 1-305 or 1-299) were unable to bind Ca2+/CaM and were inactive. In contrast, truncation mutants (residues 1-293 or 1-277) were constitutively active at a slightly higher level (2-fold) than fully active CaM kinase I. These results indicate the location of the Ca2+/CaM-binding domain on CaM kinase I (residues 294-321) and predict the existence of an autoinhibitory domain near, or overlapping, the Ca2+/CaM-binding domain. These conclusions were supported by studies which showed that a synthetic peptide (CaM kinase I(294-321)) corresponding to residues 294-321 of CaM kinase I inhibited the fully active kinase in a manner that was competitive with Ca2+/CaM and also inhibited the constitutively active mutant (residues 1-293) in a manner that was competitive with Syntide-2, a peptide substrate, (Ki = 1.2 μM) but was non-competitive with ATP.

To further define the DNA sequences required for GLUT4 expression, we generated transgenic mice carrying 1975, 1639, 1154, 730, and 412 bp of the GLUT4 5′-flank (hG4) fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene. The 1975-hG4-CAT, 1639-hG4-CAT, and 1154-hG4-CAT constructs were expressed in a tissue-specific manner identical to the endogenous murine GLUT4 mRNA. Regulation of these reporter gene constructs in insulin-deficient diabetes also paralleled the endogenous gene. In contrast, 730-hG4-CAT was expressed at high levels only in skeletal muscle and at low levels in all of the other tissues examined. Additionally, expression of 412-hG4-CAT was completely unrestricted. Neither the 730-hG4-CAT nor the 412-hG4-CAT reporter genes displayed any insulin-dependent regulation.

https://openalex.org/W1969508095,"Integrin receptors can mediate transmembrane signaling in response to ligand binding. To further examine the role of the integrin α subunit in these signaling functions, we assessed the contribution of the α6 cytoplasmic domain variants to the signaling properties of the α6β1 integrin using P388D1 cells that had been transfected with either the α6A or the α6B cDNA. The α6Aβ1 and α6Bβ1 receptors induced marked quantitative differences in the tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins after binding to laminin. Specifically, the α6A cytoplasmic domain was more effective than the α6B cytoplasmic domain in inducing the tyrosine phosphorylation of three major proteins (molecular mass, 120, 110, and 76 kDa). In addition to these proteins, we also observed that the tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoskeletal protein paxillin was increased significantly more by α6Aβ1 integrin-mediated adhesion to laminin than by that of α6Bβ1. This differential pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation induction does not appear to be a secondary event initiated by cell shape changes. Also, differences in tyrosine phosphorylation in the α6 transfectants were not evident in response to attachment to other substrates. These findings provide biochemical evidence for functional differences between α subunit cytoplasmic domain variants of the same integrin.

These findings provide biochemical evidence for functional differences between α subunit cytoplasmic domain variants of the same integrin. The ability of integrins to function as transmembrane signaling receptors has been well-established (reviewed in (1Hynes R.O.

Haskill S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar)). This function is based on the findings that integrin-mediated adhesion of cells to extracellular matrix ligands or clustering of integrins with antibodies increases the tyrosine phosphorylation of cytoplasmic proteins and alters intracellular pH, [Ca2+]i, and gene expression(1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8941) Google Scholar, 2Schwartz M.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 2: 304-308Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 3Juliano R.L. Haskill S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar). Although integrin cytoplasmic domains do not contain intrinsic kinase motifs(4Sastry S. Horwitz A.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 819-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), it is assumed that these domains associate either directly or indirectly with other proteins to affect signaling functions. In this connection, a role for β subunit cytoplasmic domains in the activation of tyrosine kinase signaling has been reported. Specifically, chimeric proteins containing the β1, β3, and β5 cytoplasmic domains induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125Fak when clustered with antibodies(5Akiyama S.K Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. LaFlamme S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15961-15964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Lukashev M.E. Sheppard D. Pytela R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18311-18314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of some but not all β1 integrin heterodimers to induce pp125Fak tyrosine phosphorylation after antibody clustering suggests that the α subunit can influence the signaling capabilities of the β subunit cytoplasmic domain(7Kornberg L.J.

However, there are no data at present that focus specifically on the role of the α subunit cytoplasmic domain in the regulation of integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation. In this study, we addressed the question of whether the cytoplasmic domain of the α6 subunit contributes to tyrosine kinase-mediated signaling by the α6β1 integrin. This possibility was supported by our previous functional data that demonstrated that the α6Aβ1 and α6Bβ1 integrin receptors, which are identical except for the sequence of the α6 cytoplasmic domain(8Hogervorst F. Kuikman I. Geurts van Kessel A. Sonnenberg A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 9Tamura R.N. Cooper H.M. Collo G. Quaranta V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Cells transfected with the α6A subunit extended numerous pseudopodia and were more motile on EHS laminin than cells transfected with the α6B subunit(10Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that these differences could be attributed to differential activation of signaling pathways by these receptor variants. We report here that the α6Aβ1 and α6Bβ1 receptors induce marked quantitative differences in the tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins after binding to EHS laminin. Specifically, the α6A cytoplasmic domain was much more effective in inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of specific proteins than the α6B cytoplasmic domain. One of these proteins has been identified as the cytoskeletal protein paxillin(11Turner C.E. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Our findings are significant because they are the first to attribute differences in the regulation of integrin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation to α subunit cytoplasmic domain variants. Englebreth-Holm-Swarm phosphate-buffered saline fluorescence-activated cell sorting polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis monoclonal antibody. The P388D1 mouse macrophage cell line was obtained from the American Type Tissue Collection (Rockville, MD). Cells were transfected with either the human α6A or α6B cDNAs as described previously(12Shaw L.M. Lotz M.M. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11401-11408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in RPMI containing 25 mM Hepes, 15% certified fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 300 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfected cells expressing equivalent levels of α6 surface expression were obtained by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using the α6 specific antibody, 2B7(12Shaw L.M. Lotz M.M. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11401-11408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tissue culture plates (60 mm; Costar) were coated overnight with 4 ml of PBS containing murine EHS laminin (30 μg/ml). EHS laminin was purified from the Englebreth-Holm-Swarm sarcoma as described elsewhere(13Kleinman H.K. McGarvey M.L. Liotta L.A. Robey P.G. Tryggvason K. Martin G.R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6188-6193Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). Plates were washed three times with PBS before the addition of cells to remove nonadsorbed laminin. P388D1 cells were removed from tissue culture plates by scraping and maintained in suspension for 30 min at room temperature in either RPMI culture medium containing 25 mM Hepes or Puck's saline A containing 25 mM Hepes and 500 μM MnCl2. After this incubation, the cells were either maintained in suspension or added to either EHS laminin-coated or uncoated tissue culture plastic plates and allowed to adhere for 30 min at 37°C. The plates were then washed two times with RPMI to remove nonadherent cells. After washing, the cells were solubilized at 4°C for 15 min in a 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 M NaCl, 0.1% NaN3, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1 M sodium orthovanadate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin and pepstatin, and 50 μg/ml leupeptin. Nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The protein concentration of the cell extracts was determined using the Bio-Rad microprotein assay. Cell extracts were normalized for protein concentration, and aliquots containing 60-200 μg of protein were incubated overnight at 4°C with the paxillin-specific monoclonal antibody 165(14Turner C.E. Glenney J.R. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Immune complexes were recovered with a goat anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated to agarose beads (Sigma). The agarose beads were added for 1 h at 4°C with constant agitation. The beads were washed two times with a 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.15 M NaCl, and 0.1 M sodium orthovanadate, two times with the same buffer containing 0.5 M NaCl, and one time with 0.05 M Tris, pH 6.8 containing 0.1 M sodium orthovanadate. Laemmli sample buffer containing 5%β-mercaptoethanol and 0.1 M sodium orthovanadate was added to the samples, which were then incubated for 4 min at 100°C. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE (8%) and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. In addition, aliquots of total cell extracts (5-10 μg of protein) from each condition were resolved in a similar manner. To analyze the phosphotyrosine content of the immunoprecipitates, the nitrocellulose filters were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in PBS containing 3% (w/v) Carnation dry milk. The filters were then incubated for 90 min at room temperature in the same buffer containing the phosphotyrosine-specific monoclonal antibody, 4G10 (1 μg/ml; Upstate Biotechnology Incorporated, Lake Placid, NY). The filters were washed three times for 10 min in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST). The filters were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature in PBST containing 3% (w/v) Carnation dry milk and an anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (0.2 μg/ml; Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Inc.). After four 10-min washes in PBST, protein was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). For immunoblot analysis of total paxillin, filters were blocked for either 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4°C in a 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 M NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) and 5% (w/v) Carnation milk. The filters were then incubated for 2 h at room temperature in the same buffer containing the monoclonal antibody 165 (1:20 culture supernatant). After three 10-min washes in TBST, the filters were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in this buffer containing 5% Carnation milk and a goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (0.5 μg/ml; Kirkegaard and Perry). The filters were washed as before and proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). The α6 integrin subunit exists as two structural variants, α6A and α6B, that differ only in the sequence of their cytoplasmic domains(8Hogervorst F. Kuikman I. Geurts van Kessel A. Sonnenberg A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 9Tamura R.N. Cooper H.M. Collo G. Quaranta V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10183-10187Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Expression of these structural variants can differentially influence the behavior of P388D1 cells upon α6β1-mediated adhesion to an EHS laminin substratum(10Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this report, we investigated the possibility that the α6Aβ1 and α6Bβ1 receptors induce either qualitative or quantitative differences in tyrosine phosphorylation in response to laminin attachment and that such differences contribute to the distinct functional properties of these receptors. To compare the ability of the α6Aβ1 and α6Bβ1 integrin receptors to activate tyrosine kinase signaling pathways subsequent to ligand binding, we used P388D1 cells, an α6-deficient mouse macrophage cell line, that had been transfected with either the human α6A or α6B cDNAs(12Shaw L.M. Lotz M.M. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11401-11408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Populations of transfected cells that expressed equivalent levels of α6β1 on the cell surface were obtained by FACS. Expression levels were examined frequently by flow cytometry, and only cells that had comparable levels of surface expression were used for experiments (Fig. 1). The transfected cells were either maintained in suspension or allowed to adhere for 30 min to an EHS laminin substratum. Cell extracts containing equivalent amounts of total protein were analyzed for their phosphotyrosine content by immunoblotting with the phosphotyrosine-specific mAb 4G10. As shown in Fig. 2A, identical patterns of basal phosphorylation were observed for the α6A-P388D1 and α6B-P388D1 cells when they were maintained in suspension. Interestingly, after adhesion of these cells to an EHS laminin substratum, the phosphotyrosine content of proteins of approximately 120, 110, and 76 kDa increased markedly more in the α6A-P388D1 cells than in the α6B-P388D1 cells (Fig. 2A). These quantitative differences in tyrosine phosphorylation were α6β1-specific because similar patterns of tyrosine phosphorylation were obtained in the α6A-P388D1 and α6B-P388D1 cells after adhesion to tissue culture plastic (Fig. 2B). To investigate further the differences in the tyrosine kinase signaling pathways that are activated by the α6Aβ1 and α6Bβ1 integrins, we sought to identify other proteins that are phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to EHS laminin attachment. The cytoskeletal protein paxillin is phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to extracellular matrix adhesion and by growth factor stimulation in many cell types(15Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H.

Moreover, paxillin phosphorylation has been correlated with cell spreading(16Graham I.L. Anderson D.C. Holers V.M. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In light of the fact that the α6A-P388D1 and α6B-P388D1 transfectants adhere to EHS laminin to the same extent but exhibit differences in their morphology(10Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that this difference in cell “spreading” might be a result of differential tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin by the α6Aβ1 and α6Bβ1 receptors. This possibility was also supported by the presence of a diffuse band in the phosphotyrosine blot of total cellular protein (Fig. 2A) that approximated the size of paxillin (molecular mass, 68 kDa). To examine this possibility, aliquots of cell extracts containing equivalent amounts of total protein were immunoprecipitated with the paxillin-specific monoclonal antibody 165 (14Turner C.E. Glenney J.R. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar) and then immunoblotted with 4G10. Very little tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin was detected when the cells were maintained in suspension (Fig. 3A). However, there was a substantial increase in the phosphorylation of paxillin on tyrosine residues when the α6A-P388D1 transfectants adhered to an EHS laminin substratum. In contrast, the increase in paxillin phosphorylation observed for the α6Bβ1 cells was considerably less than that seen in the α6Aβ1 cells. Aliquots of total protein were also immunoblotted with the paxillin-specific antibody to confirm that equal amounts of paxillin protein were present in all of the cell extracts (Fig. 3B). The tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin in neutrophils is dependent upon expression of β2 integrins(16Graham I.L. Anderson D.C. Holers V.M. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 20Fuortes M. Jin W.-W. Nathan C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1477-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Neutrophils that do not express β2 integrins fail to induce the phosphorylation of paxillin in response to adhesion or growth factor stimulation. To demonstrate that the low level of paxillin phosphorylation in the α6B-P388D1 transfectants was not the result of differences in β2 expression, we compared the α6A-P388D1 and α6B-P388D1 transfectants for their ability to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin in response to adhesion to another substrate. As shown in Fig. 4A, paxillin phosphorylation was induced in both the α6A-P388D1 and α6B-P388D1 transfectants after adhesion to tissue culture plastic and, more importantly, the level of paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation was the same for both populations. In contrast, markedly increased levels of paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation after adhesion to EHS laminin were observed only for the α6A-P388D1 transfectants. Therefore, the α6B-P388D1 transfectants are capable of phosphorylating paxillin to equivalent levels as the α6A-P388D1 transfectants in response to substrates other than EHS laminin. Similar amounts of total paxillin protein were present in all of the cell extracts (Fig. 4B). One question that arises from the results obtained is whether the differences in morphology of the α6A-P388D1 and α6B-P388D1 transfectants on laminin are responsible for the observed differences in protein tyrosine phosphorylation. This possibility derives from the fact that the α6 transfectants exhibit quite different morphologies on laminin in normal culture medium(10Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To resolve this issue, the α6A- and α6B-transfectants were plated on laminin in medium containing the divalent cation Mn2+. Previously, we had observed that both populations of transfectants exhibit maximal attachment to laminin in the presence of this cation(10Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, they also exhibit a similar morphological appearance and degree of pseudopod extension in medium containing Mn2+. However, quantitative differences in the pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation induced by laminin attachment were similar to those seen in normal culture medium (Fig. 6). Specifically, the phosphotyrosine content of proteins of approximately 120, 110, and 76 kDa increased noticeably more in the α6A-P388D1 cells than in the α6B-P388D1 cells. Importantly, the difference in paxillin phosphorylation between these two cell populations was also evident in response to Mn2+-induced laminin attachment (Fig. 7A), even though these cells expressed equivalent amounts of paxillin protein (Fig. 7B).Figure 6:Mn2+-induced laminin attachment: Total tyrosine phosphorylation. The α6A-P388D1 and α6B-P388D1 transfectants were maintained in suspension or allowed to adhere to an EHS laminin substratum in medium containing MnCl2 for 30 min (the same conditions used to obtain the photomicrographs in Fig. 5).

Previous studies had demonstrated the importance of the β subunit in regulating tyrosine phosphorylation. For example, chimeric molecules comprised of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the interleukin-2 receptor and β subunit cytoplasmic domains were capable of phosphorylating pp125Fak after clustering with antibodies(5Akiyama S.K Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. LaFlamme S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15961-15964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Lukashev M.E. Sheppard D. Pytela R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18311-18314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This finding suggested that these domains contain the information that is necessary for linking signaling proteins to integrin receptors. A role for integrin α subunits in influencing integrin-mediated signaling of tyrosine phosphorylation was suggested by a report that antibody clustering of the α3β1 integrin but not the α2β1, α5β1, and α6β1 integrins resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125Fak(7Kornberg L.J.

However, no studies to date have addressed the specific role of the α subunit cytoplasmic domain in this regulation. In this regard, several functional studies have provided data that indicate that the α subunit cytoplasmic domain is important for influencing integrin signaling.(10Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 22Chan B.M.C. Kassner P.D. Schiro J.A. Byers H.R. Kupper T.S. Hemler M.E. Cell. 1992; 68: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The data presented here provide biochemical evidence for such an involvement. Moreover, a recent finding that the α6Aβ1 and α6Bβ1 integrins exhibit different properties on size fractionation columns supports the possibility that these receptors associate with distinct complexes of proteins(23de Curtis I. Gatti G. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3165-3172PubMed Google Scholar). More emphasis should be placed on elucidating the mechanism by which α subunits influence tyrosine kinase activity. The α6 cytoplasmic domains could interact directly with tyrosine kinases and modulate activity through such associations. Alternatively, the α6 cytoplasmic domain variants could function indirectly by modulating the interactions of the β subunit cytoplasmic domain with signaling components. The latter possibility is supported by the fact that the cytoplasmic domains of integrin α subunits can influence receptor activities that have been shown to be dependent upon the β subunit cytoplasmic domain. For example, the cytoplasmic domain of the β subunit is required for receptor localization to cell substratum attachment sites, but the α subunit cytoplasmic domain can determine the type of adhesive structure that is formed (i.e. focal adhesion, point contact, or podosome)(24Tawil N. Wilson P. Carbonetto S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The identification of paxillin as one of the substrates of the differential tyrosine phosphorylation induced by the α6 structural variants is intriguing in light of the known properties of this protein. Paxillin is a cytoskeletal protein that is localized to sites of cell substratum attachment such as focal adhesions(14Turner C.E. Glenney J.R. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). In in vitro binding experiments, paxillin associates with the cytoskeletal protein vinculin(14Turner C.E. Glenney J.R. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 25Turner C.E. Miller J.Y. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1583-1591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that tyrosine-phosphorylated paxillin can also interact with components of the cellular signaling machinery such as pp125Fak, p47Gag-Crk, Csk, and pp60Src, presumably by binding to the SH2 and SH3 domains of these proteins(25Turner C.E. Miller J.Y. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1583-1591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Birge R.B. Fajardo E. Reichman C. Shoelson S.E. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1993; 268: 14956-14963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These interactions implicate a role for paxillin in organizing the downstream signaling complexes that are required for integrin signaling. One issue that arises in this context is whether quantitative differences in paxillin phosphorylation could contribute to the functional differences observed between the α6Aβ1 and α6Bβ1 transfectants such as migration. Cell migration is a complex and dynamic process that most likely requires cycles of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of cellular components(29Regen C.M. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1347-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The increased tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin in the cells that express the α6Aβ1 integrin could enhance the recruitment of signaling molecules necessary for regulating such dynamic events. Although the α6A- and α6B-transfectants exhibit markedly different morphologies on laminin(10Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the results obtained in this study indicate that the observed differences in the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation between these cells are not dependent upon cell shape. When these cells were allowed to adhere to laminin in the presence of Mn2+, they exhibited similar morphologies, but the α6A cells still yielded significantly more phosphorylation of paxillin and other proteins than the α6B cells. We conclude from these data that these two integrin isoforms differ in their intrinsic ability to activate tyrosine kinase signaling and that this induction of tyrosine phosphorylation is not a secondary event initiated by cell shape changes. The identity of the three major proteins that are phosphorylated in response to α6Aβ1-mediated adhesion to laminin is being investigated. Although the size of the 120-kDa protein is indicative of pp125Fak, we have shown that these cells express very low levels of this kinase. 2L. M. Shaw, J.-L. Guan, and A. M. Mercurio, unpublished observations. This finding agrees with the previous report that monocytes and macrophages express little if any pp125Fak(30Choi K. Kennedy M. Keller G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5747-5751Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For this reason, it is unlikely that pp125Fak is the sole kinase responsible for the increased tyrosine phosphorylation induced by the α6Aβ1 integrin. However, additional pp125Fak family members have been identified in hematopoietic cells, and these related kinases could contribute to integrin signaling in P388D1 cells(30Choi K. Kennedy M. Keller G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5747-5751Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 31Kanner S.B. Aruffo A. Chan P.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10484-10487Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The 76-kDa protein may be the same protein that was recently reported to be the major protein that is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in response to monocyte attachment to tissue culture plastic and several extracellular matrix substrates(32Lin T.H. Yurochko A. Kornberg L. Morris J. Walker J.J. Haskill S. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1585-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The results obtained in this study for the α6 subunit may be relevant for other integrin α subunits that have cytoplasmic domain variants (4Sastry S. Horwitz A.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 819-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Although the existence of alternately spliced forms of integrin subunits has been known for some time, their functional significance is just beginning to be understood. Subsequent work should focus on the mechanisms by which the cytoplasmic domains of these variants exert differences in the activation of specific integrin-mediated signaling pathways"
https://openalex.org/W1966205468,"A human cDNA clone for ERM, a member of the ets gene family, has been obtained by polymerase chain reaction with degenerate primers corresponding to highly conserved regions within an Ets DNA binding domain. ERM mRNA is expressed ubiquitously. The gene was mapped to chromosome 3q27. In in vivo transient-expression assays, ERM induced transcription more efficiently from a synthetic element containing both an ets-binding site (EBS) and a cyclic AMP response element (CRE) than from one containing an EBS alone. The activation of a synthetic EBS-CRE site by ERM was likely to involve a leucine zipper protein capable of dimerizing with CRE-BP1 leucine zipper. Indeed, ERM and c-Jun synergistically activated the EBS-CRE without making an apparent ternary complex. The synergy between c-Jun and ERM may be attributed to the enhancing effect of c-Jun on the transcription activity of ERM, because c-Jun increased ERM transcription activity by more than 20-fold in an assay system using a variety of fusion proteins between a Gal4 DNA-binding domain and a portion of ERM. This enhancing effect of c-Jun required the amino-terminal portion of ERM.

Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3027-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). There are constitutive (37Nakajima K. Kusafuka T. Takeda T. Fujitani Y. Nakae K. Hirano T. Mol. Cell.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Recently we showed that the major component of the interleukin-6-inducible proteins was Stat3/acute-phase response factor (APRF) in both a human hepatoma cell line, HepG2, and rat liver(38Fujitani Y. Nakajima K. Kojima H. Nakae K. Takeda T. Hirano T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). During the effort to clone a constitutive JEBS-binding protein, we recloned a member of the ets gene family, ERM(39Mónte D. Baert J.L. Defossez P.A. de Launoit Y. Stéhelin D. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1397-1406PubMed Google Scholar), belonging to the PEA3 subfamily. In this report, we show that ERM and c-Jun synergistically activate transcription from a synthetic element containing an EBS and a CRE without apparent cooperative binding to the corresponding site. Moreover, we show that c-Jun enhances the transcriptional activity of ERM. This functional property is specific to ERM and is not observed with a closely related Ets protein, ER81. Thus ERM is the first ets gene family member that acts synergistically with c-Jun and whose transcriptional activity is enhanced by c-Jun. To isolate members of the ets gene family expressed in HepG2 cells, we obtained partial cDNA fragments by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with four mixed degenerate oligonucleotides based on the consensus amino acid sequence corresponding to the two highly conserved regions in the Ets domain, QLW(Q/E)FL(L/V) and MNY(D/E)(K/T)L. The sequences of the upstream and downstream primers are as follows: 5′ primer ED1, 5′-CGGATCCTGG(C/G)AGTT(T/C)CT(T/C/G)CT(G/C)(G/A/C)A-3′; 3′ primer ED2, 5′-GGAATTCA(G/T)C(T/G)T(C/G/A)TC(G/A)TA(G/A)TTCAT-3′; 5′ primer ED3, 5′-CGGATCCA(A/G)CT(A/G)TGGCA(G/A)T(T/C)(T/C)T-3′; and 3′ primer ED4, 5′-GGAATTCAG(C/T)TT(T/C/G)TC(A/G)TA(G/A)TTCAT-3′. Poly(A)+ RNA prepared from HepG2 cells was used to obtain the first strand of cDNA with Superscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and oligo(dT) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). DNA fragments encompassing this region with 170 base pairs were generated by PCR with appropriate combinations of primers. Each of these PCR-generated fragments was isolated and subcloned. The analysis of the individual clones revealed that (i) 60% of clones obtained by using combinations of ED3 and ED2 or ED4 corresponded to GABPα, and 25% of them corresponded to Ets-2; (ii) 10 clones were identical with murine ER81, and 15 clones closely related to ER81 appeared novel and then turned out to be identical with ERM during the course of this study; and (iii) only Ets-2 clones were obtained by using combinations of ED1 and either ED2 or ED4. To obtain the whole coding sequence of the novel (ERM) cDNA, we screened about 5 × 105 clones from a human hepatoma λgt11 cDNA library (Clontech) with the standard plaque hybridization technique (40Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using the [α-32P]dCTP-labeled ERM PCR fragment as a probe. Three partial cDNA clones, A6, A9, and A11, were obtained. We rescreened about 5 × 105 clones from a human placenta λgt11 cDNA library (Clontech) with the 1-kilobase NcoI-NdeI fragment of clone A6 as a probe. Of the resulting clones, B9 had an overlapping region with A6. The whole coding sequence of the ERM cDNA was obtained by combining parts of the A6 and B9 clones. The deduced amino acid sequence of ERM showed that ERM was a member of the PEA3 subgroup, which consists of murine PEA3(13Xin J.H. Cowie A. Lachance P. Hassell J.A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and murine ER81(14Brown T.A. McKnight S.L. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2502-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The Ets domain of ERM showed about 95% similarity to those of E1A-F, PEA3, and ER81. The overall amino acid identity of ERM to ER81, PEA3, and EIA-F was 58, 52, and 52%, respectively. There was one amino acid difference in the deduced amino acid sequences of the ERM cDNA cloned by us (Phe108 (TTT))2 and that cloned by Mónte et al.(39Mónte D. Baert J.L. Defossez P.A. de Launoit Y. Stéhelin D. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1397-1406PubMed Google Scholar) (Leu108 (CTT)). This difference was most likely due to polymorphism. ERM mRNA with 4.2 kilobases is expressed ubiquitously in adult human tissues and in a variety of cell lines with different lineages(39Mónte D. Baert J.L. Defossez P.A. de Launoit Y. Stéhelin D. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1397-1406PubMed Google Scholar). 2K. Nakae, K. Nakajima, J. Inazawa, T. Kitaoka, and T. Hirano, unpublished results. NIH 3T3 cells maintained in α-minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) were plated at 1 × 105 cells per 60-mm dish 1 day before transfection, and transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation technique (40Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with 5-7 μg of plasmid DNA containing 1.2 μg of a reporter plasmid, 1 μg of pEF-LacZ (37Nakajima K. Kusafuka T. Takeda T. Fujitani Y. Nakae K. Hirano T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3027-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) as a transfection efficiency control, the indicated amounts of various expression vectors, and appropriate amounts of control vectors (pTZ19R or control expression vectors lacking an insert DNA). The cells were incubated with DNA precipitates for 16 h, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and refed with α-minimal essential medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum for 48 h. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities in cell lysates were determined by standard methods(40Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A promoterless luciferase construct with a backbone of pBluescript II SK+, pBS luc, was made by subcloning a segment containing the firefly luciferase gene taken from PGV-B (TOYO Ink) into pBluescriptII SK+. A minimal promoter luciferase construct containing the JunB promoter, pBSB luc, was made by inserting a PvuII-PvuII fragment (from −42 to +136 of the junB gene) upstream of the luciferase gene. Synthetic response elements are as follows: 3× EBS, 5′-TCGAGCAGGAAGTCAGACTTCCTGCGCAGGAAGT-3′; 3× mEBS, 5′-TCGAGCAGCTAGTCAGACTAGCTGCGCAGCTAGT-3′; EBS-AP1, 5′-CGCGGAAGTTATAAAGCATGACTCAG-3′; EBS-CRE, 5′-CGCGGAAGTTATAAAGCATGACGTCAG-3′. The structure of the EBS-AP1 was equivalent to the PEA3-AP1 motif in the collagenase promoter with a nine-base pair spacing between the two binding sites(35Gutman A. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2241-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The typical AP1 site was replaced by a somatostatin CRE (42Montminy M.R. Bilezikjian L.M. Nature. 1987; 328: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar) for the EBS-CRE. Complementary oligonucleotides were made so that there was an appropriate restriction site at each end. One copy each of 3× EBS and 3× mEBS oligonucleotides was inserted into the SalI site of pBSB luc to make 3× EBS-pBSB luc and 3× mEBS-pBSB luc, respectively. To make 3× EBS-AP1 luc and 3× EBS-CRE luc constructs, the oligonucleotides containing the EBS-AP1 or EBS-CRE with an ApaI and a SalI restriction site at each end were concatamerized and subcloned upstream of the minimal junB promoter at the ApaI and SalI sites of pBSB luc. To make a Gal4 luciferase reporter construct, p5GBS luc, a KpnI-HindIII fragment of G5BCAT (a gift from Dr. M. R. Green) containing five copies of Gal4 binding sites and a TATA box of the adenovirus E1b gene promoter was subcloned into the KpnI-HindIII site of pBS luc. The ERM expression vector, pEF-ERM, was constructed by subcloning a HindIII fragment (Klenow-filled and ligated with BstXI adapters) of pBS-ERM containing a full-length ERM cDNA into the BstXI site of pEF-BOS. A full-length ER81 cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription PCR with poly(A)+ RNA prepared from NIH 3T3 cells and the following ER81-specific primers: ER81-A, 5′-GAGAATTCAGAGGAGCAGAATGGATGGAT-3′ and ER81-B, 5′-ACTCTAGATGCCTTGCTTGACGGGTACT-3′. The sequence of the PCR-amplified ER81 cDNA was verified by dideoxy DNA sequence analysis. The c-Jun expression vector, RSV-c-Jun, the JunD expression vector, RSV-junD, and the c-Fos expression vector, pSV2-c-fos (43Hirai S.I. Ryseck R.P. Mechta F. Bravo R. Yaniv M.

RSV-CREB and RSV-KCREB (45Walton K.M. Rehfuss R.P. Chrivia J.C. Lochner J.E. Goodman R.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 647-655PubMed Google Scholar) were gifts from Dr. R. D. Cone. pAct CRE-BP1(46Maekawa T. Sakura H. Kanei-Ishii C. Sudo T. Yoshimura T. Fujisawa J. Yoshida M. Ishii S.

Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18188-18193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an expression vector encoding an amino-terminal deletion mutant of CRE-BP1, was also a gift from Dr. S. Ishii. EF-CRE-BP1 LZ was made by adding a nuclear localization signal of SV40 large T antigen to the amino terminus of a portion of CRE-BP1 (amino acid residues 378-507) containing a leucine zipper and a downstream region to the stop codon. The expression vectors encoding Gal4(1-147) fusion proteins were as follows. GAL4-ERM (pGAL510(1-510)) containing a complete coding sequence of ERM was constructed by fusing a HindIII (Klenow-filled) fragment of pBS-ERM to the BamHI site (Klenow-filled) of pSG424 (a gift from Dr. M. Ptashne). pGAL326 was generated by deleting the NdeI-SalI fragment from pGAL510. pGAL276 was constructed by subcloning the SmaI fragment of pGAL510 into the SmaI site of pSG424. The HindIII (Klenow-filled)-PvuII fragment of pBS-ERM and the NdeI-SalI fragment (Klenow-filled) of pGAL510 were used to make pGAL165 and pGAL327-510, respectively. pGAL166-326 was constructed by subcloning the PvuII-NdeI fragment of ERM, to which had been added an EcoRI linker, to the EcoRI site of pSG424. pGAL-ER81 containing a complete coding sequence of ER81 was constructed by fusing an EcoRI-XbaI fragment of the ER81 cDNA to the EcoRI-XbaI site of pSG424. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was carried out as described previously(48Inazawa J. Saito T. Ariyama T. Abe T. Nakamura Y. Genomics. 1993; 17: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In brief, metaphase chromosome slides were prepared by the thymidine synchronization, bromodeoxyuridine release technique for delineation of replication G- and/or R-bands. The slides were denatured in 70% formamide, 2 × SSC for 2 min at 75°C, immersed in 70% ethanol at −20°C, and dehydrated through an ethanol series. A full-length cDNA designated as pBS-ERM was used as a probe. The probe (1 μg) was labeled with biotin-16-dUTP (Boehringer Manheim) by nick translation reaction. The hybridization was performed in a solution containing 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 2 × SSC, and DNAs dissolved to concentrations as follows: 50 μg/ml of biotinylated probe DNA, 0.5 g/ml of sonicated salmon sperm DNA, and 0.5 g/ml of Escherichia coli tRNA. The hybridization signals were detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-avidin (Boehringer Manheim) and biotinylated anti-avidin (Vector), as described previously(49Pinkel D. Straume T. Gray J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2934-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (2964) Google Scholar). To understand the role of the ubiquitously expressed ERM, we characterized the functional properties of ERM. We first examined whether ERM stimulates EBS-driven transcription in NIH 3T3 by using transient transfection assays (Fig. 1). We used an EBS (CAGGAAGT) that is a target site for ER81(14Brown T.A. McKnight S.L. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2502-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), since the Ets domain of ERM showed the greatest similarity to that of ER81. Either control reporter pBSB luc or a minimal promoter luciferase construct containing three copies of EBS (3× EBS-pBSB luc) or mutated EBS (CAGCTAGT, 3× mEBS-pBSB luc) was transfected into NIH 3T3 cells together with an ERM expression plasmid (pEF-ERM) or a control expression vector (pEF-BOS). Expression of ERM increased 3× EBS-driven luciferase gene expression by 3.8-fold over the basal level of the reporter without exogenous expression of ERM (Fig. 1A). The increase in luciferase activity by exogenous ERM was not observed when the reporter control (pBSB luc) lacking the ets-binding site or 3× mEBS-pBSB luc was used (Fig. 1A). These results suggested that ERM was, indeed, an EBS-specific transcriptional activator. Some of the Ets family members including Ets-1, Ets-2, and Elf-1 have been shown to activate response elements that are composed of an EBS and an adjacent AP1 site(1Wasylyk B. Wasylyk C. Flores P. Begue A. Leprince D. Stéhelin D. Nature. 1990; 346: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 35Gutman A. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2241-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 50Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Valge-Archer V.E. Rao A. Nature. 1992; 356: 801-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). We tested whether ERM efficiently activates a response element containing an EBS and an AP1 site or a related site, CRE (Fig. 1B). We used two reporter plasmids containing either three copies of an EBS-AP1 oligonucleotide or three copies of an EBS-CRE oligonucleotide. The EBS-AP1 had the same orientation and the same nine-base pair spacing as the collagenase PEA3-AP1(22Wasylyk C. Flores P. Gutman A. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3371-3378Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 35Gutman A. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2241-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). For an EBS-CRE, the AP1 site was replaced by the typical somatostatin CRE(42Montminy M.R. Bilezikjian L.M. Nature. 1987; 328: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). ERM induced transcription more efficiently from the EBS-CRE site or the EBS-AP1 site than the EBS site alone (Fig. 1, A and B). Exogenous expression of ERM increased the EBS-CRE-driven luciferase expression by 25-30-fold over the basal luciferase activity of the reporter without ERM expression, whereas ERM increased the EBS-AP1-driven luciferase expression approximately 5-fold (Fig. 1B). These results suggested that ERM may cooperate with a factor(s) acting on the CRE site and possibly on the AP1 site. We used the EBS-CRE as a target element for ERM to further study the factor(s) cooperating with ERM. We first tested the effects of several dominant negative forms of CRE-binding proteins on the ERM-induced transcriptional activity through the EBS-CRE site (Fig. 1C). Overexpression of either CRE-BP1 LZ without the basal region of CRE-BP1 necessary for DNA binding, or NT253, an amino-terminal deletion mutant of CRE-BP1, efficiently reduced the ERM-activated 3× EBS-CRE-driven gene expression in a dose-dependent manner. CRE-BP1 LZ acted as a dominant negative form by dimerizing with endogenous CRE-BP1 or proteins capable of dimerizing with CRE-BP1 LZ and alleviating their DNA-binding activities to the CRE site. Overexpressed NT253, devoid of transcriptional activity, likely replaces the endogenous CRE-binding proteins. On the other hand, overexpression of KCREB, a dominant negative form of CREB, increased the ERM-activated 3× EBS-CRE-driven gene expression in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggested that cooperation between ERM and a factor(s) acting on the adjacent CRE motif are required for ERM to function efficiently, and the endogenous proteins are most likely ones capable of dimerizing with the CRE-BP1 leucine zipper, possibly CRE-BP1 itself or other proteins including c-Jun. To determine which transcription factor(s) can cooperate with ERM on the EBS-CRE, NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with the ERM expression vector and various amounts of an expression vector for either CREB, CRE-BP1, c-Jun, JunB, JunD, or c-Fos together with the 3× EBS-CRE luciferase reporter construct. Among the factors tested, only c-Jun showed synergy with ERM (Fig. 2A). Since this synergy between ERM and c-Jun was not observed when 3× EBS-pBSB luc reporter was used (data not shown), it is unlikely that over-expression of c-Jun enhances the expression level of ERM. The synergy was"

We have studied the cellular machinery that performs the modifications by constructing and expressing nisin-subtilin chimeric prepeptides in a strain of Bacillus subtilis 168 that possesses all of the cellular machinery for making subtilin except for the presubtilin gene. The chimeras consisted of a normal subtilin leader region (SL), fused to nisin-subtilin chimeric structural regions, one of which was SL-Nis11-Sub12-32, in which the N-terminal portion of the structural region was derived from nisin, and the C-terminal portion derived from subtilin. This chimera was accurately and efficiently converted to the corresponding mature lantibiotic, as established by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography profiles, proton NMR spectroscopy, mass spectral analysis, and biological activity. A succinylated form of the chimera was also produced. Another chimera was in the reverse sense, with subtilin sequence at the N terminus and nisin sequence at the C terminus of the structural region (SL-Sub11-Nis12-34). It was processed into a heterogeneous mixture of products, none of which had the characteristics of a correctly processed polypeptide, but did contain a minor component that was active, with a specific activity that considerably exceeded nisin itself. These results, together with results published earlier, establish that processing requires specific recognition between the prelantibiotic peptide and the processing machinery, and in order for the processing to occur correctly, there must be an appropriate combination of the N-terminal part of the leader region and the C-terminal part of the structural region of the prepeptide.

Nisin (produced by Lactococcus lactis) and subtilin (produced by Bacillus subtilis) are the most thoroughly studied examples of lantibiotics, which are ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides that are characterized by the presence of unusual lanthio and dehydro residues. Their structures are shown in Fig. 1. Their biosynthesis involves several post-translational modifications: dehydration of serines and threonines, formation of thioether cross-linkages between dehydro residues and cysteines, translocation, removal of a leader sequence, and release of the mature antimicrobial peptide into the extracellular medium (reviewed in (1Hansen J.N. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 535-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 2Hansen J.N. CRC Crit. Rev. Food Sci. Nutr. 1994; 34: 69-93Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 3Sahl H.-G. Ciba Found. Symp. 1994; 186: 27-53PubMed Google Scholar)). Gene-encoded antimicrobial peptides constitute a family of natural products, whose known members are expanding rapidly in number and diversity and are produced by many kinds of organisms, ranging from bacteria to eukaryotes, including mammals(1Hansen J.N.

Their ubiquity among widely diverged organisms implies that they have had an opportunity to explore many strategies for achieving their antimicrobial properties, some of which are quite different from the mechanisms of classical antibiotics such as penicillin. They may therefore be able to supplement the arsenal of therapeutic antimicrobial agents that has been depleted as a result of the evolution of resistance among microbes. An advantage that is unique to gene-encoded antimicrobial peptides is that their structures can be readily manipulated by mutagenesis, which provides a facile means for constructing and producing the large numbers of structural analogs needed for structure-function studies and rational design. Whereas this advantage is shared by all gene-encoded antimicrobial peptides, the lantibiotics are unique in possessing the unusual dehydro and lanthio residues, which are absent from magainins(7Zasloff M.

This means that the lantibiotics offer chemical, physical, and hence biological properties that are not attainable by polypeptides that lack these residues. For example, the dehydro residues (Dha (1)The abbreviations used are: DhadehydroalanineDhbdehydrobutyrineHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography. and Dhb) are electrophiles, whereas none of the ordinary amino acids is electrophilic. The thioether cross-linkages are more resistant to breakage than the disulfide bridge and can better survive reducing conditions and extremes of pH and temperature(16Hurst A. Perlman D. Laskin A.I. Advances in Applied Microbiology. 27. Academic Press, New York1981: 85-123Google Scholar). dehydroalanine dehydrobutyrine high performance liquid chromatography. A concern when making mutants of lantibiotics is the effect of the mutations on the post-translational modification process, because a mutation that disrupts processing makes the biosynthesis of the corresponding mature lantibiotic peptide impossible. All known lantibiotic prepeptides contain an N-terminal region that is cleaved during maturation, and for the Type A lantibiotics (e.g. nisin, subtilin, and epidermin), this leader region is highly conserved (17Buchman G.W. Banerjee S. Hansen J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16260-16266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and its participation in the orchestration of post-translational modification and secretion has been proposed(17Buchman G.W.

Chem. 1988; 263: 9508-9514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Certain mutations in the leader region of the nisin prepeptide have rendered the cell incapable of nisin production(19van der Meer J.R. Rollema H.S. Siezen R.J. Beerthuyzen M.M. Kuipers O.P. de Vos W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3555-3562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas many mutations in the structural region of several lantibiotics that do not disrupt processing have been reported (e.g.(20Kuipers O.P.

Chem. 1992; 267: 25078-25085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). When the complete nisin prepeptide consisting of the nisin leader region and the nisin structural region (NL-Nis1-34) was expressed in a subtilin-producing cell, no nisin-related peptide products were detectable(22Hawkins, G., (1990) Investigation of the Site and Mode of Action of the Small Protein Antibiotic Subtilin and Development and Characterization of an Expression System for the Small Protein Antibiotic Nisin in Bacillus subtilis, Ph.D. thesis, University of Maryland, College Park, MDGoogle Scholar, 23Rintala H. Graeffe T. Paulin L. Kalkkinen N. Saris P.E.J. Biotech. Lett. 1993; 15: 991-996Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, when a chimera consisting of the subtilin leader region and the nisin structural region (SL-Nis1-34) was expressed in a subtilin-producing cell, an inactive nisin-like peptide was produced in which the leader region had been correctly cleaved and contained a full complement of unusual amino acids(22Hawkins, G., (1990) Investigation of the Site and Mode of Action of the Small Protein Antibiotic Subtilin and Development and Characterization of an Expression System for the Small Protein Antibiotic Nisin in Bacillus subtilis, Ph.D. thesis, University of Maryland, College Park, MDGoogle Scholar). The lack of activity was attributed to the formation of incorrect thioether cross-linkages(22Hawkins, G., (1990) Investigation of the Site and Mode of Action of the Small Protein Antibiotic Subtilin and Development and Characterization of an Expression System for the Small Protein Antibiotic Nisin in Bacillus subtilis, Ph.D. thesis, University of Maryland, College Park, MDGoogle Scholar). Similarly, when a prepeptide consisting of a subtilin leader region and a nisin structural region was expressed in a nisin-producing cell, the nisin structural region contained the unusual amino acids, but the leader was not cleaved(24Kuipers O.P. Rollema H.S. de Vos W.M. Siezen R.J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that expression of a prepeptide consisting of the nisin structural region fused to a subtilin-nisin chimeric leader region, SL1-7-NL8-23-Nis1-34, forms active nisin when expressed in a subtilin-producing cell(23Rintala H. Graeffe T. Paulin L. Kalkkinen N. Saris P.E.J. Biotech. Lett. 1993; 15: 991-996Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These results imply that the subtilin processing machinery in B. subtilis is not capable of recognizing the nisin prepeptide (which is ordinarily expressed in Lactococcus lactis) and converting it to nisin. However, the subtilin machinery will perform the modification reactions on the nisin structural peptide if it is attached to a subtilin leader region, although the modifications seem to be misdirected so that active nisin is not produced. Finally, the subtilin machinery will produce active nisin if the leader region is an appropriate combination of subtilin leader and nisin leader sequences. In this work, we explore the contribution of the structural region and its relationship to the leader region by the construction and expression of nisin-subtilin chimeras, which contain chimeric nisin-subtilin structural regions fused to the subtilin leader region. We have discovered that chimeras in which the C-terminal portion of the structural region correspond to subtilin are processed correctly and give active products, whereas those in which the C-terminal portion of the structural region corresponds to nisin produces a heterogeneous mixture of products, most of which, but not all, are inactive. B. subtilis 168 strains and cloning vectors used were LH45ermΔS(21Liu W. Hansen J.N. J. Biol.

Synthetic oligonucleotides were annealed, filled in using Klenow fragment, restricted with EcoRI and HindIII, and cloned into the EcoRI-HindIII site of pTZ19U. The cloned fragment, which contained the mutation, was cut out with appropriate restriction enzymes and cloned into the corresponding site of the pSMcat vector or the pACcat vector. The mutated sequence was confirmed by sequence analysis of the cloned insert using the Sequenase version 2.0 sequencing kit from U. S. Biochemical Corp. This mutant gene was introduced into the chromosome of LHermΔS (from which the natural subtilin gene had been deleted) by transformation and Campbell-type integration using selection on chloramphenicol plates(21Liu W. Hansen J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25078-25085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cloning vector pACcat was constructed by replacing the upstream BstEII site in the plasmid pSMcat with an SpeI site, thus making the downstream BstEII site a unique site. Strains producing the mutant peptides were grown in Medium A (21Liu W. Hansen J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25078-25085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Feeney R.E. Garibaldi J.A. Humphreys E.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1948; 17: 435-445PubMed Google Scholar) that was modified in that it contained 2% sucrose and 10 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The culture was incubated with vigorous aeration for 25-35 h at 35°C, acidified to pH 2.5 with phosphoric acid, and heated to 121°C for 3 min to inactivate proteases. A 0.5 volume of n-butanol was added, stirred at 4°C for 2 h, allowed to stand at 4°C for 2 h, and centrifuged; 2.5 volumes of acetone were added to the supernatant, allowed to stand at −20°C for 16 h, and centrifuged. The pellet was lyophilized and resuspended in 20% acetonitrile with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. This was immediately purified on a C-18 reverse phase HPLC column using a trifluoracetic acid (0.05%)-water-acetonitrile gradient in which the acetonitrile varied from 0 to 100% over 30 min at a rate of 1.2 ml/min, unless indicated otherwise. Samples for 1H NMR spectral analysis were dissolved in deuterated water (99.96 atom% D, Aldrich Chemical Co.) lyophilized (repeated twice) to exchange protons, and dissolved in D2O to a final concentration of 2-3 mg/ml 1H NMR spectra were obtained using a Bruker AMX-500 spectrometer interfaced to an Aspect 3000 computer. Spectra were obtained at a constant temperature of 295 K, using selective solvent suppression. Data processing was performed using UXNMR software. Mass spectral analysis was performed by PeptidoGenic Research & Co. (Livermore, CA) on a Sciex API I Electrospray mass spectrometer, which has an analysis range of over 200,000 Da with ±0.01% accuracy, on 5-μl samples at a concentration of about 5 pmol/μl. The reported masses are those calculated as the most probable values based on the different m/z forms. Biological activity was measured using an inhibition zone (halo) assay (21Liu W. Hansen J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25078-25085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a liquid culture assay(26Morris S.L. Walsh R.C. Hansen J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 21: 13590-13594Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). HPLC fractions were tested for activity by spotting 15 μl onto an agar plate (modified Medium A), incubated at 37°C for 15 min, sprayed with Bacillus cereus T spores, and incubated at 37°C for 16 h. Inhibition resulted in a clear zone (containing spores that were inhibited during outgrowth) surrounded by an opaque lawn of cells derived from the spores that had become vegetative. In the liquid culture assay, various concentrations of peptide were added to a suspension of B. cereus T spores in modified medium A, incubated in a rotating drum shaker at 30°C for 90 min; the inhibitory effects were evaluated using phase contrast microscopy and a Klett-Summerson colorimeter. Relative amounts of peptide were also estimated by integration of peak areas (measured at 214 nm) of the HPLC profiles, using nisin as a standard. It was assumed that the extinction coefficients of the mutant peptides are the same as nisin at this wavelength. The sizes of the peptides were estimated using Tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which is designed for proteins in the range of 1-100 kDa(27Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar), and uses a 4% stacking gel, a 10% spacer gel, and a 16.5% separating gel. Gels were silver-stained using kit 161-0443 from Bio-Rad, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Inspection of the structures of nisin and subtilin in Fig. 1reveals that the number and locations of the thioether rings and the Dha residues are conserved. Each has one Dhb residue, but its position is not conserved. The N-terminal region is relatively conserved, except for three non-conservative differences out of the first 11 residues. Nisin has isoleucine at position 1, whereas subtilin has a bulky aromatic tryptophan. Subtilin has a positively charged lysine at position 2, whereas nisin has an unusual Dhb residue. Finally, subtilin has a negatively charged glutamate at position 4, whereas nisin has a neutral aliphatic isoleucine. In previous work, we changed the Glu4 of subtilin to the Ile4 of nisin, and obtained a mutant with enhanced chemical stability and activity(21Liu W. Hansen J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25078-25085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We wondered what would happen if we changed the other two residues as well, to give a subtilin analog with a nisin-like N terminus. This analog would have only hydrophobic residues at the N terminus, as well as a fourth dehydro residue at a location that is unfamiliar to the subtilin processing machinery, and if it were unable to process it properly, the entire processing pathway could abort. Since the subtilin machinery cannot process the SL-Nis1-34 prepeptide to an active product (22Hawkins, G., (1990) Investigation of the Site and Mode of Action of the Small Protein Antibiotic Subtilin and Development and Characterization of an Expression System for the Small Protein Antibiotic Nisin in Bacillus subtilis, Ph.D. thesis, University of Maryland, College Park, MDGoogle Scholar), it is difficult to predict how the machinery would handle the SL-Nis11-Sub12-32 prepeptide. We therefore constructed and expressed this prepeptide and examined its products. Using the mutagenesis strategy shown in Fig. 2, residues 1, 2, and 4 in the subtilin structural region were changed to those of nisin. This chimeric gene was integrated into the chromosome of B. subtilis LH45ermΔS, and the polypeptide products were isolated from the extracellular fluid. Fig. 3shows the HPLC elution profile of the peptides isolated from cells in early stationary phase. A single large peak emerged from the column, and it possessed antimicrobial activity. Electrophoresis on Tricine-SDS gels showed a single major band with a relative molecular mass between 3,000 and 3,200, which was consistent with the material being the Nis11-Sub12-32 chimera.Figure 3:HPLC chromatography of the Nis11-Sub12-32 chimera. The Nis11-Sub12-32 chimera constructed as shown in Fig. 2was expressed, isolated, and subjected to HPLC chromatography. Samples were collected at 1-min intervals and assayed for activity using the halo assay. The major peak contained the only activity. A portion of this peak sample was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver-stained. The stained gel is shown in a panel beside the peak (sample, left lane, size standard, right lane). Standards were 2.5-kDa myoglobin fragment (F3), 6.2-kDa myoglobin fragment (F2), and 8.1-kDa myoglobin fragment (F1). The expected mass of the Nis11-Sub12-32 chimera is 3186 Da, which is consistent with the position of the band in the sample lane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In an attempt to attain a higher yield of material, the culture was allowed to incubate into late stationary phase, whereupon the HPLC column profile showed two peaks, one being the original peak, with a second peak trailing slightly behind (Fig. 4, inset). The two peaks (Fig. 4, EarlyPeak and LatePeak) were collected separately and subjected to NMR spectroscopy as shown in Fig. 5. The spectra showed that the late peak was contaminated by the early peak, so the column was eluted with a shallower gradient (center, Fig. 4), and further experiments were performed using the more purified material. The antimicrobial activity is associated mainly with the early peak. The halo assays in Fig. 4did not detect any activity in the late peak, but when higher concentrations were tested, its activity was found to about 10-fold lower than the early peak (data not shown). This is reminiscent of the observation that B. subtilis 6633 (the natural producer of subtilin) and LH45 (a subtilin-producing derivative of B. subtilis 168) produce two forms of subtilin(28Hansen J.N. Chung Y.J. Liu W. Steen M.J. Jung G. Sahl H.-G. Nisin and Novel Lantibiotics. ESCOM, Leiden, The Netherlands1991: 287-302Google Scholar); when B. subtilis 6633 is incubated into late stationary phase, there is an accumulation of subtilin that has been succinylated at its N terminus (29Chan W.C. Bycroft B.W. Leyland M.L. Lian L.Y. Roberts G.C. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The succinylated subtilin was significantly less active than the normal unsuccinylated subtilin. We therefore suspected that the late peak is the succinylated form of the early peak. This was confirmed by mass spectral analysis (Fig. 5), showing that the early peak consists mainly of a species with an Mr = 3185.98 (panel A), which conforms exactly to the expected 3186-Da mass of the mature Nis11-Sub12-32 chimera. The late peak gave a mass of 3286.78 Da (panel B), which is consistent with an expected mass of 3286 Da for the succinylated form of the mature Nis11-Sub12-32 chimera. We note that in order for these expected masses to occur, it is necessary for the chimeric prepeptides to have undergone the full panoply of posttranslational modifications in which 8 serines and threonines are dehydrated, 5 thioether cross-linkages are formed, and the leader region cleaved at the proper residue. The NMR spectrum of the early peak (panel D), and of the mixture (panel C) of the early and late peaks shows resonances that correspond to the Dhb2 and Dha5 resonances contributed by the nisin part of the molecule and to the Dhb18 and Dha31 residues contributed by the subtilin portion of the molecule. Succinylation of subtilin has been shown to cause a shift in the resonance of the Dha5 residue(29Chan W.C. Bycroft B.W. Leyland M.L. Lian L.Y. Roberts G.C. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which can be attributed to a change in the chemical environment of Dha5 caused by the presence of the N-terminal succinyl group. Since the Dhb2 residue in the succinylated chimera is even closer to the succinyl group, a shift in its resonance would be expected. The spectrum shown in panel C, which includes resonances of the succinylated chimera, confirms these expectations, and shows a shifted resonance for Dha5 (labeled as Dha5∗), and for Dhb2 (labeled as Dhab2∗). We note that succinylation of the Nis11-Sub12-32 chimera in the same manner as subtilin means that the cell treats the chimera in a completely normal way, and that the succinylation system must be able to tolerate the differences in the N-terminal end of the chimera, so must not be critical for recognition. The biological role of the succinylation is unknown.Figure 5:NMR and mass spectra of the early peak and late peak. The early peak and late peak are those as defined in the HPLC elution profiles in Fig. 4. The mass spectrum of the early peak is shown in panel A, with a calculated mass of 3185.98 Da that is identical to the expected value of 3186 Da for the mature Nis11-Sub12-32 chimera. The mass spectrum of the the purified late peak is shown in panel B, with its calculated mass of 3286.78 Da exactly corresponding to the 100 Da increase expected from addition of a succinyl group to the mature Nis11-Sub12-32 chimera. The NMR spectrum of the early peak is shown in panel D. Identification of the Dhb2, Dha5, Dhb18, and Dha31 peaks was by correlation with NMR spectra obtained previously for nisin (33Liu W. Hansen J.N. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1990; 56: 2551-2558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and subtilin(21Liu W. Hansen J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25078-25085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The NMR spectrum of a mixture of the early peak and late peak is shown in panel C. Resonances shifted by the presence of the succinyl group are identified by asterisks (Dhb2∗, Dha5∗).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Nisin and subtilin can inhibit spore-forming food spoilage bacteria from undergoing outgrowth from spores to the vegetative state, as well as inhibit cells that are in the vegetative state(30Hurst A. Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 1981; 27: 85-123Crossref Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The mechanism of inhibition of these types of cells is different, as it has been shown that the Dha5 residue is critical for subtilin to inhibit spore outgrowth, but not for subtilin to inhibit vegetative cells(31Liu W. Hansen J.N. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 648-651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of the two purified forms of Nis11-Sub12-32 were therefore measured against outgrowing spores and vegetative cells, and compared to nisin. Since the activities of subtilin and E4I-subtilin have previously been compared to nisin(21Liu W. Hansen J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25078-25085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the relative activities among all these forms can be inferred in terms of relative nisin units. The activity of Nis11-Sub12-32 against spore outgrowth was estimated by the halo assay and the liquid assays, and against vegetative cells by the liquid assay. The chimera was active against both spore outgrowth and vegetative growth, and the specific activities of the chimera and nisin were so similar that they could not be distinguished in either their ability to inhibit spore outgrowth or to inhibit vegetative cells (data not shown). Accordingly, one sees inhibition of spore outgrowth at about 0.2 μg/ml, and against vegetative cells at about 2 μg/ml, with both the chimera and nisin. Based on previous measurements(21Liu W. Hansen J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25078-25085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Liu W. Hansen J.N. Appl. Environ.

Chem. 1984; 259: 13590-13594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this means that the Nis11-Sub12-32 chimera is about 2-fold more active than E4I-subtilin and about 6-8 times more active than natural subtilin. The chemical and biological instability of subtilin have been correlated with the tendency of residue Dha5 to spontaneously undergo chemical modification, which results in disappearance of the Dha5 peak in the NMR spectrum and loss of biological activity(21Liu W. Hansen J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25078-25085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Hansen J.N. Chung Y.J. Liu W. Steen M.J. Jung G. Sahl H.-G. Nisin and Novel Lantibiotics.

Translated αa also bound to immobilized clathrin trimers, although with greater sensitivity to increasing pH than the translated β2 subunit. Clathrin binding by both the α and β subunits is consistent with a bivalent cross-linking model for lattice assembly (Keen, J. H.(1987) Cell Biol. 105, 1989).

INTRODUCTIONReceptor-mediated endocytosis is a multi-step process involving membrane invagination, coated pit formation, and budding of these pits to form coated vesicles(2Keen J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). A major protein implicated in endocytosis is clathrin, a triskelion-shaped protein that forms the structural basis for the regular polygonal lattice of coated pits and vesicles(1Keen J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1989-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 3Brodsky F.M. Science. 1988; 242: 1396-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). These coated membranes also contain additional protein components that have been referred to as assembly, adaptor, or associated proteins (APs). 1The abbreviations used are: APsassociated proteinsMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. One probable function of APs is to promote polymerization of the clathrin lattice at defined sites and times. APs are also likely to interact with receptor cytoplasmic tails resulting in the selective inclusion of various receptors into coated pits (reviewed in Refs. 2, 4, 5).APs vary in structure and intracellular localization. The best characterized examples include AP-1, a Golgi-associated heterotetramer consisting of γ, β1, AP47, and AP19 polypeptides; AP-2, a plasma membrane-associated heterotetramer of α, β2, AP50, and AP17 polypeptides; and AP-3/AP180, a neuronspecific monomer(2Keen J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 4Pearse B.M.F. Robinson M.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 151-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). This study concerns the AP-2 complex and focuses on the interactions of its α subunit with clathrin. Two genetically distinct isoforms of α subunit exist: αa, an isoform which is expressed ubiquitously, and αa, an isoform believed to be expressed primarily in neurons. The isoforms are 84% identical and differ predominantly in their C-terminal portions. The αa isoform contains a unique 42 amino acid insert beginning at position 704(6Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).Although AP-2-clathrin interactions have been studied in detail(1Keen J.H. J.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5590-5597Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), it has been difficult to ascertain the contributions of individual AP-2 subunits. Fractionation of AP-2 polypeptides with urea and guanidinium chloride was used to study these interactions, indicating that the α and β2 subunits alone were necessary and sufficient for coat assembly activity(13Prasad K. Keen J.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5590-5597Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Ahle and Ungewickell(7Ahle S. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20089-20093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using mild denaturation to purify β2 subunit from AP-2, demonstrated that the former was capable of competitively inhibiting AP-2 binding to preassembled clathrin cages. This work was extended by Gallusser and Kirchhausen (14Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5237-5244Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) who demonstrated that recombinant β2 subunit purified by denaturation-renaturation from Escherichia coli inclusion bodies was capable of promoting clathrin assembly. Collectively, these results support the hypothesis that the β2 subunit plays an important role in AP-2-driven clathrin assembly in vivo, but the role of the α subunit remains undefined.We have previously reported that an α/AP50/AP17 complex prepared by mild denaturation-renaturation was capable of binding to preformed clathrin cages, suggesting that one or more of the other subunits, most likely the α subunit, also recognizes and binds clathrin(13Prasad K. Keen J.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5590-5597Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We adopt the approach of in vitro translation of the individual large AP-2 subunits to further explore this issue. The findings reported here indeed demonstrate that the α subunit can bind tightly to clathrin, consistent with a role in coat assembly or other coat-associated functions.MATERIALS AND METHODSThe TNT rabbit reticulocyte lysate transcription-translation kit and pSP65 cloning vector were purchased from Promega. Translabel was obtained from ICN Biomedicals, Inc. Sepharose CL-4B and Superose 6B resins were from Sigma, and CN-Br activated Sepharose CL-4B was purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Clathrin and assembly proteins were prepared from calf brains as described previously(1Keen J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1989-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 15Keen J.H.

L-1-tosyl-amido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-trypsin was from Worthington Biochemical, Inc. HEPES was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. All other chemicals were reagent grade or better.Buffers used are as follows: Buffer A: 0.1 M sodium MES, 1.0 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 0.02% NaN3, pH 6.50; Buffer B, Buffer A: 1.0 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, glycerol (4.5:4.5:1 (v/v/v)); Buffer C, 5 mM sodium MES, 2 mM CaCl2, pH 6.15; Buffer T, 100 mM dipotassium tartrate, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM MgCl2, pH 7.0In Vitro Transcription-TranslationPolypeptides were expressed in vitro using a TNT rabbit reticulocyte lysate transcription-translation kit. The αa cDNA, kindly provided by M. S. Robinson (Oxford University) (6Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the EcoRI site of the pSP65 vector (Promega), under the sp6 promotor. Constructs containing inserts in both the sense and antisense orientations were confirmed with restriction enzyme analysis and purified on cesium chloride gradients.The cDNA template for the C-terminal deletion mutant αa(1-605 was produced by restricting the pSP65αa sense construct with AvaI (αa nucleotide 2021). The mutant was then generated by runoff transcription-translation. Full-length β2 subunit were transcribed from the pBluescript SK+ T3 promotor, using a construct kindly provided by T. Kirchhausen (Harvard University)(16Kirchhausen T. Nathanson K.L. Matsui W. Vaisberg A. Chow E.P. Burne C. Keen J.H. Davis A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2612-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Luciferase was translated with the sp6 TNT control construct (Promega). β-Galactosidase was produced using a pSP65-based construct provided by V. Gurevich (Thomas Jefferson University). Transcription-translation reactions were assembled according to the manufacturer's instructions and incubated 90-120 min. Proteins were translated in the presence of [35S]Translabel: although the reagent contained both [35S]L-methionine and -cysteine, a large excess of unlabeled cysteine in the translation kit blocked the latter's incorporation. Prior to use, translation reactions were centrifuged at 100,000 revolutions/min for 20 min at 2°C in a Beckman TLA 100 rotor to clear ribosomes and aggregates. All experiments utilized freshly translated subunits.Proteolysis of Translated αa and β2 SubunitsA fresh 1.0 mg/ml trypsin stock solution was prepared in 1 mM HCl. An aliquot of the stock solution was diluted at least 10-fold into 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, immediately before use. A 5-μl translation reaction aliquot and an appropriate amount of diluted trypsin stock were combined with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, in a final volume of 100 μl, according to the protocol of Matsui and Kirchhausen(12Matsui W. Kirchhausen T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10791-10798Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Reactions were incubated 15 min at room temperature and quenched with either SDS sample buffer or a 3-fold molar excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor.Digests of αa bound to cages were carried out in Buffer A. Cage high speed pellets (see below) with bound αa were resuspended in Buffer A and an aliquot of this suspension combined with trypsin stock freshly diluted in buffer A. Reactions were incubated 15 min at room temperature and quenched with a 3-fold molar excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor.Cage Binding AssaysPreparation of clathrin cages and binding of APs to preformed clathrin cages has been described elsewhere (10Keen J.H.

Biol Chem. 1991; 266: 7950-7956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All steps were performed at 4°C except where noted. In this work, cage aliquots were supplemented with 100 mM Tris-HCl and spun 2 min at 13,000 × g just prior to use. Clathrin concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically in 0.5 M Tris-HCl using the calculated extinction coefficient of 1.0 mg ml-1 cm-1. Typically, 20-60 μg of cages and 5 μl of translation reaction were incubated for 30 min in Buffer A supplemented with 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, in a final volume of 300 μl. Samples were centrifuged at 75,000 revolutions/min for 7 min in a TLA 100.2 rotor. Pellets were resuspended in 60 μl of sample buffer, and supernatants were precipitated with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and similarly resuspended. Equal aliquots of pellets and supernatant were analyzed on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide minigels.Clathrin-Sepharose Binding AssaysPreparation of clathrin-Sepharose and its binding by APs have been described previously(1Keen J.H.

Into Bio-Rad BioSpin Chromatography columns, 300 μl of resin was aliquoted. Columns were equilibrated with several column volumes of Buffer A containing 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin (10 μg/μl). A 3-μl aliquot of translation reaction was mixed with 97 μl of the equilibration buffer, loaded, and incubated on the column for 30 min, rinsed four times with one column volume each of equilibration solution, and eluted with four column volumes of Buffer B supplemented with 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Unbound and eluted fractions were pooled separately, precipitated in 10% trichloracetic acid, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE).SDS-PAGE Gel Band AnalysisSDS-PAGE gels were Coomassie stained, destained, and treated with EN3HANCE (DuPont NEN), dried, and subjected to fluorography for 0.5-16 h on Kodak X-0MAT film. Radioactive bands were excised from the dried gels, dissolved in H2O2, and counted in a Wallack LKB scintillation counter.RESULTSIn Vitro Translated PolypeptidesTwo different αa polypeptides were synthesized in vitro (Fig. 1): the full-length polypeptide consisting of 977 amino acids (lane 1) and a C-terminal truncation mutant (αa(1-605) possessing only the N-terminal 605 amino acids (lane 2). The full-length αa polypeptide has a calculated molecular mass of 107,655 Da but migrated on SDS-PAGE as a band of ≈114,000 Mr, coincident with the Coomassie-stained αa band of bovine brain AP-2. The yield of the deletion mutant (Mr = 67,500) was substantially lower than that of the full-length product, as approximately a 10-fold longer autoradiographic exposure was required for comparable detectability on film. As a negative control, we translated αa in the presence of the antisense αa construct, obtaining a greatly attenuated yield as expected (lane 3). The expressed β2 subunit (lane 4, Mr = 105,133) was readily resolved from translated αa by gel electrophoresis. Like translated αa, the β2 polypeptide comigrated with a corresponding Coomassie-stained band of AP-2. Finally, in some experiments, translated luciferase (lane 5, Mr = 62,000) and β-galactosidase (lane 6, Mr = 116,000) were utilized as controls.Proteolysis of in Vitro Translated αa and β2 PolypeptidesLimited proteolysis of AP-2 reveals two major stable protein domains: one containing 60-66-kDa N-terminal core domains of the α and β2 subunits associated with intact AP50 and AP17 intact subunits, and the other consisting of 30-40-kDa domains corresponding to smaller C-terminal appendages of the α and β subunits (10, 12, 17, 18, and data not shown).Similarly, proteolysis of the in vitro translated αa or β2 subunits alone yielded fragments of ≈58-66 kDa and ≈40 kDa (Fig. 2). Identical results were obtained when translated proteins were cleaved in the presence of carrier AP-2, as assessed by comigration of Coomassie Blue-stained and radiolabeled bands on SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Quantitative analysis of the changes in the full-length αa product and the appendage domain confirm a precursor-product relationship (Fig. 3). The coincidence of the two curves in Fig. 3demonstrates that at all trypsin concentrations the fraction of full-length αa cleaved is virtually identical to that of appendage generated. Furthermore, from the published sequence of the αa cDNA(6Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), the C-terminal 40 kDa portion of αa (i.e. amino acids 610-977) is predicted to contain five of the 17 methionine residues of αa, or 27% of the total αa radiolabel. In close agreement with this prediction, 24% of the undigested full-length counts were found in the 40-kDa proteolytic product upon complete digestion of full-length αa. Hence, we conclude that the initial cleavage of translated αa by trypsin occurs in a region corresponding to the relatively exposed linker of an α subunit in the intact AP-2 complex.Figure 2:Limited proteolysis of translated α and β polypeptides. The formation of labile core (C) and stable appendage (A) domains from the full-length subunit (F) are indicated (see text for details). Two-μl aliquots of αa (lanes 1-6) and β2 (lanes 7-12) translation reactions were digested for 15 min at 22°C with the following trypsin concentrations and analyzed by SDS-PAGE: lanes 1 and 7, no trypsin; lanes 2 and 8, 75 ng/ml; lanes 3 and 9, 150 ng/ml; lanes 4 and 10, 300 ng/ml; lanes 5 and 11, 600 ng/ml; lanes 6 and 12, 9600 ng/ml.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3:Quantitative analysis of in vitro translated α polypeptide cleavage.

Ungewickell E. J. Biol Chem. 1991; 266: 7910-7918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The initial proteolytic susceptibility of translated αa, resulting in the generation of cores and appendages (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 3) was comparable to that of bovine brain αa in an AP-2 complex as assessed by digestion of translated αa in the presence of AP-2 (data not shown). However, further digestion of both translated subunits revealed significant differences from those in brain AP-2. The 58-66-kDa core domains of translated αa, and especially of β2, were much more labile than those of AP-2. While virtually no 60-66-kDa fragments of the translated subunits remained at trypsin concentrations greater than 170 ng/ml (Fig. 2, lanes 4-6 and 10-12), AP-2 derived N-terminal products were stable at much higher trypsin concentrations, in excess of 840 ng/ml (21 and data not shown). In contrast, the 40-kDa C-terminal appendages of both the translated α and β polypeptides were similar to AP-2 in their relative stability, resistant even at trypsin concentrations of 9,600 ng/ml (Fig. 2, lanes 6 and 12).Elsewhere, we have reported that a high affinity inositol polyphosphate-binding site exists near the N terminus of the α subunit. 2I. Gaidarov, Q. Chen and J. H. Keen, manuscript in preparation. Inclusion of 1 mM phytic acid (1,2,3,4 5,6-IP6) did not alter the proteolytic pattern of α cleavage described above (data not shown).Binding of Full-length Translated Proteins to Preformed Clathrin CagesTo examine the interaction of translated polypeptides with assembled clathrin, we utilized a cage binding assay. In preliminary experiments, we ascertained that the addition of the translation reaction had no effect on the sedimentability of clathrin cages (data not shown). Furthermore, we determined that both translated luciferase, a standard for the in vitro expression system, and β-galactosidase, a polypeptide of similar size to the AP-2 large subunits, showed essentially no affinity for the assembled clathrin cages in the binding assay (Fig. 4, lanes 1-8). As expected from previous work(7Ahle S. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20089-20093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), translated β2 subunit did bind to clathrin cages (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 4, the majority of translated α polypeptide cosedimented with the clathrin cages (lane 13), while a small amount of translated and apparently aggregated α polypeptide was sedimented by low speed centrifugation (lane 12). Typically, sedimentation of translated αa in the absence of cages, taken as a measure of nonspecific binding, was 10-15% of the total binding (lane 10).Figure 4:In vitro translated αa, but not luciferase or β-galactosidase, binds to assembled clathrin cages. Aliquots (5 μl) of translation mixes containing controls, luciferase (lanes 1-4), or β-galactosidase (lanes 5-8), or αa (lanes 9-14) were incubated in the absence (lanes 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9-11) or presence (lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12-14) of 60 μg of clathrin cages for 30 min at 4°C. The samples were then centrifuged and equal proportions of high speed pellets (lanes 1 and 2, 5 and 6, 10, and 13) and supernatants (lanes 3, and 4, 7 and 8, 11, and 14) were electrophoresed; for αa, low speed pellets (lanes 9 and 12) were also analyzed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)By incubating the in vitro translation mixture with increasing concentrations of clathrin cages we obtained a dissociation constant of 1.1 × 10-7M (Fig. 5). From the asymptote of the binding curve, the maximal α fraction bound was 0.71, implying that not all of the translated protein was capable of binding clathrin. The binding was not inhibited by 1 mM phytic acid, a potent inhibitor of AP-2 self-association(9Beck K.A. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4442-4447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), further evidence that binding was specific and not due to aggregation or self-association (data not shown).Figure 5:Binding of translated full-length αa and αa(1-605) as a function of clathrin cage concentration. Aliquots of translation reaction containing in vitro translated full-length αa (filled squares, solid line) or αa(1-605) (open squares, dashed line) were incubated with clathrin cages at the indicated concentrations for 30 min and fractionated by centrifugation. The fraction bound was determined by excision and counting of the high speed pellet and supernatant bands and was corrected for nonspecific sedimentation. The data were fit to rectangular hyperbolas (Kaleidagraph) yielding values of Kd≈ 1.1 × 10-7M and 71% maximal binding (r = 0.999) for the full-length αa, and Kd≈ 3.1 × 10-7M and 36% maximal binding (r = 0.955) for αa(1-605).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Clathrin cage binding by translated αa subunit was inhibited by saturating quantities of AP-2, confirming that the interaction was specific (Fig. 6).

Cages (20 μg) were incubated with a bovine brain AP preparation containing the indicated concentration of AP-2 in Buffer T for 90 min, followed by incubation with 4 μl of translated αa for an additional 30 min.

Brief (5 min) treatment of the sedimented cages, to which translated αa was bound, with 500 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7, followed by a high speed spin released most (>80%) of the αa into the supernatant. Furthermore, the solubilized αa again cosedimented with the clathrin cages reformed by stepwise dialysis of the dissociated preparation into Buffer C and then into Buffer A (data not shown).Binding of Translated Proteins to Clathrin Trimers Immobilized on Sepharose CL-4B BeadsWe used clathrin-Sepharose to assess the ability of α and β subunits to bind clathrin triskelia (Fig. 7). Underivatized Sepharose CL-4B bound little if any of either of the translation products. The translated β2 polypeptide bound tightly to clathrin-Sepharose, providing the first direct demonstration of its ability to bind disassembled clathrin as well as cage structures. Binding of the αa polypeptide was also observed, although it was not as complete as that of the β2 polypeptide under these conditions. Interestingly, while β2 bound with relatively little sensitivity to pH, αa binding to clathrin trimers was considerably more sensitive to increasing pH throughout the range 6.5-7.5.Figure 7:pH dependence of the binding of in vitro translated αa and β2 to clathrin-Sepharose. A, aliquots (3 μl) of translation reactions of αa (lanes 1-6) or β2 (lanes 7-12) were incubated for 30 min with 300 μl of clathrin-Sepharose (lanes 2-5 and 8-11) or underivatized Sepharose (lanes 1, 6, 7, and 12) which had been pre-equilibrated with buffer A adjusted to the indicated pH (see below). Columns were washed with 1200 μl of the equilibration buffer (panel W) and the remaining bound protein eluted with 1200 μl of Buffer B supplemented with 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (panel E). All fractions were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and equal proportions of washes and eluants were analyzed by electrophoresis and autoradiography. Lanes 1, 2, 7, and 8, pH 6.5; lanes 3 and 9, pH 6.8; lanes 4 and 10, pH 7.2; lanes 5, 6, 11, and 12, pH 7.6.

Maximal binding for each polypeptide was observed at pH 6.5 and was 80% for αa and essentially 100% for β2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Functional Domains of Translated ProteinsPrevious studies have shown that following controlled proteolysis, only the large core fragments of AP-2 retain an ability to bind to clathrin cages(10Keen J.H. Beck K.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 158: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The smaller C-terminal appendages fail to interact appreciably with clathrin cages. We carried out related experiments to evaluate the functional properties of domains of isolated α subunit and its individual domains. We observed that only full-length αa bound clathrin cages de novo; in contrast the 58-66- and 40-kDa proteolytic products remained predominantly in the supernatant (data not shown).Alternatively, to assess the ability of the isolated N-terminal region of translated αa to bind to preformed clathrin cages, we also produced a truncated polypeptide, designated αa(1-605, by runoff transcription-translation (Fig. 1). This protein did bind in a saturable manner to clathrin cages, although the apparent binding affinity (Kd = 3 × 10-7M) was somewhat lower that of the full-length protein (Fig. 5). Only 36% of the total protein was capable of binding, suggesting either that a greater proportion of the translated protein was misfolded or that a binding equilibrium had not been established.In contrast to the failure of either core or appendage domain of translated and digested αa to bind, when cages with bound αa were incubated with trypsin the core fragments were preferentially retained by the cages while the appendage domain was released into the supernatant (Fig. 8). A similar result has been obtained with native AP-2(12Matsui W. Kirchhausen T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10791-10798Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).

INTRODUCTIONAssembly of the nucleotide loop of cobalamin in Salmonella typhimurium is thought to require the involvement of four enzymes, CobU, CobS, CobT, and CobC (Fig. 1). CobT and CobC act sequentially in the generation of dimethylbenzimidazole-α-riboside (also known as α-ribazole) from nicotinic acid mononucleotide and dimethylbenzimidazole. CobT catalyzes the transfer of the phosphoribosyl moiety of nicotinic acid mononucleotide to dimethylbenzimidazole to yield α-ribazole-5′-phosphate(1Trzebiatowski J.R. O'Toole G.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3568-3575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is then dephosphorylated by CobC to generate α-ribazole(2O'Toole G.A. Trzebiatowski J.R.

Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3317-3326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We report the overexpression and purification of the cobU gene product, document that the CobU protein has both kinase and guanylyltransferase activities required for the synthesis of Ado-CBI-GDP from Ado-CBI, and provide evidence that Ado-CBI-P is an intermediate in the synthesis of Ado-CBI-GDP. We also present evidence that the transfer of the guanylyl moiety of GTP to Ado-CBI-P proceeds via a phosphoramidate-linked, CobU~GMP intermediate. The characterization of homogeneous CobU protein includes an analysis of substrate specificity, physical characteristics, and kinetic parameters.Results from previous genetic studies suggested that oxygen negatively affected CobU activity and that the corrinoid substrate utilized by CobU was also affected by molecular oxygen in the environment(6O'Toole G.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6328-6336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, it appeared that under aerobic conditions CobU could utilize Ado-CBI only as its corrinoids substrate. These results contrasted with the ability of this enzyme to utilize either Ado-CBI or HO-CBI (i.e. nonadenosylated CBI) under anaerobic conditions (6O'Toole G.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6328-6336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The in vitro data presented support the hypothesis that the preferred corrinoid substrate for the CobU enzyme is Ado-CBI. HO-CBI can also serve as substrate, albeit poorly. We document oxygen lability of the kinase and guanylyltransferase activities of CobU, both of which can be restored by DTT. Chemical modification of sulfhydryl groups with DTNB or NEM strongly suggested that CobU activities require one or more of the 4 cysteinyl residues present in the protein.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacteria, Culture Media, and Growth ConditionsAll bacterial strains used were derivatives of S. typhimurium strain LT2, and their genotypes are listed in Table 1.

Mid-log phase cultures (~60 Klett units) were shifted to 42°C for 40 min, followed by a shift to 37°C for 12-16 h. Best expression was obtained when incubations (at 37°C and 42°C) were performed in water baths maintained in a 37°C walk-in incubator.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Recombinant DNA TechniquesUnless otherwise noted, all protocols for DNA manipulation were as previously reported(5O'Toole G.A.

In pJO52, cobU is expressed under control of the phage T7 promoter and ribosome binding site.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Synthesis of CobU Corrinoid SubstratesHO-CBIHO-CBI was synthesized and quantitated as reported without modification(10Vitols E. Walker G.A. Huennekens F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 1455-1461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Ado-CBIAdo-CBI was synthesized enzymically using a modification of the reported protocol(11Debussche L. Couder M. Thibaut D. Cameron B. Crouzet J. Blanche F. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6300-6302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Suh S.-J. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 921-925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained Tris-HCl, 0.2 M, pH 8.0, at 37°C; MnCl2, 200 mM; ATP, 400 mM; CoCl2, 420 μM; (CN)2-CBI, 150 mM. The reaction mixture was made anoxic by bubbling with oxygen-free N2 gas. A 5-ml sample of the reaction mixture was added to a 25-ml anoxic serum vial containing KBH4 (0.5 mmol). The vial was kept on ice for approximately 5 min or until the solution turned a black-gray-green color. Crude cell-free extract (approximately 0.2-0.3 mg of protein) made from a strain overexpressing CobA (JE2018) was added, and the vial was transferred to a 37°C water bath. The reaction mixture was incubated for 2 h, then filtered to stop the reaction and remove particulates. The reaction mixture was then loaded onto a 3.5 × 2.5-cm column of the reverse phase resin LiChroprep RP-18 (EM Separations, Gibbstown, NJ) previously equilibrated with H2O. The column was washed with 10 bed volumes of H2O, then washed with 2 bed volumes of 100% methanol to elute the Ado-CBI. The sample was concentrated under vacuum (SpeedVac concentrator, Savant Instruments, Farmingdale, NY). All the manipulations were performed in the dark or in dim light to avoid photolysis of the C-Co bond.The UV-visible spectrum of Ado-CBI showed no significant absorbance at 525 nM, indicating quantitative conversion of (CN)2CBI to Ado-CBI (data not shown). The extinction coefficient of Ado-CBI in H2O at 457 nm was calculated to be 4,526 M-1 cm-1. Absorption maxima in H2O were observed at 305 and 457 nm.Synthesis of Radiolabeled Ado-CBI-PThis compound was synthesized in vitro, utilizing the ATP:CBI kinase assay described below. CobU enzyme was added in excess (2.25 μg) to a scaled-up reaction mixture (1 ml) containing [γ-32P]ATP, specific radioactivity = 10 Ci mmol-1 (DuPont NEN), and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 120 min. Radiolabeled Ado-CBI-32P was separated from unreacted [γ-32P]ATP by reverse phase chromatography on LiChroprep RP-18 as described above. Specific radioactivity was determined to be 0.0039 Ci mmol-1. These reaction conditions resulted in quantitative conversion of Ado-CBI to Ado-CBI-P. Unlabeled Ado-CBI-P was generated as described above, except the radiolabeled ATP was replaced with unlabeled ATP.In Vitro Assays for CobU ActivitiesATP:Ado-CBI Kinase AssayThe assay for kinase activity was a modification of a reported protocol(3Blanche F. Debussche L. Famechon A. Thibaut D. Cameron B. Crouzet J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6052-6057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained Tris-HCl, 0.1 M, pH 8.8, at 37°C; MgCl2, 2.5 mM; ATP, 2 mM; [γ-32P]ATP, 9.96 μM, specific radioactivity = 10 Ci mmol-1; Ado-CBI, 180 μM; protein, 0.1-0.4 μg; final volume, 20 μl. The reaction mix lacking ATP was prepared on ice and preincubated for 5 min at 37°C; the reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP and terminated by the addition of 20 μl of 20 mM KCN followed by a 10-min incubation at 80°C. Samples were centrifuged at 15,850 × g for 10 min in a Marathon 13K/M microcentrifuge (Fisher), and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube. One unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to synthesize 1 nmol of Ado-CBI-P/min. Specific activity was defined as units/mg of protein.As shown below, ATP did not serve as an efficient substrate for the transferase activity of CobU. Therefore, in the absence of GTP, the conditions for the Ado-CBI kinase assay allowed us to document the synthesis of the intermediate Ado-CBI-P.GTP:Ado-CBI Kinase, Ado-CBI-P Guanylyltransferase Assay (Protocol A)This assay was a modification of a reported protocol(3Blanche F. Debussche L. Famechon A. Thibaut D. Cameron B. Crouzet J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6052-6057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mix contained Tris-HCl, 0.1 M, pH 8.8, at 37°C; MgCl2, 2.5 mM; GTP, 2 mM; [γ-32P]GTP, 3.34 μM, specific radioactivity = 30 Ci mmol-1 (DuPont NEN); Ado-CBI, 180 μM; protein, 0.1-0.4 μg; final volume, 20 μl. The reaction mix was handled as described above. One unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to synthesize 1 nmol of Ado-CBI-GDP/min. GTP served as a substrate for both the kinase and transferase reactions (see below). Therefore, this assay allowed a convenient means to monitor the conversion of Ado-CBI to Ado-CBI-GDP. This assay was used to monitor the activity of fractions during the purification of CobU.GTP:Ado-CBI-P Guanylyltransferase Assay (Protocol B)The reaction mix contained Tris-HCl, 0.1 M, pH 8.8, at 37°C; MgCl2, 2.5 mM; GTP (or indicated nucleotide), 150 μM; Ado-CBI-32P, 300 μM, specific radioactivity = 0.0039 Ci mmol-1; enzyme, 0.1-0.4 μg in a final volume of 20 μl. The reaction mix was handled as described above. One unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to synthesize 1 nmol of Ado-CBI-GDP/min.Quantitation of Ado-CBI-P and Ado-CBI-GDPIn all assays, radiolabeled substrates were diluted with a known amount of unlabeled substrates. To quantitate the amount of product synthesized, the radiolabel incorporated into the product was determined (see below) and adjusted for decay of the radioactivity and counting efficiency of the scintillation counter. The total product synthesized in each assay was calculated using the known ratio of radiolabeled to unlabeled compound, and the specific activity of the radiolabeled compound used.Protein Concentration AssayPreliminary protein concentrations were determined by a modification of the turbidimetric method reported by Kunitz(13Kunitz M.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1952; 35: 423-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). More accurate determinations of protein concentrations were achieved by the BCA method (14Smith P. Krohn R. Hermanson A. Mallia A. Gartner F. Provenzano M. Fujimoto E. Goeke N. Olson B. Klenl D. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18445) Google Scholar) using a commercially available kit from Pierce Chemical Co. (Rockford, IL).Identification of Products of the CobU-catalyzed ReactionsTo identify the products of the CobU-catalyzed kinase and guanylyltransferase reactions, the CobU assay reaction mixtures described above were increased to 100 μl, Ado-CBI was increased to 0.4 mM, in a reaction mixture which contained only unlabeled nucleotide triphosphates. Following a 4-h incubation at 37°C, products were derivatized to their dicyano forms and purified and analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Purified CobU enzyme (94% homogeneous) was used in these reactions.Chromatographic MethodsHPLCProducts of the large scale CobU-catalyzed reactions were purified by HPLC. The chromatograph used was a computer-controlled Waters model 990 Plus equipped with a photodiode array detector and a model 600 multisolvent delivery system (Waters, Milford, MA).Purification of (CN)2CBI-PEnzymically synthesized Ado-CBI-P was converted to its dicyano derivative (CN)2CBI by addition of an equal volume of 20 mM KCN and heating at 80°C for 10 min, and purified in two steps. In System 1, the sample was loaded on a BIOSEP-DEAE-P (75 mm × 7.8 mm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) column equilibrated with potassium phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 6.5) containing 10 mM KCN. The column was washed for 3 min with equilibration buffer, then developed with a 30 min concave gradient (curve 8) of NaCl from 0 to 600 mM in the potassium phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 6.5) containing 10 mM KCN. The column was washed with 800 mM NaCl in potassium phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 6.5) containing 10 mM KCN for 5 min after the completion of the gradient. Elution of (CN)2CBI-P was monitored at 365 nM and the flow rate was 0.3 ml min-1. In System 2, the column described above was equilibrated with potassium phosphate buffer (0.05 M, pH 6.5) containing 5 mM KCN, and developed with an isocratic system of potassium phosphate buffer (0.05 M, pH 6.5) containing 5 mM KCN at a flow rate of 1 ml min-1.Purification of (CN)2CBI-GDPThe purification of (CN)2CBI-GDP was performed as reported without modifications(5O'Toole G.A. Rondon M.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3317-3326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Paper ChromatographyThe substrates and products of assays were routinely resolved by ascending paper chromatography on Whatman No. 1 paper (Whatman) in a solvent system of isobutyric acid-water-ammonia (66:33:1)(15Ronzio R.A. Barker H.A. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 2344-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The solvent front was allowed to migrate between 10 and 15 cm, the paper was dried, and an autoradiograph was prepared. Using the autoradiograph as a guide, each radioactive spot was cut from the chromatograph for quantitation (Packard Tri-Carb 4530, United Technologies, Packard Instruments, Inc., Downers Grove, IL; counting efficiency estimated at 95% for 32P) in Poly-Fluor (Packard, Meriden, CT) as the scintillation mixture. In some experiments, the relative radioactivity of each radioactive spot was determined by analysis with a PhosphorImager (445I, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA).Spectroscopic AnalysisUV-visible spectroscopy and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry were performed as reported elsewhere(1Trzebiatowski J.R.

The native pI of CobU was determined as reported elsewhere(21Bollag D.M. Edelstein S.J. Protein Methods. John Wiley & Sons, New York1991: 162-180Google Scholar).Purification of CobUAll purification steps were performed at 4°C.Step 1: Preparation of Cell-free ExtractsCells obtained from 18 liters of the CobU overexpressing strain JE3207 were harvested and resuspended in Tris-HCl, 0.1 M, pH 8.0 at 4°C containing DTT, 10 mM. Cells were broken by sonication (Branson Ultrasonics Corp., Danbury, CT) at setting 7, 50% duty cycle. Sonication was performed six times at 5-min intervals, and the sample was allowed to cool to less than 15°C before resuming sonication. Cell debris was cleared from the extracts by centrifugation at 43,140 × g for 1.5 h (Sorvall RC-5B refrigerated centrifuge, DuPont Instruments, Wilmington, DE). Serine protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was then added to a final concentration of 1 mM.Step 2: Hydrophobic Interaction ChromatographyFinely ground Ultrapure ammonium sulfate (Schwarz/Mann, ICN Biomedicals Inc., Cleveland, OH) was added to crude cell-free extract to 1% saturation. The extract was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min to remove precipitates. The resulting supernatant was loaded onto a 35-ml bed volume phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B column (Sigma) equilibrated at 4°C with 1% ammonium sulfate in Tris-HCl, 0.1 M, pH 8.0 at 4°C, containing 10 mM DTT. The column was washed with 3 bed volumes of the equilibration buffer. CobU was eluted with 50% ethylene glycol in Tris-HCl, 0.1 M, pH 8.0 at 4°C, containing 10 mM DTT. The flow rate of the column was 30 ml h-1.Step 3: Dye Ligand ChromatographyDye ligand chromatography was used as a negative purification step. Pooled fractions from the phenyl-Sepharose column were dialyzed against Tris-HCl, 0.1 M, pH 8.0 at 4°C, with 10 mM DTT to remove ethylene glycol. A 15-ml column of Cibacron blue type 3000 (Sigma) was equilibrated with Tris-HCl, 0.1 M, pH 8.0 at 4°C containing 10 mM DTT plus 5 mM MgCl2. The dialyzed CobU-containing sample was loaded onto the column at a flow rate of 15 ml h-1. CobU was recovered from the flow-through and the first bed volume of the wash buffer.Step 5: Anion Exchange ChromatographyThe pooled CobU-containing samples from the previous step was loaded onto a 20-ml column of DEAE Sephadex A-25 equilibrated with Tris-HCl, 0.1 M, pH 8.0, at 4°C containing 10 mM DTT, at a flow rate of 15 ml h-1. The column was washed with 2 bed volumes of the equilibration buffer, and eluted with a 5 × bed volume gradient of 0-0.5 M NaCl in the same buffer. CobU activity eluted when the salt concentration was between 300 and 500 mM NaCl and in the 500 mM NaCl wash (data not shown).RESULTSOverexpression and Visualization of CobUExpression of the cobU gene and its gene product was cloned under the control of a strong phage T7 promoter and ribosome binding site.

https://openalex.org/W2017028717,"The c-myb gene is primarily expressed in immature hematopoietic cells, and it is overexpressed in many leukemias. We have investigated the role of negative regulatory sites in the c-myb promoter in the Molt-4 T cell line and in the DHL-9 B cell line. A potential binding site for either the EGR-1 or WT1 protein was identified by in vivo footprinting in the 5′-flanking region of c-myb in a region of negative regulatory activity in T cells. We showed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay Western that WT1, EGR-1, and Sp1 bound to this site. A mutation of this site which prevented protein binding increased the activity of the c-myb promoter by 2.5-fold. In the DHL-9 B cell line, this site was nonfunctional; however, we found a potential EGR-1/WT1 site located more 3′ in a region of negative regulatory activity. We showed that WT1, EGR-1, and Sp1 bound to this site, and that mutation of this site increased the activity of the c-myb promoter by 3.2-fold. Cotransfection of a WT1 expression vector repressed the activity of the c-myb promoter in both cell lines, and this repression was relieved when the EGR-1/WT1 sites were removed. Cotransfection of either an EGR-1 or Sp1 expression vector had no significant effect on the activity of the c-myb promoter. We conclude that WT1 is a negative regulator of c-myb expression in both T and B cell lines.

INTRODUCTIONThe c-myb protooncogene is the cellular homologue of the avian myeloblastosis virus and avian leukemia virus (E26) transforming genes(1Baluda M.A. Goetz I.E. Virology. 1961; 15: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 2Moscovici C. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1975; 71: 79-96PubMed Google Scholar). Myb is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein with the ability to transactivate promoters with the specific consensus sequence PyAAC(G/T)G(3Biedenkapp H. Borgmeyer U. Sippel A.E. Klempnauer K.H. Nature. 1988; 335: 835-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 4Ness S.A. Marknell A. Graf T. Cell. 1989; 59: 1115-1125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Reduction of c-myb expression results in a block to hematopoietic precursor cell proliferation(5Gewirtz A.M. Calabretta B. Science. 1988; 242: 1303-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), and homozygous c-myb mutant mice demonstrate greatly impaired fetal hepatic hematopoiesis(6Mucenski M.L. McLain K. Kier A.B.

The importance of the c-myb gene product in leukemic cell proliferation is demonstrated by the inhibition of cellular proliferation by c-myb antisense oligonucleotides(7Anfossi G. Gewirtz A.M. Calabretta B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3379-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Leukemic cells were shown to be more sensitive to this inhibitory effect than normal hematopoietic cells(8Calabretta B. Sims R.B. Valtier M. Caracciolo D. Szcylik C. Venturelli D. Ratajczak M. Beran M. Gewirtz A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2351-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar).The central role that c-Myb plays in the regulation of hematopoietic cell development has fueled research into the regulation of its expression. The regulation of c-myb expression appears to be complex and occurs at several levels. An important mechanism for regulation of mouse c-myb expression is a block to transcription elongation within the first intron of the c-myb locus, recognized as a pause site(9Bender T. Thompson C. Kuehl W. Science. 1987; 237: 1473-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 10Watson R. Oncogene. 1988; 8: 267-272Google Scholar, 11Watson R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3938-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A correlation between protein binding to the intron 1 pause site and c-myb mRNA levels has been demonstrated using DNA mobility shift assays(12Reddy C. Reddy E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7326-7330Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).It has been shown that in vitro translated c-Myb can bind to Myb binding sequences found in the c-myb 5′-flanking region and that in cotransfection studies c-Myb is involved in positive autoregulation of the c-myb gene in hamster fibroblasts (13Nicolaides N. Gualdi R. Casadevall C. Manzella L. Calabretta B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6166-6176Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Recent studies conducted in mouse T cell lines suggest that murine c-myb expression is dependent on a GC-rich sequence of the 5′-flanking region and that the c-myb promoter is functional in diverse T cell lines(14Mountz J.D. Subler M.A. Mol. Immunol. 1993; 30: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). We have shown that two Myb binding sites function as negative regulators of c-myb expression in T cell lines(15Guerra J. Withers D.A. Boxer L.M. Blood. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies of the regulation of expression of c-myb have shown that c-Jun and JunD are positive regulators of the c-myb promoter in hamster fibroblasts. A second promoter in the 3′ end of intron 1 has been identified recently(16Jacobs S.M. Gorse K.M. Westin E.H.

Helinski, UCSD). The fragment was cloned into pUC18 and subsequently recut as a HindIII-KpnI fragment and ligated into the multiple cloning site of Bluescript II KS+. The 2.3-kilobase EcoRI-EcoRI 5′-flanking region of human c-myb (a kind gift from R. Dalla-Favera, Columbia) was ligated into the EcoRI site 5′ of the luciferase gene in Bluescript. To remove a confounding ATG site, the HindIII-NcoI fragment was removed, HindIII linkers were added, and the plasmid was religated. A deletion of the 5′-flanking region was made using a unique BamHI restriction site located at −910 from the ATG codon. Further deletions were made using Bal31 endonuclease. Deletions were made at 30-s intervals from BamHI-linearized plasmid. The deleted end was then treated with Klenow polymerase, cut with HindIII, and separated by gel electrophoresis. A vector was prepared by removing the HindIII/NotI (NotI site treated with Klenow polymerase) fragment of the luciferase/Bluescript construct, and the fragment and luciferase vector were ligated. Other deletions at specific locations were made by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 1The abbreviations used are: PCRpolymerase chain reactionEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assay. and confirmed by sequence analysis.The WT1, EGR-1, and Sp1 expression vectors consisted of the full-length coding region of each gene under the control of the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter(21Patwardhan S.

Binding conditions were as follows: 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 0.5 ng of 104 cpm end-labeled DNA oligonucleotide probe, and 5-15 μg of protein from crude nuclear extract. The binding reaction was conducted at room temperature for 15 min, and the samples were then loaded onto a 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA, 5% polyacrylamide gel. The samples were electrophoresed at 30 mA at 4°C. For the competition studies, a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide was added to the binding reaction.Gel Shift WesternEMSA was carried out as described above. The complexes were transferred to stacked nitrocellulose and DEAE-membranes as described(29Demczuk S. Harbers M. Vennstrom B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For protein detection, the nitrocellulose membrane was processed as recommended by Amersham for enhanced chemiluminescence. The rabbit polyclonal antibodies against WT1, EGR-1, and Sp1 (from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used at a dilution of 1:1000.Transfections and Luciferase AssaysTransfections were performed on cells in log phase.

The cells were then incubated again for 10 min at room temperature. Transfected cells were cultured in 10 ml of supplemented RPMI for 48 h.Cell lysis and luciferase assays were conducted according to the protocol and with reagents supplied with Promega's Luciferase Assay System. Luciferase measurements were performed on an LKB 1251 luminometer. The Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat-β-galactosidase plasmid was used to control for variations in transfection efficiency.

A protected region extended from −630 to −621 in Molt-4 cells (all numbers are relative to the translation start site) (Fig. 1). This sequence is identical with the EGR-1/WT1 consensus binding site. In the B cell line, DHL-9, this region did not show any protection, but a similar sequence extending from −455 to −446 was protected (Fig. 2). This site differs by one base from the EGR-1/WT1 consensus binding sequence. We also found that the −455 to −446 sequence was not protected in Molt-4 cells.Figure 1:In vivo footprint analysis by ligation-mediated PCR of a region of the c-myb 5′-flanking region (5′ EGR-1/WT1 site) in Molt-4 and DHL-9 cells.

The activities of several of these constructs in Molt-4 cells are shown in Fig. 3A. A region of negative regulatory activity was observed between −632 and −594. The EGR-1/WT1 binding site is located in this region. To determine whether this site was responsible for the negative activity of this region, we made a construct with a mutated EGR-1/WT1 site. As shown in Fig. 3B, the activity of the promoter construct with the mutated EGR-1/WT1 site increased by approximately 2.5-fold. The increase in activity with mutation of the EGR-1/WT1 site accounted for essentially all of the negative regulatory activity in this region.Figure 3:Activity of the c-myb promoter in Molt-4 cells.

To determine whether this was a functional site, the sequence was mutated. As shown in Fig. 4B, the activity of the promoter construct with the mutated site increased by approximately 3.2-fold.

Boxer, unpublished data. To determine whether WT1 bound to the two sites, EMSAs were performed. Three complexes of altered mobility were formed with each site, and the mobility of each complex appeared to be the same with both sites (Fig. 5A). Cross-competition studies demonstrated that the 5′ site competed against the 3′ site and vice versa (Fig. 5A). We confirmed that the mutated sites did not compete against the complexes formed with the wild-type sequences and that the mutated sites did not yield EMSA complexes similar to those with the wild-type sequences (Fig. 5B).Figure 5:EMSA of the EGR-1/WT1 sites with Molt-4 and DHL-9 nuclear extracts.

As seen in Fig. 6, A and B, the fastest migrating complex reacted with a WT1 antibody. These results suggested that the WT1 protein was found in the fastest migrating EMSA complex.

The deletion constructs of the c-myb promoter were cotransfected with a WT1 expression vector or with the empty expression vector at a ratio of 1:1. As shown in Fig. 7A, cotransfection of the WT1 expression vector in Molt 4 cells repressed the c-myb promoter until the WT1 site was removed in the −594 construct. Similarly, in DHL-9 cells, cotransfection of the WT1 expression vector repressed the c-myb promoter until the functional WT1 site was removed in the −444 construct. These results demonstrate that increased levels of WT1 protein repress the activity of the c-myb promoter. As shown in Fig. 7C, cotransfection of either an EGR-1 or Sp1 expression vector had no significant effect on the c-myb promoter activity in Molt-4 cells. Similar results were obtained in the DHL-9 cell line (Fig. 7D).Figure 7:Cotransfection of WT1, EGR-1, and Sp1 with the c-myb promoter constructs.

We have shown previously that two Myb binding sites in the 5′-flanking region are negative regulators of c-myb expression in T cells(15Guerra J. Withers D.A. Boxer L.M. Blood. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). We have now characterized another negative regulatory region of the c-myb promoter and have shown by cotransfection experiments that WT1 is a negative regulator of c-myb expression in T cells. Mutation of this site increased c-myb expression by 2.5-fold. Mutation of the two Myb binding sites increased expression by 1.85-fold(15Guerra J. Withers D.A. Boxer L.M. Blood. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar); together, the deletion of the Myb and WT1 sites brings the c-myb promoter activity to its maximal value. These results suggest that these sites are major negative regulatory sites for the c-myb promoter in T cells.We have shown by EMSA and Western analysis that the WT1 protein binds to this site in the c-myb promoter. Three bands of altered mobility are observed with both WT1 site oligonucleotides. We have demonstrated that WT1 protein is found in the fastest migrating band. The EGR-1 protein is located in the intermediate complex, and Sp1 is found in the slowest migrating EMSA complex.The 5′ EGR-1/WT1 site was not functional in the DHL-9 B cell line. A region of negative regulatory activity was mapped farther 3′ in the promoter. A potential binding site for EGR-1/WT1, which differed from the consensus sequence by one base, was located in this region. We demonstrated that WT1, EGR-1, and Sp1 bound to this site by EMSA and by Western analysis. This site is identical with the B2 site in the insulin-like growth factor II gene which binds purified WT1 protein (33Drummond I.A. Rupprecht H.D. Rohwer-Nutter P. Lopez-Guisa J.M. Madden S.L. Rauscher III, F.J. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3800-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Increased expression of WT1 in both DHL-9 and Molt-4 cells led to repression of the c-myb promoter while cotransfection of EGR-1 or Sp1 expression vectors had little effect.In vivo footprinting by ligation-mediated PCR demonstrated that the 5′ EGR-1/WT1 site was protected in Molt-4 cells and that the 3′ EGR-1/WT1 site was protected in DHL-9 cells. We had initially thought that the EGR-1 protein might be responsible for the in vivo footprints because it is a transcriptional activator and the c-myb gene is expressed at moderately high levels in both cell lines. Our transient transfection experiments demonstrated that both the 5′ and 3′ EGR-1/WT1 sites were negative regulatory elements in the Molt-4 and DHL-9 cell lines, respectively. Although we cannot be certain that the in vivo footprints represent binding of WT1 and not EGR-1 or Sp1 to these sites, the fact that the sites are negative regulatory elements makes it more likely that WT1 is responsible for this activity. In addition, we demonstrated that cotransfection of a WT1 expression vector with the c-myb promoter-luciferase constructs caused repression of luciferase activity while EGR-1 and Sp1 expression vectors had no significant effect.It has been shown previously that WT1 represses a platelet-derived growth factor gene(34Gashler A.L.

It is interesting to note that WT1 has been shown to regulate negatively genes that encode positive regulators of cell growth. Both WT1 and c-Myb are expressed in immature hematopoietic cells. We have now demonstrated by cotransfection experiments that the c-myb gene, which also encodes a protein involved in cell proliferation, is negatively regulated by the WT1 protein in T and B cell lines.In summary, we have characterized several negative regulatory factors involved in the control of c-myb expression in both B and T cell lines. In T cells, both Myb and WT1 are negative regulators, while in B cells WT1 is a negative regulator of c-myb expression. We have preliminary evidence that the positive regulators of c-myb expression differ in T versus B cell lines as well INTRODUCTIONThe c-myb protooncogene is the cellular homologue of the avian myeloblastosis virus and avian leukemia virus (E26) transforming genes(1Baluda M.A. Goetz I.E.

The importance of the c-myb gene product in leukemic cell proliferation is demonstrated by the inhibition of cellular proliferation by c-myb antisense oligonucleotides(7Anfossi G. Gewirtz A.M.

Leukemic cells were shown to be more sensitive to this inhibitory effect than normal hematopoietic cells(8Calabretta B. Sims R.B. Valtier M. Caracciolo D. Szcylik C. Venturelli D. Ratajczak M.

The regulation of c-myb expression appears to be complex and occurs at several levels. An important mechanism for regulation of mouse c-myb expression is a block to transcription elongation within the first intron of the c-myb locus, recognized as a pause site(9Bender T. Thompson C. Kuehl W. Science. 1987; 237: 1473-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 10Watson R. Oncogene. 1988; 8: 267-272Google Scholar, 11Watson R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3938-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A correlation between protein binding to the intron 1 pause site and c-myb mRNA levels has been demonstrated using DNA mobility shift assays(12Reddy C. Reddy E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7326-7330Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).It has been shown that in vitro translated c-Myb can bind to Myb binding sequences found in the c-myb 5′-flanking region and that in cotransfection studies c-Myb is involved in positive autoregulation of the c-myb gene in hamster fibroblasts (13Nicolaides N. Gualdi R. Casadevall C. Manzella L. Calabretta B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6166-6176Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Recent studies conducted in mouse T cell lines suggest that murine c-myb expression is dependent on a GC-rich sequence of the 5′-flanking region and that the c-myb promoter is functional in diverse T cell lines(14Mountz J.D. Subler M.A. Mol. Immunol. 1993; 30: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). We have shown that two Myb binding sites function as negative regulators of c-myb expression in T cell lines(15Guerra J. Withers D.A. Boxer L.M. Blood. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies of the regulation of expression of c-myb have shown that c-Jun and JunD are positive regulators of the c-myb promoter in hamster fibroblasts. A second promoter in the 3′ end of intron 1 has been identified recently(16Jacobs S.M. Gorse K.M. Westin E.H.

This [Ca2+]i increase is mediated partly by the RGD-containing domain of thrombospondin that binds to the integrin αvβ3 as demonstrated by inhibitor studies using anti-αvβ3 antibody and RGD-containing peptides. A non-RGD and non-αvβ3 component of this [Ca2+]i increase is mediated by the carboxyl-terminal domain of thrombospondin through an unidentified receptor on fibroblasts as shown by the antibody to the carboxyl-terminal of thrombospondin, C6.7. In addition, the carboxyl-terminal derived peptide, RFYVVMWK, also triggers [Ca2+]i increase in ∼35% of fibroblasts. Both EGTA and Ni2+ block the entire [Ca2+]i increase indicating that this is due to an influx of extracellular Ca2+. B6H12, an antibody to the integrin-associated protein, blocks this [Ca2+]iincrease by 50%, suggesting that some of the Ca2+ might be entering through an integrin-associated calcium channel. The current findings demonstrate that multiple domains on thrombospondin can trigger signal transduction events by increasing [Ca2+]i through their interactions with different cell receptors."

In the macromolecular network of collagen IV, two molecules are connected via their NC1 domains, which form a hexameric complex, stabilized by intermolecular disulfide bonds. In addition, the NC1 domains are thought to be responsible for chain selection and assembly. In order to understand the role of the NC1 domains during these steps, hexameric complexes were isolated and further investigated. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot revealed disulfide-linked α1(IV)NC1 and α2(IV)NC1 homodimers but no heterodimers. The hexamers were dissociated at low pH, separated into monomers and dimers, and submitted to reconstitution experiments. Only α1(IV)NC1 dimers were able to reconstitute a hexameric complex. α1(IV)NC1 and α2(IV)NC1 monomers as well as the α2(IV)NC1 dimers showed only a low tendency to form complexes. It is assumed that during formation of the collagen IV network, lateral aggregation of the molecules via the triple helical domains brings the C termini of two molecules into close vicinity and that subsequently the weak interactions observed between the NC1 subdomains provide the correct alignment for a disulfide exchange. It is, however, questionable whether the low affinity between the NC1 subdomains alone is sufficient for chain assembly and alignment of the α(IV) chains before molecule formation.

The majority of amino acids in hIL-315-125 could be substituted without substantial loss of activity. Substitution of residues predicted to be in the hydrophobic core of the protein often resulted in reduced activity and/or low accumulation levels. Only five residues predicted to be on the surface of the protein were intolerant of substitution and hence are candidates for sites of interaction with the receptor.

In particular, mutagenesis of the adjacent helices A and D indicate that these regions are important for interaction with the receptor.

Devine C.S. Rangwala S.H. Kavka K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 73: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The hIL-3 gene (35Yang Y. Clarlettta A.B. Temple P.A. Chung M.P. Kovacic S.

Rangwala S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Human IL-3 and hIL-3 variants were expressed with an initiator methionine followed by an alanine at the N terminus of the genes. The initiator methionine was removed in E. coli by methionine aminopeptidase (data not shown). Production of hIL-3 in cultures of JM101 cells ((37Messing J. Recombinant DNA Technical Bulletin, NIH publication 77-99. Vol. 2.

Devine C.S. Rangwala S.H. Kavka K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 73: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). For measurements of the solubility of hIL-3 variants, cell pellets from induced cultures were lysed by sonication(38Easton A.M. Gierse J.K. Seetharam R. Klein B.K. Kotts C.E. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 101: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), and the proteins were fractionated by centrifugation.Production of hIL-315-125Variants in the Periplasm of E. colihIL-315-125 variants were produced in the periplasm of E. coli JM101 using a secretion vector(39Lee S.C. Olins P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2849-2852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These plasmids contained the E. coli araBAD promoter (40Greenfield L. Boone T. Wilcox G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4724-4728Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) governing expression of fusions of the LamB signal peptide to hIL-3 variants. Culture growth was performed as described previously (36Olins P.O. Rangwala S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) except that the medium contained 0.2% glycerol in place of glucose. Arabinose was added to cultures to a final concentration of 0.05% to induce expression from paraBAD, and cultures were grown at 30°C for a further 3-4 h.Osmotic Shock Release of Secreted hIL-315-125from E. coliThe osmotic shock method used was similar to that of Neu and Heppel(41Neu H.C. Heppel L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 3685-3692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 1-ml aliquot of cells was harvested by centrifugation for 5 min at 5,400 × g. The pellet was resuspended gently by pipetting in 500 μl of a room temperature sucrose solution (20% sucrose (w/v), 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA). Following a 10-min incubation at room temperature, the cells were spun for 10 min at 8,400 × g. The sucrose fraction was carefully removed from the cell pellet and saved. The cells in the pellets were then resuspended gently by pipetting in 500 μl of ice-cold water. Following a 10-min incubation on ice, the cells were spun for 10 min at 14,200 × g. The supernatant water fraction was carefully removed and saved. Equal volumes of the sucrose and water fractions were pooled and used in the hIL-3 ELISA and AML cell proliferation assay. Some cultures and fractions were analyzed by immunoblots (34Olins P.O. Devine C.S. Rangwala S.H. Kavka K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 73: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) using a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against an hIL-315-125 peptide. The level of loading on the gel was normalized to the densities of the cultures, and protein corresponding to 4 Klett units was loaded in each lane.Two-step Site-directed PCR MutagenesisLibraries of all 19 possible single-site variants were constructed at each position from residues 17-123 in the hIL-315-125 molecule, using two PCR mutagenesis steps. This two-step approach facilitated the rapid identification of single amino acid substitutions using differential DNA hybridization. Libraries at positions 94-105 were created from an intermediate plasmid that contained a 12-base replacement. This approach for the creation of a library at residue 105 is illustrated (see Fig. 2a). In the first mutagenesis step, one of the PCR primers replaced codons 102-105 in the hIL-315-125 gene with 12 bases encoding two translation stop codons and six additional bases (5′-TAATAAGTCGAC-3′). The reverse PCR primer was complementary to the 5′-end of the hIL-315-125 gene. Plasmid DNA containing the hIL-315-125 gene in a secretion expression vector served as the template in the PCR reaction. PCR mutagenesis (42Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13398) Google Scholar) was performed using reagent kits, and thermal cycler from Perkin-Elmer Cetus. Primer extension was carried out using 20 pmol of each oligonucleotide and 0.5 pmol of template plasmid DNA for 35 cycles (94°C for 1 min, 50°C for 2 min and 72°C for 3 min). The PCR-generated DNA product was extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. The DNA was digested with NcoI and EcoRI and ligated into the corresponding restriction sites in the hIL-315-125 secretion plasmid. The resulting “intermediate plasmid” served as the template in the second mutagenesis step. The 12-base segment described above was restored with a PCR primer encoding the parental DNA sequence at codons 102-104 and a 32-fold degeneracy at codon 105. The degenerate oligonucleotides were synthesized to have G, A, T, or C (in equal proportions) in the first and second positions and G or C in the third position of the codon. The reverse PCR primer was complementary to the 5′-end of the hIL-315-125 gene. The PCR reaction mixture was purified as above, digested with NcoI and EcoRI, and ligated into the corresponding sites of the intermediate plasmid. Single colonies were selected at random and grown in liquid culture in a 96-well plate format. Plasmid DNA was prepared from the resulting cultures in a 96-well format and DNA dot-blot hybridization was used to distinguish mutants from parental plasmids using a probe specific for the parental plasmid. This process was repeated in a similar manner to create libraries of mutants at positions 94-104. A limited number of positive clones from the hybridization screen were sequenced to confirm the quality of the libraries.Libraries at positions 17-93 and 106-123 were created using intermediate plasmids that contained an 18-base deletion. This approach for the creation of a library at a single position, residue 71, is illustrated (see Fig. 2b). Again, a two-step PCR mutagenesis approach was used, but in this case, the first mutagnesis step led to an intermediate plasmid with a portion of the coding region deleted. In the second step, the mutagenic PCR primer encoded the parental DNA sequence at codons 72-76 and a 32-fold degeneracy at residue 71. Similarly, the same intermediate plasmid was used for creation of libraries at residues 72-76. Other intermediate plasmids carrying 6-codon deletions throughout the remainder of the hIL-315-125 (residues 17-22, 23-28, 29-34, 35-40, 41-46, 47-52, 53-58, 59-64, 65-70, 71-76, 77-82, 83-88, 88-93, 106-111, 112-117, and 118-123) were constructed and used as templates for the remaining libraries.Mutants from each library were selected at random and identified by DNA sequencing. In addition, a small number of selected single-site mutants were constructed by substitution of a portion of the gene with appropriate synthetic oligonucleotides.hIL-3 ELISAConcentrations of hIL-3 variants in osmotic shock fractions were determined using a sandwich ELISA. Dynatech Immulon II microtiter plates were coated with affinity-purified polyclonal goat-anti-hIL-3 (see below) at 1 μg/ml in 100 mM NaHCO3, pH 8.2. Plates were incubated overnight at room temperature in a humidified chamber. The plates were blocked with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS) containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4, for 1 h at 37°C in a humidified chamber. Plates were then washed 4 times with 150 mM NaCl containing 0.05% Tween 20. Unknowns were serially diluted in assay buffer (Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% Tween 20, pH 7.4). A standard curve of purified recombinant hIL-3 diluted in assay buffer ranged from 0.125 to 5 ng/ml. Plates were incubated for 2.5 h at 37°C in a humidified chamber. After four washes, goat anti-hIL-3 conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was added to each plate. Plates were incubated 1.5 h at 37°C in a humidified chamber. Plates were washed 4 times and ABTS peroxidase substrate solution (Kirkegaard and Perry Labs, Gaithersburg, MD) was added. The plates were read at a test wavelength of 410 nm and a reference wavelength of 570 nm on a Dynatech microtiter plate reader (Chantilly, VA). Concentrations of hIL-3 in unknown samples were calculated from the standard curve using software supplied with the plate reader. To raise polyclonal antibodies to recombinant hIL-3, goats were initially immunized with 3 mg of purified recombinant hIL-3 in complete Freund's adjuvant. Each received two monthly boosts of 1 mg in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Thereafter, each goat was given monthly boosts with 0.25 mg of hIL-3 in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Blood was collected 10 days after each boost and allowed to coagulate at room temperature. Serum was separated from whole blood by centrifugation, sterile filtered, and stored at −70°C. Antibody titers were verified prior to purification using Ouchterlony immunodiffusion. Goat polyclonal antibodies to hIL-3 were purified from serum using an affinity chromatography column of 10 mg hIL-3 coupled to 1 ml Affi-Gel 10 agarose beads (Bio-Rad). Purified antibody was conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for use in the ELISA assay.AML193.1.3 Cell Proliferation Assay for hIL-3AML193 cells (43Santoli D. Yang Y.C. Clark S.C. Kreider B.L. Caracciolo D. Rovera G. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 3348-3354PubMed Google Scholar) were obtained from the ATCC. The cells were adapted for long term growth in hIL-3 by starving for growth factor (granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor) for 24 h and replating in media containing hIL-3 (100 units/ml, Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA). After 2 months, the cells could grow rapidly in hIL-3. These cells were designated AML193.1.3 and were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol and 4 ng/ml hIL-3. AML193.1.3 proliferation in response to hIL-3 or hIL-3 variants was determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation. Cells were seeded at 2.5 × 104/well in 96-well microtiter plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA). Human IL-3 samples were added in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 500 μg/ml bovine albumin, 100 μg/ml human transferrin, 50 μg/ml soy bean lipids (all from Boehringer Mannheim) and 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol. After 72 h, 0.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine was added to each well. After 16-24 h, the cells were harvested onto a glass fiber filter mat (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and counted in an LKB 1205 Betaplate scintillation counter (Bromma, Sweden). Osmotic shock fractions with hIL-315-125 accumulation levels greater than 1 μg/ml were tested in the AML193.1.3 bioassay, and the concentration of hIL-315-125 variants that gave 50% of maximal proliferation was determined. Each assay included secreted hIL-315-125 as an internal standard and was performed 1-7 times. All activity values were expressed relative to this control. Purified protein variants were assayed at least 3 times, and EC50 values were calculated by fitting a four-parameter logistic model to the data.Purification of hIL-3Inclusion bodies from E. coli cell pellets were isolated by sonication in 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride followed by centrifugation(38Easton A.M.

One gram of inclusion body pellet was extracted for 15-30 s with 5 ml of 6 M guanidine HCl, 50 mM CHES, pH 9.5, 20 mM dithiothreitol, using a Bio-Homogenizer. The solution was gently rocked for 2 h at 5°C and dialyzed (1,000 molecular weight cut-off) overnight at 5°C against 100 volumes of 4 M guanidine HCl, 50 mM CHES, pH 8.0. Dialysis was repeated against 2 M guanidine HCl, 50 mM CHES, pH 8.0. The protein solution was acidified by the addition of an equal volume of 40% acetonitrile (CH3CN), 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid. After clarification by centrifugation (16,000 × g for 5 min), the supernatant was loaded onto a Vydac C-18 reversed phase column (10 × 250 mm), equilibrated in 20% CH3CN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The column was eluted at 3 ml/min with a linear gradient (0.2% CH3CN/minute) between 40 and 50% CH3CN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the appropriate fractions were pooled and dried by lyophilization or in a Speed Vac concentrator. The dry powder was reconstituted with 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.5, and clarified by centrifugation (16,000 × g for 5 min). The amino acid composition and concentration of purified proteins were determined from samples that had been subjected to acid hydrolysis (6 M HCl, evacuated sealed tubes, 90 min, 150°C). All analyses were performed after postcolumn derivatization of the hydrolysates using ninhydrin as modified from (44Moore S. Steine W.H. Methods Enzymol. 1963; 6: 819-831Crossref Scopus (1564) Google Scholar). A Beckman model 6300 Autoanalyzer was employed for the actual determinations. All proteins were recovered at a purity of >90%, as determined by densitometric scanning of Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels.RESULTSN- and C-terminal Deletions of hIL-3 Define a Core Required for Full ActivityDeletions of the N and C termini of hIL-3 were constructed in order to determine the minimal protein required for full activity. The variants were expressed in the cytoplasm of E. coli, refolded in vitro, purified, and tested in the AML193.1.3 cell proliferation bioassay. As shown in Table 1, residues 15-118 were required for full activity, while C-terminal deletions extending beyond residue 118 retained less than 1% activity. Our data on the minimal size of a bioactive hIL-3 molecule differ somewhat from those of Dorssers et al.(14Dorssers L.C. Mostert M.C. Burger H. Janssen C. Lemson P.J. van Lambalgen R. Wagemaker G. van Leen R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21310-21317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) who found that hIL-315-125 retained approximately 10% bioactivity. Interestingly, we routinely found that variants lacking residues 119-133 had a 2-3-fold increase in activity.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Human IL-3 produced in the cytoplasm of E. coli accumulated as insoluble inclusion bodies and was recovered in the cell pellet (see Table 1). During the course of our deletion analysis of hIL-3, it was found that the deletion of the last eight amino acids (TTLSLAIF) resulted in approximately 50% of the hIL-3 variant fractionating in the cell supernatant rather than the cell pellet. The reason for this apparent change in solubility is unclear, but it might be due to the removal of a number of hydrophobic amino acids.Secretion of hIL-315-125in E. coliAlthough refolding and purification of cytoplasmically produced hIL-3 variants was suitable for testing a small number of proteins, it was too cumbersome for an extensive mutagenesis study. We have previously demonstrated the utility of secretion in E. coli as a route for generating soluble, correctly folded recombinant bovine somatotropin(45Klein B.K. Hill S.R. Devine C.S. Rowold E. Smith C.E. Galosy S. Olins P.O. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 869-872PubMed Google Scholar), and therefore tested whether hIL-3 could expressed as a secreted protein when fused to the E. coli LamB signal peptide. The truncated protein, hIL-315-125, could be expressed using this vector (Fig. 1a). Efficient signal processing of the LamB signal peptide was observed, releasing hIL-315-125, which was soluble and could be extracted from the periplasmic space by osmotic shock. Accurate processing of the signal peptide was confirmed by N-terminal sequence analysis. As shown in Fig. 1, b and c, the secreted hIL-315-125 had equivalent activity to cytoplasmically-produced hIL-315-125, which had been refolded, purified, and accurately quantified. Hence, secretion provided a simple route for the production of correctly folded hIL-315-125 and provided a critical tool for the extensive mutagenesis of hIL-3.Figure 1:Secretion of bioactive hIL-315-125. a, immunoblot analysis of secretion of hIL-315-125 from E. coli.

Proteins were released from E. coli by osmotic shock and assayed for bioactivity. hIL-3 immunoreactive material was quantified by ELISA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Construction and Screening of Libraries of Single-site Mutants of hIL-315-125An extensive site-directed mutagenesis of the essential portion of hIL-3 was undertaken. At the outset of this study, we wished to avoid any preconceived ideas about which residues would be important for biological activity and therefore constructed a series of 105 libraries of single-site mutants at most positions in the hIL-315-125 molecule (Fig. 2). Approximately eight mutants were selected at random from each library, and expression of the mutants in E. coli was induced by the addition of arabinose. After extracting the proteins by osmotic shock, the level of hIL-3 variant was measured by ELISA. Typically, secreted hIL-315-125 could be recovered from osmotic shock fractions of E. coli at a level of about 5-10 μg/ml. As illustrated in Fig. 1c, the secreted hIL-315-125 showed a biphasic dose-response relationship, with reduced proliferative activity at concentrations above approximately 100 pM. This effect was due to the presence of inhibitory material in the osmotic shock fraction, which was manifested at low sample dilutions (data not shown). Consequently, the bioassay screen was not used to measure potency when the concentration of hIL-3 variant was <1 μg/ml. Approximately 20% of the mutants were recovered at this level. The results of the 770 mutants characterized in this study are presented in Table 2. Substitutions were divided into three activity classes: full (≥20% specific activity of native hIL-315-125), moderate (5-19% specific activity) and low (<5%).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Most Residues in hIL-3115-125 Were Tolerant of SubstitutionA representation of the structure-function relationship for hIL-315-125 is shown in Fig. 3. As a rule of thumb, residues were considered tolerant of substitution if at least three substitutions were tested and found to have ≥5% bioactivity of the parental hIL-3"

In order to produce the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) protease for structural studies and accurate kinetic analysis, mutation of alanine 143 at an internal cleavage site was introduced to prevent autoproteolysis. The resulting soluble 29-kDa A143Q protease was purified to homogeneity as a stable single-chain protein by hydrophobic interaction and ionic-exchange chromatography. The in vivo protein substrate, assembly protein precursor, was also expressed and purified for activity studies. To develop a continuous protease assay, fluorescent synthetic peptide substrates similar to the cleavage sequence P5 to P5′ of the maturation site containing anthranilic acid and nitrotyrosine as a resonance energy transfer donor-acceptor pair were designed. Purified HCMV A143Q protease cleaved the recombinant assembly protein precursor with Km and kcat values of 3.0 ± 1.0 μM and 13.3 ± 1.6 min-1. The Km for peptide substrates is at least 45-fold higher than for the natural protein substrate, but the kcat values are similar.

The Herpesviridae family includes several human pathogenic species such as herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and −2), 1The abbreviations used are: HSV-1herpes simplex virus type-1CMVcytomegalovirusHCMVhuman cytomegalovirusORFopen reading frameDTTdithiothreitolPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisMes2-[N-morpholino]ethanesulfonic acidHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyMOPS3-[N-morpholino]propanesulfonic acidRETresonance energy transfer. cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus, and varicella-zoster virus. Viral infection by HCMV is very common, and 40-80% of population becomes infected by HCMV before adulthood(1Gold E. Nankervis G.A. Evans A.S. Viral Infections of Humans: Epidemiology and Control. 2nd Ed. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1982: 167-186Crossref Google Scholar). HCMV is a serious pathogen in immunocompromised individuals, especially those patients with AIDS, receiving organ or bone marrow transplants, or undergoing cancer chemotherapy or steroid therapy. CMV can cause damage in many organs, including the lung, retina, liver, and gastrointestinal tract. Ganciclovir and foscarnet are inhibitors of viral DNA polymerase and have been used to treat HCMV infections; however, they have the undesired side effects of nucleotide analogs(2Goodgame R.W. Ann. Intern. Med. 1993; 119: 924-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). herpes simplex virus type-1 cytomegalovirus human cytomegalovirus open reading frame dithiothreitol polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 2-[N-morpholino]ethanesulfonic acid high performance liquid chromatography 3-[N-morpholino]propanesulfonic acid resonance energy transfer. All members of the Herpesviridae family are similar at both the morphological and genomic levels. Herpesviruses contain a DNA genome of over 100 kilobases, an icosahedral capsid, and a lipoprotein envelope. The viral genome replicates inside the nucleus of infected cells and is then packaged into an intermediate capsid and followed by the acquisition of a nuclear membrane envelope and release of the virion from the infected cell. The HSV-1 assembly protein precursor, ICP35, is a major component of the intermediate capsid but is absent in mature virions(3Gibson W. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1972; 10: 1044-1052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Gibson W. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1974; 13: 155-165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Perdue M.L. Kemp M.C. Randall C.C. O'Callaghan D.J. Virology. 1974; 59: 201-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). During virion maturation, ICP35 undergoes proteolytic processing to generate the mature assembly protein that lacks approximately 20 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus. An HSV-1 temperature-sensitive mutant (ts1201) that it is defective in the processing of ICP35 has been reported by Preston et al.(6Preston V.G. Coates J.A.V. Rixon F.J. J. Virol. 1983; 45: 1056-1064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This mutant virus fails to package progeny viral DNA into virions at the nonpermissive temperature, and only empty capsids accumulate. This ts lesion was mapped to the UL26 ORF. The UL26 ORF overlaps with the ICP35 producing UL26.5 ORF, and these two ORFs are 3′-coterminal(6Preston V.G. Coates J.A.V. Rixon F.J. J. Virol. 1983; 45: 1056-1064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Liu and Roizman (7Liu F. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5149-5156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the product of the UL26 ORF is an 80-kDa protease that is responsible for the proteolytic processing of ICP35 protein. The UL26.5 promoter lies within the UL26 ORF. Translation initiation of ICP35 begins at methionine codon 307 of the 80-kDa protease. The amino acid sequence of the ICP35 is therefore identical to the carboxyl-terminal region of the 80-kDa protease. During viral replication, the 80-kDa protease cleaves both itself and ICP35 at a common maturation site approximately 5 kDa from the shared carboxyl terminus. The 80-kDa protease also undergoes a unique autoproteolytic cleavage at a release site between amino acid residues 246 and 247, resulting in the release of a 29-kDa catalytic domain. These findings, together with the recent work done with the UL26 null mutant virus (8Gao M. Matusick-Kumar L. Hurlburt W. DiTusa S.F. Newcomb W.W. Brown J.C. McCann III, P.J. Deckman I. Colonno R.J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3702-3712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that herpes proteases play a critical role in viral particle maturation and are attractive targets for anti-viral chemotherapy. The human CMV UL80 ORF was reported to share homology with HSV-1 UL26 ORF (9Chee M.S. Bankier A.T. Beck S. Bohni R. Brown C.M. Cerny R. Horsnell T. Hutchinson C.A. Kouzarides T. Martignetti J.A. Preddie E. Satchwell S.C. Tomlinson P. Weston K. Barrell B.G. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 154: 125-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar) as well as with the assembly protein nested genes ORF of the simian cytomegalovirus(10Robson L. Gibson W. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 669-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Welch A.R. McNally L.M. Gibson W. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4091-4100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gibson and co-workers (12Gibson W. Marcy A.I. Comolli J.C. Lee J. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1241-1249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Schenk P. Woods A.S. Gibson W. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1525-1529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the carboxyl-terminal region of the HCMV UL80 encodes a protein that is proteolytically processed in a similar fashion as the HSV-1 ICP35. By transient transfection assays, the simian CMV assembly protein nested gene-1 ORF was shown to encode a 590-amino acid protease whose amino-terminal 249 residues possessed proteolytic activity. This region also contains sequence motifs that are highly homologous to proteases of other herpesviruses(14Welch A.R. Woods A.S. McNally L.M. Cotter R.J. Gibson W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10792-10796Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). More recently, Baum et al.(15Baum E.Z. Bebernitz G.A. Hulmes J.D. Muzithras V.P. Jones T.R. Gluzman Y. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 497-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) used [35S]methionine labeling of Escherichia coli harboring expression plasmids containing UL80 ORF sequence and found an 85-kDa protease that underwent autoproteolysis in vivo and produced a set of proteins with molecular masses of 50, 29, 16, 13, and 5 kDa(15Baum E.Z. Bebernitz G.A. Hulmes J.D. Muzithras V.P. Jones T.R. Gluzman Y. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 497-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The three cleavage sites of the 85-kDa protease were identified as follows: (i) a maturation (M-) site at the carboxyl terminus, which shares sequence identity with the cleavage site of assembly protein precursor, (ii) an internal release (R-) site, which yielded the 29-kDa amino-terminal catalytic domain and a 50-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment, and (iii) an internal (I-) site that lies within the 29-kDa catalytic domain between Ala-143 and Ala-144. The design of inhibitors for the HCMV protease requires a detailed understanding of its structure and catalytic mechanism. The major difficulty in obtaining pure and stable enzyme for such studies has been due to autoproteolysis, which results in cleavage within the catalytic domain. We have expressed the stable single-chain active HCMV A143Q protease, purified it to homogeneity for crystallographic studies, and developed a sensitive continuous protease assay using fluorogenic peptides as substrates for the kinetic studies. DNA isolated from cultured cells infected with HCMV strain AD169 was used as the template for polymerase chain reaction amplification of the coding sequences for both the protease catalytic domain (amino acids 1-256) and assembly protein precursor. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized based on the published HCMV UL80 ORF sequences(9Chee M.S. Bankier A.T. Beck S. Bohni R. Brown C.M. Cerny R. Horsnell T. Hutchinson C.A. Kouzarides T. Martignetti J.A. Preddie E. Satchwell S.C. Tomlinson P. Weston K. Barrell B.G. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 154: 125-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). All amplifications were performed with the Taq polymerase, the Perkin-Elmer/Cetus Gene Amp DNA kit, and the standard procedure(16Mullis K.B. Faloona F.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 335-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3876) Google Scholar). Amplified DNA fragments were separately digested with NdeI and BglII prior to ligation into corresponding sites of the expression phagemid pMGH4(17Kan C.C. Gehring M.R. Nodes B.R. Janson C.A. Almassy B.J. Hostomska Z. J. Protein Chem. 1992; 11: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Substitutions of the Ala-143 within the protease catalytic domain was introduced using Kunkel's invitro oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis method(18Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar). The resulting constructs, pCMVP1-5 encoding the protease catalytic domain and pPAP-6 encoding the assembly protein precursor, were confirmed by both restriction enzyme mapping and nucleotide sequencing(19Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen; (20Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar)) was used as the expression host to produce both recombinant HCMV protease and assembly protein precursor. The bacterial cells harboring expression constructs were cultured in 2 × YT medium (16 g/liter Bacto-tryptone, 10 g/liter yeast extract, 5 g/liter NaCl) at 37°C containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Cultures grown to mid-log phase were induced with 0.2 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. 3 h after induction, the cells were harvested by ultrafiltration (Pelicon, Millipore) and centrifugation. Small samples of total lysates were prepared from cultures and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue(21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). All purification steps were carried out at 4°C. Approximately 30 g (wet weight) of induced bacterial cell pellet was suspended in 150 ml of lysis buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT) and lysed by passes through a microfluidizer (Microfluidics Corp). The lysate was centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 50 min in Ti 45 rotor at 4°C to pellet any insoluble material. After adding NaCl to a final concentration of 2.75 M, the soluble lysate was loaded on a phenyl-Sepharose hydrophobic interaction column, and eluted with a 2.75-0 M NaCl gradient in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM DTT. Fractions containing the A143Q protease were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM DTT. The dialyzed pool was then loaded onto a 75-ml Q-Sepharose column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), which was equilibrated in DT buffer (1 mM DTT and 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), followed by a 180 ml of DT buffer wash and eluted with a 675 ml of linear gradient of 0-300 mM NaCl in DT buffer. Fractions containing HCMV protease were pooled, dialyzed against DM buffer (1 mM DTT, 20 mM Mes, pH 6.0) and loaded onto a 75-ml S-Sepharose column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with 120 ml of DM buffer and eluted with a 675-ml linear gradient of 0-50 mM NaCl in DM buffer. Fractions containing the protease were eluted at 15-25 mM NaCl and yielded approximately 150 mg of the purified protease. The amino-terminal sequence of purified HCMV protease was determined after separation by SDS-PAGE and electroblotting onto Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore). Automated Edman degradation was carried out on an Applied Biosystems model 447A pulse-liquid sequenator(22Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The free thiol groups of A143Q protease was determined by Ellman titration(23Ellman G.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21719) Google Scholar). Purified A143Q protease was dialyzed extensively to remove DTT. Each 1-ml sample containing 2 nmol of purified A143Q protease in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, 1 mM EDTA, with or without denaturation in 6 M guanidinium chloride, was incubated with 50 μl of 3 mM 5,5′-dithionitrobenzoic acid at room temperature. The release of nitrothiobenzoate was monitored by the increase in absorbance at 412 nm from which the molar concentration of free thiols was calculated based on the molar extinction coefficients of nitrothiobenzoate at 412 nm being 13,700 and 14,150 M-1 cm-1, respectively, in the presence or absence of 6 M guanidinium chloride. The soluble lysate was prepared from induced bacterial culture as described above except for the addition of the following protease inhibitors: 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.6 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mM EDTA. The soluble fraction of the E. coli lysate was dialyzed against 10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM DTT, centrifuged, and loaded onto a 20-ml Q-Sepharose column equilibrated in the same buffer. Flow-through fractions were collected, dialyzed against PD buffer (1 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.9, 1 mM DTT), and loaded onto a 20-ml hydroxylapatite column (Bio-Rad). The column was washed with 60 ml of PD buffer and eluted with a 300-ml linear gradient of 0-500 mM MgCl2 in PD buffer. Fractions containing the assembly protein precursor were pooled and concentrated to at least 0.65 mg/ml by ultrafiltration using a 10-kDa cut-off polysulfone membrane (Millipore). Ammonium sulfate was added to the concentrated protein solution to a final concentration of 1.62 M and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The protein pellet was resuspended in one-fourth of the initial volume and precipitated by adding potassium chloride to 1.7 M and centrifugation. The final protein pellet, which contained assembly protein precursor, was resuspended in 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 1 mM DTT. Purified assembly protein precursor was incubated at 37°C with purified HCMV A143Q protease in 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, and 6 mM DTT without additional co-solvents. After incubation, sample mixtures were boiled immediately and subjected to SDS-PAGE. After Coomassie Blue staining, intensities of both 45-kDa assembly protein precursor and the 40-kDa cleaved assembly protein were determined by densitometric tracing using a Molecular Dynamics personal densitometer. A143Q protease at 58 nM and assembly protein precursor substrate at 1.08-8.6 μM were incubated as described above, and samples were taken at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 min. Each sample contained 100 ng (3.5 pmol) of A143Q protease and 2.5, 5, 10, or 20 μg (65-520 pmol) of assembly protein precursor. These samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining as described above. Potential nonlinearity in densitometric tracing was eliminated by electrophoresing amounts equivalent of 2.5 μg of substrate from all samples. Known amounts of protein were also electrophoresed with each series of samples as a control for densitometric tracing. The percentage of remaining uncleaved assembly protein precursor was calculated from the densitometric intensity and plotted against time for each substrate concentration. Data from each substrate concentration were fit to a single exponential decay curve using KaleidaGraph data analysis software (Abelbeck Software). The time required for 10% substrate cleavage was calculated from the fitted curves, and reaction rates were then calculated as pmol of substrate cleaved per second. The Km and kcat values were determined by plotting the reaction rates versus substrate concentrations and fitting to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Concentrations of HCMV protease were determined by its UV absorbance at 280 nm using a mg/ml extinction coefficient of 0.989 cm-1. All protein present was assumed to be active. The peptide A6376 (Table 1) was synthesized by American Peptide Co., Sunnyvale, CA. The standard 100-μl cleavage reaction contained 25 mM MOPS, pH 7.2, 50% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 2% Me2SO, 200 μM peptide substrate, 200-300 nM HCMV protease and was performed at 25°C. The reaction progressed for only 15 min so that the initial rate could be determined for the cleavage reaction while less than 5% of the substrate was cleaved. The reaction was stopped by adding glacial acetic acid to a final concentration of 2%. The reaction mixture was then subjected to reverse phase/perfusion HPLC using a POROS R2H column (Perceptive Biosystems). Products generated by cleavage were resolved from substrate, and other components with a 1-12% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/H20. Product peak areas were determined and used to calculate initial rates.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab PK03 and AM1013 (Table 1) are internally quenched fluorogenic peptide substrates that were synthesized by Enzyme Products Systems, Dublin, CA, and American Peptide Co., respectively. The anthranilic acid group emits fluorescence at 420 nm when excited with 320 nm monochromatic light. The fluorescence of the anthranilic acid group is significantly quenched by resonance energy transfer to the nitrotyrosine residue (24Meldal M. Breddam K. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 195: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). When the peptide is cleaved at the A/S scissile bond, an increase in the observed fluorescence of the anthranilic acid is obtained. The standard 600-μl cleavage reaction was performed at 25°C in a microfluorescence cuvette containing 25 mM MOPS, pH 7.2, 50% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 2% Me2SO (same as for HPLC assay), and 20 μM peptide substrate. The concentration of HCMV protease was 80 nM so that less than 5% of the substrate was cleaved over the 5-min reaction time. The initial rates were calculated as the increase in fluorescence versus time. For the fluorogenic assay, the concentrations of HCMV protease, PK03, and AM1013, were 0.5-1.0, 20, and 20 μM, respectively. The continuous change in fluorescence was monitored. For the HPLC-based assay, the enzyme concentration varied at 1-4 μM, and both the substrate peptide A6376 and product peptide peak areas were monitored. Progress curves were allowed to proceed to completion and were fit to an equation describing a first order single exponential decay using KaleidaGraph. kcat/Km was calculated by kcat/Km = kobs/[HCMV protease]. The individual values of kcat and Km were determined by measuring initial rates with variable substrate concentrations. The initial rates were fitted to the nonlinear form of the Michaelis-Menten equation using KaleidaGraph. The fluorogenic assay could not be used for this experiment since high concentrations of substrate caused inner filter effects. This effect erroneously decreases the apparent rate. Reverse-phase HPLC was therefore used to analyze product formation from PK03 and A6376 after being cleaved by the HCMV protease. Initially, the expression of the wild-type HCMV protease was attempted with the T7 expression phagemid pMGH4 (17Kan C.C. Gehring M.R. Nodes B.R. Janson C.A. Almassy B.J. Hostomska Z. J. Protein Chem. 1992; 11: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3). By using this expression system, wild-type HCMV protease could only be accumulated as an insoluble intact 29-kDa protein (Fig. 1A) at 42°C. Upon refolding, proteolytic degradation of the 29-kDa protease into 16- and 13-kDa fragments started to occur as the protease concentration was increased to 2 mg/ml (data not shown). The same 16- and 13-kDa proteins were observed in induced E. coli lysate prepared from 37°C cultures. These degradation fragments were previously seen in metabolically labeled E. coli lysates by Baum et al.(15Baum E.Z. Bebernitz G.A. Hulmes J.D. Muzithras V.P. Jones T.R. Gluzman Y. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 497-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and they were identified as the products of a cleavage event occurring between Ala-143 and Ala-144 at the I-site. Other groups have recently reported expression and purification of the wild-type HCMV protease catalytic domain either from inclusion bodies (25Sardana V.V. Wolfgang J.A. Veloski C.A. Long W.J. LeGrow C. Wolanski B. Emini E.A. LaFemina R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14337-14340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Burck P.J. Berg D.H. Luk T.P. Sassmannshausen L.M. Wakulchik M. Smith D.P. Hsiung H.M. Becker G.W. Gibson W. Villarreal E.C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2937-2946Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or as a two-chain protease due to autoproteolytic processing at the I-site (27Holwerda B.C. Wittwer A.J. Duffin K.L. Smith C. Toth M.V. Carr L.S. Wiegand R.C. Bryant M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25911-25915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a consequence of this autoproteolytic breakdown, preparation of active single-chain wild-type HCMV protease at high concentrations required for crystallographic studies is not feasible. Ala-143 of the I-site lies between the conserved sequence motifs CD1 and CD2 among herpes proteases. Deletion of the corresponding region in the simian CMV resulted in a stable protease and autolytic cleavage at the I-site was not observed. This mutated protease could still cleave its own assembly protein precursor at the M-site with approximately the same efficiency as the wild-type enzyme(28O'Boyle II, D.R. Wager-Smith K. Stevens III, J.T. Weinheimer S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4753-4758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In light of this observation, we mutated the alanine 143 residue of the HCMV protease to test if this mutation might confer resistance to autoproteolysis but still retain wild-type proteolytic activity. Mutations at Ala-143 to Gly, Gln, Asn, Ser, Thr, and Val were made. Based on their autoproteolytic activities in crude lysates (see Fig. 1B), mutants can be divided into two groups. Group I mutants, A143G and A143S, still produced 16- and 13-kDa fragments. Autoproteolytic activities observed with the group I mutants suggests that the I-site prefers amino acid residues with small side chains at P1 position. All group II mutants: A143Q, A143N, A143V, and A143T, produced intact 29-kDa protease abundantly at 37°C in E. coli. During the preparation of this manuscript, a similar approach was reported by Holwerda et al.(27Holwerda B.C. Wittwer A.J. Duffin K.L. Smith C. Toth M.V. Carr L.S. Wiegand R.C. Bryant M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25911-25915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They disrupted the I-site by changing valine 141 to alanine (VEA↓A to AEA↓A) and recovered active 30-kDa one-chain enzyme. In our expression construct, the histidine tag used by Holwerda et al.(27Holwerda B.C. Wittwer A.J. Duffin K.L. Smith C. Toth M.V. Carr L.S. Wiegand R.C. Bryant M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25911-25915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for purification purposes was avoided so as to obtain crystallographic information reflective of the native HCMV protease without unnecessary changes. We chose to purify the HCMV A143Q protease and to test whether this mutant protease retains proteolytic activity. Purification included phenol-Sepharose, Q- and S-Sepharose chromatographic steps (Fig. 2). HCMV A143Q protease was stable during purification and at 4°C for up to 1 month at less than 10 mg/ml. The amino-terminal amino acid sequencing of purified A143Q showed the correct sequence of HCMV protease with 80% of the protease retaining methionine as the first residue, while the remaining 20% had the initiation methionine cleaved off and thus started at the second residue threonine. Ellman titration showed that only three of the five sulfhydryl groups in the native A143Q protease were reactive against 5,5′-dithionitrobenzoic acid. After denaturation, the number of sulfhydryl groups/protease molecule accessible to 5,5′-dithionitrobenzoic acid reaction increased from 3 to 4.5. These results indicate that no disulfide bonds exist in the HCMV protease catalytic domain and that two of the five cysteines may be buried in the hydrophobic core of the native protein. The reported thiol content of wild-type HCMV protease after exposure to 2% SDS is 4.9 ± 0.5 (26Burck P.J. Berg D.H. Luk T.P. Sassmannshausen L.M. Wakulchik M. Smith D.P. Hsiung H.M. Becker G.W. Gibson W. Villarreal E.C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2937-2946Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is similar to the 4.5 thiol groups found in the denatured A143Q protease. It was therefore concluded that as an intracellular enzyme, all five cysteines in the catalytic domain of HCMV protease are kept in the reduced form. HCMV protease, unlike papain, does not have cysteine as an active site residue. However, it was observed by us and also reported by others that the HCMV A143Q protease loses activity rapidly in the absence of DTT (26Burck P.J. Berg D.H. Luk T.P. Sassmannshausen L.M. Wakulchik M. Smith D.P. Hsiung H.M. Becker G.W. Gibson W. Villarreal E.C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2937-2946Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that DTT prevented the loss of activity. It is clear that the cysteine residues need to be reduced for maximal activity. Therefore, during experiments of extended duration, DTT was supplied exogenously at 1-10 mM. However, for experiments with short incubation time, the DTT at 8-12 μM carried over from the enzyme stock was adequate. The same expression phagemid pMGH4 was used to express the HCMV assembly protein precursor in E. coli. The recombinant assembly protein precursor was soluble in the lysate. Purification included Q-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite column chromatography, and salt precipitations, and yielded assembly protein precursor with sufficient purity for enzymatic studies. During purification, it was observed that assembly protein precursor requires 5-10 mM DTT to maintain its solubility. Amino-terminal sequencing confirmed the 45-kDa assembly protein precursor identity and showed that its initiation methionine was removed. The enzymatic activity of purified A143Q was initially demonstrated using the assembly protein precursor. As shown in Fig. 3, 2.5 μg (1.08 μM) of substrate could be completely processed within 10 min by 0.5 μg (0.29 μM) of purified A143Q protease. In the assay buffer, 6 mM DTT was included to optimize the A143Q protease activity and to keep the assembly protein precursor soluble. Cleavage of the assembly protein precursor by the A143Q protease was quantitated by densitometric tracing of the full-length 45-kDa and processed 40-kDa protein bands on Coomassie Blue-stained gels after SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. The Km and kcat were determined to be 3.0 ± 1.0 μM and 13.3 ± 1.6 min-1, respectively. The large deviation in Km was mostly due to the experimental limit inherent to this discontinuous gel-based assay. The concentration range of substrate was also limited since the Km was so low. In vitro proteolytic processing of the HCMV assembly protein precursor at the M-site by a recombinant mutant V141A single-chain and wild-type two-chain HCMV protease was also recently reported by Holwerda et al.(27Holwerda B.C. Wittwer A.J. Duffin K.L. Smith C. Toth M.V. Carr L.S. Wiegand R.C. Bryant M.L. J."

Kinetic parameters were evaluated for a series of tryptophan analogues, providing information on the contribution of each chemical group to substrate binding. The stereochemistry of the dehydro product was determined to be a Z-configuration from proton nuclear magnetic resonance assignments. No reaction can be observed in the presence of other aromatic β-substituted alanyl residues which behave neither as substrates nor as inhibitors and therefore do not compete against this reaction. The enzymatic synthesis of α,β-dehydrotryptophanyl peptides from 5 to 24 residues was successfully achieved without side product formation, irrespective of the position of the tryptophan residue in the amino acid sequence. A reactional mechanism involving a direct α,β-dehydrogenation of the tryptophan side chain is proposed.

A reactional mechanism involving a direct α,β-dehydrogenation of the tryptophan side chain is proposed. Amino acid oxidases and dehydrogenases are widely distributed in living cells where they play a key role in the metabolic fate of amino acids, generating α-keto acids by oxidative deamination or dehydration reactions(1Brunhuber N.M.W. Banerjee A. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Blanchard J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16203-16211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Brunhuber N.M.W. Blanchard J.S. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

In this context, we recently isolated a novel enzyme from Chromobacterium violaceum (ATCC 12472), and showed it to convert N-acetyl-L-tryptophanamide (NATA) 1The abbreviations used are: NATAN-acetyl-L-tryptophanamideΔNATAN-acetyl-α,β-dehydrotryptophanamidebis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diolCI-MSchemical ionization-mass spectometry. into N-acetyl-α,β-dehydrotryptophanamide (ΔNATA)(4Genet R. Denoyelle C. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18177-18184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We named this enzyme L-tryptophan 2′,3′-oxidase (or L-tryptophan: oxygen 2′,3′-oxidoreductase). L-Tryptophan 2′,3′-oxidase, therefore, might contribute to the conversion of L-tryptophan into indole-3-pyruvic acid, its α-keto derivative, by catalyzing the first step of the reaction shown in the Fig. S1. Indeed, Dakin (5Dakin H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1926; 67: 341-350Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) first demonstrated in 1926 that an α,β-dehydroamino acid exists in a tautomeric equilibrium with its imino acid form and subsequently, this latter species was shown to be readily hydrolyzed into the β-substituted corresponding pyruvic acid (α-keto acid) (6Davis P.J. Gustafson M. Rosazza J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 385: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Hence, as it was originally suspected(7Chargaff E. Sprinson D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1943; 151: 273-278Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 8Taborsky G. Yale J. Biol. Med. 1955; 127: 267-278Google Scholar), the transient formation of α,β-dehydroamino acids could account for a possible mechanism in the course of the amino acid catabolism. N-acetyl-L-tryptophanamide N-acetyl-α,β-dehydrotryptophanamide 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diol chemical ionization-mass spectometry. L-Tryptophan 2′,3′-oxidase is a novel hemoprotein exhibiting a number of interesting features(4Genet R. Denoyelle C. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18177-18184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). First, it seems to directly catalyze the conversion of NATA into ΔNATA and in a stoichiometric manner the reduction of molecular O2 to generate H2O2. Second, it possesses a high molecular weight hetero-oligomeric structure (Mr ~ 680,000) consisting of two subunits: α (Mr = 14,000) and β (Mr = 74,000), presumably organized in an (αβ)8 manner with one heme molecule per αβ protomer. Third, L-tryptophan 2′,3′-oxidase was shown to be active at high temperature (up to 80°C) and under conditions that are frequently denaturing for proteins, i.e. 0.2 M dithiothreitol, 1% SDS, or 4.5 M urea. At present, however, little is known as to the substrate specificity of the enzyme and to a possible reaction mechanism. With the view to shed light on these questions, we investigated the capacity of L-tryptophan 2′,3′-oxidase to react with a variety of tryptophan derivatives. Here we report steady-state kinetic parameters determined for these reactions and specify the stereochemistry of the dehydro product. Together, the data obtained suggest that L-tryptophan 2′,3′-oxidase proceeds to a direct α,β-dehydrogenation of the tryptophan side chain via a mechanism closely related to that proposed for fatty acyl-CoA dehydrogenases(9Guisla S. Thorpe C. Massey V. Biochemistry. 1884; 23: 3154-3161Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar), in sharp contrast with the complex pH-dependent dichotomous mechanism postulated for the Pseudomonas tryptophan side chain oxidase (EC 1.13.99.3) (10Zavala F. Takai K. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 344-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Takai K. Hayaishi O. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 142: 195-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Finally, we demonstrate that L-tryptophan 2′,3′-oxidase can also proceed to the α,β-dehydrogenation of L-tryptophan side chains included in a number of peptides. This finding offers new enzymatic issues as to the modification and labeling of this peculiar side chain in proteins. Amino acids and derivatives were all purchased from Sigma. Nin-Formyl-L-tryptophan was prepared according to Previero et al.(12Previero A. Coletti-Previero M.-A. Cavadore J.-C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 147: 453-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Pentagastrin, glucagon fragment-(22-29) (human), and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone were purchased from Bachem AG (Switzerland). Adenocorticotropic hormone fragment (ACTH 1-24, human) was obtained from Ciba Pharmaceutical Co. The substance P analogue was a generous gift of Dr. G. Chassaing (Laboratoire de chimie organique biologique, URA CNRS 493, France). The analogue of the fragment-(α185-199) of the α-subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor was synthesized in our department by Dr. G. Mourier. Catalase (beef liver, EC 1.11.1.6) was purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals were purchased from Merck Chemical Co. (Germany) and Prolabo (France). L-Tryptophan 2′,3′-oxidase was purified from C. violaceum (ATCC 12472) according to Genet et al.(4Genet R. Denoyelle C. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18177-18184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and stored at −80°C in 0.1 M bis-Tris buffer, pH 7, in the presence of 5 mM EDTA and 0.58 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Working solutions, prepared by dilution in the same buffer, were not used for more than a day. Using NATA as a model substrate, the molar activity of the purified enzyme, as defined with respect to 1 mol of ΔNATA produced per s per mol of enzyme protomer (mole of heme), was estimated to be equal to 44.4 ± 4.1 s-1. Steady-state kinetics were carried out under standard conditions. The standard assay mixture comprised 1 mM NATA in 50 mM succinate buffer, pH 5.5. Catalase was added to the reaction mixture at a final concentration of 10 μg ml-1 in order to prevent enzyme inactivation by the produced H2O2. The reaction was initiated by adding the enzyme, and the increase in absorbance at 330 nm due to the formation of ΔNATA (ɛ330 = 18.8 mM-1 cm-1(4Genet R. Denoyelle C. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18177-18184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) was monitored at 30°C, using a Beckman DU-70 spectrophotometer. Km and kcat were determined using the KaleidaGraph (version 2.1.3) software (Abelbeck Software), either by nonlinear regression from the direct plot or by linear regression using a double-reciprocal plot; both methods gave self-consistent results. Ki were measured by kinetic competition experiments against NATA. Chromatographic separations and purifications of dehydro amino acids and peptides were carried out using a Waters 600 chromatographic system (column, reverse-phase C18 (Vydac); eluant, gradient from 0 to 40% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; flow rate, 1 ml min-1) supplied with a Waters 996 photodiode array detector. Dehydro products were analyzed either by chemical ionization-mass spectrometry (CI-MS) or by fast atom bombardment. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectra were recorded using a Brücker WM250 spectrometer (250 MHz). In a previous study(4Genet R. Denoyelle C. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18177-18184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we showed that the enzymatic conversion of NATA into ΔNATA is associated with the formation of an absorption band centered at 330 nm, allowing a precise and sensitive determination of the reaction. L-Tryptophan 2′,3′-oxidase activity could thus be directly quantified spectrophotometrically, and the steady-state kinetic parameters of the reaction were determined to be kcat = 45.2 ± 3.2 s-1 and Km = 19.5 ± 2.8 μM under standard conditions. Then we demonstrated the absence of any side products under various experimental conditions, including a wide pH range varying from 3 to 8. Assuming that formation of a double bond conjugated with the indole ring would produce a similar characteristic spectral modification, we examined the behavior of L-tryptophan 2′,3′-oxidase toward a variety of tryptophan derivatives. A number of tryptophan derivatives behaved as substrates. These are L-tryptophan, L-tryptophanamide, N-acetyl-L-tryptophan, and indole-3-propionate whose conversion exhibited an absorbance increase at characteristic wavelengths (Table 1). The intensity of these absorption bands varied from one product to another. Surprisingly, however, in the case of L-tryptophan and L-tryptophanamide, the absorbance increase was followed after 1 to 3 min of reaction by a reverse effect, i.e. an absorbance decrease at 320 or 326 nm, respectively. This phenomenon suggested the unstability of the reaction products and the inhibition of the enzyme by one of the associated side products. Such an inhibition was reversible since the enzyme was still fully active upon dilution in the presence of NATA (5 mM).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab In all cases, therefore, the steady-state kinetic parameters were accurately determined according to classical methods. The initial velocities were evaluated during the first 10 s of the reactions at various substrate concentrations. The resulting conventional hyperbolic curves (Fig. 1) allowed us to estimate the kinetic parameters by nonlinear regression analyses. Note that in these calculations, we assumed that all products whose unstability sometimes made their isolation difficult had the same molar absorption coefficient as ΔNATA (ɛ330 = 18.8 mM-1 cm-1(4Genet R. Denoyelle C. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18177-18184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The kinetic parameters of the reactions performed with the different substrates are summarized in the Table 1. One may note that L-tryptophan 2′,3′-oxidase displays the highest efficiency for L-tryptophan, which has been proposed to be the most probable natural substrate of the enzyme(4Genet R. Denoyelle C. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18177-18184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Otherwise, most substrates did not exhibit major kinetic differences. In summary therefore, modifications of L-tryptophan which do not abolish the enzymatic activity of L-tryptophan 2′,3′-oxidase are blockage of the α-amino group (N-acetyl-L-tryptophan), the α-carboxylic group (L-tryptophanamide), or both (NATA), as well as deamination (indole-3-propionate). The nature and role of the products of the reactions were also tentatively analyzed. Thus, experiments of isolation of the reaction products were carried out using reverse-phase chromatography under conditions described above. No clear cut results were obtained in the case of L-tryptophan due to the fact that more than 95% of the substrate remained in the reaction medium after several hours of incubation. More clearly, conversion of L-tryptophanamide yielded 3 resolved peaks (Fig. 2). The major one represented the nonconverted substrate (retention time, 21.5 min; λmax = 281 nm), whereas the two others (retention times, 30.2 and 37.2 min), characterized by an absorption band at (λmax) 326 nm, were identified, respectively, as the α,β-dehydrotryptophanamide product (Mr = 201.2) and its rearrangement as indole-3-pyruvic amide (Mr = 202.2), as judged from mass spectrometry (CI-MS) analyses (m/z = 202 and 203; [M+H]+). This side reaction was not unexpected due to the fact that α,β-dehydro derivatives possessing a free amino group are unstable species (see Fig. S1). Unambiguously, the dehydro products of N-acetyl-L-tryptophan and indole-3-propionate (Fig. 1) were, respectively, identified as N-acetyl-α,β-dehydrotryptophan and indole-3-acrylate, characterized by an absorption band at (λmax) 318 nm (ɛ326 = 14.8 mM-1 cm-1) and 326 nm (ɛ326 = 19.6 mM-1 cm-1(6Davis P.J. Gustafson M. Rosazza J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 385: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar)), and by mass spectrometry (CI-MS) (m/z = 245 and 188; [M+H]+). Mass spectrometry analyses also revealed the presence of an additional component whose mass was correspondingly 44 units lower. The same molecular species is also detected in the commercially available indole-3-acrylic acid, suggesting that these additional components were in fact generated during the mass spectrometry experiments, resulting probably from unwanted fragmentation (decarboxylation) associated with the mode of ionization. An important aspect associated with the enzymatic conversion concerned the geometric stereochemistry of the dehydro products. It is known that an α,β-dehydrotryptophan component can adopt either E- or Z-configurations (Fig. S2) and these species can be readily identified from assignment of the vinyl proton by 1H NMR spectroscopy(13Brown A.G. Smale T.C. Chem. Commun. 1969; : 1489-1490Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The reference compounds N-acetyl-(Z,E)-α,β-dehydrotryptophan ethyl ester used in our study were made available by chemical synthesis according to the method previously described by Hengartner et al.(14Hengartner U. Valentine Jr., D. Johnson K.K. Larscheid M.E. Pigott F. Scheidl F. Scott J.W. Sun R.C. Townsend J.M. Williams T.H. J. Org. Chem. 1979; 44: 3741-3747Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). One should emphasize that this procedure requires a careful control of the temperature during the different steps of the synthesis in order to reach an appropriate 1:1 ratio of the two forms, the E-isomer being readily converted into the Z derivative upon heating. NMR analyses of the purified isomers confirmed that they can be easily identified from the singlet signal of their vinyl group (Fig. 3). The chemical shifts of this peculiar proton was 6.90 and 7.60 ppm for the E- and Z-isomers, respectively, in good agreement with previous data(14Hengartner U. Valentine Jr., D. Johnson K.K.

The enzymatically synthesized dehydro product was obtained by incubation of N-acetyl-L-tryptophan ethyl ester (1 mM) with L-tryptophan 2′,3′-oxidase (6.6 nM), in 50 mM succinate buffer, pH 5.6, containing 30 μg ml-1 catalase, for 15 h at 30°C. 1H NMR spectra were recorded in dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 at 25°C using a Brücker WM250 spectrometer (250 MHz).

N-Acetyl-α,β-dehydrotryptophan ethyl ester was characterized by an absorption band at (λmax) 340 nm and by mass spectrometry (m/z = 273; [M+H]+). As shown in Fig. 3, 1H NMR spectrum of this compound showed the vinyl proton to be shifted downfield (δ = 7.60 ppm) as previously observed in the case of the Z-isomer. No signal was found corresponding to the E-isomeric form. Therefore, the steric configuration of the α,β-dehydrotryptophanyl moiety produced by enzymatic dehydrogenation was confirmed unambiguously to have a Z-geometry. In contrast to the previous tryptophan derivatives, no spectral perturbation happened when L-tryptophan 2′,3′-oxidase was incubated in the presence of methyl-3-indole (skatole), tryptamine, 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan, Nin-formyl-L-tryptophan, D-tryptophan, or N-acetyl-D-tryptophan. From Dixon plots (Fig. 4) we showed these compounds to act as competitive inhibitors of NATA. Ki values determined for the inhibitors are summarized in Table 2.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Therefore, the modifications that make a tryptophan derivative an inhibitor of L-tryptophan 2′,3′-oxidase are: (i) alteration of the indole ring (5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan, Nin-formyl-L-tryptophan), (ii) decarboxylation (tryptamine, skatole) and inversion of the L-configuration (D-tryptophan, N-acetyl-D-tryptophan). The fact that, in our hands, skatole exhibited the more potent competitive inhibition of L-tryptophan 2′,3′-oxidase suggested that the indole moiety could play a key role in the recognition and accommodation of ligands to the active site. Indeed, other aromatic or pseudoaromatic β-substituted alanyl residues, i.e.N-acetyl-L-phenyl-alaninamide, N-acetyl-L-tyrosinamide, and L-histidine, incubated at concentrations up to 1.2 mM under turnover conditions or in the presence of NATA (40 μM), behaved neither as substrates nor as inhibitors of L-tryptophan 2′,3′-oxidase (Table 2). From the above results, no indication emerged suggesting that L-tryptophan 2′,3′-oxidase would not be able to recognize a tryptophan side chain in a peptide or in a protein. We therefore investigated the possibility of forming dehydropeptides using six different peptides comprising 5 to 24 amino acid residues. As an example, Fig. 5shows the reaction of L-tryptophan 2′,3′-oxidase with pentagastrin (a), luteinizing-hormone releasing-hormone (b), and adenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH 1-24, human) (c). In each case, an absorption band occurred around 335 nm, as expected for the formation of a dehydro product (Table 3). The corresponding dehydrotryptophanyl products were purified on reverse-phase chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”) and characterized by mass spectrometry (fast atom bombardment) analyses. No side product was found to occur during this reaction. Steady-state kinetic parameters were estimated for all peptides supplied in sufficient quantity (Table 3). Considering the ratio of kcat/Km that can be used as an index for the enzyme preference for a series of substrates, it seems that, in a first approximation, the enzyme efficiency tends to decrease with respect to the peptide chain length.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab In the present study, we confirmed our previous conclusion that L-tryptophan 2′,3′-oxidase specifically catalyzes the dehydrogenation of tryptophan side chain(4Genet R. Denoyelle C. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18177-18184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we also found that not any tryptophan derivatives can be recognized as a substrate by the enzyme, allowing us to identify key elements for the recognition of the ligand by L-tryptophan 2′,3′-oxidase. As a first structural requirement for a ligand to remain a substrate is the indole ring itself. Replacement of the indole nucleus by any other aromatic ring makes the derivative unrecognized by L-tryptophan 2′,3′-oxidase, whereas introduction of substituents as small as hydroxyl or formyl groups transforms the derivative into a competitive inhibitor and causes a marked affinity decrease for the enzyme. Presumably, therefore, L-tryptophan 2′,3′-oxidase possesses an appropriate pocket which accommodates the indole ring of tryptophan, with at least some of constitutive atoms of the nucleus that directly interact with, or are closely related to, essential elements for the catalysis. A second substrate requirement resides in the presence of the α-carbonyl group. Indeed, if the carboxylic moiety can be blocked, like in NATA, without major consequence for the substrate, removal of the carbonyl group, like in tryptamine and skatole, transforms the derivative into a competitive inhibitor. Strikingly, however, shortening of the tryptophan side chain is accompanied by a substantial increase in binding affinity of skatole as compared to tryptamine. Presumably, therefore, the α-carbonyl group together with the indole ring establish leading interactions for the recognition of the ligand and/or for the expression of the catalytic activity of L-tryptophan 2′,3′-oxidase. In sharp contrast, the α-amino moiety can be either blocked, like in NATA, or even removed, like in indole-3 propionate, without major consequence for the substrate. A third substrate requirement resides in the L-enantiomeric configuration of the substrate. Upon inversion of the L-configuration, as in D-tryptophan, the derivative becomes a competitive inhibitor with Ki approximately equal to the Km value of the corresponding substrate. We also unambiguously showed, on the basis of 1H NMR analyses, that α,β-dehydrotryptophanyl products that are generated by L-tryptophan 2′,3′-oxidase adopt a pure Z-geometry (Fig. S2). This result is in good agreement with that previously reported by Gustafson et al.(15Gustafson M.E. Miller D. Davis P.J. Rosazza J.P. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1977; : 842-843Crossref Google Scholar), who proposed that the carboxybenzoyl-α,β-dehydrotryptophan, which is directly produced in growing cultures of C. violaceum, results from the syn elimination of the Hα and pro-S-Hβ hydrogen atoms. This mechanism appears, however, all the more striking as it is unfavorable in peptide structure, due to steric hindrance that prevents formation of an eclipsed conformation of the Cα and Cβ substituents. Davis et al.(6Davis P.J. Gustafson M. Rosazza J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 385: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) reported that conversion of N-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-tryptophan into its α,β-dehydro derivative in C. violaceum cultures requires the presence of molecular oxygen or, under anaerobiosis, the addition of phenazine methosulfate as an electron acceptor. The concomitant reduction of the phenazine dye indicated that the reaction proceeded by a direct dehydrogenation rather than by an alternative mechanism involving coupled hydroxylation or oxygenation/dehydration reactions(6Davis P.J. Gustafson M. Rosazza J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 385: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Two pieces of evidence suggest that L-tryptophan 2′,3′-oxidase may proceed by a direct dehydrogenation process, involving the direct removal of two reducing equivalents from the Cα and Cβ carbon atoms of a tryptophan residue. First, no component other than the α,β-dehydro products themselves could ever be identified upon reaction with L-tryptophan 2′,3′-oxidase. Second, we did not detect any lag period before the formation of the dehydro product, in contrast to what is observed with other enzymes such as Pseudomonas tryptophan side chain oxidase (see below) which proceeds via the formation of a cyclic intermediate(10Zavala F. Takai K. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 344-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we wish to suggest that L-tryptophan 2′,3′-oxidase proceeds by a direct dehydrogenation mechanism such as those that are often mediated by flavin prosthetic groups. One should note, however, that if the presence of a flavin has been disproved in the case of L-tryptophan 2′,3′-oxidase(4Genet R. Denoyelle C. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18177-18184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the nature of the dehydrogenase cofactor and the mode of electron transfer from the substrate to molecular oxygen remain to be elucidated. Previous observations now deserve to be recalled to provide a basis for a mechanistic model that could account for L-tryptophan 2′,3′-oxidase. In 1926 Dakin et al.(5Dakin H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1926; 67: 341-350Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) suggested that the initial stages of amino acid and fatty acid metabolism may be essentially similar, and it was shown later that mitochondrial flavoenzymes, such as acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, catalyze the α,β-dehydrogenation of fatty acyl-CoA thioesters in the initial step of fatty acid β-oxidation. Among the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase superfamily, the medium chain fatty acyl-CoA dehydrogenase exhibits such a broad substrate specificity that it can tolerate aromatic group substitution at the ω position of the fatty acyl-CoA substrate. In this context, 3-indolepropionyl-CoA was converted into 3-indoleacryloyl-CoA according to the general mechanism of all flavin-dependent acyl-CoA dehydrogenases(16Johnson J.K. Wang Z.-X. Srivastava D.K. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10564-10575Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As shown in the Fig. S3, the reaction is initiated by abstraction of the relatively acidic α-hydrogen as a proton, followed by the direct transfer of the β-hydrogen as a hydride to the oxidized flavin cofactor, yielding a trans-enoyl-CoA product(9Guisla S. Thorpe C. Massey V. Biochemistry. 1884; 23: 3154-3161Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Because it is clearly compatible with its substrate structural requirements, we suggest that L-tryptophan 2′,3′-oxidase proceeds via a similar mechanism. One major argument in favor of this proposal resides in the stereoselectivity of the reaction catalyzed by L-tryptophan 2′,3′-oxidase. Indeed, if the inversion of the geometric configuration abolishes the enzymatic reaction, it does not induce a perturbation of the binding properties. In addition, the proposed mechanism offers a simple explanation as to the observed critical role of the substrate carbonyl group, which, by forming a hydrogen bond with the protein, could (i) strengthen the acidic character, and (ii) fix the orientation of the Hα of the substrate, so as it could be easily abstracted by a chemical group of the enzyme acting as an acid-base catalyst. Further experiments are now required to validate our proposal. Two other enzymes are presently known to catalyze the formation of α,β-dehydro amino acids, Pseudomonas tryptophan side chain oxidase was first reported to catalyze the formation of α,β-dehydrotryptophan residues. However, this enzyme is clearly distinct from L-tryptophan 2′,3′-oxidase by both its structural properties and substrate specificity (for a review, see (11Takai K. Hayaishi O. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 142: 195-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar)). Indeed, the pH-dependent mechanism proposed for the tryptophan side chain oxidase totally differs from that proposed above. In brief, the enzyme catalyzes the formation of an indolyloxazoline intermediate that undergoes either nonenzymatic isomerization leading to an α,β-dehydro product, or hydration to form β-hydroxy and then β-keto products. More recently, another enzyme was reported to catalyze the formation of an α,β-dehydrocysteinyl residue during the biosynthesis of epidermin, a 52-residue peptide antibiotic produced by Staphylococcus epidermidis Tü3298(17Kupke T. Kempter C. Gnau V. Jung G. Götz F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5653-5659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Post-translational modification of the precursor peptide leads to the formation of the unusual S-[(Z)-2-aminovinyl]-D-cysteine residue at the C-terminal position of epidermin, involving the oxidative decarboxylation of a C-terminal L-cysteine residue. A two-step reaction is therefore anticipated, involving the formation of an α,β-dehydrocysteine residue catalyzed by a new flavoprotein EpiD (17Kupke T. Kempter C. Gnau V. Jung G. Götz F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5653-5659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and then followed by subsequent decarboxylation. The mechanism of this reaction and the role of EpiD in the decarboxylation reaction remain to be elucidated. However, the reactional mechanism of EpiD is also clearly distinct from that of L-tryptophan 2′,3′-oxidase in that it has been recently demonstrated to exhibit a strict substrate specificity toward peptides of at least 4 residues possessing close sequence analogies to the C-terminal epidermin tetrapeptide(18Kupke T. Kempter C. Jung G. Götz F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11282-11289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Presumably, a variety of still unknown enzymes may cause dehydrogenation of amino acids, hence contributing to their metabolic fate. We investigated the capacity of L-tryptophan 2′,3′-oxidase to catalyze the modification of tryptophan side chains in peptides and proteins. In all cases reported here, the dehydrogenation of the tryptophanyl residue catalyzed by L-tryptophan 2′,3′-oxidase resulted in the formation of a single α,β-dehydrotryptophanyl product, characterized by an absorption band centered at 335 nm. This band, however, can be shifted between 330 and 340 nm (Table 3), an effect that could be due to a change in the electronic environment of the double bond and to its partial delocalization between the carbonyl and the indole amino group. In a first approximation, the smaller peptides appear to be the most efficient substrates for L-tryptophan 2′,3′-oxidase, irrespective of the position of the tryptophan residue in the sequence. The enzyme efficiency was clearly diminished with high molecular weight peptides, probably due to steric hindrance effects. Nevertheless, considering the enzyme's peculiar properties, especially its stability at high temperature and in the presence of reducing and/or denaturing agents (4Genet R. Denoyelle C. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18177-18184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), L-tryptophan 2′,3′-oxidase can be used under conditions that are reversibly denaturing for a protein, yielding tryptophan residues accessible to the enzymatic modification. From these results, we propose that the name of the C. violaceum's enzyme should be extended to “peptidyl L-tryptophanyl 2′,3′-oxidase.” We are grateful to Gilles Meunier for excellent technical assistance, and very indebted to Dr. H. Virelizier for mass spectometry facilities (Service de Physique d'Experimentation et d'Analyse, CEA/Saclay, France)."

https://openalex.org/W1963490803,"Monoamine oxidase B (MAO B) catalyzes the oxidative deamination of biogenic and xenobiotic amines. The oxidative step is coupled to the reduction of an obligatory cofactor, FAD, which is covalently linked to the enzyme at Cys397. In this study, we developed a novel riboflavin-depleted (Rib-) COS-7 cell line to study the flavinylation of MAO B. ApoMAO B can be obtained by expressing MAO B cDNA in these cells. We found that MAO B is expressed equally in the presence or absence of FAD and that apoMAO B can be inserted into the outer mitochondrial membrane. Flavinylation of MAO B was achieved by introducing MAO B cDNA and different flavin derivatives simultaneously into Rib- COS-7 cells via electroporation. Since the addition of riboflavin, FMN, or FAD resulted in equal levels of MAO B activity, we conclude that the flavin which initially binds to apoMAO B is FAD. In our previous work, we used site-directed mutagenesis to show that Glu34 in the dinucleotide-binding motif of MAO B is essential for MAO B activity, and we postulated that this residue is involved in FAD binding. In this study, we tested the role of residue 34 in flavin binding by expressing wild-type or mutant MAO B cDNA in Rib- COS-7 cells with the addition of [14C]FAD. We found that Glu34 is essential for both FAD binding and catalytic activity. Thus, FAD binds to MAO B in a dual manner at Glu34 noncovalently and Cys397 covalently. We conclude that Glu34 is critical for the initial non-covalent binding of FAD and is instrumental in delivering FAD to the covalent attachment site at Cys397."

The apparent redundant functions of these enzymes emphasizes the importance of these enzymes in DNA metabolism. topoisomerase. A model termed “sign inversion” (13Brown P.O. Cozzarelli N.R. Science. 1979; 206: 1081-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) has been proposed that describes a unified mechanism for both type I and type II bacterial topoisomerases. In this model, a topoisomerase binds to its substrate (either single-stranded DNA for a type I enzyme or double-stranded DNA for a type II enzyme), catalyzes a strand break (either single (type I) or double (type II)) and strand passage event, and then reseals the break. The “sign inversion” model was originally proposed to explain the mechanism of bacterial DNA gyrase (a type II DNA topoisomerase); however, it has been extended to explain the mechanism of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I, a type I enzyme. It has been proposed that in the case of Topo I, the strand passage event can be thought to invert the sign of the two strands of the helix(14Dean F.B. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4984-4994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas, the strand passage event catalyzed by E. coli DNA gyrase, a type II enzyme, inverts the sign of a wrap of the entire helix(13Brown P.O.

Although there is evidence supporting this model as a whole, there is very little information regarding the properties of the individual steps of topoisomerase catalysis; therefore, our laboratory has set out to perform a detailed characterization of the mechanism of DNA topoisomerase III.

Chem. 1988; 263: 13366-13373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (10 μl) contained 40 mM Hepes-KOH buffer (pH 8.0 at 22°C), 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mM magnesium acetate (pH 7.0), 12% glycerol, and 5 pmol of radiolabeled oligonucleotide. The reactions were incubated for 5 min at 37°C, and the products were separated through a 10% polyacrylamide gel (30:0.8) using 0.5 × TBE as the running buffer. The gels were electrophoresed at 15 mA for 1.5 h, dried, and autoradiographed. The 45-base oligonucleotide used in the assay was 5′-CAGAATCAGAATGAGCCGCAACT ↓ TCGGGATGAAAATGCTCACAAT-3′ where ↓ indicates the site of Topo III cleavage(16Zhang H.L. DiGate R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9052-9059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 22-base oligonucleotide, containing a Topo III cleavage site, was the following subsequence of the 45-base oligonucleotide: GAATGAGCCGCAACT ↓ TCGGGAT. The 22-base oligonucleotide, without a Topo III cleavage site, was the following subsequence of the 45-base oligonucleotide: CAGAATCAGAATGAGCCGCAAC. Several exposures of the autoradiographs were quantified using a LKB-Pharmacia Ultrascan laser densitometer (in the case where a particular lane(s) were hard to visualize). In addition, bands from the gels, representing the indicated topoisomerase-oligonucleotide complex, were also excised, and the amount of radiolabeled oligonucleotide was determined using a Beckman LS 5801 liquid scintillation counter. Reaction mixtures (5 μl) contained 40 mM Hepes-KOH buffer (pH 8.0 at 22°C), 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mM magnesium acetate (pH 7.0), and 30 fmol of radiolabeled oligonucleotide. Topo III was incubated for 3 min at 37°C, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS to 2%. The reactions were adjusted to 45% formamide, 10 mM EDTA, 0.025% bromphenol blue, 0.025% xylene cyanol and heat-denatured for 5 min at 90°C. The reaction products were separated by electrophoresis through a polyacrylamide gel (19:1) containing 50% w/v urea. The gels were then dried and autoradiographed. Reaction mixtures (5 μl) contained 40 mM Hepes-KOH buffer (pH 8.0 at 22°C), 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mM magnesium acetate (pH 7.0), and 200 fmol of the radiolabeled oligonucleotide. Topo III was incubated for 3 min at 37°C followed by addition of 3 × 10-3 units of P1 nuclease. The reactions were incubated an additional 10 min at 37°C and terminated by the addition of EDTA to 10 mM. The reactions were adjusted to 45% formamide, 0.025% bromphenol blue, 0.025% xylene cyanol and heat denatured for 5 min at 90°C. The reaction products were separated by electrophoresis through a polyacrylamide gel (19:1) containing 50% (w/v) urea. The gels were then dried and subjected to autoradiography. The minimal sequence requirement of Topo III was determined by incubating the enzyme with oligonucleotides of various lengths and assessing the ability of the enzyme to cleave the substrate at the appropriate site. The oligonucleotides were designed to vary the length of DNA sequence both 5′ and 3′ of a strong Topo III cleavage site(16Zhang H.L. DiGate R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9052-9059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Substrates as short as 7 bases were capable of being cleaved by Topo III; however, the length of sequence 5′ to the cleavage was critical in determining whether the enzyme could productively interact with the substrate. Oligonucleotides, containing 5, 6, or 7 bases 5′ of the cleavage site and 1 or 2 bases 3′ to the cleavage site, were incubated with Topo III, and the cleavage products were resolved by electrophoresis through a polyacrylamide gel in the presence of urea (Fig. 1). When Topo III was incubated with a 9-base oligonucleotide containing 7 bases 5′ of the major cleavage site, a major 7-base (corresponding to the previously identified cleavage site(16Zhang H.L. DiGate R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9052-9059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and a minor 6-base cleavage product were observed (lane1). Incubation of Topo III with an 8-base oligonucleotide, containing 7 bases 5′ and only one base 3′ of the same major cleavage site, resulted in the production of identical cleavage products, although the 7-base cleavage product was diminished by 4.3-fold (lane3). This data clearly establishes the minimal 3′-sequence requirement for Topo III to be only 1 base. To establish the 5′-minimal sequence requirement for Topo III-catalyzed cleavage, the enzyme was incubated with an 8-base oligonucleotide containing 6 bases 5′ of the major cleavage site. This reaction resulted in the production of the 6-base cleavage product; however, the expected 5-base minor cleavage product (observed in the reaction containing the oligonucleotide with 7 bases 5′ of the cleavage site) was absent (compare lane3 with lane5). This result suggested that the minimal 5′-sequence requirement for cleavage was 6 bases. This conclusion was confirmed by incubating Topo III with a 7-base oligonucleotide containing the predicted minimal site of 6 bases 5′ of the cleavage site (lane7) and with a 7-base oligonucleotide containing only 5 bases 5′ of the cleavage site (lane9). A 6-base cleavage product was observed in the case of the former (although the cleavage was reduced 9.3-fold relative to the substrate containing 6 bases 5′ and 2 bases 3′ of the cleavage site (lane5) and reduced 4.8-fold relative to the substrate containing 7 bases 5′ and 1 base 3′ of the cleavage site (lane3)), but no 5-base cleavage product was observed for the latter oligonucleotide. A summary of the cleavage experiments performed with multiple oligonucleotides is presented in Fig. 2. To further establish whether the minimal substrate was an actual characteristic of the enzyme rather than a peculiarity of the substrate, the minimal substrate requirement for Topo III-catalyzed cleavage was determined for two other independent cleavage sites. The minimal substrate requirement was identical using the different oligonucleotide substrates (data not shown). To elucidate whether the asymmetric nature of the minimal sequence requirement was reflected in the way Topo III binds to its substrate, an attempt was made to footprint Topo III using the 45-base oligonucleotide shown in Fig. 2as a substrate (Fig. 3). A titration of Topo III revealed a distinct protection pattern that surrounded the cleavage site. Consistent with the minimal substrate experiments, the protected region was asymmetric relative to the cleavage site, encompassing 12 bases 5′ to the cleavage site to 2 bases 3′ to the cleavage site. Although the P1 nuclease protection experiment revealed that Topo III generated a distinct footprint, it was unclear whether the protection pattern was generated by site-specific binding of the enzyme or dependent solely upon catalysis. To address this question, the nuclease P1 protection pattern of a catalytically inactive mutant of Topo III, Topo III-phe328 (which possesses a phenylalanine substitution for tyrosine 328, the putative amino acid involved in strand breakage(16Zhang H.L. DiGate R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9052-9059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17924-17930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), was compared to the protection pattern of the active enzyme (Fig. 4). Titration of the catalytically inactive mutant (lanes8-11) revealed a similar footprint to the active polypeptide (lanes2-5), indicating that Topo III is a cleavage site-specific binding protein. However, since the mutant polypeptide is inactive, the footprint of the mutant lacks the Topo III-induced cleavage product. The ability to detect a Topo III-dependent protection pattern surrounding a strong enzyme cleavage site suggested that interaction between the enzyme and its cleavage site served to stabilize the enzyme on its substrate. If this were the case, an oligonucleotide containing a strong Topo III cleavage site should be an effective inhibitor of catalysis. This question was addressed by comparing the ability of a 22-base oligonucleotide containing a strong Topo III cleavage site with a 22-base oligonucleotide without a cleavage site to serve as an inhibitor of Topo III-catalyzed relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA (Fig. 5). The 22-base oligonucleotides consisted of a subset of sequence derived from the 45-base oligonucleotide (shown in Fig. 2), which either contained (bases 9-30) or did not contain (bases 1-22) the cleavage site. The presence or absence of the cleavage site was confirmed by incubating the 22-base oligonucleotides with increasing levels of Topo III (Fig. 5, toppanel). It is clear that only one of the oligonucleotides contains a strong cleavage site. Each oligonucleotide was then assessed for its ability to serve as an inhibitor of Topo III-catalyzed relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA (Fig. 5, lowerpanel). Both oligonucleotides can serve an inhibitor of Topo III catalysis (presumably by acting as an alternate substrate). At oligonucleotide/substrate ratios of up to 20:1, the oligonucleotide containing the cleavage site (lanes8-12) was approximately five times more effective as an inhibitor than an oligonucleotide without such a site (lanes2-6). However, with greater oligonucleotide/substrate ratios, the oligonucleotide containing the cleavage site appeared to be 10-20 times more effective as an inhibitor than an oligonucleotide without a cleavage site (a 1000-fold excess of the oligonucleotide without the cleavage site (lane6) inhibits to a significantly lesser extent than a 100-fold excess of the oligonucleotide containing a cleavage site (lane10)). The ability of Topo III to bind to the 45-base oligonucleotide shown in Fig. 2was directly compared to the 22-base oligonucleotides using an oligonucleotide mobility shift assay. An equimolar amount of all three oligonucleotides was incubated with increasing levels of Topo III, the products were resolved by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the amount of oligonucleotide present in the stable oligonucleotide-topoisomerase complex was determined as described under “Materials and Methods” (Fig. 6). Consistent with previous results, the 22-base oligonucleotide containing a strong cleavage site was bound with a 4-5-fold preference to the 22-base oligonucleotide without the site (compare lanes7-10 with lanes12-15). The preferential binding of Topo III to its cleavage site appears to be independent of catalysis since the catalytically inactive polypeptide, Topo III-phe328, has the same substrate preference as the active enzyme (data not shown). Interestingly, the 45-base oligonucleotide (which contained the same cleavage site as the 22-base oligonucleotide) was bound far more efficiently than either of the 22-base oligonucleotides (compare lanes2-5 with 7-10 and 12-15). The decrease in binding efficiency observed with decreasing oligonucleotide length also appears to affect the amount of unbound oligonucleotide observed in this analysis. There is a concomitant increase in the amount of stable oligonucleotide-topoisomerase complex with the decrease of unbound oligonucleotide with the 45-base oligonucleotide substrate (lanes2-5); however, this is not observed for the smaller substrates. This is presumably due to the fact that unstable complexes formed with the smaller substrates disintegrate and reform during electrophoresis, resulting in a smear of products throughout the lane. A 13-base oligonucleotide (a subsequence of the 45-base oligonucleotide) that did not show any evidence of interaction with Topo III (by footprint analysis) was also used as a substrate in a gel mobility shift assay. In accord with previous results, Topo III was capable of interacting with this substrate; however, the amount of stable topoisomerase-oligonucleotide complex was much lower than that formed with either the 22-base oligonucleotide or the 45-base oligonucleotide (data not shown). This length effect may be indicative of the mechanism by which Topo III locates its binding/cleavage site during catalysis. The minimum substrate requirement for DNA topoisomerase III-catalyzed cleavage has been examined and found to consist of only 7 bases, asymmetrically encompassing a known cleavage site of the enzyme. Oligonucleotides containing as little a 1 base 3′ of the cleavage site were cleaved by Topo III, establishing the minimal 3′ requirement for the enzyme. An oligonucleotide containing 6 bases 5′ of the cleavage site and 2 bases 3′ of the cleavage site was also cleaved by Topo III; however, an oligonucleotide containing 5 bases 5′ and 2 bases 3′ of the site was not cleaved by the enzyme, establishing a 5′-sequence requirement of 6 bases. When a Topo III-induced cleavage assay was performed using the minimal substrate, cleavage was observed; however, it was reduced ~9-fold when compared to the efficiency of cleavage of an oligonucleotide containing one more base 3′ of the minimal sequence and reduced ~5-fold when compared to an oligonucleotide containing one more base 5′ of the minimal sequence. The minimal sequence requirement for E. coli Topo I has previously been determined to be 7 or 8 bases(18Tse-Dinh Y.-C. McMarron B.G. Arentzen R. Chowdhry V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 8691-8701Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 19Domanico P.L. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6365-6371Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), but the substrates used in these studies were homopolymers and not an actual cleavage site of the enzyme. In any event, it appears likely that the minimal substrate requirement for the two enzymes is similar. It is unclear, however, if Topo I will show the same asymmetric sequence requirement for cleavage as Topo III. Nuclease P1 footprinting experiments indicate that the enzyme also binds asymmetrically to its substrate relative to its cleavage site. Topo III was shown to protect a region of the substrate from 12 bases 5′ to the cleavage site to 2 bases 3′ of the site. An identical footprint was observed using a polypeptide incapable of cleaving the substrate, illustrating that catalysis is not a requirement for cleavage site recognition. Topo III, therefore, is a cleavage site-specific binding protein as well as topoisomerase. The highly asymmetric sequence requirement of Topo III is consistent with the known catalytic mechanism of prokaryotic topoisomerases. These enzymes cleave DNA by making a nucleophilic attack 5′ to the phosphate in the phosphodiester backbone. In this mechanism, the topoisomerase becomes covalently linked to the DNA 3′ to the cleavage site via an enzyme-bridged phosphotyrosine linkage (reviewed in (7Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 665-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1642) Google Scholar)). Since the enzyme is covalently bound to the 3′-DNA fragment, it is not surprising that there may be only a minimal sequence requirement in this region. In fact, these experiments suggest that the enzyme may only require a single nucleotide to serve as a receptor for the nucleophilic attack. To prevent free rotation about the strand scission, however, the enzyme must have considerable noncovalent interactions with the 5′-fragment. This is again consistent with the observed minimal substrate requirement of at least 6 bases 5′ to the cleavage site. The binding properties of Topo III are also reminiscent of a site-specific binding protein. First, an oligonucleotide containing a Topo III cleavage site is more efficiently bound by the enzyme than an oligonucleotide without a site. Second, an oligonucleotide containing a cleavage site is a better inhibitor of Topo III-catalyzed relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA than an oligonucleotide lacking a cleavage site. Although gel mobility shift experiments indicate that substrates containing a cleavage site are bound more efficiently by the enzyme, Topo III is also capable of interacting with substrates that do not contain a cleavage site. These properties suggest a model for Topo III-catalyzed cleavage of DNA (Fig. 7). In the first stage of interaction (which we term generalized binding), Topo III binds randomly along its substrate molecule (Fig. 7A). This is consistent with the finding that Topo III can bind to substrates with and without cleavage sites. This model would predict a length dependence of the binding reaction since, in a nonspecific binding interaction, a longer oligonucleotide provides a larger target site per mole of substrate than a smaller oligonucleotide. Once bound to the substrate, the enzyme diffuses, or tracks, along the DNA until it encounters a binding/cleavage site. Locating a specific binding site via a nondirectional tracking process has been ascribed to Topo III because there is no evidence of a nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis-driven directional search by these enzymes. In principle, a directional search is a more efficient mechanism to locate sequences that are relatively distant from one another, but the location of both Topo III and Topo I cleavage sites has been found to be, on average, only 10-20 nucleotides apart(4DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13366-13373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Dean, F. B., 1984, Studies on the Mechanism of Escherichia coli Topoisomerase I. Ph. D. Thesis, University of Chicago.Google Scholar). The relative abundance of these sites may not require a directional search. Although the tracking-mediated search proposed in this model is consistent with our experimental results, kinetic experiments will be required to elucidate the actual mechanism by which Topo III locates its binding/cleavage site. Oligonucleotide mobility shift assays only give information on equilibrium binding; therefore, the length effect observed in our experiments, while consistent with the model, is only indicative of the more stable binding of Topo III to the longer oligonucleotide than to the shorter oligonucleotide. In the second stage of the reaction (which we term sequence recognition and stabilization), the enzyme recognizes and forms a stable complex with its cleavage site (Fig. 7B). In this stage, interactions with amino acids near or within the active site of the enzyme stabilize the enzyme-DNA complex and properly position the substrate within the active site (as illustrated by the ability to generate a nuclease P1 footprint). Positioning of the substrate within the active site is independent of the generalized binding of the substrate since truncations within the carboxyl terminus that drastically reduce the enzyme's binding affinity (>99%) do not alter cleavage site selection by the enzyme(16Zhang H.L. DiGate R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9052-9059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the final stage of the reaction (which we term asymmetric cleavage), the enzyme cleaves the substrate (Fig. 7C). During this step of catalysis, the majority of noncovalent interactions occur with DNA 5′ to the cleavage site, with only minimal interactions occurring 3′ to the site. The model above has been derived using data obtained from studies using small, single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides as model substrates. These observations can be extended to physiologically relevant reactions catalyzed by topoisomerase III upon double-stranded substrates. Topo III is a single-stranded DNA binding protein with a relatively low affinity for double-stranded DNA(16Zhang H.L. DiGate R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9052-9059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, Topo III-catalyzed relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA would require the enzyme to recognize and bind to single-stranded regions present in a negatively supercoiled, predominantly double-stranded molecule. The presence of single-stranded regions within a covalently closed DNA substrate is influenced by the superhelical density of the molecule, the local base composition within the molecule, and the reaction conditions. The optimum reaction conditions for Topo III-catalyzed relaxation activity (i.e. low magnesium optimum and stimulation by high temperatures(4DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13366-13373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) favor the formation of single-stranded DNA and are consistent with this interpretation. In the case of the decatenation of multiply interlinked plasmid DNA molecules, the enzyme would bind to small single-stranded regions present in the replicated DNA. These regions would be a consequence of lagging strand DNA synthesis, particularly from the removal of the small RNA primers used to initiate DNA synthesis. This is also consistent with the finding that the decatenation of isolated plasmid DNA dimers by Topo III is dramatically stimulated by the presence of small gaps within the substrate(4DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13366-13373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we have addressed only a half-reaction in the total scheme of topoisomerase catalysis. There is very little known about the next step of catalysis, strand passage. We are in the process of trying to isolate mutants that affect the strand passage reaction in the hope of being able to further dissect the mechanism of topoisomerase III. We thank Drs. M. Speedie, K. Reynolds, and K. Marians for the critical reading of the manuscript."

We show that RARβ2 phosphorylation is not crucial for its activity although it may modulate AF-1 activity.

INTRODUCTIONTranscription of RNA polymerase II promoters requires an assembly of the preinitiation complex consisting of basal transcription factors. This process begins with the binding of TFIID to the TATA box, followed by ordered binding of the other transcription factors (TFIIA, -B, -E, -F, -H) and RNA polymerase forming the initiation complex(1Buratowski S. Cell. 1994; 77: 1-3Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 2Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 161-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Transcription factors bound to promoter or enhancer sequences modulate the activity of polymerase II promoters. Transcription factors contain a DNA-binding domain (DBD) 1The abbreviations used are: DBDDNA-binding domainAFactivation functionERestrogen receptorRARretinoic acid receptorGSTglutathione S-transferaseCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferase. and an activation function (AF), each of which are interchangeable units, and generally are functioning independently when coupled to a heterologous AF or DBD(3Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). Activation functions/activators are regions of 30-100 amino acids in length and can be classified by their sequence similarity or the presence of predominant amino acids: acidic, glutamine-, or proline-rich(4Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2184) Google Scholar). Presently, little is known about the exact role of the predominant amino acids (Asp/Glu, Gln, or Pro) in activators, and it is unclear whether secondary structure is required for activation. Mutational analysis of acidic activators has shown that negative charge per se is not sufficient for activation as mutation of negative to neutral or even positive amino acids does not or only marginally interferes with activation capacity(5Cress W.D. Triezenberg S.J. Science. 1991; 251: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). An amphipathic α-helix, with negatively charged residues on one surface and hydrophobic residues on the other, could be a requirement for activation(6Giniger E. Ptashne M. Nature. 1987; 330: 670-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). However, some mutations destroying the putative α-helix also remain active(5Cress W.D. Triezenberg S.J. Science. 1991; 251: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Based on mutational analysis, the GAL4 activator was proposed to form an antiparallel β-sheet structure (7Leuther K.K. Salmeron J.M. Johnston S.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 575-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Using circular dichroism, the presence of this structure (under slightly acid conditions) was confirmed(8Van Hoy M. Leuther K.K. Kodadek T. Johnston S.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 587-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Structural analysis using NMR has not provided any evidence for the presence of stable secondary structure elements in any activator analyzed so far.The mechanism by which these activators exert their effect is currently a point of discussion. The removal of repressors interacting with a component of TFIID by activators was proposed(9Meisterernst M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1991; 67: 557-567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been suggested that activators can facilitate steps in the formation of the preinitiation complex by interacting with a component of this complex (10 and references therein). Thereby, the assembly of the preinitiation complex could be enhanced, and/or the number of active transcription complexes could be increased(11Wang W. Gralla J.D. Carey M. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1716-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 12White J.H. Brou C. Wu J. Burton N. Egly J.-M. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7674-7678Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Also, the formation of an open complex following the formation of the initiation complex may be a target for an activator. Based on these models, activators may modulate transcription in several ways, whereby generally an interaction with one or more components of the basal transcription machinery seems to be necessary. Several activators have been shown to interact with TATA-binding protein(13Stringer K.F. Ingles C.J. Greenblatt J. Nature. 1990; 345: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 14Lee W.S.

Cell. 1993; 75: 519-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). In some cases, point mutants with reduced activity show also reduced in vitro binding(14Lee W.S. Kao C.C. Bryant G.O. Liu X. Berk A.J. Cell. 1991; 67: 365-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 21Ingles C.J. Shales M. Cress W.D. Triezenberg S.J. Greenblatt J.

A. 1994; 91: 2488-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Occasionally, however, a bridging factor/cofactor is needed for activation, possibly indirectly connecting the activator with a component of the preinitiation complex (9Meisterernst M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1991; 67: 557-567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The observation that the AFs of the estrogen receptor (ER) function in a cell-specific way, and the observed promoter specificity of the AFs of ER (23Tora L. White J. Brou C. Tasset D. Webster N. Scheer E. Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 59: 477-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar) has led to the hypothesis that cofactors are required for the activity of the activators. The requirement for cofactors both in vitro and in vivo has recently been confirmed(24Brou C. Chaudhary S. Davidson I. Lutz Y. Wu J. Egly J.-M. Tora L. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 25Brou C. Wu J. Ali S. Scheer E. Lang C. Davidson I. Chambon P. Tora L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A different requirement for transcriptional activation may be phosphorylation. The activity of several transcription factors, e.g. CREB and c-jun have been shown to be up-regulated by phosphorylation (for review, see (26Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar)). Also, steroid hormone receptors are phosphorylated in vivo(27Orti E. Bodwell J.E. Munck A. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 105-128PubMed Google Scholar).RARs belong to the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily which share a common domain structure, denoted A-F(28Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6289) Google Scholar, 29Leid M. Kastner P. Chambon P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 427-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). The C region contains the DNA-binding domain which is most conserved among the different members of this family and consists of two zinc fingers. The hormone-binding domain is located in the E region and contains, besides the binding domain, a dimerization domain and a hormone-dependent transactivation function (AF-2). The N-terminal part of the receptor (AB) also contains an autonomous region involved in transactivation (AF-1) which functions independently of ligand, when coupled to a heterologous DNA-binding domain(28Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6289) Google Scholar, 29Leid M. Kastner P. Chambon P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 427-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). We and others have previously reported the presence of two autonomous transcriptional activation functions in RARβ which activate transcription both by different, cell-type and promoter-dependent mechanisms(30Folkers G.E. van der Leede B.-J.M. van der Saag P.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 616-627PubMed Google Scholar, 31Nagpal S. Friand S. Nakshatri H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2349-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The activation function present in the N-terminal part of the protein (AF-1, formerly called TAF-1), is located in the first 32 amino acids of the receptor, and functions both in the presence and absence of RA. This region is negatively charged and contains putative phosphorylation sites, but no obvious homology with known activators was observed(30Folkers G.E. van der Leede B.-J.M. van der Saag P.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 616-627PubMed Google Scholar).Since no activation function present in the AB region of a member of this superfamily has been analyzed in detail so far, we decided to characterize AF-1 of RARβ2 in more detail. Here we show that AF-1 is an acidic activator, three aspartic acids present in this region are required for its activity, and the hydrophobic residues contribute to activity. Sequence comparison revealed that this activation function has homology with the acidic transactivation domain of VP16.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmidsBy site-directed mutagenesis (Altered Sites Kit, Promega), we introduced a SmaI site in front of the ATG of RARβ2 in the same reading frame as the SmaI site of pGEX 2T and pSG424 (GST and GAL-DBD, respectively, sequence: GCAGACATTCAGTGCCCGGGGATCATGTTTGAC). All mutants were made by polymerase chain reaction or using site-directed mutagenesis and cloned to GAL-RARβ-CF, containing the first 76 amino acids of RARβ2 fused to the DBD of GAL4(1-147) (30Folkers G.E. van der Leede B.-J.M. van der Saag P.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 616-627PubMed Google Scholar) and pSG5-RARβ using the SmaI and XhoI sites. RARβΔA was constructed by polymerase chain reaction using a primer (sequence: tcccccGGGATCAATTGAAACACAGAGCA) containing a SmaI site in front of the first amino acid of the B-region in the same reading frame as the SmaI site of HA-tag RARβ (an expression vector containing the hemagglutinin-tag and a SmaI site in front of the ATG of RARβ) and primer Drev (GTGCATTCTTGCTTCGAAGT); this Sma-Xho-digested polymerase chain reaction product was cloned in the corresponding sites of HA-tag RARβ. Digestion of this plasmid with SmaI and XhoI, Klenow treatment, and ligation resulted in RARβΔ AB. RARβΔ1-27 was made by cloning the HinfI (blunt)-XhoI fragment in SmaI-XhoI-digested pSG5 RARβ, starting at amino acid 27, the first ATG. HA-tag RAR ΔE was made by cloning the XhoI-Xba fragment from RARβΔE (30Folkers G.E. van der Leede B.-J.M. van der Saag P.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 616-627PubMed Google Scholar) in the corresponding HA-tag RARβ sites. Cloning the KpnI-BamHI fragment from RARβΔE in the corresponding sites of the ΔAB construct resulted in HA-tag-RARβΔAB,E. To generate GST-RARβ 1-76, the SmaI-XhoI fragment of pSG5-RARβ2 was ligated after Klenow treatment in the SmaI site of pGEX-2T and transformed to Escherichia coli Jm101. All constructs were sequenced to check mutations and reading frames: expression was confirmed by Western blot using a polyclonal antibody against the F region of RARβ or an anti-GAL antibody.Transfection and CAT AssayTransfections were carried out by calcium phosphate co-precipitation as reported before(30Folkers G.E. van der Leede B.-J.M. van der Saag P.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 616-627PubMed Google Scholar). 8 μg of reporter 5 × GAL-CAT (5 GAL binding sites in front of an E1b TATA box-CAT(32Lillie J.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar)), mCRBPII-CAT or hRARβ2-CAT (−63/+156; 33), 1 μg of expression vector (GAL-RAR fusion constructs pSG424 or pSG5-RARβ and pSG5-RXRα) together with 1.5 μg of SV2-LacZ as reference plasmid. For preparation of whole cell extract, 10 μg of expression construct was transfected. After removal of the precipitate, 1.0 μM RA was added when indicated, and, after a subsequent 24 h, cells were harvested. CAT assay was performed as described; for quantification a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) was employed, and percentage conversion was normalized for transfection efficiency using the β-galactosidase assay(30Folkers G.E. van der Leede B.-J.M. van der Saag P.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 616-627PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection was performed using at least two different batches of expression vector DNA, and data are presented as the mean (relative activity or CAT activity) of at least five independent or three duplicate experiments with the S.E. between the different experiments generally less than 15%.Western BlottingWhole cell extract from transiently transfected COS cells was prepared by three subsequent freeze/thaw cycles (−80°C/4°C) in 50-100 μl of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 400 mM KCl) together with 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitors (aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, and chymostatin, final concentration 1.0 μg/ml of each). Equivalent amounts of extract were loaded and separated on 8-12.5% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose using a semi-dry blot apparatus. Membranes were blocked in 4% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in PBST (150 mM NaCl, 16 mM Na2HPO4, 4 mM NaH2PO4, and 1% (v/v) Tween 20) for 1 h. Blots were incubated using either a monoclonal against GAL-DBD (1:750) or a polyclonal against the F region of RARβ (RPβ(F)112(34Rochette-Egly C. Gaub M.-P. Lutz Y. Ali S. Scheuer I. Chambon P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2197-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar)) (1:750) in PBST containing 2% (w/v) nonfat dry milk for 2 h. After 7 washes in PBST, blots were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated second antibodies in PBST containing 2% (w/v) nonfat dry milk. After 7 washes with PBST, blots were developed using the ECL kit (Amersham).In Vivo Labeling and ImmunoprecipitationCells were transfected as described, and 24 h post-transfection medium was changed for phosphate-free DF medium containing 7.5% (v/v) dialyzed serum, and cells were labeled with 1 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate/ml (ICN), for 4 h. 1.0 μM RA was added together with [32P]orthophosphate (4 h). Cells were washed with cold PBS0 (150 mM NaCl, 16 mM Na2HPO4, and 4 mM NaH2PO4), scraped in PBS0, and lysed in 40 μl of lysis buffer (see Western blotting). After centrifugation, the cell lysate was precleared in 750 μl of IP buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100) containing 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitors using 1 μl of normal mouse serum and 50 μl of 50% (v/v) slurry protein A-Sepharose in IP buffer. 50 mM NaF, 40 mM β-glycerophosphate, and 0.2 mM NaVO4 were added to both lysis and IP buffer. The lysates were then incubated for 2 h with 50 μl of 12CA5 hybridoma supernatant; thereafter, 50 μl of 50% (v/v) slurry protein A-Sepharose in IP buffer was added and incubated for another hour. Beads were washed 3 times with 1 ml of IP buffer, once with 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 M LiCl (1 ml), and once with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (1 ml). Immunocomplexes were eluted by incubation at 100°C for 5 min in sample buffer and run on a 10-12.5% (w/v) SDS-PAGE gel.RESULTSThe First 32 Amino Acids of RARβ2 Are Required and Sufficient for AF-1 ActivityWe have previously shown that, when coupled to the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of GAL4, the first 32 amino acids are required and sufficient for transactivation(30Folkers G.E. van der Leede B.-J.M. van der Saag P.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 616-627PubMed Google Scholar). RARβ lacking the AB region showed decreased transactivation capacity, which is dependent on the promoter used(30Folkers G.E. van der Leede B.-J.M. van der Saag P.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 616-627PubMed Google Scholar, 35Nagpal S. Saunders M. Kastner P. Durand B. Nakshatri H. Chambon P. Cell. 1992; 70: 1007-1019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Results obtained with GAL-fusion constructs are sometimes different from results with the same activation function in its normal protein context. To determine whether the first 32 amino acids are also sufficient for AF-1 activity in the receptor context, we made several RARβ deletion constructs, as shown in Fig. 1A. All mutants were translated properly and accumulated to similar levels as judged by Western blot of extracts of COS cells transfected with these mutants; only the expression of Δ1-27 is slightly lower, because it lacks a consensus Kozak sequence (Fig. 1B). These mutant receptors were transfected in COS-1 cells together with the CRBPII promoter coupled to the CAT gene. This promoter has been shown to be activated only by AF-1 and not by AF-2 of RARβ2(35Nagpal S. Saunders M. Kastner P. Durand B. Nakshatri H. Chambon P. Cell. 1992; 70: 1007-1019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Fig. 1B shows a quantification of these transfections; no activity was observed in the absence of RA, and activity was dependent on cotransfection of RARs. Constructs lacking the A or AB region no longer activated the CRBPII promoter as has been reported before(35Nagpal S. Saunders M. Kastner P. Durand B. Nakshatri H. Chambon P. Cell. 1992; 70: 1007-1019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The mutant receptors Δ1-27 and Δ11-22, which were no longer active when fused to GAL-DBD, were also unable to activate transcription of the CRBPII promoter. The receptor containing only the first 32 residues (Δ33-76), however, was still able to activate this promoter albeit to a lesser extent than the full-length receptor. From these data we conclude that the first 32 amino acids of RARβ2 are required and probably sufficient for the activity of AF-1, both when present in the normal receptor context and when fused to a heterologous DBD.Phosphorylation Is Not Required for Transactivation by AF-1The observation that RARs are phosphorylated in vivo(34Rochette-Egly C. Gaub M.-P. Lutz Y. Ali S. Scheuer I. Chambon P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2197-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 36Rochette-Egly Y. Lutz Y. Saunders M. Scheuer I. Gaub M.-P. Chambon P.

Cell Res. 1992; 201: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and recent observations by us 2G. E. Folkers, E. C. van Heerde, and P. T. van der Saag, unpublished results. and others (38Huggenvik J.I. Collard M.W. Kim Y.-W. Sharma R.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 543-550PubMed Google Scholar) that the activity of RARs can be up-regulated by protein kinase A, indicated that phosphorylation may be important for the activity of AF-1.To test whether phosphorylation is involved in the activity of AF-1, we changed the tyrosine, threonine, and all serine residues present in this region to alanine and tested the ability of these mutants to activate transcription, when coupled to GAL-DBD. Fig. 2shows the quantification of CAT assays of COS cells transfected with these mutants. It is clear from these results that all mutants are still active; only the mutation of serines 22, 24, and 25 to alanine showed a 35% reduction in activity. These transfection data indicated that the putative phosphorylation sites are not absolutely required for AF-1 activity, but that they can, however, influence the activity. A decrease in the in vivo phosphorylation levels might be expected upon mutation of the putative phosphorylation sites. Therefore, in vivo phosphorylation experiments using the indicated mutants in the HA-RARβΔE constructs (containing a hemagglutinin tag in front of the AB region in the RARβ expression construct lacking the hormone-binding domain) were performed. No obvious differences in phosphorylation levels for the various mutants were observed (data not shown). Since we were not able to map the phosphorylation sites within this region, it is possible that the absence of phosphorylation is not the cause of this decrease but rather the introduction of Ala instead of Ser residues. An alternative explanation could be that the kinase responsible for this phosphorylation event is induced upon RA treatment, and a 4-h RA treatment in the in vivo phosphorylation experiment is too short to see the differences in phosphorylation levels between wild type and mutants. From these data we conclude that phosphorylation is not crucial for AF-1 activity, although it may modulate the activity of this activator.Figure 2:The activity of AF-1 is modulated by putative phosphorylation sites. COS cells were transfected with various RARβ2 (1-76) point mutants (schematically depicted in Fig. 4) coupled to GAL-DBD, together with the reporter 5 × GAL-CAT (32Lillie J.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) in the presence of 1.0 μM RA. CAT activity was determined and is presented as the mean CAT activity (±S.E.) of five independent experimentsView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Negatively Charged Amino Acids Are Responsible for AF-1 ActivityWe have observed that RARβ AF-1 when fused to GAL-DBD is capable of activating transcription synergistically upon multimerization of GAL binding sites, 3Folkers, G. E., von der Burg, B., van der Saag, P. T.(1996) J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol., in press. as has been reported similarly for VP-16(39Emami K. Carey M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 5005-5012Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Therefore, it can be hypothesized that these activators function by similar mechanisms. Experiments with VP16 have indicated that negatively charged amino acids are involved in and are required for the activity of VP-16. Moreover, the hydrophobic residues surrounding the Asp/Glu residues are required for its activity(5Cress W.D. Triezenberg S.J. Science. 1991; 251: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Analysis of the minimal autonomous activation region of AF-1 (amino acids 1-32) indicated that this region is overall negatively charged, implying that negatively charged residues could be involved in the activity of AF-1. To test this hypothesis, we first mutated all negatively charged amino acids individually to noncharged residues (Ala) and transfected these GAL-DBD coupled mutants together with a GAL-responsive reporter in COS cells. We observed a considerable decrease in CAT activity of the mutant activator when compared to wild type, as shown in Fig. 3. Also, the conversion of Asp-17 to threonine resulted in a similar decrease in activity, showing that not only an aspartic acid to alanine substitution is destructive (data not shown). Subsequently, multiple aspartic acid residues were changed simultaneously to alanines causing a further decrease in activity, and, upon alteration of all aspartic acid residues, nearly all activity was lost (Fig. 3).Figure 3:Negatively charged amino acids are important for AF-1 activity.

Mutation of Asp-3, −6 to glutamic acid, which has been shown previously to be a poor substitute for aspartic acid in case of VP16(5Cress W.D. Triezenberg S.J. Science. 1991; 251: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), resulted in a decrease almost as strong as the corresponding Ala mutant. We then attempted to create a stronger activator by introducing extra negative charge. Changing LDF (16Baniahmad A. Ha I. Reinberg D. Tsai S. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8832-8836Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 17Lin Y.S. Green M.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 971-981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 18Kim T.K. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4170-4174Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) to aspartic acid residues (DDD) did not result in a receptor with higher activity, but instead a small decrease was observed. Above we have shown that replacement of S22A,S24A,S25A resulted in a decrease in activity (Fig. 2). Upon changing the serine residues of this putative phosphorylation site to aspartic acid, a stronger activator was created (Fig. 3), showing the importance of negative charge for activation and suggesting that phosphorylation can, by introducing extra negative charge, modulate the activity of this activator.Hydrophobic Residues Contribute to AF-1 ActivityWe then tested whether hydrophobic amino acids, like in VP16, are also required for activation. Mutation of F2P and M5P resulted in a significant decrease (38 and 35%, respectively), while alteration of the hydrophobic Val to Ala caused a larger (62%) reduction in activity (Fig. 4). The decrease in activity by mutation of hydrophobic residues is not as strong as reported for the F442P mutant of VP16(40Regier J.L. Shen F. Triezenberg J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). These data indicate that, although the mutation of aspartic acid residues caused a stronger decrease in activity, the hydrophobic residues substantially contribute to the activity of AF-1.Figure 4:Transcriptional activation by the various mutant activators/receptors.

Next, methylated substrates were incubated in mammalian cells for a sufficient length of time to recombine or rejoin prior to substrate recovery. Results from bacterial transformation of the substrates and from direct Southern analysis demonstrate that cytosine methylation has no detectable effect on either DNA end-joining or homologous recombination. Thus, the components of the protein machinery involved in these complex processes are unaffected by the major DNA modification in mammalian cells.

American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1988: 621-653Google Scholar) and (3Subramani S. Seaton B.L. Kucherlapati R. Smith G.R. Genetic Recombination. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1988: 549-573Google Scholar)). Homologous recombination of transfected DNA substrates is postulated to occur primarily by the nonconservative single strand annealing pathway(4Lin F.-L. Sperle K. Sternberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1020-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 5Lin F.-L. Sperle K. Sternberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In this pathway, the two substrates contain double strand breaks at or near their homologous regions on which an exonuclease (or helicase) acts to produce single strands. The homologous single strands anneal and subsequent processing steps result in the completion of the recombination event. DNA end-joining has also been extensively studied by transfection of substrates into mammalian cells(2Roth D.B. Wilson J.H. Kucherlapati R. Smith G.R. Genetic Recombination. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1988: 621-653Google Scholar). Surprisingly, many different combinations of DNA ends can be rejoined efficiently in vivo. In addition to the precise ligation of compatible ends, noncompatible ends are also rejoined. For example, blunt-ended DNA ends can be rejoined to either 3′ or 5′ overhangs. The rejoining of the noncompatible ends frequently occurs within very short homologies near the DNA ends(2Roth D.B. Wilson J.H. Kucherlapati R. Smith G.R. Genetic Recombination. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1988: 621-653Google Scholar). Mechanistically, this type of end-joining may be similar to the single strand annealing pathway of homologous recombination, the key distinction being the length of the homology. Although the protein machinery involved in either recombination or DNA end-joining is not well characterized, a number of components, including exo- and endonucleases, DNA polymerase, ligase, and strand annealing proteins, can be expected to participate. The major base modification of mammalian DNA, cytosine methylation, occurs on the C-5 position of cytosines within the context of CpG dinucleotides (reviewed in (6Razin A. Cedar H. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 451-458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Cytosine methylation has several demonstrated biophysical consequences on DNA and, thus, it may modulate the enzymatic activity of some of the components involved in recombination or end-joining. For example, methylation increases the melting temperature of naked DNA(7Gill J.E. Mazrimas J.A. Bishop Jr., C.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 335: 330-348Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It also has other effects, such as influencing the extrusion of DNA cruciforms(8Murchie A.I. Lilley D.M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 205: 593-602Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar), as well as the transition of DNA from the B form to Z form(9Zacharias W. Jost J.P. Sauluz H.P. DNA Methylation: Molecular Biology and Biological Significance. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1993: 27-38Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, it appears to have almost no influence on the intrinsic flexibility of DNA(10Hodges-Garcia Y. Hagerman P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 197-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Functionally, methylation has a critical role in transcriptional regulation, and it has been implicated in both the establishment and maintenance of X chromosome inactivation and genomic imprinting patterns(6Razin A. Cedar H. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 451-458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The consequences of cytosine methylation in gene regulation may be the result of directly or indirectly altering the binding or activity of transcription factors and chromatin proteins (11Meehan R.R. Lewis J.D. McKay S. Kleiner E.L. Bird A.P. Cell. 1989; 58: 499-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Although Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila have no detectable methylation, the importance of methylation in mammals has been underscored by gene knockout experiments in which it was found that mice defective in the DNA methyltransferase die during embryonic development(12Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3159) Google Scholar). Methylation may also play a role in modulating the timing of replication. For example, the inactive X chromosome is replicated later than the active X chromosome in female cells(13Morishima A. Grumbach M.M. Taylor J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1962; 48: 756-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 14Willard H.F. Latt S.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1976; 28: 213-227PubMed Google Scholar). At present, it is unknown whether methylation affects homologous recombination in either mitotic or meiotic mammalian cells. However, it has been observed that recombination rates differ at identical chromosomal regions between males and females. Overall, females have a higher rate of recombination than males, although some chromosomal regions recombine more frequently in males than in females(15Donis-Keller H. et al.Cell. 1987; 51: 319-337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Methylation patterns also differ between male and female gametes, with spermatogenic cells having an overall higher level of methylation than oogenic cells(16Monk M. Boubelik M. Lehnert S. Development (Camb.). 1987; 99: 371-382PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sanford J.P. Clark H.J. Chapman V.M. Rossant J. Genes & Dev. 1987; 1: 1039-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Thus, methylation could potentially directly or indirectly suppress recombination rates. Related to this, it has been demonstrated that methylation decreases the site-specific recombination of antigen receptor genes, at least in some contexts. In this report, we have begun to address whether methylation has a direct affect on either homologous recombination or DNA end-joining in mammalian cells. DNA manipulations were performed according to standard procedures(18Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). The Tn5 neo gene fragments were derived from plasmid pSV2neoM7. Plasmid pSV2neoM7 has a hybrid neo gene in which the 5′ portion of the gene is derived from pSV2neo (19Southern P.J. Berg P. J. Mol. Appl. Gen. 1982; 1: 327-341PubMed Google Scholar) and the 3′ portion of the gene is derived from pMC1neopA2(20Thomas K.R. Capecchi M.R. Cell. 1987; 51: 503-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar). The fragments that gave rise to pSV2neoM7 are the 961-bp 1The abbreviations used are: bpbase pairsAmpampicillinKankanamycin. NdeI/EagI from pSV2neo, the 816 bp EagI/BamHI fragment from pMC1neopA2, and PstI/BamHI cleaved pUC19. The PstI and NdeI sites were blunted prior to ligation by treatment with T4 DNA polymerase and Klenow fragment, respectively. Plasmid Mneo was constructed by cloning the 1206-bp HindIII/BamHI Tn5 neo gene fragment from pSV2neoM7 into HindIII/BamHI-cleaved pUC19. The recombination substrate M5neo was constructed by inserting the 885-bp HindIII/SphI Tn5 neo gene fragment of pSV2neoM7 into HindIII/SphI-digested pUC19. Plasmid M3neo was generated by ligating the 673-bp PstI/BamHI neo gene fragment of pSV2neoM7 into PstI/BamHI-digested pUC19. The latter two plasmids have 352 bp of homology between the PstI and SphI sites of the neo gene. Prior to transfection, M5neo was cleaved with SphI, and M3neo was cleaved with PstI and AatII. Cleaved DNA was methylated in vitro via the SssI methylase according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs). The samples of unmethylated DNAs were incubated in methylation buffer without the SssI methylase, as a control. base pairs ampicillin kanamycin.

Bacteria (40 μl) were mixed with 0.5 μl of DNA and electroporated in a 0.1-cm cuvette using a Bio-Rad gene pulser with a setting of 1.8 kV. They were then placed in 1 ml of SOC medium for a 1-h incubation at 37°C prior to plating on ampicillin- or kanamycin-containing plates. COS1 cells were cultured in 150-cm2 tissue culture flasks and transfected via electroporation. Cells were harvested at subconfluence and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline at a concentration of 108 cells/ml. A volume of 0.8 ml of cells was placed in a 0.4-cm cuvette and electroporated using a Bio-Rad gene pulser with a setting of 250 V, 960 μF. Just prior to electroporation, 30 μg of each neo plasmid DNA was mixed with the cells. Cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline immediately after electroporation to remove untransfected DNA and then incubated in tissue culture medium at 37°C. To recover transfected DNA, cells were harvested after 4-h incubation. They were trypsinized and then washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline to remove any remaining untransfected DNA. Transfected DNA was recovered as described previously (21Serghini M.A. Ritzenthaler C. Pinck L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3604Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and resuspended in 50 μl of H2O. Southern analysis was performed using 1-2 μl of DNA according to standard procedures(18Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). To determine whether cytosine methylation influences the efficiency of extrachromosomal homologous recombination in mammalian cells, we developed a sensitive and quantitative assay based on bacterial transformation. Similar assay systems have been utilized previously(3Subramani S. Seaton B.L. Kucherlapati R. Smith G.R. Genetic Recombination. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1988: 549-573Google Scholar). This assay also allows us to determine if methylation affects the DNA end-joining. The assay is sensitive and quantitative, since a large sample pool of plasmid DNA can be tested by its ability to confer antibiotic resistance to bacteria. Even more, individual recombination and end-joining products can be analyzed by recovering plasmid DNA from bacterial colonies, thus providing insights into repair processes at the molecular level. Recombination substrates were constructed based on the parental Mneo plasmid. Mneo has an intact Tn5 neo gene and confers kanamycin resistance (KanR) to bacteria (Fig. 1). The Tn5 neo gene expresses only in bacteria, so as to bypass any potential transcriptional effects on recombination and end-joining in mammalian cells. This plasmid and its derivatives do not contain a mammalian replication origin. The two intermolecular recombination substrates, M5neo and M3neo, contain 3′- and 5′-truncated Tn5 neo genes, respectively, and have an overlap of 352 bp of homologous sequences within the neo gene. Recombination within this homology restores a functional neo gene. To stimulate recombination, the plasmids are cleaved at the end of the homology region prior to transfection. M5neo is cleaved with SphI (M5neo/S), and M3neo is cleaved with PstI and AatII (M3neo/AP). Restriction with each of these enzymes produces 4-base 3′ overhangs, although the sequence of the overhang differs for each. The experimental design is shown in Fig. 2. M5neo/S and M3neo/AP are methylated in vitro with a cytosine methylase and then electroporated into mammalian cells. Cells are incubated for 4 h, after which time plasmid DNA is recovered. We chose 4 h, since previous results have shown that recovery of recombined DNA is optimal at this time point. 2P. Rouet, F. Smih, and M. Jasin, unpublished results. The recovered DNA is electroporated into E. coli, and colonies are selected on both ampicillin (Amp) and kanamycin (Kan) plates. The design is such that kanamycin selection should allow us to measure recombination, whereas ampicillin selection should allow us to measure end-joining. M5neo/S and M3neo/AP are methylated in vitro with the cytosine methylase, M. SssI. Although of bacterial origin, the SssI methylase mimics the mammalian methyltransferase, methylating all cytosine residues within the dinucleotide CpG(22Nur I. Szyf M. Razin A. Glaser G. Rottem S. Razin S. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 19-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Methylation is monitored by resistance of plasmid DNA to digestion by HpaII, which has a CCGG recognition sequence (Fig. 3). Methylated substrates are not cleaved by HpaII, whereas unmethylated substrates are cleaved to smaller fragments. Methylation appears to be highly efficient by this criteria. Prior to transfection of DNA into mammalian cells, we monitored the transformation efficiency of the methylated plasmid DNAs in E. coli. DNA was electroporated into E. coli strain DH12S, which is defective in the restriction of methylcytosine containing DNA. Transformation of the parental Mneo plasmid resulted in almost 2 × 106 colonies on either Amp or Kan plates, for an overall transformation efficiency of approximately 4 × 109 colonies/μg (Table 1). The efficiency was the same whether or not the DNA was methylated.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Transformation of M5neo/S, either methylated or unmethylated, resulted in an approximately 500-fold reduction in the number of AmpR transformants. This is a result of powerful exonucleolytic activities present in bacterial cells, which degrades incoming linear DNA. The resulting transformants are likely due to a low level of repair of the broken DNA molecules by the bacterial cells. No KanR colonies are obtained with M5neo/S, since the neo gene contains a 3′ truncation. The other recombination substrate, M3neo/AP, transforms bacteria to AmpR to an even lower level than M5neo/S, possibly due to the close proximity of the AatII site to the start of the amp gene. Thus, M3neo/AP plasmids which have recircularized may have defective amp genes. Alternatively, differences in the overhangs produced by restriction digestion may contribute to the lower transformation efficiency of M3neo/AP. As with M5neo/S, M3neo/AP does not give rise to KanR colonies due to truncation of the neo gene. M5neo/S and M3neo/AP were also mixed prior to transformation into bacteria. Although AmpR colonies were obtained at approximately the same level as that seen for M5neo/S alone, no KanR colonies were obtained, indicating that recombination between the two substrates is very inefficient during bacterial transformation. These results indicate that the bacterial transformation assay will be highly sensitive for the detection of recombination products and that cytosine methylation will not affect the outcome of the assay in bacteria. COS1 cells were transfected via electroporation with the methylated and unmethylated recombination substrates M5neo/S and M3neo/AP and with the positive control Mneo. After an incubation of 4 h, extrachromosomal DNA was recovered from the cells and subjected to Southern analysis. This allowed us to monitor the recovery of DNA and the retention of methylation. A similar amount of DNA was recovered whether or not the DNA was methylated (Fig. 4). DNA degradation appeared to be minimal during the 4-h incubation. Retention of methylation was monitored by HpaII digestion. Substrates that were methylated in vitro retained their methylation, as evidenced by their resistance to HpaII (Fig. 4). By contrast, unmethylated substrates were completely digested by HpaII to smaller fragments. To determine if methylation affects either extrachromosomal recombination or DNA end-joining, the COS1-transfected DNA was electroporated into E. coli DH12S (Table 2). Transfection of the parental Mneo plasmid, either methylated or unmethylated, into COS1 cells, did not affect its ability to confer AmpR or KanR to bacteria. Cotransfection of M5neo/S and M3neo/AP into COS1 cells, in contrast to cotransformation into bacteria, resulted in a large number of both AmpR and KanR colonies. Approximately 105 AmpR colonies and 103 KanR colonies were obtained, a 1% ratio of KanR colonies to AmpR colonies. Methylation of the DNA prior to transfection did not affect the number of AmpR or KanR colonies. Normalizing to Mneo, the yield of AmpR colonies from the M5neo/S and M3neo/AP cotransfection in COS1 cells was 73-fold higher than direct E. coli transformation, whereas the yield of KanR colonies was increased more than 2000-fold.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab No KanR colonies were obtained from transfecting M5neo/S or M3neo/AP separately into COS1 cells. In addition, premixing the M5neo/S and M3neo/AP which had been separately transfected upon electroporation into bacteria did not result in any KanR colonies, such that KanR was dependent upon cotransfection of both of the DNAs into COS1 cells. These results demonstrate that KanR is a result of homologous recombination between M5neo and M3neo in COS1 cells and, therefore, that extrachromosomal recombination is not affected by CpG methylation. The number of AmpR colonies provides a measure of DNA end-joining in COS1 cells. Transfection of unmethylated and methylated M5neo/S results in 1.7 × 104 and 2 × 104 colonies, respectively. Transfection of unmethylated and methylated M3neo/AP results in 5.1 × 104 and 4.3 × 104 colonies, respectively. These are roughly 2% (M5neo/S) and 6% (M3neo/AP) the number of colonies obtained with Mneo. These figures are substantially higher than what was seen with direct bacterial transformation of the plasmids (Table 1). For M5neo it is approximately 14-fold higher, whereas for M3neo it is more than 7000-fold higher. These results indicate that the COS1 cells are able to rejoin the broken DNA ends more efficiently than the bacterial cells and that this end-joining is unaffected by CpG methylation of the plasmid DNA. The DNA that was transfected into COS1 cells was first cleaved by the restriction endonucleases and then methylated. Since some of the CpG dinucleotides are located within or adjacent to the restriction sites, it is possible that these sites may remain unmethylated. To rule this out, we also performed experiments in which the methylation was performed prior to the restriction digestion. Nearly identical results were obtained in this experiment to those shown in Table 2(data not shown), proving that the methylation at the ends does not reduce end-joining efficiencies. As mentioned above, the difference between the M5neo/S and M3neo/AP plasmids in end-joining efficiencies in bacteria is likely due to the close proximity of the AatII site to the amp gene in M3neo. Alternatively, the particular restriction enzyme cleavage for the two plasmids may play a role. However, following COS1 cell transfection there is little difference between the two plasmids in the generation of AmpR colonies. These results indicate that the joining of ends differs mechanistically between mammalian cells and E. coli. Individual recombination and end-joining products were analyzed by preparing plasmid DNA from bacterial colonies and subjecting them to restriction analysis. For the recombination products, plasmids were prepared from 30 KanR colonies derived from COS1 cotransfection of M5neo/S and M3neo/AP for both the methylated and unmethylated samples (Fig. 5). Similar results were obtained. Most plasmids were identical to the positive Mneo control (R), indicating that recombination had occurred within both the neo gene and plasmid backbone sequences. A small number of plasmids (RE), 1 or 2 out of 30, had undergone recombination only within the neo gene. DNA end-joining had occurred to join the molecules within the plasmid backbone. To examine end-joining products, plasmids were prepared from 10 KanR/AmpR colonies from the cotransfection. One class of end-joining products (5E) had precisely rejoined the cohesive SphI ends of M5neo/S. This class consisted of three plasmids derived from the unmethylated sample and one plasmid from the methylated sample. The more numerous class of end-joining products (3E2) was derived from DNA end-joining of the AatII/PstI plasmid backbone fragment of M3neo/AP. This class consisted of seven plasmids from the unmethylated sample and nine plasmids from the methylated sample. Based on restriction analysis, most of the plasmids in this class contained only a limited modification of the AatII/PstI ends. AatII has a 3′ ACGT overhang and PstI has a 3′ TGCA overhang. The rejoining of these two heterologous ends is not unexpected, given the promiscuity of end-joining in mammalian cells (2Roth D.B. Wilson J.H. Kucherlapati R. Smith G.R. Genetic Recombination. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1988: 621-653Google Scholar). Bacterial transformation is sensitive yet indirect for assaying recombination and end-joining processes in mammalian cells. To directly monitor recombination and end-joining in COS1 cells, recovered plasmid DNA was analyzed by Southern blot analysis. A variety of products are expected in addition to those already observed by plasmid recovery (Fig. 6A). Recombination between M5neo/S and M3neo/AP can occur within either the neo gene homology (RE) or the plasmid backbone sequences (ER) or both (R). Similarly, end-joining can occur at the ends of the neo gene homology (ER), the plasmid backbone (RE), or both (EE). In addition, intramolecular end-joining products are also possible. The two M3neo/AP fragments can recircularize to form 3E1 and 3E2, although the latter is not detected since it does not hybridize to the neo probe. M5neo/S can recircularize to form 5E. (Although not illustrated, similar junctions can also be formed in these three cases by intermolecular end-joining of two identical fragments.) One other intermolecular junction is shown. This is formed by end-joining the two neo fragments from M5neo/S and M3neo/AP in opposite orientations (E). For Southern analysis, DNA is cleaved with HindIII and BamHI (Fig. 1) and probed with a neo gene fragment (Fig. 6B). No recombination or end-joining products are detected without prior transfection of DNA into mammalian cells (Fig. 6B, “C” lanes). However, a variety of products are detected upon transfection of either the methylated or unmethylated DNAs into COS1 cells (Fig. 6B, “T” lanes). Cotransfection of M5neo/S and M3neo/AP results in formation of both recombination and end-joining products. Recombination occurred within the neo gene (R and RE products) for about 5-10% of the input substrates and is similar in both the methylated and unmethylated samples. The Southern assay gives an apparently higher level of recombination than does the bacterial transformation assay. This difference is due to the nature of the two assays. Southern analysis directly examines the product of recombination within the neo gene. Bacterial transformation to kanamycin resistance requires a second event (recombination or end-joining) within the plasmid sequences, in addition to recombination within the neo gene, so as to generate a closed circular product. This requirement for a second event lowers the measured level of recombination in the bacterial transformation assay. As with the recombination product, end-joining products are also detected at similar levels in both the methylated and unmethylated samples. The intermolecular products (ER/EE and E) are only detected upon cotransfection of M5neo/S and M3neo/AP, whereas the intramolecular product 3E1 is detected in both the cotransfection and the transfection of M3neo/AP alone. The intramolecular product derived from M5neo/S is not separated from the input linearized M5neo/S in the HindIII/BamHI digest shown in Fig. 6B. However, this product is detected using other restriction digests (data not shown). We demonstrate that mammalian cytosine methylation has little or no effect on extrachromosomal recombination in tissue culture cells. End-joining processes also are unaffected by CpG methylation. These results were obtained using a highly sensitive bacterial transformation assay and were confirmed by direct Southern analysis of DNA recovered from transfected COS1 cells. These results are not unique to COS1 cells, since experiments performed in mouse embryonic stem cells have yielded similar results. 3F. Liang and M. Jasin, unpublished results. As with mammalian cells, transfection studies of plant protoplasts have demonstrated that CpG methylation does not affect extrachromosomal recombination(23Puchta H. Kocher S. Hohn B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3372-3379Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our substrates consist of bacterial plasmids carrying portions of the Tn5 neo gene. As with most bacterial genes, Tn5 neo is G/C-rich, rendering it a good model system in which to examine the effect of cytosine methylation. The CpG content is 9% of dinucleotides in the entire neo gene as well as 9% of dinucleotides in the 352 bp neo homology region. Even though the CpG content in mammalian genomic DNA is in general much lower (e.g. 1% of dinucleotides in human DNA), CpG islands have a higher CpG content. For example, 14% of dinucleotides in the 5′ region of the human PGK1 gene are CpG(24Pfeifer G.P. Steigerwald S.D. Hansen R.S. Gartler S.M. Riggs A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8252-8256Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is reasonable to use Tn5 neo as a model system to study the effect of cytosine methylation on homologous recombination in mammalian cells. As with extrachromosomal recombination, no effect of cytosine methylation is detected on DNA end-joining frequencies or products. CpG dinucleotides are located at two of the ends, as well as further in from the ends (Fig. 7). For M3neo/AP, there is a CpG dinucleotide within the AatII overhang itself, as well as 15-bp upstream of the cleavage site. The PstI end of M3neo/AP also has a CpG dinucleotide located 15 bp upstream. For M5neo/S, there are two CpG dinucleotides directly adjacent to the SphI site on one end. Both ends also have other CpG dinucleotides located further upstream (Fig. 7). The major end-joining products detected by the bacterial transformation assay involves recircularization of the M3neo/AP and M5neo/S plasmids (3E2 and 5E). As shown in Table 2, they are not affected by methylation. Thus, methylation within an overhang or adjacent to an overhang does not interfere with end-joining. We cannot rule out, however, that there are subtle differences between the methylated and unmethylated end-joining products from the M3neo/AP transformation. However, the M5neo/S end-joining appears to be identical whether or not the substrate is methylated, since the SphI cleavage site is restored. Thus, end-joining appears unaffected by general methylation of the substrates or methylation directly at the ends of a broken DNA molecule. The biochemical details of end-joining have not been fully elucidated. However, proteins such as the Ku autoantigen and its associated DNA-activated protein kinase are likely involved, since this complex binds to DNA ends(25Anderson C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 433-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). It may be that methylation does not affect binding of this complex or subsequent processing and ligation steps postulated to be involved in end-joining. Our results have demonstrated that extrachromosomal homologous recombination is unaffected by CpG methylation. Recombination in these substrates likely occurs via the single strand annealing pathway(4Lin F.-L. Sperle K. Sternberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1020-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 5Lin F.-L. Sperle K. Sternberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This pathway has the requirement that both recombination substrates be cut at or near the regions of homology(26Haber J.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 401-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The DNA ends may then provide an entry site for an exonuclease such that single strands are exposed for annealing. Mechanistically, our results suggest that CpG methylation has little or no effect on the exonuclease and strand annealing activities. A second pathway for homologous recombination, double strand break repair (27Szostak J.W. Orr-Weaver T.L. Rothstein R.J. Stahl F.W. Cell. 1983; 33: 25-35Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar) has also been shown to be operational in mammalian cells(28Jasin M. Berg P. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 1353-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 29Jasin M. deVilliers J. Weber F. Schaffner W. Cell. 1985; 43: 695-703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 30Valancius V. Smithies O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4389-4397Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In this pathway, a DNA substrate containing a double strand break is repaired from an unbroken homologous DNA template after strand invasion, conserving both partners of the recombination event. We cannot rule out that CpG methylation may have an effect on this pathway. Experiments that we have performed in which only one of the recombination substrates is broken and the other is introduced as a supercoiled plasmid have shown no difference between methylated and unmethylated substrates.3 However, considering the nonconservative nature of most recombination events between transfected DNAs(31Seidman M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3561-3565Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), these results are inconclusive regarding the double strand break repair pathway. Previous work has shown that CpG methylation and the accessibility of loci to site-specific recombinases are interrelated. A transgene locus that can undergo V(D)J recombination has been identified that is refractory to recombination when methylated yet accessible for recombination when unmethylated(32Engler P. Haasch D.

CpG methylated minichromosomes are also inaccessible for V(D)J recombination(33Hsieh C.-L. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Since the inhibition of V(D)J recombination is apparent only after replication of the minichromosomes, the interpretation of these results is that CpG methylation does not directly affect recombination, but rather results in an altered chromatin structure upon replication which inhibits V(D)J recombination(33Hsieh C.-L. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In addition, demethylation of endogenous T cell receptor and immunoglobulin gene loci has been shown to occur upon activation of lymphocytes which leads to T cell receptor recombination and Ig class switching, another site-specific recombination event(34Burger C. Radbruch A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 2285-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, although we find that methylation has no effect on the homologous recombination of extrachromosomal DNA, methylation may yet to be found to exert effects on chromosomal DNA by altering the accessibility of DNA to recombination machinery We thank members of the Jasin laboratory, especially Rich Bennett, Peter Romanienko, Philippe Rouet, and Fatima Smih, for assistance in various facets of this project."
https://openalex.org/W2028148394,"A computer program for predicting DNA bending from nucleotide sequence was used to identify circular structures in retroviral and cellular genomes. An 830-base pair circular structure was located in a control region near the center of the genome of the human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-I). This unusual structure displayed relatively smooth planar bending throughout its length. The structure is conserved in diverse isolates of HIV-I, HIV-II, and simian immunodeficiency viruses, which implies that it is under selective constraints. A search of all sequences in the GenBank data base was carried out in order to identify similar circular structures in cellular DNA. The results revealed that the structures are associated with a wide range of sequences that undergo recombination, including most known examples of DNA inversion and subtelomeric translocation systems. Circular structures were also associated with replication and transposition systems where DNA looping has been implicated in the generation of large protein-DNA complexes. Experimental evidence for the structures was provided by studies which demonstrated that two sequences detected as circular by computer preferentially formed covalently closed circles during ligation reactions <i>in vitro</i> when compared to nonbent fragments, bent fragments with noncircular shapes, and total genomic DNA. In addition, a single T → C substitution in one of these sequences rendered it less planar as seen by computer analysis and significantly reduced its rate of ligase-catalyzed cyclization. These results permit us to speculate that intrinsically circular structures facilitate DNA looping during formation of the large protein-DNA complexes that are involved in site- and region-specific recombination and in other genomic processes."
