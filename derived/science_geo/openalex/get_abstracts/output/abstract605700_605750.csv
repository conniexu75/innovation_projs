https://openalex.org/W2793785833,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent modification in eukaryotic messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and is interpreted by its readers, such as YTH domain-containing proteins, to regulate mRNA fate. Here, we report the insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding proteins (IGF2BPs; including IGF2BP1/2/3) as a distinct family of m6A readers that target thousands of mRNA transcripts through recognizing the consensus GG(m6A)C sequence. In contrast to the mRNA-decay-promoting function of YTH domain-containing family protein 2, IGF2BPs promote the stability and storage of their target mRNAs (for example, MYC) in an m6A-dependent manner under normal and stress conditions and therefore affect gene expression output. Moreover, the K homology domains of IGF2BPs are required for their recognition of m6A and are critical for their oncogenic functions. Thus, our work reveals a different facet of the m6A-reading process that promotes mRNA stability and translation, and highlights the functional importance of IGF2BPs as m6A readers in post-transcriptional gene regulation and cancer biology. Huang et al. identify IGF2BPs as an additional class of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) reader proteins. They find that IGF2BPs selectively bind to m6A-containing mRNAs and promote their stability."

Under three-drug immunosuppression, grafts survived at least 9 months postinjury and expressed both neuronal and glial markers. Monkey axons regenerated into grafts and formed synapses. Hundreds of thousands of human axons extended out from grafts through monkey white matter and synapsed in distal gray matter. Grafts gradually matured over 9 months and improved forelimb function beginning several months after grafting. These findings in a 'preclinical trial' support translation of NPC graft therapy to humans with the objective of reconstituting both a neuronal and glial milieu in the site of spinal cord injury."
https://openalex.org/W2788731808,"Neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation can influence immune responses and suppress inflammation in the CNS. Metabolites, such as succinate, modulate the phenotype and function of immune cells, but whether and how NSCs are also activated by such immunometabolites to control immunoreactivity and inflammatory responses is unclear. Here, we show that transplanted somatic and directly induced NSCs ameliorate chronic CNS inflammation by reducing succinate levels in the cerebrospinal fluid, thereby decreasing mononuclear phagocyte (MP) infiltration and secondary CNS damage. Inflammatory MPs release succinate, which activates succinate receptor 1 (SUCNR1)/GPR91 on NSCs, leading them to secrete prostaglandin E2 and scavenge extracellular succinate with consequential anti-inflammatory effects. Thus, our work reveals an unexpected role for the succinate-SUCNR1 axis in somatic and directly induced NSCs, which controls the response of stem cells to inflammatory metabolic signals released by type 1 MPs in the chronically inflamed brain."
https://openalex.org/W2788322008,"With the ongoing demographic and epidemiological transition, cancer is emerging as a major public health concern in India. This paper uses nationally representative household survey to examine the overall prevalence and economic burden of cancer in India. The age-standardized prevalence of cancer is estimated to be 97 per 100,000 persons with greater prevalence in urban areas. The evidence suggests that cancer prevalence is highest among the elderly and also among females in the reproductive age groups. Cancer displays a significant socioeconomic gradient even after adjusting for age-sex specifics and clustering in a multilevel regression framework. We find that out of pocket expenditure on cancer treatment is among the highest for any ailment. The average out of pocket spending on inpatient care in private facilities is about three-times that of public facilities. Furthermore, treatment for about 40 percent of cancer hospitalization cases is financed mainly through borrowings, sale of assets and contributions from friends and relatives. Also, over 60 percent of the households who seek care from the private sector incur out of pocket expenditure in excess of 20 percent of their annual per capita household expenditure. Given the catastrophic implications, this study calls for a disease-based approach towards financing such high-cost ailment. It is suggested that universal cancer care insurance should be envisaged and combined with existing accident and life insurance policies for the poorer sections in India. In concluding, we call for policies to improve cancer survivorship through effective prevention and early detection. In particular, greater public health investments in infrastructure, human resources and quality of care deserve priority attention."
https://openalex.org/W2788806184,"Rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep are controlled by specific neuronal circuits. Here we show that galanin-expressing GABAergic neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) comprise separate subpopulations with opposing effects on REM versus NREM sleep. Microendoscopic calcium imaging revealed diverse sleep-wake activity of DMH GABAergic neurons, but the galanin-expressing subset falls into two distinct groups, either selectively activated (REM-on) or suppressed (REM-off) during REM sleep. Retrogradely labeled, preoptic area (POA)-projecting galaninergic neurons are REM-off, whereas the raphe pallidus (RPA)-projecting neurons are primarily REM-on. Bidirectional optogenetic manipulations showed that the POA-projecting neurons promote NREM sleep and suppress REM sleep, while the RPA-projecting neurons have the opposite effects. Thus, REM/NREM switch is regulated antagonistically by DMH galaninergic neurons with intermingled cell bodies but distinct axon projections."
https://openalex.org/W2793119253,"In the absence of genital inflammation, tenofovir gel provides superior prevention against HIV acquisition in women. Several clinical trials have demonstrated that antiretroviral (ARV) drugs taken as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) can prevent HIV infection1, with the magnitude of protection ranging from −49 to 86% (refs. 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11). Although these divergent outcomes are thought to be due primarily to differences in product adherence12, biological factors likely contribute13. Despite selective recruitment of higher-risk participants for prevention trials, HIV risk is heterogeneous even within higher-risk groups14,15,16. To determine whether this heterogeneity could influence patient outcomes following PrEP, we undertook a post hoc prospective analysis of results from the CAPRISA 004 trial for 1% tenofovir gel (n = 774 patients), one of the first trials to demonstrate protection against HIV infection. Concentrations of nine proinflammatory cytokines were measured in cervicovaginal lavages at >2,000 visits, and a graduated cytokine score was used to define genital inflammation. In women without genital inflammation, tenofovir was 57% protective against HIV (95% confidence interval (CI): 7–80%) but was 3% protective (95% CI: −104–54%) if genital inflammation was present. Among women who highly adhered to the gel, tenofovir protection was 75% (95% CI: 25–92%) in women without inflammation compared to −10% (95% CI: −184–57%) in women with inflammation. Immunological predictors of HIV risk may modify the effectiveness of tools for HIV prevention; reducing genital inflammation in women may augment HIV prevention efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2789330893,"Severe anemia and iron deficiency are common complications in chronic kidney disease. The cause of renal anemia is multifactorial and includes decreased erythropoietin (Epo) production, iron deficiency, and inflammation, and it is currently treated with injections of synthetic Epo. However, the use of recombinant Epo has several adverse effects. We previously reported that high fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) levels in mice are associated with decreased red blood cell production, whereas genetic inactivation of Fgf23 results in expansion of the erythroid lineage. The present study is the first to show that high FGF23 levels in a mouse model of renal failure contribute to renal anemia, and inhibiting FGF23 signaling stimulates erythropoiesis and abolishes anemia and iron deficiency. Moreover, we show that inhibition of FGF23 signaling significantly decreases erythroid cell apoptosis and influences the commitment of hematopoietic stem cells toward the erythroid linage. Furthermore, we show that blocking FGF23 signaling attenuates inflammation, resulting in increased serum iron and ferritin levels. Our data clearly demonstrate that elevated FGF23 is a causative factor in the development of renal anemia and iron deficiency, and importantly, blocking FGF23 signaling represents a novel approach to stimulate erythropoiesis and possibly improve survival for millions of chronic kidney disease patients worldwide.—Agoro, R., Montagna, A., Goetz, R., Aligbe, O., Singh, G., Coe, L.

https://openalex.org/W2949366006,"Understanding patterns of species occurrence and the processes underlying these patterns is fundamental to the study of ecology. One of the more commonly used approaches to investigate species occurrence patterns is occupancy modeling, which can account for imperfect detection of a species during surveys. In recent years, there has been a proliferation of Bayesian modeling in ecology, which includes fitting Bayesian occupancy models. The Bayesian framework is appealing to ecologists for many reasons, including the ability to incorporate prior information through the specification of prior distributions on parameters. While ecologists almost exclusively intend to choose priors so that they are “uninformative” or “vague”, such priors can easily be unintentionally highly informative. Here we report on how the specification of a “vague” normally distributed (i.e., Gaussian) prior on coefficients in Bayesian occupancy models can unintentionally influence parameter estimation. Using both simulated data and empirical examples, we illustrate how this issue likely compromises inference about species-habitat relationships. While the extent to which these informative priors influence inference depends on the data set, researchers fitting Bayesian occupancy models should conduct sensitivity analyses to ensure intended inference, or employ less commonly used priors that are less informative (e.g., logistic or t prior distributions). We provide suggestions for addressing this issue in occupancy studies, and an online tool for exploring this issue under different contexts."

While nanomolar intracellular concentrations of Ca2+ produce an outwardly rectifying current, micromolar and higher concentrations of Ca2+ elicit an Ohmic current. The transition between rectifying and Ohmic currents can be achieved at lower concentrations of intracellular Ca2+ if extracellular Cl− is replaced with more permeant anions such as I− (Cruz-Rangel et al., 2017Cruz-Rangel S. De Jesús-Pérez J.J. Aréchiga-Figueroa I.A. Rodríguez-Menchaca A.A. Pérez-Cornejo P. Hartzell H.C. Arreola J. Extracellular protons enable activation of the calcium-dependent chloride channel TMEM16A.J. Physiol. 2017; 595: 1515-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A kinetic model of gating has been proposed to account for contributions from these different stimuli (Contreras-Vite et al., 2016Contreras-Vite J.A. Cruz-Rangel S. De Jesús-Pérez J.J. Figueroa I.A. Rodríguez-Menchaca A.A. Pérez-Cornejo P. Hartzell H.C. Arreola J.

We propose that CaCC gating stems from the following voltage-dependent processes: (1) Ca2+ binding occurs at a site within the membrane voltage field, causing an increase in the apparent binding affinity of the channel for Ca2+ at depolarizing voltages; (2) extracellular anions potentiate anion flux by binding to one or more modulatory sites inside the electric field of a multi-ion pore; and/or (3) TMEM16A channels undergo voltage-dependent conformational changes, leading to a non-linear conductance/voltage relationship. Here, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the fungal homolog nhTMEM16 and incorporated TMEM16A structural information to dissect gating behavior in TMEM16A channel mutants. We found that transmembrane segment 6 (TM6), which is α-helical in both nhTMEM16 (Brunner et al., 2014Brunner J.D. Lim N.K. Schenck S. Duerst A. Dutzler R.

An alanine mutagenesis scan identified mutations that shifted the EC50 for Ca2+ gating at +60 mV. Subsequent analysis revealed that several of these mutations decoupled the Ca2+, anion, and voltage-dependent gating processes, allowing us to study these processes in isolation. Our fast solution exchange pharmacology and patch-clamp analyses established that depolarization, intracellular Ca2+, and external anions all act upon TM6 to permit the flow of anions through the channel. Furthermore, the transfer of a mildly voltage-dependent intrinsic gating element involves at least two conformational changes of or about TM6, which influence and are influenced by the binding of intracellular Ca2+ ions and the identity of the permeating anion. Gating of TMEM16A-CaCCs is sensitive to intracellular Ca2+ level and the identity of permeant anions. To characterize these gating processes, we transiently expressed TMEM16A from mus musculus, fused to pEGFP at its C terminus—which we have previously found to function identically to wild-type (Tien et al., 2014Tien J. Peters C.J. Wong X.M. Cheng T. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Yang H.

Exposing cells expressing WT TMEM16A to 400 nM Ca2+ allowed the channel to act as an outward rectifier, with the primary flux being inward flowing Cl− ions (Figures 1A–1C). Replacement of Cl− ions with I− ions caused shifts in the reversal potential (Peters et al., 2015Peters C.J. Yu H. Tien J. Jan Y.N. Li M. Jan L.Y. Four basic residues critical for the ion selectivity and pore blocker sensitivity of TMEM16A calcium-activated chloride channels.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Increasing intracellular Ca2+ to 1 mM caused the channel to permit inward currents at hyperpolarizing voltages (i.e., outward flow of Cl−), leading to a nearly voltage-independent conductance-voltage relationship (Figures 1A–1C). The physical bases for how membrane voltage, intracellular Ca2+ ions, and extracellular permeant anions interact to contribute to TMEM16A gating remain intriguing open questions (Figure 1D). To analyze the molecular basis of channel gating, we examined an atomic resolution structure of nhTMEM16 from Nectria hematococca, PDB: 4WIS (Brunner et al., 2014Brunner J.D. Lim N.K. Schenck S.

Grabe M. Atomistic insight into lipid translocation by a TMEM16 scramblase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113: 14049-14054Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, nhTMEM16 was embedded in a phosphatidylcholine bilayer, and we ran a number of atomistic simulations consisting of 3.2 μs total aggregate time. Reasoning that components of the channel involved in gating would likely be dynamic and simulation may result in new protein conformations indicative of the gating motions, we aligned snapshots of the protein taken every 16 ns and calculated the root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) of TM6 as well as the other two helices harboring residues involved in Ca2+ binding (TM7 and TM8). Figure S1A shows the TM6 helix from our 200 snapshots overlaid onto the structure of the first snapshot. TM6 has a relatively high degree of flexibility, consistent with a poorly ordered or highly mobile region. For instance, the RMSF of the cytoplasmic end of TM6 is 1.5 Å (Figure S1B). Consistent with the notion that TM6 represents a region of flexibility, two recent studies of TMEM16A structures revealed that the conformation of TM6 depends on the cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) conditions (Paulino et al., 2017Paulino C. Kalienkova V. Lam A.K.M. Neldner Y. Dutzler R.

TM6 of TMEM16A reconstituted in nanodiscs (Dang et al., 2017Dang S. Feng S. Tien J. Peters C.J. Bulkley D. Lolicato M. Zhao J. Qi L. Chen T. Jan Y.N. et al.Cryo-EM structures of the TMEM16A calcium-activated chloride channel.Nature. 2017; 552: 426-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) is largely α-helical, whereas the C-terminal half of TM6 in TMEM16A solubilized with lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol is unresolved, indicative of flexibility (Dang et al., 2017Dang S. Feng S. Tien J. Peters C.J. Bulkley D. Lolicato M. Zhao J. Qi L. Chen T. Jan Y.N. et al.Cryo-EM structures of the TMEM16A calcium-activated chloride channel.Nature. 2017; 552: 426-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Alignment of TM6 of TMEM16A with that of other family members (Figure 2A) demonstrates that it is particularly well conserved in TMEM16B, a highly similar CaCC. A model based on an atomic resolution cryo-EM structure of TMEM16A in nanodiscs was used to map the pore-lining surface in dark gray (Figure 2B). Reasoning that TM6 at the interface between the permeation path and the Ca2+-binding site is ideally situated to contribute to channel gating, we performed alanine scanning mutagenesis of TM6 (Figure 2A). Of the 28 mutant constructs tested in HEK293 cells, 25 produced observable currents in inside-out patches exposed to Ca2+ from the cytoplasmic side and held at +60 mV. Of the remaining three constructs with negligible currents, two (M638A and P654A) appeared to be poorly trafficked to the membrane, while L643A reached the membrane but was electrically non-functional (Figures S2A and S2B). To characterize channel mutants, we exposed inside-out membrane patches from HEK293 cells to a series of solutions containing fixed concentrations of Cl− ions but increasing concentrations of free Ca2+ ions (see sample traces in Figure 2C). We normalized the currents at various Ca2+ concentrations to current amplitude at a saturating concentration of Ca2+ (1 mM for most constructs; 10 mM for E650A) and fitted with sigmoidal concentration-response curves (Equation 1 in STAR Methods) to derive the EC50s and Hill coefficients (Figures 2D and 2E). Mutation at a known Ca2+-binding residue, E650 (Tien et al., 2014Tien J. Peters C.J. Wong X.M. Cheng T. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Yang H.

Numerous other residues N-terminal to the Ca2+-binding residues of TM6 also produced statistically significant reductions in apparent Ca2+ sensitivity (Figure 2D). However, we also noticed that several residues within TM6 increased apparent Ca2+ sensitivity, including some that significantly reduced the Hill coefficient (Figure 2E). Because these mutated residues are not implicated in Ca2+ binding, we hypothesized that they may increase apparent Ca2+ sensitivity by producing conformational changes that facilitate either Ca2+ ion binding or channel activation after Ca2+ binding. Next, we characterized mutants resulting in significant increases in apparent Ca2+ sensitivity, reasoning that they were likely involved in channel gating rather than directly affecting Ca2+ binding. We tested all such alanine mutant constructs in Ca2+-free internal solutions using whole-cell patch clamp. Remarkably, I637A and Q645A, the two mutations producing the largest sensitizing shifts, resulted in an outward-rectifying current-voltage relationship within the physiological range in the absence of Ca2+ (Figures 3A–3C). Channels with mutations at G640, K641, L648, and I653 remained incapable of opening in the absence of Ca2+ up to +200 mV (Figures S3A and S3B). We confirmed the bona fide “Ca2+-independent” activation in Q645A by showing that channel activity remained the same with 5 mM BAPTA and 1 mM EDTA added to our normal “Ca2+-free solution” (which contained 5 mM EGTA) and with omission of Mg2+ ions, which do not normally activate TMEM16A (Ni et al., 2014Ni Y.L. Kuan A.S. Chen T.Y. Activation and inhibition of TMEM16A calcium-activated chloride channels.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e86734Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), out of concern that the mutation may have sensitized the channel to Mg2+. In addition, equivalent mutations in the TMEM16B channel also exhibited Ca2+-independent activation, albeit requiring more depolarizing voltages and producing smaller apparent whole-cell currents (Figures S3C and S3D). To confirm that these mutations changed TMEM16A-gating properties while preserving its channel permeation characteristics, we performed non-stationary fluctuation analysis of Q645A (Figures S4A and S4B) (Heinemann and Conti, 1992Heinemann S.H. Conti F. Nonstationary noise analysis and application to patch clamp recordings.Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 131-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and showed that the single-channel conductance of Q645A was 3.2 ± 0.4 pS, which is comparable to that of WT at 2.8 ± 0.5 pS (Figure S4C) and consistent with previous reports (Manoury et al., 2010Manoury B.

Mechanism of allosteric activation of TMEM16A/ANO1 channels by a commonly used chloride channel blocker.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2016; 173: 511-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We also exposed this channel to a series of bi-ionic anion replacement solutions with internal solutions containing Cl− and external solutions containing another anion species or 14 mM NaCl supplemented with D-mannitol and found a selectivity sequence among the anions tested of PI>PCl>PF>PMES>PAspartate>PGluconate and a PNa+/PCl− of 0.10 (Figures S4D–S4F), consistent with previous findings for WT TMEM16A. Finally, we compared the conductance-voltage relationships of Q645A exposed to NaCl and NMDG-Cl and found no change in the waveform, suggesting that the monovalent cationic species did not influence the conductance-voltage relationship. Taken together, these results suggest that TM6 mutations are capable of shifting Ca2+ sensitivity and allowing the mutant channel to activate in the absence of Ca2+ at depolarizing voltages without affecting ion selectivity or the single-channel conductance. Notably, the two mutants with sensitizing shifts in both voltage-dependent and Ca2+-dependent gating remained sensitive to the concentration and identity of external anionic species, similar to an effect seen previously for heterologously expressed TMEM16A and endogenous CaCC in Xenopus oocytes (Perez-Cornejo et al., 2004Perez-Cornejo P.

Revealing the activation pathway for TMEM16A chloride channels from macroscopic currents and kinetic models.Pflugers Arch. 2016; 468: 1241-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Furthermore, plotting I637A and Q645A whole-cell conductances for Cl− and I− against voltage revealed that the channel open probability (Po) did not saturate even at strongly depolarizing (e.g., +150 mV) potentials (Figure 3C). When plotted with a semi-Log ordinate, normalized G-V increased linearly with voltage even at strongly depolarizing potentials (Figure 3D), unlike outwardly rectifying potassium channels (Zagotta et al., 1994Zagotta W.N. Hoshi T. Dittman J. Aldrich R.W. Shaker potassium channel gating. II: Transitions in the activation pathway.J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 279-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) with Po approaching 1 under depolarizing conditions due to full activation of all voltage sensors. Replacing external Cl− with I− caused the G-V curve to shift leftward while retaining a positive slope (Figure 3D). These results implicate the involvement of anions with a binding site accessible to the external medium in a rate-limiting process for the apparent voltage dependence of channel conductance. To parse the effects of external anion binding, we recorded whole-cell currents of Q645A with internal Cl− replaced with aspartate ions that cannot easily pass through CaCCs to yield near unidirectional anionic fluxes with amplitudes proportional to the kON of anions from the extracellular milieu to an external binding site. As kON is also dependent on the concentration of anions in the bulk external solution, we applied varying concentrations of Cl− or I− and quantified"

Interactions and mergers are thought to dominate the early histories of most galaxies, ours included. Two groups of stars that are kinematically distinct from the surrounding halo stars have been found about 5 kiloparsecs above and below the plane of the Milky Way. Maria Bergemann and colleagues used spectroscopic studies of 14 of the brightest of these stars to determine their chemical abundances. They find that the two groups have the same abundance patterns, which also match the patterns of stars in the Galactic disk. They conclude that the groups were removed from the disk as a result of tidal interactions with passing or merging dwarf galaxies. Our Galaxy is thought to have an active evolutionary history, dominated over the past ten billion years or so by star formation, the accretion of cold gas and, in particular, the merging of clumps of baryonic and dark matter1,2. The stellar halo—the faint, roughly spherical component of the Galaxy—reveals rich ‘fossil’ evidence of these interactions, in the form of stellar streams, substructures and chemically distinct stellar components3,4,5. The effects of interactions with dwarf galaxies on the content and morphology of the Galactic disk are still being explored. Recent studies have identified kinematically distinct stellar substructures and moving groups of stars in our Galaxy, which may have extragalactic origins6,7. There is also mounting evidence that stellar overdensities (regions with greater-than-average stellar density) at the interface between the outer disk and the halo could have been caused by the interaction of a dwarf galaxy with the disk8,9,10. Here we report a spectroscopic analysis of 14 stars from two stellar overdensities, each lying about five kiloparsecs above or below the Galactic plane—locations suggestive of an association with the stellar halo. We find that the chemical compositions of these two groups of stars are almost identical, both within and between these overdensities, and closely match the abundance patterns of stars in the Galactic disk. We conclude that these stars came from the disk, and that the overdensities that they are part of were created by tidal interactions of the disk with passing or merging dwarf galaxies11,12."
https://openalex.org/W2788101481,"Organelles are intracellular compartments which are themselves compartmentalized. Biogenic and metabolic processes are localized to specialized domains or microcompartments to enhance their efficiency and suppress deleterious side reactions. An example of intra-organellar compartmentalization is the pyrenoid in the chloroplasts of algae and hornworts. This microcompartment enhances the photosynthetic CO2-fixing activity of the Calvin-Benson cycle enzyme Rubisco, suppresses an energetically wasteful oxygenase activity of Rubisco, and mitigates limiting CO2 availability in aquatic environments. Hence, the pyrenoid is functionally analogous to the carboxysomes in cyanobacteria. However, a comprehensive analysis of pyrenoid functions based on its protein composition is lacking. Here we report a proteomic characterization of the pyrenoid in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Pyrenoid-enriched fractions were analyzed by quantitative mass spectrometry. Contaminant proteins were identified by parallel analyses of pyrenoid-deficient mutants. This pyrenoid proteome contains 190 proteins, many of which function in processes that are known or proposed to occur in pyrenoids: e.g. the carbon concentrating mechanism, starch metabolism or RNA metabolism and translation. Using radioisotope pulse labeling experiments, we show that pyrenoid-associated ribosomes could be engaged in the localized synthesis of the large subunit of Rubisco. New pyrenoid functions are supported by proteins in tetrapyrrole and chlorophyll synthesis, carotenoid metabolism or amino acid metabolism. Hence, our results support the long-standing hypothesis that the pyrenoid is a hub for metabolism. The 81 proteins of unknown function reveal candidates for new participants in these processes. Our results provide biochemical evidence of pyrenoid functions and a resource for future research on pyrenoids and their use to enhance agricultural plant productivity.

Nonetheless, many molecular details remain unclear. Tumor cells frequently exhibit increased α2–6 sialylation on N-glycans, a modification that is added by the ST6Gal-I sialyltransferase, and emerging evidence suggests that ST6Gal-I–mediated sialylation promotes the survival of tumor cells exposed to various cell stressors. Here we report that ST6Gal-I protects cancer cells from hypoxic stress. It is well known that hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) is stabilized in hypoxic cells, and, in turn, HIF-1α directs the transcription of genes important for cell survival. To investigate a putative role for ST6Gal-I in the hypoxic response, we examined HIF-1α accumulation in ovarian and pancreatic cancer cells in ST6Gal-I overexpression or knockdown experiments. We found that ST6Gal-I activity augmented HIF-1α accumulation in cells grown in a hypoxic environment or treated with two chemical hypoxia mimetics, deferoxamine and dimethyloxalylglycine. Correspondingly, hypoxic cells with high ST6Gal-I expression had increased mRNA levels of HIF-1α transcriptional targets, including the glucose transporter genes GLUT1 and GLUT3 and the glycolytic enzyme gene PDHK1. Interestingly, high ST6Gal-I–expressing cells also had an increased pool of HIF-1α mRNA, suggesting that ST6Gal-I may influence HIF-1α expression. Finally, cells grown in hypoxia for several weeks displayed enriched ST6Gal-I expression, consistent with a pro-survival function.

Exchanges of information between blood components and ECs are important for EC function. Hence, the present study sought to determine how platelets induce EC dysfunction under hypertensive conditions. EC proliferation was increased in renal hypertensive rats established by abdominal aortic coarctation compared with control rats and that elevated thrombin in plasma promoted platelet activation, which may induce the release of platelet-derived microparticles (PMPs). MicroRNA (MiR) array and qPCR revealed a higher level of miR-142-3p in platelets and PMPs. In vitro, PMPs delivered miR-142-3p into ECs and enhanced their proliferation via Bcl-2-associated transcription factor (BCLAF)1 and its downstream genes. These results indicate that PMPs deliver miR-142-3p from activated platelets into ECs and that miR-142-3p may play important roles in EC dysfunction in hypertensive conditions and may be a novel therapeutic target for maintaining EC homeostasis in hypertension.-Bao, H., Chen, Y.-X., Huang, K., Zhuang, F., Bao, M., Han, Y., Chen, X.-H., Shi, Q., Yao, Q.-P., Qi, Y.-X.

https://openalex.org/W2788283103,"Compartmentalization of calcium-dependent plasticity allows for rapid actin remodeling in dendritic spines. However, molecular mechanisms for the spatio-temporal regulation of filamentous actin (F-actin) dynamics by spinous Ca2+-transients are still poorly defined. We show that the postsynaptic Ca2+ sensor caldendrin orchestrates nano-domain actin dynamics that are essential for actin remodeling in the early phase of long-term potentiation (LTP). Steep elevation in spinous [Ca2+]i disrupts an intramolecular interaction of caldendrin and allows cortactin binding. The fast on and slow off rate of this interaction keeps cortactin in an active conformation, and protects F-actin at the spine base against cofilin-induced severing. Caldendrin gene knockout results in higher synaptic actin turnover, altered nanoscale organization of spinous F-actin, defects in structural spine plasticity, LTP, and hippocampus-dependent learning. Collectively, the data indicate that caldendrin-cortactin directly couple [Ca2+]i to preserve a minimal F-actin pool that is required for actin remodeling in the early phase of LTP."
https://openalex.org/W2789111316,"In this study, we investigated the effects of the dual phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/mechanistic target of rapamycin (PI3K/MTOR) inhibitor dactolisib (NVP-BEZ235), the PI3K/MTOR/bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) inhibitor SF2523, and the bromodomain and extra terminal domain inhibitor JQ1 on the productive infection of primary macrophages with human immunodeficiency type-1 (HIV). These inhibitors did not alter the initial susceptibility of macrophages to HIV infection. However, dactolisib, JQ1, and SF2523 all decreased HIV replication in macrophages in a dose-dependent manner via degradation of intracellular HIV through autophagy. Macrophages treated with dactolisib, JQ1, or SF2523 displayed an increase in LC3B lipidation combined with SQSTM1 degradation without inducing increased cell death.

HIV survival is dependent on its ability to exploit host cell machinery for replication and dissemination and to circumvent cellular processes that prevent its growth. One such mechanism of avoiding the innate immune system is the ability of HIV to inhibit or subvert macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy). Autophagy is a degradation pathway that occurs at basal levels in all cells whereby cytosolic double-membrane–bound compartments, termed autophagosomes, engulf and sequester cytoplasmic constituents such as subcellular organelles and microbial pathogens. These autophagosomes then fuse with lysosomes forming autophagolysosomes (autolysosomes), resulting in the degradation of the engulfed components, generating nutrients and macromolecular precursors. Autophagy is up-regulated in response to stress such as starvation, drug treatment, and infection. Of the more than 35 human autophagy-associated genes currently known to be involved in autophagy, 10 are known to be essential for HIV replication (5Campbell G.R. Spector S.A.

However, although HIV may require the early stages of autophagy, it must control the antiviral proteolytic and degradative late stages of autophagy to avoid its degradation. In HIV-infected macrophages, Nef binds to and sequesters beclin 1 (BECN1) to the Golgi complex leading to the phosphorylation and cytosolic sequestration of transcription factor EB, culminating in the blocking of the degradative stages of autophagy and the accumulation of autophagic factors (6Kyei G.B.

Therefore, autophagy shows promise as a target for drug therapy. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is a major focus for drug development due to its function as a key regulator of cell growth and survival, and cancer genetic studies suggest that the PI3K pathway is frequently altered in human tumors (14Lui V.W.

Ericson K. Oncogenic PI3K and its role in cancer.Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2006; 18 (16357568): 77-8210.1097/01.cco.0000198021.99347.b9Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 16Song M.S. Salmena L.

Key targets of PI3K include the AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 (AKT1) and the mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) pathway. Drugs targeting the PI3K/AKT1/MTOR axis include pan-PI3K inhibitors, isoform-selective PI3K inhibitors, sirolimus and analogs, active-site MTOR inhibitors, and dual-PI3K/MTOR and AKT1 inhibitors. Dactolisib (also known as BEZ235 and NVP-BEZ235) is an imidazoquinoline derivative that has dual ATP-competitive inhibition of PI3K and MTOR (17Maira S.M. Stauffer F. Brueggen J. Furet P. Schnell C.

By inhibiting MTOR through binding at the ATP-cleft, dactolisib prevents the phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6 kinase B2 (RPS6KB2) and other MTOR complex 1 (MTORC1) downstream effectors, leading to a release of autophagy inhibition by MTORC1. It is also effective in blocking AKT1 activation as it prevents the feedback activation of PI3K signaling normally observed with MTOR inhibitors, such as sirolimus (18Chiarini F. Grimaldi C. Ricci F.

Thus, design of PI3K/MTOR/BRD4 inhibitors where BRD4 inhibitors can induce activation of latent virus and PI3K/MTOR inhibitor can induce autophagy could be an effective strategy to eradicate HIV-infected T cells or macrophages. SF2523 is a novel and the only existing PI3K/MTOR/BRD4 inhibitor (31Singh A. Joshi S. Garlich J.R. Morales G. Kutateladze T. Andrews F. Durden D.

SF2523 is (i) a pan PI3K inhibitor at a Ki of 19 and 35 nm for PIK3CA and PIK3CD, respectively; (ii) inhibits BRD4 binding to MYCN promoter equivalent to JQ1 (1 μm) and blocks MYCN transcription; (iii) pharmacodynamically inhibits AKT1 activation by blocking phosphorylation of AKT1 at Ser473 in macrophages; (iv) blocks BRD4 binding to the acetyl-lysine–binding site on histone H3K27; (v) blocks M1–M2 macrophage transition and augments immunity (32Joshi S.

SF2523 has been formulated for oral absorption, has excellent pharmacokinetic and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion properties, and is slated to enter clinical trials in the near future (CA192656). These characteristics in a single pill opened new opportunities to explore this drug for HIV therapy as it has the potential to induce both the “shock” and the “kill” arms of the “shock and kill” treatment strategy. In this study we investigated the effect of dactolisib, JQ1, and SF2523 on the susceptibility of macrophages to HIV infection. We report that these inhibitors have no impact on the initial infection events, but through the induction of autophagy they induce the degradation of intracellular viral particles that leads to a reduction in viral release. Moreover, our data demonstrate that the dactolisib-mediated autophagic degradation of HIV requires the nucleation and formation of autophagosomes and their subsequent maturation, which leads to a decrease in virion release. Previous studies demonstrated that addition of dactolisib to continuous transformed cell lines or primary carcinomas leads to the induction of autophagy (18Chiarini F. Grimaldi C. Ricci F.

However, because the effects of drugs on primary cells can be different from those observed in continuous cell lines, we investigated the ability of dactolisib to induce autophagy in primary human macrophages. During autophagy, cytosolic microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3β (MAP1LC3B or LC3B) I is converted to LC3B-II by a ubiquitin-like system that involves autophagy-related (ATG) 7, ATG3, and the ATG12–ATG5 complex. The ATG12–ATG5 complex ligates LC3B-II to the nascent autophagosome membrane through phosphatidylethanolamine with the LC3B-II associated with the inner membrane degraded after fusion of the autophagosome with lysosomes. Therefore, the conversion of LC3B-I to LC3B-II and its turnover is an indicator of autophagy induction and flux (40Klionsky D.J. Abdelmohsen K. Abe A. Abedin M.J. Abeliovich H. Acevedo Arozena A. Adachi H. Adams C.M. Adams P.D. Adeli K. Adhihetty P.J. Adler S.G. Agam G. Agarwal R. Aghi M.K. et al.Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy (3rd edition).Autophagy. 2016; 12 (26799652): 1-22210.1080/15548627.2015.1100356Crossref PubMed Scopus (3982) Google Scholar). Exposure of macrophages to dactolisib for 24 h led to a dose-dependent increase in LC3B-II similar to that observed with sirolimus, an inducer of autophagy through inhibition of MTORC1 (Fig. 1A). To verify that the increase in LC3 lipidation in dactolisib-treated cells versus control cells represents increased autophagic flux rather than an accumulation of LC3B-II, the degradation of the polyubiquitin-binding protein sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1 or p62) was quantified. Inhibition of autophagy leads to an increase in SQSTM1 protein levels, whereas autolysosomes degrade SQSTM1- and LC3-positive bodies during autophagic flux (41Bjørkoy G. Lamark T. Brech A. Outzen H. Perander M. Overvatn A. Stenmark H. Johansen T. p62/SQSTM1 forms protein aggregates degraded by autophagy and has a protective effect on huntingtin-induced cell death.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171 (16286508): 603-61410.1083/jcb.200507002Crossref PubMed Scopus (2505) Google Scholar). In these experiments, dactolisib treatment led to a dose-dependent decrease in SQSTM1 protein levels corresponding to the induction of autophagic flux (Fig. 1A). Of interest, dactolisib treatment led to the dose-dependent increase in the expression of beclin 1 (BECN1) (Fig. 1A). Unlike other BH3-only proteins, the overexpression of BECN1 does not function as a pro-apoptotic molecule, but instead it leads to increased autophagy (42Lin F. Ghislat G. Luo S. Renna M. Siddiqi F. Rubinsztein D.C. XIAP and cIAP1 amplifications induce Beclin 1-dependent autophagy through NFκB activation.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2015; 24 (25669656): 2899-291310.1093/hmg/ddv052Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As both a decrease in SQSTM1 and an increase in BECN1 levels correlate with enhanced autophagy, the observed decrease in the SQSTM1/BECN1 protein ratio in dactolisib-treated cells suggests augmented autophagy induction (Fig. 1A) (40Klionsky D.J. Abdelmohsen K. Abe A. Abedin M.J. Abeliovich H. Acevedo Arozena A. Adachi H. Adams C.M. Adams P.D. Adeli K. Adhihetty P.J. Adler S.G. Agam G. Agarwal R.

To further establish the induction of autophagic flux in dactolisib-treated macrophages, and not simply the activation of LC3B transcription, additional experiments were conducted with macrophages in the presence of the established acid protease inhibitor, pepstatin A. Pepstatin A prevents the degradation of LC3B-II during autophagosome–lysosome fusion, resulting in an accumulation of LC3B-II over time as autophagy is initiated and sustained. Macrophages were treated with 10 μg/ml pepstatin A prior to dactolisib treatment and lysed after a subsequent 24-h dactolisib treatment. Blots of cell lysates confirmed autophagic flux, with significant LC3B-II accumulation relative to basal conditions in the vehicle control (Fig. 1B). These data indicate that in the presence of dactolisib treatment autophagy goes to completion. Although we observed an increase in autophagic markers in the"
https://openalex.org/W2792309719,"Evidence is provided that the fibroproliferative actions of TGF-β are dependent on a metabolic adaptation that sustains pathologic growth. Specifically, profibrotic TGF-β signaling is shown to require fatty acid synthase (FASN), an essential anabolic enzyme responsible for the de novo synthesis of fatty acids. With the use of pharmacologic and genetic approaches, we show that TGF-β-stimulated FASN expression is independent of Smad2/ 3 and is mediated via mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1. In the absence of FASN activity or protein, TGF-β -driven fibrogenic processes are reduced with no apparent toxicity.

Remarkably, inhibition of FASN not only decreased expression of profibrotic targets, but lung function was also stabilized/improved, as assessed by peripheral blood oxygenation.—Jung, M.-Y., Kang, J.-H., Hernandez, D.

https://openalex.org/W2792610442,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an immune-mediated disease with the characteristics of progressive joint destruction, deformity, and disability. Epigenetic changes have been implicated in the development of some autoimmune disorders, resulting in an alteration of gene transcription. Here, we investigated how Jumonji C family of histone demethylases (JMJD3) regulated the proliferation and activation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs), which are involved in RA joint destruction and pathologic process. The JMJD3 expression and proliferation markers in RA-FLS were higher than those in healthy-FLS and were upregulated in platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced FLS. Elevated JMJD3 promoted the proliferation and migration of FLS. Treatment with JMJD3 small interfering RNA or inhibitor glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) J4 led to decreased proliferation and migration of FLS. Interestingly, induction of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a major player of the cell-cycle regulation, was correlated with trimethylated lysine 27 in histone H3 loss around the gene promoters. The knockdown of JMJD3 abolished PCNA expression in PDGF-induced FLS and further inhibited cell proliferation and migration, suggesting that JMJD3/PCNA played a crucial role in aspects of FLS proliferation and migration. In vivo, the ability of GSK J4 to hinder collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in DBA/1 mice was evaluated. We found that GSK J4 markedly attenuated the severity of arthritis in CIA mice. The therapeutic effects were associated with ameliorated joint swelling and reduced bone erosion and destruction. This study revealed how JMJD3 integrated with epigenetic processes to regulate RA-FLS proliferation and invasion. These data suggested that JMJD3 might contribute to rheumatoid synovial hyperplasia and have the potential as a novel therapeutic target for RA.-Jia, W., Wu, W., Yang, D., Xiao, C., Su, Z., Huang, Z., Li, Z., Qin, M., Huang, M., Liu, S., Long, F., Mao, J., Liu, X., Zhu, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2793802556,"The pathogen Vibrio cholerae is the causative agent of cholera. Emergence of antibiotic-resistant V. cholerae strains is increasing, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Herein, we report that the stringent response regulator and stress alarmone guanosine tetra- and pentaphosphate ((p)ppGpp) significantly contributes to antibiotic tolerance in V. cholerae We found that N16961, a pandemic V. cholerae strain, and its isogenic (p)ppGpp-overexpressing mutant ΔrelAΔspoT are both more antibiotic-resistant than (p)ppGpp0 (ΔrelAΔrelVΔspoT) and ΔdksA mutants, which cannot produce or utilize (p)ppGpp, respectively. We also found that additional disruption of the aconitase B-encoding and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle gene acnB in the (p)ppGpp0 mutant increases its antibiotic tolerance. Moreover, expression of TCA cycle genes, including acnB, was increased in (p)ppGpp0, but not in the antibiotic-resistant ΔrelAΔspoT mutant, suggesting that (p)ppGpp suppresses TCA cycle activity, thereby entailing antibiotic resistance. Importantly, when grown anaerobically or incubated with an iron chelator, the (p)ppGpp0 mutant became antibiotic-tolerant, suggesting that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in antibiotic-mediated bacterial killing. Consistent with that hypothesis, tetracycline treatment markedly increased ROS production in the antibiotic-susceptible mutants. Interestingly, expression of the Fe(III) ABC transporter substrate-binding protein FbpA was increased 10-fold in (p)ppGpp0, and fbpA gene deletion restored viability of tetracycline-exposed (p)ppGpp0 cells. Of note, FbpA expression was repressed in the (p)ppGpp-accumulating mutant, resulting in a reduction of intracellular free iron, required for the ROS-generating Fenton reaction. Our results indicate that (p)ppGpp-mediated suppression of central metabolism and iron uptake reduces antibiotic-induced oxidative stress in V. cholerae."

Mtb is an unusual bacterial pathogen, with the remarkable ability to cause both acute life threatening disease and also clinically latent infections that can persist for the lifetime of the human host.

The ANA node consists of several bidirectional reactions, modeling is not able to predict which genes and reactions are required nor their directionality (8Kappelmann J. Wiechert W. Noack S. Cutting the Gordian knot: identifiability of anaplerotic reactions in Corynebacterium glutamicum by means of 13C-metabolic flux analysis.Biotech. Bioeng. 2016; 113: 661-67410.1002/bit.25833Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The ANA node lies at the heart of the central metabolism inter-connecting the main pathways of the central metabolism (glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and the TCA cycle) controlling the distribution of flux between anabolism, catabolism, and energy supply to the cell (9Sauer U. Eikmanns B.J. The PEP–pyruvate–oxaloacetate node as the switch point for carbon flux distribution in bacteria.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 29: 765-79410.1016/j.femsre.2004.11.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). At this node the end products of glycolysis, PEP and pyruvate, either: 1) serve directly as precursors for anabolism or 2) enter the TCA cycle via acetyl Co-A or anaplerotic reactions and this node is also the starting point for gluconeogenesis. The ANA node of Mtb consists of the enzymes pyruvate carboxylase (PCA), PEP carboxykinase (PCK), malic enzyme (MEZ), and pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK) (Fig. 1). Of these enzymes, only PCK has been shown to have an essential role in gluconeogenesis when Mtb is growing on lipid substrates in vitro and for survival in macrophage and murine models of TB (4Marrero J.

The role of the other members of the ANA node in TB pathogenesis remains unexplored. In this study we use a combination of genetics and biochemistry to test the redundancy within the ANA node to establish whether targeting its deregulation could inhibit intracellular nutrient acquisition and therefore intracellular growth. We show that in addition to being a gateway into both gluconeogenesis and anaplerosis, the ANA node has unexpected roles in cholesterol and propionate detoxification and lipid synthesis. Despite apparent functional overlap, we show that each enzyme of the ANA node fulfils a distinct metabolic function during the intracellular growth of Mtb and is thereby a potentially fruitful target for drug development.

Nevertheless, the essential role of PCK during gluconeogenesis and intracellular survival (4Marrero J. Rhee K.Y. Schnappinger D. Pethe K. Ehrt S. Gluconeogenic carbon flow of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates is critical for Mycobacterium tuberculosis to establish and maintain infection.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

To define the role of each enzyme in the ANA node we generated single mutant H37Rv strains Δpca, Δpck, Δppdk, Δmez and also a double mutant strain Δpca–Δpck. The growth rates of these mutants were similar to that of the WT strain when cultured in standard Middlebrook 7H9 with glycerol and Tween 80 demonstrating that these enzymes are not required for bacterial growth in rich media (Fig. S1). To test whether the ANA node is important for Mtb during intracellular growth we infected THP-1 macrophages with WT, Δpca, Δpck, Δppdk, Δmez, and Δpca–Δpck (Fig. 2A) and their respective complemented strains (Fig. 2B) of Mtb and monitored intracellular invasion and survival. Deletion of pca had no observable effect on intracellular bacterial growth (Fig. 2A). However, surprisingly deletion of both pca and pck resulted in severe impairment of intracellular survival and loss of the strain from the macrophage (Fig. 2, A and B). As described previously for the Erdman strain of Mtb (4Marrero J. Rhee K.Y. Schnappinger D. Pethe K. Ehrt S. Gluconeogenic carbon flow of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates is critical for Mycobacterium tuberculosis to establish and maintain infection.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

These results demonstrated that PCA is essential for intracellular growth in the absence of PCK. Δppdk had a similar intracellular growth defect to Mtb strains lacking PCK (Fig. 2A) indicating that this enzyme is also performing an essential role during infection. Although intracellular Δmez replicated as the parental strain this mutant was less efficient at entering macrophages indicating an invasion phenotype (Fig. 2, C and D). To understand the intracellular phenotypes we next investigated the ability of our ANA enzyme mutants to grow on physiologically relevant carbon sources. PCA was required for growth on pyruvate and substrates that enter metabolism as pyruvate (alanine, serine, and lactate) (Table S1). This phenotype could be complemented by reintroducing the gene into the genome under control of the constitutive hsp60 promoter into the attB site; but could also be complemented by addition of aspartate (as proxy for oxaloacetate, which is labile (14Petersen S. Mack C. De Graaf A.A. Riedel C. Eikmanns B.J. Sahm H. Metabolic consequences of altered phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity in Corynebacterium glutamicum reveal anaplerotic regulation mechanisms in vivo.Metab.

These results demonstrated that PCA is performing an anaplerotic function replenishing oxaloacetate (hence aspartate rescues the mutant) into the TCA cycle when growing on these substrates; but that this role can be complemented when sufficient CO2 is present presumably by the actions of either MEZ or PCK. It has already been shown by us and others that Mtb PCK can operate in the carboxylating (anaplerotic) direction (15Beste D.J. Bonde B. Hawkins N. Ward J.L. Beale M.H. Noack S. Nöh K. Kruger N.J.

PCK was required for the growth of Mtb H37Rv on all gluconeogenic substrates tested (Tables S1 and S2) including those identified as potential intracellular carbon sources by us and others (acetate, glutamate, asparagine, cholesterol, alanine, and combinations of these substrates and their by-products) (17Pandey A.K.

This is in accordance with data for Mtb Erdman, which showed that the gluconeogenic flux of acetate was blocked in the absence of PCK (4Marrero J. Rhee K.Y. Schnappinger D. Pethe K. Ehrt S. Gluconeogenic carbon flow of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates is critical for Mycobacterium tuberculosis to establish and maintain infection.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The double Δpca–Δpck mutant grew identically to the Δpck mutant on the media tested, except that this strain was additionally unable to grow on glycerol unless supplemented with 5% CO2 (Table S1) suggesting that, in vitro, MEZ is able to complement the anaplerotic function of PCA if provided with sufficient amounts of CO2. To directly test the hypothesis that PCA is performing an anaplerotic function during intracellular growth and that MEZ functions anaplerotically in the absence of both PCA and PCK we infected unlabeled THP-1 macrophages with WT H37Rv, Δpca, and Δpca–Δpck in RPMI medium containing sodium [13C]bicarbonate/RPMI and compared the labeling profile of amino acids after 48 h. We previously performed this experiment with Δpck and showed that this enzyme was contributing to the intracellular fixation of CO2 (7Beste Dany J.V. Nöh K. Niedenführ S. Mendum Tom A.

In the absence of PCA, 13C incorporation into proteogenic amino acids was significantly reduced as compared with the WT strain demonstrating that this enzyme was also contributing to the fixation of carbon from CO2 during intracellular growth (Fig. 3, Table S3). The results are consistent with the in vitro evidence that PCA functions primarily as an anaplerotic enzyme. In the double knockout of PCA and PCK 13C labeling of amino acids was further reduced as compared with Δpca but there were still small amounts of 13C labeling in aspartate and methionine demonstrating that there is an additional enzyme fixing carbon into OAA, presumably MEZ (Fig. 3, Table S3). However, this diminished CO2 fixation correlated with reduced intracellular survival highlighting the importance of anaplerosis through the ANA node for infection. Although Δmez was dispensable for the growth of Mtb H37Rv on all gluconeogenic substrates and glycolytic substrates tested (Tables S1 and S2), the mutant displayed a glossy and viscous morphology on solid media, which combined with the impaired invasion phenotype suggested that this strain may have an altered cell wall lipid profile. To test whether the altered in vitro growth morphology phenotype was due to alterations in the cell envelope lipid composition, we biochemically analyzed the lipid content of WT, Δmez, and the complemented strain Δmez: mez. We extracted apolar and polar lipids from the strains and analyzed the extracts by 2D thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The strains were initially treated with petroleum ether to extract outer, non-covalently bound lipids, prior to extraction of inner apolar lipids and polar lipids. The mez mutant showed an accumulation of a major species in solvent System C (18Dobson G.M. Minnikin D.E. Minnikin S.M. Partlett J.H. Goodfellow M. Ridell M.M. Systematic analysis of complex mycobacterial lipids. Academic Press, London1985Google Scholar) that co-migrated in the same region where free fatty acids (FA) and free mycolic acids (MA) are detected (Fig. 4A, Fig. S2). Subsequently we extracted mycolic acid methyl esters (MAMEs) from apolar lipids (containing trehalose mono- and dimycolates, TMM and TDM, and free FA) and confirmed that Δmez was accumulating free MA with an accompanying decrease in the levels of cell wall-bound mycolates from delipidated cells (Fig. 4B). This data were further supported by GC-MS analysis, which detected higher levels of C26 species in the Δmez strain (Fig. S3). Lipid profiles were restored to those of the parental strain on complementation (Fig. 4, Figs. S2 and S3). Malic enzymes catalyze the reversible oxidative decarboxylation of malate to produce CO2 and pyruvate with the concomitant reduction of NAD(P)+ to NAD(P)H. These enzymes vary in their reversibility and cofactor preference and their role in metabolism is often not clearly established. To validate Mtb MEZ functional properties we determined the catalytic properties of the purified enzyme (Table 1).Table 1Kinetic constants for Mtb MEZSubstrate (concentration range; pH)Km/K0.5VmaxVmax/Kmmmmmol min−1 μmol−1min−1μmol−1Gluconeogenic reaction (l-malate decarboxylation)l-Malate (0.25–100 mm; pH 7.4) with NAD+18.86 ± 0.52aKinetics for these reactions are sigmoidal and the reported values are K0.5 values.127.3 ± 1.756.75l-Malate (0.25–100 mm; pH 7.4) with NADP+40.38 ± 0.51aKinetics for these reactions are sigmoidal and the reported values are K0.5 values.43.92 ± 0.391.09Anaplerotic reaction (pyruvate carboxylation)Pyruvate (20–100 mm; pH 7.4) with NADH as cofactor91.98 ± 6.735.17 ± 0.220.06a Kinetics for these reactions are sigmoidal and the reported values are K0.5 values. Open table in a new tab The enzyme was able to decarboxylate malate (forward, gluconeogenic, reaction) using either NAD+ or NADP+ with a preference for NAD+ demonstrating that this enzyme can provide both NADH and NADPH for lipid biosynthesis. The enzyme showed a sigmoidicity at low malate concentrations indicating homotropic allosteric regulation. The reverse reductive pyruvate carboxylation reaction showed typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics confirming that Mtb MEZ can serve as a backup anaplerotic enzyme for Mtb. However, the substrate affinities and maximum reaction rates show that the forward reaction is preferred. The combined actions of MEZ and PPDK should be able to provide Mtb with an alternative gluconeogenic route that circumvents the requirement for PCK (Fig. 1). Strikingly, Δppdk was able to grow on all gluconeogenic and glycolytic substrates tested with the exception of medium containing cholesterol as a sole carbon source or a combination of cholesterol and acetate, even though the mutant could grow in acetate as a sole carbon source (Tables S1 and S2). Moreover, addition of cholesterol to minimal media containing pyruvate, glycerol, or glutamate similarly inhibited the growth of Δppdk (Table S2). This phenotype has been observed in other mutant Mtb strains that are unable to metabolize cholesterol and has been linked to the accumulation of toxic propionyl-CoA produced from cholesterol catabolism (19Lee W.

Propionate did indeed inhibit the growth of Δppdk in standard 7H9 medium (containing glycerol and Tween 80) as compared with the WT or the complemented strain Δppdk:ppdk (Fig. 5A) demonstrating that PPDK plays a role in detoxifying propionyl-CoA. In contrast Δpck was not intoxicated by either cholesterol or propionyl-CoA (Table S2, Fig. 5A). In fact deletion of pck enhanced the growth of Mtb in the presence of propionate as compared with the WT strain (Fig. 5A). Mtb has two pathways for metabolizing propionyl-CoA, via the methyl citrate cycle to yield pyruvate and succinate or in the presence of sufficient vitamin B12 the methyl malonyl pathway to yield succinyl-CoA. Activation of the methyl malonyl pathway with vitamin B12 restored growth of Δppdk in propionate (Fig. 5B) suggesting that PPDK provides a link between the methyl citrate cycle-derived pyruvate and the rest of metabolism. To further explore the intracellular metabolic profile of this mutant we performed 13C isotopologue experiments with prelabeled THP-1 macrophages. THP-1 macrophages were passaged in [13C]glucose/RPMI as previously described (7Beste Dany J.V. Nöh K. Niedenführ S. Mendum Tom A. Hawkins Nathaniel D. Ward Jane L. Beale Michael H. Wiechert W.

We selected this time point as the Δppdk mutant showed no detectable growth phenotype at this time so fluxes could be compared with WT (Fig. 2). Also, the labeling profile of amino acids is at an isotopic steady state by 48 h (7Beste Dany J.V. Nöh K. Niedenführ S. Mendum Tom A. Hawkins Nathaniel D. Ward Jane L. Beale Michael H. Wiechert W.

We focused the analysis on amino acids with 13C profiles, which were significantly different from the WT to identify major defects in metabolism consequent to enzyme deletion (Table S4, Fig. 6). In the absence of PPDK there was a block in gluconeogenic flow (Table S4, Fig. 6). 13C enrichment occurred only in amino acids derived from metabolites occurring below pyruvate but not in those amino acids derived from glycolytic intermediates (Fig. 6, Table S4). These data show that during intracellular growth PPDK provides an alternative to PCK as a gateway into gluconeogenesis and that both of these routes are required for the intracellular survival of Mtb. A number of studies highlight the importance of individual enzymes of glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and the TCA cycle to the virulence strategy of Mtb. These pathways are interconnected by four enzymes at a metabolic cross-roads known as the ANA node (9Sauer U. Eikmanns B.J. The PEP–pyruvate–oxaloacetate node as the switch point for carbon flux distribution in bacteria.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 29: 765-79410.1016/j.femsre.2004.11.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that although there is some functional overlap, each of these enzymes fulfils a unique metabolic function during intracellular growth. In addition to its canonical role in gluconeogenesis and anaplerosis we reveal that the ANA node has unexpected roles in lipid biosynthesis and detoxifying cholesterol and propionate. We previously demonstrated that Mtb is able to fix carbon from CO2 both in vitro (15Beste D.J. Bonde B. Hawkins N. Ward J.L. Beale M.H. Noack S. Nöh K. Kruger N.J. Ratcliffe R.G.

We show here that Mtb has three potential routes for the replenishment of C4 intermediates catalyzed by PCK, PCA, or MEZ and that disruption of two of these routes severely compromises the intracellular survival of Mtb demonstrating that CO2 fixation plays a fundamental role in Mtb's survival in its human host cell. At ambient CO2 levels in vitro PCA was the dominant anaplerotic enzyme required for growth on pyruvate but at higher CO2 levels this enzyme was redundant.

Thus, the modulation of BAs represents a potential therapy for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is characterized by hepatic accumulation of fat and is a major cause of liver disease worldwide. Cyp8b1 is a critical modulator of the hydrophobicity index of the BA pool. As a therapeutic proof of concept, we aimed to determine the impact of Cyp8b1 inhibition in vivo on BA pool composition and as protection against NAFLD. Inhibition of Cyp8b1 expression in mice led to a remodeling of the BA pool, which altered its signaling properties and decreased intestinal fat absorption. In a model of cholesterol-induced NAFLD, Cyp8b1 knockdown significantly decreased steatosis and hepatic lipid content, which has been associated with an increase in fecal lipid and BA excretion. Moreover, inhibition of Cyp8b1 not only decreased hepatic lipid accumulation, but also resulted in the clearance of previously accumulated hepatic cholesterol, which led to a regression in hepatic steatosis. Taken together, our data demonstrate that Cyp8b1 inhibition is a viable therapeutic target of crucial interest for metabolic diseases, such as NAFLD.—Chevre, R., Trigueros-Motos, L., Castaño, D., Chua, T., Corliano, M., Patankar, J.

Although ccRCC is characterized by common recurrent genetic abnormalities, including inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (vhl) tumor suppressor gene resulting in stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), the tumor aggressiveness and outcome of ccRCC is variable. New biomarkers are thus required to improve ccRCC diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic options. This work aims to investigate the expression of HIF and proteins involved in metabolism and pH regulation. Their correlation to histoprognostic parameters and survival was analyzed.ccRCC of 45 patients were analyzed. HIF-1α, HIF-2α, HAF, GLUT1, MCT1, MCT4, CAIX and CAXII expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry in a semi-quantitative and qualitative manner. The GLUT1, MCT1, MCT4, CAIX and CAXII mRNA levels were analyzed in an independent cohort of 43 patients.A significant correlation was observed between increased GLUT1, MCT1, CAXII protein expression and a high Fuhrman grade in ccRCC patients. Moreover, while HIF-1α, HIF-2α and HAF expression was heterogenous within tumors, we observed and confirmed that HIF-2α co-localized with HAF. We confirmed, in an independent cohort, that GLUT1, MCT1 and CAXII mRNA levels correlated with the Fuhrman grade. Moreover, we demonstrated that the high mRNA level of both MCT1 and GLUT1 correlated with poor prognosis.This study demonstrates for the first time a link between the aggressiveness of high- Fuhrman grade ccRCC and metabolic reprogramming. It also confirms the role of HIF-2α and HAF in tumor invasiveness. Finally, these results demonstrate that MCT1 and GLUT1 are strong prognostic markers and promising therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2792075245,"UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase (UGDH) produces UDP-α-D-glucuronic acid, the precursors for glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and proteoglycans of the extracellular matrix. Elevated GAG formation has been implicated in a variety of human diseases, including glioblastoma (GBM). In our previous study, we found that Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) promotes GBM cell migration by binding to methylated DNA, mainly methylated CpGs (mCpG) and transactivating gene expression. We identified UDGH as one of the downstream targets of KLF4-mCpG binding activity. In this study, we show that KLF4 upregulates UGDH expression in a mCpG-dependent manner, and UGDH is required for KLF4-induced cell migration in vitro. UGDH knockdown decreases GAG abundance in GBM cells, as well as cell proliferation and migration in vitro. In intracranial xenografts, reduced UGDH inhibits tumor growth and migration, accompanied by a decrease in the expression of extracellular matrix proteins such as tenascin C, brevican. Our studies demonstrate a novel DNA methylation-dependent UGDH upregulation by KLF4. Developing UGDH antagonists to decrease the synthesis of extracellular matrix components will be a useful strategy for GBM therapy."

Most biopharmaceutical proteins are produced in mammalian cells because this ensures correct folding and glycosylation for protein stability and function. However, protein production in mammalian cells has several drawbacks, including heterogeneity of glycans attached to the produced protein. In this study, we established cell lines with high-mannose–type N-linked, low-complexity glycans. We first knocked out two genes encoding Golgi mannosidases (MAN1A1 and MAN1A2) in HEK293 cells. Single knockout (KO) cells did not exhibit changes in N-glycan structures, whereas double KO cells displayed increased high-mannose–type and decreased complex-type glycans. In our effort to eliminate the remaining complex-type glycans, we found that knocking out a gene encoding the endoplasmic reticulum mannosidase I (MAN1B1) in the double KO cells reduced most of the complex-type glycans. In triple KO (MAN1A1, MAN1A2, and MAN1B1) cells, Man9GlcNAc2 and Man8GlcNAc2 were the major N-glycan structures. Therefore, we expressed two lysosomal enzymes, α-galactosidase-A and lysosomal acid lipase, in the triple KO cells and found that the glycans on these enzymes were sensitive to endoglycosidase H treatment.

Biopharmaceuticals are drugs produced from organisms by biotechnology. Protein-based pharmaceuticals such as monoclonal antibodies have high specificity and high affinity against target molecules and few side effects compared with traditional small molecules. Recombinant therapeutic proteins are becoming very important pharmaceutical agents for treating intractable diseases, such as cancer and autoimmune diseases (1Lagassé H.A. Alexaki A. Simhadri V.L.

Because most secreted recombinant proteins are modified with glycans, these proteins require proper glycosylation for stability and function and for avoiding immunogenicity (4Higel F. Seidl A.

Production of biopharmaceuticals in mammalian cells still has several drawbacks, including high cost and glycan heterogeneity. Heterogeneity of glycans attached to proteins is an important issue that needs to be solved to ensure protein quality and stability for use as pharmaceuticals. Some cytokines, including erythropoietin and granulocyte colony–stimulating factors, require sialylated complex-type glycans for their in vivo activity (7Delorme E. Lorenzini T. Giffin J. Martin F. Jacobsen F. Boone T. Elliott S. Role of glycosylation on the secretion and biological activity of erythropoietin.Biochemistry. 1992; 31 (1390770): 9871-987610.1021/bi00156a003Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 8Haas R.

Ther. 1995; 1 (9384679): 249-270PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, changing glycan structures on proteins can enhance their functional activity; for example, the absence of a core fucose on N-linked glycans of an antibody drastically enhances the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (9Yamane-Ohnuki N. Satoh M. Production of therapeutic antibodies with controlled fucosylation.MAbs. 2009; 1 (20065644): 230-23610.4161/mabs.1.3.8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Therefore, construction of mammalian cell lines that produce homogeneous glycoproteins is needed in the field of biopharmaceuticals.

Lysosomes contain many hydrolytic enzymes, such as nucleases, proteases, lipases, and glycosidases (10Xu H. Ren D. Lysosomal physiology.Annu. Rev.

LSDs are inherited disorders caused by deficiency of specific lysosomal enzymes that metabolize substrates in lysosomes. Approximately 50 different kinds of LSDs are known (11Filocamo M. Morrone A. Lysosomal storage disorders: molecular basis and laboratory testing.Hum. Genomics. 2011; 5 (21504867): 156-16910.1186/1479-7364-5-3-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 12Parenti G.

Enzyme replacement therapy, which is normally performed by giving the patient an intravenous injection of recombinant lysosomal enzymes, is available for treatment of some LSDs. The N-glycans on lysosomal enzymes play critical roles in their delivery to the lysosome. The enzymes are incorporated into the cells through cation-independent M6P receptors or other receptors, such as Man receptors on the cell surface (12Parenti G. Andria G. Ballabio A.

Alternatively, inhibitors against α1,2-mannosidases, such as kifunensine and deoxymannojirimycin, can be used for the production of recombinant proteins having high-Man–type N-glycans with Man9GlcNAc2 structures (18Elbein A.D. Tropea J.E. Mitchell M. Kaushal G.P. Kifunensine, a potent inhibitor of the glycoprotein processing mannosidase I.J. Biol.

Kifunensine is used for the production of velaglucerase alfa (VPRIV, Shire), which treats type 1 Gaucher disease (19Burrow T.A. Grabowski G.A.

Use of such deglycosylation enzymes or inhibitors is effective in the production of high-Man–type glycans; however, maintaining the quality and stability of the proteins is challenging. In CHO cells and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, mutant cells defective in the MGAT1 gene encoding GlcNAc transferase I (GnT-I) have been established and are frequently used for protein production with high-Man–type glycans (20Chen W. Stanley P. Five Lec1 CHO cell mutants have distinct Mgat1 gene mutations that encode truncated N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I.Glycobiology. 2003; 13 (12634323): 43-5010.1093/glycob/cwg003Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 21Reeves P.J.

The Man5GlcNAc2 structure is the major form of the glycan structure in GnT-I mutant cells. However, for the production of M6P-containing, high-Man–type glycans, Man9GlcNAc2 and Man8GlcNAc2 structures are more suitable than Man5GlcNAc2 because of the specificity of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase (22Couso R.

In this study, we genetically engineered a glycosylation pathway and established cells that produce high-Man–type N-glycans with Man9GlcNAc2 and Man8GlcNAc2 structures. Two genes encoding the Golgi-localized α-mannosidase I were disrupted in HEK293 cells. In the double knockout (D-KO), a decrease in the complex-type N-glycans was observed; however, the level of high-Man types increased. We further knocked out a gene encoding the ER α-mannosidase I in D-KO cells, and these triple KO (T-KO) cells further decreased complex-type N-glycans and simplified glycan structures. The N-glycans on the recombinant lysosomal enzymes produced in T-KO cells were high-Man types. This is the first report that mammalian cells can produce simple Man9GlcNAc2 and Man8GlcNAc2 structures of high-Man–type glycans without any treatment. The cells should be suitable for therapeutic proteins with high-Man–type N-glycans. When glycoproteins are expressed in mammalian cells, heterogeneous glycan structures, which are generated in the glycosylation pathway at the ER and the Golgi, are found on the proteins (Fig. 1A). Such heterogeneity of glycans is an important issue in the production of therapeutic glycoproteins (23Meuris L. Santens F. Elson G. Festjens N. Boone M. Dos Santos A. Devos S. Rousseau F. Plets E.

These advantages are valuable when establishing cell lines that produce recombinant proteins with simplified glycan structures. To establish cells producing Man9 and Man8 containing high-Man–type glycans, we initially focused on Golgi-localized α-mannosidase I (Fig. 1A). Most N-glycosylated proteins that are transported from the ER to the Golgi apparatus have Man9GlcNAc2 or Man8GlcNAc2 structures (Fig. 1B). At the Golgi apparatus, α1,2-linked Mans are trimmed by Golgi mannosidase I to yield the Man5GlcNAc2 structure (29Lal A. Pang P. Kalelkar S. Romero P.A. Herscovics A. Moremen K.W.

We first tried to knock out MAN1A1 and MAN1A2 genes in HEK293 cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 system (35Cong L. Ran F.A. Cox D. Lin S. Barretto R. Habib N. Hsu P.D. Wu X. Jiang W. Marraffini L.A.

For each gene KO, two target sequences were selected on the same exon of the genes to remove the DNA fragment from coding sequence of the gene. After KO constructs were transfected, clonal cells were isolated, and the DNA sequences around the KO target sequences were analyzed. We selected a clonal cell line where the DNA fragment between two target sequences was completely removed in all homologous chromosomes (Fig. 2, A and B). Clones A1-KO24 and A2-KO37 were selected, respectively, for the MAN1A1-KO and MAN1A2-KO cells. A1-KO24 contained a 62-bp deletion between two target sequences in the MAN1A1 gene (Fig. 2C). The cleavage of the target sequences was correctly carried out 3 bp upstream of the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequences by Cas9, and the cleaved region was connected with non-homologous end joining. The deletion of 62 bp in MAN1A1 gave rise to a frame-shifted coding sequence. A2-KO37 contained a 32-bp deletion between two target sequences, and this deletion also gave a frameshift (Fig. 2C). These results show that the MAN1A1 and MAN1A2 genes are knocked out. The glycan profiles on the cell surface in KO cells were analyzed by lectin staining.

In A1-KO and A2-KO cells, the staining patterns of both PHA-L4 and ConA were similar to those observed in parental HEK293 wildtype cells (Fig. 3A), suggesting that MAN1A1 and MAN1A2 have overlapping functions.Figure 3Increased ConA staining and decreased PHA-L4 staining in MAN1A1 and A2 double KO cells.

The MAN1A2 gene was knocked out using the A1-KO24 cell line as the parental strain. After transfection of the KO constructs, the clonal cell line was isolated. The genomic DNA sequences around the KO target regions were analyzed (Fig. 2, A and B). Compared with A2-KO37 cells, the D-KO35 cells showed three bands when the MAN1A2 target region was amplified, and the sequences were examined. The lower band arose from cleavage at two target sites and connected with the exposed ends. The middle band represented a 75-bp insertion from the plasmid sequence at the target 1 cleavage site and a 1-bp insertion at the target 2 cleavage site. The third band also represented 2-bp and 207-bp insertions at the target 1 and 2 cleavage site, respectively. Because both sequences cause frameshifts, the D-KO35 cell line has both MAN1A1 and MAN1A2 genes knocked out. The D-KO35 cells were stained with PHA-L4 and ConA. Compared with wildtype and single KO cells, surface staining of ConA increased, and PHA-L4 staining had significantly decreased in D-KO35 cells (Fig. 3A). The results indicate a change in the glycan profile compared with that of the wildtype cells. Here the level of complex-type N-glycans had decreased and the level of high-Man–type N-glycans had increased in D-KO cells. In D-KO35 cells, a decrease in the level of complex-type glycans was observed, whereas staining of PHA-L4 still remained. Therefore, we postulated that other α1,2-mannosidases are involved in the formation of complex-type N-glycans. MAN1A1 and MAN1A2 belong to glycoside hydrolase family 47 (GH47) in the carbohydrate active enzymes database (CAZy) (39Mast S.W. Moremen K.W. Family 47 α-mannosidases in N-glycan processing.Methods Enzymol. 2006; 415 (17116466): 31-4610.1016/S0076-6879(06)15003-XCrossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In mammals, there are five members (MAN1C1, MAN1B1, EDEM1, EDEM2, and EDEM3) other than MAN1A1 and MAN1A2 in the GH47 family (Fig. 1C) (40Xiang Y. Karaveg K. Moremen K.W.

We focused on the five genes (MAN1C1, MAN1B1, EDEM1, EDEM2, and EDEM3) to analyze the roles of complex glycan formation. D-KO35 cells were transfected with each gene KO target plasmid, and cells that transfected the plasmids expressing Cas9 and target single guide RNA (sgRNA) were sorted. After transfection, cells were cultured for more than 10 days, and the genomic DNAs were then isolated from the bulk population. Because two target sites in each gene were designed, the amplified fragments were shifted when the genes on the chromosomes were knocked out. We confirmed that a fraction of the target genes were knocked out in the bulk population (Fig. 3B). Using these cell populations, the surface glycan profiles were analyzed by PHA-L4 staining (Fig. 3C). The staining profiles for D-KO35 cells with plasmids for knockouts of either MAN1C1 or EDEM1, 2, or 3 showed no change in their staining compared with D-KO35 cells. However, the PHA-L4 staining was observed to have decreased in D-KO35 cells transfected with plasmids expressing sgRNA for MAN1B1 knockout compared with the parental cells, suggesting that this gene is actually involved in Man trimming to form complex-type N-glycan structures, at least in D-KO cells. We also knocked out the five genes in wildtype cells. Com"
https://openalex.org/W2790675119,"Programmed cell death or apoptosis is a critical mechanism for the controlled removal of damaged or infected cells, and proteins of the Bcl-2 family are important arbiters of this process. Viruses have been shown to encode functional and structural homologs of Bcl-2 to counter premature host-cell apoptosis and ensure viral proliferation or survival. Grouper iridovirus (GIV) is a large DNA virus belonging to the Iridoviridae family and harbors GIV66, a putative Bcl-2-like protein and mitochondrially localized apoptosis inhibitor. However, the molecular and structural basis of GIV66-mediated apoptosis inhibition is currently not understood. To gain insight into GIV66's mechanism of action, we systematically evaluated its ability to bind peptides spanning the BH3 domain of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members. Our results revealed that GIV66 harbors an unusually high level of specificity for pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 and displays affinity only for Bcl-2-like 11 (Bcl2L11 or Bim). Using crystal structures of both apo-GIV66 and GIV66 bound to the BH3 domain from Bim, we unexpectedly found that GIV66 forms dimers via an interface that results in occluded access to the canonical Bcl-2 ligand-binding groove, which breaks apart upon Bim binding. This observation suggests that GIV66 dimerization may affect GIV66's ability to bind host pro-death Bcl-2 proteins and enables highly targeted virus-directed suppression of host apoptosis signaling. Our findings provide a mechanistic understanding for the potent anti-apoptotic activity of GIV66 by identifying it as the first single-specificity, pro-survival Bcl-2 protein and identifying a pivotal role of Bim in GIV-mediated inhibition of apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2790425870,"Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) firstly mainly affects peripheral vision. Current behavioral studies support the idea that visual defects of patients with POAG extend into parts of the central visual field classified as normal by static automated perimetry analysis. This is particularly true for visual tasks involving processes of a higher level than mere detection. The purpose of this study was to assess visual abilities of POAG patients in central vision. Patients were assigned to two groups following a visual field examination (Humphrey 24–2 SITA-Standard test). Patients with both peripheral and central defects and patients with peripheral but no central defect, as well as age-matched controls, participated in the experiment. All participants had to perform two visual tasks where low-contrast stimuli were presented in the central 6° of the visual field. A categorization task of scene images and human face images assessed high-level visual recognition abilities. In contrast, a detection task using the same stimuli assessed low-level visual function. The difference in performance between detection and categorization revealed the cost of high-level visual processing. Compared to controls, patients with a central visual defect showed a deficit in both detection and categorization of all low-contrast images. This is consistent with the abnormal retinal sensitivity as assessed by perimetry. However, the deficit was greater for categorization than detection. Patients without a central defect showed similar performances to the controls concerning the detection and categorization of faces. However, while the detection of scene images was well-maintained, these patients showed a deficit in their categorization. This suggests that the simple loss of peripheral vision could be detrimental to scene recognition, even when the information is displayed in central vision. This study revealed subtle defects in the central visual field of POAG patients that cannot be predicted by static automated perimetry assessment using Humphrey 24–2 SITA-Standard test."

They allow for potential synergy by simultaneously engaging two separate targets and enable new functions that are not possible to achieve by using a combination of two monospecific antibodies. Antagonistic antibodies dominate drug discovery today, but only a limited number of agonistic antibodies (i.e. those that activate receptor signaling) have been described. For receptors formed by two components, engaging both of these components simultaneously may be required for agonistic signaling. As such, bispecific antibodies may be particularly useful in activating multicomponent receptor complexes. Here, we describe a biparatopic (i.e. targeting two different epitopes on the same target) format that can activate the endocrine fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 21 receptor (FGFR) complex containing β-Klotho and FGFR1c. This format was constructed by grafting two different antigen-specific VH domains onto the VH and VL positions of an IgG, yielding a tetravalent binder with two potential geometries, a close and a distant, between the two paratopes. Our results revealed that the biparatopic molecule provides activities that are not observed with each paratope alone. Our approach could help address the challenges with heterogeneity inherent in other bispecific formats and could provide the means to adjust intramolecular distances of the antibody domains to drive optimal activity in a bispecific format. In conclusion, this format is versatile, is easy to construct and produce, and opens a new avenue for agonistic antibody discovery and development.

Monoclonal antibodies are an important drug class for treating human disease. With advantages of prolonged pharmacokinetic properties, target specificity, well-established discovery technologies, and continued improvements in cost-effective manufacturing, they have become the preferred class of molecules for biologic therapeutic development. While historically antibody drug development programs have focused on antibodies that bind a target through engaging a single epitope site, bispecific (or even multispecific) antibodies have gained significant attention in recent years. Bispecific molecules allow for synergy by engaging two separate targets, or result in superior properties by engaging two epitopes on the same target (1Spiess C. Zhai Q. Carter P.J. Alternative molecular formats and therapeutic applications for bispecific antibodies.Mol.

In addition, bispecific antibodies may enable new functions that are not possible to achieve with monospecific antibodies alone, such as tissue-specific delivery or bringing cytotoxic T cells to tumor sites (1Spiess C. Zhai Q. Carter P.J. Alternative molecular formats and therapeutic applications for bispecific antibodies.Mol.

The strong interest in bispecific molecules has fueled tremendous innovation and over 100 different formats have now been described, including bispecific IgG, numerous fusions to IgG, and the use of various antibody fragments (1Spiess C. Zhai Q. Carter P.J. Alternative molecular formats and therapeutic applications for bispecific antibodies.Mol.

This array of different formats provides flexibility for a fit-for-purpose design based on size, valency, geometry of antigen-binding sites, pharmacokinetics, and additional properties such as effector functions. However, compared with traditional IgGs, which consist of one heavy and one light chain, bispecific antibodies are more complex, and may result in difficulties in expression and complications in manufacturing that could affect the cost of the drug product. Although many of the novel antibody formats were designed to address some of the challenges associated with bispecific antibodies, there is room for further improvements. Since the introduction of monoclonal antibody drugs more than three decades ago, tremendous technological advances have been made to the drug discovery and development process. The properties of monoclonal antibodies are well understood, and the chemistry, manufacturing, and control process is well established and cost-effective. Therefore, our bispecific antibody design rationale was to take advantage of these robust platforms and engineer a bispecific antibody that employs a scaffold similar to that of a traditional monoclonal antibody. Several approaches have been described to generate a bispecific molecule that resembles a traditional monoclonal antibody in architecture. For example, the “knobs-into-holes” modification in the CH3 domain allows for the heterodimerization between two antibody arms that bind two different antigens (3Ridgway J.B. Presta L.G. Carter P. 'Knobs-into-holes' engineering of antibody CH3 domains for heavy chain heterodimerization.Protein Eng. 1996; 9 (8844834): 617-62110.1093/protein/9.7.617Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). A major hurdle with this approach is the potential mispairing of light chains with inappropriate heavy chains leading to reduced yield of the correct product and, subsequently, a more challenging manufacturing process (1Spiess C. Zhai Q. Carter P.J. Alternative molecular formats and therapeutic applications for bispecific antibodies.Mol. Immunol. 2015; 67 (25637431): 95-10610.1016/j.molimm.2015.01.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Alternative approaches, such as common light chains, have been explored to circumvent the mispairing issue (4Merchant A.M. Zhu Z. Yuan J.Q. Goddard A. Adams C.W. Presta L.G. Carter P.

To further eliminate the need for two different heavy chains in an IgG setting, the engineering of a single variable domain heavy chain (VH) 3The abbreviations used are: VHvariable domain heavy chainVLvariable domain light chainVHHvariable domain of camelid heavy chain-onlyHCAbheavy chain-only antibodyCLconstant domain light chainCHconstant domain heavy chainFGFRfibroblast growth factor receptorECDextracellular domainCκconstant domain kappa light chain. and variable domain light chain (VL) pair to bind two different antigens has been reported (5Bostrom J.

This bispecific format is reminiscent of a traditional IgG and is constructed by using the antibody against the first antigen as the base to generate a library of light chain pairings that are then screened for their ability to bind a second antigen. variable domain heavy chain variable domain light chain variable domain of camelid heavy chain-only heavy chain-only antibody constant domain light chain constant domain heavy chain fibroblast growth factor receptor extracellular domain constant domain kappa light chain. Here, we explored a slightly different approach that takes advantage of the unique properties of single-domain antibodies in therapeutic drug development. First discovered in camelids, VHHs are single-domain antibodies made of the variable region of a heavy chain without a cognate light chain (6Hamers-Casterman C. Atarhouch T. Muyldermans S. Robinson G. Hamers C. Songa E.B. Bendahman N. Hamers R. Naturally occurring antibodies devoid of light chains.Nature. 1993; 363 (8502296): 446-44810.1038/363446a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (2168) Google Scholar). In addition to their small size, single-domain antibody fragments offer numerous advantages such as ease of genetic manipulation and production, amenability to the engineering of multivalent formats, increased functional size of immune libraries, and high solubility and physicochemical stability. We used a transgenic antibody discovery platform, the Harbour heavy chain-only antibody (HCAb) mouse, to generate fully human, antigen-specific VH domains that are functionally analogous to VHH domains (7Janssens R. Dekker S. Hendriks R.W. Panayotou G. van Remoortere A. San J.K. Grosveld F. Drabek D. Generation of heavy-chain-only antibodies in mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Our bispecific format grafts two different human VH domains that bind two distinct targets onto the CH1 and CL domains of the heavy and light chains, respectively, generating a bispecific molecule that requires neither knobs-into-holes nor sequential screening of a compatible light-chain binder to yield bispecificity. We thus took advantage of the flexibility of the VH domains to explore various formats and geometries to optimize agonism of the β-Klotho/FGFR1c receptor complex to mimic the actions of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 21.

The other is a bispecific antibody consisting of one arm binding to β-Klotho and the other to FGFR1c, assembled together using the knobs-into-holes approach (16Kolumam G. Chen M.Z. Tong R.

Although these antibodies demonstrated the technical feasibility of activating β-Klotho/FGFR1c with antibody molecules, given the large distance between the two arms of both formats compared with the native ligand, it is likely that the receptor activation mechanism is different from the endogenous ligand. For antagonistic antibodies, which represent the vast majority of the bispecific molecules in development (1Spiess C. Zhai Q. Carter P.J. Alternative molecular formats and therapeutic applications for bispecific antibodies.Mol.

Given that agonists need to faithfully mimic the activity of the natural ligand, the binding geometry could be crucial (17Grujic O. Stevens J. Chou R.Y. Weiszmann J.V. Sekirov L. Thomson C. Badh A.

Because our biparatopic molecule has a different geometry compared with hetero-Ig–based bispecifics (16Kolumam G. Chen M.Z. Tong R. Zavala-Solorio J. Kates L. van Bruggen N. Ross J. Wyatt S.K. Gandham V.D. Carano R.A. Dunshee D.R. Wu A.L. Haley B. Anderson K.

Herein, we demonstrate that single-domain antibodies can be put together to drive agonistic activity. Further, we demonstrate that our tetravalent, biparatopic format binds two distinct epitopes on β-Klotho, eliminates product heterogeneity due to multiple chains, and can activate the β-Klotho/FGFR1c complex with superior activity than each paratope alone. Thus, this approach offers the potential to address the heterogeneity concerns with other bispecific formats as well as a novel way to adjust intramolecular distances of the antibody domains to drive optimal activity in a bispecific format. VH domains recognizing human β-Klotho were generated from the Harbour mouse as described in “Experimental procedures.” Two of the recovered VHs (VH1 and VH2) were then cloned into expression vectors in two different formats, as VH only (VHO) or as HCAb (Fig. 1A). The affinities of the two VHO binders toward β-Klotho were measured using bio-layer interferometry on an Octet system. The dissociation constants (KD) determined for VHO1 and VHO2 were 0.90 nm and 1.34 nm, respectively, whereas the KD for FGF21 was 3.55 nm (Fig. 1B). In addition, the interaction of the two VHOs with the extracellular domain (ECD) of FGFR1c was also measured. In contrast to results obtained with β-Klotho, no detectable interaction was observed between either VHO and FGFR1c (Fig. 1C). FGF21 showed weak binding to the FGFR1c ECD in the absence of β-Klotho (Fig. 1C), consistent with previous observations (15Foltz I.N. Hu S. King C. Wu X. Yang C. Wang W. Weiszmann J. Stevens J. Chen J.S. Nuanmanee N. Gupte J. Komorowski R. Sekirov L. Hager T. Arora T. et al.Treating diabetes and obesity with an FGF21-mimetic antibody activating the βKlotho/FGFR1c receptor complex.Sci. Transl. Med. 2012; 4 (23197570)162ra15310.1126/scitranslmed.3004690Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). To better understand if the two VHOs bind to distinct regions on β-Klotho, we performed cross-competition studies. β-Klotho ECD was immobilized onto a biosensor and presented to the two VHOs in consecutive association steps (Fig. 1D). When the same VHO was used in both association steps, the second binding phase showed a minimal increase in signal, suggesting a near-complete saturation of binding sites on β-Klotho. In contrast, binding of VHO1 in the first association step failed to block subsequent binding of VHO2. The same result was obtained when the assay was run in reverse (VHO2 first, VHO1 second), indicating that VHO1 and VHO2 bind distinct and nonoverlapping epitopes on β-Klotho. Importantly, using a similar assay, we did not observe competition between either β-Klotho–binding VHO molecule and FGF21 for binding to β-Klotho (Fig. 1E). Neither VHO1, VHO2, or FGF21 associated nonspecifically with the streptavidin sensors, and the VHOs did not interact directly with each other or with FGF21 (data not shown). Together, these results indicate that VHO1, VHO2, and FGF21 bind to distinct regions on β-Klotho. The ability of the β-Klotho–binding VH domains to modulate receptor activity was determined using an FGF21-responsive reporter cell assay in CHO cells that stably express both human β-Klotho and FGFR1c. The co-expression of reporter constructs encoding a 5× Upstream Activation Sequence upstream of luciferase and Gal4 DNA-binding domain fused to Elk1 allows us to follow the ability of FGF21 or other test molecules to stimulate β-Klotho–dependent FGFR downstream signaling as a measure of luciferase activity (19Hecht R. Li Y.S. Sun J. Belouski E. Hall M. Hager T. Yie J. Wang W. Winters D. Smith S. Spahr C. Tam L.T. Shen Z. Stanislaus S. Chinookoswong N. Lau Y. Sickmier A. Michaels M.L. Boone T. Véniant M.M. Xu J.

Although the VHs in the VHO format did not activate receptor signaling (Fig. 2A), VH1 in the HCAb format (HCAb-VH1) showed weak partial agonistic activity (Fig. 2B) (18.9 ± 5.2% versus 6.8 ± 2.6% of FGF21 Rmax for HCAb-VH1 and HCAb-VH2, respectively, p = 0.02). This result demonstrates that bivalency is required for VH1 to activate the receptor complex, consistent with the general belief that dimerization of FGF receptors is required for activation of receptor tyrosine kinase activity (20Goetz R. Mohammadi M. Exploring mechanisms of FGF signalling through the lens of structural biology.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 14 (23403721): 166-18010.1038/nrm3528Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Bivalency also improved the functional binding affinity of VH1 for β-Klotho, as evidenced by a 20-fold reduction in KD over the VHO format (Fig. 2C). However, HCAb-VH2 remained inactive in the reporter assay (Fig. 2B), despite displaying an improvement in binding avidity over the monovalent VHO2 format (Fig. 2C). To understand the impact of geometry on the agonistic activities of the two VHs, two other multivalent formats were also explored. As depicted in Fig. 2D, instead of fusing the VHs onto the Fc fragment as in the case of the HCAb format, we grafted the individual VH domains onto the CH1 and CL domains of the heavy and light chains, respectively. This can be done to produce a bivalent Fab (Fab-VH1+VH1 or Fab-VH2+VH2) (Fig. 2D) or a tetravalent monoparatopic IgG (IgG-VH1+VH1 or IgG-VH2+VH2) (Fig. 2D). These formats result in molecules having both close (the two arms in a Fab) and more distant (the two binding arms in the IgG) geometries between the different binding arms. As shown in Fig. 2E, whereas Fab-VH1+VH1 activated receptor signaling to a level similar to that observed with the HCAb-VH1 molecule, the tetravalent IgG-VH1+VH1 exhibited higher activity (25.7 ± 1.2% versus 18.6 ± 1.6% of FGF21 Rmax for IgG-VH1+VH1 and Fab-VH1+VH1, respectively, p = 0.02). This suggests that the relative geometry and potential synergy between the two binding arms in the IgG format resulted in a more favorable receptor conformation for signaling. Consistent with this, although Fab-VH2+VH2 remained inactive similar to HCAb-VH2, the tetravalent IgG-VH2+VH2 modestly activated receptor signaling (Fig. 2E) (10.4 ± 0.3% of FGF21 Rmax). Of note, IgG-VH1+VH1 exhibited an inverted U-shaped dose-response curve, suggesting inhibition of signaling activity at high concentrations. This likely resulted from the multiple VH1 domains competing with each other for β-Klotho–binding sites when the concentration was high. Compared with HCAbs, the tetravalent IgG format was associated with a further increase in binding affinity and avidity for β-Klotho (Fig. 2F). Although dual epitope targeting of a single protein has been shown to provide superior properties in the case of antagonists (1Spiess C. Zhai Q. Carter P.J. Alternative molecular formats and therapeutic applications for bispecific antibodies.Mol. Immunol. 2015; 67 (25637431): 95-10610.1016/j.molimm.2015.01.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), this has not been explored for agonists. Because VH1 and VH2 bind different epitopes on β-Klotho, we were interested in the effect of combining them on receptor signaling activation. In addition, the design of the biparatopic antibody format allows us to address the role of binding domain geometry with regard to agonism (Fig. 3A). Our biparatopic IgG format generally resembles that of a typical antibody and is an extension of the monoparatopic IgG format shown in Fig. 2D, where the heavy chain consists of a VH1 fusion to the CH1-CH3 domains and the light chain consists of a VH2 fusion to the CL domain of the Cκ light chain. The expression and purification of this biparatopic antibody (named IgG-VH1+VH2) was carried out in a manner similar to a conventional antibody without the concern of potential mispairing between the heavy and light chains as has been observed with other bispecific formats (1Spiess C. Zhai Q. Carter P.J. Alternative molecular formats and therapeutic applications for bispecific antibodies.Mol. Immunol. 2015; 67 (25637431): 95-10610.1016/j.molimm.2015.01.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). In FGF21-responsive CHO reporter cells expressing human β-Klotho and FGFR1c, IgG-VH1+VH2 activated receptor signaling with potency similar to that of FGF21 (EC50 = 0.5 nm) (Fig. 3B). The maximal response achieved was ∼75% of that of FGF21, demonstrating superior efficacy than VH1 and VH2 in either the HCAb, monoparatopic Fab, or IgG format (compare Fig. 3B to Fig. 2, B and E). Characterization of the interaction between IgG-VH1+VH2 and β-Klotho by bio-layer interferometry indicated that IgG-VH1+VH2 directly interacted with β-Klotho with a much higher affinity than that of FGF21 (KD of 2.8 pm versus 3.5 nm, respectively) (Fig. 3C). As neither arm of the biparatopic IgG molecule shares the same epitope with FGF21 on β-Klotho (Fig. 1E), we asked whether IgG-VH1+VH2 and FGF21 can act cooperatively to activate β-Klotho/FGFR1c signaling. To this end, we assessed the effect of different concentrations of IgG-VH1+VH2 on the dose response of FGF21, and vice versa, using FGF21-responsive reporter cells. As shown in Fig. 3D, IgG-VH1+VH2 inhibited FGF21 signal activation in a dose-dependent manner, with the maximal inhibitory response converging with the intrinsic activity observed with IgG-VH1+VH2 alone. These results indicate that IgG-VH1+VH2 antagonized the activity of FGF21. Because VHO1 or 2 alone did not compete with FGF21 for β-Klotho binding (Fig. 1E), we postulated that the receptor complex may be cross-linked together by the tetravalent biparatopic antibody, which makes the FGF21-binding sites on β-Klotho inaccessible, thereby inhibiting FGF21-induced signaling. We next assessed whether IgG-VH1+VH2, being a strong binder to β-Klotho, can activate other FGFRs. To this end, we utilized the rat myoblast L6 cell line, which typically does not respond to FGF treatment because of low or no expression of endogenous FGFRs (15Foltz I.N. Hu S. King C. Wu X. Yang C.

https://openalex.org/W2788691422,"Macrophages are specialized phagocytes that play an essential role in inflammation, immunity, and tissue repair. Profiling the global proteomic response of macrophages to microbial molecules such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide is key to understanding fundamental mechanisms of inflammatory disease. Ethanol is a widely abused substance that has complex effects on inflammation. Reports have indicated that ethanol can activate or inhibit the lipopolysaccharide receptor, Toll-like Receptor 4, in different settings, with important consequences for liver and neurologic inflammation, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. To profile the sequential effect of low dose ethanol and lipopolysaccharide on macrophages, a gel-free proteomic technique was applied to RAW 264.7 macrophages. Five hundred four differentially expressed proteins were identified and quantified with high confidence using ≥ 5 peptide spectral matches. Among these, 319 proteins were shared across all treatment conditions, and 69 proteins were exclusively identified in ethanol-treated or lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cells. The interactive impact of ethanol and lipopolysaccharide on the macrophage proteome was evaluated using bioinformatics tools, enabling identification of differentially responsive proteins, protein interaction networks, disease- and function-based networks, canonical pathways, and upstream regulators. Five candidate protein coding genes (PGM2, ISYNA1, PARP1, and PSAP) were further validated by qRT-PCR that mostly related to glucose metabolism and fatty acid synthesis pathways. Taken together, this study describes for the first time at a systems level the interaction between ethanol and lipopolysaccharide in the proteomic programming of macrophages, and offers new mechanistic insights into the biology that may underlie the impact of ethanol on infectious and inflammatory disease in humans."

However, the exact anti-inflammatory mechanisms remain poorly understood. Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine produced by immune and stromal cells. We postulated that MSCs could produce IL-1Ra and attenuate experimental arthritis. In this study, 5x106 MSCs were injected into the peritoneal cavity of IL-1Ra knockout (IL-1RaKO) mice. MSCs reduced the severity of the arthritis by histology and decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in IL-1RaKO mice. The ratio of splenic T helper 17 (Th17) cells to regulatory T cells (Treg) was significantly decreased in MSC-injected IL-1RaKO mice. Purified splenic CD4+ T cells from mice in each of the treatment groups were cultured under Th17 polarizing conditions and analyzed by flow cytometry. Less expansion of the Th17 population was observed in the MSC-treated group. Interestingly, MSCs expressed inducible IL-1Ra against inflammatory environmental stimuli. Human recombinant IL-1Ra could suppress Th17 cells differentiation under Th17 polarizing conditions. These results indicate that IL-1Ra expressed by MSCs can inhibit Th17 polarization and decrease the immune response in IL-1RaKO mice.

https://openalex.org/W2791571679,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a Cl− channel that apparently has evolved from an ancestral active transporter. Key to the CFTR’s switch from pump to channel function may have been the appearance of one or more “lateral portals.” Such portals connect the cytoplasm to the transmembrane channel pore, allowing a continuous pathway for the electrodiffusional movement of Cl− ions. However, these portals remain the least well-characterized part of the Cl− transport pathway; even the number of functional portals is uncertain, and if multiple portals do exist, their relative functional contributions are unknown. Here, we used patch-clamp recording to identify the contributions of positively charged amino acid side chains located in CFTR’s cytoplasmic transmembrane extensions to portal function. Mutagenesis-mediated neutralization of several charged side chains reduced single-channel Cl− conductance. However, these same mutations differentially affected channel blockade by cytoplasmic suramin and Pt(NO2)42− anions. We considered and tested several models by which the contribution of these positively charged side chains to one or more independent or non-independent portals to the pore could affect Cl− conductance and interactions with blockers. Overall, our results suggest the existence of a single portal that is lined by several positively charged side chains that interact electrostatically with both Cl− and blocking anions. We further propose that mutations at other sites indirectly alter the function of this single portal.

However, these portals remain the least well-characterized part of the Cl− transport pathway; even the number of functional portals is uncertain, and if multiple portals do exist, their relative functional contributions are unknown. Here, we used patch-clamp recording to identify the contributions of positively charged amino acid side chains located in CFTR’s cytoplasmic transmembrane extensions to portal function. Mutagenesis-mediated neutralization of several charged side chains reduced single-channel Cl− conductance. However, these same mutations differentially affected channel blockade by cytoplasmic suramin and Pt(NO2)42− anions. We considered and tested several models by which the contribution of these positively charged side chains to one or more independent or non-independent portals to the pore could affect Cl− conductance and interactions with blockers. Overall, our results suggest the existence of a single portal that is lined by several positively charged side chains that interact electrostatically with both Cl− and blocking anions. We further propose that mutations at other sites indirectly alter the function of this single portal. Comparison of our functional results with recent structural information on CFTR completes our picture of the overall molecular architecture of the Cl− permeation pathway."

LTs cleave the β-1,4-glycosidic bond between N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) and GlcNAc in the PG glycan strand, resulting in the concomitant formation of 1,6-anhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid and GlcNAc. No LTs reported to date have utilized chitins as substrates, despite the fact that chitins are GlcNAc polymers linked via β-1,4-glycosidic bonds, which are the known site of chemical activity for LTs. Here, we demonstrate enzymatically that LtgA, a non-canonical, substrate-permissive LT from Neisseria meningitidis utilizes chitopentaose ((GlcNAc)5) as a substrate to produce three newly identified sugars: 1,6-anhydro-chitobiose, 1,6-anhydro-chitotriose, and 1,6-anhydro-chitotetraose. Although LTs have been widely studied, their complex reactions have not previously been visualized in the crystalline state because macromolecular PG is insoluble. Here, we visualized the cleavage of the glycosidic bond and the liberation of GlcNAc-derived residues by LtgA, followed by the synthesis of atypical 1,6-anhydro-GlcNAc derivatives. In addition to the newly identified anhydro-chitin products, we identified trapped intermediates, unpredicted substrate rearrangements, sugar distortions, and a conserved crystallographic water molecule bound to the catalytic glutamate of a high-resolution native LT.

https://openalex.org/W2794193511,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common inherited disorders. ADPKD is caused by mutations in the gene encoding either polycystic kidney disease 1 (PKD1) or polycystic kidney disease 2 (PKD2). Patients with ADPKD show progressive growth of cystic fluid-filled renal cysts. Here, we used Pkd2f/fcontrol mice and Pkd2f/f :HoxB7-Cre experimental mice, which are bred to have a conditional deletion of Pkd2 in the collecting ducts, and analyzed the expression pattern of microRNAs (miRNAs) of kidney tissues from Pkd2f/f and Pkd2f/f:HoxB7-Cre mice. Decreased expression of miR-20b-5p and miR-106a-5p in Pkd2f/f:HoxB7-Cre mice compared to that in Pkd2f/f mice was observed. These miRNAs target Klf12 (Kriippel-like factor 12), which has low expression in kidney tissues of Pkd2f/f mice; however, its expression is enhanced in Pkd2f/f:HoxB7-Cre mice over time. Moreover, miR-20b-5p and miR-106a-5p directly target Klf12 mRNA by binding to the 3′-UTR of Klf12.ln addition, human and mouse cell lines exhibit similar patterns. These findings were also consistent with the data from Pkd2 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Furthermore, direct and indirect knockdown of Klf12 slows cyst growth and cell proliferation in mouse inner medullary collecting duct cells. Taken together, we suggest that the induction of miR-20b-5p or miR-106a-5p or the down-regulation of KLF12 could be used as potential novel therapies for inhibiting cyst growth in patients with ADPKD.—Shin, Y., Kim, D.Y., Ko, J.Y., Woo, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2788452769,"Introduction Work-related exposure to silica is a global health hazard that causes diseases such as silicosis. Some studies have also reported that silica exposure is linked to elevated cardiovascular disease mortality. However, these diagnoses have not been investigated in detail and there have been few studies on morbidity. The aim of this study is to examine morbidity and mortality from different cardiovascular diseases among silica-exposed Swedish foundry workers. Methods Historical and contemporary measurements (1968–2006) of respiratory silica exposure were matched to job categories, individual foundries, and 4 time periods (1968–1979, 1980–1989, 1990–1999, 2000–2006) using a mixed model. Morbidity and mortality data for the studied cohorts were matched against the General Population Registry. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS and STATA, and the data were stratified by age, gender, and year. Results Mortality from cardiovascular disease (SMR 1.3; 95% CI 1.2–1.4) and stroke (SMR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2–2.1) was significantly elevated among the studied population. The cohort also exhibited significantly elevated morbidity from stroke (SIR 1.34; 95% CI 1.2–1.5) but not myocardial infarction. The mean age at the time of first morbidity from stroke was 64 years, with 36% of the cases occurring before the age of 60. Conclusions Swedish foundry workers exposed to respirable silica exhibit elevated morbidity and mortality from stroke, but not from myocardial infarction. Our results also suggest a relationship between silica exposure and morbidity from stroke at a younger age than the general population."
https://openalex.org/W2790691740,"Mycobacterium fortuitum (MF), a rapidly growing nontuberculosis mycobacterium, is recognized as an important human pathogen. We investigated whether the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response is associated with the apoptosis of MF-infected macrophages. The expression of ER molecular chaperones was significantly induced by MF infection. We found that MF-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation plays a critical role in the induction of ER stress-mediated apoptosis. Excess TNF-α in the ER led to ER stress-mediated apoptosis during MF infection. The intracellular survival of MF was significantly increased by TNF-α knockdown compared with the control. This is the first report of MF-induced TNF-α as a cause of ER stress in macrophages. Furthermore, we found that TLR2-mediated ER stress response contributed to the elimination of intracellular MF in vivo. These results suggest that TNF-α-mediated ER stress during MF infection contributes to the suppression of intracellular survival of MF in macrophages. Our findings provide new insight into the importance of ER stress in mycobacterial infection.-Oh, S.-M., Lim, Y.-J., Choi, J.-A., Lee, J., Cho, S.-N., Go, D., Kim, S.-H., Song, C.-H.

Exiting literature does not provide any information on renal outcomes among dengue patients surviving an episode of AKI.Dengue patients who developed AKI were followed up for post-discharge period of three months and renal recovery was assessed by using recovery criteria based on different thresholds of serum creatinine (SCr) and estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR).Out of the 526 dengue participants, AKI was developed in 72 (13.7%) patients. Renal recovery was assessed among AKI survivors (n = 71). The use of less (±50% recovery to baseline) to more (±5% recovery to baseline) stringent definitions of renal recovery yielded recovery rates from 88.9% to 2.8% by SCr and 94.4% to 5.6% by eGFR, as renal function biomarkers. At the end of study, eight patients had AKI with AKIN-II (n = 7) and AKIN-III (n = 1). Approximately 50% patients (n = 36/71) with AKI had eGFR primitive to CKD stage 2, while 18.3% (n = 13/71) and 4.2% (n = 3/71) patients had eGFR corresponding to advanced stages of CKD (stage 3 & 4). Factors such as renal insufficiencies at hospital discharge, multiple organ involvements, advance age, female gender and diabetes mellitus were associated with poor renal outcomes.We conclude that dengue patients with AKI portend unsatisfactory short-term renal outcomes and deserve a careful and longer follow-up, especially under nephrology care."

The function of these complexes requires specificity of the interaction to allow for selective electron transfer but also a fast turnover of the complex, and they are therefore often transient in nature, making them challenging to study. Here, using small-angle neutron scattering with contrast matching with deuterated protein, we report the solution structure of the electron transfer complex between cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) and its electron transfer partner cytochrome c. This is the first reported solution structure of a complex between CPR and an electron transfer partner. The structure shows that the interprotein interface includes residues from both the FMN- and FAD-binding domains of CPR. In addition, the FMN is close to the heme of cytochrome c but distant from the FAD, indicating that domain movement is required between the electron transfer steps in the catalytic cycle of CPR. In summary, our results reveal key details of the CPR catalytic mechanism, including interactions of two domains of the reductase with cytochrome c and motions of these domains relative to one another. These findings shed light on interprotein electron transfer in this system and illustrate a powerful approach for studying solution structures of protein–protein complexes.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, the most common chronic liver disorder in developed countries, is characterized by the abnormal retention of excess lipid within hepatocytes and predisposes individuals to liver cancer. We previously reported that the levels of Lissencephaly 1 (LIS1, also known as PAFAH1B1) are down-regulated in human hepatocellular carcinoma. Following up on this observation, we found that genetic deletion of Lis1 in the mouse liver increases lipid accumulation and inflammation in this organ. Further analysis revealed that loss of Lis1 triggers endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and reduces triglyceride secretion. Attenuation of ER stress by addition of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) diminished lipid accumulation in the Lis1-deficient hepatocytes. Moreover, the Golgi stacks were disorganized in Lis1-deficient liver cells. Of note, the Lis1 liver-knockout mice exhibited increased hepatocyte ploidy and accelerated development of liver cancer after exposure to the liver carcinogen diethylnitrosamine (DEN). Taken together, these findings suggest that reduced Lis1 levels can spur the development of liver diseases from steatosis to liver cancer and provide a useful model for delineating the molecular pathways that lead to these diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2792826637,"Radial spokes are structurally conserved, macromolecular complexes that are essential for the motility of 9 + 2 motile cilia. In Chlamydomonas species, mutations in radial spoke proteins result in ciliary motility defects. However, little is known about the function of radial spoke proteins during embryonic development. Here, we investigated the role of a novel radial spoke protein, leucine-rich repeat containing protein 23 (Lrrc23), during zebrafish embryonic development. Mutations in lrrc23 resulted in a selective otolith formation defect during early ear development. Similar otolith defects were also present in the radial spoke head 3 homolog (rsph3)and radial spoke head 4 homolog A (rsph4a) radial spoke mutants. Notably, the radial spoke protein mutations specifically affected ciliary motility in the otic vesicle (OV), whereas motile cilia in other organs functioned normally. Via highspeed video microscopy, we found that motile cilia formation was stochastic and transient in the OV. Importantly, all the motile cilia in the OV beat circularly, in contrast to the planar beating pattern of typical 9 + 2 motile cilia. We identified the key time frame for motile cilia formation during OV development. Finally, we showed that the functions of radial spoke proteins were conserved between zebrafish and Tetrahymena. Together, our results suggest that radial spoke proteins are essential for ciliary motility in the OV and that radial spoke-regulated OV motile cilia represent a unique type of cilia during early zebrafish embryonic development.—Han, X., Xie, H., Wang, Y., Zhao, C.

https://openalex.org/W2788586182,"Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is a molecular chaperone which stabilizes client proteins with important roles in tumor growth. 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), an inhibitor of HSP90 ATPase activity, occupies the ATP binding site of HSP90 causing a conformational change which destabilizes client proteins and directs them towards proteosomal degradation. Malignant melanomas have active RAF-MEK-ERK signaling which can occur either through an activating mutation in BRAF (BRAFV600E) or through activation of signal transduction upstream of BRAF. Prior work showed that 17-AAG inhibits cell growth in BRAFV600E and BRAF wildtype (BRAFWT) melanomas, although there were conflicting reports about the dependence of BRAFV600E and BRAFWT upon HSP90 activity for stability. Here, we demonstrate that BRAFWT and CRAF are bound by HSP90 in BRAFWT, NRAS mutant melanoma cells. HSP90 inhibition by 17-AAG inhibits ERK signaling and cell growth by destabilizing CRAF but not BRAFWT in the majority of NRAS mutant melanoma cells. The highly-selective BRAFV600E inhibitor, PLX4032 (vemurafenib), inhibits ERK signaling and cell growth in mutant BRAF melanoma cells, but paradoxically enhances signaling in cells with wild-type BRAF. In our study, we examined whether 17-AAG could inhibit PLX4032-enhanced ERK signaling in BRAFWT melanoma cells. As expected, PLX4032 alone enhanced ERK signaling in the BRAFWT melanoma cell lines Mel-Juso, SK-Mel-2, and SK-Mel-30, and inhibited signaling and cell growth in BRAFV600E A375 cells. However, HSP90 inhibition by 17-AAG inhibited PLX4032-enhanced ERK signaling and inhibited cell growth by destabilizing CRAF. Surprisingly, 17-AAG also stimulated melanin production in SK-Mel-30 cells and enhanced TYRP1 and DCT expression without stimulating TYR production in all three BRAFWT cell lines studied as well as in B16F10 mouse melanoma cells. In vivo, the combination of 17-AAG and cellular immunotherapy directed against Tyrp1 enhanced the inhibition of tumor growth compared to either therapy alone. Our studies support a role for 17-AAG and HSP90 inhibition in enhancing cellular immunotherapy for melanoma."

Adaptor protein containing pleckstrin homology domain, phosphotyrosine-binding domain, and leucine zipper motif (APPL1) stimulates adiponectin signaling and promotes adiponectin’s insulin-sensitizing effects by binding to two adiponectin receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, and the insulin receptor. In this study, we report an alternative splicing variant of APPL1 (APPL1sv) that is highly expressed in mouse liver, pancreas, and spleen tissues. The expression levels of APPL1sv in liver tissues were enhanced in a mouse model of obesity and diabetic dyslipidemia (i.e. db/db mice) and reduced in calorie-restricted mice compared with ad libitum–fed mice. APPL1sv overexpression or suppression inhibited or enhanced, respectively, adiponectin-stimulated phosphorylation of AMP protein kinase (AMPK) in mouse hepatocytes. We also found that APPL1sv binds to AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 under basal conditions and that adiponectin treatment reduces this binding. Overexpression of APPL1sv blocked adiponectin-induced interactions of APPL1 with the adiponectin receptors. Moreover, adenovirus-mediated and short hairpin RNA–based suppression of APPL1sv greatly reduced high fat diet–induced insulin resistance and hepatic glucose production in mice.

Despite these similarities, APPL2 acts in the form of two homodimers, in contrast to a single homodimer form for APPL1 (14Rodgers J.T. Lerin C. Haas W. Gygi S.P. Spiegelman B.M. Puigserver P. Nutrient control of glucose homeostasis through a complex of PGC-1α and SIRT1.Nature. 2005; 434 (15744310): 113-11810.1038/nature03354Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar), and antagonizes APPL1 action on adiponectin signaling, acting in Yin-Yang regulation (15Mitsuuchi Y. Johnson S.W. Sonoda G. Tanno S. Golemis E.A. Testa J.R. Identification of a chromosome 3p14.3–21.1 gene, APPL, encoding an adaptor molecule that interacts with the oncoprotein-serine/threonine kinase AKT2.Oncogene. 1999; 18 (10490823): 4891-489810.1038/sj.onc.1203080Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In this study, we report a splicing variant of APPL1 (APPL1sv) that is specifically expressed in mouse liver, pancreas, and spleen tissues. We found that the levels of APPL1sv protein expression in liver tissue are inversely correlated with insulin sensitivity in mouse models. Additionally, we demonstrate an inhibitory role of this splicing variant in regulating adiponectin signaling and function in hepatic cells and in vivo. Our study reveals, for the first time, a splicing variant of APPL1 that antagonizes adiponectin signaling and action in liver. To understand the mechanism regulating adiponectin action in cells, we conducted yeast two-hybrid screening to identify signaling molecules that interact with adiponectin receptors. In addition to APPL1 (7Mao X. Kikani C.K. Riojas R.A. Langlais P. Wang L. Ramos F.J. Fang Q. Christ-Roberts C.Y. Hong J.Y. Kim R.Y. Liu F. Dong L.Q. APPL1 binds to adiponectin receptors and mediates adiponectin signalling and function.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8 (16622416): 516-52310.1038/ncb1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar), we obtained a candidate gene that contains an extra exon (exon 10) in conventional APPL1 cDNA (Fig. 1A), which results in a long form of APPL1 cDNA containing a total of 23 exons. To confirm the existence of this extra exon in the genome, we performed a sequence alignment analysis through the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST), available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi), and found that exon 10 is conserved in the appl1 gene among humans, mice, rats, and zebrafish (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, there is a premature stop codon after a few residues within exon 10, which suggests a truncated form of APPL1 protein expression (Fig. 1A). Additionally, the genomic regions downstream of this premature stop codon are also highly conserved among humans, rats, and mice but not in fish, indicating that the premature stop is important to evolution and that the regulatory mechanism of exon 10 expression should be common in mammals. Based on our findings, we registered human svAPPL1 and mouse svAPPL1 in the GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank under accession numbers MG569951 for human and MF113398.1 for mouse. To determine whether exon 10 is retained in APPL1 transcripts, we isolated total mRNAs from the liver tissue of C57BL/6J mice and performed a reverse transcriptase reaction to generate a liver cDNA pool. The presence of exon 10 in the liver transcripts was determined by PCR, with the forward and reverse primers located on exon 9 and exon 11, respectively (Fig. 1B). The APPL1 plasmid and the APPL1 plasmid containing exon 10 were used as controls for PCR fragments lacking and containing exon 10, respectively. The cDNA pool generated from mouse liver tissue was subjected to PCR analysis with the abovementioned primer set, and two bands of 220 bp (lacking exon 10) and 344 bp (containing exon 10) were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1B), indicating the presence of a novel splicing variant of APPL1 (hereafter referred to as APPL1sv) in liver tissues in addition to conventional APPL1. We next examined whether APPL1sv protein is expressed in human or mouse cells and tissues. Given that exons 1–10 of the appl1 gene encode 236 amino acids, the predicted molecular mass of APPL1sv should be 29 kDa (Fig. 1C). With the antibody specific against the N-terminal BAR domain but not the C-terminal part of APPL1, we found that APPL1sv protein is expressed in both mouse and human hepatic cell lines (Fig. 1D). Unlike APPL1, which is widely expressed in various mouse tissues (7Mao X. Kikani C.K. Riojas R.A. Langlais P. Wang L. Ramos F.J. Fang Q. Christ-Roberts C.Y. Hong J.Y. Kim R.Y. Liu F. Dong L.Q. APPL1 binds to adiponectin receptors and mediates adiponectin signalling and function.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8 (16622416): 516-52310.1038/ncb1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar), APPL1sv is highly expressed in the liver and, to a lesser extent, in the pancreas and spleen (Fig. 1C). Under calorie restriction, which significantly increased SIRT1 levels as in previous reports (14Rodgers J.T. Lerin C. Haas W. Gygi S.P. Spiegelman B.M. Puigserver P. Nutrient control of glucose homeostasis through a complex of PGC-1α and SIRT1.Nature. 2005; 434 (15744310): 113-11810.1038/nature03354Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar), both the mRNA (Fig. 1F) and protein levels (Fig. 1E) of APPL1sv, but not of APPL1, were significantly reduced in the liver tissues. In addition, the protein levels of APPL1sv were significantly higher in the livers of db/db mice compared with controls (Fig. 1G), although the mRNA levels were reduced (Fig. 1H). Collectively, these data suggest that APPL1sv expression is inversely correlated with insulin sensitivity in mouse models. To understand the role of hepatic APPL1sv in vivo, we generated adenoviruses containing GFP plus APPL1sv shRNA that target exon 10 in APPL1 transcripts or GFP plus the scrambled control sequence. Infection of primary mouse hepatocytes with adenoviruses containing the shRNA led to suppression of APPL1sv expression, but not of APPL1 and APPL2 expression, compared with cells transfected with the viruses containing scrambled control (Fig. 2A). Male C57BL/6J mice fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) were injected with adenovirus containing APPL1sv shRNA or the scrambled control via tail vein injection. Fourteen days after injection, APPL1sv expression was selectively suppressed by the shRNA in the liver (Fig. 2B) but not in the pancreas (Fig. 2C) or the spleen tissues (Fig. 2D). Suppression of APPL1sv expression had no effect on glucose tolerance (Fig. 2E). However, insulin tolerance tests showed that suppression of hepatic APPL1sv expression led to a significant improvement of insulin sensitivity in diet-induced obese mice (Fig. 2F). Consistent with this finding, APPL1sv shRNA injection reduced fasting glucose (Fig. 2G) and insulin levels (Fig. 2H) in mice; the mRNA levels of two key gluconeogenic enzymes, glucose-6-phosphatase (Glc-6-Pase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), were also suppressed (Fig. 2I). In agreement with reduced gluconeogenic gene expression, hepatic glucose production was decreased in primary hepatocytes infected with an adenovirus containing APPL1sv shRNA compared with controls (Fig. 2J). Taken together, these results indicate that suppression of hepatic APPL1sv expression in HFD-fed mice leads to improvement of insulin sensitivity and reduction of hepatic glucose production and gluconeogenic gene expression, suggesting an inhibitory role of APPL1sv in regulating hepatic insulin sensitivity and function in vivo. To investigate the mechanism underlying the inhibitory role of APPL1sv in insulin sensitivity, we suppressed APPL1sv and APPL1 expression with the respective shRNAs in mouse hepatocytes (Fig. 3A). Consistent with our previous reports that down-regulation of APPL1 expression reduces AMPK expression and blocks adiponectin-stimulated AMPK phosphorylation in muscle cells (7Mao X. Kikani C.K.

On the other hand, suppression of APPL1sv expression in hepatocytes significantly enhanced basal AMPK phosphorylation (Fig. 3A). To test whether up-regulation of APPL1sv is sufficient to inhibit adiponectin signaling, we expressed myc-tagged APPL1sv or APPL1 in hepatocytes. As shown in Fig. 3B, overexpression of APPL1sv blocked adiponectin-stimulated AMPK phosphorylation, which is opposite to the effect of overexpressing APPL1 on adiponectin signaling (7Mao X.

Together, these results indicate that APPL1sv plays an inhibitory role in regulating adiponectin signaling in hepatic cells. We and others have demonstrated that APPL1 potentiates insulin signaling via direct binding with Akt, IRS1/2, and IR (9Ryu J. Galan A.K. Xin X. Dong F. Abdul-Ghani M.A. Zhou L. Wang C. Li C.

We next investigated the role of APPL1sv in regulating insulin signaling by suppressing or overexpressing APPL1sv in hepatocytes. Although suppression or overexpression of APPL1 reduced or promoted insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation, respectively, as we reported previously in muscle cells (7Mao X. Kikani C.K. Riojas R.A.

Nevertheless, our data suggest that APPL1sv suppresses insulin sensitivity via selectively regulating adiponectin signaling but not directly targeting the insulin signaling pathway. APPL1 promotes adiponectin signaling by binding directly with adiponectin receptors in muscle and liver cells (7Mao X. Kikani C.K. Riojas R.A. Langlais P. Wang L. Ramos F.J. Fang Q. Christ-Roberts C.Y. Hong J.Y. Kim R.Y. Liu F. Dong L.Q. APPL1 binds to adiponectin receptors and mediates adiponectin signalling and function.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8 (16622416): 516-52310.1038/ncb1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). We therefore tested potential interactions of APPL1sv with signaling proteins in the adiponectin pathway. To this end, we generated an antibody using APPL1sv protein that contained the BAR domain of APPL1 as the antigen. Immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that this homemade APPL1sv antibody specifically recognizes and binds to APPL1sv (Fig. 4A) but cannot recognize or bind to APPL1 and APPL2 in mouse hepatocytes (data not shown). Co-immunoprecipitation assays indicated that, unlike APPL1, APPL1sv does not interact with APPL1 or APPL2 in cells (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, APPL1sv, like APPL1, pulled down both AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 from hepatic cells under basal conditions (Fig. 4B). Consistent with the opposite roles of APPL1 and APPL1sv in regulating adiponectin signaling, adiponectin treatment induced significant dissociation of APPL1sv from AdipoR1 (Fig. 4B), whereas stimulation promoted the binding of APPL1 with adiponectin receptors, as we have reported previously (7Mao X. Kikani C.K. Riojas R.A. Langlais P. Wang L. Ramos F.J. Fang Q. Christ-Roberts C.Y. Hong J.Y. Kim R.Y. Liu F. Dong L.Q.

A time course study revealed that adiponectin stimulation induced rapid dissociation of APPL1sv from AdipoR1 (Fig. 4C), which is opposite to the effect of adiponectin on APPL1–AdipoRs interactions (7Mao X. Kikani C.K. Riojas R.A. Langlais P. Wang L. Ramos F.J. Fang Q. Christ-Roberts C.Y. Hong J.Y. Kim R.Y. Liu F. Dong L.Q.

Consistent with the in vitro binding study (Fig. 4B), there was a limited effect of adiponectin on the interaction of APPL1sv with AdipoR2 in hepatic cells (Fig. 4C), suggesting a selective effect of APPL1sv on the adiponectin-AdipoR1 signal pathway. To investigate the mechanism underlying APPL1sv action on adiponectin signaling, we tested whether overexpressing APPL1sv is sufficient to block adiponectin-stimulated binding of APPL1 to AdipoR1. Endogenous APPL1 was immunoprecipitated in the absence or presence of exogenous APPL1sv in mouse hepatocytes. As shown in Fig. 4D, adiponectin-stimulated association of APPL1 with AdipoR1 was significantly reduced in cells overexpressing APPL1sv. In addition, we tested cellular localization of APPL1sv in response to adiponectin stimulation. Consistent with our previous report in myotubes (16Wang C. Xin X. Xiang R. Ramos F.J. Liu M. Lee H.J.

In contrast, APPL1sv co-localized with AdipoR1 under unstimulated conditions, and adiponectin treatment induced APPL1sv cytosolic translocation and dissociation with AdipoR1 (Fig. 4E). Together, these data indicate that APPL1sv plays an inhibitory role in regulating hepatic adiponectin signaling by binding with adiponectin receptors and preventing the interaction of APPL1 with AdipoR1 in the liver. The adaptor protein APPL1 positively mediates adiponectin signaling by binding directly with adiponectin receptors (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2) in multiple cells (7Mao X. Kikani C.K. Riojas R.A. Langlais P.

In this study, we report for the first time the existence of a splicing variant of APPL1 (APPL1sv) that plays an inhibitory role in regulating hepatic adiponectin signaling and action by binding with adiponectin receptors to block the interaction of APPL1 with AdipoR1 (Fig. 4F). The expression of APPL1sv is mostly in the liver, with lower expression in the pancreas and spleen. Because liver tissue is one of the major target sites for insulin and adiponectin action (17Berg A.H. Combs T.P. Du X. Brownlee M. Scherer P.E.

Consistent with this, the expression levels of APPL1sv were significantly decreased in the livers of mice under calorie restriction but increased in db/db mice.

https://openalex.org/W2789926450,"Appropriate sexual selection or individual sexual attractiveness is closely associated with the reproductive success of a species. Here, we report that young male flies exhibit innate courtship preference for female flies that are raised on higher-yeast diets and that have greater body weight and fecundity, but reduced locomotor activity and shortened lifespan. Male flies discriminate among females that have been fed diets that contain 3 different yeast concentrations-1, 5, and 20% yeast- via gustatory, but not visual or olfactory, perception. Female flies that are raised on higher-yeast diets exhibit elevated expression levels of Drosophila insulin-like peptides (di lps), and we demonstrate that hypomorphic mutations of di lp2, 3, 5 or foxo, as well as oenocyte-specific gene disruption of the insulin receptor, all abolish this male courtship preference for high yeast-fed females. Moreover, our data demonstrate that disrupted di lp signaling can alter the expression profile of some cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) in female flies, and that genetic inhibition of an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of CHCs in oenocytes, elongase F, also eliminates the male courtship preference. Together, our findings provide mechanistic insights that link female reproductive potential to sexual attractiveness, thereby encouraging adaptive mating and optimal reproductive success.-Lin, W.-S., Yeh, S.-R., Fan, S.-Z., Chen, L.-Y., Yen, J.-H., Fu, T.-F., Wu, M.-S., Wang, P.-Y.

https://openalex.org/W2790052416,"Protein kinases (PKs) control many aspects of plant physiology by regulating signaling networks through protein phosphorylation. Phototropins (phots) are plasma membrane–associated serine/threonine PKs that control a range of physiological processes that collectively serve to optimize photosynthetic efficiency in plants. These include phototropism, leaf positioning and flattening, chloroplast movement, and stomatal opening. Despite their identification over two decades ago, only a handful of substrates have been identified for these PKs. Progress in this area has been hampered by the lack of a convenient means to confirm the identity of potential substrate candidates. Here we demonstrate that the kinase domain of Arabidopsis phot1 and phot2 can be successfully engineered to accommodate non-natural ATP analogues by substituting the bulky gatekeeper residue threonine for glycine. This approach circumvents the need for radioactivity to track phot kinase activity and follow light-induced receptor autophosphorylation in vitro by incorporating thiophosphate from N6-benzyl-ATPγS. Consequently, thiophosphorylation of phot substrate candidates can be readily monitored when added or co-expressed with phots in vitro. Furthermore, gatekeeper-modified phot1 retained its functionality and its ability to accommodate N6-benzyl-ATPγS as a phosphodonor when expressed in Arabidopsis. We therefore anticipate that this chemical genetic approach will provide new opportunities for labeling and identifying substrates for phots and other related AGC kinases under in vitro and near-native in vivo conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2791982258,"Autocrine insulin signaling is critical for pancreatic β-cell growth and activity and is at least partially controlled by protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) that act on insulin receptors (IRs). The receptor-type PTP phogrin primarily localizes on insulin secretory granules in pancreatic β cells. We recently reported that phogrin knockdown decreases the protein levels of insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2), whereas high-glucose stimulation promotes formation of a phogrin–IR complex that stabilizes IRS2. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms by which phogrin affects IRS2 levels are unclear. Here, we found that relative to wildtype mice, IRS2 levels in phogrin-knockout mice islets decreased by 44%. When phogrin was silenced by shRNA in pancreatic β-cell lines, glucose-induced insulin signaling led to proteasomal degradation of IRS2 via a negative feedback mechanism. Phogrin overexpression in a murine hepatocyte cell line consistently prevented chronic insulin treatment–induced IRS2 degradation. In vitro, phogrin directly bound the IR without the assistance of other proteins and protected recombinant PTP1B from oxidation to potentiate its activity toward the IR. Furthermore, phogrin expression suppressed insulin-induced local generation of hydrogen peroxide and subsequent PTP1B oxidation, which allowed progression of IR dephosphorylation. Together, these results suggest that a transient interaction of phogrin with the IR enables glucose-stimulated autocrine insulin signaling through the regulation of PTP1B activity, which is essential for suppressing feedback-mediated IRS2 degradation in pancreatic β cells."
https://openalex.org/W2793327475,"Staphyloferrin B (SB) is an iron-chelating siderophore produced by Staphylococcus aureus in invasive infections. Proteins for SB biosynthesis and export are encoded by the sbnABCDEFGHI gene cluster, in which SbnI, a member of the ParB/Srx superfamily, acts as a heme-dependent transcriptional regulator of the sbn locus. However, no structural or functional information about SbnI is available. Here, a crystal structure of SbnI revealed striking structural similarity to an ADP-dependent free serine kinase, SerK, from the archaea Thermococcus kodakarensis. We found that features of the active sites are conserved, and biochemical assays and 31P NMR and HPLC analyses indicated that SbnI is also a free serine kinase but uses ATP rather than ADP as phosphate donor to generate the SB precursor O-phospho-l-serine (OPS). SbnI consists of two domains, and elevated B-factors in domain II were consistent with the open–close reaction mechanism previously reported for SerK. Mutagenesis of Glu20 and Asp58 in SbnI disclosed that they are required for kinase activity. The only known OPS source in bacteria is through the phosphoserine aminotransferase activity of SerC within the serine biosynthesis pathway, and we demonstrate that an S. aureus serC mutant is a serine auxotroph, consistent with a function in l-serine biosynthesis. However, the serC mutant strain could produce SB when provided l-serine, suggesting that SbnI produces OPS for SB biosynthesis in vivo. These findings indicate that besides transcriptionally regulating the sbn locus, SbnI also has an enzymatic role in the SB biosynthetic pathway. Staphyloferrin B (SB) is an iron-chelating siderophore produced by Staphylococcus aureus in invasive infections. Proteins for SB biosynthesis and export are encoded by the sbnABCDEFGHI gene cluster, in which SbnI, a member of the ParB/Srx superfamily, acts as a heme-dependent transcriptional regulator of the sbn locus. However, no structural or functional information about SbnI is available. Here, a crystal structure of SbnI revealed striking structural similarity to an ADP-dependent free serine kinase, SerK, from the archaea Thermococcus kodakarensis. We found that features of the active sites are conserved, and biochemical assays and 31P NMR and HPLC analyses indicated that SbnI is also a free serine kinase but uses ATP rather than ADP as phosphate donor to generate the SB precursor O-phospho-l-serine (OPS). SbnI consists of two domains, and elevated B-factors in domain II were consistent with the open–close reaction mechanism previously reported for SerK.

https://openalex.org/W2789370986,"Although a vesicular nucleocytoplasmic transport system is believed to exist in eukaryotic cells, the features of this pathway are mostly unknown. Here, we report that the BFRF1 protein of the Epstein-Barr virus improves vesicular transport of nuclear envelope (NE) to facilitate the translocation and clearance of nuclear components. BFRF1 expression induces vesicles that selectively transport nuclear components to the cytoplasm. With the use of aggregation-prone proteins as tools, we found that aggregated nuclear proteins are dispersed when these BFRF1-induced vesicles are formed. BFRF1-containing vesicles engulf the NE-associated aggregates, exit through from the NE, and putatively fuse with autophagic vacuoles. Chemical treatment and genetic ablation of autophagy-related factors indicate that autophagosome formation and autophagy-linked FYVE protein-mediated autophagic proteolysis are involved in this selective clearance of nuclear proteins. Remarkably, vesicular transport, elicited by BFRF1, also attenuated nuclear aggregates accumulated in neuroblastoma cells. Accordingly, induction of NE-derived vesicles by BFRF1 facilitates nuclear protein translocation and clearance, suggesting that autophagy-coupled transport of nucleus-derived vesicles can be elicited for nuclear component catabolism in mammalian cells.—Liu, G.-T., Kung, H.-N., Chen, C.-K., Huang, C., Wang, Y.-L., Yu, C.-P., Lee, C.-P.

https://openalex.org/W2789675720,"Cell surface–associated glycans mediate many cellular processes, including adhesion, migration, signaling, and extracellular matrix organization. The galactosylation of core fucose (GalFuc epitope) in paucimannose and complex-type N-glycans is characteristic of protostome organisms, including flatworms (planarians). Although uninvestigated, the structures of these glycans may play a role in planarian regeneration. Whole-organism MALDI-MS analysis of N-linked oligosaccharides from the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea revealed the presence of multiple isomeric high-mannose and paucimannose structures with unusual mono-, di-, and polygalactosylated (n = 3–5) core fucose structures; the latter structures have not been reported in other systems. Di- and trigalactosylated core fucoses were the most dominant glycomers. N-Glycans showed extensive, yet selective, methylation patterns, ranging from non-methylated to polymethylated glycoforms. Although the majority of glycoforms were polymethylated, a small fraction also consisted of non-methylated glycans. Remarkably, monogalactosylated core fucose remained unmethylated, whereas its polygalactosylated forms were methylated, indicating structurally selective methylation. Using database searches, we identified two potential homologs of the Galβ1–4Fuc–synthesizing enzyme from nematodes (GALT-1) that were expressed in the prepharyngeal, pharyngeal, and mesenchymal regions in S. mediterranea. The presence of two GALT-1 homologs suggests different requirements for mono- and polygalactosylation of core fucose for the formation of multiple isomers. Furthermore, we observed variations in core fucose glycosylation patterns in different planarian strains, suggesting evolutionary adaptation in fucose glycosylation. The various core chitobiose modifications and methylations create >60 different glycoforms in S. mediterranea. These results contribute greatly to our understanding of N-glycan biosynthesis and suggest the presence of a GlcNAc-independent biosynthetic pathway in S. mediterranea.

https://openalex.org/W2790876412,"Cytochrome b (Cytb) is the only mitochondrial encoded subunit from the bc1 complex. Cbp3 and Cbp6 are chaperones necessary for translation of the COB mRNA and Cytb hemylation. Here we demonstrate that their role in translation is dispensable in some laboratory strains, whereas their role in Cytb hemylation seems to be universally conserved. BY4742 yeast requires Cbp3 and Cbp6 for efficient COB mRNA translation, whereas the D273-10b strain synthesizes Cytb at wildtype levels in the absence of Cbp3 and Cbp6. Steady-state levels of Cytb are close to wildtype in mutant D273-10b cells, and Cytb forms non-functional, supercomplex-like species with cytochrome c oxidase, in which at least core 1, cytochrome c1, and Rieske iron-sulfur subunits are present. We demonstrated that Cbp3 interacts with the mitochondrial ribosome and with the COB mRNA in both BY4742 and D273-10b strains. The polymorphism(s) causing the differential function of Cbp3, Cbp6, and the assembly feedback regulation of Cytb synthesis is of nuclear origin rather than mitochondrial, and Smt1, a COB mRNA-binding protein, does not seem to be involved in the observed differential phenotype. Our results indicate that the essential role of Cbp3 and Cbp6 is to assist Cytb hemylation and demonstrate that in the absence of heme b, Cytb can form non-functional supercomplexes with cytochrome c oxidase. Our observations support that an additional protein or proteins are involved in Cytb synthesis in some yeast strains."
