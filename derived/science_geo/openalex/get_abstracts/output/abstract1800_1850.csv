https://openalex.org/W2045402478,"Abstract The 6.6 kb DNA fragment coding for the immunoglobulin γ1 chain was cloned from newborn mouse DNA using λgtWES·λB as the EK2 vector. The complete nucleotide sequence (1823 bases) of the γ1 chain gene was determined. The cloned gene contained the entire constant region gene sequence as well as the poly(A) addition site, but not the variable region gene. The results indicate that the variable and constant region genes of immunoglobulin heavy chain are separated in newborn mouse DNA. The constant region genes of other gamma chains (that is, γ2a, γ2b and γ3) are not present in the cloned DNA fragment. The sequence demonstrates that the γ1 chain gene is interrupted by three intervening sequences at the junction of the domains and the hinge region, as previously shown in the γ2b and α chain genes and in the γ1 chain gene cloned from myeloma. The results suggest that the intervening sequence was introduced into the heavy chain gene before divergence of the heavy chain classes, and also support the hypothesis that the splicing mechanism has facilitated the evolution of eucaryotic genes by linking duplicated domains or prototype peptides not directly adjacent to one another. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence of the γ1 chain gene around the boundaries of the coding and intervening sequences with those of other mouse genes revealed extensive divergence, although short prevalent sequences of AG-GTCAG at the 5′ border of the intervening sequence and TCTGCAG-GC at the 3′ border were deduced. A limited homology of nucleotide sequences was found among domains and between the hinge region and the 5′ portion of the CH2 domain. Comparison of 3′ untranslated sequences from the γ1 and γ2b chain genes and the mouse major β-globin gene shows significant homology and a palindrome sequence surrounding the poly(A) addition site."

https://openalex.org/W2081469381,"DNA cloned from the D. melanogaster (Oregon R) heat shock loci at 63BC and 95D codes for the 83,000 and the 68,000 dalton heat shock proteins, respectively. Both coding sequences occur once per haploid genome. Sequences complementary to messenger RNA for the 70,000 dalton heat shock protein are represented five times, twice at 87A and three times at 87 C. The copies at 87A differ characteristically from those at 87C in an interval of a few hundred bp near the 5' end of the messenger sequence, and the corresponding two classes of hsp 70 messenger RNA are found on polysomes after heat shock. Within this differential region, there is about 15% divergence between messenger sequences cloned from the two loci, while in the rest of the messenger region examined the homology is much closer although still imperfect. Unexpectedly, considerable homology is found between the sequence for the 68,000 dalton heat shock protein at 95D and the sequences for the 70,000 dalton protein at 87A and 87C, and between these sequences and a site in 87D. Messenger RNA molecules of 2.4, 2.55 and 3.05 kb code for the 68,000, 70,000 and 83,000 dalton heat shock proteins and hybridize to apparently uninterrupted DNA sequences of 2.1, 2.25 and 2.6 kb, respectively."

When both pathways are disrupted, control of saccadic eye movements is lost. Disruption of either pathway alone produces only subtle deficits."
https://openalex.org/W2166780858,"Abstract The immunoglobulin-encoding messenger RNAs in a pre-B cell-like lymphoma line, 70Z/3, were characterized according to size, concentration in nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments and response to stimulation by the B cell mitogen, lipopolysaccharide. The μ heavy chain and κ light chain mRNAs produced by these cells were size-fractionated on methylmercuryhydroxide-agarose gels, transferred to diazotized cellulose paper and identified by hybridization with radioactive cloned probes containing C μ or C κ sequences. Unstimulated cells, which produce only intracellular μ chains, contain negligible amounts of κ mRNA and a few hundred molecules of μ mRNA per cell. The ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic heavy chain mRNA sequences in these cells is about 50 times greater than in an immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cell. Stimulation of 70Z/ 3 cells by lipopolysaccharide, which causes the cells to express surface IgM, results in a greater than 10 fold increase in the concentration of κ mRNA, but does not markedly affect the level of μ mRNA. Four distinct μ mRNA components ranging in size from approximately 2.1 to 3.0 kb were observed in 70Z/3 cells as well as in a cloned derivative, 70Z/3–12. Two of these components, which were found in the membrane-bound polyribosomes, may code for the membrane and secretory forms of the μ heavy chain. The other two mRNAs, which were confined to the cytoplasmic fraction containing free polyribosomes and nonribosome-associated mRNP, may code for intracellular μ chains. The two membrane-bound μ mRNAs were observed in another immature B cell line, WEHI 231. In contrast, mature IgM-secreting plasma cells produce a single μ mRNA component of uniform size. The multiple species of μ mRNA may arise from different arrangements of the C μ genetic elements on allelic chromosomes and/or from alternative processing of C μ -containing transcripts."
https://openalex.org/W2088886801,"Approximately half of the ribosomal genes on the X chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster are interrupted by an insertion of type 1. Nuclear RNA from D. melanogaster embryos was transferred to DBM paper and hybridized with cloned type 1 insertion sequences. With a DNA fragment derived specifically from large insertions, transcripts were detected between 5 and 10 kb. These insertion transcripts represent less than one RNA molecule per nucleus, which is more than three orders of magnitude below the concentration of nascent rRNA chains, as determined by kinetics of hybridization. With a DNA fragment derived from the right end of large insertions which is also complementary to short insertions, more discrete RNA bands appeared with sizes between 1 and 8.5 kb, representing altogether about 13 RNA molecules per nucleus. Insertion transcripts large enough to be potential precursors to 28S rRNA represent less than one molecule per nucleus. It was shown by sandwich hybridization that at least some of the insertion transcripts are derived from rDNA. No significant difference was found between insertion transcripts in RNA extracted from ovaries, embryos, larvae, pupae or adult flies. Unless a mechanism other than splicing is involved, ribosomal genes with insertions cannot contribute significantly to the synthesis of 28S rRNA. A cytoplasmic RNA approximately 1 kb long, which is complementary to a short insertion and to ribosomal gene sequences flanking both sides of the insertion, was found. The abundance of this short unspliced RNA is about 50 molecules per embryo cell."

The sequence is heterogeneous in two positions but both forms, when drawn in a cloverleaf structure, have anticodon specificities for proline. We have termed these isoacceptors tRNA1Pro and tRNA2Pro. Aminoacylation studies confirmed the specificity for proline. The two forms occur in approximately equal amounts in uninfected mouse and chicken cells and in Moloney leukemia virus particles."
https://openalex.org/W1530263251,"The proteoglycans of the Rhesus monkey corneal stroma were characterized by analyzing both radiolabeled proteoglycans synthesized by corneas in organ culture and native corneal proteoglycans obtained by large scale preparations. The analyses indicate that the proteoglycans synthesized in organ culture were similar to, if not identical with, their counterparts in the stroma although they are synthesized in different prportions in vitro than they acumulate in vivo. The corneal stroma contains two proteoglycans. The chondroitin-dermatan sulfate proteoglycan consists of approximately 70% protein and has a Mr = approximately 100,000 to 150,000. It contains one chondroitin-dermatan sulfate side chain of Mr = approximately 55,000. The keratan sulfate proteoglycan consists of approximately 74% protein and has a Mr = approximately -40,000 to 70,000. It contains one or two keratan sulfate side chains with a Mr = approximately 7,000 each. Radiolabeling indicates that both proteoglycans contain glycoprotein-type oligosaccharides as part of their structure."
https://openalex.org/W2048365962,"An examination of cloned Drosophila DNA has revealed large clusters of densely spaced, short (less than or equal to 1 kb), moderately repetitive elements. Different clusters have many of the same repetitive elements, but these elements are arranged differently in each cluster. It is improbable that this clustered arrangement can be detected by conventional reassociation kinetic and electron microscopic techniques, but it can be detected and features of its fine structure can be determined by a two-dimensional version of Southern's blotting technique. The genomic organization of these clustered repetitive elements was investigated by hybridizing restriction fragments of cloned DNA to polytene chromosomes, to filter-bound recombinant DNA clones and to Southern blots of total Drosophila DNA. These studies demonstrated that clusters occur in euchromatic regions of the chromosomes and that at least one of the clusters has the same repetitive element organization in cloned and in chromosomal DNA. These studies also demonstrated that copies of the elements from one cluster are scattered in at least 1000 chromosomal regions. These regions appear to have differing concentrations of repetitive DNA, but together they account for a large fraction of Drosophila's moderately repetitive DNA. Aside from indicating the genomic organization of cluster elements, this work has identified cluster elements throughout a 9 kb region neighboring one of the heat shock genes, throughout the intron of the major rDNA repeat and within the apparently transposable element, 412."
https://openalex.org/W2003765305,"The complete nucleotide sequence of the gamma 2b constant region gene cloned from BALB/c liver DNA is reported. The sequence of approximately 1870 base pairs includes the 5' flanking, 3' untranslated, and 3' flanking regions and three introns. The C gamma 2b coding region is divided by these introns into four segments corresponding to the homology domains and hinge region of the protein. The introns separating the hinge from the CH2 domain and the CH2 from the CH3 domain are small (106 and 119 base pairs). A larger intervening sequence of 314 base pairs separates the CH1 and hinge regions. The stretch of DNA comprising this large intron plus the hinge shows a strong homology with the other CH domains."
https://openalex.org/W2037852958,"Two different types of heat-inducible sequences are found at the cytogenetic loci 87A7 and 87C1 of D. melanogaster. One of these codes for the 70,000 dalton heat shock protein (hsp 70) and is found at both loci. The other type of sequence (alpha beta) codes for an RNA of unknown function and is found only at 87C1. We have completed a study of the organization of the two loci, using deficiencies that delete one or other locus, and have estimated the number of the hsp 70 genes at each locus. Thus in at least three strains of files there are a total of five coding sequences, three at 87C1 and two at 87A7. Restriction mapping of the coding regions at the two loci reveals that each of the two cytogenetic loci has its own characteristic coding sequence. The overall organization of the two loci appears to differ considerably. The alpha beta and hsp 70 heat-induced sequences at 87C1 are closely linked and are contained within two Eco RI restriction fragments."

https://openalex.org/W1584652923,"The second heme-containing hydroperoxidase isozyme (HP-II) has been isolated from aerobic cultures of Escherichia coli B. The protein exists as a stable tetramer of subunits of equal size, with a combined molecular weight of 312,000. The heme spectrum of HP-II is unusual, in that it exhibits two absorbance maxima at 407 and 591 nm; the alkaline pyridine hemochromogen spectrum shows maxima at 425, 559, and 609 nm. HP-II differs in several respects from the HP-I isozyme previously reported (Claiborne, A., and Fridovich, I. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 4245-4252). Thus HP-II is virtually devoid of peroxidatic activity toward o-dianisidine but has a 6-fold higher catalatic activity than HP-I. Antisera to HP-II do not cross-react with HP-I, and analyses of chymotryptic and cyanogen bromide digests suggest differences in primary structure between these two isozymes."

https://openalex.org/W1519355795,"An enzyme which catalyzes the deamidation of thyroliberin (TRF; less than Glu-His-Pro-NH2) has been purified 110-fold from extracts of bovine anterior pituitary by ammonium sulfate fractionation, ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, and gel filtration. This enzyme of 76,000 molecular weight (as estimated by gel filtration) exhibits maximal activity at neutral pH (optimum pH 7.4 to 7.6) in buffers of high ionic strength supplemented with thiol-protecting agents. As indicated by the strong inhibition of the enzymatic activity by N-ethylmaleimide and Hg2+, as well as by the extreme sensitivity toward diisopropyl fluorophosphate, -SH, and -OH residues apparently represent essential functional groups of the enzyme. The stereospecific deamidation of TRF (Km = 4.1 . 10(-4) M) is inhibited competitively by TRF analogues which contain proline or by the proline containing biologically active peptides luliberin (LH-RF), oxytocin, vasopressin, angiotensin II, and Substance P. TRF analogues without proline or peptide amides without proline are ineffective. This enzyme cleaves the appropriate Pro-X bonds in luliberin, angiotensin II, pyroGlu-His-Pro-Gly-NH2, and the collagenase substrate Z-Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly-Pro. Thus, it may be characterized as a post-proline-cleaving enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1513505120,"The receptor-mediated internalization and degradation of radiolabeled diphtheria toxin by cultured monkey kidney cells was studied. The ability of a number of enzymes and chemicals to remove cell surface-bound toxin was tested; the combination of pronase and inositol hexaphosphate (PIHP) proved most effective. Using PIHP, the kinetics of toxin-cell association at 37 degrees C was resolved into two compounds: surface binding and internalization. The PIHP assay also allowed estimation of the half-time of toxin internalization (about 25 min). An assay involving precipitation of culture supernatants with trichloroacetic acid was developed and used to measure the rate of degradation and excretion of cell-associated toxin. Agents which markedly inhibited toxin internalization similarly prevented degradation, implying an intracellular location for the degradative process. The primary radioactive product excreted by Vero cells was monoiodotyrosine. The extent and rate of toxin degradation indicated lysosomal involvement. Finally, agents which blocked internalization or degradation, or both, (e.g. antibody and concanavalin A), protected cells from the cytotoxin action of diphtheria toxin, suggesting that these processes are necessary for expression of biological effect."
https://openalex.org/W1498232074,"Invertase, extracted from broken cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae X-2180 mm2 mannan mutant, was separated into a fraction insoluble in 75% ammonium sulfate (P75 invertase, 36% carbohydrate) and a soluble fraction (S75 invertase, 53% carbohydrate). The latter reacted with antibodies specific for the alpha 1 leads to 6-linked mannose of the mannoprotein outer chain, whereas the P75 invertase failed to react with this antiserum although it did react with serum against terminal alpha 1 leads to 3-linked mannose units that are characteristic of the mannoprotein core. A bacterial endo alpha 1 leads to 6-mannanase removed the outer chains from the S75 invertase and converted it to a form that was similar in electrophoretic and immunochemical properties to the P75 invertase, whereas the endomannanase had little effect on the latter invertase. The results suggest that the P75 invertase is a form of the enzyme to which only the core oligosaccharide units had been added, and the S75 invertase represents an enzyme fraction to which the polysaccharide outer chains were also attached. A strong anomeric PMR signal for unsubstituted alpha 1 leads to 6-linked mannose in the S75 invertase, and a much reduced signal in the P75 invertase and endomannanase-digested S75 invertase, support these conclusions. Endo-N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase digestion of the S75 and P75 invertases, as well as of a purified wild type yeast invertase, produced an apparently identical series of 3 to 4 carbohydrate-containing proteins that were separable by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate but that migrated as a single band on isoelectric focusing. The bands ranged from about 63,000 to 69,000 daltons and differed by the size of one or more carbohydrate core units each of 15 mannoses and 1 N-acetylglucosamine. The results suggest that the external invertase molecules contain some core units without attached outer chains, and that the cells contain a precursor form of the enzyme to which only the core units have been added. In support of this conclusion, PMR spectra and chromatographic patterns show that the core fragments from the P75, S75, and wild type invertases are essentially identical."

I have sequenced a 505-base pair DNA restriction fragment containing the genes which specify 5 S rRNA, TRNA1Asp, and tRNATrp, in that order. Segments of a spacer DNA separate these genes: the 5 S-tRNA1Asp and tRNA1Asp-tRNATrp spacers are 52 and 8 base pairs long, respectively. In vitro transcription of restriction endonuclease fragments containing the distal portion of rrnC indicates that termination of transcription occurs at a locus beginning 28 base pairs after the tRNATrp gene.

The coding portion of the sequence is 1008 nucleotides long (amino acid residues 114 to 449), and the 3' noncoding region contains 102 nucleotides preceeding the polyadenylate. An extra carboxyl-terminal lysine residue which had not been observed in the gamma 2b or other gamma subclass protein sequences occurs in the nucleotide sequence and is probably processed posttranslationally. A 17-nucleotide sequence occurs with slight variation twice in CH1 and once in CH2 domains in the same relative location but with different translational phase. This sequence may be the site of crossover in a gamma 2b . gamma 2a heavy chain variant, an indication of possible recombinational activity of some kind."

Functionally intact IgA dimer has been dissociated from milk secretory IgA using a chaotropic agent and further purified to homogeneity. The interaction between SC and IgA dimer is a reversible time- and temperature-dependent process. At 23 degrees C, the association rate constant (2.4 x 10(5) M-1 min-1) and the dissociation rate constant (1.8 x 10(-3) min-1) have been measured independently and the affinity constant based on these rates (1.3 x 10(8) M-1) is similar to that calculated from Scatchard plots (1.9 x 10(8) M-1). One class of binding sites has been estimated from Scatchard plots in spite of the observed heterogeneity of SC. The interaction is tighter at low temperatures because the decrease in dissociation rate is greater than the decrease in association rate. The thermodynamic calculations reveal a delta G of -11.0 kcal . mol-1, a delta H of -8.9 kcal . mol-1 and a delta S of +7.0 cal. mol-1 degree-1. The pH range over which interaction occurs is rather large (5 to 8) with no significant differences in apparent Ka."

The hydrolysis of GM1 is stimulated only by the GM1-specific activator which has very little effect on the hydrolysis of GM2. The same is also true for the hydrolysis of GM2. The antiserum raised against GM1 activator did not cross-react with GM2 activator and vice versa. These results suggest the presence of two different activators for the separate hydrolysis of GM1 and GM2. In connection with the enzymic hydrolysis of GM1 and GM2, we found that the hydrolysis of GM2 by human hepatic beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase A was severely inhibited by a buffer of high ionic strength, whereas no such inhibition was observed in the hydrolysis of GM1 by beta-galactosidase."
https://openalex.org/W2032636302,"Abstract The function and fate of antibodies introduced into living cells by red cell ghosts were studied using CRM 176 (a mutant diphtheria toxin having lower toxicity than the wild-type) and antibody against fragment A of diphtheria toxin. IgG labeled with iodine and FITC was found in the cytoplasm of the recipient cells. When about 1500 molecules of anti-fragment A antibody (rabbit IgG) were introduced into diphtheria toxin-sensitive Vero cells or FL cells, these cells became resistant to the toxin and formed normal colonies. It was calculated from the survival of cells without anti-fragment A IgG under these conditions that about 300 molecules of fragment A-176 were transferred to the cells. These results showed that the antigen-antibody reaction took place in living cells as effectively as in a cell-free system. The functional stability of antibody IgG in cells was examined by exposing Vero cells containing a subminimal amount of anti-fragment A IgG (about 1000 molecules) to the toxin for 2 hr at various times after the introduction of anti-fragment A IgG. More than 50% of the initial activity of the antibody to neutralize toxin still remained even after incubation of the cells at 37°C for 20 hr. The same degree of stability was also demonstrated using iodine-labeled specific anti-fragment A IgG. The IgG recovered from the recipient cells after various times of incubation at 37°C retained its full ability to bind to fragment A-conjugated Sepharose 4B, although the total amount of IgG associated with the cells decreased about 50% in 24 hr."

https://openalex.org/W1641343004,"gamma-L-Glutaminyl-[3,5-3H]4-hydroxybenzene was synthesized in order to study the kinetics of its hydroxylation by tyrosinase purified from Agaricus bisporus and to explore its role in the induction of the dormant state in the spores of this species. It was found to be unique among the monophenolic substrates for tyrosinase in that the lag period for the hydroxylation reaction decreased with increasing substrate concentration. Unlike previously studied compounds, this phenol appeared to function as an electron donor, allowing it to act as its own co-substrate in the hydroxylation reaction. Its catechol product, gamma-L-glutaminyl-3,4-dihydroxybenzene, was found to be a superior co-substrate, yielding its electrons more readily (oxidation peak potential +0.18 V as compared with +0.65 V for the phenol). In situ periodate oxidation of gamma-L-glutaminyl-3,4-dihydroxybenzene to gamma-L-glutaminyl-3,4-benzoquinone confirmed the co-substrate role of the catechol in the hydroxylation reaction. The tyrosinase-mediated oxidation of gamma-L-glutaminyl-3,4-dihydroxybenzene to gamma-L-glutaminyl-3,4-benzoquinone occurred with an apparent Km = 1.54 mM and Vmax = 0.36 mmol/min/mg of enzyme. gamma-L-Glutaminyl-4-hydroxybenzene acted as an inhibitor of the oxidation reaction."

https://openalex.org/W1496990612,"Lipophilic chelates of divalent copper, possessing superoxide dismutase-like activity, have been proposed to enhance the decay of oxycytochrome P-450 to explain their inhibitory effect on microsomal mixed-function oxidation reactions (Richter, C., Azzi, A., Weser, U., and Wendel, A. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 5061-5066). The present investigation, however, failed to provide evidence in favor of this hypothesis. In particular, it was found that the reported inhibition of cytochrome P-450-catalyzed hydroxylation reactions by copper-tyrosine is associated with an inhibition rather than a stimulation of the formation of hydrogen peroxide, the product of the dismutation of the superoxide radicals generated as a result of the decay of oxycytochrome P-450. The attenuation of both these reactions was shown to be the consequence of an impaired function of the NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase. Additional sites of interaction of copper chelates and the microsomal electron transport system appear to exist since divalent copper was found to undergo reduction reactions with NADPH and NADH as electron donors. These reduction reactions do not involve superoxide radicals and, therefore, are unrelated to the ability of copper chelates to function in a superoxide dismutase-like manner."
https://openalex.org/W1970192486,"An immediate precursor of 5S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) from Bacillus subtilis has 21 and 42 nucleotide precursor-specific segments associated with its 5' and 3' termini, respectively. On the basis of its nucleotide sequence, predicted secondary structure and location in the rRNA transcriptional unit, the 3' precursor element apparently functions during the termination of transcription. A portion of the 5' precursor element is shown to facilitate the native folding of the mature domain of the precursor. Precursor 5S rRNA molecules which lack the 5' terminal 8-9 nucleotides of the 5' precursor elements were fabricated. These abbreviated constructs assume a non-native conformation, as revealed by their behavior during polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The aberrant conformation is evidently forced upon the abbreviated constructs by the residual 5' precursor sequence, since its removal by the maturation endonuclease RNAase M5 precipitates the reordering of the mature domain into its native conformation. Inspection of the nucleotide sequence of the 5S precursor suggested the nature of the conformational aberration, and gel electrophoresis analyses of limited nuclease digests of end-labeled precursors in the native and aberrant conformations are consistent with the derived model. We conclude taht the 5' terminal six nucleotides in the intact 5S precursor assist in the folding of the mature domain by forming a base-paired duplex with neighboring nucleotides, thereby preventing that adjacent sequence from engendering the abnormal conformation. The involvement of precursor-specific sequences and conformational dynamics in RNA function are discussed."

When compared with the parental gamma 2b heavy chain, M 311 was found to have a carboxyl terminal deletion comprising the CH3 domain. The COOH-terminal cyanogen bromide (CNBr) cleavage fragment of M 311 is identical to a corresponding segment ofa parental heavy chain CNBr fragment, with the exception of a substitution of asparagine for lysine at the COOH-terminal residue. This observation enabled prediction of both the parental DNA sequence in this region and the genetic mechanism which generated the variant, a frameshift followed by premature termination.

The saccharide phosphates from Lipids 1 and 2 were identified as alpha-N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphate and its beta-anomer, respectively, based on their susceptibility to acid, alpha- and beta-N-acetylglucosaminidases, and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase.

Both the mRNA coding for the heavy and light chains appear as very prominent and discrete peaks above the generally polydisperse background of the total polysomal mRNA. This mRNA level appears to be stable through a limited number of subcutaneous passages of this myeloma, providing a potentially useful system for mu heavy chain mRNA synthesis and processing. The mu heavy chain mRNA of this myeloma has been enriched to about 60% homogeneity by physicochemical means. In agreement with a previous report (Faust, C.H., Jr., Heim, I., and Moore, J. (1979) Biochemistry 18, 1106-1119), the following physical and biological properties were observed. The mature cytoplasmic mu heavy chain mRNA is 950,000 daltons, i.e. about 2800 nucleotides, and contains approximately 800 undefined, nontranslated bases. In an mRNA-dependent cell-free system, this mRNA stimulates the synthesis of a single, serologically reactive mu heavy chain-like protein, confirmed by tryptic peptide maps."
