https://openalex.org/W4225246272,"The rates and patterns of somatic mutation in normal tissues are largely unknown outside of humans1-7. Comparative analyses can shed light on the diversity of mutagenesis across species, and on long-standing hypotheses about the evolution of somatic mutation rates and their role in cancer and ageing. Here we performed whole-genome sequencing of 208 intestinal crypts from 56 individuals to study the landscape of somatic mutation across 16 mammalian species. We found that somatic mutagenesis was dominated by seemingly endogenous mutational processes in all species, including 5-methylcytosine deamination and oxidative damage. With some differences, mutational signatures in other species resembled those described in humans8, although the relative contribution of each signature varied across species. Notably, the somatic mutation rate per year varied greatly across species and exhibited a strong inverse relationship with species lifespan, with no other life-history trait studied showing a comparable association. Despite widely different life histories among the species we examined-including variation of around 30-fold in lifespan and around 40,000-fold in body mass-the somatic mutation burden at the end of lifespan varied only by a factor of around 3. These data unveil common mutational processes across mammals, and suggest that somatic mutation rates are evolutionarily constrained and may be a contributing factor in ageing."
https://openalex.org/W4229074162,"The gut microbiome is associated with diverse diseases1-3, but a universal signature of a healthy or unhealthy microbiome has not been identified, and there is a need to understand how genetics, exposome, lifestyle and diet shape the microbiome in health and disease. Here we profiled bacterial composition, function, antibiotic resistance and virulence factors in the gut microbiomes of 8,208 Dutch individuals from a three-generational cohort comprising 2,756 families. We correlated these to 241 host and environmental factors, including physical and mental health, use of medication, diet, socioeconomic factors and childhood and current exposome. We identify that the microbiome is shaped primarily by the environment and cohabitation. Only around 6.6% of taxa are heritable, whereas the variance of around 48.6% of taxa is significantly explained by cohabitation. By identifying 2,856 associations between the microbiome and health, we find that seemingly unrelated diseases share a common microbiome signature that is independent of comorbidities. Furthermore, we identify 7,519 associations between microbiome features and diet, socioeconomics and early life and current exposome, with numerous early-life and current factors being significantly associated with microbiome function and composition. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive overview of gut microbiome and the underlying impact of heritability and exposures that will facilitate future development of microbiome-targeted therapies."
https://openalex.org/W4225259708,"Abstract Chromosome structure in mammals is thought to regulate transcription by modulating three-dimensional interactions between enhancers and promoters, notably through CTCF-mediated loops and topologically associating domains (TADs) 1–4 . However, how chromosome interactions are actually translated into transcriptional outputs remains unclear. Here, to address this question, we use an assay to position an enhancer at large numbers of densely spaced chromosomal locations relative to a fixed promoter, and measure promoter output and interactions within a genomic region with minimal regulatory and structural complexity. A quantitative analysis of hundreds of cell lines reveals that the transcriptional effect of an enhancer depends on its contact probabilities with the promoter through a nonlinear relationship. Mathematical modelling suggests that nonlinearity might arise from transient enhancer–promoter interactions being translated into slower promoter bursting dynamics in individual cells, therefore uncoupling the temporal dynamics of interactions from those of transcription. This uncovers a potential mechanism of how distal enhancers act from large genomic distances, and of how topologically associating domain boundaries block distal enhancers. Finally, we show that enhancer strength also determines absolute transcription levels as well as the sensitivity of a promoter to CTCF-mediated transcriptional insulation. Our measurements establish general principles for the context-dependent role of chromosome structure in long-range transcriptional regulation."
https://openalex.org/W4225320261,"Animal genomes are folded into loops and topologically associating domains (TADs) by CTCF and loop-extruding cohesins, but the live dynamics of loop formation and stability remain unknown. Here, we directly visualized chromatin looping at the Fbn2 TAD in mouse embryonic stem cells using super-resolution live-cell imaging and quantified looping dynamics by Bayesian inference. Unexpectedly, the Fbn2 loop was both rare and dynamic, with a looped fraction of approximately 3 to 6.5% and a median loop lifetime of approximately 10 to 30 minutes. Our results establish that the Fbn2 TAD is highly dynamic, and about 92% of the time, cohesin-extruded loops exist within the TAD without bridging both CTCF boundaries. This suggests that single CTCF boundaries, rather than the fully CTCF-CTCF looped state, may be the primary regulators of functional interactions."

https://openalex.org/W4224084185,"Hydrogels are promising as materials for soft actuators because of qualities such as softness, transparency, and responsiveness to stimuli. However, weak and slow actuations remain challenging as a result of low modulus and osmosis-driven slow water diffusion, respectively. We used turgor pressure and electroosmosis to realize a strong and fast hydrogel-based actuator. A turgor actuator fabricated with a gel confined by a selectively permeable membrane can retain a high osmotic pressure that drives gel swelling; thus, our actuator exerts large stress [0.73 megapascals (MPa) in 96 minutes (min)] with a 1.16 cubic centimeters of hydrogel. With the accelerated water transport caused by electroosmosis, the gel swells rapidly, enhancing the actuation speed (0.79 MPa in 9 min). Our strategies enable a soft hydrogel to break a brick and construct underwater structures within a few minutes."

https://openalex.org/W4223917550,"Gut bacteria influence brain functions and metabolism. We investigated whether this influence can be mediated by direct sensing of bacterial cell wall components by brain neurons. In mice, we found that bacterial peptidoglycan plays a major role in mediating gut-brain communication via the Nod2 receptor. Peptidoglycan-derived muropeptides reach the brain and alter the activity of a subset of brain neurons that express Nod2. Activation of Nod2 in hypothalamic inhibitory neurons is essential for proper appetite and body temperature control, primarily in females. This study identifies a microbe-sensing mechanism that regulates feeding behavior and host metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W4224025319,"The ontogeny of human haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is poorly defined owing to the inability to identify HSCs as they emerge and mature at different haematopoietic sites1. Here we created a single-cell transcriptome map of human haematopoietic tissues from the first trimester to birth and found that the HSC signature RUNX1+HOXA9+MLLT3+MECOM+HLF+SPINK2+ distinguishes HSCs from progenitors throughout gestation. In addition to the aorta–gonad–mesonephros region, nascent HSCs populated the placenta and yolk sac before colonizing the liver at 6 weeks. A comparison of HSCs at different maturation stages revealed the establishment of HSC transcription factor machinery after the emergence of HSCs, whereas their surface phenotype evolved throughout development. The HSC transition to the liver marked a molecular shift evidenced by suppression of surface antigens reflecting nascent HSC identity, and acquisition of the HSC maturity markers CD133 (encoded by PROM1) and HLA-DR. HSC origin was tracked to ALDH1A1+KCNK17+ haemogenic endothelial cells, which arose from an IL33+ALDH1A1+ arterial endothelial subset termed pre-haemogenic endothelial cells. Using spatial transcriptomics and immunofluorescence, we visualized this process in ventrally located intra-aortic haematopoietic clusters. The in vivo map of human HSC ontogeny validated the generation of aorta–gonad–mesonephros-like definitive haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from human pluripotent stem cells, and serves as a guide to improve their maturation to functional HSCs. The HSC signature RUNX1+HOXA9+MLLT3+MECOM+HLF+SPINK2+ distinguishes haematopoietic stem cells from their endothelial precursors and differentiated progenitors throughout ontogeny"
https://openalex.org/W4223979729,"Bulk chemicals such as ethylene glycol (EG) can be industrially synthesized from either ethylene or syngas, but the latter undergoes a bottleneck reaction and requires high hydrogen pressures. We show that fullerene (exemplified by C60) can act as an electron buffer for a copper-silica catalyst (Cu/SiO2). Hydrogenation of dimethyl oxalate over a C60-Cu/SiO2 catalyst at ambient pressure and temperatures of 180° to 190°C had an EG yield of up to 98 ± 1%. In a kilogram-scale reaction, no deactivation of the catalyst was seen after 1000 hours. This mild route for the final step toward EG can be combined with the already-industrialized ambient reaction from syngas to the intermediate of dimethyl oxalate."
https://openalex.org/W3202058913,"Glass is increasingly desired as a material for manufacturing complex microscopic geometries, from the micro-optics in compact consumer products to microfluidic systems for chemical synthesis and biological analyses. As the size, geometric, surface roughness, and mechanical strength requirements of glass evolve, conventional processing methods are challenged. We introduce microscale computed axial lithography (micro-CAL) of fused silica components, by tomographically illuminating a photopolymer-silica nanocomposite that is then sintered. We fabricated three-dimensional microfluidics with internal diameters of 150 micrometers, free-form micro-optical elements with a surface roughness of 6 nanometers, and complex high-strength trusses and lattice structures with minimum feature sizes of 50 micrometers. As a high-speed, layer-free digital light manufacturing process, micro-CAL can process nanocomposites with high solids content and high geometric freedom, enabling new device structures and applications."
https://openalex.org/W4223957982,"Human cells produce thousands of lipids that change during cell differentiation and can vary across individual cells of the same type. However, we are only starting to characterize the function of these cell-to-cell differences in lipid composition. Here, we measured the lipidomes and transcriptomes of individual human dermal fibroblasts by coupling high-resolution mass spectrometry imaging with single-cell transcriptomics. We found that the cell-to-cell variations of specific lipid metabolic pathways contribute to the establishment of cell states involved in the organization of skin architecture. Sphingolipid composition is shown to define fibroblast subpopulations, with sphingolipid metabolic rewiring driving cell-state transitions. Therefore, cell-to-cell lipid heterogeneity affects the determination of cell states, adding a new regulatory component to the self-organization of multicellular systems."

Here we present a large-scale cell transcriptomic atlas that encompasses over 1 million cells from 45 tissues of the adult NHP Macaca fascicularis. This dataset provides a vast annotated resource to study a species phylogenetically close to humans. To demonstrate the utility of the atlas, we have reconstructed the cell-cell interaction networks that drive Wnt signalling across the body, mapped the distribution of receptors and co-receptors for viruses causing human infectious diseases, and intersected our data with human genetic disease orthologues to establish potential clinical associations. Our M. fascicularis cell atlas constitutes an essential reference for future studies in humans and NHPs."
https://openalex.org/W4223893037,"Abstract Adhesion G protein-coupled receptors (aGPCRs) are essential for a variety of physiological processes such as immune responses, organ development, cellular communication, proliferation and homeostasis 1–7 . An intrinsic manner of activation that involves a tethered agonist in the N-terminal region of the receptor has been proposed for the aGPCRs 8,9 , but its molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here we report the G protein-bound structures of ADGRD1 and ADGRF1, which exhibit many unique features with regard to the tethered agonism. The stalk region that proceeds the first transmembrane helix acts as the tethered agonist by forming extensive interactions with the transmembrane domain; these interactions are mostly conserved in ADGRD1 and ADGRF1, suggesting that a common stalk–transmembrane domain interaction pattern is shared by members of the aGPCR family. A similar stalk binding mode is observed in the structure of autoproteolysis-deficient ADGRF1, supporting a cleavage-independent manner of receptor activation. The stalk-induced activation is facilitated by a cascade of inter-helix interaction cores that are conserved in positions but show sequence variability in these two aGPCRs. Furthermore, the intracellular region of ADGRF1 contains a specific lipid-binding site, which proves to be functionally important and may serve as the recognition site for the previously discovered endogenous ADGRF1 ligand synaptamide. These findings highlight the diversity and complexity of the signal transduction mechanisms of the aGPCRs."
https://openalex.org/W4224000725,"HIV-1 infection remains a public health problem with no cure. Anti-retroviral therapy (ART) is effective but requires lifelong drug administration owing to a stable reservoir of latent proviruses integrated into the genome of CD4+ T cells1. Immunotherapy with anti-HIV-1 antibodies has the potential to suppress infection and increase the rate of clearance of infected cells2,3. Here we report on a clinical study in which people living with HIV received seven doses of a combination of two broadly neutralizing antibodies over 20 weeks in the presence or absence of ART. Without pre-screening for antibody sensitivity, 76% (13 out of 17) of the volunteers maintained virologic suppression for at least 20 weeks off ART. Post hoc sensitivity analyses were not predictive of the time to viral rebound. Individuals in whom virus remained suppressed for more than 20 weeks showed rebound viraemia after one of the antibodies reached serum concentrations below 10 µg ml-1. Two of the individuals who received all seven antibody doses maintained suppression after one year. Reservoir analysis performed after six months of antibody therapy revealed changes in the size and composition of the intact proviral reservoir. By contrast, there was no measurable decrease in the defective reservoir in the same individuals. These data suggest that antibody administration affects the HIV-1 reservoir, but additional larger and longer studies will be required to define the precise effect of antibody immunotherapy on the reservoir."
https://openalex.org/W4223901740,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) remain without effective therapies. The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway is a potential therapeutic target, but conflicting interpretations have been proposed for how mTORC1 controls lipid homeostasis. We show that selective inhibition of mTORC1 signaling in mice, through deletion of the RagC/D guanosine triphosphatase-activating protein folliculin (FLCN), promotes activation of transcription factor E3 (TFE3) in the liver without affecting other mTORC1 targets and protects against NAFLD and NASH. Disease protection is mediated by TFE3, which both induces lipid consumption and suppresses anabolic lipogenesis. TFE3 inhibits lipogenesis by suppressing proteolytic processing and activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and by interacting with SREBP-1c on chromatin. Our data reconcile previously conflicting studies and identify selective inhibition of mTORC1 as a potential approach to treat NASH and NAFLD."

https://openalex.org/W4223907742,"Adhesion G-protein-coupled receptors (aGPCRs) are characterized by the presence of auto-proteolysing extracellular regions that are involved in cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions1. Self cleavage within the aGPCR auto-proteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain produces two protomers-N-terminal and C-terminal fragments-that remain non-covalently attached after receptors reach the cell surface1. Upon dissociation of the N-terminal fragment, the C-terminus of the GAIN domain acts as a tethered agonist (TA) peptide to activate the seven-transmembrane domain with a mechanism that has been poorly understood2-5. Here we provide cryo-electron microscopy snapshots of two distinct members of the aGPCR family, GPR56 (also known as ADGRG1) and latrophilin 3 (LPHN3 (also known as ADGRL3)). Low-resolution maps of the receptors in their N-terminal fragment-bound state indicate that the GAIN domain projects flexibly towards the extracellular space, keeping the encrypted TA peptide away from the seven-transmembrane domain. High-resolution structures of GPR56 and LPHN3 in their active, G-protein-coupled states, reveal that after dissociation of the extracellular region, the decrypted TA peptides engage the seven-transmembrane domain core with a notable conservation of interactions that also involve extracellular loop 2. TA binding stabilizes breaks in the middle of transmembrane helices 6 and 7 that facilitate aGPCR coupling and activation of heterotrimeric G proteins. Collectively, these results enable us to propose a general model for aGPCR activation."

https://openalex.org/W4223910513,"It has long been believed that climate shifts during the last 2 million years had a pivotal role in the evolution of our genus Homo1-3. However, given the limited number of representative palaeo-climate datasets from regions of anthropological interest, it has remained challenging to quantify this linkage. Here, we use an unprecedented transient Pleistocene coupled general circulation model simulation in combination with an extensive compilation of fossil and archaeological records to study the spatiotemporal habitat suitability for five hominin species over the past 2 million years. We show that astronomically forced changes in temperature, rainfall and terrestrial net primary production had a major impact on the observed distributions of these species. During the Early Pleistocene, hominins settled primarily in environments with weak orbital-scale climate variability. This behaviour changed substantially after the mid-Pleistocene transition, when archaic humans became global wanderers who adapted to a wide range of spatial climatic gradients. Analysis of the simulated hominin habitat overlap from approximately 300-400 thousand years ago further suggests that antiphased climate disruptions in southern Africa and Eurasia contributed to the evolutionary transformation of Homo heidelbergensis populations into Homo sapiens and Neanderthals, respectively. Our robust numerical simulations of climate-induced habitat changes provide a framework to test hypotheses on our human origin."
https://openalex.org/W4226083267,"Kinetochores assemble onto specialized centromeric CENP-A (centromere protein A) nucleosomes (CENP-A Nuc ) to mediate attachments between chromosomes and the mitotic spindle. We describe cryo–electron microscopy structures of the human inner kinetochore constitutive centromere associated network (CCAN) complex bound to CENP-A Nuc reconstituted onto α-satellite DNA. CCAN forms edge-on contacts with CENP-A Nuc , and a linker DNA segment of the α-satellite repeat emerges from the fully wrapped end of the nucleosome to thread through the central CENP-LN channel that tightly grips the DNA. The CENP-TWSX histone-fold module further augments DNA binding and partially wraps the linker DNA in a manner reminiscent of canonical nucleosomes. Our study suggests that the topological entrapment of the linker DNA by CCAN provides a robust mechanism by which kinetochores withstand both pushing and pulling forces exerted by the mitotic spindle."
https://openalex.org/W4224030188,"Human telomerase is a RNA-protein complex that extends the 3' end of linear chromosomes by synthesizing multiple copies of the telomeric repeat TTAGGG1. Its activity is a determinant of cancer progression, stem cell renewal and cellular aging2-5. Telomerase is recruited to telomeres and activated for telomere repeat synthesis by the telomere shelterin protein TPP16,7. Human telomerase has a bilobal structure with a catalytic core ribonuclear protein and a H and ACA box ribonuclear protein8,9. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of human telomerase catalytic core of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and telomerase RNA (TER (also known as hTR)), and of telomerase with the shelterin protein TPP1. TPP1 forms a structured interface with the TERT-unique telomerase essential N-terminal domain (TEN) and the telomerase RAP motif (TRAP) that are unique to TERT, and conformational dynamics of TEN-TRAP are damped upon TPP1 binding, defining the requirements for recruitment and activation. The structures further reveal that the elements of TERT and TER that are involved in template and telomeric DNA handling-including the TEN domain and the TRAP-thumb helix channel-are largely structurally homologous to those in Tetrahymena telomerase10, and provide unique insights into the mechanism of telomerase activity. The binding site of the telomerase inhibitor BIBR153211,12 overlaps a critical interaction between the TER pseudoknot and the TERT thumb domain. Numerous mutations leading to telomeropathies13,14 are located at the TERT-TER and TEN-TRAP-TPP1 interfaces, highlighting the importance of TER-TERT and TPP1 interactions for telomerase activity, recruitment and as drug targets."
https://openalex.org/W4224128919,"Vacuum pump oil (VPO) is used as a lubricant in pumps of different machines. The rate of heat transport is a fundamental requirement of all phenomena. To enhance the rate of heat transmission and reduce the amount of energy consumed as a result of high temperatures. For this reason, the vacuum pump oil (VPO) is taken as a base fluid and Fe3O4 is the nanoparticles suspended in VPO. That's why, the present study inspected the consequence of Hall current, Joule heating effect and variable thickness on these three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics bidirectional flow of nanoliquid past on a stretchable sheet. Further, the Cattaneo-Christove heat flux and radiation impacts are also considered. The VPO-Fe3O4 nanofluid model is composed of momentum equations in x-direction, y-direction and temperature equations. The leading higher-order non-linear PDEs of the current study have been changed into non-linear ODEs with the implementation of appropriate similarity transformations. The procedure of the homotopy analysis method is hired on the resulting higher-order non-linear ODEs along with boundary conditions for the analytical solution. The significance of distinct flow parameters on the velocities in x-direction, y-direction and temperature profiles of the nanofluid have been encountered and briefly explained in a graphical form. Some important findings of the present modelling are that with the increment of nanoparticles volume fraction the nanofluid velocities in x-direction and y-direction are increased. It is also detected that higher estimations of magnetic field parameter, Prandtl number and thermal relaxation time parameter declined the nanofluid temperature. During this examination of the model, it is found that the Fe3O4-Vacuum pump oil (VPO) nanofluid enhanced the rate of heat transfer. Also, the vacuum pump oil (VPO) has many industrial and engineering applications. The current study will help to improve the rate of heat transmission by taking this into account due to which working machines will do better performance and the loss of useful energy will be decayed. Lastly, the skin friction coefficient and Nusselt number are also illustrated in a tabular form. Some major findings according to the numerical computation of the problem are that the enhancing estimations of magnetic parameter, nanoparticles volume fraction and wall thickness parameter augmented the skin friction coefficient in x-direction and Nusselt number. The reduction in skin friction coefficient of the nanofluid in y-direction is examined for Hall current and shape parameter."

Basic amine nucleophiles in nondirected, electrophilic metal–catalyzed aminations tend to bind to and thereby inhibit metal catalysts. We reasoned that an autoregulatory mechanism coupling the release of amine nucleophiles with catalyst turnover could enable functionalization without inhibiting metal-mediated heterolytic carbon-hydrogen cleavage. Here, we report a palladium(II)-catalyzed allylic carbon-hydrogen amination cross-coupling using this strategy, featuring 48 cyclic and acyclic secondary amines (10 pharmaceutically relevant cores) and 34 terminal olefins (bearing electrophilic functionality) to furnish 81 tertiary allylic amines, including 12 drug compounds and 10 complex drug derivatives, with excellent regio- and stereoselectivity (&gt;20:1 linear:branched, &gt;20:1 E : Z )."
https://openalex.org/W4223911005,"Directing crystal growth into complex morphologies is challenging, as crystals tend to adopt thermodynamically stable morphologies. However, many organisms form crystals with intricate morphologies, as exemplified by coccoliths, microscopic calcite crystal arrays produced by unicellular algae. The complex morphologies of the coccolith crystals were hypothesized to materialize from numerous crystallographic facets, stabilized by fine-tuned interactions between organic molecules and the growing crystals. Using electron tomography, we examined multiple stages of coccolith development in three dimensions. We found that the crystals express only one set of symmetry-related crystallographic facets, which grow differentially to yield highly anisotropic shapes. Morphological chirality arises from positioning the crystals along specific edges of these same facets. Our findings suggest that growth rate manipulations are sufficient to yield complex crystalline morphologies."
https://openalex.org/W4224101119,"Optical confinement (OC) structures the optical field and amplifies light intensity inside atmospheric aerosol particles, with major consequences for sunlight-driven aerosol chemistry. Although theorized, the OC-induced spatial structuring has so far defied experimental observation. Here, x-ray spectromicroscopic imaging complemented by modeling provides direct evidence for OC-induced patterning inside photoactive particles. Single iron(III)-citrate particles were probed using the iron oxidation state as a photochemical marker. Based on these results, we predict an overall acceleration of photochemical reactions by a factor of two to three for most classes of atmospheric aerosol particles. Rotation of free aerosol particles and intraparticle molecular transport generally accelerate the photochemistry. Given the prevalence of OC effects, their influence on aerosol particle photochemistry should be considered by atmospheric models."
https://openalex.org/W4223901821,"Tuft dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons form specialized compartments important for motor learning and performance, yet their computational capabilities remain unclear. Structural-functional mapping of the tuft tree from the motor cortex during motor tasks revealed two morphologically distinct populations of layer 5 pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs) that exhibit specific tuft computational properties. Early bifurcating and large nexus PTNs showed marked tuft functional compartmentalization, representing different motor variable combinations within and between their two tuft hemi-trees. By contrast, late bifurcating and smaller nexus PTNs showed synchronous tuft activation. Dendritic structure and dynamic recruitment of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-spiking mechanism explained the differential compartmentalization patterns. Our findings support a morphologically dependent framework for motor computations, in which independent amplification units can be combinatorically recruited to represent different motor sequences within the same tree."
https://openalex.org/W4223921620,"Prostate cancer that recurs following androgen-deprivation therapy is termed castration-resistant, which is incurable and is marked by reactivation of androgen receptor (AR) signaling. KIF20A, a kinesin with unique structural features, is overexpressed in human castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) compared to androgen-dependent PC and benign tissue. KIF20A has well-described roles in mitotic processes, but it has a less characterized function in vesicle fission and trafficking within Golgi-driven secretory pathways. Stable expression of KIF20A in androgen-dependent PC cells promoted progression to CRPC through the activation of AR signaling in vitro and in vivo. KIF20A expression resulted in the secretion of autocrine factors in the conditioned media that activated AR and caused castration-resistant proliferation of naïve androgen-dependent cells. Pharmacologic disruption of vesicle biogenesis blocked KIF20A-driven castration-resistant proliferation of androgen-dependent PC. KIF20A depletion or treatment with the KIF20A-specific inhibitor, paprotrain, reduced CRPC. These data are the first to establish KIF20A as a driver of CRPC progression through AR activation and as a promising therapeutic target against CRPC."
https://openalex.org/W4223975243,"Localising sounds means having the ability to process auditory cues deriving from the interplay among sound waves, the head and the ears. When auditory cues change because of temporary or permanent hearing loss, sound localization becomes difficult and uncertain. The brain can adapt to altered auditory cues throughout life and multisensory training can promote the relearning of spatial hearing skills. Here, we study the training potentials of sound-oriented motor behaviour to test if a training based on manual actions toward sounds can learning effects that generalize to different auditory spatial tasks. We assessed spatial hearing relearning in normal hearing adults with a plugged ear by using visual virtual reality and body motion tracking. Participants performed two auditory tasks that entail explicit and implicit processing of sound position (head-pointing sound localization and audio-visual attention cueing, respectively), before and after having received a spatial training session in which they identified sound position by reaching to auditory sources nearby. Using a crossover design, the effects of the above-mentioned spatial training were compared to a control condition involving the same physical stimuli, but different task demands (i.e., a non-spatial discrimination of amplitude modulations in the sound). According to our findings, spatial hearing in one-ear plugged participants improved more after reaching to sound trainings rather than in the control condition. Training by reaching also modified head-movement behaviour during listening. Crucially, the improvements observed during training generalize also to a different sound localization task, possibly as a consequence of acquired and novel head-movement strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4224025362,"Animals have evolved mechanisms, such as cell competition, to remove dangerous or nonfunctional cells from a tissue. Tumor necrosis factor signaling can eliminate clonal malignancies from Drosophila imaginal epithelia, but why this pathway is activated in tumor cells but not normal tissue is unknown. We show that the ligand that drives elimination is present in basolateral circulation but remains latent because it is spatially segregated from its apically localized receptor. Polarity defects associated with malignant transformation cause receptor mislocalization, allowing ligand binding and subsequent apoptotic signaling. This process occurs irrespective of the neighboring cells' genotype and is thus distinct from cell competition. Related phenomena at epithelial wound sites are required for efficient repair. This mechanism of polarized compartmentalization of ligand and receptor can generally monitor epithelial integrity to promote tissue homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W4223997148,"Experience-dependent changes in behavior are mediated by long-term functional modifications in brain circuits. Activity-dependent plasticity of synaptic input is a major underlying cellular process. Although we have a detailed understanding of synaptic and dendritic plasticity in vitro, little is known about the functional and plastic properties of active dendrites in behaving animals. Using deep brain two-photon Ca2+ imaging, we investigated how sensory responses in amygdala principal neurons develop upon classical fear conditioning, a form of associative learning. Fear conditioning induced differential plasticity in dendrites and somas regulated by compartment-specific inhibition. Our results indicate that learning-induced plasticity can be uncoupled between soma and dendrites, reflecting distinct synaptic and microcircuit-level mechanisms that increase the computational capacity of amygdala circuits."
https://openalex.org/W4223911362,"Abstract The cytoplasmic phosphatase DUSP6 and its nuclear counterpart DUSP5 are negative regulators of RAS/ERK signalling. Here we use deletion of either Dusp5 or Dusp6 to explore the roles of these phosphatases in a murine model of KRAS G12D -driven pancreatic cancer. By 56-days, loss of either DUSP5 or DUSP6 causes a significant increase in KRAS G12D -driven pancreatic hyperplasia. This is accompanied by increased pancreatic acinar to ductal metaplasia (ADM) and the development of pre-neoplastic pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanINs). In contrast, by 100-days, pancreatic hyperplasia is reversed with significant atrophy of pancreatic tissue and weight loss observed in animals lacking either DUSP5 or DUSP6. On further ageing, Dusp 6 −/− mice display accelerated development of metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), while in Dusp5 −/− animals, although PDAC development is increased this process is attenuated by atrophy of pancreatic acinar tissue and severe weight loss in some animals before cancer could progress. Our data suggest that despite a common target in the ERK MAP kinase, DUSP5 and DUSP6 play partially non-redundant roles in suppressing oncogenic KRAS G12D signalling, thus retarding both tumour initiation and progression. Our data suggest that loss of either DUSP5 or DUSP6, as observed in certain human tumours, including the pancreas, could promote carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4224020513,"During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the United Kingdom experienced one of the highest per-capita death tolls worldwide. It is debated whether this may partly be explained by the relatively late initiation of voluntary social distancing and mandatory lockdown measures. In this study, we used simulations to estimate the number of cases and deaths that would have occurred in England by 1 June 2020 if these interventions had been implemented one or two weeks earlier, and the impact on the required duration of lockdown.Using official reported data on the number of Pillar 1 lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 and associated deaths occurring in England from 3 March to 1 June, we modelled: the natural (i.e. observed) growth of cases, and the counterfactual (i.e. hypothetical) growth of cases that would have occurred had measures been implemented one or two weeks earlier. Under each counterfactual condition, we estimated the expected number of deaths and the time required to reach the incidence observed under natural growth on 1 June.Introducing measures one week earlier would have reduced by 74% the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in England by 1 June, resulting in approximately 21,000 fewer hospital deaths and 34,000 fewer total deaths; the required time spent in full lockdown could also have been halved, from 69 to 35 days. Acting two weeks earlier would have reduced cases by 93%, resulting in between 26,000 and 43,000 fewer deaths.Our modelling supports the claim that the relatively late introduction of social distancing and lockdown measures likely increased the scale, severity, and duration of the first wave of COVID-19 in England. Our results highlight the importance of acting swiftly to minimise the spread of an infectious disease when case numbers are increasing exponentially."
https://openalex.org/W4224022664,"Mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with persistent sleep-wake dysfunction, including insomnia and circadian rhythm disruption, which can exacerbate functional outcomes including mood, pain, and quality of life. Present therapies to treat sleep-wake disturbances in those with TBI (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia) are limited by marginal efficacy, poor patient acceptability, and/or high patient/provider burden. Thus, this study aimed to assess the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of morning bright light therapy, to improve sleep in Veterans with TBI (NCT03578003). Thirty-three Veterans with history of TBI were prospectively enrolled in a single-arm, open-label intervention using a lightbox (~10,000 lux at the eye) for 60-minutes every morning for 4-weeks. Pre- and post-intervention outcomes included questionnaires related to sleep, mood, TBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and pain; wrist actigraphy as a proxy for objective sleep; and blood-based biomarkers related to TBI/sleep. The protocol was rated favorably by ~75% of participants, with adherence to the lightbox and actigraphy being ~87% and 97%, respectively. Post-intervention improvements were observed in self-reported symptoms related to insomnia, mood, and pain; actigraphy-derived measures of sleep; and blood-based biomarkers related to peripheral inflammatory balance. The severity of comorbid PTSD was a significant positive predictor of response to treatment. Morning bright light therapy is a feasible and acceptable intervention that shows preliminary efficacy to treat disrupted sleep in Veterans with TBI. A full-scale randomized, placebo-controlled study with longitudinal follow-up is warranted to assess the efficacy of morning bright light therapy to improve sleep, biomarkers, and other TBI related symptoms."

https://openalex.org/W4224141073,"Verification of clonal identity of hop (Humulus lupulus L.) cultivars within breeding programs and germplasm collections is vital to conserving genetic resources. Accurate and economic DNA-based tools are needed in dioecious hop to confirm identity and parentage, neither of which can be reliably determined from morphological observations. In this study, we developed two fingerprinting sets for hop: a 9-SSR fingerprinting set containing high-core repeats that can be run in a single PCR reaction and a kompetitive allele specific PCR (KASP) assay of 25 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The SSR set contains a sex-linked primer pair, HI-AGA7, that was used to genotype 629 hop accessions from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Clonal Germplasm Repository (NCGR), the USDA Forage Seed and Cereal Research (FSCR), and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) collections. The SSR set identified unique genotypes except for 89 sets of synonymous samples. These synonyms included: cultivars with different designations, the same cultivars from different sources, heat-treated clones, and clonal variants. Population structure analysis clustered accessions into wild North American (WNA) and cultivated groups. Diversity was slightly higher in the cultivated samples due to larger sample size. Parentage and sib-ship analyses were used to identify true-to-type cultivars. The HI-AGA7 marker generated two male- and nine female-specific alleles among the cultivated and WNA samples. The SSR and KASP fingerprinting sets were compared in 190 samples consisting of cultivated and WNA accession for their ability to confirm identity and assess diversity and population structure. The SSR fingerprinting set distinguished cultivars, selections and WNA accessions while the KASP assays were unable to distinguish the WNA samples and had lower diversity estimates than the SSR set. Both fingerprinting sets are valuable tools for identity confirmation and parentage analysis in hop for different purposes. The 9-SSR assay is cost efficient when genotyping a small number of wild and cultivated hop samples (<96) while the KASP assay is easy to interpret and cost efficient for genotyping a large number of cultivated samples (multiples of 96)."

https://openalex.org/W4224041312,"Phosphorus (P) is an essential element for crop production and a key source of nonpoint pollution in agroecosystems. In this study, we sought to analyze P levels and the factors affecting soil P availability, via P adsorption, in a typical field system that is characterized by the year-round cultivation of vegetables. A total of 190 sites were sampled from vegetable fields in Guangdong Province, South China. Within the research area, average concentrations of 124.49 mg P kg-1 and 1.55 g P kg-1 were recorded for available P (AP) and total P (TP), respectively, which are 8.53- and 1.78-fold higher, respectively, than the corresponding values recorded in 1980. The determined P adsorption maximum (Qm) averaged at 488.38 mg kg-1, which represents a reduction of 16% compared to the values obtained four decades ago. Accumulations of both TP and AP were found to be negatively correlated with the soil's maximum adsorption buffering capacity (MBC), although no significant correlations with the soil binding energies (k) and Qm, were seen. However, soil pH was found to be significantly correlated with k and Qm. Furthermore, both free Mn oxides (Mnd) and silt concentrations in the soil were found to contribute to explaining the variations in Qm. Collectively, the findings of this study provide evidence to indicate that there has been an excessive accumulation of P in the perennial vegetable fields of Guangdong Province over the past four decades, which may have had negative effects on the P supply potential of the soil by reducing the maximum adsorption buffering capacity."
https://openalex.org/W4225987389,"Global changes may direct species expansion away from their current range. When such an expansion occurs, and the species colonizes a new region, it is important to monitor the habitat used by the species and utilize the information to updated management strategies. Water deer (Hydropotes inermis) is listed as Vulnerable species in IUCN Red List and is restricted to east central China and the Korean Peninsula. Since 2017, water deer has expanded its range towards northeast China and the Russian Far East. The objective of our study is to provide support for a better understanding of habitat use and provide suggestions for developing conservation strategy. We collected occurrence data in northeast China and the Russian Far East during 2017-2021. We used MaxEnt to predict habitat suitability for water deer and applied Circuitscape to determine possible dispersal routes for the species. We used seven environmental variables, viz., altitude, slope, aspect, distance to built-up area, distance to water source, distance to cropland and distance to roads for habitat suitability prediction. We chose the MaxEnt model (AICc = 2572.86) suitable for our data with the AUC value result of 0.935±0.014. There is good quality habitat for water deer in the boundary area of the Yalu and Tumen River estuaries between China, North Korea, and the Russian Far East, as well as the east and west regions of the Korean Peninsula. We identified three main suitable habitat patches, two of them located in east (NK2) and west (NK3) North Korea, and one in the newly colonized area downstream of the Tumen River along the border of China, Russia, and North Korea (TM1). Elevation, distance to cropland and water sources, and presence of wetlands were the variables that positively contributed to modelling the suitable habitats. Two possible dispersal routes were determined using the circuit theory, one was across the area from North Korea to the downstream Tumen transboundary region (Route B), and the other was across North Korea to the boundary region in China and along the tiger national park in northern China (Route A). A series of protected areas in North Korea, China, and Russia may support the dispersal of water deer. From the study on water deer dispersal, we can understand the existing ecological network in northeast Asia, which will benefit the whole landscape and biodiversity conservation. However, there are many threats present, and there is need for continued monitoring inside and outside the protected areas. Information sharing with stakeholders and carrying out local communities awareness activities are important. The establishment of a Northeast Asia landscape conservation network would help establish monitoring and conservation planning at a broad scale, and this study provides an example of the need for such a network."
https://openalex.org/W4224007468,"Theobroma cacao L. is a commercially important food/beverage and is used as traditional medicine worldwide against a variety of ailments. In the present study, computational biology approaches were implemented to elucidate the possible role of cocoa in cancer therapy. Bioactives of cocoa were retrieved from the PubChem database and queried for targets involved in cancer pathogenesis using BindingDB (similarity index ≥0.7). Later, the protein-protein interactions network was investigated using STRING and compound-protein via Cytoscape. In addition, intermolecular interactions were investigated via molecular docking. Also, the stability of the representative complex Hirsutrin-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) complex was explored using molecular dynamics simulations. Crude extract metabolite profile was carried out by LC-MS. Further, anti-oxidant and cytotoxicity studies were performed in Chinese hamster ovary (normal) and Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (cancer) cell lines. Herein, the gene set enrichment and network analysis revealed 34 bioactives in cocoa targeting 50 proteins regulating 21 pathways involved in cancer and oxidative stress in humans. EGFR scored the highest edge count amongst 50 targets modulating 21 key pathways. Hence, it was selected as a promising anticancer target in this study. Structural refinement of EGFR was performed via all-atom molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent. A complex EGFR-Hirsutrin showed the least binding energy (-7.2 kcal/mol) and conserved non-bonded contacts with binding pocket residues. A stable complex formation of EGFR-Hirsutrin was observed during 100 ns MD simulation. In vitro studies corroborated antioxidant activity for cocoa extract and showed a significantly higher cytotoxic effect on cancer cells compared to normal cells. Our study virtually predicts anti-cancer activity for cocoa affected by hirsutrin inhibiting EGFR. Further wet-lab studies are needed to establish cocoa extract against cancer and oxidative stress."

https://openalex.org/W4223950818,"The purpose of this study was to examine relationships among instructor autonomy support for student learning, and students' motivational characteristics, learning approaches, perceptions of career competence and life satisfaction. Participated 1048 students from Spanish universities with ages between 18, and 57 years. A Structural equation modeling revealed a relationship between instructor autonomy support for student learning with students' basic psychological need satisfaction. As a result, students' basic need satisfaction was related to their intrinsic motivation, and to a deeper learning approach. These educational outcomes contributed to explain students'perceived professional competence, and life satisfaction. These findings highlight the importance of student choice, and decision-making in the learning process as a means to facilitating deeper learning, stronger feelings of professional competence, and enhanced well-being."

https://openalex.org/W4225524790,"Phylogenetic profiling in eukaryotes is of continued interest to study and predict the functional relationships between proteins. This interest is likely driven by the increased number of available diverse genomes and computational methods to infer orthologies. The evaluation of phylogenetic profiles has mainly focussed on reference genome selection in prokaryotes. However, it has been proven to be challenging to obtain high prediction accuracies in eukaryotes. As part of our recent comparison of orthology inference methods for eukaryotic genomes, we observed a surprisingly high performance for predicting interacting orthologous groups. This high performance, in turn, prompted the question of what factors influence the success of phylogenetic profiling when applied to eukaryotic genomes. Here we analyse the effect of species, orthologous group and interactome selection on protein interaction prediction using phylogenetic profiles. We select species based on the diversity and quality of the genomes and compare this supervised selection with randomly generated genome subsets. We also analyse the effect on the performance of orthologous groups defined to be in the last eukaryotic common ancestor of eukaryotes to that of orthologous groups that are not. Finally, we consider the effects of reference interactome set filtering and reference interactome species. In agreement with other studies, we find an effect of genome selection based on quality, less of an effect based on genome diversity, but a more notable effect based on the amount of information contained within the genomes. Most importantly, we find it is not merely selecting the correct genomes that is important for high prediction performance. Other choices in meta parameters such as orthologous group selection, the reference species of the interaction set, and the quality of the interaction set have a much larger impact on the performance when predicting protein interactions using phylogenetic profiles. These findings shed light on the differences in reported performance amongst phylogenetic profiles approaches, and reveal on a more fundamental level for which types of protein interactions this method has most promise when applied to eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W4226251160,"The aim of the present study was to assess the microbial quality of five ready-to-eat food such as bread, pasta, rice with sauce, beans and milk sold in five localities of Burkina Faso namely, Ouagadougou, Bobo-Dioulasso, Dakola, Cinkansé and Niangoloko. One hundred and one samples were collected and microbial quality were assessed by evaluating the food hygiene indicators such as total aerobic mesophilic flora, total coliforms, thermotolerant coliforms, yeast and mould. Food safety indicators such as Escherichia coli , Salmonella , coagulase-positive staphylococci, Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus cereus were also tested for contamination. Samples were tested according to ISO guidelines for all parameters. The results showed that 74 (73.27%) of samples were satisfactory while 15 (14.85%) were acceptable and 12 (11.88%) were not satisfactory according to international standards. Among the food safety indicators sought, Escherichia coli was detected in two samples and Bacillus cereus in four samples. Most of the analyzed food exhibited good hygiene behavior within the acceptable limits and the highest of not satisfactory rate was observed in milk powder and rice with sauce. Ouagadougou samples recorded the highest number of not satisfactory samples. Despite the general quality was satisfactory, the presence of specific microorganisms such as coliforms is indicative of the poor hygiene surrounded these foods. It is therefore necessary to train and follow up the vendors in the handling of equipment, hand-washing practices and selling environment hygiene for better improvement of the quality of the street foods."
