https://openalex.org/W2885548680,"Mass production of plastics started nearly 70 years ago and the production rate is expected to double over the next two decades. While serving many applications because of their durability, stability and low cost, plastics have deleterious effects on the environment. Plastic is known to release a variety of chemicals during degradation, which has a negative impact on biota. Here, we show that the most commonly used plastics produce two greenhouse gases, methane and ethylene, when exposed to ambient solar radiation. Polyethylene, which is the most produced and discarded synthetic polymer globally, is the most prolific emitter of both gases. We demonstrate that the production of trace gases from virgin low-density polyethylene increase with time, with rates at the end of a 212-day incubation of 5.8 nmol g-1 d-1 of methane, 14.5 nmol g-1 d-1 of ethylene, 3.9 nmol g-1 d-1 of ethane and 9.7 nmol g-1 d-1 of propylene. Environmentally aged plastics incubated in water for at least 152 days also produced hydrocarbon gases. In addition, low-density polyethylene emits these gases when incubated in air at rates ~2 times and ~76 times higher than when incubated in water for methane and ethylene, respectively. Our results show that plastics represent a heretofore unrecognized source of climate-relevant trace gases that are expected to increase as more plastic is produced and accumulated in the environment."
https://openalex.org/W2772971659,"Color vision deficiency (CVD) affects more than 4% of the population and leads to a different visual perception of colors. Though this has been known for decades, colormaps with many colors across the visual spectra are often used to represent data, leading to the potential for misinterpretation or difficulty with interpretation by someone with this deficiency. Until the creation of the module presented here, there were no colormaps mathematically optimized for CVD using modern color appearance models. While there have been some attempts to make aesthetically pleasing or subjectively tolerable colormaps for those with CVD, our goal was to make optimized colormaps for the most accurate perception of scientific data by as many viewers as possible. We developed a Python module, cmaputil, to create CVD-optimized colormaps, which imports colormaps and modifies them to be perceptually uniform in CVD-safe colorspace while linearizing and maximizing the brightness range. The module is made available to the science community to enable others to easily create their own CVD-optimized colormaps. Here, we present an example CVD-optimized colormap created with this module that is optimized for viewing by those without a CVD as well as those with red-green colorblindness. This colormap, cividis, enables nearly-identical visual-data interpretation to both groups, is perceptually uniform in hue and brightness, and increases in brightness linearly."
https://openalex.org/W2887077357,"Past research in HCI has generated a number of procedures for assessing the usability of interacting systems. In these procedures there is a tendency to omit characteristics of the users, aspects of the context and peculiarities of the tasks. Building a cohesive model that incorporates these features is not obvious. A construct greatly invoked in Human Factors is human Mental Workload. Its assessment is fundamental for predicting human performance. Despite the several uses of Usability and Mental Workload, not much has been done to explore their relationship. This empirical research focused on I) the investigation of such a relationship and II) the investigation of the impact of the two constructs on human performance. A user study was carried out with participants executing a set of information-seeking tasks over three popular web-sites. A deep correlation analysis of usability and mental workload, by task, by user and by classes of objective task performance was done (I). A number of Supervised Machine Learning techniques based upon different learning strategy were employed for building models aimed at predicting classes of task performance (II). Findings strongly suggests that usability and mental workload are two non overlapping constructs and they can be jointly employed to greatly improve the prediction of human performance."
https://openalex.org/W2885404562,"Climate change has the potential to enhance or disrupt biological systems, but currently, little is known about how organism plasticity may facilitate adaptation to localised climate variation. The bee-flower relationship is an exemplar signal-receiver system that may provide important insights into the complexity of ecological interactions in situations like this. For example, several studies on bee temperature preferences show that bees prefer to collect warm nectar from flowers at low ambient temperatures, but switch their preferences to cooler flowers at ambient temperatures above about 30° C. We used temperature sensor thermal probes to measure the temperature of outdoor flowers of 30 plant species in the Southern regions of the Australian mainland, to understand how different species could modulate petal temperature in response to changes in ambient temperature and, potentially, influence the decision-making of bees in the flowering plant’s favour. We found that flower petal temperatures respond in different ways to changing ambient temperature: linearly increasing or decreasing relative to the ambient temperature, dynamically changing in a non-linear manner, or varying their temperature along with the ambient conditions. For example, our investigation of the difference between ambient temperature and petal temperature (ΔT), and ambient temperature, revealed a non-linear relationship for Erysimum linifolium and Polygala grandiflora that seems suited to bee temperature preferences. The temperature profiles of species like Hibertia vestita and H. obtusifolia appear to indicate that they do not have a cooling mechanism. These species may therefore be less attractive to bee pollinators in changing climatic conditions with ambient temperatures increasingly above 30° C. This may be to the species’ detriment when insect-pollinator mediated selection is considered. However, we found no evidence that flower visual characteristics used by bees to identify flowers at close range, such as colour or shape, were straightforward modulators of floral temperature. We could not identify any clear link to phylogenetic history and temperature modulation either. Mapping our test flower distribution on the Australian continent however, indicates a potential clustering that suggests different flower responses may constitute adaptations to local conditions. Our study proposes a framework for modelling the potential effects of climate change and floral temperature on flower pollination dynamics at local and global scales."
https://openalex.org/W2886025481,"Objective To investigate the distribution of Mycobacterium tuberculosis genotypes across Africa. Methods The SITVIT2 global repository and PUBMED were searched for spoligotype and published genotype data respectively, of M. tuberculosis from Africa. M. tuberculosis lineages in Africa were described and compared across regions and with those from 7 European and 6 South-Asian countries. Further analysis of the major lineages and sub-lineages using Principal Component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis were done to describe clustering by geographical regions. Evolutionary relationships were assessed using phylogenetic tree analysis. Results A total of 14727 isolates from 35 African countries were included in the analysis and of these 13607 were assigned to one of 10 major lineages, whilst 1120 were unknown. There were differences in geographical distribution of major lineages and their sub-lineages with regional clustering. Southern African countries were grouped based on high prevalence of LAM11-ZWE strains; strains which have an origin in Portugal. The grouping of North African countries was due to the high percentage of LAM9 strains, which have an origin in the Eastern Mediterranean region. East African countries were grouped based on Central Asian (CAS) and East-African Indian (EAI) strain lineage possibly reflecting historic sea trade with Asia, while West African Countries were grouped based on Cameroon lineage of unknown origin. A high percentage of the Haarlem lineage isolates were observed in the Central African Republic, Guinea, Gambia and Tunisia, however, a mixed distribution prevented close clustering. Conclusions This study highlighted that the TB epidemic in Africa is driven by regional epidemics characterized by genetically distinct lineages of M. tuberculosis. M. tuberculosis in these regions may have been introduced from either Europe or Asia and has spread through pastoralism, mining and war. The vast array of genotypes and their associated phenotypes should be considered when designing future vaccines, diagnostics and anti-TB drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2886149300,"Phoneutria nigriventer is one of the largest existing true spiders and one of the few considered medically relevant. Its venom contains several neurotoxic peptides that act on different ion channels and chemical receptors of vertebrates and invertebrates. Some of these venom toxins have been shown as promising models for pharmaceutical or biotechnological use. However, the large diversity and the predominance of low molecular weight toxins in this venom have hampered the identification and deep investigation of the less abundant toxins and the proteins with high molecular weight. Here, we combined conventional and next-generation cDNA sequencing with Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology (MudPIT), to obtain an in-depth panorama of the composition of P. nigriventer spider venom. The results from these three approaches showed that cysteine-rich peptide toxins are the most abundant components in this venom and most of them contain the Inhibitor Cysteine Knot (ICK) structural motif. Ninety-eight sequences corresponding to cysteine-rich peptide toxins were identified by the three methodologies and many of them were considered as putative novel toxins, due to the low similarity to previously described toxins. Furthermore, using next-generation sequencing we identified families of several other classes of toxins, including CAPs (Cysteine Rich Secretory Protein—CRiSP, antigen 5 and Pathogenesis-Related 1—PR-1), serine proteinases, TCTPs (translationally controlled tumor proteins), proteinase inhibitors, metalloproteinases and hyaluronidases, which have been poorly described for this venom. This study provides an overview of the molecular diversity of P. nigriventer venom, revealing several novel components and providing a better basis to understand its toxicity and pharmacological activities."
https://openalex.org/W2886735273,"Commensal gastrointestinal bacteria resist the expansion of pathogens and are lost during critical illness, facilitating pathogen colonization and infection. We performed a prospective, ICU-based study to determine risk factors for loss of gut colonization resistance during the initial period of critical illness. Rectal swabs were taken from adult ICU patients within 4 hours of admission and 72 hours later, and analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and selective culture for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). Microbiome data was visualized using principal coordinate analyses (PCoA) and assessed using a linear discriminant analysis algorithm and logistic regression modeling. 93 ICU patients were analyzed. At 72 hours following ICU admission, there was a significant decrease in the proportion of Clostridial Clusters IV/XIVa, taxa that produce short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). At the same time, there was a significant expansion in Enterococcus. Decreases in Cluster IV/XIVa Clostridia were associated with loss of gut microbiome colonization resistance (reduced diversity and community stability over time). In multivariable analysis, both decreased Cluster IV/XIVa Clostridia and increased Enterococcus after 72 hours were associated with receipt of antibiotics. Cluster IV/XIVa Clostridia, although a small fraction of the overall gastrointestinal microbiome, drove distinct clustering on PCoA. During initial treatment for critical illness, there was a loss of Cluster IV/XIVa Clostridia within the distal gut microbiome which associated with an expansion of VRE and with a loss of gut microbiome colonization resistance. Receipt of broad-spectrum antibiotics was associated with these changes."
https://openalex.org/W2887135349,"Both deep understanding and reliable prediction of postoperative soft tissue changes are crucial for planning orthognathic surgery. Instead of estimating soft tissue responses by measuring individual landmark changes, this study aimed to investigate the relationship (ratio) between soft and hard tissue movements in different facial regions through three-dimensional cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Preoperative and postoperative CBCT images were superimposed using the surface registration method on the basis of the cranial base, and 10 facial regions of interest were defined. Region-based volumetric subtractions between the preoperative and postoperative segments were performed. The volumetric differences and surface of each region were used to estimate the average movement. Correlation and regression analyses were performed to examine the relationships between the corresponding soft and hard tissue movements. An overall pattern of facial soft tissue movement was observed in patients with prognathism who underwent orthognathic surgery. The experiment results have shown that mean ratios for the average soft-to-hard tissue movements in the facial regions varied, which may not exactly be similar to the published reports because of the population biocharacteristics and study methods, but the trend is in agreement with the previous studies. Additionally, the prediction capability of the regression model was significantly high, ranging from 0.786 to 0.857, in upper lip, upper vermilion, and chin regions, thus demonstrating that the skin outline changes in these critical regions could be reliably predicted from the underlying bone movements. These results could likely be applied in future soft tissue simulation in orthognathic surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2886412256,"Membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), a membrane-tethered protease, is key for matrix breakdown during cancer invasion and metastasis. Assembly of branched actin networks by the Arp2/3 complex is required for MT1-MMP traffic and formation of matrix-degradative invadopodia. Contrasting with the well-established role of actin filament branching factor cortactin in invadopodia function during cancer cell invasion, the contribution of coronin-family debranching factors to invadopodia-based matrix remodeling is not known. Here, we investigated the contribution of coronin 1C to the invasive potential of breast cancer cells. We report that expression of coronin 1C is elevated in invasive human breast cancers, correlates positively with MT1-MMP expression in relation with increased metastatic risk and is a new independent prognostic factor in breast cancer. We provide evidence that, akin to cortactin, coronin 1C is required for invadopodia formation and matrix degradation by breast cancer cells lines and for 3D collagen invasion by multicellular spheroids. Using intravital imaging of orthotopic human breast tumor xenografts, we find that coronin 1C accumulates in structures forming in association with collagen fibrils in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, we establish the role of coronin 1C in the regulation of positioning and trafficking of MT1-MMP-positive endolysosomes. These results identify coronin 1C as a novel player of the multi-faceted mechanism responsible for invadopodia formation, MT1-MMP surface exposure and invasiveness in breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2887252814,"Pain recognition is fundamental for safeguarding animal welfare. Facial expressions have been investigated in several species and grimace scales have been developed as pain assessment tool in many species including horses (HGS) and mice (MGS). This study is intended to progress the validation of grimace scales, by proposing a statistical approach to identify a classifier that can estimate the pain status of the animal based on Facial Action Units (FAUs) included in HGS and MGS. To achieve this aim, through a validity study, the relation between FAUs included in HGS and MGS and the real pain condition was investigated. A specific statistical approach (Cumulative Link Mixed Model, Inter-rater reliability, Multiple Correspondence Analysis, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Support Vector Machines) was applied to two datasets. Our results confirm the reliability of both scales and show that individual FAU scores of HGS and MGS are related to the pain state of the animal. Finally, we identified the optimal weights of the FAU scores that can be used to best classify animals in pain with an accuracy greater than 70%. For the first time, this study describes a statistical approach to develop a classifier, based on HGS and MGS, for estimating the pain status of animals. The classifier proposed is the starting point to develop a computer-based image analysis for the automatic recognition of pain in horses and mice."
https://openalex.org/W2887933453,"Background World Health Organization (WHO) recommends systematic screening of high-risk populations, including household contacts (HHCs) of adult pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) patients, as a key strategy for elimination of TB. QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) assay and tuberculin skin test (TST) are two commonly used tools for the detection of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) but may yield differential results, affecting eligibility for TB preventive therapy. Materials and methods A prospective cohort study of adult pulmonary TB patients and their HHCs were recruited in 2 cities of India, Pune and Chennai. HHCs underwent QFT-GIT (QIAGEN) and TST (PPD SPAN 2TU/5TU). A positive QFT-GIT was defined as value ≥0.35 IU/ml and a positive TST as an induration of ≥5 mm. A secondary outcome of TST induration ≥10mm was explored. Proportion positive by either or both assays, discordant positives and negatives were calculated; test concordance was assessed using percentage agreement and kappa statistics; and risk factors for concordance and discordance including age categories were assessed using logistic regression. Sensitivity and specificity was estimated by latent class model. Results Of 1048 HHCs enrolled, 869 [median (IQR) age: 27 years (15–40)] had both TST and QFT-GIT results available and prevalence of LTBI by QFT-GIT was 54% [95% CI (51, 57)], by TST was 55% [95% CI (52, 58)], by either test was 74% [95% CI (71, 77) and by both tests was 35% [95% CI (31, 38)]. Discordance of TST+/QFT-GIT- was 21% while TST-/QFT-GIT+ was 26%. Poor to fair agreement occurred with TST 5mm or 10mm cutoff (60 and 61% agreement with kappa value of 0.20 and 0.25 respectively). Test agreement varied by age, TST strength and induration cut-off. In multivariate analysis, span PPD was a risk factor for QFT-GIT+ and TST- while absence of BCG scar was for TST+ and QFT-GIT-. Being employed and exposure to TB case outside the household case were associated with positivity by both the tests. Sensitivity of TST and QFT-GIT to diagnose LTBI was 77% and 69%. Probability of having LTBI was >90% when both tests were positive irrespective of exposure gradient. Conclusion Prevalence of LTBI among HHCs of adult pulmonary TB patients in India is very high and varies by test type, age, and exposure gradient. In our high TB burden setting, a strategy to treat all HHCs or a targeted strategy whereby an exposure index is used should be assessed in future preventive therapy and vaccine studies as HHCs have several factors that place them at high risk for progression to TB disease."
https://openalex.org/W2887905019,"Europe recently experienced a large influx of refugees, spurring much public debate about the admission and integration of refugees and migrants into society. Previous research based on cross-sectional data found that European citizens generally favour asylum seekers with high employability, severe vulnerabilities, and Christians over Muslims. These preferences and attitudes were found to be homogeneous across countries and socio-demographic groups. Here, we do not study the general acceptance of asylum seekers, but the acceptance of refugee and migrant homes in citizens' vicinity and how it changes over time. Based on a repeated stated choice experiment on preferences for refugee and migrant homes, we show that the initially promoted ""welcome culture"" towards refugees in Germany was not reflected in the views of a majority of a sample of German citizens who rather disapproved refugee homes in their vicinity. Their preferences have not changed between November 2015, the peak of ""welcome culture,"" and November 2016, after political debates, media reporting and public discourse had shifted towards limiting admission of immigrants. A minority of one fifth of the sample population, who were initially rather approving of refugee and migrant homes being established in their vicinity, were more likely to change their preferences towards a rather disapproving position in 2016. Experience of contact with refugees and migrants, higher education, and general pro-immigration attitudes explain acceptance of refugee and migrant homes as well as preference stability over time. Country of origin and religion of refugees and migrants are considered less important than decent housing conditions and whether refugee and migrants arrive as families or single persons. In this respect our results highlight the importance of humanitarian aspects of sheltering and integration of refugees and other migrants into society."
https://openalex.org/W2887929549,"Wildlife-focused tourism is often considered as having the potential to play an integral part of threatened species conservation efforts, particularly through financial support. We focused on the direct financing of conservation by investigating tourists' willingness to pay to snorkel with reef manta rays (Mobula alfredi) at Barefoot Manta, an ecotourism resort in the Yasawa group of islands in Fiji. Our results indicate that 82.4% of people surveyed would be willing to pay a mean value of ~ USD $9.2 (SE 0.9) more than the current cost, a 28% increase. Also, 89% of people surveyed would be willing to pay a mean value of ~ USD $10.2 (SE 0.9) more for a hypothetical scenario where they would snorkel with 50% fewer people, a 31% increase. We also investigated tourists' willingness to make voluntary donations to the local community above an existing payment of ~ USD $10 that is built into the current snorkel payment of ~ USD $32.5. On average, 91.3% of the tourists interviewed were willing to donate additional funds with an average additional donation of ~ USD $8.6 (SE 0.5) to the community to pay for educational and environmental support, an 86% increase. There were few significant relationships between willingness to pay and demographic factors (including age, income, nationality, education, and others), suggesting that willingness to pay was widely held by the tourist population staying at Barefoot Manta Resort. Together, these results indicate that wildlife-based nature tourism could represent a potential, but not unlimited, income source to fund conservation in the Yasawa group, Fiji islands, and that conservation can arise from partnerships between local communities and the tourism sector."
https://openalex.org/W2885058527,"Cerrado is the second largest biome in South America and accounted for the second largest contribution to carbon emissions in Brazil for the last 10 years, mainly due to land-use changes. It comprises approximately 2 million km2 and is divided into 22 ecoregions, based on environmental conditions and vegetation. The most dominant vegetation type is cerrado sensu stricto (cerrado ss), a savanna woodland. Quantifying variation of biomass density of this vegetation is crucial for climate change mitigation policies. Integrating remote sensing data with adequate allometric equations and field-based data sets can provide large-scale estimates of biomass. We developed individual-tree aboveground biomass (AGB) allometric models to compare different regression techniques and explanatory variables. We applied the model with the strongest fit to a comprehensive ground-based data set (77 sites, 893 plots, and 95,484 trees) to describe AGB density variation of cerrado ss. We also investigated the influence of physiographic and climatological variables on AGB density; this analysis was restricted to 68 sites because eight sites could not be classified into a specific ecoregion, and one site had no soil texture data. In addition, we developed two models to estimate plot AGB density based on plot basal area. Our data show that for individual-tree AGB models a) log-log linear models provided better estimates than nonlinear power models; b) including species as a random effect improved model fit; c) diameter at 30 cm above ground was a reliable predictor for individual-tree AGB, and although height significantly improved model fit, species wood density did not. Mean tree AGB density in cerrado ss was 22.9 tons ha-1 (95% confidence interval = ± 2.2) and varied widely between ecoregions (8.8 to 42.2 tons ha-1), within ecoregions (e.g. 4.8 to 39.5 tons ha-1), and even within sites (24.3 to 69.9 tons ha-1). Biomass density tended to be higher in sites close to the Amazon. Ecoregion explained 42% of biomass variation between the 68 sites (P < 0.01) and shows strong potential as a parameter for classifying regional biomass variation in the Cerrado."
https://openalex.org/W2885662967,"Duvelisib is an orally active dual inhibitor of PI3K-δ and PI3K-γ in clinical development in hematologic malignancies (HM). To identify novel pairings for duvelisib in HM, it was evaluated alone and in combination with 35 compounds comprising a diverse panel of standard-of-care agents and emerging drugs in development for HM. These compounds were tested in 20 cell lines including diffuse large B-cell, follicular, T-cell, and mantle cell lymphomas, and multiple myeloma. Single agent activity was seen in fourteen cell lines, with a median GI50 of 0.59 μM. A scalar measure of the strength of synergistic drug interactions revealed a synergy hit rate of 19.3% across the matrix of drug combinations and cell lines. Synergy with duvelisib was prominent in lymphoma lines with approved and emerging drugs used to treat HM, including dexamethasone, ibrutinib, and the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax. Western blotting revealed that certain duvelisib-treated cell lines showed inhibition of phosphorylated (p) AKT at serine 473 only out to 12 hours, with mTORC2 dependent re-phosphorylation of pAKT evident at 24 hours. Combination with dexamethasone or ibrutinib, however, prevented this reactivation leading to durable inhibition of pAKT. The combination treatments also inhibited downstream signaling effectors pPRAS40 and pS6. The combination of duvelisib with dexamethasone also significantly reduced p-4EBP1, which controls cap dependent translation initiation, leading to decreased levels of c-MYC 6 hours after treatment. In support of the in vitro studies, in vivo xenograft studies revealed that duvelisib in combination with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus led to greater tumor growth inhibition compared to single agent administration. These data provide a rationale for exploring multiple combinations in the clinic and suggest that suppression of mTOR-driven survival signaling may be one important mechanism for combination synergy."
https://openalex.org/W2886068061,"Efforts to detect patient deterioration early have led to the development of early warning score (EWS) models. However, these models are disease-nonspecific and have shown variable accuracy in predicting unexpected critical events. Here, we propose a simpler and more accurate method for predicting risk in respiratory ward patients. This retrospective study analyzed adult patients who were admitted to the respiratory ward and detected using the rapid response system (RRS). Study outcomes included transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) within 24 hours after RRS activation and in-hospital mortality. Prediction power of existing EWS models including Modified EWS (MEWS), National EWS (NEWS), and VitalPAC EWS (ViEWS) and SpO2/FiO2 (SF) ratio were compared to each other using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Overall, 456 patients were included; median age was 75 years (interquartile range: 65–80) and 344 (75.4%) were male. Seventy-three (16.0%) and 79 (17.3%) patients were transferred to the ICU and died. The SF ratio displayed better or comparable predictive accuracy for unexpected ICU transfer (AUROC: 0.744) compared to MEWS (0.744 vs. 0.653, P = 0.03), NEWS (0.744 vs. 0.667, P = 0.04), and ViEWS (0.744 vs. 0.675, P = 0.06). For in-hospital mortality, although there was no statistical difference, the AUROC of the SF ratio (0.660) was higher than that of each of the preexisting EWS models. In comparison with the preexisting EWS models, the SF ratio showed better or comparable predictive accuracy for unexpected ICU transfers in the respiratory wards."
https://openalex.org/W2887834833,"Background Muscle weakness is associated with increased mortality risk in chronic haemodialysis (CHD) patients. Protein energy wasting (PEW) and low physical activity could impair muscle quality and contribute to muscle weakness beyond muscle wasting in these patients. Aim of this study was to assess clinical and biological parameters involved in the reduction of muscle strength of CHD patients. Methods One hundred and twenty-three CHD patients (80 males, 43 females; 68,8 [57.9–78.8] y.o.) were included in this study. Maximal voluntary force (MVF) of quadriceps was assessed using a belt-stabilized hand-held dynamometer. Muscle quality was evaluated by muscle specific torque, defined as the strength per unit of muscle mass. Muscle mass was estimated using lean tissue index (LTI), skeletal muscle mass (SMM) assessed by bioelectrical impedance analysis and creatinine index (CI). Voorrips questionnaire was used to estimate physical activity. Criteria for the diagnosis of PEW were serum albumin, body mass index < 23 kg/m2, creatinine index < 18.82 mg/kg/d and low dietary protein intake estimated by nPCR < 0.80g/kg/d. Results MVF was 76.1 [58.2–111.7] N.m. and was associated with CI (β = 5.3 [2.2–8.4], p = 0.001), LTI (β = 2.8 [0.6–5.1], p = 0.013), Voorrips score (β = 17.4 [2.9–31.9], p = 0.02) and serum albumin (β = 1.9 [0.5–3.2], p = 0.006). Only serum albumin (β = 0.09 [0.03–0.15], p = 0.003), Voorrips score (β = 0.8 [0.2–1.5], p = 0.005) and CI (β = 0.2 [0.1–0.3], p<0.001) remained associated with muscle specific torque. Thirty patients have dynapenia defined as impaired MVF with maintained SMM and were younger with high hs-CRP (p = 0.001), PEW criteria (p<0.001) and low Voorrips score (p = 0.001), and reduced dialysis vintage (p<0.046). Conclusions Beyond atrophy, physical inactivity and PEW conspire to impair muscle strength and specific torque in CHD patients and could be related to muscle quality.

https://openalex.org/W2885366664,"Background Cause-specific mortality trends are routinely reported for Scotland. However, ill-defined deaths are not routinely redistributed to more precise and internationally comparable categories nor is the mortality reported in terms of years of life lost to facilitate the calculation of the burden of disease. This study describes trends in Years of Life Lost (YLL) for specific causes of death in Scotland from 2000 to 2015. Methods We obtained records of all deaths in Scotland by age, sex, area and underlying cause of death between 2000 and 2015. We redistributed Ill-Defined Deaths (IDDs) to more exact and meaningful causes using internationally accepted methods. Years of Life Lost (YLL) using remaining life expectancy by sex and single year of age from the 2013 Scottish life table were calculated for each death. These data were then used to calculate the crude and age-standardised trends in YLL by age, sex, cause, health board area, and area deprivation decile. Results Between 2000 and 2015, the annual percentage of deaths that were ill-defined varied between 10% and 12%. The proportion of deaths that were IDDs increased over time and were more common: in women; amongst those aged 1–4 years, 25–34 years and >80 years; in more deprived areas; and in the island health boards. The total YLL fell from around 17,800 years per 100,000 population in 2000 to around 13,500 years by 2015. The largest individual contributors to YLL were Ischaemic Heart Disease (IHD), respiratory cancers, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), cerebrovascular disease and Alzheimer’s/dementia. The proportion of total YLL due to IHD and stroke declined over time, but increased for Alzheimer’s/dementia and drug use disorders. There were marked absolute inequalities in YLL by area deprivation, with a mean Slope Index of Inequality (SII) for all causes of 15,344 YLL between 2001 and 2015, with IHD and COPD the greatest contributors. The Relative Index of Inequality (RII) for YLL was highest for self-harm and lower respiratory infections. Conclusion The total YLL per 100,000 population in Scotland has declined over time. The YLL in Scotland is predominantly due to a wide range of chronic diseases, substance misuse, self-harm and increasingly Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. Inequalities in YLL, in both relative and absolute terms, are stark."
https://openalex.org/W2886546511,"Background Symptom burden, medical comorbidities, and functional well-being of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) initiating direct acting antiviral (DAA) therapy in real-world clinical settings are not known. We characterized these patient-reported outcomes (PROs) among HCV-infected patients and explored associations with sociodemographic, liver disease, and psychiatric/substance abuse variables. Methods and findings PROP UP is a large US multicenter observational study that enrolled 1,600 patients with chronic HCV in 2016–2017. Data collected prior to initiating DAA therapy assessed the following PROs: number of medical comorbidities; neuropsychiatric, somatic, gastrointestinal symptoms (PROMIS surveys); overall symptom burden (Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale); and functional well-being (HCV-PRO). Candidate predictors included liver disease markers and patient-reported sociodemographic, psychiatric, and alcohol/drug use features. Predictive models were explored using a random selection of 700 participants; models were then validated with data from the remaining 900 participants. The cohort was 55% male, 39% non-white, 48% had cirrhosis (12% with advanced cirrhosis); 52% were disabled or unemployed; 63% were on public health insurance or uninsured; and over 40% had markers of psychiatric illness. The median number of medical comorbidities was 4 (range: 0–15), with sleep disorders, chronic pain, diabetes, joint pain and muscle aches being present in 20–50%. Fatigue, sleep disturbance, pain and neuropsychiatric symptoms were present in over 60% and gastrointestinal symptoms in 40–50%. In multivariable validation models, the strongest and most frequent predictors of worse PROs were disability, unemployment, and use of psychiatric medications, while liver markers generally were not. Conclusions This large multi-center cohort study provides a comprehensive and contemporary assessment of the symptom burden and comorbid medical conditions in patients with HCV treated in real world settings. Pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance were common and often severe. Sociodemographic and psychiatric markers were the most robust predictors of PROs. Future research that includes a rapidly changing population of HCV-infected individuals needs to evaluate how DAA therapy affects PROs and elucidate which symptoms resolve with viral eradication.

https://openalex.org/W2886569573,"Background Resistance to commonly used antimicrobials is a growing concern in both human and veterinary medicine. Understanding the temporal changes in the burden of the problem and identifying its determinants is important for guiding control efforts. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate temporal patterns and predictors of antimicrobial resistance among Staphylococcus spp. isolated from canine specimens submitted to the University of Kentucky Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (UKVDL) between 1993 and 2009. Methods Retrospective data of 4,972 Staphylococcus isolates assessed for antimicrobial susceptibility using the disk diffusion method at the UKVDL between 1993 and 2009 were included in the study. Temporal trends were assessed for each antimicrobial using the Cochran-Armitage trend test. Logistic regression models were used to investigate predictors of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and multidrug resistance (MDR). Results A total of 68.2% (3,388/4,972) Staphylococcus isolates were S. intermedius group (SIG), 18.2% (907/4,972) were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), 7.6% (375/4,972) were S. aureus, 5.8% (290/4,972) were S. hyicus, and S. schleiferi subsp. coagulans comprised 0.2% (12/4,972) of the isolates. The overall percentage of AMR and MDR were 77.2% and 25.6%, respectively. The highest levels of AMR were seen in CoNS (81.3%; 737/907), S. aureus (80.5%; 302/375), and SIG (77.6%; 2,629/3388). The lowest levels of AMR were observed in S. hyicus (57.9%; 168/290) and S. schleiferi subsp. coagulans (33.3%; 4/12). Overall, AMR and MDR showed significant (p<0.001) decreasing temporal trends. Significant temporal trends (both increasing and decreasing) were observed among 12 of the 16 antimicrobials covering 6 of the 9 drug classes assessed. Thus, significant increasing temporal trends in resistance were observed to β-lactams (p<0.001) (oxacillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cephalothin, and penicillin (p = 0.024)), aminoglycosides (p<0.001) (gentamicin, and neomycin), bacitracin (p<0.001), and enrofloxacin (p<0.001). In contrast, sulfonamide (p<0.001) (sulfadiazin) and tetracycline (p = 0.010) resistant isolates showed significant decreasing temporal trends in AMR. Staphylococcus spp., geographic region, and specimen source were significant predictors of both AMR and MDR. Conclusions Although not unexpected nor alarming, the high levels of AMR to a number of antimicrobial agents and the increasing temporal trends are concerning. Therefore, continued monitoring of AMR among Staphylococcus spp. is warranted. Future studies will need to identify local factors responsible for the observed geographic differences in risk of both AMR and MDR."
https://openalex.org/W2885310393,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of oat beta-glucan supplementation on metabolic, physiological, immunological and nutritional variables in adult dogs. Fourteen dogs were fed a control diet or a diet supplemented with 1% beta-glucan during 71 days. Serum concentrations of glucose, total cholesterol and lipoprotein fractions, as well as plasma concentrations of peptide YY and ghrelin, were determined. In addition, coefficient of total tract apparent macronutrient digestibility (CTTAD), food intake and fecal output, score, and pH were evaluated. For evaluation of immunological variables, serum concentrations of interleukin-4 and interferon gamma were determined on days 0, 57 and 71, which corresponded to blood collection prior to beta-glucan supplementation, and at 7 and 14 days post first and second dose of vaccination (Pneumodog®, Merial, Campinas, Brazil), respectively. Animals fed the supplemented diet showed (P<0.05) lower serum concentrations of total cholesterol and low and very low density lipoproteins, lower coefficients of total tract apparent digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, mineral matter and ether extract, higher fecal output and lower fecal consistency, as well as a tendency (P = 0.07) of decreasing the coefficient of total tract apparent digestibility of crude protein. Moreover, the supplemented diet resulted in lower number of red blood cells, hematocrit percentage and hemoglobin concentration 21 days post-vaccination as well as lower serum concentration of interleukin-4 seven days post-vaccination (P<0.05). It is concluded that oat beta-glucan extract can be used as a dietary supplement for dogs at a dose of 10 g/kg of food, being effective in reducing blood concentrations of total cholesterol, LDL-c and VLDL-c as well as CTTAD of nutrients, demonstrating a potential to be used in the feeding of obese animals. In addition, by reducing the predominance of a Th2 response, oat beta-glucan can positively modulate the vaccine response of animals."
https://openalex.org/W2887347932,"Large mammals are often a source of conflict, and consequently there has been increasing interest in close encounters with them. Knowledge of wildlife responses to human disturbance is crucial for the management of increasing and expanding populations of large animals. We investigated flight initiation distance (FID) and aggressive responses of the European bison-the largest terrestrial mammal of Europe-to human disturbance in the Białowieża Forest (NE Poland). When encountered by humans, bison usually flee. Aggression was observed in only 0.4% of approach attempts. Mean FID was 77±46 m and was influenced by habitat, sex, and supplementary feeding intensity. Females showed greater timidity than males, FID was lower in forest than in open habitats, and supplementary feeding caused a drop in FID. In 84.5% of all documented aggression cases, bison attacks were provoked by humans approaching too close to the bison or by deliberate scaring them. Males were more aggressive than females, and attacked mainly during the rut, while females attacked during the winter and calving. Bison attacked in built-up areas significantly more often than expected. The mean critical distance of attacks was 21±2 m. Most attacks took the form of a short chase preceded by warning signs. Goring was observed in 22.7% of all aggression cases and no fatalities were recorded. Our study shows that bison are not dangerous animals and only manifest aggression in response to prolonged disturbance at close ranges. The education of people and recommendations for minimum approach distances should ensure a low rate of disturbance and safety when encountering large mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2887355949,"The Crocodyliformes are the most represented vertebrate clade in the Upper Cretaceous sequences of the Bauru Group, Paraná Basin. However, some of the species described have an uncertain taxonomic status and phylogenetic position. For instance, “Goniopholis” paulistanus has been assigned as a nomem dubium, due to its description being based on scarce material. The “G”. paulistanus specimens (i.e. teeth and a left tibia) were discovered in two different localities in São Paulo state: Mirandópolis and Valparaíso municipalities; where the upper interval of the Adamantina Formation (Early Maastrichtian of Bauru Group) crops out. Revisiting these specimens, we observed multicrenulated teeth in middle dentary toot- row, a remarkable feature only shared with teleosaurids Machimosaurus hugii (Upper Jurassic of Laurasia) and M. rex (Lower Cretaceous of Tunisia). This apomorphy was also recognized in new material from the Alfredo Marcondes municipality (Presidente Prudente Formation), which are here also referred to “G”. paulistanus. We recognized the teeth of “G.” paulistanus as the lectotype, however the tibia cannot be assigned to a species as it was not collected in association with the teeth. We performed a phylogenetic analysis with a data matrix composed of 388 characters and 86 taxa, analyzed in TNT. The strict consensus tree recovered Neosuchia and Ziphosuchia (Notosuchia + Sebecia) within Mesoeucrocodylia. The species “G” paulistanus is valid, as a distinct and new genus within Sebecia, in a polytomy with Barreirosuchus, Pepesuchus, Itasuchus and Peirosaurus, forming the clade Itasuchidae. Stolokrosuchus is the sister taxon to Itasuchidae, the sister group of all other Sebecia (Peirosauridae (Mahajangasuchidae + Sebecidae and taxa affinis)). The clades Ziphosuchia, Sebecia and Itasuchidae are here redefined, and we find the last two clades to be more closely related to terrestrial notosuchids than to semiaquatic neosuchians."
https://openalex.org/W2885140957,"Airway remodeling with progressive epithelial alterations in the respiratory tract is a severe consequence of asthma. Although dysfunctional signaling transduction is attributed to airway inflammation, the exact mechanism of airway remodeling remains largely unknown. TRPC1, a member of the transient receptor potential canonical Ca2+ channel family, possesses versatile functions but its role in airway remodeling remains undefined. Here, we show that ablation of TRPC1 in mice alleviates airway remodeling following house dust mite (HDM) challenge with decreases in mucus production, cytokine secretion, and collagen deposition. HDM challenge induces Ca2+ influx via the TRPC1 channel, resulting in increased levels of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and proinflammatory cytokines. In contrast, STAT3 expression was significantly decreased in TRPC1−/− mouse lungs compared with wild-type controls after HDM challenge. Mechanistically, STAT3 promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and increases mucin 5AC expression. Collectively, these findings identify TRPC1 as a modulator of HDM-induced airway remodeling via STAT3-mediated increase in mucus production, which provide new insight in our understanding of the molecular basis of airway remodeling, and identify novel therapeutic targets for intervention of severe chronic asthma.—Pu, Q., Zhao, Y., Sun, Y., Huang, T., Lin, P., Zhou, C., Qin, S., Singh, B.

https://openalex.org/W2885458944,"Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are used as a great promising choice for the treatment of cerebral ischemia. Herein, we discuss the neuroprotective effects of the combination of BMSCs transplantation and mild hypothermia (MH) in an ischemia-reperfusion rat model. First, BMSCs were isolated using density gradient centrifugation and the adherent screening method, followed by culture, identification and labeling with DAPI. Second, adult male SD rats were divided into 5 groups: sham group (surgery without blockage of middle cerebral artery), model group (middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was established 2h prior to reperfusion), BMSCs group (injection of BMSCs via the lateral ventricle 24h after MCAO), MH group (mild hypothermia for 3h immediately after MCAO) and combination therapy group (combination of BMSCs and MH). Finally, the modified neurological severity score (mNSS) test was performed to assess behavioral function at different time points (before MCAO, before transplantation, at day 1, day 5 and day 10 after transplantation). After that, the brain was subjected to TTC staining, and the homing and angiogenesis were evaluated by immumofluorescence and immunohistochemistry. Immunofluorescence staining and Western Blot analysis were performed to calculate the percentage of the infarct area and explore glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Our results showed that the combination therapy significantly decreased mNSS scores (P<0.01) and reduced the percentage of the infarct area (P<0.01) than a single treatment. Moreover, the expression of GFAP and VEGF increased significantly in the combination therapy group (at day 5, day 10 after transplantation; at all time points after transplantation, respectively) compared to the single treatment groups. Taken together, it was suggested that the combination of BMSCs transplantation and MH can significantly reduce the percentage of the infarct area and improve functional recovery by promoting homing and angiogenesis, which may be a beneficial treatment for cerebral ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W2886910531,"7-Ketocholesterol is a major dietary cholesterol oxidation product found in high concentrations in atherosclerotic plaques, which contribute to the development of atherosclerosis. This study aimed to investigate the effects of 7-ketocholesterol on endothelial inflammation, as well as the underlying mechanisms. Pretreatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) with 7-ketocholesterol significantly enhanced the total interactions between human monocytic cells (THP-1 cell line) and TNFα-activated HUVECs under physiological flow conditions, compared to pretreatment with cholesterol (TNFα+50 μM cholesterol: 13.1 ± 0.54 cells/CPF, TNFα+50 μM 7-ketocholesterol: 18.9 ± 0.35 cells/CPF, p < 0.01). 7-Ketocholesterol enhanced the expression of E-selectin, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 proteins. It also activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and treatment with a p38 MAPK inhibitor inhibited both E-selectin expression via ATF-2 activation and 7-ketocholesterol-induced THP-1 adhesion to HUVECs. These findings suggest that 7-ketocholesterol enhances leukocyte-endothelial interactions by upregulating the expression of adhesion molecules, presumably via the p38 MAPK-dependent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2885339118,"The phylogenetic relationships among members of the family Salamandridae have been repeatedly investigated over the last 90 years, with changing character and taxon sampling. We review the changing composition and the phylogenetic position of salamandrid genera and species groups and add a new phylogeny based exclusively on sequences of nuclear genes. Salamandrina often changed its position depending on the characters used. It was included several times in a clade together with the primitive newts (Echinotriton, Pleurodeles, Tylototriton) due to their seemingly ancestral morphology. The latter were often inferred as a monophyletic clade. Respective monophyly was almost consistently established in all molecular studies for true salamanders (Chioglossa, Lyciasalamandra, Mertensiella, Salamandra), modern Asian newts (Cynops, Laotriton, Pachytriton, Paramesotriton) and modern New World newts (Notophthalmus, Taricha). Reciprocal non-monophyly has been established through molecular studies for the European mountain newts (Calotriton, Euproctus) and the modern European newts (Ichthyosaura, Lissotriton, Neurergus, Ommatotriton, Triturus) since Calotriton was identified as the sister lineage of Triturus. In pre-molecular studies, their respective monophyly had almost always been assumed, mainly because a complex courtship behaviour shared by their respective members. Our nuclear tree is nearly identical to a mito-genomic tree, with all but one node being highly supported. The major difference concerns the position of Calotriton, which is no longer nested within the modern European newts. This has implications for the evolution of courtship behaviour of European newts. Within modern European newts, Ichthyosaura and Lissotriton changed their position compared to the mito-genomic tree. Previous molecular trees based on seemingly large nuclear data sets, but analysed together with mitochondrial data, did not reveal monophyly of modern European newts since taxon sampling and nuclear gene coverage was too poor to obtain conclusive results. We therefore conclude that mitochondrial and nuclear data should be analysed on their own."
https://openalex.org/W2885675347,"Early-life adversity is a major risk factor for the development of diseases later in life. Maternal protein restriction (MPR) is associated with morbidities in offspring affecting multiple organs, but its impact on the gastrointestinal (GI) tract remains poorly studied. Using a rat model, we examined the consequences of MPR on GI function and on the enteric nervous system (ENS) in the offspring at postnatal d 35 under basal state and following a water avoidance stress (WAS). Compared with control rats, MPR rats exhibited greater colonic motility, permeability, and corticosteronemia. In contrast to controls, MPR rats presented a blunted functional and corticosteronemic response to WAS. Furthermore, MPR rats showed an increased proportion of choline acetyltransferase–immunoreactive (ChAT-IR) neurons and a reduced level of autophagy in colonic myenteric neurons. In ENS cultures, corticosterone treatment increased the proportion of ChAT-IR neurons and reduced autophagy level in enteric neurons. Inhibition of autophagy in ENS cultures resulted in a higher vulnerability of enteric neurons to a cellular stress. Altogether, this study suggests that MPR induced GI dysfunction and ENS alterations in offspring rats and that MPR-induced increased corticosteronemia might be involved in ENS remodeling and altered responsiveness of the gut to stressors later in life.—Aubert, P., Oleynikova, E., Rizvi, H., Ndjim, M., Le Berre-Scoul, C., Grohard, P.

https://openalex.org/W2886269412,"Racial disparities persist in adverse perinatal outcomes such as preterm birth, low birthweight (LBW), and infant mortality across the U.S. Although pervasive, these disparities are not universal. Some communities have experienced significant improvements in black (or African American) birth outcomes, both in absolute rates and in rate ratios relative to whites. This study assessed county-level progress on trends in black and white LBW rates as an indicator of progress toward more equal birth outcomes for black infants. County-level LBW data were obtained from the 2003 to 2013 U.S. Natality files. Black LBW rates, black-white rate ratios and percent differences over time were calculated. Trend lines were first assessed for significant differences in slope (i.e., converging, diverging, or parallel trend lines). For counties with parallel trend lines, intercepts were tested for statistically significant differences (sustained equality vs. persistent disparities). To assess progress, black LBW rates were compared to white LBW rates, and the trend lines were tested for significant decline. Each county’s progress toward black-white equality was ultimately categorized into five possible trend patterns (n = 408): (1) converging LBW rates with reductions in the black LBW rate (decreasing disparities, n = 4, 1%); (2) converging LBW rates due to worsening white LBW rates (n = 5, 1%); (3) diverging LBW rates (increasing disparities, n = 9, 2%); (4) parallel LBW rates (persistent disparities, n = 373, 91%); and (5) overlapping trend lines (sustained equality, n = 18, 4%). Only four counties demonstrated improvement toward equality with decreasing black LBW rates. There is significant county-level variation in progress toward racial equality in adverse birth outcomes such as low birthweight. Still, some communities are demonstrating that more equitable outcomes are possible. Further research is needed in these positive exemplar communities to identify what works in accelerating progress toward more equal birth outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2886132984,"Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum L.) is one of the ancient medical crops, which produces several important alkaloids such as morphine, noscapine, sanguinarine and codeine. MicroRNAs are endogenous non-coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles in plant diverse biological processes. Many plant miRNAs are encoded as single transcriptional units, in contrast to animal miRNAs, which are often clustered. Herein, using computational approaches, a total of 22 miRNA precursors were identified, which five of them were located as a clustered in pre-ribosomal RNA. Afterward, the transcript level of the precursor and the mature of clustered miRNAs in two species of the Papaveraceae family, i.e. P. somniferum L. and P. bracteatum L, were quantified by RT-PCR. With respect to obtained results, these clustered miRNAs were expressed differentially in different tissues of these species. Moreover, using target prediction and Gene Ontology (GO)-based on functional classification indicated that these miRNAs might play crucial roles in various biological processes as well as metabolic pathways. In this study, we discovered the clustered miRNA derived from pre-rRNA, which may shed some light on the importance of miRNAs in the plant kingdom."
https://openalex.org/W2886401634,"Fish populations are linked to ocean biogeochemistry by their reliance on primary production for food, and dissolved oxygen to breathe. It is also possible that marine fish modify biogeochemical dynamics, as do freshwater fish, through top-down trophic cascades, but there has been relatively little consideration of this possibility. This lack of consideration may reflect a lack of importance; alternatively, it may simply reflect the lack of appropriate observations with which to constrain such relationships. Here, we draw attention to the potential use of marine sediments as long-term simultaneous monitors of both fish abundance and marine biogeochemical dynamics. We compile published sediment proxy records of fish abundance from the west coasts of the Americas, and compare them with biogeochemical proxy measurements made at the same sites. Despite the challenges of using sediment records and the potential convolution of ecological and climatic signals, we find a small number of statistically significant relationships between fish debris and biogeochemical variables, at least some of which are likely to reflect causal relationships. Considering TOC, the most commonly-measured biogeochemical variable, some positive correlations with fish abundance are found, consistent with bottom-up control of fish abundance by primary production, or a planktivore-herbivore-phytoplankton trophic cascade. Negative correlations are also found, which could reflect sedimentary processes, the influence of upwelling-driven oxygen and nutrient dynamics on primary production and fish populations, and/or impacts of fish stocks on carbon fluxes by altering the recycling of carbon within the water column. Although the number of available measurements is too small to draw strong conclusions, the results point to plausible cases of bottom-up forcing, trophic cascades, and influence of dissolved oxygen concentrations on fish habitat."
https://openalex.org/W2887439942,"Background Recent findings suggest a decline in mean blood pressure and prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension in the South African adult population in the last decade, in contrast with the increase previously observed. This study aimed at quantifying the contribution of antihypertensive treatment to this decline. Methods We used data from the four waves of the National Income Dynamics Study between 2008 and 2015 and analysed changes in systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension among South African adults (15 years and above). We compared the observed changes with a counterfactual scenario in which the impact of antihypertensive treatment was estimated by censored regression and removed, with and without adjustment for BMI, waist circumference, alcohol use and smoking. Results During the study period, the prevalence of antihypertensive treatment rose from 13.1% to 17.6% among women and from 5.3% to 8.2% among men. Concurrently–despite worsening trends in major biobehavioural risk factors for elevated blood pressure–mean SBP decreased in both genders, DBP decreased among women and was stable among men. The odds of uncontrolled hypertension decreased by 4%/year among women and 1%/year among men. After removing the treatment effect, the downward trend in the odds of uncontrolled hypertension was reduced to 1%/year among women and completely offset among men. Among those 55 years and older, but not among younger subjects, treatment effects also explained most of the observed decreases in mean SBP and DBP. Conclusions Among South African adults, we infer that diffusion of antihypertensive treatment contributed substantially to the downward trend in the prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension observed between 2008 and 2015. The marked decrease in SBP and uncontrolled hypertension found among younger participants could not be explained by treatment nor by the changing distribution of the measured risk factors available in this study, and requires further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2885301932,"Background There is limited information on the effectiveness of available treatments for anal condyloma acuminata in HIV-1-infected men. Aim To provide data on the effectiveness of electrosurgical excision, infrared coagulation and pharmacological (imiquimod) treatments for anal condyloma acuminata (peri-anal and/or intra-anal) in HIV-1-infected men based on authors’ practice. Methods Single-center, retrospective descriptive analysis of HIV-1-infected men, 18 years or older treated for anal condyloma acuminata. Standard treatments were offered: electrosurgery excision, infrared coagulation and topical imiquimod. Effectiveness was evaluated by the recurrence rate at 1 year after treatment. Recurrence was defined as any anal condyloma acuminata diagnosed after 3 months of condyloma-free survival post-treatment. Anal cytology and human-papillomavirus-infection (HPV) was assessed. Results Between January 2005 and May 2009, 101 men were treated for anal condyloma acuminata: 65 (64%) with electrosurgery, 27 (27%) with infrared coagulation and 9 (9%) with imiquimod. At 1 year after treatment, the cumulative recurrence rate was 8% (4/65, 95%CI: 2–15%) with electrosurgery excision, 11% (3/27, 95%CI: 4–28%) with infrared coagulation and 11% (1/9, 95%CI: 2–44%) with imiquimod treatment. No predictive factors were associated with recurrence. Anal HPV-6 or HPV-11 was detectable in 98 (97%) patients and all had high-risk HPV genotypes, and 89 (88%) patients had abnormal anal canal cytology. Limitations: this was a retrospective descriptive analysis; limited to a single center; it cannot know if the recurrence is related to new infection. Conclusion Recurrence of anal condyloma after any treatment was common. Abnormal anal cytology and high-risk HPV-infection were highly prevalent in this population, therefore at high-risk of anal cancer, and warrants careful follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W2885752281,"The identification of inhibitors of eukaryotic protein biosynthesis, which are targeting single translation factors, is highly demanded. Here we report on a small molecule inhibitor, gephyronic acid, isolated from the myxobacterium Archangium gephyra that inhibits growth of transformed mammalian cell lines in the nM range. In direct comparison, primary human fibroblasts were shown to be less sensitive to toxic effects of gephyronic acid than cancer-derived cells. Gephyronic acid is targeting the protein translation system. Experiments with IRES dual luciferase reporter assays identified it as an inhibitor of the translation initiation. DARTs approaches, co-localization studies and pull-down assays indicate that the binding partner could be the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 subunit alpha (eIF2α). Gephyronic acid seems to have a different mode of action than the structurally related polyketides tedanolide, myriaporone, and pederin and is a valuable tool for investigating the eukaryotic translation system. Because cancer derived cells were found to be especially sensitive, gephyronic acid could potentially find use as a drug candidate."
https://openalex.org/W2885815223,"Background Education on inhaler technique is critical for effective asthma treatment. However, traditionally used face-to-face education is time-consuming, costly, and often laborious. The current study evaluated the efficacy of a newly developed video-based inhaler technique education method. Methods A total of 184 subjects with well-controlled or partly-controlled asthma were enrolled from 12 hospitals in South Korea from 30 November 2015 to 01 June 2016. Subjects were randomly divided into two groups in a 1:1 ratio; a control group that received face-to-face education, and a study group that received video education. All subjects received fluticasone propionate plus salmeterol xinafoate (Fluterol® 250/50 inhalation capsules) for 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure was forced expiratory volume in the 1st second (FEV1) at 12 weeks. The secondary outcome measures were change in FEV1 at 4 weeks, change in asthma control test (ACT) score, and changes in various inhaler technique parameters. These measures were assessed with a non-inferiority margin of 10% between the control group and the study group. Results FEV1 was significantly improved at 12 weeks in the control group and the study group. After adjustment, FEV1 improvement was not significantly inferior in the study group compared to the control group. The secondary outcome measures, including change in FEV1 at 4 weeks, ACT score, and various parameters pertaining to inhaler technique and satisfaction at 4 and 12 weeks did not differ significantly in the two groups. In subgroup analysis of elderly subjects and subjects with well-controlled asthma, FEV1 was significantly improved at 12 weeks in the study group but not the control group. Conclusion The newly developed video education technique investigated functioned as a suitable substitute for face-to-face education on inhaler technique (dry powder inhalation capsule) in patients with stable asthma, particularly in elderly patients and patients with well-controlled asthma."
https://openalex.org/W2886259550,"Background To evaluate the effect of (new) treatments or analyse prevalence and risk factors of contractures, rating scales are used based on joint range of motion. However, cut-off points for levels of severity vary between scales, and it seems unclear how cut-off points relate to function. The purpose of this study was to compare severity ratings of different rating scales for the shoulder and elbow and relate these with functional range of motion. Methods Often used contracture severity rating scales in orthopedics, physiotherapy, and burns were included. Functional range of motion angles for the shoulder and elbow were derived from a recent synthesis published by our group. Shoulder flexion and elbow flexion range of motion data of patients three months after a burn injury were rated with each of the scales to illustrate the effects of differences in classifications. Secondly, the shoulder and elbow flexion range of motion angles were related to the required angles to perform over 50 different activities of daily living tasks. Results Eighteen rating scales were included (shoulder: 6, elbow: 12). Large differences in the number of severity levels and the cut-off points between scales were determined. Rating the measured range of motions with the different scales showed substantial inconsistency in the number of joints without impairment (shoulder: 14–36%, elbow: 26–100%) or with severe impairment (shoulder: < 10%–29%, elbow 0%–17%). Cut-off points of most scales were not related to actual function in daily living. Conclusion There is an urgent need for rating scales that express the severity of contractures in terms of loss of functionality. This study proposes a direction for a solution."
https://openalex.org/W2885206533,"Background Point of care tests (POCTs) are increasingly being promoted for guiding the primary medical care of community acquired lower respiratory tract infections (CA-LRTI). POCT development has seldom been guided by explicitly identified clinical need and requirements of the intended users. Approaches for identifying POCT priorities and developing target product profiles (TPPs) for POCTs in primary medical care are not well developed, and there is no published TPP for a CA-LRTI POCT aimed at developed countries. Methods We conducted workshops with expert stakeholders and a survey with primary care clinicians to produce a target product profile (TPP) to guide the development of a clinically relevant and technologically feasible POCT for CA-LRTI. Results Participants with clinical, academic, industrial, technological and basic scientific backgrounds contributed to four expert workshops, and 45 practicing primary care clinicians responded to an online survey and prioritised community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) as the CA-LRTI where a new POCT was most urgently needed. Consensus was reached on a TPP document that included information on the intended niche in the clinical pathway in primary medical care; diagnostic product specification (intended use statement and test concept), and minimum and ideal user specifications. Clinicians minimum requirements of a CA-LRTI POCT included the use of minimally invasive samples, a result in less than 30 minutes, no more than a single preparation step, minimum operational requirements, and detection of common respiratory pathogens and their resistance to commonly prescribed antibiotics. Conclusions This multidisciplinary, multistage partnership approach generated a clinically-driven TPP for guiding the development of a new POCT, and this approach as well as the TPP itself may be useful to others developing a new POCT."

Here, we discovered that miR-18a participates in myoblasts proliferation. Expression of miR-18a was downregulated with the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts. Overexpression of miR-18a affected the proliferation of C2C12 cells, primary myoblasts and RD cells. MiR-18a influenced the expression of cell cycle-related genes. Using TargetScan 6.2, we found that the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the mouse Fgf1 gene contains complementary sequences to miR-18a. Using a siRNA, we confirmed that the reduction in the Fgf1 levels inhibited proliferation of C2C12 cells. Therefore, our results show that miR-18a participates in the regulation of proliferation by partly decreasing the expression of Fgf1."

We have developed a new optical system for easily and accurately measuring oxidative stress in whole blood. It is optimized for simultaneously detecting reactive oxygen species (ROS) and highly reactive ROS (hROS), elicited mostly by white blood cells in a few microliters of blood. Results obtained by using this system show at least four important findings. 1) chemiluminescence of MCLA was confirmed to be attributable to O2-•. 2) PMA-stimulated cells released O2-• longer and more slowly than fMLP-stimulated ones. 3) fluorescence produced by APF oxidation was confirmed to be attributable to hROS, mostly OCl-, produced by myeloperoxidase. 4) the generation of OCl- was found to be a slower process than the O2-• generation. We also conducted pilot studies of oxidative stress in healthy volunteers."
https://openalex.org/W2885116958,"Sound sensitive dogs have exaggerated responses to sound stimuli that can negatively impact the welfare of the dog. Behavioural reactions combined with the response to sound involve a marked autonomic imbalance towards sympathetic predominance and release of cortisol. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate, in the laboratory, the cardiac autonomic modulation using heart rate variability (HRV) analysis, serum cortisol levels and behavioural parameters in response to sounds of fireworks in dogs with a history of sensitivity to fireworks. Based on these data, and combining qualitative measures and categorical measures, we propose one short and one full index of sound sensitivity in dogs. Six privately owned dogs with no history and another twelve dogs with a history of sound sensitivity to fireworks were used. The sound stimulus consisted of a standardised recording of fireworks (180-seconds long) with a peak intensity of 103-104 dB. The cardiac intervals were recorded using a frequency meter (Polar® RS800CX model) to evaluate the HRV, and the acquired data were processed using CardioSeries 2.4.1 software. Twenty-one behavioural parameters were analysed quantitatively by time, frequency or categorically by scores and were grouped in behavioural categories of arousal, fear, relaxation and ""other"". Sound sensitive dogs had exacerbated autonomic responses to the sound stimulus in the laboratory compared to non-sensitive dogs, with higher LF/HF ratios suggesting autonomic imbalance towards sympathetic predominance, but the cortisol levels were similar between the sensitive and non-sensitive dogs. Sound sensitive dogs showed pronounced responses for the parameters: alert and attention, search sound, startle, trembling, hiding, run away and less intense responses for the parameters rest and wink/sleep. Furthermore, the behavioural categories of arousal, fear, relaxation (lack of) and LF/HF were correlated to the caregiver's perception of the sound sensitivity of the dogs. Not only the short index for sound sensitivity (behavioural categories arousal, fear and relaxation, and LF/HF ratio) but also the full index for sound sensitivity (all behavioural categories, LF/HF and cortisol levels) was highly correlated to sound fear response at home. These indexes can contribute to the development of strategies to treat sound sensitive dogs."
https://openalex.org/W2886678951,"Background To examine the effect of Sexual Health in Practice (SHIP) training for general practitioners (GPs) on HIV testing rates in Haringey, a deprived area of London, UK, with a population of over 250,000 and HIV prevalence of 0.7% (in 2014). SHIP is an educational intervention delivering peer-developed and peer-led face-to-face training to improve quality of sexual and reproductive health (SRH) care. Methods We carried out a quasi-experimental study of intervention effects across 52 GP practices (2008–2016). We used time variation in SHIP intervention exposure for effect estimation, controlling for practice and calendar month fixed effects in panel analysis. From 2008–2010, baseline data were collected, and in the subsequent six-year period, 78 GPs in Haringey (approximately 40% of all GPs) were SHIP trained. 46 Haringey practices (of 52) had at least one trained doctor. Outcome measures were monthly HIV tests and results by practice (obtained from the hospital laboratories). Results SHIP significantly increased HIV testing; for every GP trained, practice HIV testing rates increased by 16% (testing rate ratio (TRR) 1.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05–1.28, p value 0.004). This significant effect was demonstrated using an 8-year observation period, and was sustained over the post-intervention period. An average of 1.42% of HIV tests were positive. Conclusion SHIP training produces a significant and sustained increase in HIV testing for each GP trained. Compared with general population screening, HIV tests used in routine clinical care have a high probability of detecting a positive person. Unlike an RCT, this evaluation is a ‘real life’ measure of the effect that commissioners of SHIP could expect in comparable areas of the UK. The effectiveness of the SHIP training may be related to the programme components not included in interventions that did not demonstrate an effect, such as peer-led teaching, and use of approaches to communication and rapid risk assessment tailored to the setting."
https://openalex.org/W2887249182,"Background Medical Infrared Imaging (MII) is an investigative method that can be potentially used in emergency care to non-invasively detect thermal signatures associated with change in blood flow. We have developed a protocol for the use of MII in the Emergency Department (ED) and shown that it is feasible. To derive initial data for sample size calculations, we performed an exploratory study in patients with fever and sepsis. Methods The Leicester MII protocol was used to image the temperature patterns along the arm among three patient groups (control, fever and sepsis) of a total 56 patients. Anatomical markers were used to divide this gradient into upper arm, forearm, hand and finger regions. Variations in measurements within and between these regions were described. Results The thermal gradient down the arm was successfully extracted in all patients. The distribution of values in each region of the arm was described in control, fever and sepsis patients. There was a significant gradient between upper arm and finger in controls (2.75, p < 0.0001), but no gradient in fever (p = 0.944) or sepsis (p = 0.710). This was reflected in the finger/arm difference, which was of -2.74°C (±3.50) in controls, -0.39C (±2.48) in fever, and -1.80°C (±3.09) in sepsis. Conclusions This study found different thermal gradients along the arm in control and febrile groups, and defined the degree of individual variation. It is likely that the difference between upper arm temperature and finger temperature (representing the temperature gradient down the arm) may be more useful than absolute measurements in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2885290335,"The rarity of human remains makes it difficult to apprehend the first settlements in Corsica. It is admitted that initial colonization could have occurred during the Mesolithic period when glaciations would have shortened the open water travel distance from the continent. Mesolithic sites in Corsica show relatively short and irregular occupation, and suggest discontinuous settling of very mobile groups probably traveling by boat. Previous genetic studies on Corsican populations showed internal differentiation and a relatively poor genetic relationship with continental populations, despite intense historical contacts, however local Mesolithic-based genetic inheritance has never been properly estimated. The aim of this study was to explore the Corsican genetic profile of Y-chromosomes in order to trace the genetic signatures back to the first migrations to Corsica. This study included 321 samples from men throughout Corsica; samples from Provence and Tuscany were added to the cohort. All samples were typed for 92 Y-SNPs, and Y-STRs were also analyzed. Results revealed highly differentiated haplogroup patterns among Corsican populations. Haplogroup G had the highest frequency in Corsica, mostly displaying a unique Y-STR profile. When compared with Provence and Tuscany, Corsican populations displayed limited genetic proximity. Corsican populations present a remarkable Y-chromosome genetic mixture. Although the Corsican Y-chromosome profile shows similarities with both Provence and to a lesser extent Tuscany, it mainly displays its own specificity. This study confirms the high level of genetic diversity in Corsican populations and backs genetic contributions from prehistoric migrations associated with the Mesolithic, Neolithic and Metal Age eras, rather than from historical movements to Corsica, respectively attested by frequencies and TMRCA of haplogroups G2a-L91 and G2a-P15, J2a-M241 and J2-DYS445 = 6, R1b-U152 and R1b-U106. These results suggest that marine routes to reach the Corsican coast in many different points may have led to such a genetic heterogeneity."
https://openalex.org/W2885790430,"Metacognition is a domain which has illuminated our understanding of the regulation of cognition, but has yet to be applied in detail to more physical activities. We used half marathon finish time predictions from 7211 runners to investigate the factors that influence running performance metacognitive accuracy. In particular, we were concerned with the effects of experience, gender, and age on calibration. We expected more experienced runners to be better calibrated than less experienced ones. Given analogous findings in the domain of metacognition, we expected women to be less overconfident in their predictions, and better calibrated than male runners. Based on the metacognition literature, we expected that if older runners have effectively learned from previous experience, they would be as well-calibrated as younger runners. In contrast, uninformed inferences not based on performance feedback would lead to overestimating performance for older compared to younger runners. As expected, experience in terms of both club membership and previous race completion improved calibration. Unexpectedly though, females were more overconfident than males, overestimating their performance and demonstrating poorer calibration. A positive relationship was observed between age and prediction accuracy, with older runners showing better calibration. The present study demonstrates that data, collected before a test of physical activity, can inform our understanding of how participants anticipate their performance, and how this ability is affected by a number of demographic and situational variables. Athletes and coaches alike should be aware of these variables to better understand, organise, plan, and predict running performance, potentially leading to more appropriate training sessions and faster race finish times."
https://openalex.org/W2885885822,"Titin (TTN) Truncating variants (TTNtv) in the A-band of TTN predispose the mouse heart to systolic dysfunction when subjected to pressure-loading. However, the effects of TTNtv of the Z-disc are largely unexplored. A rat model of pressure-loaded heart is developed by trans-aortic constriction (TAC). Rats with TTNtv of the Z-disc were randomly assigned to TAC (Z-TAC) or sham-surgery (Z-Sham) and wildtype (WT) littermates served as controls (WT-TAC or WT-Sham). Left ventricular (LV) function was assessed by echocardiography. Pressure volume (PV) loops, histology and molecular profiling were performed eight months after surgery. Pressure-load by TAC increased LV mass in all cases when compared with Sham animals. Notably, systolic function was preserved in TAC animals throughout the study period, which was confirmed by terminal PV loops. Diastolic function was impaired in Z-disc TTNtv rats at baseline as compared to WT and became impaired further after TAC (dp/dtmin, mmHg/s): Z-TAC = -3435±763, WT-TAC = -6497±1299 (p<0.01). Z-TAC animals had greater cardiac fibrosis, with elevated collagen content and decreased vascular density as compared to WT-TAC animals associated with enhanced apoptosis of myocyte and non-myocyte populations. In the context of pressure overload, Z-disc TTNtv is associated with cardiac fibrosis, diastolic dysfunction, and capillary rarefaction in the absence of overt systolic dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2885113717,"Dental implants are important tools for restoring the loss of teeth. The rapid growth and periodic regeneration of antlers make Sika deer a good and less invasive alternative model for studying bone remodelling in mammals. We developed a special loading device for antlers and analysed the bone reaction around unloaded implants and under immediate loading conditions until osseointegration occurred. In micro-computed tomography images, the density of antler tissue around the implants increased as the loading time increased. This finding was histologically confirmed by the good osseointegration observed in unloaded and loaded specimens. Antler tissue displays a similar healing process to human bone. The use of an antler model is a promising alternative for implant studies that does not require animal sacrifice."
https://openalex.org/W2886224144,"To evaluate postoperative changes of the intermittent exotropia type as classified by 1-hour monocular occlusion test.Institutional, retrospective study.We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 179 patients who had undergone surgery for intermittent exotropia with a postoperative follow-up of 6 months or more. We evaluated the exodeviation obtained before and after 1-hour monocular occlusion preoperatively and again at postoperative 1, 3 and 6 months. Intermittent exotropia was divided into 4 types according to Burian's classification. The main outcome measure was the distribution of intermittent exotropia type based on 1-hour monocular occlusion in both pre- and postoperative periods.Of the 179 patients, 152 (84.9%) were assigned preoperatively to the basic type, 14 (7.8%) to the pseudo-divergence excess type, and 13 (7.8%) to the convergence insufficiency type. At postoperative 1, 3, and 6 months, the exotropia-type distribution was shifted predominantly to the basic type (p<0.001, p = 0.004, p = 0.029, respectively). Among the preoperative basic-type patients, 96.9% maintained that type postoperatively. However, only 18.2 and 11.1% of the pseudo-divergence excess and convergence insufficiency types maintained the same type. The proportions of the basic type had increased at postoperative 6 months, from 87.8 to 95.7% for bilateral lateral rectus (BLR) recession, from 73.7 to 92.3% for unilateral recess-resect (R&R), and from 88.0 to 95.0% for unilateral lateral rectus (ULR) recession.The type of intermittent exotropia changed mostly to the basic type postoperatively even as classified after 1-hour monocular occlusion. This finding was consistent regardless of the surgical methods (BLR, ULR recession and R&R)."
https://openalex.org/W2887423976,"The 2-sample mark-recapture method with Chapman’s estimator is often used by inland fishery managers to estimate the reach-scale abundance of stream fish. An important assumption of this method is that no dispersal into or out of the study reach occurs between the two samples. Violations of this assumption are probably common in practice, but their effect on bias (systematic error) of abundance estimates is poorly understood, especially in small populations. Estimation methods permitting dispersal exist but, for logistical reasons, often are infeasible for routine assessments in streams. The purpose of this paper is to extend available results regarding effects of dispersal on the bias of Chapman’s estimator as applied to reach-scale studies of stream fish abundance. We examine for the first time the joint effects of dispersal and sampling variation on the bias of this estimator. To reduce the bias effects of dispersal, we propose a modified sampling scheme in which the original study reach is expanded, a central subreach is sampled during the mark session (sample 1), and the entire reach is sampled during the recapture session (sample 2). This modified sampling scheme can substantially reduce bias effects of dispersal without requiring unique marking of individual fish or additional site visits. Analytical and simulation results show that sampling variation tends to create negative bias with respect to study-reach abundance, while dispersal tends to create positive bias; the net effect can be positive, negative, or zero, depending on the true abundance, capture probabilities, and amount and nature of dispersal. In most cases, simply expanding the study reach is an effective way to reduce dispersal-related bias of Chapman’s estimator, but expanding the study reach and employing the modified sampling scheme we propose is a better alternative for accurately estimating abundance with the same level of sampling effort."
