https://openalex.org/W2129795133,"In vivo protein-DNA interactions connect each transcription factor with its direct targets to form a gene network scaffold. To map these protein-DNA interactions comprehensively across entire mammalian genomes, we developed a large-scale chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIPSeq) based on direct ultrahigh-throughput DNA sequencing. This sequence census method was then used to map in vivo binding of the neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF; also known as REST, for repressor element-1 silencing transcription factor) to 1946 locations in the human genome. The data display sharp resolution of binding position [+/-50 base pairs (bp)], which facilitated our finding motifs and allowed us to identify noncanonical NRSF-binding motifs. These ChIPSeq data also have high sensitivity and specificity [ROC (receiver operator characteristic) area >/= 0.96] and statistical confidence (P <10(-4)), properties that were important for inferring new candidate interactions. These include key transcription factors in the gene network that regulates pancreatic islet cell development."

However, whether satellite cells are stem cells, committed progenitors, or dedifferentiated myoblasts has remained unclear. Using Myf5-Cre and ROSA26-YFP Cre-reporter alleles, we observed that in vivo 10% of sublaminar Pax7-expressing satellite cells have never expressed Myf5. Moreover, we found that Pax7+/Myf5− satellite cells gave rise to Pax7+/Myf5+ satellite cells through apical-basal oriented divisions that asymmetrically generated a basal Pax7+/Myf5− and an apical Pax7+/Myf5+ cells. Prospective isolation and transplantation into muscle revealed that whereas Pax7+/Myf5+ cells exhibited precocious differentiation, Pax7+/Myf5− cells extensively contributed to the satellite cell reservoir throughout the injected muscle. Therefore, we conclude that satellite cells are a heterogeneous population composed of stem cells and committed progenitors. These results provide critical insights into satellite cell biology and open new avenues for therapeutic treatment of neuromuscular diseases.

These results provide critical insights into satellite cell biology and open new avenues for therapeutic treatment of neuromuscular diseases. Satellite cells reside in a niche beneath the basal lamina closely juxtaposed to the muscle fiber, and are responsible for the growth, maintenance, and repair of postnatal skeletal muscle. Satellite cells are normally mitotically quiescent but are activated (i.e., enter the cell cycle) in response to stress induced by weight bearing or by trauma such as injury. The descendants of activated satellite cells, called myogenic precursor cells, undergo multiple rounds of division prior to terminal differentiation and fusion to form multinucleated myofibers. Activated satellite cells also generate progeny that restore the pool of quiescent satellite cells. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating satellite cell self-renewal and differentiation remain poorly understood (McKinnell et al., 2005McKinnell I.W. Parise G. Rudnicki M.A. Muscle stem cells and regenerative myogenesis.Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2005; 71: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Early experiments using quail-chick chimeras suggested that satellite cells were derived from the somite (Armand et al., 1983Armand O. Boutineau A.M. Mauger A. Pautou M.P. Kieny M. Origin of satellite cells in avian skeletal muscles.Arch. Anat. Microsc. Morphol. Exp. 1983; 72: 163-181PubMed Google Scholar). Recent experiments support this work and indicate that a significant proportion of the progenitors of satellite cells originate in embryonic somites as Pax3/Pax7-expressing cells (Ben-Yair and Kalcheim, 2005Ben-Yair R.

In addition, satellite cells may also be derived from cells associated with the embryonic vasculature including the dorsal aorta (De Angelis et al., 1999De Angelis L. Berghella L. Coletta M.

However, whether satellite cells are stem cells, committed progenitors, or dedifferentiated myoblasts remains unresolved. Satellite cells are widely considered to be a homogeneous population of committed muscle progenitors (Bischoff, 1994Bischoff R. The satellite cell and muscle regeneration.in: Engel A.G. Franzini-Armstrong C. Myology. McGraw-Hill, New York1994: 97-118Google Scholar). However, several studies have raised the possibility that the satellite cell compartment may be a heterogeneous population. Radioisotope labeling of growing rat muscle revealed that satellite cells are a mixture of 80% fast-cycling cells and 20% slow-cycling “reserve cells” (Schultz, 1996Schultz E. Satellite cell proliferative compartments in growing skeletal muscles.Dev. Biol. 1996; 175: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Examination of the expression of satellite cell markers CD34, M-cadherin, and Myf5-nLacZ in freshly prepared myofibers suggested that a subpopulation of satellite cells exhibits heterogeneous expression of these markers (Beauchamp et al., 2000Beauchamp J.R. Heslop L. Yu D.S. Tajbakhsh S. Kelly R.G. Wernig A. Buckingham M.E. Partridge T.A. Zammit P.S. Expression of CD34 and myf5 defines the majority of quiescent adult skeletal muscle satellite cells.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1221-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). However, the molecular identity of any potential subpopulations has not been defined, and the prospective isolation and characterization of these cells has not been achieved. Transplantation of the cultured primary myoblasts into regenerating muscle typically results in extensive loss of the transplanted cells, terminal differentiation of the surviving cells, and virtually no contribution to the satellite cell compartment (Beauchamp et al., 1999Beauchamp J.R. Morgan J.E. Pagel C.N. Partridge T.A. Dynamics of myoblast transplantation reveal a discrete minority of precursors with stem cell-like properties as the myogenic source.J.

By contrast, experiments involving transplant of intact fibers carrying satellite cells (Collins et al., 2005Collins C.A. Olsen I. Zammit P.S. Heslop L. Petrie A. Partridge T.A. Morgan J.E.

Direct isolation of satellite cells for skeletal muscle regeneration.Science. 2005; 309: 2064-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar) have suggested that at least some portion of satellite cells have the capacity to repopulate the satellite cell compartment as well as extensively contribute to regenerating muscle. In the present study, we report the existence of hierarchical subpopulations of satellite cells that are distinct in phenotype and function. We document that sublaminar satellite cells expressing Pax7 are heterogeneous based on Myf5 expression. Satellite cells that express Pax7 but not Myf5 give rise to Myf5-expressing cells through sublaminar cell divisions in a basal-apical orientation. Finally, we observe that Pax7+/Myf5− satellite cells are capable of efficiently contributing to the satellite cell reservoir following prospective isolation and transplantation into Pax7−/− muscle. Together, these experiments demonstrate that satellite cells are a heterogeneous population composed of stem cells and committed myogenic progenitors. Satellite cells uniformly express Pax7 (Seale et al., 2000Seale P. Sabourin L.A. Girgis-Gabardo A. Mansouri A. Gruss P. Rudnicki M.A. Pax7 is required for the specification of myogenic satellite cells.Cell. 2000; 102: 777-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar) and have been suggested to express the Myf5-nLacZ knockin allele in the quiescent sublaminar state (Beauchamp et al., 2000Beauchamp J.R. Heslop L. Yu D.S. Tajbakhsh S. Kelly R.G. Wernig A. Buckingham M.E. Partridge T.A. Zammit P.S. Expression of CD34 and myf5 defines the majority of quiescent adult skeletal muscle satellite cells.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1221-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that Myf5 transcription occurs in satellite cells that had undergone commitment to the myogenic lineage. We reasoned that if we could detect satellite cells that had not expressed Myf5, these would represent a candidate stem cell of the satellite cell compartment. We first examined whether all satellite cells expressing Pax7 also express Myf5 in single myofiber preparations fixed immediately following isolation from extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles of Myf5-nLacZ mice. Immunohistological analysis revealed that the majority of satellite cells contained readily detectable levels of Pax7 and β-Gal proteins. Notably, 13 ± 4% (n = 3 mice, > 100 cells/mouse) of Pax7+ satellite cells did not contain detectable levels of β-Gal, indicating that Myf5 was not uniformly expressed (Figure 1A). To investigate whether the Pax7+/β-Gal− satellite cells reflect a transient downregulation of Myf5 or represent a distinct population that never expressed Myf5, we employed the Cre-LoxP system to genetically mark cells that have expressed Myf5. We generated heterozygous mice carrying a Myf5-Cre allele (Tallquist et al., 2000Tallquist M.D. Weismann K.E. Hellstrom M. Soriano P. Early myotome specification regulates PDGFA expression and axial skeleton development.Development. 2000; 127: 5059-5070PubMed Google Scholar) and a Cre-dependent YFP reporter knocked into the ubiquitously expressed ROSA26 locus (Srinivas et al., 2001Srinivas S. Watanabe T. Lin C.S. William C.M. Tanabe Y. Jessell T.M. Costantini F. Cre reporter strains produced by targeted insertion of EYFP and ECFP into the ROSA26 locus.BMC Dev. Biol. 2001; 1: 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (2135) Google Scholar; Figure S1A). In the Myf5-Cre/ROSA-YFP mice, any satellite cells that have once expressed Myf5-Cre should express YFP irreversibly. Conversely, any cells that are YFP− should have never expressed Myf5-Cre in the past. Analysis of myofibers isolated from Myf5-Cre/ROSA-YFP EDL muscle demonstrated that 90 ± 2% of satellite cells expressing Pax7 also expressed YFP. Importantly, 10 ± 2% (n = 18 mice, >100 cells/mouse) of Pax7+ satellite cells did not contain detectable levels of YFP, confirming that these cells never expressed Myf5 (Figure 1B). The relative proportion of Pax7+/YFP− satellite cells persisted in muscle in mice up to 6 months old (Figures 1C and 1D). Similar proportions of β-Gal-positive and -negative satellite cells were observed when Myf5-Cre/ROSA26R3 reporter mice that express β-Gal only in the presence of Myf5-Cre were examined (Figure S1B). By contrast, all Pax7+ satellite cells were also YFP+ in Pax3-Cre/ROSA-YFP mice (n = 4 mice, data not shown), confirming the efficacy of the Cre-LoxP system and the notion that satellite cells are derived from embryonic Pax3+/Pax7+ progenitors. To ask whether the Pax7+/Myf5− represent newborn satellite cells that have never undergone activation, we treated muscles with cardiotoxin (CTX) to induce the activation of satellite cells and muscle regeneration. We observed substantial numbers of both Pax7+/YFP− and Pax7+/β-Gal− cells in regenerating Myf5-Cre/ROSA-YFP and Myf5-nLacZ muscles, respectively (Figure S2). Many of the Pax7+/β-Gal− cells had incorporated BrdU, indicating they were undergoing DNA synthesis and hence were progressing through the cell cycle (Figure S2B). Therefore, the lack of Myf5 expression in satellite cells does not equate to quiescence. To confirm the satellite cell identity of the Pax7+/YFP− cells, we triple labeled Myf5-Cre/ROSA-YFP muscle sections with antibodies to Pax7, YFP, and laminin. All Pax7+/YFP− cells were located beneath the basal lamina in a satellite cell position (Figure 1E). Furthermore, Pax7+/YFP− and Pax7+/β-Gal− cells were found to express typical satellite cell markers including CD34, M-Cad, Syn4, and NCAM (Figure S3). These data confirm that sublaminar satellite cells are a heterogeneous population on the basis of Myf5 expression. To further characterize Pax7+/YFP− and Pax7+/YFP+ satellite cells, we developed a method to prospectively isolate the different satellite cell subpopulations based on the previously reported approach using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) with antibody reactive with the cell-surface protein α7-integrin (int; Blanco-Bose et al., 2001Blanco-Bose W.E. Yao C.C. Kramer R.H. Blau H.M. Purification of mouse primary myoblasts based on alpha 7 integrin expression.Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 265: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Immunostaining of isolated myofibers confirmed that α7- and its dimerization partner β1-int were expressed on both YFP− and YFP+ satellite cells (Figures S4A and S4B). Initially, we employed positive selection for α7-int, together with negative selection (Lin−, for Sca1, CD31, CD45). FACS analysis of mononuclear cells from Myf5-Cre/ROSA-YFP muscle revealed that the α7-int+ fraction contained both YFP+ and YFP− cells (Figure S4B, right column). RT-PCR analysis indicated that mRNA for Pax7, Myf5, and Cre were only present in the α7-int+ fraction (Figure S4C), suggesting that the α7-int+ fraction contained all the Pax7+ satellite cells. However, only 20 ± 5% (n = 4) FACS-isolated α7-int+Lin−YFP− cells were Pax7+; therefore, we introduced β1-int as a second positive-selection marker and further narrowed the gating based on the side-scatter (SSC) range of satellite cells. Next, we isolated the YFP+/α7β1-int+/Lin− and the YFP−/α7β1-int+/Lin− (termed YFP+ and YFP− hereafter) cells by FACS (Figure 2A). Immunostaining of freshly sorted cells revealed that 90 ± 1% (n = 3) of the YFP+ cells expressed detectable levels of Pax7, whereas 67 ± 9% (n = 3) of YFP− cells expressed Pax7 (Figure 2B). Therefore, we established an approach for the prospective isolation of the different satellite cell subpopulations with a high degree of purity. RT-PCR analysis of YFP+ cells confirmed expression of Pax7, Myf5, Cre, and YFP mRNAs. By contrast, YFP− cells expressed similar levels of Pax7 but did not express Myf5, Cre, or YFP (Figure 2C). Importantly, Myf5 protein was readily detectable in the FACS-purified YFP+ but not in the YFP− cells (Figure 2D). Together, these data directly confirmed that the YFP− cells did not express Myf5 at either mRNA or protein level. To investigate the developmental origin and relationship between the Pax7+/Myf5− and Pax7+/Myf5+ cells, we examined the satellite cell progenitors in the somites and limb buds of E11.5 embryos. Interestingly, about 10% of Pax7-expressing cells in the dermamyotome and migrating progenitors near the limb bud were YFP− among the large majority of YFP+ progenitors (Figure S5A and S5B). To analyze the clonal growth of satellite cells on isolated myofibers in vitro, individual myofibers were isolated from Myf5-Cre/ROSA-YFP EDL muscle and cultured in suspension under growth conditions for 1–3 days. Typically, satellite cells undergo their first cell division at around 24 hr and form 4–8 cell aggregates within 3 days. Live-imaging analysis confirmed that these aggregates were of clonal origin (not shown). After 3 days of culture almost all clones uniformly expressed YFP, but the levels of Pax7 within each clone were variable (Figure 3A). Importantly, nearly 10% of the clones contained both Pax7+/YFP− and Pax7+/YFP+ cells at day 3 (Figure 3B) and day 2 (Figure 3C; 6 out of 70 clones from 4 experiments). Since a colony of mixed YFP+ and YFP− cells can only be derived from a common YFP− progenitor, these results indicate that Pax7+/Myf5− cells can form additional Pax7+/Myf5− satellite cells as well as give rise to Pax7+/Myf5+ satellite cells. To confirm that Pax7+/Myf5− cells give rise to Pax7+/Myf5+ cells, we conducted time-lapse imaging analysis of satellite cell division on cultured Myf5-Cre/ROSA-YFP myofibers. We observed that single YFP− satellite cells directly gave rise to one YFP− and one YFP+ cell (Figure 4; Movie S1). Furthermore, we examined expression of MyoD, an established marker for myogenic commitment and differentiation. Notably, Pax7+/YFP− cells did not express MyoD (Figure S5C), consistent with the hypothesis that Pax7+/YFP− cells have yet to undergo myogenic commitment. To examine satellite cell divisions within their natural niche, we developed an approach to analyze satellite cell proliferation in vivo. Typically, induction of muscle regeneration with CTX results in death of myofibers and massive immunoinfiltration, making it technically difficult to isolate viable myofibers. Therefore, we instead isolated fibers from the adjacent EDL muscle 4–5 days following CTX injection into the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle. We found that this approach allowed us to isolate viable myofibers containing numerous satellite cells that were undergoing cell division in vivo (Figure 3D). Numerous doublets of sister cells (double arrows in Figure 3D) were observed beneath the basal lamina on viable regenerating myofibers, which contained long arrays of centrally located nuclei (Figure 3D). The close physical proximity of the cells within each doublet, the expression of proliferation markers in both cells (Ki67 and phospho-H3; Figures 3G and 3H), and their sublaminar localization within the same satellite cell niche (Refer to Figures 5C and 5D) evidence the clonal origin of these doublet sister cells. The vast majority of the doublets in Myf5-Cre/ROSA-YFP mice displayed identical expression of Pax7 and YFP (Figure 3E). Nonetheless, we identified doublets of proliferating cells with one Pax7+/YFP− cell and one Pax7+/YFP+ cell (Figure 3F), presumably derived from a common Pax7+/YFP− progenitor. Altogether, our in vivo and in vitro analyses support the notion that Pax7+/Myf5− cells give rise to both Pax7+/Myf5− and Pax7+/Myf5+ cells and therefore represent a reservoir that maintains a hierarchical composition of the satellite cell compartment. We next investigated whether the fate of daughter cells is determined by their relative orientation within the satellite cell compartment. Theoretically, sister cells can either be in a planar orientation where both cells remain in direct contact with the basal lamina and host myofiber (Figure 5A) or in an apical-basal orientation where one daughter cell is pushed toward the basal lamina and the other cell apically toward the host myofiber (Figure 5B). Examination of myofibers isolated from regenerating EDL muscle revealed doublets of sister satellite cells beneath the basal lamina in both planar and apical-basal orientations (Figures 5C and 5D). Doublets of cells within the satellite cell niche were predominantly planar in orientation (91%, n = 248 pairs). Planar divisions were observed to give rise almost exclusively (92%, n = 89 pairs) to identical daughter cells that were either both Pax7+/Myf5− or both Pax7+/Myf5+, as reported by Myf5-nLacZ and ROSA-YFP reporter mice (Figures 5A, 5E, and 5G). Strikingly, we observed apical-basal oriented doublets where the sister cells assumed asymmetric cell fates (82%, n = 38 pairs; Figure 5B). The majority of apical-basal oriented doublets contained a Pax7+/Myf5− cell against the basal surface and a Pax7+/Myf5+ cell located on the apical side against the muscle fiber (Figures 5F, 5H, and S6–S7). In addition, we observed rare events where the basal cell expressed Pax7 and Myf5 and the apical cell had downregulated Pax7 and was presumably undergoing terminal differentiation (Figure S7). Taken together, these results demonstrate that satellite cell niche plays an important role in the maintenance of stem cell identity of newly divided daughter cells. The daughter cell attached to the basal lamina remains Myf5−, whereas the daughter that loses contact with the basal lamina upregulates Myf5 and becomes a committed myogenic cell. To further explore the signaling mechanism underlying the apical-basal asymmetric self-renewal of satellite stem cells, we conducted gene-expression analysis of FACS-purified YFP+ and YFP− satellite cells. Importantly, YFP+ cells expressed the Notch ligand Delta-1 whereas YFP− cells did not (Figure 6A). Moreover, YFP− cells but not YFP+ cells expressed high levels of Notch-3 (Figure 6A). By contrast, Notch-1 and Notch-2 receptors and the Notch signaling inhibitor Numb were equally expressed in both cell types. Immunostaining of isolated myofibers revealed that Delta-1 was expressed at high levels in Pax7+/Myf5+ satellite cells but low levels in Pax7+/Myf5− cells (Figure 6B). In cultured satellite cells, Delta-1 expression was upregulated in Myf5+ but not in Myf5− cells (Figure 6C). In newly divided cells, high-level Delta-1 expression was observed specifically in Myf5-expressing cells (Figures 6C–6D). To directly test the role of Notch signaling in satellite cell self-renewal, we treated proliferating satellite cells on freshly isolated myofibers with DAPT, an inhibitor of γ-secretase that is necessary for Notch signaling. DAPT treatment significantly reduced the total number of cells after 3 days of culture. Importantly, Pax7+/MyoD− satellite cells were markedly reduced in number following DAPT treatment. By contrast, the percentage of Pax7−/MyoD+ cells was significantly increased (Figure 6E). Together, these results strongly suggest that Notch signaling plays a critical role in the maintenance of Pax7+/YFP− satellite cells in an undifferentiated stem cell state. Our experiments provided compelling evidence that satellite cells are a hierarchal population composed of Pax7+/Myf5− and Pax7+/Myf5+ satellite cells. To examine the biological function of these two subpopulations of satellite cells, we transplanted FACS-purified YFP+ and YFP− satellite cells from Myf5-Cre/ROSA-YFP mice into Pax7−/− muscle and assessed: (1) their ability to terminally differentiate and (2) their contribution to the satellite cell compartment. Notably, Pax7−/− mice lack functional satellite cells (Kuang et al., 2006Kuang S. Charge S.B. Seale P. Huh M. Rudnicki M.A. Distinct roles for Pax7 and Pax3 in adult regenerative myogenesis.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, Seale et al., 2000Seale P. Sabourin L.A. Girgis-Gabardo A. Mansouri A. Gruss P. Rudnicki M.A. Pax7 is required for the specification of myogenic satellite cells.Cell. 2000; 102: 777-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar). Therefore, the transplanted cells can readily colonize the unoccupied satellite cell niche. Three weeks after transplantation (900–10,000 cells/TA muscle), we observed donor-derived cells as indicated by the expression of YFP or Pax7 (n = 6 animals in each group). Both YFP+ and YFP− donor cells were capable of undergoing terminal differentiation as revealed by the presence YFP+ myofibers (Figures 7A and 7B). Transplantation of YFP+ cells typically gave rise to clusters of 20–60 YFP+ myofibers at the injection site, whereas transplanted YFP− cells formed 0–22 YFP+ fibers. Furthermore, we observed in half of the transplanted muscles (n = 6) a massive accumulation of cells (DAPI nuclei in Figures 7A and 7E) surrounding the newly formed YFP+ myofibers, suggesting a host immune reaction against donor cells. Little or no immune reaction was observed in muscle transplanted with YFP− cells (Figures 7B, 7D, and 7F). These data indicate that YFP+ donor cells readily differentiated following transplantation. Transplanted YFP− cells efficiently gave rise to both Pax7+/YFP− and Pax7+/YFP+ satellite cells (94 ± 32 cells/section/10000 Pax7+ cells injected or 13 ± 3 cells/cross-section, n = 6 mice). Many YFP− satellite cells were observed to have migrated large distances into the host muscle tissue, and were located in sublaminar positions (Figures 7D and 7F). By contrast, transplanted YFP+ cells only occasionally gave rise to Pax7+/YFP+ satellite cells (12 ± 7 cells/section/10000 Pax7+ cells injected or 4 ± 2 cells/cross-section, n = 6 mice), and these were virtually all associated with the new YFP+ myofibers formed at the injection site (Figure 7C). Rare mononuclear YFP+ cells were also observed in interstitial spaces between fibers (Figure 7E). Finally, we assessed the relative repopulating efficiency of YFP− and YFP+ cells after engrafting myofibers isolated from Myf5-Cre/ROSA-YFP mice into Pax7−/− recipients. We hypothesized that the relative ratio of reconstituted YFP− and YFP+ satellite cells should remain unchanged or decline if both populations repopulate equally well (given that some YFP− can turn into YFP+ cells). Ten freshly isolated EDL myofibers containing 7% YFP− and 93% YFP+ satellite cells were grafted into the TA muscle of Pax7−/− mice. Four weeks later, the satellite cells derived from the grafted fibers differentiated into bundles of 20–100 YFP+ myofibers and also gave rise to numerous Pax7+ satellite cells (14.7 ± 2.5 cells/cross-section, three mice; Figure S8). Importantly, 24 ± 8% of engrafted Pax7+ satellite cells remained YFP−. Most of these YFP− satellite cells had migrated away from the injection site and infiltrated the surrounding muscle tissue to repopulate the host muscle. By contrast, almost all of the YFP+ satellite cells remained at the injection site (Figure S8). Consistent with the notion that Pax7+/Myf5− satellite cells represent a stem cell population within the satellite cell compartment, YFP− satellite cells rapidly expanded in number as they repopulated the vacant satellite cell niche in Pax7−/− muscle. Together, these data indicate that transplanted Pax7+/Myf5+ satellite cells preferentially undergo terminal differentiation, whereas transplanted Pax7+/Myf5− satellite cells extensively contribute to the satellite compartment and give rise to both classes of satellite cells. Therefore, we conclude that the Pax7+/Myf5− satellite cells represent a novel population of stem cells that actively maintain the homeostatic composition of stem cells and committed progenitors within the satellite cell niche. Previously, our laboratory found that satellite cells uniformly express the transcription factor Pax7 (Seale et al., 2000Seale P. Sabourin L.A. Girgis-G"

https://openalex.org/W2015870609,"Despite twenty years of research, the phase diagram of high-transition-temperature superconductors remains enigmatic. A central issue is the origin of the differences in the physical properties of these copper oxides doped to opposite sides of the superconducting region. In the overdoped regime, the material behaves as a reasonably conventional metal, with a large Fermi surface. The underdoped regime, however, is highly anomalous and appears to have no coherent Fermi surface, but only disconnected 'Fermi arcs'. The fundamental question, then, is whether underdoped copper oxides have a Fermi surface, and if so, whether it is topologically different from that seen in the overdoped regime. Here we report the observation of quantum oscillations in the electrical resistance of the oxygen-ordered copper oxide YBa2Cu3O6.5, establishing the existence of a well-defined Fermi surface in the ground state of underdoped copper oxides, once superconductivity is suppressed by a magnetic field. The low oscillation frequency reveals a Fermi surface made of small pockets, in contrast to the large cylinder characteristic of the overdoped regime. Two possible interpretations are discussed: either a small pocket is part of the band structure specific to YBa2Cu3O6.5 or small pockets arise from a topological change at a critical point in the phase diagram. Our understanding of high-transition-temperature (high-T(c)) superconductors will depend critically on which of these two interpretations proves to be correct."

However, the climate models predict that global precipitation will increase at a much slower rate of 1 to 3% per kelvin. A recent analysis of satellite observations does not support this prediction of a muted response of precipitation to global warming. Rather, the observations suggest that precipitation and total atmospheric water have increased at about the same rate over the past two decades."
https://openalex.org/W2052400143,"With every beat of the heart, inflation of the lung or peristalsis of the gut, cell types of diverse function are subjected to substantial stretch. Stretch is a potent stimulus for growth, differentiation, migration, remodelling and gene expression. Here, we report that in response to transient stretch the cytoskeleton fluidizes in such a way as to define a universal response class. This finding implicates mechanisms mediated not only by specific signalling intermediates, as is usually assumed, but also by non-specific actions of a slowly evolving network of physical forces. These results support the idea that the cell interior is at once a crowded chemical space and a fragile soft material in which the effects of biochemistry, molecular crowding and physical forces are complex and inseparable, yet conspire nonetheless to yield remarkably simple phenomenological laws. These laws seem to be both universal and primitive, and thus comprise a striking intersection between the worlds of cell biology and soft matter physics."
https://openalex.org/W1994634031,"Ras proteins signal through direct interaction with a number of effector enzymes, including type I phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinases. Although the ability of Ras to control PI 3-kinase has been well established in manipulated cell culture models, evidence for a role of the interaction of endogenous Ras with PI 3-kinase in normal and malignant cell growth in vivo has been lacking. Here we generate mice with mutations in the Pi3kca gene encoding the catalytic p110α isoform that block its interaction with Ras. Cells from these mice show proliferative defects and selective disruption of signaling from growth factors to PI 3-kinase. The mice display defective development of the lymphatic vasculature, resulting in perinatal appearance of chylous ascites. Most importantly, they are highly resistant to endogenous Ras oncogene-induced tumorigenesis. The interaction of Ras with p110α is thus required in vivo for certain normal growth factor signaling and for Ras-driven tumor formation."

https://openalex.org/W1965129178,"In cells undergoing apoptosis, mitochondrial outer-membrane permeabilization (MOMP) is followed by caspase activation promoted by released cytochrome c. Although caspases mediate the apoptotic phenotype, caspase inhibition is generally not sufficient for survival following MOMP; instead cells undergo a ""caspase-independent cell death"" (CICD). Thus, MOMP may represent a point of commitment to cell death. Here, we identify glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as a critical regulator of CICD. GAPDH-expressing cells preserved their clonogenic potential following MOMP, provided that caspase activation was blocked. GAPDH-mediated protection of cells from CICD involved an elevation in glycolysis and a nuclear function that correlated with and was replaced by an increase in Atg12 expression. Consistent with this, protection from CICD reflected an increase in and a dependence upon autophagy, associated with a transient decrease in mitochondrial mass. Therefore, GAPDH mediates an elevation in glycolysis and enhanced autophagy that cooperate to protect cells from CICD."
https://openalex.org/W2054860087,"Pairing of electrons in conventional superconductors occurs at the superconducting transition temperature T(c), creating an energy gap Delta in the electronic density of states (DOS). In the high-T(c) superconductors, a partial gap in the DOS exists for a range of temperatures above T(c) (ref. 2). A key question is whether the gap in the DOS above T(c) is associated with pairing, and what determines the temperature at which incoherent pairs form. Here we report the first spatially resolved measurements of gap formation in a high-T(c) superconductor, measured on Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+delta samples with different T(c) values (hole concentration of 0.12 to 0.22) using scanning tunnelling microscopy. Over a wide range of doping from 0.16 to 0.22 we find that pairing gaps nucleate in nanoscale regions above T(c). These regions proliferate as the temperature is lowered, resulting in a spatial distribution of gap sizes in the superconducting state. Despite the inhomogeneity, we find that every pairing gap develops locally at a temperature T(p), following the relation 2Delta/k(B)T(p) = 7.9 +/- 0.5. At very low doping (< or =0.14), systematic changes in the DOS indicate the presence of another phenomenon, which is unrelated and perhaps competes with electron pairing. Our observation of nanometre-sized pairing regions provides the missing microscopic basis for understanding recent reports of fluctuating superconducting response above T(c) in hole-doped high-T(c) copper oxide superconductors."

We show that loss or reduced expression of death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) underlies cases of heritable predisposition to CLL and the majority of sporadic CLL. Epigenetic silencing of DAPK1 by promoter methylation occurs in almost all sporadic CLL cases. Furthermore, we defined a disease haplotype, which segregates with the CLL phenotype in a large family. DAPK1 expression of the CLL allele is downregulated by 75% in germline cells due to increased HOXB7 binding. In the blood cells from affected family members, promoter methylation results in additional loss of DAPK1 expression. Thus, reduced expression of DAPK1 can result from germline predisposition, as well as epigenetic or somatic events causing or contributing to the CLL phenotype."

The MBT domain is structurally related to protein domains that directly bind methylated histone residues. Consistent with this, we found that the L3MBTL1 MBT domains compact nucleosomal arrays dependent on mono- and dimethylation of histone H4 lysine 20 and of histone H1b lysine 26.

Chromatin, the organized assemblage of histones and genomic DNA, is critical to the proper regulation of cellular processes associated with DNA metabolism, including transcription. Covalent histone modifications, chromatin remodeling, and histone exchange contribute to dynamic chromatin structure changes that impact transcriptional regulation. Silencing of gene expression is partially achieved by transient or stable condensation of the chromatin structure (facultative or constitutive heterochromatin, respectively), which renders DNA inaccessible to the transcription machinery. Histone lysine methyltransferases (HKMTs) that target H3K9, H3K27, and H4K20 are important for the establishment and maintenance of heterochromatin, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive (Sims et al., 2003Sims 3rd, R.J. Nishioka K. Reinberg D. Histone lysine methylation: a signature for chromatin function.Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 629-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). These histone lysine methylation marks serve as recognition sites for chromatin-binding proteins (“readers”), which may directly compact chromatin structure or recruit other chromatin-effector proteins. The linker histone H1 is thought to be an important mediator of higher-order chromatin structure (Bednar et al., 1995Bednar J. Horowitz R.A. Dubochet J. Woodcock C.L.

Recently, lysine 26 was identified as a target for acetylation and methylation within the histone H1 variant H1b/H1.4/H1s-4 (H1bK26; Kuzmichev et al., 2004Kuzmichev A. Jenuwein T. Tempst P.

Histone modifications such as H3K27 methylation, H3K9 dimethylation (H3K9me2), and H4K20 monomethylation (H4K20me1) are commonly found in facultative heterochromatin (Sims et al., 2003Sims 3rd, R.J.

Methylated H3K27 is recognized by Polycomb, a component of Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1). However, recently PRC1 was shown to compact nucleosomal arrays in vitro independent of H3K27 methylation or histone tails (Francis et al., 2004Francis N.J. Kingston R.E. Woodcock C.L. Chromatin compaction by a polycomb group protein complex.Science. 2004; 306: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). H3K9 di- and trimethylation are directly recognized by HP1 (Bannister et al., 2001Bannister A.J. Zegerman P. Partridge J.F. Miska E.A. Thomas J.O. Allshire R.C. Kouzarides T.

Specificity of the HP1 chromo domain for the methylated N-terminus of histone H3.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5232-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). HP1 localizes to facultative and constitutive heterochromatin, associates with the H3K9-specific HKMT SUV39H1 (Schotta et al., 2002Schotta G. Ebert A. Krauss V. Fischer A. Hoffmann J. Rea S. Jenuwein T. Dorn R. Reuter G.

HP1 binding to chromatin is highly dynamic and in some instances is independent of H3K9 methylation (Meehan et al., 2003Meehan R.R. Kao C.F. Pennings S. HP1 binding to native chromatin in vitro is determined by the hinge region and not by the chromodomain.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3164-3174Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Of the three mammalian HP1 isoforms, HP1α and -β are predominantly associated with constitutive heterochromatin, and HP1γ is found in euchromatin and facultative heterochromatin (Minc et al., 2000Minc E. Courvalin J.C. Buendia B. HP1gamma associates with euchromatin and heterochromatin in mammalian nuclei and chromosomes.Cytogenet.

In contrast, the functional significance of H4K20me1 mediated by PR-SET7 (Nishioka et al., 2002Nishioka K. Rice J.C. Sarma K. Erdjument-Bromage H. Werner J. Wang Y. Chuikov S. Valenzuela P. Tempst P. Steward R. et al.PR-Set7 is a nucleosome-specific methyltransferase that modifies lysine 20 of histone H4 and is associated with silent chromatin.Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1201-1213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) remains far less understood. L3MBTL1 is of great interest in this context. The malignant-brain-tumor (MBT) domain was first described in the Drosophila tumor-suppressor protein L(3)mbt (Wismar et al., 1995Wismar J. Loffler T. Habtemichael N. Vef O. Geissen M. Zirwes R. Altmeyer W. Sass H. Gateff E. The Drosophila melanogaster tumor suppressor gene lethal(3)malignant brain tumor encodes a proline-rich protein with a novel zinc finger.Mech. Dev. 1995; 53: 141-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Recessive or temperature sensitive mutations of the D-l(3)mbt gene cause malignant transformation in the larval brain. Various mutations were found to impair synchronous cell division and mitotic progression in the early stages of Drosophila embryonic development (Yohn et al., 2003Yohn C.B. Pusateri L. Barbosa V. Lehmann R. l(3)malignant brain tumor and three novel genes are required for Drosophila germ-cell formation.Genetics. 2003; 165: 1889-1900PubMed Google Scholar). Human L3MBTL1 is a known transcriptional repressor (Boccuni et al., 2003Boccuni P. MacGrogan D. Scandura J.M. Nimer S.D. The human L(3)MBT polycomb group protein is a transcriptional repressor and interacts physically and functionally with TEL (ETV6).J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15412-15420Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), which requires its three MBT domains for silencing. A screen for novel chromatin-binding domains revealed that the second and third MBT domain of L3MBTL1 bound to monomethyl H3K4 and dimethyl H4K20 (Kim et al., 2006Kim J. Daniel J. Espejo A. Lake A. Krishna M. Xia L. Zhang Y. Bedford M.T. Tudor, MBT and chromo domains gauge the degree of lysine methylation.EMBO Rep. 2006; 4: 397-403Google Scholar). Another MBT family member, Drosophila Sfmbt, was recently shown to bind to mono- and dimethylated H3K9 and to dimethylated H4K20 peptides (Klymenko et al., 2006Klymenko T. Papp B. Fischle W. Kocher T. Schelder M. Fritsch C. Wild B. Wilm M. Muller J. A Polycomb group protein complex with sequence-specific DNA-binding and selective methyl-lysine-binding activities.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1110-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Yet, the functional implications of this binding event are not known. Using sucrose gradient sedimentation to reconstitute L3MBTL1-histone complexes followed by electron microscopy (EM) analyses, we demonstrate that L3MBTL1 compacts nucleosomal arrays in a manner that requires specific posttranslational modifications within core and/or linker histones. The second MBT domain of L3MBTL1 exclusively recognizes the mono- and dimethyl versions of both H4K20 and H1bK26, respectively. Our studies identify a novel mechanism for the readout of multiple lysine methylation marks within histones H1b, H3, and H4 via a singular complex of L3MBTL1 and HP1γ and suggest that a combinatorial pattern of histone modifications results in a direct functional outcome—specifically, chromatin condensation at Rb-regulated genes. The human L3MBTL1 (isoform 1) protein comprises 772 amino acids (∼100 kDa) and contains three identifiable domains (Figure 1A). To tackle the mechanistic aspects of L3MBTL1-mediated transcriptional repression (Boccuni et al., 2003Boccuni P. MacGrogan D. Scandura J.M. Nimer S.D. The human L(3)MBT polycomb group protein is a transcriptional repressor and interacts physically and functionally with TEL (ETV6).J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15412-15420Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), we generated a 293 cell line that constitutively expresses full-length L3MBTL1 containing a FLAG epitope at its C terminus (L3MBTL1-F). L3MBTL1-F and its associated proteins were identified after affinity purification from nuclear extracts (Figure 1A and see below). A cell line stably transfected with empty vector (mock) served as control. Silver staining revealed a number of polypeptides that specifically associate with L3MBTL1-F. These polypeptides were found to be core histones, histone H1b, HP1γ, and the Retinoblastoma protein (Rb; Figure 1A). To determine the functional relevance of core histones present in a complex with L3MBTL1, we first investigated whether their modifications contributed to this interaction. Nucleosomal arrays were reconstituted with bacterially expressed histones (recombinant chromatin) or histones purified from HeLa cells (native chromatin) and then incubated with a recombinant protein encompassing the three MBT repeats of L3MBTL1 fused to GST (GST-3MBT; Figure 1A). Initially the association of GST-3MBT with histones was analyzed by sucrose gradient sedimentation followed by EM. Fractions derived from the sucrose gradients were analyzed by western blot using anti-3MBT antibodies (Figure 1B). The GST-3MBT protein migrated near top of the gradient but shifted toward the bottom upon the addition of native chromatin templates (Figure 1B). Importantly, this shift was not observed in the presence of recombinant chromatin. A similar profile was observed upon inspection of the sedimentation profile of nucleosomal DNA (Figure 1C). The peak fractions from the sucrose gradient (see Figure 1C) were analyzed by EM to explore any visible changes to the chromatin template upon GST-3MBT binding. In the absence of GST-3MBT, recombinant and native nucleosomal arrays displayed a typical “beads on a string” configuration (11 nm fiber), confirming a proper chromatin reconstitution in both cases (Figure 1D). The recombinant chromatin was treated with the HAT-p300 and acetyl coenzyme A to allow acetylation and the establishment of 11 nm fibers (Loyola et al., 2001Loyola A. LeRoy G. Wang Y.H. Reinberg D. Reconstitution of recombinant chromatin establishes a requirement for histone-tail modifications during chromatin assembly and transcription.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2837-2851PubMed Google Scholar). Since the native and recombinant chromatin both contained acetylated residues (data not shown), we concluded that acetylation per se does not impair binding of MBT to chromatin (see Experimental Procedures; Figures 1D, 2B, 5B, and 5C; Table 1). Strikingly, the native chromatin particles became highly compacted upon GST-3MBT addition (Figure 1D; magnified image of one compacted particle in upper right panel). Quantification of the observed structural changes revealed that ∼70% of the molecules became fully compacted by GST-3MBT (data not shown). In contrast, the recombinant nucleosome arrays were unaffected and remained in the 11 nm fiber configuration. Addition of GST protein alone was ineffectual (data not shown). L3MBTL1 can homodimerize via its SPM domain (Boccuni et al., 2003Boccuni P. MacGrogan D. Scandura J.M. Nimer S.D. The human L(3)MBT polycomb group protein is a transcriptional repressor and interacts physically and functionally with TEL (ETV6).J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15412-15420Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and GST-3MBT can do so through the GST domain. To analyze if dimerization was a factor, we produced a hexahistidine-tagged 3MBT protein (His-3MBT). Superdex-200 size-exclusion chromatography verified that His-3MBT was monomeric (Figure S1). The monomeric His-3MBT polypeptide also compacts native chromatin but not recombinant chromatin (Figure S2). We conclude that the 3MBT not only binds modified core histones in nucleosome arrays but also compacts these arrays in a strictly histone-modification-dependent manner. We next tested which, if any, of the six major histone-methylation sites on core histones is/are responsible for L3MBTL1 binding and compaction using, initially, peptide-affinity binding assays. GST-3MBT protein bound specifically to H4K20me1/2 but not to unmodified H4K20 or H4K20me3 (Figure 2A). GST-3MBT did not bind to methylated H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 peptides, but HP1γ bound to H3K9me2 (Figure S3), and hCHD1 bound to H3K4me (data not shown). Collectively these results establish that in peptide pull-down assays, GST-3MBT binds specifically to mono- and dimethylated H4K20. To address the chromatin-compaction potential of GST-3MBT in the context of H4K20me1 and nucleosome arrays, we employed PR-SET7, the enzyme that catalyzes the addition of a single methyl group to H4K20 (Nishioka et al., 2002Nishioka K. Rice J.C. Sarma K. Erdjument-Bromage H. Werner J. Wang Y. Chuikov S. Valenzuela P. Tempst P. Steward R. et al.PR-Set7 is a nucleosome-specific methyltransferase that modifies lysine 20 of histone H4 and is associated with silent chromatin.Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1201-1213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). PR-SET7 was used to methylate recombinant nucleosomal arrays in vitro, and subsequent addition of GST-3MBT protein was analyzed by sucrose gradient sedimentation. Only chromatin that was premethylated (+S-adenosyl-methionine [SAM]) induced a migration shift upon GST-3MBT addition (data not shown). Using EM, we observed a number of compacted chromatin particles as a function of GST-3MBT binding (Figure 2B; Table 1). We repeated these experiments using monomeric His-3MBT protein and observed a similar outcome, chromatin compaction (Table 1). This compaction was dependent on the presence of SAM, confirming that L3MBTL1 could bind and compact nucleosome arrays containing H4K20me1. We next explored the basis of HP1γ association with L3MBTL1. To score for specificity, we compared the proteins present in the L3MBTL1-F fraction to those associated with its two close homologs, L3MBTL2-F and L3MBTL3-F. We analyzed the association of HP1 using specific antibodies that discriminate between the three mammalian HP1 isoforms in western blot. Biochemical fractionation of cellular extracts revealed that HP1γ is more abundant in nuclear extracts compared to the α or β isoforms (Figure S4A; Nielsen et al., 2001Nielsen S.J. Schneider R. Bauer U.M. Bannister A.J. Morrison A. O'Carroll D. Firestein R. Cleary M. Jenuwein T. Herrera R.E. Kouzarides T. Rb targets histone H3 methylation and HP1 to promoters.Nature. 2001; 412: 561-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). HP1α and -β were not present, but HP1γ was detected in the L3MBTL1 and L3MBTL2 affinity-purified fractions (Figure 2C), a result consistent with previous findings (Ogawa et al., 2002Ogawa H. Ishiguro K. Gaubatz S. Livingston D.M. Nakatani Y. A complex with chromatin modifiers that occupies E2F- and Myc-responsive genes in G0 cells.Science. 2002; 296: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). This interaction is specific, as the L3MBTL3-F affinity-purified fraction was devoid of HP1γ. Using two antibodies from different sources, we also detected the human Rb protein within the affinity-purified L3MBTL1 and L3MBTL2 samples, but not in the case of L3MBTL3 (Figure 3A and data not shown). Anti-FLAG-immunoprecipitation of cotransfected cells demonstrates that HA-tagged HP1γ coimmunoprecipitated only in the presence of L3MBTL1-F (Figure 2D). As well, in-vitro-translated full-length L3MBTL1 precipitated with GST-HP1γ (Figure S4B). The N terminus of L3MBTL1 interacted with HP1γ (Figure 2E), but since these studies were performed using protein translated in vitro, we cannot conclude that the interaction is direct; however, we can rule out an indirect association mediated through core histones as these interact exclusively with the MBT domains and not the N-terminal region of L3MBTL1 (data not shown). Given the presence of H1b in the affinity-purified preparation of L3MBTL1-F, we analyzed for their interaction in vivo using cotransfection experiments in 293 cells with either L3MBTL1-F or L3MBTL2-F and HA-tagged histone H1b/H1.4 (H1b-HA). H1b coprecipitated with L3MBTL1-F but not with L3MBTL2-F using anti-FLAG antibodies (Figure 3A). A similar result was obtained in reciprocal immunoprecipitation assays (Figure S5). We analyzed if L3MBTL1-F interacts with additional H1 isotypes. Cotransfection experiments with the histone variants H1o/H1.0 were performed. Histone H1b, but not H1o, interacted with L3MBTL1-F (Figure 3B). Histone H1b can be methylated at lysine 26 (H1bK26me; Kuzmichev et al., 2005Kuzmichev A. Margueron R. Vaquero A. Preissner T.S.

Cell. 2004; 14: 183-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) did not immunoprecipitate with L3MBTL1-F (Figure 3C). Since all HP1 isoforms recognize and bind dimethylated H1b-K26 (Daujat et al., 2005Daujat S. Zeissler U. Waldmann T. Happel N. Schneider R. HP1 binds specifically to Lys26-methylated histone H1.4, whereas simultaneous Ser27 phosphorylation blocks HP1 binding.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38090-38095Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), the observed interaction of HP1γ with L3MBTL1-F (Figure 1A) could be mediated through its interaction with H1. However, the amount of endogenous HP1γ in the anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates was relatively similar regardless of whether H1b was coprecipitated or not (Figure 3C). Collectively, our data indicate that L3MBTL1 is associated with HP1γ, nucleosomes containing H4K20me1 and H1b and that the K26 residue of H1b is important for its interaction with L3MBTL1. Moreover, the presence of Rb in the L3MBTL1 complex suggests a means of directing L3MBTL1 to target genes. To determine if the interaction between L3MBTL1 and H1b is direct and if methylation of K26 is required, we initially used peptide-affinity chromatography. Affinity columns were generated with H1b peptides comprising residues 20–37 in which K26 was un-, mono-, di-, or trimethylated and incubated with GST-3MBT. GST-3MBT binds to the mono- and dimethylated peptides but not to the unmethylated or trimethylated versions (Figure 3D). We next tested GST-3MBT proteins containing single amino acid substitutions in each of the MBT domains (P1a, P2a, and P3a; Figure S6) at residues which are predicted to be important for binding (Wang et al., 2003Wang W.K. Tereshko V. Boccuni P. MacGrogan D. Nimer S.D. Patel D.J. Malignant brain tumor repeats: a three-leaved propeller architecture with ligand/peptide binding pockets.Structure. 2003; 11: 775-789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The P1a and P3a mutant proteins bound, but not the P2a mutant (Figure 3E). We expanded the binding studies and found that full-length in-vitro-translated L3MBTL1 protein bound mono- and dimethylated H1 peptides exclusively (Figure 3F and data not shown). Notably, the in-vitro-translated full-length P2a mutant protein (but not the recombinant GST-3MBT P2a mutant) migrates faster in SDS-PAGE; the reason for this is not known. In this experiment, we used a different set of mutant proteins, each with a single amino acid substitution (P1b, P2b, and P3b; Figure S6) and again observed that only mutation in the second MBT domain abolished interaction (Figure 3F). A point mutation in the third pocket led to decreased binding, suggesting that both pockets might cooperate in binding methylated histone lysines. Interestingly, the P2a mutation also abolished binding to H4K20me1, but the P2b mutant was unaffected (Figure 3F). These data suggest that both H1K26 and H4K20 are bound via the second MBT domain; however, a different set of residues seems to be involved in H1K26me versus H4K20me binding. To validate these findings, interaction experiments were performed using GST-3MBT and bacterially expressed full-length histone H1b containing an HA tag. As expected, bacterially produced (unmodified) H1b did not interact with GST-3MBT (data not shown). It was shown previously that G9a can dimethylate H3K9 and histone H1 in vitro (Tachibana et al., 2001Tachibana M. Sugimoto K. Fukushima T. Shinkai Y. Set domain-containing protein, G9a, is a novel lysine-preferring mammalian histone methyltransferase with hyperactivity and specific selectivity to lysines 9 and 27 of histone H3.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25309-25317Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). When G9a was used to methylate wild-type H1b and mutant H1bK26A proteins, GST-3MBT bound to G9a-methylated H1b but not to the methylation-deficient H1bK26A mutant. Kinetic and substrate-specificity studies determined that G9a is capable of mono- and dimethylation in a time-dependent manner (Patnaik et al., 2004Patnaik D. Chin H.G. Esteve P.O. Benner J. Jacobsen S.E. Pradhan S. Substrate specificity and kinetic mechanism of mammalian G9a histone H3 methyltransferase.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53248-53258Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Indeed, using an antibody that specifically recognizes H1bK26me2, we confirmed that G9a dimethylates H1K26 and that H1b dimethylated at K26 binds to GST-3MBT (Figure 4A). Of note, the H1b sequence containing lysine-26 is similar to the sequences surrounding H3K9 and H3K27 (ARKS). However, we did not observe binding of GST-3MBT to the H3K9 and H3K27 peptides, regardless of their methylation status (Figure S3). Collectively, our results show that the MBT repeats of L3MBTL1 directly interact with mono- or dimethylated histone H1bK26. Our results show that L3MBTL1 interacts with H1bK26me1/2. Histone H1 is implicated in the formation of higher-order chromatin and can function on its own in compaction of chromatin templates in vitro (Bednar et al., 1995Bednar J. Horowitz R.A. Dubochet J. Woodcock C.L. Chromatin conformation and salt-induced compaction: three-dimensional structural information from cryoelectron microscopy.J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1365-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We next investigated the role of the MBT domains in conjunction with H1 in this process. Recombinant or native histone H1b was incorporated onto spaced nucleosomes that were confirmed as such by MNase digestion (data not shown). Chromatin compaction in the presence or absence of GST-3MBT was analyzed by sucrose gradient sedimentation followed by EM as described above. Under the conditions used whereby recombinant core histones are acetylated with p300, a preparation of human histone H1 by itself did not efficiently compact the chromatin templates (Figure 4B, left panel). Remarkably, and in contrast to its inability to do so alone, GST-3MBT was observed to compact recombinant nucleosome arrays upon the incorporation of native, but not recombinant, H1 (Figure 4B, right panel; Table 1; data not shown).Table 1Quantification of Chromatin Compaction/Looping ExperimentsType of AssayProteins Incubated with Nucleosomal ArraysTotal Molecules AnalyzedLooping and Compaction (%)CompactionnH1− GST-3MBT80021.0+ GST-3MBT90045.0rH1b/G9a− SAM− GST-3MBT40015.5+ GST-3MBT40015.0+ SAM− GST-3MBT40014.75+ GST-3MBT40032.75PR-SET7− SAM− GST-3MBT50012.8+ GST-3MBT50013.4+ SAM− GST-3MBT60014.2+ GST-3MBT40039.75− His-3MBT60015.8+ His-3MBT (WT)60050.8+ His-3MBT (P2a)60026.1+ His-3MBT (P2b)60033.3Looping− GST-3MBT10004.6+ GST-3MBT100035.6+ GST-3MBT (P2)40015.75+ GST-3MBT (P1, P2, P3)4006.5+ His-3MBT-C2HC50035.2+ His-3MBT50017.8Compaction assays have been performed using recombinant reconstituted nucleosomes, and looping assays have been performed with native nucleosomal arrays (subsaturating amounts of octamers).

The native H1 preparation that successfully gave rise to compacted molecules in a GST-3MBT-dependent manner is presumably comprised of different H1 variants with multiple posttranslational modifications. Thus, the compaction assay was repeated using recombinant H1b that was methylated by G9a before incorporation into nucleosomes. GST-3MBT compacted a significant number of these particles (Figure 4C; Table 1). Two types of molecules were generally observed. In one case, the molecules contained a loop, the other type of molecules did not loop, but the array appeared to be compacted (Figure 4C). Regardless, the increase in looping and/or compaction was dependent on H1b methylation (Table 1).

When adults perform mental arithmetic, they activate nonsymbolic, approximate number representations, and their performance suffers if this nonsymbolic system is impaired. Nonsymbolic number representations also allow adults, children, and even infants to add or subtract pairs of dot arrays and to compare the resulting sum or difference to a third array, provided that only approximate accuracy is required. Here we report that young children, who have mastered verbal counting and are on the threshold of arithmetic instruction, can build on their nonsymbolic number system to perform symbolic addition and subtraction. Children across a broad socio-economic spectrum solved symbolic problems involving approximate addition or subtraction of large numbers, both in a laboratory test and in a school setting. Aspects of symbolic arithmetic therefore lie within the reach of children who have learned no algorithms for manipulating numerical symbols. Our findings help to delimit the sources of children's difficulties learning symbolic arithmetic, and they suggest ways to enhance children's engagement with formal mathematics."

We have emulated this chance occurrence by extending the host range accessible to the human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes by the intestinal route to include the mouse. Analyzing the recognition complex of the listerial invasion protein InlA and its human receptor E-cadherin, we postulated and verified amino acid substitutions in InlA to increase its affinity for E-cadherin.

By rationally adapting a single protein, we thus create a versatile murine model of human listeriosis. The constant interaction of humans with countless micro-organisms has led to the evolution of an intricate, multifaceted, and remarkably efficient immune system. Pathogens have, however, coevolved, refining their arsenal of pathogenicity factors to exploit loop holes in the host's defenses (Akira et al., 2006Akira S. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Pathogen recognition and innate immunity.Cell. 2006; 124: 783-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7879) Google Scholar). This dedicated specialization of pathogens restricts their choice of alternative hosts and limits the usefulness of animal models to study human pathogens in vivo. Molecular mechanisms defining host tropism have been identified for a limited number of pathogens, including the food-borne human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes (Hamon et al., 2006Hamon M. Bierne H. Cossart P. Listeria monocytogenes: A multifaceted model.Nat Rev Microbiol. 2006; 4: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). These include two listerial invasion proteins, internalin (InlA) and InlB, that promote uptake of bacteria into distinct sets of nonphagocytotic cells (Cossart et al., 2003Cossart P. Pizarro-Cerda J. Lecuit M. Invasion of mammalian cells by Listeria monocytogenes: Functional mimicry to subvert cellular functions.Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 23-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). InlA promotes listerial uptake into intestinal epithelial cells (Gaillard et al., 1991Gaillard J.L. Berche P. Frehel C. Gouin E. Cossart P.

Ohayon H. Gounon P. Mege R.-M. Cossart P.

Disassembling adherens junctions: Breaking up is hard to do.Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 19-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). InlA similarly recognizes E-cadherin from guinea pig and rabbit but fails to bind the corresponding domain of murine E-cadherin (mEC1), despite a sequence identity of 90% to hEC1 (Lecuit et al., 1999Lecuit M. Dramsi S. Gottardi C. Fedor-Chaiken M. Gumbiner B. Cossart P. A single amino acid in E-cadherin responsible for host specificity towards the human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3956-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) and a pronounced structural similarity (Schubert et al., 2002Schubert W.D. Urbanke C. Ziehm T. Beier V. Machner M.P. Domann E. Wehland J. Chakraborty T. Heinz D.W. Structure of internalin, a major invasion protein of Listeria monocytogenes, in complex with its human receptor E-cadherin.Cell. 2002; 111: 825-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Among other targets, the second listerial invasion protein InlB recognizes the HGF or Met receptor (Shen et al., 2000Shen Y. Naujokas M. Park M. Ireton K. InIB-dependent internalization of Listeria is mediated by the Met receptor tyrosine kinase.Cell. 2000; 103: 501-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) inducing uptake into a wide range of mammalian cells including hepatocytes and endothelial cells. InlB recognizes both murine and human Met receptor but not that of the guinea pig and rabbit (Khelef et al., 2006Khelef N. Lecuit M. Bierne H. Cossart P. Species specificity of the Listeria monocytogenes InlB protein.Cell. Microbiol. 2006; 8: 457-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The lack of a small-animal model to study the interplay of InlA and InlB in human listeriosis in vivo was first addressed by the generation of a transgenic mouse producing human alongside murine E-cadherin in its enterocytes (Lecuit et al., 2001Lecuit M.

Lecuit M. Cabanes D. Cossart P. Bierne H. LPXTG protein InlJ, a newly identified internalin involved in Listeria monocytogenes virulence.Infect.

USA. 2007; 104: 997-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Animal models for other pathogens have similarly been created by the genetic humanization of mice (Lecuit and Cossart, 2002Lecuit M. Cossart P. Genetically-modified-animal models for human infections: The Listeria paradigm.Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 537-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, because pathogens typically abuse host molecules of complex biological function, humanizing such molecules may incur unexpected secondary effects. Humanized mouse lines, furthermore, need to be crossed with existing knockout strains (Yap and Sher, 2002Yap G.S. Sher A. The use of germ line-mutated mice in understanding host-pathogen interactions.Cell. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), thereby adding another level of complexity. In nature, pathogens occasionally switch their host specificity through spontaneous changes in their molecular arsenal (Gamblin et al., 2004Gamblin S.J. Haire L.F. Russell R.J. Stevens D.J. Xiao B. Ha Y. Vasisht N. Steinhauer D.A. Daniels R.S.

Avian flu to human influenza.Annu. Rev. Med. 2006; 57: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) include HIV (Heeney et al., 2006Heeney J.L. Dalgleish A.G. Weiss R.A. Origins of HIV and the evolution of resistance to AIDS.Science. 2006; 313: 462-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and SARS (Li et al., 2005Li F. Li W. Farzan M. Harrison S.C. Structure of SARS coronavirus spike receptor-binding domain complexed with receptor.Science. 2005; 309: 1864-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar), whereas influenza A subtype H5N1 may be poised to do the same (Stevens et al., 2006Stevens J. Blixt O. Tumpey T.M. Taubenberger J.K. Paulson J.C. Wilson I.A. Structure and receptor specificity of the hemagglutinin from an H5N1 influenza virus.Science. 2006; 312: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). We imitate this natural route of pathogen evolution by extending the host spectrum of Listeria monocytogenes. Our approach is based on the rational structure-based re-engineering of InlA such that modified InlA is able to recognize the previously incompatible receptor mEC1. By adapting the bacterium to the mouse (“murinization”) rather than humanizing the mouse, we introduce the human route of infection in mice and hence provide a versatile animal model to investigate listeriosis in vivo. Our working hypothesis was that the weak binding affinity of InlA for hEC1 is due to imperfect surface complementarity and hence numerous bridging water molecules between the two proteins (Schubert et al., 2002Schubert W.D. Urbanke C. Ziehm T. Beier V. Machner M.P. Domann E. Wehland J. Chakraborty T. Heinz D.W. Structure of internalin, a major invasion protein of Listeria monocytogenes, in complex with its human receptor E-cadherin.Cell. 2002; 111: 825-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). To increase binding affinity, we proposed individual amino acid substitutions in InlA (Figure 1A) to create additional, stabilizing contacts to hEC1, thus improving complementarity and binding affinity. Although Ser192 of InlA (Ser192InlA) faces hEC1 in the complex InlA/hEC1, its side chain is too short for a direct hydrogen bond to hEC1. Replacing it by asparagine could allow such a direct interaction. Solving the crystal structure of InlAS192N/hEC1 confirms that engineered Asn192InlA creates a direct hydrogen bond to the main-chain carbonyl of Phe17hEC1 (Figure 1B). Correspondingly, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) indicates the dissociation constant (KD) of InlAS192N/hEC1 to be 200 ± 50 nM (Figure 2), a 40-fold increase in binding affinity relative to InlAWT/hEC1 (KD = 8 ± 4 μM). To improve the unfavorable interaction of bulky Tyr369InlA to hEC1, we chose to replace it by the small hydrophilic amino acid serine. The crystal structure of the double variant InlAS192N-Y369S (henceforth denoted InlAm) in complex with hEC1 confirms that the interaction of Tyr369InlA has been replaced by a water-mediated hydrogen bond from Ser369InlA to Asn27hEC1 (Figure 1C). The binding affinity of InlAm for hEC1 is found to be KD = 1.2 ± 0.3 nM by ITC. The substitution Y369SInlA thus increases binding affinity by a factor of 170 (Figure 2), whereas both substitutions together increase affinity 6700-fold compared to InlAWT/hEC1. Although separated by 34 Å, the substitutions convert a weak interaction to a tight recognition. Note that a mere eight nonhydrogen atoms within the recognition interface of InlA and hEC1 have been altered. To analyze the biological effects of improved affinity of InlAm on the adhesion to and invasion of human epithelial cells in vitro, we modified wild-type Listeria monocytogenes EGD (Lmo-EGD) by exclusively replacing the gene inlA by inlAS192N-Y369S to produce the mutant strain Lmo-InlAm. Our strategy of minimal intervention circumvents InlA and InlB expression-level changes caused by disrupting the bicistronically transcribed inlAB locus (Lingnau et al., 1995Lingnau A. Domann E. Hudel M. Bock M. Nichterlein T. Wehland J. Chakraborty T. Expression of the Listeria monocytogenes EGD inlA and inlB genes, whose products mediate bacterial entry into tissue culture cell lines, by PrfA-dependent and -independent mechanisms.Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3896-3903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both listerial invasion proteins are thus expressed at native levels, ensuring that valid biological conclusions may be drawn from the infection process (Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available online). Binding of InlA to human E-cadherin induces listerial uptake into human epithelial cells by the zipper mechanism (Cossart and Sansonetti, 2004Cossart P. Sansonetti P.J. Bacterial invasion: The paradigms of enteroinvasive pathogens.Science. 2004; 304: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar), requiring localized rearrangements of the cytoskeleton as well as a physically tight interaction between bacterium and eukaryotic cell membrane. To establish whether improved affinity of InlAm for its receptor results in stronger adhesion of Lmo-InlAm, we analyzed its adhesion to the E-cadherin expressing human epithelial cell line Caco2. We observe a 2-fold increase in the adhesion efficiency of Lmo-InlAm compared to wild-type bacteria (Figure 3A). We investigated the link between improved adhesion of Lmo-InlAm and bacterial uptake by using Gentamicin-protection-invasion assays (Elsinghorst, 1994Elsinghorst E.A. Measurement of invasion by gentamicin resistance.Methods Enzymol. 1994; 236: 405-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). We observe a doubling in the number of internalized bacteria when expressing InlAm compared to InlAWT (Figure 3B). Increased invasion thus appears to be predominantly caused by improved adhesion of Lmo-InlAm to Caco2 over Lmo-EGD. After phagocytosis, bacteria need to escape from the phagosome to avoid lysosomal degradation. To rule out that factors after uptake affect the observed increase in intracellular bacteria, we analyzed intracellular growth rates of Lmo-EGD and Lmo-InlAm. A plot of colony-forming units (cfu) against time (Figure 3B) indicates a similar exponential increase for both Lmo-EGD and Lmo-InlAm. A logarithmic plot (Figure 3C) reveals the replication time of both strains to be 50 ± 4 min (gradient). The re-engineering of InlA therefore predominantly affects the process of listerial adhesion, whereas uptake, phagosomal escape, intracellular replication rates, and cell-to-cell spread appear unaltered. As a control, we compared intracellular growth curves of both strains in the professionally phagocytic, macrophage-like cell line J774, where uptake is InlA independent (Dramsi et al., 1997Dramsi S. Dehoux P. Lebrun M. Goossens P.L. Cossart P. Identification of four new members of the internalin multigene family of Listeria monocytogenes EGD.Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1615-1625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We observe indistinguishable invasion efficiencies and intracellular replication times of 46 ± 3 min for both strains (Figure 3D). InlA-independent pathophysiological characteristics of Lmo-EGD thus remain unaltered in Lmo-InlAm. Although E-cadherin and in particular the N-terminal domain EC1 is highly conserved among mammals, the differences in amino acid sequence vary sufficiently to disallow binding of InlA to murine EC1 (mEC1). As a consequence, E-cadherin-based invasion of murine epithelial cells does not occur (Lecuit et al., 1999Lecuit M. Dramsi S. Gottardi C. Fedor-Chaiken M. Gumbiner B. Cossart P. A single amino acid in E-cadherin responsible for host specificity towards the human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3956-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). We find the dissociation constant of InlAm/mEC1 to be KD = 10 ± 2 μM (Figure 2). Although weak, the binding affinity almost perfectly matches the KD = 8 ± 4 μM for InlAWT/hEC1 (Schubert et al., 2002Schubert W.D. Urbanke C. Ziehm T. Beier V. Machner M.P. Domann E. Wehland J.

The high-resolution crystal structure of InlAm/mEC1 (Figures 4B–4D and Table S1) indicates that the relative orientations of mEC1 and InlAm are unchanged from InlA/hEC1 (r.m.s.d. for main-chain atoms ∼0.7 Å). The hydrogen bonds introduced to strengthen the interaction of InlA/hEC1 (see above) are retained in InlAm/mEC1, thereby giving rise to the altered specificity of InlA. Differences between InlA/hEC1 and InlAm/mEC1 most noticeably involve residues 16 of hEC1 and mEC1 and their immediate neighborhood. Pro16hEC1 adopts a strained cis conformation, optimally positioning its side chain within a hydrophobic binding pocket of InlA (Figure 4C). Glu16mEC1 of the engineered complex, by contrast, adopts a relaxed trans conformation, permitting the backbone to move aside to accommodate the longer glutamate side chain. Unexpectedly, the carboxy group of Glu16mEC1 occupies the same hydrophobic pocket of InlA as Pro16hEC1 in InlA/hEC1 (Figure 4C). Glu16mEC1 additionally induces a local rearrangement that involves Lys19mEC1 and that repositions the latter away from a salt bridge to Glu255InlA observed in InlA/hEC1 (Schubert et al., 2002Schubert W.D. Urbanke C. Ziehm T. Beier V. Machner M.P. Domann E. Wehland J. Chakraborty T. Heinz D.W. Structure of internalin, a major invasion protein of Listeria monocytogenes, in complex with its human receptor E-cadherin.Cell. 2002; 111: 825-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The low binding affinity of InlA for mEC1 is thus not only due to the disparate physical properties of glutamate and proline but also due to local adjustments within EC1 (Figure 4D). The substitution of Pro16hEC1 by Glu16mEC1 clearly dominates the host tropism of L. monocytogenes (Lecuit et al., 1999Lecuit M. Dramsi S. Gottardi C. Fedor-Chaiken M. Gumbiner B. Cossart P. A single amino acid in E-cadherin responsible for host specificity towards the human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3956-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Genetically replacing Glu16mEC1 by proline in mice has been proposed as a route to create a new animal model, rendering all E-cadherin expressing cells susceptible to InlA-mediated entry (Lecuit, 2005Lecuit M. Understanding how Listeria monocytogenes targets and crosses host barriers.Clin. Microbiol. Infect. 2005; 11: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Analyzing the affinity of InlA for mEC1E16P biophysically, we find the interaction to be exceedingly weak (KD > 40 μM), preventing the binding affinity from being quantified unambiguously. We estimate the binding affinity as follows: InlAm binds mEC1E16P with a KD = 14 ± 4 nM (Figure 2) and thus confirms the dominant effect (factor of 700) of the Glu16Pro substitution. The ten remaining substitutions in mEC1 (Figure 4A) contribute a factor of ∼12 (Figure 2). Provided the changes are largely additive, the KD of InlA/mEC1E16P would be ∼12 × KD = 8 μM (InlA/hEC1) or ∼96 μM (Figure 2). In InlA-coated latex beads, this low binding affinity could be offset by a high density of InlA molecules leading to recognition of mEC1P16E-expressing cells (Lecuit et al., 1999Lecuit M. Dramsi S. Gottardi C. Fedor-Chaiken M. Gumbiner B. Cossart P. A single amino acid in E-cadherin responsible for host specificity towards the human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3956-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). On the surface of Listeria, physical and physiological constraints would limit the density of InlA, preventing efficient adhesion and hence uptake of Lmo-EGD. The crystal structure of InlAm/mEC1 reveals that a second substitution in mEC1 is involved in InlAm recognition. In InlA/hEC1, Glu64hEC1 forms a salt bridge to Arg85InlA (Figures 4A and 4B). In mEC1, this glutamate is replaced by glutamine, substituting the salt bridge by a hydrogen bond to Arg85InlA. Reverting these two substitutions in mEC1 produces mEC1P16E-Q64E with an affinity of KD = 4 ± 2 nM for re-engineered InlAm (Figure 2) or KD = 11 ± 4 μM for InlAWT—similar to that of InlA/hEC1 (KD = 8μM). A transgenic mouse bearing both the substitutions Glu16Pro and Gln64Glu in murine E-cadherin could therefore represent a system more closely resembling the human situation than the singly substituted protein. To establish whether increased binding affinity of InlAm for murine E-cadherin will allow infection of the murine intestine comparable to that of humans, we infected C57BL/6J mice intragastrically with both Lmo-EGD and Lmo-InlAm. Challenging mice with 5 × 107 to 5 × 1010 Lmo-InlAm results in dose-dependent mortality rates (Figure 5A). The median lethal dose is inferred to be ∼5 × 107. By contrast, the highest achievable inoculum of 5 × 1010 of Lmo-EGD is lethal only for ∼20% of infected mice (Figure 5A, dashed line). Lmo-InlAm is thus at least three orders of magnitude more virulent in mice than wild-type Lmo-EGD. To establish the route of infection of Lmo-InlAm in mice, we analyzed the load of Lmo-InlAm and Lmo-EGD in affected organs, after intragastric challenge with 1 × 1010 bacteria (Figure 5 and Figure S2). In stomach and intestine, loads of Lmo-InlAm and Lmo-EGD (Figures 5B and 5C) are largely comparable until day 2 post infection (p.i.). Thereafter, Lmo-InlAm loads increase strongly (Figures 5B and 5C), whereas loads of Lmo-EGD remain constant. In mesenteric lymph nodes, the spleen, and the liver, bacterial loads of both strains increase until day 2 p.i. (Figures 5D–5F). Lmo-EGD counts then stabilize in mesenteric lymph nodes, the spleen, and the liver (infection controlled). In Lmo-InlAm-infected mice, by contrast, stabilization of bacterial numbers is not observed. Instead, bacterial loads increase exponentially in the spleen and liver until day 4 p.i. (solid lines, Figures 5E and 5F), resulting in 1.000-fold greater bacterial numbers in the spleen and liver in Lmo-InlAm than in Lmo-EGD on day 4 p.i. Bacterial counts in mesenteric lymph nodes diverge after day 2 p.i., but loads of Lmo-InlAm increase more slowly than in the liver and spleen. To compare bacterial-growth kinetics at a lower infection dose, we challenged mice intragastrically with 5 × 107 of Lmo-EGD and Lmo-InlAm (Figure S3). Again, we observe enhanced virulence for Lmo-InlAm relative to Lmo-EGD. Although the effect in terms of bacterial numbers is not as pronounced as for the higher dose, slower kinetics of bacterial dissemination allow later time points to be investigated. In the stomach and small intestine, differences in bacterial loads become significant by day 5 p.i. In the spleen, liver, and mesenteric lymph nodes, Lmo-InlAm loads are consistently higher than those of Lmo-EGD. Histological and immunohistochemical studies of Peyer's patches of infected mice indicate that both Lmo-EGD and Lmo-InlAm remain restricted to the dome and germinal centers, where they induce neutrophil infiltration and necrosis (Figures S4A–S4D) with gradually increasing severity along the small-intestinal axis. Colonization is, however, essentially indistinguishable until day 4 p.i. Whereas the Lmo-EGD infection subsides after day 4 p.i., no such remission is observed for Lmo-InlAm. Immunohistochemical analyses of the intestinal mucosa clearly demonstrate that Lmo-EGD do not invade epithelial tissue (Figure 6). Instead, bacteria are exclusively observed in the lumen or occasionally adhere to the surface of individual villi (Figures 6B, 6F, and 6J) as late as day 4 p.i. (Figure 6N). Similarly, the intestinal tissue is fully intact without any signs of inflammation until day 3 p.i. (Figures 6A and 6E). Transient inflammatory response with enhanced mucus secretion and mild, local erosion of epithelium is present at day 4 p.i. (Figure 6I). The inflammation, however, subsides by day 5 p.i. (Figure 6M). In Lmo-InlAm-infected mice, colonization of epithelia at villous tips are observed 24 hr p.i. in the ileum (Figure 6D), rapidly spreading to extended areas of the epithelium and accumulating within the lamina propria (subepithelial tissue) (Figures 6H, 6L, and 6P). On day 4 p.i., high bacterial loads cause erosion of the epithelium and fusion of villi (Figures 6K and 6O). Lesions are more pronounced in the ileum than in the duodenum and jejunum. To analyze the role of InlAm in systemic infections of internal organs independently of intestinal uptake, we inoculated mice intravenously (i.v.) with both low (5 × 103) or high (2.4 × 104) doses of Lmo-EGD or Lmo-InlAm. In contrast to the oral route of infection, the survival rates for both strains are found to be indistinguishable for both bacterial doses (Figures 7A and 7B). Similarly, bacterial loads in mesenteric lymph nodes, the spleen, and the liver at different time points after i.v. inoculation demonstrate comparable virulence of Lmo-EGD and Lmo-InlAm (Figures 7C–7E). Lmo-EGD remains problematic to humans inter alia because of its ability to cross the blood-placental barrier, thereby resulting in sepsis or miscarriage. Ex vivo experiments have shown that InlA-mediated entry into human placental trophoblasts is important in placental infection (Lecuit et al., 2004Lecuit M. Nelson D.M. Smith S.D. Khun H. Huerre M. Vacher-Lavenu M.C. Gordon J.I. Cossart P. Targeting and crossing of the human maternofetal barrier by Listeria monocytogenes: Role of internalin interaction with trophoblast E-cadherin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 6152-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Studies of Lmo-EGD-infected pregnant BALB/c mice (functional InlB, nonfunctional InlA) (Le Monnier et al., 2007Le Monnier A. Autret N. Join-Lambert O.F. Jaubert F. Charbit A. Berche P. Kayal S. ActA is required for crossing of the fetoplacental barrier by Listeria monocytogenes.Infect. Immun. 2007; 75: 950-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and guinea pigs (functional InlA and nonfunctional InlB) (Bakardjiev et al., 2004Bakardjiev A.I. Stacy B.A. Fisher S.J. Portnoy D.A. Listeriosis in the pregnant guinea pig: A model of vertical transmission.Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) indicate that InlA and InlB individually are insufficient at inducing vertical transmission in vivo. They, however, confirm trophoblasts to be the primary target of Lmo-EGD. To ascertain whether the combination of functional InlA and InlB facilitates vertical transmission, we analyzed the ability of Lmo-InlAm to breach the murine blood-placental barrier. Pregnant BALB/c mice were infected orally with 5 × 109 cfu of Lmo-EGD or Lmo-InlAm at embryonic day (E13.5) or E14.5 of gestation. We find bacterial loads of fetal-placental units at day 2, 3, and 4 p.i. to be indistinguishable (Figure S5). Histopathological analysis of placentas and embryos confirm that lesions and inflammatory responses are similar in mice infected with either strain (Figure S6). Equivalent bacterial loads were also observed in fetal-placental units in female mice challenged with 5 × 104 cfu Lmo-InlAm and Lmo-EGD intravenously at day E14.5 (data not shown). Crossing of the blood-placental barrier is thus not InlA dependent in BALB/c mice. By using minimal, structure-derived modifications of a single pathogenicity factor, we have rationally redesigned the interface of InlA/hEC1 to increase its binding affinity and, in the process, modify the binding specificity of InlA to include murine E-cadherin. Incorporating these modifications into the original bacterium, we create a new listerial strain that mimics the uptake of wild-type Lmo-EGD in the human intestine in the mouse instead. Our approach circumvents the limitations of existing models of listeriosis in that both early and late responses are accessible and by uniquely providing a system in which both InlA and InlB are fully functional and expressed at wild-type levels. Because intestinal uptake depends only on murine E-cadherin, all mouse strains may be analyzed with Lmo-InlAm. It should, furthermore, allow both host responses to food-borne pathogens crossing the intestinal barrier and the role of individual listerial factors during infection to be analyzed in an in vivo setting. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a virulence factor has been rationally modified, without relying on known mutations from related strains, or that a novel strain of a pathogen has been created with an extended host range. To induce uptake into epithelial cells by the zipper-mechanism, L. monocytogenes must adhere tightly to the eukaryotic-cell membrane. Accordingly, tighter adhesion of Lmo-InlAm to Caco2 cells increases the efficiency of uptake compared to wild-type Lmo-EGD. Surprisingly, however, the 6700-fold increased binding affinity merely causes a doubling in adhesion (Figure 3A). Because low binding affinity may be counteracted by high protein concentration, the efficient adhesion of Lmo-E"
https://openalex.org/W1964115378,"T cells have evolved a unique system of ligand recognition involving an antigen T cell receptor (TCR) and a coreceptor that integrate stimuli provided by the engagement of peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) antigens. Here, we use altered pMHC class I (pMHCI) molecules with impaired CD8 binding (CD8-null) to quantify the contribution of coreceptor extracellular binding to (i) the engagement of soluble tetrameric pMHCI molecules, (ii) the kinetics of TCR/pMHCI interactions on live cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), and (iii) the activation of CTLs by cell-surface antigenic determinants. Our data indicate that the CD8 coreceptor substantially enhances binding efficiency at suboptimal TCR/pMHCI affinities through effects on both association and dissociation rates. Interestingly, coreceptor requirements for efficient tetramer labeling of CTLs or for CTL activation by determinants displayed on the cell surface operated in different TCR/pMHCI affinity ranges. Wild-type and CD8-null pMHCI tetramers required monomeric affinities for cognate TCRs of KD < approximately 80 microM and approximately 35 microM, respectively, to label human CTLs at 37 degrees C. In contrast, activation by cellular pMHCI molecules was strictly dependent on CD8 binding only for TCR/pMHCI interactions with KD values >200 microM. Altogether, our data provide information on the binding interplay between CD8 and the TCR and support a model of CTL activation in which the extent of coreceptor dependence is inversely correlated to TCR/pMHCI affinity. In addition, the results reported here define the range of TCR/pMHCI affinities required for the detection of antigen-specific CTLs by flow cytometry."

https://openalex.org/W2045571319,"Substantial efforts have recently been made to demonstrate the importance of lipids and lipid-modifying enzymes in various membrane trafficking processes, including calcium-regulated exocytosis of hormones and neurotransmitters. Among bioactive lipids, phosphatidic acid (PA) is an attractive candidate to promote membrane fusion through its ability to change membrane topology. To date, however, the biosynthetic pathway, the dynamic location, and actual function of PA in secretory cells remain unknown. Using a short interference RNA strategy on chromaffin and PC12 cells, we demonstrate here that phospholipase D1 is activated in secretagogue-stimulated cells and that it produces PA at the plasma membrane at the secretory granule docking sites. We show that phospholipase D1 activation and PA production represent key events in the exocytotic progression. Membrane capacitance measurements indicate that reduction of endogenous PA impairs the formation of fusion-competent granules. Finally, we show that the PLD1 short interference RNA-mediated inhibition of exocytosis can be rescued by exogenous provision of a lipid that favors the transition of opposed bi-layer membranes to hemifused membranes having the outer leaflets fused. Our findings demonstrate that PA synthesis is required during exocytosis to facilitate a late event in the granule fusion pathway. We propose that the underlying mechanism is related to the ability of PA to alter membrane curvature and promote hemi-fusion.

Life Sci. 2005; 62: 2305-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Most intriguingly, PA has also been shown to promote negative curvature in bi-layer membranes due to its small polar head-group in combination with two fatty-acyl side chains (4Kooijman E.E. Chupin V. de Kruijff B. Burger K.N. Traffic. 2003; 4: 162-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The bulk of cellular PA is synthesized via two different acylation pathways, the glycerol 3-phosphate pathway and the dihydroxy acetone phosphate pathway, which are named according to their respective precursors. However, PA is also produced via hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine by phospholipase D (PLD) (5Athenstaedt K. Daum G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) on a much faster time scale, and this latter source is thought to underlie the dynamic regulation of PA that allows it to function as a signaling lipid in agonist-stimulated cell biological responses such as secretion and changes in cellular morphology. In mammals, the classic PLD family is composed of a pair of membrane-associated proteins, PLD1 and PLD2. Both PLD isoforms require phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate for their enzymatic activity. However, whereas PLD2 exhibits relatively high basal activity in isolation, full activation of PLD1 requires its stimulation by small GTPases of the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF), Rho and Ral families, and protein kinase C (3Jenkins G.M. Frohman M.A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 2305-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 6McDermott M. Wakelam M.J. Morris A.J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 225-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). PLD enzymes have been proposed to be involved in a number of cellular processes, including cell growth and survival, cell differentiation, and vesicular trafficking (3Jenkins G.M. Frohman M.A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 2305-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). There is also increasing evidence for a PLD role in calcium-regulated exocytosis, the process by which specialized secretory cells release peptides, hormones, and neurotransmitters. For example, PLD1 and PLD2 have been shown to regulate different phases of exocytosis in mast cells (7Choi W.S. Kim Y.M. Combs C. Frohman M.A. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5682-5689Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). PLD1 has also been implicated in insulin secretion from pancreatic β cells (8Hughes W.E. Elgundi Z. Huang P.

In neuroendocrine adrenal chromaffin cells and their tumor derivative, the PC12 cell line, we have previously described that PLD is activated by the stimuli that trigger exocytosis (11Caumont A.S. Galas M.C. Vitale N. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1373-1379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and that this correlated in timing and calcium dependence with the exocytotic response (11Caumont A.S. Galas M.C. Vitale N. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1373-1379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Moreover, inhibition of PA production by primary alcohols and ceramides or expression of a catalytically inactive mutant of PLD1 strongly inhibits exocytosis (12Vitale N. Caumont A.S. Chasserot-Golaz S. Du G. Wu S. Sciorra V.A. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Bader M.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2424-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations implicate PLD1 in exocytosis, although none of these results directly demonstrates the functional importance of the endogenous enzyme in this process. Finally, the dynamic distribution of PA and its function in the exocytotic machinery have remained unsolved key issues. We describe here a variety of direct means to study the functional role of PLD1-derived PA in regulated exocytosis from chromaffin and PC12 cells. First, we show that endogenous PLD1 produces PA at the plasma membrane in cells stimulated for exocytosis. Second, we demonstrate that PA synthesis is a prerequisite to normal exocytotic function, and, using capacitance recordings, we show that PA produced by PLD1 is required for the formation of fusion-competent granules in chromaffin cells. Finally, we provide evidence to support the hypothesis that the requirement for PA synthesis during the exocytotic process ensues from changes in effects in the biophysical properties of the plasma membrane lipid bi-layer that act to facilitate membrane fusion at a late step in the process. Reagents, Antibodies, and Plasmids—Palmitoyllysophosphatidylcholine was from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). The affinity-purified rabbit anti-PLD1 C-terminal antibody was described in Zhang et al. (13Zhang Y. Huang P. Du G. Kanaho Y. Frohman M.A. Tsirka S.E.

For siRNA targeting, human PLD1 cDNA fragments encoding the 19-nucleotide siRNA sequence CTGGAAGATTACTTGACAA derived from the target transcript and separated from its reverse 19-nucleotide complement by a short spacer, were annealed and cloned in the BglII and HindIII sites in front of the H1 promoter of either the pEGFP-N2-RNAi plasmid or a modified pXGH5 plasmid encoding for GH as described previously (15de Barry J.

Modified pXGH5 vector with no siRNA sequence was named pGHsuper. The PLD1 siRNA sequence was identical in human, rat, and bovine. PLD2 siRNA sequence (mouse nucleotides 1145–1164; identical in mouse, rat, and bovine), validated previously (16Du G. Huang P. Liang B.T. Frohman M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1024-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), was introduced in the modified pXGH5 vector as described for PLD1. Cells were also transfected with a pCGN plasmid tagged with hemagglutinin containing mutated rescue PLD constructs resistant to siRNA degradation (17Huang P. Altshuller Y.M. Hou J.C. Pessin J.E.

Yeast soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) protein Spo20p PA-binding domain (wtPABD) in a pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech) was employed (18Nakanishi H. de los Santos P. Neiman A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1802-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A mutated domain (MutPABD) was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to introduce a leucine-to-proline mutation at residue 67. Cell Culture—PC12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with glucose (4500 mg/liter) and containing 30 mm NaHCO3, 5% fetal bovine serum, 10% horse serum, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Chromaffin cells were isolated from fresh bovine adrenal glands and maintained in primary culture as described previously (11Caumont A.S. Galas M.C. Vitale N. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1373-1379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Growth Hormone Release from PC12 and Chromaffin Cells—PC12 cells (24-well plates, 80% confluent) were transfected with the various constructs (0.5 μg/well of each plasmid) using GenePorter (Gene Therapy Systems). 72 h after transfection, cells were washed four times with Locke's solution and then incubated for 10 min in calcium-free Locke's solution (basal release) or stimulated for 10 min with a depolarizing concentration of K+ (Locke's solution containing 59 mm KCl and 85 mm NaCl). When indicated, 1 μm of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) was added during the last wash and the 10-min incubation in resting conditions (calcium-free Locke's solution) or in stimulated conditions (elevated K+ solution). Supernatants were collected, and cells were broken by three freeze and thaw cycles. The amounts of GH secreted into the medium or retained within the cells were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Applied Science). GH secretion is expressed as a percentage of total GH present in the cells before stimulation. GH release was also measured from adrenal chromaffin cells expressing PLD1 or PLD2 siRNAs. In this case, cells were transfected using the Amaxa Nucleofector system (Amaxa Biosystems, program X-01). GH release from the cells was measured 72 h after transfection as described above for PC12 cells. Determination of PLD Activity—72 h after transfection, PC12 cells were washed four times with Locke's solution and then incubated for 10 min in calcium-free Locke's solution (basal PLD activity) or stimulated in Locke's solution containing a depolarizing concentration of K+. Medium was then replaced by 100 μl of an ice-cold Tris 50 mm, pH 8.0, solution, and the cells were broken by three freeze and thaw cycles. Samples were collected, mixed with an equal amount of the Amplex Red reaction buffer (Amplex Red Phospholipase D assay kit, Molecular Probes), and the PLD activity was estimated after 1-h incubation at 37 °C with a Mithras (Berthold) fluorometer. A standard curve was performed with purified PLD from Streptomyces chromofuscus (Sigma). In the figure, data are given as the mean of six determinations performed on three different cell preparations ±S.E. Western Blot Analysis—The control vectors or the vectors driving the expression of PLD1 siRNAs were introduced in PC12 cells (107 cells/reaction) by electroporation (290 V and 1200 microfarads) or in chromaffin cells using the Amaxa Nucleofector system. 72 h following transfection, cell protein extracts were prepared as described previously (15de Barry J.

Proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were then incubated in the presence of anti-PLD1 (1/500), anti-actin (1/10 000), anti-GH (1/300), and anti-GFP (1/250) antibodies. Detection was performed by chemiluminescence using the Super Signal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Pierce). Transfection efficiency, assessed in parallel by immunocytochemistry (see below) and counting of GFP- or GH-expressing cells, ranged from 50 to 65%. Immunocytochemistry—Transfected PC12 and chromaffin cells were washed twice with Locke's solution and then incubated for 10 min either in calcium-free Locke's solution (resting conditions) or in Locke's solution containing a depolarizing concentration of potassium (stimulation) before the fixation step and further processed for immunofluorescence as described previously (12Vitale N.

The primary antibodies were used at the following dilutions: anti-GH antibody (1/150) and anti-SNAP25 antibody (1/200). Fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1/1000. Stained cells were visualized using a Zeiss confocal microscope LSM 510. The percentage of the EGFP-PABD binding probes (wild type or mutated) co-localizing at the plasma membrane with SNAP25 was determined using the Zeiss CLSM instrument software 3.2 (15de Barry J.

Pre-embedding Immunoelectron Microscopy—Chromaffin cells transfected with the plasmid encoding for the wtPABD coupled to EGFP were kept under resting conditions in Locke's solution or stimulated for 3 min in a solution containing 2 mm BaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The cells were then fixed for 30 min with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium/phosphate, pH 7.3. After permeabilization in the presence of 0.05% Triton X-100 for 15 min or 0.1% saponin for 30 min, immunostaining was performed using anti-GFP antibodies (1/50) and a fluoronanogold secondary antibody (1/60) according to the silver-intensified immunogold method described by Yi et al. (20Yi H. Leunissen J. Shi G. Gutekunst C. Hersch S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2001; 49: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Morphometric Analysis—Quantitative analysis of the ultrastructural distribution of the granules and of the immunogold particles bound to the wtPABD-EGFP probe was performed in 21 transfected chromaffin cells after stimulation. Granules as well as gold particles were considered to be associated with cellular structures (plasma membrane, subplasmalemmal shell (SPM), and granule membrane) when separated by <50 nm. In the culture and fixation conditions used in the present study, the thickness of SPM was 184.5 ± 3.9 nm. The percentage of granule was counted in the SPM region and non-SPM internal cytoplasm of the cells to estimate the current secretory activity of the stimulated cells compared with resting cells, which did not display any granule in SPM shell. The density of immunogold particles in the SPM region and in the internal cytoplasm was determined as the number particles/μm2 of area measured using the image analysis software Axiovision AC Rel. 4.5. The percentages of plasma membrane- and granule-bound immunogold particles in SPM were calculated relative to total immunogold particles counted in SPM. Finally, to estimate the particular accumulation of PA at the plasma membrane involved in granule docking, we compared the numbers of immunogold particles/μm of plasma membrane at docking sites versus non-docking sites of the plasma membrane (t test). The lengths of plasma membrane involved in granule docking were measured according to the schematic in Fig. 3B. Amperometry, Membrane Capacitance, and Ca2+ Measurements—Electrochemical measurement (amperometry) of catecholamine secretion from single chromaffin cells was performed as described previously (21Yizhar O.

Capacitance measurements were performed 72 h after electroporation at 30–32 °C. Conventional whole cell recordings and capacitance measurements were performed as described (21Yizhar O. Matti U.

Flashes of UV light were generated by a flash lamp (TILL Photonics, Planegg, Germany), and fluorescence excitation light was generated by a monochromator (TILL Photonics). [Ca2+]i was calculated from the fluorescence ratio after calibration as described by Voets (23Voets T. Neuron. 2000; 28: 537-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Fluorescent excitation light was used not only to measure [Ca2+]i but also to adjust [Ca2+]i before and after the flash. The calcium concentration before the flash was 300–500 nm. Statistical analysis was done using the Mann-Whitney test. Given values represent mean ± S.E. The analysis and comparison were always performed from pairs of control and PLD1-siRNA cells from the same batch of cells. Total Internal Reflection Microscopy—An inverted Olympus IX-70 microscope equipped with a TIRF condenser (TILL Photonics) was used to view the cells under TIRF illumination. Excitation light at 473 was provided by a solid-state laser (Laser Quantum, Stockport, United Kingdom) coupled into a single fiber optic cable that was connected to the TIRF condenser. The laser was focused into the back focal plane of a high numerical aperture lens (×60, numerical aperture = 1.45) designated for TIRF imaging (Olympus). The resulting depth of illumination under these conditions was 200–300 nm from the coverslip. Fluorescence excited by this illumination was passed through a 500 nm dichroic mirror. Time lapse live imaging was captured using an Andor camera (iXon) controlled by MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA), and images were taken every 5 s. Data were analyzed using MetaMorph. PA Is Produced at the Plasma Membrane When Exocytosis Is Stimulated—Several reports have recently proposed PLD1 as a component of the molecular machinery underlying calcium-regulated exocytosis. If so, it would be reasonable to expect that PLD1 should be activated and PA produced at the site of exocytosis, which would be at the plasma membrane and/or on the membrane of arriving secretory granules. To assess this possibility, we attempted to visualize the intracellular location of PA production during the process of secretion in neuroendocrine cells, using a GFP sensor that specifically binds to PA (supplemental Fig. S1). PC12 cells were transfected with a chimeric protein consisting of EGFP fused to the PA-binding domain (PABD) of Spo20p, a yeast homolog of SNAP25 (18Nakanishi H. de los Santos P. Neiman A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1802-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This probe has previously been shown to be a sensitive and specific sensor of PA in yeast (18Nakanishi H. de los Santos P. Neiman A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1802-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The distribution of the PA sensor was examined in resting PC12 cells and in cells stimulated with a depolarizing concentration of potassium, which is known to trigger exocytosis. As illustrated in Fig. 1A, the PA binding probe (wtPABD) was found to accumulate in the cell nucleus in resting cells. Stimulation of exocytosis triggered the recruitment of a fraction of the PA sensor to the plasma membrane within 5 min, where it co-localized with the SNARE complex protein SNAP25 (Fig. 1A). Similar recruitment of the PA binding probe was observed by time-lapse video microscopy (supplemental movie S1). Accumulation of the PA sensor at the cell periphery was transient, as it rapidly became undetectable when the cells returned to the resting conditions (Fig. 1A). The specificity of the sensor as a reporter for PA production in PC12 cells was assessed using a mutated PA-binding domain (MutPABD) that in vitro displays a reduced affinity for PA (supplemental Fig. S1) (18Nakanishi H. de los Santos P. Neiman A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1802-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 1B, the mutated sensor did not translocate from the nucleus to the cell periphery in stimulated cells. Thus, the recruitment of wtPABD reflects bona fide formation of PA in the plasma membrane. In contrast, the nuclear fluorescence observed in resting and stimulated cells most likely ensues from nonspecific PA-independent accumulation of the probe as seen in yeast (18Nakanishi H. de los Santos P. Neiman A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1802-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A semi-quantitative analysis of the amount of wtPABD co-localizing with SNAP25 highlighted the tight coupling between PA production and cell stimulation, because wtPABD was almost undetectable at the plasma membrane in resting cells, but progressively increased there in stimulated cells over the course of the stimulatory period (Fig. 1C). To compare the kinetics of PA production with the kinetics of exocytosis, we measured the fluorescence intensity of wtPABD at the plasma membrane by TIRF microscopy and monitored catecholamine secretion from individual cells by amperometry using a carbon fiber electrode. TIRF microscopy allows excitation of fluorophores located within ∼250 nm from the plasma membrane (evanescence field). As illustrated in supplemental Fig. S2 and quantified in Fig. 1D, TIRF revealed that wtPABD translocated to the plasma membrane within 90 s following K+-evoked stimulation. Amperometric recordings indicated that chromaffin cells undergo massive exocytosis during this period of time (Fig. 1E). The time course of secretion obtained by integrating the surface area of the amperometric spikes paralleled the time course of wtPABD recruitment (Fig. 1F), suggesting a close correlation between the formation of PA at the plasma membrane and the exocytotic response. However, during the first 15 s following cell stimulation there is no detectable increase in TIRF signal, whereas the secretory signal increased, albeit modestly. This may well be the consequence of the detection limit of the TIRF signal and/or the time required for the probe to translocate from the nucleus to the plasma membrane. To further define the cellular distribution of PA in resting and stimulated chromaffin cells, we used anti-GFP antibodies to perform immunoelectron microscopy on cells expressing wtPABD-GFP. Morphometric analysis revealed that in secretagogue-stimulated chromaffin cells 25.6 ± 2.3% (n = 21 cells) of the granules were found close to the plasma membrane in a ∼180 nm wide SPM. This region was virtually devoid of granule in resting cells. Immunogold particles were observed to distribute uniformly in the cytoplasm in resting chromaffin cells (Fig. 2, A and C). Based on Fig. 1A, a strong signal would be expected to be observed in the nucleus. However, this was not the case, most likely due to restricted accessibility of the immunoreagents to the nucleus as a consequence of the mild permeabilization conditions used here to preserve membrane structures. Density of the gold particles in secretagogue-stimulated cells was 10.3 ± 1.2 particles/μm2 in the cytoplasmic region and 44.6 ± 6.8 in SPM region (n = 21 cells, p < 0.00001), reflecting a dramatic increase in PABD staining at the periphery of stimulated cells. In the SPM region, numerous gold particles were found to be particularly concentrated at regions of the plasma membrane approached by peripheral secretory granules (Fig. 2, B, D–G, arrowheads), although some immunogold particles were also found on regions of the plasma membrane seemingly free of granules (Fig. 2E, arrows). Note that some peripheral granules were surrounded with gold particles (Fig. 2, E–G), indicating that PA is present not only in the plasma membrane, but also in the granule membrane. This was observed on granules that appeared to be docked (Fig. 2, E–G) as well as on granules deeper in the cytoplasm that did not appear to be in contact with the plasma membrane (Fig. 2, B and G). A detailed morphometric analysis allowed us to estimate that in the SPM region almost half of the gold particles are directly associated with the plasma membrane and ∼20% appeared to be granule-bound (Fig. 3A). Moreover, within the plasma membrane gold particles tend to concentrate in the areas facing granules that appeared morphologically docked (Fig. 3, B and C). Altogether these findings support the idea that, in response to chromaffin cell stimulation, PA synthesis occurs at the plasma membrane and preferentially at the granule-docking site. PLD1 Is Responsible for the Plasma Membrane PA Production Observed during Exocytosis—Since we previously described the presence of PLD1 at the plasma membrane in chromaffin and PC12 cells (11Caumont A.S.

Wu S. Sciorra V.A. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Bader M.F.

We tested this by using an siRNA approach to knock down endogenous PLD1 expression in chromaffin and PC12 cells. To accomplish this and simultaneously enable quantitative assessment of exocytosis, we engineered a plasmid that expresses both full-length human GH and an siRNA-targeted against the sequence of PLD. This plasmid allows also the identification of the subpopulation of cells that transiently express the siRNAs through the immunostaining of GH. In transfected PC12 cells, GH is stored in secretory granules and released by exocytosis in response to cell stimulation (14Meyer M.Z. Deliot N. Chasserot-Golaz S. Premont R.T. Bader M.F. Vitale N.

https://openalex.org/W1986492134,"The serine-threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a heterotrimeric enzyme family that regulates numerous signaling pathways. Biallelic mutations of the structural PP2A Abeta subunit occur in several types of human tumors; however, the functional consequences of these cancer-associated PP2A Abeta mutations in cell transformation remain undefined. Here we show that suppression of PP2A Abeta expression permits immortalized human cells to achieve a tumorigenic state. Cancer-associated Abeta mutants fail to reverse tumorigenic phenotype induced by PP2A Abeta suppression, indicating that these mutants function as null alleles. Wild-type PP2A Abeta but not cancer-derived Abeta mutants form a complex with the small GTPase RalA. PP2A Abeta-containing complexes dephosphorylate RalA at Ser183 and Ser194, inactivating RalA and abolishing its transforming function. These observations identify PP2A Abeta as a tumor suppressor gene that transforms immortalized human cells by regulating the function of RalA."

An imbalance between mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production and scavenging was previously implicated in the activation of an inner membrane anion channel (IMAC), distinct from the permeability transition pore (PTP), as the first response to metabolic stress in cardiomyocytes. The glutathione redox couple, GSH/GSSG, oscillated in parallel with ΔΨm and the NADH/NAD+ redox state. Here we show that depletion of reduced glutathione is an alternative trigger of synchronized mitochondrial oscillation in cardiomyocytes and that intermediate GSH/GSSG ratios cause reversible ΔΨm depolarization, although irreversible PTP activation is induced by extensive thiol oxidation. Mitochondrial dysfunction in response to diamide occurred in stages, progressing from oscillations in ΔΨm to sustained depolarization, in association with depletion of GSH. Mitochondrial oscillations were abrogated by 4′-chlorodiazepam, an IMAC inhibitor, whereas cyclosporin A was ineffective. In saponin-permeabilized cardiomyocytes, the thiol redox status was systematically clamped at GSH/GSSG ratios ranging from 300:1 to 20:1. At ratios of 150:1-100:1, ΔΨm depolarized reversibly, and a matrix-localized fluorescent marker was retained; however, decreasing the GSH/GSSG to 50:1 irreversibly depolarized ΔΨm and induced maximal rates of reactive oxygen species production, NAD(P)H oxidation, and loss of matrix constituents. Mitochondrial GSH sensitivity was altered by inhibiting either GSH uptake, the NADPH-dependent glutathione reductase, or the NADH/NADPH transhydrogenase, indicating that matrix GSH regeneration or replenishment was crucial.

The dual nature of oxygen as a vital electron acceptor in oxidative phosphorylation and as a dangerously reactive molecule has created pressure for the cell to evolve powerful antioxidant defenses that convert reactive oxygen species (ROS) 3The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; NBD chloride, 4-chloro-7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole; CM-H2DCFDA, 5-(-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorohydrofluorescein diacetate; GR, glutathione reductase; PTP, permeability transition pore; IMAC, inner membrane anion channel; THD, transhydrogenase; 4Cl-DZP, 4′-chlorodiazepam; BCNU, carmustine; DIC, dicarboxylate; Trx, thioredoxin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; TMRM, tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester; MCB, monochlorobimane; GSB, glutathione S-bimane; CsA, cyclosporin A; CM-DCF, chloromethyl dichlorofluorescein.3The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; NBD chloride, 4-chloro-7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole; CM-H2DCFDA, 5-(-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorohydrofluorescein diacetate; GR, glutathione reductase; PTP, permeability transition pore; IMAC, inner membrane anion channel; THD, transhydrogenase; 4Cl-DZP, 4′-chlorodiazepam; BCNU, carmustine; DIC, dicarboxylate; Trx, thioredoxin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; TMRM, tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester; MCB, monochlorobimane; GSB, glutathione S-bimane; CsA, cyclosporin A; CM-DCF, chloromethyl dichlorofluorescein. into harmless products to maintain a predominantly reduced redox environment. This depends on the following two factors: the reduction potential of the electron carriers, and the reducing capacity (i.e. the total concentration of the reduced species) of linked redox couples present in the cytoplasm or in the intraorganellar compartments (e.g. the mitochondrial matrix) of the cell. In addition to the redox couples involved in mitochondrial electron transport (the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides NADH/NAD+, and the flavins FADH2/FAD), the three main cellular redox pairs participating in intracellular reactions include reduced/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG), thioredoxin (Trx(SH)2/TrxSS), and NADPH/NADP+, with the latter providing the thermodynamic driving force behind the glutathione and thioredoxin systems (1Schafer F.Q. Buettner G.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1191-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (3641) Google Scholar). The GSH/GSSG pool is the largest of the cell (2Chance B. Sies H. Boveris A. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 527-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (4819) Google Scholar, 3Rebrin I. Kamzalov S. Sohal R.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 35: 626-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and is considered to be a major indicator of the cellular redox status. GSH is a tripeptide (l-γ-glutamyl-l-cysteinyl-glycine) that is converted from its disulfide form, GSSG, by an NADPH-dependent reductase (glutathione reductase (GR)) whose activity increases in response to an increase in GSSG concentration. GSH provides reducing power for a variety of thiol modifications of disulfide bridges, thioethers, and thioesters and is a substrate for protein glutathionylation (4Shelton M.D. Chock P.B. Mieyal J.J. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2005; 7: 348-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 5Sies H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 916-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar). Overall, the balance of GSH and GSSG provides a dynamic indicator of oxidative stress (6Jones D.P. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 348: 93-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Mitochondria, as the central site of oxygen consumption in the cell during the process of oxidative metabolism, are also a main source of ROS production. At the level of the respiratory chain, the highly positive reduction potential of the oxygen/superoxide anion (O2/O2-˙) redox pair combined with the proximity of other redox pairs such as the ubiquinone (CoQ)/ubisemiquinone radical (CoQ-˙) can result in O2-˙ generation (1Schafer F.Q. Buettner G.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1191-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (3641) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, there is a balance between ROS formation and antioxidant activity; however, under pathological conditions oxidative stress can occur as a consequence of either increased ROS production or by depletion of the antioxidant pool (6Jones D.P. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 348: 93-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 7Droge W. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 47-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (7493) Google Scholar, 8Halliwell B. Thomas C.E.

Higher organisms have adapted to the presence of potentially toxic ROS within cells not only by building up antioxidant defenses but also by harnessing ROS as signaling molecules for regulating the activity of the cell. Changes in the cellular redox environment, both oxidative and reductive, can trigger redox cascades altering signal transduction, DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, enzyme regulation, gene expression, and cell cycle progression (9Abate C.

For some proteins (e.g. phosphofructokinase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, ribonuclease A, and lysozyme), oxidized thiols (disulfide state) are essential for biological function (14Gilbert H.F.

Such is the case for the ryanodine receptor of the sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle cells, which possesses sensitive sulfhydryl groups that influence the rate of Ca2+ release depending upon the thiol redox status (16Xia R. Stangler T. Abramson J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36556-36561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Considerable evidence also shows that agents altering GSH concentration affect transcription of detoxification enzymes, cell proliferation, and apoptosis (17Hall A.G. Eur. J. Clin.

GSH is synthesized in the cytoplasm and is exchanged with other intracellular compartments, with overall cellular GSH/GSSG ratios ranging between 30:1 and 300:1, but with the exception that the endoplasmic reticulum maintains a relatively oxidative environment with ratios of 1:1 to 3:1 (14Gilbert H.F.

Mitochondria do not synthesize GSH but are able to transport and accumulate up to ∼15% of the total cellular GSH (1Schafer F.Q. Buettner G.R. Free Radic. Biol.

As both a source and target of ROS production, the importance of the antioxidant capacity of mitochondria has been emphasized in recent years. An established target of oxidative stress in mitochondria is the permeability transition pore (PTP), a major player in initiating both apoptotic and necrotic cell death. Oxidative stress through oxidation of intracellular GSH and other critical sulfhydryl groups favors the PTP opening (20Chernyak B.V. Biosci.

A reproducible threshold of oxidation of an ROS-sensitive reporter preceded the first global ΔΨm transition of the mitochondrial network, and we referred to this sensitive state as “mitochondrial criticality” (27Aon M.A. Cortassa S. O'Rourke B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4447-4452Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This complex self-organizing phenomenon was scaled to alter the electrical and Ca2+ handling properties of the whole cell and contributed to the arrhythmias induced by ischemia-reperfusion in the whole heart (28Akar F.G. Aon M.A. Tomaselli G.F. O'Rourke B. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 3527-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 29Aon M.A. Cortassa S. Akar F.G. O'Rourke B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1762: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Further investigation into the mechanism of this phenomenon revealed that several inhibitors of the mitochondrial inner membrane anion channel (IMAC) could reversibly suppress or prevent the mitochondrial ROS-induced ROS release response, thereby stabilizing ΔΨm (28Akar F.G. Aon M.A. Tomaselli G.F. O'Rourke B. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 3527-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). A computational model also supported a mechanistic scheme involving the activation of IMAC by ROS (26Cortassa S. Aon M.A. Winslow R.L. O'Rourke B. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 2060-2073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigate the role played by the glutathione redox potential in the approach to mitochondrial criticality and the collapse of ΔΨm in the mitochondrial network. We show that the glutathione redox status determines the rate of mitochondrial ROS production and that the changes in the absolute concentrations of GSH and GSSG as well as the GSH/GSSG ratio, trigger, at moderate ratios (150:1 to 100:1), the reversible opening of IMAC and, at a lower ratio (50:1), irreversible PTP activation. Cardiomyocyte Isolation and Handling—Cardiomyocytes were prepared from adult guinea pig hearts using a Langendorff perfusion system as described before (23O'Rourke B. Ramza B.M. Marban E. Science. 1994; 265: 962-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The freshly isolated cells were handled as described before (25Aon M.A. Cortassa S. Marban E. O'Rourke B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44735-44744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 26Cortassa S. Aon M.A. Winslow R.L. O'Rourke B. Biophys.

Briefly, after isolation, cells were either immediately used for imaging or stored in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (10-013 DMEM, Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA) containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for at least 2 h before assaying them. Experimental recordings of the freshly isolated cells (with or without storage in DMEM) started after suspending them in Tyrode solution containing (in mm) the following: 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 1 CaCl2, pH 7.5 (adjusted with NaOH), supplemented with 10 mm glucose or the addition of diamide when indicated. The perfusion chamber containing the cardiomyocytes was thermostatically controlled at 37 °C with unrestricted access to atmospheric oxygen on the stage of a Nikon E600FN upright microscope. Fluorescent Probes and Loading Conditions—Tetramethylrhodamine ethyl (or methyl) ester (TMRM) accumulates across polarized membranes with a Nernstian distribution. ROS production was monitored with the ROS-sensitive fluorescent probe 5-(-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorohydrofluorescein diacetate (CM-H2DCFDA, Invitrogen) (25Aon M.A. Cortassa S. Marban E. O'Rourke B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44735-44744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Reduced glutathione (GSH) was measured in myocytes loaded with the membrane permeant indicator monochlorobimane (MCB) (26Cortassa S. Aon M.A. Winslow R.L. O'Rourke B. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 2060-2073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 30Kosower N.S. Kosower E.M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 76-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This probe reports the level of GSH as the fluorescent product glutathione S-bimane (GSB) according to the reversible reaction, MCB + GSH ⇔ GSB. We have determined that concentrations up to 50 μm MCB do not deplete the intracellular pool of GSH to a level that compromises cell viability. The concentrations of the probes were 100 nm TMRM, 2 μm CM-H2DCFDA, and 50 μm MCB, and they were loaded into the cells for at least 20 min at 37 °C. The response of the MCB fluorescence to changes in GSH was quantified by the addition of exogenous GSH (see also below and Supplemental Material). Two-photon Microscopy—The equipment and methods utilized for imaging isolated cardiomyocytes were as described previously (25Aon M.A. Cortassa S. Marban E. O'Rourke B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44735-44744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 26Cortassa S. Aon M.A. Winslow R.L. O'Rourke B. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 2060-2073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Images were recorded using a two-photon laser scanning microscope (Bio-Rad MRC-1024MP) with excitation at 740 nm (or 780 nm for GSB imaging). The red emission of TMRM was collected at 605 ± 25 nm; the green emission of CM-DCF was recorded at 525 ± 25 nm, and the blue GSB emission was recorded at 480 ± 20 nm. The NADH emission was collected as the total fluorescence <490 nm. Because of the overlap of NADH and GSB emissions (at steady state, NADH emission was approximately one-third that of GSB (26Cortassa S. Aon M.A. Winslow R.L. O'Rourke B. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 2060-2073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 31Lemar K.M. Passa O. Aon M.A. Cortassa S. Muller C.T. Plummer S. O'Rourke B. Lloyd D. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 3257-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar)), separate experiments were conducted in which we monitored either ΔΨm, ROS, and NADH or ΔΨm and GSB, with cells loaded with TMRM and CM-DCF or TMRM and MCB, respectively. Images were collected simultaneously at the indicated time intervals (3.5, 5, or 30 s) and stored as described before (25Aon M.A. Cortassa S. Marban E. O'Rourke B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44735-44744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Permeabilization Procedure of Cardiomyocytes—Myocytes, which had been stored in DMEM for at least 2 h (which facilitates repletion of the cellular glutathione pool), were resuspended in the experimental solution, and the fluorescent probes were loaded directly in the perfusion chamber on the stage of the microscope for at least 20 min at 37 °C before starting the experiment. The permeabilizing solution (PS) contained 25 μg/ml saponin (to selectively permeabilize the sarcolemma but not the mitochondrial membranes) and (in mm) 130 potassium methanesulfonate, 20 KCl, 0.5 MgCl2, 10 HEPES-Na, 0.1 EGTA, 3 ATP, 5 pyruvate; the pH was adjusted to 7.2 with KOH and was perfused into the chamber for 2.5 min. Controls were performed to determine the efficiency of permeabilization by comparing the effects of solutions with or without saponin but containing the same GSH/GSSG ratios as shown in the results (with GSH constant at 3 mm). In the absence of saponin, there was no response of the mitochondria to lowering the GSH/GSSG ratio to <50:1. In the first set of experiments GSH/GSSG was varied in the presence of a fixed GSH level (at either 1, 3, or 4 mm) by increasing the GSSG concentration. In other experiments, as indicated under “Results,” the GSSG concentration was fixed at 10 μm, and the GSH was varied. The initial permeabilization of the cells was always carried out in the presence of a 300:1 GSH/GSSG ratio. TMRM, CM-H2DCFDA, or MCB was included in the perfusion solution in most experiments to avoid any loss of the mitochondria-localized dyes in the course of the experiment in permeabilized cells subjected to changes in the GSH/GSSG ratio. A main aim of the permeabilization was to preserve mitochondrial integrity along with facilitating the access to cells of the perfusion solution. Several controls were run in order to verify mitochondrial function and the extent of permeabilization. These are described in the Supplemental Material. Kinetic Experiments with Intact and Permeabilized Cardiomyocytes—Kinetic experiments with intact or permeabilized cardiomyocytes were carried out at 37 °C in a thermostatically controlled flow chamber mounted on the stage of the upright microscope (Nikon E600FN) attached to the multiphoton laser scanning system. A constant flow was controlled with a peristaltic pump. With the fluorescent dye carboxyfluorescein (not taken up by the cells), we determined that the delay time for a compound to increase from 10 to 90% of its final concentration was 60 s for the chamber utilized. TMRM- and CM-DCF-loaded or TMRM- and MCB-loaded cardiomyocytes were perfused with normal modified Tyrode's solution (as described above for cardiomyocyte isolation) containing 1 mm Ca2+ in the absence or presence of different reagents (e.g. diamide). Quantification of Intracellular GSH—GSH levels in intact cells were monitored after incubating the cells with MCB. To determine the intracellular concentration of GSH (in mm), we performed in vitro calibrations by serially diluting a 10 mm GSB stock solution that was loaded into glass microcapillaries and placed in the same field as MCB-loaded myocytes. Purified glutathione S-transferase (GST, from rabbit liver; Sigma) was used to catalyze (37 °C) the reaction of GSH and MCB in an assay mixture consisting of the following (in mm): 10 PO4KH2/10 HEPES, pH 7.1, 0.2 MCB, 10 GSH, and 3 units of GST. The time course of the reaction was monitored with fluorometry at maximal emission of the fluorescent adduct GSB (λem = 390 nm; λex = 480 nm). We used a fluorometer (Photon Technology International) equipped with an adjustable photomultiplier and a thermostated cuvette with stirring. To calibrate the two-photon microscope for the measurement of intracellular GSH, we filled the microcapillaries (50 μm diameter) with known amounts of GSB obtained as described above. The capillaries were imaged by two-photon microscopy in the range 1-10 mm with a linear response obtained in the range 1-5 mm (supplemental Fig. S3A). This calibration standard was used as a reference for measuring intracellular GSH in myocytes loaded with MCB. The two-photon imaging of the myocytes loaded with 50 μm MCB was performed in the presence of a 3 mm GSB-filled microcapillary as an internal standard (supplemental Fig. S3B). The steady state cell GSB fluorescence signal was measured and referred to the internal standard of 3 mm GSB. Using this method we found an ∼2.7 mm concentration of GSH in isolated cardiomyocytes from guinea pig in high K+ or DMEM (see supplemental Fig. S3C). We have previously shown that cell-wide oscillations in mitochondrial energetics in adult ventricular myocytes are preceded by a threshold level of oxidation of the ROS probe CM-H2DCF (25Aon M.A. Cortassa S.

A. 2004; 101: 4447-4452Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). As an alternative method to induce oxidative stress in the myocyte, we tested whether a pro-oxidative shift in the thiol status of glutathione, the largest cellular redox pool, influenced mitochondrial ROS accumulation and triggered ΔΨm oscillations. Several intracellular variables related to the mitochondrial functional status (ΔΨm, NADH, ROS, and GSH) were monitored in intact cardiomyocytes in the absence or presence of the thiol oxidant diamide (0.1 mm), which effectively depletes the reduced glutathione pool (5Sies H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 916-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar, 32Kosower N.S. Kosower E.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Diamide induced an increased rate of mitochondrial ROS production that, upon reaching a threshold level of oxidative stress, triggered oscillations in ΔΨm and NADH (Fig. 1A, 1st arrow). Further depletion of GSH in the presence of diamide resulted in the eventual irreversible depolarization of ΔΨm, followed ∼800 s later by cell contracture (Fig. 1A, 2nd arrow). A higher concentration of diamide (1 mm) provoked rapid ΔΨm loss and cell contracture without traversing the oscillatory domain (data not shown). Similar results were also obtained with another thiol-oxidizing agent, diallyldisulfide (31Lemar K.M. Passa O. Aon M.A. Cortassa S. Muller C.T. Plummer S. O'Rourke B. Lloyd D. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 3257-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), a component of garlic extract (data not shown). Exposure of the cells to 4′-chlorodiazepam (4Cl-DZP) during the diamide-induced ΔΨm oscillations stabilized ΔΨm, reversed the oxidation of the mitochondrial NADH pool, and slowed the rate of CM-H2DCF oxidation (Fig. 1B). This effect was reversible; after washout of 4Cl-DZP in the presence of diamide, the rate ROS production increased, the NADH pool oxidized, and ΔΨm depolarized, subsequently ending in cell contracture. ΔΨm oscillation and sustained loss of ΔΨm were correlated with the gradual depletion of the intracellular GSH pool, as monitored by a continuous decrease in the fluorescence levels of the GSB adduct (Fig. 1C). The effect of 4Cl-DZP to stabilize ΔΨm in the presence of diamide (Fig. 2A) was not reproduced with the PTP inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA; Fig. 2B), indicating that 4Cl-DZP was inhibiting a distinct target on the inner membrane (25Aon M.A. Cortassa S. Marban E. O'Rourke B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44735-44744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 33Beavis A.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 77-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In fact, although 4Cl-DZP had a repolarizing influence of ΔΨm that could be washed out to re-initiate oscillations, CsA exacerbated mitochondrial depolarization (probably a nonspecific toxic effect that is opposite to what would be expected for inhibition of PTP), with partial restoration of oscillation upon washout. Thus, moderate depletion of GSH with diamide triggers reversible 4Cl-DZP-sensitive oscillations in ΔΨm. Continued exposure to diamide for a long time severely depletes the GSH antioxidant pool and activates the PTP irreversibly (at the arrows in Figs. 1 and 2). Taken together, the results suggest that the mitochondrial oscillations elicited by diamide are consistent with the mechanism we have described previously for other triggers of metabolic stress, i.e. that mitochondrial oxidative stress triggers the activation of IMAC as part of a self-sustaining limit cycle oscillator (25Aon M.A. Cortassa S. Marban E. O'Rourke B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44735-44744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 26Cortassa S. Aon M.A. Winslow R.L. O'Rourke B. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 2060-2073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Importantly, these results strongly suggest that GSH, and likely the glutathione redox potential, are main cellular variables that determine the approach of the mitochondrial network to criticality through an increase in oxidative stress. In the next section, we test this possibility in a permeabilized cell system. Varying GSH/GSSG—In the first series of experiments in saponin-permeabilized cardiomyocytes, cells were exposed progressively to GSH/GSSG ratios ranging from 300:1 to 50:1 effected by increasing the concentration of GSSG while keeping the GSH constant at 3 mm. This concentration of GSH was used because it was close to the intracellular [GSH] determined in freshly isolated cardiomyocytes using MCB as a probe (see under “Experimental Procedures” and Suppleme"

Thus, the selection of carbonate skeletal minerals appears to have been dictated by seawater chemistry at the time a clade first acquired its mineralized skeleton."
https://openalex.org/W2122294619,"How inflammatory stimuli signal to the nucleus to restrict inflammation is poorly understood. Protein inhibitor of activated STAT1 (PIAS1), a transcriptional regulator that possesses small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) E3 ligase activity, inhibits immune responses by selectively blocking the binding of NF-κB and STAT1 to gene promoters. We report here that PIAS1 becomes rapidly phosphorylated on Ser90 residue in response to various inflammatory stimuli. Mutational studies indicate that Ser90 phosphorylation is required for PIAS1 to repress transcription. Upon TNF treatment, wild-type PIAS1, but not the Ser90A mutant, becomes rapidly associated with the promoters of NF-κB target genes. Furthermore, IKKα, but not IKKβ, interacts with PIAS1 in vivo and mediates PIAS1 Ser90 phosphorylation, a process that requires the SUMO ligase activity of PIAS1. Our results identify a signaling pathway in which proinflammatory stimuli activate the IKKα-mediated sumoylation-dependent phosphorylation of PIAS1 for the immediate repression of inflammatory gene activation."

Protein synthesis is in all organisms terminated by a class I release factor (RF) binding to a ribosome whose A site is programmed with a stop codon and whose P site is bound with peptidyl-tRNA. The bacterial class I RFs, RF1 and RF2, recognize the stop codons UAG/UAA and UGA/UAA, respectively (Scolnick et al., 1968Scolnick E. Tompkins R. Caskey T. Nirenberg M.

RF3 is one of the four major GTPases that participate in mRNA translation, with the other ones being initiation factor 2 (IF2), elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), and elongation factor G (EF-G).

The cryo-EM structure of a translation initiation complex from Escherichia coli.Cell. 2005; 121: 703-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). During its working cycle, RF3 enters the ribosome in complex with GDP (Zavialov et al., 2001Zavialov A.V. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. A posttermination ribosomal complex is the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for peptide release factor RF3.Cell. 2001; 107: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). This binding event results in rapid exchange of GDP for GTP, provided that there is a class I RF in the A site and a deacylated tRNA in the P site (Zavialov et al., 2002Zavialov A.V. Mora L.

Cell. 2002; 10: 789-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Separately, RF3, in complex with the noncleavable GTP analog GDPNP and RF1/RF2, has high affinity to the posttermination ribosome, but RF1/RF2 and RF3•GDPNP destabilize each other's binding to the posttermination ribosome with a deacylated P-site tRNA so that the presence of RF3•GTP is expected to greatly accelerate the dissociation of RF1/RF2 (Zavialov et al., 2001Zavialov A.V.

A posttermination ribosomal complex is the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for peptide release factor RF3.Cell. 2001; 107: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). From these observations it was postulated that GDP-to-GTP exchange on RF3 requires formation of a ribosome structure with high affinity to RF3•GTP (Zavialov et al., 2002Zavialov A.V. Mora L.

For EF-G and IF2, large conformational changes of the ribosome have indeed been observed in conjunction with the removal of the peptide from the P-site-bound tRNA, characterized as a ratchet-like rotation of the 30S subunit relative to the 50S subunit (Frank and Agrawal, 2000Frank J.

At the end of the RF3 working cycle, class I RF dissociation is followed by rapid hydrolysis of GTP on RF3 and swift release of RF3•GDP from the ribosome (Zavialov et al., 2001Zavialov A.V.

Visualization of release factor 3 on the ribosome during termination of protein synthesis.Nature. 2004; 427: 862-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar reported a cryo-EM study of RF3 in complex with GDPNP when present in a peptide-free release complex (RC; a complex consisting of the ribosome with a stop codon in the A site and a peptidyl-tRNA in the P site). Surprisingly, interpreted from two density maps at resolutions of 24 Å and 25 Å, the complex was seen in two states that differed in the conformations of both the ribosome and RF3, as well as in the location of tRNA. The fact that RF3 in complex with GDPNP is known to bind very stably to the peptide-free RC (Zavialov et al., 2001Zavialov A.V. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. A posttermination ribosomal complex is the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for peptide release factor RF3.Cell. 2001; 107: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) raises the question whether the structures obtained by Klaholz et al., 2004Klaholz B.P. Myasnikov A.G. van Heel M. Visualization of release factor 3 on the ribosome during termination of protein synthesis.Nature. 2004; 427: 862-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar represent RF3 in the authentic GTP form. Here we describe the crystal structure of E. coli RF3 in the GDP-bound state. It has three distinct domains and is remarkably similar in conformation to the crystal structure of EF-Tu•GTP. Moreover, we present a cryo-EM density map of ribosome-bound RF3•GDPNP. Docking the crystal structure of RF3•GDP into the density map of the ribosome-bound RF3•GDPNP reveals that the binding of RF3•GDPNP leads to large conformational changes of the ribosome, which cause rapid dissociation of the class I RFs. These results, together with in vitro studies of RF3 mutants identified from the crystal structure of RF3•GDP, have now allowed a structural interpretation of previous biochemical data regarding RF3's mode of action (Zavialov et al., 2001Zavialov A.V.

The polypeptide chain of RF3•GDP is folded into three distinct domains (Figure 1A). Domain I (residues 3–278) is composed of a classic GTPase domain (G domain) and an “EF-G-like” G′ subdomain (Laurberg et al., 2000Laurberg M. Kristensen O. Martemyanov K. Gudkov A.T. Nagaev I.

The crystal structure of elongation factor G complexed with GDP, at 2.7 A resolution.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3661-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Domain I is connected to domain II (residues 294–387) by a peptide stretch with a small antiparallel β sheet in the middle (residues 279–293). Domain II forms a β-barrel structure as observed in EF-Tu (Song et al., 1999Song H. Parsons M.R. Rowsell S. Leonard G. Phillips S.E.

Cell. 2004; 14: 233-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and EF-G (Czworkowski et al., 1994Czworkowski J. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Moore P.B. The crystal structure of elongation factor G complexed with GDP, at 2.7 A resolution.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3661-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Domain II is connected to domain III (residues 391–529) by a short peptide linker. Domain III, composed of a central β-barrel flanked by two α helices, may represent a novel fold since no structural homolog was found in a Dali search. Sequence analysis suggests the structures of RF3 and EF-G to be similar (Kisselev and Buckingham, 2000Kisselev L.L. Buckingham R.H. Translational termination comes of age.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 561-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). To verify this prediction, we compared the crystal structure of RF3•GDP with that of a His573Ala mutant of EF-G (Laurberg et al., 2000Laurberg M. Kristensen O. Martemyanov K. Gudkov A.T. Nagaev I. Hughes D. Liljas A. Structure of a mutant EF-G reveals domain III and possibly the fusidic acid binding site.J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 593-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Superposition of the RF3•GDP domains G and G′, including the switch 2 region and the β-meander in the G′ subdomain, onto the corresponding EF-G•GDP domains, reveals great core domain similarity between the two translation factors (root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) = 1.5 Å; Figure 1D). There are, however, also notable differences between the two structures. First, helix α6 of G′ domain in RF3•GDP has no counterpart in EF-G•GDP. Second, helix α7 of RF3•GDP and the corresponding helix A of EF-G•GDP have distinct conformations with relative shifts of the equivalent Cα atoms up to 7 Å. Third, while helix α8 of RF3•GDP matches part of helix C of EF-G•GDP, helix B of EF-G•GDP has no counterpart in RF3•GDP (Figure 1E). These structural differences are in line with sequence differences in these regions of the two molecules (Figure S1). Domain II of RF3•GDP and EF-G•GDP are quite similar, with an rmsd of 1.4 Å as estimated by superposition of the two domains. When G domain of RF3•GDP is superposed on that of EF-G•GDP, the orientations of domain II differ by only 13° (Figure 1D). Notably, the switch 1 region is disordered in both RF3•GDP and EF-G•GDP, and beyond domain II there is no structural similarity between the two molecules (Figure 1D). The tertiary structure of RF3•GDP is distinct from that of EF-Tu•GDP (Figure 1C) but is markedly similar to that of EF-Tu•GDPNP (EF-Tu•GTP; Figure 1B). The rmsd for the superposed domains I and II of RF3•GDP and EF-Tu•GDPNP is only 1.6 Å, and their switch 2 regions are strikingly similar (Figure 1F). The switch 1 region of RF3•GDP is disordered, but the structural similarities of the switch 2 regions and the whole G domains of EF-Tu•GTP and RF3•GDP suggest similar conformations also for their switch 1 regions. There is, in contrast, no match between domain III of RF3•GDP and EF-Tu•GTP due to their distinct overall folds (Figure 1F). The interactions of the guanine moiety, the ribose ring, and the α-phosphate of GDP with the RF3 protein residues are very similar to the GDP interactions for EF-Tu (Song et al., 1999Song H. Parsons M.R. Rowsell S. Leonard G. Phillips S.E. Crystal structure of intact elongation factor EF-Tu from Escherichia coli in GDP conformation at 2.05 A resolution.J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), EF-G (Laurberg et al., 2000Laurberg M. Kristensen O. Martemyanov K. Gudkov A.T. Nagaev I. Hughes D. Liljas A.

Biol. 2000; 303: 593-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and eRF3 (Kong et al., 2004Kong C. Ito K. Walsh M.A. Wada M. Liu Y. Kumar S. Barford D. Nakamura Y. Song H.

Cell. 2004; 14: 233-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). A unique structural feature of RF3•GDP is the location of a conserved His92 residue in the switch 2 region, which at the sequence level corresponds to His84 for EF-Tu and His87 for EF-G (Figure S1). His92 is well defined in the electron density map and makes multiple contacts with the β-phosphate group of GDP (Figure 1G), suggesting that it contributes to the high-affinity binding of GDP to RF3 (Zavialov et al., 2001Zavialov A.V. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. A posttermination ribosomal complex is the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for peptide release factor RF3.Cell. 2001; 107: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In contrast, His84 in EF-Tu•GDP and His87 in EF-G•GDP are separated by ∼10 Å from GDP (Figure 1G). As will be described below, His92 may also be involved in the triggering of GTP hydrolysis on ribosome-bound RF3, possibly by the same mechanism as proposed for His84 in EF-Tu (Kjeldgaard et al., 1993Kjeldgaard M. Nissen P. Thirup S. Nyborg J. The crystal structure of elongation factor EF-Tu from Thermus aquaticus in the GTP conformation.Structure. 1993; 1: 35-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Mg2+ ions are considered to be essential cofactors for GTP hydrolysis in all G proteins. However, no Mg2+ ion was observed in the crystal structure of RF3•GDP, although the crystallization buffer contained 5 mM MgCl2. In contrast, residues Asp50 and Asp80 of EF-Tu, corresponding to Asp58 and Asp88 of RF3, respectively (Figure S1), coordinate an Mg2+ ion in the crystal structures of both EF-Tu•GDP and EF-Tu•GTP (Kjeldgaard et al., 1993Kjeldgaard M. Nissen P. Thirup S. Nyborg J. The crystal structure of elongation factor EF-Tu from Thermus aquaticus in the GTP conformation.Structure. 1993; 1: 35-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, Song et al., 1999Song H. Parsons M.R. Rowsell S. Leonard G. Phillips S.E. Crystal structure of intact elongation factor EF-Tu from Escherichia coli in GDP conformation at 2.05 A resolution.J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In the structure of RF3•GDP, Asp58 of switch 1 is disordered, and Asp88 of switch 2 is too far away to coordinate Mg2+ in its putative binding site (Figures 1A and 1G). It is, moreover, not unlikely that the presence of the positively charged His92 in RF3 further reduces the affinity of Mg2+ so that all these features could explain why Mg2+ is absent in the crystal but, by hypothesis, not in the native structure of RF3•GDP. Mapping of the sequence conservation shared by prokaryotic RF3 proteins on the surface of the crystal structure of RF3•GDP reveals two conserved patches. One is in the guanine nucleotide-binding region, including His92, and another in the interface between domains II and III (Figure 2A). To clarify the functional roles of these conserved surface regions, the RF3 variants H311A, R312A, E396A, Q445A, V448A, R452A, E456A, and Y457A were created by site-directed mutagenesis, expressed in E. coli, and purified to homogeneity. Mutation of His92 to Ala, Asn, or Asp either inhibited protein expression or resulted in an insoluble protein. However, a highly soluble double mutant His92Ala Pro90Gln (H92A P90Q) and, as a control, a single P90Q mutant could be expressed and purified. We studied the ability of the wild-type and mutated variants of RF3 to accelerate recycling of RF1 or RF2 during termination on a RC containing an MFTI tetrapeptidyl-tRNAIle in the P site and a UAA stop codon in the A site. In these experiments, the ribosomes were present in excess, and each class I release factor had to recycle many times for complete termination (Freistroffer et al., 1997Freistroffer D. Pavlov M.Y. MacDougall J. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M.

A posttermination ribosomal complex is the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for peptide release factor RF3.Cell. 2001; 107: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We found an approximately 10-fold acceleration of recycling of both RF1 and RF2 by wild-type RF3. The recycling activities of the R312A, E396A, Q445A, and V448A mutants were similar to, or slightly lower than, those of wild-type RF3. The E456A and Y457A mutants had significantly, and the H311A and R452A mutants had strongly, reduced recycling activities compared to those of wild-type RF3. The recycling activity of the H92A P90Q double mutant was virtually zero, while the single P90Q mutation had an insignificant effect on the recycling activity (Figure 2B; Table S1). The RF3 mutants H311A, R452A, and H92A P90Q, with strongly reduced recycling activities, were subjected to further studies relating to their guanine nucleotide-binding affinities and GDP exchange rates off, as well as on, RC. From nitrocellulose-filter binding (Zavialov et al., 2001Zavialov A.V. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. A posttermination ribosomal complex is the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for peptide release factor RF3.Cell. 2001; 107: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), the dissociation equilibrium constants (KD-GDP) for GDP binding to free RF3 were estimated as 5.6 nM (wild-type), 6.7 nM (H311A), 6.6 nM (R452A), and 18 nM (H92A P90Q). In experiments where radio-labeled GDP was chased from RF3 by unlabeled and repurified GTP, the ratio KD-GTP/KD-GDP between the dissociation equilibrium constants for GTP (KD-GTP) and GDP (KD-GDP) was estimated for each one of these RF3 mutants. The ratios for the wild-type, H311A, and R452A RF3 variants were similar and about 2-fold larger than the ratio for the H92A P90Q double mutant (Table S2; Figure S2). The rates of GDP exchange for these mutants were estimated from stopped-flow experiments in which a solution with RF3-bound mant-GDP was rapidly mixed with a solution containing native GDP followed by recording of the time-dependent fluorescence decrease (Moore et al., 1992Moore K.J. Lowe P.N. Eccleston J.F. The kinetic mechanism of the GAP-activated GTPase of p21 ras.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 13771-13778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In line with the estimates for the equilibrium dissociation constant, the GDP dissociation rate constants were similar for the wild-type (0.036 s−1), H311A (0.036 s−1), and R452A (0.032 s−1) variants and were a little more than 2-fold larger for the H92A P90Q (0.080 s−1) variant and a little less than 2-fold larger for the P90Q (0.060 s−1) single mutant. Very similar rate constants for GDP dissociation from these RF3 variants were estimated by nitrocellulose-binding experiments in which radio-labeled GDP was chased from RF3 by unlabeled GDP (data not shown). We used stopped-flow to study also the rates of mant-GDP exchange for native GDP when solutions of mant-GDP bound RF3 variants were rapidly mixed with a solution of RF2-containing RC. The effective GDP dissociation rate constant was largest for wild-type RF3 (10.5 s−1) and factors of 50, 9, or about 30 smaller for the H311A (0.19 s−1), R452A (1.2 s−1) and H92A P90Q (0.31 s−1) variants, respectively. The effective GDP dissociation rate constant for the single P90Q mutant (5.6 s−1) was just 2-fold smaller than for the wild-type RF3, suggesting that the greatly reduced GDP exchange rate by the H92A P90Q mutations was mainly due to the H92A, rather than to the P90Q alteration (Figure 2C; Table"

To examine the roles of different components in ERAD, one fluorescence-labeled ERAD substrate was encapsulated with selected lumenal factors inside mammalian microsomes. After mixing microsomes with fluorescence-quenching agents and selected cytosolic proteins, the rate of substrate efflux was monitored continuously in real time by the decrease in fluorescence intensity as cytosolic quenchers contacted dye-labeled substrates. The retrotranslocation kinetics of nonglycosylated pro-alpha factor were not significantly altered by replacing all lumenal proteins with only protein disulfide isomerase or all cytosolic proteins with only PA700, the 19S regulatory particle of the 26S proteasome. Retrotranslocation was blocked by antibodies against a putative retrotranslocation channel protein, derlin-1, but not Sec61alpha. In addition, pro-alpha factor photocrosslinked derlin-1, but not Sec61alpha. Thus, derlin-1 appears to be involved in pro-alpha factor retrotranslocation."

Fatal deficiencies of lung surfactant in the neonate and interstitial lung disease have recently been associated with mutations in the ATP-binding cassette protein A3 gene (ABCA3) (15Shulenin S.

Similarly, the lamellar bodies in electron micrographs from lung tissue of infants with surfactant deficiency and ABCA3 mutations have dense inclusions and are structurally immature (15Shulenin S.

ABCA3 expressed exogenously in cultured cells, in the absence of surfactant proteins, facilitates the transfer of phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol into the lysosomes, the likely progenitor of lamellar bodies, whereas the surfactant in infants with ABCA3 mutations has decreased phosphatidylcholine content (17Cheong N.

Decreased expression of ABCA3 in both isolated AT2 cells and in lungs alters the expression, localization, and processing of SP-B protein (16Bullard J.E. Wert S.E. Whitsett J.A. Dean M. Nogee L.M.

Together, these findings are suggestive that ABCA3 is responsible for converting lysosomes or similar vesicular bodies into phospholipid storage organelles, which are then transformed into lamellar bodies by the subsequent trafficking and processing of SP-B and SP-C. To further explore the role of ABCA3 expression, an in vivo mouse model of Abca3 gene disruption was generated. Overall, the Abca3 knock-out mouse phenotype was similar to the clinical findings in patients with the most severe forms of surfactant deficiency associated with ABCA3 mutations. Abca3 null mice were underrepresented late in gestation, and those that reached term died soon after birth, establishing an unambiguous causal link between ABCA3 and fatal surfactant deficiency. As in the infants, lung architecture, AT2 cell morphology, surfactant protein-B processing, and lipid synthesis were all disrupted. Both the Abca3–/– and Abca3+/– mice will be useful models for providing insights into surfactant metabolism in normal and disease states. Generation of Abca3–/– Mice—Heterozygous Abca3+/– founder mice were obtained from Deltagen (San Carlos, CA). A 6.93-kb IRES-LacZ reporter and neomycin resistance cassette (IRES-LacZ-neo) was subcloned into a 5.4-kb fragment isolated from a mouse genomic phage library, such that 70 base pairs coding for the protein were replaced by IRES-LacZ-neo. The IRES-LacZ-neo cassette was flanked by 3.9 kb of mouse genomic DNA at its 5′ aspect and 1.5 kb of mouse genomic DNA at its 3′ aspect. The targeting vector was linearized and electroporated into 129/OlaHsd mouse embryonic stem cells. Embryonic stem cells were selected for G418 resistance, and colonies carrying the homologously integrated neomycin DNA were identified by PCR amplification using a 5′ neomycin-specific primer (5′-GGGATCTTGGCCATGGTAAGCTGAT-3′) paired with a primer located outside the targeting homology arms on the 5′ side (GS1; 5′-AGTGAATCCCAAAGATGCGCAAGGC-3′). The homologous recombination event was confirmed on the 3′ side using a 3′ neomycin-specific primer (5′-GAAGAACGAGATCAGCAGCCTCTGTTCC-3′) paired with a primer located outside the targeting homology arm on the 3′ side (GS2; 5′-TGGTGGGAGTTGTGTACCATCTGCC-3′). Colonies that gave rise to the correct size PCR product were confirmed by Southern blot analysis using a probe adjacent to the 3′ region of homology. The presence of a single neomycin cassette was confirmed by Southern blot analysis using a neomycin gene fragment as a probe. Male chimeric mice were generated by injection of the targeted embryonic stem cells into C57Bl/6J blastocysts. Chimeric mice were bred with C57Bl/6J mice to produce F1 heterozygotes. Germ line transmission was confirmed by PCR analysis. Initial germ line heterozygotes were also tested for the homologous recombination event using the primers described above (located outside of the targeting construct). Following confirmation of the targeting event in animals, subsequent genotyping tracked transmission of the targeting construct. F1 heterozygous males and females were mated to produce F2 wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous null mutant animals. Mice were backcrossed with C57BL/6J mice, and all phenotypic analysis was performed in a hybrid C57Bl/6J/129 background (75%/25%, respectively). PCR Genotyping—PCR primers were as follows: reverse, 5′-TGAGCTGGAATCCACTTGTGTAGTC-3′ (specific for both wild type and targeted alleles); forward 1, 5′-CGCTGGTCATACACCTGTAAAATGC-3′ (specific to wild-type allele); forward 2, 5′-GGGTGGGATTAGATAAATGCCTGCTCT-3′ (specific for targeted allele only, neomycin-specific), generating 274-bp (wild type) and 537-bp (targeted) PCR products, respectively. PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 10 min (one cycle); 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min 30 s (25 cycles); 72 °C 10 min. Histology Tissue Preparation—Lungs were inflated to a constant pressure of 25 cm of H2O with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and immersed in the same fixative for 24 h. Lungs were extensively washed with PBS, dehydrated in a series of increasing alcohol concentrations, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 5-μm-thick sections. Paraffin sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. EM Tissue Preparation—E18.5 embryo lungs were inflated to a pressure of 25 cm of H2O with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde in cacodylate buffer through the trachea, removed, and immersed in the same fixative at 4 °C. For 6-month-old adult mice, lungs were perfused through the pulmonary artery with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde in cacodylate buffer for 15 min while the lungs were artificially ventilated. The lungs were then removed and immersed in the same fixative at 4 °C. After 30 min, both embryonic and adult mouse lungs were cut into 1 × 1-mm pieces and continually fixed for another 6 h and washed with 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) three times, followed by two steps of postfixation: 1% OsO4 in cacodylate buffer and then 2% uranyl acetate in distilled water (1 h for each step). Tissue pieces were embedded in EM-bed 812 resin and polymerized at 60 °C for 48 h. Ultrathin sections (70 nm) were prepared on a Leica Ultracut UCT (Vienna, Austria) with a diamond knife, counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and imaged with a JEOL electron microscope model 100 CX (Tokyo, Japan). Immunohistochemistry—Lungs embedded in cryomatrix were cut into 7-μm sections and then mounted on glass slides. Sections were washed with PBS buffer to remove cryomatrix and treated with blocking buffer containing 5% bovine serum albumin, 10% normal goat serum in PBS (pH 7.4) for 1 h. Sections were incubated with primary antibody, either anti-SP-B antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) at 1:250 dilution or anti-3C9 monoclonal antibody (23Zen K. Notarfrancesco K. Oorschot V. Slot J.W. Fisher A.B. Shuman H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275 (–L183): L172PubMed Google Scholar) (1:250 dilution) in blocking buffer for 1 h. After washing with T-PBS (five times for 5 min each), the sections were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:250 dilution) diluted in blocking buffer. After a final washing (five times for 5 min each with T-PBS and twice for 5 min each with distilled H2O), the sections were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) and observed with a confocal microscope (Radiance 2000; Bio-Rad). Western Blot Analysis of Surfactant Protein Expression in Mouse Fetal Lung Tissue—Lungs were immersed in lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA) containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and homogenized with Pellet Pestle (Kontes). Subsequently, the samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 22,000 × g, and protein in the supernatant was quantified by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Separation of surfactant proteins was carried out under nonreducing conditions followed by Western blotting with 1:5000 dilution of rabbit anti-sheep SP-B (mature SP-B) or rabbit anti-human (prepro-SP-B) (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) or under reducing conditions followed by Western blotting with a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit anti-SP-A polyclonal antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), rabbit anti SP-D polyclonal antibody (Chemicon), or mouse anti-actin monoclonal antibody (Chemicon). Peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was used at a 1:5,000 dilution. Immunoreactive bands were detected with ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Protein bands were quantified by densitometric analyses with Fluor-S MultiImager (Bio-Rad) and Quantity One analysis software. Measurement of Radiolabeled Substrate [3H]Choline or [14C]Palmitate Incorporation into Phospholipids—Briefly, anesthetized mice were injected in the tail vein with a mixture of [methyl-3H]choline (10 μCi; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and [1-14C]palmitate (1 μCi; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After 24 h, the mice were killed by exsanguination under anesthesia. To obtain bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and to isolate subcellular fractions, lungs were lavaged five times with 1 ml of normal saline. Lung surfactant was isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid using sodium chloride gradient centrifugation (24Fisher A.B. Dodia C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280 (–L754): L748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lamellar bodies were isolated from homogenates of post-lavaged lungs by upward flotation using sucrose density gradient centrifugation (24Fisher A.B. Dodia C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280 (–L754): L748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These fractions were extracted by the Bligh and Dyer method, and the organic fraction was further separated into phospholipid classes by TLC (24Fisher A.B. Dodia C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280 (–L754): L748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Fisher A.B. Dodia C. Feinstein S.I. Ho Y.S. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1248-1256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Lipid spots were identified by brief exposure to iodine vapors, scraped, and analyzed for phospholipid phosphorus and radioactivity. Authentic standards were co-chromatographed for identification of individual lipids. The disaturated phosphatidylcholine (DSPC) fraction was separated from total PC on a neutral alumina column after treatment of the PC fraction with OsO4. Incorporation was calculated as dpm/nmol of phospholipid (26Mason R.J. Nellenbogen J. Clements J.A. J. Lipid Res. 1976; 17: 281-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phospholipid was measured by phosphorous analysis. All of the newborn mice were genotyped with PCR, simultaneously detecting the endogenous and targeted alleles (Fig. 1). We examined 167 newborns in 25 litters from eight separate breeding pairs of heterozygous Abca3+/– mice (Table 1). Of these, only 13 were homozygous null Abca3–/– neonates, and none of those survived more than 16 h past birth, whereas 43 of the 50 wild type Abca3+/+ and 92 of the 104 heterozygous Abca3+/– neonates survived for at least 16 h, and most survived far longer. Because Abca3–/– is neonatal lethal, a count of the precise number of Abca3–/– mice was complicated by maternal cannibalism. To obtain a more accurate distribution of genotypes, mice were delivered by cesarean section at embryonic days 18.5 (E18.5) and 19.5 (E19.5). The cumulative distribution of the genotypes of late stage mouse embryos from heterozygote Abca3+/– crosses was 24:44:12 (wild type/heterozygote/null), as shown in Table 2. The frequency of the homozygote null allele was found to be approximately half the expected frequency and differs significantly from purely Mendelian ratios of inheritance, with a 95% confidence level from a χ2 test >5.99. These data suggest that Abca3–/– embryos are only partially viable or that Abca3 is required for appropriate fertilization. Since lung surfactant is not essential until after birth, ABCA3 may have multiple functions other than in surfactant maturation.TABLE 1Homozygous Abca3–/– mice do not survive past birthNumber of surviving pups at PN-1Number of dead pups at PN-1Abca3+/+437Abca3+/-9212Abca3-/-013Total13532 Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Genotype of E18.5 and E19.5 mouse embryosLitter numberNumber of pupsAbca3+/+Abca3+/-Abca3-/-61683502779261617113536817142809103616858440697935168292436989351Total80244412 Open table in a new tab Light Microscopy Analysis—To determine the effect of differential expression of ABCA3 on mouse lung morphology, the lungs of 36 pups from three litters of E18.5 embryos were excised, inflated with 25 cm of H2O of appropriate buffer, and fixed for either light (Fig. 2) or electron microscopy (Fig. 3). We focused on this stage of development, since, like surfactant proteins, ABCA3 is expressed late in gestation (27Mulugeta S. Gray J.M. Notarfrancesco K.L. Gonzales L.W. Koval M. Feinstein S.I.

Although the morphology of the lungs from wild type Abca3+/+ mice was comparatively normal and the lungs appeared well developed (Fig. 2a), lungs from Abca3–/– embryos had thick interalveolar septa and small air spaces compared with Abca3+/+ embryonic lungs (Fig. 2c). The morphology of lungs from the Abca3+/– mice was more variable than either Abca3+/+ or Abca3–/– mice, with some areas of the heterozygote lungs appearing well developed, whereas other areas did not (Fig. 2b). These data suggest that a deficiency or insufficiency of ABCA3 protein leads to abnormal lung development late in gestation.FIGURE 3Ultrastructure of lung AT2 cells from E18.5 fetal Abca3+/+, Abca3+/-, and Abca3–/– littermates. Lamellar bodies (insets) were readily found in AT2 cells of lungs from Abca3+/+ (a) and Abca3+/– mice (b) but not found in lungs from Abca3–/– mice (c). Scale bar, 1 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) EM Analysis—There were also clear differences at the ultrastructual level among the genotypes. In E18.5 lungs, abundant AT2 cells with lamellar bodies were seen in lungs of Abca3+/+ (Fig. 3a) and Abca3+/– (Fig. 3b) mice. Little or no difference in the peripheral epithelial cells of Abca3+/+ and Abca3+/– mouse lungs were observed at this stage. Although, cuboidal AT2 cells were readily observed throughout the peripheral lung epithelium in Abca3–/– embryo lung, no lamellar bodies were detected after extensive searching even in the lungs of animals from the same litter (Fig. 3c), corroborating the earlier in vitro observation that ABCA3 protein expression is necessary for lamellar body genesis (17Cheong N. Madesh M. Gonzales L.W. Zhao M. Yu K. Ballard P.L. Shuman H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9791-9800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Peripheral lung tissues and the surfactant system continue to develop after birth. Although there were no clear differences between Abca3+/+ and Abca3+/– embryonic lungs, qualitative differences in their ultrastructures were apparent 6 months after birth (Fig. 4). Heterozygous mice (Fig. 4, c and d) appeared to have fewer lamellar bodies than wild type mice (Fig. 4, a and b). The expression of SP-B in the absence of ABCA3 was determined in late gestation wild type, heterozygote, and null mouse embryos using immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 5) and Western blot analysis (Fig. 6). Staining for ABCA3 with monoclonal antibody 3C9 was not detected in immunofluorescence images of lungs from E18.5 embryonic Abca3–/– mice (Fig. 5c), but ABCA3 staining was readily observed in lungs from Abca3+/+ (Fig. 5a) and Abca3+/– (Fig. 5b) E18.5 mouse embryos. SP-B staining was decreased in Abca3+/– (Fig. 5e) and Abca3–/– (Fig. 5f) mice compared with Abca3+/+ (Fig. 5d) mice. The level of SP-B in its mature, nonreduced, 16-kDa form was significantly decreased, as demonstrated by Western blot of lung homogenates from Abca3–/– mice compared with Abca3+/+ and Abca3+/– mice (Fig. 6, a and b). However, similar levels of 42-kDa pro-SP-B precursor were found in wild type, heterozygote, and null mice, suggesting that depletion of ABCA3 affects SP-B processing rather than its expression (Fig. 6c). The final step in the processing of SP-B from its 42-kDa proprotein precursor to its mature form occurs in the lamellar bodies of AT2 cells (9Guttentag S.H. Beers M.F. Bieler B. Ballard P.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275 (–L566): L559PubMed Google Scholar, 29Brasch F. Johnen G. Winn-Brasch A. Guttentag S.H. Schmiedl A. Kapp N. Suzuki Y. Muller K.M. Richter J. Hawgood S. Ochs M. Am. J. Respir.

Changes in lamellar body biogenesis caused by lowered ABCA3 expression in patients and isolated human AT2 cells are associated with altered processing of SP-B protein (16Bullard J.E. Wert S.E.

Trafficking of all forms of SP-B to lamellar bodies is decreased in the Abca3–/– mice (Fig. 5). However, the decrease, apparent in the immunofluorescence images, does not appear sufficient to account for the larger decrease in mature SP-B (Fig. 6), suggesting that proteolytic processing of the protein in the lamellar body is also altered. Whether this is due to changes in the distribution of relevant proteases or changes in the protease activity is uncertain. SP-A and SP-D were slightly decreased in lung homogenate from Abca3–/– mice compared with that from wild type and heterozygote Abca3+/– mice with immunoblot analysis (Fig. 6, d and e).FIGURE 6Processing to surfactant protein-B in lungs of Abca3+/+, Abca3+/–, and Abca3–/– mouse embryos.

[3H]Choline and [14C]palmitate were injected intravenously into Abca3+/+ and Abca3+/– mice, and the specific activities of phospholipids were measured after 24 h. Incorporation of substrates into phospholipids in both fractions was expressed as specific activity (dpm/nmol DSPC). The presence of 3H- and 14C-labeled DSPC was significantly (p < 0.05) lower in both lamellar bodies isolated from lung homogenate and surfactant isolated from lung lavage fluid for Abca3+/– compared with Abca3+/+ mice (Fig. 7, a and b). Similarly, the incorporation of [14C]palmitate into other major surfactant phospholipid species PC and PG as well as minor species PE and PS was significantly (p < 0.05) lower in both lamellar bodies isolated from lung homogenate and surfactant isolated from lung lavage fluid for Abca3+/– compared with Abca3+/+ mice (Fig. 7, c and d). The phenotype of mice with targeted disruption of the Abca3 gene was similar to that of human patients with functional or trafficking mutations in the ABCA3 gene (15Shulenin S. Nogee L.M. Annilo T. Wert S.E. Whitsett J.A. Dean M. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 350: 1296-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Homozygous Abca3–/– null mice were of normal size and weight at birth but died soon afterward. Heterozygous Abca3+/– mice were indistinguishable from wild type mice, developing and growing normally. However, the distribution of genotypes from crosses of heterozygous Abca3+/– mice does not follow the pattern expected from Mendelian inheritance, since it yielded the Abca3 null genotype occurring at half the expected frequency (Table 1). We suspect that ABCA3 plays important roles at an earlier stage of embryonic development. This embryonic lethality probably is not related to the role of ABCA3 in surfactant homeostasis, where it is expressed late in development (27Mulugeta S. Gray J.M. Notarfrancesco K.L. Gonzales L.W.

We observed reduced incorporation of radiolabeled phospholipid precursors into dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, PC, and PG as well as minor surfactant phospholipids (PE and PS) into adult Abca3+/– mouse lamellar bodies and surfactant. Clearly, at least one pathway in surfactant lipid processing or trafficking is disrupted in both the Abca3–/– and Abca3+/– mouse model.

Instead of normal lamellar bodies, lysosome-like electron-dense vesicles were found in Abca3–/– mouse AT2 cells (Fig. 3c). A simple explanation for the SP-B processing defect is that the final step in SP-B processing occurs in lamellar bodies, which are absent in the Abca3 null mice (9Guttentag S.H. Beers M.F. Bieler B.

It is less likely that the causal relationship is reversed (i.e. an absence of processed SP-B leads to the absence of lamellar bodies), since lamellar body-like organelles were observed in HEK 293 cells expressing exogenous Abca3 but not expressing SP-B.

Although 6-month-old heterozygous Abca3+/– mice had morphologically (Fig. 4) and functionally (Fig. 7) different lamellar bodies compared with wild type mice, they had no respiratory difficulties. It remains possible that under normal circumstances, heterozygous Abca3+/– mice survive without difficulty but that following lung injury or stress, there is an increased susceptibility to RDS or interstitial lung disease. Overall, disruption of the Abca3 gene in this mouse model demonstrates a clear causal link between ABCA3 expression and lamellar body biogenesis, SP-B processing, and lipid synthesis and trafficking in the lungs of mice."

One protective mechanism involves activation of transcription factors interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3) and NF-κB, resulting in secretion of the antiviral cytokine, interferon-β. Another is induction of apoptosis, killing the host cell before virus disseminates. Mammalian reovirus induces both interferon-β and apoptosis, raising the possibility that both pathways are initiated by a common cellular sensor. We show here that reovirus activates IRF-3 with kinetics that parallel the activation of NF-κB, a known mediator of reovirus-induced apoptosis. Activation of IRF-3 requires functional retinoic acid inducible gene-I and interferon-β promoter stimulator-1, but these intracellular sensors are dispensable for activation of NF-κB.

Interferon-β promoter stimulator-1 and IRF-3 are required for efficient apoptosis following reovirus infection, suggesting a common mechanism of antiviral cytokine induction and activation of the cell death response. A primary function of the innate immune system is to detect nascent viral infections and direct subsequent cellular responses. The innate immune system responds to infection by producing a range of soluble cytokines, such as interferon-β (IFN-β), 5The abbreviations used are: IFN, interferon; TLR, Toll-like receptor; RIG-I, retinoic acid inducible gene-I; Mda-5, melanoma differentiation-associated protein-5; IPS-1, interferon-β promoter stimulator-1; IKK, inhibitor of κB kinase; IRF-3, interferon regulatory factor-3; ISG, interferon-stimulated gene; PKR, protein kinase R; ds, double-stranded; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; T3D, type 3 Dearing; ISVP, infectious subvirion particle; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; MOI, muliplicity of infection; PFU, plaque-forming unit(s); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcription; siRNA, small interfering RNA. that create an antiviral state in surrounding tissue. In response to these immune pressures, viruses have evolved multiple strategies for subverting innate immunity, which frequently center on manipulating cell death pathways. The interface between the innate immune response, viral infection, and the cellular apoptotic machinery is therefore a critical nexus of disease pathogenesis. Cells possess a variety of sensors to detect invading pathogens. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and other pattern recognition receptors, including the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain proteins and RNA helicases such as retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein-5 (Mda-5), recognize viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (1Mogensen T.H. Paludan S.R. J. Mol. Med. 2005; 83: 180-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). TLRs are expressed on the cell surface and recognize extracellular pathogen-associated molecular patterns, whereas RIG-I and Mda-5 detect intracellular viral RNA products (2Sumpter R.J. Loo Y.M.

IPS-1 activates inhibitor of κB kinase (IKK)-α, IKK-β, IKK-ϵ, and Tank-binding kinase 1 to phosphorylate transcription factors, including activating transcription factor-2/c-Jun, NF-κB, and interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3), which direct transcription of antiviral genes. The main cytokine effectors of the innate antiviral response are type I interferons IFN-α and IFN-β, which are secreted from cells and act in an autocrine or paracrine manner via binding to a common IFN-α/β receptor (11Chawla-Sarkar M. Lindner D.J. Liu Y.F. Williams B.R. Sen G.C. Silverman R.H. Borden E.C. Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Receptor engagement activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, which initiates a second transcriptional response to induce IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which directly mediate antiviral effects. One such ISG is IRF-7, which enhances IFN production (12Lu R. Au W.C. Yeow W.S. Hageman N. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31805-31812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Other ISGs, such as 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthase, RNase L, and protein kinase R (PKR), inhibit cellular protein synthesis to prevent viral replication (11Chawla-Sarkar M. Lindner D.J. Liu Y.F. Williams B.R. Sen G.C. Silverman R.H. Borden E.C. Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Innate antiviral responses interface both directly and indirectly with the cellular apoptosis machinery. Type I IFNs mediate proapoptotic responses, as several ISGs have ascribed functions in both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis (11Chawla-Sarkar M. Lindner D.J. Liu Y.F. Williams B.R. Sen G.C. Silverman R.H. Borden E.C. Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Proapoptotic ISGs include tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (13Kayagaki N. Yamaguchi N. Nakayama M. Eto H. Okumura K. Yagita H. J. of Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1451-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) and Fas (14Selleri C. Sato T. Del Vecchio L. Luciano L. Barrett A.J. Rotoli B. Young N.S. Maciejewski J.P. Blood. 1997; 89: 957-964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, these effects may be cell type- or context-dependent (11Chawla-Sarkar M. Lindner D.J. Liu Y.F. Williams B.R. Sen G.C. Silverman R.H. Borden E.C. Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Innate immune signaling also may induce apoptotic cell death in an IFN-independent manner. IPS-1 localizes to the outer membrane of mitochondria, suggesting that it coordinates the antiviral response with pro- or antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members (8Seth R.B. Sun L. Ea C.K. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2005; 122: 669-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2518) Google Scholar). IPS-1 also associates with Fas-associated via death domain (FADD) to mediate NF-κB activation (7Kawai T. Takahashi K. Sato S. Coban C. Kumar H. Kato H. Ishii K.J. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 981-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (2032) Google Scholar), suggesting that Fas-associated via death domain (FADD) may link activation of RIG-I and Mda-5 to extrinsic apoptotic pathways. Finally, activation of IRF-3 may directly induce apoptosis via a mechanism independent of its induction of IFN (15Heylbroeck C. Balachandran S. Servant M.J. DeLuca C. Barber G.N. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3781-3792Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Therefore, pathogen detection mechanisms are hardwired into the cellular apoptotic response. Mammalian reoviruses are nonenveloped viruses with a genome of 10 segments of double-stranded (ds) RNA (16Nibert M.L. Schiff L.A. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 4th Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 1679-1728Google Scholar). Following infection of newborn mice, reovirus disseminates to the central nervous system, heart, and liver (17Tyler K.L. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 4th Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 1729-1745Google Scholar). Apoptosis induced by reovirus is the primary mechanism for virus-induced encephalitis (18Oberhaus S.M. Smith R.L. Clayton G.H. Dermody T.S. Tyler K.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2100-2106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and myocarditis (19DeBiasi R. Edelstein C. Sherry B. Tyler K. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 351-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). NF-κB plays an important regulatory role in apoptosis evoked by reovirus in cultured cells (20Connolly J.L. Rodgers S.E. Clarke P. Ballard D.W. Kerr L.D. Tyler K.L. Dermody T.S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2981-2989Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and in vivo (21O'Donnell S.M. Hansberger M.W. Connolly J.L. Chappell J.D. Watson M.J. Pierce J.M. Wetzel J.D. Han W. Barton E.S.

Reovirus induces IFN-β in cultured cells and in infected animals. In the heart, IFN-β is protective (21O'Donnell S.M. Hansberger M.W. Connolly J.L. Chappell J.D. Watson M.J. Pierce J.M. Wetzel J.D.

IFN-β levels induced by reovirus differ in cardiac myocytes and cardiac fibroblasts (23Stewart M.J. Smoak K. Blum M.A. Sherry B. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 2979-2987Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), suggesting that mechanisms of reovirus-induced IFN-β production are also cell type-specific. IRF-3 is required for IFN-β induction following reovirus infection of cardiac myocytes (24Noah D.L. Blum M.A. Sherry B. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 10208-10213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, mechanisms of reovirus-induced IRF-3 activation are unknown. To better understand mechanisms of reovirus-induced IFN production and the interface between these pathways and apoptosis, we conducted experiments to identify the viral and cellular determinants of IFN production following reovirus infection and the functional role of these pathways in reovirus replication and apoptosis induction. The results demonstrate that reovirus activates IRF-3 via a mechanism dependent on virion disassembly in endosomes, viral genomic dsRNA, RIG-I, and IPS-1. In contrast, RIG-I and IPS-1 are dispensable for reovirus-induced activation of NF-κB. IRF-3 limits reovirus spread in culture, in part because of production of type 1 IFNs. Importantly, IRF-3 and IPS-1 are required for efficient induction of apoptosis following reovirus infection. These results indicate that RIG-I and IPS-1 are involved in cell death signaling responses to viral infection and provide a functional link between innate immune activation and apoptosis.

The cells were fixed with methanol at -20 °C for at least 30 min and incubated with 5% bovine serum albumin (in PBS) for 15 min, followed by incubation with rabbit anti-IRF-3 antiserum (1:50) in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 1 h. The cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000; Molecular Probes) in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 1 h. The coverslips were removed from wells and placed on slides using Prolong Anti-Fade mounting medium (Molecular Probes). The cells were visualized by indirect immunofluorescence at a magnification of 63× using an Axiovert 200 fluorescence microscope with an oil lens (Carl Zeiss, New York, NY). Luciferase Assays—293T cells grown in 24-well plates were transfected with 0.18 μg/well of a reporter plasmid, which expresses firefly luciferase under either IRF-3/7 or NF-κB control (p-55C1BLuc or pNF-κB-Luc, respectively), and 0.02 μg/well of pRenilla-Luc, which expresses Renilla luciferase constitutively, using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h following transfection, the cells were adsorbed with reovirus in serum-free medium at 4 °C for 1 h, followed by incubation at 37 °C in serum-containing medium for 24 h. For experiments using RIG-I plasmid constructs, the cells were transfected with 0.1 μg/well of plasmid expressing RIG-I mutants (vector, full-length RIG-I, RIG-IC (3Yoneyama M. Kikuchi M. Natsukawa T. Shinobu N. Imaizumi T. Miyagishi M. Taira K. Akira S. Fujita T. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 730-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (3136) Google Scholar), or RIG-IKA (3Yoneyama M. Kikuchi M. Natsukawa T. Shinobu N. Imaizumi T. Miyagishi M. Taira K. Akira S. Fujita T. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 730-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (3136) Google Scholar)), 0.09 μg/well of luciferase reporter, and 0.01 μg/well of pRenilla-luc. Alternatively, the cells were transfected with 5 μg/well of poly(I·C) (Amersham Biosciences) or reovirus genomic dsRNA (35Nibert M.L. Dermody T.S. Fields B.N. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2976-2989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by calcium phosphate precipitation. Luciferase activity in the cultures was quantified using a dual luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR—HeLa cells (105) grown in 24-well plates were either adsorbed with T3D at an MOI of 100 PFU/cell or mock infected in serum-free medium at 4 °C for 1 h, followed by incubation in serum-containing medium at 37 °C for various intervals. The cells were removed from plates with trypsin, washed once in PBS, and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was removed, and the cell pellet was frozen at -70 °C. RNA was extracted using an RNEasy Mini RNA extraction kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR was performed using the One-Step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) and the following conditions: 0.5 μg of RNA template; 0.6 μm each primer; cycle for 30 min at 50 °C; 15 min at 95°; and 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, 1 min at 72 °C, followed by 10 min at 72 °C. RT-PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis in 2% Tris-borate-EDTA-agarose gels. Primer sequences are provided in the supplemental methods section. Treatment with E64 or Ribavirin—After 24 h of incubation following transfection of 293T cells with luciferase reporter plasmids, the cells were either untreated or pretreated with 200 μm E64 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 4 h and adsorbed with either T3D virions or rsT3D-σ1T249I ISVPs at various MOIs in serum-free medium at 4 °C for 1 h. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in the presence or absence of either 200 μm E64 or 200 μm ribavirin, and luciferase activity in cell culture lysates was quantified. siRNA Transfections—For luciferase assays, 293T cells (106) were seeded into 60-mm tissue culture dishes (Costar) in medium without antibiotics and transfected with 266 pmol of siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h of incubation, the cells (7 × 104) were aliquoted into wells of 24-well plates in medium without antibiotics, incubated for 24 h, and transfected with 1 pmol/well of siRNA, 0.09 μg/well of firefly luciferase reporter plasmid, and 0.01 μg/well of pRenilla-Luc using Lipofectamine 2000. After 24 h of incubation, the cells were adsorbed with T3D in serum-free medium at an MOI of 100 PFU/cell at 4 °C for 1 h, followed by 24 h of incubation in serum-containing medium, at which time luciferase activity in cell culture lysates was determined. For caspase-3/7 assays, 24 h after the first siRNA transfection, cells (104) were transfected a second time by seeding into black clear-bottom 96-well plates (Costar) in antibiotic-free medium containing 5 pmol/well of siRNA and Lipofectamine 2000. After 24 h of incubation, the cells were adsorbed with T3D in serum-free medium at various MOIs at 4 °C for 1 h, followed by 24 h of incubation in serum-containing medium, at which time caspase-3/7 activity was determined. Virus Growth—Cells (5 × 104) grown in 24-well plates were adsorbed in triplicate with T3D at various MOIs at 4 °C for 1 h in serum-free medium, washed once with PBS, and incubated in serum-containing medium for various intervals. To the indicated cultures, 200 and 800 IU of recombinant IFN-β was added at 12 and 24 h post-infection, respectively. The cells were frozen and thawed three times, followed by determination of viral titer/well by plaque assay using L929 cells (29Virgin IV, H.W. Bassel-Duby R. Fields B.N. Tyler K.L. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 4594-4604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Viral yields were calculated according to the following formula: log10yieldtx=log10(PFU/ml)tx-log10(PFU/ml)t0, where tx is the time post-infection. Quantitation of Apoptosis by Acridine Orange Staining—Cells (5 × 104) grown in the 24-well plates were infected with reovirus at various MOIs. The percentage of apoptotic cells after 48 h of incubation was determined using acridine orange staining as described (36Tyler K.L. Squier M.K. Rodgers S.E. Schneider S.E. Oberhaus S.M. Grdina T.A. Cohen J.J. Dermody T.S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6972-6979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For each experiment, >200 cells were counted, and the percentage of cells exhibiting condensed chromatin was determined by epi-illumination fluorescence microscopy using a fluorescein filter set (Zeiss Photomicroscope III; Zeiss, New York). Detection of Caspase-3/7 Activity—The cells (104) were seeded into black clear-bottom 96-well plates and adsorbed with T3D in serum-free medium at various MOIs at 4 °C for 1 h, followed by 24 h of incubation in serum-containing medium. Caspase-3/7 activity was quantified using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To determine whether IRF-3 is activated following reovirus infection, we assayed for the presence of IRF-3 in nuclear extracts by immunoblotting (Fig. 1A) and for IRF-3 dimers by native PAGE (Fig. 1B) during a time course of reovirus T3D infection. Reovirus T3D activates NF-κB (20Connolly J.L. Rodgers S.E. Clarke P. Ballard D.W. Kerr L.D. Tyler K.L. Dermody T.S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2981-2989Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), stimulates IFN-β production (22Sherry B. Torres J. Blum M.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1314-1323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and induces apoptosis in cell culture (36Tyler K.L. Squier M.K. Rodgers S.E. Schneider S.E. Oberhaus S.M. Grdina T.A. Cohen J.J. Dermody T.S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6972-6979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in the murine central nervous system (18Oberhaus S.M. Smith R.L. Clayton G.H. Dermody T.S. Tyler K.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2100-2106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to mock infected cells, T3D induced nuclear IRF-3 at 2 h post-infection, reached maximal levels at ∼4–8 h, and decreased by 12 h. Concordantly, nuclear IRF-3 staining was observed in T3D-infected cultures but not in mock infected cultures at 8 h post-infection (Fig. 1C). The kinetics of reovirus-induced activation of IRF-3 parallel kinetics of NF-κB activation by reovirus (20Connolly J.L. Rodgers S.E. Clarke P. Ballard D.W. Kerr L.D. Tyler K.L. Dermody T.S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2981-2989Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 33Hansberger M.W. Campbell J.A. Danthi P. Arrate P. Pennington K.N. Marcu K.B. Ballard D.W. Dermody T.S. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 1360-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). IRF-3 is expressed constitutively in most cell types and is activated initially following viral infection, whereas IRF-7 is transcriptionally up-regulated in response to IFN (12Lu R. Au W.C. Yeow W.S. Hageman N. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31805-31812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To determine whether IRF-7 is activated by reovirus, we examined IRF-7 levels in nuclear extracts by immunoblotting over the same time course of reovirus T3D infection. IRF-7 was detected in nuclear extracts at 8–12 h post-infection, at the time when IRF-3 activation began to decline (Fig. 1A). This finding suggests that IRF-7 activity is induced following the initial activation of IRF-3 in reovirus-infected cells. To determine whether reovirus infection stimulates functional IRF-3/7 activity, we used the p-55C1BLuc reporter plasmid (31Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Sato M. Ozato K. Fujita T. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), which expresses firefly luciferase under the control of tandem IRF-binding sites. Co-transfection of a plasmid constitutively expressing Renilla luciferase was used to normalize for transfection efficiency. T3D induced 5-fold higher levels of normalized luciferase activity in comparison with mock infection at 12 h post-infection and 8-fold higher levels at 24 h post-infection, indicating that T3D infection induces functional IRF-3/7 activity (Fig. 1D). In addition to IFN-β, several genes are directly transcribed in response to IRF-3, including IFIT1 (ISG56) and IFIT2 (ISG54) (37Grandvaux N. Servant M.J. tenOever B. Sen G.C. Balachandran S. Barber G.N. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 5532-5539Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). To determine whether those genes are up-regulated in reovirus-infected cells with kinetics that follow IRF-3 activation, we isolated RNA from HeLa cells over a time course of T3D infection and assayed for IFIT1, IFIT2, and IFNB1 transcripts by RT-PCR (Fig. 2). IFIT1 and IFIT2 mRNAs were up-regulated in response to reovirus infection beginning ∼4h post-infection, with kinetics approximating those observed for IRF-3 activation. IFNB1 was detected at 6–8 h post-infection, corresponding to the time of up-regulation of IRF-7. Collectively, the"

These ancient animals inherited components of the first multicellular skeletogenic toolkit from the last common ancestor of the Metazoa. Using a paleogenomics approach, including gene- and protein-expression techniques and phylogenetic reconstruction, we show that a molecular component of this toolkit was the precursor to the α-carbonic anhydrases (α-CAs), a gene family used by extant animals in a variety of fundamental physiological processes. We used the coralline demosponge Astrosclera willeyana , a “living fossil” that has survived from the Mesozoic, to provide insight into the evolution of the ability to biocalcify, and show that the α-CA family expanded from a single ancestral gene through several independent gene-duplication events in sponges and eumetazoans."
https://openalex.org/W2056899616,"Hyaluronan must be exported from its site of synthesis, the inner side of plasma membrane, to the extracellular matrix. Here, we identified the multidrug-associated protein MRP5 as the principle hyaluronan exporter from fibroblasts. The expression of the MRP5 (ABC-C5) transporter was silenced in fibroblasts using RNA interference, and a dose-dependent inhibition of hyaluronan export was observed. Hyaluronan oligosaccharides introduced into the cytosol competed with the export of endogenously labeled hyaluronan and the MRP5 substrate fluorescein. Because cGMP is a physiological substrate of MRP5, the intracellular concentrations of cGMP were modulated by the drugs 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthin, propentofyllin, l-NAME, zaprinast, and bromo-cGMP, and the effects on hyaluronan export were analyzed. Increasing the cGMP levels inhibited hyaluronan export and decreasing it afforded higher concentrations of zaprinast to inhibit the export. Thus, cGMP may be a physiological regulator of hyaluronan export at the level of the export MRP5.

Thus, cGMP may be a physiological regulator of hyaluronan export at the level of the export MRP5. Hyaluronan is a large glycosaminoglycan abundantly present in the extracellular matrix. Hyaluronan biosynthesis proceeds by alternate transfer of UDP-GlcA and UDP-GlcNac at the reducing end at the inner face of the plasma membrane, from where the growing hyaluronan chain is exported into the extracellular matrix (1Prehm P. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 2Prehm P. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 3Prehm P. Biochem.

Recently we discovered that hyaluronan is exported through the protoblast membrane of Streptococci by an ABC transporter (5Ouskova G. Spellerberg B. Prehm P. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 931-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The streptococcal hyaluronan transporter had structural and functional homology to human multidrug resistance transporters; accordingly, inhibitors of these transporters prevented hyaluronan export from human fibroblasts. Thus, two distinct processes are required for hyaluronan deposition in the extracellular matrix, namely hyaluronan synthesis catalyzed by the hyaluronan synthase within the cytosol and hyaluronan export mediated by a member of the ABC transporter family, this most likely being the MRP5 transporter (6Prehm P. Schumacher U. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 1401-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The in vitro achieved inhibition of hyaluronan export also worked in vivo in an animal model of osteoarthritis, where inhibition of hyaluronan export prevented proteoglycan loss and collagen degradation in osteoarthritic cartilage (7Prehm P. J. Rheumatol. 2005; 32: 690-696PubMed Google Scholar). Like most ABC transporters, MRP5 can export a variety of substrates (8Jedlitschky G. Burchell B. Keppler D. J. Biol.

Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 3435-3445Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the extracellular matrix, hyaluronan acts primarily as a viscous space-filling agent or lubricant in the synovial fluid of joints or the vitreous body of the eye. The largest amounts occur in the skin, particularly around capillaries (12Tammi R. Paukkonen K. Wang C. Horsmanheimo M. Tammi M. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1994; 286: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Its rapid turnover rates with a half-life <6 h (13Laurent U.B. Dahl L.B. Reed R.K. Exp. Physiol. 1991; 76: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) indicate that it is not merely an inert matrix component but may fulfill pivotal physiological functions, including random motility of cells, their invasion, and proliferation to name but a few (14Prehm P. Biopolymers. 2002; 15 (Steinbuöchel, A., ed) , Whiley-VCH-Verlag, Weinheim, Germany: 379-406Google Scholar). Under conditions of ischemia-induced inflammation, hyaluronan is overproduced and can lead to generalized edema formation (15Gerdin B. Hallgren R. J. Intern. Med. 1997; 242: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), but particularly so in the edema of the lung (16Teder P. Nettelbladt O. Heldin P. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 12: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), in the myocardial tissue after infarction (17Waldenstrom A. Martinussen H.J. Gerdin B. Haöllgren R. J. Clin.

Fellstrom B.C. Nephron Exp. Nephrol. 2006; 103 (–e94): e86Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, as the MRP5 has only been identified as the hyaluronan exporter by inhibition studies (6Prehm P. Schumacher U. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 1401-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), it is necessary to further ascertain the role of the MRP5 transporter in hyaluronan export as this may have important functional and pathophysiological consequences, particularly so with respect to the role of cGMP in regulating vasodilation and tissue hydration. Materials—MRP5 and control siRNA 2The abbreviations used are: siRNA, small interfering RNA; HEK, human embryonic kidney; l-NAME, NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester; NO, nitric oxide. were obtained from Ambion, Cambridgeshire, UK. Monoclonal rat anti-MRP5 antibodies were from Chemicon International. Medical grade hyaluronan (Hylumed Medical) was a gift from Genzyme, Cambridge, MA. Other chemicals were from Sigma. Cells and Cell Culture—MRP5-overexpressing human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were kindly provided by Prof. Piet Borst, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and grown in RPMI medium and 10% fetal calf serum. Mouse fibroblasts were grown in serum-free Quantum 333 (PAA Koölbe). All cultures were supplemented with streptomycin/penicillin (100 units of each/ml). General Methods—The determination of hyaluronan production has been described (7Prehm P. J. Rheumatol. 2005; 32: 690-696PubMed Google Scholar). Knock down of endogenous MRP5 by RNA interference was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol and purification of hyaluronan oligosaccharides and fluorescent labeling as described by Seyfried et al. (20Seyfried N.T. Blundell C.D. Day A.J. Almond A. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The sizes of the purified oligosaccharides were determined by mass spectrometry. Fractions containing tetra-, hexa-, and octasaccharides were collected and used for the following experiments. Inhibition of Endogenously Synthesized Hyaluronan Export by Hyaluronan Oligosaccharides—Human fibroblasts were seeded at 50% confluency and grown for 24 h. The medium was withdrawn and the cells were incubated in Dulbecco’s medium containing 1 m sucrose, 10% polyethylene glycol 600 in the absence or presence of hyaluronan, hyaluronan oligosaccharides, a mixture of N-acetylglucosamine, and glucuronic acid at concentrations of 100 μg/ml for 15 min at 37 °C. The cells were suspended in a mixture of Dulbecco’s medium/H2O 1:2 (v/v) for 5 min to lyse the pinocytotic vesicles. After centrifugation for 5 min at 1500 × g, the cells were suspended in 10 ml of Dulbecco’s medium containing 8 μCi/ml [3H]glucosamine and grown for 24 h. The medium was collected and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was mixed 1:3 (v/v) with 1.3% potassium acetate/ethanol (w/v), and the precipitated hyaluronan was sedimented for 15 min at 4000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, containing 10 mg of Pronase® and incubated at 37 °C overnight. The solution was loaded onto a DEAE-Sephacel column and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.4. Fractions of 2 ml were collected, and the amount of radioactive-labeled hyaluronan was determined. Inhibition of Hyaluronan Export by MRP5 Inhibitors—MRP5-overexpressing HEK293 cells were grown on microtiter plates to confluency and loaded with fluorescent hyaluronan oligosaccharides by osmotic lysis of pinocytotic vesicles. The cells were incubated in RPMI medium containing 1 m sucrose, 10% polyethylene glycol 600, and fluorescent hyaluronan oligosaccharides at concentrations of 0.2 mg/ml for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were then placed in a mixture of RPMI/H2O 1:2 (v/v) for 5 min to lyse the pinocytic vesicles. The loading and lysis procedure was repeated once. The cells were washed three times with medium and incubated in the absence or presence of 50 μm verapamil or 50 μm zaprinast. After different time periods, the fluorescence of the cell layer was determined at the bottom of the microtiter wells at 485 and 528 nm by a Synergy HT reader (Biotek Instruments) that had been calibrated with standard concentrations of fluorescent hyaluronan oligosaccharides and fluorescein. Inhibition of the MRP5 Substrate Fluorescein Export by Cytosolic Hyaluronan Oligosaccharides—Normal HEK293 or MRP5-overexpressing HEK293 cells were trypsinized and incubated in RPMI medium containing 0.5 m sucrose, 10% polyethylene glycol 600, and hyaluronan or hyaluronan oligosaccharides at concentrations of 100 μg/ml for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were then placed in a mixture of RPMI/H2O 1:2 (v/v) for 5 min to lyse the pinocytic vesicles. The loading and lysis procedure was repeated once. Afterward the cells (2 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated for 10 min on ice with an equal volume of fluorescein diacetate (4 μm in phosphate-buffered saline). Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 5.6 mm glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm KCl. The suspension was incubated at 37 °C; aliquots were taken at different time points, centrifuged, and the fluorescence of the supernatant was determined at 485 and 528 nm by a Synergy HT reader (Biotek Instruments). Statistical Analyses—Data are presented as S.D. of n experiments, with n referring to the number of experiments. The t test was used, and a p value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Identification of the Hyaluronan Exporter in Mouse Fibroblasts—To assess the role of MRP5 in hyaluronan export, mouse fibroblasts were transfected with mixtures of the siRNA numbers 1–3 based on the MRP5 sequence and non-targeting control siRNA sequences. Fig. 1A and Tables 1 and 2 show that the siRNA mixtures 1 and 3 specifically deleted MRP5 mRNA as compared with the β-actin control.TABLE 1The primer sequences of β-actin and MRP5 for RT-PCR and expected sizes of PCR productsGeneForward primer sequences (5′-3′)Reverse primer sequences (5′-3′)Product bpβ-ActinCGT GCG TGA CAT CAA AGA GATCC TGT CAG CAA TGC CTG GG341MRP5CAT AGC AAG AGC AAG AGC CCGTG GTA ATC AGG CCA ATG CT402 Open table in a new tab TABLE 2MRP5 sense and antisense sequences (5′-3′) for siRNANo.SenseAntisense1CCCAGGUUCCGGAGAACAAttUUGUUCUCCGGAACCUGGGtt2AAUUCUGGACGAGGAGCAUttAUGCUCCUCGUCCAGAAUUtg3UCGUGUGCCUGAUGAUCACttGUGAUCAUCAGGCACACGAtg Open table in a new tab Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates with monoclonal antibodies against MRP5 showed knock down of the 190-kDa protein with targeting siRNA to different extents (Fig. 1B). When the siRNAs were used separately, only siRNA number 3 was effective, and this effect was enhanced by combination with siRNA numbers 1 or 2. The combination of siRNA numbers 1 and 2 had no effect. Therefore, the effect of MRP5 knock down was measured with the mixtures of siRNA numbers 2 and 3 and 1 and 3. Fig. 1, C and D, shows the reduction of hyaluronan export at 48 and 72 h after transfection by a mixture of the MRP5-specific siRNA numbers 1 and 3 in one experiment and siRNA numbers 2 and 3 in the other. The reduced efficiency of the siRNAs at higher concentrations may arise from a disproportion of siRNA and transfection reagent (21Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8018) Google Scholar). In conclusion, hyaluronan export was most effectively reduced by siRNA numbers 1 and 3 at 48 h after transfection. These results indicated that MRP5 is involved in hyaluronan export from mouse fibroblasts. Hyaluronan Oligosaccharides in the Cytosol Compete with Endogenous Hyaluronan Export—This experiment was performed to show that hyaluronan synthesis and export are two different and independent processes. Hyaluronan oligosaccharides were prepared by digestion of hyaluronan with hyaluronidase, and tetra- to octasaccharides were isolated. Hyaluronan of high molecular weight, hyaluronan oligosaccharides, or a mixture of the monosaccharide building blocks of hyaluronan glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine were introduced at concentrations of 100 μg/ml into the cytosol of hyaluronan-synthesizing mouse fibroblasts by osmotic lysis of pinocytotic vesicles (22Prehm P. Biochem. J. 1985; 225: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The osmotic lysis of pinocytotic vesicles results in a fluid uptake of 0.1% of the cellular volume, and thus the intracellular concentrations of the hyaluronan oligosaccharides can be estimated to be ∼100 ng/ml (23Okada C.Y.

After 24 h, the amount of radioactive hyaluronan that was released into the culture supernatant was determined. Fig. 2 shows that hyaluronan oligosaccharides interfered with the export of endogenous hyaluronan, whereas high molecular weight hyaluronan and a mixture of glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine had no effect. MRP5 Inhibitors Reduce Hyaluronan Oligosaccharide Export—In a previous report we have shown that a variety of inhibitors interfered with hyaluronan export from fibroblasts (6Prehm P. Schumacher U. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 1401-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Fluorescent hyaluronan oligosaccharides were introduced into the cytosol of normal and MRP5-overexpressing HEK293 cells that do not synthesize hyaluronan. Fig. 3 shows that the oligosaccharides were exported from the MRP5-overexpressing cells. The export velocity was reduced by the MRP5 inhibitors verapamil and zaprinast. Cytosolic Hyaluronan Oligosaccharides Interfere with the Export of the MRP5 Substrate Fluorescein Diacetate—Hyaluronan oligosaccharides were introduced into the cytosol of MRP5-overexpressing HEK293 cells by osmotic lysis of pinocytotic vesicles. The cells were then incubated with the non-fluorescent fluorescein diacetate, which can freely diffuse into the cell where it is cleaved by an esterase to the fluorescent MPR5 substrate fluorescein. The rates of fluorescein export were determined for fibroblasts mock-loaded or loaded with hyaluronan oligosaccharides. Fig. 4 shows that hyaluronan oligosaccharides inhibited the export of the fluorescent MRP5 substrate. Inhibition of Hyaluronan Export by cGMP Analogs—Because cGMP also appears to be physiological substrate of MRP5, we measured the effects of altered intracellular cGMP concentrations on hyaluronan export (Fig. 5). Propentofylline is a general phosphodiesterase and nucleoside transport inhibitor (24Parkinson F.E. Rudolphi K.A. Fredholm B.B. Gen. Pharmacol. 1994; 25: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). 3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthin is a PDE5 and PDE4 inhibitor and raises the intracellular cGMP and cAMP levels, but it does not inhibit MRP5 (25Wielinga P.R. van der Heiden I. Reid G. Beijnen J.H. Wijnholds J. Borst P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17664-17671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Propentofylline and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthin inhibited hyaluronan export in a concentration-dependent manner. Bromo-cGMP is a membrane-permeable cGMP analog that competes with the transport of cGMP through MRP5 (8Jedlitschky G. Burchell B. Keppler D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30069-30074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). It also inhibited hyaluronan export. The influence of NO that is produced by nitric oxide synthase and activates the guanylate cyclase (26Nakane M. Clin. Chem. Lab. Med. 2003; 41: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was also analyzed. When the NO synthase was inhibited by l-NAME, hyaluronan export was slightly enhanced (Fig. 5B). Such an enhancement by l-NAME was also observed in the presence of zaprinast, which inhibits MRP5 transport at micromolar concentrations (27Sundkvist E. Jaeger R. Sager G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 945-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). When NO was exogenously supplied by increasing concentrations of sodium nitroprusside in the presence of l-NAME, hyaluronan export was again inhibited (Fig. 5C). In conclusion, Fig. 5 shows that all inhibitors that raised the intracellular cGMP levels decreased hyaluronan export in a concentration-dependent manner. In a previous study, we demonstrated that inhibitors of the ABC transporter family reduced hyaluronan export by human fibroblasts. However, as these inhibitors act on several members of the ABC transporter family, our evidence for MRP5 as a hyaluronan exporter was only indirect (6Prehm P. Schumacher U. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 1401-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Hence the aim of this study was to identify the principle hyaluronan exporter definitively. Thus, RNA interference was used to post-transcriptionally suppress MRP5 RNA in a sequence-specific manner (28Hannon G.J. Nature. 2002; 418: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (3465) Google Scholar). Mouse fibroblasts transfected with MPR5-specific siRNA showed a dose-dependent decrease in hyaluronan export as compared with the control. These results considerably strengthen our initial finding that MRP5 is the principle hyaluronan exporter from mouse fibroblasts (6Prehm P. Schumacher U. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 1401-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This conclusion is supported by our results on the export inhibition of endogenously synthesized hyaluronan and of the MRP5 substrate fluorescein by cytosolic hyaluronan oligosaccharides. The oligosaccharides had to be introduced into the cytosol by osmotic lysis of pinocytotic vesicles. This procedure has been shown to maintain excellent cell viability (29Rechsteiner M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 149: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 30Lee G. Delohery T.M. Ronai Z. Brandt-Rauf P.W. Pincus M.R. Murphy R.B. Weinstein I.B. Cytometry. 1993; 14: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), plating efficiency, and minimal damage to the cells (31Ghosh C. Iversen P.L. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 2000; 10: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Nonspecific effects of the method were confined to transient decrease of protein and DNA synthesis (32Chakrabarti R. Pfeiffer N.E. Wylie D.E. Schuster S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8214-8221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further nonspecific effects were controlled by introducing high molecular weight hyaluronan or a mixture of glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that particularly the intracellular hyaluronan oligosaccharides exert unknown signaling effects on hyaluronan secretion. But a likely explanation for the difference of hyaluronan oligosaccharides and high molecular weight hyaluronan on export inhibition of endogenously synthesized hyaluronan is a competition of non-reducing hyaluronan terminus for entry into the MRP5 channel. It has been postulated that MRP5 controls the intracellular concentration of cGMP as an overflow pump to protect the biochemical signal cascade from overshooting cGMP concentrations that could arise from high production or low degradation (11Andric S.A. Kostic T.S. Stojilkovic S.S. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 3435-3445Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 25Wielinga P.R. van der Heiden I. Reid G. Beijnen J.H. Wijnholds J. Borst P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17664-17671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). MRP5 has a particular high affinity for cGMP (Km = 2 μm) as compared with cAMP (Km = 400 μm) (8Jedlitschky G. Burchell B. Keppler D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30069-30074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). cGMP is synthesized in an NO-dependent manner and degraded by phosphodiesterases, particularly PDE5. Consequently, inhibition of the NO synthase decreases the intracellular cGMP level and results in higher concentrations of the MRP5 export inhibitor zaprinast to inhibit hyaluronan export (Fig. 5B). Export of polysaccharides through an ABC transporter had previously only been documented for bacterial polysaccharides (33Bliss J.M. Silver R.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and thus MRP5 appears to be the first identified member of a eukaryotic polysaccharide plasma membrane transporter. Because of the promiscuous nature of the members of the ABC transporter family (34Schinkel A.H. Jonker J.W. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2003; 55: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar), it would not be surprising to find other members of multidrug-resistant transporters as hyaluronan exporters in other tissues apart from fibroblasts, because these transporters are often expressed in a tissue-specific pattern. We thank Dr. P. Borst for providing MRP5 overexpressing cells and A. Blanke, R. Gehrke, U. Rasmussen, K. Siebert, and R. Schulz for excellent technical assistance."

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3964) Google Scholar). TGF-β signaling in normal epithelial cells begins with ligand binding to TβRII, which enables TβRII to recruit and phosphorylate TβRI. TβRI is then activated to recruit and phosphorylate the downstream transcription factors, Smads 2 and 3. Phosphorylated Smads 2 and 3 then form a complex with the co-Smad, Smad4, and the complex translocates to the nucleus to activate or repress genes in a context specific manner (2Blobe G.C.

However, recent studies have identified an essential role for TβRIII during development, as demonstrated by the embryonic lethal phenotype of TβRIII knock-out mice and the essential, non-redundant role of TβRIII during chick heart development (6Sankar S.

Endoglin shares significant sequence homology with TβRIII in the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, but participates in two distinct TGF-β signaling pathways in endothelial cells (8Cheifetz S.

The other pathway promotes endothelial cell growth through an endothelial cell-specific type I receptor, ALK-1, and TβRII to activate Smad1/5/8 (10Ten Dijke P. Goumans M.J. Itoh F. Itoh S. J. Cell.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1743-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). The balance of signaling between these opposing pathways regulates endothelial cell biology, including the activation and maturation phases of angiogenesis (12Letamendia A. Lastres P. Botella L.M.

Previous studies have suggested that endoglin inhibits the ALK-5/Smad 2/3 pathway while promoting ALK-1/Smad 1/5/8 signaling (11Goumans M.J. Valdimarsdottir G. Itoh S. Rosendahl A.

However, the mechanism by which endoglin mediates these effects is unclear.Like TβRIII, endoglin demonstrates an essential role in mouse embryonic development, with a lethal phenotype in endoglin-null (endoglin-/-) mouse embryos due to defects in vascular development (14Li D.Y.

In addition, mutations in endoglin or ALK-1 in humans result in the autosomal dominant disease, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, characterized by dilated vessels and arteriovenous malformations that lead to recurrent hemorrhage and shunting in the lung, brain, and the gastrointestinal tract (15Bourdeau A.

How endoglin contributes to hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and tumor-induced angiogenesis remains to be defined.To define mechanisms by which the TGF-β superfamily co-receptors, TβRIII and endoglin, exert their influence on signaling in a cell type-specific manner, we have been investigating how these receptors function and signal. We have demonstrated that the cytoplasmic domain of TβRIII is essential for enhancing TGF-β signaling (21Blobe G.C. Schiemann W.P. Pepin M.C. Beauchemin M. Moustakas A. Lodish H.F.

As the cytoplasmic domains of endoglin and TβRIII are highly conserved, including precise conservation of the binding site for β-arrestin2, here we investigated the interaction of endoglin with β-arrestin2 and the impact on downstream TGF-β signaling and endothelial cell biology.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Cultures and Antibodies—HEK 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC) were grown in MCDB-131 medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma), 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Sigma), and 2 mm l-glutamine. Endoglin-null (endoglin-/-) and control mouse embryonic endothelial cell lines (MEEC) (endoglin+/+) were grown in MCDB-131 supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 2mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), 100 μg of heparin (Sigma), and 50 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement (Sigma). HA and FLAG epitope antibodies were purchased from Roche Applied Science and Sigma, respectively. Endoglin antibody P3D1 was obtained from Chemicon. Phospho- and total ERK-specific antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling. β-Arrestin2 polyclonal antibody was raised from rabbit immunized with β-arrestin2-specific peptide sequence (KPHDHIPLPRPQSAAP).Transfection and Protein Expression—Lipofectamine 2000 was used to transiently transfect HEK 293 cells as described according to manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen). MEECs were nucleofected with Amaxa nucleofection system. Briefly, ∼1 × 106 cells were electroporated with 4-6 μg of DNA using solution R and allowed expression for 40-48 h before harvest. Adenoviral infection of HMECs was performed at 100 multiplicity of infection. All cDNAS were PCR amplified with HA or FLAG epitope tag incorporated into the primers. Adenovirus of endoglin and GFP were generated according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Stratagene). The siRNA sequence targeting mouse β-arrestin2 5′-AAGGACCGGAAAGUGUUCGUG-3 is reported elsewhere (43Girnita L. Larsson O. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11329-11338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, knock-down of β-arrestin2 expression was achieved by nucleofection of 15 μg of RNA in 106 cells and incubated for 72 h.Immunofluorescence—HEK 293 or endoglin-/- MEECs expressing HA-tagged endoglin, endoglin-T650A, or endoglin-S were serum starved, washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS, and then blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100 for 1 h. HA antibody was used to probe for transient endoglin expression in HEK 293 and MEECs for 1 h at 25 °C. Cells were washed with PBS, and incubated with Cy3-conjugated rabbit secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature, washed, then mounted with Vectashield. In phospho-ERK staining, MEECs were prepared as previously mentioned, then probed with phospho-ERK antibody (Cell Signaling). Cy3-conjugated rabbit secondary was again used before mounting on slides. Immunofluorescence images were obtained using Zeiss laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM-510).Co-immunoprecipitation—HEK 293 or endoglin-/- MEECs expressing FLAG epitope-tagged β-arrestin2 and/or HA epitope-tagged endoglin (expressed at ∼3-5-fold of endogenous levels) were washed with PBS, then lysed on ice with lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 10% (w/v) glycerol) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Sigma protease inhibitor mixture) and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma phosphatase inhibitor mixture). The lysates were precleared by centrifugation, and incubated with FLAG antibody and protein G-agarose beads for 4 h at 4 °C.The immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation, pellets were washed with lysis buffer, and stored in 2× sample buffer prior to Western blot analyses.Wound Healing Migration Assay—Cell monolayers of endoglin+/+ and endoglin-/- MEECs in 12-well plates were wounded and then monitored for up to 14 h. Wound-induced cell migration was measured by monitoring the distance between cells lining the wound edge and then normalized to time 0 h.RESULTSEndoglin Associates with β-Arrestin2 in Epithelial and Endothelial Cells—We previously reported a novel association between TβRIII and the scaffolding protein β-arrestin2 in HEK 293 cells (23Chen W. Kirkbride K.C. How T. Nelson C.D. Mo J. Frederick J.P. Wang X.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Blobe G.C. Science. 2003; 301: 1394-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The interaction between TβRIII and β-arrestin2 was stimulated by TβRII-mediated phosphorylation of the cytopasmic domain of TβRIII, and resulted in their co-localization in internalized endocytic vesicles and subsequent down-regulation of TGF-β-mediated inhibition of cellular proliferation (23Chen W. Kirkbride K.C. How T. Nelson C.D. Mo J. Frederick J.P. Wang X.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Blobe G.C. Science. 2003; 301: 1394-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). As endoglin and TβRIII have precise conservation of the β-arrestin2 binding site (Fig. 1A), we examined whether endoglin also interacts with β-arrestin2. Initially, HA-tagged endoglin and FLAG-tagged β-arrestin2 were transiently co-expressed in HEK 293 cells followed by co-immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged β-arrestin2 with FLAG antibody resulted in the co-precipitation of HA-tagged endoglin (Fig. 1B, lane 2).As endoglin forms complexes with several TGF-β receptors, including TβRII, ALK-1, and ALK-5, we examined the effect of expression of these signaling receptor partners for endoglin on the endoglin/β-arrestin2 interaction by co-expression in HEK 293 cells. The endoglin/β-arrestin2 interaction was consistently increased in the presence of TβRII (Fig. 1B, lane 3) and more so by ALK-1 (Fig. 1B, lane 4), but only by a modest extent in the presence of ALK-5 (Fig. 1B, lane 5).The interaction of TβRIII with β-arrestin2 depends upon threonine 841 in the cytoplasmic domain of TβRIII (23Chen W. Kirkbride K.C. How T. Nelson C.D. Mo J. Frederick J.P. Wang X.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Blobe G.C. Science. 2003; 301: 1394-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Based upon the sequence homology of the cytoplasmic domains of TβRIII and endoglin (Fig. 1A), we reasoned that the interaction of endoglin and β-arrestin2 might depend upon the corresponding threonine 650 in the cytoplasmic domain of endoglin. As predicted, site-directed mutagenesis of threonine residue 650 into alanine (endoglin-T650A) abrogated the endoglin/β-arrestin2 interaction, as determined by co-immunoprecipitation studies (Fig. 1B, lane 6 versus lane 2).The enhanced co-immunoprecipitation of endoglin and β-arrestin2 in the presence of ALK-1 suggested that the endoglin/β-arrestin2 interaction is mediated, at least in part, by phosphorylation of endoglin by ALK-1. Indeed we and others (24Guerrero-Esteo M. Sanchez-Elsner T. Letamendia A. Bernabeu C. J. Biol.

To further investigate the role of ALK-1, wild-type ALK-1, and ALK-1 (Q200D), a point mutant that renders the kinase constitutively active, were used in a co-immunoprecipitation study. In the absence of TGF-β stimulation or serum, the endoglin/β-arrestin2 interaction was significantly reduced when compared with cells in the presence of serum (Fig. 1, C, lane 2 versus B, lane 2). As before, wild-type ALK-1 increased the endoglin/β-arrestin2 interaction (Fig. 1C, lane 3 versus lane 2), and constitutively active ALK-1 (Q200D) further increased the endoglin/β-arrestin2 interaction (Fig. 1C, lane 4 versus lane 5), whereas there were no detectable levels of endoglin-T650A interacting with β-arrestin2, even with ALK-1 present (Fig. 1C, lanes 5 and 6). Taken together, these results suggest that threonine 650 provides a structural queue for the interaction of endoglin with β-arrestin2, and ALK-1, presumably through phosphorylation of endoglin on or near this region, is able to increase this interaction.As endoglin is primarily expressed in endothelial cells, we also examined whether endoglin interacts with β-arrestin2 in endothelial cells. For these studies we used an endoglin-null (endoglin-/-) MEEC to allow selective expression of either the wild-type or mutant endoglin (endoglin-T650A) and comparison of their specificity toward β-arrestin2 in an endothelial cell environment. Again, in MEECs, wild-type endoglin transiently co-expressed with β-arrestin2 co-immunoprecipitated (Fig. 1D, lane 3), whereas endoglin-T650A did not (Fig. 1D, lane 2). As with other β-arrestin2 interacting receptors, we were not able to demonstrate interaction of endogenous endoglin with endogenous β-arrestin2. However, we were able to demonstrate the interaction of endogenous β-arrestin2 with overexpressed endoglin using β-arrestin2 antibody (Fig. 1E, lane 2), with pre-immune β-arrestin2 serum and endoglin antibody serving as negative and positive controls, respectively (Fig. 1E, lanes 1 and 3). Taken together these studies establish that endoglin associates with β-arrestin2 in both HEK 293 cells and MEECs, and this association is promoted primarily by ALK-1 and TβRII, the two receptors that are known to phosphorylate endoglin.Endoglin and β-Arrestin2 Co-internalize in Endocytic Vesicles—As β-arrestin2 functions, in part, to mediate the internalization of interacting receptors via clathrin-coated pits (26Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 455-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the endoglin/β-arrestin2 association resulted in their co-internalization using the β-arrestin2-GFP interaction assay (28Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). These studies were performed both in HEK 293 cells, to explore the contribution of other endoglin interacting receptors, and in endoglin-/- MEECs. As in other cell systems, diffuse cytoplasmic distribution of β-arrestin2-GFP was observed in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 2A). However, co-expression with endoglin resulted in the redistribution of β-arrestin2-GFP into endocytic vesicles (Fig. 2C). In the absence of β-arrestin2, endoglin was localized at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2B). Co-expression with β-arrestin2 resulted in the internalization of endoglin into endocytic vesicles, where endoglin co-localized with β-arrestin2-GFP (Fig. 2, C-E). In contrast, expression of the alternatively spliced form of endoglin lacking the β-arrestin2 interaction motif, endoglin-S (Fig. 1A), or endoglin-T650A, failed to redistribute β-arrestin2-GFP (Fig. 2, I and L), and both endoglin-S and endoglin-T650A remained on the cell surface even in the presence of β-arrestin2 (Fig. 2, J and M), confirming the site of interaction between endoglin and β-arrestin2, and the specificity of this interaction.FIGURE 2Recruitment and co-localization of β-arrestin2 with endoglin in endocytic vesicles. HEK 293 cells transiently expressing β-arrestin2-GFP alone (A), HA-tagged endoglin alone (B), β-arrestin2-GFP with HA-tagged endoglin (C-E), β-arrestin2-GFP, HA-tagged endoglin and TβRII (F-H), β-arrestin2-GFP with HA-tagged endoglin-T650A (I-K), or β-arrestin2-GFP with endoglin-S (L-N) were fixed, permeabilized, and stained to visualize epitope-tagged endoglin localization. Confocal images (×100) of β-arrestin2-GFP (A, C, F, I, and L) and HA-endoglin (B, D, G, J, and M) were obtained. β-Arrestin2-GFP co-localizes with HA-endoglin in the merged images (E and H), but not with endoglin-T650A (K). Data are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As the association between endoglin and β-arrestin2 was enhanced in the presence of ALK-1 and TβRII in the co-immunoprecipitation studies, we next examined how the presence of the signaling co-receptors influenced the co-localization and internalization process of endoglin/β-arrestin2. Whereas expression of ALK-1, TβRII, or ALK-5 did not change the internalization profile of the endoglin/β-arrestin2 complex (Fig. 2, F-H, data not shown), there was a significant increase in the frequency of cells displaying endocytic vesicles. We made a quantitative assessment of the contribution of expression of TβRII, ALK-1, and ALK-5 by determining the percentage of cells expressing both endoglin and β-arrestin2 that exhibited an endocytic pattern of β-arrestin2-GFP as opposed to a diffuse cytoplasmic pattern. As indicated in Table 1, ∼35% of the cells expressing β-arrestin2-GFP and endoglin displayed internalization in HEK 293 cells. In the presence of TβRII and ALK-1, the percentage of cells expressing β-arrestin2-GFP and endoglin displaying an internalization pattern increased to ∼50 and ∼60% of cells, respectively. These results correlated closely with the effects of TβRII and ALK-1 on co-immunoprecipitation of β-arrestin2-GFP and endoglin (Fig. 1B).TABLE 1Recruitment of β-arrestin2-GFP to intracellular vesicles by endoglin (Endo) and associated signaling receptorsTransfection with β-arrestin2-GFPβ-Arrestin2-GFP vesicle formation%Endo36 ± 10Endo + TβRII52 ± 12Endo + ALK-159 ± 2Endo + ALK-514 ± 3Endo-T650A<5Endo-S<5 Open table in a new tab To establish whether the endoglin/β-arrestin2 interaction resulted in their co-internalization in a more physiological endothelial context, we employed the β-arrestin2-GFP assay in the endoglin-/- MEECs. As expected, β-arrestin2-GFP, when expressed alone, demonstrated a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution (Fig. 3A). The co-expression of β-arrestin2-GFP and wild-type endoglin resulted in their co-localization in endocytic vesicles (Fig. 3, C-E), whereas endoglin-T650A failed to associate and form a complex with β-arrestin2-GFP (Fig. 3, F-H). In endoglin-/- MEECs, more than 50% of the cells expressing β-arrestin2-GFP and endoglin displayed internalization, suggesting a potential contribution of endogenous ALK-1 and/or TβRII on the interaction. In contrast, less than 5% of the cells expressing endoglin-S or endoglin-T650A demonstrated an internalization pattern, confirming the specificity of the assay and interaction in endothelial cells.FIGURE 3Recruitment and co-localization of β-arrestin2 with endoglin in endothelial cells. β-Arrestin2-GFP alone (A), endoglin alone (B),β-arrestin2-GFP with HA-tagged endoglin (C-E), or with HA-tagged endoglin-T650A (F-H) were transiently expressed in endoglin-/- MEECs by electroporation. Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained to visualize epitope-tagged endoglin localization, and confocal images (×100) of β-arrestin2-GFP (A, C, and E), and HA-tagged endoglin constructs (D and G) obtained. β-Arrestin2-GFP exclusively co-localizes with HA-endoglin wild-type in the merged image (E). Endoglin and β-arrestin2 siRNA were electroporated into endoglin-/- MEECs (I-K). Cells were stained with β-arrestin2 antibody to visualize endogenous expression of β-arrestin2 before and after treatment with β-arrestin2 siRNA (L versus I, respectively). Data are representative of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Whereas the failure of endoglin-T650A to bind β-arrestin2, internalize, or co-localize with β-arrestin2 strongly suggested a role for β-arrestin2 in endoglin internalization, to further investigate a role for β-arrestin2 we utilized siRNA-mediated silencing of endogenous β-arrestin2 expression. The efficacy of siRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous β-arrestin2 expression was confirmed by immunofluorescence (Fig. 3, L versus I). Consistent with a role for β-arrestin2 in endoglin internalization, siRNA-mediated silencing of β-arrestin2 expression (Fig. 3I) completely abrogated endoglin internalization (Fig. 3, J and K).Endoglin Regulates TGF-β-mediated Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) Signaling—Having established the interaction of endoglin and β-arrestin2, we sought to identify a role for the endoglin/β-arrestin2 interaction. As the interaction of TβRIII with β-arrestin2 resulted in the down-regulation of TGF-β signaling, we first examined the Smad pathways immediately downstream of endoglin, including Smad 2 and Smad 1/5/8 in endoglin-/- and endoglin+/+ MEECs using phosphospecific Smad antibodies. TGF-β treatment of endoglin-/- and endoglin+/+ MEECs resulted in comparable levels of both Smad 1/5/8 and Smad 2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4A) and Smad 1/5 and Smad 2 nuclear translocation (data not shown). To test whether β-arrestin2 directly impacts the Smad pathways, siRNA silencing was"

The two forms of HO (HO-1 and HO-2) share similar physical properties but are differentially regulated and exhibit dissimilar physiological roles and tissue distributions. Unlike HO-1, HO-2 contains heme regulatory motifs (HRMs) (McCoubrey, W. K., Jr., Huang, T. J., and Maines, M. D. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 12568–12574). Here we describe UV-visible, EPR, and differential scanning calorimetry experiments on human HO-2 variants containing single, double, and triple mutations in the HRMs. Oxidized HO-2, which contains an intramolecular disulfide bond linking Cys265 of HRM1 and Cys282 of HRM2, binds heme tightly. Reduction of the disulfide bond increases the Kd for ferric heme from 0.03 to 0.3 μm, which is much higher than the concentration of the free heme pool in cells. Although the HRMs markedly affect the Kd for heme, they do not alter the kcat for heme degradation and do not bind additional hemes. Because HO-2 plays a key role in CO generation and heme homeostasis, reduction of the disulfide bond would be expected to increase intracellular free heme and decrease CO concentrations. Thus, we propose that the HRMs in HO-2 constitute a thiol/disulfide redox switch that regulates the myriad physiological functions of HO-2, including its involvement in the hypoxic response in the carotid body, which involves interactions with a Ca2+-activated potassium channel.

Subsequently, biliverdin reductase catalyzes the two-electron reduction of biliverdin to bilirubin. HO is present in organisms from bacteria to eukaryotes and, as the only known enzyme that can degrade heme, plays a critical role in heme and iron homeostasis. Maintaining tight control of heme levels is important because heme is toxic at concentrations >1 μm (3Sassa S. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2006; 38: 138-155Google Scholar); however, it is the required prosthetic group of many electron transfer proteins and redox enzymes and regulates genes involved in oxygen utilization in lower eukaryotes and prokaryotes (4Qi Z.

Iron deficiency is pathological because iron is the essential catalytic center for many heme and non-heme metalloenzymes, yet iron excess is also pathological (7Baker H.M. Anderson B.F. Baker E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3579-3583Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). CO is toxic at high levels (>500 ppm), yet HO-derived CO, which is produced locally within tissues, serves a signaling function in various physiological processes, including circadian modulation of heme biosynthesis, regulation of T cell function, and modulation of caveolin-1 status in growth control (8Kim H.P. Ryter S.W. Choi A.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2006; 46: 411-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) as well as activation of guanylate cyclase (9Baranano D.E. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl.

There are two forms of HO (HO-1 and HO-2), which share similar physical and kinetic properties, but are differentially regulated and exhibit dissimilar physiological roles and tissue distributions. HO-1, considered to be the inducible HO, is also known as the heat-shock protein HSP32 and is found in most tissues, with particularly high levels in the spleen and liver. Expression of HO-1 is regulated by heat shock and various oxidative stress conditions such as ischemia, hypoxia, hyperoxia, and alteration of glutathione levels (11Maines M.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar, 12Maines M.D. Heme Oxygenase: In Clinical Applications and Functions. 1992; (, CRC Press LLC, Boca Raton, FL)Google Scholar). On the other hand, HO-2 appears to be constitutively expressed, but exhibits a narrow tissue distribution, with high levels in the brain and testes (11Maines M.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). HO-2 has been implicated in oxygen sensing by the carotid body (10Williams S.E. Wootton P. Mason H.S. Bould J. Iles D.E.

Med. 1999; 222: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Human HO-1 and HO-2 exhibit similar catalytic activities and share a high level of homology (55% identity and 76% similarity), including related stretches of 20 hydrophobic residues at their C termini that anchor them to the microsomal membrane (11Maines M.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). However, HO-1 and HO-2 diverge significantly around residue 127 and between residues 240 and 295 (HO-2 numbering throughout unless stated otherwise). Although HO-1 typically lacks Cys residues, there are three Cys-Pro sequences in regions that have been proposed to contain heme regulatory (or responsive) motifs (HRMs) centered at Cys127, Cys265, and Cys282. It has been proposed that the HRM per se can bind heme (4Qi Z. Hamza I. O'Brian M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13056-13061Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 16Huang T.J.

Biol. 2003; 23: 5857-5866Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In 5-aminolevulinate synthase, there are three HRMs that reverse the heme-mediated inhibition of mitochondrial import of the synthase (21Munakata H. Sun J.Y. Yoshida K. Nakatani T. Honda E. Hayakawa S. Furuyama K. Hayashi N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2004; 136: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), whereas in the human iron-responsive regulator IRR, heme binding to the HRMs appears to regulate protein degradation (18Yang J. Panek H.R. O'Brian M.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the case of HO-2, it was concluded that one heme binds to each of the two HRMs at the C terminus as well as to the active site, where it undergoes conversion to biliverdin (24McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Huang T.J. Maines M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12568-12574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In the work described here, we have addressed whether or not heme binds to the HRMs in HO-2 and examined the role of the HRMs by comparing the properties of wild-type HO-2 and variants generated by substituting the Cys residues (singly or in combination) with Ala. Our results demonstrate that the HRMs have no effect on the steady-state catalytic activity and stability of HO-2. However, the C-terminal HRMs appear to act as a thiol/disulfide redox switch that regulates the affinity of HO-2 for heme and the spin state of the heme iron. Our results indicate that reduction of the disulfide bond between Cys265 and Cys282 lowers the affinity of HO-2 for heme by 10-fold, thus increasing the dissociation constant from 0.03 μm (near the concentration of free heme found in cells) to 0.35 μm. This increase in the heme Kd would be expected to increase the free heme pool and thus lower CO, iron, and biliverdin levels in the cell. Cloning, Overexpression, and Purification of Human HO-2—The human full-length HO-2 cDNA in a pGEX-4T-2 vector (Amersham Biosciences), which was graciously contributed by Dr. Mahin D. Maines (University of Rochester, School of Medicine), was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21. In this construct, the human HO-2 fragment is fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) and thus can be overexpressed and purified using a glutathione affinity column. BL21 cells carrying the pGEX-4T-2/HO-2 plasmid were cultured in 1 liter of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. When the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.8–1.0, 60 mg of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride (Sigma) was added along with 300 μlof1 m isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Gold BioTechnology, St. Louis, MO) to induce the expression of HO-2. The cells were incubated for another 15 h at 25 °C and harvested by centrifugation at 7000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C in a Beckman J2-HS centrifuge. The cell pellet was resuspended in 5 volumes of 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4), containing Triton X-100 (0.04% (v/v); Sigma), protease inhibitor (1 tablet/50 ml of extraction solution; Roche Applied Science), lysozyme (0.5 mg/ml; Sigma), and DNase I (5 units/ml; Sigma) at 4 °C. Cells were then lysed by sonication, and the suspension was centrifuged at 17,000 rpm for 1 h at 4°C in the Beckman J2-HS centrifuge. The supernatant was loaded onto a 10-ml glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences), which was washed with 1× PBS containing 0.04% (v/v) Triton X-100. The HO-2/GST fusion protein was eluted with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.04% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 10 mm reduced glutathione, pH 7.4; and the combined fractions containing the HO-2/GST fusion protein were extensively dialyzed with 1× PBS containing 0.04% (v/v) Triton X-100 to remove glutathione. The GST domain then was cleaved by limited proteolysis using thrombin, and HO-2 was separated from GST by chromatography on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column. All of these steps were carried out at 4 °C. Site-directed Mutagenesis of HO-2—As described below, the truncated HO-2 variants are more stable and soluble than the full-length protein. A number of variants were generated to determine the functional roles of the HRMs in HO-2. Two kinds of truncated HO-2 were generated: one lacking the C-terminal membrane-binding region (HO-2Δ289–316) the other lacking the two C-terminal HRMs and the membrane-binding region (HO-2Δ265–316). The C265A, C282A, C127A, C265A/C282A, and C127A/C282A variants were generated from HO-2Δ289–316, and C127A/Δ265–316 was from HO-2Δ265–316. All mutations were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The pGEX-4T-2/HO-2 plasmid was the template for PCRs using primers from Integrated DNA Technologies (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1989; (, 2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY)Google Scholar). All of these variants were purified by the same procedure described above for the wild-type enzyme. HO-2 Assay—The HO-2 enzymatic assay was slightly modified from that described previously (26Ishikawa K. Matera K.M. Zhou H. Fujii H. Sato M. Yoshimura T. Ikeda-Saito M. Yoshida T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4317-4322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The 1-ml reaction mixture contained 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 20 μm freshly prepared hemin (froma2mm stock containing 0.1 m NaOH and 5% Me2SO), 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 30 μg of NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, 60 μg of purified human biliverdin reductase, and 30–100 μg of HO-2. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C, and the reaction was started by the addition of 10 μl of 100 mm NADPH and monitored by following the increase in absorbance at 468 nm using a Beckman DU7400 spectrophotometer. The specific activities of the various wild-type and variant HO-2 proteins were calculated using the difference extinction coefficient between heme and bilirubin at 468 nm (43.5 mm–1 cm–1). P450 reductase was donated by Dr. Bettie Sue Masters (University of Texas Health Sciences Center, Arlington, TX). Biliverdin reductase was purified from E. coli cells containing pGEX-4T-2/BVR. The BVR gene was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and then subcloned into the pGEX-4T-2 plasmid. Quantification of Heme Binding by the Pyridine Hemochrome Assay—HO-2 ·heme complexes were prepared by incubating purified HO-2 variants with a 5-fold molar excess of Fe3+ heme from a stock that was freshly prepared in 5% Me2SO to prevent aggregation. After incubation at 4 °C for 10 min, excess free heme was removed by chromatography on a Sephadex G-15 gel filtration column (Sigma). The amount of heme bound to HO-2 was calculated using a difference extinction coefficient at 556 nm of 28.32 mm–1 cm–1 (27Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Determination of Free Thiol Groups by the 5,5′-Dithiobis(nitrobenzoic Acid) (DTNB) Assay—Free thiol quantification of HO-2 was conducted by the DTNB assay basically as described (28Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1958; 74: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar, 29Bulaj G. Kortemme T. Goldenberg D.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8965-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). After incubation of the 1-ml reaction mixture containing HO-2, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 100 μm DTNB at room temperature for 15 min, the absorbance at 412 nm was recorded, and the free thiol concentrations were calculated by reference to a standard curve generated using dithiothreitol (DTT). The DTNB titration was performed in the presence and absence of 8 m urea. When the thiol groups in DTT-reduced HO-2 were measured, the protein was extensively dialyzed in an anaerobic chamber (Vacuum Atmospheres Co., Hawthorne, CA) before the assay. Alkylation of Cysteine Residues and Mass Spectrometric Analysis—One- and two-step alkylation reactions were performed as described previously (30Elliott J.I. Brewer J.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 190: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Samples (2 mg/ml) of reduced (with 10 mm DTT) and oxidized (lacking DTT) HO-2 were dissolved in 0.5 ml of 8 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, and1mm Na-EDTA. The first alkylation step was performed by the addition of 50 mm iodoacetamide (final concentration) and incubation for 30 min at room temperature. The excess iodoacetamide was removed by precipitating the protein by adding a solution containing cold acetone and 1 N HCl/H2O (98:2:10), followed by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. After washing the pellet three times with the same solution, the protein was reduced by reacting with 10 mm DTT for 30 min at 37 °C, and the second alkylation step was performed by the addition of 2 μlof9.5 m 4-vinylpyridine and incubation for 20 min at room temperature. The 4-vinylpyridine addition was repeated three times. The unbound 4-vinylpyridine was removed using the acidic acetone solution as described above. After the one- and two-step alkylation reactions, samples were digested with trypsin overnight at room temperature, and the tryptic peptides were isolated and analyzed by nano-liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry using a QSTAR XL mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). Peptide isolation was accomplished with a C18 PepMap100 column (75 μm × 15 cm, 3 μm, 100 Å; LC Packings, Sunnyvale, CA) using a linear gradient from 0.3% formic acid in H2O to 0.3% formic acid in acetonitrile at a flow rate of 170 nl/min. The mass spectroscopic results were analyzed using the MASCOT search engine. Spectroscopic and Analytical Methods—Protein concentration was calculated based on the rose bengal method (30Elliott J.I. Brewer J.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 190: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) using a standard curve generated using known amounts of HO-2, the concentration of which was determined by dry weight. The heme binding affinity of each of the HO-2 variants was determined by adding heme to the reference and sample (containing HO-2) cuvettes and measuring the difference spectrum from 350 to 750 nm in an Olis updated Cary 14 double-beam spectrophotometer. To determine the binding affinity of Fe3+ heme, freshly prepared hemin (from a stock solution of 500 μm hemin in 5% Me2SO) was added in 1–2-μl aliquots to the sample cuvette containing 8 μm HO-2 in 1 ml of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and to the reference cuvette containing the same buffer. The stock hemin (Fe3+ heme) solution was prepared by dissolving hemin in 0.1 m NaOH and 5% Me2SO and filtration with a 0.2-μm syringe filter (Amicon, Beverly, MA). The heme concentration was calculated using an extinction coefficient at 385 nm of 58.4 mm–1 cm–1 (31Kirschner-Zilber I. Rabizadeh E. Shaklai N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 690: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To determine the binding affinity of reduced HO-2 for hemin, the as-isolated protein was incubated with a 50-fold molar excess of DTT in the anaerobic chamber for 30 min. DTT was then removed by dialyzing the protein in anaerobic buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl and 50 mm KCl, pH 7.4). Titration was performed as just described for the oxidized protein, except that it was performed under anaerobic conditions in serum-stoppered cuvettes. To determine the binding affinity of HO-2 for ferrous heme, freshly prepared sodium dithionite (2 mm final concentration) was added to a stock solution of 200 μm Fe2+ heme in 20% Me2SO in the anaerobic chamber. Titrations with the reduced protein and Fe2+ heme were performed as described above in serum-stoppered cuvettes to maintain anaerobic conditions. The heme titration data were plotted and fit to a one-binding site model to determine the dissociation constant (Equations 1 and 2), ΔA=ΔɛċEL1 EL=0.5((Eo+Lo+Kd-(Eo+Lo+Kd)2-4Eo.Lo)1/2)2 where ΔA is the absorbance difference between sample and reference cuvettes; Δɛ is the difference extinction coefficient between bound and free heme; and EL is the concentration of the HO-2 ·heme complex, which is calculated using the quadratic Equation 2, in which EO is the total HO-2 concentration, LO is the total heme concentration, and Kd is the dissociation constant. EPR measurements were performed on a Bruker ESP 300E spectrometer recently upgraded to an EMX, operating at ∼9.39 GHz and equipped with an Oxford ITC4 temperature controller, a Hewlett-Packard Model 5340 automatic frequency counter to monitor microwave frequency, and a Bruker gaussmeter to determine the magnetic flux density. All of the EPR samples were prepared in 50 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7.4. Protein Stability Measured by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)—Heat-induced unfolding was performed in a DSC microcalorimeter (MicroCal, LLC, Northhampton, MA). Purified protein was dialyzed against 1× PBS, pH 7.4, to remove the Triton X-100, and a 0.2 mg/ml protein solution was degassed for 5 min at room temperature before loading into the cells. The scan was performed at a rate of 1 °C/min from 20 to 80 °C. Thermogram analysis was performed using Origin Version 7.0 software supplied with the instrument. The major difference between HO-1 and HO-2 is the lack of cysteine residues in HO-1 and the presence of three Cys-Pro or heme regulatory motifs (HRMs) in HO-2. To determine the function of the HRMs, we compared the biochemical properties of HO-2 variants in which the cysteine residues in the three HRMs were substituted with alanine, individually and in combination (Fig. 1). We refer to the two C-terminal HRMs as HRM1 and HRM2 and the one including residue 127 as HRM3. The comparisons were made among various HO-2 variants lacking the C-terminal membrane-spanning region (HO-2Δ289–316) because the full-length protein is fairly insoluble and undergoes cleavage, whereas the truncated forms of HO-2, like HO-1 (26Ishikawa K. Matera K.M. Zhou H. Fujii H. Sato M. Yoshimura T. Ikeda-Saito M. Yoshida T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4317-4322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), are soluble and stable. To generate HO-2Δ289– 316, a TAA stop codon was inserted after position 288. All of the truncated HRM variants could be obtained in yields of 15–20 mg/liter of culture. Because the sequence between residues 240 and 295 in HO-2 contributes the major difference between HO-1 and HO-2, HO-2 was further truncated at position 264 to generate HO-2Δ265–316, which lacks both C-terminal HRMs. In addition, Cys127 was substituted with Ala in HO-2Δ265–316 to generate a variant that lacks all three Cys residues (C127A/Δ265–316). Effect of HRMs on HO-2 Stability—Similar amounts of purified HO-2 were recovered from cells expressing wild-type protein or any of the variants. Each of the purified proteins showed predominantly a single band when analyzed by SDS-PAGE, with a purity between 91 and 96% based on densitometric analysis (Fig. 2A). In addition, DSC experiments were carried out to evaluate the influence of HRMs on HO-2 stability. The DSC profiles for the variants overlay that for the wild-type protein and fit a non-two-state model (Fig. 3) with similar melting temperatures in the range of 52.4–53.7 °C (Table 1). These results indicate that neither the HRMs nor the sequence between the HRMs at the C terminus affects protein stability.FIGURE 3DSC experiments of HO-2 and HRM variants. All DSC data were fit to a non-two-state model. Solid lines, experimental data; dotted lines, fit of the DSC data to a non-two-state model.

We established that the addition of Me2SO in the assay mixture at concentrations up to 0.2% had no effect on HO-2 activity. As shown in Fig. 2B, both full-length HO-2 and the HO-2Δ289–316 truncation variant, which lacks the membrane-spanning region, exhibited similar activities of ∼5.2 nmol/min/mg. Therefore, because the C-terminal membrane-binding region does not affect enzymatic activity, Cys substitutions were generated in the more soluble and stable HO-2Δ289–316 truncation variant to explore the function(s) of the HRMs in HO-2 (Fig. 2B). To simplify their descriptions, we have omitted the Δ289–316 designation from the variants; thus, substitution of Cys265 with Ala in HO-2Δ289–316 generated a variant that we labeled simply C265A. All of the Cys variants, including C265A/C282A, C127A, C265A, C282A, and C127A/C282A, exhibited similar heme degradation activities in the range of 5.0–5.5 nmol/min/mg. The HO-2Δ265–316 truncation variant, lacking the entire HRM1-HRM2 region, and C127A/Δ265–316, lacking all three Cys residues, had similar enzymatic activities of 5.5 and 5.3 nmol/min/mg, respectively. These results strongly indicate that HRM1, HRM2, and HRM3 do not affect steady-state HO-2 activity. Evaluation of Heme Binding to the HRMs in HO-2—A previous study indicated that rat HO-2 binds three hemes: one heme at the active site (coordinated by His45) plus one each at the two C-terminal HRMs (24McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Huang T.J. Maines M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12568-12574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, the UV-visible spectra of the Fe(III), Fe(II), and Fe(II)-CO states of all the HRM variants are identical to those of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 4, A–C). The spectra show a Soret peak at 406 nm and four long wavelength range peaks at 503, 532, 571, and 630 nm (Fig. 4A). The Fe(II) states exhibit a Soret peak at 430 nm and a long wavelength peak at 557 nm with a shoulder at 527 nm (Fig. 4B), whereas the Fe(II)-CO adducts show a Soret peak at 422 nm and two long wavelength peaks at 541 and 572 nm (Fig. 4C). These spectra, including the extinction coefficients, are very similar to those of the Fe(III), Fe(II), and Fe(II)-CO states of human HO-1 (32Sun J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Loehr T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14151-14157Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and of myoglobin (33Dou Y. Admiraal S. Ikeda-Saito M. Krzywda S. Wilkinson A. Li T. Olson J. Prince R. Pickering I.

To further assess the possibility of heme binding to the HRMs, a 5-fold excess of heme was incubated with the wild-type enzyme and each of the variants; unbound heme was removed by gel filtration chromatography; and the heme content was measured by the pyridine hemochrome assay (Fig. 5). Oxidized HO-2Δ289–316 and C282A at 1.58 and 1.51 μm, respectively, were found to bind ∼1.5 μm ferric heme. The other HO-2 variants also exhibi"
https://openalex.org/W2006072798,"Erythropoietin primarily serves as an essential growth factor for erythrocyte precursor cells. However, there is increasing evidence that erythropoietin (EPO)/EPO receptor (EPO-R) signaling operates as a potential tissue-protective system outside the bone marrow. Arguing that growing hair follicles (HF) are among the most rapidly proliferating tissues, we have here explored whether human HFs are sources of EPO and targets of EPO-R-mediated signaling. Human scalp skin and microdissected HFs were assessed for EPO and EPO-R expression, and the effects of EPO on organ-cultured HFs were assessed in the presence/absence of a classical apoptosis-inducing chemotherapeutic agent. Here, we show that human scalp HFs express EPO on the mRNA and protein level in situ, up-regulate EPO transcription under hypoxic conditions, and express transcripts for EPO-R and the EPO-stimulatory transcriptional cofactor hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha. Although EPO does not significantly alter human hair growth in vitro, it significantly down-regulates chemotherapy-induced intrafollicular apoptosis and changes the gene expression program of the HFs. The current study points to intriguing targets of EPO beyond the erythropoietic system: human HFs are an extrarenal site of EPO production and an extrahematopoietic site of EPO-R expression. They may recruit EPO/EPO-R signaling e.g., for modulating HF apoptosis under conditions of hypoxia and chemotherapy-induced stress."
https://openalex.org/W1969405537,"Abnormal dietary intake of macronutrients is implicated in the development of obesity and fatty liver disease. Steatosis develops in cultured hepatocytes exposed to medium containing either a high concentration of long chain free fatty acids (HFFA) or medium deficient in methionine and choline (MCD). This study examined the mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent regulation of the phosphoinositol (PI) 3-kinase pathway in steatosis induced by exposure of AML-12 mouse hepatocytes to MCD or HFFA medium. Exposure to either MCD or HFFA medium resulted in increased production of superoxide anions and H2O2, transduction of the PI 3-kinase pathway and steatosis. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase with LY294002 prevented steatosis. Pharmacologically inhibiting electron transport chain complex III production of ROS prevented activation of PI 3-kinase during macronutrient perturbation, whereas pharmacologically promoting electron transport chain complex III ROS production activated PI 3-kinase independent of nutrient input. The data suggest that H2O2 is the ROS species involved in signal transduction; promoting the rapid conversion of superoxide to H2O2 does not inhibit PI 3-kinase pathway activation during nutrient perturbation, and exogenous H2O2 activates it independent of nutrient input. In addition to transducing PI 3-kinase, the ROS-dependent signal cascade amplifies the PI 3-kinase signal by maintaining phosphatase and tensin homolog in its inactive phosphorylated state. Knockdown of phosphatase and tensin homolog by small interfering RNA independently activated the PI 3-kinase pathway. Our findings suggest a common path for response to altered nutrition involving mitochondrial ROS-dependent PI 3-kinase pathway regulation, leading to steatosis.

Innumerable epidemiologic studies demonstrate that inappropriate intake of macronutrients and a sedentary lifestyle conspire to produce rampant obesity in the United States. Hepatic steatosis (the accumulation of excess neutral fat within hepatocytes) in obese persons is thought to result from metabolic disturbances attendant to obesity. An estimated 30 million adults and 1.6 million children in the United States have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), 2The abbreviations used are: NAFLD, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; NASH, nonalcoholic steatosis; MCD, medium deficient in methionine and choline; HFFA, medium containing a high concentration of long chain free fatty acids; PI, phosphatidylinositol; OPN, osteopontin; ROS, reactive oxygen species; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homolog; pPTEN, phosphorylated PTEN; PIP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DHE, dihydroethidium; DCF, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate; MnTBAP, Mn(III) tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ETC, electron transport chain; FFA, free fatty acid(s). of which an estimated 30% have nonalcoholic steatosis (NASH), which can lead to chronic debilitating liver injury, including cirrhosis (1Angulo P. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 346: 1221-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (4169) Google Scholar). Hepatic steatosis is the defining feature of NAFLD (2Brunt E.M. Semin. Liver Dis. 2004; 24: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). It is commonly held that steatosis is the precursor of events that lead to the transition of NAFLD to NASH, including the induction of oxidative stress and activation of inflammatory pathways (3Chitturi S. Farrell G.C. Semin. Liver Dis. 2001; 21: 27-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 4Day C.P. Gastroenterology. 2006; 130: 207-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The development of hepatic steatosis is therefore considered to be the necessary first effect of disturbed nutrition that induces the cascade of events leading to NASH. How disturbed nutrition causes hepatic steatosis is not well understood. Experimental NASH can be produced in laboratory rodents by dietary manipulation, including both restricted intake (i.e. methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet) (5Weltman M.D. Farrell G.C. Liddle C. Gastroenterology. 1996; 111: 1645-1653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) and excess intake (i.e. various high fat diets) (6Lieber C.S. Leo M.A. Mak K.M. Xu Y. Cao Q. Ren C. Ponomarenko A. DeCarli L.M. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2004; 79: 502-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 7Deng Q.G. She H. Cheng J.H. French S.W. Koop D.R. Xiong S. Tsukamoto H. Hepatology. 2005; 42: 905-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). How nutritional excess and deprivation can both culminate in experimental NASH is not clear (8Ahima R.S. Gastroenterology. 2007; 132: 444-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The MCD diet-fed mouse is a well accepted and reliable model of experimental NASH (9Koteish A. Diehl A.M. Semin. Liver Dis. 2001; 21: 89-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 10Rizki G. Arnaboldi L. Gabrielli B. Yan J. Lee G.S. Ng R.K. Turner S.M. Badger T.M. Pitas R.E. Maher J.J. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 2280-2290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Our findings using this model have suggested that this is not so much a model of toxicity induced by deficiency of methyl donor molecules, as is commonly thought, but a model of dietary imbalance that incites an orchestrated response leading to experimental NASH. In a detailed time course study of female A/J mice fed the MCD diet, we found that these mice developed significant steatosis and massive overexpression of the Th1 cytokine osteopontin (OPN) within 1 week of starting the diet (11Sahai A. Malladi P. Melin-Aldana H. Green R.M. Whitington P.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287 (-G273): G264Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The hepatic expression of OPN protein was 16-fold increased after 1 day of diet treatment and 40-fold increased after 2 days, whereas mRNA expression was not increased until 2 weeks, suggesting translational regulation of early OPN protein expression. These events occurred at a time when the diet is unlikely to have produced toxic deficiency. Furthermore, no oxidative injury developed until 4–8 weeks of dietary deprivation. Therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that the dietary change directly influenced the induction of the metabolic response represented by OPN overexpression. To further explore the possibility that the MCD diet represented a signal leading to steatosis and other expressions of experimental NASH, including the overexpression of OPN, we examined the effects of substituting medium deficient in methionine and choline (MCD medium) on AML-12 mouse hepatocytes in vitro (12Sahai A. Pan X. Paul R. Malladi P. Kohli R. Whitington P.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291 (-G62): G55Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Substituting MCD medium for control medium produced significant hepatocyte steatosis by 18 h of exposure. Exposure to MCD medium induced significant increases in OPN protein expression by 6 h of treatment. Thus, the in vitro situation mimicked the early events in the in vivo MCD diet model. We further showed that exposure to the MCD medium induced a significant increase in the PI 3-kinase p85 regulatory subunit expression beginning at 1 h of incubation and a sustained increase in pAkt expression during 1–18 h of incubation. Inhibiting PI 3-kinase with LY294002 blocked the MCD medium-induced increases of OPN expression and prevented cellular steatosis from developing. Taken together, these findings suggested that there is an orchestrated cellular response to the stress induced by exposure to MCD medium in which OPN expression and steatosis are dependent upon the activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway. In the present study, we sought to determine the mechanisms by which nutrient perturbation produces steatosis in hepatocytes in culture. Feldstein et al. (13Feldstein A.E. Werneburg N.W. Canbay A.

Hepatology. 2004; 40: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar) demonstrated that human hepatocytes (HepG2 cells) in culture treated with medium containing excess long-chain fatty acid (HFFA) medium develop steatosis. We hypothesized that nutrient perturbation in the form of macronutrient deprivation (MCD medium) or excess (HFFA medium) activates and modulates the PI 3-kinase cell signaling pathway to produce steatosis. We proposed that its activation results from increased production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by the change in macronutrient input. Mitochondrial dysfunction and injury are thought to be important in the pathogenesis of NAFLD (14Browning J.D. Horton J.D. J. Clin.

Fernandez-Checa J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 825-834PubMed Google Scholar). ROS are produced by mitochondria during normal oxidative metabolism, and we hypothesized that a change in macronutrient input could induce a metabolic stress that would increase the rate of ROS production by mitochondria. ROS species, in particular H2O2, can act as signals by increasing tyrosine phosphorylation of receptor tyrosine kinases even in the absence of growth factor binding, thus independently inducing the activation of downstream signaling cascades like that of PI 3-kinase (20Esposito F.

Showing that perturbation of macronutrient input to hepatocytes, either deprivation or excess input, produces steatosis by mechanisms that are dependent upon mitochondrial ROS regulating the PI 3-kinase pathway would provide evidence for a novel link between abnormal dietary intake and NASH. We further proposed that phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is mechanistically involved in the positive modulation of the PI 3-kinase signaling pathway during nutrient perturbation. PTEN is the natural inhibitor of the PI 3-kinase pathway, acting to degrade PIP3 produced by PI 3-kinase before it can activate Akt through phosphorylation. PTEN can be inactivated by exposure to ROS. Specifically, exposure of purified PTEN or cells to H2O2 can result in time and concentration-dependent oxidation of PTEN and reduction of phosphatase activity (21Lee S.R. Yang K.S. Kwon J. Lee C. Jeong W. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20336-20342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). Further, PTEN function is regulated by its membrane interaction, which is determined in large part by the degree of phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail (22Vazquez F. Devreotes P. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 1523-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The constitutively phosphorylated protein (pPTEN) must be dephosphorylated before it can bind to membrane PDZ-containing proteins and assume full functionality as a lipid phosphatase (23Vazquez F. Ramaswamy S. Nakamura N. Sellers W.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 5010-5018Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 24Vazquez F. Grossman S.R. Takahashi Y. Rokas M.V. Nakamura N. Sellers W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48627-48630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). However, the dephosphorylated protein is unstable and rapidly degraded (23Vazquez F. Ramaswamy S. Nakamura N. Sellers W.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 5010-5018Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Thus, the phosphatase activity of PTEN is entirely dependent upon the rate of dephosphorylation of pPTEN, providing tight regulation of this important suppressor of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway. PTEN activity is modulated in this way during ischemia/perfusion stress (25Cai Z. Semenza G.L. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 1351-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), which suggests that ROS signaling may be involved. Finally, the importance of PTEN in hepatic steatosis was demonstrated by showing that liver-specific PTEN knockouts develop steatosis and NASH-like disease (26Watanabe S. Horie Y. Suzuki A. Hepatol. Res. 2005; 33: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). If nutrient perturbation activates PI 3-kinase and inhibits PTEN function, it would provide evidence of a novel signal amplification mechanism with potential importance in the evolution of fatty liver disease. The overall aim of the present study was to determine the signaling mechanisms involved in the development of hepatocyte steatosis resulting from altered macronutrient input, specifically the role of mitochondrial ROS in the downstream activation and modulation of the PI 3-kinase pathway. Hepatocyte Cell Culture—AML-12 cells, a mouse hepatocyte cell line that has been stably transfected with human transforming growth factor-α (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA), were treated as previously described (12Sahai A. Pan X. Paul R. Malladi P. Kohli R. Whitington P.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291 (-G62): G55Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In brief, these cells are grown to 70–80% confluence in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/Ham’s nutrient mixture F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum (for growth factors) and then made quiescent by incubating for 24 h in standard medium without fetal bovine serum. Quiescent cells were then exposed either to control growth medium (MC+; methionine (0.116 mm) and choline (0.064 mm)) or identical medium that was manufactured to be completely deficient in methionine and choline (MCD medium) purchased from Invitrogen. In separate experiments, cells were treated with control medium and HFFA medium (addition of 1.0 mmol/liter fatty acid mixture of 2:1 oleate/palmitate) with 1% bovine serum albumin supplemented with identical glucose and serum concentrations. This HFFA construct was used because it has been successfully used in vitro to produce steatosis and experimental NASH in cultured primary mouse hepatocytes and HepG2 cells (13Feldstein A.E. Werneburg N.W. Canbay A. Guicciardi M.E. Bronk S.F. Rydzewski R. Burgart L.J. Gores G.J. Hepatology. 2004; 40: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Cells were then maintained at 37 °C for various times before harvesting for analysis. Inclusion of pharmacologic agents with control or test media was used as described under “Results.” Steatosis Analysis—Cellular triglyceride content was determined after 18 h of treatment as described (12Sahai A. Pan X. Paul R. Malladi P. Kohli R. Whitington P.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291 (-G62): G55Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cells were scraped from culture plates that had been rinsed with cold PBS and were subsequently pelleted by centrifugation. The cell pellet was suspended in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, and homogenized. Cell triglyceride content in the whole homogenates was measured using a spectrophotometric kit procedure (Thermo DMA, Arlington, TX) and expressed as μg of triglyceride/mg of protein. Hepatocyte steatosis was also determined in situ using standard Oil-Red O dye staining. Confocal Time Lapse Microscopy for Analysis of ROS—AML-12 cells grown on glass bottom Petri dishes (Matek, Ashland, MA) and made quiescent were exposed to control medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) dye (Sigma) for 20 min, rinsed with sterile PBS once, and then incubated with control medium containing the ROS-sensitive dyes dihydroethidium (DHE) (Invitrogen) or 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCF) (Sigma) in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C. Dishes were once again rinsed with PBS and subsequently exposed to control and test media containing 10% serum and DHE. Some experiments were done in the presence of the superoxide dismutase Mn(III) tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin (MnTBAP) (A. G. Scientific, San Diego, CA) or electron transport chain (ETC) complex III inhibitors stigmatellin, myxothiazol, or antimycin A (Sigma). In some experiments, AML-12 cells were exposed to exogenous H2O2 (25 μm or 1.0 mm) by its addition to the medium. For experiments involving oxidation of PTEN, we chose 1 mm H2O2 as the lowest concentration resulting in nearly maximal oxidation of PTEN when applied to HeLa and NIH 3T3 cells (21Lee S.R. Yang K.S. Kwon J. Lee C. Jeong W. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20336-20342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). Preliminary studies showed this concentration to not be lethal to AML-12 cells. If experiments were extended beyond 15 min, H2O2 was replenished by injection every 15 min to maintain the concentration ≥1 mm. Real time fluorescent images were obtained using a Zeiss 510 META confocal laser-scanning microscope while maintaining dishes at 37 °C. pPTEN Immunofluorescence—AML-12 cells were grown and treated as described above for confocal microscopy with the exception that DAPI and DHE were not included. Cells were treated for 30 min with control and test media and then fixed in situ using 4% paraformaldehyde and washed with 0.2% Triton X-100 followed by PBS. This was followed by incubation at room temperature for 1 h with 3% bovine serum albumin and overnight incubation with the primary pPTEN (Ser380/Thr382/Thr383) antibody (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) at 4 °C, followed by incubation with an anti-rabbit IgG fluorescein isothiocyanate antibody and DAPI. Fluorescence was recorded with green (fluorescein isothiocyanate) and blue (DAPI) filters using an upright LEICA DMR-HC microscope. Western Blot Analysis—Immunoreactive levels of various proteins and phosphoproteins were assessed by Western blot analysis. Cell homogenates containing 10–25 μg of protein were resolved by 7.5–10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred overnight onto nitrocellulose membranes by electrophoresis. Specific primary antibodies to PI 3-kinase p85 subunit, pAkt1 (Ser473), and Akt2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY); Akt, pAkt, PTEN, and pPTEN (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA); and Akt1 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) were used to assess their expression. β-Actin antibodies were used to confirm equal protein loading among samples; these results always showed equal loading and are not shown. The bound primary antibodies were detected with a respective horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution; Amersham Biosciences) and visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence method. Protein expression levels were determined by densitometric analysis. PTEN siRNA—AML-12 cells at 60–75% confluence were transfected with a range of concentrations of small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted against PTEN (target sequence ATC GAT AGC ATT TGC AGT ATA) using HiPerFect transfection reagent and protocol (Qiagen, Cambridge, MA). After 18 h, cells were harvested, and total cellular RNA was purified. The RNA was then reverse transcribed, and the resultant cDNA was used for quantitative real time RT-PCR for PTEN (primers available upon request). In separate experiments, total cellular protein was purified and used to load Western blots as described above. Statistical Analysis—Comparison between groups was performed using Student’s t test for unpaired samples or by analysis of variance. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Treating with MCD or HFFA Medium Produces Hepatocyte Steatosis—Treating cultured AML-12 hepatocytes with MCD or HFFA medium for 18 h resulted in steatosis, as demonstrated by Oil-Red O staining (Fig. 1A). Average cell triglyceride content was significantly increased from control by treatment for 18 h with MCD (p < 0.05 versus control) and HFFA media (p < 0.01 versus control) (Fig. 1B). Cell viability as determined by trypan blue exclusion was not reduced by incubating with either MCD or HFFA medium for 18 h (data not shown). PI 3-Kinase/Akt Pathway Transduction Is Necessary for Development of Hepatocyte Steatosis during Treatment with MCD or HFFA Medium—We previously demonstrated the activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway in AML-12 cells exposed to MCD medium with maximal activation at 1 h of exposure and that steatosis was prevented by treating cells exposed to MCD medium with LY294002 (12Sahai A. Pan X. Paul R. Malladi P. Kohli R. Whitington P.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291 (-G62): G55Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the present study, Western blot analysis of cell homogenates with specific antibodies against the p85 regulatory subunit and pAkt demonstrated transduction of the PI 3-kinase pathway to a similar degree after 1 h of exposure to either MCD or HFFA medium (Fig. 2A). The isoforms of Akt, Akt1 and Akt2, have distinct roles in regard to growth and glucose homeostasis (27Garofalo R.S. Orena S.J. Rafidi K. Torchia A.J. Stock J.L. Hildebrandt A.L. Coskran T. Black S.C. Brees D.J. Wicks J.R. McNeish J.D. Coleman K.G. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Their relative importance in liver metabolism is not well known. To determine which Akt isoform is involved in this signaling cascade, we used specific Akt1 and Akt2 antibodies to demonstrate that Akt1 is the predominant isoform in AML-12 cells, and thus is the isoform predominantly involved (Fig. 2B). Moreover, expression of pAkt1 increased with exposure to MCD or HFFA medium in parallel with the expression of pAkt (Fig. 2, A and B). Finally, the increase in triglyceride content seen with either treatment at 18 h was reversed by treating cultures with the pharmacologic inhibitor of PI 3-kinase LY294002 (Fig. 2C). Thus, either treatment resulted in activation of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway, cellular steatosis, and reversal of this physiological effect when the PI 3-kinase pathway was inhibited. These data suggest that these conditions of macronutrient deprivation and excess produce steatosis by a mechanism that is dependent upon the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway and predominantly involves the Akt1 isoform. Treating with MCD or HFFA Medium Increases Hepatocyte Superoxide Production—We hypothesized that altered macronutrient input could produce metabolic stress that would stimulate hepatocyte mitochondria to increase ROS production. The ROS-sensitive vital dye DHE was used to detect the production of superoxide in real time using live cell confocal time lapse fluorescence microscopy. Incubating with either MCD or HFFA medium produced marked increases in red DHE fluorescence within 30 min (Fig. 3, A–C) relative to control medium, indicating that either change in nutritional milieu prompted an increase in ROS generation. H2O2 Is Probably Involved as a Signal Molecule in Transduction of the PI 3-Kinase/Akt Pathway—Superoxide is normally consumed in the production of H2O2 by the action of superoxide dismutase, and in contrast to superoxide, H2O2 is readily permeable across the mitochondrial membrane. To determine if H2O2 could be the signal emanating from mitochondria stimulated by nutrient perturbation, cells treated with either MCD or HFFA medium were co-incubated with the exogenous membrane-permeable superoxide dismutase MnTBAP, which hastens the conversion of superoxide to H2O2. Treatment with MnTBAP eliminated the increases in DHE fluorescence (Fig. 3D), indicating the rapid elimination of superoxide in the formation of H2O2. However, transduction of the PI 3-kinase pathway was not altered in cells exposed to either MCD or HFFA medium along with the permeable superoxide dismutase mimetic MnTBAP as evidenced by no reduction in expression of p85 and pAkt (Fig. 4, A and B). Thus, signal transduction with either nutrient perturbation was unaffected by the rapid conversion of superoxide to H2O2. The ROS-sensitive vital dye DCF was used to detect the production of H2O2 in real time using live cell confocal time lapse fluorescence microscopy. Incubating with either MCD or HFFA medium produced marked increases in green DCF fluorescence within 10 min of exposure (Fig. 4C) relative to control medium and similar to cells exposed to exogenous H2O2, indicating that either change in nutritional milieu prompted an increase in H2O2 production. The H2O2 appeared to be distributed throughout the cytoplasm of the cells, as evidenced by the distribution of fluorescence (Fig. 4C), and persisted for at least 30 min after exposure, when experiments were terminated (data not shown). Cells grown in control medium with inclusion of H2O2 demonstrated an increase in p85 and pAkt expression to a similar degree as with nutrient perturbation (Fig. 4D). These data show that accelerating the conversion of superoxide to H2O2 does not reduce the effect of nutrient change on PI 3-kinase activation, H2O2 is rapidly generated and distributed to the cytoplasmic compartment with either nutrient change, and H2O2 can initiate transduction of the PI 3-kinase pathway independent of nutrient perturbation. Mitochondria Are the Source of Increased Superoxide Production Seen with MCD or HFFA Medium—Complexes I and III of the mitochondrial ETC leak superoxide anions during normal respiration. Superoxide is specifically produced in large part by complex III of the mitochondrial ETC. To confirm complex III as the source of superoxide production during acute nutrient perturbation, cells exposed to either MDC or HFFA medium were treated with specific ETC complex III inhibitors stigmatellin and myxothiazol, both of which decrease mitochondrial superoxide production. As expected, the increase in DHE fluorescence with HFFA exposure was abrogated by treatment with either compound (Fig. 5, A–C). Similarly, treatment with either compound eliminated the increase in DHE fluorescence with exposure to MCD medium (data not shown). Moreover, both ETC complex III inhibitors eliminated the increased expressions of p85 and pAkt that were produced by either nutrient perturbation alone (Fig. 5, D–F). Antimycin A is a complex III inhibitor that paradoxically increases superoxide production (28Vankoningsloo S. De Pauw A. Houbion A. Tejerina S. Demazy C. de Longueville F. Bertholet V. Renard P. Remacle J. Holvoet P. Raes M. Arnould T. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1266-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Treating AML-12 cells in control medium with antimycin A for 30 min increased DHE fluorescence (Fig. 6A) and produced a dose-dependent increase in p85 and pAkt expression to a similar degree as nutrient perturbation (Fig. 6C). To determine whether the increased ROS production induced by treatment with antimycin A could produce steatosis in the absence of nutrient perturbation, AML-12 cells grown in control medium were exposed to very low dose (10–20 nm) antimycin A (necessary because of its toxicity at higher dose) for 5 days, which resulted in steatosis (Fig. 6B). Taken together, these data indicate the source of increased superoxide production resulting from changes in nutrient input to be largely complex III of the ETC. PTEN Is Inactivated during Nutrient Perturbation, Leading to Positive Modulation of the PI 3-Kinase/Akt Pathway—PTEN is a lipid phosphatase naturally involved in inhibiting the PI 3-kinase pathway by degrading PIP3. PTEN is constitutively phosphorylated, and failure to dephosphorylate it leaves it inactive and unable to effectively degrade PIP3 (24Vazquez F. Grossman S.R. Takahashi Y. Rokas M.V. Nakamura N.

The molecular events governing this process are poorly understood. Here, we studied the regulation of the macrophage-specific chitotriosidase (CHIT1) gene promoter to gain insights into the mechanisms of transcriptional control during the differentiation of human blood monocytes into macrophages. We used transient transfections to define a cell type-specific minimal promoter that was mainly dependent on a proximal C/EBP motif that bound multiple C/EBP factors in gel shift assays. In depth analysis of occupied promoter elements using in vivo footprinting and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated the differentiation-associated recruitment of C/EBPβ and PU.1 at the proximal promoter in parallel with CHIT1 mRNA induction. Notably, the induction of C/EBPβ promoter binding strongly correlated with increased nuclear levels of Thr-235-phosphorylated C/EBPβ protein during the differentiation process, whereas C/EBPβ mRNA and total protein expression remained relatively stable. Our data suggest an important constitutive gene regulatory function for C/EBPβ in differentiated macrophages but not in human blood monocytes.

Our data suggest an important constitutive gene regulatory function for C/EBPβ in differentiated macrophages but not in human blood monocytes. Peripheral blood monocytes are able to differentiate into morphologically and functionally divergent effector cells, including macrophages, myeloid dendritic cells, and osteoclasts (1Hume D.A. Ross I.L. Himes S.R. Sasmono R.T. Wells C.A. Ravasi T. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 72: 621-627PubMed Google Scholar). These cell types together with their bone marrow progenitors constitute the mononuclear phagocyte system, a widely used model to study cellular differentiation, lineage commitment, and mechanisms of cell type-specific gene regulation. Extensive research during the last two decades revealed several transcription factors that are important for lineage commitment and subsequent differentiation of myeloid progenitor cells as well as myeloid-specific gene regulation. These include members of the Ets-, CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) 2The abbreviations used are: C/EBP, CCAAT enhancer-binding protein; CSF-1, colony-stimulating factor 1; DMS, dimethyl sulfate; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; LAP, liver-activating protein; LIP, liver-inhibitory protein; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase.2The abbreviations used are: C/EBP, CCAAT enhancer-binding protein; CSF-1, colony-stimulating factor 1; DMS, dimethyl sulfate; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; LAP, liver-activating protein; LIP, liver-inhibitory protein; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase., and core binding factor (CBF) families and several other transcription factors (2Friedman A.D.

In particular the Ets family transcription factor PU.1 and C/EBP family members C/EBPα and C/EBPβ represent master regulators of the myeloid lineage.

In humans, the differentiation process of progenitor cells into monocyte/macrophage-like cells has been studied mainly using myeloid progenitor cell lines like HL-60, U937, and THP-1, which acquire monocyte/macrophage-like phenotypes upon vitamin D3 or phorbol ester treatment (10Koeffler H.P. Semin. Hematol. 1986; 23: 223-236PubMed Google Scholar). However, the above cell lines, treated or untreated, differ from primary macrophages (11Kohro T. Tanaka T. Murakami T. Wada Y. Aburatani H. Hamakubo T. Kodama T. J. Atheroscler. Thromb. 2004; 11: 88-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and are not necessarily well suited to investigate the transition of primary monocytes into macrophages, which generally proceeds in the absence of DNA synthesis (12Andreesen R. Picht J. Lohr G.W. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 56: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). It is clear that the acquisition of a mature macrophage phenotype is distinct from monocytic lineage commitment. It requires expression of a new set of genes, which in turn must be regulated by a macrophage-associated yet poorly characterized network of transcription factors. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms of monocyte to macrophage differentiation, our laboratory investigates the regulation of genes that are specifically up-regulated during the differentiation of primary human blood monocytes into macrophages in vitro (13Krause S.W.

Because of their binding specificities, both genes have been implicated in innate immunity and may play a role in defense against chitin-containing pathogens (24Bleau G. Massicotte F. Merlen Y. Boisvert C. EXS (Basel). 1999; 87: 211-221PubMed Google Scholar). Chitotriosidase, the product of the human CHIT1 gene, is an active chitinase and was shown to inhibit hyphal growth of chitin-containing fungi (25van Eijk M. van Roomen C.P. Renkema G.H. Bussink A.P.

Under normal conditions expression of CHIT1 is prominent in human alveolar macrophages, suggesting that the up-regulation of this gene is part of the normal macrophage differentiation program in the human lung (30Boot R.G. Bussink A.P. Verhoek M. de Boer P.A. Moorman A.F. Aerts J.M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2005; 53: 1283-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). High levels of CHIT1 transcription were also detected in lipid-laden macrophages accumulated in various organs during Gaucher disease (32Boven L.A. van Meurs M. Boot R.G. Mehta A. Boon L. Aerts J.M. Laman J.D. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 2004; 122: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), subsets of macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques (20Boot R.G. van Achterberg T.A. van Aken B.E.

Biol. 1999; 19: 687-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), and in Kupffer cells from patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (33Malaguarnera L. Di Rosa M. Zambito A.M. dell'Ombra N. Nicoletti F. Malaguarnera M. Gut. 2006; 55: 1313-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), suggesting that lipid mediators may play a role in regulating macrophage CHIT1 induction. The similar expression profile in human monocyte-derived macrophages in conjunction with their close proximity on chromosome 1 suggests common regulatory mechanisms for both chitinase family genes. Understanding the regulation of model genes like CHIT1 and CHI3L1 on the molecular level may significantly enhance our knowledge of macrophage specific gene regulatory networks. We recently performed a thorough analysis of the CHI3L1 promoter in macrophages revealing a major role for Sp1-family proteins at this promoter (31Rehli M. Niller H.H. Ammon C. Langmann S. Schwarzfischer L. Andreesen R. Krause S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44058-44067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The current study investigates the structure and regulation of the proximal CHIT1 promoter as well as the binding and recruitment of transcription factors at the proximal promoter region of CHIT1 during monocyte to macrophage differentiation. We show that the differentiation-associated CHIT1 induction is accompanied by the binding of transcription factor PU.1 and, most strikingly, of C/EBPβ to the proximal CHIT1 gene promoter. Whereas C/EBPβ total mRNA or protein levels remain largely unchanged, we also show that C/EBPβ recruitment to its target gene promoter is preceded by an increase in phosphorylation of nuclear C/EBPβ during the differentiation process. Chemicals—All chemical reagents were purchased form Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise noted. Protease inhibitors and enzymes were obtained from Roche Applied Science unless otherwise noted. Kinase inhibitors LY294002 and GW2580 were obtained from Calbiochem. U0126 was purchased from Promega (Mannheim, Germany). Standard oligonucleotides were synthesized by Operon Biotechnologies GmbH (Cologne, Germany). High performance liquid chromatography-purified oligonucleotides were obtained by Metabion (Planegg-Martinsried, Germany). Sequences are given in supplemental Table 1. DNA sequencing was done by Geneart (Regensburg, Germany). Cells—Peripheral blood monocytes were separated by leukapheresis of healthy donors followed by density gradient centrifugation over Ficoll/Hypaque and subsequent counter current centrifugal elutriation in a J6M-E centrifuge (Beckman Instruments) as previously described (13Krause S.W. Rehli M. Kreutz M. Schwarzfischer L. Paulauskis J.D. Andreesen R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 540-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Monocytes were >85% pure as determined by morphology and expression of CD14 antigen. Supernatants of monocyte cultures were routinely collected and analyzed for the presence interleukin-6, which was usually low, indicating that monocytes were not activated before or during culture. To generate macrophages, isolated monocytes were cultured in endotoxin-free RPMI 1640 medium (Biochrom KG, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with vitamins, antibiotics, pyruvate, nonessential amino acids (all from Invitrogen), 5 × 10-8 m β-mercaptoethanol, and 2% human pooled AB-group serum on Teflon foils or Petri dishes for up to 11 days. For non-adherent cultures, monocytes were cultured in roller bottles in the presence of 100 ng/ml human CSF-1 (Chiron). Kinase inhibitors GW2580 (10 μm), LY294002 (100 μm), and U0126 (10 μm) were added after 2 or 3 days of culture as indicated. Viability of cells was analyzed by trypan blue exclusion. The human monocytic cell line THP-1 was grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). The human cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa and the human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cell line HepG2 were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) plus 10% fetal calf serum. RNA Preparation—Total RNA was isolated from different cell types by the guanidine thiocyanate/acid phenol method (34Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62899) Google Scholar) or using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). RNA Ligase-mediated RACE-PCR—Ten μg of total RNA from monocyte-derived macrophages (d7) were used for cDNA synthesis with the FirstChoice™ RLM-RACE kit (Ambion Cambridgeshire, UK). Primers CHIT1-OUT and CHIT1-IN (sequences are given in supplemental Table 1) were used to amplify full-length 5′-cDNA fragments. PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (TOPO cloning kit, Invitrogen), and inserts from several individual plasmid-containing bacterial colonies were sequenced. Real-time Reverse Transcription PCR—RNA (2.5 μg) was treated with DNA-free™ DNase (Ambion). One μg of DNase-treated RNA was reverse-transcribed using Superscript II MMLV-RT (Promega). Real-time PCR was performed on a LightCycler system (Roche Applied Science) using the Quanti-Tect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers are given in supplemental Table 1. Melting curves were analyzed to control for specificity of the PCR reactions. Expression data for CHIT1, CHI3L1, CEBPA, CEBPB, and CEBPD genes were normalized for expression of the ACTB or HPRT gene as indicated. The relative units were calculated from a standard curve plotting three different concentrations of log dilutions against the PCR cycle number at which the measured fluorescence intensity reached a fixed value. For each sample, data of two donors (two independent runs each) were averaged. Plasmid Construction and Purification—Cloning of the proximal promoter region of the CHIT1 gene was originally performed using the Promoter Finder DNA Walking kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and primers CHIT1-R1 and CHIT1-R2 following the manufacturer's recommendations. The ∼1550-bp product obtained from the SspI library was cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (TOPO Cloning kit, Invitrogen), sequenced, and subcloned (as HindIII/XhoI fragment) into pGL3 basic to obtain the CHIT1–1503 construct. Deletions were done by restriction digestion (CHIT1–419, NheI/XbaI; CHIT1–357, PvuI/SmaI) and subsequent religation or by PCR using CHIT1–1503 construct and primer CHIT1–247, CHIT1–149, or CHIT1–76 with primer GL2 and subsequent cloning into pGL3 basic. Mutation of putative binding sites was done by PCR-mediated mutagenesis using primers CHIT1-mutCEBP or CHIT1-mutGC with primer GL2. PCR fragments with correctly introduced alterations were subcloned back into pGL3 basic. Primer sequences are given in supplemental Table 1. Expression plasmids for human C/EBP-family proteins were a gift from Dr. Alan Friedman. For transient transfections, plasmids were isolated and purified using the EndoFree plasmid kit from Qiagen. Transient DNA Transfections—THP-1 and HeLa cells were transfected as described earlier (35Rehli M. Poltorak A. Schwarzfischer L. Krause S.W. Andreesen R. Beutler B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9773-9781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). HepG2 were transfected in 12-well tissue culture plates using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) and 1.5 μg of total DNA (1 μg of reporter plasmid, 0.5 or 0.1 μg of individual expression plasmids, 0.4 μg of empty expression plasmid, if required, and 0.05 μg of Renilla control vector) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Triplicate transfections were harvested after 24 h. Cell lysates were assayed for firefly and Renilla luciferase activities using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega) on a Lumat LB9501 (Berthold, Bad Wildbach, Germany). Firefly luciferase activity of individual transfections was normalized against Renilla luciferase activity. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts from in vitro differentiated human macrophages or THP-1 cells were prepared using Nonidet P-40 lysis as described (36Ross I.L. Yue X. Ostrowski M.C. Hume D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6662-6669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the proximal C/EBP site (pCEBP_S and AS) were annealed and end-labeled with α-[32P]dCTP using Klenow DNA polymerase. Sequences of competitors and mutated oligonucleotides are listed in supplemental Table 1. Antisera used in supershift analyses were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Heidelberg, Germany). Gels were fixed, dried, and imaged using storage phosphor screens and a 9200 Typhoon scanner (GE Healthcare). In Vivo Genomic Footprinting with DMS—In vivo DMS footprinting was performed as described previously (37Tagoh H. Cockerill P.N. Bonifer C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 325: 285-314PubMed Google Scholar) using 1.5 μg of genomic DNA from DMS-treated cells. In vitro DMS treatment of naked DNA was performed essentially as described by Maxam and Gilbert (38Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (8987) Google Scholar). Ligation-mediated PCR was carried out using a LP21–25 linker and Bio-CHIT1foot1F, CHIT1foot2F, and CHIT1foot3F. Differences in DMS accessibility were visualized on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel after a labeling reaction with a Cy5-end-labeled linker LP25 primer (Cy5-LP25). Gels were scanned on a 9200 Typhoon scanner (GE Healthcare). Footprinting was performed with cells from two different donors. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Preparation of cross-linked chromatin was performed as described previously (39Metivier R. Penot G. Hubner M.R. Reid G. Brand H. Kos M. Gannon F. Cell. 2003; 115: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, 10 × 106 cells were treated in 1/10th volume of fixation buffer (500 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.9, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EGTA, pH 8.0, 11% formaldehyde) for 10 min at room temperature and quenched by 0.125 m glycine. Cells were resuspended in 250 μl of L1A (10 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.9, 85 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) and lysed in 250 μl of L1B (L1A + 1% Nonidet P-40) for 10 min on ice. Cross-linked chromatin was sheared to an average DNA fragment size around 400–600 bp using a Branson Sonifer 250 (Danbury, CT). After centrifugation, 4 μl of supernatant was used as input. After preclearing with Sepharose CL-4B beads (Sigma) for 2 h, chromatin samples from 2 × 106 cells were immunoprecipitated overnight with 2.5 μg of rabbit polyclonal antibodies anti-C/EBPα, -β, and -δ and anti-PU.1 (sc-61, sc-150, sc-636, and sc-352, respectively, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) or anti-rabbit IgG (Upstate/Millipore GmbH, Schwalbach, Germany). Immunocomplexes were recovered by 2 h of incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) at 4 °C. After reverse cross-linking, DNA was purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Enrichment of specific DNA fragments in the immunoprecipitated material was determined by quantitative PCR on a LightCycler system (Roche Applied Science) using the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers are listed in supplemental Table 1. For each individual primer pair, a standard curve was generated using serial log dilutions of input DNA, and the melting curves for each PCR product were analyzed to control for specificity of the PCR reactions. Western Analysis—Western blotting was performed using either whole cell or nuclear extracts. Whole cell extracts were prepared as follows: 10 × 106 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted, dissolved in 100 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer (20% glycerin, 125 mm Tris buffer, 4% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% bromphenol blue), shaken at 95 °C for 10 min, and vortexed for 1 min. For nuclear extracts, 10 × 106 cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and cell pellets were dissolved in 500 μl of pre-equilibration buffer (1.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 25 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin). After centrifugation at 900 × g for 4 min, cell pellets were dissolved in 300 μl of lysis buffer (pre-equilibration buffer plus 10% Nonidet P-40, 20 mg/ml chymostatin, 3 mg/ml E64, 0.1 mg/ml 1,10-phenanthroline, 5 mg/ml bestatin) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Nuclear pellets were collected and dissolved in 150 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer. For Western blot, an equivalent of 0.1 × 106 cells from whole cell extracts and 1 × 106 from nuclear extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Blots were blocked overnight at 4 °C with 5% milk powder (or 5% bovine serum albumin for the phospho-Thr-235 C/EBPβ antibody), 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline and incubated with antibodies against C/EBPβ (rabbit polyclonal antibody, sc-150, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) diluted 1:200, phospho-Thr-235 C/EBPβ (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA) diluted 1:200, β-actin (Sigma) diluted 1:2000, or TFIID (sc-273, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) diluted 1:1000 overnight. Blots were washed and incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Bio-Rad) diluted 1:3000. Bands were visualized on Hyperfilm (GE Healthcare) using the Immuno-Star Chemiluminescent protein detection system (Bio-Rad), scanned, and analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics personal densitometer (GE Healthcare). Immunofluorescence Staining—Five × 105 monocytes were seeded in chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL)) and cultured for 45 min (monocyte) or 7 days (macrophage). After washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were fixed with cold methanol for 10 min, and blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin, 10% horse serum in 1× phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h. Cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibodies against C/EBPβ (sc-150, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) or phospho-Thr-235 C/EBPβ (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). After washing, cells were incubated for 45 min with secondary antibody fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) or Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) in the dark. Nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and samples were mounted using DAKO fluorescent mounting medium (DAKO, Hamburg, Germany). Images were taken using an Axioskop2 plus fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany). Expression of CHIT1 during Monocytic Differentiation—CHIT1 and CHI3L1 genes are direct neighbors on chromosome 1q32.1. Earlier studies suggested that both CHIT1 and CHI3L1 are strongly up-regulated during late stages of macrophage maturation (13Krause S.W. Rehli M. Kreutz M. Schwarzfischer L. Paulauskis J.D. Andreesen R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 540-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 17Boot R.G. Renkema G.H. Strijland A. van Zonneveld A.J. Aerts J.M. J. Biol.

Cell Res. 1997; 237: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Real-time PCR analysis was performed to compare the expression profile of both genes. As shown in Fig. 1A, both genes are induced more than 10,000-fold during monocytic differentiation. The overall kinetics of mRNA induction appeared very similar; the observed increase in CHIT1 expression showed a slight delay (approximately 1 day) as compared with CHI3L1. The close physical proximity in combination with the similar expression profile suggests common regulatory mechanisms for both genes. THP-1 cells, a well studied myeloid cell line, acquire features of differentiated macrophages when treated with phorbol esters. Although expression levels were comparably low, CHIT1 was also strongly induced in PMA-treated THP-1 cells, suggesting that THP-1 cells may share regulatory mechanisms of CHIT1 induction with primary cells (Fig. 1B). To further investigate the regulation of CHIT1, we studied its expression in monocytes non-adherently cultured in the presence of CSF-1. As shown in Fig. 1C, CSF-1 was sufficient to up-regulate CHIT1 under non-adherent conditions, although the increase was slightly reduced as compared with adherent macrophages. No viable cells were recovered from non-adherent monocyte cultures in the absence of CSF-1. The above data suggested that autocrine (adherence-induced) (40Scheibenbogen C. Andreesen R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1991; 50: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) or paracrine CSF-1 could play a role in CHIT1 regulation. To study the potential role of CSF-1, we cultured adherent monocytes in the presence of GW2580, a potent inhibitor of CSF-1 receptor-mediated signaling. The inhibitor had little effect on CHIT1 induction when added immediately or after 1 day (data not shown) or 2 days of culture (Fig. 1D), suggesting that autocrine CSF-1 plays a minor role in adherently differentiating macrophages. We next tested the effect of inhibitors for kinases MEK (U01026) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (LY294002) on CHIT1 regulation. Because immediate administration of these inhibitors induced massive cell death, they were added on day 2 at the onset of CHIT1 induction, and CHIT1 expressio"

Here we investigate the role for CAPS1 by generating stable cell lines in which CAPS1 is strongly down-regulated. In these cells, Ca2+-dependent secretion was strongly reduced not only of catecholamine but also of a transfected neuropeptide. These secretion defects were rescued by infusion of CAPS1-containing brain cytosol or by transfection-mediated expression of CAPS1. Whole cell patch clamp recording revealed significant reductions in slow burst and sustained release components of exocytosis in the knockdown cells. Unexpectedly, they also accumulated higher amounts of endogenous and exogenous transmitters, which were attributable to reductions in constitutive secretion. Electron microscopy did not reveal abnormalities in the number or docking of dense core vesicles. Our results indicate that CAPS1 plays critical roles not only in Ca2+-dependent, regulated exocytosis but also in constitutive exocytosis downstream of vesicle docking. However, they do not support the role for CAPS1 in loading transmitters into dense core vesicles.

However, they do not support the role for CAPS1 in loading transmitters into dense core vesicles. Catecholamines such as dopamine and noradrenaline are released from secretory vesicles through regulated and constitutive secretory processes. Distinct types of secretory vesicles account for the storage and secretion of different neurotransmitters and peptides/neuromodulators. Synaptic vesicles are responsible for the storage and secretion of classic neurotransmitters such as glutamate, glycine, and γ-aminobutyric acid, whereas dense core vesicles are responsible for the storage and secretion of peptides and catecholamines. Ca2+-dependent activator protein for secretion 1 (CAPS1) 3The abbreviations used are: CAPS1, Ca2+-dependent activator protein for secretion 1; NA, noradrenaline; PSS, physiological saline solution; α-LTx, α-latrotoxin; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CMV, cytomegalovirus; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SNM, silent nucleotide mutation; HPLC, highperformance liquid chromatography; hPLAP, human placental alkaline phosphatase. 3The abbreviations used are: CAPS1, Ca2+-dependent activator protein for secretion 1; NA, noradrenaline; PSS, physiological saline solution; α-LTx, α-latrotoxin; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CMV, cytomegalovirus; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SNM, silent nucleotide mutation; HPLC, highperformance liquid chromatography; hPLAP, human placental alkaline phosphatase. is a 145-kDa protein purified from the brain and found to be a critical cytosolic factor capable of reconstituting secretion of noradrenaline from dense core vesicles in permeabilized PC12 cells (1Walent J.H.

CAPS2 is structurally and functionally similar to CAPS1 but exhibits a different cell/tissue and developmental expression (4Speidel D. Varoqueaux F. Enk C. Nojiri M. Grishanin R.N. Martin T.F.

Neuron. 2001; 31: 421-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In C. elegans, the orthologue of CAPS1 was discovered as unc-31, because the C. elegans with unc-31 gene mutations displays locomotion defects (7Avery L. Bargmann C.I. Horvitz H.R. Genetics. 1993; 134: 455-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). unc-31 mutants were also isolated in the screening of mutants resistant to aldicarb, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, suggesting that Unc-31 is involved in acetylcholine metabolism or secretion (11Miller K.G. Alfonso A. Nguyen M. Crowell J.A. Johnson C.D. Rand J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12593-12598Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). In addition, unc-31 mutants appeared to exhibit higher accumulation of serotonin in hermaphrodite-specific motor neurons (12Desai C. Garriga G. McIntire S.L. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1988; 336: 638-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, deletion of CAPS caused a 50% decrease in glutamatergic transmission at the neuromuscular junctions, but this reduction was not rescued by expression of CAPS in neurons (9Renden R.

Overall, these results suggest the involvement of CAPS1 in secretory processes. The exact function of CAPS1, however, remains unclear. The functional analyses of CAPS1 in mammalian secretory cells had been limited. Two studies showed that injection of anti-CAPS antibody inhibit exocytosis in single chromaffin cells (13Elhamdani A. Martin T.F. Kowalchyk J.A. Artalejo C.R. J. Neurosci. 2000; 19: 7375-7383Crossref Google Scholar) and melanotrophs (14Rupnik M. Kreft M. Sikdar S.K. Grilc S. Romih R. Zupancic G. Martin T.F. Zorec R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5627-5632Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), indicating that CAPS1 is required for a late phase of dense core vesicle exocytosis. Other studies demonstrated that recombinant CAPS proteins expressed in COS cells restore secretion from populations of permeabilized PC12 cells (2Ann K. Kowalchyk J.A. Loyet K.M. Martin T.F. J. Biol.

Bruederle C.E. Enk C. Voets T. Varoqueaux F. Reim K. Becherer U. Fornai F. Ruggieri S. Holighaus Y. Weihe E. Bruns D. Brose N. Rettig J.

However, homozygous mutant mice died within 30 min after birth, and, therefore, detailed analyses of the roles of CAPS1 in adult neurons and neuroendocrine cells were not feasible. Nonetheless, an initial analysis of the CAPS1-deficient embryonic chromaffin cells unexpectedly showed that CAPS1 is primarily involved in loading or maintenance of catecholamines in dense core vesicles, a secretory event upstream from the exocytic steps per se (16Speidel D.

Although these results on the CAPS1 knock-out mice are interesting, they do not provide a satisfactory explanation for the earlier reports of CAPS1 actions in stimulating catecholamine secretion in permeabilized PC12 cells (1Walent J.H.

Furthermore, the conclusion from this report is inconsistent with those derived from C. elegans unc-31 mutant studies, which demonstrated defective secretory phenotypes (accumulation of neurotransmitter serotonin in neurons (12Desai C. Garriga G. McIntire S.L. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1988; 336: 638-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) and resistance to aldicarb (11Miller K.G. Alfonso A. Nguyen M. Crowell J.A. Johnson C.D. Rand J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12593-12598Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar)). This apparent inconsistency in the CAPS1 knock-out mouse study may in part be explained by the fact that, at the embryonic stage of development, CAPS2 is expressed at higher levels than CAPS1 in the adrenal glands (16Speidel D. Bruederle C.E. Enk C. Voets T. Varoqueaux F. Reim K. Becherer U. Fornai F. Ruggieri S. Holighaus Y. Weihe E. Bruns D. Brose N. Rettig J. Neuron. 2005; 46: 75-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and could conceivably exhibit some confounding functional redundancy to CAPS1. In contrast, adult adrenal medullary chromaffin cells do not express CAPS2 at a detectable level (4Speidel D. Varoqueaux F. Enk C. Nojiri M. Grishanin R.N. Martin T.F. Hofmann K. Brose N. Reim K. J.

Neurol. 2006; 495: 735-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Indeed, the phenotypes of adult chromaffin cells from CAPS1 heterozygous mouse were apparently different from those of the CAPS1-deficient embryonic cells. They showed reductions in exocytosis and in docking of dense core vesicles but did not exhibit deficits in the loading of catecholamines into vesicles (16Speidel D. Bruederle C.E. Enk C. Voets T. Varoqueaux F. Reim K. Becherer U. Fornai F. Ruggieri S. Holighaus Y. Weihe E. Bruns D. Brose N. Rettig J. Neuron. 2005; 46: 75-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, the lack of defects in catecholamine loading in the adult heterozygous cells is easily attributable to the presence of residual (50% of the wild-type) CAPS1 in these cells. Thus, it remains unclear whether CAPS1 is critical for loading (or maintenance) of catecholamines into dense core vesicles or for exocytosis from dense core vesicles in intact mammalian cells. In the current study, we have sought to identify the precise function of CAPS1 in intact mammalian cells by employing the strategy of generating stable PC12 cell lines in which CAPS1 is strongly down-regulated. CAPS2 is not expressed at a detectable level in PC12 cells, as is the case with adult chromaffin cells (4Speidel D. Varoqueaux F. Enk C. Nojiri M. Grishanin R.N. Martin T.F. Hofmann K. Brose N.

Neurol. 2006; 495: 735-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). From the analysis of these knockdown cells and the rescue of this loss of CAPS1 function, we strongly suggest that the primary function of CAPS1 is for the secretion of transmitters per se and not for loading of catecholamine into dense core vesicles. We also suggest that CAPS1 is critical not only for regulated exocytosis as previously suggested but also for constitutive exocytosis. General Materials—We obtained monoclonal antibodies against CAPS1 from BD Bioscience (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), syntaxin1 (clone HPC-1) from Sigma (Oakville, Ontario, Canada), and SNAP-25 (clone SMI 81) from Covance (Berkeley, CA); polyclonal antibodies against secretogranin II from QED Bioscience (San Diego, CA). Monoclonal antibody against synaptobrevin2 (Cl69.1) and synaptotagmin1 (Cl41.1) were kind gifts from Dr. Reinhard Jahn (Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Germany). Plasmid pVenus-N1-NPY (17Nagai T. Ibata K. Park E.S. Kubota M. Mikoshiba K. Miyawaki A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (2178) Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Dr. Atsushi Miyawaki (RIKEN, Wako, Saitama, Japan). Construction of CAPS1 Knockdown Plasmids—To knockdown the rat CAPS1 gene, we targeted the 19-nucleotide sequence of (residues 464-482, GGACCGATTCCAGGCTTTC) in rat CAPS1. We used TTCAAGAGA as a linker sequence (18Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3963) Google Scholar, 19Li G. Han L. Chou T.C. Fujita Y. Arunachalam L. Xu A. Wong A. Chiew S.K. Wan Q. Wang L. Sugita S. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 190-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). 64-bp oligonucleotides containing sense and antisense of the target sequences were annealed and subcloned into the BamHI-HindIII sites of pSuper, generating the CAPS1 knockdown plasmid (pSuper-rCAPS1-3). Inserted sequences were verified by sequencing. Isolation of Stable CAPS1 Knockdown PC12 Cells—Wildtype PC12 cells (which were kind gifts from Dr. Thomas Martin, University of Wisconsin and Dr. Erik Schweitzer, University of California at Los Angeles) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) containing 5% calf serum, 5% horse serum (both from HyClone, Logan, UT), and penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma). To establish the CAPS1-knockdown clone cells, PC12 cells were co-transfected with non-linearized pSuper-rCAPS1-3 (10 μg) and pBabe-puro (1 μg) by electroporation (19Li G. Han L. Chou T.C. Fujita Y. Arunachalam L. Xu A. Wong A. Chiew S.K. Wan Q. Wang L. Sugita S. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 190-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We conducted two independent transfections to isolate knockdown clones and control clones. This is to ensure that the phenotypes observed are independent of screening artifacts. Transfected cells were maintained in growth medium containing 2.5 μg/ml puromycin for more than a month. The growing colonies were picked up with pieces of Whatman paper soaked with Hanks’ buffer containing 1 mm EDTA. Isolated colonies were grown in the growth medium without puromycin in 24-well plates. When the cells became confluent, they were transferred into 2 wells of 6-well plates that contained the growth medium with 2.5 μg/ml puromycin. The cells in one of the 6-well plates were subjected to immunoblot analysis using an anti-CAPS1 monoclonal antibody. Once the down-regulation of CAPS1 was confirmed, the cells in the replica wells were transferred into 10-cm dishes containing growth medium with puromycin. These cells were grown, frozen, and kept in a liquid nitrogen tank until use. [3H]Noradrenaline Release Assays from PC12 Cells—PC12 cells were plated in 24-well plates; 3-4 days after plating, the cells were labeled with 0.5 μCi of [3H]NA (GE Healthcare, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) in the presence of 0.5 mm ascorbic acid for 12-16 h. The labeled PC12 cells were incubated with the fresh complete Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium for 1-5 h to remove unincorporated [3H]NA. The cells were washed once with physiological saline solution (PSS) containing 145 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, and 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and NA secretion was stimulated with 200 μl of PSS, High K+-PSS (containing 81 mm NaCl and 70 mm KCl), or PSS containing 3 nm of α-latrotoxin (α-LTx, Alomone Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel). Secretion was terminated after a 15-min (High K+) or 10-min (α-LTx) incubation at 37 °C by chilling to 0 °C, and samples were centrifuged at 4 °C for 3 min. Supernatants were removed, and the pellets were solubilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for liquid scintillation counting. [3H]NA Release Assays Using Permeabilized PC12 Cells—PC12 cells were labeled with 0.5 μCi of [3H]NA in the presence of 0.5 mm ascorbic acid. After washing, the cells were harvested in KGlu buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.1, 120 mm potassium glutamate, 20 mm potassium acetate, and 2 mm EGTA) with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), mechanically permeabilized (1Walent J.H.

Permeabilized PC12 cells were washed three times with KGlu buffer containing 0.1% BSA. Ca2+-dependent secretion assays were performed in KGlu buffer with 0.07% BSA, 2 mm MgATP, with or without 1 mg/ml brain cytosol, and with or without 1.72 mm CaCl2 for 20 min at 30 °C. 1.72 mm CaCl2 in KGlu buffer, which contains 2 mm EGTA, produced ∼1-3 μm free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]free) (21Chen Y.A.

The supernatant were removed, and the pellets were solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 for liquid scintillation counting. NPY-hPLAP Secretion Assay from PC12 Cells—To measure peptide secretion, we used a plasmid (pCMV-NPY-hLAP) that enables the expression of neuropeptide-Y fused with a soluble domain of human placental alkaline phosphatase (residues 18-506) (19Li G. Han L. Chou T.C. Fujita Y. Arunachalam L. Xu A. Wong A. Chiew S.K. Wan Q. Wang L. Sugita S. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 190-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). CAPS1 knockdown and control cells at 70-80% confluency in 10-cm dishes were transfected with 3 μg of pCMV-hPLAP by electroporation. After 48 h, the cells were harvested and re-plated onto 24-well plates. 6 or 7 days after electroporation, the plated cells were washed once with PSS, and NPY-hPLAP secretion was stimulated with 200 μl of PSS or high K+ (70 mm KCl)-PSS. Secretion was terminated after a 25-min incubation at 37 °C by chilling to 0 °C, and samples were centrifuged at 4 °C for 3 min. Supernatants were removed, and the pellets were solubilized in 200 μl of PSS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The amounts of NPY-hPLAP secreted into the medium and retained in the cells were measured by the Phospha-Light Reporter Gene Assay System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). We treated the samples at 65 °C for 30 min to inactivate non-placental alkaline phosphatases and assayed an aliquot (10 μl) for placental alkaline phosphatase activity with the kit. The total volume of the assay was 120 μl. After 5-10 min, chemiluminescence was quantified by using an FB12 luminometer (Berthold Detection Systems, Zylux Corp., Oak Ridge, TN). Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy to Examine the Localization of the Transfected Peptide—Sterilized circular glass coverslips (0.25-mm width and 1.8-cm diameter) were placed in 2.2-cm wells within 12-well cell culture plates. The coverslips were then coated for 1 h with poly-d-lysine (0.1 mg/ml) at room temperature. Both CAPS1 knockdown and control PC12 cells that were electroporated with pVenus-N1-NPY (10 μg) were split onto the coated glass coverslips within each well. Cells were allowed to adhere to the coverslips overnight. The PC12 cells were differentiated on the coverslips for 3-4 days in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, which contained 100 ng/ml NGF (Sigma), 1% horse serum, 1% calf serum, and penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed for 15 min with PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 0.3% BSA for 5 min. Nonspecific sites were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in PBS containing 0.3% BSA. Primary antibodies against secretogranin II (rabbit polyclonal antiserum diluted 1:1000) were diluted in blocking buffer and applied to the permeabilized cells for 1 h at room temperature. Following three washes in blocking buffer, Alexa 568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (diluted 1:1000, Invitrogen) were diluted in blocking buffer and applied for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were washed again three times in blocking buffer and mounted in Fluoromount-G reagent (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL). Immunofluorescence staining was recorded with a Zeiss laser confocal scanning microscope (LSM 510) with an oil immersion objective lens (63×). CAPS1 Expression Construct for the Rescue Experiments—We used mouse CAPS1 cDNA (mKIAA1121, kind gift from Dr. Takahiro Nagase, Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Japan) to generate the expression construct for CAPS1. A 5.4-kb MunI/BamHI fragment from mKIAA1121 clone was subcloned into EcoRI/BamHI site of pCMV5 generating pCMV-mCAPS1-1. mKIAA1121 encodes a long-splice form of CAPS1. To generate a short-splice form (a more common form) of CAPS1 (2Ann K. Kowalchyk J.A. Loyet K.M. Martin T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19637-19640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), we conducted PCR and generated pCMV-mCAPS1-2. Mouse cDNA (AGACCGGTTCCAGGCTTTT) differs from rat cDNA (GGACCGATTCCAGGCTTTC) within the knockdown sequence in three bases (indicated by italics). To further protect the mRNA transcripts transcribed from the mouse CAPS1 expression plasmid from being degraded by the anti-CAPS1 RNA interference machineries already induced within the CAPS1 knockdown cells, we introduced three additional silent nucleotide mutations (SNMs) (AGACCGCTTTCAAGCTTTT, underlining indicates SNM) within the target sequence in the CAPS1 gene. But the mutation from G to C is to remove the AgeI site but not to increase silent mutations. The resulting mouse CAPS1 sequence in the expression plasmid (pCMV-mCAPS1(SNM)-2) differs from the rat CAPS1 sequence by five bases (all are SNMs) within the knockdown sequence. Photolysis of Caged Ca2+ and Cm Measurements—Patch electrodes were pulled from 1.5-mm thin-walled borosilicate glass, coated close to the tip with orthodontic wax (Butler, Guelph, Ontario, Canada), and polished to a tip resistance of 2-4 megohms when filled with intracellular solution. Standard bath solution for the experiments contained (in mm): 138 NaCl, 5.6 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 2.6 CaCl2, 5 glucose, 5 Hepes (pH 7.4 with NaOH). Intracellular solution for flash experiments (in mm): 112 Cs-glutamate, 5 NP-EGTA, 3.7 CaCl2, 2 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na2-GTP, and 0.2 fura-6F (pH 7.2 with CsOH). NP-EGTA and fura-6F were purchased from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen). Cm was measured using an EPC-10 patch clamp amplifier (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany) controlled by the lock-in module of PULSE software. The capacitance traces were imported to IGOR Pro (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR) for analysis. Flashes of UV light and fluorescence-excitation light were generated as described previously (24Xu T. Binz T. Niemann H. Neher E. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In the flash experiments, exocytosis was elicited by photorelease of caged Ca2+ preloaded into the cell via the patch pipette. [Ca2+]i was measured with the Ca2+ indicator dyes fura-2 or fura-6F. [Ca2+]i was determined from the ratio (R) of the fluorescence signals excited at the two wavelengths (340/380 nm), following the equation (23Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), [Ca2+]i = Keff*(R - Rmin)/(Rmax - R), where Keff, Rmin, and Rmax are constants obtained from intracellular calibration as previously described (24Xu T. Binz T. Niemann H. Neher E. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Measurements of Endogenous Catecholamines from PC12 Cells by HPLC—The measurement of the concentrations of catecholamines was measured using an HPLC system consisting of a delivery pump (Model HP1100, Agilent), a reversedphase analytical column (Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C8, 150 × 4.6 mm i.d., 5 μm, Agilent), degasser, and a fluorescence detector. We followed the method developed by Lakshmana and Raju (25Lakshmana M.K. Raju T.R. Biochem. 1997; 246: 166-170Google Scholar), which used an isocratic assay without derivatization. The mobile phase consisted of sodium acetate (0.02 m), methanol (16%), heptane sulfonic acid (0.055%), EDTA (0.2 mm), and dibutylamine (0.01%, v/v). The solution was adjusted to pH 3.92 with o-phosphoric acid. The flow rate was set to 0.9 ml/min. As a standard, noradrenaline, adrenaline, and dopamine were dissolved in 0.1 m PCA at the concentration of 250 ng/ml for each, and the volume of injection was set to 10 μl. The good detection and separation of these compounds were first established at 2.5 ng/10-μl sample volume. We then measured the concentrations of catecholamines in PC12 cells from 10-cm dishes. PC12 cells were harvested in 1 ml of Hanks’ buffer with 1 mm EDTA, and supplemented with 9 ml of the growth medium. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation, washed once with 1 ml of physiological saline solution, and homogenized in 200 μl of 0.1 m PCA. Insoluble materials were removed by three centrifugations, and 10 μl of the cleared solution was applied to HPLC. We detected the clear peak of noradrenaline (in the range of 2.0 to 40 ng/10-μl sample volume) and dopamine (in the range of 20 to 160 ng/10-μl sample volume). This result confirms that the primary catecholamine in PC12 cells is dopamine and the second most abundant catecholamine is noradrenaline (26Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4854) Google Scholar). The concentrations of these catecholamines were normalized by the total protein concentrations (in the range of 10 to 30 μg/10-μl sample volume) of each sample of PC12 cells. The total protein concentration was measured by using the Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Measurements of Constitutive Secretion of NPY-hPLAP from PC12 Cells—CAPS1 knockdown and control cells at 70-80% confluency in 10-cm dishes were transfected with 3 μg of pCMV-hPLAP using electroporation. After 48 h, the cells were harvested and re-plated in 300 μl of complete growth medium in 24-well plates. Supernatants were removed, and the cells were solubilized in 300 μl of complete growth medium containing 0.1% Triton X-100 every 24 h. The amounts of NPY-hPLAP secreted into the me"
https://openalex.org/W2044477586,"Factor VII-activating protease (FSAP) is a novel plasma-derived serine protease structurally homologous to tissue-type and urokinase-type plasminogen activators. We demonstrate that plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), the predominant inhibitor of tissue-type and urokinase-type plasminogen activators in plasma and tissues, is an inhibitor of FSAP as well. We detected PAI-1·FSAP complexes in addition to high levels of extracellular RNA, an important FSAP cofactor, in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Hydrolytic activity of FSAP was inhibited by PAI-1 with a second-order inhibition rate constant (Ka) of 3.38 ± 1.12 × 105 m–1·s–1. Residue Arg346 was a critical recognition element on PAI-1 for interaction with FSAP. RNA, but not DNA, fragments (>400 nucleotides in length) dramatically enhanced the reactivity of PAI-1 with FSAP, and 4 μg·ml–1 RNA increased the Ka to 1.61 ± 0.94 × 106 m–1·s–1. RNA also stabilized the active conformation of PAI-1, increasing the half-life for spontaneous conversion of active to latent PAI-1 from 48.4 ± 8 min to 114.6 ± 5 min. In contrast, little effect of DNA on PAI-1 stability was apparent. Residues Arg76 and Lys80 in PAI-1 were key elements mediating binding of nucleic acids to PAI-1. FSAP-driven inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation was antagonized by PAI-1, suggesting functional consequences for the FSAP-PAI-1 interaction. These data indicate that extracellular RNA and PAI-1 can regulate FSAP activity, thereby playing a potentially important role in hemostasis and cell functions under various pathophysiological conditions, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Two-chain FSAP consists of a 46-kDa heavy chain connected by a disulfide bridge to a 29-kDa light chain containing the catalytic domain (5Kannemeier C. Feussner A. Stoehr H.A. Preissner K.T.

Autoactivation of scFSAP to tcFSAP is promoted in the presence of negatively charged substances, such as heparin, dextran sulfate, phosphatidylethanolamine, or extracellular RNA (5Kannemeier C.

Biochem. J. 2005; 385: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The role of FSAP in different physiological and pathophysiological conditions is not fully understood. A dual role for FSAP in vitro in hemostasis has been suggested (3Roemisch J. Feussner A. Vermoehlen S. Stoehr H.A. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1999; 10: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 9Roemisch J. Vermoehlen S. Feussner A. Stoehr H.A. Haemostasis. 1999; 29: 292-299PubMed Google Scholar). FSAP is a potent activator of coagulation factor VII, thus contributing to the initiation of blood coagulation via the extrinsic pathway (3Roemisch J. Feussner A. Vermoehlen S. Stoehr H.A. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1999; 10: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Furthermore, FSAP also activates prourokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and thus contributes to plasminogen activation as well (9Roemisch J. Vermoehlen S. Feussner A. Stoehr H.A. Haemostasis. 1999; 29: 292-299PubMed Google Scholar). Additional links between FSAP and the plasminogen activation system exist; FSAP is highly homologous to uPA and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), and uPA is a potential physiological activator of FSAP (5Kannemeier C. Feussner A. Stoehr H.A. Preissner K.T. Roemisch J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3789-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Additionally, recent in vitro studies have revealed that hemostatic serine protease inhibitors (serpins), such as C1 inhibitor and α2-antiplasmin, are inhibitors of FSAP proteolytic activity (7Choi-Miura N.H. Saito K. Takahashi K. Yoda M. Mazda T. Tomita M. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2001; 24: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 9Roemisch J. Vermoehlen S. Feussner A. Stoehr H.A. Haemostasis. 1999; 29: 292-299PubMed Google Scholar). These observations prompted us to explore the role of PAI-1, the primary member of this inhibitor family in plasma and tissues (10Vassalli J.D. Sappino A.P. Belin D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1067-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar, 11Andreasen P.A. Georg B. Lund L.R. Riccioo A. Stacey S.N. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1990; 68: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), as a potential regulator of FSAP. It is known that PAI-1 inhibits uPA and tPA by forming SDS-resistant, catalytically inactive complexes with proteases (12Manchanda N. Schwartz B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20032-20035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 13Stratikos E. Gettins P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4808-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In this reaction, the reactive center residues P1-P1′ (Arg346-Met347) in PAI-1 function as an exposed “bait” for the protease by mimicking a putative cleavage site (14Wilczynska M. Fa M. Ohlsson P.I.

In addition to inhibiting serine proteases, PAI-1 also interacts with different components of the extracellular matrix, including heparin (18Ehrlich H.J. Keijer J. Preissner K.T. Gebbink R.K. Pannekoek H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 19Ehrlich H.J. Gebbink R.K. Keijer J. Pannekoek H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7676-7680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In the presence of heparin, the selectivity of PAI-1 for the inhibition of tPA and uPA is compromised, resulting in a 2-fold increased rate of association between PAI-1 and thrombin (18Ehrlich H.J. Keijer J. Preissner K.T. Gebbink R.K. Pannekoek H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This leads to neutralization of PAI-1 due to the formation of inactive SDS-stable PAI-1-thrombin complexes and subsequent cleavage of PAI-1 by thrombin (18Ehrlich H.J. Keijer J. Preissner K.T. Gebbink R.K. Pannekoek H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Similarly, binding of PAI-1 to vitronectin broadens the specificity of the inhibitor, converting it into a potent inhibitor of activated protein C (23Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15567-15570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and thrombin (21Ehrlich H.J. Gebbink R.K. Keijer J. Linders M. Preissner K.T. Pannekoek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13029-13035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, vitronectin stabilizes PAI-1 in its active conformational state and mediates the binding of the inhibitor to fibrin clots (24Podor T.J. Peterson C.B. Lawrence D.A. Stefansson S. Shaughnessy S.G. Foulon D.M. Butcher M. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19788-19794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In complexes with vitronectin, PAI-1 serves as an antiadhesive factor independent of its protease-inhibitory capacity (25Kjoller L. Kanse S.M. Kirkegaard T. Rodenburg K.W. Ronne E. Goodman S.L. Preissner K.T. Ossowski L. Andreasen P.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 232: 420-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In the present study, we identified PAI-1·FSAP complexes in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids of patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Furthermore, formation of a 1:1 stoichiometric complex between PAI-1 and FSAP and dose-dependent binding of PAI-1 to FSAP in vitro was observed. The kinetics of FSAP inhibition by PAI-1 were investigated in the absence and presence of different cofactors (RNA, DNA, vitronectin, and heparin). The presence of extracellular RNA, but not DNA, dramatically enhanced the reactivity of PAI-1 against FSAP. RNA served as a novel stabilizer of the active conformation of PAI-1. These data are particularly relevant, since we also describe elevated levels of extracellular RNA in the BAL fluids of ARDS patients. We also demonstrate that heparin and RNA share the same binding sites on PAI-1. Using site-directed mutagenesis, the critical importance of Arg346 in PAI-1 as a mediator of FSAP inhibition was demonstrated. Additionally, the FSAP-mediated inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation was significantly attenuated in the presence of PAI-1. These results suggest that PAI-1-mediated inhibition of FSAP might play an important role in the regulation of hemostasis and vascular cell functions under a variety of physiological and pathological conditions, such as ARDS. Materials—The purification of FSAP from human plasma by affinity chromatography, together with the conversion of scFSAP to tcFSAP, was performed as described previously (5Kannemeier C. Feussner A. Stoehr H.A. Preissner K.T. Roemisch J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3789-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 26Kannemeier C. Al-Fakhri N. Preissner K.T. Kanse S.M. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 728-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Urokinase-type plasminogen activator and α1-proteinase inhibitor were from ZLB-Behring (Marburg, Germany). Aprotinin was from Bayer (Leverkusen, Germany). Recombinant human wild-type (WT) PAI-1 and PAI-1 variant R346A were expressed in Escherichia coli as described previously (27Wind T. Jensen J.K. Dupont D.M. Kulig P. Andreasen P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The PAI-1 WT as well as PAI-1 variants K65A, K69A, R76A, K80A, and K88A, expressed in E. coli, were a gift from Dr. H. Pannekoek (19Ehrlich H.J. Gebbink R.K. Keijer J. Pannekoek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11606-11611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (University of Amsterdam, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Tissue-type plasminogen activator, C1 inhibitor, antithrombin, and α2-antiplasmin were obtained from American Diagnostica (Pfungstadt, Germany). Vitronectin was prepared from human plasma as described previously (20Declerck P.J. De Mol M. Alessi M.C. Baudner S. Paques E.P. Preissner K.T. Mueller-Berghaus G. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15454-15461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heparin was purchased from Ratiopharm (Ulm, Germany). The extraction of RNA from HepG2 cells was performed using QIAzol™ lysis reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Genomic DNA was isolated from HepG2 cells using Genomic DNA Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. For visual detection, isolated nucleic acids were subjected to electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel followed by ethidium bromide staining. The concentrations of nucleic acids were determined using a Gene Quant photometer (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany). Bronchoalveolar Lavage—BAL fluids were obtained by flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy from spontaneously breathing healthy volunteers without any history of cardiac or lung disease and with normal pulmonary function (n = 8) and from mechanically ventilated patients with early ARDS (<120 h after onset of the disease; n = 8) as recently described (28Gunther A. Siebert C. Schmidt R. Ziegler S. Grimminger F. Yabut M. Temmesfeld B. Walmrath D. Morr H. Seeger W. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1996; 153: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Diagnosis of ARDS was made on the basis of the ARDS American-European consensus criteria (29Bernard G.R. Artigas A. Brigham K.L. Carlet J. Falke K. Hudson L. Lamy M. Legall J.R. Morris A. Spragg R. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1994; 149: 818-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (5328) Google Scholar). Written informed consent was obtained from either the patients or their next-of-kin. Determination of RNA and DNA Concentration in BAL Fluid—RNA and DNA were extracted from BAL fluid using QIAzol™ lysis reagent and QIAamp® DNA minikit, respectively (both from Qiagen). The RNA concentration was measured using one-step real time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR for GAPDH. The amplification primers were GAPDH-F (5′-CCA CAT CGC TCA GAC ACC AT-3′) and GAPDH-R (5′-GGC AAC AAT ATC CAC TTT ACC AGA G-3′) and a dual-labeled fluorescent probe was GAPDH-P (5′-AAG GTC GGA GTC AAC GGA TTT GGT CG-3′). The reverse transcription-PCRs were set up with the GeneAmp EZ rTth RNA PCR kit (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol using 5 μl of extracted RNA. The DNA concentration was assessed using real time quantitative PCR for β-globin. The amplification primers were β-globin-F (5′-GTG CAC CTG ACT CCT GAG GAG-3′) and β-globin-R (5′-CCT TGA TAC CAA CCT GCC CAG-3′), and a dual-labeled fluorescent probe was β-globin-P (5′-AAG GTG AAC GTG GAT GAA GTT GGT GG-3′). The PCRs were set up with a Quan-i Tect probe PCR kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol using 5 μl of extracted DNA. Amplification data were collected and analyzed with an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detector (PE Applied Biosystems). Each sample was analyzed in triplicate, and multiple negative water blanks were included in each analysis. A calibration curve was prepared using serial dilutions of a commercially available human control RNA or human control DNA (both from PE Applied Biosystems). The presence of nucleic acids in BAL fluids from ARDS patients and healthy controls was also assessed by a filter-binding assay, where a nylon membrane was soaked with buffer A (10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1× Denhardt's solution (0.02% (m/v) Ficoll, 0.02% (m/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone, and 0.02% (m/v) BSA)) and fixed into a slot-blot apparatus. The RNA and DNA extracted from the BAL fluid from eight ARDS patients and from eight healthy volunteers was biotinylated and then applied to the filter in 100 μl of TBS for 10 min, aspirated through the filter, and cross-linked for 10 min by exposure to ultraviolet light (254 nm). After washing with buffer A, the membrane was incubated with peroxidase-labeled streptavidin (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark), and detection of RNA and DNA was performed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Biotinylation of RNA and DNA was performed with EZ-Link™ Psoralen-PEO-biotin from Pierce according to the manufacturer's instructions. Western Blotting Analysis of BAL Fluids from ARDS Patients—Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (25 μl) were combined with nonreducing sample buffer containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, and after SDS-PAGE on 10% gels, proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After blocking with 5% (m/v) nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBS-T), the membrane was incubated at 4 °C overnight with a rabbit antibody raised against FSAP (Aventis Behring, Marburg, Germany), followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (DAKO). Immune complexes were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). For detection of PAI-1, the membrane was stripped using stripping buffer (2% (m/v) SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol in TBS) and reprobed with a rabbit anti-PAI-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments—Prior to co-immunoprecipitation, albumin was removed from BAL fluid samples using a ProteoSeek™ antibody-based albumin/IgG removal kit from Pierce according to the manufacturer's instructions. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (100 μl) was incubated at 4 °C overnight with 5 μg of murine monoclonal anti-FSAP antibody or IgG as an isotype control. Samples were transferred to tubes containing 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose™ CL-4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). After a 2-h incubation at room temperature, the immunoprecipitates were washed five times (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100), boiled in 40 μl of SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE (10% gels) under reducing conditions, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% (m/v) nonfat dry milk in TBS-T and then incubated at 4 °C overnight with rabbit antibodies directed against FSAP, PAI-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), α1-proteinase inhibitor (Aventis Behring), C1 inhibitor, α2-antiplasmin, and antithrombin, respectively (all obtained from DAKO). After incubation with peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody, proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Inhibition of FSAP by C1 Inhibitor, α1-Proteinase Inhibitor, Antithrombin III, α2-Antiplasmin, and PAI-1—Fourteen nm (by mass) tcFSAP was added to C1 inhibitor (50 nm), α1-proteinase inhibitor (50 μm), antithrombin (50 μm), α2-antiplasmin (100 nm), and PAI-1 (50 nm) in TBS, pH 7.4, in a total volume of 100 μl. After a 5-min incubation at 37 °C, 10 μl of 3 mm chromogenic substrate S-2288 (H-d-isoleucyl-l-prolyl-l-arginyl-para-nitroanilide dihydrochloride; Chromogenix, Mölndal, Sweden) was added, and the hydrolysis of S-2288 by FSAP was measured spectrophotometrically at 405 nm in an EL 808 microtiter plate reader (BioTek Instruments, Highland Park, VT). Complex Formation between FSAP and C1 Inhibitor, α1-Proteinase Inhibitor, Antithrombin III, α2-Antiplasmin, and PAI-1—Two-chain FSAP (1 μg) was combined with C1 inhibitor (2 μg), α1-proteinase inhibitor (3 μg), antithrombin (2 μg), α2-antiplasmin (2 μg), or PAI-1 (4 μg) in TBS, pH 7.4, in a total volume of 100 μl and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Subsequently, nonreducing sample buffer was added, and the samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Titration of Wild-type PAI-1 and PAI-1 R346A—Increasing amounts of wild-type PAI-1 and PAI-1 R346A were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in a total volume of 100 μl with 3 nm tPA (active concentration) in TBS buffer. Chromogenic substrate (10 μl of a 3 mm S-2288 solution) was added, and residual tPA activity was determined from a linear plot of the increase of absorbance at 405 nm over time. Analysis of PAI-1 Binding to FSAP—A microtiter plate was coated with 50 μl of 140 nm tcFSAP or scFSAP in 50 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.6, at 4 °C overnight. The plate was washed three times with TBS-T buffer, and nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 3% (m/v) BSA in TBS-T at room temperature for 1 h. Increasing concentrations (0–20 nm) of PAI-1 in TBS-T containing 0.3% (m/v) BSA alone or in the presence of 2 μg·ml–1 rabbit antibody against FSAP were added to the wells, and PAI-1 was allowed to bind to FSAP at room temperature for 2 h. After extensive washing with TBS-T, bound PAI-1 was detected using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against PAI-1 followed by peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody. Final detection was performed using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), with a TMB substrate kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Binding of PAI-1 to BSA-coated wells was employed as a background control, against which values were normalized. The uPA-PAI-1 complexes were generated by incubation of equimolar quantities of two-chain uPA and active PAI-1 at room temperature for 30 min and subsequently purified by Superdex 200 gel filtration chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). Complex Formation between FSAP and PAI-1—Twenty ng of tcFSAP or scFSAP were incubated with increasing amounts of PAI-1 (0–80 ng) at room temperature for 30 min. Samples were mixed with either nonreducing or reducing sample buffer, and after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels, proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Detection of proteins was performed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against FSAP or with murine monoclonal antibodies directed against heavy and light chain FSAP, respectively. Subsequently, the membranes were stripped and reprobed with a rabbit anti-PAI-1 antibody. NH2-terminal Sequencing—The amino-terminal sequence of peptides contained in the PAI-1·FSAP complex was determined by automated Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems 492 pulsed liquid phase sequencer equipped with an on-line 785A phenylthiohydantoin derivative analyzer. Ten cycles of Edman degradation were performed, and the amino acids detected at each cycle were aligned with the FSAP sequence (GenBank® accession number NP_004123). Enzymatic Analysis of FSAP Inhibition by PAI-1—Reaction samples contained 14 nm (by mass) tcFSAP, increasing concentrations of PAI-1 (0–24 nm; by active site titration against tPA) and 0.3 mm of the chromogenic substrate S-2288 in 100 μlof TBS, pH 7.4. The hydrolysis of S-2288 by FSAP was measured spectrophotometrically at 405 nm every 30 s at 37 °C for 30 min in an EL 808 microtiter plate reader. To investigate the influence of vitronectin, heparin, RNA, or DNA on the PAI-1-mediated inhibition of FSAP amidolytic activity, 14 nm (by mass) tcFSAP or scFSAP was mixed with 10 nm PAI-1 (by active site titration against tPA) and increasing concentrations of vitronectin (0–40 nm), heparin (0–24 nm), RNA (0–4 μg·ml–1), or DNA (0–4 μg·ml–1). Hydrolysis of S-2288 (0.3 mm) was measured spectrophotometrically as described above. The second-order inhibition rate constant Ka was determined using a continuous progress curve method essentially as described by Futamura and Gettins (30Futamura A. Gettins P.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4092-4098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The change in absorbance resulting from hydrolysis of 1.5 mm S-2288 by FSAP (8 nm, by mass) in the presence of PAI-1 (0–200 nm, by active site titration against tPA) was monitored at 405 nm. A pseudo-first order inhibition rate constant, kobs, was determined by fitting data to a monoexponential equation [P]t = [P]∞(1 – ekobs·t), where [P]t and [P]∞ are the product concentrations at time t and infinite time, respectively, proportional to the recorded A405 values. The Ka was then calculated from the equation, correcting for the presence of competing substrate, by k = kobs(1 + [S-2288]0/Km)/[PAI-1]0, where [S-2288]0 is the concentration of S-2288 at time 0, and [PAI-1]0 is the PAI-1 concentration at time 0. Under the conditions used, the Km was determined to be 70.4 ± 4.4 μm (n = 5). Inhibition of FSAP by PAI-1 R346A—Two-chain FSAP (14 nm) was incubated with wild-type PAI-1 or PAI-1 R346A (24 nm active PAI-1, titrated against tPA) in a total volume of 100 μlof TBS buffer. After 30 min at 37 °C, 10 μl of 0.3 mm S-2288 was added, and FSAP activity was determined from the linear increase of absorbance at 405 nm. The increase of absorbance measured for the sample containing FSAP alone was taken as 100%. Binding of RNA and DNA to PAI-1—For fragmentation of nucleic acids, 1 mg of biotinylated RNA or DNA was dissolved in 1 ml of RNase-, DNase-free water and sonicated for 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 s. At the indicated time points, 100-μl samples were withdrawn, and nucleic acids were precipitated with ethanol. The RNA and DNA were dissolved in RNase-, DNase-free water and tested for PAI-1-binding capacity (see below). Parallel samples were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The wells of a microtiter plate were coated at 4 °C overnight with wild-type PAI-1 at 200 nm (by mass) in 50 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.6. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation with 3% (m/v) BSA in TBS at room temperature for 1 h. Binding assays were performed by adding increasing concentrations of biotinylated RNA (0–25 μg·ml–1 in TBS) or DNA (0–5 μg·ml–1 in TBS) to immobilized wild-type PAI-1. After a 2-h incubation at room temperature, the plate was extensively washed with TBS, and bound nucleic acids were detected using peroxidase-labeled streptavidin. Final detection was performed with a TMB substrate kit from Pierce. The binding of nucleic acids to BSA-coated wells was employed as a blank in all experiments and was subtracted from experimental values to obtain specific binding. Binding of biotinylated RNA or DNA to PAI-1 in the presence of 1 mm heparin, a 100-fold excess of unlabeled RNA or DNA, or 10 mm tranexamic acid (Sigma) served as controls. To determine the RNA and DNA binding sites on PAI-1, the wells of a microtiter plate were coated at 4 °C overnight with PAI-1 variants K65A, K69A, R76A, K80A, and K88A all at 200 nm (by mass) in 50 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.6. After blocking with 3% (m/v) BSA in TBS, 10 μg·ml–1 of biotinylated RNA or 3 μg·ml–1 of DNA were added, and the plate was incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Final detection of PAI-1-bound RNA or DNA was performed as described above. Since PAI-1 is partially denatured by adsorption to plastic at 4 °C overnight, data obtained in the microplate assay reflect nucleic acid binding to denatured"

https://openalex.org/W2018060242,"In mammals, the universal sulfuryl group donor molecule 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) is synthesized in two steps by a bifunctional enzyme called PAPS synthetase. The APS kinase domain of PAPS synthetase catalyzes the second step in which APS, the product of the ATP-sulfurylase domain, is phosphorylated on its 3′-hydroxyl group to yield PAPS. The substrate APS acts as a strong uncompetitive inhibitor of the APS kinase reaction. We generated truncated and point mutants of the APS kinase domain that are active but devoid of substrate inhibition. Structural analysis of these mutant enzymes reveals the intrasubunit rearrangements that occur upon substrate binding. We also observe intersubunit rearrangements in this dimeric enzyme that result in asymmetry between the two monomers. Our work elucidates the structural elements required for the ability of the substrate APS to inhibit the reaction at micromolar concentrations. Because the ATP-sulfurylase domain of PAPS synthetase influences these elements in the APS kinase domain, we propose that this could be a communication mechanism between the two domains of the bifunctional enzyme. In mammals, the universal sulfuryl group donor molecule 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) is synthesized in two steps by a bifunctional enzyme called PAPS synthetase. The APS kinase domain of PAPS synthetase catalyzes the second step in which APS, the product of the ATP-sulfurylase domain, is phosphorylated on its 3′-hydroxyl group to yield PAPS. The substrate APS acts as a strong uncompetitive inhibitor of the APS kinase reaction. We generated truncated and point mutants of the APS kinase domain that are active but devoid of substrate inhibition. Structural analysis of these mutant enzymes reveals the intrasubunit rearrangements that occur upon substrate binding. We also observe intersubunit rearrangements in this dimeric enzyme that result in asymmetry between the two monomers. Our work elucidates the structural elements required for the ability of the substrate APS to inhibit the reaction at micromolar concentrations. Because the ATP-sulfurylase domain of PAPS synthetase influences these elements in the APS kinase domain, we propose that this could be a communication mechanism between the two domains of the bifunctional enzyme. Enzyme inhibitors are molecules that bind to enzymes and decrease their activity. Usually, we think of inhibitors as molecules that mimic the substrates, products, or transition state or fit in an allosteric site and, once bound, arrest the enzyme in its catalytic cycle or slow it down. However, even the true substrates (or products) of the reaction can act as inhibitors. In such cases, enzyme kinetic measurements show pronounced deviations from the hyperbolic dependence of velocity on substrate concentration. Substrate inhibition is usually observed only at high substrate concentrations, whereas at low substrate concentrations the kinetics follow simple Michaelis-Menten behavior. Substrate or product inhibition phenomena are widely found in nature and believed to be important for metabolic feedback regulation processes (1Colletier J.-P. Fournier D. Greenblatt H.M. Stojan J.

However, the underlying mechanisms are complex and structurally poorly characterized. In this work, we shed light on one such system present in adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (APS) 4The abbreviations used are: APS, adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate; PAPS, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate; PAPSS, PAPS synthetase; Δ25N, Δ34N, and Δ50N, the truncation mutants of the APS kinase domain of human PAPSS1 that start at residues 26, 35, and 51, respectively, and end at residue 227; d-, deoxy-; RB1, rigid body 1; RB2, rigid body 2; GST, glutathione S-transferase; NMP, nucleoside monophosphate.4The abbreviations used are: APS, adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate; PAPS, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate; PAPSS, PAPS synthetase; Δ25N, Δ34N, and Δ50N, the truncation mutants of the APS kinase domain of human PAPSS1 that start at residues 26, 35, and 51, respectively, and end at residue 227; d-, deoxy-; RB1, rigid body 1; RB2, rigid body 2; GST, glutathione S-transferase; NMP, nucleoside monophosphate. kinase. APS kinase is an evolutionarily conserved enzyme catalyzing the second step in the formation of 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS), the universal sulfuryl donor in biological systems. In the first reaction of PAPS formation, inorganic sulfate is converted to APS by ATP-sulfurylase. In the second reaction, APS kinase phosphorylates APS at the 3′-hydroxyl of the ribose to produce PAPS. ATP-Mg+SO42-⇌APS+PPi-Mg(ATP sulfurylase)REACTION 1 APS+ATP-Mg⇌PAPS+ADP-Mg(APS kinase)REACTION 2 PAPS is used as a substrate for sulfotransferases, which sulfonate a wide rage of molecules, including proteins, glycosaminoglycans, steroid hormones, and xenobiotics (4Klaassen C.D. Boles J.W. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 404-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). ATP-sulfurylase and APS kinase are separate enzymes in bacteria, yeast, fungi, and plants, but are found on a single polypeptide chain in the animal kingdom (5Venkatachalam K.V. IUBMB Life. 2003; 55: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In its bifunctional form, called PAPS synthetase or PAPSS, each domain retains the same fold as in the homologous monofunctional enzyme (6Beynon J.D. MacRae I.J. Huston S.L. Nelson D.C. Segel I.H.

The significance of this protein fusion is still ambiguous. Kinetic studies indicate no substrate channeling between the domains (9Lansdon E.B. Fisher A.J. Segel I.H. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4356-4365Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), a result consistent with the recent crystal structure of human PAPSS (8Harjes S. Bayer P. Scheidig A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 623-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The importance of the reaction catalyzed by PAPSS is emphasized by the fact that mutations in one of the two isoforms of this enzyme (PAPSS1 and PAPSS2) significantly affect phenotype. Mutation in isoform 2 (PAPSS2) is associated with spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia disease in humans (10ul Haque M.F. King L.M. Krakow D. Cantor R.M. Rusiniak M.E. Swank R.T. Superti-Furga A.

Interestingly, the P. chrysogenum APS kinase (13Renosto F. Seubert P.A. Segel I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2113-2123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14MacRae I.J. Segel I.H. Arch.

Kinetic data suggest that the inhibitory complex results from formation of the E·ADP·APS complex (Scheme 1). In contrast, the APS kinase from Escherichia coli represents a distant protein that proceeds through a phosphorylated enzyme intermediate and exhibits competitive substrate inhibition (18Satishchandran C. Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15012-15021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological relevance of strong substrate inhibition observed in APS kinase is still ambiguous. Crystal structures of APS kinases have been characterized for the P. chrysogenum (7Lansdon E.B. Segel I.H. Fisher A.J.

Biol. 2005; 347: 623-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) as well as of the isolated domain (20Sekulic N. Dietrich K. Paarmann I. Ort S. Konrad M. Lavie A. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 488-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) have been reported. The P. chrysogenum enzyme (7Lansdon E.B. Segel I.H. Fisher A.J.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1613-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the isolated human APS kinase domain of PAPSS1 (20Sekulic N. Dietrich K. Paarmann I. Ort S. Konrad M. Lavie A. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 488-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and the recently deposited structure of the APS kinase domain of PAPSS2 (PDB ID 2AX4) are found as a symmetrical dimer in the crystal, with the identical set of nucleotides present in the two monomers. In contrast, the crystallized bifunctional enzyme PAPSS1 (8Harjes S. Bayer P. Scheidig A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 623-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) revealed an asymmetrical dimer, where one subunit had ADP bound (and APS after soaking), whereas the other subunit had no nucleotides in the active site. This difference raised the question of whether dimer asymmetry of the APS kinase domain in the context of the bifunctional enzyme is a crystallization artifact or a reflection of a real conformation in solution. Harjes et al. (8Harjes S. Bayer P. Scheidig A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 623-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) rationalized the asymmetry to be a consequence of the differences in the P-loop sequence present in the human enzyme versus the one in the P. chrysogenum enzyme, which crystallized as a symmetrical dimer. However, our recent structure of the APS kinase domain from human PAPSS1 (20Sekulic N. Dietrich K. Paarmann I. Ort S. Konrad M. Lavie A. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 488-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) shows a symmetrical dimer, thereby eliminating the sequence differences as a possible cause for the observed asymmetry. Our structures of the APS kinase domain also reveal that the N-terminal region of one monomer is in close proximity to the active site of the other monomer (20Sekulic N. Dietrich K. Paarmann I. Ort S. Konrad M. Lavie A. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 488-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We designed several mutations in this region to investigate if this conformation is significant and if the N termini play a role in the catalytic activity of the enzyme. However, mutations of N-terminal residues closest to the active site had no effect on the activity (20Sekulic N. Dietrich K. Paarmann I. Ort S. Konrad M. Lavie A. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 488-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, it was found that, in a variant lacking the first 50 N-terminal residues (Δ50N), substrate inhibition was abolished and the maximum activity was approximately one-half compared with the full-length enzyme. To explain this unexpected result at the molecular level we solved the crystal structure of the Δ50N-truncated APS kinase domain variant of PAPSS1. Based on analysis of our structure we propose a model for the regulation of substrate inhibition that was validated by mutagenesis. Together, the work presented herein analyzes the nature and regulation of uncompetitive substrate inhibition observed in APS kinases, which contributes to the understanding of substrate inhibition per se and suggests a possible communication mechanism between the APS kinase and ATP-sulfurylase domains in the bifunctional PAPSS. Protein Expression and Purification—The APS kinase domain (amino acid residues 25-227) of the PAPSS1 coding region (21Venkatachalam K.V. Akita H. Strott C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19311-19320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) was cloned as a glutathione S-transferase fusion in the bacterial expression vector pGEX-RB (22Brundiers R. Lavie A. Veit T. Reinstein J. Schlichting I. Ostermann N. Goody R.S. Konrad M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35289-35292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) in which the thrombin cleavage site was replaced by a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease recognition site. The same was done for the deletion mutant Δ34N-(35-227) and the point mutants R37A and R40A (the latter made in the background of the 25-227 construct). Proteins were expressed and purified as described before (20Sekulic N. Dietrich K. Paarmann I. Ort S. Konrad M. Lavie A. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 488-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The deletion mutant Δ50N-(51-227) was initially cloned in the same vector as the other constructs, but the GST tag could not be effectively removed from the expressed protein. To overcome this problem, we cloned the 50-227 coding region of human APS kinase domain in the pJC20 vector that carries no tags. Transformed cells of the BL-21 Codon-Plus (Stratagene) strain of Escherichia coli were induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and left to grow at 22 °C overnight. Cells were lysed by sonication, and after centrifugation the supernatant was subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation. Fractions precipitated with 40-80% of ammonium sulfate were pooled, resuspended, and dialyzed against a buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. The protein solution was applied on pre-equilibrated Blue-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences), washed, and eluted with a salt gradient from 0 to 1 m KCl. Fractions eluted with 250-400 mm KCl were collected, merged, concentrated, and dialyzed against the same buffer as after ammonium sulfate precipitation. The protein was further purified by an anion exchange column (WP-QUAT, J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ) and highly pure Δ50N APS kinase eluted at 1 m KCl. Purified protein was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol, and stored at -80 °C. During the purification process the purity of APS kinase was followed by SDS-PAGE. The final yield from a 2-liter culture was ∼8 mg of protein. Prior to crystallization, the Δ50N APS kinase protein was dialyzed against a solution containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. Crystallization and X-ray Data Collection—Crystals were grown at room temperature using hanging drops containing equal volumes of protein and reservoir solution (2 + 2 μl). The protein solution contained 3.2 mg/ml Δ50N APS kinase, 2 mm dADP, 2 mm APS (or 2 mm PAPS), and 5 mm MgCl2, whereas the reservoir contained 16-20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350 and 0.25-0.15 m di-ammonium hydrogen citrate (pH 5.0). We used dADP instead of ADP to allow unambiguous discrimination to APS, which is isosteric to ADP. Nice single crystals appeared within 2 days and exceeded the size of 150 × 200 × 100 μm. 100% mineral oil (light white; Sigma M3516) was used as a cryoprotectant. Data were collected using the SER-CAT beam line at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratories, and processed with the XDS program package (23Kabash W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3200) Google Scholar). Steady-state Kinetics—The APS kinase enzymatic assay in the forward reaction was performed by monitoring the rate of ADP formation using the pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase-coupled spectrophotometric assay that measures the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm due to the oxidation of NADH. The assay was performed using 200-400 nm enzyme in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm ATP, 0.4 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, and 0.2 mm NADH. The concentration of APS was varied between 2 and 100 μm. The reaction mixture was left to equilibrate for 10 min at 37 °C to allow for the consumption of trace ADP present in the ATP stock solution. APS kinase was added to trigger the reaction. All measurements were made in triplicate at 37 °C using a Varian Cary 50 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer. Deletion of the 50 N-terminal Residues from the APS Kinase Domain of Human PAPSS1 Abolishes Substrate Inhibition—Previous work revealed that the N-terminal residues of the APS kinase domain of PAPSS1 form an extension that interacts with the neighboring molecule of the dimeric enzyme (20Sekulic N. Dietrich K. Paarmann I. Ort S. Konrad M. Lavie A. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 488-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Specifically, residues 26-35 of molecule A adopt an extended conformation near to the active site of molecule B (and vice versa), whereas residues 36-44 form a helix at the interface of the two molecules. Although the overall amino acid sequence conservation of the N-terminal region in APS kinase domains is low, two residues are highly conserved: an invariant asparagine at position 27, and either a glutamine or histidine at position 31. The proximity of these N-terminal residues of one molecule to its neighbor, together with sequence conservation at positions 27 and 31, suggested that these amino acids could be functionally important. To test this, point mutations and a deletion variant were generated. Surprisingly, the two point mutants (N27A and Q31A) as well as a variant lacking the first 34 N-terminal residues showed no appreciable effect on the enzyme kinetics (20Sekulic N. Dietrich K. Paarmann I. Ort S. Konrad M. Lavie A. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 488-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In contrast, deletion of additional 16 N-terminal residues (Δ50N mutant) resulted in a protein totally devoid of substrate inhibition by APS and with approximately half of the full-length's kcat (Fig. 1). These results prompted us to solve the structure of the Δ50N variant of the APS kinase domain to decipher the structural reasons of the unexpected kinetic behavior observed for this construct. Our goal is to understand how the presence/absence of these 16 residues controls substrate inhibition. Crystal Structure of Δ50N APS Kinase Domain of Human PAPSS1 Reveals an Asymmetrical Dimer—Structure of the Δ50N mutant of APS kinase domain (50-227) was solved in two different complexes. One complex contains dADP and APS, whereas the second has dADP and PAPS. The use of dADP instead of ADP in these studies allowed us to unambiguously differentiate between the isosteric nucleotides ADP and APS. Crystallographic data for the dADP·APS complex extended to 1.88 Å, and the structure was refined to an R-factor of 20.9% and Rfree of 25.3%. The dADP·PAPS complex diffracted to 1.40 Å and was refined to an R-factor of 19.7% and Rfree to 22.0%. Detailed data collection and refinement statistics for both complexes are summarized in Table 1.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsdADP·PAPSdADP·APSData collectionPDB ID2pez2peyBeamlineAPS, SERCAT-BMAPS, SERCAT-BMWavelength (Å)1.0001.000Unit cell (Å)a = 44.09, b = 59.40, c = 139.02, α = β = γ = 90a = 43.43, b = 59.75, c = 138.92, α = β = γ = 90Space groupP212121P212121No. molecules/a.u.22Resolution limit (Å)30-1.4020-1.88Measured reflections273,547202,712Unique reflections64,71229,201Completeness (%; overall/last shell)88.6/87.0aLast shell (dADP·PAPS) = 1.398-1.435 Å.97.1/82.7bLast shell (APS·APS) = 1.885-1.933 Å.I/σI (overall/last shell)15.73/4.31aLast shell (dADP·PAPS) = 1.398-1.435 Å.16.63/4.14bLast shell (APS·APS) = 1.885-1.933 Å.RsymcRsym = ∑|I - 〈I 〉|/∑I.

Open table in a new tab The overall fold for the truncated enzyme (Fig. 2A) is essentially identical to that previously described for this domain in the context of the intact human bifunctional PAPSS1 (8Harjes S. Bayer P. Scheidig A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 623-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) as well as the isolated APS kinase domain of PAPSS1 (20Sekulic N. Dietrich K. Paarmann I. Ort S. Konrad M. Lavie A. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 488-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and PAPSS2 (PDB ID 2AX4). However, where previously a symmetrical dimer was observed in the structures of the isolated domains in which both monomers had their nucleotide acceptor and nucleotide donor sites identically occupied, the Δ50N variant of APS kinase domain revealed an asymmetric dimer. One monomer has both nucleotides bound, as seen before, whereas the second monomer has only dADP present (i.e. APS or PAPS were absent). We observed the same asymmetrical dimer for both the dADP·APS and dADP·PAPS complexes reported here (see supplemental data). Interestingly, asymmetry within a dimer of the APS kinase domain has also been observed in the context of the human bifunctional PAPSS1 (8Harjes S. Bayer P. Scheidig A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 623-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In that structure, one monomer had ADP bound (and APS after soaking) but the other monomer's active site remained invariably empty. The absence of nucleotide in the phosphoryl acceptor-binding site of one monomer in our structures resulted in a flexible lid region, inferred by the lack of electron density for residues 171-190 in that monomer (dashed line, Fig. 2A; schematically represented as a mesh pattern in Fig. 2B). Lack of electron density for this segment of the protein in the absence of APS is consistent with prior results (8Harjes S. Bayer P. Scheidig A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 623-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 19MacRae I.J. Segel I.H. Fisher A.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1613-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Detailed descriptions of the interactions made by the nucleotides and the enzyme are similar to those reported before and are presented as supplementary information (supplemental Fig. S2). It has been noted by MacRea et al. (19MacRae I.J. Segel I.H. Fisher A.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1613-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) that the overall fold of APS kinase resembles that of the nucleoside monophosphate (NMP) kinases. These enzymes phosphorylate nucleoside 5′-monophosphates (e.g. AMP and GMP) to yield nucleoside 5′-diphosphates (e.g. ADP and GDP). Because APS kinase also catalyzes phosphoryl transfer, although this time to the ribose 3′-hydroxyl of APS to yield PAPS, it is not surprising that APS kinase adopts an “NMP kinase-like” fold. Structural studies of NMP kinases revealed that these enzymes possess three regions named core, lid, and the NMP-binding region. In NMP kinases, these structural and functional elements behave as rigid bodies that change positions relative to one another during the catalytic cycle (24Schulz G.E. Muller C.W. Diederichs K. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 25Sekulic N. Shuvalova L. Spangenberg O. Konrad M. Lavie A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 33882-33889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We were able to also identify rigid regions in the APS kinase domain by comparing the two molecules present in the asymmetric unit: one with only dADP bound, the second with both dADP and APS. We included for this comparison other published structures of the human APS kinase domain (8Harjes S. Bayer P. Scheidig A.J. J. Mol.

A part that was attributed to the core region in NMP kinases unites with the lid region in APS kinase (blue colors, Fig. 2) to form a region we call Rigid Body 1 (RB1) (Fig. 2C). The remaining part of the core (yellow and orange, Fig. 2) forms an independent rigid body that we designate as Rigid Body 2 (RB2) (Fig. 2D). The third rigid region in APS kinase (inset, Fig. 2D), the analogous part to the NMP-binding region of NMP kinases, is labeled APS-cap and is shown in pink/red in Fig. 2. Comparison of the two monomers present in the crystal structure of the Δ50N variant reveals intramolecular differences (i.e. different relative orientations of RB1, RB2, and APS-cap). These differences can be attributed to the absence of APS in one of the monomers. In addition, superpositioning the structure of the APS kinase domain, which exhibits APS inhibition (residues 25-227), with the Δ50N variant reported here, which lacks APS inhibition, reveals intermolecular differences. The intramolecular changes (i.e. the relative orientation of the rigid regions within a monomer) and the intermolecular changes (i.e. the relative orientation of the two monomers forming the dimer) are related and are discussed in the next section. Intramolecular Rearrangements, Closing of the Active Site—The APS kinase reaction follows the sequential ordered binding mechanism (Scheme 1) in which ATP binds prior to APS and PAPS leaves before ADP (13Renosto F. Seubert P.A. Segel I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2113-2123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To understand the intramolecular conformational changes that occur upon nucleotide binding we compared the nucleotide-free monomer of the APS kinase domain as observed by Harjes et al. (8Harjes S. Bayer P. Scheidig A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 623-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) with our Δ50N monomer in which only dADP is present. We then added to our analysis the second Δ50N monomer (monomer A) where dADP occupies the phosphoryl-donor site and APS the acceptor site. Superposition of the ligand-free APS kinase monomer and the dADP-only monomer shows that dADP binding, used here to approximate ATP binding, elicits only moderate conformational changes. These changes are mainly limited to the RB1 region. Specifically, rearrangements of the P-loop and the loop connecting β5 and α8 that provides the binding pocket for the adenine base take place. Most notably, binding of dADP orders 10 residues of the lid region (161-170), which in the absence of nucleotides has 31 unstructured residues (161-190; see Fig. S1). The lid residues adopt a more rigid conformation due to the stacking interaction between Arg-168 and the adenine base of dADP (supplemental Fig. S2). This decrease in flexibility of the lid region is necessary for effective binding of the second nucleotide APS, which would explain the obligate order of binding of this enzyme (13Renosto F. Seubert P.A. Segel I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2113-2123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Note that, although the binding of ATP with its associated magnesium ion would also induce a change in conformation of the DGDN-loop (for a discussion on the"

Because heparan sulfate chains can be associated with intracellular protein aggregates, glypican-1 autoprocessing may be involved in the clearance of misfolded recycling proteins. Here we have arrested and then reactivated NO-catalyzed cleavage in the absence or presence of proteasome inhibitors and analyzed the products present in endosomes or co-precipitating with proteasomes using metabolic radiolabeling and immunomagnet isolation as well as by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Upon reactivation of deaminative cleavage in T24 carcinoma cells, [35S]sulfate-labeled degradation products appeared in Rab7-positive vesicles and co-precipitated with a 20 S proteasome subunit. Simultaneous inhibition of proteasome activity resulted in a sustained accumulation of degradation products. We also demonstrated that the anhydromannose-containing heparan sulfate degradation products are detected by a hydrazide-based method that also identifies oxidized, i.e. carbonylated, proteins that are normally degraded in proteasomes. Upon inhibition of proteasome activity, pronounced colocalization between carbonyl-staining, anhydro-mannose-containing degradation products, and proteasomes was observed in both T24 carcinoma and N2a neuroblastoma cells. The deaminatively generated products that co-precipitated with the proteasomal subunit contained heparan sulfate but were larger than heparan sulfate oligosaccharides and resistant to both acid and alkali. However, proteolytic degradation released heparan sulfate oligosaccharides. In Niemann-Pick C-1 fibroblasts, where deaminative degradation of heparan sulfate is defective, carbonylated proteins were abundant. Moreover, when glypican-1 expression was silenced in normal fibroblasts, the level of carbonylated proteins increased raising the possibility that deaminative heparan sulfate degradation is involved in the clearance of misfolded proteins.

Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1016-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). HS chains are also found both in intracellular tangles and in extracellular amyloid deposits characteristic of Alzheimer disease (3Goedert M. Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Hasegawa M. Smith M.J. Crowther R.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar, 4Castillo G.M. Lukito W. Wight T.N. Snow A.D. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1681-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The two major cell-associated HS proteoglycan families are the syndecans and the glypicans. The syndecan core proteins are all transmembrane proteins, whereas the glypicans are attached to membrane lipids via a C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (Fig. 1). The ectodomains, which carry the HS chains, vary greatly in size within the syndecan family but display considerable homology among the glypicans. The latter also share a characteristic pattern of 14 conserved Cys residues, and their HS attachment sites are concentrated to a short region near the C terminus. Cell surface HS proteoglycans are constitutively endocytosed and degraded. Their HS chains can be cleaved into oligosaccharides by heparanase and terminally degraded by a set of exoglycosidases and sulfatases in lysosomes (5Yogalingam G. Hopwood J.J. Hum. Mutat. 2001; 18: 264-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Glypican-1 (Gpc-1), the most widely expressed member of the glypican family, is lipid raft-associated (6Watanabe N. Araki W. Chui D.-H. Makifuchi T. Ihara Y. Tabira T. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1013-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and probably endocytosed via caveolae (see Fig. 1). In addition to heparanase-catalyzed degradation, Gpc-1 can undergo nitric oxide (NO)- or nitroxyl (HNO)-catalyzed deaminative cleavage of its HS chains at N-unsubstituted glucosamine residues (GlcNH+3) (7Mani K.

The deaminative cleavage generates anhydromannose (anMan) which remains as the reducing terminal sugar of the released HS chains or oligosaccharides (10Horton D. Philips K.D. Carbohydr.

The NO/HNO required for deaminative cleavage of HS seems to be derived from preformed S-nitroso (SNO) groups in the Gpc-1 core protein. In the presence of copper ions and an NO donor, purified Gpc-1 can be S-nitrosylated in vitro (8Ding K. Mani K. Cheng F. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33353-33360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In vivo, copper ions can be provided by cuproproteins, such as the prion protein in fibroblasts or N2a neuroblastoma cells (14Mani K. Cheng F. Havsmark B. Jönsson M. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J.

Accordingly, Gpc-1 is not S-nitrosylated in prion null fibroblasts, but S-nitrosylation is restored upon ectopic expression of the prion protein (14Mani K. Cheng F. Havsmark B. Jönsson M. Belting M.

No anMan-positive products are generated when prion protein lacking the copper binding domain is expressed in these cells (15Cheng F. Lindqvist J. Haigh C.L. Brown D.R. Mani K. J. Neurochem. 2006; 98: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In T24 carcinoma cells, Gpc-1-SNO colocalizes with caveolin-1 (9Cheng F. Mani K. van den Born J. Ding K. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44431-44439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), indicating that S-nitrosylation takes place at an early stage of recycling (see Fig. 1). Gpc-1-SNO autodegrades its own HS chains to anMan-containing oligosaccharides when exposed to ascorbate in vitro (8Ding K. Mani K. Cheng F. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33353-33360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Studies on cultured cells have shown that endogenously generated anMan-positive products colocalize primarily with Rab7, a marker for late endosomes (17Mani K. Cheng F. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 18Mani K. Cheng F. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 1251-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC-1) fibroblasts, which display an endosomal transport block, staining by the anMan-specific mAb was very weak (17Mani K. Cheng F. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, formation of anMan-positive products that colocalized with Rab7 could be enhanced by exogenously supplied ascorbate. When N2a neuroblastoma cells were treated with 3-β[2(diethylamino)ethoxy]androst-5-en-17-one (U18666A), a compound that mimics the NPC phenotype, formation of anMan-positive products was depressed. Also in these cells, ascorbate restored formation of anMan-positive products that colocalized with Rab7. Inhibition of endosomal acidification in T24 cells, which blocks transfer from early (Rab5) to late (Rab7) endosomes, abrogated generation of anMan-positive products (18Mani K. Cheng F. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 1251-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This could also be overcome by simultaneous addition of ascorbate, which induced formation of anMan-positive products that colocalized with Rab7. [35S]Sulfate-labeled anMan-positive products generated constitutively in T24 cells comprise free HS chains and relatively large HS oligosaccharides (18Mani K. Cheng F. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 1251-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The latter are especially prominent in Rab7-positive vesicles. Moreover, anMan-positive HS degradation products have been detected both in the cytosol (18Mani K. Cheng F. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 1251-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and in the nucleus (19Mani K. Belting M. Ellervik U. Falk N. Svensson G. Sandgren S. Cheng F. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 387-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), suggesting that deaminatively generated HS degradation products may exit from the endosomes (see Fig. 1). Because HS can be associated with intracellular aggregates derived from misfolded proteins (3Goedert M. Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Hasegawa M. Smith M.J. Crowther R.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar), we speculated that HS and its oligosaccharide degradation products might be involved in the degradation and/or clearance of misfolded recycling proteins. It has been shown that a proteasome α-subunit interacts specifically with Rab7 and thereby recruits 20 S proteasomes to multivesicular late endosomes (20Dong J. Chen W. Welford A. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21334-21342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We, therefore, decided to examine if anMan-containing HS oligosaccharides can associate with misfolded proteins and proteasomes. By inhibiting and then activating deaminative cleavage in the presence of proteasome inhibitors and analyzing HS degradation products co-isolating with Rab7-positive endosomes or colocalizing/co-precipitating with oxidized proteins or proteasomes, we have obtained results indicating that the anMan-containing HS degradation products can associate with proteins that are normally degraded in proteasomes. Cells, Antibodies, and Reagents—Human T24 carcinoma cells, HFL-1 fibroblasts, and mouse N2a neuroblastoma cells were obtained from ATCC and human NPC-1 fibroblasts (GM03123) from the Corielle Institute. Cells were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Polyclonal antisera against human Gpc-1, Rab7, and Rab9 and mAbs against Rab9 and anMan-terminating HS oligosaccharides suitably tagged secondary antibodies as well as suramin, difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), U18666A, HS, N-desulfated HS, sodium l-ascorbate, enzymes, prepacked columns, and other chemicals were generated or obtained as described previously (7Mani K.

A polyclonal antibody against Rab5 and a mAb against ubiquitin (Ub) were from Santa Cruz and a polyclonal antibody against the human 20 S proteasome α1 subunit was from Calbiochem. Immune-Star horse-radish peroxidase chemiluminescent kit was purchased from Bio-Rad, and the OxyBlot protein oxidation detection kit was from Chemicon. The commercially obtained antibodies were tested by Western blotting according to the manufacturers. Proteinase K was from Sigma-Aldrich, and a proteasome inhibitor set I, including two aldehyde-terminating hydrophobic peptides, and lactacystin were obtained from Calbiochem. Polyacrylamide gels were from Invitrogen, Sweden, and protein G-Sepharose 4B was from Sigma-Aldrich. Dynabeads M-280 sheep anti-rabbit IgG was obtained from Dynal ASA, Oslo, Norway. Dehydroascorbic acid was generated by leaving a 1 m stock solution of ascorbate in contact with air for 24 h. Confocal Microscopy—The various procedures including seeding of cells, fixations, the use of primary and secondary antibodies, generation of images by sequential scans, and data processing were the same as those used previously (8Ding K.

The second antibody used was either goat anti-mouse total Ig when the primary antibody was a mouse monoclonal or goat anti-rabbit IgG when the primary antibody was a rabbit polyclonal. The second antibodies were tagged with either fluorescein isothiocyanate or Texas Red and appropriately combined for colocalization studies. For detection of carbonyls, the method of Hernebring et al. (21Hernebring M. Brolén G. Aguilaniu H. Semb H. Nyström T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For confocal microscopy we used a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope equipped with a 100× objective and a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal laser scanning system. Images shown were obtained at a focal plane that was at the center of the cell and of 0.3–0.5-μm thickness, depending on the intensity of the staining. Identical focal plane thickness and exposure settings were used for image capture in the colocalization experiments. Images were digitized and transferred to Adobe PhotoShop for merging, annotation, and printing. Immunoisolation and Separation of Radiolabeled Degradation Products—Confluent T24 cells were preincubated with 5 mm DFMO for 24 h and then with 0.2 mm suramin and 50 μCi/ml [35S]sulfate for another 24 h as described previously (7Mani K. Jönsson M. Edgren G. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 577-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Cells were homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.25 m sucrose, 0.1 m EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Rab5-, Rab-7, or Rab-9 positive vesicles as well as 20 S proteasome α1 subunit-containing material were isolated from cell homogenates by using polyclonal antibodies against the various proteins as primary antibodies and Dynabeads M-280 sheep anti-rabbit IgG as magnetic secondary antibody. The magnetic particles were recovered using a magnetic particle concentrator and extensively washed with phosphate-buffered saline (at least 10 times). The radiolabeled, magnetically isolated vesicles were lysed in 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 2% Triton X-100, 10 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5, and mixed with an equal volume of 8 m guanidinium chloride. Lysates were then subjected to gel filtration chromatography on Superose 6 or Superdex peptide in 4 m guanidinium chloride/0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 as described previously (7Mani K. Jönsson M.

For immunoisolation of radiolabeled, carbonyl-containing proteins, an adaptation of the method of Hernebring et al. (21Hernebring M. Brolén G. Aguilaniu H. Semb H. Nyström T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7700-7705Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) was used. In short, confluent NPC-1 fibroblasts were incubated with 50 μCi/ml [35S]sulfate or [35S]Met/Cys for 24 h. A sucrose homogenate (1.1 ml) was treated with 150 μl of 2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP)-hydrazine (10×) for 15 min. After the addition of 115 μl of neutralization solution, the sample was treated with 150 μl of anti-DNP antibody (1:62) at 4 °C overnight. The immune complex was then recovered using a magnetic secondary antibody, dissolved in elution buffer, and chromatographed on Superose 6. Co-immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and Western Blotting—Confluent T24 cells (0.5 × 106 cells) were preincubated with 5 mm DFMO for 24 h and then with 0.2 mm suramin and 10 μg/ml U18666A for another 24 and 16 h, respectively. Deaminative HS cleavage was reactivated by 1 mm ascorbate in the presence of proteasome inhibitors (25 μm MG-132, 25 μm proteasome inhibitor-I, and 1.5 μm lactacystin) for 4 h. In the case of N2a neuroblastoma cells, only inhibition of proteasome activity was performed. Sucrose homogenates of the cells containing ∼2 mg of protein were treated with DNP hydrazine as described above and then first treated with protein G-Sepharose 4B and then with the mAb directed against anMan-containing HS degradation products or the anti-20 S proteasome α1 subunit antibody or no antibody in the presence of added Triton X-100 (1%, v/v). Immune complexes were recovered on protein G-Sepharose 4B. The gels were washed 6 times with 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20. Bound material was released by boiling in SDS buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE on 4–12% gels under reducing conditions followed by transfer to blotting membrane as described (7Mani K. Jönsson M. Edgren G. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 577-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Membranes were blotted first with anti-DNP (1:150) then stripped in 100 mm 2-mecaptoethanol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, at 50 °C for 30 min and re-blotted with anti-Ub (1:200) or in reverse order. After the washings, membranes were probed with goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1:20,000) for 1 h at 20 °C and developed using a Fujifilm ECL detector. Band intensity was estimated by densitometric tracing. Silencing of Gpc-1 Expression and Detection of Carbonylated Proteins—Confluent HFL-1 fibroblasts (0.5 × 106 cells) were transfected with a vector containing a sequence corresponding to nucleotides 977–995 in human Gpc-1 or a scrambled sequence as described previously (22Belting M. Mani K. Jönsson M. Cheng F. Sandgren S. Jonsson S. Ding K. Delcros J.-G. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47181-47189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The extent of silencing was assessed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using anti-Gpc-1 (1:1,000) and anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody. A sucrose homogenate of the cells containing ∼2 mg of protein was treated with DNP hydrazine as described above and then first treated with protein G-Sepharose 4B and then with anti-DNP antibody in presence of added Triton X-100 (1%, v/v). Immune complexes were recovered by magnetic secondary antibodies as described above. Bound material was released by boiling in SDS buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE on 4–12% gels under reducing conditions followed by staining for protein by Coomassie colloidal blue (Invitrogen). Band intensity was estimated by densitometric tracing. Degradations—Samples were digested with 100 μg/ml proteinase K in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5, at 37 °C for 8 h or with HS lyase (alias heparitinase or heparinase III) in the presence of proteinase inhibitors or treated with alkali (0.5 m NaOH, 0.05 m NaBH4 at room temperature overnight), acid (0.1 m HCl at room temperature for 4 h), or HNO2 at pH 1.5 or 3.9, all as described previously (7Mani K.

Dot Blot Assay—N-Desulfated HS (3 μg), either untreated or treated with HNO2 at pH 3.9, was blotted onto immunoblot membranes (polyvinylidene difluoride), and carbonyl staining was performed as described (21Hernebring M. Brolén G. Aguilaniu H. Semb H. Nyström T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7700-7705Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) except that goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody was used as secondary antibody and visualized by photoimaging. Deaminatively Generated HS Degradation Products Accumulate When Proteasome Activity Is Inhibited—Previous studies have shown that treatment of T24 carcinoma cells with DFMO increases the number of GlcNH+3 residues, i.e. NO-sensitive sites, in HS of Gpc-1 (23Ding K. Sandgren S. Mani K. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46779-46791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Hence, pretreatment with DFMO is a way to increase the yield of anMan-containing HS chains and oligosaccharides upon deaminative cleavage. Furthermore, when heparanase is inhibited by suramin, more HS is available for NO-dependent cleavage (Fig. 1). Hence, to maximize the yield and to investigate the nature of the deaminative HS degradation products present in endosomes of T24 cells, DFMO- and suramin-treated cells were incubated with [35S]sulfate, and Rab5-, Rab7-, and Rab9-positive vesicles were immunomagnet-isolated from cell homogenates as described previously (18Mani K. Cheng F. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 1251-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The vesicles were lysed, and their contents were chromatographed on Superose 6 under dissociative conditions (4 m guanidinium chloride, 0.2% Triton X-100 at pH 5.8). As shown previously (18Mani K. Cheng F. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 1251-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), a relatively homogenous pool of large [35S]sulfate-labeled oligosaccharides was present in the Rab5- and Rab7-positive vesicles but absent from the Rab9-positive vesicles. The major part of these oligosaccharides were in the Rab7-positive vesicles (Fig. 2A). Previous studies have shown that staining for anMan-positive HS degradation products is depressed in NO-depleted T24 cells (9Cheng F. Mani K. van den Born J. Ding K. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44431-44439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This is an indirect effect caused by depletion of Gpc-1-SNO and diminished capacity for deaminative autocleavage of HS. A more direct effect is obtained with U18666A, which inhibits NO release from Gpc-1-SNO and thereby reduces formation of anMan-containing HS oligosaccharides (18Mani K. Cheng F. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 1251-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Accordingly, when DFMO- and suramin-pretreated and [35S]sulfate-labeled T24 cells were exposed to U18666A, the total yield of intracellular [35S]sulfate-labeled oligosaccharides was reduced, especially in the Rab7-positive vesicles (Fig. 2B, solid line). As shown previously (17Mani K. Cheng F. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 18Mani K. Cheng F. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 1251-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), when U18666A-treated T24 cells are subsequently exposed to ascorbate, anMan-positive staining increases. Simultaneously, a heterogeneous population of [35S]sulfate-labeled degradation products was recovered from the Rab7-positive vesicles (Fig. 2, B, open symbols, and C, solid line). However, the amounts obtained gradually declined with time (Fig. 2C, dashed and dotted lines). Proteasomes can bind to Rab7-positive late endosomes, especially in the presence of proteasome inhibitors (20Dong J. Chen W. Welford A. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21334-21342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To examine if contact between endosomes and proteasomes affected deaminative HS cleavage, we reactivated this process in the presence of proteasome inhibitors. The content of Rab7-positive vesicles obtained from [35S]sulfate-labeled T24 cells treated with DFMO-, suramin-, U18666A-, and ascorbate in the presence of proteasome inhibitors was analyzed by gel chromatography on Superose 6. When proteasome activity was inhibited during a 4-h ascorbate treatment, there was a 2–3-"
https://openalex.org/W2085803426,"CD23 is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein synthesized by hematopoietic cells that has biological activity in both membrane-bound and freely soluble forms, acting via a number of receptors, including integrins. We demonstrate here that soluble CD23 (sCD23) sustains growth of human B cell precursors via an RGD-independent interaction with the αvβ5 integrin. The integrin recognizes a tripeptide motif in a small disulfide-bonded loop at the N terminus of the lectin head region of CD23, centered around Arg172, Lys173, and Cys174 (RKC). This RKC motif is present in all forms of sCD23 with cytokine-like activity, and cytokine activity is independent of the lectin head, an “inverse RGD” motif, and the CD21 and IgE binding sites. RKC-containing peptides derived from this region of CD23 bind αvβ5 and are biologically active. The binding and activity of these peptides is unaffected by inclusion of a short peptide containing the classic RGD sequence recognized by integrins, and, in far-Western analyses, RKC-containing peptides bind to the β subunit of the αvβ5 integrin. The interaction between αvβ5 and sCD23 indicates that integrins deliver to cells important signals initiated by soluble ligands without the requirement for interactions with RGD motifs in their common ligands. This mode of integrin signaling may not be restricted to αvβ5.

Although there are pronounced differences between the structures derived by the two methods, both show a generally consistent overall structure for the C-type lectin head domain comprising eight β sheets and two α helices (14Hibbert R.G.

The NMR structure reveals a striking distribution of acidic and basic residues on opposites faces of the lectin head domain and demonstrates unequivocally that the interaction surfaces for IgE and CD21 binding are spatially distinct (14Hibbert R.G.

The crystal structure confirms that CD23 contains only a single calcium binding site in the lectin head and that conformational changes in the CD23 structure accompany calcium coordination in this site (15Wurzburg B.A. Tarchevskaya S.S.

The binding site for integrins was not identified in either study, and, as reported here, this resides at the N-terminal region of the C-type lectin domain. The αvβ5 integrin is a member of the vitronectin receptor (VnR) family. VnRs are heterodimers of the αv integrin chain in association with any one of five β subunits (17van der Flier A. Sonnenberg A. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 305: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar) and have well documented roles in cell attachment, spreading, and migration, rescue from apoptosis, and angiogenesis (18Hood J.D.

VnRs bind to the extracellular matrix proteins vitronectin (Vn) and fibronectin (Fn) by recognition of an Arg-Lys-Asp (RGD) motif in target proteins (22Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1996; 12: 697-715Crossref Scopus (2588) Google Scholar); both the α and β integrin subunits contribute to ligand binding (23Xiong J.-P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R.

Arnout M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar). Integrins are known to bind to proteins via other peptide motifs (22Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1996; 12: 697-715Crossref Scopus (2588) Google Scholar), usually resulting in enhancement of the outcome of occupation of the RGD site. In particular, αvβ5 binds to a basic domain on the HIV Tat protein (25Vogel B.E. Lee S.J. Hildebrand A. Craig W. Pierschbecher M.D. Wong-Staal F. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), although no functional consequence for this interaction has been established. However, the greater affinity of αvβ5 for the Tat basic domain compared with an equivalent Vn domain (25Vogel B.E. Lee S.J. Hildebrand A. Craig W. Pierschbecher M.D. Wong-Staal F. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) suggests that ligands other than Vn could interact with the αvβ5 basic domain binding site and could have distinct signaling functions. This report demonstrates that the αvβ5 integrin interacts with sCD23 using a site distinct from the RGD binding pocket and that recognition of a basic motif on CD23 that is distinct from its interaction sites for IgE, CD21, or itself, enhances survival of human pre-B cells.

Vn was obtained from Invitrogen. Recombinant 25-kDa sCD23, encompassing residues Met151-Ser231 with an N-terminal His6 tag, was expressed in Escherichia coli and affinity-purified by nickel chelate chromatography, or was purchased from R&D Systems.

Cancer. 1984; 54: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar); Nalm-6 and Blin-1 cell lines were from laboratory stocks. Cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm fresh glutamine, and penicillin and streptomycin, at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 in air in a humidified atmosphere. Human telomerized fibroblasts were cultured as described previously (27Scott L.A. Vass J.K. Parkinson E.K. Gillespie D.A. Winnie J.N. Ozanne B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1540-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Cytokines, obtained from R&D Laboratories, were used at 5-10 ng/ml, but had no effect over a wide dose-response range. SMS-SB cells were also propagated in protein-free hybridoma medium-II (PFHM, Invitrogen), at 2.5-5 × 105 cells/ml (“normal cell density”). In stimulation experiments, SMS-SB cells were cultured at 2500 cells/100-μl culture (low cell density (LCD)) a seeding density at which the cells are prone to apoptosis (10White L.J. Ozanne B.W. Graber P. Aubry J.-P. Bonnefoy J.-Y. Cushley W. Blood. 1997; 90: 234-243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NALM-6 and Blin-1 cells were washed extensively in PFHM prior to culture at 2500 cells/100-μl culture. Cultures were propagated in the presence or absence of cytokines, mAbs or peptides, at 37 °C for 72 h followed by addition of 0.3 μCi/well tritiated thymidine ([3H]TdR) for 18 h prior to harvest; incorporation was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Integrin αv knockdown was achieved using siRNA targeting the sequence, 5′-AGCAACTTTATTATAGATTTA-3′ (Hs_ITGAV_1_HP siRNA), whereas the control non-silencing siRNA (cat. no. 1022076) targeted the sequence, 5′-AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT-3′.89 μl of 2 μm siRNA was diluted in 2.9 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (serum-free) then 44.5 μl of HiPerFect (Qiagen) was added prior to 10-min incubation at room temperature. This solution was added to a 10-cm plate that had been seeded 2 h previously with 6 × 105 cells in 12 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% (v/v) fetal calf serum. The medium was replaced 48 h later, and further control and silencing siRNA molecules were added as above. Cells were harvested after a further 24 h and analyzed for binding of CD23, peptides, and anti-αv integrin mAbs. For flow cytometry, 5 × 105 cells were stained with either FITC-conjugated or unlabeled primary mAb for 30-60 min; unlabeled primary antibody was visualized using a secondary FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or, in the case of biotinylated anti-αvβ5, using streptavidin-Quantum Red. Cells were analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer, using CellQuest software. Affinity Isolation and Analysis of Cellular Proteins—108 SMS-SB cells were harvested, washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, suspended in 1.5 ml of ice-cold OGP extraction buffer (1% (w/v) OGP in 50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4, 5 mm CaCl2, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm aprotinin, 1 mm leupeptin), and lysed with 40 strokes of a chilled glass homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant further was centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. Cellular extracts were added to bovine serum albumin-Affi-Gel pre-equilibrated with OGP extraction buffer and incubated at 4 °C for 6 h. The matrix was pelleted, and unbound proteins were recovered, added to pre-equilibrated sCD23-Affi-Gel, and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The sCD23-Affi-Gel was pelleted, and the unbound fraction was retained. Both matrices were exhaustively washed, and specifically bound material eluted by boiling in sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions on a 10% (w/v) acrylamide gel. Eluates were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with anti-VnR-component antibodies, followed by an HRP-labeled secondary antibody and ECL. For far-Western analysis, purified integrin proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were probed with biotinylated CD23-derived peptides, in the presence or absence of competing peptides, and binding was visualized using HRP-conjugated streptavidin and ECL. Areas of the peaks visualized by ECL/autoradiography were determined using ImageJ software. Lanes containing β5 bands were scanned, and identical peak widths were selected for calculation of areas under the selected β5 peaks. Peptide Biochemistry and Surface Plasmon Resonance Studies—A library of 83 overlapping nonapeptides encompassing residues 151-321 of the 25-kDa sCD23 sequence was synthesized by Mimotopes Inc. (Chester, UK); biotinylated and non-biotinylated peptides and peptides with specific substitutions were synthesized by the same firm. For screening experiments, each peptide was synthesized as tridecapeptide comprising a unique CD23-derived nonapeptide sequence, plus a common N-terminal tetrapeptide extension (SGSG) to which a biotin moiety was attached (i.e. biotin-SGSG-X9 where X9 is the specific CD23-derived nonapeptide sequence). The C-terminal residue was amidated. Each unique nonapeptide sequence had a two-residue C-terminal offset relative to its immediate neighbor. The specific nonapeptide sequences were #9, KWINFQRKC; #10, INFQRKCYY; #11, FQRKCYYFG; #12, RKCYYFGKG; #9AA, KWINFQAAC; and #12AA, AACYYFGKG; the LP long peptide sequence are KWINFQRKCYYFGKG. Biotinylated peptides were captured on 96-well streptavidin-coated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay trays and blocked with 1% (w/v) casein. Purified αvβ5 integrin (0.2 μg) was added to each well, and binding was quantitated by use of P1F6 mAb and HRP-anti-mouse IgG followed by tetramethylbenzidine as substrate. Binding of biotinylated peptides to cells was visualized with fluorochrome-conjugated streptavidin and flow cytometry; mean fluorescence intensity data were derived using the CellQuest program. In cell stimulation experiments, peptides were used in the 10 nm to 6 μm concentration range, and appropriate solvent vehicle controls (e.g. acetonitrile and Me2SO) were always performed. Biotinylated and non-biotinylated peptides provoked identical responses in functional assays. Interactions between CD23-derived peptides and αvβ5 integrin were assessed at 25 °C using a BIA-core 2000 instrument (Biacore AB). The αvβ5 integrin was immobilized at ∼4000 response units on a C1 chip, and an underivatized reference cell was employed as a control surface. CD23-derived peptides in HBS-EP buffer (0.01 m HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% (v/v) Surfactant P20) were injected over the test and control chip surfaces at a flow rate of 40 μl·min-1 with a 3-min association phase followed by a 6-min dissociation phase. In all experiments, peptides bound exclusively to the test cell, there was no nonspecific binding to the control reference cell, and regeneration of a stable baseline (using 0.2 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.5, where necessary) was readily achieved. Data were standardized according to standard double referencing data subtraction methods (28Myszka D.G. J. Mol. Recognit. 1999; 12: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), using control and blank injections, prior to kinetic analysis using BIAevaluation 3.0.2 software. The αvβ5 Integrin Is a CD23-binding Protein—Recombinant sCD23 rescues cultures of an acute lymphoblastic leukemia-derived human pre-B cell-like cell line, SMS-SB (26Smith R.G. Cancer. 1984; 54: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), from low cell density-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner (10White L.J. Ozanne B.W. Graber P. Aubry J.-P. Bonnefoy J.-Y. Cushley W. Blood. 1997; 90: 234-243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A, panel i); sCD23 is the only cytokine tested that rescues SMS-SB cells from apoptosis (Fig. 1A, panel ii). SMS-SB cells do not express CD23 itself or any of its known receptors (10White L.J. Ozanne B.W. Graber P. Aubry J.-P. Bonnefoy J.-Y. Cushley W. Blood. 1997; 90: 234-243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C, and data not shown), and this suggested that the interaction of sCD23 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia-derived pre-B cells was mediated via a hitherto undefined receptor. CD23-Affi-Gel affinity chromatography of lysates of [35S]methionine-labeled SMS-SB cells enriched two proteins of ∼120 and 80 kDa, molecular masses that are consistent with those of mature αv and β5 integrin proteins, respectively (data not shown). The interpretation that these two species were indeed αv and β5 was confirmed by performing CD23-Affi-Gel affinity chromatography on lysates of unlabeled cell extracts followed by Western blotting. Both αv and β5 proteins were detected in the eluate from the CD23 matrix but not in the eluate from the bovine serum albumin column (Fig. 1B). The polyclonal anti-αv antiserum used in this experiment (Fig. 1B, panel i) binds to a C-terminal epitope on αv that is located on the 25-kDa fragment generated during biosynthetic maturation of αv (29Suzuki S. Argraves W.S. Pytela R. Arai H. Krusius T. Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8614-8618Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). No β3 protein was detected in the eluate from the CD23-Affi-Gel column or in whole cell lysates (data not shown). SMS-SB cells stain with both the P1F6 mAb that recognizes the assembled αvβ5 heterodimer (30Wayner E.A. Orlando R.A. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), and anti-CD47 VnR-associated protein mAbs, but do not stain with the αvβ3-specific LM609 mAb (30Wayner E.A. Orlando R.A. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). Reverser transcription-PCR analysis of SMS-SB RNA yielded amplicons of the expected sizes for CD47, CD51/αv, β1 and β5, but no correctly sized PCR products were detected for β3, β6, or β8 coding sequences (data not shown). The demonstration that SMS-SB cells express αvβ5 and that it interacts with CD23 suggests that this integrin is linked to pre-B cell growth and survival. To test this proposal, SMS-SB cells were incubated with αvβ5-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb) or with Vn and Fn, the normal ligands for αvβ5. Incubation with the αv-specific mAb AMF7 stimulated proliferation of SMS-SB cells in response to increasing concentrations of mAb, whereas an isotype-matched control mAb was without effect (Fig. 2A). Importantly, a second pre-B cell line, NALM-6, also showed enhanced proliferation when stimulated by the AMF7 mAb (Fig. 2B). The 15F11 mAb that recognizes fully assembled αvβ5 heterodimers but does not impede αvβ5 binding to Vn (31Stuiver I. Smith J.W. Hybridoma. 1995; 14: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), stimulated SMS-SB proliferation (Fig. 2C). However, the P1F6 mAb, which recognizes a distinct epitope on assembled αvβ5 heterodimers and does inhibit αvβ5 binding to Vn (30Wayner E.A. Orlando R.A. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), failed to stimulate proliferation (Fig. 2C). These data are reminiscent of those of Hermann and colleagues (13Hermann P. Armant M. Brown E. Rubio M. Ishihara H. Ulrich D. Caspary R.G. Lindberg F.P. Armitage R. Maliszewski C. Delespesse G. Sarfati M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 767-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) who demonstrated that an anti-αvβ3 reagent directed to the RGD binding site could not impede CD23-driven production of cytokine release by monocytic cells. Moreover, finding that neither Vn nor Fn stimulated proliferation of SMS-SB cells (Fig. 2D) supports the contention that the binding sites for RGD-containing ligands and sCD23 are distinct. These data show that αvβ5 regulates a pro-survival response in pre-B cell lines and that this response seems to be both ligand-selective and potentially independent of the integrin binding site for RGD. The lack of an RGD sequence in sCD23 suggests that the motif on CD23 recognized by the integrin is not an RGD-related sequence (see Fig. 3B; there is an inverse RGD sequence of DGR but this is, of course, stereochemically different to RGD). One precedent for such recognition is the non-RGD-dependent interaction of αvβ5 with a basic motif of the HIV Tat protein (25Vogel B.E. Lee S.J. Hildebrand A. Craig W. Pierschbecher M.D. Wong-Staal F. Ruoslahti E. J.

A library of 83 biotinylated overlapping nonapeptides was constructed based on the 25-kDa sCD23 sequence (Fig. 3A) and probed with purified αvβ5 to identify binding sites for the integrin. Purified αvβ5 binds specifically and consistently to a series of four adjacent peptides (peptides #9 -#12) encompassing residues Lys166-Gly180 (data not shown), and the sole feature common to these four peptides is a tri-peptide of sequence Arg-Lys-Cys (RKC) beginning at Arg172 in the CD23 sequence. The structural data for sCD23 (14Hibbert R.G. Teriete P. Grundy G.J. Beavil R.L. Reljic R. Holers V.M. Hannan J.P. Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. McDonnell J.M. J. Exp.

Here we report that photolysis of a double-caged form of the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) triggers focal calcium release in Purkinje cell somata, dendrites, and spines as measured by two-photon microscopy. In calbindin knock-out Purkinje cells, peak calcium increased with flash energy with higher cooperativity for double-caged IP3 than for conventional single-caged IP3, consistent with a chemical two-photon effect. Spine photolysis of double-caged IP3 led to local calcium release. Uncaging of glycerophosphoryl-myo-inositol 4,5-bisphosphate (gPIP2), a poorly metabolizable IP3 analog, led to less well localized release. Thus, IP3 breakdown is necessary for spine-specificity. IP3- and gPIP2-evoked signals declined from peak with similar, slow time courses, indicating that release lasts hundreds of milliseconds and is terminated not by IP3 degradation but by intrinsic receptor dynamics. Based on measurements of spine-dendrite coupling, IP3-evoked calcium signals are expected to be at least 2.4-fold larger in their spine of origin than in nearby spines, allowing IP3 to act as a synapse-specific second messenger. Unexpectedly, single-caged IP3 led to less release in somata and was ineffective in dendrites and spines. Calcium release using caged gPIP2 was inhibited by the addition of single-caged IP3, suggesting that single-caged IP3 is an antagonist of calcium release. Caging at multiple sites may be an effective general approach to reducing residual receptor interaction.

Caging at multiple sites may be an effective general approach to reducing residual receptor interaction. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate binds to receptors on internal organelles, triggering calcium (Ca2+) release from stores and thus elevating cytoplasmic calcium concentration. Calcium elevation can trigger a wide variety of physiological responses in many cell types (1Carafoli E. Klee C.B. Calcium as a Cellular Regulator. Oxford University Press, New York1999Google Scholar). In neurons, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-triggered calcium release can be extremely rapid, beginning considerably less than 100 ms after synaptic activity (2Takechi H. Eilers J. Konnerth A. Nature. 1998; 396: 757-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 3Finch E.A. Augustine G.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 753-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 4Wang S.S.-H. Denk W. Häusser M. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1266-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Such a rapid response implies that IP3 2The abbreviations used are:gPIP2glycerophosphoryl-myo-inositol 4,5-bisphosphateNPE1-(2-nitrophenyl)ethylIP3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphateCFclimbing fiber. is produced within 10s of ms of receptor activation. Furthermore, calcium release mechanisms nearly always have strong inactivation mechanisms that can depend on recent activation. Therefore, the rapid kinetics of IP3 concentration and receptor dynamics are key determinants of the properties of calcium release. glycerophosphoryl-myo-inositol 4,5-bisphosphate 1-(2-nitrophenyl)ethyl inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate climbing fiber. The properties of IP3-dependent calcium release may guide the properties of synaptic plasticity. In cerebellar Purkinje cells, which strongly express IP3 receptors, IP3 receptor-mediated calcium release is necessary for the induction of long-term depression of parallel fiber synapses (5Khodakhah K. Armstrong C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14009-14014Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 6Inoue T. Kato K. Kohda K. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5366-5373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Calcium release in dendritic spines is thought to act as a coincidence detector between parallel fiber activity, which generates IP3, and climbing fiber activity, which causes calcium entry that boosts release by acting on the IP3 receptor (4Wang S.S.-H. Denk W. Häusser M. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1266-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 7Ito M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 896-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In this model the duration of IP3 receptor activation should shape the timing conditions under which parallel fiber and climbing fiber activity are able to work together to generate maximal calcium release. Probing IP3 receptor dynamics in spines in situ would provide strong constraints to the model. A critical advance in understanding calcium signaling responses to fast patterns of IP3 production has come as a result of the development of caged compounds (8Lester H.A. Nerbonne J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1982; 11: 151-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 9Adams S.R. Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 755-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 10Nerbonne J.M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Caged compounds are signaling molecules rendered biologically inactive by the addition of a light-sensitive group. Upon absorption of a photon in the near ultraviolet, the caged compound undergoes internal photolysis, cleaving the cage group and generating active molecules. When the light comes in the form of a flash, the production of messenger is rapid, and with a focused beam such as from a laser, submicron spatial resolution is possible. In the case of IP3, the standard caging approach has been to add a 1-(2-nitrophenyl)ethyl (NPE) group at the 4 or 5 position (11Walker J.W. Somlyo A.V. Goldman Y.E. Somlyo A.P. Trentham D.R. Nature. 1987; 327: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). “Single-caged” IP3 produced in this way does not activate IP3 receptors, photolyses in milliseconds, and largely does not interfere with IP3 metabolism by kinases and phosphatases (though in the case of 5-NPE-IP3 see (12Walker J.W. Feeney J. Trentham D.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3272-3280Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar)). Single-caged IP3 has been successfully applied to the study of signaling in smooth muscle (13McCarron J.G. MacMillan D. Bradley K.N. Chalmers S. Muir T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8417-8427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), cell nuclei (14Leite M.F. Thrower E.C. Echevarria W. Koulen P. Hirata K. Bennett A.M. Ehrlich B.E.

Llano I.I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 510: 499-512Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and astrocytes (18Fiacco T.A. McCarthy K.D. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 722-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). As a means of controlling calcium release in neurons, we made double-caged IP3, a form that is caged at both the 4 and 5 positions. This compound is structurally less similar than single-caged IP3 to IP3 and, therefore, should be less likely to interfere with IP3 receptors or degradative enzymes. In addition, double-caged compounds allow an approach, termed chemical two-photon uncaging, that has several advantages. First, the requirement for removing two cage groups gives positive cooperativity, and therefore, in response to focused flashes, spatial resolution in both lateral and axial directions is improved (19Pettit D.L. Wang S.S.-H. Gee K.R. Augustine G.J. Neuron. 1997; 19: 465-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Second, because each molecule bears two cage groups, small amounts of uncaging that occur during routine handling or after solvation in water produce lower levels of residual IP3. In this study we report the first use of double-caged IP3 in the study of intracellular calcium release. We find that in cerebellar Purkinje neurons, double-caged IP3 is more potent than single-caged IP3 in triggering flash-induced calcium release. In addition, double-caged IP3 can activate release in dendritic locations remote from the cell body, but single-caged IP3 cannot. These phenomena can be explained by a blocking action by single-caged IP3 on calcium release. The improved effectiveness of double-caged IP3 makes it the preferred reagent for rapid control over IP3-dependent calcium release in neurons. Finally, we use double-caged IP3 to probe the synapse specificity of calcium release in single dendritic spines. Preparation of Caged IP3 Compounds—Synthesis of caged compounds was done under incandescent light. Five mg of IP3 (Mr 551.99, LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA) was dissolved in 500 μl of H2O, and the pH was adjusted to 4.5 with HCl. 1-(Nitrophenyl)-diazoethane was prepared by mixing 0.18 g of the hydrazone of 2-nitrosoacetophenone with 0.7 g of MnO2 in 20 ml of ether, mixing vigorously for 5–10 min, and filtering the mixture. IP3 was pipetted into the 1-(2-nitrophenyl)-diazoethane. The volume was reduced by blowing compressed nitrogen over the mixture, which was then covered with glass wool and mixed vigorously overnight. Unreacted 1-(2-nitrophenyl)-diazoethane was extracted with methylene chloride. Caged compounds were purified by high performance liquid chromatography on a Partisil 10 SAX column (initial condition 0.12 m NH4H2PO4/NH4HPO4, pH 5.4, 30% methanol) (12Walker J.W. Feeney J. Trentham D.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3272-3280Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The sample was injected, and after 5 min, a 15-min linear gradient was begun to a final condition of 0.6 m NH4H2PO4/NH4HPO4, pH 5.4, 30% methanol. The column was monitored by absorption at 260 nm. The peak at 5–7 min was taken as triple-NPE-caged IP3. Triple-caged IP3 was photolyzed 6 × 30 s with a handheld ultraviolet lamp. Fractions were collected with the following migration times: 5–7 min, triple-caged IP3, 1,4-double-caged IP3, and 1,5-double-caged IP3; 8–10 min, 4,5-double-caged IP3; 14–15 min, 5-caged IP3; 15–16 min, 4-caged IP3; 16–17 min, 1-caged IP3. Fractions from multiple runs were pooled, and the high performance liquid chromatography solvent was then removed using a DEAE-cellulose column at 4 °C. Caged IP3 compounds were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m tetraethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) more than 100 min. TEAB was removed by rotary evaporation under vacuum. The compound was resuspended in distilled water and stored at -20 °C. Slice Preparation—Sagittal 300-μm-thick cerebellar brain slices were cut from 17–21-day-old rats or 2–3-month-old calbindin knock-out mice (strain B6.129-Calb1tm1Mpin/J; The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing 126 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 20 mm d-glucose, 25 mm NaHCO3, 2 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2 and saturated with 95% O2, 5% CO2. Slices were preincubated at 34 °C for 40–60 min and then kept at room temperature throughout the experiment. Electrophysiology—For recording, slices were transferred to an immersion-type recording chamber perfused at 2–4 ml/min with artificial cerebrospinal fluid solution saturated with 95% O2, 5% CO2. Purkinje cells were visually patched with recording electrodes pulled from 1-mm borosilicate glass to a resistance of 4–7 megaohms. Electrophysiological signals were acquired with an Axopatch 200B amplifier and Clampex 8.0 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). The patch electrode was filled with a patch solution containing (pH was adjusted to 7.3 with KOH) 133 mm methanesulfonic acid, 7.4 mm KCl, 0.3 mm MgCl2, 3 mm Na2ATP, and 0.3 mm Na3GTP along with 300 μm calcium indicator fluo-5F (Invitrogen) and one of the following caged compounds: 5-caged IP3, a mixture of 4- and 5-caged IP3, 4,5-double-caged IP3, caged glycerophosphoryl-myo-inositol 4,5-bisphosphate (gPIP2), or commercially obtained single-caged IP3 (Invitrogen), which is a mixture of 4 and 5 isomers. In some experiments aurintricarboxylic acid, ammonium salt (ATA; Sigma) was used to block IP3 breakdown. After whole-cell break-in, cells were held in current clamp mode for at least 40 min to allow diffusion of the dye and caged compound to the distal dendrites and spines. Holding currents at -65 mV were -50 to -400 pA, and series resistances were 20–30 megaohms. Series resistance was monitored periodically and compensated by balancing the bridge. Two-photon Microscopy and Focal Uncaging—Two-photon fluorescence imaging was done using a custom-built microscope controlled by CfNT software (M. Müller, Max Planck Institute for Medical Research, Heidelberg, Germany). 830-nm excitation light from a Mira 900 Ti:sapphire laser (Coherent Inc., Auburn, CA) was focused onto the brain slice by 63× 0.9 NA water immersion objective (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). For focal uncaging (20Sarkisov D.V. Wang S.S.-H. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 828-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) the output of a UV laser (DPSS Lasers, Santa Clara, CA) was attenuated by a polarizing beam splitter, widened by a 5× beam expander (CVI Laser Corp., Albuquerque, NM) to fill the back aperture of the objective, and merged with the excitation beam using a dichroic mirror (Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT). To compensate for the focal plane shift between uncaging and excitation light, the uncaging beam was slightly converged by adjusting the beam expander. The parfocality of the uncaging spot and the image plane was tested by uncaging in a sample of caged fluorescein dextran solution dried onto a test slide. Flash energies were calculated from energies arriving at the backplane of the objective multiplied by the 70% transmittance of the objective. For focal uncaging in different cell regions, a procedure was usually employed in which uncaging was attempted first in the soma or main dendrites. If measurable responses were observed in these structures, then uncaging attempts were made in fine spiny branchlets and single spines. In some double-caged IP3 experiments, uncaging was done only in spiny branchlets and spines. Data Analysis—Full-frame images were acquired at a speed of 5 ms per line (512 pixels/line) or 2 ms per line (128 pixels/line). Fluorescence data were processed using Igor Pro software (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). ΔF/F0 traces were filtered by convolving with a hanning window of width 5 samples (Figs. 2 and 5) or 11 samples (Fig. 4). Peak fluorescence was defined as the maximum value after 11-sample filtering. Response area was integrated over 200 ms after the UV flash. The initial response slope was defined as the slope of the linear fit between 15 and 85% of peak response. The response latency was defined as ending when the unfiltered trace went more than 1.5 S.D. above preflash baseline for three consecutive samples, taking the middle of the three samples. For purposes of scoring uncaging trials, a successful trial was defined as one that triggered a peak fluorescence change of 50%ΔF/F0 or greater. For measuring the dependence of response size on flash energy (Fig. 2), curves for individual locations were normalized by flash energy to minimize the uncertainty of a power fit to pooled data. Except where otherwise indicated, all statistical comparisons are one-tailed tests.FIGURE 5Delays to calcium rise observed using single-caged and double-caged IP3. a and b, sample traces showing decreasing latency with higher uncaging energies with 100 μm double-caged IP3 (a) and single-caged IP3 (b). c, graph of estimated [IP3] as a function of flash energy for single-caged (sc) and double-caged (dc) IP3.

Ogden D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 487: 343-358Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The availability of multiple measurements using single-caged IP3 was used to calculate the uncertainty in overall fits and in IP3 concentration. With 100 μm single-caged IP3 in the pipette and uncaging in the soma, calcium response latencies were measured in response to varying pulse energies. IP3 concentration would be expected to increase with pulse energy P as (IP3) = C(1 - e-P/g), where C is the concentration of single-caged IP3, and g is the energy to photolyze 1 - 1/e of the cage groups. g was varied to determine a best fit for [IP3] to single-caged IP3 latency data. The resulting uncaging efficiency factor was g = 0.59 ± 0.07 μJ over a range of pulse energies of 0.3–1.0 μJ. This calibration was then applied to double-caged IP3 experiments to calculate the IP3 concentration as [IP3] = C(1 - e-P/g)2. The caged compounds used in this study are shown in Fig. 1a, in which modifications to the phosphate groups at positions 1, 4, and 5 are indicated as R1, R2, and R3, respectively. The 4,5-biphosphate motif has been found to be necessary for IP3 receptor activation (12Walker J.W. Feeney J. Trentham D.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3272-3280Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 22Wilcox R.A. Primrose W.U. Nahorski S.R. Challiss R.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 467-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and modification at the 1-position has been shown to moderately affect the potency of receptor activation and strongly inhibit metabolism by 3-kinases and 5-phosphatases (23Bird G.S. Obie J.F. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17722-17725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IP3 caged with NPE groups at either the 4 or 5 position (single-caged IP3) was synthesized or obtained commercially as a mixture of the two isomers. NPE-caged glycerophosphoryl-myo-inositol 4,5-bisphosphate (caged-gPIP2) (23Bird G.S. Obie J.F. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17722-17725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained commercially. IP3 caged with NPE groups at both the both the 4 and 5 positions (“double-caged IP3”) was synthesized by preparation of triple-caged IP3 followed by partial photolysis. Photolysis and measurement of calcium release was performed on a system (Fig. 1b) in which an ultraviolet laser beam was directed into the focal plane of a two-photon microscope and a brain slice chamber (Fig. 1c), thus achieving submicron resolution of both uncaging and fluorescence measurement (average half-maximal width of fluorescent spot after uncaging = 0.59 μm; Fig. 1d). To test the ability of double-caged IP3 to trigger calcium release, we recorded from Purkinje neurons, which express IP3 receptors at extremely high density (24Satoh T. Ross C.A. Villa A. Supattapone S. Pozzan T. Snyder S.H. Meldolesi J. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 615-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), using whole-cell patch recording. Patch electrodes contained 100 μm double-caged IP3 with 300 μm fluo-5F added to monitor changes in cytoplasmic calcium. Under these conditions all parts of the cell, including dendrites and spines, were visible (Fig. 1c), indicating perfusion with patch solution. In observations of the cell body by two-photon fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2a), light pulses (0.13–1.0 μJ) generated reproducible sudden elevations in calcium that began 10–100 ms after the pulse (15 locations in 10 cells). Maximum responses were 600 ± 250 (mean ± S.D.) % ΔF/F0 above baseline fluorescence (n = 7, 1 cell body and 6 dendrites). Thus photolysis of double-caged IP3 can trigger robust calcium release signals in Purkinje neurons. In previous studies using conventional single-caged IP3, the kinetics of photolysis-driven calcium release were shown to depend strongly on IP3 concentration (21Khodakhah K. Ogden D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 487: 343-358Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We found likewise that photolyzing increasing amounts of double-caged IP3 triggered progressively faster-rising and larger calcium transients (Fig. 2b), with half-maximal responses reached using flash energies of 0.36 ± 0.05 μJ (mean ± S.D., for half-maximal rate of rise of response), 0.27 ± 0.02 μJ (mean ± S.D., for half-maximal peak of response), and 0.24 ± 0.03 μJ (mean ± S.D., for half-maximal total area of response integrated over time; n = 2 locations in 1 primary dendrite and 1 cell body). Because two photolysis events at a double-caged IP3 molecule are required to generate one molecule of IP3, the dependence of the amount of calcium released on flash energy would be expected to show more cooperativity (19Pettit D.L. Wang S.S.-H. Gee K.R. Augustine G.J. Neuron. 1997; 19: 465-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) for double-caged IP3 than for single-caged IP3. However, in wild-type rats, for a range of flash energies up to saturating levels, only a weak difference was observed (Fig. 2c), with a log-log slope 2.53 ± 0.19 for double-caged IP3 (44 responses at 4 locations in 3 cells) versus 2.42 ± 0.20 for single-caged IP3 (18 responses, 2 locations in 2 cells; comparison with double-caged IP3 p = 0.36, one-tailed test). Measurements of cytoplasmic calcium in wild-type tissue may not scale linearly with the amount of calcium released because of the presence of the calcium buffer proteins calbindin and parvalbumin, which are plentiful in Purkinje cells (25Fierro L. Llano I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 496: 617-625Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 26Schmidt H. Stiefel K.M. Racay P. Schwaller B. Eilers J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 551: 13-32Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In particular, calbindin has fast binding kinetics and can suppress submicromolar fast-rising calcium transients but not larger ones, thus leading to positive cooperativity at a step downstream of calcium mobilization (27Maeda H. Ellis-Davies G.C. Ito K. Miyashita Y. Kasai H. Neuron. 1999; 24: 989-1002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This effect would tend to be independent of and, thus, mask any differences between the observed flash energy dependence of single-caged and double-caged responses. Such an effect would not be expected of parvalbumin, whose binding on-kinetics are entirely slow (28Lee S.H. Schwaller B. Neher E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 525: 419-432Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We therefore made comparisons between single-caged and double-caged IP3 in knock-out mice lacking calbindin (Figs. 2, d and e). In calbindin knock-out mice differences between double-caged IP3 and single-caged IP3 were seen in the dependence of both the total area of response (Fig. 2d; log-log slope 3.08 ± 0.19 in double-caged IP3 versus 1.40 ± 0.11 in single-caged IP3; ratio of slopes = 2.20 ± 0.22, greater than 1, p < 0.01, two-tailed test) and the peak of fluorescence signal (Fig. 2e; log-log slope 1.22 ± 0.14 in single-caged IP3, 34 responses at 5 locations in 1 cell, normalized to saturated peak responses of 340 ± 70% ΔF/F0; 2.75 ± 0.23 in double-caged IP3, 47 responses at 5 locations in 1 cell, normalized to saturated peak responses of 350 ± 40% ΔF/F0; ratio of slopes = 2.26 ± 0.31, greater than 1, p < 0.01, two-tailed test) on flash energy. The ratios of slopes are indistinguishable from 2 (p = 0.32 for peak response and p = 0.36 for area), consistent with the expectation that physiological effects produced by chemical two-photon uncaging should have a dependence on flash energy that is the square of the dependence seen with conventional uncaging (19Pettit D.L. Wang S.S.-H. Gee K.R. Augustine G.J. Neuron. 1997; 19: 465-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). IP3 receptors are expressed abundantly throughout Purkinje cells, including dendrites and dendritic spines (24Satoh T. Ross C.A. Villa A. Supattapone S. Pozzan T. Snyder S.H. Meldolesi J. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 615-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Because calcium release is necessary for inducing synaptic long-term depression at synaptic inputs impinging on spiny dendrites (3Finch E.A. Augustine G.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 753-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 4Wang S.S.-H. Denk W. Häusser M. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1266-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 5Khodakhah K.

A. 1997; 94: 14009-14014Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we tested the ability of single-caged IP3 and double-caged IP3 to trigger calcium release in dendrites and single spines (Fig. 3 and Table 1). We performed uncaging in 12 cells filled with 100 μm single-caged IP3, 7 cells filled with 300 μm single-caged IP3, and 78 cells filled with 100 μm double-caged IP3. A successful uncaging response was defined as one in which the peak fluorescence exceeded 50%ΔF/F0. We successfully evoked calcium responses in at least one location (soma, dendrite, or spine) in 92% of cells (11 of 12) filled with 100 μm single-caged IP3, 86% of cells (6 of 7) filled with 300 μm single-caged IP3, and 99% of cells (77 of 78) filled with 100 μm double-caged IP3.TABLE 1Success rate of flash-evoked responses from focal photolysis of caged inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate agonists A successful trial was defined as one that triggered a peak fluorescence change of 50% ΔF/F0 or greater.

https://openalex.org/W1983156083,"Big pharma is increasingly looking to academia for new drug leads and technologies; meanwhile universities are being forced to look beyond the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for funding. This mutual attraction-out-of-necessity is helping to forge new bonds between industry and academia. Big pharma is increasingly looking to academia for new drug leads and technologies; meanwhile universities are being forced to look beyond the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for funding. This mutual attraction-out-of-necessity is helping to forge new bonds between industry and academia. The notion of a blockbuster drug that generates more than $1 billion in revenue a year for a big pharma company is waning. Both the business model that produces these monster money-makers as well as the technology underlying drug R&D appear to be positioned to make blockbusters a by-product rather than a goal of a changing system. “Pharma is not depending on the blockbuster, they moved away from that strategy,” says Kenneth Kaitin, director of the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development in Boston. In addition to the expense of developing drugs with broad indications for large patient populations, the same type of drugs tend to hit the marketplace at the same time, creating a horse race between companies that escalates marketing costs, says Kaitin. And against the odds, if a drug does become a blockbuster, “the company becomes in an unhealthy way reliant upon that product,” he says. Additionally, “when the drug goes off patent, the company suffers.” Points out Simon Goodall, leader of Boston Consulting Group's (BCG) biopharmaceutical R&D practice, “Obviously, if you can I.D. and develop a blockbuster, it's still valuable for a portfolio… But the business model itself is breaking down. Nobody has the answer yet. You can't point to a company that has the new business model.” The pressure to change business models is also being driven by what lies ahead: loss of patent protection for some notable blockbusters following the examples of Zoloft (Pfizer) and Pravachol (Bristol-Myers Squibb) and potentially fewer new molecular entities or NMEs—molecules containing no active moiety with physiological/pharmacological action that is already approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Indeed, between 2002 and 2005 there were 87 NMEs approved by the FDA, compared to 116 from 1998–2001 and 142 from 1994–1997. Almost $40 billion in revenue for the top pharmaceutical companies is at risk due to patent expiration in 2010 alone, according to BCG. And for the period 2011–2015, the dollar loss due to patent expiration is estimated at ∼$28 billion annually. In the past, big pharma would have turned to biotech to pump up its slowing pipeline of new drugs. It is still doing so, but the pickings are getting slim as companies with promising therapeutics and technologies get spoken for. This is a “problem, as more companies are bidding for fewer and fewer assets in biotech, it's not sustainable,” says Robert Ruffolo, president of R&D for Wyeth Pharmaceuticals in Collegeville, PA. “Big pharma is paying lots of money, and it can't fill a pipeline by doing so, it's too expensive.” At the same time, biotech itself is changing. “Biotech in the 90s was the middleman,” says James Wells, director of the small molecule discovery center at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). “But the middlemen have gone away. Middlemen became pharma, it's now bio-pharma. Biotech is so product-driven right now. Now companies pitch to investors about development-specific assets: develop for two years, sell and it's over. It's almost like the business model in motion pictures, you create this little company for two years, you create a picture, it's out and it disbands.” Wells, formerly a senior scientist at Genentech and president of Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, doesn't necessarily think this is bad for biotech. “The market will tell,” he says. “Maybe nothing is wrong with that, though [it opens] an early-technology void.” To fill that void, both big pharma and biotech are looking more intensely to academia. “There is competition between biotech and pharma for university technology,” says Paul Pospisil, a managing partner in Aduro Capital, a venture capital firm in New York City. Biotech has always gone to academia for technology and drug leads, says Pospisil, but what has shifted now is that “pharma is willing to take on academic research earlier than it would have maybe 15 years ago, when it would take up where biology was already well established.” Between 2000 and 2005, university and institution invention disclosures by respondents to a US licensing survey increased steadily from ∼12,000 to more than 17,000, according to the Association of University Technology Managers (http://www.autm.net/pdfs/AUTM_LS_05_US.pdf). New patents filed also rose from ∼6,000 in 2000 to ∼10,000 in 2005. “There's a lot of insight left on the table at academic labs” with the potential for contributing to new drug leads or technology, says Merv Turner, senior vice president for worldwide licensing and external research at Merck. Since 2000, the public markets have ceased to be an exit strategy for biotech companies, so they are looking to mergers and acquisitions with pharmaceutical companies to build equity value, Turner says, and as a result venture capitalists are no longer focusing their funds on early-stage drug discovery. “So for academic researchers it is harder to see their innovations reach development.” To tap into this trend, Merck is developing a system of scouts based in Boston, San Diego, Japan, and the UK. “Five years ago my job didn't exist,” says Reid J. Leonard, a scout and executive director for licensing and external research at Merck Research Laboratories in Boston. “We are looking for opportunity extensions of our science outreach for licensing, organized around geography rather than therapeutic area. What I do is very similar to what a person with my background would do in a venture capital firm. I really am the first part of engagement on novel opportunity.” Leonard says that they have concentrated their outreach on licensing and will be expanding to a systemic approach working with academic scientists on biomarkers, target identification and validation, and methodologies for carrying out proof-of-concept studies. Merck, of course, is not alone in their outreach efforts. Novartis, Pfizer, and Amgen have also set up a presence in the Boston area, an ideal location because of its proximity to leading universities and medical centers. The interest works both ways, especially as NIH funding has remained relatively flat since 2003—the fiscal year 2007 NIH budget is estimated at $29.2 billion versus $27.2 billion in 2003 (http://www.aaas.org/spp/rd/health08p.pdf). When inflation is factored in, this actually represents a 16% decrease, according to an analysis in the May 2007 Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA 297,1867). “Academic labs flailing along are looking to how they can move a little further downstream to make themselves more attractive to companies,” says Karen Bernstein, editor-in-chief of the biotechnology industry newsletter BioCentury based in Belmont, CA. Is it through “more animal models? More chemistry to present the commercial world with a more fully developed molecule? The answer is not in yet.” Traditionally university tech transfer offices push technology toward industry, but the challenge remains to fund post-NIH but precommercial research in the first place, says Isaac T. Kohlberg, chief technology development officer at Harvard University. “How do you bridge this gap so the technology doesn't wind up in death valley?” As big pharma moves toward academia, universities are also reaching out. One strategy is Harvard's Accelerator Fund, which seeks to raise $15 million to allocate to translational research. To date about $5 million has been raised, says Kohlberg, and approximately $1.25 million is expected to be distributed to five or six projects this year. The funds are raised from philanthropic sources as gifts, says Larry Schlossman, a director at Harvard's office of technology development. Examples of projects eligible for funding include the design and synthesis of small-molecule inhibitors of drug targets, testing of monoclonal antibodies, testing of lead small molecules in animal models of disease, and medicinal chemistry followup of hits from drug target screening assays (http://www.techaccelerator.harvard.edu/guidelines.php). Final selection will be made by a committee of venture capitalists, industry executives, and Harvard faculty, says Schlossman. At Stanford, researchers are taking matters into their own hands and looking for orphan technologies that sit in the tech transfer office but have yet to be claimed by a company. The technologies selected get one year of funding from the university and, perhaps as importantly, says program founder Daria Mochly-Rosen, mentoring by faculty with company experience. Mochly-Rosen, a professor in the department of chemical and systems biology at Stanford University School of Medicine, started this so-called SPARK program out of frustration with trying to get companies interested in her protein kinase C research. “Protein kinase C showed it can limit damage to the heart after a heart attack,” says Mochly-Rosen. “I thought Stanford was doing a poor job in finding a partner, so I tried. And I found Stanford was doing a good job and industry wasn't interested. It didn't see a kinase as a drug.” She ended up founding her own company, KAI Pharmaceuticals, where she worked for a year. Upon returning to Stanford, she wanted to use her newfound industry insight to help fellow academic researchers. If a new drug target or technology “doesn't look like, smell like, or walk like a duck,” then industry is reluctant to develop it, says Mochly-Rosen. So the goal was to pick promising but neglected technologies and work with the investigators to give them more company appeal. Mochly-Rosen asked people from industry to whittle down approximately 470 unlicensed patents from Stanford's office of technology licensing to 40, and then six. She called the investigators. “We didn't expect faculty [to work on the technology], only post docs, but we were surprised, there is faculty, too, on every project.” SPARK projects include a hepatitis C treatment, antiaging drug discovery, protease-based diagnostics and therapeutics, diagnostics for kidney transplant rejection and pancreatitis, and targeting of the unfolded protein response for treating cancer. Mochly-Rosen calls SPARK an experiment, and the odds against a company picking up one or more of the six projects are very high. But “via teaching criteria, we are already successful,” she says. “As a university, we teach a lot of scientists to be academicians but many of our students wind up in industry and we don't train them. People are leaving [SPARK] with what they hadn't learned before.” One example is a drug package insert that accompanies prescription medication and offers pharmacological and clinical information, which Mochly-Rosen asked the researchers to write. “It made them realize that industry is working from the end. This is very different than the academia hypothesis-driven” approach, she says. Craig Garner, a developmental neurobiologist at Stanford, was approached by Mochly-Rosen. His research focuses on manipulating inhibition associated with the neurotransmitter GABA as a cognitive treatment for Down's syndrome. “Over a year ago, we wrote a use patent and sent it out to more than 150 companies. One said it was interested but wanted even more basic information; they liked the idea but wanted to decrease risk.” SPARK mentors reviewed his material and worked with him to position it for industry. “The faculty are not really aware of what biotech wants,” says Garner. As a result, the research is “seldom placed in a format to allow [industry] to say ahh, this is one for me.” The patent had a “first exposure through the office of technology licensing, and this was not in a way the community saw was important,” he says. SPARK, as well as subsequent publication and media coverage, broadened the exposure, and six additional companies expressed interest. Other programs designed to connect academia more closely with industry include those at The Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, CA and the J. David Gladstone Institutes in San Francisco, both of which have made exclusive licensing deals with pharmaceutical companies, says UCSF's James Wells. The Gladstone, for example, has a collaboration and licensing agreement with Merck for the research and development of drugs to treat neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, that are linked to ApoE-associated mechanisms. Merck receives worldwide exclusive license to research, develop, and commercialize compounds resulting from the collaboration; Gladstone receives a $3.25 million upfront payment, milestone fees, as well as an annual licensing fee and royalties on any marketed product stemming from the agreement. Wells also points to the Broad Institute in Cambridge, MA, a collaboration between MIT and Harvard, as adopting some lessons from industry to apply genomic research to medical problems. “In a way, [the Broad is] set up like minipharma,” says Wells. “They have functional departments like an academic institution but are matrixed around project areas and grants like pharma.” BCG's Simon Goodall points to the Myelin Repair Foundation in Saratoga, CA as another research model merging industry and academic approaches to move basic research from the lab to the clinic, in this case focusing on treatments for multiple sclerosis. The nonprofit foundation pools the research efforts of scientists from Stanford, McGill, Case Western Reserve, Northwestern, and the University of Chicago while aggressively managing the intellectual property to apply for patents and engage in early discussions with pharmaceutical companies with the goal of accelerating discoveries toward the clinic. Technology itself is also forcing academic and private for-profit labs into relationships. “We used to be able to bring new technology into our own labs—cloning and genetic manipulation,” for example, says Joan Brugge, professor and chair of the department of cell biology at Harvard Medical School. “But now it is so advanced: imaging and microscopy and engineering approaches” that collaborations need to move beyond traditionally associated groups. “The interactions [with companies] were much more service-oriented” ten years ago, adds Brugge. “Now interactions are [more] about discovery… [and] a dynamic exchange of ideas.” Kenneth Kaitin at Tufts points out that genomics and personalized medicine are also pushing organizations together. One example is The RNAi Consortium (TRC), a public-private partnership formed in 2005 by the Broad Institute and including companies such as Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, and Novartis. TRC aims to create a shared library of small hairpin RNAs to target 15,000 human genes and 15,000 mouse genes. This ambitious 3-year plan costing $18 million is partly financed by contributions of $3.6 million from company member organizations (http://www.broad.mit.edu/genome_bio/trc/). “The move in industry is away from broad-based indications to stratified medicine. To do so, [industry] needs access to technology traditionally not available” to them, says Kaitin. “Much of it is going on in government and academic labs, so it is critical for industry to get in there.” Another example is the public-private Biomarkers Consortium (http://www.fnih.org/Biomarkers%20Consortium/Biomarkers_home.shtml), backed by the NIH, The Foundation for the NIH, the FDA, and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA). The partnership includes many of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies and is based on the sharing of data and intellectual property in order to identify and validate biomarker tools and discoveries in areas including cancer, neuroscience, and metabolism. “The science is driving us to less of a whole population approach and more [of a] niche approach,” as exemplified by the humanized monoclonal antibody Herceptin, says Marie Vodicka, PhRMA's assistant vice president for biologics and biotechnology in Washington, DC. “Companies have to keep up with the advances in science. The science will dictate the drugs. Pharma is evolving.” Although people in industry and academia acknowledge this mutual need and talk up its benefits, others are not entirely convinced. “The official lie is people like collaborations, but really if you see a collaboration, it is success by necessity,” says Paul Pospisil. It is “an alignment of different interests.” It may even be an opportunity to poach talent. “The relationship between big pharma, biotech and academia is that they are all competing for the best people,” says Charlene Ledbetter of LedbetterStevens, a life sciences executive search firm in New York City. “They are out-and-out competitors” for talent, with academia luring people with cutting-edge tools, biotech with equity, and big pharma with relative job security, she says. But partnerships may also enhance productivity of members of different teams. “To get people to be broader and innovate is to get them out of their setting,” says Ginger L. Gregory, global head of human resources for Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research in Cambridge, MA. It offers them the chance “to get out of their therapeutic setting, magnified by getting them out of industry into an academic lab” and vice versa, says Gregory, allowing crosspollination in both spheres."

A major underlying mechanism is that cell adhesion enhances GF-mediated intracellular signals, such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk). However, because GFs use distinct mechanisms to activate Ras-Erk signaling, it is unclear whether adhesion-mediated enhancement of Erk signaling is universal to all GFs. We examined this issue by quantifying the dynamics of Erk signaling induced by epidermal growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. Adhesion to fibronectin-coated surfaces enhances Erk signaling elicited by epidermal growth factor but not by bFGF or PDGF. Unexpectedly, adhesion is not always a positive influence on GF-mediated signaling. At critical subsaturating doses of PDGF or bFGF, cell adhesion ablates Erk signaling; that is, adhesion desensitizes the cell to GF stimulation, rendering the signaling pathway unresponsive to GF. Interestingly, the timing of growth factor stimulation proved critical to the desensitization process. Erk activation significantly improved only when pre-exposure to adhesion was completely eliminated; thus, concurrent stimulation by GF and adhesion was able to partially rescue adhesion-mediated desensitization of PDGF- and bFGF-mediated Erk and Akt signaling. These findings suggest that adhesion-mediated desensitization occurs with rapid kinetics and targets a regulatory point upstream of Ras and proximal to GF receptor activation. Thus, adhesion-dependent Erk signaling is not universal to all GFs but, rather, is GF-specific with quantitative features that depend strongly on the dose and timing of GF exposure.

Cell adhesion plays a key role in regulating cellular behaviors such as gene expression, cell survival, and proliferation. Normal cells deprived of adhesion to the extracellular matrix undergo cell cycle arrest (1Assoian R.K. J.

This adhesion dependence is often de-regulated during cancer development, allowing transformed cells to acquire growth and survival advantages over their normal counterparts (6Hanahan D.

Because of the physiological importance of adhesion-mediated cell regulation, significant attention has been given to uncovering the underlying signaling mechanisms. One prominent point of cross-talk between adhesion and growth factors involves the serine/threonine kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk). 2The abbreviations used are: Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GF, growth factor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; FN, fibronectin; PH, poly-HEMA; ErkT, total Erk; ECM, extracellular matrix; ppErk, active Erk. Several reports have shown that growth factor-mediated Erk signaling is enhanced among cells adhered to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins (2Schwartz M.A. Assoian R.K. J.

In fact, this adhesion-mediated enhancement of Erk signaling plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation. In NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, suspended cells trigger only a transient Erk signal; however, when adhered to FN, growth factor treatment supports both a sustained Erk signal and subsequent progression through the cell cycle (11Roovers K. Davey G. Zhu X. Bottazzi M.E. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3197-3204Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Erk is a major signaling protein that is activated by a wide array of stimuli, including several growth factors such as PDGF, bFGF, and EGF (12Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4247) Google Scholar, 13Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3559) Google Scholar, 14Lee J.W. Juliano R. Mol. Cell. 2004; 17: 188-202Google Scholar). It is unclear whether adhesion enhances Erk signaling in response to all of these growth factors or whether only a subset of growth factors signal in an adhesion-dependent manner. Growth factors use substantially different mechanisms to trigger Erk signaling. Unlike EGF, bFGF binding to the cell surface is mediated by two distinct families of cell surface receptors (13Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3559) Google Scholar). After ligand binding, EGF receptors are phosphorylated on key tyrosine residues that recruit signaling proteins. In contrast, bFGF receptors phosphorylate the multidocking protein FSR2, which subsequently serves as a scaffold to trigger downstream signaling pathways. In addition to activation pathways, growth factors differ in negative feedback mechanisms that desensitize signaling (15Freedman N.J. Kim L.K. Murray J.P. Exum S.T. Brian L. Wu J.H. Peppel K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48261-48269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 16Wong A. Lamothe B. Lee A. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6684-6689Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). For example, although stimulation via EGF and PDGF results in serine/threonine phosphorylation of their respective receptors, this receptor phosphorylation results in Erk inhibition only in the cells stimulated by PDGF. Interestingly, Erk activation in EGF-stimulated cells remains unaffected (15Freedman N.J. Kim L.K. Murray J.P. Exum S.T. Brian L. Wu J.H. Peppel K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48261-48269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Such differences in growth factor signaling mechanisms raise the hypothesis that growth factors may differ in the extent to which their stimulation of Erk signaling is adhesion-dependent. To begin to test this hypothesis, we measured the effect of cell adhesion on Erk signaling by three growth factors (EGF, bFGF, and PDGF). To measure the level of adhesion dependence on both the magnitude and dynamics of the Erk signal, we implemented a quantitative protocol for Western blot imaging and analysis. This quantitative approach revealed that adhesion-dependent Erk signaling is selective to EGF in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. Furthermore, our data reveal that adhesion is not always a positive influence on GF-mediated Erk signaling. At a critical subsaturating dose of PDGF and bFGF, cell adhesion actually thwarts Erk signaling. Our results show that adhesion desensitizes cells from subsequent GF-mediated activation of Erk; that is, adhesion renders the signaling pathway unresponsive to GF treatment. Interestingly, reducing the duration of cell adhesion before GF stimulation proved critical in the desensitization process. PDGF- and bFGF-mediated Erk signaling significantly improved among adherent cells only when pre-exposure to adhesion was completely eliminated; however, concurrent stimulation by growth factors and adhesion was only able to partially neutralize GF-mediated desensitization. Our findings suggest that adhesion dependence of Erk signaling is not universal to all GFs but, rather, is GF-specific with quantitative features that depend strongly on the dose and timing of adhesion and GF exposure. Cell Maintenance—NIH-3T3 fibroblasts (ATTC) were cultured and maintained in 89% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), 10% Donor Calf Serum + iron (Invitrogen), 1% PenStrep (Invitrogen). After ∼2 days of growth, when cells reached between 70 and 80% confluence, subconfluent cells were suspended using 0.25% trypsin, EDTA (Invitrogen) and reseeded onto tissue culture dishes. Protein-coating Surfaces—Fibronectin (FN)-coated surfaces were prepared by incubating 2 ml of 5 μg/ml FN (Sigma) diluted in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Sigma) in tissue culture dishes overnight at 4 °C. The dishes were gently rocked during adsorption. The dishes were then blocked with 1 mg/ml heat-inactivated bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at 37 °C. Poly-HEMA (PH)-coated surfaces were prepared by incubating 5 ml of a solution containing 6 mg/ml PH (Sigma) dissolved in 70% biological grade ethanol (Sigma) in uncovered tissue culture dishes overnight at room temperature. Cell Adhesion Experiments—NIH-3T3 cells were suspended using 0.25% trypsin-EDTA, reseeded, and grown until 70–80% confluent. Subconfluent dishes were starved in completely serum-free media (99% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), 1% PenStrep (Invitrogen), 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma)) for 20 h to bring adhesion signals back to basal levels. Serum-starved cells were suspended using 0.05% trypsin. Trypsin activity was quenched by adding soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. Cells were re-suspended in serum-free media to a concentration of 5 × 105 cells/ml and were either plated onto FN-coated dishes or PH-coated dishes; PH-coated dishes were rocked to prevent cell aggregation. After cells acclimated to the surface for varying lengths of time (either 2.5, 1, or 0 h, as described in the figure legends), cells were stimulated with the indicated amount of either PDGF (Sigma), bFGF (Sigma), or EGF (Peprotech). Cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm sodium chloride, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate (pH 7.3), 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 30 mm sodium fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 mm EGTA, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were incubated in lysis buffer for 15 min on ice before centrifugation and collection of the supernatant. Micro-BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) was used to determine the total protein concentration. Immunoblotting—Whole cell lysates were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Blots were probed using either an antibody against dually phosphorylated Erk (Cell Signaling), Ser-473-phosphorylated Akt (Cell Signaling), Erk2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), Sos (Santa Cruz), or caspase 3 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). In the cases of Sos and caspase 3, 7 and 15% gels were used to better resolve high and low molecular weight proteins, respectively. Blots were imaged and quantified as described under “Results” and “Discussion.” Quantitative Measurement of Erk Signaling—To quantify the extent to which different GFs induce adhesion-dependent Erk signaling, we developed a systematic, quantitative Western blotting protocol. The methodology is based on digital imaging using a cooled CCD camera that has a theoretically wider linear dynamic range than standard film-based imaging (17Budowle B. Hudlow W.R. Lee S.B. Klevan L. Biotechniques. 2001; 30: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 18Martin C.S. Bronstein I. J. Biolumin. Chemilumin. 1994; 9: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, even when signals are within the detection limit of the imaging system, data points do not always conform to the expected linear trend (supplemental Fig. 1). We expect that factors such as antigen saturation may contribute to the observed non-linearity. To address these sources of non-linearity that may be specific to each blot, we developed a quantitative Western blotting protocol that employs standard samples to establish the linear dynamic range of each blot. The standards are a set of dilutions of a positive control lysate as illustrated for an anti-Erk Western blot in Fig. 1A. The band intensities from the standard lanes are quantified, and the working linear range is established empirically for each blot (Fig. 1B). Band intensities from the lanes loaded with lysates of interest are then confirmed to fall within the linear dynamic range (Fig. 1B); any band intensities that fall outside the linear dynamic range are discarded. The sole exceptions to this requirement are samples whose basal signal cannot be distinguished from background noise; a typical example is the initial time point after serum starvation. This approach ensures that the measurements of Erk expression levels lie within the linear dynamic range of each Western blot. A similar approach is applied to quantify phospho-Erk and phospho-Akt. To adjust for unequal loading, the band intensity associated with a phosphoprotein (e.g. phospho-Erk) is normalized to the band intensity of an equal-loading control, such as total Erk (ErkT). We note that the same standards are not used in every blot. Rather, dilutions of a positive control lysates are used as standards. This approach ensures that for a particular blot, the band intensities of the standards will encompass nearly the entire linear range of the blot. Such an approach increases the likelihood that the band intensities of the lysates of interest will fall within the linear range. To ensure that data collected from two distinct blots can be compared with one another, we included a common reference point in each blot. This reference is a sample generated under the same stimulation conditions. The data are then always analyzed and reported relative to this reference point. EGF, but Not PDGF and bFGF, Induces Adhesion-dependent Erk Activation—Using this quantitative Western blotting protocol, we measured the Erk signaling response to growth factor treatment of cells adhered on FN or held in suspension. Our initial experiments used growth factor concentrations well above the dissociation constant (Kd) (Table 1). At these saturating growth factor concentrations, EGF-mediated Erk signaling is enhanced by cell adhesion. Cells adhered on FN exhibit ∼3-fold greater Erk activation than cells held in suspension in response to treatment with EGF for 12 min (Fig. 2A). Meanwhile, neither bFGF-nor PDGF-mediated Erk signaling at a single early time point are adhesion-dependent (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that some GFs (EGF) signal better via the Erk pathway when in an adhesive setting, whereas other factors (PDGF, bFGF) promote Erk signaling in an adhesion-independent manner.TABLE 1Summary of growth factor properties including the critical concentration at which adhesion-mediated desensitization occursGrowth factorMrKdCritical concentration, [GF]cpmpmEGF6.20670 (Ref. 43Lauffenburger D.A.

Open table in a new tab These observations are based on a single, early time point. However, others have shown that GF-mediated Erk signaling may exhibit different dynamical features in adhered versus non-adhered cells (11Roovers K. Davey G. Zhu X. Bottazzi M.E. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3197-3204Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 19Renshaw M.W. Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5592-5599Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 20Danen E.H.

Chem. 1999; 274: 19551-19558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For example, in both adhered and suspended cells, PDGF stimulates Erk equivalently at early times, but only the adhered cells maintain a sustained Erk signal (21DeMali K.A. Balciunaite E. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19551-19558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To examine whether adhesion affects the dynamics of GF-mediated Erk signaling, we measured a full time-course of Erk signaling in response to each of the three GFs. For EGF-stimulated cells, the early phase of Erk activation (<1 h) is adhesion-dependent, whereas the late phase of the signal reaches a nearly equivalent, basal signal for both adhered and suspended cells (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, both the adherent and suspended cells reach maximum signal intensity after only 6 min of stimulation. Thus, the kinetics of EGF-induced Erk signaling is similar in both adherent and suspended cells, although signal magnitude is clearly adhesion-dependent. In contrast, Erk activation in cells stimulated with either PDGF (Fig. 2C) or bFGF (supplemental Fig. 2) was adhesion-independent. For both growth factors, the Erk signal reached a similar maximum after ∼30 min of stimulation. Furthermore, in the case of PDGF, the Erk signal decays with similar kinetics for both suspended and adhered cells. In the case of bFGF, however, the Erk signal is sustained at near-maximum levels in both adhered and suspended cells. Thus, measurements of the complete dynamics of Erk signaling show that EGF, but not PDGF or bFGF, induces Erk signaling in an adhesion-dependent manner. Subsaturating Doses of PDGF or bFGF Reveal Negative Adhesion-GF Synergism—The apparent lack of adhesion dependence in Erk signaling for bFGF and PDGF may be linked to the fact that high concentrations of the growth factors were used. In this concentration regime, excessive GF signaling may overcome the need for cell adhesion. Thus, we hypothesized that for PDGF and bFGF, Erk signaling may be adhesion-dependent if concentrations are near or less than Kd (Table 1) were used. To test this possibility, we measured GF-mediated Erk signaling across a broad range of GF concentrations. In the case of EGF, varying its concentration over 3 orders of magnitude did not affect the observed adhesion-mediated enhancement in Erk signaling (Fig. 3A). Regardless of its concentration, EGF stimulated an ∼3-fold greater Erk response among adherent cells than among suspended cells (Fig. 3A). In contrast, experiments with different PDGF and bFGF concentrations revealed an unexpected response (Fig. 3, B and C). At a critical growth factor concentration (8 pm PDGF or 1 pm bFGF), cells in suspension induced Erk signaling to a significantly greater extent than adherent cells. Above the critical PDGF and bFGF concentration, adhered and suspended cells responded equivalently (Fig. 3, B and C). At the critical PDGF and bFGF concentration, the suspended cells responded 7- and 13-fold better, respectively, than their adherent counterparts (Fig. 3, B and C). These results reveal a negative synergism between adhesion and GF stimulation; adhesion thwarts Erk activation at critically low doses of PDGF and bFGF. Because this negative synergy was observed at a specific time point in Erk signaling, we investigated the dynamics of Erk signaling more completely at the critical PDGF concentrations (Fig. 4) and bFGF concentrations (supplemental Fig. 3). At the critical PDGF concentration, adherent cells were unable to induce Erk signaling during the entire time course (Fig. 4). In contrast, Erk signaling in suspended cells was substantial throughout the entire time course (Fig. 4). Thus, the observed negative synergism between adhesion and GF stimulation is not an artifact of selecting a specific time point; rather, the entire dynamics of PDGF-mediated Erk signaling is suppressed among adherent cells at the critical PDGF concentration. Similar results were observed for bFGF as adhesion completely ablated bFGF-mediated Erk activation (supplemental Fig. 3). Adhesion Desensitizes PDGF- and bFGF-mediated Erk Signaling—The observed negative synergy reveals that cell adhesion to FN selectively abrogates PDGF- and bFGF-mediated Erk signaling when these growth factors are present at low concentrations. These observations raise the possibility that adhesion desensitizes subsequent Erk activation. Desensitization refers to a state in which a signaling pathway becomes unresponsive to stimuli. This desensitized or refractory state may occur when a signal triggers negative feedback mechanisms that persist and prevent re-activation of the signal in response to new stimuli. Published reports have shown that growth factor stimulation inhibits Erk signaling in response to a second challenge of growth factor (22Hupfeld C.J. Resnik J.L. Ugi S. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1016-1023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 23Ji S. Frank S.J. Messina J.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 18651-18658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that adhesion to FN may also desensitize Erk signaling to a select subset of growth factors (PDGF and bFGF). Consistent with this hypothesis of adhesion-mediated desensitization, cell adhesion to FN in the absence of growth factors promotes Erk activation (Fig. 5). Adhesion rapidly stimulates the Erk pathway with maximal activation occurring by ∼12 min after cell seeding. This adhesion-mediated Erk signaling may trigger negative feedback loops that desensitize cells to subsequent Erk signaling by PDGF and bFGF. If desensitization is responsible for reduced PDGF- and bFGF-mediated Erk signaling, then reducing the duration of cell adhesion before growth factor stimulation might alleviate this suppression. Because cells were seeded 2.5 h before stimulation in all previous experiments, we tested this hypothesis by measuring PDGF-mediated Erk signaling among cells that were exposed to FN-coated surfaces for shorter times, specifically 1 and 0 h (Fig. 6, A and B, respectively). In the 0-h case, cells were concurrently stimulated with growth factor and plated onto FN-coated dishes.FIGURE 6The dependence of PDGF-mediated ERK signaling on the duration of pre-exposure to FN-coated surfaces. Serum-starved NIH-3T3 cells were held in suspension (empty circles) or adhered on FN-coated plates (solid squares) as described in the legend to Fig. 2. The duration cells spent in suspension or adhered to FN before stimulation with 8 pm PDGF was reduced from 2.5 h to 1 h (A) or 0 h (B). The integral of the ERK time-course for all three acclimation times are shown in C. For A and B, error bars represent sample S.E. (n = 3–6). For C, the error bars represent propagated error when the trapezoid rule is used to calculate the integrated signal.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Reducing the duration of adhesion significantly enhanced PDGF-mediated Erk signaling among adherent cells. Although Erk signaling was severely attenuated among cells that had adhered for 2.5 h (Fig. 4), reducing adhesion time to 1 h only slightly improved Erk signaling (Fig. 6A). However, eliminating pre-exposure to adhesion altogether by concurrent stimulation with PDGF significantly improved Erk signaling among adherent cells (Fig. 6B). To quantify the enhancement in PDGF-mediated Erk signaling in response to decreasing the duration of adhesion, we integrated the time course of Erk signaling for cells held in suspension or adhered on FN for 0, 1, and 2.5 h (Fig. 6C). When the pre-exposure time to adhesion was reduced from 2.5 to 0 h, the integrated Erk signal increased ∼5-fold. Notably, even concurrent stimulation was unable to rescue PDGF-mediated Erk activation to the same level as that observed in suspended cells, suggesting that adhesion-mediated desensitization occurs rapidly. The rapid timescale of adhesion-mediated desensitization is consistent with the fact that cell adhesion to FN significantly activates Erk within 12 min of cell seeding (Fig. 5).

In a recent report in Nature, Fischer et al. (2007) show that the ability to learn and remember can be reestablished in a mouse model of dementia through either environmental enrichment or chronic treatment with an inhibitor of histone deacetylase."
