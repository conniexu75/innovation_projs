https://openalex.org/W1990401009,"Somatic mutations in a subset of growth hormone (GH)-secreting pituitary tumors convert the gene for the alpha polypeptide chain (alpha s) of Gs into a putative oncogene, termed gsp. These mutations, which activate alpha s by inhibiting its guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity, are found in codons for either of two amino acids, each of which is completely conserved in all known G protein alpha chains. The likelihood that similar mutations would activate other G proteins prompted a survey of human tumors for mutations that replace either of these two amino acids in other G protein alpha chain genes. The first gene so far tested, which encodes the alpha chain of Gi2, showed mutations that replaced arginine-179 with either cysteine or histidine in 3 of 11 tumors of the adrenal cortex and 3 of 10 endocrine tumors of the ovary. The mutant alpha i2 gene is a putative oncogene, referred to as gip2. In addition, gsp mutations were found in 18 of 42 GH-secreting pituitary tumors and in an autonomously functioning thyroid adenoma. These findings suggest that human tumors may harbor oncogenic mutations in various G protein alpha chain genes."
https://openalex.org/W2012324003,"The three-dimensional structure of the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of the glucocorticoid receptor has been determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and distance geometry. The structure of a 71-residue protein fragment containing two ""zinc finger"" domains is based on a large set of proton-proton distances derived from nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectra, hydrogen bonds in previously identified secondary structure elements, and coordination of two zinc atoms by conserved cysteine residues. The DBD is found to consist of a globular body from which the finger regions extend. A model of the dimeric complex between the DBD and the glucocorticoid response element is proposed. The model is consistent with previous results indicating that specific amino acid residues of the DBD are involved in protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2028606580,"Photic information entrains a circadian pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the mammalian hypothalamus to environmental light/dark cycles. To determine whether light regulates c-fos gene expression in the SCN, we have measured c-fos mRNA levels in the SCN of the golden hamster. We report that, during the subjective night, light causes a rapid increase in levels of c-fos mRNA in the SCN. Light pulses of 5 min duration are sufficient to induce c-fos mRNA, and the highest mRNA levels occur 30 min following the onset of light. The minimum level of illumination required to induce an increase in c-fos mRNA is indistinguishable from the minimum irradiance that produces a phase shift in the hamster's circadian rhythm of activity. In addition, the induction of c-fos mRNA in the SCN by light is itself under circadian regulation. Light induction of c-fos mRNA occurs only during the subjective night, at circadian times when photic phase shifting of activity occurs. Taken together, these data suggest that c-fos may be a molecular component of the photic pathway for entrainment of mammalian circadian rhythms."

https://openalex.org/W2091898459,"We have assessed the biologic role of IL-4 by fusing its gene to an immunoglobulin promoter/enhancer and introducing it into transgenic mice. By attenuating the transgene promoter through the insertion of E. coli lac operator sequences, we have created a series of animals that constitutively express varying amounts of IL-4. Overexpression of IL-4 results in a marked increase in serum IgE levels and the appearance of an inflammatory ocular lesion (blepharitis) with characteristic histopathologic features seen in allergic reactions. In addition, expression of the IL-4 transgene in the thymus perturbs T cell maturation, reducing the population of immature CD4+CD8+ thymocytes and peripheral T cells while increasing the population of mature CD8+ thymocytes. These results demonstrate that deregulation of a single cytokine gene in vivo can induce a complex inflammatory reaction resembling that observed in human allergic disease."
https://openalex.org/W1575806712,"We have previously purified from bovine brain cytosol a novel regulatory protein for smg p25A, a ras p21-like GTP-binding protein. This protein, named smg p25A GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI), regulates the GDP/GTP exchange reaction of smg p25A by inhibiting the dissociation of GDP from and thereby the subsequent binding of GTP to it. We have also previously found that smg p25A is mainly localized in presynaptic plasma membranes and vesicles and moderately in presynaptic cytosol in rat brain synapses. In this paper, we have studied the possible involvement of smg p25A GDI in the localization of smg p25A in the cytosol, plasma membranes, and vesicles in rat brain synapses. Both the GDP- and GTP-bound forms of smg p25A bound to the synaptic membranes and vesicles. smg p25A GDI inhibited the binding of the GDP-bound form of smg p25A, but not that of the GTP-bound form, to the synaptic membranes and vesicles. Moreover, smg p25A GDI induced the dissociation of the GDP-bound form, but not that of the GTP-bound form, of both endogenous and exogenous smg p25As from the synaptic membranes and vesicles. smg p25A GDI made a complex with the GDP-bound form of smg p25A with a molar ratio of 1:1, but not with the GTP-bound or guanine nucleotide-free form. These results suggest that smg p25A reversibly binds to synaptic plasma membranes and vesicles and that this reversible binding is regulated by its specific GDI."
https://openalex.org/W2133133228,"Gene expression in the mother cell compartment of sporulating cells of B. subtilis is partly governed by the mother cell RNA polymerase sigma factor σK. Paradoxically, σK-directed gene expression also depends on σG, the product of the forespore compartment regulatory gene spoIIIG, and on other forespore regulatory proteins. We now identify mutations in the genes bofA and bofB that relieve the dependence of mother cell gene expression on forespore regulatory proteins but not on σK. We establish that the dependence of mother cell gene expression on the forespore regulatory proteins is mediated at the level of the conversion of pro-σK to its mature, active form. We propose that the bofA and/or bofB proteins govern this conversion in response to a signal generated by the forespore. Activation of pro-σK could be a checkpoint for coordinating gene expression between the mother cell and forespore compartments of the developing sporangium."
https://openalex.org/W2008775295,"The I-E molecule of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) can prevent the spontaneous development of diabetes in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. The mechanism of this protection has been investigated by breeding wild-type and promoter-mutated Eαk transgenes onto the NOD genetic background. Animals carrying the various mutated transgenes expressed I-E on different subsets of immunocompetent cells, and thus cells important for the I-E protective effect could be identified. Although the wild-type transgene prevented the infiltration of lymphocytes into pancreatic islets, none of the mutants did. However, all of the transgenes could mediate the intrathymic elimination of T cells bearing antigen receptors with variable regions that recognize I-E. Thus, the I-E molecule does not protect NOD mice from diabetes simply by inducing the deletion of self-reactive T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2008256490,"Krev-1 is an anti-oncogene that was originally identified by its ability to induce morphologic reversion of ras-transformed cells that continue to express the ras gene. The Krev-1-encoded protein is structurally related to Ras proteins. The biological activities of a series of ras-Krev-1 chimeras were studied to test the hypothesis that Krev-1 may directly interfere with a ras function. The ras-specific and Krev-1-specific amino acids immediately surrounding residues 32 to 44, which are identical between the two proteins, determined whether the protein induced cellular transformation or suppressed ras transformation. Because this region in Ras proteins has been implicated in effector function, the results suggest that Krev-1 suppresses ras-induced transformation by interfering with interaction of Ras with its effector."
https://openalex.org/W1987806096,"Chronic endobronchial infection with mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa accounts for much of the morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Reduced morbidity is observed when infection is absent. Clinical investigations have implicated opsonizing antibody specific for the mucoid exopolysaccharide (MEP) surrounding these bacteria as a potential immunologic protective mechanism, whereas nonopsonizing antibody to MEP is not protective. Mice and rats immunized with doses of MEP that elicited opsonizing antibody had reduced levels of infection compared with nonimmune controls after intratracheal challenge with mucoid P. aeruginosa enmeshed in agar beads. Doses of MEP that elicited nonopsonizing antibody were not protective. Parallel experiments in which passive transfer of polyclonal and monoclonal opsonizing and nonopsonizing antibody were used yielded similar results. These data indicate that MEP-specific opsonizing antibody can protect against chronic P. aeruginosa infection in this model of disease."
https://openalex.org/W1576707839,"Lysosomal cathepsin G from human neutrophils is a chymotrypsin-like protease which also possesses antimicrobial activity. The antimicrobial activity, however, is independent of protease activity, because treatment of this enzyme with the irreversible serine protease inhibitor diisopropylfluorophosphate has no effect on its antimicrobial action. In this study, we found that digestion of cathepsin G with clostripain caused a loss of proteolytic activity in this neutrophil proteinase. However, bactericidal activity in in vitro assays against Staphylococcus aureus and Neisseria gonorrhoeae was retained. Fractionation of the clostripain-digested cathepsin G mixture yielded two distinct antimicrobial peptides. The sequences of these peptides were IIGGR and HPQYNQR (residues 1-5 and 77-83 in cathepsin G, respectively). Synthetic peptides corresponding to these sequences were also prepared and found to exert broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity in vitro, displaying conditions of temperature- and pH-dependent optima for antimicrobial action resembling that of the full-length enzyme. Depending on the target bacterial strain, these peptides exhibited antimicrobial activity between 5.0 x 10(-5) and 4.0 x 10(-4) M. Significantly, replacement of certain residues within these peptides with either alanine or valine significantly reduced their antibacterial capacities. Our studies suggest that cathepsin G has two antimicrobial sequences, either or both of which may contribute to its bactericidal activity."
https://openalex.org/W1573417631,"Abstract Human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) were used as a cell model to determine how arachidonic acid stimulates the synthesis of platelet-activating factor (PAF) synthesized via the remodeling pathway. In these studies HL-60 cells were cultured over 30 passages in fatty acid-free medium to deplete them of arachidonic acid. Even though the phospholipid classes from these cells contained no arachidonate, they could still be differentiated into granulocytes by dimethyl sulfoxide (1.25%). When the differentiated HL-60 cells, depleted of arachidonic acid, were stimulated with calcium ionophore A23187 in the presence of Ca2+ and [3H]acetate, only minimal amounts of [3H]PAF were produced. In contrast, if the differentiated HL-60 cells were supplemented with 10 microM arachidonic acid for 24 h and then stimulated with the ionophore, there was a large amount of [3H]PAF formed. The increase in PAF synthesis depended on the length of time the cells were supplemented with arachidonic acid; only a small increase in PAF synthesis occurred during the early hours of supplementation whereas stimulation of PAF synthesis was maximal (3-5-fold) after a 24-h period of the 20:4 supplementation. Other polyenoic fatty acid supplements (20:5, 22:4, and 22:6 for 24 h) also stimulated PAF production in the ionophore-treated HL-60 cells depleted of 20:4, but the amount of PAF was significantly less than found for the supplements of 20:4 under identical experimental conditions. Also noteworthy is that undifferentiated cells supplemented with 20:4 or their unsupplemented controls could not be stimulated by the calcium ionophore to produce PAF. Addition of indomethacin (cyclooxygenase inhibitor), A63162 (5'-lipoxygenase inhibitor), or eicosatetraynoic acid (cyclooxygenase/lipoxygenase inhibitor) to the incubations caused little change in the production of [3H]PAF in the differentiated cells supplemented with 20:4 for 24 h. On the other hand, the addition of mepacrine, bromophenacyl bromide, or U26384 (phospholipase A2 inhibitors) resulted in very large decreases (80-90% lower than controls) in the amount of [3H]PAF produced under the same conditions. Analysis of the molecular species of [3H]alkylacyl-GroPCho (1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, the precursor of PAF in the remodeling pathway) in 20:4-supplemented cells prelabeled with [3H]alkyl-lyso-GroPCho revealed that only the alkylarachidonoyl-GroPCho species were preferentially decreased after stimulation with the A23187 ionophore.These results demonstrate that arachidonate must be at the sn-2 position of alkylacyl-GroPCho in order for it to serve as a precursor of PAF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W4240127593,"A metalloantibody has been constructed with a coordination site for metals in the antigen binding pocket. The Zn(II) binding site from carbonic anhydrase B was used as a model. Three histidine residues have been placed in the light chain complementarity determining regions of a single chain antibody molecule. In contrast to the native protein, the mutant displayed metal-dependent fluorescence-quenching behavior. This response was interpreted as evidence for metal binding in the three-histidine site with relative affinities in the order Cu(II) greater than Zn(II) greater than Cd(II). The presence of metal cofactors in immunoglobulins should facilitate antibody catalysis of redox and hydrolytic reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2104738841,"The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor contains multiple sites of phosphorylation on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues. Because the biological responsiveness of the EGF receptor is regulated by phosphorylation at several of these sites, we studied the functional consequences of removal of the Thr669 and Ser671 phosphorylation sites using site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant EGF receptor expressed in mouse B82 cells displayed normal EGF binding and in vivo autophosphorylation and was fully active in biological signal transduction as measured by EGF-stimulated gene transcription. However, the EGF-dependent phosphorylation of an 85-kDa cellular substrate by the mutant receptor was impaired relative to the wild type receptor, indicating that the mutated region may specifically interact with this substrate. Endocytosis of the mutant receptor was also impaired as measured by both receptor down-regulation and ligand internalization studies. This was due to impaired uptake of the mutant receptor by the saturable, high affinity endocytic system. Several aspects of mutant receptor function were regulated normally by TPA, indicating a lack of interaction between the mutated phosphorylation sites and the nearby protein kinase C phosphorylation site Thr654. These results suggest that phosphorylation of the EGF receptor at Thr669 and Ser671 mediates interaction of the receptor with a specific tyrosine kinase substrate and is required for efficient ligand-induced receptor internalization."
https://openalex.org/W1903417359,"Germin was previously shown to contain covalently bonded and adventitious glycans. The object of the present investigation was to characterize the two types of glycan. The presence of N- but not O-glycans in germin is indicated by the biosynthesis of altered forms, including an unglycosylated form of germin when wheat embryos are germinated in the presence of tunicamycin. After treating the doublet of germin pentamers (G and G') from normally germinated embryos with beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, G is converted to a form that co-migrates with G' during electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide, but G' is unaffected. This suggests that the N-glycans in G contain antennary N-acetylglucosamine but that those in G' do not. This conclusion has been confirmed and elaborated by doubly labeling G and G' in vivo with [3H]glucosamine and [35S]methionine, and by characterizing sugar-labeled glycopeptides from G and G' by gel filtration, before and after their degradation by exoglycosidases. In the context of proven structures for the complex N-glycans in other plant glycoproteins, the findings, when combined with monosaccharide analyses of G and G', permit plausible speculation about the structure of the single N-glycan that is likely present in each G monomer (GlcNAc2(Man)2(Man-Xyl)(GlcNAc)(GlcNAc-Fuc] and G' monomer ((Man)2(Man-Xyl)(GlcNAc)(GlcNAc-Fuc)). The adventitious glycans, which can be removed by phenolic extraction of germin, have a composition similar to that expected for the characteristic hemicelluloses and pectins in monocot cell walls. The possible significance of this finding is discussed in relation to our continuing efforts to define the biochemical involvements of germin. In allied studies, affinity of its N-linked glycans for concanavalin A has been used to concentrate small amounts of germin from large volumes of wheat extract and to fractionate germin from tunicamycin-treated and normally germinated wheat embryos."
https://openalex.org/W1528051864,"Transducin, the guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein in rod outer segments, is a heterotrimer consisting of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-subunits. Activation of the photoreceptor, rhodopsin, by light, results in activation of transducin which cleaves to form transducin alpha. GTP and a complex of beta gamma-subunits. We have investigated the point(s) of contact between the subunits of transducin by analyzing for the formation of intersubunit disulfide bond(s) in the presence of copper phenanthroline. The formation of a new species with an apparent molecular mass of 43 kDa was observed which had resulted from the formation of a disulfide bond between the beta- and gamma-subunits. The amino acid residues participating in the disulfide bond were identified as Cys-25 in the beta-subunit and Cys-36 and/or Cys-37 in the gamma-subunit. Thus, these cysteine residues and, probably, some of the adjacent amino acid residues form a point of contact between the beta- and gamma-subunits of transducin in the stable complex."
https://openalex.org/W178239735,"Chromatography of wild-type yeast extracts on DEAE-cellulose columns resolves two populations of glycogen synthase I (glucose-6-P-independent) and D (glucose-6-P-dependent) (Huang, K. P., Cabib, E. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 3851-3857). Extracts from a glycogen-deficient mutant strain, 22R1 (glc7), yielded only the D form of glycogen synthase. Glycogen synthase D purified from either wild-type yeast or from this glycogen-deficient mutant displayed two polypeptides with molecular masses of 76 and 83 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis in a protein ratio of about 4:1. Phosphate analysis showed that glycogen synthase D from either strain of yeast contained approximately 3 phosphates/subunit. The 76- and 83-kDa bands of the mutant strain copurified through a variety of procedures including nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. These two polypeptides showed immunological cross-reactivity and similar peptide maps indicating that they are structurally related. The relative amounts of these two forms remained constant during purification and storage of the enzyme and after treatment with cAMP-dependent protein kinase or with protein phosphatases. The two polypeptides were phosphorylated to similar extent in vitro by the catalytic subunit of mammalian cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. Phosphorylation of the enzyme in the presence of labeled ATP followed by tryptic digestion and reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography yielded two labeled peptides from each of the 76- and 83-kDa subunits. Treatment of wild-type yeast with Li+ increased the glycogen synthase activity, measured in the absence of glucose-6-P, by approximately 2-fold, whereas similar treatment of the glc7 mutant had no effect. The results of this study indicate that the GLC7 gene is involved in a pathway that regulates the phosphorylation state of glycogen synthase."
https://openalex.org/W1587623488,"The Mucor rennin gene encoding a prepro form of the fungal aspartic proteinase from Mucor pusillus was expressed under the control of the yeast GAL7 promoter in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The mature M. pusillus rennin secreted efficiently by yeast was a highly glycosylated protein. Analysis by a combination of site-directed mutagenesis of each of the three possible glycosylation sites and treatment of the secreted M. pusillus rennins with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H revealed that the mature yeast M. pusillus rennin contained two asparagine-linked glycosylation sites among the three possible glycosylation sites. A mutation of the 2 glycosylated asparagine residues of M. pusillus rennin resulted in significant decreases in the level of secretion by yeast cells. In addition, the extent of glycosylation of M. pusillus rennin was found to affect the enzyme properties such as milk-clotting and proteolytic activities."
https://openalex.org/W1560596435,"Ribonuclease P is the endonuclease that removes the leader fragments from the 5'-ends of precursor tRNAs. The enzyme isolated from eubacteria contains a catalytic RNA subunit. RNAs also copurify with eukaryotic RNase P, although catalysis by those RNAs has not been demonstrated. This paper reports the isolation and characterization of ribonuclease P from the thermoacidophilic archaebacterium Sulfolobus solfataricus. Archaebacteria are a primary evolutionary lineage, distinct from both eukaryotes and eubacteria. Ribonuclease P of S. solfataricus has reaction component requirements and a Km for substrate tRNA (2.5 X 10(-7) M) that are roughly similar to those reported for eubacterial and eukaryotic ribonuclease P. The temperature optimum for the reaction is 77 degrees C, reflecting the thermophilic character of the organism. The enzyme activity is not affected by treatment with micrococcal nuclease, suggesting that there is no RNA subunit or that it is protected from nuclease action. The density of the enzyme in cesium sulfate equilibrium density gradients is 1.27 g/ml, which is similar to that of protein. However, several RNAs between 200 and 400 nucleotides in size copurify with the enzyme activity on the density gradients, and one of them remains after micrococcal nuclease treatment. These properties of the S. solfataricus enzyme are compared with those of ribonuclease P from eukaryotes and eubacteria."
https://openalex.org/W1577253462,"The lumazine synthase-riboflavin synthase complex (heavy riboflavin synthase) of Bacillus subtilis consists of an icosahedral capsid of 60 beta-subunits containing a core of three alpha-subunits. The enzyme has been purified from the derepressed mutant H 94 of B. subtilis by a novel efficient procedure using column chromatography and preparative crystallization. Beta-Subunits were isolated after dissociation of the enzyme at pH 8.0. Ligand-driven renaturation of beta-subunits yields hollow icosahedral beta 60 capsids which could be crystallized in 1.55 M phosphate, pH 8.7, in three different modifications. A monoclinic modification belongs to space group C2 with unit cell dimensions of a = 235.5, b = 191.2, and c = 165.4 A and alpha = gamma = 90 degrees and beta = 134.4 degrees. The crystals contain two hollow beta 60 particles/unit cell and diffract to approximately 2.8-A resolution. A hexagonal modification has the space group P6(3)22 with unit cell dimensions of a = b = 157.2 and c = 300.8 A and alpha = beta = 90 degrees and gamma = 120 degrees. These cell parameters are similar to the dimensions of hexagonal crystals of native heavy riboflavin synthase (alpha 3 beta 60). A second hexagonal modification shows unit cell parameters of a = b = 156.3 and c = 622.6 A and alpha = beta = 90 degrees and gamma = 120 degrees.

https://openalex.org/W1578554939,"Synapsin I is a major nerve terminal-specific phosphoprotein. It consists of a hydrophobic head region containing one phosphorylation site for either cAMP-dependent protein kinase or Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I and of a basic and elongated tail region containing two phosphorylation sites for Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. The steady-state emission spectrum of synapsin I was centered at 330 nm and was markedly red shifted upon denaturation, as expected for tryptophan residues segregated from the external aqueous environment in native conditions. Quenching studies showed a low accessibility of synapsin I tryptophans at low ionic strength which was further decreased by exposure to 200 mM NaCl but not significantly affected by phosphorylation. The intrinsic fluorescence of synapsin I was resolved into three major decay components with lifetimes of about 0.2, 3, and 7 ns. Upon phosphorylation of synapsin I on the tail sites, the spectra associated with the intermediate and long lifetimes were shifted to the red region, while the spectrum associated with the short lifetime was shifted to the blue region, in the absence of significant changes of the lifetimes. Phosphorylation of synapsin I on the head site was less effective. The anisotropy decay of synapsin I labeled with the long-living chromophore pyrene on Cys-223 was also analyzed. A shorter rotational correlation time was found for the tail phosphorylated form (corresponding to a Stokes radius of 41-42 A) than for the dephosphorylated or for the head phosphorylated form (corresponding to a Stokes radius of 60-63 A). The data suggest that phosphorylation of the tail sites induces changes in the conformation and hydrodynamic properties of synapsin I which may play a role in the regulation of the molecular interactions of synapsin I within the nerve terminal."
https://openalex.org/W1640254299,"The in vitro metabolism of high density lipoproteins (HDL) in carriers of the apolipoprotein AIMilano (apoAIM) mutant was investigated during incubation of whole plasma and isolated lipoprotein fractions. A reduced cholesterol esterification (16.5 versus 25.0% for controls) and a decreased exchange of lipids between HDL and lower density lipoproteins was observed during incubation (6 h at 37 degrees C) of AIM plasma. Control HDL3 were converted to larger, faster-floating HDL particles, whereas only a fraction of AIM HDL3 followed the same pathway. Incubations were also carried out by mixing HDL3 from controls and AIM carriers with a lipoprotein-depleted plasma fraction in the presence of triglyceride-rich particles isolated from Intralipid. AIM HDL3 again showed a reduced capacity for lipid exchange; some HDL3 particles followed a conversion to faster-floating, larger HDL, whereas the small AIM HDL3 were not modified, indicating that AIM HDL3 are a mixture of metabolically functional and nonfunctional particles. Following transformation of the apoAIM homo- and heterodimers into their normal counterparts, i.e. monomeric apoAI and -AII, by reduction and carboxamidomethylation of AIM HDL3, the modified HDL3 behave like control HDL3 during incubation with lipoprotein-depleted plasma and triglyceride-rich particles. The presence of AIM dimers is most likely responsible for the increased HDL3 stability in the AIM carriers, indicating that apolipoprotein composition plays a major role in HDL particle interconversion."
https://openalex.org/W2044096180,"Infection by human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) is initiated when its envelope protein, gp120, binds to its receptor, the cell surface glycoprotein CD4. Small molecules, termed N-carbomethoxycarbonyl-prolyl-phenylalanyl benzyl esters (CPFs), blocked this binding. CPFs interacted with gp120 and did not interfere with the binding of CD4 to class II major histocompatibility complex molecules. One CPF isomer, CPF(DD), preserved CD4-dependent T cell function while inhibiting HIV-1 infection of H9 tumor cells and human T cells. Although the production of viral proteins in infected T cells is unaltered by CPF(DD), this compound prevents the spread of infection in an in vitro model system."

https://openalex.org/W1539355634,"It has been proposed that beta gamma dimers of signal-transducing G proteins mediate muscarinic activation of atrial K+ channels. We examined this hypothesis by testing the effects of beta gamma dimers from four sources (human erythrocytes, human placenta, bovine brain, and bovine retina) on single channel muscarinic K+ (K+[acetylcholine (ACh)]) currents in inside-out membrane patches of adult guinea pig atria. None of the four beta gamma dimer preparations stimulated K+[ACh] currents; on the contrary, each inhibited the currents whether the currents were activated with GTP alone (agonist-independent activity) or with GTP plus a muscarinic agonist (agonist-dependent activity). Detergents at concentrations used to suspend erythrocyte, brain, and placental beta gamma dimers had no effect by themselves, and detergents were not used with the retinal beta gamma dimers. We conclude that beta gamma dimers do not mediate stimulatory effects of the endogenous G protein that regulates the K+ channels. In fact beta gamma dimers appear to inhibit activation by the endogenous G alpha subunits. Further insight into the role of beta gamma dimers came from the observation that agonist-independent GTP-activated K+[ACh] currents were inhibited by beta gamma dimers at about one-tenth the concentration required to inhibit agonist-dependent activation. One possibility is that dimeric beta gamma may have a higher affinity for free alpha subunits than for alpha subunits associated with agonist-occupied receptors. Thus, in addition to the known requirement of beta gamma dimers for the interaction of alpha subunits with receptors, beta gamma dimers may also improve the signal-to-noise ratio for agonists by reducing agonist-independent background activities."
https://openalex.org/W1583086477,"The role of glycolipids as adhesion receptors for Neisseria gonorrhoeae is examined. Serum-resistant isolates, piliated and nonpiliated isogenic variants, as well as gonococci deficient in lipooligosaccharide and protein II, bind specifically to terminal and internal GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4Glc and GalNAc beta 1-4Gal beta 1-4Gcl sequences in lacto- and ganglio-series glycolipids, respectively, as measured by overlaying glycolipid chromatograms with 125I-labeled organisms. The binding activity was not affected by changing the growth conditions of the organism, as the gonococci bound to both classes of glycolipids when grown anaerobically, microaerophilically on agar or in broth, or under iron-limited conditions. The gonococci do not bind to lacto-sylceramide (Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1Cer) derived from lacto-N-triaosylceramide or from asialo-GM2 by treatment with N-acetyl-beta-hexosaminidase, or to other neutral glycolipids tested. Although N. gonorrhoeae bound weakly to some gangliosides on thin-layer chromatograms, including sialylparagloboside and GM1, in solid phase assays the gonococci bound with high avidity to the sequence GalNAc beta 1-4Gal beta 1-4Glc, with moderate avidity to the sequence GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4Glc, and not at all to gangliosides. Interestingly, the 4.8-kDa component of gonococcal lipooligosaccharide, which contains lacto-N-neotetraose (Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4Glc), strongly inhibits gonococcal-specific agglutination of human erythrocytes and inhibits the binding of labeled organisms to human paragloboside and lacto-N-triaosylceramide on thin-layer chromatograms. Possibly, this binding specificity explains why gonococci autoagglutinate in vitro."

Treatment of the 35S-proteoglycans extracted from these cells with either chondroitinase ABC or AC resulted in 95% +/- 7% and 84% +/- 7%, respectively (mean +/- S.E., n = 3), of the radioactivity associated with disaccharides eluting in the included volume of PD-10. The 35S-proteoglycans were not hydrolyzed by nitrous acid elimination treatment. The chondroitinase ABC-generated disaccharides were analyzed by aminocyano high performance liquid chromatography. 35S-Disaccharides eluted in a major peak at a retention time of 8.1 min, corresponding to the disaccharide of chondroitin 4-sulfate proteoglycan (delta Di-4S), and a second peak at 12 min, corresponding to the disaccharide of chondroitin sulfate D proteoglycan (delta Di-diSD). Further treatment with chondro-4-sulfatase did not affect the retention time of the disaccharide corresponding to delta Di-diSD whereas this peak disappeared after the digested proteoglycan was treated either by chondro-6-sulfatase or by both sulfatases. Therefore, this disaccharide was identified as chondroitin sulfate D. Quantification of the radiolabeled disaccharides showed that delta Di-diSD contributed 20% +/- 2% (n = 3) of the total sulfated disaccharides of the chondroitin sulfate of these cultured cells. The role of fibroblasts in inducing the shift of chondroitin sulfate D into heparin proteoglycan in these mast cells was also investigated by using three types of monolayers: mouse embryonic skin fibroblasts (MESF), rat embryonic skin fibroblasts (RESF), and 3T3 fibroblasts. 35S-Proteoglycans that were extracted from the lymph node-derived mast cells cultured for 30 days on MESF and on 3T3 fibroblast monolayers were 93% +/- 4% and 30% +/- 7% (n = 3) susceptible to nitrous acid elimination, respectively. No degradation by nitrous acid was observed in 35S-proteoglycans extracted from cells cultured on RESF monolayer. Since the MESF was found to be the most potent monolayer in the induction of heparin synthesis, the kinetics of changes in the synthesis of proteoglycan types were determined in lymph node-derived mast cells cultured on MESF for up to 30 days. It was found that the synthesis of chondroitin sulfate gradually declined whereas that of heparin starting between 4 and 7 days after plating gradually increased. From the 17th day on, only the synthesis of heparin was detected."
https://openalex.org/W1605848574,"NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase contains one molecule each of FMN and FAD. The FAD moiety has been selectively removed, producing the FMN reductase. The FMN reductase is stable and enzymatic activity is reconstituted with either FAD or FMN. FMN remains tightly bound, but can both dissociate from the FMN site and bind to the vacant FAD site. The amount of FMN bound in the FAD site is minimal under specific experimental conditions. There are at least two conformational subpopulations of the FMN reductase; NADP dissociates readily from one but extremely slowly from the other. Rapid dissociation of NADP is regained upon reconstitution with FAD. The one-electron redox state of the FMN reductase is thermodynamically stabilized, though to a lesser degree than in the holoreductase. When two-electron reduced FMN reductase is exposed to oxygen, a stable species with an absorbance peak at 580 nm forms rapidly and quantitatively. This species has been identified by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy as the neutral radical of FMN and is indistinguishable from the air-stable radical of the holoreductase. The redox behavior of the FMN reductase is in agreement with properties proposed previously for the FMN site."

https://openalex.org/W72046668,"The 3'-untranslated region of apolipoprotein II (apoII) mRNA contains target sites for mRNA breakdown (Binder, R., Hwang, S.-P. L., Ratnasabapathy, R., and Williams, D. L. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 16910-16918). Degradation occurs via endonucleolytic cleavage at 5'-AAU-3'/5'-UAA-3' elements in single-stranded loop domains of the 3'-untranslated region. Degradation target sites occur in two clusters that are localized within two larger domains of secondary structure. In this study, gel shift and label transfer assays were used to identify liver cytosolic factors that recognize the 3'-untranslated region of apoII mRNA. The results show preferential binding of cytosolic factors to the 3'-untranslated region as compared to the coding region. UV cross-linking experiments confirmed that cytosolic factors labeled by the 3'-untranslated region are a subset of proteins labeled by the entire mRNA. Two distinct binding domains were identified within the 3'-untranslated region. The upstream domain encompassing nucleotides 400-547 extends from the translation stop codon through the complex stem-loop D structure described previously. This domain labeled primarily a 34-kDa protein in UV cross-linking experiments. The downstream binding domain encompassing nucleotides 568-643 includes another region of secondary structure and terminates within the universal polyadenylation signal. The downstream domain labeled primarily a 60-kDa protein in UV cross-linking experiments. The upstream and downstream binding domains did not compete with each other in gel shift or cross-linking experiments. These results indicate that the 3'-untranslated region can form two independent messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes localized to domains that include target sites for apoII mRNA degradation. We speculate that these messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes may play a role in the degradation of apoII mRNA or in the regulation of this process."
https://openalex.org/W1556769040,"Three isoforms of a single nuclear lamin have been identified in Drosophila. Two, lamins Dm1 and Dm2, are present during interphase and are apparently in equilibrium with each other in vivo. The third, lamin Dmmit, is found in cells that have undergone nuclear envelope breakdown, either during meiosis or mitosis. All three isoforms were purified under nondenaturing conditions using a novel technique of immunoaffinity chromatography and their in vitro activities were examined. Interphase lamins Dm1 and Dm2 can assemble into filaments at physiologic ionic strength; assembly is reversible upon addition of concentrated NaCl. Negative staining of filaments formed in vitro shows long, unbranched bundles approximately 20 nm in diameter. Addition of specific antilamin antibodies blocks in vitro assembly completely. In contrast with lamins Dm1 and Dm2, lamin Dmmit remains soluble at physiologic ionic strength. These observations are consistent with the notion that lamina disassembly in vivo is due, at least in part, to changes in properties of the lamins themselves."
https://openalex.org/W1588730582,"Recent studies have demonstrated that 3-deoxy-3-fluoro-D-glucose (3-FG) is metabolized to 3-deoxy-3-fluoro-D-sorbitol (3-FS), via aldose reductase, and 3-deoxy-3-fluoro-D-fructose (3-FF), via the sorbitol dehydrogenase reaction with 3-FS, in rat cerebral tissue (Kwee, I. L., Nakada, T., and Card, P. J. (1987) J. Neurochem. 49, 428-433). However, the biochemistry of 3-FG in other mammalian organs has not been investigated making the application of 3-FG as a metabolic tracer uncertain. To address this issue we investigated 3-FG metabolism and distribution in isolated cell lines and in rabbit tissues in vivo with 19F NMR and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In general, the production of 3-FS is well correlated with the known distribution of aldose reductase in all the systems studied. Further metabolism of 3-FS to 3-FF was verified to occur in cerebral tissue. Surprisingly, two new fluorinated compounds were found in the liver and kidney cortex. These compounds are identified as 3-deoxy-3-fluoro-D-gluconic acid, which is produced via glucose dehydrogenase activity on 3-FG, and 3-deoxy-3-fluoro-D-gluconate-6-phosphate. Based on enzyme studies, it is argued that the 3-deoxy-3-fluoro-D-gluconate-6-phosphate is derived directly from 3-deoxy-3-fluoro-D-gluconic acid and not as a product of pentose phosphate activity. Direct oxidation and reduction are the major metabolic routes of 3-FG, not metabolism through glycolysis or the pentose phosphate shunt. Thus, 3-FG metabolism coupled with 19F NMR appears to be very useful for monitoring aldose reductase and glucose dehydrogenase activity in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1571422678,"Abstract The organization of the cis-acting regulatory elements of a chick myosin heavy chain gene has been investigated. The data show that a gene which is transcribed in vivo in the fast white embryonic musculature is also the major transcript expressed during myotube differentiation of primary myoblasts derived from 12-day embryonic chick leg muscles. The upstream region of this gene consists of 7500 base pairs, and we have tested the ability of these sequences to drive expression of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene in developing primary muscle cultures. Deletion analyses of the upstream region show that negative regulatory elements are present within 2000 base pairs of the basal promoter elements, the CCAAT and TAATA boxes. Removal of these elements reveals the presence of a strong positive element located near the start site of transcription. Sequence analysis showed that the region also contains a sequence characteristic of an enhancer found in the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene, ATGCAAAT, the element. Gel band-shift assays show that this octa sequence binds a transacting factor present in muscle nuclear extracts, although footprint analysis indicates a limited interaction. Transient assays carried out with a fragment in which the octa sequence has been mutated, with the subsequent abolition of protein binding, shows that the particular interaction probably plays a role in negatively modulating the action of the strong positive promoter element."
https://openalex.org/W1553499974,"Neonatal rat oligodendrocyte (OLG) cultures exposed to 6 h of gradual, progressive hypoxia in a GasPak (BBL, Becton Dickinson) apparatus were not injured or metabolically impaired, but instead showed a specific inhibition of de novo synthesis (measured by [3H]palmitic acid labeling) of the major myelin component galactosylceramide (GalCer). De novo synthesis of the 2-hydroxy fatty acid GalCer (HFA-GalCer) species, which requires O2 for its synthesis, was most severely inhibited (by 65%), while non-hydroxy GalCer species (NFA-GalCer) were less affected. The synthesis of membrane glycerophospholipids and sphingomyelin was unaffected by hypoxia. Treatment of OLG with 12 nM oligomycin, an inhibitor of mitochondrial ATP synthesis, resulted in an inhibition (by 50-60%) of synthesis of all GalCer species. [3H]Palmitate labeling of NFA-ceramide, the ungalactosylated precursor of NFA-GalCer species, increased in both hypoxia and oligomycin treatments, suggesting that the conversion of newly synthesized ceramide to GalCer was blocked. Newly synthesized HFA-ceramide did not accumulate in OLG, but the small labeled HFA-ceramide pool present during hypoxia was not converted into HFA-GalCer. Pulse-chase studies indicated that NFA- and HFA-ceramides labeled during these treatments were available for galactosylation and could be converted into GalCer upon reoxygenation. [3H]Galactose labeling of NFA-GalCer species was enhanced 2-fold in hypoxia, in contrast to the inhibition seen with [3H]palmitic acid labeling. Thus, while de novo GalCer synthesis was blocked in hypoxia, galactosylation of pre-existing ceramide pools was actually enhanced. Our evidence suggests that hypoxia results in a reversible inhibition of transport of newly synthesized ceramide from its site of synthesis to its site of galactosylation, but causes an increase in galactosylation of subcellular pools of pre-existing ceramide."
https://openalex.org/W1526326434,"We have examined the patterns of compartmentalization of several mammalian proteins in Escherichia coli which do not have signal peptides or functional signal peptide equivalents. These proteins include (i) human proapolipoprotein A-I (proapoA-I), a 249-residue protein which contains a hexapeptide NH2-terminal prosegment plus a mature domain of 243 residues comprised of tandemly arrayed, docosapeptide repeats with predicted amphipathic alpha-helical structure; (ii) the mature apoA-I molecule without its prosegment; (iii) mouse interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), a 17-kDa protein which is composed of 12 beta strands that form a tetrahedral structure; and (iv) the 31-kDa precursor of IL-1 beta, proIL-1 beta. Efficient expression of these proteins in E. coli was achieved using a plasmid that contains the nalidixic acid-inducible recA promoter and ribosome binding site from the gene 10 leader of bacteriophage T7. In induced cultures the mammalian proteins represented up to 20% of the total bacterial protein mass. Surprisingly, cell fractionation using cold (osmotic) shock indicated that proapoA-I, apoA-I, and IL-1 beta, but not its 31-kDa precursor, were segregated into the periplasmic space with high efficiency: the ratio of periplasmic space/spheroplast distribution ranged from 0.6 to 1.1 in cells harvested 60-180 min after nalidixic acid induction. Not only was this compartmentalization efficient but it was also selective: analysis of the osmotic shock fractions revealed that the periplasmic space preparations were not contaminated with cytoplasmic proteins (e.g. phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase). Sequential Edman degradation showed that these proteins had not undergone any NH2-terminal proteolytic processing. The mammalian proteins did not affect the export of a prototypic bacterial preprotein, beta-lactamase. Together the data suggest that osmotic shock fractionation of E. coli may facilitate the purification of functional foreign proteins produced in this prokaryote. They also raise the possibility that structural elements in these proteins other than conventional signal peptides may effect periplasmic targeting in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1528015752,"Initially we established that the binding of collagen to human blood platelets stimulates both the rapid loss of PIP2 and the generation of inositol-4,5-bisphosphate (IP2) and inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3). These results indicate that the binding of collagen stimulates inositol phospholipid-specific phospholipase C during platelet activation. The fact that GTP or GTP-gamma-S augments, and pertussis toxin inhibits, collagen-induced IP3 formation suggests that a GTP-binding protein (or (or proteins) may be directly involved in the regulation of phospholipase C-mediated phosphoinositide turnover in human platelets. We have used several complementary techniques to isolate and characterize a platelet 41-kDa polypeptide (or polypeptides) that has a number of structural and functional similarities to the regulatory alpha i subunit of the GTP-binding proteins isolated from bovine brain. This 41-kDa polypeptide (or polypeptides) is found to be closely associated with at least four membrane glycoproteins (e.g., gp180, gp110, gp95, and gp75) in a 330-kDa complex that can be dissociated by treatment with high salt plus urea. Most important, we have demonstrated that antilymphoma 41-kDa (alpha i subunit of GTP-binding proteins) antibody cross-reacts with the platelet 41-kDa protein (or proteins) and the alpha i subunit of bovine brain Gi alpha proteins, and blocks GTP/collagen-induced IP3 formation. These data provide strong evidence that the 41-kDa platelet GTP-binding protein (or proteins) is directly involved in collagen-induced signal transduction during platelet activation."
https://openalex.org/W1562980080,"The structure-function relationships for the human interferon gamma (HuIFN-gamma) were studied using recombinant variants that had various deletions at the carboxyl terminus. Four COOH-terminal deletion variants were constructed that contained the amino-terminal 122, 117, 111, and 106 amino acid residues. These variants were constructed by specific DNA modifications and were expressed in Escherichia coli. The deletion of 21 amino acid residues resulted in only 2- and 3-fold reduction in the antiviral and antiproliferative specific activities, respectively. Thus, the carboxyl-terminal 21 residues are not directly involved in the function of the HuIFN-gamma. The level of intracellular accumulation was also decreased by 3-5-fold. Further deletions of 26, 32, and 37 residues from the COOH terminus resulted in the lack of detectable activity as well as in 50-100-fold reduction in the level of accumulation in the bacterial cell. However, each of the modified plasmids was found to have comparable efficiency in directing the production of the respective variant molecules relative to the full-length HuIFN-gamma molecule in an in vitro transcription-translation assay. Thus, the failure of some of the deletion variant molecules to accumulate in the E. coli cell is likely due to their instability in vitro. The loss of the COOH-terminal 21 amino acid residues of HuIFN-gamma also resulted in a substantial reduction in the ability of the molecule to be renatured in vitro from the treatment with chaotrophic agents, a method frequently used to extract and purify recombinant polypeptides from E. coli host. The latter result may account for some earlier reports which inferred the involvement of the COOH terminus in the functions of the HuIFN-gamma molecule due to their failure to detect activity upon deletions of only 11-18 residues."
https://openalex.org/W1586485082,"The release of Zn2+ from transcription factor IIIA (TFIIIA) was examined with the metallochromic indicator 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol (PAR) in the absence and presence of p-hydroxymercuriphenylsulfonate (PMPS). With 0.5 mM PAR, approximately 5 eq of Zn2+ were released from TFIIIA, but no Zn2+ release was detected from the 7 S ribonucleoprotein. The PMPS-promoted Zn2+ release from TFIIIA was 8.7 +/- 0.4 eq of Zn2+ of which approximately 4 eq of Zn2+ rebound to TFIIIA upon displacement of the mercurial with excess 2-mercaptoethanol. These results suggest that at least two affinity classes of Zn2+ binding sites exist in TFIIIA, one of which is released to 0.5 mM PAR in the absence of PMPS. Also, 18 of the 23 cysteine residues of TFIIIA reacted with 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid). The kinetic data of PAR and 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) reactions with TFIIIA were similar, and the spectral changes were characterized by at least three exponential terms. Both TFIIIA and the 7 S particle were reacted with the thiol-specific fluorescent probe N-iodoacetyl-N'-(5-sulfo-1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine (1,5-I-AEDANS). Complete trypsin hydrolysis followed by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography analysis of peptide mixtures showed only one fluorescent peak from the AEDANS-labeled 7 S particle whereas numerous fluorescent peaks were observed with AEDANS-labeled TFIIIA. This further indicates exposure of cysteine residues from Zn2+ binding domains in TFIIIA. Cys287 was identified as the site of modification by amino acid sequencing of the isolated fluorescent peptide from the derivatized 7 S particle. Limited papain cleavage of the AEDANS-labeled 7 S particle indicated that the modified cysteine is located within a 34-kDa TFIIIA fragment. Gel retardation and transcription assays showed that TFIIIA, which had been purified from the AEDANS-labeled 7 S particle, was capable of binding to the internal control region of 5 S RNA gene and retained transcription activity. Thus, Zn2+ binding domains and all but 1 cysteine residue are buried in the 7 S particle, thereby facilitating site-specific labeling of TFIIIA."
https://openalex.org/W1543493678,"The requirements for FAD-attachment to His71 of 6-hydroxy-D-nicotine oxidase (6-HDNO) were investigated by site-directed mutagenesis. The following amino acid replacements were introduced into the sequence Arg67-Ser68-Gly69-Gly70-His71 of the 6-HDNO-polypeptide: 1) Arg67 was replaced with Ala (A1 mutant); 2) Ser68 was replaced with Ala (A2 mutant); and 3) Arg67 was replaced with Lys (K mutant). The substitution in mutant A2 had no effect on flavinylation, measured as [14C]FAD incorporation into apo-6-HDNO. Replacement of Arg67 with Ala prevented, but replacement with Lys permitted the flavinylation of His71. Mutant A1 showed no 6-HDNO activity, whereas the replacement of Ser with Ala in mutant A2 had only a slight effect on 6-HDNO activity. The substitution of Lys for Arg67, however, reduced the specific 6-HDNO activity in extracts of Escherichia coli cells expressing the mutant polypeptide from 50.3 to 17.5 milliunits/mg protein. It is concluded that a basic amino acid residue (Arg67 or Lys67) is required to mediate the attachment of FAD to His71, and while Lys can substitute for Arg67 in this function, it can only partially replace Arg67 in the enzyme reaction mechanism of 6-HDNO."
https://openalex.org/W1867672924,"The cDNA encoding full-length human tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and five variant cDNAs, constructed by in vitro site-directed mutagenesis, were cloned and expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The variant cDNAs were designed to increase the fibrin affinity of t-PA by mutagenesis in the kringle domains of specific amino acids which are assumed to constitute the lysine-binding site. These amino acids were replaced with the corresponding amino acids present in kringle 1 of plasminogen, which has a high affinity for lysine analogues. The mutants included: rt-PA-Arg125 with a Pro125----Arg mutation; rt-PA-Arg164,Tyr165 with Ser164,Ser165----Arg,Tyr; rt-PA-Arg125,Arg164,Tyr165 with Pro125,Ser164,Ser165----Arg,Arg,Tyr; rt-PA-Arg213 with Val213----Arg; and rt-PA-Arg252 with Thr252----Arg. Compared to wild-type recombinant t-PA (rt-PA), the catalytic efficiency for plasminogen activation was enhanced 4-fold for rt-PA-Arg125, and 3-fold for rt-PA-Arg252 while stimulation of plasminogen activation by CNBr-digested fibrinogen was comparable to wild-type rt-PA for rt-PA-Arg125 and 2-fold enhanced for rt-PA-Arg252. All rt-PA moieties showed a similar concentration-dependent and nearly quantitative binding to fibrin as well as to lysine-Sepharose and induced a similar time- and concentration-dependent lysis of a 125I-fibrin-labeled plasma clot immersed in human plasma. Equieffective concentrations (causing 50% clot lysis in 2 h) were 0.17 micrograms/ml for rt-PA-Arg125, and 0.31 micrograms/ml for rt-PA-Arg252 as compared to 0.55 micrograms/ml for rt-PA. The initial plasma half-life following intravenous bolus injection of 0.25 mg/kg in hamsters was 1.2-2.6 min, not significantly different from wild-type rt-PA (2.4 min). Continuous infusion over 60 min in hamsters with a 125I-fibrin-labeled pulmonary embolus produced 50% clot lysis over background with a dose of 0.9-1.8 mg/kg, which is not markedly superior to wild-type rt-PA (2.1 mg/kg). It is concluded that these variants, designed to mimic the high affinity fibrin-binding site of plasminogen, are not endowed with a markedly improved thrombolytic potency."

The higher molecular weight complexes can be separated from the 200,000 Mr form of this factor by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. Further purification indicates that the majority of the IF-2chl is present as dimeric, tetrameric, and probably hexameric complexes of polypeptides of 97,000-110,000 in molecular weight. In addition, one form consisting of subunits of about 200,000 Mr has been detected. All of these species are active in promoting fMet-tRNA binding to chloroplast 30 S subunits in a message-dependent reaction. Initiation complex formation promoted by IF-2chl requires the presence of GTP. Similar levels of binding are obtained when GTP is replaced by a nonhydrolyzable analog suggesting that IF-2chl is acting stoichiometrically rather than catalytically under the conditions used. The activity of this factor is stimulated by the presence of either Escherichia coli or chloroplast IF-3. None of the forms of IF-2chl detected is active on E. coli ribosomes."
