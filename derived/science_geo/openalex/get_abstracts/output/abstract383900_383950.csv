https://openalex.org/W2073338313,"People exert large amounts of problem-solving effort playing computer games. Simple image- and text-recognition tasks have been successfully 'crowd-sourced' through games, but it is not clear if more complex scientific problems can be solved with human-directed computing. Protein structure prediction is one such problem: locating the biologically relevant native conformation of a protein is a formidable computational challenge given the very large size of the search space. Here we describe Foldit, a multiplayer online game that engages non-scientists in solving hard prediction problems. Foldit players interact with protein structures using direct manipulation tools and user-friendly versions of algorithms from the Rosetta structure prediction methodology, while they compete and collaborate to optimize the computed energy. We show that top-ranked Foldit players excel at solving challenging structure refinement problems in which substantial backbone rearrangements are necessary to achieve the burial of hydrophobic residues. Players working collaboratively develop a rich assortment of new strategies and algorithms; unlike computational approaches, they explore not only the conformational space but also the space of possible search strategies. The integration of human visual problem-solving and strategy development capabilities with traditional computational algorithms through interactive multiplayer games is a powerful new approach to solving computationally-limited scientific problems."
https://openalex.org/W1984246545,"Chemical reactions are triggered by the dynamics of valence electrons in molecular orbitals. These motions typically unfold on a subfemtosecond scale and have eluded real-time access until now. Attosecond spectroscopy (an attosecond is 10−18 seconds), first applied to tracking electronic transitions from one quantum state to another, has now been extended to follow the hyperfast (subfemtosecond) motion of electron wavepackets in the valence shell — the bond-forming electrons — of krypton ions. This first proof-of-principle demonstration uses a simple system, but the expectation is that attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy of this type will ultimately reveal the elementary electron motions in molecules and solid-state materials that determine physical, chemical and biological properties. Attosecond technology (1 as = 10−18 S) promises the tools needed to directly probe electron motion in real time. These authors report attosecond pump–probe measurements that track the movement of valence electrons in krypton ions. This first proof-of-principle demonstration uses a simple system, but the expectation is that attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy will ultimately also reveal the elementary electron motions that underlie the properties of molecules and solid-state materials. The superposition of quantum states drives motion on the atomic and subatomic scales, with the energy spacing of the states dictating the speed of the motion. In the case of electrons residing in the outer (valence) shells of atoms and molecules which are separated by electronvolt energies, this means that valence electron motion occurs on a subfemtosecond to few-femtosecond timescale (1 fs = 10−15 s). In the absence of complete measurements, the motion can be characterized in terms of a complex quantity, the density matrix. Here we report an attosecond pump–probe measurement of the density matrix of valence electrons in atomic krypton ions1. We generate the ions with a controlled few-cycle laser field2 and then probe them through the spectrally resolved absorption of an attosecond extreme-ultraviolet pulse3, which allows us to observe in real time the subfemtosecond motion of valence electrons over a multifemtosecond time span. We are able to completely characterize the quantum mechanical electron motion and determine its degree of coherence in the specimen of the ensemble. Although the present study uses a simple, prototypical open system, attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy should be applicable to molecules and solid-state materials to reveal the elementary electron motions that control physical, chemical and biological properties and processes."
https://openalex.org/W2152435464,"Recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified a locus on chromosome 1p13 strongly associated with both plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and myocardial infarction (MI) in humans. Here we show through a series of studies in human cohorts and human-derived hepatocytes that a common noncoding polymorphism at the 1p13 locus, rs12740374, creates a C/EBP (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein) transcription factor binding site and alters the hepatic expression of the SORT1 gene. With small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown and viral overexpression in mouse liver, we demonstrate that Sort1 alters plasma LDL-C and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particle levels by modulating hepatic VLDL secretion. Thus, we provide functional evidence for a novel regulatory pathway for lipoprotein metabolism and suggest that modulation of this pathway may alter risk for MI in humans. We also demonstrate that common noncoding DNA variants identified by GWASs can directly contribute to clinical phenotypes."

https://openalex.org/W2095885501,"Mutation of the retinoblastoma gene (RB1) tumour suppressor occurs in one-third of all human tumours and is particularly associated with retinoblastoma and osteosarcoma. Numerous functions have been ascribed to the product of the human RB1 gene, the retinoblastoma protein (pRb). The best known is pRb's ability to promote cell-cycle exit through inhibition of the E2F transcription factors and the transcriptional repression of genes encoding cell-cycle regulators. In addition, pRb has been shown in vitro to regulate several transcription factors that are master differentiation inducers. Depending on the differentiation factor and cellular context, pRb can either suppress or promote their transcriptional activity. For example, pRb binds to Runx2 and potentiates its ability to promote osteogenic differentiation in vitro. In contrast, pRb acts with E2F to suppress peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma subunit (PPAR-gamma), the master activator of adipogenesis. Because osteoblasts and adipocytes can both arise from mesenchymal stem cells, these observations suggest that pRb might play a role in the choice between these two fates. However, so far, there is no evidence for this in vivo. Here we use mouse models to address this hypothesis in mesenchymal tissue development and tumorigenesis. Our data show that Rb status plays a key role in establishing fate choice between bone and brown adipose tissue in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2037206515,"SIRT4, a member of the sirtuin family, has been implicated in the regulation of insulin secretion by modulation of glutamate dehydrogenase. However, the role of this enzyme in the regulation of metabolism in other tissues is unknown. In this study we investigated whether depletion of SIRT4 would enhance liver and muscle metabolic functions. To do this SIRT4 was knocked down using an adenoviral shRNA in mouse primary hepatocytes and myotubes. We observed a significant increase in gene expression of mitochondrial and fatty acid metabolism enzymes in hepatocytes with reduced SIRT4 levels. SIRT4 knockdown also increased SIRT1 mRNA and protein levels both in vitro and in vivo. In agreement with the increased fatty acid oxidation (FAO) gene expression, we showed a significant increase in FAO in SIRT4 knockdown primary hepatocytes compared with control, and this effect was dependent on SIRT1. In primary myotubes, knockdown of SIRT4 resulted in increased FAO, cellular respiration, and pAMPK levels. When SIRT4 was knocked down in vivo by tail vein injection of a shRNA adenovirus, we observed a significant increase in hepatic mitochondrial and FAO gene expression consistent with the findings in primary hepatocytes. Taken together these findings demonstrate that SIRT4 inhibition increases fat oxidative capacity in liver and mitochondrial function in muscle, which might provide therapeutic benefits for diseases associated with ectopic lipid storage such as type 2 diabetes.

Sirtuins (SIRTs) 2The abbreviations used are: SIRTsirtuinFAOfatty acid oxidationvp/mlviral particles/mtAMPKAMP-activated protein kinasePPARperoxisome proliferator-activated receptorPGC1αPPARγ coactivator1α. are an evolutionarily conserved family of NAD-dependent family of deacetylases that regulate diverse set of biological processes including stress response, genome maintenance, and energy metabolism (1Guarente L.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). SIRT1, SIRT2, SIRT3, and SIRT5 catalyze the NAD-dependent deacetylation, whereas SIRT4 and SIRT6 have been proposed to mediate ADP-ribosylation of protein substrates. The sirtuins are located in different organelles (4Michan S. Sinclair D. Biochem. J. 2007; 404: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1412) Google Scholar), with SIRT4 mainly localized in the mitochondria (5Haigis M.C. Mostoslavsky R. Haigis K.M. Fahie K. Christodoulou D.C. Murphy A.J.

Recent studies suggested that SIRT4 uses NAD to ADP-ribosylate and inactivate glutamate dehydrogenase, an enzyme that converts glutamate to α-ketoglutarate in mitochondria and thereby suppresses insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells (5Haigis M.C.

In addition to pancreatic beta cells, SIRT4 is highly expressed in brain, liver, kidney, and heart with moderate expression in skeletal muscle (5Haigis M.C. Mostoslavsky R. Haigis K.M. Fahie K.

Based on its mitochondrial localization, we hypothesized that SIRT4 is involved in mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. To test our hypothesis, we knocked down SIRT4 expression in primary hepatocytes and myotubes with an adenovirus expressing a SIRT4 shRNA and assessed fatty acid oxidation and oxygen consumption. In addition, we delivered an shRNA adenovirus in vivo to knock down SIRT4 specifically in liver in mice. sirtuin fatty acid oxidation viral particles/mt AMP-activated protein kinase peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor PPARγ coactivator1α. The sequence of Ad-shRNA-SIRT4 adenovirus was synthesized as described (5Haigis M.C. Mostoslavsky R. Haigis K.M. Fahie K. Christodoulou D.C. Murphy A.J. Valenzuela D.M. Yancopoulos G.D. Karow M.

The primers used were 5′-TTCGAACATATGTCTTCGAAAGCCTCCATTGGGTTAT (forward) and 5′-CTCGAGGCCCTGAAAATACAGGTTTTCGCATGGGTCTATCAAAGGCAG (reverse). The adenovirus was made by Welgen, Inc. 1012 vp/ml virus was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C before use. When ready for the experiments, 5 × 109 vp/ml virus was diluted in William's E media. Primary mouse hepatocytes seeded at 1 × 106 cells/well in 6-well plates were purchased from CellzDirect. Upon cell arrival, media were changed to fresh media following the protocol provided by CellzDirect. Primary mouse myoblasts were plated onto collagen-coated 6-well plates at a density of 8 × 105 cells/well. The following day the cells were washed once with PBS then induced to differentiate by adding DMEM containing 5% horse serum for 3 days, changing the media once. Four hours after changing to fresh media, primary mouse hepatocytes were transduced either with an shRNA-control or shRNA-SIRT4 (5 × 109 vp/ml) adenovirus for 48 h. The medium was replaced the next day with virus-free medium, and cells were harvested 48 h post-infection for RNA, FAO, and protein measurements. Primary myotubes were transduced with 5 × 108 viral particles per well of either sh-scramble or shRNA SIRT4 adenovirus, replacing the media after 24 h. Total RNA was extracted from cells using 1 ml of TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the instructions provided by the supplier. The RNA was extracted following instructions for the mini RNeasy spin column (Qiagen). Hepatocyte cells transduced with control shRNA or shRNA-SIRT4 adenovirus were harvested after 48 h. Cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (Upstate Biotechnology) supplemented with 10 mm NaF (Sigma), 2 mm Na3VO4 (Sigma), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Pierce), 5 μm leupeptin (Sigma), 10 μm pepstatin (Fisher). The lysed cells were further dissolved by vortexing and left on ice for 30 min followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA assay (Pierce). Equal amount of proteins (40 μg/lane) from each treated group mixed with SDS sample buffer (Boston Bioproducts) were loaded on a 4–12% NuPage gel (Invitrogen). After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane (Invitrogen) with the Mini Cell Novex system at 33 V for 1.5 h. The membrane was first blocked with 5% milk, TBS-Tween for 1 h followed by blotting with primary antibodies in 5% milk/TBS-Tween overnight at 4 °C. The chicken anti-mouse actin monoclonal antibody (Chemicon) was used to detect actin as a loading control. SIRT1 protein was detected using the rabbit anti-SIRT1 antibody, diluted 1:1000 (Upstate). After an overnight incubation, the membranes were washed three times with TBS-Tween and blotted with the secondary donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase antibody (Amersham Biosciences) at room temperature for 1 h followed by washing 3 times in TBS-Tween. The proteins were detected with ECL Super Signal West Pico (Pierce) or Super Signal West Dura (Pierce). The Fujifilm scanner (program of imageReaderLAS-3000) was used for detection of the signal. In the Western blot for AMPK, mouse primary hepatocytes were transduced with the shRNA-SIRT4 adenovirus as described above. Forty-eight hours after transduction, the cells were starved for 2 h in 0.1% BSA. The cells were then stimulated with 2 mm 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside by carefully removing half the volume of media and adding a 2× treatment (1 mm final) or vehicle for 30 min. Cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and scraped on ice into lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology) that contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. The cell lysates were then sonicated for 30 s. Nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 10 min), and 20 μg were run on a 4–12% Tris-glycine gel and transferred. The blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking with a phospho-AMP kinase (Thr-172) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) at a 1:500 dilution. The blots were extensively washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (Bio-Rad) and 0.15% dry milk at room temperature and were further incubated with a 1:2000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-coupled rabbit anti-mouse IgG in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were then washed, and the signal was visualized by chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's protocol. After stripping of phospho-αAMP kinase blots, total AMP kinase (Cell Signaling Technology) immunoreactivity was determined. Total RNA was isolated from primary hepatocytes or primary myotubes transduced with control shRNA and shRNA using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit. For primary hepatocytes, cells were washed 2× with PBS and lysed with 500 μl of RNeasy lysis buffer supplied with the kit. The lysate was added to a Qiashredder (Qiagen). Using the manufactures protocol for the RNeasy mini kit, RNA was prepared, and 1 μg was used for the cDNA synthesis reaction. cDNA was made using the Bio-Rad iScript cDNA synthesis kit. For quantitative RT-PCR, cDNA was diluted 1:10, and 2–3 μl was used for each 10-μl PCR reaction. Taqman components include 5 μl of Taqman universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems), 0.5 μl of eukaryotic 18 S rRNA (served as an endogenous control (Applied Biosystems)), or 0.5 μl of PROBE. TaqMan gene expression assay probes for mitochondrial, fatty acid utilization, and transcriptional regulatory genes were purchased from Applied Biosystem (Table 1).TABLE 1Probes for TaqMan gene expression assaysProbe nameApplied Biosystem catalog no.Cytochrome cMm01621044_g1PGC1αMm00447183_m1ERRαMm00433143_m1Isocitrate dehydrogenase 3αMm00499674_m1Cytochrome c oxidase subunit VaMm00432638_m1CPT-1aMm00487200_1mPDK4Mm004443325_m1Medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenaseMm00431611_m1SIRT4Mm001201917_m1SIRT1Mm00490758_mlSIRT3Mm00452129_mlPPARαMm00440930_mlPPARδMm00802186_ml18 SMm4310893E Open table in a new tab Mouse primary hepatocytes seeded at 1 × 106 cells/well in 6-well plates were transduced with an adenovirus expressing LacZ-shRNA (control) or an shRNA-control (scramble) or shRNA-SIRT4 (5 × 109 vp/ml) in culture medium. The medium was changed after 24 h, and cells were used to measure FAO after 48 h post-infection. On the day of the experiment, cells were washed 1× with PBS and incubated in serum-free media containing 0.5 mg/ml BSA and [3H]palmitate (10 μm cold palmitate and 8.93 μCi/ml [3H]palmitate in each well) for 90 min. At the end of the incubation 100 μl of the media were transferred to a 96-well filter plate containing 100 μl of the phosphate-buffered equilibrated activated charcoal slurry (Sigma). The plate was centrifuged for 45 min at 2800 rpm. At the end of centrifugation, the charcoal-containing plate was discarded, and filtrate was counted in scintillation counter. Three biological samples were used for each assay. Mouse primary myoblasts were isolated from FVB mice as described previously (7Wu Z. Huang X. Feng Y. Handschin C. Feng Y. Gullicksen P.S. Bare O.

Myoblasts were plated onto collagen-coated 6-well plates at a density of 800,000 cells/well. The following day the cells were washed once with PBS then induced to differentiate by adding DMEM containing 5% horse serum for 3 days, with one media change. The cells were transduced with 5 × 108 viral particles per well of either shRNA control or shRNA-SIRT4 adenovirus, replacing the media after 24 h. Fatty acid oxidation rates were measured as described previously (7Wu Z. Huang X. Feng Y. Handschin C. Feng Y. Gullicksen P.S. Bare O. Labow M. Spiegelman B. Stevenson S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Mouse primary myoblasts were seeded at 6 × 104 cells per well in differentiation medium containing DMEM with 5% horse serum on XF-24 cell culture plates (Seahorse) coated with rat tail collagen gel. The myotubes were transduced with an shRNA control (scramble) or an shRNA-SIRT4 at 48 h post-differentiation. Cellular oxygen consumption rate was measured by Seahorse XF24 at 48 h transduction. The concentrations of oligomycin and carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone were 1.5 μg/ml and 0.6 μm, respectively. Chow fed, 4-month-old male C57BL/6 mice (Taconic) were housed under a reverse light-dark cycle. Mice were injected via the tail vein with PBS or 5 × 108 pfu/mouse of an adenovirus expressing either a shRNA-SIRT4 or a scramble shRNA-control. Liver and plasma were collected 4 days after administration of the adenovirus. Blood glucose was measured using a handheld glucometer (One Touch Ultra, LifeScan). Liver RNA was isolated as described above. All animal procedures were performed in accordance with animal welfare regulations under an approved institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocol in the Novartis Institute for Biomedical Research animal facility, which is accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Lab Animal Care. db/db, C57BLKS/J (db/db background), ob/ob, C57BL/6J (ob/ob background), and KKAa, KKAy mice of 8 weeks of age were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory and kept on chow diet and normal light cycle. Mice were sacked at 9 a.m. without fasting, and RNAs from the liver tissue (n = 4) for each group were extracted and hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse4302 platform. Raw data in cell file format were normalized using PLIER (Probe Logarithmic Intensity Error) (Affymetrix 2008) and summarized into probe-set level expression values. Welch t tests were performed on SIRT4 gene (probe set id 1426847_at) for differential expression between the diabetes model mice versus their corresponding control. To evaluate the role of SIRT4 in regulating fatty acid oxidation, primary mouse hepatocytes were transduced with the shRNA-SIRT4 or a shRNA-control for 48 h. RNA was extracted, and the expression levels of several key enzymes in fatty acid metabolism were analyzed. SIRT4 mRNA levels were reduced 72% in by the SIRT4-shRNA (Fig. 1A). We observed a significant change in fatty acid oxidation genes including MCAD (medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase), PDK4 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzyme 4), CPT1α (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1α), PPARδ, and PPARα in SIRT4 knockdown primary hepatocytes compared with control (scramble shRNA; Fig. 1, B–F). We determined whether induction of FAO genes would lead to increase fatty acid oxidation in the hepatocytes. Cellular FAO rates were measured in primary hepatocytes either transduced with the shRNA-SIRT4, the scramble shRNA-control, or the LacZ-shRNA (control) at 48 h post-transduction. We observed a significant increase in FAO in cells where SIRT4 was knocked down compared with the control cells (Fig. 1G). Primary mouse hepatocytes were transduced with the shRNA-SIRT4 or a shRNA-control for 48 h. RNA was then extracted, and the expression levels of several key mitochondrial enzymes were analyzed, including PGC1α, ERRα (estrogen-related receptor α), cytochrome c, CoxV, and isocitrate dehydrogenase in SIRT4 knockdown primary hepatocytes (Fig. 2, A–E). These findings suggest SIRT4 negatively regulates FAO through reducing expression of mitochondrial and fatty acid oxidation genes. To investigate the mechanism by which SIRT4 regulates FAO, we again transduced hepatocytes with the -SIRT4 shRNA or a shRNA control for 48 h. We observed a greater than 1.4-fold increase in SIRT1 mRNA levels (Fig. 3A). Consistent with SIRT1 mRNA expression, protein levels of SIRT1 were also increased in SIRT4 knockdown hepatocytes (Fig. 3B). Together this data suggest that SIRT4 negatively regulates SIRT1 in hepatocytes. To address if the increase in FAO upon SIRT4 knockdown was dependent on SIRT1, we knocked down both SIRT4 and SIRT1 in mouse primary hepatocytes and measured FAO (Fig. 3C). As expected, SIRT4 knockdown led to a 2-fold increase in FAO, whereas no significant changes were observed when SIRT1 was knocked down. However, in the SIRT4/SIRT1 double knockdown hepatocytes, we observed a blunted increase in FAO compared with SIRT4 knockdown alone. These data suggest that SIRT1 is necessary for the effect of SIRT4 in modulating FAO in primary hepatocytes. To examine the function of SIRT4 in the intact liver, an shRNA adenovirus targeting SIRT4 was injected into the tail vein of C57BL/6 mice. Four days after administration of the virus, the mice were sacrificed, and liver and blood were collected. Hepatic SIRT4 gene expression was reduced by 50% compared with control, and consistent with data from hepatocytes, the expression of key genes that regulate mitochondrial function and fatty acid oxidation were increased significantly (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, both SIRT1 and SIRT3 were up-regulated about 4- and 2-fold, respectively. To assess liver function, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were measured, and no difference was observed compared with scramble controls (data not shown). Body weight (Fig. 4B) and liver weight (Fig. 4C) were similar to controls, but a slight decrease in blood glucose (Fig. 4D) was observed. Taken together with the data from hepatocytes, these results suggest a role for SIRT4 in regulating hepatic fat metabolism. Next, we investigated the role of SIRT4 in regulating oxidative metabolism in muscle cells. Primary mouse myotubes were transduced with the SIRT4-shRNA or the control adenovirus for 48 h. Total RNA was extracted and subjected to quantitative real time PCR analysis. The expression level of SIRT4 was markedly reduced (95%) by the adenoviral shRNA-SIRT4 (Fig. 5A). We then assessed the effect of SIRT4 knockdown on fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial function in these cells. Fatty acid oxidation rates were increased 90% in the SIRT4 knockdown cells over the controls (Fig. 5B). In addition, SIRT4 knockdown in the primary mouse myotubes significantly enhanced the basal and maximum (carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP)) cellular respiration rates (Fig. 5C). The uncoupling respiration (oligomycin), however, was not altered by SIRT4 knockdown (Fig. 5C). To further investigate the role of SIRT4 in myotubes, we evaluated the phosphorylation status of AMPK upon knockdown of SIRT4. We observed an increase in basal and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside-stimulated pAMPK levels when SIRT4 was knocked down in primary myotubes (Fig. 5, D and E). Consistent with the effects in hepatocytes, these studies suggest that SIRT4 is a negative regulator of fat oxidation and overall mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. Based on our data from hepatocytes and liver, we hypothesized that Sirt4 gene expression would be altered in the liver of mouse models with diabetes and hepatic steatosis. Indeed, Sirt4 mRNA levels were significantly increased in ob/ob, db/db, and KKAy strains (Fig. 6A). Therefore, increased hepatic SIRT4 levels may contribute to the disease phenotype of these diabetic mouse models. Sir2 is an NAD-dependent deacetylase that links metabolism with longevity in yeast, flies, and worms. Mammals have seven Sir2 orthologs (SIRT1–7) (3Frye R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). SIRT4 is a mitochondrial enzyme that has been reported to use NAD to ADP-ribosylate and down-regulate glutamate dehydrogenase activity (5Haigis M.C. Mostoslavsky R. Haigis K.M. Fahie K. Christodoulou D.C. Murphy A.J. Valenzuela D.M. Yancopoulos G.D. Karow M. Blander G. Wolberger C. Prolla T.A. Weindruch R. Alt F.W. Guarente L.

However, a recent study has called into question whether this purported ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of the sirtuins is physiologically relevant (8Du J. Jiang H. Lin H. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 2878-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Regardless of the precise mechanism, there is compelling evidence that SIRT4 is an important metabolic regulator via its effects on insulin secretion in beta cells (6Ahuja N. Schwer B. Carobbio S. Waltregny D. North B.J. Castronovo V. Maechler P. Verdin E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 33583-33592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). However, the metabolic functions of SIRT4 in other peripheral tissues are not well understood. In this manuscript we present our studies testing the hypothesis that SIRT4 functions in mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. Several conclusions can be drawn from our studies. First, we observed that shRNA-mediated suppression of SIRT4 levels in both primary hepatocytes and intact liver was associated with the enhanced expression of genes that control fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial oxidative capacity and that these changes in gene expression correlated with increased FAO in primary hepatocytes. Loss of SIRT4 activity in primary hepatocytes and intact liver led to increased expression of SIRT1 and SIRT3. When we prevented the increase SIRT1 in SIRT4-deficient cells, FAO was no longer enhanced, indicating that SIRT1 is required for the enhanced oxidative capacity of SIRT4 deficiency. We also show that loss of SIRT4 in myotubes is associated with increased AMPK, FAO, and oxygen consumption, suggesting SIRT4 contributes to the regulation of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in multiple cell types. Taken together, these results suggest that SIRT4 is a negative regulator of oxidative metabolism, which is in stark contrast to the functions of SIRT1 and SIRT3, which enhance the oxidative capacity of tissues. Another major finding from these studies is that our data support a functional interplay among the SIRTs to coordinate the flow of energy during a given metabolic state. We show that the increase FAO in response to loss of SIRT4 function was associated with increased SIRT1 and SIRT3 expression and that the enhanced expression of SIRT1 was required for the increased FAO in primary hepatocytes. Interestingly similar patterns of SIRT expression are observed in states of high metabolic demand, such as fasting, calorie restriction, or exercise. For example, fasting and/or calorie restriction is associated with increased expression of hepatic SIRT1 and SIRT3, whereas SIRT4 expression is repressed. Thus, SIRTs appear to be nodes in a network designed to integrate metabolic signals and effectively control the production and utilization of energy via enhanced fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial oxidative capacity. The exact mechanism in which SIRT4 regulates lipid metabolism is not known. One possibility is that SIRT4 directly ribosylates and inhibits a critical enzyme in the fatty acid oxidation pathway analogous to the regulation of glutamate dehydrogenase by SIRT4 (Fig. 6B). Loss of SIRT4 function would then be expected to result in increased fatty acid oxidation. Whether SIRTs serve as physiologically relevant ADP ribosyltransferases has been recently challenged. Du et al. (8Du J. Jiang H. Lin H. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 2878-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) find that SIRT-dependent ADP-ribosylation is orders of magnitude less efficient than a bacterial ADP-ribosyltransferase. Nonetheless, precedent for NAD-dependent modification of mitochondrial β-oxidation proteins was recently reported. SIRT3 was demonstrated to directly stimulate fatty acid oxidation in the liver by catalyzing the NAD-dependent deacetylation of long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD) resulting in the activation of the enzyme (21Hirschey M.D. Shimazu T. Goetzman E. Jing E. Schwer B. Lombard D.B. Grueter C.A. Harris C. Biddinger S. Ilkayeva O.R. Stevens R.D. Li Y. Saha A.K. Ruderman N.B. Bain J.R. Newgard C.B. Farese Jr., R.V. Alt F.W. Kahn C.R. Verdin E. Nature. 2010; 464: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar). Interestingly, SIRT3 was previously shown to deacetylate glutamate dehydrogenase (9Lombard D.B. Alt F.W. Cheng H.L. Bunkenborg J. Streeper R.S. Mostoslavsky R. Kim J. Yancopoulos G. Valenzuela D. Murphy A. Yang Y. Chen Y. Hirschey M.D. Bronson R.T. Haigis M. Guarente L.P. Farese Jr., R.V. Weissman S. Verdin E. Schwer B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 8807-8814Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar), which is believed to activate enzyme as chemical acetylation of the protein has been shown to inhibit its activity in vitro (10Colman R.F. Frieden C. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3661-3670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Colman R.F. Frieden C. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3652-3660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This begs the questions of whether SIRT3 and SIRT4 reciprocally regulate the same factors given the current metabolic demand of the cell, where SIRT3 activates and SIRT4 inhibits the catabolic enzymes involved in energy production. Another potential mechanism for the regulation of fat oxidation by SIRT4 is modulation of the AMPK-SIRT1 pathway. In this study we identified an increase in SIRT1 mRNA and protein levels in response to SIRT4 knockdown (Fig. 3, A and B). How a primary change in a mitochondrial SIRT4 affects the expression of nuclear SIRT1 is unknown but could be related to alterations in NAD/NADH ratios, AMP/ATP ratios, or perhaps even generation of PPARα ligands. These types of changes in cellular metabolites could be expected to be generated in mitochondria by alterations of fatty acid metabolism and diffuse into the nucleus. SIRT1 is a positive regulator of both PPARα and PGC1α transcriptional activity in the liver (12Gerhart-Hines Z. Rodgers J.T. Bare O. Lerin C. Kim S.H. Mostoslavsky R. Alt F.W. Wu Z. Puigserver P.

Nature. 2005; 434: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (2610) Google Scholar). These are two key mediators of the hepatic response to fasting that increase expression of genes involved in β-oxidation leading to increased FAO. Liver-specific deletion of SIRT1 impairs the hepatic response to fasting by inhibiting induction of PPARα target genes resulting in blunted FAO compared with wild-type controls (15Rodgers J.T. Puigserver P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 12861-12866Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Conversely, overexpression of SIRT1 in the liver induces PPARα target genes (CPT1 and MCAD), and SIRT1 transgenic mice show protection from diet-induced hepatic steatosis (16Purushotham A. Schug T.T. Xu Q. Surapureddi S. Guo X. Li X. Cell Metab. 2009; 9: 327-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). These findings support the concept that increased SIRT1 levels in response to SIRT4 knockdown play a role in the observed increase in FAO. The increase in SIRT1 levels observed in myotubes might also explain the increase in FAO observed with SIRT4 knockdown. SIRT1 deacetylases PGC1α in muscle cells and mediates the switch from using glucose to free fatty acids during periods of nutrient limitation, such as fasting or exercise (12Gerhart-Hines Z. Rodgers J.T. Bare O. Lerin C. Kim S.H. Mostoslavsky R. Alt F.W. Wu Z. Puigserver P. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1913-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar, 14Rodgers J.T. Lerin C. Haas W. Gygi S.P. Spiegelman B.M. Puigserver P. Nature. 2005; 434: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (2610) Google Scholar). SIRT1 knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) have decreased expression of mitochondrial and fatty acid oxidation genes (12Gerhart-Hines Z. Rodgers J.T. Bare O. Lerin C. Kim S.H. Mostoslavsky R. Alt F.W. Wu Z. Puigserver P. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1913-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). Our studies demonstrated increased AMPK activity in response to SIRT4 knockdown (Fig. 5, D and E). Activation of AMPK increases NAD levels (17Cantó C. Gerhart-Hines Z. Feige J.N. Lagouge M.

Sartorelli V. Dev. Cell. 2008; 14: 661-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), thereby promoting deacetylation/activation of the SIRT1 targets such as PGC-1α and FOXO proteins (Fig. 6B) (17Cantó C. Gerhart-Hines Z. Feige J.N. Lagouge M. Noriega L. Milne J.C. Elliott P.J. Puigserver P. Auwerx J. Nature. 2009; 458: 1056-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (2403) Google Scholar). Thereby, SIRT1 and AMPK regulate the switch to mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acids in response to nutrient limitation. Alternatively, SIRT1 has been shown to regulate AMPK in controlling hepatic lipid metabolism (19Lan F. Cacicedo J.M. Ruderman N. Ido Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27268-27635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 20Hou X. Xu S. Maitland-Toolan K.A. Sato K. Jiang B. Ido Y. Lan F. Walsh K. Wierzbicki M. Verbeuren T.J. Cohen R.A. Zang M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20015-20026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). In particular, SIRT1-mediated activation of AMPK (via deacetylation of LKB1) increases acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) phosphorylation which results in increased FAO. In this study we identify a novel role for SIRT4 in the regulation of fatty acid oxidation. SIRT4 may function upstream of AMPK and SIRT1 and play an important role in energy metabolism. Taken together, these findings suggest that SIRT4 inhibition may improve hepatic insulin sensitivity via increased fat oxidative capacity and, hence, may be beneficial for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

https://openalex.org/W2083222974,"In addition to its global North-South anisotropy(1), there are two other enigmatic seismological observations related to the Earth's inner core: asymmetry between its eastern and western hemispheres(2-6) and the presence of a layer of reduced seismic velocity at the base of the outer core(6-12). This 250-km-thick layer has been interpreted as a stably stratified region of reduced composition in light elements(13). Here we show that this layer can be generated by simultaneous crystallization and melting at the surface of the inner core, and that a translational mode of thermal convection in the inner core can produce enough melting and crystallization on each hemisphere respectively for the dense layer to develop. The dynamical model we propose introduces a clear asymmetry between a melting and a crystallizing hemisphere which forms a basis for also explaining the East-West asymmetry. The present translation rate is found to be typically 100 million years for the inner core to be entirely renewed, which is one to two orders of magnitude faster than the growth rate of the inner core's radius. The resulting strong asymmetry of buoyancy flux caused by light elements is anticipated to have an impact on the dynamics of the outer core and on the geodynamo."

Methodology/Principal Findings We analyzed neural differentiation from various hiPSC lines generated by others and ourselves. Although heterogeneity in efficiency of neuroepithelial (NE) cell differentiation was observed among different hiPSC lines, the NE differentiation process resembles that from human embryonic stem cells (hESC) in morphology, timing, transcriptional profile, and requirement for FGF signaling. NE cells differentiated from hiPSC, like those from hESC, can also form rostral phenotypes by default, and form the midbrain or spinal progenitors upon caudalization by morphogens. The rostrocaudal neural progenitors can further mature to develop forebrain glutamatergic projection neurons, midbrain dopaminergic neurons, and spinal motor neurons, respectively. Typical ion channels and action potentials were recorded in the hiPSC-derived neurons. Conclusions/Significance Our results demonstrate that hiPSC, regardless of how they were derived, can differentiate into a spectrum of rostrocaudal neurons with functionality, which supports the considerable value of hiPSC for study and treatment of patient-specific neural disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2046415390,"The ability of retrotransposons to mobilize and insert into genes presents a challenge to a cell needing to maintain its genomic integrity. Garcia-Perez et al. have studied retrotransposition in embryonic carcinoma-derived cells. On insertion into the DNA, the retrotransposon is quickly silenced by a chromatin-dependent mechanism. However, this process is specific for certain retrotransposons, implying that multiple silencing mechanisms may exist. Once cells differentiate, the ability to silence newly introduced retrotransposons is lost, but previously inactivated retrotransposons remain inactive. This suggests that either a crucial silencing factor is not expressed in differentiated cells, or that a repressor of silencing is activated in differentiated cells. The ability of retrotransposons to mobilize and insert into genes presents a challenge to a cell needing to maintain its genomic integrity. These authors have studied retrotransposition in embryonic carcinoma-derived cells. On insertion into DNA, the retrotransposon is quickly silenced, but the retrotransposon-specificity of this process implies that multiple silencing mechanisms may exist. Once cells differentiate, the ability to silence newly introduced retrotransposons is lost but previously inactivated retrotransposons remain inactive. Long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) retrotransposition continues to affect human genome evolution1,2. L1s can retrotranspose in the germline, during early development and in select somatic cells3,4,5,6,7,8; however, the host response to L1 retrotransposition remains largely unexplored. Here we show that reporter genes introduced into the genome of various human embryonic carcinoma-derived cell lines (ECs) by L1 retrotransposition are rapidly and efficiently silenced either during or immediately after their integration. Treating ECs with histone deacetylase inhibitors rapidly reverses this silencing, and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that reactivation of the reporter gene was correlated with changes in chromatin status at the L1 integration site. Under our assay conditions, rapid silencing was also observed when reporter genes were delivered into ECs by mouse L1s and a zebrafish LINE-2 element, but not when similar reporter genes were delivered into ECs by Moloney murine leukaemia virus or human immunodeficiency virus, suggesting that these integration events are silenced by distinct mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate that subjecting ECs to culture conditions that promote differentiation attenuates the silencing of reporter genes delivered by L1 retrotransposition, but that differentiation, in itself, is not sufficient to reactivate previously silenced reporter genes. Thus, our data indicate that ECs differ from many differentiated cells in their ability to silence reporter genes delivered by L1 retrotransposition."

https://openalex.org/W2127604272,"Background Angiogenesis plays an important role in a wide range of physiological processes, and many diseases are associated with the dysregulation of angiogenesis. Radix Astragali is a Chinese medicinal herb commonly used for treating cardiovascular disorders and has been shown to possess angiogenic effect in previous studies but its active constituent and underlying mechanism remain unclear. The present study investigates the angiogenic effects of calycosin, a major isoflavonoid isolated from Radix Astragali, in vitro and in vivo. Methodology Tg(fli1:EGFP) and Tg(fli1:nEGFP) transgenic zebrafish embryos were treated with different concentrations of calycosin (10, 30, 100 µM) from 72 hpf to 96 hpf prior morphological observation and angiogenesis phenotypes assessment. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to calycosin (10, 100 µM) from 72 hpf to 78 hpf before gene-expression analysis. The effects of VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor on calycosin-induced angiogenesis were studied using 72 hpf Tg(fli1:EGFP) and Tg(fli1:nEGFP) zebrafish embryos. The pro-angiogenic effects of calycosin were compared with raloxifene and tamoxifen in 72 hpf Tg(fli1:EGFP) zebrafish embryos. The binding affinities of calycosin to estrogen receptors (ERs) were evaluated by cell-free and cell-based estrogen receptor binding assays. Human umbilical vein endothelial cell cultures (HUVEC) were pretreated with different concentrations of calycosin (3, 10, 30, 100 µM) for 48 h then tested for cell viability and tube formation. The role of MAPK signaling in calycosin-induced angiogenesis was evaluated using western blotting. Conclusion Calycosin was shown to induce angiogenesis in human umbilical vein endothelial cell cultures (HUVEC) in vitro and zebrafish embryos in vivo via the up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 mRNA expression. It was demonstrated that calycosin acted similar to other selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), such as raloxifene and tamoxifen, by displaying selective potency and affinity to estrogen receptors ERα and ERβ. Our results further indicated that calycosin promotes angiogenesis via activation of MAPK with the involvement of ERK1/2 and ER. Together, this study revealed, for the first time, that calycosin acts as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) to promote angiogenesis, at least in part through VEGF-VEGFR2 and MAPK signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2063313245,"The mecA gene, encoding methicillin resistance in staphylococci, is located on a mobile genetic element called Staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome mec (SCCmec). Horizontal, interspecies transfer of this element could be an important factor in the dissemination of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Previously, we reported the isolation of a closely related methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), MRSA and potential SCCmec donor Staphylococcus epidermidis isolate from the same patient. Based on fingerprint techniques we hypothesized that the S. epidermidis had transferred SCCmec to the MSSA to become MRSA. The aim of this study was to show that these isolates form an isogenic pair and that interspecies horizontal SCCmec transfer occurred.Whole genome sequencing of both isolates was performed and for the MSSA gaps were closed by conventional sequencing. The SCCmec of the S. epidermidis was also sequenced by conventional methods. The results show no difference in nucleotide sequence between the two isolates except for the presence of SCCmec in the MRSA. The SCCmec of the S. epidermidis and the MRSA are identical except for a single nucleotide in the ccrB gene, which results in a valine to alanine substitution. The main difference with the closely related EMRSA-16 is the presence of SaPI2 encoding toxic shock syndrome toxin and exfoliative toxin A in the MSSA-MRSA pair. No transfer of SCCmec from the S. epidermidis to the MSSA could be demonstrated in vitro.The MSSA and MRSA form an isogenic pair except for SCCmec. This strongly supports our hypothesis that the MRSA was derived from the MSSA by interspecies horizontal transfer of SCCmec from S. epidermidis O7.1."
https://openalex.org/W2079616858,"Background Motor neuron loss is characteristic of cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) and contributes to functional deficit. Methodology/Principal Findings In order to investigate the amenability of the injured adult spinal cord to motor neuron differentiation, we transplanted spinal cord injured animals with a high purity population of human motor neuron progenitors (hMNP) derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). In vitro, hMNPs displayed characteristic motor neuron-specific markers, a typical electrophysiological profile, functionally innervated human or rodent muscle, and secreted physiologically active growth factors that caused neurite branching and neuronal survival. hMNP transplantation into cervical SCI sites in adult rats resulted in suppression of intracellular signaling pathways associated with SCI pathogenesis, which correlated with greater endogenous neuronal survival and neurite branching. These neurotrophic effects were accompanied by significantly enhanced performance on all parameters of the balance beam task, as compared to controls. Interestingly, hMNP transplantation resulted in survival, differentiation, and site-specific integration of hMNPs distal to the SCI site within ventral horns, but hMNPs near the SCI site reverted to a neuronal progenitor state, suggesting an environmental deficiency for neuronal maturation associated with SCI. Conclusions/Significance These findings underscore the barriers imposed on neuronal differentiation of transplanted cells by the gliogenic nature of the injured spinal cord, and the physiological relevance of transplant-derived neurotrophic support to functional recovery."
https://openalex.org/W2088604169,"Relatively few studies have been reported that document how proprioception varies across the workspace of the human arm. Here we examined proprioceptive function across a horizontal planar workspace, using a new method that avoids active movement and interactions with other sensory modalities. We systematically mapped both proprioceptive acuity (sensitivity to hand position change) and bias (perceived location of the hand), across a horizontal-plane 2D workspace. Proprioception of both the left and right arms was tested at nine workspace locations and in 2 orthogonal directions (left-right and forwards-backwards). Subjects made repeated judgments about the position of their hand with respect to a remembered proprioceptive reference position, while grasping the handle of a robotic linkage that passively moved their hand to each judgement location. To rule out the possibility that the memory component of the proprioceptive testing procedure may have influenced our results, we repeated the procedure in a second experiment using a persistent visual reference position. Both methods resulted in qualitatively similar findings. Proprioception is not uniform across the workspace. Acuity was greater for limb configurations in which the hand was closer to the body, and was greater in a forward-backward direction than in a left-right direction. A robust difference in proprioceptive bias was observed across both experiments. At all workspace locations, the left hand was perceived to be to the left of its actual position, and the right hand was perceived to be to the right of its actual position. Finally, bias was smaller for hand positions closer to the body. The results of this study provide a systematic map of proprioceptive acuity and bias across the workspace of the limb that may be used to augment computational models of sensory-motor control, and to inform clinical assessment of sensory function in patients with sensory-motor deficits."
https://openalex.org/W2014715016,"Background The Firth of Clyde is a large inlet of the sea that extends over 100 km into Scotland's west coast. Methods We compiled detailed fisheries landings data for this area and combined them with historical accounts to build a picture of change due to fishing activity over the last 200 years. Findings In the early 19th century, prior to the onset of industrial fishing, the Firth of Clyde supported diverse and productive fisheries for species such as herring (Clupea harengus, Clupeidae), cod (Gadus morhua, Gadidae), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus, Gadidae), turbot (Psetta maxima, Scophthalmidae) and flounder (Platichthys flesus, Pleuronectidae). The 19th century saw increased demand for fish, which encouraged more indiscriminate methods of fishing such as bottom trawling. During the 1880s, fish landings began to decline, and upon the recommendation of local fishers and scientists, the Firth of Clyde was closed to large trawling vessels in 1889. This closure remained in place until 1962 when bottom trawling for Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus, Nephropidae) was approved in areas more than three nautical miles from the coast. During the 1960s and 1970s, landings of bottomfish increased as trawling intensified. The trawl closure within three nautical miles of the coast was repealed in 1984 under pressure from the industry. Thereafter, bottomfish landings went into terminal decline, with all species collapsing to zero or near zero landings by the early 21st century. Herring fisheries collapsed in the 1970s as more efficient mid-water trawls and fish finders were introduced, while a fishery for mid-water saithe (Pollachius virens, Gadidae) underwent a boom and bust shortly after discovery in the late 1960s. The only commercial fisheries that remain today are for Nephrops and scallops (Pecten maximus, Pectinidae). Significance The Firth of Clyde is a marine ecosystem nearing the endpoint of overfishing, a time when no species remain that are capable of sustaining commercial catches. The evidence suggests that trawl closures helped maintain productive fisheries through the mid-20th century, and their reopening precipitated collapse of bottomfish stocks. We argue that continued intensive bottom trawling for Nephrops with fine mesh nets will prevent the recovery of other species. This once diverse and highly productive environment will only be restored if trawl closures or other protected areas are re-introduced. The Firth of Clyde represents at a small scale a process that is occurring ocean-wide today, and its experience serves as a warning to others."
https://openalex.org/W2025041034,"A simple and sensitive method to quantitatively measure the cytolytic effect of tumor-specific T killer cells is highly desirable for basic and clinical studies. Chromium (51Cr) release assay has been the “gold standard” for quantifying cytolytic activities of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) against target cells and this method is still being used in many laboratories. However, a major drawback of this method is the use of radioactive materials, which is inconvenient to handle because of environmental safety concerns and expensive due to the short half-life of the isotope. Consequently, several nonradioactive methods have been reported recently. Here we report a new method that we recently developed for quantifying antigen-specific cytolytic activity of CTLs. This method fully exploits the high sensitivity and the relative simplicity of luciferase quantitative assay. We initially expected the released luciferase in the supernatant to be the adequate source for monitoring cell death. However, to our total surprise, incubation of these killer T cells with the tumor cell targets did not result in significant release of luciferase in the culture medium. Instead, we found that the remaining luciferase inside the cells could accurately reflect the overall cell viability."

Because Stat3 is constitutively activated in CLL and sequence analysis revealed that the ROR1 promoter harbors gamma-interferon activation sequence-like elements typically activated by Stat3, we hypothesized that Stat3 activates ROR1.Because IL-6 induced Stat3 phosphorylation and upregulated Ror1 protein levels in MM1 cells, we used these cells as a model. We transfected MM1 cells with truncated ROR1 promoter luciferase reporter constructs and found that IL-6 induced luciferase activity of ROR1-195 and upstream constructs. Co-transfection with Stat3 siRNA reduced the IL-6-induced luciferase activity, suggesting that IL-6 induced luciferase activity by activating Stat3. EMSA and the ChIP assay confirmed that Stat3 binds ROR1, and EMSA studies identified two Stat3 binding sites. In CLL cells, EMSA and ChIP studies determined that phosphorylated Stat3 bound to the ROR1 promoter at those two ROR1 promoter sites, and ChIP analysis showed that Stat3 co-immunoprecipitated DNA of STAT3, ROR1, and several Stat3-regulated genes. Finally, like STAT3-siRNA in MM1 cells, STAT3-shRNA downregulated STAT3, ROR1, and STAT3-regulated genes and Stat3 and Ror1 protein levels in CLL cells.Our data suggest that constitutively activated Stat3 binds to the ROR1 promoter and activates ROR1 in CLL cells."

These 6-residue segments of PrP centered on residue 129 are ""steric zippers,"" pairs of interacting β-sheets. Both structures of these ""homozygous steric zippers"" reveal direct intermolecular interactions between Met or Val in one sheet and the identical residue in the mating sheet.

https://openalex.org/W2047979773,"After DNA damage, cells must decide between different fates including growth arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis. Both p53 and E2F1 are transcription factors involved in the decision process. However, the mechanism for cross-talk between the p53 and E2F1 pathways still remains unclear. Here, we proposed a four-module kinetic model of the decision process and explored the interplay between these two pathways in response to ionizing radiation via computer simulation. In our model the levels of p53 and E2F1 separately exhibit pulsatile and switching behaviors. Upon DNA damage, p53 is first activated, whereas E2F1 is inactivated, leading to cell cycle arrest in the G(1) phase. We found that the ultimate decision between cell life and death is determined by the number of p53 pulses depending on the extent of DNA damage. For repairable DNA damage, the cell can survive and reenter the S phase because of the activation of E2F1 and inactivation of p53. For irreparable DNA damage, growth arrest is overcome by growth factors, and activated p53 and E2F1 cooperate to initiate apoptosis. We showed that E2F1 promotes apoptosis by up-regulating the proapoptotic cofactors of p53 and procaspases. It was also revealed that deregulated E2F1 by oncogene activation can make cells sensitive to DNA damage even in low serum medium. Our model consistently recapitulates the experimental observations of the intricate relationship between p53 and E2F1 in the DNA damage response. This work underscores the significance of E2F1 in p53-mediated cell fate decision and may provide clues to cancer therapy."

Megakaryocytes generated from S1P(4)-deficient murine bone marrow showed atypical and reduced formation of proplatelets in vitro. The recovery of platelet numbers after experimental thrombocytopenia was significantly delayed in S1p4(-/-) mice. Remarkably, overexpression and stimulation of S1P(4) in human erythroleukemia HEL cells promoted endomitosis, formation of cytoplasmic extensions, and subsequent release of platelet-like particles.

The crystal structure of West Nile virus MTase in complex with SIN inhibitor at 2.0-Å resolution revealed a flavivirus-conserved hydrophobic pocket located next to the AdoMet-binding site. The pocket is functionally critical in the viral replication and cap methylations. In addition, the N7 methylation efficiency was found to correlate with the viral replication ability. Thus, SIN analogs with modifications that interact with the hydrophobic pocket are potential specific inhibitors of flavivirus MTase."
https://openalex.org/W1999189085,"Rheb is a homolog of Ras GTPase that regulates cell growth, proliferation, and regeneration via mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Because of the well established potential of activated Ras to promote survival, we sought to investigate the ability of Rheb signaling to phenocopy Ras. We found that overexpression of lipid-anchored Rheb enhanced the apoptotic effects induced by UV light, TNFα, or tunicamycin in an mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1)-dependent manner. Knocking down endogenous Rheb or applying rapamycin led to partial protection, identifying Rheb as a mediator of cell death. Ras and c-Raf kinase opposed the apoptotic effects induced by UV light or TNFα but did not prevent Rheb-mediated apoptosis. To gain structural insight into the signaling mechanisms, we determined the structure of Rheb-GDP by NMR. The complex adopts the typical canonical fold of RasGTPases and displays the characteristic GDP-dependent picosecond to nanosecond backbone dynamics of the switch I and switch II regions. NMR revealed Ras effector-like binding of activated Rheb to the c-Raf-Ras-binding domain (RBD), but the affinity was 1000-fold lower than the Ras/RBD interaction, suggesting a lack of functional interaction. shRNA-mediated knockdown of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK-1) strongly reduced UV or TNFα-induced apoptosis and suppressed enhancement by Rheb overexpression. In conclusion, Rheb-mTOR activation not only promotes normal cell growth but also enhances apoptosis in response to diverse toxic stimuli via an ASK-1-mediated mechanism. Pharmacological regulation of the Rheb/mTORC1 pathway using rapamycin should take the presence of cellular stress into consideration, as this may have clinical implications."

We have previously shown that S100A4 is overexpressed in diseased cartilage and that extracellular S100A4 stimulates MMP-13 production, a major type II collagen-degrading enzyme, via activation of receptor for advanced glycation end product signaling. In the present study, using human articular chondrocytes, we show that intracellular S100A4 translocated into the nucleus upon interleukin-1β (IL-1β) stimulation and translocation required post-translational modification of S100A4 by the sumo-1 protein. Two sumoylation sites were identified on the S100A4 molecule, Lys22 and Lys96. Mutation of these lysine residues abolished the ability of S100A4 to be sumoylated and to translocate into the nucleus. Blocking of sumoylation and nuclear transport of S100A4 inhibited the IL-1β-induced production of MMP-13. Nuclear S100A4 was bound to the promoter region of MMP-13 in IL-1β-treated cells.

https://openalex.org/W2044132424,"The beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2AR) is expressed on numerous cell-types including airway smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes. Drugs (agonists or antagonists) acting at these receptors for treatment of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and heart failure show substantial interindividual variability in response. The ADRB2 gene is polymorphic in noncoding and coding regions, but virtually all ADRB2 association studies have utilized the two common nonsynonymous coding SNPs, often reaching discrepant conclusions.We constructed the 8 common ADRB2 haplotypes derived from 26 polymorphisms in the promoter, 5'UTR, coding, and 3'UTR of the intronless ADRB2 gene. These were cloned into an expression construct lacking a vector-based promoter, so that beta2AR expression was driven by its promoter, and steady state expression could be modified by polymorphisms throughout ADRB2 within a haplotype. ""Whole-gene"" transfections were performed with COS-7 cells and revealed 4 haplotypes with increased cell surface beta2AR protein expression compared to the others. Agonist-promoted downregulation of beta2AR protein expression was also haplotype-dependent, and was found to be increased for 2 haplotypes. A phylogenetic tree of the haplotypes was derived and annotated by cellular phenotypes, revealing a pattern potentially driven by expression.Thus for obstructive lung disease, the initial bronchodilator response from intermittent administration of beta-agonist may be influenced by certain beta2AR haplotypes (expression phenotypes), while other haplotypes may influence tachyphylaxis during the response to chronic therapy (downregulation phenotypes). An ideal clinical outcome of high expression and less downregulation was found for two haplotypes. Haplotypes may also affect heart failure antagonist therapy, where beta2AR increase inotropy and are anti-apoptotic. The haplotype-specific expression and regulation phenotypes found in this transfection-based system suggest that the density of genetic information in the form of these haplotypes, or haplotype-clusters with similar phenotypes can potentially provide greater discrimination of phenotype in human disease and pharmacogenomic association studies."
https://openalex.org/W2115497111,"Aging of the human retina is characterized by progressive pathology, which can lead to vision loss. This progression is believed to involve reactive metabolic intermediates reacting with constituents of Bruch's membrane, significantly altering its physiochemical nature and function. We aimed to replace a myriad of techniques following these changes with one, Raman spectroscopy. We used multiplexed Raman spectroscopy to analyze the age-related changes in 7 proteins, 3 lipids, and 8 advanced glycation/lipoxidation endproducts (AGEs/ALEs) in 63 postmortem human donors. We provided an important database for Raman spectra from a broad range of AGEs and ALEs, each with a characteristic fingerprint. Many of these adducts were shown for the first time in human Bruch's membrane and are significantly associated with aging. The study also introduced the previously unreported up-regulation of heme during aging of Bruch's membrane, which is associated with AGE/ALE formation. Selection of donors ranged from ages 32 to 92 yr. We demonstrated that Raman spectroscopy can identify and quantify age-related changes in a single nondestructive measurement, with potential to measure age-related changes in vivo. We present the first directly recorded evidence of the key role of heme in AGE/ALE formation."
https://openalex.org/W1969330887,"Background Action potentials are the essential unit of neuronal encoding. Somatic sequential spikes in the central nervous system appear various in amplitudes. To be effective neuronal codes, these spikes should be propagated to axonal terminals where they activate the synapses and drive postsynaptic neurons. It remains unclear whether these effective neuronal codes are based on spike timing orders and/or amplitudes. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigated this fundamental issue by simultaneously recording the axon versus soma of identical neurons and presynaptic vs. postsynaptic neurons in the cortical slices. The axons enable somatic spikes in low amplitude be enlarged, which activate synaptic transmission in consistent patterns. This facilitation in the propagation of sequential spikes through the axons is mechanistically founded by the short refractory periods, large currents and high opening probability of axonal voltage-gated sodium channels. Conclusion/Significance An amplification of somatic incomplete spikes into axonal complete ones makes sequential spikes to activate consistent synaptic transmission. Therefore, neuronal encoding is likely based on spike timing order, instead of graded analogues."
https://openalex.org/W1977264228,"Infection with the bacterial pathogen Francisella tularensis tularensis (F. tularensis) causes tularemia, a serious and debilitating disease. Francisella tularensis novicida strain U112 (abbreviated F. novicida), which is closely related to F. tularensis, is pathogenic for mice but not for man, making it an ideal model system for tularemia. Intracellular pathogens like Francisella inhibit the innate immune response, thereby avoiding immune recognition and death of the infected cell. Because activation of inflammatory pathways may lead to cell death, we reasoned that we could identify bacterial genes involved in inhibiting inflammation by isolating mutants that killed infected cells faster than the wild-type parent. We screened a comprehensive transposon library of F. novicida for mutant strains that increased the rate of cell death following infection in J774 macrophage-like cells, as compared to wild-type F. novicida. Mutations in 28 genes were identified as being hypercytotoxic to both J774 and primary macrophages of which 12 were less virulent in a mouse infection model. Surprisingly, we found that F. novicida with mutations in four genes (lpcC, manB, manC and kdtA) were taken up by and killed macrophages at a much higher rate than the parent strain, even upon treatment with cytochalasin D (cytD), a classic inhibitor of macrophage phagocytosis. At least 10-fold more mutant bacteria were internalized by macrophages as compared to the parent strain if the bacteria were first fixed with formaldehyde, suggesting a surface structure is required for the high phagocytosis rate. However, bacteria were required to be viable for macrophage toxicity. The four mutant strains do not make a complete LPS but instead have an exposed lipid A. Interestingly, other mutations that result in an exposed LPS core were not taken up at increased frequency nor did they kill host cells more than the parent. These results suggest an alternative, more efficient macrophage uptake mechanism for Francisella that requires exposure of a specific bacterial surface structure(s) but results in increased cell death following internalization of live bacteria."

https://openalex.org/W2162078915,"Several forms of learning, including classical conditioning of the eyeblink, depend upon the cerebellum. In examining mechanisms of eyeblink conditioning in rabbits, reversible inactivations of the control circuitry have begun to dissociate aspects of cerebellar cortical and nuclear function in memory consolidation. It was previously shown that post-training cerebellar cortical, but not nuclear, inactivations with the GABAA agonist muscimol prevented consolidation but these findings left open the question as to how final memory storage was partitioned across cortical and nuclear levels. Memory consolidation might be essentially cortical and directly disturbed by actions of the muscimol, or it might be nuclear, and sensitive to the raised excitability of the nuclear neurons following the loss of cortical inhibition. To resolve this question, we simultaneously inactivated cerebellar cortical lobule HVI and the anterior interpositus nucleus of rabbits during the post-training period, so protecting the nuclei from disinhibitory effects of cortical inactivation. Consolidation was impaired by these simultaneous inactivations. Because direct application of muscimol to the nuclei alone has no impact upon consolidation, we can conclude that post-training, consolidation processes and memory storage for eyeblink conditioning have critical cerebellar cortical components. The findings are consistent with a recent model that suggests the distribution of learning-related plasticity across cortical and nuclear levels is task-dependent. There can be transfer to nuclear or brainstem levels for control of high-frequency responses but learning with lower frequency response components, such as in eyeblink conditioning, remains mainly dependent upon cortical memory storage."
https://openalex.org/W2046635777,"Improved understanding of lung cancer development and progression, including insights from studies of animal models, are needed to combat this fatal disease. Previously, we found that mice with a knockout (KO) of G-protein coupled receptor 5A (Gprc5a) develop lung tumors after a long latent period (12 to 24 months).To determine whether a tobacco carcinogen will enhance tumorigenesis in this model, we administered 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) i.p. to 2-months old Gprc5a-KO mice and sacrificed groups (n=5) of mice at 6, 9, 12, and 18 months later. Compared to control Gprc5a-KO mice, NNK-treated mice developed lung tumors at least 6 months earlier, exhibited 2- to 4-fold increased tumor incidence and multiplicity, and showed a dramatic increase in lesion size. A gene expression signature, NNK-ADC, of differentially expressed genes derived by transcriptome analysis of epithelial cell lines from normal lungs of Gprc5a-KO mice and from NNK-induced adenocarcinoma was highly similar to differential expression patterns observed between normal and tumorigenic human lung cells. The NNK-ADC expression signature also separated both mouse and human adenocarcinomas from adjacent normal lung tissues based on publicly available microarray datasets. A key feature of the signature, up-regulation of Ube2c, Mcm2, and Fen1, was validated in mouse normal lung and adenocarcinoma tissues and cells by immunohistochemistry and western blotting, respectively.Our findings demonstrate that lung tumorigenesis in the Gprc5a-KO mouse model is augmented by NNK and that gene expression changes induced by tobacco carcinogen(s) may be conserved between mouse and human lung epithelial cells. Further experimentation to prove the reliability of the Gprc5a knockout mouse model for the study of tobacco-induced lung carcinogenesis is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2037839494,"TGFβ induces fibrosis in healing corneal wounds, and in vitro corneal keratocytes up-regulate expression of several fibrosis-related genes in response to TGFβ. Hyaluronan (HA) accumulates in healing corneas, and HA synthesis is induced by TGFβ by up-regulation of HA synthase 2. This study tested the hypothesis that HA acts as an extracellular messenger, enhancing specific fibrotic responses of keratocytes to TGFβ. HA synthesis inhibitor 4-methylumbelliferone (4MU) blocked TGFβ induction of HA synthesis in a concentration-dependent manner. 4MU also inhibited TGFβ-induced up-regulation of α-smooth muscle actin, collagen type III, and extra domain A-fibronectin. Chemical analogs of 4MU also inhibited fibrogenic responses in proportion to their inhibition of HA synthesis. 4MU, however, showed no effect on TGFβ induction of luciferase by the 3TP-Lux reporter plasmid. Inhibition of HA using siRNA to HA synthase 2 reduced TGFβ up-regulation of smooth muscle actin, fibronectin, and cell division. Similarly, brief treatment of keratocytes with hyaluronidase reduced TGFβ responses. These results suggest that newly synthesized cell-associated HA acts as an extracellular enhancer of wound healing and fibrosis in keratocytes by augmenting a limited subset of the cellular responses to TGFβ."
https://openalex.org/W2042599488,"Background Tissue organization during embryonic development and wound healing depends on the ability of cells on the one hand to exchange adhesive bonds during active rearrangement and on the other to become fixed in place as tissue homeostasis is reached. Cells achieve these contradictory tasks by regulating either cell-cell adhesive bonds, mediated by cadherins, or cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) connections, regulated by integrins. Integrin α5β1 and soluble fibronectin (sFN) are key players in cell-ECM force generation and in ECM polymerization. Here, we explore the interplay between integrin α5β1 and sFN and its influence on tissue mechanical properties and cell sorting behavior. Methodology/Principal Findings We generated a series of cell lines varying in α5β1 receptor density. We then systematically explored the effects of different sFN concentrations on aggregate biomechanical properties using tissue surface tensiometry. We found previously unreported complex behaviors including the observation that interactions between fibronectin and integrin α5β1 generates biphasic tissue cohesion profiles. Specifically, we show that at constant sFn concentration, aggregate cohesion increases linearly as α5β1 receptor density is increased from low to moderate levels, producing a transition from viscoelastic-liquid to pseudo viscoelastic-solid behavior. However, further increase in receptor density causes an abrupt drop in tissue cohesion and a transition back to viscoelastic-liquid properties. We propose that this may be due to depletion of sFn below a critical value in the aggregate microenvironment at high α5β1 levels. We also show that differential expression of α5β1 integrin can promote phase-separation between cells. Conclusions/Significance The interplay between α5-integrin and sFn contributes significantly to tissue cohesion and, depending on their level of expression, can mediate a shift from liquid to elastic behavior. This interplay represents a tunable level of control between integrins and the ECM that can influence tissue cohesion and other mechanical properties, which may translate to the specification of tissue structure and function. These studies provide insights into important biological processes such as embryonic development, wound healing, and for tissue engineering applications."
https://openalex.org/W2077813502,"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are highly aggressive tumors which originate from Schwann cells and develop in about 10% of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients. The five year survival rate is poor and more effective therapies are needed. Sunitinib is a drug targeting receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) like PDGFRalpha, c-Kit and VEGFR-2. These genes are structurally related and cluster on chromosomal segment 4q12.Here we characterize this region by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) in MPNST. Our probe set encompasses the 3 adjacent RTK genes (PDGFRA, KIT, KDR) and 6 flanking genes. We found amplification of several genes within this region in a subset of MPNST and MPNST cell lines. Transcript and protein expression of PDGFRA matched well with its increased copy number suggesting a central role of PDGFRA within the amplicon. Studying the effect of sunitinib on 5 MPNST cell lines revealed that cell line S462 harboring the 4q12 amplicon was extremely sensitive to the drug with an IC50 below 1.0 microM. Moreover, sunitinib induced apoptosis and prevented PDGF-AA induced signaling via PDGFRalpha as determined by western blotting. Co-expression of VEGF and its receptor VEGFR-2 (KDR) was present in MPNST cell lines suggesting an autocrine loop. We show that VEGF triggered signal transduction via the MAPK pathway, which could be blocked by sunitinib.Since multiple receptors targeted by sunitinib are expressed or over-expressed by MPNST cells sunitinib appears as an attractive drug for treatment of MPNST patients. Presence of the 4q12 amplicon and subsequent over-expression of PDGFRA might serve as predictive markers for efficacy of sunitinib."

Participants received a comprehensive ophthalmic examination in their homes, including visual acuity testing by one of three experienced ophthalmologists. The principal cause for visual loss was determined by an experienced ophthalmologist using portable diagnostic instruments. Information about previous cataract surgery, satisfaction with surgery and barriers to cataract surgery were collected. The prevalence of self-reported diabetes was also determined. The prevalence of bilateral blindness (VA<3/60 in the better eye with available correction) was 3.4% (95% CI: 2.7-4.0), 2.0% (95% CI: 1.4-2.5) for severe visual impairment (VA>or=3/60 and <6/60), and 7.4% (95% CI: 6.4-8.3) for visual impairment (VA>or=6/60 and <6/18). Avoidable causes (i.e. cataract, refractive error, aphakia, surgical complications, corneal scarring and phthysis) accounted for 80.0% of bilateral blindness, severe visual impairment (70.7%) and visual impairment (86.2%). Cataract was the main cause of blindness (55.0%). The prevalence of blindness was higher in Gaza (4.9%, 95% CI: 3.7-6.1%) than in the West Bank (2.5%, 95% CI: 1.9-3.1%) and among women (4.3%,95% CI: 3.3-5.2%) compared to men (2.2%,95%CI:1.5-2.9%). Among people who had undergone cataract surgery in the past, only 54.5% of eyes obtained a good outcome (VA>or=6/18), 23.2% had a borderline outcome (VA<6/18 and >or=6/60) and 22.3% had a poor outcome (VA<6/60) with available correction. The prevalence of self-reported diabetes mellitus in >or=50 year age group was 26.4% (95% CI: 24.9-27.9).The prevalence of blindness suggests that significant numbers of people in the Occupied Palestinian Territories exist who do not access eye care - predominantly women and those residing in Gaza.

A single injection of DC/sIL-4, when administered to normoglycemic 12-week old NOD mice, significantly reduced the number of mice that developed diabetes. Furthermore, DC/sIL-4, but not control DC, decreased the number of mice progressing to diabetes when given to prediabetic NOD mice 12-16 weeks of age.

We show that the molecular mechanism by which IFNγ regulates SRF is via activation of the 2-5A-RNase L system, which triggers SRF mRNA decay and reduced SRF expression. As a result, decreased SRF expression reduces expression of SRF target genes such as smooth muscle α-actin and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain. Additionally, IFNγ reduced p300 and acetylated histone-3 binding in both smooth muscle α-actin and SRF promoters, epigenetically decreasing smooth muscle α-actin and SRF transcriptional activation.

https://openalex.org/W1977059681,"Humans need to solve computationally intractable problems such as visual search, categorization, and simultaneous learning and acting, yet an increasing body of evidence suggests that their solutions to instantiations of these problems are near optimal. Computational complexity advances an explanation to this apparent paradox: (1) only a small portion of instances of such problems are actually hard, and (2) successful heuristics exploit structural properties of the typical instance to selectively improve parts that are likely to be sub-optimal. We hypothesize that these two ideas largely account for the good performance of humans on computationally hard problems. We tested part of this hypothesis by studying the solutions of 28 participants to 28 instances of the Euclidean Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Participants were provided feedback on the cost of their solutions and were allowed unlimited solution attempts (trials). We found a significant improvement between the first and last trials and that solutions are significantly different from random tours that follow the convex hull and do not have self-crossings. More importantly, we found that participants modified their current better solutions in such a way that edges belonging to the optimal solution (“good” edges) were significantly more likely to stay than other edges (“bad” edges), a hallmark of structural exploitation. We found, however, that more trials harmed the participants' ability to tell good from bad edges, suggesting that after too many trials the participants “ran out of ideas.” In sum, we provide the first demonstration of significant performance improvement on the TSP under repetition and feedback and evidence that human problem-solving may exploit the structure of hard problems paralleling behavior of state-of-the-art heuristics."
https://openalex.org/W1998171574,"Mathematical aspects of coverage and gaps in genome assembly have received substantial attention by bioinformaticians. Typical problems under consideration suppose that reads can be experimentally obtained from a single genome and that the number of reads will be set to cover a large percentage of that genome at a desired depth. In metagenomics experiments genomes from multiple species are simultaneously analyzed and obtaining large numbers of reads per genome is unlikely. We propose the probability of obtaining at least one contig of a desired minimum size from each novel genome in the pool without restriction based on depth of coverage as a metric for metagenomic experimental design. We derive an approximation to the distribution of maximum contig size for single genome assemblies using relatively few reads. This approximation is verified in simulation studies and applied to a number of different metagenomic experimental design problems, ranging in difficulty from detecting a single novel genome in a pool of known species to detecting each of a random number of novel genomes collectively sized and with abundances corresponding to given distributions in a single pool."

Additionally, we evaluated the effectiveness and robustness of 50K autosomal SNPs with various clustering methods, along with their dependencies on recombination hotspots (RH), linkage disequilibrium (LD), missing calls and regional specific markers. The RH- and LD-free multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) method showed a broad picture of human migration from Africa to North-East Asia on our genome map, supporting results from previous haploid DNA studies. Of the Asian groups, the East Asian group showed greater differentiation than the Northern and Southern Asian groups with respect to Fst statistics. By extension, the analysis of monomorphic markers implied that nine out of ten historical regions in South Korea, and Tokyo in Japan, showed signs of genetic drift caused by the later settlement of East Asia (South Korea, Japan and China), while Gyeongju in South East Korea showed signs of the earliest settlement in East Asia. In the genome map, the gene flow to the Korean Peninsula from its neighboring countries indicated that some genetic signals from Northern populations such as the Siberians and Mongolians still remain in the South East and West regions, while few signals remain from the early Southern lineages."

https://openalex.org/W2071229050,"Podocytes are uniquely structured cells that are critical to the kidney filtration barrier. Their anatomic location on the outer side of the glomerular capillaries expose podocytes to large quantities of both plasma and urinary components and thus are reachable for drug delivery. Recent years have made clear that interference with podocyte-specific disease pathways can modulate glomerular function and influence severity and progression of glomerular disease.Here, we describe studies that show efficient transport of proteins into the mammalian cells mouse 3T3 fibroblasts and podocytes, utilizing an approach termed profection. We are using synthetic lipid structures that allow the safe packing of proteins or antibodies resulting in the subsequent delivery of protein into the cell. The uptake of lipid coated protein is facilitated by the intrinsic characteristic of cells such as podocytes to engulf particles that are physiologically retained in the extracellular matrix. Profection of the restriction enzyme MunI in 3T3 mouse fibroblasts caused an increase in DNA degradation. Moreover, purified proteins such as beta-galactosidase and the large GTPase dynamin could be profected into podocytes using two different profection reagents with the success rate of 95-100%. The delivered beta-galactosidase enzyme was properly folded and able to cleave its substrate X-gal in podocytes. Diseased podocytes are also potential recipients of protein cargo as we also delivered fluorophore labeled IgG into puromycin treated podocytes. We are currently optimizing our protocol for in vivo profection.Protein transfer is developing as an exciting tool to study and target highly differentiated cells such as podocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1988375250,"Although the regulation of thyroid stimulating hormone β-subunit gene (TSHβ) has been intensively studied, the functions of transcription factors involved are not fully understood. The authors found that the -615/-516 promoter region of the TSHβ interacts specifically with nuclear proteins derived from pituitary tissue or from cultured thyrotroph cells. The actual binding site at the nucleotide level, as revealed by DNase I protection assay, includes the consensus sequence for nuclear factor I (NFI). RT-PCR analysis indicated that NFI-B expression is restricted to thyrotroph cells in the anterior pituitary. EMSA and ChIP analysis showed that NFI-B binds most efficiently to the -588/-560 region of TSHβ promoter. The forced expressions of NFI-B markedly reduced TSHβ promoter activity and its mRNA expression. Furthermore, it was also shown that the -588/-560 region is involved in the insulin-mediated repression of the TSHβ. It was of particular interest to observe that NFI-B was recruited to the -588/-560 region of the TSHβ promoter in an insulin-dependent manner. Taken together, this study provides new insights of the delicate regulations of energy metabolism and hormonal homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1966306862,"The heat shock response is widely used as a surrogate of the general protein quality control system within the cell. This system plays a significant role in aging and many protein folding diseases as well as the responses to other physical and chemical stressors.In this study, a broad-based functional genomics approach was taken to identify potential regulators of the mammalian heat shock response. In the primary screen, a total of 13724 full-length genes in mammalian expression vectors were individually co-transfected into human embryonic kidney cells together with a human HSP70B promoter driving firefly luciferase. A subset of the full-length genes that showed significant activation in the primary screen were then evaluated for their ability to hyper-activate the HSP70B under heat shock conditions. Based on the results from the secondary assay and gene expression microarray analyses, eight genes were chosen for validation using siRNA knockdown. Of the eight genes, only PRKCI showed a statistically significant reduction in the heat shock response in two independent siRNA duplexes compared to scrambled controls. Knockdown of the PRKCI mRNA was confirmed using quantitative RT-PCR. Additional studies did not show a direct physical interaction between PRKCI and HSF1.The results suggest that PRKCI is an indirect co-regulator of HSF1 activity and the heat shock response. Given the underlying role of HSF1 in many human diseases and the response to environmental stressors, PRKCI represents a potentially new candidate for gene-environment interactions and therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W1988331576,"Identifying DNA polymorphisms that affect molecular processes like transcription, splicing, or translation typically requires genotyping and experimentally characterizing tissue from large numbers of individuals, which remains expensive and time consuming. Here we introduce an alternative strategy: a “synthetic association study” in which we computationally predict molecular phenotypes on artificial genomes containing randomly sampled combinations of polymorphic alleles, and perform a classical association study to identify genotypes underlying variation in these computationally predicted annotations. We applied this method to characterize the effects on gene structure of 32,792 single-nucleotide polymorphisms between two strains of the antibiotic producing fungus Penicilium chrysogenum. Although these SNPs represent only 0.1 percent of the nucleotides in the genome, they collectively altered 1.8 percent of predicted gene models between these strains. To determine which SNPs or combinations of SNPs were responsible for this variation, we predicted protein-coding genes in 500 intermediate genomes, each identical except for randomly chosen alleles at each SNP position. Of 30,468 gene models in the genome, 557 varied across these 500 genomes. 226 of these polymorphic gene models (40%) were perfectly correlated with individual SNPs, all of which were within or immediately proximal to the affected gene. The genetic architectures of the other 321 were more complex, with several examples of SNP epistasis that would have been difficult to predict a priori. We expect that many of the SNPs that affect computational gene structure reflect a biologically unrealistic sensitivity of the gene prediction algorithm to sequence changes, and we propose that genome annotation algorithms could be improved by minimizing their sensitivity to natural polymorphisms. However, many of the SNPs we identified are likely to affect transcript structure in vivo, and the synthetic association study approach can be easily generalized to any computed genome annotation to uncover relationships between genotype and important molecular phenotypes."
