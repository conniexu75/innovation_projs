https://openalex.org/W4239858085,"We have used the pH-induced self-assembly of a peptide-amphiphile to make a nanostructured fibrous scaffold reminiscent of extracellular matrix. The design of this peptide-amphiphile allows the nanofibers to be reversibly cross-linked to enhance or decrease their structural integrity. After cross-linking, the fibers are able to direct mineralization of hydroxyapatite to form a composite material in which the crystallographic c axes of hydroxyapatite are aligned with the long axes of the fibers. This alignment is the same as that observed between collagen fibrils and hydroxyapatite crystals in bone."
https://openalex.org/W2026632078,"Adhesions between fibroblastic cells and extracellular matrix have been studied extensively in vitro, but little is known about their in vivo counterparts. Here, we characterized the composition and function of adhesions in three-dimensional (3D) matrices derived from tissues or cell culture. ""3D-matrix adhesions"" differ from focal and fibrillar adhesions characterized on 2D substrates in their content of alpha5beta1 and alphavbeta3 integrins, paxillin, other cytoskeletal components, and tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Relative to 2D substrates, 3D-matrix interactions also display enhanced cell biological activities and narrowed integrin usage. These distinctive in vivo 3D-matrix adhesions differ in structure, localization, and function from classically described in vitro adhesions, and as such they may be more biologically relevant to living organisms."

We have used high-density oligonucleotide arrays, in combination with somatic cell genetics, to identify a large fraction of all common human chromosome 21 SNPs and to directly observe the haplotype structure defined by these SNPs. This structure reveals blocks of limited haplotype diversity in which more than 80% of a global human sample can typically be characterized by only three common haplotypes."
https://openalex.org/W1968552183,"The checkpoint kinases ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (ATM and Rad3 related) transduce genomic stress signals to halt cell cycle progression and promote DNA repair. We report the identification of an ATR-interacting protein (ATRIP) that is phosphorylated by ATR, regulates ATR expression, and is an essential component of the DNA damage checkpoint pathway. ATR and ATRIP both localize to intranuclear foci after DNA damage or inhibition of replication. Deletion of ATR mediated by the Cre recombinase caused the loss of ATR and ATRIP expression, loss of DNA damage checkpoint responses, and cell death. Therefore, ATR is essential for the viability of human somatic cells. Small interfering RNA directed against ATRIP caused the loss of both ATRIP and ATR expression and the loss of checkpoint responses to DNA damage. Thus, ATRIP and ATR are mutually dependent partners in cell cycle checkpoint signaling pathways."

Biometry indicated storage of 1.6 +/- 0.4 megagrams of carbon per hectare per year over 8 years, 60% in live biomass and the balance in coarse woody debris and soils, confirming eddy-covariance results. Weather and seasonal climate (e.g., variations in growing-season length or cloudiness) regulated seasonal and interannual fluctuations of carbon uptake. Legacies of prior disturbance and management, especially stand age and composition, controlled carbon uptake on the decadal time scale, implying that eastern forests could be managed for sequestration of carbon."
https://openalex.org/W1964083750,"We determined a crystal structure of bovine Arp2/3 complex, an assembly of seven proteins that initiates actin polymerization in eukaryotic cells, at 2.0 angstrom resolution. Actin-related protein 2 (Arp2) and Arp3 are folded like actin, with distinctive surface features. Subunits ARPC2 p34 and ARPC4 p20 in the core of the complex associate through long carboxyl-terminal α helices and have similarly folded amino-terminal α/β domains. ARPC1 p40 is a seven-blade β propeller with an insertion that may associate with the side of an actin filament. ARPC3 p21 and ARPC5 p16 are globular α-helical subunits. We predict that WASp/Scar proteins activate Arp2/3 complex by bringing Arp2 into proximity with Arp3 for nucleation of a branch on the side of a preexisting actin filament."
https://openalex.org/W2085627522,"The transcription factor RUNX2 (Cbfa1/AML3/Pebp2αA) is a critical regulator of osteoblast differentiation. We investigated the effect of the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α (TNF) on the expression of RUNX2 because TNF is known to inhibit differentiation of osteoblasts from pluripotent progenitor cells. TNF treatment of fetal calvaria precursor cells or MC3T3-E1 clonal pre-osteoblastic cells caused a dose-dependent suppression of RUNX2 steady state mRNA as measured by reverse transcription-PCR. The IC50for TNF inhibition was 0.6 ng/ml. TNF suppression of RUNX2 mRNA was confirmed using Northern analysis. The effect of TNF was studied using isoform-specific primers that flanked unique regions of two major RUNX2 isoforms. TNF suppressed expression of the mRNA coding for the shorter MRIPV isoform by >90% while inhibiting expression of the mRNA for the longer MASNS isoform by 50%. RUNX2 nuclear content was evaluated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a rat osteocalcin promoter binding sequence as probe and by Western analysis. TNF reduced nuclear RUNX2 protein. Inhibition of new protein synthesis with cycloheximide failed to prevent TNF inhibition of RUNX2 mRNA, suggesting that a newly translated protein did not mediate the TNF effect. RUNX2 mRNA half-life was 1.8 h and reduced to 0.9 h by TNF. The effect of TNF on RUNX2 gene transcription was evaluated using a 0.6-kb RUNX2 promoter-luciferase reporter in MC3T3-E1 cells. TNF caused a dose-dependent inhibition of transcription to 50% of control values. The inhibitory effect of TNF was preserved with deletions to nucleotide −108 upstream of the translational start site; however, localization downstream of nucleotide −108 was obscured by loss of basal activity. Our results indicate that TNF regulates RUNX2 expression at multiple levels including destabilization of mRNA and suppression of transcription. The disproportionate inhibition of RUNX2 nuclear protein suggests that additional post-transcriptional mechanisms may be occurring. Suppression of RUNX2 by TNF may decrease osteoblast differentiation and inhibit bone formation in TNF excess states.

TNF has a major role as an inflammatory mediator in rheumatoid arthritis where increased bone resorption causes periarticular bone loss, and in postmenopausal osteoporosis in which there is generalized bone loss (1Ralston S.H.

In addition to the effects of TNF on bone resorption, TNF also inhibits the bone-forming function of osteoblasts. In mature osteoblasts TNF inhibits the expression of the skeletal matrix proteins type I collagen and osteocalcin, causes resistance to the genomic action of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, and increases the production of matrix metalloproteinases and pathologic paracrine factors (6Centrella M.

We have shown previously that TNF inhibits the differentiation of new osteoblasts from precursor cells (12Gilbert L. He X. Farmer P. Boden S. Kozlowski M. Rubin J. Nanes M.S. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3956-3964Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In the presence of low concentrations of TNF, fetal calvaria precursor cells fail to form a mineralized matrix or to express the bone-specific osteocalcin gene. Similarly, clonal MC3T3-E1 cells, which spontaneously differentiate to the osteoblast phenotype, remain undifferentiated after TNF treatment and fail to form a matrix that is competent for mineralization. Osteoblasts differentiate from pluripotent precursor cells that have the capacity to become adipocytes, skeletal muscle cells, tendon, or fibroblasts (13Aubin J.E. Liu F. Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G.

During differentiation, a program of gene expression occurs that is characterized by sequential steps of proliferation, phenotype selection, skeletal gene expression, and finally apoptosis (18Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Marcus R. Feldman D. Kelsey J. Osteoporosis. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Stanford, CA2001Google Scholar). A number of hormonal, paracrine, and autocrine signals regulate the steps that promote differentiation along an osteoblastic trajectory, rather than the selection of other cell phenotypes. The way in which TNF inhibits the program of osteoblast differentiation is unknown but could involve suppression of a critical regulator. RUNX2 (Cbfa1/AML3/Pebp2αA) is a runt related transcription factor that is essential for osteoblast differentiation (19Banerjee C. McCabe L.R. Choi J.Y. Hiebert S.W. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. J.

RUNX2 regulates the expression of several osteoblastic genes including α1(I)collagen, osteopontin, bone sialoprotein, and the skeletal-specific osteocalcin gene (23Ducy P. Starbuck M. Priemel M.

The binding of nuclear RUNX2 to osteoblast-specific elements up-regulates skeletal genes and consequently the osteoblast phenotype. Mice engineered as nullizygous for both RUNX2 alleles are born with a completely cartilaginous skeleton (21Komori T. Yagi H. Nomura S. Yamaguchi A. Sasaki K. Deguchi K. Shimizu Y. Bronson R.T.

These experiments established the requirement for RUNX2 in osteoblast differentiation during embryogenesis. Studies in cultured cells suggest that RUNX2 expression is regulated by bone morphogenic proteins and transforming growth factor-β. In addition, glucocorticoids may modulate RUNX2 at the levels of mRNA and protein expression (25Tsuji K. Ito Y. Noda M. Bone. 1998; 22: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 26Lee M.H.

In the adult, osteoblasts are recruited from pluripotent stem cells during a continuous remodeling and repair process that recapitulates ontogenic events; thus, factors that regulate RUNX2 are important during development and in the mature skeleton. Here we hypothesize that TNF inhibits osteoblast differentiation, in part, through suppression of RUNX2 expression. The regulation of RUNX2 by TNF could diminish recruitment of osteoblast precursors into the pool of mature bone-forming cells and contribute toward inhibition of bone formation in TNF-excess states such as rheumatoid arthritis and menopause.

The protein assay dye reagent was purchased from Bio-Rad, and bovine serum albumin solution for standards was from Pierce. T4 polynucleotide kinase was purchased from Promega. Primers for RT-PCR and oligomeric probes for Northern analysis and electromobility shift assays were synthesized by the Emory University Microchemical Facility (Atlanta, GA). Zeta-Probe Membranes were purchased from Bio-Rad. Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, [γ-32P]ATP, and [α-32P]dCTP were purchased from Amersham Biosciences Inc. GeneAmp® RNA PCR core kits were purchased from PE Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Antibodies for Western blots and electromobility shift assays were obtained from Oncogene (La Jolla, CA). Tween 20 was obtained from J.T. Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ). The plasmid carrying the rat Cbfa1/RUNX2 (−600) promoter construct with a luciferase reporter and its deletion constructs have been described previously (31Drissi H. Luc Q. Shakoori R. Chuva De Sousa Lopes S. Choi J.Y. Terry A. Hu M. Jones S. Neil J.C. Lian J.B. Stein J.L. Van Wijnen A.J. Stein G.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 184: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The reporter includes the native TATA, cap site, first ATG (MLHSP start site), and 5′-untranslated sequence ending at the second ATG (MASNS start site). The pSV40β-galactosidase plasmid was purchased from Promega. The Emory University and Veterans Affairs Medical Center animal use committee approved all procedures. Timed pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Cultures of primary and secondary fetal rat calvaria cells were prepared as described previously (12Gilbert L. He X. Farmer P. Boden S. Kozlowski M. Rubin J. Nanes M.S. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3956-3964Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The clonal osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1, clone 14, was kindly provided by Dr. Rene Franceschi (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). This cell line has been described extensively (32Wang D. Christensen K. Chawla K. Xiao G. Krebsbach P.H. Franceschi R.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Stock cultures were grown in MEM + 10% FBS without l-ascorbate to maintain the cells in an undifferentiated state. For experiments, cells were plated in MEM + 10% FBS and differentiation was initiated by adding 50 μg/mll-ascorbate at the desired time and 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate on day 8 to promote mineralization. Total cellular RNA was prepared from fetal rat calvaria or MC3T3-E1 cultures by adding TRIzol® (1 ml/well of a six-well plate or 1 ml/60-mm plate) to lyse the cells. Chloroform was added (0.2 ml/sample) to separate the aqueous and organic phases, followed by precipitation of the RNA with isopropanol (0.5 ml/sample). Northern analysis for RUNX2 was carried out by fractionating total RNA in a 2.2 mformaldehyde gel followed by capillary transfer to Zeta-Probe membrane. Cbfa1/RUNX2 mRNA species were detected using a cDNA probe spanning the mouse RUNX2 sequence nucleotides 670:1050 that included the RUNT homology domain (GenBank™ accession no. AF010284) after random primer labeling with [32P]dCTP. Membranes were stripped and re-hybridized with a human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe. mRNA band intensity was quantitated using a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and results were calculated for each time point as RUNX2/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and normalized to the control sample. Semiquantitative RT-PCR was carried out using 0.5 μg of total cellular RNA/reaction. Preliminary experiments determined the optimum PCR cycle number within the linear range of amplification for each gene being measured. The primers used are shown in Table I. [32P]dCTP-labeled PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 15% polyacrylamide gel. Results were quantitated using the PhosphorImager and corrected for 18 S RNA amplified from the same samples in the PCR reaction. The following primers were used for RT-PCR. Primers spanning the conserved RUNT homology domain used for RUNX2 semiquantitative PCR (5′>3′) were Cbfa1 forward (CCAGATGGGACTGTGGTTACC) and Cbfa1 reverse (ACTTGGTGCAGAGTTCAGGG). Isoform-specific primers as labeled in Fig. 3 were P1/MASNS isoform forward primer 1 (ATGCTTCATTCGCCTCACAAAC), reverse primer 2 (AGTCCCTCCTTTTTTTTCCAG), and P2/MRIPV isoform forward primer 5 (ATGCGTATTCCTGTAGATCCGAG) and reverse primer 6 (CATCATTCCCGGCCATGACGGTAAC). MC3T3-E1 cells were plated at 200,000 cells/2.0 ml/well in six-well plates in MEM + 10% FBS (3 wells/group; plating = day 0). Cultures were transiently transfected on day 1 using Effectene according to the following protocol. The medium was aspirated, each well was washed once with 1.5 ml of calcium/magnesium-free D-PBS, and MEM + 10% FBS (2.0 ml/well) was added to each well. Transfection mixtures for each well contained 0.55 μg of pCbfa1(−600)LUC (the RUNX2 promoter reporter), 0.125 μg of pSV40β-Gal, and an amount of filler plasmid to equalize total DNA/well to 0.8 μg. Plasmids were diluted into Qiagen Buffer EC to bring the total volume to 100 μl for each well, and 6.4 μl of Enhancer and 8 μl of Effectene were added to the mixtures according to the manufacturer's instructions. MEM + 10% FBS (0.5 ml/well) was added to each reaction mixture and the transfection mix was applied dropwise to each well while swirling the plate. TNF was added 3 h after transfection without removing the transfection mixture. The medium was changed on day 2, adding MEM + 10% FBS and fresh TNF. Cell lysates were prepared on day 3 by aspirating the medium, washing each well once with 1.5 ml of calcium/magnesium-free D-PBS, and adding 150 μl of 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm DTT. Lysates were frozen at −70 °C. After thawing, the lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × gfor 4 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase according to the instructions provided with the reagent kit for each enzyme. Nuclear extracts of MC3T3-E1 cells were prepared by sequential hypotonic cell lysis and high salt extraction of nuclei as described previously (33Farmer P.K. He X. Schmitz M.L. Rubin J. Nanes M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E213-E220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Extracts were stored at −70 °C in single use aliquots. Protein was measured using the Bio-Rad version of the Bradford dye-binding assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Double-stranded DNA probes were end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Binding of nuclear proteins to the labeled DNA probes was carried out using standard gel shift methods and detected using autoradiography (33Farmer P.K. He X. Schmitz M.L. Rubin J. Nanes M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E213-E220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts (5 μg protein/lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions using a 10% acrylamide gel and a discontinuous buffer system and proteins were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The Western blot was developed using the standard protocol for the ECL Plus immunodetection kit. The AML-3 (RUNX2) primary antibody (no cross-reactivity to AML-1 or AML-2) was diluted to 2.5 μg/ml in the ECL Plus blocking solution, and donkey anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase was diluted to 1:5000 in calcium/magnesium-free D-PBS + 0.1% Tween 20. The reactive protein bands were detected using the fluorescence-scanning feature of the Storm PhosphorImager. Analysis of variance was used to determine statistical differences between groups. Multiple comparisons between individual groups were assessed by the method of Tukey. Comparisons of multiple groups to a single control were done according to the method of Dunnet. For comparison of mRNA half-life curves, replicate values from control or TNF-treated groups were compared at single time points by Student's t test. Data were also analyzed after transformation of the exponential decay to the natural logarithmic value. The resulting linear equations were used for statistical evaluation by comparison of the 95% confidence intervals of the slopes. In legends, p = NS indicates not significant (p ≥ 0.05). Fetal rat calvaria cells derived from day 21 of gestation differentiate to osteoblasts over 14 days in culture with formation of discrete nodules, mineralization, and expression of the skeletal-specific osteocalcin gene (12Gilbert L.

Steady state mRNA levels of RUNX2 were determined by semiquantitative RT-PCR using primers flanking the highly conserved RUNT homology domain. Fig.1A shows that treatment of fetal rat calvaria cells with TNF (10 ng/ml), a dose shown previously to completely inhibit differentiation in these cells, caused a 50% decline in RUNX2 mRNA by 24 h. The inhibitory effect of TNF on RUNX2 mRNA was confirmed by Northern analysis of the sample as shown in Fig. 1B. To further define the molecular mechanism of TNF action on RUNX2 expression, we utilized the clonal preosteoblast cell line MC3T3-E1. This cell line expresses RUNX2 within 48 h of plating and becomes phenotypically osteoblastic after 14 days in culture. Fig.2A shows the dose-dependent inhibition of RUNX2 mRNA expression by TNF, as measured by RT-PCR. The IC50 for TNF inhibition of RUNX2 was 0.6 ng/ml. TNF inhibition of RUNX2 was associated with inhibition of mineralization of the cultures, as shown in Fig.2B and reported previously (12Gilbert L. He X. Farmer P. Boden S. Kozlowski M. Rubin J. Nanes M.S. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3956-3964Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). TNF suppressed RUNX2 in MC3T3-E1 cells 70% (range 50–80% in four experiments). Multiple protein isoforms of RUNX2 have been described because of the presence of different translation start sites and additional RNA splice donor/acceptor sites. As illustrated in Fig.3, there are two major RNA species that are transcribed from two promoters (P1 and P2), and encode two principal isoforms with different N termini (P1/MASNS and P2/MRIPV). Primers specific for the P1 and P2 related mRNAs were constructed to measure the effect of TNF on steady state levels of these two major RUNX2 mRNA isoforms. Fig. 3A shows a map of the two isoforms and the target sequences for primer amplification. Thetop panel shows the mRNA isoform beginning from the second transcriptional start site (P1/MRIPV), and thelower panel shows the mRNA isoform originating from the first transcriptional start site (P2/MASNS). Fig.3B shows RT-PCR results for four individual cultures treated with or without TNF (10 ng/ml). We observed that the P1/MASNS mRNA isoform was reduced 50% by TNF treatment. The P2/MRIPV mRNA isoform was reduced >90% (Fig. 3B). We observed two expected bands and one unexpected band using the P1/MASNS-specific primer pair 1/2. The P1/MASNS-related mRNAs indicated in Fig.3B (labeled b and c) are predicted based on alternative splicing of a micro-exon in the 5′-untranslated region of the P1/MASNS RUNX2 mRNA as reported previously (37Schinke T. Karsenty G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30182-30189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The larger 380-kb band represents an unspliced mRNA species in which intron 1 is retained, preserving the coding sequence in frame. Isolation, subcloning, and direct sequencing confirmed the nucleotide sequence of the bands. The observed bands were not the result of genomic contamination because they were absent when reverse transcriptase was excluded from the reaction mixture. In addition, DNase digestion of the samples failed to eliminate the bands (data not shown). The P2/MRIPV isoform primers yielded the predicted RT-PCR product (Fig. 3B, d). The P2/MRIPV mRNA was strongly inhibited by TNF. TNF had no effect on 18 S RNA. Thus, TNF inhibited expression of both the P1/MASNS and P2/MRIPV mRNA isoforms at an early time point in differentiation. The semiquantitative RT-PCR results suggested that TNF had a more pronounced effect on the P2/MRIPV mRNA isoform. To determine whether TNF inhibition of RUNX2 mRNA was associated with a reduction in RUNX2 protein, RUNX2 nuclear content was measured using both EMSA and Western analysis. In this way, we assessed functional RUNX2 binding to DNA and also total RUNX2 nuclear protein. MC3T3-E1 cells were treated with or without TNF (10 ng/ml) for 24 h. Nuclear extract was isolated, and EMSA was done using a32P-labeled rat osteocalcin OSE2 probe to assess nuclear protein/DNA binding (37Schinke T. Karsenty G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30182-30189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows that TNF decreased RUNX2 binding to the probe. RUNX2 binding was decreased after 24 h of TNF treatment but not by 4 h (4 h not shown). The RUNX2 band was supershifted with a specific RUNX2 (AML-3) antibody in control or TNF-treated cells. A control antibody to the closely related AML1 protein did not supershift the bands (data not shown). RUNX2 is a phosphoprotein regulated via the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Because binding of RUNX2 to DNA could be regulated by changes in RUNX2 phosphorylation state rather than quantity, Western analysis of nuclear extracts was done to directly measure RUNX2 nuclear content. Fig. 5 shows that TNF treatment (10 ng/ml) inhibited nuclear RUNX2 protein after 24 h of treatment, but not by 4 h, a finding consistent with results from the EMSA. We found that TNF caused a >90% inhibition of nuclear RUNX2 by Western analysis. TNF could inhibit expression of RUNX2 by affecting mRNA stability or through transcriptional suppression. To determine which of these mechanisms were occurring, the effect of TNF on RUNX2 mRNA stability was measured after treating cells with actinomycin D to inhibit new RNA synthesis. The decay of pre-formed RUNX2 mRNA was measured using RT-PCR in cells pre-treated with TNF for 2 h. Fig.6 shows that the RUNX2 mRNA has a short half-life calculated as 1.8–2.3 h (range of three experiments). Treatment with TNF caused a decrease in RUNX2 half-life to 0.9 h, which was apparent at 1 h after TNF treatment. To determine whether the inhibitory effect of TNF on RUNX2 steady state mRNA requires new protein synthesis, MC3T3-E1 cells were treated with cycloheximide for 2 h prior to addition of TNF (10 ng/ml, 24 h) and RUNX2 mRNA was measured by RT-PCR. The addition of cycloheximide reduced the steady state mRNA level of RUNX2; however, the concurrent treatment of TNF + cycloheximide still caused a 50% inhibition of RUNX2 mRNA compared with cycloheximide alone (Fig. 7). These results are consistent with a direct effect of TNF (or the TNF-stimulated signal transduction pathway) on the RUNX2 gene without the need for new protein synthesis. The effect of TNF on RUNX2 gene transcription was studied using a reporter that included 0.6 kb of the rat RUNX2 promoter (exon-1 start site) fused to the firefly luciferase gene (−600pCbfa-1LUC). Previous work has shown that this region of the promoter is sufficient to confer transcriptional activation (31Drissi H. Luc Q. Shakoori R. Chuva De Sousa Lopes S. Choi J.Y. Terry A. Hu M. Jones S. Neil J.C. Lian J.B. Stein J.L. Van Wijnen A.J. Stein G.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 184: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The effect of TNF treatment on the −600pCbfa-1LUC construct is shown in Fig.8. TNF treatment for 24 h caused a dose dependent inhibition of transcription with an estimated IC50 between 0.1 and 1 ng/ml, similar to the IC50 for TNF inhibition of steady state mRNA and osteoblast differentiation. The effect of 5′-deletions of the promoter on basal transcription is shown in Fig.9A and confirms the previously"

This hypothesis was tested on a sample of 17,000 trees in a Guianan forest, 10 years after a silvicultural experiment that added to natural treefall gaps a wide range of disturbance intensities. Species richness, standardized to eliminate density effects, peaked at intermediate disturbance levels, particularly when disturbance intensity was estimated through the percentage of stems of strongly light-dependent species."
https://openalex.org/W2001031230,"Killed or inactivated vaccines targeting intracellular bacterial and protozoal pathogens are notoriously ineffective at generating protective immunity. For example, vaccination with heat-killed Listeria monocytogenes (HKLM) is not protective, although infection with live L. monocytogenes induces long-lived, CD8 T cell-mediated immunity. We demonstrate that HKLM immunization primes memory CD8 T lymphocyte populations that, although substantial in size, are ineffective at providing protection from subsequent L. monocytogenes infection. In contrast to live infection, which elicits large numbers of effector CD8 T cells, HKLM immunization primes T lymphocytes that do not acquire effector functions. Our studies show that it is possible to dissociate T cell-dependent protective immunity from memory T cell expansion, and that generation of effector T cells may be necessary for long-term protective immunity."

On the other hand, GH secretagogues (GHSs) were discovered as a series of small peptide derivatives of pentapeptides Leu- and Met-enkephaline, which selectively stimulated GH secretion from pituitary cells. The prototype of this class of GHSs, GHRP-6, was found to be extremely potent and specific in mammals and particularly in humans (2Momany F.A. Bowers C.Y. Reynolds G.A. Hong A. Newlander K.

GHS-R mRNA is expressed not only in the pituitary and brain but also in other tissues such as pancreas (8Guan X.-M., Yu, H. Palyha O.C. Feighner S.D. Sirinathsinghji D.J.S. Smith R.G.

Furthermore, a very recent report showed that ghrelin caused hyperphagia and obesity (9Tschàp M. Smiley D.L. Heiman M.L. Nature. 2000; 407: 908-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (3392) Google Scholar).

The rat β-actin-coding region was obtained by RT-PCR and verified with DNA sequencing. Cells were lysed in 20 mmTris-HCL, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mg/ml aprotinin for 30 min on ice and cleared by centrifugation for 20 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation was performed by incubating the supernatant fraction with antibodies specific for IRS-1, IRβ, IRS-2, GRB2, or p85 PI3K overnight at 4 °C, followed by binding to protein A-agarose (Amersham Life Sciences). After a 2-h incubation at 4 °C, the incubation was centrifuged briefly at 10000 × g, and the agarose was washed with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmNa3VO4 and recentrifuged. This was repeated three times after which Laemmli medium was added, and the agarose was heated at 100 °C for 5 min.

The membranes were exposed briefly to x-ray film. In vitrophosphorylation of PtdIns was carried out in the immune complexes as described previously (11Myers M.G., Jr. Sun X.J. Cheatham B. Jachna B.R. Glasheen E.M. Backer J.M. White M.F. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1421-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Subconfluent HepG2 cells grown in 100-mm dishes were made quiescent by overnight incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.1% BSA. The quiescent cells were incubated with ghrelin for 20 min, insulin for 3 min, or ghrelin for 20 min and then insulin for 3 min, and washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and twice with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 137 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 100 μm Na3VO4 (buffer A). The cells were solubilized in 1 ml of buffer A containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and 0.35 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 ×g for 10 min. Supernatant was incubated with anti-IRS-1 antibody for 4 h at 4 °C, and immune complexes were precipitated from the supernatant with protein A-Sepharose and washed successively in PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 100 μm Na3VO4 (three times); 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 500 mm LiCl and 100 μm Na3VO4 (three times); and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 μmNa3VO4 (two times). The pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA and combined with 10 μl of 100 mm MnCl2 and 10 μl of 2 μg/μl PtdIns sonicated in 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm EGTA. The phosphorylation reaction was started by adding 10 μl of 440 μm ATP containing 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After 10 min at 22 °C, the reaction was stopped with 20 μl of 8 n HCl and 160 μl of CHCl3:methanol (1:1). The samples were centrifuged, and the lower organic phase was removed and applied to a silica gel TLC plate that had been coated with 1% potassium oxalate. TLC plates were developed in CHCl3:CH3OH:H2O:NH4OH (60:47:11.3:2), dried, and visualized by autoradiography. Total RNA was prepared from cultured H4-II-E cells using Trizol. Twenty μg of total RNA was heat-denatured for 5 min at 70 °C in buffer containing 50% formamide, 2.4m formaldehyde, 1× 0.02 MOPS, 50 mm sodium acetate, and 10 mm Na2 EDTA and then loaded onto a 1.2% agarose/formaldehyde gel made up in 1× MOPS, pH7.4, at 50 V for 3–4 h. After electrophoresis, RNA was transferred onto a Hybond N membrane by capillary action and fixed onto the filters by ultraviolet light cross-linking. The blot was probed with either a rat PEPCK or a rat β-actin probe labeled by a Gene Images random prime labeling module and detected by a Gene Images CDP-star detection module according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the membranes were exposed to x-ray film for 30–60 min. Cell proliferation assays were performed by CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Briefly, ∼48–72 h before the assay, HepG2 cells were seeded into 96-well plates at 1–3 × 105 cells/well. When cells reached 60–70% confluence, the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% BSA and then with 100 nm ghrelin, 100 nm insulin, both 100 nm ghrelin and 50 μm PD98059, or both 100 nm insulin and 50 μm PD98059. The cultures were incubated in a CO2 incubator for 48 h at 37 °C, and then 20 μl/well of CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Reagent, which contains a tetrazolium compound, methanethiosulfonate, was added to the culture medium. The methanethiosulfonate tetrazolium compound is bioreduced by cells into a colored formazan product that is soluble in tissue culture medium. This conversion is presumably accomplished by NADPH or NADH produced by dehydrogenase enzymes in metabolically active cells. After incubating the plate 2–4 h in a CO2 incubator, the absorbance at 490 nm was recorded with a 96-well plate reader. All samples were assayed in duplicate, and each experiment was repeated at least three times. The data were expressed as the mean ± S.E. unless noted otherwise. Statistics were analyzed by one-way repeated measures analysis of variance with a significance level of 0.05. To investigate the possible effects of ghrelin on insulin-regulated responses, we looked for cell lines expressing a GHS-R. Various cell lines derived from the liver, adipose tissue, and muscle were screened by RT-PCR with oligonucleotides that have been reported previously (12Skinner M.M. Nass R. Lopes B. Laws E.R. Thorner M.O. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 4314-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, HepG2 cells, provided one PCR product, for which identity with human GHS-R mRNA was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The same product was obtained by RT-PCR from a human pituitary cDNA library, a human liver cDNA library, and a rat hepatoma cell line, H4-II-E cells (Fig. 1 A), and its identity was confirmed by sequencing. We next investigated the effect of ghrelin on the profile of tyrosine-phosphorylated cellular proteins. HepG2 cells were treated with 100 nm ghrelin for 0–20 min, and cellular proteins were analyzed by immunoblot analysis with antibodies to phosphotyrosine (anti-Tyr(P)). Ghrelin treatment for 10–20 min caused a significant increase in the amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in HepG2 cells compared with those without ghrelin treatment (354 ± 42versus 100 ± 5% basal level at 10 min,p < 0.01; 364 ± 47 versus 106 ± 5% basal level at 20 min, p < 0.01) (Fig.1 B). When we cultured HepG2 cells for 20 min with varying concentrations of ghrelin, 10–100 nm ghrelin caused a significant and dose-dependent increase in the amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 as shown in Fig. 1 C. Furthermore, ghrelin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 was canceled by an antagonist for GHS-R, [d-Lys-3]GHRP-6 (Fig. 1 D). HepG2 cells were treated with 100 nm ghrelin for 20 min followed by stimulation with 100 nm insulin for 1 min, and cellular proteins were analyzed by immunoblot analysis with anti-Tyr(P). Ghrelin and insulin significantly increased tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 levels up to 172 ± 10 and 262 ± 15 densitometric units (DU), respectively, compared with vehicle alone (99 ± 9 DU). Combined stimulation with ghrelin and insulin resulted in an additive increase of tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 levels up to 442 ± 23 DU (p < 0.01,n = 5) (Fig.2 A). The tyrosine phosphorylation of IRβ chain was not stimulated by the presence of ghrelin (Fig. 2 B). Ghrelin also increased tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in H4-II-E cells (Fig. 2 D). To investigate whether the effect of ghrelin on tyrosine phosphorylation is specific for IRS-1, we tested the effect of ghrelin on tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2. HepG2 cells were treated with 100 nm ghrelin for 20 min followed by stimulation with 100 nm insulin for 1 min. Ghrelin did not increase tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 (Fig. 2 C). Downstream signaling of IRS-1 is mediated by several associated proteins including GRB2 and PI3K (13Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocrinol. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore tested the effect of ghrelin on the interaction of GRB2 or PI3K with IRS-1. When HepG2 cells were pretreated with 100 nm ghrelin for 20 min followed by stimulation with 100 nm insulin for 3 min, the amount of GRB2-associated IRS-1 (basal, 114 ± 10 DU) was increased either by ghrelin (256 ± 34 DU, p < 0.01) or by insulin (288 ± 33 DU, p < 0.01). Combined treatment with ghrelin and insulin resulted in an additive increase (418 ± 44 DU, p < 0.01,n = 5) (Fig.3 A). Similarly treated cells were analyzed to examine the association of PI3K with IRS-1. PI3K-associated IRS-1 in vehicle-treated cells (114 ± 10 DU) was increased either by ghrelin (220 ± 28 DU, p < 0.01) or by insulin (275 ± 32 DU, p < 0.01). However, no additive increase in PI3K associated with IRS-1 was found by a combined treatment with ghrelin and insulin (211 ± 24 DU, p < 0.01, n = 5) (Fig.3 B). Furthermore, because MAPKs and Akt are the downstream substrates for GRB2 and PI3K, respectively, we tested whether MAPKs and Akt are involved in cellular responses to ghrelin. Phosphorylated active MAPK was collected from cell lysates using anti-phospho-MAPK antibody, and its enzyme activity was determined by the amount of phosphorylated Elk-1 fusion protein. HepG2 cells were pretreated with 100 nm ghrelin for 20 min followed by stimulation with 100 nm insulin for 3 min and were then analyzed for MAPK activity. MAPK activity in vehicle-treated cells (75 ± 14 DU) was increased either by ghrelin (246 ± 24 DU, p < 0.01) or by insulin (389 ± 36 DU, p < 0.01). Combined treatment with ghrelin and insulin caused an additive increase (546 ± 58 DU, p < 0.01, n = 5) (Fig. 4 A). These response patterns of MAPK activity to either insulin, ghrelin, or the combination of both were compatible with those of GRB2-associated IRS-1 (Fig. 3 A). We also measured the Akt kinase activity determined by the amount of phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) fusion protein. Similarly treated cells were analyzed for Akt kinase activity. Akt kinase activity in vehicle-treated cells (154 ± 24 DU) was increased by insulin (524 ± 126 DU,p < 0.01) and, in contrast, decreased by ghrelin (29 ± 8 DU, p < 0.01) as well as by a combined treatment with ghrelin and insulin (82 ± 17 DU,p < 0.01, n = 5) (Fig.4 B). These findings were not correlated with the association of PI3K with IRS-1. We therefore measured the amount of PI3K activity in IRS-1 immunoprecipitates. IRS-1-associated PI3K activity in vehicle-treated cells (64 ± 10 DU) was increased either by ghrelin (200 ± 19 DU, p < 0.01) or by insulin (203 ± 24 DU, p < 0.01). However, no additive increase in IRS-1-associated PI3K activity was found by combined treatment with ghrelin and insulin (226 ± 7 DU, p< 0.01, n = 4) (Fig. 4 C). We also investigated whether ghrelin affects glucose homeostasis in cell culture. Hepatic and renal gluconeogenesis is crucially important in maintaining glucose homeostasis. The rate-limiting enzyme of gluconeogenesis is phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). This enzyme has no known allosteric control and is down-regulated by insulin at the transcriptional level. The rat hepatoma cell line, H4-II-E cells, has been used successfully to study the regulation of PEPCK expression, whereas HepG2 cells do not express PEPCK efficiently (14Granner D. Andreone T. Sasaki K. Beale E. Nature. 1983; 305: 549-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 15Xing L. Quinn P.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1484-1494PubMed Google Scholar, 16Cohen B. Novick D. Rubinstein M. Science. 1996; 274: 1185-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). The amount of PEPCK mRNA in H4-II-E cells treated first with 8-CPT-cAMP and then with insulin was reduced compared with cells treated with 8-CPT-cAMP alone. Surprisingly, incubation of the cells with ghrelin for 1 to 2 h before adding insulin partially reversed the down-regulating effect of insulin on PEPCK mRNA levels (Fig.5). Another main regulator of PEPCK gene expression is cAMP. Hence, we investigated the intracellular cAMP using the enzyme immunoassay for cAMP. Ghrelin did not increase the intracellular cAMP in H4-II-E cells (data not shown). Next we tested the effects of ghrelin on cell proliferation. On the basis of the analogous data between ghrelin and insulin with regard to the stimulation of MAPK activity in HepG2 cells, we hypothesized that ghrelin causes cell proliferation in HepG2 cells via MAPK pathway. Ghrelin stimulated proliferation of HepG2 cells, and a MAPK kinase-1-specific inhibitor, PD98059, completely blocked both ghrelin- and insulin-induced cell proliferation (Fig.6). We have demonstrated for the first time that ghrelin treatment causes stimulation of the IRS-1-GRB2-MAPK pathway as well as cell proliferation and that ghrelin inhibits Akt kinase activity as well as up-regulates PEPCK gene expression. The effect of ghrelin on IRS-1 phosphorylation is unlikely to be mediated via IR, because tyrosine phosphorylation of the IRβ chain was not stimulated by the presence of ghrelin. However, it would be exerted independently by an activation of a GHS-R signaling cascade. We found that ghrelin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 was blunted by an antagonist for GHS-R, [d-Lys-3]GHRP-6, and that other GHSs, GHRP-6 and GHRP-2, induced a significant increase in the amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in HepG2 cells (data not shown). Therefore, the downstream molecules of GHS-R signaling can cross-talk with the insulin-signaling pathway. Indeed, it has been reported that IRS-1 is phosphorylated by growth factors and cytokines, including insulin-like growth factor-I, interferon-α, interleukin-4, and interleukin-9 as well (11Myers M.G., Jr. Sun X.J.

It is unique, however, that GHS-R is the G protein-coupled receptor that cross-talks with the insulin-signaling pathway. Hence, it remains to be elucidated what molecules in the GHS-R signaling pathway affect the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (Fig. 7). IRS-1 is characterized to possess the 20–22 potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites that are conserved between IRS-1 homologs. The surrounding amino acid residues are also highly conserved, and several of these represent potential binding sites for proteins that contain Src homology 2 (SH2) domains (21Sun X.J. Rothenberg P.

Chuang L.M. Zhang Y. Yang-Feng T. White M.F. Kahn C.R. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 1041-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). IRS-1 interacts with many SH2 proteins with diverse phosphotyrosine motif requirements including PI3K and GRB2 (13Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocrinol. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Sun X.J. Rothenberg P. Kahn CR. Backer J.M. Araki E. Wilden P.A. Cahill D.A. Goldstein B.J. White M.F. Nature. 1991; 352: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar). In the present study, ghrelin increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, association of GRB2 with IRS-1, and MAPK activity, indicating up-regulation of the IRS-1-GRB2-MAPK pathway. Furthermore, ghrelin-stimulated proliferation of HepG2 cells and PD98059 completely blocked ghrelin-induced cell proliferation, indicating that MAPKs were essential in HepG2 cell proliferation caused by ghrelin. However, ghrelin suppressed Akt kinase activity, despite of the presence of insulin, as well as up-regulating the amount of PEPCK mRNA expression, although it increased not only the association of PI3K with IRS-1 but also IRS-1-associated PI3K activity. The phospholipid kinase PI3K is activated by virtually all receptor tyrosine kinases. Activated PI3K phosphorylates PtdIns(4)P and PtdIns(4,5)P2 to generate the membrane-embedded second messengers PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. These lipids play a crucial role in the activation of Akt. PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 mediated membrane translocation of a variety of signaling proteins, including the protein-serine/threonine kinases, 3′-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1), and Akt. Akt is phosphorylated by PDK-1 on Thr-308 in its activation loop. Phosphorylation of Thr-308 is a prerequisite for kinase activation, but phosphorylation of the C-terminal hydrophobic residue is required as well for full activation of Akt kinase. The Akt Ser-473 kinase (hypothetical PDK-2) remains to be identified (23Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar, 24Toker A. Newton A.C. J. Biol.

Cell. 2000; 103: 185-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the activity of effector proteins that are dependent on PI3K activation can be negatively regulated by PTEN (phosphate and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten) and SHIP (SH2-containing inositol 5′-phosphatase), two phosphoinositide-specific phosphatases that dephosphorylate the 3′ and 5′ positions of the inositol ring of phosphoinositides, respectively, leading to inhibition of cellular responses mediated by PI3K products (26Bolland S. Pearse R.N. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Immunity. 1998; 8: 509-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 27Maehama T. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13375-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2601) Google Scholar). In the present study, the dissociation of the downstream molecules in the IRS-1-PI3K-Akt pathway remains difficult to explain, but the presence of a potent inhibiting mechanism of Akt kinase activity by ghrelin, even under full activation by the PI3K-IRS-1 association, is likely. It is possible that these enzymes, such as PDK-1, PDK-2, SHIP, and PTEN, may be affected by GHS-R-mediated signaling molecules. Hence, it remains to be elucidated what molecules in the GHS-R signaling pathway affect the IRS-1-PI3K-Akt pathway (Fig. 7). The repression of the PEPCK gene by insulin has been studied in detail. There is conflicting evidence as to which signaling pathways may be involved in insulin repression of PEPCK gene expression, the activation of the PI3K pathway, or the activation of the MAPK pathway in which GRB2 engages IRS-1, IRS-2, Shc, or SHP2 (28Sutherland C.

Recently, however, accumulating evidence suggests that the signaling pathways in insulin repression of PEPCK gene expression may involve the activation of PI3K pathway but not the MAPK pathway (30Gabbay R.A.

Our findings that ghrelin inhibits Akt activity may be in agreement with the recent data that PI3K pathway is involved in the insulin-induced repression mechanism of PEPCK expression. Another main regulator of PEPCK gene expression is cAMP. However, ghrelin did not increase the intracellular cAMP in H4-II-E cells (data not shown). Therefore, the signaling pathway by which ghrelin stimulates PEPCK gene expression remains as yet unknown. We propose that ghrelin can affect gluconeogenesis, at least in the H4-II-E cells, by attenuating the effect of insulin on the expression of PEPCK. Considering the effect of ghrelin on glucose homeostasis, it is of note that GHSs are diabetogenic in rats (33Clark R.G. Thomas G.B. Mortensen D.L. Won W.B., Ma, Y.H. Tomilinson E.E. Fairhall K.M. Robinson I.C.A.F. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4316-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Physiological significance of ghrelin in vivo animals is to be clarified. In conclusion, we found two novel actions of ghrelin in addition to its GH-releasing action: one is insulin-like action stimulating the IRS-1-GRB2-MAPK pathway, which in turn activates cell proliferation; and the other is anti-insulin action suppressing Akt activity and up-regulation of gluconeogenesis. Although the mechanism by which ghrelin affects insulin signaling pathways remains not fully understood, our findings obtained in hepatoma cells strongly implicate the peripheral actions of ghrelin in glucose homeostasis and in mitogenic processes in humans.

However, the role of mitochondrial defects in the formation of Lewy bodies, a pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease has not been addressed directly. In this report, we investigated the effects of inhibitors of the mitochondrial electron-transport chain on the aggregation of α-synuclein, a major protein component of Lewy bodies. Treatment with rotenone, an inhibitor of complex I, resulted in an increase of detergent-resistant α-synuclein aggregates and a reduction in ATP level. Another inhibitor of the electron-transport chain, oligomycin, also showed temporal correlation between the formation of aggregates and ATP reduction. Microscopic analyses showed a progressive evolution of small aggregates of α-synuclein to a large perinuclear inclusion body. The inclusions were co-stained with ubiquitin, 20 S proteasome, γ-tubulin, and vimentin. The perinuclear inclusion bodies, but not the small cytoplasmic aggregates, were thioflavin S-positive, suggesting the amyloid-like conformation. Interestingly, the aggregates disappeared when the cells were replenished with inhibitor-free medium. Disappearance of aggregates coincided with the recovery of mitochondrial metabolism and was partially inhibited by proteasome inhibitors. These results suggest that the formation of α-synuclein inclusions could be initiated by an impaired mitochondrial function and be reversed by restoring normal mitochondrial metabolism.

Aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn) appears to be essential for the LB formation since fibrillar aggregates of α-syn are major components of LBs (4Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Hasegawa M.

Neurol. 1991; 30: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) in idiopathic PD. Another line of evidence for mitochondrial defects in PD came from studies where cybrids that contained mitochondria from PD patients showed reduced complex I activity (23Swerdlow R.H. Parks J.K.

In fact, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced parkinsonism is attributed to the inhibition of complex I by its metabolite, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), which leads to reduction in mitochondrial ATP production (25Nicklas W.J. Vyas I. Heikkila R.E. Life Sci. 1985; 36: 2503-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar, 26Singer T.P. Castagnoli N., Jr. Ramsay R.R. Trevor A.J. J. Neurochem. 1987; 49: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Moreover, in a recent study administration of rotenone, an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I, recapitulated the major pathological and behavioral features of PD, including selective loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and α-syn-positive LB-like inclusions, indicating that the inhibition of complex I in the electron-transport chain (ETC) might be sufficient to trigger PD pathogenesis in a rat model (27Betarbet R. Sherer T.B. MacKenzie G. Garcia-Osuna M. Panov A.V. Greenamyre J.T. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1301-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (2984) Google Scholar). Although mitochondrial defects are clearly associated with PD, a direct role of mitochondrial dysfunction in LB formation has not been addressed. Here we provide evidence that the functional state of mitochondria might be a key determinant for aggregation of α-syn. In addition, the aggregates appeared to be eliminated by restoring normal mitochondrial metabolism, suggesting the presence of cellular mechanisms that actively disassemble and degrade protein aggregates. Human wild type α-syn cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the primer sets, 5′-ATCAGATCTGCCATGGATGTATTCATGAAAGGA and 5′-ATCGTCGACGGATGGAACATCTGTCAGCA, and pRK172/α-syn (a gift from Peter T. Lansbury, Jr., Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) as a template. The cDNA was digested with BglII and inserted into theBamHI site of the transfer vector, pQBI-AdCMV5 (Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA). In vivo homologous recombination and subsequent amplification of the recombinant virus were carried out in 293A cells according to the manufacturers instructions (Qbiogene). Final stock of the amplified recombinant virus (adeno/α-syn), which was aliquoted and stored in −80 °C, had the titer of ∼2.0 × 108 pfu/ml. cDNAs for β- and γ-syns were amplified by PCR from a human brain cDNA pool (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) using primer sets, 5′-ACTGGATATCGCCAGGATGGACGTGTTCATG and 5′-ACTGTCTAGACGCCTCTGGCTCATACTCCTG for β-syn, and 5′-ACTGGATATCGCCACCATGGATGTCTTCAAGAAGG and 5′-ACTGTCTAGAGTCTCCCCCACTCTGGGCCTC for γ-syn. α-Syn cDNA was amplified by PCR from pRK172/α-syn using a primer set, 5′-ACTGGATATCGCCACCATGGATGTATTCATGAAAG and 5′-ACTGTCTAGAGGCTTCAGGTTCGTAGTCTTG. The PCR products were inserted to an EcoRV/XbaI-cut pCDNA3.1/Myc-His vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The sequences of the inserts in all the plasmids were confirmed by sequencing. Transformed African monkey kidney cell line COS-7 was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen, Rockville, MD) with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Inc., Logan, UT) in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. For the infection with adeno/α-syn, cells were split on 100-mm tissue culture dishes a day prior to infection to obtain about 90% confluency on the day of infection. For infection, 1 × 108 pfu of adeno/α-syn in 1 ml of medium was added to each dish. After 90 min incubation at 37 °C, 9 ml of fresh medium was added to the cells and incubated overnight. Cells were then split onto 60-mm dishes or coverslips in 12-well plates for further experiments. For the comparison of α-, β-, and γ-syn, cells were transfected with pCDNAα-synMH, pCDNAβ-synMH, or pCDNAγ-synMH using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to Lee et al.(28Lee H.-J. Chun M. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16597-16600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For the inhibition of ETC, cells were treated with rotenone (0.1 μm in Me2SO; Sigma) or oligomycin (0.1 μg/ml in Me2SO; Sigma) 2 days post-infection and harvested or fixed for immunostaining at the times indicated (0–3 days). For the wash-out experiments, the medium from the cells treated with rotenone or oligomycin was replaced with fresh inhibitor-free medium after 48 h or at the time indicated. Cells grown in 60-mm tissue culture dishes were harvested in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and quickly frozen in dry ice/methanol bath. After thawing on ice, cells were diluted 100-fold with the same buffer. ATP assay was performed following manufacturers instructions using luminescence-based ATP assay kit (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp., San Diego, CA). Data was normalized by protein contents. Similar results were obtained after the data was normalized by the number of cells. Mean and S.E. were calculated and graphed with GraphPad Prism version 3.02 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). One-way ANOVA with Dunnett's post-test was performed using GraphPad Instat version 3.05 (GraphPad Software). For the Western analysis, 5 μl of 10% Triton X-100 was added to 45 μl of cells to make a final 1% Triton X-100 and vortexed. The extraction was done for 15 min on ice and the cell extract was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant (Triton-soluble fraction) was saved and the pellet (Triton-insoluble fraction) was resuspended in 1 × sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.025% bromphenol blue) and sonicated. Both fractions were loaded onto 12% SDS-PAGE, and the Western blotting was performed as described elsewhere (29Lee S.-J. Liyanage U. Bickel P.E. Xia W. Lansbury P.T., Jr. Kosik K.S. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 730-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Antibodies used were LB509 (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) for α-syn and anti-Myc antibody (Invitrogen) for epitope-tagged proteins. The procedure for the staining is described elsewhere except for a few modifications (28Lee H.-J. Chun M. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16597-16600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). All the steps were done at room temperature unless stated otherwise. Briefly, cells on coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min and permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. Coverslips were blocked in blocking solution (PBS, 5% bovine serum albumin, 3% goat serum) for 30 min and incubated with LB509 alone or in combination with anti-ubiquitin antibody (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA) or anti-20 S proteasome α-subunit antibody (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp.) in blocking solution for another 30 min. For the co-staining with anti-γ-tubulin antibody (Sigma) or anti-vimentin antibody (Sigma), a polyclonal antiserum against α-syn, 7071 (a gift from Peter T. Lansbury, Jr.), was used. After extensive washing for 1–2 h in PBS, Cy3-conjugated goat secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) in blocking solution was added for 30 min. For thioflavin S staining, fixed cells were incubated with 0.05% thioflavin S (Sigma) for 8 min and washed three times with 80% ethanol for 5 min each before the antibody incubations (30Ostrerova-Golts N. Petrucelli L. Hardy J. Lee J.M. Farer M. Wolozin B. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6048-6054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) was carried out using the kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN) for 1 h at 37 °C and washed with PBS. The nuclei was stained with Hoechst 33258 (2 μg/ml; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) in PBS for 10 min and washed three times with PBS for 30 min before mounting with Prolong anti-fade reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Images were analyzed using the DeltaVision deconvolution microscope (Applied Precision, Inc., Issaquah, WA) in the Cell Science Imaging Facility at Stanford University. To investigate the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in α-syn aggregation, human wild type α-syn was expressed in COS-7 cells using a recombinant adenoviral vector system, which yielded homogeneous expression in nearly 100% of the cells. Cells were then treated with two ETC inhibitors, rotenone, a complex I (NADH-coenzyme Q reductase) inhibitor, and oligomycin, a complex V (F0F1-ATP synthase) inhibitor. At each time point, cell extracts were fractionated to the Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions and analyzed by Western blot analysis. After 48 h of incubation in the presence of rotenone, the cells produced visible amounts of SDS-resistant α-syn aggregates, and by 72 h, most of the α-syn was in aggregated form (Fig.1 A). Vehicle alone had almost no effect on α-syn aggregation during the time course we examined (Fig. 1 C). Rotenone did not influence the aggregation of α-syn in cell-free assays, suggesting that the effect of rotenone was not targeted directly to the protein itself (Fig. 1 D). Oligomycin, although affecting a different target in the ETC, induced the aggregation of α-syn with a similar time course, supporting the idea that the ETC inhibition leads to the aggregation of α-syn (Fig.1 B). There are other proteins, such as β-syn, γ-syn, and synoretin, that are closely related to α-syn (31Clayton D.F. George J.M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 249-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 32Surguchov A. Surgucheva I. Solessio E. Baehr W. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 13: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Despite the sequence homology within the synuclein family of proteins, only α-syn is found in LBs (33Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Goedert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 839-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (6267) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vitro studies showed that α-syn is much more prone to aggregate than other syns and does not cross-seed β- or γ-syn (34Biere A.L. Wood S.J. Wypych J. Steavenson S. Jiang Y. Anafi D. Jacobsen F.W. Jarosinski M.A., Wu, G.M. Louis J.C. Martin F. Narhi L.O. Citron M. J. Biol.

To compare the effects of ETC inhibition on α-, β-, and γ-syns, cells that transiently expressed Myc/His-tagged synucleins were treated with rotenone, and the aggregation was monitored in the Triton-insoluble fractions. The antibody against Myc-tag was used to quantify the amounts of monomer and aggregates of each protein. Consistent with the previous in vitro studies with purified recombinant proteins (34Biere A.L. Wood S.J. Wypych J. Steavenson S. Jiang Y. Anafi D. Jacobsen F.W. Jarosinski M.A., Wu, G.M. Louis J.C. Martin F. Narhi L.O. Citron M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 2380-2386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar), only α-syn produced aggregates at day 2 despite the fact that the expression level of β-syn was much higher than that of α-syn. This data suggests that α-syn has highest aggregation tendency in the syn family in response to altered mitochondrial metabolism (Fig.2). In PD and other related synucleinopathies, the aggregation of α-syn is often manifested by the presence of large cytoplasmic inclusion bodies called LBs (3Trojanowski J.Q. Goedert M. Iwatsubo T. Lee V.M. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 832-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). We, therefore, investigated the formation of inclusion bodies in rotenone-treated cells microscopically (Fig.3). Before rotenone treatment (t = 0 in Fig. 3 A), α-syn was diffusely distributed throughout the entire cytoplasm. Dispersed staining of small aggregates began to appear at 24 h and increased with time. A small fraction of the cells with α-syn aggregates started to develop large inclusions in the perinuclear region by 48 h and their population increased with time. At 48 and 72 h, about 10% of cells with aggregated α-syn had large perinuclear inclusions. Immunohistochemical studies showed that LBs contain not only α-syn, but also ubiquitin and subunits of proteasome (33Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Goedert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 839-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (6267) Google Scholar, 36Ii K. Ito H. Tanaka K. Hirano A. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 56: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). To determine the presence of these proteins in the inclusion, we co-stained the rotenone-treated cells with antibodies against α-syn and ubiquitin or the α-subunit of 20 S proteasome. Both anti-ubiquitin and anti-α-subunit antibodies co-stained with α-syn antibody in the perinuclear inclusions (Fig. 4,A and B). Thus, the perinuclear inclusions that were α-syn-positive contained ubiquitin and the proteasome subunit. In contrast, small aggregates that were dispersed in the cytoplasm contained neither ubiquitin nor the proteasome subunit (Fig. 4). We have not detected any small α-syn aggregates that were positive for either of these proteins. Ubiquitin was also detected in the SDS-resistant, high molecular weight protein complex by Western blotting (data not shown). However, whether α-syn was directly ubiquitinated is not clear because of several reasons. First, α-syn aggregates and ubiquitin-positive aggregates can be separate entities, which happen to run at a similar rate on the SDS gel. Co-immunostaining of the perinuclear inclusions often showed segregation of these proteins (Fig. 4 A). Second, α-syn may not be ubiquitinated directly, but simply co-aggregates with other ubiquitinated proteins. Analysis of monomeric proteins dissociated from aggregates will provide the direct answer to this problem. Recently, the formation of perinuclear inclusions called aggresomes were described as a general response of cells to an accumulation of misfolded proteins (37Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1786) Google Scholar). These aggresomes contain γ-tubulin, since they form near the microtubule organizing center, and are often surrounded by vimentin filaments (37Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1786) Google Scholar). The α-syn-positive inclusions in rotenone-treated cells also contain γ-tubulin and are surrounded by vimentin (Fig. 4, C and D). However, the cells with inclusions did not show a significant rearrangement of vimentin filaments (Fig. 4 D), as was the case for typical aggresome-containing cells (37Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1786) Google Scholar). α-Syn aggregates in LBs are known to have a structure similar to amyloids, which are characterized by an ordered array of crossed β-sheet structure (6Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T., Jr. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2552-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 7Serpell L.C. Berriman J. Jakes R. Goedert M. Crowther R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4897-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). This structure can be selectively recognized by thiazole dyes, such as thioflavin T and S, good indicators of amyloid-like conformation (38Puchtler H. Waldrop F.S. Meloan S.N. Appl. Pathol. 1985; 3: 5-17PubMed Google Scholar, 39Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). To obtain conformational information, we double-stained rotenone-treated cells with an anti-α-syn antibody and thioflavin S. As described above, two forms of aggregates can be detected after rotenone treatment, small cytoplasmic aggregates and large perinuclear inclusions. The perinuclear inclusions in rotenone-treated cells were strongly stained with thioflavin S, while the small aggregates were thioflavin S-negative (Fig. 5). To evaluate the functional defects of mitochondria in the cells exposed to the ETC inhibitors, we measured ATP levels as a marker of mitochondrial metabolism after rotenone or oligomycin treatment. When the cells were treated with rotenone, the reduction in ATP preceded and paralleled the aggregation of α-syn up to 72 h, with reductions of 23, 87, and 94% at 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively (Fig.6 A). Oligomycin treatment resulted in a similar time course of ATP reduction, which again paralleled the aggregation of α-syn (Fig. 6 B). These data suggest that functional defects in the ETC may cause the aggregation of α-syn. To test whether mitochondria can recover after removal of the ETC inhibitors, the cells were cultured with rotenone or oligomycin for 48 h, then the medium was replaced with the inhibitor-free medium (Fig. 7 A). ATP levels were slowly restored in the wash-out phase. At 48 h of wash-out, the rotenone-treated cells had almost fully recovered from the ATP deficit while the oligomycin-treated cells had recovered by 50%, suggesting a functional recovery of mitochondria (Fig. 6, C andD).Figure 7Disappearance of α-syn aggregates in wash-out phase. COS-7 cells overexpressing α-syn were treated with rotenone (B) or oligomycin (C) for 48 h and then medium was replaced with fresh inhibitor-free medium as indicated in A. B and C, cells were harvested at time 0, 48, 72, and 96 h. The same cell suspension was used for ATP measurement (see Fig. 6, C and D) and Western analysis.D, the wash-out experiment described in A was repeated while varying rotenone treatment (indicated as Rot. Treat), leading to more α-syn aggregates. The time course of the wash-out phase is the same as A. E, α-Syn immunostaining during the wash-out (WO) phase. COS-7 cells were treated with rotenone (0.1 μm) for 72 h (top image), and then cultured in a rotenone-free medium for 24 h (middle image) or 48 h (bottom image), before they were fixed and stained with the LB509 antibody. Red and blue colors represent α-syn and nucleus, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether the aggregation of α-syn can be reversed by the removal of the ETC inhibitors, the extent of SDS-resistant α-syn aggregates were investigated in the wash-out experiment (Fig.7 A). During this period, the α-syn aggregates gradually diminished, and by 48 h of wash-out, most of the aggregates had disappeared (Fig. 7, B and C). Disappearance of the aggregates paralleled the recovery of mitochondrial metabolism, which was monitored by the cellular ATP level. Even after longer aggregation period, which produced more α-syn aggregates, replacement with rotenone-free medium resulted in a progressive removal of the aggregates (Fig. 7 D). This phenomenon could be due to the death of the cells with α-syn aggregates. However, TUNEL staining showed that the number of dying cells was minimal (4–8% of total cells), with no correlation between α-syn aggregation and apoptotic cell death during the entire time course of the experiment (data not shown). An independent assessment of cell death by nuclear morphology produced similar results (data not shown). Therefore, the disappearance of the α-syn aggregates is not due to the selective loss of the cells with the aggregates. Rather, there may be an active mechanism for the removal of the pre-existing aggregates in the cells. Disappearance of aggregates during the wash-out phase was also analyzed microscopically (Fig. 7 E). Consistent with the Western analysis, replacement with rotenone-free medium resulted in a disappearance of small dispersed aggregates. However, the number of cells with the large perinuclear inclusions (about 8% of total cells) remained throughout the wash-out phase up to 2 days, suggesting that these large inclusions are more resistant to the aggregate-cleanup mechanism than the small aggregates. Disappearance of the aggregates in the wash-out phase was not accompanied by a concomitant increase of monomeric α-syn. This suggests an elimination of aggregates by degradation rather than by simple disassembly. To investigate the role of the proteasome syst"

Simulations were performed in two different collisional regimes representative of asteroid families such as Eunomia and Koronis. Our results indicate that all large family members must be made of gravitationally reaccumulated fragments; that the post-collision member size distribution and the orbital dispersion are steeper and smaller, respectively, than for the evolved families observed today; and that satellites form frequently around family members."

Mitogens and cytokines stimulate the phosphorylation of eIF4E at Ser209, but the functional consequences of this modification have remained a major unresolved question. Using fluorescence spectroscopy and surface plasmon resonance techniques, we show that phosphorylation of eIF4E markedly reduces its affinity for capped RNA, primarily due to an increased rate of dissociation.

The implications of our findings for the mechanism of translation initiation are discussed. eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4E-binding protein surface plasmon resonance In eukaryotic cells, all nucleus-encoded mRNAs possess a so-called “cap structure” at their 5′-end. This cap consists of a methylated 5′-5′ bound guanosine triphosphate (m7GTP) moiety. The cap plays a key role in the translation of the mRNA by permitting recruitment of the eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs)1 required for the attachment of the ribosome and correct initiation of translation. The protein that interacts directly with the cap is eIF4E, which forms a complex with the scaffolding protein eIF4G, which in turn recruits other factors. These include eIF4A and eIF4B, which are involved in unwinding secondary structure in the 5′-untranslated region of the mRNA, and the poly(A)-binding protein, which by interacting with the 3′-tail of the mRNA circularizes it (1Gingras A.-C.

These enzymes (Mnk1 and Mnk2) also associate with eIF4G in vivo (11Waskiewicz A.J. Johnson J.C. Penn B. Mahalingam M. Kimball S.R. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1871-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 12Scheper G.C. Morrice N.A. Kleijn M. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Despite these advances and the large number of studies on the changes of eIF4E phosphorylation in vivo, the key issue of the effect of phosphorylation on the function of eIF4E has received little attention and has remained a major question in the field. The crystal structure of mammalian eIF4E in its nonphosphorylated form (15Marcotrigiano J. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Burley S.K. Cell. 1997; 89: 951-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar) suggests that Ser209 lies close to a cleft in the protein through which the mRNA may “exit” and opposite to a lysyl residue (Lys159). This led to speculation that, by introducing a negatively charged group, phosphorylation of Ser209 might allow a salt bridge to form with Lys159, thus leading to “cleft closure” and allowing tighter binding of eIF4E to capped mRNAs. However, the effects of phosphorylation on eIF4E function using quantitatively phosphorylated eIF4E have not previously been measured. Here we exploit the availability of highly active preparations of an authentic eIF4E kinase, Mnk2, to produce stoichiometrically phosphorylated eIF4E. We find, counter to a previous report (16Minich W.B. Balasta M.L. Goss D.J. Rhoads R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7668-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), that phosphorylation of eIF4E diminishes its ability to bind cap analogue or capped mRNA, and we propose a new model for the role of eIF4E phosphorylation during translation initiation. pEBG-Mnk2 and pEBG-Mnk1T2A2 (both kindly provided by Dr. A. Waskiewicz, University of Washington, Seattle, WA) were transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells. The expressed glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins for wild type Mnk2 (as a source of active eIF4E kinase) and Mnk1-T2A2 (dead kinase) were purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads. The washing procedure for the beads included two wash steps with 0.5 m lithium chloride to prevent co-purification of mitogen-activated protein kinase. Vectors encoding the S209A, S209D, and S209E variants of eIF4E (a gift from Dr. M. Underhill, University of Kent, UK) were created by PCR with the desired mutation in the downstream primer. eIF4E K159M, K159R, and R157K were generated using the QuikChange® system from Stratagene. Wild type eIF4E and the variants were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described earlier (17Stern B.D. Wilson M. Jagus R. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Recombinant His-tagged 4E-BP1 was a kind gift from Manjur Karim (University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, Manchester, UK). Isoelectric focusing was performed as described (18Kleijn M. Voorma H.O. Thomas A.A.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 59: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The concentrations of the recombinant proteins were determined using the protein assay reagent from Bio-Rad. Recombinant eIF4E was phosphorylated in vitroin reactions containing glutathione S-transferase-Mnk2, 20 mm Hepes·KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 μm ATP, 0.1 mm EDTA, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm sodium vanadate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol at 30 °C overnight. Glutathione S-transferase-Mnk2 was used, since this kinase has a high basal activity in unstimulated cells (12Scheper G.C. Morrice N.A. Kleijn M. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 743-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). As a control for possible loss of eIF4E to walls of tubes or loss of activity, incubations were also performed in parallel using the inactive T2A2 variant of Mnk1 (10Waskiewicz A.J. Flynn A. Proud C.G. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). After the reactions, the kinases were removed by spinning down the glutathione-Sepharose and followed by careful removal of the supernatant. The kinases were undetectable in the final eIF4E batches by Western blotting with antibodies against the glutathione S-transferase moiety. In a similar fashion, we did not detect eIF4G, which could have co-purified with the glutathioneS-transferase-Mnks, in the preparations of mock-phosphorylated and phosphorylated eIF4E. Recombinant wild type eIF4E, either untreated, mock-phosphorylated, or phosphorylated, or variant forms of eIF4E in a volume of 30 μl were incubated with 15 μl of m7GTP-Sepharose (1:1 slurry (Amersham Biosciences)) and 15 μl of Sepharose CL-4B (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C while shaking at 1000 rpm in an Eppendorf thermomixer. After this incubation, the beads were spun down at 13,000 × g for 20 s, and the supernatant was carefully transferred to a new tube and diluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The Sepharose beads were washed three times with 500 μl of buffer containing 20 mm Hepes·KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm sodium vanadate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The beads were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Unbound and bound eIF4E were analyzed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and Coomassie staining. All SPR experiments were performed using a BIAcore 3000. An NTA Sensor Chip (BIAcore) was used for immobilizing His6-tagged 4E-BP1. Injection of the His6-tagged 4E-BP1 (300 nm in eluent buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm KCl, 50 μm EDTA, and 0.01% P20 (a nonionic surfactant (Biacore)) resulted in a response of ∼200 resonance units for the immobilized protein. eIF4E was then injected in the same buffer. The chip was regenerated after each cycle with 350 mm EDTA in the eluent buffer. All measurements were performed at a flow rate of 30 μl/min at 25 °C. The response of the nickel-coated chips without the immobilized protein was subtracted from the response obtained with the protein-coated chips. The resulting curves were evaluated using the BIA Evaluation software package. Biotinylated capped and uncapped RNAs were prepared by in vitro transcription in the presence or absence of m7GpppG, respectively, with the same template as described previously (19Ptushkina M. von der Haar T. Karim M.M. Hughes J.M. McCarthy J.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4068-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), which was kindly provided by Dr. Tobias von der Haar (University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, Manchester, UK). The RNAs contain only one uridine (in the 3′-end), allowing synthesis of singly 3′-biotinylated transcripts. The RNAs were diluted in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.05% P20 and denatured for 5 min at 95 °C, immediately cooled on ice, and subsequently immobilized on Sensor Chip SA (streptavidin) chips (Biacore) at a flow rate of 5 μl/min for 6 min. The binding of (phosphorylated) eIF4E was performed in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml calf liver tRNA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 0.05% P20. All further injections were carried out at 25 μl/min for 2 min. Where required, regeneration was performed with 30 μl of binding buffer containing 2 m KCl and 0.1 mm m7GTP. The response from the RNA-coated channels was constant, indicating that the RNAs were not degraded over the course of the experiments. The RNA-coated chips could even be reused the next day. The resulting curves were evaluated using the BIA Evaluation software package and globally fitted (1:1 Langmuir binding). χ2 values for the fits were on the order of 0.4–1.2. Analysis of data obtained at different flow rates (5 or 75 μl/min) resulted in very similar Kd values, indicating that the results were not affected by mass transfer limitations. All fluorescence titrations were performed using a Spex Fluorolog τ2 spectrofluorimeter. The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the protein was measured by exciting at either 280 or 295 nm, and the emission wavelength was 345 nm. Polarizing filters oriented at the magic angle were used to reduce scatter. All fluorescence intensities were corrected when necessary for the inner filter effect as described previously (20Bi X. Ren J. Goss D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5758-5765Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The dissociation equilibrium constants were obtained by fitting the titration data as previously described (20Bi X. Ren J. Goss D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5758-5765Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Nonlinear least-squares fitting of the data was performed using KaleidaGraph software (Version 2.1.3; Abelbeck Software). Human eIF4E was expressed in E. coli, isolated, refolded, and purified on m7GTP-Sepharose (17Stern B.D. Wilson M. Jagus R. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To prepare phosphorylated eIF4E (termed “eIF4E(+P)”), the purified recombinant protein was incubated with Mnk2 (made in 293 cells) and ATP/MgCl2. This resulted in phosphorylation of the eIF4E to almost 100% as revealed by isoelectric focusing analysis (Fig.1A). Mnk2 phosphorylates eIF4E exclusively at Ser209 (12Scheper G.C. Morrice N.A. Kleijn M. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 743-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). As a control for any effect of adding the kinase preparation itself, eIF4E was incubated with a catalytically inactive Mnk1 (“T2A2”) (11Waskiewicz A.J. Johnson J.C. Penn B. Mahalingam M. Kimball S.R. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1871-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). eIF4E treated in this way remained completely unphosphorylated (Fig. 1A). Throughout this study, the term “eIF4E(−P)” indicates this “mock-phosphorylated” material as distinct from untreated factor (designated “eIF4E”). Analysis of the binding of these eIF4E preparations to m7GTP-Sepharose showed that Mnk2 treatment did not prevent eIF4E from binding to immobilized cap analogue (Fig.1B). Some concern has been raised whether the cap analogue, used during purification of recombinant eIF4E, is fully removed upon dialysis (21von der Haar T. Ball P.D. McCarthy J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30551-30555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Therefore, the binding of the various recombinant proteins to cap analogue or capped RNA could be affected by differing amounts of bound m7GTP remaining from the purification procedure. To exclude this possibility, wild type and variant eIF4Es were again expressed inE. coli and purified as described. However, in this case they were eluted from m7GTP-Sepharose with 10 mm GTP (instead of 100 μm m7GTP) for which eIF4E has much lower affinity. It is therefore thought to be removed more efficiently by dialysis. The various forms of eIF4E prepared in this way, including the Mnk2-phosphorylated protein, showed similar binding characteristics for m7GTP-Sepharose as shown to those in Fig. 1B for the m7GTP-eluted protein and yielded almost identical Kd values for capped RNA binding to that by SPR analysis as reported in Fig. 3 (data not shown). Fig. 1B shows that unphosphorylated and mock-phosphorylated, as well as several variants of eIF4E that will be used in the experiments described below, are properly folded, as judged by their ability to bind to m7GTP-Sepharose. However, this approach cannot be used to perform accurate quantitative studies on the affinity of eIF4E for the cap. We examined possible differences between different forms of eIF4E in their binding to cap analog (m7GTP) by fluorescence intensity measurements. Similar fluorescence titrations have been used previously to study the interaction between eIF4E and a variety of cap analogues (see, for example, Refs. 22Carberry S.E. Friedland D.E. Rhoads R.E. Goss D.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1427-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar and 23Sha M. Wang Y. Xiang T. van Heerden A. Browning K.S. Goss D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29904-29909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and this approach was also employed by Minich et al. (16Minich W.B. Balasta M.L. Goss D.J. Rhoads R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7668-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) in their study on the effects of eIF4E phosphorylation. When untreated eIF4E was compared with in vitrophosphorylated eIF4E, the phosphorylated factor showed a 2.5-fold lower binding affinity for m7GTP (Kd = 610 nm) than the native eIF4E (Kd = 260 nm). The results of titrations of each protein are shown in Fig. 2. These titrations were performed at a protein concentration of 500 nm for each protein to permit direct comparison of the two curves. Titration experiments with the mock-treated eIF4E gave a similar Kd value (300 nm) to that obtained for the untreated recombinant protein. A widely used approach for addressing the effects of phosphorylation of specific sites in proteins is to create nonphosphorylatable variants or to introduce an acidic residue at the site. We therefore mutated the cDNA to encode either an uncharged residue at position 209 (S209A) or an acidic residue (S209D or S209E). These variants of eIF4E were expressed in E. coli. As expected, the acidic variants showed a more acidic pI on IEF analysis than wild type eIF4E or the S209A variant protein (Fig. 1A). Fluorescence measurements with these three variant proteins and m7GTP were performed in a similar way as that described for unphosphorylated and phosphorylated eIF4E in the legend to Fig. 2. The derivedKd values from these titrations are summarized in Table I. Apparently, in this assay, the acidic side chains of the S209D and S209E variant proteins do not affect the binding to m7GTP, and these variants do not mimic phosphorylated eIF4E.Table IBinding constants for eIF4E/m7 GTP interactionKdnmeIF4E260 ± 20eIF4E (−P)300 ± 60eIF4E (+P)610 ± 40eIF4E S209A340 ± 50eIF4E S209D240 ± 30eIF4E S209E320 ± 40Data obtained by fluorescence titration were analyzed as described in Fig. 2 and under “Experimental Procedures.” Curves were obtained from two experiments with each three concentrations (500, 450, and 400 nm for phosphorylated and at 500, 300, and 200 nm for nonphosphorylated proteins). All of these curves were fit to obtain the Kd values. Open table in a new tab Data obtained by fluorescence titration were analyzed as described in Fig. 2 and under “Experimental Procedures.” Curves were obtained from two experiments with each three concentrations (500, 450, and 400 nm for phosphorylated and at 500, 300, and 200 nm for nonphosphorylated proteins). All of these curves were fit to obtain the Kd values. To confirm and extend our finding that phosphorylated eIF4E has a reduced affinity for the cap, we employed SPR. In particular, we considered it important to mimic the physiological ligand, capped mRNA. To this end, a synthetic mRNA containing a 5′-cap was synthesized. This RNA possessed a biotinylated nucleotide at its 3′-end and was immobilized onto a streptavidin chip. A noncapped version of the RNA was immobilized onto a second channel as a negative control. A similar approach to study the interaction between eIF4E and the cap structure has been used before (24Ptushkina M. von der Haar T. Vasilescu S. Frank R. Birkenhager R. McCarthy J.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4798-4808Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). eIF4E in its unphosphorylated or phosphorylated states (Fig.3A) was applied to the chip surface, and the resonance signals were monitored. eIF4E(−P) clearly bound to the capped mRNA, and, when the flow was changed to buffer lacking eIF4E, the bound eIF4E dissociated with a half-time of ∼15 s, showing that it readily dissociates (Fig. 3A). Analysis of data from three separate experiments (each employing four or six different eIF4E concentrations) revealed an apparent binding constant for eIF4E(−P) of 1.2 × 10−7m. The binding constant for untreated recombinant eIF4E (Fig. 3B) was very similar to the one for eIF4E(−P), demonstrating that the “mock phosphorylation” does not affect the binding of eIF4E to capped RNA. When eIF4E(+P) was used, very little net binding to capped RNA was observed (Fig. 3A). The steady state level of binding was about 20% of that seen with a similar amount of eIF4E(−P). The small signal and very fast association and dissociation rates for eIF4E(+P) made it difficult to obtain a reliable (apparent) binding constant, although comparison of several sets of experiments shows that the binding affinity of eIF4E(+P) for capped RNA is 5–10-fold lower than that of eIF4E(−P). This decreased affinity reflects a substantial increase in the dissociation rate (see also Table II). Also, the on-rate is very quick, even quicker than for eIF4E(−P) and untreated recombinant eIF4E. The opposite would have been anticipated if phosphorylation causes a so-called “cleft closure,” as speculated by others (15Marcotrigiano J. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Burley S.K. Cell. 1997; 89: 951-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). In the presence of 4E-BP1, phosphorylated eIF4E does bind to capped RNA (see below), which also argues against cleft closure as an explanation of the effects we have measured for phosphorylation of eIF4E on cap binding.Table IIDissociation values for eIF4E/capped RNA interactionkdkd with BP1s−14E−P0.060 ± 0.01 (n = 8)8.12 × 10−44E+P0.58 ± 0.15 (n = 8)3.96 × 10−34E WT0.078 ± 0.01 (n = 8)6.99 × 10−44E S209A0.067 ± 0.02 (n = 6)6.84 × 10−44E S209D0.44 ± 0.02 (n = 6)3.01 × 10−34E S209E0.42 ± 0.03 (n = 6)3.17 × 10−3Data obtained by SPR as shown in Figs. 3 and 4 were analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The S.D. values indicated for the dissociation constant in the absence of 4E-BP1 were obtained by fitting individual curves (as shown in Fig. 3) separately. Dissociation rates of eIF4E in the presence of 4E-BP1 were derived from SPR curves after injection of a mixture of 80 nm eIF4E with varying concentrations of 4E-BP1 (30–400 nm) followed by dissociation in buffer. Open table in a new tab Data obtained by SPR as shown in Figs. 3 and 4 were analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The S.D. values indicated for the dissociation constant in the absence of 4E-BP1 were obtained by fitting individual curves (as shown in Fig. 3) separately. Dissociation rates of eIF4E in the presence of 4E-BP1 were derived from SPR curves after injection of a mixture of 80 nm eIF4E with varying concentrations of 4E-BP1 (30–400 nm) followed by dissociation in buffer. eIF4E(S209A) bound to capped mRNA with similar affinity to eIF4E(−P) or untreated eIF4E (Fig. 3B). The side chain hydroxyl group of Ser209 therefore does not itself appear to be important for the interaction between eIF4E and capped mRNA. Treatment of S209A with active Mnk2 did not affect its binding to capped RNA (data not shown). This implies that the observed effects upon incubation of recombinant wild type eIF4E with active kinase are indeed due to phosphorylation and are not caused by an unknown effect of the kinase treatment. The acidic variants S209D and S209E each showed some ability to bind capped RNA (Fig. 3B), but the level of binding was reduced relative to the wild-type protein. Particularly striking were the faster off-rates for these variants as compared with the normal protein. The Kd values for the acidic variants are about 3–4 × 10−7m, indicating a 3-fold reduction in binding affinity relative to wild-type eIF4E. Thus, changing Ser209 to Asp or Glu does appear partially to mimic phosphorylation in the case of this interaction, but the effects of the acidic residues are smaller than those of phosphorylation itself. The data strongly indicate that phosphorylation of eIF4E weakens its binding to capped mRNA. These data are initially surprising given the predictions from the crystal structure concerning a salt bridge between Ser(P)209 and Lys159, which was expected to increase cap binding. In contrast, it appears that introduction of negative charge in the region of the proposed mRNA exit site impairs the affinity of eIF4E for capped mRNA. To study the role of Lys159 itself in capped mRNA binding, we mutated it to an uncharged but sterically similar residue (Met). Although this variant retained the ability to bind m7GTP-Sepharose (Fig. 1B), indicating that it was properly folded, the binding of eIF4E(K159M) to capped RNA was even weaker than that of eIF4E(+P) (Fig. 3C). This suggests that Lys159 plays an important role in the stable interaction of eIF4E with capped RNA, perhaps through the interaction of its positively charged side chain with negatively charged phosphate groups on the RNA. To test this idea, the lysine at position 159 was replaced by an arginine, and the resulting recombinant protein was tested for binding to capped RNA (Fig. 3C). This variant bound to the capped RNA with the same affinity as wild type eIF4E, strengthening the idea that a positive charge at this position is indeed essential. Alignment of 30 eIF4E sequences from 20 different species revealed that in eIF4E sequences from wheat, rice, and maize an arginine is indeed present at this position (data not shown). Among these 30 eIF4E proteins, an arginine at position at 157 was completely conserved. To test whether a positive residue at this position was sufficient for eIF4E function, this arginine was mutated to lysine, and the resulting recombinant protein was again tested. Binding to m7GTP-Sepharose seemed to be somewhat affected by this arginine to lysine substitution (see Fig. 1B), whereas binding of capped RNA was severely compromised (Fig. 3C, R157K). Apparently, an arginine at this position is of critical importance for the ability of eIF4E to bind capped RNA. To assess the effect of phosphorylation of eIF4E on its other binding properties, we employed SPR to analyze the interaction between eIF4E and its binding partner, 4E-BP1. Histidine-tagged 4E-BP1 was immobilized on the NTA chip, and eIF4E was passed over it. A lane lacking immobilized 4E-BP1 served as negative control; signals from this lane were subtracted from those from the first lane to obtain net binding. Comparison of eIF4E(+P) and eIF4E(−P) samples showed no difference in the kinetics of binding or dissociation of the eIF4E (Fig. 4). For both eIF4E preparations, a binding constant of 1.1 × 10−8m was determined using the Biacore evaluation software to fit the three curves (global fit, 1:1 Langmuir binding). These values are in very good agreement with those reported by Ptushkina et al. (19Ptushkina M. von der Haar T. Karim M.M. Hughes J.M. McCarthy J.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4068-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) (1.0 ± 0.4 × 10−8). Thus, phosphorylation of eIF4E does not appear to influence its ability to interact with 4E-BP1. Since the same region of eIF4E is involved in its interactions with 4E-BP1 and eIF4G (1Gingras A.-C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar, 19Ptushkina M. von der Haar T. Karim M.M. Hughes J.M. McCarthy J.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4068-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), it is highly likely that phosphorylation of eIF4E also does not affect binding to eIF4G, although we have been unable to test this directly. Since eIF4E interacts with other proteins in vivo (eIF4G, 4E-BPs), it was important to examine whether they modified the effect of phosphorylation on the binding of eIF4E to capped RNA. Association of eIF4E with 4E-BP1 or eIF4G has been shown to stabilize its interaction with capped mRNA (19Ptushkina M. von der Haar"
https://openalex.org/W2071695311,"We recently demonstrated that ceramide-coated balloon catheters limit vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) growth after stretch injury in vivo. In that study, inhibition of VSMC growth was correlated with a decrease in phosphorylation of the cell survival kinase Akt (protein kinase B). Utilizing cultured A7r5 VSMCs, we have now examined the mechanism by which ceramide inhibits Akt phosphorylation/activation. Our initial studies showed that ceramide-induced inhibition of Akt phosphorylation was not mediated through diminution in phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity. As we have previously demonstrated that protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ) is a target of ceramide, we proposed an alternative signaling mechanism by which ceramide induces inhibition of Akt through activation of PKCζ. We demonstrate that C6-ceramide (but not the inactive analog dihydro-C6-ceramide) induced PKCζ activity and also caused a selective increase in the association between Akt and PKCζ, without affecting PKCε, in A7r5 cells. In addition, the ability of ceramide to significantly decrease platelet-derived growth factor-induced Akt phosphorylation or cell proliferation was abrogated in A7r5 cells overexpressing a dominant-negative mutant of PKCζ. Taken together, these data suggest that ceramide-mediated activation of PKCζ leads to diminished Akt activation and consequent growth arrest in VSMCs. The therapeutic potential for ceramide to limit dysregulated VSMC growth has direct applicability to vascular diseases such as restenosis and atherosclerosis.

Activation of Akt at the membrane is a highly regulated event involving several lipid-regulated pleckstrin homology domain-containing kinases as well as PI3K-generated phosphoinositide-3-phosphate derivatives (13Duan C.

Fully activated, phosphorylated Akt is able to translocate to the nucleus, where it regulates the protein synthesis of numerous pro-mitogenic and pro-survival transcription factors (40Meier R.

Scheid M.P. Duronio V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13330-13335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 10Salinas M. Lopez-Valdaliso R. Martin D. Alvarez A. Cuadrado A. Mol.

Commun. 2001; 280: 1107-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism leading to inhibition of Akt has not been conclusively demonstrated. As ceramide does not directly inhibit Akt (7Zhou H. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Pittman R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16568-16575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), multiple indirect mechanisms for ceramide regulation of Akt have been proposed. An obvious potential mediator for ceramide-induced inhibition of Akt is PI3K. Conflicting results have suggested PI3K-dependent (6Zundel W. Giaccia A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1941-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) as well as PI3K-independent (17Meier R. Thelen M.

Biol. 1999; 19: 4684-4694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) regulation of Akt by ceramide. There are also several reports demonstrating activation of Akt, independent of PI3K (46Konishi H. Matsuzaki H. Tanaka M. Ono Y. Tokunaga C. Kuroda S. Kikkawa U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7639-7643Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 47Sable C.L. Filippa N. Hemmings B. Van Obberghen E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Our studies argue for a PI3K-independent mechanism for ceramide-induced Akt inhibition in VSMCs.PKCζ has been implicated as a putative mediator of PI3K-independent Akt inactivation (19Doornbos R.P. Theelen M. van der Hoeven P.C. van Blitterswijk W.J. Verkleij A.J. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8589-8596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that PKCζ is a negative regulator of PDGF-induced increases in Akt activity (19Doornbos R.P. Theelen M. van der Hoeven P.C. van Blitterswijk W.J. Verkleij A.J. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8589-8596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The ability of PKCζ to negatively regulate Akt may imply that an interaction between PKCζ and Akt abrogates the phosphorylation of Akt, yet the precise inhibitory/regulatory sites for PKCζ-dependent phosphorylation of Akt currently remain undefined. In addition, the endogenous regulator for PKCζ-dependent inhibition of Akt has not been determined. These studies suggest that ceramide may function as one such endogenous mediator, regulating PKCζ-dependent inhibition of Akt phosphorylation in VSMCs. Our studies further support the biological significance of PKCζ as one of the potential targets for ceramide.The role of ceramide in binding to and activating PKCζ is still somewhat controversial. It has been hypothesized that ceramide directly interacts with the single cysteine-rich domain of PKCζ (26Coroneos E. Wang Y. Panuska J.R. Templeton D.J. Kester M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 48Hurley J.H. Newton A.C. Parker P.J. Blumberg P.M. Nishizuka Y. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Our previous studies using both immunoprecipitated PKCζ and human recombinant PKCζ clearly demonstrate that ceramide (but not dihydroceramide) directly induces PKCζ bioactivity (4Bourbon N.A. Yun J. Kester M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35617-35623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Supporting our findings, ceramide has been shown to bind to PKCζ as determined by kinetic analyses and in vitro phosphorylation studies (24Muller G. Ayoub M. Storz P. Rennecke J. Fabbro D. Pfizenmaier K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1961-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 27Bieberich E. Kawaguchi T. Yu R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 177-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In contrast, a radioiodinated photoaffinity-labeled ceramide analog was unable to directly interact with immunoprecipitated PKCζ (49Huwiler A. Fabbro D. Pfeilschifter J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14556-14562Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These apparent contradictions in the literature may be due to structural differences in the ceramide analogs utilized. Even if ceramide does not directly interact with PKCζ, our studies still document that ceramide treatment leads to a selective interaction between Akt and PKCζ and that activated PKCζ is necessary for ceramide-induced inhibition of Akt.In addition to the controversy surrounding ceramide-stimulated PKCζ, there is disagreement regarding the signaling function of PKCζ. There are several reports in the literature that suggest that PKCζ mediates mitogenic signaling pathways (50Balendran A. Biondi R.M. Cheung P.C. Casamayor A. Deak M. Alessi D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20806-20813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 51Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J.

These studies discuss PKCζ as a downstream signaling target for PI3K and phosphoinositide 3,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent kinase-1. Other reports suggest that PKCζ may exert growth-arresting effects by directly inhibiting Akt (19Doornbos R.P. Theelen M. van der Hoeven P.C. van Blitterswijk W.J. Verkleij A.J. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8589-8596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 20Konishi H. Kuroda S. Kikkawa U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1770-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Our present studies, using dominant-negative mutant PKCζ constructs, firmly suggest that ceramide activation of PKCζ in VSMCs leads to growth arrest. It is also possible that PKCζ may serve as a bifunctional modulator, as suggested by Muller et al. (24Muller G. Ayoub M. Storz P. Rennecke J. Fabbro D. Pfizenmaier K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1961-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that ceramide and phosphoinositide-3-phosphate derivatives may differentially activate and couple PKCζ to both pro- and anti-mitogenic effectors. This is a similar scenario to previously published data demonstrating that ceramide preferentially couples activated PKCζ to upstream elements in the anti-mitogenic stress-activated protein kinase cascade, and not the pro-mitogenic extracellular signal-regulated kinase cascade (4Bourbon N.A. Yun J. Kester M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35617-35623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar).PKCζ may not be the only target for ceramide that inhibits Akt. Phosphoinositide 3,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent kinase-1, an upstream kinase for both Akt (41Meier R. Hemmings B.A. J. Recept. Signal Trans.

Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), could also be regulated by ceramide. However, our studies demonstrating that ceramide inhibition of Akt is PI3K-independent suggest that phosphoinositide 3,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent kinase-1 may not be a target for ceramide regulation. In fact, a recent report demonstrates that ceramide does not affect phosphoinositide 3,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent kinase-1 activity (10Salinas M. Lopez-Valdaliso R. Martin D. Alvarez A. Cuadrado A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 156-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar).In addition to activation of PKCζ, ceramide has been suggested to activate protein phosphatases that may dephosphorylate Akt, thereby preventing translocation into the nucleus (10Salinas M. Lopez-Valdaliso R. Martin D. Alvarez A. Cuadrado A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 156-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 17Meier R. Thelen M.

Biol. 1999; 19: 4684-4694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Even though we did not directly assess the putative role of ceramide-activated protein phosphatases in mediating PKCζ-dependent inhibition of Akt, studies demonstrate that ceramide activates PKCζ under conditions in which ceramide activates protein phosphatases (10Salinas M. Lopez-Valdaliso R. Martin D. Alvarez A. Cuadrado A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 156-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 56Wolff R.A. Dobrowsky R.T. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22689-22699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Yet, the literature regarding the role of ceramide-activated protein phosphatases in regulating Akt inhibition is somewhat controversial. Ceramide has been shown to dephosphorylate Akt-1 at Ser473 and Thr308, suggesting a role for a ceramide-activated protein phosphatase (9Schubert K.M. Scheid M.P. Duronio V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13330-13335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 10Salinas M. Lopez-Valdaliso R. Martin D. Alvarez A. Cuadrado A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 156-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). However, studies by Zhou et al. (7Zhou H. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Pittman R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16568-16575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) and Summers et al. (8Summers S.A. Garza L.A. Zhou H. Birnbaum M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5457-5464Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) suggest that ceramide-induced inactivation of Akt is independent of protein phosphatases. These discrepancies in the literature may be a consequence of nonspecific or toxic actions of the pharmacological inhibitors of protein phosphatase-1 and -2A utilized in these studies. Using a molecular approach, it has been suggested that ceramide inhibition of Akt occurs via a protein phosphatase-independent mechanism (19Doornbos R.P. Theelen M. van der Hoeven P.C. van Blitterswijk W.J. Verkleij A.J. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8589-8596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Specifically, PKCζ was able to inhibit the activity of a constitutively active Akt-1 mutant that is not regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation at Ser473 and Thr308.The mechanism(s) by which growth factors inhibit ceramide-induced increases in the interactions of PKCζ with Akt remains to be verified. Establishing ceramide as a mediator of PKCζ/Akt interactions offers several possible explanations for this observation. Growth factor-generated diglycerides may compete with ceramide at the putative ceramide-binding site on PKCζ (58van Blitterswijk W.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 679-680PubMed Google Scholar) or activate other PKC isoforms linked to mitogenesis. Alternatively, growth factor treatment induces the activation of ceramidase, which forms pro-mitogenic sphingosine species (28Coroneos E. Martinez M. McKenna S. Kester M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23305-23309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 59Spiegel S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The ability of growth factors to inhibit ceramide-induced PKCζ/Akt interactions probably does not involve activation of PKCζ because we (this study) and others (19Doornbos R.P. Theelen M. van der Hoeven P.C. van Blitterswijk W.J. Verkleij A.J. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8589-8596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar,60van Dijk M. Muriana F.J. van der Hoeven P.C. de Widt J. Schaap D. Moolenaar W.H. van Blitterswijk W.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) have shown that growth factors induce a marginal increase in PKCζ activity. Regardless of the mechanism, growth factor treatment reduces the actions of inflammatory cytokines or ceramides in inducing PKCζ/Akt interactions.We have shown that ceramide-induced inhibitions of Akt activation and cell growth are mediated by PKCζ activation, independent of PI3K. The role of ceramide in selectively inducing PKCζ·Akt complex formation may illustrate one mechanism by which cytokine receptor-induced ceramide formation may limit cell proliferation in a pro-inflammatory environment. Inhibition of Akt by cell-permeable ceramide analogs may have direct applicability to the control of dysregulated VSMC proliferation in vivo. Ceramide is a sphingolipid-derived second messenger that has been implicated in growth arrest, differentiation, and/or apoptosis (1Sawai H. Hannun Y.A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 102: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 2Spiegel S. Merrill Jr., A.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1388-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 3Charles R.

Using human embryonic kidney cells, we have recently demonstrated that ceramide-induced growth arrest is associated with changes in protein kinase signaling cascades, including protein kinase C (PKC)1 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (4Bourbon N.A.

However, the precise mechanism by which ceramide inhibits Akt activation has not been elucidated. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that Akt is a downstream target of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) in different cell types, including vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) (11Franke T.F. Yang S.I.

Whether ceramide inhibits Akt activation through a PI3K-dependent mechanism is still a subject of controversy in the literature. Recent studies have shown that ceramide-induced inhibition of Akt occurs in a PI3K-dependent (6Zundel W. Giaccia A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1941-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and PI3K-independent (17Meier R. Thelen M.

These data establish a role for DDR2 in critical events during wound repair. extracellular matrix matrix metalloproteinase discoidin domain receptor Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium green fluorescent protein Cutaneous wound healing is a dynamic interactive response involving re-epithelialization and formation of granulation tissue (1Singer A.J. Clark R.A.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 738-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (4740) Google Scholar). Both of these processes require tightly controlled remodeling of the wound matrix, in turn reflecting the net outcome of synthesis and degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM)1 components. In the healing wound, this matrix is composed of both fibrillar (i.e. types I and III) and non-fibrillar (i.e.types IV and VI) collagens. Whereas fibrillar collagens comprise the bulk of parenchymal scar tissue, non-fibrillar collagens within basement membranes play critical roles in epithelial cell polarity and function (2Boudreau N. Bissell M.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 640-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 3Lelievre S.A. Weaver V.M. Nickerson J.A. Larabell C.A. Bhaumik A. Petersen O.W. Bissell M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14711-14716Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Degradation of basement membrane by type IV collagenases (matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9) may be critical for scar formation and loss of epithelial cell mass. In granulation tissue, fibroblast-derived matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2; gelatinase A) is the predominant protease responsible for wound remodeling (4Okada A. Tomassetto C. Lutz Y. Bellocq J.P. Rio M.C. Basset P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Although basement membrane-degrading proteases derived from epithelial cells and macrophages (e.g. MMP-9) are important during inflammation and early re-epithelialization, stromal fibroblasts are responsible for the synthesis, deposition, and remodeling of the ECM that are necessary to support cell ingrowth and serve as a scaffold for cell migration (5McClain S.A. Simon M. Jones E. Nandi A. Gailit J.O. Tonnesen M.G. Newman D. Clark R.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 1257-1270PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the orientation and migration of epithelial cells require the correct distribution and type of surrounding stromal molecules, including type I collagen, fibronectin, and vitronectin (6Gailit J. Clark R.A.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). There is an interrelationship in fibroblasts between the biological effects of the ECM and its degradation. For example, interstitial matrices typical of healing wounds, which are rich in type I and III collagens, preserve fibroblasts in a synthetic phenotype, whereas matrices containing basement membrane components slow cell growth and matrix production (7Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2822) Google Scholar) and receptor expression (8Xu J. Clark R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Thus, degradation of the basement membrane matrix by fibroblast-derived MMP-2 is likely to drive the cells to a more synthetic phenotype, thereby creating a microenvironment favoring continued interstitial collagen production. Because of the profound effects of collagen interactions on fibroblast function, considerable effort has been invested in clarifying mechanisms of cell-matrix interactions. Until recently, cell interactions with collagen had been ascribed largely to integrins, a well characterized family of heterodimeric ECM receptors (see Ref. 9Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9026) Google Scholarfor review). Moreover, there is a distinctive integrin expression profile among different cell types in the cutaneous wound (10Cavani A. Zambruno G. Marconi A. Manca V. Marchetti M. Giannetti A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 600-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the collagen receptor α2β1integrin by wound-edge keratinocytes directs their proliferation and migration (11Larjava H. Salo T. Haapasalmi K. Kramer R.H. Heino J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1425-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 12Martin P. Science. 1997; 276: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (3791) Google Scholar), whereas fibroblast integrins for collagen participate in wound contraction (13Grinnell F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). Additionally, endothelial cell α2β1 integrin regulates the formation of capillary tubes in collagen gels (14Gamble J.R. Matthias L.J. Meyer G. Kaur P. Russ G. Faull R. Berndt M.C. Vadas M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The identification of the discoidin domain receptor (DDR) family as collagen receptors represents a new insight into the regulation of collagen-cell interactions in wound healing (15Schelessinger J. Cell. 1997; 91: 869-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 16Shrivastava A. Radziejewski C. Campbell E. Kovac L. McGlynn M. Ryan T.E. Davis S. Goldfarb M. Glass D.J.

Cell. 1997; 1: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). DDRs (DDR1 and DDR2) are typified by an intracellular tyrosine kinase region similar to those of other receptor tyrosine kinases, but their extracellular portions contain a lectin-like “discoidin” domain similar to that of Dictyostelium discoidin. The discoidin domain is present in other extracellular proteins such as neuropilin (18He Z. Tessier-Lavigne M. Cell. 1997; 90: 739-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar) and blood coagulation factors V and VIII (19Wood W.I. Capon D.J. Simonsen C.C. Eaton D.L. Gitschier J. Keyt B. Seeburg P.H. Smith D.H. Nature. 1984; 393: 330-337Crossref Scopus (522) Google Scholar) and is implicated in cell adhesion and migration (20Springer W.R. Cooper D.N.W. Barondes S.H. Cell. 1984; 39: 557-564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The triple helical structure of collagen is essential for DDR activation (16Shrivastava A. Radziejewski C. Campbell E. Kovac L. McGlynn M. Ryan T.E. Davis S. Goldfarb M. Glass D.J. Lemke G. Yancopoulos G.D. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 25-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). In addition to their specificity for collagens rather than peptide ligands, DDRs display a relatively slow onset of phosphorylation compared with the other receptor tyrosine kinases (17Vogel W. Gish G.D. Alves F. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). The principal differences between DDR1 and DDR2 are their tissue specificity and relative affinities for collagens. Both DDRs are widely expressed in human and mouse tissues, but their distribution is mutually exclusive. DDR1 is expressed primarily in epithelial tissues and has been implicated in the growth of some epithelial neoplasms, including breast cancer (21Johnson J.D. Edman J.C. Rutter W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5677-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In contrast, DDR2 is found in mesenchymal cells (22Alves F. Vogel W. Mossie K. Millauer B. Hofler H. Ullrich A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 609-618PubMed Google Scholar). DDR2 is also present in stromal cells surrounding highly invasive DDR1-positive tumor cells (23Barker K.T. Martindale J.E. Mitchell P.J. Kamalati T. Page M.J. Phippard D.J. Dale T.C. Gusterson B.A. Crompton M.R. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 569-575PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas DDR1 is activated by type I, IV, and V collagens, DDR2 is activated by type I collagen and to a lesser extent by type II, III, and V collagens. To date, the biological outcomes of DDR activation have not been well characterized. DDR1 signaling is also essential for granule cell axon extension in the developing cerebellum (24Bhatt R.S. Tomoda T. Fang Y. Hatten M.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2216-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Prolonged activation of DDR2 has been associated with increased MMP-1 activity in the human fibrosarcoma cell line HT-1080 (17Vogel W. Gish G.D. Alves F. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Although collagen is known to play an important role in the control of cell proliferation and migration during wound healing, the mechanism is not understood. Here, we explore the role of DDR2 signaling in fibroblast function. The DDR2−/− mice have been described previously (50Labrador J.P. Azcoitia V. Olaso E. Tuckerman J. Lin C. Mañes S. Buckner K. Georgen J.L. Lemke G. Yancopoulos G. Angel P. Martinez C. Klein R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 446-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Skin fibroblasts from −/−, +/−, or wild-type littermate mice were isolated from ear lobules by dissecting 1-mm2 tissue pieces in cold phosphate-buffered saline and transferring to six-well plate dishes containing 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) plus 10% fetal calf serum. Non-adherent cells were removed after 5 days. Cells from passages 2 to 4 were immortalized by transfection with 10 μg of the SV40 large T antigen cDNA (pRSVTantigen) in 30 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)/100-mm dish. In some experiments, skin fibroblasts were exposed to soluble type I collagen (20 μg/ml; Becton Dickinson), 1 mmcis-4-hydroxy-l-proline (Sigma), or the synthetic hydroxamate inhibitor GM6001 (Chemicon International, Inc.). Total RNA was extracted with RNeasy (QIAGEN Inc.). Ten micrograms of total RNA were subjected to electrophoresis on a formaldehyde-containing 1% agarose gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schüll), and hybridized overnight at 42 °C with 32P-labeled cDNA probes for either rat collagen α1(I) (25Greenwel P. Rubin J. Schwartz M. Hertzberg E.L. Rojkind M. Lab. Invest. 1993; 69: 210-216PubMed Google Scholar) or MMP-2 (26Iredale J.P. Benyon R.C. Pickering J. McCullen M. Northrop M. Pawley S. Hovell C. Arthur M.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 538-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). Blots were washed three times at 65 °C with 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS, exposed to a phosphor storage screen, and scanned in a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Results were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Skin fibroblasts were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate acid, and 0.1% SDS) (27Wong L. Yamasaki G. Johnson R.J. Friedman S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1563-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) containing protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 10 mm sodium fluoride. The conditioned medium was harvested and briefly centrifuged. Immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting for DDR2 was performed using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (R2-JM) raised against the juxtacrine domain of mouse DDR2 (amino acids 429–557). Cell lysate (100–250 μg) was incubated with polyclonal anti-DDR2 antibody R2-JM for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) were added for 1 h at 4 °C and then precipitated by centrifugation and washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. The protein A-Sepharose-bound proteins were extracted by a 10-min incubation in Laemmli buffer at 80 °C, and up to 100-μg protein aliquots were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). DDR2 was detected using anti-DDR2 antibody R2-JM (1:1000) and protein A-horseradish peroxidase (1:20,000; Sigma). Phosphorylated DDR2 was detected using monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (1:20,000; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and anti-mouse IgG (1:20,000). The bands were visualized using a SuperSignal Femto Substrate kit (Pierce). To detect collagen production, equal amounts of protein were resolved by 6% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated with a polyclonal antibody against the carboxyl terminus of mature human collagen α1(I) (catalog no. 8784, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000). The bands were visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). To stably overexpress DDR2 in DDR2−/− skin fibroblasts, subconfluent DDR2−/− skin fibroblast cultures were infected with a retrovirus containing a bicistronic construct expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) and one of the following: DDR2, the mouse wild-type DDR2 sequence; FcR2, a chimeric protein in which the DDR2 ectodomain is replaced with the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin (this Fc-DDR2 chimera produces spontaneous aggregation of the DDR2 cytoplasmic domain, leading to activation of tyrosine kinase activity); FcKER2, a mutant FcR2 cDNA containing a K608E point mutation to produce a kinase-defective protein; or a kinase-dead DDR2 (kdDDR2) expressing the full-length receptor with a T664A mutation within the kinase domain, generated by site-directed mutagenesis. The retroviral plasmid was derived from the plasmid LZRSpBMN-LacZ in which the LacZ coding sequences were replaced with multiple cloning sites immediately downstream of the packaging signal; 3′ to this region was a cassette encoding GFP under the control of an internal ribosomal entry site. Retroviral vector plasmids were transfected into the Phoenix-A line (Cell Media Technologies) by the calcium phosphate method. Puromycin-containing medium (1 μg/ml) was used to select for cells containing the retroviral vector plasmid. Viruses were harvested by filtering medium through a low protein-binding 0.45-mm filter and then aliquoted. For infections, 2 × 106 cells/10-cm dish were plated 24 h before infection. Each plate was infected with 10 ml of a 1:10 dilution of the virus stock. Cells with high levels of GFP expression were recovered by fluorescence-activated cell sorting for GFP fluorescence (MoFlo, Cytomation). Following cell sorting, cells were grown in monolayer culture overnight and then frozen and used within the 48 h after thawing. Only cells following one to two passages after thawing were used for all experiments, during which time DDR2 expression remained stable as assessed by flow cytometry analysis of GFP expression and immunoblotting of DDR2. Cells infected with a retroviral vector expressing only the internal ribosomal entry site GFP cDNA were used as controls. Skin fibroblasts were maintained 48 h in DMEM plus 10% fetal calf serum and labeled for the last 6 h with [3H]thymidine (10 μCi/ml). Parallel cultures of cells were trypsinized and counted in a hemocytometer. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline to remove non-incorporated isotope and fixed in 100% methanol. The [3H]thymidine incorporated into acid-insoluble material was extracted with NaOH and measured in a liquid scintillation β-counter. Cell proliferation was also measured using the nontoxic Alamar Blue assay (BIOSOURCE) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 10 μl of alamarBlue were added to 96-well plates containing 5 × 103 cells/100 μl of DMEM plus 10% fetal calf serum. Absorbance at 595 and 575 nm was measured every 4 h using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences HTS700-Plus plate reader. Results are expressed as a percentage of reduced alamarBlue. Skin fibroblast cultures were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and maintained for 24 h in serum-free medium. The medium was then harvested, briefly centrifuged, and immediately frozen at −20 °C to prevent autoactivation of MMP-2. Aliquots (25–75 μg) from identical numbers of cells were later analyzed by gelatin zymography on 8% polyacrylamide gels as previously described (28Olaso E. Santisteban A. Bidaurrazaga J. Gressner A.M. Rosenbaum J. Vidal-Vanaclocha F. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 634-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Results were quantified by scanning densitometry analysis using ImageQuant software. A series of deletion constructs were used to assay for MMP-2 promoter activity by transient transfection. Constructs extending 1686, 1007, 383, or 267 bp upstream of the translation start site of the rat MMP-2 gene were subcloned into the promoterless luciferase expression vector pGL2-basic (Promega) (29Harendza S.

Additionally, a construct containing the 40-bp MMP-2-responsive enhancer element-1 (referred to as RE-1), located between bp −1322 and −1282, was subcloned into the pGL2-promoter plasmid (Promega). In all transfections, the pRL-null vector expressing the Renilla luciferase enzyme cDNA (Promega) was included to control for transfection efficiency using dual-luciferase detection. Transient transfections of subconfluent cell cultures were performed with 3 μl of FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Skin fibroblasts were transfected with 1 μg of MMP-2 promoter construct cDNA (see above) and 15 ng of RenillacDNA. 293T cells were cotransfected with 0.5 μg of plasmid pMT21 with the DDR2 cDNA constructs (wild-type, kdDDR2, FcR2, or FcKER2), 0.5 μg of plasmid pGL2-basic encoding the 1686-bp MMP-2 promoter, and 15 ng of Renilla cDNA. DDR2+/− skin fibroblasts were transfected with 0.5 μg of plasmid pGL2-basic and 15 ng of Renilla cDNA. Cells were harvested after 24–40 h. Luciferase activity was assessed using the dual-luciferase assay kit (Promega). Final values were corrected for efficiency of transfection as assessed by Renilla activity. Cell migration assays were performed as described previously (32Albini A. Iwamoto H. Martin G. Aronson S. Kozlowsky J. McEwan R. Cancer Res. 1986; 47: 3239-3245Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Skin fibroblasts were incubated for 15 min with calcein (2 μm final concentration; Molecular Probes, Inc.); suspended in DMEM plus 1% fetal calf serum; and placed on top of light opaque FluoroBlock inserts (Falcon), previously coated with 100 μg/cm2 Matrigel (Becton Dickinson) or gelatin (Sigma). In some experiments, cells were placed directly on top of uncoated inserts. DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum in the lower compartment was used as chemoattractant. In some experiments, the MMP inhibitor GM6001 was added. Fluorescence emitted by cells that had migrated below the insert was measured every 4–8 h at λex = 485 nm and λem = 525 nm using the HTS700-Plus plate reader. Data are expressed as relative values with respect to the fluorescence emitted after the first 4 h (i.e. prior to migration of cells to the lower side of the coated membrane) or 2 h (when uncoated filters were used). Skin fibroblasts were grown on coverslips, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were incubated with a 1:50 dilution of monoclonal antibodies against α-smooth muscle actin (Dako) or vinculin (Sigma), followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies. Equal numbers of DDR2−/−or DDR2+/− skin fibroblasts were plated on type I collagen-coated dishes for up to 90 min. Dishes were washed to remove non-adherent cells and fixed in ethanol. After overnight staining with 0.1% crystal violet, cells were lysed in 0.2% Triton X-100, and the absorbance was measured at 550 nm. Five micrograms of total RNA were used for reverse transcription-PCR (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mouse ColA and ColB primers, kindly donated by M. Balbin (University of Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain), have been described previously (52Balbin M. Fueyo A. Knauper V. Lopez J.M. Alvarez J. Sanchez L.M. Quesada V. Bordallo J. Murphy G. Lopez-Otin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10253-10262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The fragments were amplified by PCR with 35 cycles of denaturation (95 °C, 1.5 min), annealing (60 °C, 1.5 min), and extension (72 °C, 1.5 min) The cycle number was optimized for each set of primers to ensure that the amplification was in the linear range and that the results were semiquantitative. PCR products were visualized on a 2% agarose gel with ethidium bromide. Results are expressed as the means ± S.E. Comparisons among groups were done with Student's t test, and statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Each experiment was performed in duplicate or triplicate and repeated at least two times with independent samples derived from at least two clones of each skin fibroblast cell line. Transient transfections were performed using at least two independent plasmid cDNA preparations. A previous study demonstrated that fibrillar type I collagen induces DDR2 phosphorylation in 293T cells (17Vogel W. Gish G.D. Alves F. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). To determine whether a similar response is elicited by DDR2 in skin fibroblasts, soluble type I collagen was added to DDR2+/− fibroblast for up to 16 h (Fig. 1). DDR2 was immunoprecipitated from skin fibroblast lysates using polyclonal antibody R2-JM, and phosphorylated DDR2 was detected by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10. Maximal DDR2 phosphorylation was reached after 4 h (Fig. 1A) and remained maximal for up to 16 h (data not shown). Identical results were obtained with DDR2+/+ cells (data not shown). As expected, no DDR2 phosphoprotein was detected in the DDR2−/− cell lysates. In contrast, when DDR2 was reconstituted in DDR2−/−fibroblasts by retroviral infection with wild-type DDR2, receptor phosphorylation was restored (Fig. 1B). No DDR2 was detected in DDR2−/− cells infected with only the empty vector expressing GFP. Because skin fibroblasts are the main cellular source of type I collagen in skin, we compared type I collagen mRNAs from DDR2+/− and DDR2−/− skin fibroblasts maintained in culture for 48 h (Fig.2). By Northern analysis, collagen α1(I) mRNA expression was reduced by 60% in DDR2−/− fibroblasts compared with DDR2+/−cells. Reconstitution of DDR2 function by retroviral infection with wild-type DDR2 restored collagen α1(I) synthesis (110% as compared with DDR2+/− cells) (Fig. 2A). This correlated with similar changes in collagen protein as determined by immunoblotting of cell lysates using a polyclonal antibody against type I collagen (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, DDR2−/−cells retrovirally infected with constitutively active FcR2 expressed more type I collagen than DDR2−/− cells. In principle, fibroblasts should provide ample autocrine ligand to DDR2 in the absence of added collagen. We therefore examined whether endogenous collagen is sufficient for DDR2 activation by inhibiting collagen synthesis to determine its effect on DDR2 phosphorylation. To do so, DDR2+/− and DDR2−/− skin fibroblasts and DDR2−/− skin fibroblasts retrovirally infected with wild-type DDR2 were cultured for 48 h in the presence of the proline analog cis-4-hydroxy-l-proline using a concentration that significantly inhibits the synthesis of collagen without affecting cellular viability or protein synthesis (33Rocnik E.F. Chan B.M.C. Pickering J.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1889-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Inhibition of collagen synthesis in the presence of the inhibitor was confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 2B). Retroviral infection of DDR2−/− cells with the control retroviral vector expressing GFP did not modify their collagen α1(I) synthesis (data not shown). Immunoprecipitation of cell lysates from DDR2+/− cells and DDR2−/− cells retrovirally infected with wild-type DDR2 with anti-DDR2 antibody R2-JM was followed by immunoblotting with either R2-JM or anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10. As shown in Fig. 2C, the inhibition of collagen synthesis correlated with decreased levels of phosphorylated DDR2. To test the role of DDR2 in cell proliferation, we compared the growth of skin fibroblasts isolated from DDR2−/− mice with that of cells from the same isolate in which DDR2 expression was reconstituted by retroviral infection with wild-type DDR2. Skin fibroblasts were cultured for 48 h on type I collagen-coated dishes and labeled for the last 6 h with [3H]thymidine. DNA synthesis was significantly lower in DDR2−/− fibroblasts compared with DDR2+/− cells (Fig.3A). Reduced proliferation of DDR2−/− fibroblasts compared with DDR2+/−cells was also observed when cultured on plastic under conditions in which DDR2+/− cells have phosphorylated DDR2 due to endogenous collagen (Fig. 2). Reconstitution of DDR2 function by retroviral infection with wild-type DDR2 restored cell proliferation (Fig. 3B). Retroviral infection of DDR2−/−cells with the control retroviral vector did not modify their proliferation rate (data not shown). In the human fibrosarcoma cell line HT-1080, activation of DDR2 by type I collagen leads to up-regulation of MMP-1, which can degrade fibrillar collagens (17Vogel W. Gish G.D. Alves F. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Secretion of MMP-2 by skin fibroblasts derived from granulation tissue is a key step for skin wound healing, but the underlying mechanism has not been identified (4Okada A. Tomassetto C. Lutz Y. Bellocq J.P. Rio M.C. Basset P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). MMP-2 substrate specificity includes type IV collagen and denatured type I collagen (gelatin). We therefore examined whether DDR2 might mediate the ability of type I collagen to stimulate MMP-2 synthesis. Gelatin zymography of skin extracts from DDR2−/− and DDR2+/− mice revealed two bands of gelatin degradation at ∼68 and ∼62 kDa, representing latent and active MMP-2, respectively (Fig.4A). MMP-2 activity was reduced by 60% in DDR2−/− skin extracts. No activity corresponding to the expected size of MMP-9 was observed. In isolated fibroblasts, MMP-2 activity and mRNA levels were decreased in DDR2−/− cells by 60 and 50%, respectively (Fig. 4,B and C). Reconstitution of DDR2 activity in the DDR2−/− cells restored MMP-2 activity and mRNA levels to levels similar to those observed in DDR2+/− cells. Finally, MMP-2 activity in the DDR2−/− cells expressing constitutively active FcR2 completely restored MMP-2 activity, whereas the DDR2−/− cells expressing the FcKER2 mutant showed a 50% reduction in MMP-2 activity (Fig. 4B). In contrast, retroviral infection of DDR2−/− cells with the control GFP vector did not modify their MMP-2 activity (Fig.4B) or mRNA levels (data not shown). Expression of membrane-type 1 MMP and TIMP-2, the two molecules regulating MMP-2 activity (34Werb Z. Cell. 1997; 91: 439-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar), was identical in DDR2−/− and DDR2+/− cells (data not shown). Recently, Balbin et al. (52Balbin M.

One such module, the group IV WW domain, plays an essential role in targeting the phosphorylation-specific prolyl isomerase Pin1 to its substrates.

However, phosphorylation of these modules and its functional significance have not been described, nor is it known whether the function of Pin1 is regulated. Here we show that Pin1 WW domain is phosphorylated on Ser16 both in vitro and in vivo. Further, this phosphorylation regulates the ability of the WW domain to mediate Pin1 substrate interaction and cellular localization. Moreover, both Pin1 and WW domain mutants refractory to Ser16 phosphorylation act as dominant-negative mutants to induce mitotic block and apoptosis and increase multinucleated cells with 8 N DNA content.

https://openalex.org/W1997664110,"The S100 family proteins MRP-8 (S100A8) and MRP-14 (S100A9) form a heterodimer that is abundantly expressed in neutrophils, monocytes, and some secretory epithelia. In inflamed tissues, the MRP-8/14 complex is deposited onto the endothelium of venules associated with extravasating leukocytes. To explore the receptor interactions of MRP-8/14, we use a model system in which the purified MRP-8/14 complex binds to the cell surface of an endothelial cell line, HMEC-1. This interaction is mediated by the MRP-14 subunit and is mirrored by recombinant MRP-14 alone. The cell surface binding of MRP-14 was blocked by heparin, heparan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate B, and the binding sites were sensitive to heparinase I and trypsin treatment but not to chondroitinase ABC. Furthermore MRP-8/14 and MRP-14 did not bind to a glycosaminoglycan-minus cell line. MRP-14 has a high affinity for heparin (K(d) = 6.1 +/- 3.4 nm), and this interaction mimicked that with the endothelial cells. We therefore conclude that the MRP-8/14 complex binds to endothelial cells via the MRP-14 subunit interacting chiefly with heparan sulfate proteoglycans. CD36 and RAGE, two other putative receptors for MRP-8/14, were not expressed by HMEC-1 cells. This binding activity may explain the immobilization of the MRP-8/14 complex on endothelium that is observed in vivo."

The amplitude and duration of the cGMP signal in smooth muscle is regulated in large part by cGMP-specific cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE5). Previous in vitro data have suggested that both cAMP-dependent protein kinase and PKG can regulate the activity of PDE5. To test if this type of regulation is important in the intact cell, we have generated phospho-PDE5-specific antisera and have utilized isolated smooth muscle cells from mice having a disruption in the PKG I gene as well as cells from normal human smooth muscle. The data show that in human smooth muscle cells, activation of PKG by 8-Br-cGMP led to phosphorylation and activation of PDE5. In the same cells, 8-Br-cAMP had no significant effect on PDE5 phosphorylation. Treatment of wild-type mouse aortic smooth muscle cells with 8-Br-cGMP also induced the phosphorylation of PDE5, whereas no phosphorylation was seen in smooth muscle cells isolated from mice in which the gene for PKG I had been disrupted. As with the human cells, no phosphorylation was seen in the mouse cells in response to 8-Br-cAMP. These results strongly suggest that a major regulatory pathway for control of PDE5 phosphorylation and activity in intact smooth muscle is via PKG-dependent phosphorylation of PDE5. Finally, experiments with calyculin A and okadaic acid suggest that PP1 phosphatase, the catalytic subunit of myosin phosphatase, can regulate PDE5 dephosphorylation. Together, the data suggest that phosphorylation and activation of PDE5 by PKG I and its subsequent dephosphorylation by myosin phosphatase may be key steps in the regulation of relaxation/contraction cycles of smooth muscle.

Nitric oxide, nitrovasodilators, and natriuretic peptides act as relaxants, regulating smooth muscle tone by direct activation of guanylyl cyclase, leading to the elevation of cGMP and activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). Similarly cAMP (through β-adrenergic stimulation) also induces relaxation of the same smooth muscle types. However, it has been reported recently that the cGMP/PKG pathway is independent from the cAMP/PKA pathway as a regulator of smooth muscle tone (1Pfeifer A. Klatt P. Massberg S. Ny L. Sausbier M. Hirneiss C. Wang G.X. Korth M. Aszodi A. Andersson K.E. Krombach F. Mayerhofer A. Ruth P. Fassler R. Hofmann F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3045-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Activation of PKG appears to mediate all of the NO/cGMP relaxant effects in vascular smooth muscle as disruption of the PKG I gene totally abolishes NO/cGMP-dependent relaxation of smooth muscle in mouse aorta, whereas in the same cells cAMP-dependent relaxation remained intact. Defective responses also were found in intestinal smooth muscle, where pyloric stenosis developed as a result of PKG I disruption. Disruption of the PKG I gene also caused erectile dysfunction in mice (2Hedlund P. Aszodi A. Pfeifer A. Alm P. Hofmann F. Ahmad M. Fassler R. Andersson K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2349-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In male mice the ability to reproduce was greatly diminished, and no relaxation was induced by nerve stimulation of the corpus cavernosum. Several different cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) can hydrolyze cGMP and control the duration and amplitude of the cGMP signal (3Juilfs D.M. Soderling S. Burns F. Beavo J.A. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 135: 67-104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A major cGMP-hydrolyzing enzyme expressed in all types of smooth muscle is PDE5, and selective inhibitors of PDE5 can cause smooth muscle relaxation. For example, sildenafil (Viagra®), a specific PDE5 inhibitor, is effective in the treatment of male erectile dysfunction because of its ability to potentiate the relaxant effect of NO by enhancing cGMP accumulation in the corpus cavernosum (4Boolell M. Allen M.J. Ballard S.A. Gepi-Attee S. Muirhead G.J. Naylor A.M. Osterloh I.H. Gingell C. Int. J. Impot. Res. 1996; 8: 47-52PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms for regulation of PDE5 activity are not fully understood, particularly in intact tissues. It is known from in vitro studies that cGMP can be bound to noncatalytic binding sites of PDE5 and also that phosphorylation of serine 92 is dependent on this binding (5McAllister-Lucas L.M. Sonnenburg W.K. Kadlecek A. Seger D. Trong H.L. Colbran J.L. Thomas M.K. Walsh K.A. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22863-22873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is suspected that these events somehow regulate PDE5 activity in the intact cell. This phosphorylation site is conserved in bovine, human, canine, and rat isoforms, and several groups have reported that PDE5 can be phosphorylated in vitro by either PKG or PKA. For example using the purified bovine lung enzyme, incorporation of 32P into PDE5 protein was observed only in the presence of cGMP (6Thomas M.K. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14971-14978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of cGMP to these noncatalytic sites has been proposed to be a prerequisite for phosphorylation in intact cells. However, no significant changes in PDE activity were detectable in studies designed to directly test this proposal. More recently, a 50–70% increase in the activity of partially purified recombinant bovine PDE5 was reported after phosphorylation in vitro (7Corbin J.D. Turko I.V. Beasley A. Francis S.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2760-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In another study an indirect effect of PKA phosphorylation on PDE5 activity in guinea pig airway smooth muscle cells was proposed (8Lochhead A. Nekrasova E. Arshavsky V.Y. Pyne N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18397-18403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It was shown that the γ subunit of PDE6 and/or proteins immunologically similar to it could decrease the level of PDE5 activation induced by PKA. These authors suggested that activation of PDE5 by PKA may be a result of phosphorylation of some cellular component that caused a release of the γ subunit inhibitory effect on PDE5 activity. However, no evidence for phosphorylation of PDE5 was provided. Because of these discrepancies a clear understanding of how PDE5 activity is regulated in intact cells has not been formed. A major technical difficulty has been the absence of a sensitive and specific method for assessment of PDE5 phosphorylation and activation. The widely used method of 32P incorporation is greatly limited in intact cells because of the low abundance of PDE5. It is also necessary that antibodies used for such 32P incorporation experiments be able to specifically and quantitatively immunoprecipitate PDE5 from crude extracts, a criterion that has been hard to meet. Still by using such methods, a small activation of PDE5 has been reported in cultured rat smooth muscle cells treated with ANP (9Wyatt T.A. Naftilan A.J. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H448-H455PubMed Google Scholar). However, questions remain about the specificity of the PDE5 antibody used in these studies. In addition, this method does not provide information about which residue(s) on PDE5 are phosphorylated. Here we report the application of phosphospecific (phosphoserine 92, bovine) PDE5 antibodies to determine the phosphorylation status of PDE5 in intact smooth muscle cells. These include human uterine and mouse aortic smooth muscle cells. We also utilized intact tissues and isolated cells from mice having disruptions in the PKG I gene. The data strongly suggest that in the intact cell, cGMP-dependent protein kinase but not cAMP-dependent protein kinase is a major regulator of PDE5 phosphorylation and activity. We also provide evidence that myosin phosphatase 1 (PP1) is likely to be a regulator of the dephosphorylation of PDE5 in smooth muscle. Mono Q anion exchange columns (HR 5/5) were supplied by Amersham Biosciences. Pepstatin, leupeptin, Nonidet P-40, and PP1 were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. PKG I and the catalytic subunit of PKA were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). Heat-stable inhibitor of PKA (PKI) was obtained from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Calyculin A, okadaic acid, and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD).

Mouse monoclonal antibody to VASP (specific for phosphoserine 239) and rabbit polyclonal antibody to VASP were obtained from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Human uterine smooth muscle cells (Clonetics, San Diego, CA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS and characterized as smooth muscle by expression of smooth muscle α-actin. PKG I-deficient mice were generated by homologous recombination in embryonic stem (ES) cells. The 3′ region of exon 10 of the PKG I gene, which encodes part of the ATP-binding domain essential for kinase activity, was replaced by a DNA cassette encoding an internal ribosomal entry site, the CreERT recombinase, a simian virus 40 polyadenylation signal, and a phosphoglycerate kinase promoter-driven neomycin resistance gene. Correctly targeted ES cell clones were identified by Southern blotting and injected into blastocysts to generate chimeric mice that transmitted the modified PKG I allele to the germ line. PKG I-deficient mice were phenotypically indistinguishable from those reported previously (1Pfeifer A. Klatt P. Massberg S. Ny L. Sausbier M. Hirneiss C. Wang G.X. Korth M. Aszodi A. Andersson K.E. Krombach F. Mayerhofer A. Ruth P. Fassler R. Hofmann F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3045-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Mouse aortic smooth muscle cells from wild-type and PKG I-deficient mice were prepared by enzymatic digestion as described (10Kuhbandner S. Brummer S. Metzger D. Chambon P. Hofmann F. Feil R. Genesis. 2000; 28: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and were used in the first passage. All cells were maintained in a humid incubator at 5% CO2 and 37 °C and were grown either on 6-well or 100-mm plates. In all experiments cells were incubated in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C after treatments. Smooth muscle cells were harvested after washing three times with cold PBS in homogenization buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmbenzamidine, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 25 mmsodium fluoride). The cells were homogenized by two brief sonications (2–3 s) using a Virsonic 100 sonicator (Virtis Company, NY). Tissue extracts were prepared in homogenization buffer A using a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments) followed by two brief sonications. The cell extracts were centrifuged at 16,000 or 100,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant and pellet fractions were assayed for PDE activity, and the supernatants were used for anion-exchange chromatography. For in vitro phosphorylation assays, cell extracts were incubated for 30–60 min at 30 °C. The phosphorylation buffer consisted of homogenization buffer A with 0.1 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 μl of PKG (100–300 units (Promega)/100 μl of final) or catalytic subunit of PKA (30–80 units (Promega)/100 μl of final) with or without 2–10 μmcGMP, in a total volume of 100 μl. At the end of the incubation 100 μl of the phosphorylated extract was applied to a Centri-Sep column (previously reconstituted in homogenization buffer A) and quickly spun to exchange buffers. For in vitro dephosphorylation assays, cells were homogenized in homogenization buffer B (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 0.03% Brij 35 (w/v) with protease inhibitors) and briefly sonicated. PP1 catalytic subunit (0.1 μm or 0.5 μm) was added to the extracts and incubated for 2 h at 36 °C. PP2A1 (5–20 milliunits/100 microliters of final) was incubated with the extracts for 1.5 h at 30 °C. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 2× SDS sample buffer to the samples and boiling for 5 min. Cells from six 100-mm plates were homogenized in 3 ml of homogenization buffer A, spun at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and loaded onto a Mono Q anion exchange column HR 5/5 (Amersham Biosciences). HPLC was conducted using conditions published previously (11Rybalkin S.D. Bornfeldt K.E. Sonnenburg W.K. Rybalkina I.G. Kwak K.S. Hanson K. Krebs E.G. Beavo J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2611-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A synthetic phosphopeptide C-GTPTRKISASEFDR, corresponding to the N-terminal part of bovine PDE5A1 (5McAllister-Lucas L.M. Sonnenburg W.K. Kadlecek A. Seger D. Trong H.L. Colbran J.L. Thomas M.K. Walsh K.A. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22863-22873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (aa 85–98, with a phosphorylated serine 92) or human PDE5 (aa 95–108) (12Loughney K. Hill T.R. Florio V.A. Uher L. Rosman G.J. Wolda S.L. Jones B.A. Howard M.L. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Sonnenburg W.K. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Beavo J.A. Ferguson K. Gene. 1998; 216: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), was conjugated to hemocyanin (an N-terminal Cys residue was added to facilitate conjugation) and used as immunogen for generating polyclonal phosphospecific PDE5 antibody (QBC/BIOSOURCE International). For phospho-PDE5 antibody purification, the N-terminal fragment of bovine PDE5A1 (1–125 aa) was expressed in Escherichia coli as a polyhistidine-tagged protein and purified on a Talon metal affinity resin (CLONTECH). PDE5 recombinant protein (1–125 aa) was phosphorylated after a 60-min incubation in 100 μl of the phosphorylation buffer (homogenization buffer A with 0.1 mmATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and PKG (300 units (Promega)/100 μl of final) or catalytic subunit of PKA (80 units (Promega)/100 μl of final)). After phosphorylation proteins were separated by isoelectric focusing and transferred to nitrocellulose. The protein bands on the strips of nitrocellulose were visualized by Ponceau S, cut from the blot, and used for immunoaffinity purification of phospho-PDE5 antibody using standard protocols (13Smith D.E. Fisher P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Briefly, the strips were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin/PBS for 60 min and incubated with serum (diluted 1:10 in PBS) at 4 °C overnight. After washing the strips four times in 0.1% Tween/PBS, phosphospecific antibody was eluted from the strips by incubation with 0.1m glycine, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.5% Tween-20, pH 2.5, for 1 min, immediately followed by neutralization with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.5. Purified PDE5 recombinant protein (corresponding to bovine PDE5A1 aa 125–539) was used as an antigen for production of mouse monoclonal antibodies in hybridoma cell lines (Biologics Production Facility, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA). Mouse IgGs, secreted by the hybridomas grown in culture, were used as a source of monoclonal antibody. The antibody titer and specificity were tested for ability to either immunoprecipitate PDE5 or detect it in Western blot analysis. Monoclonal antibodies able to quantitatively immunoprecipitate human and mouse PDE5 were used in this study. Production and purification of the polyclonal C-terminal PDE5 antibodies, raised against a synthetic peptide, CRKNRQKWQALAEQQEK (bovine aa 836–852 and human aa 846–862), and polyclonal PDE1C antibody, raised against a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein from the C-terminal part of PDE1C, were described previously (11Rybalkin S.D. Bornfeldt K.E. Sonnenburg W.K. Rybalkina I.G. Kwak K.S. Hanson K. Krebs E.G. Beavo J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2611-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Smooth muscle cells grown on 100-mm plastic cell culture plates were washed three times with cold PBS. Cells were harvested in 500 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer (IP buffer) containing 50 mmTris (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, and 25 mm sodium fluoride. Cells were homogenized by two 2–3 s sonications using a Virsonic 100 sonicator. Lysates were incubated with phospho-PDE5 antibody or monoclonal PDE5 antibody overnight followed by incubation with protein A or protein G-agarose beads and then separated into supernatant and pellet fractions. The immunopellet was washed three times in IP buffer. PDE activity was measured in samples before and after immunoprecipitation. After the final wash, the immunopellets were either boiled in SDS sample buffer for Western blot analysis or resuspended in the homogenization buffer, pH 7.4, and subsequently assayed for PDE activity. Samples were diluted in 2× SDS sample buffer, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, loaded onto an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (8% acrylamide, 0.21% bisacrylamide), and electrophoresed. The separated proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose and immunostained with isozyme-specific antibodies. The immunoreactivity was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgGs or goat anti-mouse IgGs and SuperSignal® West Pico chemiluminescent substrate. Isoelectrofocusing (IEF) was performed under native conditions using IEF ready gels, pH 5–8, in Mini-Protean II system with 1.2 mm phosphoric acid as the anode buffer and 20 mm lysine, 20 mm arginine as the cathode buffer. Samples were diluted in 50% glycerol (v/v) and loaded onto the IEF gel. IEF was run under constant voltage in three steps: 100 V for 1 h, 250 V for 1 h, and 500 V for 30 min. After focusing the IEF gels were either stained with a staining solution or transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blotting. Phosphodiesterase assays were carried out according to established procedures (14Sonnenburg W.K. Rybalkin S.D. Bornfeldt K.E. Kwak K.S. Rybalkina I.G. Beavo J.A. Methods. 1998; 14: 3-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). All assays were performed at 30 °C using either 1 μm cAMP or 1 μm cGMP as substrates in the presence of either 1 mm EGTA or 0.8 mm CaCl2 and 4 μg/ml calmodulin. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method. A phosphospecific PDE5 antibody was raised against a peptide containing phosphoserine 92 (serine 92 in bovine PDE5). To determine the specificity of the antibody it was necessary to generate samples of PDE5 in both the dephosphorylated and phosphorylated states. A completely dephosphorylated form of an N-terminal domain of bovine PDE5 (aa 1–125) that contained the phosphorylation site was expressed in bacteria as a polyhistidine-tagged protein and purified to homogeneity by metal-affinity chromatography. It was expected that because bacterially expressed proteins are not likely to be phosphorylated this method would provide a good control for specificity and sensitivity of the antibody. However, to be sure the protein was fully in the dephosphorylated form, the method of isoelectric focusing under native conditions was employed. In these studies the PDE5 fragments were resolved by isoelectric focusing into one major band with a pI of 6.9 and two minor bands. Phosphorylation of this protein either by PKG or the catalytic subunit of PKA led to a shift of isoelectric points for all bands (Fig. 1A). These data verify that the bacterially expressed protein was in a dephosphorylated state. The phosphorylation conditions used provided complete phosphorylation of the PDE5 fragment, and no bands were left in the positions detected before phosphorylation. The finding that the bacterially expressed PDE5 N-terminal domain could be completely phosphorylated and separated from dephospho forms was used as the basis for affinity purification of phospho-PDE5 antibody. Crude serum was purified on strips containing phospho-PDE5 according to the procedure described in the previous section. SDS-PAGE chromatography did not reveal any shift in electrophoretic mobility between nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of this protein (Fig. 1B). The specificity of the purified phospho-PDE5 antibody was tested against the same proteins using Western analysis. This antibody had a much higher sensitivity toward phosphorylated protein and could specifically recognize phosphorylated PDE5 but not dephosphorylated PDE5 analyzed at the ng range of loaded protein (Fig. 1C). Several PDE isozymes are able to hydrolyze cGMP. To determine which ones were most likely to be important in uterine smooth muscle, extracts from human uterine smooth muscle cells were resolved by anion-change chromatography on a Mono Q column, and PDE activities were analyzed at substrate concentrations of 1 μm. The Ca2+/CaM-stimulated activity eluted in fractions 7–10 was identified as PDE1C using Western blot analysis. PDE1C differs from other PDE1s in its ability to hydrolyze cAMP and cGMP equally well. Immunoprecipitation of this activity with ACC-1 (mouse monoclonal IgG, which is reactive with all Ca2+/CaM PDE1s) (11Rybalkin S.D. Bornfeldt K.E. Sonnenburg W.K. Rybalkina I.G. Kwak K.S. Hanson K. Krebs E.G. Beavo J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2611-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) revealed that PDE1C from these cells also had similar cAMP and cGMP hydrolytic activities in the presence of Ca2+/CaM (data not shown). The PDE5 activity, determined as cGMP hydrolytic activity measured in the presence of EGTA, was eluted in fractions 8–16 and partially overlapped with PDE1C in the HPLC profile. As shown in Fig. 2, the PDE profile was found to be similar to the profile obtained previously for human aortic smooth muscle cells (11Rybalkin S.D. Bornfeldt K.E. Sonnenburg W.K. Rybalkina I.G. Kwak K.S. Hanson K. Krebs E.G. Beavo J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2611-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, the relative ratio between the peaks of activity corresponding to the two major PDE isoforms was somewhat different (Fig. 2). In uterine cells the level of PDE5 expression was much higher, and PDE1C expression was lower than in aortic smooth muscle cells. The presence of PDE1C in human uterine smooth muscle cells supports the observation that this enzyme is specifically expressed in proliferating human smooth muscle cells but not in non-human smooth muscle cells. PDE5 was the major cGMP-hydrolyzing enzyme in uterine smooth muscle cells analyzed at 1 μm cyclic nucleotide concentration, although PDE1C probably also contributes to the total cGMP-hydrolyzing activity. To assess the relative ratio of these two PDEs in the crude extract, PDE5 activity was precipitated from smooth muscle cell extracts with an excess of mouse monoclonal antibody. By this estimate about 75% of the total cGMP-hydrolyzing activity was contributed by PDE5 as measured at 1 μm substrate. Similar results were obtained by applying the PDE5-specific inhibitor, sildenafil. At 60 nm, sildenafil inhibited essentially all of the PDE5 activity with no significant effect on the Ca2+/CaM activation of PDE1C (data not shown). In vitro either PKG or the catalytic subunit of PKA was effective in the phosphorylation of PDE5 in extracts of uterine smooth muscle cells. The degree of phosphorylation was dependent on the concentration of cGMP present during the phosphorylation step, reaching a maximum at 10 μm cGMP (Fig. 3). Increasing the cGMP concentration to 25 μm did not lead to a higher degree of phosphorylation. As control experiments, PKA-induced phosphorylation of PDE5 in the presence of cGMP was completely blocked by PKI, whereas PKG-induced phosphorylation was not affected by the addition of PKI (data not shown). It has been shown previously with purified proteins that phosphorylation of PDE5 is promoted if cGMP occupies the noncatalytic binding sites (6Thomas M.K. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14971-14978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that the activity of the catalytic subunit of PKA could significantly increase phosphorylation of PDE5 in the presence of cGMP confirms this finding. To measure cGMP PDE activity in the samples after phosphorylation, quick-spin columns were used to exchange the buffer and remove excess cGMP. Maximal activation of PDE5 by PKG or the PKA catalytic subunit was 4-fold and corresponded to the samples with the highest phosphorylation level. 8-Br-cGMP could stimulate phosphorylation of PDE5 by either PKG or the catalytic subunit of PKA but only at high concentrations. To reach the same level of phosphorylation elicited by 10 μm cGMP the concentration of 8-Br-cGMP needed to be increased to 150 μm, presumably because it binds poorly to the noncatalytic sites of PDE5 (6Thomas M.K. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14971-14978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For studies in intact cells the cell-permeant cyclic nucleotide analogs 8-Br-cAMP and 8-Br-cGMP were used for activation of PKA and PKG. Phosphorylation of VASP, a well characterized substrate for both PKA and PKG, was also studied in these experiments as a control for the effectiveness of the analogs (15Smolenski A. Bachmann C. Reinhard K. Honig-Liedl P. Jarchau T. Hoschuetzky H. Walter U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20029-20035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). VASP is a 46/50-kDa vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein that can be phosphorylated in response to either cAMP-elevating agents (prostaglandins or forskolin) or cGMP-elevating agents (nitric oxide donors). Phosphorylation of the PKG-preferable site can be detected using a phospho-VASP monoclonal antibody that reacts specifically with phosphoserine 239. PKG can also phosphorylate another site (serine 157), which is the site preferentially phosphorylated by PKA. Phosphorylation of serine 157 leads to a shift in the apparent molecular mass from 46 to 50 kDa on SDS-PAGE. This shift is easily detectable by Western analysis using any specific VASP antibody. Similarly, the PKG-preferable site, serine 239, could be also phosphorylated by PKA. Therefore, by using the appropriate combination of serine 239 phosphospecific antibody and total VASP antibody we could determine which of the two sites was phosphorylated when either 8-Br-cAMP or 8-Br-cGMP was applied. Addition of 1 mm 8-Br-cGMP to the human uterine smooth muscle cells led to a gradual accumulation of the phosphorylated form of PDE5 starting from 10 min and reaching a maximum at 30 min (Fig.4A). Phosphorylation remained steady for up to 60 min of incubation time. Interestingly, the time course of VASP phosphorylation was similar to the time course for PDE5 phosphorylation.

Ejection velocities derived from studying observed families, however, are surprisingly high compared with results from impact experiments and simulations. One way to resolve this apparent contradiction is by assuming that D less, similar 20 kilometer family members, since their formation, have undergone semimajor axis drift by the thermal force called the Yarkovsky effect. Interactions between drifting family members and resonances can also produce unique eccentricity and/or inclination changes. Together, these outcomes help explain (i) why families are sharply bounded by nearby Kirkwood gaps, (ii) why some families have asymmetric shapes, and (iii) the curious presence of family members on short-lived orbits."
https://openalex.org/W2020960792,"With the draft sequence of the human genome available, there is a need to better define gene function in the context of systems biology. We studied 239 cardiovascular and renal phenotypes in 113 male rats derived from an F2 intercross and mapped 81 of these traits onto the genome. Aggregates of traits were identified on chromosomes 1, 2, 7, and 18. Systems biology was assessed by examining patterns of correlations (""physiological profiles"") that can be used for gene hunting, mechanism-based physiological studies, and, with comparative genomics, translating these data to the human genome."
https://openalex.org/W1986897852,"The interactions of the dermatan sulfate proteoglycans biglycan and decorin have been investigated with the elastic fiber components, tropoelastin, fibrillin-containing microfibrils, and microfibril-associated glycoproteins (MAGP) 1 and 2. Both proteoglycans were found to bind tropoelastin and fibrillin-containing microfibrils but not MAGPs 1 and 2 in solid phase binding assays. The specificity of the binding of biglycan and decorin to tropoelastin was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments and by the blocking of the interactions with elastin-derived peptides. Isolated core proteins from biglycan and decorin bound to tropoelastin more strongly than the intact proteoglycans, and there were no differences in the tropoelastin binding characteristics of distinct glucuronate-rich and iduronate-rich glycoforms of biglycan. These findings indicated that the binding sites were contained in the protein cores of the proteoglycans rather than the glycosaminoglycan side chains. Scatchard analysis showed that biglycan bound more avidly than decorin to tropoelastin with K(d) values estimated as 1.95 x 10(-7) m and 5.3 x 10(-7) m, respectively. In blocking experiments each proteoglycan showed extensive inhibition of binding of the other to tropoelastin but was most effective at blocking its own binding. This result suggested that biglycan and decorin had closely spaced but distinct binding sites on tropoelastin. Addition of the elastin-binding protein MAGP-1 to the assays enhanced the binding of biglycan to tropoelastin but had no effect on the decorin-tropoelastin interaction. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that MAGP-1 interacted with biglycan but not decorin in the solution phase. The results indicated that biglycan specifically formed a ternary complex with tropoelastin and MAGP-1. Overall the study supports the concept that biglycan may have a specific role in the elastinogenic phase of elastic fiber formation."
https://openalex.org/W2020271217,"DNA replication in bacteria is carried out by a multiprotein complex, which is thought to contain only one essential DNA polymerase, specified by the dnaE gene in Escherichia coli and the polC gene in Bacillus subtilis. Bacillus subtilis genome analysis has revealed another DNA polymerase gene, dnaE(BS), which is homologous to dnaE. We show that, in B. subtilis, dnaE(BS) is essential for cell viability and for the elongation step of DNA replication, as is polC, and we conclude that there are two different essential DNA polymerases at the replication fork of B. subtilis, as was previously observed in eukaryotes. dnaE(BS) appears to be involved in the synthesis of the lagging DNA strand and to be associated with the replication factory, which suggests that two different polymerases carry out synthesis of the two DNA strands in B. subtilis and in many other bacteria that contain both polC and dnaE genes."
https://openalex.org/W1965112825,"The platelet response to collagen is a primary event in hemostasis and thrombosis, but the precise roles of the numerous identified platelet collagen receptors remain incompletely defined. Attention has recently focused on glycoprotein VI (GPVI), a receptor that is expressed on platelets in association with a signaling adapter, the Fc receptor gamma chain (Fc Rγ). Genetic and pharmacologic loss of GPVI function results in loss of collagen signaling in platelets, but studies to date have failed to demonstrate that GPVI-Fc Rγ expression is sufficient to confer collagen signaling responses. These results have led to the hypothesis that collagen responses mediated by GPVI-Fc Rγ may require the collagen-binding integrin α2β1 as a co-receptor, but this model has not been supported by a recent study of mouse platelets lacking α2β1. In the present study we have used a novel anti-GPVI monoclonal antibody to measure the level of GPVI on human platelets and to guide the development of GPVI-expressing cell lines to assess the role of GPVI in mediating platelet collagen responses. GPVI receptor density on human platelets appears tightly regulated, is independent from the level of α2β1 expression, and significantly exceeds that on previously characterized GPVI-expressing RBL-2H3 cells. Using newly generated GPVI-expressing RBL-2H3 cells with receptor densities equivalent to that on human platelets, we demonstrate that GPVI expression confers both adhesive and signaling responses to collagen in a graded fashion that is proportional to the GPVI receptor density. These results resolve some of the conflicting data regarding GPVI-collagen interactions and demonstrate that 1) GPVI-Fc Rγ expression is sufficient to confer both adhesion and signaling responses to collagen, and 2) GPVI-mediated collagen responses are receptor density-dependent at the receptor levels expressed on human platelets.

Nature. 2000; 407: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (4566) Google Scholar). Platelets respond to vessel wall injury via surface receptors that recognize exposed subendothelial matrix proteins, the most abundant of which is collagen. Collagen is unusual among platelet ligands because it mediates both platelet adhesion and platelet activation (2Wilner G.D. Nossel H.L. LeRoy E.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1968; 47: 2616-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Platelet adhesion to collagen initiates the thrombotic response, and platelet activation in response to collagen accelerates the thrombotic response through release of granule contents and activation of platelet integrins. The ability of collagen to mediate both of these steps suggests that the platelet response to collagen may be a key step in the regulation of arterial thrombosis. A molecular understanding of the platelet receptors that mediate collagen responses is therefore likely to shed light on the pathogenesis of common vascular diseases such as myocardial infarction and stroke. The receptors for collagen on the surface of platelets may be divided into those which interact indirectly through collagen-bound von Willebrand factor (vWF),1including GPIbα and the integrin αIIbβ3, and those which interact directly with collagen, including glycoprotein VI (GPVI), the integrin α2β1, CD36, and perhaps others (recently reviewed in Ref. 3Clemetson K.J. Clemetson J.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The present model of platelet responses to collagen is one of successive receptor interactions mediating rolling, firm adhesion to collagen and platelet activation (4Sixma J.J. van Zanten G.H. Huizinga E.G. van der Plas R.M. Verkley M. Wu Y.P. Gros P. de Groot P.G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 5Barnes M.J. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1998; 5: 314-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although the receptor actions responsible for collagen-vWF interaction have been clearly identified (6Savage B. Saldivar E. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar, 7Savage B. Almus-Jacobs F. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar), those responsible for direct collagen interactions remain unclear. A recently proposed two-receptor, two-step model in which adhesion to collagen is first mediated by high affinity interaction with α2β1 and platelet activation is subsequently initiated by low affinity interaction with GPVI (5Barnes M.J. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1998; 5: 314-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) is attractive because it assigns unique roles to each receptor and presents a stepwise sequence of events that resemble those described for leukocyte-endothelial interactions during inflammatory responses (8Hynes R.O. Wagner D.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: S11-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the experimental data reported to date have been conflicting and have failed to support this model or to demonstrate clear and sufficient roles for α2β1 and GPVI. Human α2β1 deficiency states reportedly result in bleeding disorders and platelets with severely reduced collagen responses (9Nieuwenhuis H.K. Akkerman J.W. Houdijk W.P. Sixma J.J. Nature. 1985; 318: 470-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 10Kehrel B. Balleisen L. Kokott R. Mesters R. Stenzinger W. Clemetson K.J. van de Loo J. Blood. 1988; 71: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but a recent analysis of mice lacking platelet α2β1 demonstrated normal bleeding times, normal platelet adhesion to collagen, and almost no loss of platelet signaling responses to collagen (11Nieswandt B. Brakebusch C. Bergmeier W. Schulte V. Bouvard D. Mokhtari-Nejad R. Lindhout T. Heemskerk J.W. Zirngibl H. Fassler R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2120-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Deficiency of GPVI and its signaling partner Fc Rγ, however, results in loss of platelet collagen responses in both human and mouse platelets (11Nieswandt B. Brakebusch C. Bergmeier W. Schulte V. Bouvard D. Mokhtari-Nejad R. Lindhout T. Heemskerk J.W. Zirngibl H. Fassler R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2120-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 12Sugiyama T. Okuma M. Ushikubi F. Sensaki S.

Thus loss of function studies have presented a confusing picture in which the roles of multiple collagen receptors may be required but are poorly understood. In an effort to more precisely define the roles of individual collagen receptors we have developed a model system with which to examine collagen receptor function by conferring a gain of function to collagen-unresponsive cells. To address the role of GPVI we have expressed the receptor in RBL-2H3 cells, a basophilic leukemia cell line that lacks GPVI and α2β1 but expresses the GPVI signaling co-receptor Fc Rγ (14Zheng Y.M. Liu C. Chen H. Locke D. Ryan J.C. Kahn M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12999-13006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Heterologous expression of GPVI in RBL-2H3 cells confirmed the critical role of Fc Rγ for GPVI signaling and demonstrated that both the GPVI transmembrane domain and C-tail are required for Fc Rγ coupling (14Zheng Y.M. Liu C. Chen H. Locke D. Ryan J.C. Kahn M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12999-13006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, GPVI expression conferred both signaling and adhesive responses to the high affinity GPVI ligand convulxin (CVX), a snake venom protein used to biochemically purify the receptor (15Clemetson J.M. Polgar J. Magnenat E. Wells T.N. Clemetson K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29019-29024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), but failed to confer either adhesive or signaling responses to collagen (14Zheng Y.M. Liu C. Chen H. Locke D. Ryan J.C. Kahn M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12999-13006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These results suggest that GPVI might utilize one or more of the other platelet collagen receptors as a co-receptor for collagen interaction. A limitation of this study, however, was the inability to directly compare GPVI receptor density on RBL-2H3 cells with that on human platelets because of the lack of an available anti-GPVI antibody. In the present study we have used a novel anti-GPVI monoclonal antibody to directly measure GPVI receptor density on human platelets and on both previously described and newly generated GPVI-expressing RBL-2H3 cells. Our results demonstrate that GPVI expression is sufficient to confer both adhesive and signaling responses to collagen independent of other collagen receptors but that GPVI-collagen responses are strictly dependent on receptor density. A 5-fold difference in GPVI receptor density separates RBL-2H3 cells that exhibit no collagen responses (14Zheng Y.M. Liu C. Chen H. Locke D. Ryan J.C. Kahn M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12999-13006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) from those that exhibit both adhesion and signaling responses. Comparison of the GPVI receptor density required to confer collagen responses in RBL-2H3 cells with that on the surface of human platelets reveals that platelets have a GPVI receptor density equivalent to that required to confer a full collagen response in RBL-2H3 cells. To determine whether the GPVI expression level on human platelets modulates collagen responses we measured GPVI levels on the platelets of a small but genetically diverse group of individuals and found only minimal variation compared with those of α2β1. Our findings are generally consistent with those obtained using β1-deficient mouse platelets and support a model of platelet collagen responses in which GPVI plays a central role for both adhesion and signaling. Determining the role of GPVI in the pathogenesis of arterial thrombotic diseases such as stroke and myocardial infarction is an important area of future investigation. Fibrillar collagen and convulxin used in the studies are from the same sources as previously described (14Zheng Y.M. Liu C. Chen H. Locke D. Ryan J.C. Kahn M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12999-13006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-FLAG (Clone M2) was purchased from Sigma. Anti-human GPVI monoclonal antibody (clone HY101; mouse IgG1, κ) was produced in our laboratory (see below). FITC-conjugated anti-rat alpha 2 antibody (clone Ha12/9, hamster) was obtained from BD PharMingen. RBL-2H3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 μg/ml gentamicin. Fc receptor gamma chain (Fc Rγ)-deficient mice (Taconic Farms) were crossed to BALB/c mice (Ace Animals, Boyertown, PA) to generate Fc Rγ heterozygous mice, Fc Rγ+/−. All of the mice used for study were maintained in the animal facility of the University of Pennsylvania. RBL-2H3 cells stably expressing FLAG-GPVI were generated as previously described. A total of 177 G418-resistant stable clones were screened for FLAG epitope expression using M2 anti-FLAG antibody and for collagen signaling and adhesion as described below; selected clones were chosen for further analysis. To generate monoclonal antibodies versus the human GPVI receptor we expressed FLAG-GPVI R272L (14Zheng Y.M. Liu C. Chen H. Locke D. Ryan J.C. Kahn M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12999-13006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) on the surface of 3T3 fibroblasts derived from BALB/c mice (ATCC) that were injected intraperitoneally as immunogens. The GPVI R272L mutant, which has a wild-type extracellular domain, was expressed to ensure that surface GPVI expression was not limited by lack of co-expressed Fc Rγ (14Zheng Y.M. Liu C. Chen H. Locke D. Ryan J.C. Kahn M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12999-13006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Hybridomas were generated using standard techniques by the monoclonal antibody core facility at the University of Pennsylvania. Hybridoma supernatants were pooled (n = 8 or 12) and screened on GPVI-expressing RBL-2H3 cells for reactivity to GPVI. Reactivityversus human GPVI was confirmed on human platelets using fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Pure antibody was prepared by affinity chromatography on protein G-Sepharose (Mab Trap G II kit, Amersham Biosciences) from HY101 ascites fluid. Increases in cytoplasmic calcium were measured using the calcium-sensitive dye Fura-2 as previously described (14Zheng Y.M. Liu C. Chen H. Locke D. Ryan J.C. Kahn M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12999-13006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). 2 × 105 cells were allowed to adhere to the plate coated overnight with 1 μg/well of CVX or type I collagen for 5′, 15′, and 30′, respectively. The plate was washed with PBS several times. The number of cells bound to the plate was correlated to intracellular β-hexosaminidase activity detected as previously described (14Zheng Y.M. Liu C. Chen H. Locke D. Ryan J.C. Kahn M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12999-13006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) using the endogenous RBL-2H3 cell enzyme β-hexosaminidase to measure cell number (16Posner R.G. Subramanian K. Goldstein B. Thomas J. Feder T. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3601-3609PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse blood was drawn into citrate buffer from the inferior vena cava of mice anesthetized by pentobarbital. Platelet-rich plasma was separated from the rest of the blood cells by centrifugation of 1–2× diluted blood with modified Tyrode's buffer at 220 g for 10 min at room temperature. Plasma-free platelets were obtained by filtering platelet-rich plasma through a Sepharose 2B column (Amersham Biosciences) in modified Tyrode's buffer (137 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 5.6 mm Glucose, 1 mg/ml BSA, 1 mmMgCl2, 2.7 mm KCl, and 3.3 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.4). The platelets were counted in a Coulter Counter and adjusted to 5 × 108/ml in modified Tyrode's buffer. In each aggregation test, 0.25 ml of filtered platelets was stimulated with 20 μm ADP or collagen ranging from 1.25 to 10 μg/ml. Platelet aggregation was monitored in a Chrono-log aggregometer. RBL cells and GPVI-expressing RBL cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation (RIPA) buffer, and Western blotting was performed as previously described (14Zheng Y.M. Liu C. Chen H. Locke D. Ryan J.C. Kahn M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12999-13006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Ten million cells were incubated with 1 ml of HY101 supernatant for 2 h at 4 °C with rocking. The treated cells were then washed with cold PBS three times and lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer. 20 μl of protein G-agarose was added into each type of lysate supernatant and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with rocking. The protein G-agarose pellets were washed with radioimmune precipitation buffer three times, mixed with 50 μl of 2× sample buffer supplemented with 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, and boiled for 5 min. The supernatant of protein G-agarose was analyzed in SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described above except that the primary antibody was 1 μg/ml anti-FLAG M2 antibody instead of the hybridoma supernatant. HY101 was covalently modified with FITC using the FluoReporter labeling kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Probes F-6434). FITC-conjugated HY101 with 5.1 FITC molecules per antibody was obtained. Iodination of HY101 was carried out using Iodo-tubes according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Human platelet-rich plasma and GPVI-expressing RBL cells were incubated with 0–3 μg/ml125I-HY101 for 1 h at room temperature. The cell/antibody mixtures were loaded on top of a sucrose solution (500 μl of 20% w/v sucrose in 5 mm EDTA and 0.1 mPBS, pH 7.4) in microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 g for platelets and 15 min at 200 g for RBL cells. The supernatants were aspirated, and radioactivity of cell pellets was counted for determination of the total 125I-HY101 bound. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 50-fold excess of unlabeled HY101 and was subtracted from the values for the total125I-HY101 bound. 125I-HY101-specific binding was converted to the number of GPVI receptors per cell based on the specific activity of 125I-HY101 and the assumption that one antibody binds to one GPVI molecule. To determine the percent platelet GPVI receptor density of different GPVI-expressing RBL-2H3 cells, we used an average platelet diameter of 1 μm (17Lippincott J.B. Colman R. Hirsh J. Marder V. Salzman E. Hemostasis and Thrombosis; Basic principles and clinical practice. 1986Google Scholar) and an average RBL-2H3 cell diameter of 10 μm. The RBL-2H3 cell diameter was estimated using the “three-quarter size method” with a single threshold Coulter Z series counter (Coulter, Hileah, FL). Briefly, values for the mean and median of the cell population distribution were obtained by taking a value representing 75% of the modal particle diameter; modal value was determined after current, and gain was optimized using the “plateau” method. Latex beads (10.05 μm) were used to precalibrate the machine. The mean/median bead size was estimated to be 10.10 μm ± 0.35 by the three-quarter size technique (n = 6). The RBL cell population had a skewed distribution with median 10.80 μm ± 1.07 μm and mode 12.26 μm ± 0.78 μm (n = 6). These results agree with published data using direct biophysical methods (18Spudich A. Braunstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6976-6980Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 19Braunstein D. Spudich A. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1717-1725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cell diameter was used to obtain a ratio of 100:1 for RBL-2H3:platelet surface area (based on the surface area as a function of r2). The percent platelet receptor density was therefore calculated as RBL-2H3 receptor/1260. To precisely measure GPVI receptor density on RBL-2H3 cells and human platelets we raised monoclonal antibodies against mouse BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts, which express the mutant GPVI receptor FLAG-GPVI R272L on the surface (GPVI-3T3) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” GPVI-3T3 express a large number of FLAG-GPVI R272L on the cell surface presumably because the R272L mutation uncouples GPVI receptor expression from that of Fc Rγ, a protein not expressed in fibroblasts but normally required for GPVI expression (14Zheng Y.M.

Rackebrandt K. Gessner J.E. Zirngibl H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23998-24002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). FLAG-GPVI R272L has a wild-type extracellular domain and a molecular weight indistinguishable from wild-type GPVI (Ref. 14Zheng Y.M. Liu C. Chen H. Locke D. Ryan J.C. Kahn M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12999-13006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, data not shown). One antibody (designated HY101) was identified, which bound to the surface of FLAG-GPVI-expressing RBL-2H3 cells and GPVI-3T3 cells in a manner identical to the anti-FLAG antibody but did not bind untransfected RBL-2H3 or 3T3 cells (Fig.1A), consistent with recognition of FLAG-GPVI. Western blotting of cell lysate derived from wild-type and FLAG GPVI-expressing RBL-2H3 cells with HY101 identified a 60-kDa band in the lysate from GPVI-expressing cells but not wild-type cells (Fig. 1B). Finally, immunoprecipitation studies using HY101 identified the 60-kDa protein recognized by HY101 as FLAG-GPVI using M2 anti-FLAG secondary antibody (Fig.1C). The ability of HY101 to recognize wild-type GPVI on the surface of human platelets was demonstrated by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (Fig.2 and discussed below). Thus HY101 is a novel monoclonal antibody that recognizes the extracellular domain of human GPVI. Binding of HY101 to human platelets or GPVI-expressing RBL2H3 cells does not interfere with either collagen or CVX signaling (data not shown), suggesting that it binds a region of the extracellular domain of GPVI distinct from the binding sites of both ligands.Figure 2Measurement of GPVI receptor density on human platelets and surface expression of GPVIversus the integrin α2β1.A, 125I-HY101 binding to human platelets.

HY101 binding to human platelets is highly specific (Fig.2A). Analysis of platelets from three individuals with125I-HY101 (using a full dose-response curve as shown in Fig. 2A in triplicate for each individual) reveals an average GPVI receptor density of 1260 ± 190 per platelet (Fig.2A and data not shown). Virtually identical numbers, 1250 ± 210 receptors per platelet, were obtained using mean fluorescence and FITC-HY101 analysis of 20 individuals from Caucasian, Asian, and African-American backgrounds of both sexes (Fig.2B and data not shown). As reflected by the small standard deviations, GPVI receptor levels varied by less than 40% in this small but genetically diverse group of individuals (Fig. 2B). In contrast, analysis of α2β1 levels in the same platelets exhibited a more than 3-fold variation (Fig. 2C). Although these results are limited by the small size of the group studied, the level of GPVI receptors on human platelets does not appear to vary as extensively as or in correlation with that of α2β1. We have described previously GPVI-expressing RBL-2H3 cells that respond to the GPVI ligand CVX but not to collagen (14Zheng Y.M. Liu C. Chen H. Locke D. Ryan J.C. Kahn M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12999-13006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The absence of a GPVI antibody made direct comparison of GPVI receptor density on these cells with that on platelets difficult, and the conclusion that the two cell types had similar GPVI receptor densities was reached on the basis of nearly identical CVX dose responses (14Zheng Y.M. Liu C. Chen H. Locke D. Ryan J.C. Kahn M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12999-13006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The development of the anti-GPVI antibody HY101 allowed us to directly measure the GPVI receptor number on the GPVI-expressing RBL-2H3 cells we had originally characterized (GPVI-ori) and to compare the receptor density on the model cell line with that on human platelets. Our results (summarized in TableI) revealed that despite robust responses to CVX the GPVI receptor density on GPVI-ori is only ∼20% of that found on human platelets. These results suggest that the failure to confer collagen responses in those cells may have been because of inadequate receptor density, and efforts were made to generate new GPVI-expressing RBL-2H3 cell lines with GPVI receptor densities closer to that of human platelets. Of the new GPVI-expressing cell lines identified, two were chosen for further analysis of collagen adhesive and signaling responses. GPVI-163 expresses GPVI at approximately half the receptor density of platelets, and GPVI-173 expresses GPVI at roughly the same density as platelets (Table I and Fig.3).Table IGPVI receptor density on three GPVI-expressing RBL-2H3 cell lines and comparison with that on human plateletsGPVI-expressing RBL-2H3 cloneMean fluorescence using FITC-HY101Receptor number using125I-HY101Estimated % platelet GPVI receptor density%GPVI-ori924,045 ± 18019GPVI-1632863,678 ± 230851GPVI-17356134,661 ± 1721108The relative and absolute level of GPVI receptor expression on three GPVI-expressing RBL-2H3 cell lines was determined using FITC-HY101 and125I-HY101 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The mean fluorescence for each cell line is from a single experiment that was representative of over four distinct experiments.

The estimated percent of platelet GPVI receptor density was calculated based on known platelet and RBL-2H3 cell sizes and measurements as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To further address the role of GPVI in platelet adhesion to collagen, static adhesion assays were performed using GPVI-ori, GPVI-163, and GPVI-173. As previously reported, GPVI-expressing cells with the lowest density of GPVI receptors bound CVX but not collagen (Fig.4). GPVI-163 and GPVI-173, however, both adhered to collagen-coated surfaces but did so more slowly and to a lesser extent than to CVX-coated surfaces (Fig. 4). Similar to adhesion to CVX, however, GPVI-mediated adhesion to collagen does not require Mg2+ or Ca2+ (data not shown). These results demonstrate that GPVI expression is sufficient to confer static adhesion to collagen but that GPVI-collagen interaction requires a threshold receptor density that is >20% of that expressed on human platelets. The role of receptor density for GPVI-collagen adhesive interaction is further revealed by the slower rate of adhesion observed using GPVI-163 cells that express half the receptor number of GPVI-173. The ability to confer collagen adhesion through expression of GPVI at an appropriate receptor density demonstrates direct GPVI-collagen interaction and suggests that collagen signaling may also be mediated by GPVI in a density-dependent fashion.

Arsenic shares many properties of tumor promoters by affecting specific cell signal transduction pathways responsible for cell proliferation. The activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) pathway is important in mediating gene expression related to regulation of cellular growth. In the current studies, we demonstrate that arsenic activates EGFR and ERK in a human uroepithelial cell line. The EGFR phosphorylation by arsenic is ligand-independent and does not involve the major autophosphorylation site Tyr1173. c-Src activity is also induced by arsenic and is a prerequisite for the EGFR and ERK activation. Consistent with these in vitroobservations, exposure of mice to arsenic in drinking water, which has been found previously to be associated with AP-1 activation and epithelial proliferation, induces EGFR and ERK activation in the urinary bladder. This response is also accompanied with an increase in c-Src levels interacting with EGFR. These findings represent a potential pathway for mediating arsenic-induced phenotypic changes in the uroepithelium.

In the last few years, a tendency of increased incidences of urinary bladder transitional cell carcinomas in the United States has been reported (4Negri E. La Vecchia C. Eur. J. Cancer Prev. 2001; 10: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Epidemiological studies are underway to investigate whether this phenomenon might be associated with the arsenic levels in drinking water (5Karagas M.R. Tosteson T.D. Blum J. Morris J.S. Baron J.A. Klaue B. Environ. Health Perspect. 1998; 106: 1047-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Arsenic is not a classical carcinogen, and adequate scientific data on the mode of arsenic action, which has yet to be established, will help determine the safe exposure levels. Subsequently, the mechanisms of arsenic carcinogenesis have been under intense investigation, and increasing evidence suggests that arsenic shares many properties of tumor promoters by affecting specific cell signal transduction pathways involved in cell proliferation (reviewed in Ref. 6Simeonova P.P. Luster M.I. J. Environ. Pathol. Toxicol. Oncol. 2000; 19: 281-286PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, arsenic has been demonstrated to activate members of the MAP kinase family, transcription factors such as AP-1, and immediate early genes, including c-fos, c-jun, and c-myc, whose products help regulate the expression of transforming oncoproteins and growth factors (7Liu Y.

Pharmacol. 1996; 93: 131-148PubMed Google Scholar). The application of certain physical or chemical stimuli, which are considered cellular stressors, such as arsenic, sulfhydryl reagents, UV radiation, or oxidants, has been shown to activate EGFR1 as a prerequisite of MAPK activation (11Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). EGF stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of its receptor by homodimerization of EGFR and activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (12Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1987; 328: 820-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The stressor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR might be caused by the activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (as a result of direct effects on the receptor and its kinases or dephosphorylation events through inactivation of protein tyrosine phosphatases) or alternatively, by non-receptor tyrosine kinases including c-Src. Because phosphotyrosine phosphatases have highly conserved sulfhydryl groups in their catalytic site, they are potential targets for oxidation by UV or sulfhydryl reagents (11Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Arsenite has been shown to activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) through sulfhydryl-dependent inactivation of JNK phosphatase (8Cavigelli M. Li W.W. Lin A. Su B. Yoshioka K. Karin M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6269-6279Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The role of non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Src in arsenic-induced EGFR-MAPK activation has not been investigated. c-Src can bind physically to EGFR and induce tyrosine phosphorylation (13Tice D.A. Biscardi J.S. Nickles A.L. Parsons S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Parallel activation of c-Src and EGFR has been identified in many human cancers (14Irby R.B. Yeatman T.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5636-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). The objectives of this study were to evaluate whether arsenic induces EGFR and ERK phosphorylation in human uroepithelium, a specific target of arsenic carcinogenicity, and to determine whether this involves c-Src activation. We (15Simeonova P.P. Wang S. Toriuma W. Kommineni V. Matheson J. Unimye N. Kayama F. Harki D. Ding M. Vallyathan V. Luster M.I. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3445-3453PubMed Google Scholar) previously found that in vitro orin vivo arsenic exposure induced persistent AP-1 nuclear translocation and increased expression of genes associated with cell cycle regulation and uroepithelial cell proliferation. As we report here, similar conditions of arsenic exposure induced EGFR and ERK phosphorylation, and this response was dependent on c-Src activation. All chemicals including sodiumm-arsenite (referred to as arsenic) were from Sigma with the exception of PP-1 (4-amino-5-(4-methylphenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo{3,4-d}pyramidine)m, which was from Alexis Inc. (San Diego, CA), and recombinant human EGFα, which was from ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA). UROtsa, an SV40 immortalized human urothelium cell line, was obtained from Dr. G. Petzoldt, (University College, London). The cell line does not acquire the characteristics of transformed cells, including growth in soft agar or development of tumors in nude mice (16Petzoldt J.L. Leigh I.M. Duffy P.G. Sexton C. Masters J.R. Urol. Res. 1995; 23: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The cells were grown at 37 °C/5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 culture media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), referred to as complete media. Mouse epithelial cell lines B82 and B82 permanently transfected with human EGFR were a gift from Dr. Gordon N. Gill, University of California, and these cells were maintained as described previously (12Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1987; 328: 820-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). All cell treatments were performed at 37 °C in serum-free medium. After treatment, monolayers were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in RIPA buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 100 μmNaVO4, 1 mm NaF, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) for immunoprecipitation under non-denaturing conditions or RIPA/SDS buffer (RIPA buffer containing 0.1% SDS) for immunoprecipitation under denaturing conditions. Cell lysates were disrupted by repeated aspiration through a 21G needle and clarified by centrifugation. Immunoprecipitates were prepared from 1-ml aliquots of lysate by incubating with the appropriate primary antibody plus 20 μl of protein G plus agarose (Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA) for 2 h or overnight at 4 °C under slight agitation. Immune complexes were washed 4 times with ice-cold RIPA buffer, denatured in Laemmli sample buffer, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. EGFR was precipitated using monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody (clone LA1, Upstate Biotechnology; Lake Placid, NY) or in some experiments, using monoclonal anti-phospho-EGF receptor (Tyr1173, Upstate Biotechnology). Tyrosine phosphorylation or the presence of co-precipitated proteins was detected by immunoblotting. Phosphotyrosine was detected using a 1:1000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (PY20, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Total EGFR was detected using a 1:5000 dilution of a specific rabbit IgG antibody (Oncogene). Phosphorylated ERK and pp38 or total ERK and p38 were detected by Western blot analysis of cell lysates using specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) at a 1:1000 dilution. c-Src was detected using a 1:400 dilution of a specific rabbit IgG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The detection antibodies were either peroxidase-linked anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) used at a 1:10,000 dilution. Immune complexes were visualized on nitrocellulose by enzyme-linked enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and quantified by scanning laser densitometry. UROtsa cells (0.5 × 106) were seeded into 100-mm tissue culture dishes and incubated in culture media for 24 h. A mixture containing 4 μg of transfection-grade eukaryotic expression vector or Src cDNA mutated vector (Upstate Biotechnology), 20 μl of Plus® reagent, and 30 μl of LipofectAMINE® reagents (Invitrogen) was gently added to each culture and incubated at 37 °C at 5% CO2 for 3 h. The DNA-containing medium was replaced with fresh RPMI culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and the cells were cultured for an additional 48 h. Transfected monolayers were serum-starved in RPMI without serum for 16–20 h prior to stimulation. The transfection efficiency was measured by Western blot of c-Src expression. Src activity in UROtsa cells was measured according to the protocol of Feder and Bishop (17Feder D. Bishop J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8205-8211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) following serum starvation for 48 h and treatment with 50 μmarsenic or 10 ng/ml recombinant human EGFα. c-Src was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using anti-c-Src-specific antibodies (clone GD-1; Upstate Biotechnology). Enolase phosphorylation was detected by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis. Src activity was also measured using a specific Src substrate peptide included in a commercial kit (Upstate Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Female C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Portage, MI. All animals were housed at NIOSH National Institutes of Health facilities in compliance with AALAC-approved guidelines for the humane treatment of laboratory animals. Animals were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle and were provided chow and water ad libitum. Groups of 8-week-old mice were provided 50 μg/ml arsenic as sodium arsenite (Sigma) in their drinking water for 8 weeks and sacrificed by CO2asphyxia. The urinary bladders were collected under aseptic conditions. The tissue samples were homogenized in RIPA buffer. All experiments were replicated, and representative findings are shown. Statistical significance was determined by one-way analysis of variance. To determine whether arsenic activates EGFR in uroepithelium, UROtsa cells, a human immortalized, nontransformed urothelial cell line, were treated with 50 μm of arsenic, a concentration known to activate AP-1 (15Simeonova P.P. Wang S. Toriuma W. Kommineni V. Matheson J. Unimye N. Kayama F. Harki D. Ding M. Vallyathan V. Luster M.I. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3445-3453PubMed Google Scholar). Arsenic treatment induced EGFR phosphorylation in UROtsa cells as measured by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody of immunoprecipitated EGFR (Fig.1A). EGFR phosphorylation by arsenic occurred within 15 min with a peak response at 45 min. Ligand-induced autophosphorylation of EGFR causes the recruitment of adaptor proteins, such as Shc and GRB2, to the cytoplasmic domain of the EGFR. As shown on Fig. 1B, the treatment of UROtsa cells with either arsenic or EGF resulted in the association of Shc and GRB2 with EGFR, and consistent with the time course of EGFR phosphorylation, the complexes were minimally increased within 15 min and markedly increased within 45 min after arsenic treatment. In parallel with EGFR phosphorylation, EGF and arsenic stimulated ERK phosphorylation in UROtsa cells to similar levels (Fig. 1C). However, in contrast to EGF, arsenic-induced ERK activation was higher after 45 min as compared with 15 min (Fig. 1D). Arsenic induced EGFR and ERK activation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.1E). Thus, arsenic appears to increase the phosphorylation of EGFR, which is associated with the recruitment of adaptor proteins including GRB2 and Shc and activation of ERK kinase in UROtsa cells. Because arsenic has been shown to induce growth factors from the EGF family (18Germolec D.R. Spalding J. Yu H.S. Chen G.S. Simeonova P.P. Humble M.C. Bruccoleri A. Boorman G.A. Foley J.F. Yoshida T. Luster M.I. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 1775-1785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), it was necessary to determine whether arsenic-induced EGFR phosphorylation is associated with increased EGF levels. Preincubation of UROtsa cells with neutralizing antibodies to EGF did not affect arsenic-induced EGFR phosphorylation, whereas it completely prevented the phosphorylation induced by EGF (Fig.2A). Arsenic is a sulfhydryl-binding metalloid, and many of its effects are altered by glutathione depletion or by the addition of NAC (19Scott N. Hatlelid K.M. MacKenzie N.E. Carter D.E. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of UROtsa cells with NAC almost completely eliminated arsenic-induced EGFR phosphorylation but had no effect on EGF-induced responses (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the sulfhydryl binding properties of arsenic contribute to EGFR stimulation. In ligand-stimulated EGFR autophosphorylation, Tyr1173 is one of the specific major autophosphorylation sites (20Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar). To determine whether arsenic phosphorylates Tyr1173, UROtsa cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibody specific for Tyr1173and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig.2C). In contrast to EGF treatment, tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR by arsenic did not include Tyr1173. Therefore, these data demonstrate that arsenic and EGF activate EGFR through distinct mechanisms. c-Src, a member of the Src non-receptor kinase family, has been implicated in an alternate pathway for EGFR and ERK activation (13Tice D.A. Biscardi J.S. Nickles A.L. Parsons S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). To establish whether Src phosphotyrosine activity is involved in arsenic-induced activation of the EGFR, UROtsa cells were treated with PP-1, a selective Src kinase inhibitor (21Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). Arsenic-induced EGFR phosphorylation was completely abrogated by PP-1, whereas the response to EGF stimulation was not affected (Fig.3A). Additional experiments were also performed to analyze the phosphorylation of ERK upon Src kinase inhibition. PP-1 dose-dependently inhibited arsenic-induced ERK phosphorylation in UROtsa cells, showing 70% suppression at the highest concentration of PP-1 tested (Fig.3B). At similar concentrations, PP-1 had only a slight effect on EGF-induced ERK phosphorylation. PP-1 alone had no effect on ERK activation. These results suggested that a PP-1 sensitive kinase, such as Src, is a possible upstream mediator of arsenic-induced EGFR and ERK phosphorylation. The dominant-negative c-Src construct transfection allows for the expression of mutated c-Src kinase, which appears without phosphotyrosine activity in the presence of the normal binding activity of the adaptor proteins (22Barone M.V. Courtneidge S.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Consistent with the effect of PP-1, the transfection of the dominant-negative c-Src inhibited arsenic-induced EGFR phosphorylation and ERK activation when compared with cells transfected with the empty vector (Fig.4, A and B). The effect of the dominant-negative c-Src transfection was specific for ERK since at the same conditions, arsenic-induced p38 phosphorylation was not affected (Fig. 4C). Further, we examined the ability of arsenic to stimulate c-Src kinase activity. c-Src protein was immunoprecipitated from the lysates of UROtsa cells treated with arsenic or EGF using a specific antibody, and c-Src kinase activity was measured using in vitro phosphorylation assays. c-Src kinase activity, measured as enolase phosphorylation, was markedly elevated at 10 and 15 min following treatment with arsenic or EGF (Fig. 5A). The ability of arsenic to activate Src was confirmed by measuring the phosphorylation of Src-specific substrate peptide (Fig. 5B). Arsenic increased c-Src activity more than 2-fold in 10 min before returning to base-line levels at 30 min. There were no differences in c-Src protein expression observed between lysates obtained from control or stimulated cells as determined by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis with anti-c-Src antibody. Previously, we (15Simeonova P.P. Wang S. Toriuma W. Kommineni V. Matheson J. Unimye N. Kayama F. Harki D. Ding M. Vallyathan V. Luster M.I. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3445-3453PubMed Google Scholar) reported that exposure of mice to arsenic in drinking water for 8 weeks induces uroepithelial proliferation and persistent AP-1 activation. To evaluate the involvement of c-Src, EGFR, and ERK in these processes, total lysates were prepared under non-denaturating conditions from the bladders of mice exposed to the same treatment regimes, 50 μg/ml arsenic in drinking water for 8 weeks (Fig.6). Consistent with the in vitro data, exposure of mice to arsenic in the drinking water resulted in increased levels of phosphorylated ERK and EGFR in the bladder tissue. Samples were also immunoprecipitated with anti-EGFR and immunoblotted with anti-c-Src antibody to test for EGFR-c-Src interactions. Arsenic exposure induced an increase in c-Src, which co-immunoprecipitated with the EGFR at equal levels of total EGFR in bladder tissue. Thus, arsenic-induced AP-1 activation and epithelial mitogenic responses in urinary bladder tissue are accompanied by c-Src, EGFR, and ERK activation. To evaluate whether c-Src contributes to arsenic-induced ERK activation only as an integral part of the EGFR-ERK pathway, B82 cells that are deficient in EGFR (EGFR−) and B82 cells permanently transfected with human wild-type EGFR (EGFR+) were used. Although EGF induced ERK activation only in EGF+ B82 cells (data not shown), arsenic stimulated ERK in both EGF− and EGF+ B82 cells. Furthermore, the responses in both cell types were inhibited by PP-1 (Fig. 7). These data indicate that Src activity is also involved in arsenic-induced ERK phosphorylation in the absence of EGFR. Src can activate the ERK pathway either by phosphorylating EGFR or by phosphorylating molecules, such as Shc or FAK, creating binding sites for Grb2, both of which link to the MAPK pathway (13Tice D.A. Biscardi J.S. Nickles A.L. Parsons S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 23Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3821) Google Scholar). Arsenic exposure is associated with urinary bladder epithelium hyperplasia and a concomitant increased AP-1 activation (15Simeonova P.P. Wang S. Toriuma W. Kommineni V. Matheson J. Unimye N. Kayama F. Harki D. Ding M. Vallyathan V. Luster M.I. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3445-3453PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, cDNA microarray analysis of the arsenic-exposed human uroepithelial cell line, UROtsa, identified induced genes whose products are involved in cell cycle regulation and malignancies, such as early growth response gene (EGR)-1, growth arrest and DNA damage (GADD)153, GADD45, and repair-associated protein (RAD) (15Simeonova P.P. Wang S. Toriuma W. Kommineni V. Matheson J. Unimye N. Kayama F. Harki D. Ding M. Vallyathan V. Luster M.I. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3445-3453PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of genes involved in the regulation of cellular growth has been historically related to the effects of growth factors, such as EGF, and their abilities to induce a cascade of events, triggered by binding to the specific receptor and including the activation of receptor tyrosine kinases and phosphorylation of members of the MAPK family. Several studies have suggested that arsenic cellular effects involve MAPK activation (7Liu Y. Guyton K.Z. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Lee J.C. Holbrook N.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 8Cavigelli M. Li W.W. Lin A. Su B. Yoshioka K. Karin M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6269-6279Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 10Burleson F.G. Simeonova P.P. Germolec D.R. Luster M.I. Res. Commun. Mol. Pathol. Pharmacol. 1996; 93: 131-148PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the JB6 mouse epidermal cell line exposed to low doses of arsenic demonstrated ERK stimulation associated with cell transformation (24Huang C. Ma W.Y. Li J. Goranson A. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14595-14601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). ERK subtypes, members of the MAPK family, are recognized as key transducers in the signaling cascade mediating the expression of cell growth-related genes (25Su B. Karin M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Further, a study conducted with PC12 cells, used commonly to explore MAPK activation, has demonstrated that arsenite treatment activates ERK in the EGFR-dependent pathway, and the interaction of arsenic with EGFR vicinal thiols has been supposed as a trigger mechanism in this event (9Chen W. Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. Liu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5178-5188Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Arsenic might activate the EGFR-ERK pathway to induce gene expression and mitogenicity in urinary bladder epithelium. EGFR has been extensively studied as an integral part of human urinary bladder carcinogenesis (26Thogersen V.B. Jorgensen P.E. Sorensen B.S. Bross P. Orntoft T. Wolf H. Nexo E. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1999; 59: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the present study, arsenic was found to induce ligand-independent EGFR phosphorylation and activation in UROtsa cells; however, this response differed from the ligand-induced response in several ways. First, monoclonal antibody, specific for one of the major autophosphorylation sites of EGFR (Tyr1173), discriminated between EGF- and arsenic-induced EGF receptor phosphorylation. Secondly, the ability of arsenic to phosphorylate EGFR and activate ERK was slightly but consistently delayed when compared with the endogenous ligand. Thirdly, inhibition of Src by PP-1 or transfection with a dominant-negative c-Src construct prevented arsenic-induced but not EGF-induced EGFR or ERK phosphorylation in the uroepithelial cell line. EGF stimulates an intrinsic receptor tyrosine kinase activity, which results in tyrosine autophosphorylation of the receptor including the Tyr1173 site (20Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of EGFR through inhibition of tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors, such as sodium orthovanadate, also reflects the activation of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase (27Luttrell L.M. Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4637-4644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The involvement of receptor tyrosine kinases by arsenic in UROtsa cells is not likely since the Tyr1173 site was not phosphorylated. Additionally, cellular non-receptor kinases, such as c-Src or JAK2, have been demonstrated to phosphorylate EGFR (11Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). For example, c-Src has been implicated in oxidative stress or lysophosphatidic acid-induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation (28Vacaresse N. Lajoie-Mazenc I. Auge N. Suc I. Frisach M.F. Salvayre R. Negre-Salvayre A. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 892-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). c-Src can physically associate with EGFR, resulting in two unique tyrosine phosphorylations of the receptor (Tyr845, Tyr1101), which are distinct from the autophosphorylation sites (13Tice D.A. Biscardi J.S. Nickles A.L. Parsons S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 29Biscardi J.S. Maa M.C. Tice D.A. Cox M.E. Leu T.H. Parsons S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8335-8343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). The results of the present study indicate that c-Src activity is necessary for arsenic-induced EGFR and ERK activation and that these pathways occur in mouse urinary bladder after arsenic exposure. Alternatively, arsenic can stimulate ERK activation trough Src, at least in the B82 cells, in the absence of EGFR. It has been demonstrated that Src can activate the ERK pathway by phosphorylating molecules, such as Shc or FAK, creating binding sites for Grb2 (13Tice D.A. Biscardi J.S. Nickles A.L. Parsons S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar,23Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3821) Google Scholar). Taken together, and as summarized in Fig.8, these data suggest an important role for c-Src in the arsenic-induced signaling of ERK activation and related gene expression. In addition to ERK activation, c-Src can be responsible for the tyrosine phosphorylation of numerous actin-binding proteins, such as cortactin, and can impact the cortical actin assembly (30Weed S.A. Parsons J.T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6418-6434Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The c-Src-dependent mechanisms of cytoskeleton reorganization also might contribute to arsenic-induced pathophysiological processes. Several lines of evidence have demonstrated that c-Src is associated with the inner cell membrane, particularly in the vicinity of growth factor or integrin clusters (31Bjorge J.D. Jakymiw A. Fujita D.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5620-5635Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). c-Src activation involves phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events that can be triggered by diverse stimulants, including growth factors, integrins, or confirmational changes from disulfide bond interactions, which result in the aggregation of c-Src molecules (31Bjorge J.D. Jakymiw A. Fujita D.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5620-5635Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Recently, the latter paradigm has been shown to occur by nitric oxide (32Akhand A.A. Pu M. Senga T. Kato M. Suzuki H. Miyata T. Hamaguchi M. Nakashima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25821-25826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Arsenic may persuade some of these mechanisms via its reactivity to vicinal sulfhydryl groups. Macromolecules, such as EGFR, integrins, c-Src, or protein phosphatases, contain high numbers of vicinal sulfhydryls and are capable of reacting with arsenic. Alternatively, inorganic arsenic may accumulate in the extracellular matrix bound to keratin or other sulfhydryl-containing molecules in skin or urinary bladder tissue, resulting in cellular integrin rearrangements and c-Src activation. In this respect, we recently demonstrated that inorganic arsenic accumulates in the bladder epithelium following oral exposure (15Simeonova P.P. Wang S. Toriuma W. Kommineni V. Matheson J. Unimye N. Kayama F. Harki D. Ding M. Vallyathan V. Luster M.I. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3445-3453PubMed Google Scholar, 33Simeonova P.P. Wang S. Kashon M.L. Kommineni C. Crecelius E. Luster M.I. Toxicol. Sci. 2001; 60: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although it is likely that arsenic and other environmental stressors can act like classical tumor promoters and growth factors, identification of unique events in the signal cascades may help provide targets for specific therapeutic or prevention interventions in chemical carcinogenesis."

The K(m) value for malonyl-CoA and the k(cat) value for THN synthesis were determined to be 0.93 +/- 0.1 microm and 0.77 +/- 0.04 min(-1), respectively. RppA accepted aliphatic acyl-CoAs with the carbon lengths from C(4) to C(8) as starter substrates and catalyzed sequential condensation of malonyl-CoA to yield alpha-pyrones and phloroglucinols. In addition, RppA yielded a hexaketide, 4-hydroxy-6-(2',4',6'-trioxotridecyl)-2-pyrone, from octanoyl-CoA and five molecules of malonyl-CoA, suggesting that the size of the active site cavity of RppA is larger than any other chalcone synthase-related enzymes found so far in plants and bacteria. RppA was also found to synthesize a C-methylated pyrone, 3,6-dimethyl-4-hydroxy-2-pyrone, by using acetoacetyl-CoA as the starter and methylmalonyl-CoA as an extender. Thus, the broad substrate specificity of RppA yields a wide variety of products."

Crystallographic studies have identified three Pk trisaccharide (Pk-glycoside) binding sites per verotoxin 1B subunit (VT1B) monomer while NMR studies have identified binding of Pk-glycoside only at site 2. To understand the basis for this difference, we studied binding of wild type VT1B and VT1B mutants, defective at one or more of the three sites, to Pk-glycoside and pentavalent Pk trisaccharide (pentaSTARFISH) in solution and Gb3 presented on liposomal membranes using surface plasmon resonance. Site 2 was the key site in terms of free trisaccharide binding since mutants altered at sites 1 and 3 bound this ligand with wild type affinity. However, effective binding of the pentaSTARFISH molecule also required a functional site 3, suggesting that site 3 promotes pentavalent binding of linked trisaccharides at site 1 and site 2. Optimal binding to membrane-associated Gb3 involved all three sites. Binding of all single site mutants to liposomal Gb3 was weaker than wild type VT1B binding. Site 3 mutants behaved as if they had reduced ability to enter into high avidity interactions with Gb3 in the membrane context. Double mutants at site 1/site 3 and site 2/site 3 were completely inactive in terms of binding to liposomal Gb3, even though the site 1/site 3 mutant bound trisaccharide with almost wild type affinity. Thus site 2 alone is not sufficient to confer high avidity binding to membrane-localized Gb3. Cytotoxic activity paralleled membrane glycolipid binding. Our data show that the interaction of verotoxin with the Gb3 trisaccharide is highly context dependent and that a membrane environment is required for biologically relevant studies of the interaction.

Our data show that the interaction of verotoxin with the Gb3 trisaccharide is highly context dependent and that a membrane environment is required for biologically relevant studies of the interaction. Verotoxins produced by Escherichia coli have been associated with diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, and the hemolytic uremic syndrome in humans (1Riley L. Remis R. Helgerson S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1983; 308: 681-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar, 2Karmali M.A. Petric M. Lim C. Cheung R. Arbus G. J. Infect. Dis. 1985; 151: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). There is evidence that verotoxins play a central role in the pathogenesis of these diseases, causing microvascular damage by direct toxicity to endothelial cells. Verotoxins consist of an enzymatic A subunit (32 kDa) that is noncovalently associated with a homopentameric receptor-binding B subunit (37.5 kDa). After holotoxin internalization by the cell, the A subunit causes catalytic inactivation of the 28 S ribosomal RNA, disrupting protein synthesis and inducing apoptosis (3Endo Y. Tsurugi K. Yutsudo T. Takeda Y. Ogasavara T. Igarashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 4Mangeney M. Lingwood C.A. Taga S. Caillou B. Tursz T. Wiels J.

The B subunit oligomer is responsible for toxin binding to the carbohydrate portion of the specific cell-surface glycolipid receptor and it has been shown that the susceptibility to VT1 toxin is correlated with Gb3 1The abbreviations used are:Gb3globotriaosylceramide (Galα(1–4)Galβ(1–4)Glcβ-Cer)RUresponse unitPk trisaccharide[Galα(1–4)Galβ(1–4)Glcβ]Pk-glycosidethe trimethylsiylethyl derivative of the Pk trisaccharideSPRsurface plasmon resonanceTLCthin-layer chromatographyVT1verotoxin-1, VT1B, the pentameric B subunit of verotoxin 1 receptor presence on the cell surface (6Weinstein D.L.

In the absence of the A subunit, B subunit monomers form pentamers that are fully functional in terms of binding to Gb3 (7Donohue-Rolfe A. Jacewicz M. Keusch G.T. Mol.

Brunton J.L. Read R.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 748-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and in complex with a Pk trisaccharide receptor analogue (9Ling H. Boodhoo A. Hazes B. Cummings M.D. Armstrong G.D. Brunton J.L. Read R.J.

Site 1, located at the cleft between adjacent B subunits, is characterized by a hydrophobic stacking interaction of the Phe-30 phenyl ring with Galβ of the receptor and by hydrogen bonds involving Asp-17, Thr-21, Glu-28, and Gly-60. Site 2 is located on the opposite side of the phenyl ring of Phe-30 in a crevice defined by Gly-62, Asn-32, Arg-33, Asp-16, and Ala-56. Interaction with receptor oligosaccharide at this site primarily involves hydrogen bonds. The third binding site involves hydrophobic stacking interaction of Galβ against the indole ring of Trp-34 and a hydrophobic interaction between Galα and Trp-34 of an adjacent monomer. In addition, Galα hydrogen bonds to Trp-34 and Asn-35 as well as Asp-18 from an adjacent monomer. The solution structure of VT1 in the absence (10Richardson J.M. Evans P.D. Homans S.W.

Donohue-Rolfe A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13153-13156Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) has been determined by isotope assisted NMR techniques. At equimolar concentrations of Pk trisaccharide and B subunit monomer, only site 2 was significantly occupied with the receptor analogue. Detection of VT1B·Pk-glycoside complexes by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry confirmed and extended the NMR data (13Kitova E.N. Kitov P.I. Bundle D.R. Klassen J.S. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). By observing VT1B·Pktrisaccharide complexes for increasing ratios of oligosaccharide to VT1B the distribution of bound species could be studied. globotriaosylceramide (Galα(1–4)Galβ(1–4)Glcβ-Cer) response unit [Galα(1–4)Galβ(1–4)Glcβ] the trimethylsiylethyl derivative of the Pk trisaccharide surface plasmon resonance thin-layer chromatography verotoxin-1, VT1B, the pentameric B subunit of verotoxin 1 With the B subunits associating into a pentameric doughnut-shaped structure and each monomer exhibiting three binding sites, the VT1 molecule contains a total of 15 saccharide-binding sites aligned on one face. The interaction of the B-subunit pentamer with Pk-glycoside is not very strong (K d in a millimolar range) and the efficient binding of the B pentamer to membrane glycolipid is due to multivalent interaction. A decavalent model receptor-inhibitor molecule STARFISH was described recently and shown to have an in vitro inhibitory activity 1–10 million-fold higher than univalent ligands (14Kitov P.I. Sadowska J.M. Mulvey G. Armstrong G.D. Ling H. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Bundle D.R. Nature. 2000; 403: 669-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). It is by far the highest molar activity of any inhibitor yet reported for VT1 and VT2. Since decavalent STARFISH was shown to interact simultaneously with two B subunit pentamers (14Kitov P.I. Sadowska J.M. Mulvey G. Armstrong G.D. Ling H. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Bundle D.R. Nature. 2000; 403: 669-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar), we synthesized a new but related, pentavalent STARFISH (pentaSTARFISH) molecule (Fig. 1 C). PentaSTARFISH is built from five Pk-glycosides substituted by a tether atO-2 of the central galactose residue attaching each Pk unit to the central glucose core, resulting in a five-ray cluster of Pk units. We previously reported data on the binding of VT1B subunit mutants designed to specifically inactivate individual sites. All three sites identified by crystallography appeared to be biologically relevant and blockage of sites 1 and 2 resulted in the most significant reduction of binding and cytotoxicity (15Bast D.J. Banerjee L. Clark C. Read R.J. Brunton J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To better define the biological significance of the three binding sites, we constructed additional mutants, including double site mutants designed to elucidate the function of individual sites. The interaction of mutated B subunits with monovalent and pentavalent forms of the carbohydrate portion of Gb3, the Pk trisaccharide, was analyzed in real time by surface plasmon resonance. The effect of these mutations on B pentamer binding to membrane receptor was monitored by SPR using a liposome capture technique (16MacKenzie C.R. Hirama T. Lee K.K. Altman E. Young N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5533-5538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In this technique glycolipid receptor is incorporated into artificial liposomes that also contain a small amount of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), allowing the capture of these liposomes on SPR sensor chip surfaces via an immobilized anti-LPS monoclonal antibody. This method provides a better approach to the study of protein-glycolipid interactions than conventional microtiter plate or TLC overlay methods because it better mimics the membrane environment. In addition, the cytotoxic activity and intracellular routing of the corresponding mutant holotoxins were correlated with cell surface binding as determined by flow cytometry.

Mutant holotoxin expression plasmids were made by subcloning the AccI 439-bp restriction fragment carrying each of the B subunit mutations into the wild type toxin expression vector pJLB128 (23Ramotar K. Boyd B. Tyrell G. Gariepy J. Lingwood C.A Brunton J. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The presence of the mutations was confirmed by double strand sequencing using the Sequenase 2.0 sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Wild type and mutant B pentamers and holotoxins were expressed and purified (24Petric M. Karmali M.A. Richardson S.E. Cheung R. FEMS Microbiol.

Microbiol. 1996; 19: 891-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). All of the mutant B pentamers and holotoxins were characterized by denaturing and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to confirm protein integrity. The structural integrity of mutant B pentamer and holotoxin molecules was confirmed by demonstration of reactivity with a panel of monoclonal antibodies specific for B pentamer epitopes (19Kihlberg J. Hultgren S.J. Normark S. Magnusson G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 6364-6368Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that the mutant B subunits were capable of pentamerization, subunit cross-linking was performed using dimethyl suberimidate (26Davies G. Stark G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 66: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Swiss PDB Viewer OpenGL 3.51, obtained from the ExPaSy Internet page (www.expasy.ch), was applied to model VT1B subunit mutants. The crystal structure of VT1 B subunit from Protein Data Bank file (1bov) was used (www.rcsb.org/pdb). Analyses were performed using a BIACORE 1000 and 3000 biosensor systems (27Jönsson U. Fägerstam L. Ivarsson B. Johnsson B. Karlsson R. Lundh K. Löfås S. Persson B. Roos H. Rönnberg I. Sjölander S. Stenberg E. Ståhlberg R. Urbaniczky C. Östlin H. Malmqvist M. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 620-627PubMed Google Scholar). Varying amounts of Gb3 were incorporated into liposomes that also contained dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine and Salmonella serogroup B LPS. A monoclonal antibody specific for theSalmonella LPS and immobilized on research grade CM5 sensor chips (Biacore, Inc.) served as a capture molecule for the liposomes (16MacKenzie C.R. Hirama T. Lee K.K. Altman E. Young N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5533-5538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The antibody-LPS interaction retained the liposomes on sensor chips with no detectable dissociation, thereby providing a stable surface for VT1B binding. Following the capture of ∼1000 RUs of liposomes, holotoxin, or B pentamer were injected over the liposome surfaces. Reference surfaces were prepared using liposomes containing only dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine and LPS. All analyses were carried out in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl and 3.4 mm EDTA, at 25 °C and a flow rate of 10 μl/min. The antibody surfaces were regenerated with sequential 3-s injections of 1 and 4 mm sodium taurodeoxycholate in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5. For the measurement of Pk-glycoside and pentaSTARFISH binding to VT1B, wild type and mutant toxins were immobilized on CM5 sensor chips by amine coupling at pH 4.5 to give surface densities of ∼4000 RUs. Analyses were performed in the above buffer at 25 °C and a flow rate of 40 μl/min. The triple site mutant, F30A/G62T/W34A, was used as a reference surface. Surface regeneration was not necessary. Data were evaluated using the BIAevaluation 3.0 software (Biacore, Inc.). Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) overlay assays were performed as described earlier (28Lingwood C.A. Law H. Richardson S.

Toxin binding was detected with antibody PH1. African green monkey kidney Vero 76 cells and human Burkitt's lymphoma Daudi cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. Human monocyte THP1 cells were provided by Dr. O. Rotstein, University of Toronto. The cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 0.1% glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (CanSera). FITC labeling of VT1B pentamers was performed as earlier described (29Khine A.A. Lingwood C.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 161: 319-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The efficiency of FITC incorporation into individual mutants was very similar in all instances as judged from the fluorescence intensity of serially diluted samples run on polyacrylamide gels. Toxin binding to Vero cells was quantitated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Vero cells were trypsinized and washed with complete medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Approximately 106 cells were incubated in medium containing 10 μg/ml FITC-labeled mutant B subunit at 4 °C for 1 h. Cells were washed by pelleting and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mm EDTA and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde prior to fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Mutant toxin binding was expressed as a percent of wild type toxin binding. Trendlines and standard errors were calculated using Microsoft Excel. The toxicity of purified wild type and mutant holotoxins was determined as previously described (15Bast D.J. Banerjee L. Clark C. Read R.J. Brunton J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For imunocytochemistry, wild type and mutant VT1B subunits were conjugated with Texas Red-X or Oregon Green 488, respectively, using FluoroReporter Labeling Kits (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturers protocol. The efficiency of fluorescence incorporation into individual mutants was very similar as judged from the fluorescence intensity of serially diluted samples run on polyacrylamide gels and by spectroscopy. To compensate for much lower binding of mutant toxins and to obtain similar intensities of fluorescence from mutant and wild type toxin during internalization, we used higher molar ratio of dye to protein (MR) for Oregon Green 488 (RM = 20) than for Texas Red labeling (RM = 5). To determine the relationship between toxin binding and cytotoxicity, the data were log transformed and general linear models were created using SAS and Splus, using data for the A56Y, D17E, F30A, and G62A mutants. Standard deviations were calculated using Microsoft Excel. Internalization of fluorescent VT1B subunits in Vero cells was done as described earlier (30Schapiro F.B. Lingwood C.A. Furuya W. Grinstein S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C319-C332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of samples was performed using the ×100 objective of an Olympus 1X-70 inverted microscope equipped with fluorescence optics and Deltavision Deconvolution Microscopy software (Applied Precision). Digital images were processed in Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems). The series of mutants designed to selectively eliminate ligand binding at sites 1, 2, 3, or combinations thereof is described in TableI. Two site 1 mutants (D17E and F30A), one site 2 mutant (G62T), and one site 3 mutant (W34A) were previously described and studied for Gb3 binding (in a lipid milieu in microtiter plates) and cytotoxicity (15Bast D.J. Banerjee L. Clark C. Read R.J. Brunton J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 25Clark C. Bast D. Sharp A.M., St. Hilaire P. Agha R. Stein P.E. Toone E.J. Read R.J. Brunton J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 891-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). As part of the present study, several additional mutants were made in an effort to further clarify the biological significance of the three Gb3-binding sites. Attention was turned to improving the specificity of mutants designed to block binding at site 2. The previously reported substitution G62T, designed to sterically block site 2, was shown to cause a shift of the Phe-30 phenyl ring into site 1, the magnitude of which was dependent on the conformation of the threonine side chain. This suggested that binding at both sites 1 and 2 might be affected (15Bast D.J. Banerjee L. Clark C. Read R.J. Brunton J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The mutant G62A was produced to eliminate binding at site 2 while having less effect on site 1. Modeling, however, suggested that the presence of a β-carbon at residue 62 would still have a small effect on the phenyl ring of Phe-30, a key residue of site 1 3R. J. Read, unpublished observations. (15Bast D.J. Banerjee L. Clark C. Read R.J. Brunton J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Because of the proximity of key residues involved in sites 1 and 2, we produced another mutant altered at a location more distant from site 1. The substitution A56Y was chosen since the methyl group of Ala-56 had previously been shown to interact with the trisaccharide bound at site 2 (9Ling H. Boodhoo A. Hazes B.

Similarly, mutants G62T/W34A and A56Y/W34A were intended to disrupt sites 2 and 3 while leaving site 1 intact although, as noted above, site 1 is affected by the G62T mutation. Mutant F30A/G62T was designed to simultaneously disrupt site 1 and site 2, leaving only site 3 functional, while the triple mutant F30A/G62T/W34A was expected to eliminate binding completely.Table ISite-directed VT1 mutants and their cytotoxicityMutation(s)Affected site(s)1-aSites are designated according to Ling et al.

Open table in a new tab The immunoreactivities of purified mutant and wild type B subunits were compared using a panel of monoclonal antibodies (PH1, 13C4, 16E6, and 19G8) that recognize conformational epitopes on VT1B. All the mutant and wild type B subunits reacted equally well with PH1 and 13C4 monoclonal antibodies. The 16E6 antibody exhibited less efficient recognition of all the W34A mutants (W34A, D17E/W34A, and F30A/W34A) relative to the wild type, while reacting normally with mutants D17E and F30A. The 19G8 antibody bound all the B pentamers equally well except for the G62T mutants. Since x-ray crystallography of the W34A and G62T mutant B pentamers showed normal protein folding (38Sharp A. Structural Studies of Active Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 and Shiga-like Toxin-1.Ph.D. thesis. University of Alberta, Alberta, Canada2000Google Scholar), we concluded that the lower reactivity of these mutants toward 16E6 and 19G8, respectively, was indicative of contributions by Trp-34 and Gly-62 to the epitopes recognized by these antibodies and not of improper folding. SDS-PAGE analysis of dimethyl suberimidate cross-linked products of all mutant B subunits yielded results identical to the wild type, indicating that the mutations did not alter B subunit pentamer formation (data not shown). Only mutants with an intact site 2 were capable of binding Pk-glycoside at levels that were detectable (TableII). Despite the low affinity of the monovalent interaction, sufficient levels of binding were obtained for the determination of K D values by Scatchard analysis (Fig. 2, A and B). With a K D of ∼5 mm, the monovalent binding of Pk-glycoside was 5 × 107 times weaker that the multivalent binding of wild type toxin to liposomal Gb3 (see below). The Pk-glycoside data also indicated that site 2 was completely unaffected by the W34A mutation at site 3 and only very slightly affected by the D17E at site 1, while there was a greater reduction in site 2 binding with F30A substitution at site 1.Table IIAffinities of the binding of Pk-glycoside and pentavalent STARFISH to wild type and mutant VT1BsMutation(s)Site(s)2-aSites are designated according to Ling et al.

In mammalian species, endoproteolytic activation of many secretory protein precursors is carried out by the SPCs1 (for a review see Ref.1Bergeron F. Leduc R. Day R. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 24: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The catalytic domains of the SPCs have a high structural similarity to the bacterial subtilisins and yeast kexin (2Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). The SPC family of enzymes consists of seven distinct members named, using the unified nomenclature of Chan et al. (3Chan S.J. Oliva Jr., A.A. LaMendola J. Grens A. Bode H. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Each SPC contains at least five well conserved domains: 1) an N-terminal signal peptide, responsible for directing proteins into the secretory pathway; 2) a prodomain acting as a putative intramolecular chaperone for facilitated transportation, folding, and regulation of enzymatic activity (4Creemers J.W.

Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 28-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar).The substrate cleavage specificity of SPCs is recognized to be C-terminal to either single or paired basic residues, with the Lys-Arg motif being the most common. The substrate specificity of SPC1 has been thoroughly studied, with a minimal recognition sequence for catalysis being RXXR. In general, it is evident that SPCs favor the presence of basic residues at subsites P1, P2, and, in many cases, P4 for efficient catalysis. The presence of an Arg residue at P4 is not mandatory for the activity of all SPCs but various studies indicate that the presence of an Arg residue in P2, P4, or even P6 enhances cleavage. The apparent close similarity of cleavage specificity between SPCs leads to the notion of possible redundant processing functions. Indeed, different SPCs have been shown to process various precursors at the same cleavage sites. Extensive mapping studies have demonstrated the frequent occurrence of overlapping cellular SPC expression patterns (12Day R. Schafer M.K. Watson S.J. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. Mol.

However, the use of SPC inhibitors as pharmacological agents is highly dependent on a clear understanding of their redundant/distinct functions. Furthermore, the development of highly potent and specific SPC inhibitors requires a better knowledge of the molecular determinants of catalytic activity that distinguish each member of the SPC family.Endogenous inhibitors are often a good starting point in the development of pharmacological compounds. With regards to the SPCs, 7B2 CT (7B2 C-terminal) peptide and proSAAS are the only two endogenous inhibitors identified (30Martens G.J. Braks J.A. Eib D.W. Zhou Y. Lindberg I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5784-5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 31Fricker L.D. McKinzie A.A. Sun J. Curran E. Qian Y. Yan L. Patterson S.D. Courchesne P.L. Richards B. Levin N. Mzhavia N. Devi L.A. Douglass J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 639-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as they specifically inhibit SPC2 and SPC3, respectively. However, regulation of enzymatic activity can also be carried out by intramolecular mechanisms. Indeed, SPCs, like many other proteinases, are synthesized as zymogens (32Leduc R. Molloy S.S. Thorne B.A. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14304-14308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibitory mechanism often involves the presence of a prodomain, whose function is to prevent premature enzymatic activity (6Anderson E.D. VanSlyke J.K. Thulin C.D. Jean F. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1508-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Each SPC contains a distinct prodomain that acts in cis to regulate that enzyme's activity. Based on the fact that SPC prodomains exhibit low levels of overall homology to each other, it has been suggested that they could be used in trans as potent and specific inhibitors of their cognate enzymes (33Zhong M. Munzer J.S. Basak A. Benjannet S. Mowla S.J. Decroly E. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33913-33920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Some evidence in support of the high inhibitory potency of prodomains has been provided. However, their degree of specificity remains somewhat unclear. The present study is an extensive comparative analysis of the inhibitory characteristics of SPC prodomains to address the issue of specificity. Our studies reveal that prodomains are potent inhibitors of SPCs in the low nanomolar range, that inhibition is highly dependent on the C-terminal structure of each prodomain, but also that some N-terminal elements within the prodomains are required for maximal inhibition. However, our results show that prodomains are not highly specific inhibitors of their cognate SPCs and that further structural modifications will be required to achieve higher levels of specificity.DISCUSSIONPrevious studies have established the ability of prodomains to act as intramolecular chaperones that are essential for the correct folding of their parent enzyme (43Shinde U. Li Y. Chatterjee S. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6924-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For a number of peptidyl hydrolases including serine proteases, the prosegment has also been shown to be a potent inhibitor for its associated protease (4Creemers J.W. Vey M. Schafer W. Ayoubi T.A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 31574-31580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Some well studied prosegments include those of the bacterial subtilases, such as subtilisin E (43Shinde U. Li Y. Chatterjee S. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6924-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 44Power S.D. Adams R.M. Wells J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3096-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These studies have demonstrated the high inhibitory potency of the prosegment. Thus, prodomains can also serve as a key component of the proteolytic machinery to regulate the intracellular processing of precursors. These observations have led to the proposal that prosegments could potentially be used in a strategy to regulate the enzymatic activity. As a strategy to develop potent inhibitors used in trans, prodomain sequences could be useful to develop lead compounds or molecular tools that can help in the study of SPC function.Alignment of the SPC prodomain regions shows low levels of overall homology, but the most conserved region is found in their C-terminals (Fig. 3). Initial studies using the prosegment of SPC1, have demonstrated a potent inhibition for SPC1 (K i ∼ 14 nm) when tested in vitro (6Anderson E.D. VanSlyke J.K. Thulin C.D. Jean F. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1508-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Others have also shown the potent inhibitory effect of the prosegment of SPC3 on SPC3 as well as on SPC1 (7Boudreault A.

These observations thus raised the question as to the specificity of each prosegment when used as an inhibitor in trans. In a preliminary attempt to address this issue, the prodomains of SPC1 and SPC7 as well as peptide fragments thereof were tested on concentrated media from cells infected with recombinant SPC vaccinia virus (33Zhong M. Munzer J.S. Basak A. Benjannet S. Mowla S.J. Decroly E. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33913-33920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This study concluded that SPC prosegments were indeed potent, but also specific inhibitors when used in trans. The sum of these data imply that each prodomain would in fact be a highly specific inhibitor of its cognate enzyme. In light of the implication of these observations, we carried out a detailed comparative analysis of at least six of the seven prodomains on three distinct highly purified enzyme preparations.Since the C-terminal of the prodomain is essential for enzymatic inhibition (6Anderson E.D. VanSlyke J.K. Thulin C.D. Jean F. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1508-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 7Boudreault A. Gauthier D. Lazure C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31574-31580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 38Cadene M. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 5655-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), we prepared seven short C-terminal propeptides (i.e. 12 aa) for initial experiments. These peptides proved to retain a high inhibitory potency when tested against their cognate enzyme (Table IV). For example, hSPC1-S inhibited hSPC1Δ with aK i of 184 nm, hSPC6-S inhibited hSPC6A with a K i of 23 nm and hSPC7-S inhibited hSPC7Δ with a K i of 69 nm. However, these propeptides were also potent inhibitors of the other SPC enzymes as well. For example, the hSPC1-S propeptide was a more potent inhibitor of hSPC6A (K i ∼27 nm) than of hSPC1Δ (K i ∼184 nm) itself. Furthermore, hSPC1-S, hSPC4-S, mSPC5-S, and hSPC6-S were also equipotent inhibitors of hSPC1Δ (K i values ranging from 123–184 nm) as well as of hSPC6A (K i values ranging from 12–27 nm). In contrast hSPC2-S and mSPC3-S (derived from the neuroendocrine cell-specific hSPC2 and mSPC3) were very poor inhibitors withK i values greater than 1 μm. The reason for this lack of inhibitory potency may be due to the lack of basic residues at the P5 or P6 positions (Fig.3). In general, these data suggest that the short propeptides are not very specific SPC inhibitors.There are several reasons that explain the lack of inhibitory specificity of each short propeptide. Some of the molecular determinants may be absent in the chosen sequences. In fact, some specificity could potentially be found in the P′ positions of the prodomain primary cleavage site (Fig. 3). We therefore conducted a similar analysis on our three enzyme preparations using long propeptides (L) extended at the C-terminal. Even though the long propeptides have six amino acids in the P′ position as compared with the short propeptides, identical results were obtained, both in terms of potency and specificity (Table IV). Thus, our results suggest that the amino acids in the P′ positions do not contribute to the potency and specificity of inhibition of SPCs. However, it is noted that since these extended propeptides are equipotent to the short propeptides, they could in fact be useful in strategies in which such inhibitors are used ex vivo or in vivo. The amino acids in the P′ positions would thus serve to protect the peptide from carboxypeptidases that would remove the critical C-terminal basic residues required for SPC inhibition. Indeed, our assays using the short propeptides were all conducted in vitro, without the presence of contaminating carboxypeptidases. The addition of carboxypeptidase E or carboxypeptidase B to our assays resulted in a completely abolished inhibition of the short propeptides (data not shown). This is consistent with previous reports showing that substitution of the C-terminal basic amino acids results in a complete loss of inhibitory potency by the prodomains (33Zhong M. Munzer J.S.

Fortenberry Y. Apletalina E.V. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39213-39222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).The lack of specificity of our short propeptides could also be due to the absence of an extended N-terminal sequence. We therefore tested six different complete prodomains on the three enzyme preparations. Our results demonstrate that complete prodomains are highly potent inhibitors, with K i values often in the low nanomolar range (0.1–25 nm). However, no significant improvement in specificity was observed as compared with the short prodomain peptides (Fig. 7). Our data indicate that inhibitory specificity is not determined by the N-terminal region of the prodomains. However, in comparison to the short propeptides, complete prodomains were more potent inhibitors, sometimes 100-fold better. Two possible reasons could explain the higher potency of the complete prodomains. First, the short prodomain peptides (i.e. only 12 amino acids) adopt a random coil structure (analysis by NMR, data not shown), and thus addition of the N-terminal region may add structure and conformation to the polypeptide to provide a better fit at the enzyme subsites (i.e. improves affinity, but not necessarily specificity). In support of this we have shown by CD analysis that most of the prodomains, except for hSPC2 prodomain, do have extensive secondary structure (Fig. 8). Furthermore, the recent studies on the stability and global fold of the mSPC3 prodomain (1Bergeron F. Leduc R. Day R. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 24: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar,27Bennett B.D. Denis P. Haniu M. Teplow D.B. Kahn S. Louis J.C. Citron M. Vassar R. J. Biol.

A. 2000; 97: 2864-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) suggested that an N-terminal β-strand can stabilize the C-terminal region into a β-strand through the formation of a β-sheet. Secondly, secondary binding sites could be present in the N-terminal region of the prodomains. These sites may produce allosteric interactions that could improve the affinity of the interaction of the C-terminal region within the catalytic pocket. Alternatively, a portion of the N-terminal extension could be involved in binding to an exosite that provides additional interactions. Indeed, the determined experimental structure of the bacterial prodomain in complex with the subtilisin BPN′ shows interactions between the β-sheet of the prodomain and two helices near the catalytic domain (46Bryan P. Wang L. Hoskins J. Ruvinov S. Strausberg S. Alexander P. Almog O. Gilliland G. Gallagher T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10310-10318Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 47Ruan B. Hoskins J. Bryan P.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8562-8571Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In sum, the present data do not permit us to distinguish between these different possibilities; however, we can state that specificity was not improved by the addition of the N-terminal extension of the prodomains.The sum of our results indicates that the C-terminal region contains the primary information necessary to produce potent inhibition of SPCs. We therefore conducted an Ala-scan experiment of two of the short propeptides, hSPC1-S and hSPC7-S, in an attempt to delineate the molecular determinants important for their action, other than the essential C-terminal basic residues. We chose to study these two peptides since they showed a significant difference in specificity when comparing their actions on hSPC1Δ and hSPC7Δ. Ala-substitutions of the hSPC1-S propeptide revealed that the basic residues in the P4 (Ala-9), P5 (Ala-8), or P6(Ala-7) positions are critical to inhibit hSPC1Δ. These data are in good agreement with recent data showing that polyarginine peptides are very potent inhibitors of mSPC1 (41Cameron A. Appel J. Houghten R.A. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36741-36749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Indeed the C-terminal hSPC1 prodomain contains five basic residues out of six in the P1–P6 positions. Ala-substitutions of the hSPC7-S propeptide also revealed that the basic residues in the P4 (Ala-9) and P5 (Ala-8) positions were very important. However, we also noted that the hydrophobic residues (Leu) in the P6 (Ala-7) and P7 (Ala-6) positions had a significant effect on the inhibitory potency for hSPC7Δ. These two hydrophobic residues most likely provide a certain degree of specificity between the hSPC1-S and hSPC7-S propeptides for the two parent enzymes. Further support for the importance of hydrophobic residues at the P6 or P7 positions is provided by our data showing that the short propeptide mSPC5-S is the second best inhibitor of hSPC7Δ (Fig. 5 C). In contrast to the other short propeptides, the mSPC5-S short propeptide has a Leu at the P7 position.Taken together, the experiments described demonstrated that although prodomains were very potent inhibitors (low nm range), they did not display highly specific properties within the SPC family of enzymes. In light of our present understanding of the importance of the C-terminal regions of the prodomains, this is not necessarily surprising since these regions have the highest degree of similarity. While our studies were entirely conducted in vitro, the data suggested that the use of prodomains as inhibitors in trans, possibly using expression systems, could result in inhibition of more than one SPC at a time. This is particularly important since most, if not all, cell lines examined to date express at least two or more SPCs endogenously (1Bergeron F. Leduc R. Day R. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 24: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 27Bennett B.D. Denis P. Haniu M. Teplow D.B. Kahn S. Louis J.C. Citron M. Vassar R. J. Biol.

A. 2000; 97: 2864-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Inhibition of an endogenous SPC using an expressed prodomain will also be difficult to control since various cellular expression systems do not control the exact levels of expression nor necessarily control the intracellular targeting of the expressed prodomain. It is clear that having a specific inhibitor for each SPC would have a tremendous usefulness to better dissect the function of each convertase within cellular systems or in vivo. Having the ability to inhibit a specific convertase with at least three log units more potency than another convertase would resolve the issue of cellular expression levels. The development of more specific inhibitors may be possible using the C-terminal sequences; however, various modifications would be required, and the success of this approach is not assured especially if SPCs are in fact very similar in their catalytic functionality. Alternatively, such potent inhibitors with broader specificity profiles may be more appropriate to target enzymes directed to the constitutive secretory pathway. This could be advantageous in the case where redundant SPC cleavage functions have been reported, such as that recently described for the β-secretase enzyme (48Pinnix I. Council J.E. Roseberry B. Onstead L. Mallender W. Sucic J. Sambamurti K. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1810-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Proteolytic processing is a post-translational modification by which a cell diversifies and controls the protein products of its genes. In mammalian species, endoproteolytic activation of many secretory protein precursors is carried out by the SPCs1 (for a review see Ref.1Bergeron F. Leduc R. Day R. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 24: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The catalytic domains of the SPCs have a high structural similarity to the bacterial subtilisins and yeast kexin (2Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). The SPC family of enzymes consists of seven distinct members named, using the unified nomenclature of Chan et al. (3Chan S.J. Oliva Jr., A.A. LaMendola J. Grens A. Bode H. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Each SPC contains at least five well conserved domains: 1) an N-terminal signal peptide, responsible for directing proteins into the secretory pathway; 2) a prodomain acting as a putative intramolecular chaperone for facilitated transportation, folding, and regulation of enzymatic activity (4Creemers J.W.

https://openalex.org/W2018570736,"hDlg is the human homolog of theDrosophila Discs-large tumor suppressor. As a member of the MAGUK (membrane-associatedguanylate kinase) family of scaffolding proteins, hDlg is composed of three PDZ (PSD-95, Dlg, and ZO-1) repeats, an SH3 (Src homology 3) motif, and a GUK (guanylate kinase-like) domain. Additionally, hDlg contains two regions of alternative splicing. Here we identify a novel insertion, I1B, located N-terminal to the PDZ repeats. We further analyze the tissue-specific combinations of insertions and correlate those results with the distribution of protein isoforms. We also identify the functions of the two alternatively spliced regions. The N-terminal alternatively spliced region is capable of binding several SH3 domains and also moderates the level of protein oligomerization. Insertions in the second region are responsible for determining the localization of hDlg, with insertion I3 targeting the protein to the membrane regions of cell-cell contact and insertion I2 targeting the protein to the nucleus. hDlg is the human homolog of theDrosophila Discs-large tumor suppressor.

First identified from human B lymphocyte cDNA, hDlgencodes a 100-kDa protein sharing ∼60% similarity withDrosophila Dlg and 70% similarity with rat SAP90/PSD-95 (1Lue R.A. Marfatia S.M. Branton D. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9818-9822Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Both hDlg mRNA and protein are abundant in human and murine tissues (1Lue R.A. Marfatia S.M. Branton D. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9818-9822Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Consistent with the cellular localization of Dlg to septate junctions, hDlg localizes to regions of cell-cell contact in human epithelial cells (1Lue R.A. Marfatia S.M. Branton D. Chishti A.H. Proc.

Protein 4.1 was the first protein shown to bind to hDlg (1Lue R.A. Marfatia S.M. Branton D. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9818-9822Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Two members of the ERM (ezrin, radixin,moesin) subfamily of cytoskeletal proteins with homology to protein 4.1 also bind to hDlg and, in turn, form a complex with the membrane glycoprotein CD44 (2Lue R.A. Brandin E. Chan E.P. Branton D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1125-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The GUK domain recruits a number of proteins including the GKAP/SAPAP/DAP family of proteins, BEGAIN and MAP1A (3Shin H. Hsueh Y.P. Yang F.C. Kim E. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3580-3587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Dimitratos S.D. Woods D.F. Stathakis D.G. Bryant P.J. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 912-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Additionally, hDlg binds to several proteins involved in cell cycle regulation and tumorigenesis. It has been recently demonstrated that PBK, a mitotic serine/threonine kinase, interacts with hDlg (5Gaudet S. Branton D. Lue R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5167-5172Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The APC tumor suppressor forms a complex with hDlg that blocks progression to the S phase of the cell cycle (6Ishidate T. Matsumine A. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The human papilloma virus E6 and adenomavirus E4-ORF1 oncoproteins also interact with hDlg. Furthermore, mutant E6 and E4 lacking sequences required for hDlg binding loose their oncogenic capacity (7Kiyono T. Hiraiwa A. Fujita M. Hayashi Y. Akiyama T. Ishibashi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

A. 1997; 94: 6670-6675Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Several alternatively spliced isoforms of hDlg have been described (Figs. 1 and 6). An alternatively spliced insertion called I1 (1Lue R.A. Marfatia S.M. Branton D. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9818-9822Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) is located between the unique N-terminal domain of hDlg (NAG) and the first PDZ repeat. The region between the SH3 and GUK domains of hDlg was first characterized as containing two alternatively spliced insertions, I2 and I3 (1Lue R.A. Marfatia S.M. Branton D. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9818-9822Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). In the same region, a third alternatively spliced insertion, called I4, was described in a brain isoform of hDlg (9Mori K. Iwao K. Miyoshi Y. Nakagawara A. Kofu K. Akiyama T. Artia N. Hayakawa T. Nakamura Y. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 43: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The region of hDlg that separates the insertion sites of I2/I3 and I4 is also alternatively spliced (9Mori K. Iwao K. Miyoshi Y. Nakagawara A. Kofu K. Akiyama T. Artia N. Hayakawa T. Nakamura Y. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 43: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In keeping with our nomenclature, we have termed this region I5.Figure 6Sequences of alternatively spliced insertions located between hDlg SH3 and GUK domains. Panel A, sequences of I2, I3, I4, and I5 insertions. The insertions I2 and I4 share a similar C-terminal end (black highlight). The I5 insertion is located between the I3/I2 and I4 insertion sites. Panel B, an isoform containing both I3 (black highlight) and I2 (gray highlight) insertions was identified by RT-PCR. The coding sequences for the I3 and I2 insertions are not in the same reading frame. A +1 frameshift (# sign) would be necessary to translate the corresponding transcript into an hDlg isoform containing both insertions. In the absence of frameshift a truncated form of hDlg would be produced since a stop codon (underlined) in-frame with the I3 coding sequence is found shortly after the end of the I3 sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Only the alternatively spliced insertion I3 has a characterized function. I3 and the PDZ1–2 region of hDlg show similar patterns of charged residues, both forming binding sites for 4.1-like proteins. Both sites contribute to hDlg localization at sites of cell-cell contact (2Lue R.A. Brandin E. Chan E.P. Branton D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1125-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In this study, we identify a novel alternatively spliced insertion, I1B, located in the N-terminal region of the protein. We examine tissue-specific combinations of hDlg alternatively spliced transcripts. We also determine that I1A and I1B form multiple SH3-binding domains, and modulate the level of self-association seen in hDlg. Finally, while it is well documented that I3 is responsible for localization of hDlg to the plasma membrane (2Lue R.A. Brandin E. Chan E.P. Branton D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1125-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), the role of I2 had not been previously addressed. In this study, we show that I2 is responsible for targeting hDlg to the nucleus. Select Human Multiple Tissue cDNA libraries (CLONTECH Laboratories) were amplified with primers BL6 and either F5 or C (Fig.1 A). To identify I1A/I1B insertions, four sets of secondary PCR reactions were performed using the primers BL31, BL19, D, and BL14 (Fig. 1 A). In separate secondary PCR reactions, I2, I3, I4, and I5 insertions were amplified with primer pairs A + G, A + H, C + F, and A + 5A, respectively (Fig.1 A). The sizes of the resulting secondary PCR products were determined by agarose gel electrophoresis. In some instances, PCR products were subcloned and identified by DNA sequencing analysis. To assess the reliability of our analysis, two other sets of tissues cDNA libraries (CLONTECH) were used. For each of the three library sets at least three independent experiments were performed and gave consistent results. The sequence of the SH3 domain from hDlg (residues 585–650) was amplified from human B lymphocyte single stranded cDNA. The other cDNA sequences encoding for hDlg polypeptides were PCR amplified from the original hDlg full-length clone (1Lue R.A. Marfatia S.M. Branton D. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9818-9822Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Amplified cDNAs were subcloned into theEscherichia coli expression vector pGEX (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The N-terminal portion and the SH3 domain of hDlg were expressed in E. coli as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. Affinity purified fusion proteins and thrombin-cleaved proteins were further purified by anion-exchange chromatography. Purified glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins of the SH3 domains from Abl, and Crk were kindly provided by Bruce Mayer. The purified fusion proteins were dialyzed into phosphate-buffered saline and then mixed with biotin ester at a molar ratio of 1:3 and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The labeling reaction was quenched with a final concentration of 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, before dialysis into Tris-buffered saline (TBS). Purified hDlg polypeptides containing the N-terminal region from residues 1 to 220, with or without the I1A/I1B insertions as well as a peptide corresponding to the I1A insertion alone, were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose. The blotted proteins were blocked at room temperature for 1 h in TBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20, 0.2% gelatin. Avidin was then added to the blocking solution at a final concentration of 1.5 μm and the room temperature incubation was resumed for an additional 1 h. The blots were then further blocked with 1 mm biotin in TBSTG for 1 h. The blots were incubated with the biotinylated SH3 domain probes at a concentration of 1 μg/ml in TBSTG for 4 h at 4 °C with constant shaking. The secondary incubation was performed with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin (1:5000) in TBSTG for 1 h. The blots were washed four times with TBST between each step. Finally, the blots were developed with nitro blue tetrazolium/4-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate in 150 mm Tris, pH 8.8. These experiments were repeated three times without noticeable differences in the results obtained. The synthetic competitor peptide represented the SH3-binding motif from 3BP-1 (Pep1: APTMPPPLPP). In the peptide competition experiments, the biotinylated SH3-Abl probe in TBSTG was preincubated with a given concentration of Pep1 (25–400 μm) for 2 h at 4 °C before being added to the blot. The blot was then processed as described above. In other experiments, unlabeled SH3 domains were used to compete with the biotinylated probes. Specifically, after blocking, the blotted hDlg polypeptides were incubated with the mixed SH3 domains in TBSTG for 6 h and processed as before. These experiments were repeated three times without noticeable differences in the results obtained. Recombinant proteins in 100 mm Na phosphate buffer, pH 8.3, were incubated 1 h at room temperature in the presence of an increasing concentration of dimethyl pimelimidate·2HCl freshly prepared in 100 mm Na phosphate buffer, pH 8.3. The cross-linking reactions were stopped by the addition of 1/10 volume of quenching solution (50 mm ethanolamine, 20 mm ethylmaleimide, in 50 mm Na phosphate buffer, pH 7.4). Samples were either frozen at −80 °C until further use or mixed with 5 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Samples incubated with sample buffer were then resolved by SDS-PAGE using a Tricine gel buffer system. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose filters. Filters were probed with anti-hDlg antiserum (1:1000) and antigen-antibody complexes were detected with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. The blots were developed by incubation with a solution of nitro blue tetrazolium/4-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. Two distinct batches of proteins were used and identical results were obtained in five sets of cross-linking reactions. The cell line MCF10F (ATCC) was grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator in the recommended medium. The cells were grown to ∼80% confluence and then fixed in cold methanol. Cells were incubated at 37 °C with primary antibodies for 1 h and with specific secondary antibodies at 37 °C for 30 min. Alternatively, for control staining, antibodies were first preincubated overnight at 4 °C with a 100-fold molar excess of recombinant proteins containing either insertion I2 or I3. The primary antibodies used were the following: affinity purified anti-NAG (diluted 1:100), anti-I2 or anti-I3 (diluted 1:10). In some cases, the cells were stained with 2 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes). Images were captured using a Zeiss confocal microscope or an Applied Precision deconvolution microscope. In the latter case, Z-series were deconvolved using Delta Vision deconvolution software (Applied Precision Inc.) and shown as maximum intensity quick projections. Multiple Tissue cDNA libraries were amplified with primers F5 and BL6 and purified as described above. Secondary PCR reactions using primer pairs MG1 + B, MG2 + B, or E + B were performed to amplify hDlg sequences containing specific combinations of I1A/I1B insertions. Primer MG1 is a composite of sequences located immediately upstream of I1A and immediately downstream of I1B but lacking I1A and I1B sequences. Therefore, the MG1 and B primers amplified only alternatively spliced sequences lacking the I1A and I1B insertions (ΔI1). The primer MG2 anneals to the sequence immediately upstream of I1A and to the 5′ sequence of I1B but does not anneal to I1A, therefore the MG2 + B primers amplified only alternatively spliced sequences in which I1B is present without I1A (I1BΔA). The primer E anneals within the I1A insertion and could amplify sequences containing I1A and I1B insertions (I1A + B) or I1A without I1B (I1AΔB). The PCR products were digested with AvaII, submitted to agarose gel electrophoresis, and transferred to a nylon membrane. The blots were probed with the biotinylated oligonucleotides H or G, specific to I3 and I2, respectively, using the ExpressHyb system (CLONTECH). Restriction fragments recognized by the probes were visualized with a Biotin Lumninescent Detection Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). These experiments were repeated at least three times without noticeable differences in the results obtained. We have identified a novel 54-base alternatively spliced insertion in hDlg. This insertion, termed I1B, is located between the previously described I1 (now termed I1A) and the PDZ repeats. The sequence of I1B is shown in Fig.2 A. PCR amplification of cDNA molecules was used to analyze all combinations of I1A and I1B insertions found in hDlg transcripts from human brain, skeletal muscle, kidney, liver, cardiac muscle, and lung tissue. In all tissues tested, transcripts containing I1A and I1B together (I1A + B), I1B without I1A (I1BΔA), and neither I1A nor I1B (ΔI1) were identified (Fig.2 B, Table I). However, consistent with a previous study that found I1A to be barely detectable in brain (9Mori K. Iwao K. Miyoshi Y. Nakagawara A. Kofu K. Akiyama T. Artia N. Hayakawa T. Nakamura Y. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 43: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), I1A + B was detected in brain cDNA after a 30-cycle PCR reaction but not after a 20-cycle PCR. This suggested that the transcript coding for I1A + B is present only in low amounts in brain. PCR products containing I1A but lacking I1B (I1AΔB) were not detected in any tissue. For this reason, all subsequent PCRs using primer E within I1A were assumed to amplify I1A + B, but not I1AΔB.Table ISummary of PCR product sizes obtained using primers annealing with inserts I1A or BPrimers1-aThe position of the primers is diagrammed in Fig. 1.I1 A + B1-bThe sizes in bold indicate PCR products that were found in all tissues tested.I1AΔB1-bThe sizes in bold indicate PCR products that were found in all tissues tested.1-cX corresponds to PCR reactions that should not amplify any product.I1BΔA1-bThe sizes in bold indicate PCR products that were found in all tissues tested.1-cX corresponds to PCR reactions that should not amplify any product.ΔI11-bThe sizes in bold indicate PCR products that were found in all tissues tested.1-cX corresponds to PCR reactions that should not amplify any product.BL31 + BL19231 bp177 bp132 bp78 bpBL31 + BL14188 bpX89 bpXD + BL19168 bp114 bpXXD + BL14125 bpXXX1-a The position of the primers is diagrammed in Fig. 1.1-b The sizes in bold indicate PCR products that were found in all tissues tested.1-c X corresponds to PCR reactions that should not amplify any product. Open table in a new tab Based on preliminary experiments showing an interaction between an SH3 domain and full-length hDlg (data not shown) and on the proline-rich character of I1A and I1B (Fig. 2 A), the N-terminal portion of hDlg was predicted to contain at least one SH3-binding site. Sequence analysis showed that the patterns of proline residues contained in these two insertions was similar to the consensus SH3-binding motifs derived from dynamin, mSos1, and 3BP-1 (motifs a, b, and c in Fig.2 A). The SH3 binding ability of the peptide I1A, and of hDlg polypeptides containing I1A and I1B (NI1AB) or I1B alone (NI1BΔA) was tested (Fig.3). I1A was required for SH3 binding activity (compare Fig. 3, A and B). Preliminary assays showed that the level of biotinylation of each probe was comparable (data not shown) allowing a direct comparison of probe avidity for the hDlg polypeptides. The probing of hDlg polypeptides containing I1A and I1B showed substantial binding to the SH3 domain from Abl and the C-terminal SH3 domain of Crk but no significant binding to the SH3 domain from hDlg (Fig. 3 B, NI1AB) and from p55 or nSrc (data not shown). We also detected a weaker binding with SH3 domains from c-Src, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and Grb2 (data not shown). Therefore, we focused the rest of our analysis to SH3-Abl and SH3-Crk. Probing of the I1A peptide in isolation (Fig. 3 C, I1A) showed a different binding pattern. SH3-Crk but not SH3-Abl bound to the I1A insertion alone. Competition assays were performed to establish the specificity of the observed SH3-Abl binding activity. SH3-Abl is known to interact with 3PB-1. Co-crystallization of SH3-Abl and a binding peptide derived from 3BP-1 showed that this peptide occupied the polyproline binding groove of SH3-Abl (10Musacchio A. Saraste M. Wilmanns M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The incubation of SH3-Abl with an increasing amount of the same 3BP-1-derived peptide (Pep1) resulted in a decrease of the amount of SH3-Abl bound to NI1AB (Fig.4 A), demonstrating a canonical interaction between NI1AB and the SH3-Abl motif. A similar demonstration was not possible with the C-terminal SH3 domain of Crk since its cognate peptide is unknown. Since hDlg binds to several SH3 domains, we tested the ability of two distinct SH3 domains to bind simultaneously to hDlg. Binding assays using unlabeled SH3-Abl and SH3-Crk as competitors showed no observable competition between these SH3 domains for binding to I1A + B (Fig.4 B), suggesting that both domains interacted simultaneously with distinct portions of hDlg N terminus. It has been shown that an hDlg self-association site resides within its N-terminal domain (11Marfatia S.M. Byron O. Campbell G. Liu S. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13759-13770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To analyze the impact of I1A and I1B on hDlg self-association, we performed cross-linking experiments on two variants of the N-terminal portion of hDlg, one containing I1A + B and another with I1BΔA. Both variants gave rise to high molecular weight protein bands detected with anti-hDlg antibodies. The major cross-linked product had a size consistent with that of a dimer (Fig. 5). At high concentrations of cross-linker (2 to 2.5 mm), products that might correspond to trimers and tetramers were also observed. A higher level of self-association was observed with NI1BDA than with NI1AB (Fig. 5). The region comprised between the SH3 and GUK domains contains four alternatively spliced insertions: I2, I3, I4, and I5 (Figs. 1 and6). PCR analysis was performed on cDNA molecules derived from seven human tissues: brain, placenta, skeletal muscle, kidney, liver, cardiac muscle, lung, and pancreas. I3, I2, and I5 were present in all tissues (Fig.7, A, B, andD). In contrast, I4 was detected only in brain and liver (Fig. 7 C). The varying patterns of bands observed in I2, I4, or I5 specific amplifications suggested preferential combinations of alternatively spliced insertions in various tissues. PCR reactions using an I2-specific primer produced from one to three products (Fig.7 B). Each of these products was isolated and sequenced; the small (300 bp) product corresponded to I2 alone, and the upper band of the 400-bp doublet corresponded to a combination of I3 and I2. The lower band from the doublet was shown to be a PCR artifact. Sequence analysis of PCR products containing both I3 and I2 revealed a frameshift between the two insertion-coding sequences (Fig.6 B). This shift introduced a stop codon three codons after the end of I3. In vitro translation of hDlg full-length constructs containing I2 and I3 produced a protein truncated immediately after I3 (data not shown). Sequencing the products of PCR reactions that used an I4-specific primer (Fig. 7 C) demonstrated that I4 was always associated with I2 and I5 in the liver. In contrast, I4 was associated either with I2 and I5 (smaller size PCR product) or with I3, I2, and I5 (larger size PCR product) in the brain. In both tissues, the [I2, I4, I5] combination was predominant. Reactions using an I5-specific primer gave different banding patterns across the tissues tested (Fig. 7 D). In order of decreasing size, these bands corresponded to the following combinations of insertions: [I3, I2, I5], [I3, I5], and [I2, I5]. While the importance of the first two PDZ repeats and the I3 insertion for the localization of hDlg to sites of cell-cell contact has been demonstrated previously (2Lue R.A. Brandin E. Chan E.P. Branton D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1125-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), the impact of the I2 insertion on hDlg intracellular distribution has not. To address this issue, near confluent MCF10F cells were stained with affinity purified anti-NAG antibodies that recognize all hDlg isoforms. In these cells, hDlg labeling was found at sites of cell-cell contact and as discrete domains within nuclei (Fig. 8). A similar distribution was observed with four other cell lines (MCF7, Detroit 551, FHC, and HeLa) and the presence of hDlg within purified nuclei was confirmed by immunoblot (data not shown). To further characterize the plasma membrane-bound and nuclear hDlg species, MCF10F cells were stained with affinity purified anti-I3 and anti-I2 antibodies. The two types of isoforms displayed distinct staining patterns (Fig. 9). As expected, I3 containing isoforms were localized at sites of cell-cell contact (Fig. 9 A). The specificity of the labeling was demonstrated by the significant reduction in membrane staining after preincubation of anti-I3 with a polypeptide containing I3 (Fig. 9 B). Staining with affinity purified anti-I2 antibodies showed that I2 containing isoforms were localized within the nucleus and organized into discrete domains (Fig. 9 C). The nuclear staining was eliminated by preincubation of the anti-I2 antibodies with a polypeptide containing I2 (Fig. 9 D, arrowheads). To identify preferential associations between insertions found at the two sites of alternative splicing, we performed RT-PCR assays using sense primers that specifically amplified one of the three possible N-terminal insertion combinations: I1A + B, I1BΔA, or ΔI1. The three types of PCR products were then digested withAvaII, yielding different digestion patterns in the presence or absence of I3 (Figs. 1 and 10). AvaII digestion of PCR products containing only I2 or only I3 will produce a specific 666-bp restriction fragment or two specific fragments (580 and 153 bp), respectively. AvaII digestion of PCR products containing both I3 and I2 will also produce two specific fragments (580 and 189 bp). All three types of PCR products will share the two otherAvaII restriction fragments (Fig.10). The identity of these specific fragments was confirmed by Southern blot using probes specific for either I2 or I3. Since we focused our analysis on cardiac and skeletal muscles, brain, kidney, and liver tissues and we did not assay for the presence or absence of I4 and I5, the various combinations we identified do not represent the full range of possible isoforms contained in all tissues. Fig. 10 contains an example of the data we obtained using human kidney cDNA. The three types of PCR products derived from the kidney cDNA library gave complex restriction digestion patterns (Fig.10 B, AvaII) indicating multiple combinations of insertions between the two sites of alternative splicing. As demonstrated by Southern blot, kidney isoforms containing I1A + B, I1B alone (I1BΔA), or lacking both I1A and B (ΔI1) also contained I2, I3, or I2 + I3 (Fig. 10 B, probes I2 andI3). Similar combinations were observed with liver cDNA. In contrast, brain, cardiac muscle, and skeletal muscle contained more limited, yet varied, combinations of insertions (summarized in TableII).Table IIIdentification of hDlg isoforms in various tissuesInserts combinationBrainCardiac muscleSkeletal muscleKidneyI1A + B/I3+2-a+, detected by DNA hybridization or immunoprecipitation.+++I1A + B/I2ND2-bND, not detected.(+)2-c(+), indicates a weak signal.ND+I1A + B/I3 + 2NDND++I1B/I3ND+ND+I1B/I2+NDND+I1B/I3 + 2ND+ND+ΔI1/I3ND+ND+ΔI1/I2+NDND+ΔI1/I3 + 2ND+ND+2-a +, detected by DNA hybridization or immunoprecipitation.2-b ND, not detected.2-c (+), indicates a weak signal. Open table in a new tab It has been suggested that the presence of multiple binding sites within the hDlg protein may allow it to function as a scaffolding protein (2Lue R.A. Brandin E. Chan E.P. Branton D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1125-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). It stands to reason that isoforms of the hDlg protein containing different combinations of alternatively spliced insertions may in fact have distinct functions within the cell and the presence of particular insertions in hDlg may be of critical importance in cell regulation. Indeed, one study has shown that in two-thirds of neuroblastoma cell lines, the hDlg isoforms present differ from those seen in normal brain tissues (9Mori K. Iwao K. Miyoshi Y. Nakagawara A. Kofu K. Akiyama T. Artia N. Hayakawa T. Nakamura Y. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 43: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). As such, it is important to determine the composition and distribution of isoform combinations of hDlg and to characterize the role of these alternatively spliced insertions. The N-terminal portion of hDlg is characterized by two proline-rich alternatively spliced insertions I1A and I1B (Fig. 2 A) that are predicted to form an extended helical domain comprised of up to two polyproline II helices (12Adzhubei A.A. Sternberg M.J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 472-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 13Williamson M.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). This structural prediction based on the (PXX) n consensus together with the general hydrophobic character of the sequence support the hypothesis that the I1A and B insertions are two SH3-binding sites. We have demonstrated that the I1A and B insertions, in the context of the N terminus of hDlg, form a double binding site that is capable of interacting with several SH3 domains in vitro. Significant binding was detected with both Abl and Crk SH3 domains. The consensus sequence derived from the Abl ligands, 3BP1 and 3BP2, has the form PXXPPPXXP, where the proline residues at position 1, 6, and 9 are necessary for the binding of 3BP1 to SH3-Abl (14Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). When the pattern of the essential proline residues is compared with that of motif c overlapping I1A and I1B (Fig. 2 A, underlined proline residues), there is a similar sequence in the opposite orientation and the hydrophobic character of the non-proline residues is also conserved. This could account for the binding of SH3-Abl to hDlg, especially since the binding of SH3 ligands is independent of their orientation due to the symmetrical structure of the polyproline II helices. The failure of excess unlabeled SH3-Crk to compete the binding of biotinylated SH3-Abl and vice versa is evidence for the simultaneous association of Crk and Abl with distinct sites. In light of the well documented promiscuity of binding to polyproline sequences displayed by SH3 domains, it is likely that the I1A and I1B domains can bind a range of SH3 domains in the cell. For example, recent data suggest an interaction between hDlg and the SH3-containing tyrosine kinase p56lck in T-lymphocytes (15Hanada T. Lin L. Chandy K.G., Oh, S.S. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26899-26904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Among the three combinations of I1A and B identified by RT-PCR, the isoforms containing I1A + B, which can simultaneously bind to two distinct SH3-containing proteins, were detected in all tested tissues. The isoform predicted to recruit a single SH3-containing protein (I1AΔB) was not detected in any of the eight tissues tested. Isoforms lacking I1A and I1B and those containing only I1B, less likely to bind SH3 domains, were detected in most tissues. The most prevalent hDlg isoform containing I1A, I1B, and I3 can presumably recruit distinct SH3-containing proteins at sites of cell-cell contact. These proteins may be involved in single or interconnected signaling pathways. Moreover, hDlg self-association increases the ability of this isoform to cluster signaling molecules. The degree of self-association is higher with the isoform lacking I1A although it is less likely to recruit SH3-containing proteins. Therefore, alternative splicing of I1A and I1B in I3 containing isoforms can modulate the function of hDlg isoforms at sites of cell-cell contact. Sequence comparisons between hDlg and members of the chapsyn family (PSD-93, PSD-95) suggest that if all have a common means of self-association, the cysteine residues found near the N terminus of chapsyns but absent in hDlg are unlikely to contribute to self-association (Fig. 11). This conclusion is supported by the fact that these cysteine residues play a role in PSD-95 and PSD-93 palmitoylation (16Topinka J.R. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 1998; 20: 125-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 17El-Husseini A.E. Topinka J.R. Lehrer-Graiwer J.E. Firestein B.L. Craven S.E. Aoki C. Bredt D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23904-23910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). hDlg and chapsyns also share a well conserved 22-amino acid motif (Fig. 11) together with a conserved proline-rich domain corresponding to I1B in hDlg. The contribution of I1B to SH3 binding (Fig. 3) together with overlay experiments showing the self-association of a ΔI1 isoform (data not shown) suggest that I1B is not critical for self-association. Therefore, we propose that the self-association domain is comprised of the 22-residue sequence conserved across hDlg and chapsyns. Searches in data bases using this self-association motif as a query sequence indicate that this domain, shared by hDlg, PSD-95, and PSD-93, is absent in other MAGUK proteins. It is important to note that intermolecular interactions between the SH3 and GUK domains may also contribute to hDlg self-association (18McGee A.W. Bredt D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17431-17436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In hDlg, the region located between the SH3 and GUK domains has multiple functions. It contributes to the targeting of hDlg to the plasma membrane (2Lue R.A. Brandin E. Chan E.P. Branton D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1125-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), it is implicated in the interaction between the two domains (19Wu H. Reuver S.M. Kuhlendahl S. Chung W.J. Garner C.C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2365-2376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it contains four alternatively spliced insertions: I2, I3, I4, and I5 (Figs. 1 and 6). Therefore, it was important to characterize the combinations of these insertions in various tissues. As expected, the [I3, I5] combination was prevalent in most tissues since both I3 and I5 were found in all tissues. Immunoprecipitations with antibodies directed against specific insertions show a good correspondence between the isoform complexity at the transcript and protein levels. 2A. Viel, unpublished results. Finally, the presence in the same isoform of I2 and I3 was consistent with the previous observation of Mori et al. (9Mori K. Iwao K. Miyoshi Y. Nakagawara A. Kofu K. Akiyama T. Artia N. Hayakawa T. Nakamura Y. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 43: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and such an isoform appears prevalent in skeletal and cardiac muscle. Although transcripts containing both I3 and I2 produced a protein truncated after the I3 region in vitro (data not shown), a regulated ribosomal frameshift leading to a full-length isoform containing I2 and I3 cannot be ruled out in vivo. We did not study the role of insertions I4 and I5 but instead focused on the impact on I2 and I3 on the intracellular distribution of various isoforms. The membrane localization of the I3 containing isoforms is consistent with the role of I3 in anchoring hDlg to the membrane-associated cortical skeleton through the protein 4.1/ERM protein family and the E-cadherin-catenin adhesion complex (2Lue R.A. Brandin E. Chan E.P. Branton D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1125-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 20Hough C.D. Woods D.F. Park S. Bryant P.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3242-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 21Hoover K.B. Bryant P.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). As previously described (2Lue R.A. Brandin E. Chan E.P. Branton D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1125-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), hDlg isoforms were not found in regions of the plasma membrane of cells not engaged in cell-cell contact. The I3 insertion together with the region located between PDZ1 and -2 appear to be solely responsible for hDlg membrane targeting. In that respect, hDlg differs from the members of the chapsyn family, which require either the palmitoylation of their N termini in the case of PSD-95 and PSD-93 or association with heavy metals in the case of SAP-102 for membrane association and subcellular localization in neurons (17El-Husseini A.E. Topinka J.R. Lehrer-Graiwer J.E. Firestein B.L. Craven S.E. Aoki C. Bredt D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23904-23910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This difference suggests that the association of I3-containing hDlg with the plasma membrane should be more dynamic than that of chapsyns with the plasma membrane at the synapse. In contrast to the established role of I3, the role of I2 in hDlg nuclear localization remains unclear. Specific nuclear staining with anti-I2 has also been observed in tissue sections suggesting that nuclear distribution is not restricted to established cell lines. 3A. Viel, unpublished data. Four to five putative nuclear localization signals are predicted in both I2- and I3-containing isoforms, but the I2 insertion itself lacks a canonical nuclear localization signal. Since only I2-containing isoforms are found in the nucleus, it is likely that none of these putative signals are solely responsible for nuclear localization. A yet unidentified I2 binding partner may be responsible for the direct or indirect shuttling or retention of this hDlg isoform into the nucleus. Protein 4.1 is also known to shuttle between the plasma membrane and the nucleus (22Lallena M.J. Martinez C. Valcarcel J. Correas I. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1963-1971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Still, it is unlikely that protein 4.1 is responsible for hDlg nuclear localization since it interacts with I3 and not I2. hDlg is not the only member of the MAGUK family to localize in the nucleus. The protein CASK was recently identified in the nucleus associated with the Tbr-1 transcription factor via its GUK domain (23Hsueh Y.P. Wang T.F. Yang F.C. Sheng M. Nature. 2000; 404: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Since CASK does not contain a region homologous to I2, we believe that the molecular mechanisms of CASK and hDlg nuclear targeting are different. Immunostaining also revealed that in cells forming cell-cell contacts, the I2-containing isoforms appeared more evenly distributed between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, and in a few cell clusters, cell-cell contact labeling was observed with anti-I2 antibodies (data not shown). The membrane staining is explained by the ability of the PDZ1–2 motif to interact with members of the ERM family (2Lue R.A. Brandin E. Chan E.P. Branton D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1125-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In the absence of quantitative measurements it is difficult to determine whether this distribution change is due to an increasing amount of the cytoplasmic form or a decreasing amount of nuclear hDlg. Nevertheless, this observation shows that the distribution of hDlg isoforms is a dynamic process and may correlate with the physiological state of the cell. In conclusion, we hypothesize that isoforms containing I1A and -B have a predominant signaling role whereas isoforms lacking I1A and/or I1B have a predominantly structural role. The role of the nuclear form of hDlg has not yet been defined. Based on the function of hDlg at the plasma membrane, it is possible that nuclear hDlg also has a structural role and may nucleate protein complexes at the nuclear matrix. It is noteworthy that hDlg interacts with the mitotic kinase PBK and both proteins are phosphorylated during mitosis (5Gaudet S. Branton D. Lue R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5167-5172Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This implies that hDlg may be important at various stages of the cell cycle. Indeed, both types of isoforms may function as cell-cycle regulators since mitosis requires both a loss of cell-cell contact during which the I3-containing isoform may play a role, and chromatin reorganization that may involve the I2-containing isoform.

Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 33-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In most biological contexts, integrin receptors exist in an environment of ligand excess, and hence, binding between receptor and ligand is usually controlled by intracellular signals rather than by receptor or ligand availability. During normal development, α5β1 integrin becomes dispensable for basal epithelial cells undergoing differentiation to keratinocytes and for myoblasts differentiating into myotubes. In both cases there is a down-modulation of integrin function that precedes the down modulation of its synthesis (2Adams J.C. Watt F.M.

Modulation of integrin function is important for cell migration to produce differences in functional integrin states at the leading and trailing edges (4Sheetz M.P. Felsenfeld D. Galbraith C.G.

The ability of integrin-mediated adhesion to be regulated by intracellular cues is critical to many facets of biology. The activation of integrin-ligand binding requires metabolic energy and the actin cytoskeleton, but the exact mechanisms are poorly understood. In platelets and lymphocytes, G-protein-coupled receptors can serve as co-stimulatory receptors to activate integrin binding through intracellular signaling pathways (5Parise L.V. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Outside the hemopoietic system, Ha-Ras and R-Raf have been identified in transfection assays as suppressors of integrin activation as measured by the binding of the PAC-1 monoclonal antibody to integrin chimeras containing the αIIB and β3 extracellular domains (6Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). R-Ras was identified as an activator of integrin function (7Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The tetraspan protein CD98 has been implicated in the activation of α3β1 integrin (8Fenczik C.A. Sethi T. Ramos J.W. Hughes P.E. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Despite the identification of intracellular signals, which can affect the activation state of integrins, the link between these pathways and the integrin molecules remains obscure. Active integrins concentrate in focal adhesions that also contain both protein kinases and high concentrations of phosphorylated proteins (9Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domains of both β1 and β3integrin show a high degree of homology and contain two tyrosines located in domains that are important for the binding of focal adhesion proteins and the regulation of integrin function (10Reszka A.A. Hayashi Y. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1321-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 11Calderwood D.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22607-22610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Substitutions of alanine for tyrosine at these sites or introduction of structure-perturbing mutations at adjacent sites results in loss of integrin function (12Filardo E.J. Brooks P.C. Deming S.L.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, demonstrating a role for tyrosine phosphorylation in the regulation of integrin function has been more problematic. Measurement of integrin phosphorylation has been technically more difficult than for other focal adhesion-associated proteins. Hence, most reports have relied on tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations to probe this issue. In most integrin function assays, these mutants were indistinguishable from wild type (12Filardo E.J. Brooks P.C. Deming S.L. Damsky C. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 13Ylanne J. Huuskonen J. O'Toole T.E. Ginsberg M.H. Virtanen I.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), although they could be distinguished in clot retraction and cell motility assays that involve complex cytoskeletal functions in addition to integrin function (15Sakai T. Zhang Q. Fassler R. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 16Law D. DeGuzman F.R. Heiser P. Ministri-Madrid K. Kileen N. Phillips D.R. Nature. 1999; 401: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). To more directly address the role of phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of β integrins in the regulation of ligand binding function, we developed a system for conditional modulation of integrin phosphorylation and applied a newly developed method to measure directly the effect of this phosphorylation in the strength of the αvβ3-fibronectin bond (17Garcia A.J. Huber F. Boettiger D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10988-10993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 18Boettiger D. Huber F. Lynch L. Blystone S.D. Mol. Cell.

Human osteosarcoma cells (HOS cells)1; ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum (Mediatech, Herndon, Virginia) and penicillin-streptomycin. Human plasma fibronectin and cell culture media were purchased from Invitrogen. Monoclonal antibody, LIBS-1, was a gift from M. Ginsberg. AIIB2 and BIIG2 hybridomas were gifts from C. Damsky. Monoclonal antibodies LM609, P1D6, P1B5 and PM6/13 were purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, California). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, Pennsylvania), and phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-rat antibody was purchased from Sigma. To generate HOSnsrc cells, HOS cells were transfected with the temperature-sensitive UP-1-v-Src mutant using the HIT retroviral vector system (19Maroney A.C. Qureshi S.A. Foster D.A. Brugge J.S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1207-1214PubMed Google Scholar, 20Soneoka Y. Cannon P.M. Ramsdale E.E. Griffiths J.C. Romano G. Kingsman S.M. Kingsman A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 628-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Stable transfectants were selected with Geneticin. WT β3, β3(Y747F), β3(Y759F), and β3(Y747F,Y759F) DNAs were cloned into pREP9 (Invitrogen), and αv DNA was cloned into pCDM8 (Invitrogen) (from S. Blystone). The ptreLuc vector expressing hygromycin resistance was a gift from P. Bates. HOSnsrc cells were transfected with a mixture of a β3 vector, an αv vector and ptreLuc using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). Stable and transient transfectants were selected by hygromycin resistance. The spinning disc assay was performed essentially as described (17Garcia A.J. Huber F. Boettiger D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10988-10993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 21Garcia A.J. Ducheyne P. Boettiger D.

Virol. 1998; 72: 3587-3594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were allowed to adhere for 7 min to fibronectin on glass coverslips in the chamber of the spinning disc device, which was partially filled with spinning buffer pre-warmed to 37 °C to keep the cells near this temperature during the adhesion period. Cells were spun for 5 min, fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, and stained with ethidium homodimer. Cell density at different radial positions was determined by using a motorized stage and Phase 3 image analysis software Version 3.0, and the shear stress corresponding to 50% cell detachment (τ50) was calculated using SigmaPlot software version 5.0 (17Garcia A.J. Huber F. Boettiger D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10988-10993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Corning tissue culture microtiter plates were coated with different densities of fibronectin type III repeats 7–10 (23Leahy D.J. Aukhil I. Erickson H.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 155-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were labeled with calcein AM, trypsinized, and plated in triplicate at 104 cells/well. After 1 h, the cells were washed 3 times using a microplate washer and shaken on a Vortex Genie (Fisher) at a setting of 3–5 min of shaking between washes. The shaking is the most stringent step in this procedure and, hence, regulates the strength of the washing. This produced plates with a uniform distribution of cells in the wells rather than a donut-shaped clearing due to differential shear at different points in the well. Plates were read using a modified Dynatech MicroFluor plate reader. Cells were trypsinized, resuspended in fluorescence-activated cell sorter buffer (0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.01% sodium azide in phosphate-buffered saline), and incubated on ice for 15 min. Anti-α5 and -β1 hybridoma supernatants BIIG2 or AIIB2, respectively, were added at 1:5 dilutions or P1B5 or LM609 purified monoclonal antibodies were added at 10 μg/ml. For LIBS-1 binding studies, cells were treated with 2 mm GRGDSP and stained with the monoclonal antibody LIBS-1 at a 1:200 dilution in fluorescence-activated cell sorter buffer. Incubation of the primary antibody was carried out at 4 °C for 30 min with shaking. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse or phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-rat antibodies (for AIIB2 and BIIG2) were added at a dilution of 1:100 and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells were plated on 2 μg/ml fibronectin-coated dishes for 1 h, cross-linked with 1 mmBis[2-(sulfosuccinimidooxycarbonyloxy)ethyl]sulfone (Pierce) in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min. The cells were extracted with 0.1% SDS in phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors. The extracted protein concentration was determined by a protein assay reagent (Pierce) to ensure that same total numbers of cells were attached to the substrate. The cross-linkers were cleaved in carbonate buffer (50 mm Na2CO3, 0.1% SDS, pH 11.6) for 2 h at 37 °C, and the cross-linked pool of integrins was analyzed by Western blotting using polyclonal antibodies to the cytoplasmic domains of integrins α5, αv, β1, and β3 (Chemicon). Blots were developed with ECL (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and analyzed using a Fuji LAS-1000 system and ScienceLab 2.5 software. Normal and transformed HOSnsrc cells were grown at 35 or 39.5 °C for 72 h before treatment. The plates were washed, fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% fetal calf serum and 75 μm sodium orthovanadate was added, and incubation was continued at 35 or 39.5 °C for 2 h. Cells were then lysed in CHAPS buffer (1% CHAPS, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.01% NaN3, 10 μg/ml aprotonin, 350 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mg/ml DNase I) at 20 °C for 10 min. Lysates were spun at 15,000 ×g at 4 °C for 10 min and precleared overnight with 50 μl of goat anti-mouse IgG beads (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Costa Mesa, CA). Lysates were then immunoprecipitated with a mixture of anti-α5 antibody P1D6 (Chemicon), anti-β1antibody TS 2/16, and goat anti-mouse beads. The supernatant fraction was immunoprecipitated with anti-β3 antibody PM6/13 (Chemicon) and goat anti-mouse beads. The beads were washed 3 times with radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 2 mmsodium orthovanadate, separated on reducing 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), and blotted with either 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) for phosphotyrosine or rabbit polyclonal antibody to either β1 cytoplasmic domain (24Enomoto-Iwamoto M. Menko A.S. Philp N. Boettiger D. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1993; 1: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) or β3cytoplasmic domain (AB 1932, Chemicon). Blots were developed with ECL (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and analyzed using a Fuji LAS-1000 system and ScienceLab 2.5 software. HOS cells were transfected with a vector containing the temperature-sensitive mutant of v-Src (UP1 (19Maroney A.C. Qureshi S.A. Foster D.A. Brugge J.S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1207-1214PubMed Google Scholar)) and neoR. This mutant is temperature-sensitive for kinase activity, and the protein remains stable at the non-permissive temperature (Ref. 19Maroney A.C. Qureshi S.A. Foster D.A. Brugge J.S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1207-1214PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown). Geneticin-resistant colonies were selected and screened for temperature-sensitive expression of v-Src kinase activity. Two clones that exhibited minimal phosphorylation of pp60v-Src at the non-permissive temperature of 39.5 °C and high levels of pp60v-Src phosphorylation at the permissive temperature of 35 °C were chosen for further analysis (Fig.1A). HOS cells growing at 35 °C and expressing active v-Src kinase will hereafter be referred to as HOSnsrc35, and HOS cells grown at 39.5 °C expressing a inactive v-Src kinase will be referred to as HOSnsrc39.5. Src-dependent Phosphorylation of β1 and β3 integrin subunits was analyzed by comparing the levels of phosphotyrosine in β1 and β3immunoprecipitates of HOSnsrc35 and HOSnsrc39.5 cells. Fig.1B shows that activation of v-Src resulted in a >5-fold increase in the level of β3 phosphorylation. Tyr-747 in the cytoplasmic domain of β3 integrin is a likely site for this phosphorylation since it has been shown to be phosphorylatedin vivo and is in a site homologous to Tyr-788 in chicken β1, which can be phosphorylated by v-Src in vitro (25Blystone S.D. Lindberg F.P. Williams M.P. McHugh K.P. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31458-31462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) (26Tapley P. Horwitz A.F. Buck C.A. Burridge K. Duggan K. Rohrschneider L. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 325-333PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, β1 integrin showed a moderate level of phosphorylation in HOSnsrc39.5 cells, and this level did not appear to increase substantially after the activation of v-Src kinase in HOSnsrc35 cells. The increased background seen in the HOSnsrc35 β1 integrin blot is likely due to the increase in phosphorylation of many proteins after v-Src expression. This differs from previous reports using 32P-labeling that report increased phosphorylation of β1 in v-Src-transformed chicken cells (27Hirst R. Horwitz A.F. Buck C.A. Rohrschneider L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6470-6474Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 28Haimovich B. Aneskievich B. Boettiger D. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 271-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 29Sakai T. Jove R. Fassler R. Mosher D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3808-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The HOSnsrc cells express lower levels of v-Src compared with v-Src-transformed chicken embryo fibroblasts. Because Src co-localizes selectively with αvβ3 as opposed to α5β1 (30Felsenfeld D.P. Schwartzberg P.L. Venegas A. Tse R. Sheetz M.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 200-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), the reduced expression of v-Src would produce a selective phosphorylation of β3 over β1. A modified wash-type adhesion assay was used to determine which integrins were responsible for adhesion of HOSnsrc35 and HOSnsrc39.5 cells to fibronectin. In the modified assay, the stringency is controlled by the mechanical shaking device rather than by the force of the buffer during fluid changes. This provided a more reproducible assay and reduced the effects of the well geometry on the assay. The remaining cells following the washing procedure were uniformly distributed over the well rather than the donut-shaped detachment pattern common to wash assays. Adhesion was determined for a range of fibronectin densities, and the proportion of cells remaining was plotted as a function of fibronectin density (as determined previously (31Garcia A.J. Boettiger D. Biomat. 1999; 20: 2427-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar)). Decreases in binding affinity or adhesion are reflected in a rightward shift of the sigmoid plot (analogous to the interpretation of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays). Fig.2A shows that treatment with anti-β3 antibody had no effect on adhesion, whereas anti-β1 antibody reduced the adhesion about 60%, and combined anti-β1 and anti-β3 reduced adhesion to background levels with no dependence on fibronectin density. Fig. 2B shows that the adhesion of HOSnsrc35 cells was reduced about 60% relative to HOSnsrc39.5, as seen in the rightward displacement of the curve; again, anti-β3 had no effect but either anti-β1 or the combination of anti-β1 and anti-β3 reduced adhesion to background levels. Fig. 2C shows the analysis of adhesion in the presence and absence of blocking antibodies for a single fibronectin density. Note that this form of the analysis does not distinguish between HOSnsrc35 and HOSnsrc39.5 cells in the absence of antibodies. These data suggest that expression of v-Src produces a reduction in total adhesion to fibronectin possibly through an effect on αvβ3. To provide a better resolution of the contributions of αvβ3 and α5β1to HOSnsrc35 and HOSnsrc39.5 cell adhesion to fibronectin, we used the spinning disc device. This device exposes the cells to a linear hydrodynamic shear gradient and measures the forces required for cell detachment under different conditions. Previous experiments demonstrate that the detachment force is directly proportional to both the number of receptor-ligand bonds and the strength of those bonds (17Garcia A.J. Huber F. Boettiger D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10988-10993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 21Garcia A.J. Ducheyne P. Boettiger D. Biomat. 1997; 18: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The strength of the individual integrin ligand bonds depends on activation processes within the cell (18Boettiger D. Huber F. Lynch L. Blystone S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 12: 1227-1237Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 32Garcia A.J. Takagi J. Boettiger D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34710-34715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, this approach provides a quantitative measure of the relative strength of the integrin-ligand bonds. Fig. 3A shows a combined cell detachment profile for HOSnsrc35 and HOSnsrc39.5 cells from fibronectin as a function of applied shear stress at 7 min after plating. The data show about a 40% reduction (leftward shift, cells detach at lower shear stress) in adhesion strength as a result of temperature-dependent activation of v-Src. Analysis of the levels of cell surface expression of integrin by flow cytometry showed no difference in the levels of α3, α5, αv, β1, or β3 between HOSnsrc35 and HOSnsrc35 cells (data not shown). Thus the reduction of adhesion after the activation of v-Src cannot be explained by altered integrin expression levels. To determine whether the difference was due to differences in incubation temperature, HOSnsrc and parental HOS cells incubated at 35 and 39.5 °C were assayed using the spinning disc. Fig. 3B shows a summary of the τ50values (shear stress for 50% adhesion) for several experiments similar to that shown in Fig. 3A. Incubation temperature had no effect on the adhesion of parental HOS cells but showed a 40% reduction for HOSnsrc cells at 35 °C. For cells that express the same number of integrin receptors, differences in the slope of the mean cell detachment force (as determined form analyses shown in Fig. 3A) as a function of fibronectin density reflect differences in the strength of the integrin-ligand interaction. Fig. 3C shows that the HOSnsrc35 and HOSnsrc39.5 cells had different slopes. For the HOSnsrc39.5, there is a suggestion of a two-component curve as it deviates from linearity at higher fibronectin densities, again raising the possibility that the two receptors with different binding strengths were involved. To determine which integrin receptors were responsible for these differences, spinning disc experiments were performed on HOSnsrc cells treated with antibodies to α5 (BIIG2), β1 (AIIB2), or β3 (LM609) integrin. Fig.3D shows that the adhesion of HOSnsrc35 cells was reduced to background levels by either anti-α5 or anti-β1 but was unaffected by anti-β3. In contrast, HOSnsrc39.5 cells showed a significant but partial reduction in the presence of either anti-α5 or anti-β3 and required the mixture of anti-β1and anti-β3 to reduce adhesion to background levels. Thus, both α5β1 and αvβ3 mediated the adhesion of HOSnsrc39.5 cells. Specific adhesion strengths do not appear to be directly additive; i.e. the sum of the adhesion strength in the presence of anti-α5 representing αvβ3-mediated adhesion plus the adhesion strength in the presence of anti-β3, representing α5β1-mediated adhesion, was more than the adhesion strength in the absence of antibody. This result is not unexpected since cross-talk between these receptors had been described (33Blystone S.D. Slater S.E. Williams M.P. Crow M.T. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 889-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Unlike the HOSnsrc39.5 cells, the HOSnsrc35 cells showed no αvβ3-mediated adhesion to fibronectin. Attempts to use vitronectin to provide an alternative means of distinguishing αvβ3- from α5β1-mediated adhesion were limited by the expression of vitronectin receptors by the HOSnsrc cells in addition to αvβ3. Thus, activation of v-Src in the HOSnsrc cells results in the inactivation of αvβ3 integrin function as determined by its ability to support a mechanical connection to fibronectin. This αvβ3 function could be switched on and off by switching the incubation temperature of the cells, thereby activating or inactivating the v-Src kinase enzymatic function. Chemical cross-linking has been used for the analysis of many receptor-ligand interactions. We have taken the approach of using cell-impermeant cross-linkers to cross-link cell surface integrins to substrate-immobilized ligands. After cross-linking with Bis[2-(sulfosuccinimidooxycarbonyloxy)ethyl]sulfone, the cells were extracted with a strong detergent, leaving the cross-linked integrin behind. The cross-linker was cleaved at high pH, releasing the cross-linked integrin for analysis by Western blot. Control experiments have shown that the recovery of integrin from the cross-linked fraction requires the proper ligand and that the integrin be activated (17Garcia A.J. Huber F. Boettiger D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10988-10993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 24Enomoto-Iwamoto M. Menko A.S. Philp N. Boettiger D. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1993; 1: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, for α5β1, the amount of cross-linked integrin recovered was directly proportional to the strength of the interaction measured by the spinning disc assay and the number of receptor-ligand bonds formed (31Garcia A.J. Boettiger D. Biomat. 1999; 20: 2427-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This cross-linking assay provides an alternative assay for the presence of specific integrin-ligand bonds. The data in Fig. 4show both the supernatant fraction (non-cross-linked) and the cross-linked fraction for each integrin subunit. Based on quantitation of three independent experiments, the higher v-Src kinase activity in the HOSnsrc35 cells had no significant effect on the level of cross-linked α5 or β1. This is consistent with the adhesion data, which showed that v-Src activation had minimal effect on α5β1-mediated adhesion. In contrast, the level of αv was reduced about 2-fold, and the level of β3 was reduced about 4-fold in the HOSnsrc35 cells compared with the HOSnsrc39.5 cells. The levels of αv in the cross-linked fraction are low, and the antibody used does not give as clear a Western blot as the others. Nevertheless, these results support the conclusion that αvβ3 function is reduced in the HOSnsrc35 cells. Previous experiments show that activation of v-Src kinase in HOS cells increased the level of β3 phosphorylation and blocked the ability of αvβ3 to mediate adhesion to fibronectin. Both the use of a temperature-sensitive v-Src kinase activity mutant and the relatively low level of v-Src expressed in these cells contribute to the argument that the effect on adhesion is specific to v-Src kinase function. Nevertheless, the correlation between the increase in β3 phosphorylation and reduction of αvβ3 function could be due to the phosphorylation of β3 integrin-associated proteins rather than β3 integrin itself by v-Src kinase. To determine whether phosphorylation of β3 itself was critical for the reduction of αvβ3-mediated adhesion, non-phosphorylatable mutants of β3 integrin were transfected into HOSnsrc35 cells. Both transient transfections and selection of stable transformants were performed. There are two tyrosines in the cytoplasmic domain of β3 at positions 747 and 759 (in the human sequence). Both of these tyrosines are embedded in sequences that are similar to the Tyr-788 region in the cytoplasmic domain of chicken β1 (Tyr-783 human) integrin, which can be phosphorylated by v-Src kinase in vitro (26Tapley P. Horwitz A.F. Buck C.A. Burridge K. Duggan K. Rohrschneider L. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 325-333PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that both Tyr-747 and Tyr-759 in β3 integrin can be phosphorylated in vivo, but definitive data exist only for Tyr-747 (25Blystone S.D. Lindberg F.P. Williams M.P. McHugh K.P. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31458-31462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The transient transfection assays gave the best expression levels at 48 h after transfection, but we found that the cells recovering from various transfection protocols were too fragile to be assayed in the spinning disc assay at 48 h. As an alternative, the relative proportion of active-fibronectin-bound β3 integrin was determined using the chemical cross-linking demonstrated above. HOSnsrc35 cells were transiently transfected with WT β3or β3(Y747F) and analyzed 48 h later by flow cytometry for expression of β3 and by chemical cross-linking to fibronectin for αvβ3function. Fig. 5 shows that both WT β3 and β3(Y747F) transfectants had increased β3 expression about 2-fold. Analysis of cross-linked β3 showed about 4-fold higher levels of β3 in the β3Y(747F) mutant compared with WT β3. By blocking the ability of the cells to phosphorylate Tyr-747 in β3 integrin, more β3 integrin was incorporated into the ligand-bound fraction. Thus the mutant was able to complement the defect in β3 integrin function caused by v-Src kinase activation. In two separate experiments, stable transfectants were isolated for HOSnsrc35 cells expressing WT β3, β3(Y747F), β3(Y759F), and β3("
https://openalex.org/W1984820480,"A role for uncoupling protein (UCP) homologues in mediating the proton leak in mammalian mitochondria is controversial. We subjected insulinoma (INS-1) cells to adenoviral expression of UCP2 or UCP1 and assessed the proton leak as the kinetic relationship between oxygen use and the inner mitochondrial membrane potential. Cells were infected with different amounts of rat UCP2, and, in other experiments, with either UCP2 or UCP1. The relative molar expression of these subtypes was quantified through comparison with histidine-tagged UCP1 or UCP2 proteins engineered by expression in Escherichia coli. Adenoviral infection with UCP2, compared with β-galactosidase, resulted in a dose-dependent shift in kinetics indicating increased H+ flux at any given membrane potential. UCP1 also enhanced H+ flux, but, on a relative molar basis, the overexpression of the endogenous protein, UCP2, was more potent than UCP1. These results were not due to nonspecific overexpression of mitochondrial protein since UCP1 activity was inhibited by GDP and because overexpression of another membrane carrier protein, the oxoglutarate malate carrier had no effect. UCP2-mediated H+ conduction was not GDP sensitive. These data suggest that the UCP homologue, UCP2, mediates the proton leak in mitochondria of a mammalian cell wherein UCP2 is the native subtype. A role for uncoupling protein (UCP) homologues in mediating the proton leak in mammalian mitochondria is controversial. We subjected insulinoma (INS-1) cells to adenoviral expression of UCP2 or UCP1 and assessed the proton leak as the kinetic relationship between oxygen use and the inner mitochondrial membrane potential. Cells were infected with different amounts of rat UCP2, and, in other experiments, with either UCP2 or UCP1. The relative molar expression of these subtypes was quantified through comparison with histidine-tagged UCP1 or UCP2 proteins engineered by expression in Escherichia coli. Adenoviral infection with UCP2, compared with β-galactosidase, resulted in a dose-dependent shift in kinetics indicating increased H+ flux at any given membrane potential. UCP1 also enhanced H+ flux, but, on a relative molar basis, the overexpression of the endogenous protein, UCP2, was more potent than UCP1.

The active protein dissipates the proton electrochemical gradient generated by electron transport by movement of hydrogen ions across the inner mitochondrial membrane to the matrix side. Although the exact mechanism of UCP1-mediated transport remains controversial, fatty acids play a role and proton transfer is inhibited by guanidine or adenine nucleotides (1Nicholls D.G. Locke R.M. Physiol. Rev. 1984; 64: 1-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar, 2Klingenberg M. Echtay K.S. Bienengraeber M. Winkler E. Huang S.G. Int. J. Obes. 1999; 23: S24-S29Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). More recently UCP1 homologues including UCP2 and long and short forms of UCP3 (UCP3L and UCP3S) have been identified. There is evidence that these proteins also function to dissipate the proton electrochemical gradient, however, this issue is controversial (3Brand M.D. Brindle K.M. Buckingham J.A. Harper J.A. Rolfe D.F. Stuart J.A. Int. J. Obes. 1999; 23: S4-S11Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 4Bouillaud F. Int. J. Obes. 1999; 23: S19-S23Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The issue of whether UCP homologues mediate the proton leak is particularly uncertain for mammalian cells since studies of expressed UCP homologues have largely been carried out in yeast and proteoliposomes (3Brand M.D. Brindle K.M. Buckingham J.A. Harper J.A. Rolfe D.F. Stuart J.A. Int. J. Obes. 1999; 23: S4-S11Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 4Bouillaud F. Int. J. Obes. 1999; 23: S19-S23Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the current studies, we assessed the effect of adenoviral overexpression of UCP2 on the proton leak in mitochondria isolated from rat insulinoma (INS-1) cells, a mammalian cell line in which UCP2 is present as a native protein. To accomplish this, the proton leak was measured as the kinetic relationship between oxygen use and the inner mitochondrial membrane potential under conditions wherein oxygen use is leak-dependent and proportional to H+ transport. To our knowledge, these are the first cellular studies to use this approach for assessment of the effect of an overexpressed UCP homologue on leak-dependent H+ conductance in mammalian mitochondria. INS-1 cells were selected for these studies based on prior work in our laboratory (5Hong Y.S. Fink B.D. Dillon J.S. Sivitz W.I. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) demonstrating that UCP2 overexpression enhanced state 4 mitochondrial respiration, decreased the mitochondrial ADP:O ratio (more oxygen required for phosphorylation of a given quantity of ADP), and decreased cell ATP content. Consistent with these results Chanet al. (6Chan C.B. MacDonald P.E. Saleh M.C. Johns D.C. Marban E. Wheeler M.B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1482-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 7De Chan C.B. Leo D. Joseph J.W. McQuaid T.S. Ha X.F. Xu F. Tsushima R.G. Pennefathner P.S. Salapatek A.M.F. Wheeler M.B. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1302-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) found that adenoviral expression of UCP2 decreased glucose-stimulated insulin release and reduced ATP content in islets of normal rats and reduced membrane potential (rhodamine 123 fluorescence) in βTC6-f7 cells, another insulin secreting line. However, neither state 4 respiration nor potential actually measures the proton leak (3Brand M.D. Brindle K.M. Buckingham J.A. Harper J.A. Rolfe D.F. Stuart J.A. Int. J. Obes. 1999; 23: S4-S11Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In addition, none of the above studies was controlled for possible nonspecific effects of overexpression of mitochondrial membrane protein per se. It also uncertain whether catalysis of the proton leak, within a given cell type, is a property restricted to the naturally expressed UCP(s) within that cell type. Of the known UCP subtypes, UCP2 appears to be native to INS-1 cells as well as to normal pancreatic islets (5Hong Y.S. Fink B.D. Dillon J.S. Sivitz W.I. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 8Wang M.Y. Shimabukuro M. Lee Y. Trinh K.Y. Chen J.L. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1020-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, our current studies also examined the relative specificity of UCP2 compared with UCP1 overexpression on the proton leak in INS-1 cells. To quantify and compare the degree of expression of UCP1 and UCP2, we used histidine-tagged UCP1 and UCP2 molecular constructs as standards to obtain an estimate of the relative molar extent of expression of these two UCP subtypes. In addition, we determined the nucleotide (GDP) sensitivity of the proton leak for these subtypes, an issue that has received little attention in mammalian mitochondria. Beyond the issue of GDP sensitivity per se, we also utilized nucleotide inhibition as a tool for controlling for possible nonspecific effects of overexpressed UCP protein. Finally the issue of nonspecific effects was also addressed through overexpression of another mitochondrial membrane carrier protein, the oxoglutarate malate carrier (OMC) (9Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Palmieri F. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11033-11040Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). PCR primers were obtained through the DNA Core of our Diabetes and Endocrinology Research Center. Affinity purified polyclonal rabbit anti-UCP12-A, directed against a 19-amino acid cytoplasmic, COOH-terminal sequence of mouse and rat UCP1 was purchased from Alpha Diagnostics International (San Antonio, TX). Affinity purified goat anti-UCP2, directed against the identical amino termini of mouse and rat UCP2, was purchased from Research Diagnostics, Inc. (Flanders, NJ). The specific peptides to which these antibodies were raised were purchased from the same manufacturers. Antibody against the OMC was obtained from rabbits immunized with two polypeptides prepared from conserved regions of OMC sequences (Arg48-Ser64 and Asp156-Gly175) and characterized in previous studies (10Scholz T.D. Koppenkafer S.L. Teneyck C.J. Schutte B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C780-C788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Scholz T.D. Teneyck C.J. Schutte B.C. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2000; 32: 1-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Mouse antibody against the six-residue histidine tag, His-probe (H-3), was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Other reagents, kits, and supplies were as specified or purchased from standard sources. The cDNA encoding the full-length rat UCP2 was amplified from isolated spleen total RNA by reverse transcriptase-PCR according to standard methodology (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), ligated into the shuttle plasmid pAd5CMVK-NpA, and grown and purified by the Gene Transfer Vector Core of our institution as we previously described (5Hong Y.S. Fink B.D. Dillon J.S. Sivitz W.I. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Adenoviral UCP1 was engineered by the laboratory of Dr. Michael Brownlee (13Nishikawa T. Edelstein D. Du X.L. Yamagishi S. Matsumura T. Kaneda Y. Yorek M.A. Beebe D. Oates P.J. Hammes H.P. Giardino I. Brownlee M. Nature. 2000; 404: 787-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3670) Google Scholar) at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine using the same shuttle plasmid. These viral particles were grown by our University of Iowa Gene Transfer Vector Core and obtained from the core with the permission of Dr. Brownlee. An identical adenoviral construct, Ad5CMVlacZ, expressing bacterial β-galactosidase rather than UCP1 or UCP2 (5Hong Y.S. Fink B.D. Dillon J.S. Sivitz W.I. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) was obtained from our Gene Transfer Vector Core for use as control. The sense and antisense primers used for constructing the full-length rat OMC clone were: 5′-AGGGCCAT(C/T)(A/G)AG(G/T)GGCGATGGCGGCGA-3′ and 5′-TCAGCCACTGAGGAAGAGACGCT-3′ (positions 1–10 and 943–965, GenBankTM accession number U84727), respectively. The sense primer included an appended Kozak sequence to enhance transcription of the product (14Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4168) Google Scholar). The resulting PCR product was ligated into pCR II (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and transformed into DH5α cells. Following purification of DNA, the full-length OMC clone was excised using a flanking EcoRI site and ligated into the EcoRI restriction site in the shuttle vector pAd5CMVK-NpA. INS-1 cells were kindly provided by Dr. Claes Wolheim (Geneva, Switzerland). Cells were seeded to 100-mm dishes for mitochondrial isolation and 12-well plates for lipid and glucose oxidation. Cells were grown in RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 4 mm l-glutamine, and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Cells were allowed to reach near confluency. In previous work, we described the efficacy of infection for varying viral loads as determined by staining for β-galactosidase (5Hong Y.S. Fink B.D. Dillon J.S. Sivitz W.I. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For studies of membrane potential and respiration, cells were grown in 150-cm2 flasks and virus was applied at the indicated titers for 4 h in the absence of serum. The cells were then washed of virus, medium with 10% serum was added, and the cells were allowed to grow for 18 h. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped. Collected cells were homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer in ice-cold homogenization buffer (0.25m sucrose, 5 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2) with 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min. The pellet was discarded and the supernatant was centrifuged again at 10,000 ×g for 10 min to obtain the mitochondrial pellet. The resulting pellet was then washed three times in homogenization buffer without bovine serum albumin and resuspended in respiration media described below. For immunoblotting, mitochondria were washed as above and homogenized by solubilization in detergent RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 2 mm EDTA). Protein was determined by the Bradford method using a dye reagent purchased from Bio-Rad. Mitochondrial respiration was measured using a Clark miniature oxygen electrode and small (0.6 ml) volume chamber with stir bar (Instech Laboratories, Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA) at 37 °C in respiratory media (220 mm mannitol, 70 mmsucrose, 2.5 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) with 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. Isolated mitochondria (0.7–1.0 mg of protein/ml) were incubated in the respiratory media and oxygen consumption quantified under the conditions indicated. Membrane potential was calculated in millivolts as described (15Kamo N. Muratsugu M. Hongoh R. Kobatake Y. J. Membr. Biol. 1979; 49: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar) from the concentrations inside (Ci) and external (Ce) to the mitochondrial matrix of the lipophilic cation tetraphenyl phosphonium (TPP+) according to the Nernst equation, Δψ =RT/zF · ln Ce/Ci, wherez = valence of cation, T and Fare standard thermodynamic quantities (R designates the gas constant or 8.314 joules/K, T the temperature, andF represents Faraday's constant or 96,494 cal/mol). So, at a temperature of 310 degrees K (37 °C) at one atmosphere and for a univalent cation, Δψ = 61.5 log (Ce/Ci). TPP+ concentrations external to the mitochondria were determined by an electrode sensitive to this cation constructed according to the design described by Kamoet al. (15Kamo N. Muratsugu M. Hongoh R. Kobatake Y. J. Membr. Biol. 1979; 49: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). The sensor membrane was constructed of polyvinylchloride film containing tetraphenyl borate as an ion exchanger. The membrane was glued to the polyvinylchloride tube with tetrahydrofuran. The internal solution was 0.1 mTPP+ and the solution bridged with saturated KCl agar into which was inserted a Ag-AgCl wire. The potential difference between this electrode and a 2-mm Dri-RefTM reference electrode (DRIREF-2SH, World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL) was determined using a potentiometer (mV setting available on a pH standard meter). Both the TPP+ and reference electrodes were inserted into the Clarke chamber through ports drilled by the University of Iowa Biomedical Engineering Department so that membrane potential and oxygen consumption could be recorded simultaneously. Electrode potential was highly sensitive to added TPP+concentrations ranging from 10−7 to 10−1 on a log scale and nearly linear from 10−6 to 10−2. The electrode was not sensitive to other cations including calcium and magnesium. Ce for TPP+ was determined during mitochondrial incubations from the recorded electrode potential based on prior calibration of the electrode as a function of TPP+ added in the absence of mitochondria. Ci is determined from the known amount of TPP+ added (total) and external concentration. To determine Ci, it is also necessary to know the mitochondrial matrix volume and the extent to which TPP+ is bound to mitochondrial protein as opposed to freely present within the matrix. Mitochondrial matrix volumes under the conditions of incubation were determined from exclusion volumes of [3H]H2O and [14C]sucrose (16Dawson A. Klingenberg M. Kramer R. Darley-Usmar V. Rickwood D. Wilson M. Mitochondria, A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 35-78Google Scholar) for mitochondria isolated from INS-1 cells infected with viral titers (3.1 × 106) of UCP1 (with and without 1 mm GDP), UCP2, and β-galactosidase. The binding correction was determined by the difference in measured [3H]TPP+ and [86Rb+] accumulation (17Brown G.C. Brand M.D. Biochemistry. 1988; 252: 473-479Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Valinomycin (320 pmol/mg of mitochondrial protein), as an ionophore, was included so the Rb cation could enter mitochondria. It is important to note (Table I) that there was little difference between matrix volume or binding correction between the mitochondrial groups studied so any error in these measurements would have minimal effect on the comparative studies of membrane potential. Furthermore, due to the logarithmic nature of the Nernst equation, volume and binding differences actually alter Δψ relatively little.Table IMatrix volumes and TPP+ binding corrections for mitochondria isolated from INS-1 cells infected with the indicated adenovirus at a viral load of 3.1 × 106 pfu/cm2Condition (viral protein expressed)Matrix volume (μl/mg mitochondrial protein)TPP+ binding correctionβ-Galactosidase0.94 ± 0.07 (n = 4)0.39 ± 0.04 (n = 4)UCP21.06 ± 0.22 (n = 5)0.38 ± 0.04 (n = 6)UCP11.18 ± 0.22 (n = 4)0.36 ± 0.07 (n = 7)UCP1 (presence of 1 mm GDP)1.27 ± 0.22 (n = 4)0.33 ± 0.07 (n = 7)Values represent mean ± S.E. with the number of repetitions indicated.

The proton leak was assessed as the relationship of H+ flux to mitochondrial membrane potential through simultaneous recording of oxygen consumption and potential. Mitochondria were suspended in respiratory medium and incubated in the presence of 4 μm TPP+(tetraphenyl phosphonium chloride), 2 μm oligomycin to inhibit ATP synthase, 5 μm rotenone to inhibit electron entry at Complex I, and 0.1 μm nigericin to abolish the ΔpH (18Lionetti L. Iossa S. Liverini G. Brand M.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 352: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) across the mitochondrial membrane. H+conductance, under these conditions, is proton leak dependent and, with succinate as fuel, H+ flux follows a 6:1 stoichiometry (H+/O) with oxygen consumed (17Brown G.C. Brand M.D. Biochemistry. 1988; 252: 473-479Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 19Porter R.K. Joyce O.J. Farmer M.K. Heneghan R. Tipton K.F. Andrews J.F. McBennett S.M. Lund M.D. Jensen C.H.

Succinate (5 mm) was added followed by malonate in incremental amounts to final concentrations of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mm to inhibit succinate dehydrogenase, thereby, decreasing electrons available for the transport system and creating a range of membrane potentials (22Brand M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1018: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial protein was separated on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Blots were blocked with 2.5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (T-TBS) for 40 min and incubated overnight at 4 °C with affinity purified antibody to UCP2 (1 μg/ml goat anti-UCP2), UCP1 (0.5 μg/ml rabbit anti-UCP1), 6-residue histidine tag (1 μg/ml mouse His-probe antibody), or OMC (1/20,000 rabbit serum). Blots were washed with T-TBS and exposed to anti-goat (diluted 1:10,000 in 5% nonfat dry milk in T-TBS), anti-rabbit (1:5,000 in T-TBS), or anti-mouse (1:5,000 in 5% nonfat dry milk in T-TBS) horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 40 min at room temperature. Blots were washed again and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence using a standard kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Piscataway, NJ). We previously documented (5Hong Y.S. Fink B.D. Dillon J.S. Sivitz W.I. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 23Sivitz W.I. Fink B.D. Donohoue P.A. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1511-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) the specificity of the antibodies to UCP1 and UCP2 with competition by specific (but, not by nonspecific) peptide to which these antibodies were raised, by demonstration of the appropriate tissue distribution of UCP1 or UCP2 immunoreactivity based on the reported mRNA distribution, and by demonstration of enhanced immunoreactivity in mitochondrial compared with whole cell extracts and lack of cytoplasmic immunoreactivity. For quantitative comparisons of the relative molar extent of UCP1 and UCP2 expression in INS-1 mitochondria, we engineered UCP1 and UCP2 proteins tagged with 6-histidine residues at the amino termini. This was accomplished using a commercially available expression and purification system (QIAexpress, Qiagen). We used standard PCR methodology (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) to clone the insert (coding for the particular UCP) with appropriate 5′ and 3′ extensions into pQE-60 (Qiagen) for bacterial expression. Upstream primers included long (89 bases) sense oligonucleotides encoding (in 5′ to 3′ order) the appropriate restriction site, a ribosomal binding site, ATG, the His6 tag, an enterokinase site, and 22 or 21 residues of the 5′ end of the coding region of UCP1 or UCP2, respectively. Antisense oligonucleotides encoded the downstream restriction site, stop codon, and 18 residues of the 3′ end of the coding region of UCP1 or UCP2. Plasmids (pQE-60) with inserts were verified by fluorescent DNA sequencing by the DNA core of our Diabetes and Endocrinology Research Center. To generate the expressed proteins, M15 Escherichia coliwere transformed with pQE-60 containing the UCP1 or UCP2 insert and grown to A600 = 0.6. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, 1 mm, was added to induce expression. Cells were grown in 2-liter flasks and centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 15 min. Cells were lysed in B-PER reagent (Pierce, Inc.) for 15 min at room temperature, centrifuged at 25,000 × g 15 min, and suspended in B-PER containing lysozyme, 200 μg/ml. After 15 min the lysate was diluted with an equal volume of 1:10 B-PER and centrifuged at 25,000 × g, 15 min. The inclusion bodies were washed three times in 150 mm potassium phosphate, 25 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmATP, pH 7.8, and solubilized in 1.5% Sarkosyl. These bacterial extracts were carefully quantified for protein by triplicate determination using both the Bradford and Lowry techniques (which differed by <5%). The histidine tag immunoreactivity of the tagged UCP1 and UCP2 proteins were then determined by immunoblot analysis. In this way, the relative histidine tag immunoreactivity (“histidine units”) per microgram of protein were determined and used as a measure of the relative molar content of UCP1 or UCP2. The extracts were then employed as standards run in multiple dilutions for quantitative immunobloting to determine the content of UCP1 or UCP2 in histidine units in extracts of the mitochondria employed in the electrochemical assessment of the kinetics of the proton leak. Mitochondrial matrix volumes and the TPP+ binding correction were determined for mitochondria expressing β-galactosidase, UCP1 and UCP2 after exposures to viral titers of 3.1 × 106 plaque-forming units (pfu)/cm2or UCP1 with added GDP (Table I). TPP+ binding was similar for all conditions studied, so an overall mean value was used for correction of the matrix TPP+ concentrations. Likewise, UCP1 and UCP2 protein expression had little effect on matrix volume. Since, there was a slight (nonsignificant) increase in the volumes for mitochondria expressing the uncoupling proteins, the mean determined volumes (for each viral exposure) were used for calculation of membrane potentials for mitochondria from cells expressing the listed proteins. However, using an overall mean value for volume for all conditions studied would have had negligible effects on the data. Thus, for experiments involving UCP2 titers less than 3.1 × 106pfu/cm2, matrix volumes used in the calculations were as indicated for the higher titers. H+ flux as a function of membrane potential was determined in mitochondria isolated from INS-1 cells infected with different viral titers of adenoviral UCP2 or β-galactosidase (Fig.1). Individual data points represent values for both membrane potential and H+ flux for a given amount of added malonate. Thus, error bars represent variation for each measured parameter and are directed along both the x andy axes. Adenoviral infection with UCP2, compared with β-galactosidase, resulted in a dose (viral load)-dependent shift upward and to the left indicating increased H+ flux at any given membrane potential. To better quantify the degree of UCP2 overexpression compared with control, mitochondria from each of the preparations studied were assayed for UCP2 expression by immunoblot analysis. The signal densities were normalized to a dilution series of a standard pooled sample (prepared from mitochondria of a large pool of INS-1 cells infected with adenoviral UCP2) included on each blot. A representative blot indicating the level of expression of UCP2 at each of the viral titers is shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 also shows the quantitative data over three repetitions of this experiment indicating the relative level of overexpression for each of the viral titers. For statistical assessment of the effects of UCP2 to alter potential and proton flux, the data in Fig. 1 were subject to polynomial curve fitting. Each individual curve for each of the viral doses was used to determine the potential at a H+ flux of 90 nmol of H+/min/mg. This value of 90, although arbitrary, represents H+ flux at approximately one-half of the highest (not necessarily maximal) rate recorded (for the highest degree of expressed UCP2) and falls within a range where potential could be assessed at each viral titer or level of UCP expression. Fig.3, panel A, shows that membrane potential at constant proton flux (90 nmol of H+/min/mg) correlated negatively to UCP2 expression (p = 0.001). Each individual curve for each of the viral doses was also used to determine H+ flux at a constant membrane potential. A value of 160 mV was selected since this value falls in a range where flux could be assessed for the various levels of UCP2 expression (Fig. 1). Fig. 3, panel B, shows that proton flux at this constant potential correlated positively to UCP2 expression (p = 0.002). We further examined leak-dependent H+conductance in mitochondria of INS-1 cells as affected by adenoviral overexpression of UCP1, UCP2, and β-galactosidase (Fig.4). For each of these conditions, mitochondria from the same preparation were studied in the presence or absence of 1 mm GDP, a known inhibitor of UCP1-mediated H+ conduction (1Nicholls D.G. Locke R.M. Physiol. Rev. 1984; 64: 1-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar, 2Klingenberg M. Echtay K.S. Bienengraeber M. Winkler E. Huang S.G. Int. J. Obes. 1999; 23: S24-S29Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). As in Fig. 1, oxygen use and potential were determined in mitochondria respiring on succinate in the presence of oligomycin, rotenone, and nigericin. Adenoviral infection with UCP2 or UCP1 compared with β-galactosidase resulted in a marked shift upward and to the left indicating increased H+ flux at any given membrane potential. GDP shifted the curve for UCP1 almost back to the position of β-galactosidase but did not alter the effect of UCP2 overexpression. There did appear to be a slight shift for β-galactosidase, but, this was considerably less than for UCP1, especially at the higher values of H+ flux wherein the S.E. for potential was considerably less. To obtain standards for quantitative comparison of the relative molar amounts of UCP1 and UCP2 expressed by the mitochondria in Fig. 4, we generated histidine-tagged UCP1 and UCP2 by expression in E. coli. We then compared the relative level of immunoreactive histidine tag expression of these bacterial extracts (Fig.5, panel A) and plotted density against micrograms of inclusion body protein (Fig. 5,panel B). We arbitrarily assigned a histidine tag content (histidine units per micrograms of protein) of 100 for the UCP1 preparation. By comparison of the slopes (Fig. 5, panel B), the UCP2 preparation contains 770 histidine units per μg. Note that when the band densities of Fig. 5, panel B, are plotted against micrograms of protein on a log scale (Fig. 5, panel C) the curves are roughly parallel supporting the specificity of the antibody for the His6 epitope.

https://openalex.org/W2053300032,"Nitric oxide-derived reactive species have been implicated in many disorders. Protein nitrotyrosine is often used as a stable marker of these reactive species. Using immunohistochemistry, we have previously detected nitrotyrosine in murine Mutatect tumors, where neutrophils are the principal source of nitric oxide. We now report on the identification of several prominent nitrotyrosine-containing proteins. Using Western blot analysis, nitrotyrosine in higher molecular mass proteins (>20 kDa) was detected in tumors containing a high number of neutrophils but not in tumors with fewer neutrophils. Staining for nitrotyrosine was consistently seen in low molecular mass proteins (≤15 kDa), regardless of the level of neutrophils. Protein nitrotyrosine was not seen in Mutatect cells growing in vitro. Treatment with nitric oxide donors produced nitration of ≤15-kDa proteins, but only after extended periods. These small proteins, both from tumors and cultured cells, were identified by mass spectrometry to be histones. Only a subset of tyrosine residues was nitrated. Selective nitration may reflect differential accessibility of different tyrosine residues and the influence of neighboring residues within the nucleosome. The prominence of histone nitration may reflect its relative stability, making this post-translational modification a potentially useful marker of extended exposure of cells or tissues to nitric oxide-derived reactive species.

Immunoprecipitation has certain limitations; it is limited to proteins for which specific antibodies are available and it cannot identify which specific Tyr residue(s) have been nitrated. Mass spectrometry of tryptic peptides is a sensitive and specific technique to identify proteins. Recently, it has been shown capable of identifying tryptic peptides containing NTyr and also specifying which Tyr has been nitrated (14Greis K.D. Zhu S. Matalon S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 335: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 40Yi D. Smythe G.A. Blount B.C. Duncan M.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 344: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). One recent report describes a technique of localizing nitrated proteins by Western blotting on a two-dimensional gel, followed by mass spectrometry, to identify putative nitrated proteins in tissue samples (41Aulak K.S. Miyagi M. Yan L. West K.A. Massillon D. Crabb J.W. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12056-12061Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). However, positive identification of specific tyrosine residues nitrated in vivo has not previously been reported. The Mutatect mouse tumor model is a series of mouse fibrosarcoma-derived cell lines that have been engineered to express human interleukin-8 in a regulatable fashion (42Haqqani A.S. Sandhu J.K. Birnboim H.C. Neoplasia. 2000; 2: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Cells are injected into syngeneic mice where they grow as subcutaneous tumors. Mutatect tumors are infiltrated with inflammatory cells, predominantly neutrophils (43Sandhu J.K. Privora H.F. Wenckebach G. Birnboim H.C. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 509-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The number of neutrophils correlates with the number of mutations arising in the tumor cells (42Haqqani A.S. Sandhu J.K. Birnboim H.C. Neoplasia. 2000; 2: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 43Sandhu J.K. Privora H.F. Wenckebach G. Birnboim H.C. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 509-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We have recently shown by immunohistochemistry that tumor-infiltrating neutrophils express inducible nitric-oxide synthase and that protein NTyr is present in these experimental tumors (43Sandhu J.K. Privora H.F. Wenckebach G. Birnboim H.C. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 509-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the present report, we detect NTyr-containing proteins in Mutatect tumors using Western blot analysis, but also use mass spectrometric analysis to unambiguously identify some prominent nitrated proteins, including localization of specific Tyr residues that have been nitrated. Mutatect cells were originally derived from a subcutaneously growing fibrosarcoma that had been induced by methylcholanthrene in a C57BL mouse (44Wilkinson D. Sandhu J.K. Breneman J.W. Tucker J.D. Birnboim H.C. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 72: 1234-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The properties of Mutatect TM-28 and TM-34 cells, engineered to secrete the neutrophil chemoattractant, interleukin-8, have been described elsewhere (42Haqqani A.S. Sandhu J.K. Birnboim H.C. Neoplasia. 2000; 2: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Cell cultures were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen, Burlington, Canada) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% O2 at 37 °C. Mutatect tumors were formed by subcutaneous injection of TM-28 or TM-34 cells into syngeneic, 8–10-week-old C57BL/6 female mice and excised after 3 weeks. Other details have been described earlier (42Haqqani A.S. Sandhu J.K. Birnboim H.C. Neoplasia. 2000; 2: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). All animal experiments were carried out at the Animal Resources facility of the Institute for Biological Sciences, National Research Council in Ottawa in accordance with guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care. The NO⋅ donors used were either glyceryl trinitrate (David Bull Laboratories, Canada) or sodium nitroprusside (SNP; Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals, St. Louis, MO), since they have been previously found to be mutagenic toward Mutatect cells (45Sandhu J.K. Birnboim H.C. Mutat. Res. 1997; 379: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). 2 × 105 cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes; after cultures were established, the NO⋅ donating drug was added. Where exposure was limited to 24 h, 0.5 mm glyceryl trinitrate or 1.0 mmSNP was used. At this time of exposure and at these concentrations, the drugs caused 30% cytotoxicity, as determined by trypan blue staining. For longer-term exposures (1–14 days), SNP was used at a lower concentration, 0.1 mm. Culture medium and drug were replaced and cells were subcultured every 3 days. At this concentration, SNP caused only about a 10% reduction in the rate of cell growth. Before harvesting the cells for protein analysis, the plates were washed to remove any detached cells, and the adherent viable cells were harvested by trypsin treatment. Harvested cells were >90% viable as determined by trypan blue exclusion at all times shown. These treated cells and corresponding control cultures were used for protein analysis. The flux of NO⋅ generated in the culture media of Mutatect cells from SNP was estimated by the measurement of the accumulated nitrite levels using the Griess reagent, as described earlier (45Sandhu J.K. Birnboim H.C. Mutat. Res. 1997; 379: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.0005% bromphenol blue, 125 mm MOPS, pH 6.8) and boiled for 5–10 min. For extraction of nuclei, cells were swelled in nuclei extraction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mg/ml aprotinin), incubated on ice for 20 min, and then homogenized with a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 400 × g, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, sonicated, and heated at 100 °C for 5–10 min. Protein from tumors was isolated by homogenization and then sonication (in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mg/ml aprotinin); the homogenate was diluted in SDS sample buffer and heated at 100 °C for 5–10 min. Fluorescamine was used to quantify protein (46Udenfriend S. Stein S. Bohlen P. Dairman W. Leimgruber W. Weigele M. Science. 1972; 178: 871-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2202) Google Scholar). NTyr-containing bovine serum albumin (BSA) was prepared by incubating BSA (6 mg/ml) in 10 mm NaNO2, 9 μm FeCl3, 0.3% H2O2, and 20 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.6) for 24 h at room temperature. All protein extracts were resolved on a 12% discontinuous SDS-PAGE and either stained with Coomassie Blue Brilliant R-250 (Sigma-Aldrich) or electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Nepean, Canada) using an improved transfer procedure. 2A. S. Haqqani and H. C. Birnboim, manuscript in preparation. Membranes were stained with Ponceau S (Sigma-Aldrich) to detect the transferred proteins and the molecular weight standards. Where indicated, membranes were incubated with 20 mmNa2S2O4 to chemically reduce NTyr residues (NO2-Tyr) to NH2-Tyr (1Beckmann J.S. Ye Y.Z. Anderson P.G. Chen J. Accavitti M.A. Tarpey M.M. White R. Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler. 1994; 375: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). Membranes were washed twice in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 8), and then blocked with 2% BSA for 30–45 min. Anti-NTyr rabbit polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) was diluted at 1:2000 in TBST and incubated with the membranes for 1 h. Membranes were washed 4 times in TBST and then incubated for 1 h with secondary antibody (alkaline phosphatase-linked goat anti-rabbit IgG; Kirkgaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) diluted 1:1000 in TBST. Membranes were washed 4 times with TBST and then developed by using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate (Sigma-Aldrich). The neutrophil content in tumors was estimated by quantifying the level of myeloperoxidase, a neutrophil-specific marker. Details of extraction of myeloperoxidase from tumor fractions have been previously described (42Haqqani A.S. Sandhu J.K. Birnboim H.C. Neoplasia. 2000; 2: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). An assay specific for myeloperoxidase was used (47Haqqani A.S. Sandhu J.K. Birnboim H.C. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 273: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The frequency of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (hprt−) mutants was measured in cells growingex vivo as described previously (42Haqqani A.S. Sandhu J.K. Birnboim H.C. Neoplasia. 2000; 2: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Protein extracts were first resolved by SDS-PAGE (20 μg/lane) and silver stained as previously described (48Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar). The protein bands of ≤15 kDa were excised and in gel-digested with modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) without reduction/alkylation. The digested peptides were first analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) using a Voyager Elite STR (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA). The peptide mass fingerprints were used to search a non-redundant protein sequence database (NCBI) using MassFitTM (Protein ProspectorTM). Tryptic digests of ≤15 kDa proteins from SNP-exposed Mutatect nuclear extracts were analyzed by capillary liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (CapLC-MS/MS) using a hybrid quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer (Q-TOFMS, Micromass, Manchester, UK). The extracts were resolved on a 0.3 mm × 15 cm PepMap C18capillary column (Dionex/LC-Packings, San Francisco, CA) using a gradient (5–95% acetonitrile 0.2% formic acid in 30 min, 3.5 μl/min) supplied by a CapLC HPLC pump (Waters Inc., Millford, MA). The mass spectrometer was set to operate in automatic MS/MS switching mode. MS/MS spectra were obtained only on doubly and triply protonated ions. These were then used to automatically search protein sequence databases using the manufacturers database searching software (ProteinProbeTM). Tryptic digests of ≤15-kDa proteins from Mutatect tumor extracts were analyzed by nanoelectrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (nESI-MS/MS) using the Q-TOFMS. Approximately, one-third of the digest extracts were desalted using C18 ZipTipsTM (Millipore Inc., Bedford, MA). Desalted extracts were then loaded into gold-coated nanoelectrospray needles (Micromass). nESI-MS/MS analysis was carried out on all the peptide ions observed in each sample. Database searching was carried out as described above. Typically, nitrated and heavily oxidized peptides were not matched by the automated database searching program. In these cases, their MS/MS spectra were examined manually to determine the sequence of the peptide and the site(s) of modification. We have previously reported on the presence of protein NTyr in Mutatect tumors by immunohistochemical analysis using an anti-NTyr antibody. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear staining in tumor cells was observed (43Sandhu J.K. Privora H.F. Wenckebach G. Birnboim H.C. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 509-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To examine in more detail the nature of the NTyr-containing proteins, Mutatect tumor homogenates were analyzed by Western blot analysis using an anti-NTyr antibody. A number of nitrated proteins, ranging in size from large to small, were detected (Fig.1A). The distribution of NTyr-containing proteins was similar, but not identical, to the distribution of protein detected by Coomassie Blue staining. This suggested that some proteins were preferentially modified. The most prominent examples were ≤15 kDa proteins, presumed to be histones. These results were compared with extracts of cultured Mutatect cells. The difference between tumor extracts and cultured cell extracts was striking (Fig. 1A). In cultured cell extracts, there was only weak staining, limited to proteins of high molecular mass (>50 kDa); no nitration of ≤15-kDa proteins was detectable. The specificity of staining by the anti-NTyr antibody on Western blots was demonstrated by (i) comparing chemically nitrated and unmodified bovine albumin (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2); (ii) absence of staining with secondary antibody alone (data not shown); and (iii) absence of staining after chemical reduction with Na2S2O4 of NTyr to aminotyrosine residues (Fig. 1C, NTyr panel). The chemical reduction did not affect the antigenicity of an unrelated protein (thymidylate synthase in HeLa cell extracts), detected using a specific polyclonal antibody (49Haqqani A.S. Cowling R.T. Maroun J.A. Birnboim H.C. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1563-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) (lane 4 in Fig. 1, B andC). These results indicate that a large number of proteins, including ≤15-kDa proteins, are nitrated in subcutaneous Mutatect tumors in mice but not in cultured Mutatect cells. We have previously established that tumor-infiltrating neutrophils are the primary source of NO⋅ in Mutatect tumors and that the number of neutrophils correlates with the number of mutations arising at the hprt locus (42Haqqani A.S. Sandhu J.K. Birnboim H.C. Neoplasia. 2000; 2: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 43Sandhu J.K. Privora H.F. Wenckebach G. Birnboim H.C. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 509-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The level of neutrophil infiltration into Mutatect TM-34 tumors can be regulated by the administration of tetracycline, since TM-34 cells express a neutrophil chemokine (interleukin-8) from a tetracycline-responsive (“Tet-off”) promoter (42Haqqani A.S. Sandhu J.K. Birnboim H.C. Neoplasia. 2000; 2: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The neutrophil content (as measured by myeloperoxidase, a neutrophil-specific marker) varied 16-fold as function of tetracycline added to the drinking water of tumor-bearing mice (Fig. 2A). Tumors from tetracycline-treated animals (lanes 1–6, Fig.2A) had an average neutrophil content that was about 5% the level found in TM-34 tumors from animals receiving no tetracycline (bars 7–11, Fig. 2A). This difference in neutrophils, resulting from the down-regulation of interleukin-8 by tetracycline, was associated with a similar difference in the number ofhprt− mutants in the same two groups. The average number of mutants was 450-fold higher in the untreated compared with the tetracycline-treated tumor group (Fig. 2B; note the use of a log-scale). To provide further evidence that neutrophil infiltration into tumors is associated with an increase in RNOS, we performed Western blot analysis on tumor extracts using an anti-NTyr antibody. The number of NTyr-containing proteins differed greatly in tumor samples with a high neutrophil content compared with samples with a low content (Fig. 2C). Tumors with low neutrophil content had a low number of NTyr-containing proteins, which were predominantly ≤15 kDa (Fig. 2C, lanes 1–6); nitration of protein bands at 32 and 34 kDa, consistent with positions for mouse histone H1, were also detected in some tumors. Conversely, tumors with high neutrophil content had a very high number of NTyr-containing proteins, which included proteins of both high and low molecular masses (Fig. 2C, lanes 7–11). These results are consistent with the notion that tumor-infiltrating neutrophils are the principal source of RNOS in Mutatect tumors. The data of Fig. 1Aindicate that Mutatect cells, cultured under standard conditions, contain a relatively low level of nitrated proteins. Because a high number of nitrated proteins could be detected in Mutatect tumors but not in cultures (Fig. 1A), we tested whether NTyr could be formed after exposure of cultured cells to a NO⋅ donating drug. Mutatect TM-28 cells were cultured in the presence of SNP and cell lysates were subsequently analyzed by Western blotting using the anti-NTyr antibody. Exposure for 24 h to 1.0 mm SNP led to nitration of >40-kDa proteins (Fig.3A). Similar results were obtained after exposing cells for 24 h to 0.5 mmglyceryl trinitrate (data not shown). However, in contrast to tumor extracts (Figs. 1 and 2), ≤15 kDa proteins were not nitrated. We therefore examined the possibility that a longer in vitroexposure (>24 h) t"

We fused the ectodomain of human LH or FSH receptors to the transmembrane region of fly LGR2. The chimeric human/fly receptors, unlike their wild type counterparts, exhibited ligand-independent constitutive activity. Because ectodomains likely interact with exoloops to constrain the receptors, individual exoloops of the chimeric receptor containing the ectodomain of the LH receptor and transmembrane region of fly LGR2 was replaced with LH receptor sequences. Chimeric receptors with the ectodomain and exoloop 2, but not exoloop 1 or 3, from LH receptors showed decreases in constitutive activity, but ligand treatment stimulated cAMP production. Furthermore, substitution of key resides in the hinge region of fly LGR2 with LH receptor sequences led to constitutive receptor activation; however, concomitant substitution of the homologous exoloop 2 of the LH receptor decreased G(s) coupling. These results suggest that the hinge region of the LH receptor interacts with exoloop 2 to constrain the receptor in an inactive conformation whereas ligand binding relieves this constraint, leading to G(s) activation."

PSD-95, one of the major postsynaptic density proteins, is composed of three PDZ domains (PDZ1, PDZ2, and PDZ3), an SH3 domain, and a GK (guanylate kinase ) domain.

We introduced missense and deletion mutations into PDZ1 (PDZ1mΔ) and/or PDZ2 (PDZ2mΔ) of the full-length PSD-95 to disrupt the association of each domain with the target proteins, while preserving the overall structure. The ion channel clustering activities of the PSD-95 mutants were analyzed in COS-1 cells coexpressing each mutant and Kv1.4. The mutant bearing the dysfunctional PDZ2 (PSD-95:1-2mΔ) showed significantly reduced clustering efficiency, whereas the mutant with the dysfunctional PDZ1 (PSD-95:1mΔ-2) exhibited activity comparable with the wild-type activity. Furthermore, we also examined the requirements for the position of PDZ2 in full-length PSD-95 by constructing a series of PDZ1-PDZ2 inversion mutants.

More than 30 proteins have been identified that associate with these specialized submembraneous structures, referred to as postsynaptic density (PSD)1(2Walikonis R.S. Jensen O.N. Mann M.

Strong support for the role of PSD-95 as a central organizer is found in its ion channel clustering activity. When PSD-95 is expressed heterologously together with the Shaker-type K+ channel (Kv1.4) or NMDA glutamate receptors, the expressed proteins become colocalized in plaque-like clusters (12Kim E.

Structure studies of PDZ2 and PDZ3 revealed that both domains consist of a similar six-stranded, anti-parallel β-barrel flanked by two α-helices, forming a ligand binding pocket between βB and αB, with the exception that PDZ1 and PDZ2 have longer variable loops connecting βB and βC than that of PDZ3 (Fig. 1B) (26Tochio H.

Furthermore, previously reported differences in the biochemical properties between PDZ1 and PDZ2 include the following: (i) PSD-95 PDZ2 exhibits a higher affinity for the target peptides corresponding to the C-terminal sequences of Kv1.4 and NR2B than PDZ1 (24Niethammer M.

Shang J. Fukushima T. Fallon J.R. Garner C.C. Marshall J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 727-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). However, the intramolecular interactions between the SH3 and GK-like domains in the full-length PSD-95 are also required for the clustering of Kv1.4 (40McGee A.W. Bredt D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17431-17436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 41Shin H. Hsueh Y.-P. Yang F.-C. Kim E. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3580-3587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the binding of the GK-like domain to MAP1A is stimulated by peptides corresponding to the C-terminal sequences of Kv1.4, NR2B, and CRIPT (33Brenman J.E. Topinka J.R. Cooper E.C. McGee A.W. Rosen J. Milroy T. Ralston H.J. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8805-8813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to understand the molecular mechanisms of PSD-95 and ion channel clustering, the roles of each domain should also be assessed using full-length PSD-95 molecules. Because PDZ1 and PDZ2 in PSD-95 are fundamental to the clustering of Kv1.4 or NR2B, we analyzed the functional differences between PDZ1 and PDZ2 in the channel clustering. Here, we introduced mutations and deletions into PDZ1 and/or PDZ2 of the full-length PSD-95 based on the reported structure and also constructed a series of PDZ1-PDZ2 inversion mutants, so that the mutated domains were impaired in channel binding but the overall structures of each PDZ domain and the full-length PSD-95 remained more or less intact. These mutants were further evaluated for their Kv1.4 clustering activity in COS-1 cells. The results show that PDZ2 is a key domain for Kv1.4 clustering and that the ligand binding function of PDZ, within the second domain, is essential for developing plaque-like clusters. In addition, the introduced mutations and loop deletions increased the sensitivity to trypsin, suggesting the compact molecular packing of PSD-95. These results imply the importance of the intramolecular interactions of PSD-95 for ion channel clustering. The PSD-95, NR2B, and Kv1.4 cDNAs were acquired from mouse whole brain by reverse transcriptase-mediated PCR using appropriate oligonucleotides as primers. The isolated PSD-95 and NR2B cDNAs, and also Kv1.4 cDNA, were subcloned into theNheI-NotI and XhoI-EcoRI sites of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), respectively. The obtained cDNAs contained several mutations resulting in amino acid substitutions L73F, V496M, L805I, and T1043A in NR2B and E126G, T395P, L465P, and D636E in Kv1.4, compared with the published cDNAs (42Mori H.

The c-Myc tag (EQKLISEEDL) was inserted between amino acid residues 27 and 28 of the NR2B using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. FLAG-tagged PSD-95 was constructed by inverse PCR using primers encoding the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) and the stop codon. The cDNA was introduced into theNheI and EcoRI sites of pcDNA3.1. TheKpnI, SacII, and AflII sites were introduced before the PDZ1 gene, between thePDZ1 and PDZ2 genes, and after thePDZ2 gene, respectively, to construct a series of PDZ1-PDZ2 inverted PSD-95 mutants. Mutant PDZ domains PDZ1Δ, PDZ2Δ, PDZ1mΔ, and PDZ2mΔ (Fig. 1B) were constructed by a general mutagenesis method using PCR. To construct the GST-fused PDZ domains, PDZ1, PDZ2, PDZ1Δ, PDZ2Δ, PDZ1mΔ, and PDZ2mΔ were PCR-amplified and subcloned between the XhoI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-4T3 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). GST-fused PDZ domains were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 strains. Bacteria were harvested and lysed in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 100 μg/ml lysozyme, 100 μg/ml DNase I, and protease inhibitors. Lysates were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h and pelleted at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. The bacterial supernatants were incubated with a 200-μl bed volume of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) at 4 °C for 1 h and washed three times with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and 10% glycerol. The bound proteins were eluted with 10 mm glutathione and dialyzed against binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100) at 4 °C. COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Before transfection, COS-1 cells were seeded on serum-coated cover glasses for clustering assays or in 100-mm plates for GST pull-down and immunoprecipitation assays and were cultured overnight. For clustering assays, cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. The calcium phosphate-DNA mixtures were added within 24 h of seeding and were left for 18–24 h. The cells were shocked with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and were incubated at 37 °C for additional 24 h. For GST pull-down and immunoprecipitation assays, COS-1 cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's procedures. For the GST pull-down assay, NR2B- or Kv1.4-expressing COS cells were lysed in binding buffer 2 days after transfection. The cell lysates were mixed with beads previously bound with either the GST or GST-fused PDZ domain (∼30 μg) at 4 °C for 2 h and were washed four times with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and 10% glycerol. The bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting or silver staining. For the immunoprecipitation assay, cells expressing Kv1.4 or each PSD-95 protein were solubilized separately in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitors. The solubilized supernatants of Kv1.4 and each PSD-95 mutant were mixed and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. Then, monoclonal anti-Kv1.4 antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology) or polyclonal anti-FLAG epitope antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) (∼2 μg) were added to the mixtures, which were further incubated overnight at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose resin (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) was added, and the mixtures were incubated for 1 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed, eluted with SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by immunoblotting. Transfected COS-cells expressing each PSD-95 protein were homogenized, and the postnuclear supernatants were further centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min. The obtained membrane suspensions (∼1.7 mg/ml protein) were treated with trypsin (∼28 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 5, 60, and 120 min. Twenty μl of each reaction were mixed with SDS sample buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting with a monoclonal anti-PSD-95 antibody (M16) (Transduction Laboratories) with an epitope in the region of 353–504. An anti-FLAG antibody and a monoclonal anti-PSD-95 antibody (7E3-1B8) (Affinity Bioreagents, Inc.) were also used, although the 7E3 antibody did not recognize PDZ2Δ mutant because of the epitope deletion. Both antibodies gave similar patterns in which the bands larger than ∼60 kDa were more sensitive to trypsin than those of the wild-type. For the limited digestion of PSD-95, Pronase, papain, and V8 were also examined. Because of the many digestion sites, we could not detect useful limited fragments under the conditions employed. Two days after transfection, the cells grown on coverslips were washed with ice-chilled PBS containing 1 mmMgCl2 and 1 mm CaCl2 and were fixed with the same buffer containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were then washed with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and were incubated with the same buffer containing 50 mm glycine to quench the reactions. Nonspecific protein binding was blocked by an incubation with blocking buffer (PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100) for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were then added to the blocking buffers, and the mixture was incubated for 3 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The samples were washed with blocking buffer, labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature, and washed again three times with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Finally, the coverslips were mounted on slides, and images were obtained with a Zeiss LSM Pascal laser scanning confocal microscope system. The cells shown in Fig. 5, c andf, were observed with an Olympus BX50 microscope. Clustering assays were repeated 4–5 times. For each assay, the number of cells that formed plaque-like clusters was counted among 50–100 cells coexpressing mutant PSD-95 and Kv1.4. The clusters in COS cells were judged referring to the published patterns (12Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M.

The clustering efficiencies were calculated as cluster-formed cells/coexpressed cells, and the results from repeated experiments were averaged. The PDZ1, PDZ2, and PDZ3 domains exhibit distinct ligand specificities, and yet they form similar structures. As compared with PDZ3, PDZ1 and PDZ2 have an additional six-residue insertion in a variable loop connecting βB and βC (Fig. 1B). To disrupt the interactions of PDZ1 and PDZ2 with the Shaker-type K+ channel, Kv1.4, without affecting the overall structure, we first deleted these six residues in the βB/βC loop of PDZ1 (PDZ1Δ) and PDZ2 (PDZ2Δ) to make them resemble PDZ3. Although the interactions of the PDZ domains and NR2B were significantly impaired by the deletions (Fig. 1C), these constructs still exhibited weak but detectable levels of interactions in vitro (Fig.2B). Therefore, Ser-78 and Ala-80 in the βB of PDZ1, and Ser-173 and Ala-175 in the βB of PDZ2 were further mutated to asparagine and valine, the corresponding residues of PDZ3, respectively (Fig. 1B), because βB is part of a ligand binding pocket and the corresponding N326 in PDZ3 is important for its specific binding to CRIPT (24Niethammer M. Valtschanoff J.G. Kapoor T.M. Allison D.W. Weinberg R.J. Craig A.M. Sheng M. Neuron. 1998; 20: 693-707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Each wild-type or mutant PDZ domain, fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST), was examined for an interaction with Kv1.4 in vitro (Fig.1D). Neither PDZ1mΔ nor PDZ2mΔ showed detectable binding activity to Kv1.4. Thus, the βB/βC loops and the mutated residues play important roles in the specific binding of PDZ1 and PDZ2 to Kv1.4. The PDZ1Δ, PDZ2Δ, PDZ1mΔ, and/or PDZ2mΔ domains were then replaced with the wild-type domains of full-length PSD-95. Fig. 2A shows the mutants constructed in this study. PSD-95:1mΔ-2 was constructed by replacing PDZ1 of PSD-95 with PDZ1mΔ, whereas PDZ2 was replaced with PDZ2mΔ in PSD-95:1-2mΔ, and both PDZ domains were replaced in PSD-95:1mΔ-2mΔ (Fig.2A, middle). In addition, a FLAG epitope tag was attached to the C termini of the mutated PSD-95 proteins for their detection. The expression level of the FLAG-tagged PSD-95 was comparable with that of the untagged PSD-95. Hereafter, FLAG-tagged PSD-95 was used as the wild type. The expression levels of these mutants were also comparable with that of the wild-type PSD-95, except for that of PSD-95:1mΔ-2mΔ, which was lower. The ability of these mutant PSD-95 proteins to interact with Kv1.4in vitro were examined by coimmunoprecipitation assays. The mixture of Kv1.4 and the wild-type or mutant PSD-95 was immunoprecipitated with an anti-Kv1.4 antibody, and the coimmunoprecipitated PSD-95 was analyzed. In addition, the wild-type and mutant PSD-95 proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG epitope antibodies, and the coimmunoprecipitated Kv1.4 was analyzed by immunoblotting. The interactions of PSD-95:1Δ-2, 1-2Δ, 1mΔ-2, and 1-2mΔ mutants with Kv1.4 were similar to those of the wild-type (Fig.2, B and C), and PSD-95:1Δ-2Δ interacted weakly. However, no Kv1.4 signal was detected in the PSD-95:1mΔ-2mΔ immunoprecipitate (Fig. 2C). Thus, PSD-95 was able to associate with Kv1.4 as long as either the PDZ1 or PDZ2 domain remained intact. The entire domain assemblies of the PSD-95 mutants were compared with that of the wild-type by limited trypsin digestion. Fig.3 shows the digestion patterns of the wild-type and mutant proteins in the membrane fractions prepared from COS-1 cells expressing each protein, as analyzed by immunoblotting. The full-length and ∼60 kDa bands of the mutants were much more sensitive to trypsin than those of the wild-type, indicating that the βB/βC loop deletion and/or the mutations in βB loosened the molecular packing of PSD-95. It is interesting that the only six-residue deletion in the variable loop and/or the two point mutations of single PDZ domain affect the entire molecular packing of full-length PSD-95. Although the details of entire domain assemblies of the PSD-95 mutants were not clear from this experiment, the patterns of the limited fragments are similar, suggesting that the trypsin-sensitive sites of mutants similar to those of the wild-type were exposed. In addition, because PSD-95:1mΔ-2, which showed wild-type clustering activity, and the other mutants exhibited similar trypsin sensitivity to one another, the deficient clustering activities are not due to the trypsin-sensitive structures. The clustering activities are described later in detail. The wild-type and mutant PSD-95 proteins were coexpressed with Kv1.4 in COS cells, and their cluster-forming activities were examined by indirect immunofluorescence double labeling of transfected cells. In Fig. 4,a and b, individually expressed PSD-95 and Kv1.4 show diffuse and reticular distributions in the transfected cells, respectively. Fig. 4, c1/c2, shows the cell cotransfected with the wild-type PSD-95 and Kv1.4, in which plaque-like protein clusters are notable, as described previously (12Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A.

https://openalex.org/W2083905935,"Ionizing radiation (IR) is known to activate multiple cell cycle checkpoints that are thought to enhance the ability of cells to respond to DNA damage. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) has been implicated in IR-induced activation of checkpoints; therefore, Jurkat cells were exposed to an activating dose of IR or sham treatment as control, and nuclear extracts were analyzed for PP2A by Mono Q anion exchange chromatography and microcystin affinity chromatography. PP2A exists in eukaryotic cells both as a heterodimer consisting of a 65-kDa scaffolding subunit (A) plus a 36-kDa catalytic subunit (C) and as ABC heterotrimers, containing one of a variety of regulatory (B) subunits. Here we show that IR produces a transient and reversible reduction in the amount of nuclear AB55C heterotrimer without affecting the AB′C heterotrimer or AC heterodimer. In ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM)-deficient cells the amount of nuclear PP2A heterotrimer relative to heterodimer was not reduced by radiation, but the radiation response was restored by transfection of these cells with plasmids encoding ATM. Wortmannin, an inhibitor of kinases such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, also prevented the IR-induced reduction in nuclear PP2A heterotrimer. The changes in nuclear PP2A occurred without a noticeable difference in the carboxyl-terminal methylation of the C subunit, which is known to influence association with B subunits. We conclude a novel ATM-dependent mechanism is regulating association of B55 subunits with nuclear PP2A in response to IR.

Many of these responses are controlled by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of Ser and Thr residues in proteins. PP2A is a major protein Ser/Thr phosphatase conserved among eukaryotic species that regulates a variety of key steps in metabolism, replication, transcription, and cell cycle (3Brautigan D.L. Adv.

PP2A has been implicated in the G1/S transition as well as in S phase progression, and genetic and pharmacological evidence shows that it plays a role in mitosis (7Yan Z. Fedorov S.A. Mumby M.C.

Cell. 1993; 72: 621-633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) show defects in the spindle assembly checkpoint and sister chromatid separation, respectively. The precise mechanism by which PP2A regulates the mitotic progression is unclear, although it has been implicated both in the dephosphorylation of substrates of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) as well as in the negative regulation CDK complexes (4Clarke P.R. Hoffmann I. Draetta G. Karsenti E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 397-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 12Mayer-Jaekel R.E. Ohkura H. Ferrigno P. Andjelkovic N. Shiomi K. Uemura T.

It is, therefore, not surprising that PP2A has been implicated in radiation-induced responses, including activation of checkpoints (13Kawabe T. Muslin A.J. Korsmeyer S.J.

PP2A-associated proteins have been shown to function in checkpoint pathways. Hox11, an orphan homeobox protein, binds directly to the catalytic subunit of PP2A, and when it is expressed in Jurkat cells, Hox11 completely abrogates the radiation-induced G2 arrest (13Kawabe T. Muslin A.J. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 454-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Similarly, one isoform of the B56 regulatory subunit of PP2A interacts with paxillin at focal adhesions. When an N-terminally truncated form of this B56 subunit is expressed in 3T3 cells, it abrogates radiation-induced G2arrest (14Ito A. Kataoka T.R. Watanabe M. Nishiyama K. Mazaki Y. Sabe H. Kitamura Y. Nojima H. EMBO. J. 2000; 19: 562-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). PP2A has also been implicated in the UV-induced activation of the G1 checkpoint (15Voorhoeve P.M. Watson R.J. Farlie P.G. Bernards R. Lam E.W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 679-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and a novel PP2A regulatory B subunit, termed PR59, has been shown to control rapid dephosphorylation of p107 (16Voorhoeve P.M. Hijmans E.M. Bernards R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), leading to repression of E2F-dependent transcriptional activity in response to UV. These studies show involvement of PP2A in various damage-sensing pathways. Although PP2A is involved in multiple checkpoints, the mechanism by which it is targeted to diverse substrates in response to radiation is unknown. Within cells there is essentially no catalytic subunit of PP2A (C) in a free, monomeric state (17Goldberg Y. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), because C binds to a 65-kDa scaffolding unit (called A or PR65) made up of 15 imperfect HEAT sequence repeats (18Andrade M.A. Bork P. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 115-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 19Groves M.R. Hanlon N. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Cell. 1999; 96: 99-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). This PP2A heterodimer (AC) can bind to one of several different B subunits to form a variety of ABC heterotrimers. The B subunits are discrete families of proteins (e.g. B55, B56, and B72) that all recognize similar segments of the scaffolding subunit without having significant sequence identity to one another (7Yan Z.

Yeast has two B subunits called Cdc55 and Rts1, and deletion of these genes produces different phenotypes that are not rescued by the other gene (25Shu Y. Yang H. Hallberg E. Hallberg R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3242-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 26Zhao Y. Boguslawski G. Zitomer R.S. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8256-8262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), supporting the concept that the role of the B subunits is to specify the function of different ABC heterotrimers within cells, probably by directing the phosphatase activity to different substrates in different intracellular locales (27Millward T.A. Zolnierowicz S. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 186-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Little is known about the upstream signals regulating the association/dissociation of the B subunits with the AC heterodimer of PP2A. Recent studies in both yeast and mammalian cells indicate that reversible methyl esterification of the carboxyl-terminal Leu residue in the C subunit of PP2A affects the affinity of the AC heterodimer for B subunits (28Tolstykh T. Lee J. Vafai S. Stock J.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5682-5691Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 29Wu J. Tolstykh T. Lee J. Boyd K. Stock J.B. Broach J.R.

Knowledge Environ. 2001; 79: 1-4Google Scholar) have been identified, and deletion of these genes altered the methylation of the C subunit of PP2A and the formation of ABC heterotrimers. Antibodies that selectively recognize the methylated form of the PP2A carboxyl terminus have been a useful tool in studying this reaction. There are reports that methylation of the C subunit of PP2A fluctuates during phases of the cell cycle (33Turowski P. Fernandez A. Favre B. Lamb N.J. Hemmings B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 397-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and differs in the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments, but signals that regulate the pathway of methylation remain unknown. Because the balance between heterotrimer and the heterodimer is expected to play a fundamental role in regulation of the diverse activities of PP2A, we investigated the effect of IR on PP2A distribution between these forms. Here we show that nuclear PP2A is a downstream effector of an ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM)-dependent damage-sensing pathway. Modest doses of ionizing radiation (10 Gy) lead to an acute loss of heterotrimeric PP2A in an ATM-dependent and wortmannin-sensitive manner. Regulatory subunit exchange in response to DNA-damaging agents provides a mechanism by which upstream sensors of DNA damage, such as ATM, could regulate PP2A activity, potentially leading to activation of cell cycle checkpoints. Jurkat cells (a human T cell lymphoma cell line) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) with penicillin and streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum. FT/pEBS7 and FT/pEBS7-YZ5 cells were both derived from the AT22IJE-T line (34Ziv Y. Jaspers N.G. Etkin S. Danieli T. Trakhtenbrot L. Amiel A. Ravia Y. Shiloh Y.

AT22IJE-T cells were transfected with the mammalian expression vector pEBS7 (35Ziv Y. Bar-Shira A. Pecker I. Russell P. Jorgensen T.J. Tsarfati I. Shiloh Y.

FT/pEBS7 and FT/pEBS7-YZ5 were generously provided by Y. Shiloh (Tel Aviv University) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 15% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml hygromycin B. All cells were in an exponential growth phase at the time of radiation. Cell cultures were irradiated with a Varian linear accelerator at a dose rate of 9 Gy per min. During irradiation, the cultures were maintained in a container designed to mimic the conditions of the cell culture incubator (5% CO2and 95% air at 37 °C). Cells were collected by centrifugation in a nuclear preparation buffer consisting of 20 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, and 5 mm EGTA. The cell pellet was resuspended in the same buffer containing 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm PefablocTM, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (complete buffer) at 5 × 105 cells/ml. Digitonin was added to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml to permeabilize the plasma membrane and release the cytosol. The cell suspension was placed on ice for 5 min, then diluted 10-fold in complete nuclear preparation buffer. Following centrifugation, the pellet containing intact nuclei was extracted with nucleus lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant used as nuclear extract. A Mono Q HR5/5 (Amersham Biosciences) column was equilibrated with Buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 30 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). After loading 3 mg of protein of nuclear extract, the column was washed for 16 min (flow rate 0.5 ml/min) with Buffer A followed by a linear gradient to Buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 30 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) more than 29 min, after which the column was washed with buffer B for 15 min. Fractions were collected every min (0.5 ml/fraction). For Western analysis, the protein in each fraction was precipitated with 20% trichloroacetic acid and 0.1% deoxycholate, redissolved in 1× SDS sample buffer, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. A 50% slurry of microcystin-Sepharose (Upstate Biotechnology) or 4 μg of anti-PP2A catalytic subunit (Upstate Biotechnology) coupled to agarose beads were added to nuclear extract containing 500 μg of total protein and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C after which the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer. The protein was then dissociated from the beads with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were run on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Reactive proteins were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies and detected by chemiluminescence. The following commercial antibodies were used: anti-PP2A catalytic subunit (Promega), anti-methyl-PP2A (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-PP2A A subunit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-PP2A B55α subunit and anti-B56γ (Calbiochem). Aliquots (0.1 ml) of each fraction were incubated with 0.3 ml of reaction mixture (20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mmMnCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol at 30 °C as previously described (36Chung H. Nairn A. Murata K. Brautigan D.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10371-10376Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.17 ml of 2.5 m Na2CO3, and optical density was measured at 405 nm. We prepared nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells 30 min after exposure to either 0 or 10 Gy of IR and fractionated the PP2A by Mono Q chromatography. Fractions 30–60 contained two peaks of PP2A activity, measured as okadaic acid-inhibitable phosphatase withp-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate (Fig.1). This pattern was consistent with the chromatographic behavior of PP2A reported by us and others (36Chung H. Nairn A. Murata K. Brautigan D.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10371-10376Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 37Wadzinski B.E. Eisfelder B.J. Peruski L.F. Mumby M.C. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16883-16888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These peaks were the ABC trimers of PP2A (fractions 32–40) preceding the PP2A dimer (fractions 41–60). As shown in Fig. 1 A, in multiple independent experiments, radiation of wild-type Jurkat cells caused the loss of most of the peak of activity of the ABC trimer of PP2A. On the other hand, with AT cells lacking the ATM protein, radiation did not significantly diminish the peak of activity of PP2A trimer, relative to a nonirradiated control (Fig. 1 B). The reduction in PP2A trimer activity was likely because of the known radiation activation of the ATM kinase, because stable transfection of these AT cells with a vector encoding ATM restored the radiation-induced loss of activity of the PP2A heterotrimer (Fig.1 C). Thus, ATM was required for the reduction in the activity of heterotrimer PP2A in response to IR. To assay for distribution of PP2A subunits, proteins in the Mono Q column fractions were acid precipitated and subjected to Western analysis. IR caused a parallel loss in recovery of A, B55α, and C from the peak of heterotrimeric PP2A, as shown in Fig. 2, consistent with the IR-induced loss of the peak of PP2A activity seen in Fig. 1 A. The IR-induced loss of the PP2A trimer peak could be because of several possible mechanisms: 1) nuclear export of the trimer, removing it from the nuclear fraction, or 2) binding of an additional protein that would greatly change or eliminate binding to Mono Q, or 3) dissociation of the B55α subunit from heterotrimeric PP2A because of a covalent modification, competition by another subunit, or proteolytic degradation of the B55. To distinguish between these possibilities, and to examine the kinetics of IR-induced loss of heterotrimer, we utilized additional assays to track the recovery of B55α at various times following IR. Nuclear extracts prepared following irradiation of cells with 10 Gy were subjected to microcystin affinity purification, direct Western analysis, and immunoprecipitation with anti-PP2Ac antibody. Microcystin binds with nanomolar affinity to the catalytic cleft of the PPP class of protein phosphatases (38Damer C.K. Partridge J. Pearson W.R. Haystead T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24396-24405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and rapidly and quantitatively recovers both heterotrimeric as well as heterodimeric PP2A from extracts (36Chung H. Nairn A. Murata K. Brautigan D.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10371-10376Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Microcystin affinity purification of protein phosphatases from nuclear extracts (Fig. 3, top panel) showed a loss of B55α from PP2A heterotrimer that was evident at 15 min, maximal at 30-min postirradiation, and was then completely reversed by 60-min postirradiation. The recovery of the C subunit was the same at all times, serving as a normalization control for protein recovery and loading of the gel. These results were consistent with the reduction of the peak of heterotrimer PP2A seen in Mono Q chromatography in Figs. 1 and 2. There was no change in the total amount of B55 or C subunit of PP2A in the nucleoplasm from cells at any of these times postradiation (Fig. 3). This made it unlikely that either export or degradation of the B55 occurred in response to IR. Additionally, B55 was missing from PP2A recovered by microcystin via binding to the C subunit, excluding the possibility that the change in elution from Mono Q was because of radiation-induced recruitment of another protein onto the AB55C heterotrimer. Thus, the IR-induced loss of B55α seemed to involve a radiation-induced signal leading to transient dissociation of B55α from heterotrimeric PP2A. Interestingly, the association of B56γ, which chromatographs in fractions 9–12 of the Mono Q column, with PP2A showed no change in association with PP2A in the same samples exhibiting a time-dependent loss of B55α after IR (Fig. 3,bottom panel). These results are consistent with IR inducing a specific dissociation of B55α-containing PP2A heterotrimer without affecting the B56 heterotrimer. However, we did not detect an increase in activity of the peak of PP2A dimer (see Fig. 1) or an increase in abundance of the A and C subunits in fractions 41–60 from the Mono Q column, as measured by immunoblot analysis (see Fig. 2). Possibly because the mass and activity of PP2A dimer was much greater than the trimers in these nuclear extracts, we might not have been able to detect a relatively small increase in dimer resulting from conversion of trimer to dimer. Alternatively, a selective subunit exchange reaction could have promoted the dissociation of B55, not B56, and produce a different heterotrimer that did not bind to Mono Q but was still recovered by microcystin or immunoprecipitation. We tested whether wortmannin at the doses known to nonspecifically block checkpoint kinases including DNA-PK and ATM (39Boulton S. Kyle S. Yalcintepe L. Durkacz B.W. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 2285-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) interfered with the IR-induced loss of nuclear PP2A heterotrimer. Jurkat cells in the presence and absence of wortmannin were irradiated with either 0 or 10 Gy, and 30-min postirradiation nuclear extracts were prepared and subjected to microcystin affinity chromatography followed by immunoblot analysis. Fig.4 A shows that wortmannin treatment of the cells completely abrogated IR-induced loss of B55α from heterotrimeric PP2A. Treatment of cells with wortmannin also completely blocked the IR-induced loss of B55α analyzed by Mono Q anion exchange chromatography and immunoblotting (Fig. 4 B). As before, these results concurred from the two independent assays for the AB55C heterotrimer of PP2A. The observation that wortmannin blocked the IR-induced loss of PP2A heterotrimer suggested that dissociation of B55α from ABC trimer might be controlled by checkpoint signaling pathways. To demonstrate that the IR-induced loss of B55α regulatory subunit was ATM-dependent, AT fibroblasts transfected with either an empty vector or with a vector containing full-length wild-type ATM (35Ziv Y. Bar-Shira A. Pecker I. Russell P. Jorgensen T.J. Tsarfati I. Shiloh Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) were irradiated with 10 Gy. Nuclear extracts were subjected to Mono Q chromatography and analyzed by Western blotting. AT fibroblasts demonstrated minimal loss of B55α from nuclear PP2A heterotrimer, as shown in Fig. 5. However, AT cells ectopically expressing full-length ATM behaved like Jurkat cells (see Fig. 2), with a significant loss of the B55α subunit from the PP2A heterotrimer in response to IR. Evidence suggests that methyl esterification of the conserved C-terminal residue Leu plays an important role in promoting assembly of PP2A heterotrimer (28Tolstykh T. Lee J. Vafai S. Stock J.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5682-5691Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 29Wu J. Tolstykh T. Lee J. Boyd K. Stock J.B. Broach J.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5672-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). AC dimers are the preferred substrate of PP2A methyltransferase, and methylation promotes the stability of ABC holoenzymes. The IR-induced loss of PP2A trimer in an ATM-dependent manner suggested the possibility that ATM could be affecting the activity of either PP2A methyltransferase or methylesterase. We tested if the IR-induced loss of PP2A B55α-containing trimer involved methylation/demethylation of Leu-309. Jurkat cells were radiated or sham-irradiated. Nuclear extracts were prepared and subjected to microcystin affinity chromatography. Eluted proteins were immunoblotted with a Leu-309 (methylester)-specific PP2A antibody. Even at IR doses far exceeding the dose required to cause loss of the B55α subunit from the ABC heterotrimer, IR did not change methylation of C subunit of PP2A, as shown in Fig. 6. AT cells and reconstituted AT cells expressing ATM also failed to show changes in methylation following IR (data not shown). Thus, IR-induced changes in AB55C heterotrimer cannot be explained by changes in PP2A methylation. PP2A participates in a diverse set of cellular events including DNA replication, metabolism, transcription, and activation of cell cycle checkpoints. How PP2A plays such diverse roles is unknown, although it is thought that the regulatory B subunits serve a critical function by targeting the PP2A heterotrimer and affecting substrate specificity (12Mayer-Jaekel R.E. Ohkura H. Ferrigno P. Andjelkovic N. Shiomi K. Uemura T. Glover D.M. Hemmings B.A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2609-2616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). Although controversial, there is evidence that both ABC trimers and AC dimers exist in cells (41Kremmer E. Ohst K. Kiefer J. Brewis N. Walter G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1692-1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The loss of B55α subunit from heterotrimers provides a possible mechanism for regulating PP2A in response to IR. As shown in the model in Fig.7, AC has activity in the absence of B and the activity as well as substrate specificity of AC differs from ABC (42Price N.E. Mumby M.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11312-11318Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Loss of the B55α regulatory subunit from the ABC heterotrimer in response to IR may interrupt normal cell cycle progression leading to checkpoint activation. Either depletion of this heterotrimer or formation of another PP2A holoenzyme could be involved. It is possible that the AC dimer from the AB55C could form a complex with another regulatory or targeting subunit “X,” which could in turn enhance PP2A activity in a substrate-specific manner (42Price N.E. Mumby M.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11312-11318Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Recent discoveries show that the repertoire of subunits that can associate with the AC heterodimer of PP2A goes beyond the known B subunit families (e.g. B55 and B56) and includes proteins such as stratin and S/G2 nuclear autoantigen (SG2NA) (43Yu X.X., Du, X. Moreno C.S. Green R.E. Ogris E. Feng Q. Chou L. McQuoid M.J. Pallas D.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 44Moreno C.S. Lane W.S. Pallas D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24253-24260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). If these ACX trimers did not bind to Mono Q, they would not have been detected. PP2A is known to regulate the activity of several families of protein kinases involved in radiation-signaling pathways, including protein kinase B, protein kinase C, extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK), mitogen-activated protein (MAP), and cyclin-dependent kinases (27Millward T.A. Zolnierowicz S. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 186-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Hence, following IR the AC or ACX forms of PP2A could alter kinase activities as a means of transmitting the signal. Identifying substrates for which PP2A has altered activity following IR may reveal novel targets for radiation sensitizers. What is the mechanism by which IR causes dissociation of PP2A heterotrimer containing B55α′3f phosphorylation is a likely possibility because IR-activated ATM is known to phosphorylate a number of downstream proteins including p53, BRCA1, NBS1, and chk2 (45Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S. Taya Y. Anderson C.W. Chessa L. Smorodinsky N.I. Prives C. Reiss Y. Shiloh Y. Ziv Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1674-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar, 46Lim D.S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 17276-17280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In addition, ATM-dependent dephosphorylation of both p53 and histone H1 has been observed, suggesting that ATM signals could activate phosphatases (49Waterman M.J. Stavridi E.S. Waterman J.L. Halazonetis T.D. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 50Guo C.Y. Wang Y. Brautigan D.L. Larner J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18715-18720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Recent observations offer possibilities for IR regulation of PP2A heterotrimer assembly through phosphorylation. The PI 3-like kinase m-TOR, which has an important role in G1 progression, has been reported to regulate the protein translational regulator PHAS-1 through the phosphorylation of the catalytic subunit of PP2A (51Peterson R.T. Desai B.N. Hardwick J.S. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4438-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Alternatively, substitution of the putative phosphorylation site Thr-304 or the known phosphorylation site at Tyr-307 in the PP2A catalytic subunit with a negatively charged amino acid abolished binding of the B subunit to the dimeric PP2A and altered substrate specificity (40Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). IR-induced phosphorylation of PP2A is a possibility that is currently under investigation. Phosphorylation of the B55 subunit or A subunit are also possible, but never yet observed. Phosphorylation of a protein that competes away and replaces the B55 is an attractive possibility. We show that the mechanism for displacement of the B55 subunit in response to IR is highly specific, without effects on B56, and is reversible with a maximal effect around 30 min and recovery within an hour post-IR. These characteristics are an important step toward definition of the mechanism by which IR leads to dissociation of B55α from heterotrimeric PP2A. Regardless of the mechanism, subunit exchange might be the way PP2A is directed to execute its particular functions in response to IR."

SK subunits share the prototypic membrane topology of voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channels with six transmembrane domains flanked by cytoplasmic N and C termini (Fig.1), although their primary sequences do not contain any significant homology outside the P-loop.

Analysis of Ca2+-gating showed that the high affinity of SK channels for Ca2+ results from a property, unique among the large family of K+ channels: the SK α-subunits associate with the Ca2+-binding protein calmodulin (CaM) (12Xia X.M. Fakler B. Rivard A. Wayman G. Johnson-Pais T. Keen J.E. Ishii T. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Lutsenko S. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Nature. 1998; 395: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). This association is constitutive, i.e. it occurs in the absence of Ca2+. In this context, activation of SK channels results from Ca2+ binding to CaM, which induces conformational changes in both molecules that finally lead to opening of the channel pore (11Keen J.E. Khawaled R. Farrens D.L. Neelands T. Rivard A. Bond C.T. Janowsky A. Fakler B. Adelman J.P. Maylie J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8830-8838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Xia X.M. Fakler B. Rivard A.

Accordingly, channel-gating requires both, Ca2+-independent and Ca2+-dependent interaction between SKα and CaM. For either type of interaction, functional analysis identified distinct domains on the CaM molecule. Ca2+ binding occurs only in the N-terminal EF-hands of CaM, while the C-terminal lobe mediates Ca2+-independent interactions with the SK α-subunits (11Keen J.E. Khawaled R. Farrens D.L. Neelands T. Rivard A. Bond C.T. Janowsky A. Fakler B. Adelman J.P. Maylie J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8830-8838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both types of interactions with CaM require a domain of about 90 amino acids in the proximal C terminus of the channel subunit, the calmodulin binding domain (CaMBD, Fig. 1). As long as the CaMBD is present at the C terminus of the SK α-subunit, channels exhibit regular Ca2+-gating; deletions of more than 10 residues (marked by an asterisk in Fig. 1) resulted in channels that were no longer gated by intracellular Ca2+ (12Xia X.M. Fakler B. Rivard A. Wayman G. Johnson-Pais T. Keen J.E. Ishii T. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Lutsenko S. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Nature. 1998; 395: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 1, the CaMBD is highly conserved among the SK subunits, but shows no clear homology with any other known protein (7Kohler M. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Kinzie J.M. Marrion N.V.

Different from other CaM-binding proteins, the CaMBD sequence does not provide a canonical motif for either Ca2+-free or Ca2+-dependent interactions with CaM (13Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M.

Rivard A. Bächinger H. Adelman J.P. Nature. 2001; 410: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). In the presence of Ca2+ this complex presents as a dimer formed by two CaMBDs and two CaMs with each CaMBD molecule interacting with two CaM molecules. In contrast to this “gated complex” the Ca2+-free CaMBD·CaM complex is a monomer as shown by sedimentation analysis (see supplemental information in Ref. 17Schumacher M. Rivard A. Bächinger H.

For interaction studies with apoCaM, samples of unlabeled and uniformly13C,15N-labeled, 60–70%2H-enriched CaMBD were prepared. CaM (from rat) in unlabeled, uniformly 15N-labeled, and uniformly13C,15N-labeled form was obtained from overexpression in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified to homogeneity by phenyl-Sepharose chromatography. Ca2+-free conditions of NMR samples for CaMBD and CaM were obtained by extensive dialysis against a Ca2+-free 250 mm NaCl solution (passage over a freshly regenerated chelex column prior to dialysis). Small amounts of HCl and NaOH were used to adjust the pH value of these solutions to 6.0. The apo(CaMBD·CaM) complex was reconstituted by adding aliquots of CaMBD to a CaM-containing solution to a molar ratio of 1:1. In a consecutive step, the complex was concentrated to 0.7–2 mm by ultrafiltration in Centricon tubes, and the pH value was readjusted to 6.0. Final samples of the complex were in 250 mm NaCl (90% H2O/10% D2O (v/v), pH 5 or 6) with no buffer salts present. Trace amounts of NaN3 were added as a preservative. 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate was added and used for chemical shift referencing. The following three-dimensional NMR spectra were recorded at 298 K on a Bruker Avance 600 spectrometer for the sequence-specific assignment of CaMBD: HNCA, CBCA(CO)NH, CBCANH, HNCO, HN(CA)CO, 15N total correlation spectroscopy-HSQC (70 ms isotropic mixing time), and 15N NOESY-HSQC (100 ms mixing time). Distance restraints for structure calculations were obtained from a three-dimensional 15N NOESY-HSQC (recorded on a Bruker Avance 800) and from two-dimensional homonuclear NOESY experiments in H2O and 99.9% D2O solution, respectively; a mixing time of 150 ms was used in all these experiments. 3JHN-Hα coupling constants were determined from a three-dimensional HNHA spectrum. The heteronuclear1H-15N NOE was measured at 500 and 600 MHz for wild type CaMBD and at 600 MHz for the mutant CaMBD. A three-dimensional 15N NOESY-HSQC spectrum (150 ms mixing time) of the mutant was recorded at 600 MHz and used to obtain the sequence-specific assignment and distance restraints. H/D exchange of CaMBD was performed by solvent exchange using a NAP5 column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). For assignment of CaMBD backbone resonances in the apo(CaMBD·CaM) complex the following three-dimensional spectra were recorded from samples of labeled CaMBD bound to unlabeled apoCaM (pH 5.0, 298 K): HNCO, HNCA, HN(CO)CACB, TROSY-HNCA, and15N NOESY-HSQC (100 ms mixing time). The backbone resonances of apoCaM in the complex were unambiguously assigned using the following experiments on samples of labeled CaM bound to unlabeled CaMBD (pH 6.0): TROSY-HNCA, TROSY-HN(CO)CA, TROSY-HNCO, HNHA, and15N NOESY-TROSY (100 ms mixing time). The backbone assignment of uncomplexed apoCaM was based on published data (available at nmr.oci.utoronto.ca/ikura/public_files/shifts/apo_CaM.cs) verified at the solvent conditions of the complex (250 mm NaCl, pH 6.0, 298 K) by a 15N NOESY-HSQC spectrum (100 ms mixing time). All NMR data were processed with XWINNMR and analyzed using the programs AURELIA (Bruker) and XEASY (ETH Zürich) (18Bartels C. Xia T.H. Billeter M. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar). Structures were calculated with the program DYANA (19Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar), which employs a simulated annealing algorithm in the torsion angle space. Volumes of assigned NOESY cross-peaks were converted into 668 proton-proton upper distance limits by the program CALIBA (20Güntert P. Braun W. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 517-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar) using five different classes of NOEs (21Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). The measured 35 values of 3JHN-Hα were used directly as J-coupling restraints. After recalibration of distance restraints in four cycles of preliminary DYANA calculations the final family of structures was generated in a run with 300 random starting structures and 12,000 annealing steps. The 23 best structures had values for the target function <1.25 Å2, no NOE violations >0.4 Å, and no violations of J-coupling restraints. For the CaMBD mutant, the same restraints as for wild type CaMBD were used, except for the J-coupling restraint of Leu-33, all NOEs involving side chain protons of Val-32 and Leu-33 and NOEs abolished in the three-dimensional 15N NOESY-HSQC of the mutant. Starting from 250 random structures a final family of 15 structures with target function values <1.23 Å2 and no NOE violations >0.6 Å was obtained. All figures were generated with the program MOLMOL (22Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar) except Fig. 7, which was generated with GRASP (23Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5318) Google Scholar). Protein-docking simulations were done with the program GRAMM (v. 1.03) (24Katchalski-Katzir E. Shariv I. Eisenstein M. Friesem A.A. Aflalo C. Vakser I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2195-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar) using a standard hydrophobic docking protocol (25Vakser I.A. Aflalo C. Proteins. 1994; 20: 320-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This program employs a geometric recognition algorithm performing an exhaustive six-dimensional search through relative translations and rotations of two molecules in order to provide maximal surface complementarity. For the GRAMM runs, the pseudoatoms originating from DYANA were removed from the CaMBD structure file. The r.m.s.d value of the two best solutions of the docking referred to in “Discussion” was 1.0 Å. SK2 channels were heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes as described elsewhere (26Fakler B.

Giant patch recordings were made at room temperature (∼23 °C) 3–7 days after injection of SK2-specific cRNA. Pipettes used were made from thick-walled borosilicate glass and had resistances of 0.2–0.3mΩ (tip diameter of about 20 μm) when filled with (in mm) 120 KOH, 10 HEPES and 0.5 CaCl2, pH adjusted to 7.2 with MES. Inside-out patches were superfused with an intracellular solution containing (in mm): 119 KOH, 1 KCl, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, pH adjusted to 7.2 with MES; the amount of CaCl2 required to yield a free Ca2+concentration of 10 μm was calculated according to Fabiato (27Fabiato A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 378-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar) and added to the EGTA-solution under pH-meter control; thereafter, pH was readjusted to 7.2 with KOH. Rapid exchange of Ca2+ was achieved using a piezo-driven application system (28Antz C. Bauer T. Kalbacher H. Frank R. Covarrubias M. Kalbitzer H.R. Ruppersberg J.P. Baukrowitz T. Fakler B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); data analysis was performed with IgorPro (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR) on a Macintosh PowerPC. For probing interaction between CaM and wild type or mutant CaMBD, 250 μg of His-tagged CaMBD protein was incubated at 4 °C with Ni-NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen; 30 μl) in PBS containing 20 mm imidazole. After 2 h the beads were washed three times with PBS in the presence (10 μm) or absence (1 mm BAPTA) of Ca2+. 80 μg of purified rat CaM dissolved in PBS with or without Ca2+ was added to the resin and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing the resin three times with PBS as indicated above, bound protein was eluted with 200 mmimidazole and separated by SDS-PAGE (15% acrylamide). For immunocytochemistry, oocytes expressing SK2 or SK2(V427G/L428G) channels were defolliculated and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 2 h at 4 °C. After blocking unspecific antibody binding with normal goat serum, 10 μm of cryostat sections were incubated with a polyclonal anti-rSK2 antiserum raised against a C-terminal epitope of rSK2 (residues 539–558) (29Klöcker N. Oliver D. Ruppersberg J.P. Knaus H.G. Fakler B. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 514-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 30Oliver D. Klocker N. Schuck J. Baukrowitz T. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. Neuron. 2000; 26: 595-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Immunoreactivity was revealed by cy-3-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit antiserum. A histidine-tagged protein containing amino acids 396–487 of the rat SK2 sequence (referred to as residues 1–92 of CaMBD) was purified from bacteria and used for structural evaluation of the CaMBD. The protein formed a stable monomer in a 250-mm NaCl solution as revealed by gel filtration (not shown). A series of multidimensional (two-, three-dimensional) homo- and heteronuclear NMR experiments (see “Materials and Methods”) were performed that allowed almost complete assignment of backbone and side chain atoms. The observed NOE connectivities exhibited a distinct distribution along the CaMBD sequence (Fig.2A). For most parts of the molecule an average of ≈10 NOEs was found per residue, while the sequence stretch roughly extending from Ala-28 to Asn-42 exhibited an average of ≈19 NOEs per residue. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 2A, most NOE contacts between non-adjacent amino acids (i, i + x) were found in this part of the CaMBD sequence. Thus, a number of contacts between the α-proton of one amino acid and the amide proton of the second (αN(i, i + 2)) and third amino acid following (αN(i, i + 3)) were observed, a NOE pattern usually found in helical structures. Moreover, most residues throughout this sequence stretch show strong sequential contacts between backbone amide protons (dNN NOEs). The picture of structurally distinct parts in CaMBD was reinforced by the 1H-15N heteronuclear NOE, used as a measure for backbone flexibility on the subnanosecond time scale (31Ishima R. Nagayama K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3162-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thus, positive NOE values indicative for increased rigidity were observed for residues between Ala-30 and Tyr-40, while negative values were obtained outside this region (Fig. 2B). Together, the NOE pattern and the results from dynamic measurements suggested that CaMBD consists of an ordered most likely helical core region flanked by flexible N and C termini. All experimentally determined restraints (Tables I andII) were used to calculate the solution structure of the SK2 CaMBD. A family of 22 structures of CaMBD with the lowest target function is shown in Fig.3A for residues 20–50. Thus, CaMBD consists of three parts, non-ordered and flexible N and C termini flanking an ordered core region that extends between residues 30–40. The core region is well defined with r.m.s.d. values to the mean structure of 0.71 ± 0.30 Å for the backbone atoms and 1.39 ± 0.43 Å for all atoms. It may be best described as series of three helical turns that change sense of rotation in the middle turn (stereoview in Fig. 3B). This particular folding was independent of the algorithm used for structure calculations (very similar results were obtained with CNS (32Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar)) and is consistent with the lack of constraints typical for regular helices (3JHN-Hα-couplings < 6 Hz, characteristic chemical shift indices (33Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar)) and the observation of the long-range connectivity between Asn-31 and Trp-37. Alternatively, the experimental NOE data would be consistent with the core region to transiently form a regular three-turn α-helix. The functional significance of this helical region was further investigated by disrupting its folding via site-directed mutagenesis.Table IStructural statistics of SK2 CaMBDTotal number of distance constraints668Intraresidual341Sequential272Medium range (‖i −j‖ ≤ 5) 54Long range (‖i −j‖ > 5) 13JHN-Hα coupling constant restraints 35Distance restraint violations > 0.4 Å (per structure) 0Coupling constant restraint violations > 0.5 Hz (per structure) 0Average number of distance restraint violations > 0.2 Å (per structure)4.0 ± 1.9Average sum of distance restraint violations (per structure)4.1 ± 0.6 ÅAverage maximum distance restraint violation0.33 ± 0.05 ÅAverage target function0.96 ± 0.22 Å2R.m.s. deviations from the mean structure (superposition of 30–40)Backbone heavy atoms0.71 ± 0.30 ÅAll heavy atoms1.39 ± 0.43 ÅStructural statistics for the final family of 23 structures.

All 92 residues of SK2 CaMBD were included in the analysis. None of the 23 best structures has a target function > 1.25 Å2, distance restraint violations > 0.4 Å, and violations of J-coupling restraints. Two glycine residues were introduced into the isolated CaMBD at positions 32 and 33 (V32G/L33G; Fig. 4,A and B) as well as into the whole channel molecule (corresponding positions 427 and 428) (34Chakrabartty A. Baldwin R.L. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 46: 141-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The mutant CaMBD was examined by NMR and tested for CaM binding, while the mutant channels were tested for Ca2+-gating. As shown in Fig. 4A, these exchanges abolished quite a number of NOE connectivities including all but one of the helix-typical (i, i + 3)-NOEs, as well as the NOEs between Asn-31 and Glu-35 and between Asn-31 and Trp-37. Moreover, the chemical shift of backbone atoms (HN, Hα, N) between residues 30 and 45 was changed significantly in the mutated CaMBD (Fig. 4C), and the 1H-15N heteronuclear NOE indicated a largely increased flexibility of the backbone between residues 30 and 36 (data not shown). Accordingly, structure calculations (see “Materials and Methods”) performed with the restraints derived from the NMR data of the mutant protein yielded significant alterations in the structure of the helical region of CaMBD. As shown in Fig. 4D, a family of 15 best structures showed an overall destabilization of this region between residues 30 and 40 with r.m.s.d. values to the mean structure of 2.03 ± 0.58 Å for backbone atoms and 2.69 ± 0.74 Å for all atoms. More detailed analysis of the CaMBD(V32G/L33G) structures showed that there is reasonable convergence only between residues Thr-36 and Lys-41. These residues form an α-helical turn with r.m.s.d. values to the mean structure of 0.59 ± 0.17 Å for backbone atoms and 1.51 ± 0.37 Å for all atoms, very similar to wild type CaMBD. Together, these data indicate that the double glycine exchange leads to structural rearrangements in the CaMBD helical domain that largely destabilize the N-terminal turns between residues Ala-28 and Thr-36, while the most C-terminal turn is roughly conserved. To examine the functional significance of the helical domain in CaMBD, wild type and mutant CaMBD proteins were probed for their ability to interact with CaM either in the presence (10 μm) or absence (1 mm BAPTA) of Ca2+; in these experiments CaM and CaMBD were used in a molar ratio of about 1:4 (see “Materials and Methods”). As shown in Fig.5A, both CaMBD proteins were able to bind CaM in the presence of Ca2+. Under Ca2+-free conditions, however, CaM-binding was only observed with the wild type CaMBD (Fig. 5A). Thus, the mutated CaMBD was no longer able to associate constitutively with CaM. Next the double glycine mutation was introduced at the sites corresponding to Val-32 and Leu-33 in the SK2 sequence (V427G/L428G), and we tested whether the mutated CaMBD altered channel function in the context of the entire protein. Fig.5B illustrates representative current recordings obtained in response to fast piezo-driven application of a saturating [Ca2+]i of 10 μm to inside-out patches excised from Xenopus oocytes expressing either wild type or mutant SK2 channels. While large currents were recorded with wild type channels, mutant channels were no longer gated by intracellular Ca2+ (n = 52 patches from 12 oocytes). Consistent with the lack of Ca2+-free CaM binding of mutant SK2 subunits, the observed loss of channel function was not due to a loss of subunit assembly or to reduced insertion of SK2 protein into the plasma membrane. Both, wild type and mutant SK2 protein, were equally detected in the plasma membrane of oocytes by immunostaining with an SK2-specific antibody (30Oliver D. Klocker N. Schuck J. Baukrowitz T. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. Neuron. 2000; 26: 595-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5C). Together, these structural and functional data show, that association of SK channels with CaM is at least in part determined by a short helical domain in the proximal C terminus of the SK α-subunit. The Ca2+-free association between CaMBD and CaM was examined in NMR experiments on the apo(CaMBD·CaM) complex reconstituted in solution (see “Materials and Methods”). For selective analysis of both components in the complex, either CaMBD or CaM was labeled. Surprisingly, as shown in Fig.6A, the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of complexed CaMBD only exhibited about a third of the expected 92 amide cross-peaks, which were finally assigned to the very N- and C-terminal residues of the molecule (Arg-1-Met-16 and Gln-81-Gln-92, Fig. 6B). The cross-peaks of the remaining amino acids in CaMBD were broadened beyond the detection level. This phenomenon is well known and diagnostic of conformational exchange processes on an intermediate time scale. Different from CaMBD, all cross-peaks of CaM within the apo(CaMBD·CaM) complex were visible in1H-15N correlation spectra recorded with the TROSY technique (35Pervushin K. Riek R. Wider G. Wüthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12366-12371Crossref PubMed Scopus (2085) Google Scholar). However, while the residues in the N-terminal half of CaM could be assigned by three-dimensional triple resonance experiments, the majority of the C-terminal spin-systems exhibited relaxation rates precluding assignment with conventional and TROSY 3D spectra. As shown by the chemical shift mapping of the backbone amide groups (Fig. 6C), the resonances of the residues in the N-terminal half of CaM are hardly perturbed in the apo(CaMBD·CaM) complex indicating that this part of CaM does not participate in the protein-protein association. In summary, these data strongly suggest that complexation occurs between the C-terminal globular domain of apoCaM and the core region of CaMBD. In the complex, CaMBD seems to be in equilibrium between different conformational states rather than to present with a well defined structure. Our results show that the solution structure of the SK2 CaMBD consists of highly flexible N and C termini that flank a well ordered core region forming an unusually folded helical domain between Ala-423 (Ala-28 in CaMBD) and Asn-437 (Asn-42 in CaMBD). Disruption of this domain in the isolated CaMBD or on the whole channel protein ablated Ca2+-independent association of both molecules and thus abolished the Ca2+-gating characteristic for SK type K+ channels (5Lancaster B.

Ishii T. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Lutsenko S. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Nature. 1998; 395: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-independent association between CaM and CaMBD is an essential prerequisite for the rapid response to Ca2+inherent in the physiological function of SK channels (11Keen J.E. Khawaled R. Farrens D.L. Neelands T. Rivard A. Bond C.T. Janowsky A. Fakler B. Adelman J.P. Maylie J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8830-8838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Xia X.M. Fakler B. Rivard A. Wayman G.

It seems likely that the interaction between CaM and the CaMBD of the channel subunits initially occurs during protein processing while the SK subunit is integrated into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, exposing the CaMBD to the virtually Ca2+-free cytoplasmic milieu. Ca2+-free interactions between the CaMBD and CaM occur in the C-terminal domain of CaM as concluded from functional analysis (11Keen J.E. Khawaled R. Farrens D.L. Neelands T. Rivard A. Bond C.T. Janowsky A. Fakler B. Adelman J.P. Maylie J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8830-8838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as from NMR experiments on the apo(CaMBD·CaM) complex reconstituted in solution. The latter showed that complex formation involves stretches Met-17-Asp-80 of CaMBD and Glu-83-Lys-148 in the C-terminal globular domain of CaM. In the absence of Ca2+, these sequence stretches undergo significant structural changes which, however, cannot be elucidated in detail due to conformational exchange processes on the intermediate time scale in the CaMBD core region. Therefore, to get a more vivid picture of the complex formation, the associative process was simulated by “docking” the helical region of CaMBD (amino acids 423–437) onto the C-terminal globular domain of apoCaM as determined by NMR spectroscopy in solution (36Zhang M. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 758-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Fig.7A illustrates the result with the best score (see “Materials and Methods”), showing that residues 423–437 of SK2 CaMBD fit snugly into a cleft of apoCaM where two methionines, Met-124 and Met-144, offer a hydrophobic pocket implicated previously to serve as a contact surface for interaction with target peptides (36Zhang M. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 758-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). This finding is consistent with the result from the crystal of the Ca2+-loaded CaMBD·CaM complex (17Schumacher M. Rivard A. Bächinger H. Adelman J.P. Nature. 2001; 410: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). This complex presents as a dimer composed of two CaM and two CaMBD molecules. Different from other CaM-target structures, bound Ca2+ ions were only found in the N-terminal lobe of CaM while the C-terminal EF-hands were free of Ca2+. Nevertheless, the C-terminal lobe exhibited considerable structural reorganization with respect to the solution structure of apoCaM. These structural rearrangements allow CaM to tightly wrap around the N-terminal half of CaMBD (17Schumacher M. Rivard A. Bächinger H. Adelman J.P. Nature. 2001; 410: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The intermolecular interface is formed by three “pockets” involving CaM residues Met-124 and Met-144 and by CaMBD residues 423–437 (Fig.7B). In particular Ala-425 (Ala-30 in CaMBD), Leu-428 (Leu-33 in CaMBD) and Trp-432 (Trp-37 in CaMBD) were shown to tightly contact multiple hydrophobic surface patches on CaM. As illustrated in Fig. 7B, the crystal structure shows that both CaM and the CaMBD undergo structural rearrangements in the complex. In CaM the secondary structural elements (helices αE, αF, αG, αH) forming the C-terminal lobe are largely repacked. In the CaMBD the core domain changed from the distorted helical folding observed in solution into a regular α-helical conformation. In this context, the conformational exchange seen in NMR experiments on the apo(CaMBD·CaM) complex may well result from an equilibrium between the distorted and regular folding of an α-helix. While disrupting the helical domain in CaMBD and ablating Ca2+-free interactions with CaM, the mutations at positions 427 and 428 did not interfere with interactions between the CaMBD and Ca2+-loaded CaM (Fig. 5A), consistent with other structural and functional data (11Keen J.E. Khawaled R. Farrens D.L. Neelands T. Rivard A. Bond C.T. Janowsky A. Fakler B. Adelman J.P. Maylie J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8830-8838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Schumacher M. Rivard A. Bächinger H. Adelman J.P. Nature. 2001; 410: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). This suggests that Ca2+-dependent interactions are mediated by other regions of the CaMBD. Therefore, the helical domain identified here by NMR may serve as a scaffold structure that binds Ca2+-free CaM and participates in tethering it constitutively to the channel α-subunit. Upon calcification of the N-terminal EF-hands of CaM in the monomeric apo(CaMBD·CaM) complex (17Schumacher M. Rivard A. Bächinger H. Adelman J.P. Nature. 2001; 410: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), the Ca2+-loaded CaMBD·CaM complex of one channel subunit dimerizes with the corresponding complex of one neighboring subunit, a transition that results in opening of the channel pore (17Schumacher M. Rivard A. Bächinger H. Adelman J.P. Nature. 2001; 410: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2037663557,"Enveloped animal viruses must undergo membrane fusion to deliver their genome into the host cell. We demonstrate that high pressure inactivates two membrane-enveloped viruses, influenza and Sindbis, by trapping the particles in a fusion-intermediate state. The pressure-induced conformational changes in Sindbis and influenza viruses were followed using intrinsic and extrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism, and fusion, plaque, and hemagglutination assays. Influenza virus subjected to pressure exposes hydrophobic domains as determined by tryptophan fluorescence and by the binding of bis-8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate, a well established marker of the fusogenic state in influenza virus. Pressure also produced an increase in the fusion activity at neutral pH as monitored by fluorescence resonance energy transfer using lipid vesicles labeled with fluorescence probes. Sindbis virus also underwent conformational changes induced by pressure similar to those in influenza virus, and the increase in fusion activity was followed by pyrene excimer fluorescence of the metabolically labeled virus particles. Overall we show that pressure elicits subtle changes in the whole structure of the enveloped viruses triggering a conformational change that is similar to the change triggered by low pH. Our data strengthen the hypothesis that the native conformation of fusion proteins is metastable, and a cycle of pressure leads to a final state, the fusion-active state, of smaller volume.

The fusion is mediated by surface envelope proteins of the virus in response to a trigger (1Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 871-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar,2Weissenhorn W. Dessen A. Calder L.J. Harrison S.C. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1999; 16: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Once triggered, the fusion process leads to a conformational change that promotes the interaction of a specific sequence (fusion peptide) with the target membrane and initiates membrane fusion. Membrane fusion is crucial in other biological functions such as myotube formation, fertilization, and trafficking of endocytic and exocytic vesicles within eukaryotic cells (1Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 871-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 3Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar). Many enveloped animal viruses have been studied as models for understanding the mechanism of membrane fusion. While the fusion proteins of many viruses reveal significant similarity in their putative fusogenic conformation, such as those of influenza virus (hemagglutinin HA2),1human immunodeficiency virus (gp41 protein), Moloney murine leukemia virus (TM protein), and Ebola virus (GP2 protein) (4Singh M. Berger B. Kim P.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 1031-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), the events of membrane fusion for other virus families (e.g. Flaviviridae and Togaviridae) are beginning to be understood. Alphavirus and the flavivirus fusion proteins appear to have evolved from a common ancestor (5Strauss J.H. Strauss E.G. Cell. 2001; 105: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and possess a similar new class of membrane fusion proteins that do not form coiled-coils (6Pletnev S.V.

Sindbis and influenza are enveloped viruses that first enter a cell by endocytosis and then fuse with the cellular membrane in response to acidic conditions. Sindbis virus is the prototype of theAlphavirus genus, Togaviridae family. TheAlphavirus spike is composed of E1 and E2 transmembrane subunits arranged as 80 trimers of E1/E2 heterodimers. Upon exposure to mildly acidic pH, the E1/E2 dimer dissociates, and E1 undergoes conformational changes that result in exposure of a previously hidden fusion peptide with the formation of a highly stable, trypsin-resistant E1 homotrimer (9Kielian M. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 2284-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 10Wahlberg J.M. Bron R. Wilschut J. Garoff H. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7309-7318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Gibbons D.L. Ahn A. Chatterjee P.K. Kielian M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7772-7780Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). E1 then associates with the target membrane by insertion of the fusion peptide, and membrane fusion is triggered. Structural predictions suggest that, unlike spike proteins of the influenza virus class, alphavirus E1 does not refold into an extended α-helical coiled-coil during fusion (4Singh M. Berger B. Kim P.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 1031-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). One of the best known representatives of the fusion process is the influenza virus. The HA of influenza virus is a homotrimeric glycoprotein located on the outer surface of the virus particle. HA is first synthesized inside the cells as a fusion-incompetent precursor (HA0) that is proteolytically cleaved to the mature, two-chain HA1/HA2 native state. HA binds to a cell-surface receptor, sialic acid, which results in the adsorption of the virus onto the cell surface. After binding to its receptor, the virus is endocytosed by the cell. As the pH within the endosome decreases, the HA undergoes an irreversible conformation change that exposes the hydrophobic N terminus of HA2, the fusion peptide. The crystal structures of HA in the native and fusogenic structures have been determined (12Wilson I.A. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1981; 289: 366-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar, 13Carr C.M. Kim P.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 823-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar, 14Bullough P.A. Hughson F.M. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the native, nonfusogenic state of HA is in a metastable conformation, separated from the lower free energy state (fusogenic conformation) by a kinetic barrier (13Carr C.M. Kim P.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 823-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar, 14Bullough P.A. Hughson F.M. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C.

The barrier is surpassed when the fusion events are triggered by virus-cell interaction. In our studies we tested how the exposure of hydrophobic domains induced by high pressure can convert the envelope proteins from the metastable state to the fusion-active state. Because pressure is a mild perturbation when compared with denaturants and high temperature (16Silva J.L. Weber G. Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 1993; 44: 89-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 17Jonas J. Jonas A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 287-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 18Mozhaev V.V.

Sci. 2001; 26: 612-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), it elicits no dramatic changes in structure of the whole particle. However, in both cases, the viruses are inactivated when their spike proteins are displaced from the metastable state by high pressure. Recent efforts to inhibit the virus fusion-active state have been demonstrated (20Chan D.C. Chutkowski C.T. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15613-15617Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 21Root M.J. Kay M.S. Kim P.S. Science. 2001; 291: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The use of pressure to trigger the fusion-active state may be useful to the design of new antiviral drugs and vaccines. Bis-8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate (bis-ANS) and 12-(1-pyrene)dodecanoic acid (PyC12) were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The following lipids used to make synthetic vesicles were ordered from Avanti Polar Lipids: dioleolylphosphatidylcholine,N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)diacyl phosphatidylethanolamine, and lissamine-rhodamine-phosphatidylethanolamine (rhodamine). All other reagents were of analytical grade. The Sindbis virus spectroscopic experiments were performed at 25 °C in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 7.5). For influenza virus the experiments were performed at 37 °C in buffer containing 50 mmHepes, 150 mm sodium chloride, 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 7.4). Sindbis virus (strain AR339) was grown in BHK-21 cells (baby hamster kidney). The cells were maintained and cultured as monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma Chemical Co.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 3% tryptose phosphate and grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Sindbis virus was grown in BHK-21 cells for 48 h at 37 °C with a multiplicity of infection of 1. The supernatant was collected and cleared of cellular debris, and 40% polyethylene glycol 8000 in 2 m NaCl was added and rocked overnight at 4 °C. Virus was collected by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 1 h and resuspended in a small volume of 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA buffer (pH 7.5). Virus was applied to the top of a linear 15–40% (w/v) sucrose density gradient and centrifuged for 1.5 h at 190,000 × g. Banded virus was harvested and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA buffer (pH 7.5). Sindbis infectivity was evaluated by plaque assay as described previously (22Edwards J. Mann E. Brown D.T. J. Virol. 1983; 45: 1090-1097Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sindbis virus concentrations for the infectivity assays varied from 0.05 to 2.0 mg/ml. Mayaro virus was propagated and purified as described previously (23Gaspar L.P. Terezan A.F. Pinheiro A.S. Foguel D. Rebello M.A. Silva J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7415-7421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For pyrene phospholipid incorporation by viruses, BHK-21 cells were cultured, and a final concentration of pyrene-labeled fatty acid (15 μg/ml) was added to the culture medium. When cell growth was complete, monolayers were infected with virus at a multiplicity of 1 plaque-forming unit/cell in 10 ml of medium without fluorescently labeled fatty acid for 1 h at 37 °C. Virus was pelleted by centrifugation at 190,000 × g for 4 h at 4 °C, purified on a continuous sucrose gradient (5–40%), and stored at 0 °C. Influenza virus (strain A/Udorn 307/72, H3N2) was grown for 48 h at 35–36 °C in the allantoic cavity of 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. The allantoic fluid was collected, and cell debris was removed by a low speed spin (4,000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C). The virus was pelleted by spinning the allantoic fluid at 100,000 × g for 45 min, then resuspended in TE buffer (20 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.4), and banded on a continuous 20–60% sucrose density gradient in TE buffer, pH 8.4. Banded virus was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against TE buffer, pH 8.4. For hemagglutination, chicken red blood cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline. The red blood cell final concentration was 1% (v/v). A 96-well plate was used to incubate the purified influenza virus with the red blood cells as described previously (24Hierholzer J.C. Killington R.A. Mahy B.W.J. Kangro H.O. Virology Methods Manual. Academic Press Ltd., San Diego, CA1996: 41-45Google Scholar). Influenza virus concentrations used in the hemagglutination assays were between 0.05 and 0.5 mg/ml. Dioleolylphosphatidylcholine,N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)diacyl phosphatidylethanolamine, and rhodamine were mixed with bovine ganglioside (GD1a; Calbiochem-Novabiochem) at molar ratios of 95.3:0.6:0.6:4.5 (25Carr C.M. Chaudhry C. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14306-14313Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). For the preparation of liposomes the mixture was dried under a stream of nitrogen. Dried lipid films were hydrated in 2 ml of HNE buffer (5 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 7.4)). Extrusion was done 10 times through stacked polycarbonate filters with a pore size of 0.2 μm (Nucleopore, Inc., Pleasanton, CA). Lipid concentrations of liposome suspension were determined on the basis of phosphate analysis (26Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). For the fusion assay, a previously described protocol was used (25Carr C.M. Chaudhry C. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14306-14313Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The fluorescence was monitored by exciting the sample at 465 nm, and emission was measured at 535 nm in a ISSPC fluorometer (ISS Inc., Champaign, IL). The lipid-mixing end point was defined as the fluorescence emission at 535 nm on addition of Triton X-100 to 1%. Erythrocyte ghosts were prepared according to Dodgeet al. (27Dodge J.T. Hanahan D.J. Mitchell C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1963; 100: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3636) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Pyrene-labeled virus was excited at 330 nm, and the emission was observed from 360 to 530 nm. The protein concentration of ghosts as well as of viruses was determined according to Lowry et al.(28Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.F. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of fluorophore incorporated into the virus membrane was obtained by measuring the fluorescence intensity in the presence of ethanol at 345 nm. Labeled virus was incubated for 60 min with erythrocyte ghost suspension (0.5 mg of ghost protein/ml). Fluorescence and light scattering measurements were recorded on ISSK2 and ISSPC spectrofluorometers (ISS Inc.) equipped with a high-pressure cell. The tryptophan residues were excited at 280 nm, and emission was observed from 305 to 420 nm. Scattered light (320 nm) was collected at an angle of 90° to the incident light. Spectral shifts were quantified as changes in the average energy of emission (spectral center of mass <υp>), <υp> = ∑υi F i/∑F i(Equation 1), where F i stands for the fluorescence emitted at wavenumber υi. CD spectra were obtained with a Jasco-710 spectropolarimeter using a quartz cuvette of 0.1-cm path length. Spectra were the average of four scans, and the buffer base lines were subtracted. The concentration of Sindbis virus was 100 μg/ml. The fluorescence yield of the probe bis-ANS increases by up to 100-fold when it is transferred from water to a nonpolar environment as may occur when it binds to hydrophobic domains in proteins (29Rosen C.G. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 3915-3920Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). When a protein is partially disorganized, hydrophobic segments may be exposed, leading to bis-ANS binding with an increase in fluorescence. More recently, bis-ANS has been used to follow changes in the conformation of an enveloped virus as it assumes the fusion-active state (30Korte T. Herrmann A. Eur. Biophys. J. 1994; 23: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 31Korte T. Ludwig K. Booy F.P. Blumenthal R. Herrmann A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4567-4574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bis-ANS has been also used to follow changes in the capsid protein in the disassembly pathway (23Gaspar L.P. Terezan A.F. Pinheiro A.S. Foguel D. Rebello M.A. Silva J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7415-7421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 32Gaspar L.P. Johnson J.E. Silva J.L. Da Poian A.T. J. Mol.

Biol. 1999; 287: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Fig.1, A and B, show the changes in bis-ANS fluorescence of influenza virus as the pressure is increased. The increase in bis-ANS fluorescence with pressure (Fig.1 A) indicates the appearance of sites of hydrophobic character at which bis-ANS is binding. Fig. 1 B shows a blue shift (increase in the energy of emission) in the spectral center of mass of bis-ANS attached to the pressurized influenza virus, consistent with binding of the probe to a nonpolar domain. Fig. 1 Cshows that a blue shift also occurs when Sindbis virus is pressurized in the presence of bis-ANS. These results indicate an increase in exposure of hydrophobic sites on the surface of influenza and Sindbis virus envelope proteins. Previous studies correlated the binding of bis-ANS to the formation of the fusion-active state of influenza virus (30Korte T. Herrmann A. Eur. Biophys. J. 1994; 23: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 31Korte T. Ludwig K. Booy F.P. Blumenthal R. Herrmann A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4567-4574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The increase in bis-ANS binding to influenza virus with pressure clearly indicates population of the fusogenic state. After return to atmospheric pressure, the intensity of bis-ANS remained high for 3 h. There was a small decrease in the fluorescence intensity over the period of 24 h, but the spectrum remained blue-shifted, indicating binding to nonpolar domains. Sindbis virus suspensions were pressurized at 2.5 kbar for different time periods, and its infectivity was measured in terms of plaque-forming units (Fig.2 A). Incubation for 8 h at 2.5 kbar reduced the infectivity by 105. Pressure inactivation of influenza virus was also observed as measured by hemagglutination assays (Fig. 2 B). The effects of high pressure on Sindbis and influenza viruses were also characterized by following changes in tryptophan fluorescence (spectral center of mass and light scattering). Fig.3 A shows the change in the spectral center of mass as a function of pressure (up to 3.0 kbar) for Sindbis virus. Sindbis undergoes a relatively small change in tryptophan emission under pressure (∼200 cm−1), and it is almost completely reversible upon return to atmospheric pressure (open circle). The changes in light scattering are also small (Fig. 3 B), indicating that the particles do not suffer extensive denaturation under pressure. After decompression, the light scattering is reversible (open square), also suggesting recovery of a structure of the same size as the native structure. In contrast, high concentration of urea produced much greater changes (Fig. 3). Although intrinsic fluorescence and light scattering changes suggest that the particles remain intact after pressurization, it was observed that pressure induces virus inactivation (Fig. 2, Aand B). The changes in the spectral center of mass and in the light scattering induced by high pressure on influenza virus are also small and seem to be reversible, leading the particles to a final configuration that is similar to the structure of native virus (Fig. 3, C andD). However, pressure-treated influenza virus lost hemagglutination activity (Fig. 2 B) and could not infect cells in culture and chicken embryos. Pressure inactivation has been described for several animal enveloped viruses, such as vesicular stomatitis virus (34Silva J.L. Luan P. Glaser M. Voss E.W. Weber G. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2111-2117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), simian immunodeficiency virus (35Jurkiewicz E. Villas Boas M. Silva J.L. Weber G. Hunsmamm G. Clegg R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6935-6937Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (36Otake T. Mori H. Kawahata Y. Izumoto Y Nishimura H. Oishi I. Shigehisa T. Ohno H. Heremans K. High Pressure Research in Bioscience and Bio/Technology. Leuven University Press, Leuven, Belgium1997: 233-236Google Scholar). Table I shows that thep 50 (pressure that promotes half of the changes in tryptophan fluorescence) did not undergo any change that is significantly above the error of the measurement when the concentration was varied for Sindbis virus, Mayaro virus, anAlphavirus, and influenza virus. We also tested the concentration dependence for the reduction in infectivity (Sindbis and Mayaro viruses) and hemagglutination (Table I). For all the viruses, there were no significant changes in the inactivating effects when the virus concentration was varied from 0.05 to 2 mg/ml. On the other hand, the changes in bis-ANS fluorescence were slightly sensitive to concentration (Fig. 1, D and E). There was a small shift to lower pressures when the virus concentration was increased from 50 to 500 μg/ml that can be explained by an excess of sites converted to the fusogenic state.Table IEffects of virus concentration on the pressure effects of enveloped virusesVirus concentrationp 501-aPressure that produces half of the changes in the center of spectral mass (tryptophan fluorescence) (average and S.D. of three experiments).Reduction in infectivity1-bDecrease in infectivity when the sample was subjected to 2.5 kbar for 8 h.

Open table in a new tab The pressure effects on Sindbis virus could also be observed by circular dichroism. The CD spectrum is complex because of the presence of several proteins. However, it can be seen that the secondary structure was not reduced by high-pressure treatment (Fig.3 E). In fact, it appears that there is a slight increase in the α-helix component. The pressure effects on Sindbis were compared with treatment with 8.0 m urea and with low pH (Fig.3 E). In contrast to pressurization, exposure to low pH substantially reduced the content of secondary structure, consistent with a difference in virus conformation (Fig. 3 E). As recently shown by Carr et al. (25Carr C.M. Chaudhry C. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14306-14313Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), exposure to low pH tends to denature the virus, first abolishing the infectivity and subsequently the fusogenic activity. For the same virus concentration, 8 m urea reduced the ellipticity value at 222 nm by more than 50%, indicating substantial denaturation of most of the proteins in the virus particle. Heat denaturation of the native and pressurized viruses were followed by changes in circular dichroism and revealed that the two particles underwent a similar cooperative transition (not shown). The influenza virus fusion assay relies on the measurement of lipid mixing between virus and liposomes. Lipid vesicles were prepared with two incorporated fluorescent lipid derivatives,N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)diacyl phosphatidylethanolamine (fluorescence donor) and rhodamine-phosphatidylethanolamine (fluorescence acceptor) as described in earlier studies (25Carr C.M. Chaudhry C. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14306-14313Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). On excitation of the donor fluorophore there is a resonance energy transfer to the acceptor fluorophore. The efficiency of energy transfer is dependent on the surface densities of fluorophores in membranes. When the fusion event takes place and mixing between labeled and unlabeled lipids happens, the density of fluorophores decreases causing a decrease in transfer efficiency. Thus an increase of the fluorescence intensity of the donor can be used to monitor the fusion process (25Carr C.M. Chaudhry C. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14306-14313Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The mechanism of influenza virus membrane fusion induced at low pH has been demonstrated in earlier studies that monitored the fusion activity of viral HA (15Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 531-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (2240) Google Scholar). As expected, we observed that the influenza virus membrane fusion activity was present after lowering the pH to 5.8 (Fig.4). Recently it has been shown that heat and urea induce a conformational change, at neutral pH, that is similar to the fusogenic state induced by low pH (25Carr C.M. Chaudhry C. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14306-14313Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). We find that high-pressure treatment elicits a dramatic fusion activity of influenza virus particles at neutral pH (Fig. 4). These results agree with the binding of bis-ANS (Fig. 1). To test the ability of Sindbis virus to fuse with membranes after pressure treatment, Sindbis virus was labeled biosynthetically with pyrene-labeled fatty acid as described previously (10Wahlberg J.M. Bron R. Wilschut J. Garoff H. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7309-7318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fusion assay relies on the measurement of lipid mixing between viral and ghost membranes (Fig.5 A). The pyrene fluorescence spectrum exhibits characteristic peaks at 389 and 410 nm (monomer fluorescence) and at 470 nm (excimer fluorescence). Excimers represent complexes between an excited state and a ground state probe molecule. Therefore, the pyrene excimer-to-monomer fluorescence ratio is proportional to the concentration of the pyrene probe. During the fusion between pyrene-labeled Sindbis virus and erythrocyte ghosts, the dilution of the pyrene phospholipids into the ghost target membranes can be monitored as a decrease in the pyrene excimer fluorescence. Both control and pyrene lipid-labeled virions had identical infectivity titers (data not shown). Fig. 5 (B and C) confirms earlier findings that Sindbis virus associates with membranes in vitro in a pH-dependent manner. The two lower curves in Fig.5 B show that pyrene phospholipid in the Sindbis virus at low pH or after pressurization (at neutral pH) undergoes a decline in excimer/monomer ratio on interaction with ghosts indicating membrane fusion that was complete by 30 min. The low pH curves were also performed at pH 5.8 and 5.5, and the results show lower curves compared with the low pH values used in our studies (data not shown). By comparison, the pyrene excimer/monomer ratio showed very little change in interaction of native Sindbis virus with ghosts at pH 7.5 for a period as long as 60 min. Fig. 5 C shows the values after 60 min for three experiments for each condition described in Fig.5 B. Pressure effects on enveloped viruses can be complex since they depend on a number of protein-lipid, protein-protein, and protein-nucleic acid interactions (19Silva J.L. Foguel D. Royer C.R.

https://openalex.org/W2107393031,"One of the fundamental differences among mammals is the mechanism of maintaining the corpus luteum of pregnancy. Placentation in primates is associated with the production of the glycoprotein hormone chorionic gonadotropin (CG), which is secreted into the maternal serum and stimulates progesterone synthesis from the corpus luteum, which is essential for early development of the embryo. CG together with the pituitary hormones lutropin (LH), follitropin, and thyrotropin constitute the family of glycoprotein hormones comprised of a common α subunit and a hormone-specific β subunit. The LHβ and CGβ subunits share 85% amino acid sequence identity, and functionally LH and CG are interchangeable. CGβ evolved by a recent gene duplication event from the LHβ locus, and despite the close relationship between them, their modes of secretion are quite different. CG release from the placenta is apically directed, whereas LH is released from the basal side of the cell, and the determinant(s) for this redirected trafficking are unknown. Here, using the polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line, we provide evidence for the molecular basis of the different secretory patterns of LH and CGin vivo. The apical targeting of CG is programmed by a carboxyl-terminal sequence, which encodes a novel sorting signal. It is also apparent that the presence of the O-linked oligosaccharides in the CTP sequence contributes to this apical routing.

Hamilton W.J. The Human Placenta. W. Heffer and Sons, Ltd., Cambridge1970: 157-174Google Scholar, 2Jaffe R.B. Yen S.S.C. Jaffe R.B. Reproductive Endocrinology. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1978: 521-536Google Scholar). Placentation in primates is coupled to the synthesis of glycoprotein hormone chorionic gonadotropin (CG),1 which is secreted into the maternal serum and stimulates progesterone synthesis from the corpus luteum, thereby allowing early implantation and development of the embryo (3Ogren L. Talamantes F. Knobil E. Neil J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction. Raven Press Ltd., New York1994: 875-945Google Scholar, 4Muyan M. Boime I. Placenta. 1997; 18: 237-241Google Scholar). CG and its pituitary counterpart, lutropin (LH), comprise a family of heterodimeric glycoprotein hormones, including follitropin and thyrotropin, that share a common α subunit, but differ in their hormone-specific β subunits (5Pierce J.G. Parsons T.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 465-495Google Scholar). Although the β subunits determine biological specificity of each hormone, there is significant structural similarity between them. This is most evident for the LHβ and CGβ subunits, which share 85% amino acid identity in the first 114 amino acids (6Shome B. Parlow A.F. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1973; 36: 618-621Google Scholar). A major difference between the two subunits is the presence in the CGβ subunit of a 31-amino acid carboxyl-terminal extension (CTP) compared with a shorter 7-amino acid stretch in LHβ (see “Results”). The CGβ subunit is specific to primates and evolved by a gene duplication event from the LHβ locus (7Fiddes J.C. Talmadge K. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1984; 40: 43-78Google Scholar); functionally the two are interchangeable. Similar to other mammals, primates express LH during pregnancy, raising the question as to why primates require CG. When comparing the biosynthesis of LH and CG, two important differences emerge: the pathways of secretion and polarity of their release. LH is packaged into storage granules (8Lloyd J.M. Childs G.V. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 1282-1290Google Scholar), subject to regulated exocytosis by secretagogues (9Conn P.M. McArdle C.A. Andrews W.V. Huckle W.R. Biol. Reprod. 1987; 36: 17-35Google Scholar), and released via the basolateral surface of pituitary gonadotrope cells (10Currie R.J.W. McNeilly A.S. J. Endocrinol. 1995; 147: 259-270Google Scholar, 11Thomas S.G. Clarke I.J. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1347-1350Google Scholar). In contrast, CG is secreted by an apical route through the villous and directly into the intervillous space created by the implanted placenta (1Boyd J.D. Hamilton W.J. The Human Placenta. W. Heffer and Sons, Ltd., Cambridge1970: 157-174Google Scholar, 12Suemizu H. Osamura Y. Watanabe K. Acta Histochem. Cytochem. 1988; 21: 265-271Google Scholar, 13Thiede H.A. Choate J.W. Obstet.

The molecular basis by which the intracellular trafficking of CG is directed to exit the chorionic villi into the maternal lumen is unknown. To examine whether the unique circulation profiles exhibited by LH and CG in vivo are reflected in differences in polarized secretion, and to identify potential targeting sequences, we co-transfected the common α subunit and LHβ/CGβ genes into Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. This cell line is an excellent model to study polarized secretion of endogenous and exogenous proteins in culture (15Gottlieb T.A. Beadry G. Rizzolo L. Colman A. Rindler M. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2100-2104Google Scholar, 16Matter K. Mellman I. Current Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 545-554Google Scholar). The plasma membrane of these epithelial cells is divided into apical and basolateral domains by tight junctions (17Rodriguez-Boulan E. Nelson W.J. Science. 1989; 245: 718-725Google Scholar). The apical side faces the luminal or exterior milieu, which is covered by microvilli and is involved in absorptive or secretory processes, whereas the basolateral side faces the serosal environment (16Matter K. Mellman I. Current Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 545-554Google Scholar, 17Rodriguez-Boulan E. Nelson W.J. Science. 1989; 245: 718-725Google Scholar). Here we examined the polarized secretion of LH and CG in transfected MDCK cells and show that apical targeting of CG is programmed by the unique CTP, a novel sorting signal that is generated by a single frameshift mutation in the ancestral LHβ gene. Polyclonal antisera directed against the α and CGβ subunit were prepared in this laboratory. Purified hCG (CR-127; 14,900 IU/mg) was provided by Dr. A. F. Parlow (National Hormone and Pituitary Program, National Institutes of Health, Torrance, CA). MDCK cells (strain II) were a gift of Dr. Sharon Milgram (University of North Carolina). These cells were grown in DMEM/F-12 medium (for no more than 10–15 passages) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and containing 5% FBS (v/v) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator (18Simons K. Virta H. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, New York1998: 101-106Google Scholar). The cells (3.5 × 105 cells/ml) were seeded on 12-mm or 24-mm Transwell filters (0.4 μm pore size, Corning-Costar, Cambridge, MA) allowing separate access of media to the apical and basolateral faces of the membrane. Filter-grown cells were cultured for 3–4 days with changes of medium daily. To measure the integrity of epithelial monolayer and formation of tight junctions (as an indicator of achieving polarization), electrical resistance was measured across the cell monolayer using the Millicell Electrical Resistance System (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) (18Simons K. Virta H. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, New York1998: 101-106Google Scholar). Transfection was performed using the DNA-calcium-phosphate precipitation method as described previously (19Matzuk M.M. Krieger M. Corless C. Boime I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6354-6358Google Scholar). Cells grown on plastic dishes were stably transfected with pM2HA (20Sugahara T. Pixley M.R. Minami S. Perlas E. Ben-Menahem D. Hsueh A.J.W. Boime I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 95: 2041-2045Google Scholar, 21Matzuk M.M. Hsueh A.J.W. LaPolt P. Tsafriri A. Keene J. Boime I. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 376-383Google Scholar) containing either the α, LHβ, CGβ, or CGβ114 subunit genes. MDCK cells were labeled overnight with 25 μCi/ml [35S]cysteine in DMEM/F-12 medium lacking cysteine and supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum,l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin (20Sugahara T. Pixley M.R. Minami S. Perlas E. Ben-Menahem D. Hsueh A.J.W. Boime I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 95: 2041-2045Google Scholar). Labeling medium was added to the apical and basolateral compartments, and media from them were collected into separate tubes and were immunoprecipitated with antisera directed against α and CGβ subunits using Pansorbin. The reduced (with 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) and heated (4 min) proteins were resolved as on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels described previously (19Matzuk M.M. Krieger M. Corless C. Boime I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6354-6358Google Scholar). We first examined the secretion patterns of the LH and CG dimers from transfected MDCK cells grown in Transwells and labeled overnight with [35S]cysteine. The media were immunoprecipitated with CGβ antiserum, which reacts equally well with either the LHβ or CGβ subunits; co-precipitation of the α subunit is indicative of heterodimer formation. LH dimer released from the cells was primarily associated with the basolateral side, indicating that it is secreted in a polarized manner (Fig. 1A,lanes 1 and 2). The basolateral to apical ratio for LH was 3:1 (76.2 ± 1.6% and 23.8 ± 1.6%, respectively: n = 6; p < 0.05) (Fig.1B). Control experiments demonstrated that when the integrity of the monolayer was disrupted with a cell scraper, determined by reduction in electrical resistance, LH dimer traversed the filter and distributed equally to both compartments (Fig.1A, lanes 3 and 4). The preferential basolateral routing of LH is consistent with its known distribution and release from the pituitary (10Currie R.J.W. McNeilly A.S. J. Endocrinol. 1995; 147: 259-270Google Scholar, 11Thomas S.G. Clarke I.J. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1347-1350Google Scholar). LH-containing secretory granules redistribute subcellularly and become polarized to the side of the gonadotrope nearest to the vascular sinusoid during the preovulatory stage, and release of the granule content occurs in the basal region of the cell (10Currie R.J.W. McNeilly A.S. J. Endocrinol. 1995; 147: 259-270Google Scholar, 11Thomas S.G. Clarke I.J. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1347-1350Google Scholar). In contrast to LH, CG was secreted preferentially into the apical compartment (Fig. 2A,lanes 1 and 2). Densitometric analysis of labeled bands demonstrated an apical to basolateral ratio of 2.7:1 (73 ± 1.5% versus 27 ± 1.5%, respectively:n = 6; p < 0.05) (Fig. 2B). These data reflect differences in the secretion behavior of CG compared with its pituitary homologue LH. The apical secretion of CG is consistent with its in vivo release, since CG enters the maternal blood lakes of the uterus via an apical route through the villous (1Boyd J.D. Hamilton W.J. The Human Placenta. W. Heffer and Sons, Ltd., Cambridge1970: 157-174Google Scholar, 12Suemizu H. Osamura Y. Watanabe K. Acta Histochem. Cytochem. 1988; 21: 265-271Google Scholar, 13Thiede H.A. Choate J.W. Obstet. Gynecol. 1963; 22: 433-443Google Scholar, 14Wynn R.M. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1972; 114: 339-355Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). To examine the possibility of nonspecific transfer of CG and LH across the MDCK cell monolayer, conditioned media containing35S-labeled CG or LH from the MDCK cell-line was added to nontransfected MDCK cells grown on Transwell filters. After overnight incubation lysates and media from the apical and basolateral compartments were immunoprecipitated. No transfer of protein from one compartment to the other was detected (data not shown), indicating direct and specific sorting of CG and LH into the apical and basolateral compartments, respectively. These data demonstrate that the MDCK model recapitulates the secretion polarity for pituitary LH and placental CG as seen in vivo. Numerous studies have shown that the uncombined α subunit is primarily secreted constitutively (22Corless C.L. Boime I. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 1699-1706Google Scholar, 23Blomquist J.F. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20798-20803Google Scholar). To assess the specificity of the MDCK model, cells expressing only the α subunit were examined (Fig. 3). In this case the secretion pattern was random, i.e. the α subunit was observed equally in both compartments (Fig. 3A, lanes 1and 2). Presumably, the differential sorting exhibited by LH and CG is due to the β subunit, since the α subunit is the same for both hormones. To test this prediction, and to address the question if dimer formation is a prerequisite for sorting, MDCK cells expressing either the LHβ or CGβ subunits were grown on Transwells (Fig. 3,lanes 3–6). The β subunits exhibited the same polarity as the corresponding dimers, indicating that the sorting signals are encoded in the hormone-specific β subunit, and heterodimer formation is not required for the secretion polarity. Based on their extensive sequence identity, it was suggested that CGβ evolved from an ancestral LHβ gene (7Fiddes J.C. Talmadge K. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1984; 40: 43-78Google Scholar). The sequences of the carboxyl ends of the LHβ and CGβ termini are shown in SchemeFS1. (The shaded areas indicate identical sequence, and the asterisks show theO-linked serine acceptor site in the CGβ subunits.) A single base pair deletion at codon 114 in the ancestral gene lead to generation of an mRNA encoding the CGβ subunit composed of 145 amino acids compared with the 121 amino acids of the LHβ subunit, and thus the two proteins have different COOH-terminal sequences (7Fiddes J.C. Talmadge K. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1984; 40: 43-78Google Scholar). The seven amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of LHβ are very hydrophobic; in contrast, the CGβ carboxyl end is hydrophilic containing several serine residues, of which four areO-glycosylated. Thus, the apparent major evolutionary change from LHβ to the CGβ subunit was the appearance of the CTP. CG serum levels rise rapidly in the first trimester of pregnancy and decline thereafter (4Muyan M. Boime I. Placenta. 1997; 18: 237-241Google Scholar, 24Owen D.M. Ryan K.J. Tulchinsky D. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1989; 53: 1307-1309Google Scholar). It is widely accepted that the main role for the CTP sequence is to enhance the circulatory half-life of CG during peak synthesis (21Matzuk M.M. Hsueh A.J.W. LaPolt P. Tsafriri A. Keene J. Boime I. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 376-383Google Scholar, 25Braunstein G.D. Vaitukaitis J.L. Ross G. Endocrinology. 1972; 91: 1030-1036Google Scholar, 26Sowers J.R. Peksary A.E. Hershman J.M. Kanter M. DiStefano J.J. J. Endocrinol. 1979; 80: 83-89Google Scholar), maintaining a bolus of activity in early gestation to stimulate maternal progesterone production in the corpus luteum. However, our data implicate a novel role for this sequence as a routing signal. To examine whether the CTP is essential for polarity, a stop codon was introduced at residue 115 of the CGβ subunit (21Matzuk M.M. Hsueh A.J.W. LaPolt P. Tsafriri A. Keene J. Boime I. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 376-383Google Scholar), resulting in a truncated protein of 114 amino acids (CGβ114) (Fig.2A, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast to wild type CG dimer, the dimer bearing the CGβ114 mutant (CG114) was secreted basolaterally (68.9% ± 1.7: n = 6;p < 0.05) (Fig. 2B). These results confirm that the carboxyl-terminal sequence of the CGβ subunit is a major routing signal for the apical secretion of CG dimer. It has been reported that N- and O-linked oligosaccharides are associated with apical sorting signals for some glycoproteins. The O-glycosylated stalked region of the neurotrophin receptor has been implicated in its sorting to the apical membrane, since deletion of this region lead to a mistargeting of the mutant protein to the basolateral membrane in MDCK cells (27Yeaman C. Le Gall A.H. Baldwin A.N. Monlauzeur L. Le Biric A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 929-940Google Scholar). Moreover, eliminating or reducing the number of O-glycans affects the polarity of intestinal brush border enzymes released from MDCK cells (28Naim H.Y. Joberty G. Alfalah M. Jacob R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17961-17967Google Scholar, 29Jacob R. Alfalh M. Grünberg J. Obendorf M. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6566-6572Google Scholar). However, deleting the O-linked oligosaccharides from aminopeptidase N had no effect on its apical secretion pattern from MDCK cells (28Naim H.Y. Joberty G. Alfalah M. Jacob R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17961-17967Google Scholar). Because there are fourO-linked oligosaccharides in the CTP sequence, it is unclear whether the targeting function of CTP is encoded in the protein sequence and/or the carbohydrate. To address whether theO-linked carbohydrate in the CTP contributes to the apical secretion of CG, we constructed a CGβ mutant (CGβ-Odg) (Fig.4A) in which the four serine acceptor sites at residues 121, 127, 132, and 138 in the CTP were changed to alanine. (The Ser at position 130 was also mutated in this variant because we observed that some alternativeO-glycosylation occurred at this site when the mutant was expressed in CHO cells.) 2V. Garcia-Campayo and I. Boime, manuscript in preparation. Synthesis of CG dimer bearing this mutation (Fig. 4A,lanes 1 and 2) or the uncombined CGβ mutant (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 4) displayed a basolateral preference (68.3% ± 2.8 and 79% ± 2.2, respectively;p < 0.05) (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that the apical sorting signaling of the CTP is mediated by theO-linked oligosaccharides. A distinguishing structural feature between the LHβ and CGβ subunits is that the LHβ subunit contains one N-linked oligosaccharide, whereas CGβ contains two units. Thus, while the CTP is sufficient to route CG apically, we cannot exclude that the observed sorting is achieved in concert with the additional N-linked oligosaccharide on the CGβ subunit. There is evidence thatN-glycans can act as apical signals for some secretory and integral membrane proteins (30Scheiffelle P. Peränen J. Simons K. Nature. 1995; 378: 96-98Google Scholar), but their exact role is unclear (31Rodriguez-Boulan E. Gonzalez A. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 291-294Google Scholar), since many glycoproteins do not display glycan-dependent apical targeting (32Kitagawa Y. Sano Y. Veda M. Higashio K. Narita H. Okano M. Matsumpto S.I. Sasaki R. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 213: 449-457Google Scholar). This indicates that the contribution ofN-glycans to apical targeting is protein specific. It has been suggested that N-glycans do not function as sorting signals directly but rather play an accessory role necessary for the function of an apical determinant (31Rodriguez-Boulan E. Gonzalez A. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 291-294Google Scholar, 33Gut A. Kappeler F. Hyka N. Balda M. Hauri H.P. Matter K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1919-1989Google Scholar). There are several reports showing that motifs consisting of a tyrosine residue near at least one hydrophobic amino acid, or a motif bearing a leucine/leucine or a leucine/isoleucine pair are involved in basolateral sorting of membrane proteins (34Hunziker W. Fumey C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2963-2969Google Scholar, 35Simonsen A. Bremnes B. Nordeng T.W. Bakke O. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 25-32Google Scholar, 36Marks M.S. Woodruff L. Ohno H. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 341-354Google Scholar). It is intriguing that the unique carboxyl-terminal heptapeptide in the LHβ subunit contains the dileucine motif. Why only the CGβ subunit among the glycoprotein hormone family contains CTP is unclear. Expression of CG in the placenta suggests that this extension is a critical factor in the gestational role of CG. A major function of the placenta during pregnancy is the exchange of metabolic products between the fetal and maternal blood streams (1Boyd J.D. Hamilton W.J. The Human Placenta. W. Heffer and Sons, Ltd., Cambridge1970: 157-174Google Scholar). Thus, the CTP directs CG apically from the fetally derived placenta into the maternal intervillus spaces; these are luminal compartments filled with maternal blood derived from pressure gradients generated in the spiral arteries. Our data reveal that LH, which is elaborated by the pituitary directly into a single vascular compartment, is distinct from the production of humoral agents in the feto-placental unit. The use of the MDCK model has permitted the identification of a novel targeting domain that reversed the polarity of two evolutionarily related heterodimers, which activate the identical receptor. The appearance of CTP represents not only an adaptive response to maintain a high level of circulating gonadotropin, but also a targeting signal redirecting a pituitary function to the placenta, thus ensuring a successful implantation and development of the primate embryo. We are grateful to Drs. Rajendra Kumar, Ross Cagan, David Ornitz, Mark Boothby, and Sharon Milgram for their helpful comments regarding the manuscript. We also thank Dr. Thomas Woolsey for his advice during the study, and Kristy Chamberlain for her excellent assistance in the preparation of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2145655630,"Mammalian candidate effectors of the small GTPase Ras, such as RalGDS, afadin/AF-6, Rin1, and phospholipase Cε, have been shown to share structurally conserved modules termed Ras-associating (RA) domains at their Ras-binding sites. The Ras-binding domains of Raf-1 and phosphoinositide 3-kinase γ (other Ras effectors) also share a similar tertiary structure with the RA domains. On the other hand, the primary Ras-binding site ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae adenylyl cyclase, the best characterized Ras effector, has been mapped by mutational studies to the leucine-rich repeats (LRR) domain (amino acids 674–1300), whose structure apparently bears no resemblance to the RA domains. By a computer algorithm-based search we have unexpectedly found an RA domain in the N-terminal 81 amino acid residues (676) of the LRR domain. The purified RA-domain polypeptide exhibits an ability to bind directly to Ras in a GTP-dependent manner and to competitively inhibit Ras-dependent activation of adenylyl cyclasein vitro, with an affinity comparable with that of the whole LRR domain. The specificity of binding of the RA domain to various Ras effector region mutants is indistinguishable from that of the full-length adenylyl cyclase. The activated RAS2 (RAS2Val-19)-dependent heat shock sensitivity of yeast cells is suppressed by overexpression of the RA domain polypeptide. Further, mutations of the RA domain abolish its Ras binding activity, and adenylyl cyclase molecules carrying these mutations are rendered unactivatable by Ras in vitro. This RA domain bears highest similarity to the Ras-binding domain of Raf-1 based on comparison of its primary and predicted secondary structures with those of other Ras effectors. These results indicate that the RA domain is a primary Ras-binding site for activation of adenylyl cyclase, implicating RA domains as universal modules for interaction of effectors with Ras, conserved from yeast to mammals. Mammalian candidate effectors of the small GTPase Ras, such as RalGDS, afadin/AF-6, Rin1, and phospholipase Cε, have been shown to share structurally conserved modules termed Ras-associating (RA) domains at their Ras-binding sites.

By a computer algorithm-based search we have unexpectedly found an RA domain in the N-terminal 81 amino acid residues (676) of the LRR domain. The purified RA-domain polypeptide exhibits an ability to bind directly to Ras in a GTP-dependent manner and to competitively inhibit Ras-dependent activation of adenylyl cyclasein vitro, with an affinity comparable with that of the whole LRR domain. The specificity of binding of the RA domain to various Ras effector region mutants is indistinguishable from that of the full-length adenylyl cyclase. The activated RAS2 (RAS2Val-19)-dependent heat shock sensitivity of yeast cells is suppressed by overexpression of the RA domain polypeptide. Further, mutations of the RA domain abolish its Ras binding activity, and adenylyl cyclase molecules carrying these mutations are rendered unactivatable by Ras in vitro. This RA domain bears highest similarity to the Ras-binding domain of Raf-1 based on comparison of its primary and predicted secondary structures with those of other Ras effectors. These results indicate that the RA domain is a primary Ras-binding site for activation of adenylyl cyclase, implicating RA domains as universal modules for interaction of effectors with Ras, conserved from yeast to mammals. leucine-rich repeat adenylyl cyclase-associated protein Ras-associating domain Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator phospholipase C Ras-binding domain phosphoinositide 3-kinase glutathione S-transferase guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) guanosine 5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid Ras proteins are small guanine nucleotide-binding proteins cycling between the active GTP-bound and the inactive GDP-bound states. They are conserved from yeasts to mammals and essential signaling components regulating a number of biological responses. The budding yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae has two RAS genes,RAS1 and RAS2, that encode proteins highly homologous to mammalian Ras proto-oncogene products (1Gibbs J.B. Marshall M. Microbiol.

The yeast RAS proteins are essential regulatory elements of adenylyl cyclase, which catalyzes the production of cAMP, a second messenger vital for yeast cell growth. The Ras-cAMP pathway is implicated in transduction of glucose-triggered signals to intracellular environments where cAMP initiates protein phosphorylation cascades. Yeast cells bearing the activated RAS2 gene, RAS2Val-19, exhibit an elevated level of intracellular cAMP and display abnormal phenotypes, including sensitivity to heat shock, sensitivity to nutritional starvation, and failure to sporulate (3Kataoka T.

The middle repetitive domain is composed of a repetition of a 23-amino acid amphipathic leucine-rich motif and hence is called the LRR1 domain. Introduction of insertion or point mutations into virtually any LRR unit abrogated RAS2-dependent activation of adenylyl cyclase, implicating the LRR domain as a primary Ras interaction site (9Colicelli J.

Its N-terminal region is required for the proper function of the Ras-cAMP pathway, while its C-terminal region is involved in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (13Wang J. Suzuki N. Nishida Y.

One is a GTP-dependent high affinity interaction between Ras and the LRR domain. The other is a GTP-independent weak interaction between Ras and a complex of adenylyl cyclase and CAP, which is dependent upon post-translational modification, in particular farnesylation, of Ras. The latter interaction successfully explains the reason why farnesylation of Ras is essential for the efficient activation of adenylyl cyclase by Ras (19Kuroda Y. Suzuki N. Kataoka T. Science. 1993; 259: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).Recently a computer algorithm-based study by Ponting and Benjamin (20Ponting C.P. Benjamin D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 422-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) revealed the existence of a motif of roughly 100 amino acid residues, called RAD, which was conserved among Ras-binding regions of mammalian RalGDS, Rin1, and afadin/AF-6 (20Ponting C.P. Benjamin D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 422-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). A Ras homologue Rap1, which possesses the identical effector region with Ras, was shown to bind to almost all of these RADs as well. Subsequent studies identified RADs in a variety of other Ras/Rap1 effector candidates including PLCε (21−24) and RA-GEF-1 (25Liao Y. Kariya K. Hu C.-D. Shibatohge M. Goshima M. Okada T. Watari Y.

Interestingly, x-ray crystallographic studies revealed that the overall tertiary structure of RalGDS RAD is similar to those of Raf-1 and PI3-Kγ RBDs, although no extensive sequence similarity is found among them (27Nassar N.

These studies as well as various mutational studies on Ras revealed that the effector regions of Ras and Rap1 (amino acid 32–40 of mammalian Ras/Rap1) are mainly responsible for the associations with the RAD/RBDs. Although the studies described above implied a universal nature of RADs as primary Ras-binding sites of the Ras effectors, yeast adenylyl cyclase comprised a notable exception because its LRR domain did not appear to bear any resemblance to RADs.In this study, a computer algorithm-based search has unexpectedly predicted a RAD in the N-terminal part of the LRR domain of yeast adenylyl cyclase. Evidence is presented for the essential function of the RAD in association with Ras.DISCUSSIONAlthough genetic and biochemical studies by this and other groups (9Colicelli J. Field J. Ballester R. Chester N. Young D. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2539-2543Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 10Suzuki N. Choe H.-R. Nishida Y. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Ohnishi S. Tamaoki T. Kataoka T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8711-8715Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) previously indicated the crucial role of the LRR structure in Ras-dependent activation of adenylyl cyclase, the present study has clearly demonstrated that the RAD located in amino acids 676–756, overlapping with the LRR structure, is responsible for the direct association with Ras. This was proven by observation of the GTP-dependent association of human Ha-Ras with the RAD polypeptide with an affinity comparable to that of the whole LRR domain polypeptide. The binding activity of the RAD to yeast RAS2 was demonstrated by its ability to suppress the RAS2Val-19-dependent heatshock sensitivity when overexpressed in yeast cells. Further, specific mutations of the RAD, which abolished its Ras binding activity, were shown also to abrogate the in vitro response of adenylyl cyclase to Ras protein. These results are in good agreement with our previous data, which indicated that N-terminal deletions down to amino acid 657 had no effect on the response of adenylyl cyclase to Ras (10Suzuki N. Choe H.-R. Nishida Y. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Ohnishi S. Tamaoki T. Kataoka T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8711-8715Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The detrimental effect of various mutations affecting the LRR structure on Ras-dependent activation, which we previously observed, appears indirect: it may be ascribed to a change in conformations of adenylyl cyclase, which may affect the allosteric transmission of the Ras-binding signal to the C-terminal catalytic domain. In fact, adenylyl cyclase molecules carrying these mutations were observed to form a high molecular weight complex, whose size was considerably greater than that of the wild-type adenylyl cyclase, which may reflect a change in the oligomeric state of adenylyl cyclase (11Wang J. Suzuki N. Kataoka T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4937-4945Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).RADs were discovered through a computer algorithm-based analysis by Ponting and Benjamin (20Ponting C.P. Benjamin D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 422-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) as domains of about 100 amino acids whose primary structures were conserved in a variety of Ras/Rap1 effectors and effector candidates including mammalian RalGDS and its homologues Rlf and Rgl, afadin/AF-6, and its Drosophila melanogaster homologue Canoe and Rin1 (20Ponting C.P. Benjamin D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 422-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies identified RADs in Ras/Rap1 effector candidates including PLCε and RA-GEF-1 (21Song C. Hu C.-D. Masago M. Kariyai K. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Shibatohge M. Wu D. Satoh T. Kataoka T. J.

The RADs of these effector and effector candidates exactly corresponded to their GTP-dependent Ras/Rap1-binding sites. The RAD sequences were extremely divergent with one another and required sensitive profile methods for detection. This extreme sequence divergence suggested possible divergence of their binding partners. In fact, the RADs of the Ras/Rap1 effectors exhibited mutually distinct binding specificities toward various effector region mutants of Ras as well as toward Ras and Rap1. For example, RalGDS RAD binds more strongly to Rap1 than to Ras, whereas Raf-1 RBD exhibits an opposite binding specificity toward Rap1 and Ras (40Herrmann C. Horn G. Spaargaren M. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6794-6800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 41Vetter I.R. Linnemann T. Wohlgemuth S. Geyer M. Kalbitzer H.R. Herrmann C. Wittinghofer A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Moreover, some RADs that bound small GTPases other than Ras and Rap1 were identified: the RADs of RA-GEF-2 and GFR/MR-GEF were reported to bind specifically to M-Ras (R-Ras3) but not to Ras and Rap1 (42Ichiba T.

On the other hand, the amino acid sequences of the RBDs of Raf-1 and PI3-Kγ did not score high with the RAD searching program. However, it was found that the majority of hydrophobic residues of Raf-1 RBD were conserved with the RAD sequences and that the predicted secondary structure of Raf-1 RBD using the fold-recognition algorithm (46Russell R.B. Copley R.R. Barton G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 349-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) matched those of RADs (20Ponting C.P. Benjamin D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 422-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In fact, it was demonstrated by a series of x-ray crystallographic studies that the tertiary structures of RBDs of Raf-1 and PI3-Kγ display a considerable similarity to that of RalGDS RAD despite the quite limited identities in their primary structures (27Nassar N.

The crystal structures of Raf-1 RBD complexed with Rap1 and RalGDS RAD complexed with Ras revealed that the first two β-strands (β1 and β2), the next α-helix (α1), and a following loop are important for the interaction with the small GTPases (27Nassar N.

In general, the interactions are mediated mainly by hydrogen bonds and polar interactions formed by charged residues and both main-chain and side-chain polar groups. Only a few hydrophobic contacts are formed. In case of RalGDS, the major interaction between Ras and its RAD occurs between two antiparallel β-strands; β2 of Ras including the switch I/effector region and β2 of the RAD, using hydrogen-bond networks formed between these two β-strands (29Huang L.

Biol. 1998; 5: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Raf-1 RBD also employs a quite similar mechanism for interaction with Rap1 (27Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann H. Scherer A. McCormick F.

The effector region of Ras/Rap1 is acidic and generates a negatively charged surface patch that interacts with a positively charged patch generated by basic residues of the RAD/RBDs (27Nassar N.

Indeed, previous mutational analyses indicated that some of these charged residues were crucial for binding to Ras/Rap1 (27Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann H. Scherer A. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A.

When the primary structures of RalGDS RAD and two RADs (N-terminal and C-terminal RADs) of afadin/AF-6 were aligned with one another, all of the three basic residues corresponding to Arg-784, Lys-796, and Lys-816 of RalGDS RAD were conserved in both N-terminal and C-terminal RADs (Fig.6A), suggesting that afadin/AF-6 RADs may be classified into the RalGDS RAD group.On the other hand, Raf-1 RBD exhibits a different mode of interaction with Ras/Rap1 for the following reasons. Arg-59 corresponds to Arg-784 of RalGDS in the β1-strand, but Arg-59 makes a strong hydrogen bond with Glu-37 of Ras/Rap1 in contrast to the ionic interaction of Arg-784. Strikingly, Raf-1 RBD lacks two Lys residues corresponding to Lys-796 and Lys-816 of RalGDS in its β2-strand and α1-helix, respectively. Instead, Arg-89 forms a hydrogen bond with Asp-38 of Ras/Rap1 and makes a main binding surface in the α1-helix, thereby functionally substituting for Lys-816 of RalGDS (27Nassar N. Horn G.

It comprises the core ACNase polypeptide PrrC and type IC DNA restriction-modification enzyme EcoprrI that masks PrrCs activity (2Levitz R. Chapman D. Amitsur M. Green R. Snyder L. Kaufmann G.

Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 857-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Cleavage of tRNALys5′ to the wobble base ensues, yielding 2′:3′-cyclic phosphate (2′:3′-p>) and 5′-OH termini. However, the lesion is normally offset by the phage T4-encoded polynucleotide kinase and RNA ligase (7Amitsur M. Levitz R. Kaufmann G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2499-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar).The active form of the core polypeptide PrrC has not been purified to homogeneity. Yet PrrC certainly harbors the ACNase function, judged from the manifestation of ACNase activity by E. coli (8Morad I. Chapman-Shimshoni D. Amitsur M. Kaufmann G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26842-26849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and mammalian cells overexpressing PrrC (9Shterman N. Elroy-Stein O. Morad I. Amitsur M. Kaufmann G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1744-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Moreover, a tRNALys anticodon recognition site has been pinpointed in a cluster of selected PrrC mutations, two adjacent members of which (D287Y, S288P) alter the cleavage site specificity (10Meidler R. Morad I. Amitsur M. Inokuchi H. Kaufmann G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Other mutations directed into this site (D287H, D287Q, or D287N) alter the specificity so that tRNALys forms with a hypomodified wobble base, otherwise poor substrates, are rendered more reactive than the natural. These compensatory effects suggest the existence of a specific interaction between the Asp287 residue of PrrC and the modified wobble base (11Jiang Y. Meidler R. Amitsur M. Kaufmann G. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).Comparing bacterial and mammalian tRNALys substrates of ACNase has suggested that the specificity determinants reside in the anticodon loop and lower part of the anticodon stem (9Shterman N. Elroy-Stein O. Morad I. Amitsur M. Kaufmann G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1744-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). These determinants must include the anticodon sequence, judged from the following observations. First, the anticodon of tRNALysresembles the anticodons of most secondary substrates cleaved when PrrC is overexpressed (10Meidler R. Morad I. Amitsur M. Inokuchi H. Kaufmann G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Second, most single anticodon base substitutions in unmodified tRNALys abolish ACNase reactivity. Third, a substrate analog with a tRNALys anticodon transplanted in an otherwise tRNAArg sequence is as reactive as the wild type tRNALys sequence (11Jiang Y. Meidler R. Amitsur M. Kaufmann G. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).The anticodon stem and loop (ASL) domain of E. colitRNALys contains three modified bases that profoundly affect its conformation (12Sundaram M. Durant P.C. Davis D.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12575-12584Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). They include the doubly modified wobble base 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine (mnm5S2U34), 6-threonyl carbamoyladenosine 3′ to the anticodon (t6A37) and the pseudouridine of the lower base pair of the stem (Ψ39). Comparing the NMR solution structures of a synthetic, fully modified tRNALys ASL and hypomodified counterparts has suggested that mnm5s2U34 and t6A37 rigidify the anticodon in a predominantly A-RNA stacked conformation. In addition, t6A37 modestly destabilizes the base pairing interactions of the ASL while mnm5s2U34 and Ψ39 counteract this effect (12Sundaram M. Durant P.C. Davis D.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12575-12584Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that these conformational effects influence ACNase reactivity. However, some of the modifying groups could also interact with PrrC directly (11Jiang Y. Meidler R. Amitsur M. Kaufmann G. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although the ASL seems the prime target of ACNase, weaker interactions with other substrate regions,e.g. the acceptor domain, are not excluded. This is suggested by the observations that substituting the discriminator base A73 partially inhibits ACNase and truncating the ACCA 3′-overhang relaxes the cleavage site specificity (11Jiang Y. Meidler R. Amitsur M. Kaufmann G. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the tRNA acceptor domain helps position ACNase for the native substrate and that alternative RNA-protein interactions may form in the ACCA truncated mutants as well as for A73 mutants.Here we report that ACNase efficiently cleaves a synthetic tRNALys ASL containing the base modifications ofE. coli tRNALys. Comparing it with various hypomodified and unmodified analogs revealed opposing effects of the base modifications on ACNase reactivity. Correlating these data with the observed contributions of the base modifications to the ASL solution structure (12Sundaram M. Durant P.C. Davis D.R.

We also show that the PrrC D287H mutation renders human tRNALys3 relatively more reactive than the natural substrate. This finding and the inhibitory effect of the side chain of the tRNALys-3 modified wobble base (5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine, mcm5s2U34) reinforce the previously proposed interaction between PrrC residue Asp287 and the side chain of the E. coli tRNALys wobble base (11Jiang Y.

https://openalex.org/W1508963495,"Integrin adhesion receptors have been implicated in bidirectional signal transduction. The dynamic regulation of integrin affinity and avidity as well as post-ligand effects involved in outside-in signaling depends on the interaction of integrins with cytoskeletal and signaling proteins. In this study, we attempted to identify cytoplasmic binding partners of α1β1 integrin. We were able to show that cell adhesion to α1β1-specific substrates results in the association of phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) with the α1β1 integrin independent of PLCγ tyrosine phosphorylation. Using peptide-binding assays, the membrane proximal sequences within the α1β1integrin subunits were identified as binding sites for PLCγ. In particular, the conserved sequence of β1 subunit binds the enzyme very efficiently. Because purified PLCγ also binds the integrin peptides, binding seems to be direct. Inhibition of PLC byU73122 leads to reduced cell adhesion on α1β1-specific substrates. Cells lacking the conserved domain of the α1 subunit fail to respond to the PLC inhibition, indicating that this domain is necessary for PLC-dependent adhesion modulation of α1β1 integrin.

Cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix is a biologically important event providing structural and signaling information for biological processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (1Albelda S.M. Buck C.A. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2868-2880Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar, 2Sastry S.K. Horwitz A.F. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 455-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These adhesive interactions are basically mediated by integrins, a large family of heterodimeric transmembrane cell surface receptors (3Hynes R.O. Cell. 1987; 48: 549-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3079) Google Scholar). Besides connecting the extracellular matrix with the cytoskeleton, integrins are also capable of specifically inducing various signaling pathways upon ligand binding. These include the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, Rho A and protein kinase C, as well as the modulation of phosphoinositide levels, leading to cell cycle control and cytoskeletal reorganization (outside-in signaling) (4Howe A. Aplin A.E. Alahari S.K. Juliano R.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 220-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 5Cary L.A. Han D.C. Guan J.L. Histol. Histopathol. 1999; 14: 1001-1009PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, signals from inside the cell can modulate the integrin affinity for its ligands followed by changes in cell adhesion and migration (inside-out signaling) (6Hughes P.E. Pfaff M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 359-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar).Engagement of integrins results in integrin clustering and binding of signaling and cytoskeletal proteins to the integrin-cytoplasmic domains, leading to the formation of multiprotein complexes called focal adhesions. Focal adhesions anchor actin filaments and are the starting points of integrin-dependent signaling processes.The cytoplasmic domains of β integrin subunits are essential for recruiting integrins to focal adhesions and for initiating integrin signaling. A number of proteins has been identified so far, which interact with specific sequences of the cytoplasmic domain of β integrin subunits (7Liu S. Calderwood D.A. Ginsberg M.H. J.

However, recent studies have demonstrated that α-cytoplasmic domains also functionally associate with proteins. Paxillin binds to specific residues of the α4-cytoplasmic domain, thereby regulating cell spreading (11Liu S. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol.

Whereas both proteins bind to membrane distal sequences in the α-cytoplasmic domains, another protein, calreticulin, has been shown to bind to the highly conserved Gly-Phe-Phe-Lys-Arg (GFFKR) motif and to be a modulator of integrin-initiated signaling (13Coppolino M.G.

Neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells induced by NGF is accompanied by α1β1integrin up-regulation, suggesting a role of α1β1 in neurite outgrowth (20Zhang Z. Tarone G. Turner D.C. J. Biol.

PLCγ coimmunoprecipitates with the α1β1 integrin in PC12 cells in an adhesion- and time-dependent manner. For this binding, tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ is not required. We identified the conserved membrane-proximal sequence of the β1 subunit as an efficient binding site for PLCγ. Furthermore, PLCγ associates with a peptide corresponding to the conserved GFFKR motif of the α1 subunit. The inhibition of PLCγ activity leads to reduced adhesion of PC12 cells and CHO cells transfected with α1β1 integrin. The deletion of the conserved GFFKR motif abrogates the sensitivity of the integrin receptor to PLC inhibition and to phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibition, indicating that the α1-cytoplasmic domain is involved in PLCγ-dependent inside-out signaling by integrins.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we provide evidence that PLCγ associates with α1β1 integrin-cytoplasmic domains in an adhesion- and time-dependent manner. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ is not required for this association with α1β1 integrin. Using peptide-binding assays, we identified the membrane proximal sequence of the β1 and α1 subunit-cytoplasmic domain as binding sites for PLCγ. The interaction of PLCγ with integrin-cytoplasmic domains is direct, because purified PLCγ also binds to the integrin peptides. Inhibition of PLC and PI 3K activity by specific inhibitors reduces α1β1integrin-mediated adhesion, whereas cells lacking the complete α1-cytoplasmic domain become insensitive toward the inhibitors, indicating the involvement of this domain in PLC- and PI3K-dependent adhesion regulation.Several studies have implicated PLCγ in integrin-mediated bidirectional signaling. The cross-linking of β2integrins on T cells leads to augmentation of T cell receptor-induced PLCγ stimulation and to Ca2+mobilization (28Kanner S.B. Grosmaire L.S. Ledbetter J.A. Damle N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7099-7103Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The inhibition of PLCγ blocks integrin-mediated collagen lattice contraction by dermal fibroblasts (29Langholz O. Roeckel D. Petersohn D. Broermann E. Eckes B. Krieg T. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 235: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In hematopoietic progenitor cells, PLCγ activation via CD43 increases integrin affinity to fibronectin, pointing to an involvement of PLCγ in inside-out signaling (30Anzai N. Gotoh A. Shibayama H. Broxmeyer H.E. Blood. 1999; 93: 3317-3326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, PLCγ was detected in focal adhesion complexes within 15 min of integrin ligation (31Plopper G.E. McNamee H.P. Dike L.E. Bojanowski K. Ingber D.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1349-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar).In our study, we demonstrated that the inhibition of PLC activity leads to reduced cell adhesion of PC12 cells, and α1integrin-transfected CHO cells leads to α1integrin-specific substrates, thus confirming the role of PLC in α1β1 integrin-mediated inside-out signaling. The adhesion of PC12 cells to collagen IV led to an increased association of PLCγ with α1β1integrin. This association is also time-dependent, because it peaked at ∼30 min after adhesion but was still detectable after overnight incubation. This is in agreement with very recent data that describe an adhesion-dependent association of PLCγ 2 with αvβ3 integrin in prefusion osteoclasts (32Nakamura J. Lipfert L. Rodan R.A. Duong L.T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).Phosphorylation does not appear to be necessary for PLCγ binding. NGF, which is known to induce PLCγ phosphorylation and to support PC12 cell differentiation and neurite outgrowth, efficiently induced PLCγ phosphorylation in PC12 cells without increasing significantly PLCγ/α1β1 integrin association.Characterization of the integrin binding sequences by peptide binding assays, a technique used for the identification of other integrin-binding proteins (8Schaller M.D. Otey C.A. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 33Löster K. Vossmeyer D. Hofmann W. Reutter W. Danker K. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 233-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), revealed that PLCγ bound quantitatively to the membrane proximal sequence of the β1-cytoplasmic domain. This sequence has also been shown to bind paxillin and FAK from chicken embryonic cells (8Schaller M.D. Otey C.A. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). PLCγ binding to the β1 sequence seems to be direct and very strong, because the purified enzyme still binds in the presence of 1m salt and can be potently blocked by soluble β1-1 peptide with an IC50 of ∼100 μm. This binding strength is compared with previously reported data for paxillin binding to a peptide of the α4-cytoplasmic domain (11Liu S. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22736-22742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The β1 binding sequence could also be the target sequence for PLCγ within the cytoplasmic domain of the β3 subunit described by Nakamura et al. (32Nakamura J. Lipfert L. Rodan R.A. Duong L.T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), because it is conserved among β subunits. The other COOH-terminally located sequences of the β1A-cytoplasmic domain are not involved in PLCγ binding. However, we additionally identified the Gly-Phe-Phe-Lys-Arg motif of the α1-cytoplasmic domain as a binding site for PLCγ. This sequence is highly conserved among all α subunits. It has been identified as a binding site for calreticulin, a protein involved in integrin-mediated Ca2+ regulation (13Coppolino M.G. Woodside M.J. Demaurex N. Grinstein S., St- Arnaud R. Dedhar S. Nature. 1997; 386: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Several other proteins have been shown to bind to this sequence within α-cytoplasmic domains (33Löster K. Vossmeyer D. Hofmann W. Reutter W. Danker K. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 233-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Wixler V. Laplantine E. Geerts D. Sonnenberg A. Petersohn D. Eckes B. Paulsson M. Aumailley M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The binding of proteins by this sequence seems to be functionally relevant because mutational analyses have demonstrated that its deletion leads to impaired cell spreading, actin reorganization, and cell motility (25Vossmeyer D. Kaufmann C. Loster K. Lucka L. Horstkorte R. Reutter W. Danker K. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 35Bauer J.S. Varner J. Schreiner C. Kornberg L. Nicholas R. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), thus arguing for a link between the α-cytoplasmic domain and the cytoskeleton.Furthermore, the Lys-Ile-Gly-Phe-Phe-Lys-Arg peptide blocks PLCγ binding to the β1 sequence very efficiently. Interestingly, the complete α1-cytoplasmic sequence binds PLCγ very poorly and is not able to inhibit PLCγ binding to the β1 sequence. These data suggest that the Lys-Ile-Gly-Phe-Phe-Lys-Arg sequence in the complete α1-cytoplasmic domain might not be accessible, thus being masked by intramolecular peptide interactions in vitro.For inactive integrins Hughes et al. (36Hughes P.E. Diaz-Gonzalez F. Leong L., Wu, C. McDonald J.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6571-6574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) suggested a potential salt bridge among residues of the membrane-proximal sequences of the integrin αIIbβ3-cytoplasmic domains. This could be a mechanism by which both conserved sequences are masked and not accessible for protein binding. Point mutations in these residues result in a constitutively active receptor. This finding indicates a functionally important interaction of the two binding sequences.α1β1-Specific adhesion of CHO cells expressing a full-length α1 integrin or a truncated α1 tail containing only the conserved membrane-proximal sequence is reduced by PLC and PI3K inhibitors. Protein kinase C, an important downstream effector of PLC, is able to rescue the PLC inhibitor effect on adhesion. In contrast, cells lacking the Gly-Phe-Phe-Lys-Arg sequence (CHO-α1/Lys) do not respond to the inhibitors. These data, together with the fact that the Gly-Phe-Phe-Lys-Arg sequence also binds PLCγ and is able to compete for PLCγ binding to β1-1 peptide, argue for a regulatory role of this sequence in PLCγ- and PI3K-dependent adhesion modulation.Recent studies (37Yu H. Fukami K. Itoh T. Takenawa T. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 243: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 38Pei Z.D. Williamson J.R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) have described a regulatory role for PLCγ in cytoskeleton reorganization. PLCγ regulates concentrations of second messengers like phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and Ca2+, leading to the activation of cytoskeletal proteins and Ca2+-dependent enzymes. The activation of the Ca2+-dependent protease calpain results in altered interactions between integrin-cytoplasmic domains and the cytoskeleton upon cell stimulation, leading to integrin clustering and subsequent formation of stress fibers (39Stewart M.P. McDowall A. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 40Sampath R. Gallagher P.J. Pavalko F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33588-33594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar).Cells with a complete deletion of the α1-cytoplasmic domain fail to organize actin stress fibers (25Vossmeyer D. Kaufmann C. Loster K. Lucka L. Horstkorte R. Reutter W. Danker K. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and correct focal adhesions (33Löster K. Vossmeyer D. Hofmann W. Reutter W. Danker K. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 233-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although an intact β1 tail is still present. As with cytoskeletal organization, we found that the β1 tail alone is not sufficient for integrin adhesion modulation by PLC and PI3K activity. Whereas the β1-cytoplasmic domain binds PLCγ, the Gly-Phe-Phe-Lys-Arg sequence of the α1-cytoplasmic domain is needed for transmitting PLC-induced effects on integrin affinity and avidity possibly by affecting cytoskeleton organization or by influencing integrin conformation. These defects could also be attributed to the improper FAK phosphorylation observed in CHO-α1/Lys cells (33Löster K. Vossmeyer D. Hofmann W. Reutter W. Danker K. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 233-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), because a recent study has demonstrated that phosphorylated FAK supports PLCγ activity (41Zhang X. Chattopadhyay A., Ji, Q.S. Owen J.D. Ruest P.J. Carpenter G. Hanks S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9021-9026Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar).Although we observed PLC-dependent adhesion in α1-transfected CHO cells, PLCγ could not be coprecipitated with α1β1 integrin in these cells possibly because of the artificial nature of the transfection system (data not shown).PI3K signaling has been linked to PLCγ signaling. Falasca et al. (42Falasca M. Logan S.K. Lehto V.P. Baccante G. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) demonstrated that membrane localization of PLCγ by the PI3K product phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate is essential for activation of PLCγ by growth factor receptors. PI3K activation has been reported to regulate adhesion and cell motility (43Shimizu Y. Mobley J.L. Finkelstein L.D. Chan A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1867-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 44Keely P.J. Westwick J.K. Whitehead I.P. Der C.J. Parise L.V. Nature. 1997; 390: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that PI3K and PLCγ join in a common mechanism of adhesion regulation by acidic phospholipids.We favor a model in which binding of PLCγ to the β1-cytoplasmic domain of integrin localizes PLCγ activity to focal adhesions, thereby ensuring a local regulation of second messengers, cytoskeleton organization, and integrin conformation (Fig. 10). The conserved α-cytoplasmic sequence is required for the modulation of PLC binding to the β sequence. PLCγ could in turn change the membrane lipid environment and cytoskeletal interactions, leading to altered integrin binding activity.In this study, we could show that PLCγ is required for α1β1-dependent signaling. We believe that PLC might play a more general role in integrin signaling, because it seems also be associated with the αvβ3 integrin (32Nakamura J. Lipfert L. Rodan R.A. Duong L.T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and the α5β1 integrin.. The finding that PLCγ binds to conserved cytoplasmic sequences that are present in all integrin subunits identified so far supports this idea. Cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix is a biologically important event providing structural and signaling information for biological processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (1Albelda S.M. Buck C.A. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2868-2880Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar, 2Sastry S.K. Horwitz A.F. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 455-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These adhesive interactions are basically mediated by integrins, a large family of heterodimeric transmembrane cell surface receptors (3Hynes R.O. Cell. 1987; 48: 549-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3079) Google Scholar). Besides connecting the extracellular matrix with the cytoskeleton, integrins are also capable of specifically inducing various signaling pathways upon ligand binding. These include the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, Rho A and protein kinase C, as well as the modulation of phosphoinositide levels, leading to cell cycle control and cytoskeletal reorganization (outside-in signaling) (4Howe A. Aplin A.E. Alahari S.K. Juliano R.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 220-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 5Cary L.A. Han D.C. Guan J.L. Histol. Histopathol. 1999; 14: 1001-1009PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, signals from inside the cell can modulate the integrin affinity for its ligands followed by changes in cell adhesion and migration (inside-out signaling) (6Hughes P.E. Pfaff M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 359-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Engagement of integrins results in integrin clustering and binding of signaling and cytoskeletal proteins to the integrin-cytoplasmic domains, leading to the formation of multiprotein complexes called focal adhesions. Focal adhesions anchor actin filaments and are the starting points of integrin-dependent signaling processes. The cytoplasmic domains of β integrin subunits are essential for recruiting integrins to focal adhesions and for initiating integrin signaling. A number of proteins has been identified so far, which interact with specific sequences of the cytoplasmic domain of β integrin subunits (7Liu S. Calderwood D.A. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2004888313,"Mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins were originally identified in yeast, and homologues have been identified in several other eukaryotic organisms, including mammals. These findings suggest that the mechanisms by which eukaryotic cells initiate and regulate DNA replication have been conserved throughout evolution. However, it is clear that many mammalian origins are much more complex than those of yeast. An example is the Chinese hamster dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) origin, which resides in the spacer between the DHFR and 2BE2121 genes. This origin consists of a broad zone of potential sites scattered throughout the 55-kb spacer, with several subregions (e.g. ori-β, ori-β′, and ori-γ) being preferred. We show here that antibodies to human MCMs 2–7 recognize counterparts in extracts prepared from hamster cells; furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation data demonstrate the presence of an MCM2-3-5 subcomplex as observed in other species. To determine whether MCM proteins play a role in initiation and/or elongation in Chinese hamster cells, we have examined in vivo protein-DNA interactions between the MCMs and chromatin in the DHFR locus using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) approach. In synchronizedcultures, MCM complexes associate preferentially with DNA in the intergenic initiation zone early in S-phase during the time that replication initiates. However, significant amounts of MCMs were also detected over the two genes, in agreement with recent observations that the MCM complex co-purifies with RNA polymerase II. As cells progress through S-phase, the MCMs redistribute throughout the DHFRdomain, suggesting a dynamic interaction with DNA. Inasynchronous cultures, in which replication forks should be found at any position in the genome, MCM proteins were distributed relatively evenly throughout the DHFR locus. Altogether, these data are consistent with studies in yeast showing that MCM subunits localize to origins during initiation and then migrate outward with the replication forks. This constitutes the first evidence that mammalian MCM complexes perform a critical role during the initiation and elongation phases of replication at the DHFR origin in hamster cells. Mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins were originally identified in yeast, and homologues have been identified in several other eukaryotic organisms, including mammals. These findings suggest that the mechanisms by which eukaryotic cells initiate and regulate DNA replication have been conserved throughout evolution. However, it is clear that many mammalian origins are much more complex than those of yeast. An example is the Chinese hamster dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) origin, which resides in the spacer between the DHFR and 2BE2121 genes. This origin consists of a broad zone of potential sites scattered throughout the 55-kb spacer, with several subregions (e.g. ori-β, ori-β′, and ori-γ) being preferred. We show here that antibodies to human MCMs 2–7 recognize counterparts in extracts prepared from hamster cells; furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation data demonstrate the presence of an MCM2-3-5 subcomplex as observed in other species. To determine whether MCM proteins play a role in initiation and/or elongation in Chinese hamster cells, we have examined in vivo protein-DNA interactions between the MCMs and chromatin in the DHFR locus using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) approach. In synchronizedcultures, MCM complexes associate preferentially with DNA in the intergenic initiation zone early in S-phase during the time that replication initiates. However, significant amounts of MCMs were also detected over the two genes, in agreement with recent observations that the MCM complex co-purifies with RNA polymerase II. As cells progress through S-phase, the MCMs redistribute throughout the DHFRdomain, suggesting a dynamic interaction with DNA. Inasynchronous cultures, in which replication forks should be found at any position in the genome, MCM proteins were distributed relatively evenly throughout the DHFR locus. Altogether, these data are consistent with studies in yeast showing that MCM subunits localize to origins during initiation and then migrate outward with the replication forks. This constitutes the first evidence that mammalian MCM complexes perform a critical role during the initiation and elongation phases of replication at the DHFR origin in hamster cells. dihydrofolate reductase origin recognition complex mini-chromosome maintenance chromatin immunoprecipitation phosphate-buffered saline Chinese hamster ovary Although much is known about the mechanism of initiation at the origins of mammalian viruses, little is known about these processes at mammalian chromosomal origins of replication. In viral, yeast, and bacterial replicons, initiation is confined to genetically definedreplicator sequences, which direct the loading of initiation factors followed by localized melting of adjacent DNA sequences (reviewed in Ref. 1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication.2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1992Google Scholar). This interaction allows access to the origin by primases, polymerases, and other factors involved in the elongation steps of replication. In these relatively simple systems, the termorigin is often used to refer to both the replicator (initiation protein binding site) and the local site(s) where nascent strand synthesis begins.Considerable evidence suggests that initiation at mammalian origins is much more complex. A case in point is the origin in the Chinese hamsterDHFR1 domain, which lies in the spacer region between the DHFR and2BE2121 genes (Fig. 1) (2Heintz N.H. Hamlin J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It was expected that start sites would lie close to replicator sequences that bind to proteins required for initiation. However, these mapping studies have shown that replication can initiate at any one of a very large number of potential sites distributed throughout the 55-kb spacer (4Vaughn J.P. Dijkwel P.A.

Biol. 1992; 12: 3715-3722Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), with at least three subregions (termed ori-β, ori-β′, and ori-γ) being preferred (3Leu T.-H. Hamlin J.L. Mol. Cell.

Thus, the ori-β, ori-β′, and ori-γ regions (and possibly others) could correspond to classic genetic replicators. Alternatively, the intergenic region may contain a much larger number of degenerate replicators, with initiation depending more critically on the local environment (e.g. chromatin architecture, transcriptional activity, proximity to matrix attachment regions, etc.).In the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, chromosomal replicators were identified as autonomously replicating sequence elements, and are recognized by a six-membered protein complex called ORC (for origin recognition complex; reviewed in Refs. 11Dutta A.

Loss-of-function mutations in any of the ORC, MCM, or cdc6 genes in yeast impairs replication and plasmid stability, and reduces the level of initiation occurring at individual origins, suggesting important roles for each of these factors in the initiation reaction (reviewed in Ref. 11Dutta A. Bell S.P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Counterparts of all six ORC subunits have been identified in fruit flies (22Gossen M. Pak D.T.S. Hansen S.K. Acharya J.K. Botchan M.R.

For example, microinjecting mammalian cells with antibodies to Cdc6, MCM2, or MCM3 blocks DNA replication (34Todorov I.T. Pepperkok R. Philipova R.N. Kearsey S.E. Ansorge W. Werner D. J.

Altogether, these data suggest that at least some of the mechanisms involved in identifying and preparing mammalian origins for initiation are likely to be conserved among eukaryotes.Therefore, it is likely that mammalian cells rely, at least in part, on the formation and proper regulation of pre-RC complexes at or near chromosomal origins of replication, and that yeast homologues of ORC, Cdc6, and MCM proteins perform one or more roles in this process. However, it has not yet been shown that any of these proteins functions in mammalian cells in a manner consistent with their suggested roles in initiation. While there is still no functional assay for ORC and Cdc6 in yeast or any other system, some progress has been made in understanding MCM function during initiation and elongation. For example, recent biochemical evidence suggests that the MCM complex may possess helicase activity (38You Z. Komamura Y. Ishimi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8003-8015Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 39Chong J.P. Hayashi M.K. Simon M.N. Xu R.M. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 18871-18878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In addition, in vivocross-linking studies in yeast have shown that the MCM complex binds to origins of replication at the beginning of S-phase, but then migrates with the replication fork after initiation (14Aparicio O.M. Weinstein D.M. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 91: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 40Labib K. Tercero J.A. Diffley J.F. Science. 2000; 288: 1643-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), consistent with a functional role as a helicase.In this study, we have asked whether MCM subunits are localized preferentially to the DHFR origin region in vivoand whether it is possible to detect any alterations in MCM-chromosome interactions and dynamics that may suggest a functional role for MCMs in replication initiation. We have treated CHO cells with formaldehyde to fix initiation proteins on, or adjacent to, regions of the chromosome where the proteins were situated in vivo. Using this chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) approach, we find that mammalian MCM subunits are preferentially associated with theDHFR origin during the G1/S transition, but become distributed throughout the origin and flanking genes as cells proceed out of S-phase and lose synchrony. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that MCMs localize to this origin during initiation at the beginning of S-phase, and then proceed away from origins with the replication forks.DISCUSSIONUsing antibodies to the human proteins, we have been able to show in Western blots that all six MCM subunits are present in Chinese hamster cells. With regard to interactions among the MCMs in hamster cells, we observed a subcomplex consisting of MCM2, -3, and -5. Similar interactions have been demonstrated in humans and Xenopus(reviewed in Ref. 11Dutta A. Bell S.P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 293-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 32Prokhorova T.A. Blow J.J. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1996; 235: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, we were not able to detect co-precipitation of MCM4, -6, and -7 with antibodies to any of the three subunits even though the three have been demonstrated to form a three-membered complex in Xenopus and humans (11Dutta A. Bell S.P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 293-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 33Schulte D. Richter A. Burkhart R. Musahl C. Knippers R. Eur. J.

Additionally, all six MCMs have been shown to exist as a single large complex in Xenopus and humans (32Prokhorova T.A. Blow J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2491-2498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 33Schulte D. Richter A. Burkhart R. Musahl C. Knippers R. Eur. J.

Since we were not able to demonstrate the latter two complexes here, it is likely that our method of extract preparation differs in subtle ways from those employed in other studies, or that our antisera may disrupt the holocomplex or subcomplexes of MCM proteins.In the ChIP experiments themselves, we observed preferential binding of MCM5 and, to a lesser extent, MCM2, to the intergenic DHFRorigin when cells were arrested at the G1/S boundary (Fig.6). As cells progressed through the S-period, the levels of MCMs in the two flanking genes appeared to increase, but the relative amount of binding to the intergenic region did not diminish substantially. By analogy to yeast (14Aparicio O.M. Weinstein D.M. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 91: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar), if the DHFR origin were 100% efficient (i.e. fired in every cell cycle), it would be expected to be cleared of MCMs as they progress away from the origin with the replication forks once initiation in the region ceases (∼2 h after entry into the S-phase; Ref. 8Dijkwel P.A. Hamlin J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3715-3722Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, this origin fires in only 15–20% of the amplicons in any one S-period, with the consequence that 80–85% of the origins are replicated passively at later times in S-phase by forks from distant active origins (8Dijkwel P.A. Hamlin J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3715-3722Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 60Dijkwel P.A. Vaughn J.P. Hamlin J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4989-4996Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, the MCMs should be concentrated over the intergenic region in early S-phase when 15% of them are active, but should become more uniformly distributed when the cells near the end of S-phase, or in an unsynchronized cell population containing cells at all stages of the cycle. These predictions were, by in large, borne out by the ChIP data on synchronized cells presented in Fig. 6. In chromatin isolated from unsynchronized cultures, MCM5 appears to be relatively uniformly distributed throughout the DHFR region, with no apparent preference for the origin region or the genes. That the ChIP assay is giving a reasonably adequate representation of thein vivo situation is bolstered by preferential binding of the splicing factor PSF-1 to the DHFR and 2BE2121genes in unsynchronized cells (Fig. 5C). However, there was also considerable binding of PSF-1 to cosmids S21 and SE24, which are completely contained within the intergenic region. Possibly, this results from the fact that, like many other genes (61Aranda A. Proudfoot N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1251-1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 62Cuello P. Boyd D.C. Dye M.J.

Hamlin, unpublished observations.Other studies in higher eukaryotic organisms have suggested that, while localized to the nucleus throughout most of the cell cycle, MCM proteins are tightly associated with chromatin only in G1and early S-phase, and gradually dissociate from chromatin as cells progress into late S-phase and G2 (11Dutta A.

However, the data presented here suggest that MCM proteins are intimately associated with chromatin throughout the cycle. To reconcile our results with those from previous studies, it is important to understand how both sets of data were obtained. In previous studies, chromatin was prepared by isolating nuclear pellets from cytoplasmic and soluble fractions in the presence of Triton X-100 or similar detergent (11Dutta A. Bell S.P. Annu. Rev.

These detergents are known to disrupt the nuclear envelope and, in addition, lead to solubilization and extraction of nuclear proteins. The solubilized proteins fractionate with the cytoplasmic supernatant, while the insoluble, detergent-resistant protein fractions fractionate with the nuclear pellet, otherwise referred to as the “chromatin pellet” (67Todorov I.T.

However, the formaldehyde cross-linking approach covalently fixes chromatin-associated proteins in situ, thereby preventing any potential detergent-soluble proteins from being released from theirin vivo binding sites during cell extract preparation. In light of this difference, our data suggest that at least some MCM proteins are associated with chromatin (and the DHFR region) even during late S-phase and G2, but in a somewhat different biochemical state than in G1 and early S-phase (detergent-sensitive versus -resistant, respectively).We had originally anticipated that there would be little or no MCM interactions with genomic DNA over the two genes (DHFR and2BE2121) adjacent to the intergenic origin region. Thus, the genes were expected to serve as negative controls in samples isolated at the G1/S boundary. The significant amounts of MCM2 and MCM5 detected in the genes therefore could represent nonspecific background cross-linking. In fact, the 2-fold differences that we detect between the genes and the intergenic region at the G1/S boundary are similar to results obtained in virtually all published ChIP assays utilizing PCR approaches in yeast (14Aparicio O.M.

After puberty, seminal vesicle secretion (SVS)1 accumulates in the lumen of this reproductive gland. Upon ejaculation, SVS is discharged and makes up the major portion of the seminal plasma that is the complex biological fluid formed from the mixing of various fluids in the male reproductive tract. Because rodents have proven to be good experimental animals for the molecular study of mammalian reproduction, attempts have been made to study the structure and function of mouse SVS proteins. They consist of several minor components such as SVA (1Huang Y.H. Chu S.T. Chen Y.H. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 63: 1562-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), p12 (2Chen L.Y. Lin Y.H. Lai M.L.

Pentecost B.T. McLachlan J.A. Teng C.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The structure and function of SVS II (4Lundwall A. Peter A. Lovgren J. Lilja H.

Chem. 2001; 276: 6913-6921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) have been reported.Semen is coagulated in a substantial number of mammalian species, such as many myomorphic rodents, certain moles, hedgehogs, marsupials, rabbits, stallions, boars, and several primates (6Williams-Ashman H.G. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1984; 58: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The deposition of semen coagulum of such animals, including rodent, into the vagina at coitus results in the formation of a copulatory plug that occludes the vaginal barrel close to the uterine cervix. Thus extirpation of the seminal vesicle and coagulating gland (anterior prostate) from a mouse prevents formation of a vaginal plug and greatly reduces fertility (7Peitz B. Olds-Clarke P. Biol. Reprod. 1986; 35: 608-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Therefore, the importance of male accessory sexual glands in the physiological utilization of semen coagulum in mammalian reproduction, although still not well defined, should not be overlooked. In this regard, it has been demonstrated that human plasma factor XIII, a secretory transglutaminase (8Folk J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 517-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar, 9Lorand L. Conrad S.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1984; 58: 9-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), is able to catalyze the cross-links of both semenogelin I/II (10Peter A. Lilja H. Lundwall A. Malm J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 216-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and mouse SVS I/II (4Lundwall A. Peter A. Lovgren J. Lilja H. Malm J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Because these transglutaminase protein substrates are exclusively expressed in seminal vesicle and have their transcription units in a similar arrangement, they are referred to as rapidly evolving substrate of transglutaminase (REST) (11Lundwall A. Lazure C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 12Lundwall A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Transglutaminase is secreted from some male accessory sexual glands. For instance, the RNA message of a secretory transglutaminase has been identified in the human prostate (13Dubbink H.J. Verkaik N.S. Faber P.W. Trapman J. Schröder F.H. Romijn J.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 901-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and a transglutaminase has been purified from rat coagulating gland fluid (14Esposito C. Pucci P. Amoresano A. Marino G. Cozzolino A. Porta R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27416-27423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Apparently, the transglutaminase-catalyzed protein cross-linking, subsequent to the discharge of luminal fluid of male accessory sexual glands, may result in the formation of the semisolid gelatinous mass in human semen or seminal plasma clotting in rodent semen. In this work, we present data to support mouse SVS III as a novel REST that participates in the formation of the copulatory plug. Our results conclude that the five tandem repeats of a tetrapeptide QXK(S/T) in the central part of this protein molecule act as the transglutaminase cross-linking sites.DISCUSSIONREST genes have their transcription unit split into three exons, and most of the coding nucleotides are present in their second exons. The nucleotide sequences are highly conserved in their first exons, first introns, second introns, and third exons, but their second exons may undergo rapid evolution, which give rise to proteins that are not similar in their primary structure (11Lundwall A. Lazure C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A pairwise comparison betweenMpSv-1 and the human semenogelin I gene (26Ulvsback M. Lazure C. Lilja H. Spurr N.K. Rao V.V. Loffler C. Hansmann I. Lundwall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18080-18084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) orMpSv-1 and the mouse SVS II gene (12Lundwall A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) showed nucleotide sequence conservation in their first exons, first introns, second introns, and third exons and a significant difference in the nucleotide sequences of their second exons (Fig. 8). Such a characteristic arrangement of the transcript unit of theMpSv-1 gene together with the demonstration of its translated protein as a transglutaminase substrate suggests it as a new member of the REST gene family.The protein sequence deduced from MpSv-1 cDNA (Fig. 1) is not identically aligned with the primary structures reported for mouse SVS proteins such as SVA (27Yu L.C. Chen J.L. Tsai W.B. Chen Y.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), SVS II (4Lundwall A. Peter A. Lovgren J. Lilja H. Malm J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), SVS IV (3Chen Y.H. Pentecost B.T. McLachlan J.A. Teng C.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), SVS VII (5Luo C.W. Lin H.J. Chen Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6913-6921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and P12 (28Lai M.L. Chen S.W. Chen Y.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 290: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our results support SVS III, which differs from SVS I and SVS II, as a novel 34-kDa glycoprotein derived fromMpSv-1. Lundwall et al. (4Lundwall A. Peter A. Lovgren J. Lilja H. Malm J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) have demonstrated transglutaminase-catalyzed protein cross-linking of mouse SVS I and II. In this work, we have demonstrated that, in addition to these two SVS proteins, SVS III is also cross-linked by transglutaminase from different origins. This agrees with the strong immunoreactivity of SVS III detected in a cross-section of a copulatory plug (Fig. 5), which manifests an important role for SVS III as a new semenoclotin involved in the protein cross-linking in the copulatory plug.The transcription of MpSv-1 is exclusive to the seminal vesicle and SVS III is predominantly secreted from the luminal epithelium of mucosa folds in this accessory sexual gland into the lumen (Fig. 3). The castration of male adults results in the disappearance of the RNA message in seminal vesicle, and the gene expression is restored in the accessory sexual gland after administration of testosterone to the castrated males. This is consistent with the lack of MpSv-1 mRNA in the seminal vesicle before puberty, when serum androgen is at a low level, and represents a positive correlation of androgen-stimulatedMpSv-1 expression with the animal maturation. Since castration causes considerable involution of the seminal vesicle, the increase in MpSv-1 mRNA after testosterone administration to castrates may result from either androgen-induced cell proliferation or from androgen-dependent gene expression. Whether the ARE-like sequences in MpSv-1 are functional awaits future study.Until now, the protein substrate of transglutaminase in mouse SVS, namely SVS I–III, have not been purified. This hinders the characterization of transglutaminase-activated sites in the protein molecules by direct protein analysis. In this work, we tackled the problem by an alternative approach. As is well known, transglutaminase catalyzes the protein cross-links through an acyl transfer reaction in which the γ-carboxamide group of a glutamine residue on one protein molecule serves as the primary substrate of an acyl donor, and the ε-amino group of a lysine residue on the other protein molecule acts as an acceptor substrate. Previous studies indicate that a hydrophobic residue, adjacent to and on either the carboxyl side of the glutamine residue or the amino side of the lysine residue in a polypeptide, enhances significantly their substrate activity (29Gorman J.J. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 419-427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Schrode J. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 653-661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The opposite effect prevails when a hydrophobic residue is on the amino side of the glutamine residue or the carboxyl side of the lysine residue. Mouse SVS III has a high content of glutamines and lysines, which together amount to 20% of all amino acid residues of the protein. There are 29 glutamines and 24 lysines in one SVS III molecule. The 7 glutamines and 5 lysines in the central part, residues 116–147, of this protein are in a cluster of five tandem repeats of the short peptide QXK(S/T) that is characteristic of a transglutaminase substrate acyl donor as well as an acyl acceptor. No such peptide sequence is present in either the NH2-terminal region (residues 1–115) that has 9 glutamine residues and 10 lysine residues or the COOH-terminal region (residues 146–265) that contains 13 glutamine residues and 9 lysine residues. Using the recombinant polypeptide of GST fused to different parts of the SVS III molecule, we have demonstrated that neither the NH2-terminal nor the COOH-terminal region but the central region of SVS III is the transglutaminase cross-linking site (Fig. 7). The lack of a predicted turn structure in the central region (Fig. 1) makes the five tandem repeats unlikely to juxtapose in an antiparallel arrangement. Rather the secondary structure of this region may be extended to expose the transglutaminase substrate residues for the glutamine-lysine cross-linking.The characteristic arrangement of the transcription unit in the REST gene has also been found in the rat SVS II gene (31Harris S.E. Harris M.A. Johnson C.M. Bean M.F. Dodd J.G. Matusik R.J. Carr S.A. Crabb J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9896-9903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and guinea pig SVP genes (32Hagstrom J.E. Fautsch M.P. Perdok M. Vrabel A. Wieben E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21114-21119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), but no demonstration about the cross-linking of these proteins by transglutaminase has yet been reported, despite suggestions that they are transglutaminase substrates. Like mouse SVS III, a high content of glutamine and lysine residues makes up 22, 27, 30, and 20% of total amino acid residues in human semenogelin I, mouse SVS II, rat SVS II, and guinea pig SVP-1, respectively. The peptide sequence QXK(S/T) is tandem-repeated in mouse SVS II and rat SVS II but is absent in human semenogelin and guinea pig SVP. Possibly, the REST genes may evolve to species-specific transglutaminase-activated sites. Mouse SVS II contains 375 amino acid residues with 20 segments of QXK(S/T) in one region, which comprises tandem repeats of the sequence QVKSSGS that extends from residue 82 to approximately residue 250 (4Lundwall A. Peter A. Lovgren J. Lilja H. Malm J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Such a dense QXK(S/T) in the central parts of mouse SVS II and SVS III is characteristic in the nucleotide sequence similarity shown in a rectangular box on the dot plot of these two genes (Fig. 8). The same situation occurs in the rat SVS II, which is made up of 414 amino acid residues in which over 50% of the protein exhibits a 13-residue repeat with the consensus sequence QSQLKSFGQVKSS that spans residues 86–298 of the protein molecule. Mouse SVS II and rat SVS II were proposed to have their internal repetitive structure in an antiparallel arrangement by spatial juxtaposition of the transglutaminase substrate residues for glutamine-lysine cross-linking (31Harris S.E. Harris M.A. Johnson C.M. Bean M.F. Dodd J.G. Matusik R.J. Carr S.A. Crabb J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9896-9903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It raises a question of whether the conformation formed by such an internal structure is necessary for a transglutaminase substrate. This necessity may be ruled out in light of our demonstration that one segment of QXK(S/T) as a basic unit is sufficient for the transglutaminase-catalyzed cross-linking. The internal antiparallel structure in mouse SVS II and rat SVS II is unlikely in the central part of the SVS III molecule, suggesting that SVS II and SVS III may have different roles in copulatory plug formation. Seminal vesicles are present in most male mammals. After puberty, seminal vesicle secretion (SVS)1 accumulates in the lumen of this reproductive gland.

This agrees with the strong immunoreactivity of SVS III detected in a cross-section of a copulatory plug (Fig. 5), which manifests an important role for SVS III as a new semenoclotin involved in the protein cross-linking in the copulatory plug.The transcription of MpSv-1 is exclusive to the seminal vesicle and SVS III is predominantly secreted from the luminal epithelium of mucosa folds in this accessory sexual gland into the lumen (Fig. 3). The castration of male adults results in the disappearance of the RNA message in seminal vesicle, and the gene expression is restored in the accessory sexual gland after administration of testosterone to the castrated males. This is consistent with the lack of MpSv-1 mRNA in the seminal vesicle before puberty, when serum androgen is at a low level, and represents a positive correlation of androgen-stimulatedMpSv-1 expression with the animal maturation. Since castration causes considerable involution of the seminal vesicle, the increase in MpSv-1 mRNA after testosterone administration to castrates may result from either androgen-induced cell proliferation or from androgen-dependent gene expression. Whether the ARE-like sequences in MpSv-1 are functional awaits future study.Until now, the protein substrate of transglutaminase in mouse SVS, namely SVS I–III, have not been purified. This hinders the characterization of transglutaminase-activated sites in the protein molecules by direct protein analysis. In this work, we tackled the problem by an alternative approach. As is well known, transglutaminase catalyzes the protein cross-links through an acyl transfer reaction in which the γ-carboxamide group of a glutamine residue on one protein molecule serves as the primary substrate of an acyl donor, and the ε-amino group of a lysine residue on the other protein molecule acts as an acceptor substrate. Previous studies indicate that a hydrophobic residue, adjacent to and on either the carboxyl side of the glutamine residue or the amino side of the lysine residue in a polypeptide, enhances significantly their substrate activity (29Gorman J.J. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 419-427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Schrode J. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 653-661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The opposite effect prevails when a hydrophobic residue is on the amino side of the glutamine residue or the carboxyl side of the lysine residue. Mouse SVS III has a high content of glutamines and lysines, which together amount to 20% of all amino acid residues of the protein. There are 29 glutamines and 24 lysines in one SVS III molecule. The 7 glutamines and 5 lysines in the central part, residues 116–147, of this protein are in a cluster of five tandem repeats of the short peptide QXK(S/T) that is characteristic of a transglutaminase substrate acyl donor as well as an acyl acceptor. No such peptide sequence is present in either the NH2-terminal region (residues 1–115) that has 9 glutamine residues and 10 lysine residues or the COOH-terminal region (residues 146–265) that contains 13 glutamine residues and 9 lysine residues. Using the recombinant polypeptide of GST fused to different parts of the SVS III molecule, we have demonstrated that neither the NH2-terminal nor the COOH-terminal region but the central region of SVS III is the transglutaminase cross-linking site (Fig. 7). The lack of a predicted turn structure in the central region (Fig. 1) makes the five tandem repeats unlikely to juxtapose in an antiparallel arrangement. Rather the secondary structure of this region may be extended to expose the transglutaminase substrate residues for the glutamine-lysine cross-linking.The characteristic arrangement of the transcription unit in the REST gene has also been found in the rat SVS II gene (31Harris S.E. Harris M.A. Johnson C.M. Bean M.F. Dodd J.G. Matusik R.J. Carr S.A. Crabb J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9896-9903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and guinea pig SVP genes (32Hagstrom J.E. Fautsch M.P. Perdok M. Vrabel A. Wieben E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21114-21119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), but no demonstration about the cross-linking of these proteins by transglutaminase has yet been reported, despite suggestions that they are transglutaminase substrates. Like mouse SVS III, a high content of glutamine and lysine residues makes up 22, 27, 30, and 20% of total amino acid residues in human semenogelin I, mouse SVS II, rat SVS II, and guinea pig SVP-1, respectively. The peptide sequence QXK(S/T) is tandem-repeated in mouse SVS II and rat SVS II but is absent in human semenogelin and guinea pig SVP. Possibly, the REST genes may evolve to species-specific transglutaminase-activated sites. Mouse SVS II contains 375 amino acid residues with 20 segments of QXK(S/T) in one region, which comprises tandem repeats of the sequence QVKSSGS that extends from residue 82 to approximately residue 250 (4Lundwall A. Peter A. Lovgren J. Lilja H. Malm J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Such a dense QXK(S/T) in the central parts of mouse SVS II and SVS III is characteristic in the nucleotide sequence similarity shown in a rectangular box on the dot plot of these two genes (Fig. 8). The same situation occurs in the rat SVS II, which is made up of 414 amino acid residues in which over 50% of the protein exhibits a 13-residue repeat with the consensus sequence QSQLKSFGQVKSS that spans residues 86–298 of the protein molecule. Mouse SVS II and rat SVS II were proposed to have their internal repetitive structure in an antiparallel arrangement by spatial juxtaposition of the transglutaminase substrate residues for glutamine-lysine cross-linking (31Harris S.E. Harris M.A. Johnson C.M. Bean M.F. Dodd J.G. Matusik R.J. Carr S.A. Crabb J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9896-9903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It raises a question of whether the conformation formed by such an internal structure is necessary for a transglutaminase substrate. This necessity may be ruled out in light of our demonstration that one segment of QXK(S/T) as a basic unit is sufficient for the transglutaminase-catalyzed cross-linking. The internal antiparallel structure in mouse SVS II and rat SVS II is unlikely in the central part of the SVS III molecule, suggesting that SVS II and SVS III may have different roles in copulatory plug formation. REST genes have their transcription unit split into three exons, and most of the coding nucleotides are present in their second exons. The nucleotide sequences are highly conserved in their first exons, first introns, second introns, and third exons, but their second exons may undergo rapid evolution, which give rise to proteins that are not similar in their primary structure (11Lundwall A. Lazure C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A pairwise comparison betweenMpSv-1 and the human semenogelin I gene (26Ulvsback M. Lazure C. Lilja H. Spurr N.K. Rao V.V. Loffler C. Hansmann I. Lundwall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18080-18084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) orMpSv-1 and the mouse SVS II gene (12Lundwall A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) showed nucleotide sequence conservation in their first exons, first introns, second introns, and third exons and a significant difference in the nucleotide sequences of their second exons (Fig. 8). Such a characteristic arrangement of the transcript unit of theMpSv-1 gene together with the demonstration of its translated protein as a transglutaminase substrate suggests it as a new member of the REST gene family. The protein sequence deduced from MpSv-1 cDNA (Fig. 1) is not identically aligned with the primary structures reported for mouse SVS proteins such as SVA (27Yu L.C. Chen J.L. Tsai W.B. Chen Y.H.

However, one or more biological mechanisms underlying the secretion of ET-1 by keratinocytes in human skin have never been evaluated. In mammalian endothelial cells, a membrane-bound neutral metalloproteinase, termed endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE), catalyzes the specific cleavage of the inactive precursor Big ET to produce mature active ET, which leads in turn to the secretion of ET by those cells. To clarify the potential involvement of ECE in the processing and secretion of ET-1 by human keratinocytes, we synthesized the N-terminal peptide of human ECE-1α and generated a rabbit polyclonal antibody (αPEPT6) that specifically recognizes ECE-1α. Reverse transcription PCR and Western blotting analysis revealed that significant expression of ECE-1 transcripts and ECE-1α protein occurs in human keratinocytes. When ECE activity was assayed in extracts of human keratinocytes at pHs ranging from 5.0 to 8.0, the enzymatic profile had an optimal neutral pH of 7.0 and was sharply pH-dependent. Furthermore, when extracts of human keratinocytes were treated with αPEPT6, ECE activity was significantly reduced compared with extracts treated with the prebleed serum of αPEPT6, which supports the notion that ECE-1α is a major metalloproteinase with ECE activity in human keratinocytes. The exogenous addition of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1α significantly increased expression of ECE-1 transcripts in cultured human keratinocytes, which suggests an association with post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Collectively, our results demonstrate for the first time that ECE-1α is expressed at significant levels in various types of human skin cells (including keratinocytes) and that it plays a constitutive role in the processing and UVB-inducible secretion of ET-1 by human keratinocytes, which leads to the stimulation of pigmentation in the epidermis.

After removal of their signal peptides during their early biosynthesis processing, the propeptides are cleaved at pairs of basic amino acids to yield the intermediate Big ETs. This early processing step is presumably involved with furin, a prohormone convertase of the constitutive secretory pathway (23Laporte S. Denault J-B. D’Orléans-Juste P. Leduc R. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1993; 22: S7-S10Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Big ETs are then further cleaved by an endopeptidase termed endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE) at Trp21-(Val22/Ile22) to produce biologically active ETs, which are mature 21-residue peptides (24Yanagisawa M. Kurihara H. Kimura S. Tomobe Y. Kobayashi M. Mitsui Y. Yazaki Y. Goto K. Masaki T. Nature. 1988; 332: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10222) Google Scholar). All evidence to date regarding the processing and secretion of ETs has been restricted to endothelial cells. Until now, no reports have described the biological features of ECE in human keratinocytes, even though ET-1 is known to play an important role in the stimulation of pigmentation in the epidermis, which consists mainly of keratinocytes. It is therefore of considerable interest to identify and characterize ECE expressed by human keratinocytes; such a study would provide a new insight into the regulatory mechanisms involved in the secretion of ETs and their functional role in the epidermis. We now report for the first time the constitutive expression of ECE-1 at the gene and protein levels and that the ECE-1α isoform is dominant within human keratinocytes. This epidermal ECE-1α is characterized by high sensitivity to a metalloproteinase inhibitor, phosphoramidon, has an optimal enzymatic activity at neutral pH, and can be induced at the transcriptional and translational levels by IL-1α. Thus, it is likely that ECE-1α plays a constitutive role in the processing and secretion of ETs by human keratinocytes and that it is involved in the stimulation of pigmentation in the epidermis. Normal human endothelial cells, fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and E300 culture medium were obtained from Kyokutou (Tokyo, Japan). ET derivatives and endothelin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits were purchased from Immuno-Biological Laboratories (Gunma, Japan). Serum-free keratinocyte medium (SFM), bovine pituitary extract (BPE), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were purchased from Invitrogen (Rockville, MD). Normal human melanocytes and serum-free melanocyte growth medium was purchased from Sankou Pure Chemicals (Tokyo, Japan). Other chemicals were of reagent grade. All cells used in this study were derived from male newborns, and third-passage normal human cells were used for all experiments. Cells were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells, fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and melanocytes were maintained in E300 medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (containing 10% fetal bovine serum), SFM (supplemented with 5 ng/ml EGF and 50 μg/ml BPE), and melanocyte growth medium (supplemented with 1 ng/ml recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor, 5 μg/ml insulin, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 10 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.2% (v/v) BPE), respectively. In experiments using cultured keratinocytes, the medium was exchanged for a fresh one without supplements (EGF and BPE), and cells were cultured for 24 h, then followed by each assay. In experiments using cultured melanocytes, the medium was exchanged for a fresh one without phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and cells were cultured for 24 h, then followed by each assay. Peptides named PEPT6 (NH2-MSTYKRATLDEEDLC) and PEPT7 (PPGSPMNPPHKCEVW-COOH), which correspond to the N and C termini of ECE-1α encoded by the human ECE-1 gene, respectively (25Shimada K. Takahashi M. Ikeda M. Tanzawa K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), were synthesized and coupled to bovine serum albumin SuperCarrier (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL). Immunization and serum collection from rabbits, and the titration and specificity of antibody production as determined by ELISA, were as described elsewhere (26Jiménez M. Tsukamoto K. Hearing V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Tsukamoto K. Jackson I.J. Urabe K. Montague P.M. Hearing V.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). For the ET ELISA assay, cells were seeded in six-well plates (Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ) at a density of 5 × 104 to 105cells/ml and were cultured for 24–96 h. The medium in each well was then aspirated and exchanged for fresh medium as described above, and the cells were cultured for another 24 h. The conditioned media were then collected and quantified at 100 μl/well for levels of ET-1 and Big ET-1 by ELISA. The ET ELISA kit is a solid phase enzyme immunoassay that uses the multiple antibody sandwich principle. A human purified polyclonal antibody specific for human ET-1 or Big ET-1 was attached to wells in the 96-well microtiter plates. ET-1 and Big ET-1, present in known standards and in the conditioned media, were captured by the solid phase antibody. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled rabbit anti-human ET-1 or Big ET-1 IgG was added, which bound to multiple epitopes on ET-1 or Big ET-1 attached to the solid phase. Levels of immunoreactive ET-1 and Big ET-1 were then measured by absorbance at 450 nm using an ELISA plate reader (Bio-Rad, model 3550). The amount of ET-1 and Big ET-1 in the conditioned media was determined by comparing their absorbance to that produced by standards. The standard curve was linear from 78.1 to 5000 pg/ml. ECE-1α expression in human endothelial cells, fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and melanocytes was also investigated using Western blotting analysis. Proteins from Nonidet P-40/SDS-solubilized cells were separated on 7.5% SDS gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and then incubated with a purified polyclonal rabbit antibody specific for ECE-1α at a 1/1000 dilution. Subsequent visualization of antibody binding was carried out with Enhanced Chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Arlington Heights, IL) according to the manufacturer's instructions. These assays were performed according to Xu et al. (28Xu D. Emoto N. Giaid A. Slaughter C. Kaw S. deWit D. Yanagisawa M. Cell. 1994; 78: 473-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixture for ECE contained 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1 μm human big ET-1 (1–38), and the enzyme fraction in a total of 100 μl. Proteins from cells solubilized in 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) and 0.1% Triton X-100 were used as the enzyme fraction. All reactions were preincubated at 37 °C for 15 min prior to the addition of Big ET-1. Five micrograms of the endothelial cell and fibroblast extract, 10 μg of the keratinocyte extract, or 25 μg from the melanocyte extract were assayed at 37 °C for 2–6 h. Reactions were terminated by adding 100 μl of 5 mm EDTA. The mixture was then directly assayed for mature ET-1 (1–21) using the ELISA assay. For the pH profiling studies, the buffer solution (0.1 m) was substituted as designated. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) without CaCl2 and MgCl2 and were solubilized at 4 °C in 25 mmsodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) containing 1% Triton X-100. The resulting 200 μl (2 μg/μl) of each extract was then incubated with 4 μl of αPEPT6, the prebleed of PEPT6 or αPEPT7, or the prebleed of PEPT7 for 1 h at 4 °C, and then complexed with 50 μl of Protein G-Sepharose for 30 min at 4 °C. After a brief centrifugation, each supernatant was incubated with antibodies and complexed with Protein G-Sepharose an additional two times. The resulting supernatants were used for Western blotting analysis and measurement of ECE activity, as detailed above. Total RNAs from human endothelial cells, fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and melanocytes were isolated using a single step guanidine thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method with TRIzol (Invitrogen). cDNAs were synthesized from 1 μg total RNA by reverse transcription using oligo-dT and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The following sets of oligonucleotide primers were used: prepro-ET-1 (preproendothelin-1, a precursor of Big ET-1): 5′-TTC CCA CAA AGG CAA CAG ACC G-3′, which corresponds to nucleotides 545–566 of prepro-ET-1 cDNA (29Itou Y. Yanagisawa M. Ohkubo S. Kimura C. Kosaka T. Inoue A. Ishida N. Mitsui Y. Onda H. Fujino M. Masaki T. FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 440-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), and 5′-GAC AGG CCC CGA AGT CTG TCA-3′, which is complementary to nucleotides 889–909 of prepro-ET-1 cDNA; ECE-1: 5′-AGC GTG AGC GAG GCA GAG AG-3′, which corresponds to nucleotides 508–527 of ECE-1 cDNA (30Schmidt M. Kroger B. Jacob E. Seulberger H. Subkowski T. Otter R. Meyer T. Schmalzing G. Hillen H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 238-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and 5′-GGG GTA GAA GAT GGT GTT GA-3′, which is complementary to nucleotides 1055–1074 of ECE-1 cDNA. G3PDH (CLONTECH): 5′-ACC ACA GTC CAT GCC ATC AC-3′, which corresponds to nucleotides 586–605 of G3PDH cDNA (31Arcari P. Martinelli R. Salvatore F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 9179-9189Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), and 5′-TCC ACC ACC CTG TTG CTG TA-3′, which is complementary to nucleotides 1018–1037 of G3PDH cDNA. Amplification was performed using Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) over 29 cycles for prepro-ET-1, 29 cycles for ECE-1, and 18 cycles for G3PDH, with an automated thermal cycler (MJ Research, Inc.). Each cycle consisted of the following steps: denaturation at 94 °C, annealing at 62 °C, and extension for 1.5 min at 72 °C. Polymerase chain reaction products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. To quantitate the expression of the transcripts, the intensities of PCR bands were measured by densitometry and are expressed as relative intensities to G3PDH. UVB irradiation was administered with a bank of nine unfiltered FL20S-E sun lumps (Toshiba, Tokyo, Japan). The irradiance was measured with a UV radiometer (Tokyo Optical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Keratinocytes were seeded in T-75 flasks (Falcon) at a density of 5 × 104 to 105 cells/ml. After cultivation for 24–96 h, the culture medium in each flask was replaced with PBS. The cells were washed with 10 ml of PBS three times and were then kept in 10 ml of PBS. The cells were irradiated twice at a 48-h interval with doses of UVB light ranging from 10 to 80 mJ/cm2, because double irradiations were more effective than a single irradiation in secreting cytokines as described in our previous studies (7Imokawa G. Yada Y. Miyagishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24675-24680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). UVB light emitted most of its energy within the UVB range (295–315 nm) with a peak of 305 nm. Immediately after each UVB treatment, the PBS was removed and replaced with fresh medium. After cultivation for another 24 h, the cells were rinsed with PBS and collected. The level of significance of the difference was calculated by the Student t test. Peptides named PEPT6 and PEPT7, which correspond to the 15-amino acid sequences at the N and C termini of ECE-1α, respectively, were synthesized. The distinct reactivity of the anti-serum raised against PEPT6 (designated here as αPEPT6) with PEPT6 and the lack of its cross-reactivity with any other peptides (e.g. PEPT7 or PEP13 (the silver locus protein (32Kobayashi T. Urabe K. Orlow S.J. Higashi K. Imokawa G. Kwon B.S. Potterf S.B. Hearing V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29198-29205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) was demonstrated by ELISA (Fig. 1), showing αPEPT6 to be immunizing peptide-specific. It should be noted that αPEPT7 (which recognizes the C terminus of ECE-1α), the prebleed of αPEPT7, and the prebleed of αPEPT6 did not react with PEPT6, nor did αPEPT6 recognize peptides PEPT7 or PEP13. Western blotting analysis of endothelial cell extracts, which are known to predominantly express ECE-1α (33Orzechowski H.D. Richter C.M. Funke-kaiser H. Kroger B. Schmidt M. Menzel S. Bohnemeier H. Paul M. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 512-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), revealed that reactivity of αPEPT6 or αPEPT7 with the 130-kDa band was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the peptides PEPT6 or PEPT7, respectively, but not by PEPT7 or PEPT6, respectively, which demonstrates the high specificity of αPEPT6 and αPEPT7 for ECE-1α (Fig.2).Figure 2Specific immunoreactivity of αPEPT6 (A) and αPEPT7 (B). Human endothelial cells were solubilized in Nonidet P-40/SDS buffer; 4 μg of protein was then electrophoresed, and the immunoblot filters were incubated with αPEPT6 or αPEPT7 at a dilution of 1/1000, and peptides PEPT6 and PEPT7 at the indicated concentrations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) ELISA of Big ET-1 and ET-1 in conditioned medium revealed that human endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and keratinocytes, but not melanocytes, have the capacity to secret significant amounts of Big ET-1 and ET-1, with the highest conversion ratio from Big ET-1 to ET-1 in fibroblasts (Fig.3). RT-PCR analysis of ECE-1 transcript levels using various types of skin cells revealed that ECE-1 was distinctively expressed in cultured human keratinocytes. There was also a marked expression of the ECE-1 transcript in other types of cultured human skin cells, including fibroblasts and melanocytes, with the highest level being in endothelial cells (Fig.4). Western blotting with αPEPT6 revealed that ECE-1α protein was readily detectable in cultured human keratinocytes. Fibroblasts also produced ECE-1α protein, although at undetectable levels in melanocytes (Fig.5). When human keratinocytes were treated for 24 h with phosphoramidon, an inhibitor of metalloproteinases, ET-1 secretion into the medium was remarkably suppressed at concentrations of 1–100 μm, in a dose-dependent manner, and this was accompanied by a concomitant increase in the release of Big ET-1 (Fig.6). We compared ECE activity among various types of skin cells and endothelial cells. When cell extracts were incubated with Big ET-1 at pH 6.8, the highest activity of ECE was observed with endothelial cells. Lesser levels of ECE activity were found in fibroblasts and keratinocytes, and no detectable activity was found in melanocytes (Fig.7). Analysis of the optimal pH for ECE activity revealed that there was a sharp pH dependence in its activity with a peak (at pH 7.0–7.2) in endothelial cells and in keratinocytes (Fig. 8). Although the mean value of ECE activity at pH 6.8 in endothelial cells is different from that in Fig. 7, this difference may be due to substantial inter-donor variability. When 100 μmphosphoramidon was added to the assay mixture to exclude phosphoramidon-insensitive activity, the activity of phosphoramidon-sensitive ECE was found to exhibit only single peak at pH 6.6 and 7.0 in human endothelial cells and human keratinocytes, respectively (Fig. 9).Figure 9pH profiles of phosphoramidon-sensitive ECE activity of human endothelial cells (A) and keratinocytes (B). Enzyme fractions from human endothelial cells and keratinocytes were incubated with 0.1 μm Big ET-1, 0.5 m NaCl, and 100 μm phosphoramidon in the buffer solution (0.1m) at various pH levels as shown. The mixtures were then directly assayed for mature ET-1 as described above. Protein concentrations were also determined as described above. The values reported represent means ± S.D. from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To clarify to what extent ECE-1α contributes to the detectable ECE activity of human keratinocytes, we measured ECE activity following depletion of ECE-1α by immunoprecipitation with antibodies to ECE-1α (αPEPT6 and αPEPT7). Western blotting following the immunoprecipitation of ECE-1α demonstrated that the supernatant obtained after incubation of cell extracts contains a detectable band of ECE-1α following immunoprecipitation with αPEPT7 but not after immunoprecipitation with αPEPT6 (Fig. 10 A). In contrast, the precipitates from the same assays have distinct or weak bands of ECE-1α following immunoprecipitation with αPEPT6 or αPEPT7, respectively (Fig. 10 B). These results indicate that αPEPT6, but not αPEPT7, was able to immunoprecipitate ECE-1α. Assays of ECE activity in supernatants following immunoprecipitation with αPEPT6 demonstrated that endothelial cells and human keratinocytes have detectable activities of ECE, which correlate well with the ECE-1α immunoprecipitated with αPEPT 6 (Fig. 11).Figure 11ECE activity at pH 6.8 after immunodepletion of ECE-1α in extracts of human endothelial cells (A) and keratinocytes (B).Enzyme fractions from human endothelial cells and keratinocytes were incubated with αPEPT6 or with the prebleed of αPEPT6 and were then complexed with Protein G-Sepharose as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The resulting supernatants were used for Western blotting analysis and measurement of ECE activity at pH 6.8. Protein concentrations were determined as described above. The values reported represent means ± S.D. from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) UVB irradiation is a potent stimulator of ET-1 secretion by human keratinocytes (34Imokawa G. Kawai M. Mishima Y. Motegi I. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1986; 278: 352-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether UVB exposure, or its inducible primary cytokines, IL-1α and TNFα, stimulates the expression of ECE-1 in human keratinocytes. When human keratinocytes were exposed twice at a 48-h interval to UVB irradiation, the expression of transcripts encoding ECE-1 (as assessed by RT-PCR) (Fig.12) or of ECE-1α protein (as assessed by Western blotting analysis) (Fig. 13) was unchanged. This was in contrast to a marked dose-dependent increase in the expression of the transcript encoding prepro-ET-1. On the other hand, the addition of the UVB-inducible cytokine, IL-1α, at concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 0.5 nm stimulated the expression of ECE-1 transcripts (Fig.14) and ECE-1α protein (Fig.15) in a dose-dependent manner, although TNFα had no effect.Figure 13Western blotting of ECE-1α in human keratinocytes after UVB irradiation. Human keratinocytes were irradiated twice at a 48-h interval with doses of UVB light ranging from 10 to 80 mJ/cm2 and were collected after cultivation for another 24 h, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Human keratinocytes were solubilized in Nonidet P-40/SDS buffer; 10 μg protein from each extract were electrophoresed and analyzed by Western blotting, as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 14RT-PCR analysis of ECE-1 transcript levels in human keratinocytes after exposure to IL-1 α (A) or TNF α (B).

This microsomal opsin is bound to all-trans-retinal which, upon illumination, isomerizes stereospecifically to the 11-cisisomer. In this paper, we investigate the synthesis of the all-trans-retinal chromophore of RGR in cultured ARPE-hRGR and freshly isolated bovine RPE cells. Exogenous all-trans-[3H]retinol is incorporated into intact RPE cells and converted mainly into retinyl esters and all-trans-retinal. The intracellular processing of all-trans-[3H]retinol results in physiological binding to RGR of a radiolabeled retinoid, identified as all-trans-[3H]retinal. The ARPE-hRGR cells contain a membrane-bound NADPH-dependent retinol dehydrogenase that reacts efficiently with all-trans-retinol but not the 11-cis isomer. The NADPH-dependent all-trans-retinol dehydrogenase activity in isolated RPE microsomal membranes can be linked in vitro to specific binding of the chromophore to RGR. These findings provide confirmation that RGR opsin binds the chromophore, all-trans-retinal, in the dark.

Indeed, the role of RGR in a photic visual cycle may require synthesis of the all-trans-retinal chromophore directly from all-trans-retinol. These considerations suggest that a novel all-trans-retinol dehydrogenase exists in the RPE to provide the chromophore of RGR. Recently, we demonstrated the uptake of exogenous all-trans-retinol into lentivirus-transduced ARPE-hRGR cells and subsequent incorporation of the retinoid into a bound ligand of RGR (36Yang M. Wang X.-G. Stout J.T. Chen P. Hjelmeland L.M. Appukuttan B. Fong H.K.W. Mol. Vis. 2000; 6: 237-242(http://www.molvis.org/molvis/v6/a32)PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we confirm that all-trans-retinal is synthesized in RPE cells and becomes bound to RGR physiologically. We also present evidence for a novel all-trans-retinol dehydrogenase in both cultured ARPE-hRGR and isolated bovine RPE cells. All-trans-[11,12-3H]Retinol (50 Ci/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All-trans-retinol, all-trans-retinal, and all-trans-retinyl palmitate standards were purchased from Sigma. 11-Cis-retinal was provided by Dr. Rosalie Crouch (Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston). 11-Cis-retinol was prepared by the reduction of 11-cis-retinal in the presence of NaBH4, as described previously (37Landers G.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 189: 70-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). NADP and NAD were from Sigma. Organic solvents were HPLC grade. Dichloromethane and hexane were obtained from Fisher. Diethyl ether and methanol were from J. T. Baker Inc. Ethanol was from Gold Shield Chemical Company. ARPE-19 cells, a human RPE cell line, maintain many characteristics of normal RPE cells but do not express detectable levels of RGR opsin (38Dunn K.C. Aotaki-Keen A.E. Putkey F.R. Hjelmeland L.M. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 62: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). ARPE-hRGR cells, which stably express human RGR, were obtained by transduction of ARPE-19 cells with a recombinant lentivirus-human RGR vector (36Yang M. Wang X.-G. Stout J.T. Chen P. Hjelmeland L.M. Appukuttan B. Fong H.K.W. Mol. Vis. 2000; 6: 237-242(http://www.molvis.org/molvis/v6/a32)PubMed Google Scholar). The ARPE-19 and ARPE-hRGR cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and 1% glutamine-penicillin-streptomycin (Irvine Scientific) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Cells at passages 15–25 were grown and maintained at confluence for 1–2 weeks before use in each experiment. ARPE-hRGR and ARPE-19 cells were preincubated overnight with serum-free (retinol-free) RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The cells were then washed with RPMI 1640 medium and incubated in the dark with a mixture of all-trans-[3H]retinol (0.25 μCi/ml, 50 Ci/mmol), 500 μg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 0.5% sucrose in RPMI 1640 medium. After incubation for various lengths of time at 37 °C in 5% CO2, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), collected by scraping in 2 ml of 67 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.7, and homogenized with a Dounce glass homogenizer. After the pH was adjusted to 8.0 with 1n NaOH, 38 mg/ml NaBH4 was added to the suspension. The membranes were centrifuged at 150,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. 3H-Labeled proteins were analyzed by gel electrophoresis and fluorography. After separation by 12% SDS-PAGE, the proteins were fixed, and the gel was soaked in ENLIGHTNING Rapid Autoradiography Enhancer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The gel was dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR 5 autoradiographic film (Eastman Kodak Co.). The autoradiographic films were scanned, and relative band densities were determined using Scion Image 1.62c software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). Bovine eyes were obtained from a local abattoir. The RPE cells were isolated under ambient illumination 2–3 h after enucleation. The anterior segments, lens, vitreous, and neural retina were removed, and the eyecups were washed twice with ice-cold PBS to remove retina debris. The RPE cells were scraped off gently with a metal spatula and collected in ice-cold PBS. The cells were then centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed once with ice-cold PBS and centrifuged again. The following procedures were performed in the dark. The RPE cells were resuspended in 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (1:1) supplemented with all-trans-[3H]retinol (1.0 μCi/ml, 50 Ci/mmol), 500 μg/ml fatty acid-free BSA, and 0.5% sucrose and incubated in a culture flask for 3 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After incubation, the cells were collected with a cell scraper, centrifuged, and washed once with PBS. The cells were resuspended in 600 μl of PBS and homogenized with a Dounce glass homogenizer. The sample was treated with NaBH4, as described above. The membranes were then centrifuged at 150,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C and analyzed by gel electrophoresis and fluorography to detect 3H-labeled proteins. Alternatively, part of the cell homogenate was saved for Western blot assay, or the retinoids were extracted in the presence of hydroxylamine, as described below. All procedures were performed under dim red light. Retinal isomers were extracted by the method of hydroxylamine derivatization, as described previously (39De Groenendijk G.W.T. Grip W.J. Daemen F.J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 99: 304-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 40De Groenendijk G.W.T. Grip W.J. Daemen F.J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 617: 430-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Cultured ARPE-hRGR, ARPE-19, or bovine RPE cells were washed with PBS and homogenized in 300 μl of PBS using a Potter-Elvehjem microtissue grinder. The whole homogenate or membranes were mixed with 300 μl of methanol and then 30 μl of 2m NH2OH. After the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 5 min, 300 μl of CH2Cl2was added and mixed by vortexing for 30 s. The organic and aqueous phases were separated by centrifuge at 14,000 × g for 1 min. The aqueous phase was extracted twice more with CH2Cl2. The pooled CH2Cl2 solution was dried under nitrogen gas flow, dissolved in 600 μl of hexane, filtered through glass wool, dried again, and then stored at −80 °C for later analysis. The isomers of retinaloximes were analyzed by HPLC, as described previously (41Ozaki K. Terakita A. Hara R. Hara T. Vision Res. 1986; 26: 691-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 42Hao W. Chen P. Fong H.K.W. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 413-422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The extracted retinaloximes were dissolved in hexane and separated on a Resolve Silica column (3.9 × 150 mm, 5 μm) (Waters Corp.) using a Waters 2690 HPLC module. The running buffer consisted of hexane supplemented with 8% diethyl ether and 0.33% ethanol and was pumped at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Absorbance was measured at 360 nm and 320 nm with a Waters 2487 Dual Wavelength Absorbance Detector. The absorbance peaks were analyzed with the Millennium 32 Chromatography Manager software, version 3.20 (Waters Corp.). The HPLC column was calibrated before each run using all-trans- and 11-cis-retinaloxime and all-trans-retinol standards. Identification of the retinaloxime isomers was based on the retention times of the known retinaloxime products. The proportion of each isomer in the loading sample was determined from the total peak areas of both its syn- and anti-retinaloxime and was based on the following extinction coefficients (ε360, in hexane): all-trans syn, 54,900; all-trans anti, 51,600; 11-cis syn, 35,000; 11-cis anti, 29,600; 13-cis syn, 49,000; and 13-cis anti, 52,100 (40De Groenendijk G.W.T.

Vision Res. 1986; 26: 691-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The HPLC system was calibrated with 9.1–0.91 pmol of syn-all-trans-retinaloxime standard. The all-trans-retinyl palmitate standard was eluted in running buffer composed of hexane supplemented with 8% diethyl ether and 0.33% ethanol, or hexane supplemented with 0.3% ethyl acetate. The 3H-labeled retinoids were separated as described above. Four drops of the HPLC eluate were collected manually per fraction and were mixed with 10 ml of ScintiVerse BD scintillation mixture (Fisher Scientific). The amount of radioactivity was measured with a Beckman LS 6000IC counter. Identification of 3H-labeled retinoids was based on the retention times of known standards. ARPE-hRGR and ARPE-19 cells were preincubated overnight in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Total cell membranes were prepared from bovine RPE, cultured ARPE-hRGR, and ARPE-19 cells. The cells were homogenized in buffer containing 67 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.6, and 250 mm sucrose. The homogenate was centrifuged at 300 × g. Thereafter, the supernatant was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The membrane pellets were saved and stored at −80 °C. Microsomal membranes were prepared as described previously (26Shen D. Jiang M. Hao W. Tao L. Salazar M. Fong H.K.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13117-13125Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 36Yang M. Wang X.-G. Stout J.T. Chen P. Hjelmeland L.M. Appukuttan B. Fong H.K.W. Mol. Vis. 2000; 6: 237-242(http://www.molvis.org/molvis/v6/a32)PubMed Google Scholar). The following procedures were performed in darkness or under dim red light. Microsomal membranes were washed and resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.1% BSA. The reactions were initiated by the addition of the membranes to 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% BSA, NADP or NAD, and 1 μmall-trans-[3H]retinol (reaction volume, 300 μl). The specific activity of all-trans-[3H]retinol was made 5 Ci/mmol by dilution with unlabeled all-trans-retinol. Solutions of 10 mm NADP or NAD were made fresh and added to give the indicated final concentrations. After incubation at 37 °C for the specified amount of time, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 300 μl of methanol and then 30 μl of 2 mNH2OH. The retinaloximes were extracted and analyzed by HPLC, as described previously. The HPLC fractions were collected, and the amount of radioactivity was determined. When nonradioactive substrates were used, retinol dehydrogenase activity was assayed with 5 μm exogenous all-trans-retinol or 11-cis-retinol in the presence of 200 μm NADP. Retinals were extracted by hydroxylamine derivatization and analyzed by HPLC. The extraction efficiency was monitored by the addition of all-trans-[3H]retinol to the methanol-denatured samples. Under the experimental conditions, the reaction rate for production of all-trans-retinal was linear within the initial 10 min. Microsomal membranes from bovine RPE, ARPE-hRGR, and ARPE-19 cells were washed and resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.1% BSA. The reactions were initiated in the dark by addition of the membranes to 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% BSA, 200 μm NADP or none, and 0.2 μm all-trans-[3H]retinol (10 μCi/ml, 50 Ci/mmol). After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the membranes were sedimented by centrifugation at 150,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet was washed, resuspended in 1 ml of PBS, and mixed with 38 mg of NaBH4. The membranes were then centrifuged, resuspended in PBS containing 0.1% SDS, and analyzed by gel electrophoresis and fluorography, as described previously. The membranes were resuspended in PBS, and protein concentration was measured by the Bio-Rad protein assay. The samples were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and then electrotransferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). An affinity-purified antipeptide antibody (28Jiang M. Pandey S. Fong H.K.W. Invest.

Prestained protein standards (Invitrogen) were used for molecular weight markers. ARPE-hRGR cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (1:1) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were maintained overnight in culture flasks wrapped in aluminum foil and were then processed under dim red light. The cells were washed with PBS, removed with a cell scraper, centrifuged, and resuspended in 300 μl of PBS. The suspended cells were transferred to a quartz cuvette and illuminated at room temperature for 5 min with 470-nm monochromatic light from an Oriel light source, model 66057, equipped with a 150-watt xenon arc lamp. An equivalent aliquot of ARPE-hRGR cells was kept in the dark as a control. Retinal isomers were extracted in the presence of hydroxylamine and and analyzed by HPLC, as described previously (39De Groenendijk G.W.T. Grip W.J. Daemen F.J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 99: 304-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 40De Groenendijk G.W.T. Grip W.J. Daemen F.J.M. Biochim. Biophys.

Fong H.K.W. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 413-422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have demonstrated previously that precursor all-trans-retinol can be incorporated into a bound ligand of RGR in cultured ARPE-hRGR cells (36Yang M. Wang X.-G. Stout J.T. Chen P. Hjelmeland L.M. Appukuttan B. Fong H.K.W. Mol. Vis. 2000; 6: 237-242(http://www.molvis.org/molvis/v6/a32)PubMed Google Scholar). ARPE-hRGR cells with high long term expression of human RGR were incubated with all-trans-[3H]retinol in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. The results indicated that a specific ∼30-kDa protein bound [3H]retinoid (Fig.1A). The ∼30-kDa protein band was not detected in control ARPE-19 cells that lack RGR (36Yang M. Wang X.-G. Stout J.T. Chen P. Hjelmeland L.M. Appukuttan B. Fong H.K.W. Mol. Vis. 2000; 6: 237-242(http://www.molvis.org/molvis/v6/a32)PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of [3H]retinoid to RGR in vivo was dependent on the time of incubation with all-trans-[3H]retinol. Binding occurred within 20 min and reached the highest level by 2 h of incubation with all-trans-[3H]retinol (Fig. 1B). Subsequently, the amount of [3H]retinoid bound to RGR remained relatively steady for up to 6 h of incubation in the dark. Under the experimental conditions, no other membrane protein bound the radiolabeled retinoid. The detection of noncovalently bound [3H]retinoid would not be expected in this assay. The results are consistent with the formation of a Schiff base linkage between [3H]retinal and the ∼30-kDa protein and subsequent reduction of the bond to a stable secondary amine in the presence of sodium borohydride. The specific binding of [3H]retinoid to RGR suggests that all-trans-retinal is produced in ARPE-hRGR cells as a chromophore for the RGR opsin. To verify that all-trans-retinal is synthesized in ARPE-hRGR cells, we extracted 3H-labeled retinals after incubation of the cells in the presence of all-trans-[3H]retinol. The distribution of [3H]retinoids extracted from the ARPE-hRGR cells included a significant pool of retinyl esters (44%), all-trans-retinal (16%), and all-trans-retinol (40%) (Fig. 2, upper panel). The specific activity of all-trans-[3H]retinal from the cells was ∼51 Ci/mmol, as determined from the amount of radioactivity and the corresponding absorbance peak of all-trans-retinal in the HPLC chromatogram. This specific activity was virtually identical to that of the added exogenous all-trans-[3H]retinol. The control ARPE-19 cells had a distinct profile of [3H]retinoids and contained retinyl esters (66%), all-trans-retinal (3%), and all-trans-retinol (31%) (Fig. 2, lower panel). Neither type of cell contained significant amounts of 11-cis-retinal or 11-cis-retinol. The results indicate that the retinal isomer bound to RGR in the dark in ARPE-hRGR cells is solely all-trans-retinal. ARPE-hRGR cells cultured in growth medium also synthesize the all-trans-retinal chromophore from a precursor in serum (Fig. 3). The fresh culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum contains at least 30 pmol/ml of all-trans-retinol. All-trans-retinal was found in ARPE-hRGR cells (Fig. 3A) but not in control ARPE-19 cells that were maintained in serum-containing medium (Fig.3B). When the ARPE-hRGR cells were preincubated in serum-free medium for 16 h, all-trans-retinal fell to an undetectable level (Fig. 3C). Irradiation of the ARPE-hRGR cells resulted in stereospecific isomerization of the endogenous all-trans-retinal to 11-cis-retinal (Fig. 4). The proportion of all-trans- to 11-cis-retinal in the ARPE-hRGR cells was 2.60:0 pmol in the dark and 1.12:0.55 pmol after illumination with 470-nm monochromatic light. Photoisomerization to 13-cis-retinal was not detected.Figure 4Photoisomerization of all-trans-retinal in ARPE-hRGR cells. ARPE-hRGR cells (∼1.5 × 107) were cultured in the dark in serum-containing (retinol-containing) medium. The cells were suspended in PBS and either kept in the dark (upper panel) or illuminated with 470-nm monochromatic light at 410 lux (lower panel). The retinal isomers were extracted by hydroxylamine derivatization and analyzed by HPLC. 11-cis, 11-cis-retinal; all, all-trans-retinal (in the form of syn-retinaloximes).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The production of the all-trans-retinal chromophore from all-trans-retinol requires an oxidation reaction. The proposed enzymatic reaction may be catalyzed by a previously uncharacterized all-trans-retinol dehydrogenase in the RPE. We tested microsomal membranes from ARPE-hRGR cells for all-trans-retinol dehydrogenase activity in the presence of nicotinamide dinucleotide cofactors. The membranes were capable of producing all-trans-retinal from all-trans-retinol in the presence of NADP but not NAD (Fig.5A). At concentrations of >8 μm NADP, the synthesis of all-trans-retinal increased 5-fold compared with activity without cofactor or with NAD. The putative NADPH-dependent retinol dehydrogenase strongly preferred the all-trans isomer of retinol and did not react with 11-cis-retinol (Fig. 5B). The microsomal membranes from control ARPE-19 cells also contained all-trans-retinol dehydrogenase activity in the presence of NADP (results not shown). Although the parental ARPE-19 cells maintain many characteristics of RPE cells, they are highly deficient in the expression of several RPE proteins, including RGR, and may not function normally. To demonstrate that the synthesis of all-trans-retinal and specific binding of the chromophore to RGR are physiological properties of normal RPE cells, we incubated freshly isolated bovine RPE cells with precursor all-trans-[3H]retinol (Fig.6). The uptake of all-trans-[3H]retinol resulted in radiolabeling of a specific protein band that was equal in size to the RGR opsin (Fig. 6A). RGR was detectable by Western blot assay after the short term incubation of the bovine RPE cells (Fig.6B) but not after 5 days of culture in serum-containing medium (results not shown). After 3 h of incubation, the cells synthesized retinyl esters (62%), all-trans-retinal (23%), 11-cis-retinal (2%), and 11-cis-retinol (2%) (Fig. 6C). All-trans-retinol (7%) and a small amount of 13-cis-retinal (3%) were also extracted from the cells. Because the accumulation of all-trans-retinal in ARPE-hRGR and ARPE-19 cells was dependent on the presence of RGR (Figs.2 and 3), the synthesis or stability of all-trans-retinal may be connected with its binding to the opsin. To investigate chromophore synthesis and binding to RGR in an in vitrosystem, we incubated isolated RPE membranes with all-trans-[3H]retinol in the presence of NADP and analyzed the binding of [3H]retinoid to RGR. The results indicated that all-trans-[3H]retinal was synthesized in membranes and bound directly to RGR with high specificity (Fig. 7). Nontransduced ARPE-19 cells did not contain the radiolabeled ∼30-kDa protein band (Fig. 7A). The binding of [3H]retinoid to RGR in bovine RPE microsomes was stimulated 3.1-fold by the addition of NADP (Fig. 7B). The results indicate that all-trans-retinal, which is synthesized by the membrane-associated all-trans-retinol dehydrogenase, can be channeled to the binding site of RGR in the cell-free system. Little is known about the synthesis of all-trans-retinal as a chromophore for the RGR opsin in RPE cells. The endogenous all-trans-retinal bound to RGR may be synthesized directly from all-trans-retinol that is generated upon phototransduction or from serum all-trans-retinol. This reaction would require a novel all-trans-retinol dehydrogenase in the RPE. In this paper, we demonstrate further evidence for the oxidation of precursor all-trans-retinol in RPE cells and its physiological incorporation into the chromophore of RGR in the dark. After its uptake into RPE cells, all-trans-retinol is converted rapidly into retinyl esters. The esterification of retinol is catalyzed by lecithin-retinol acyltransferase, the activity of which is higher than is known for most other visual cycle enzymes. In addition to esterification, our results indicate that retinol is oxidized efficiently and that significant amounts of all-trans-retinal accumulate in ARPE-hRGR and bovine RPE cells in the absence of light. Despite the high lecithin-retinol acyltransferase activity, the ratio of all-trans-retinal to retinyl esters formed after 3 h of incubation with precursor all-trans-retinol is 1:2.8 and 1:2.7 in ARPE-hRGR and bovine RPE cells, respectively. Because the specific activity of all-trans-[3H]retinal in the ARPE-hRGR cells was close to that of the precursor all-trans-[3H]retinol, all-trans-retinol can be converted directly into all-trans-retinal without entering the pool of endogenous retinyl esters. The results suggest that retinol esterification by lecithin-retinol acyltransferase and oxidation by an all-trans-retinol dehydrogenase represent an early and important bifurcation point in the processing of retinol after uptake into RPE cells. The esterification and oxidation are both critical reactions for continuance of the visual cycle in that they catalyze formation of the substrate for a putative isomerohydrolase (18Law W.C.

The difference in steady-state levels of all-trans-retinal in ARPE-hRGR and ARPE-19 cells indicates that the accumulation of all-trans-retinal is highly dependent on the presence of RGR. Although the membranes from ARPE-19 and other cells contain constitutive NADPH-dependent all-trans-retinol dehydrogenase activity and are capable of synthesizing all-trans-retinal from all-trans-retinol, all-trans-retinal generally does not accumulate in these cells (43Williams J.B.

Chem. 1982; 257: 1730-1735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Normal RPE and cultured ARPE-hRGR cells have uniquely elevated levels of all-trans-retinal, which may be stabilized by covalent binding to RGR. The sequestration of all-trans-retinal to RGR would block the retinoid from reversible reduction, oxidation to retinoic acid, formation of nonspecific Schiff bases, and possible generation of harmfulbis-retinoid,N-retinylidene-N-retinylethanolamine compounds within the RPE (45Parish C.A. Hashimoto M. Nakanishi K. Dillon J. Sparrow J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14609-14613Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Failure to detect all-trans-retinal in RPE may result from inefficient extraction methods or the loss of RGR expression in cultured cells. The irradiation of ARPE-hRGR cells resulted in stereospecific isomerization of all-trans-retinal to 11-cis-retinal, indicating a functional recombinant RGR and physiological activity of the endogenous all-trans-retinal. With the ARPE-hRGR cells, the 11-cis retinoid metabolic pathways that lie downstream of the RGR opsin can be analyzed under a variety of culture and lighting conditions. Our finding of all-trans-retinal synthesis and accumulation in RPE cells is not inconsistent with data from previous studies. Timmers et al. (46Timmers A.M. van Groningen-Luyben D.A. de Grip W.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1991; 52: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) have demonstrated a slow constant increase in the synthesis of all-trans-retinal in isolated bovine RPE cells. Others have reported NADPH-dependent all-trans-retinol dehydrogenase activity in RPE membranes. As early as 1975, Zimmerman et al. (14Zimmerman W.F. Lion F. Daemen F.J.M. Bonting S.L. Exp. Eye Res. 1975; 21: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 15Zimmerman W.F. Exp. Eye Res. 1976; 23: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) noted that RPE microsomes contain a relatively high amount of all-trans-retinol dehydrogenase activity in membrane vesicles that fractionate separately from contaminant membranes with the photoreceptor all-trans-retinol dehydrogenase. These interesting findings further support the notion that the all-trans-retinal chromophore is synthesized by a novel all-trans-retinol dehydrogenase in the RPE. Nevertheless, the putative RPE all-trans-retinol dehydrogenase has not been identified unequivocally. Further characterization of the all-trans-retinol dehydrogenase in ARPE-hRGR and isolated RPE cells is required. Our results indicate that the retinol dehydrogenase in ARPE-hRGR cells is membrane-bound, prefers NADP as the cofactor in oxidation, and has high substrate stereospecificity for all-trans-retinol versus the 11-cisisomer. We hypothesize that this enzyme is responsible for chromophore synthesis in ARPE-hRGR cells. To investigate the coupling between chromophore synthesis and its binding to RGR, we examined the reactions in vitro. In a cell-free membrane system, RGR had apparent and specific access to the newly synthesized all-trans-retinal. The microsomal membranes of both the human ARPE-hRGR cell line and bovine RPE cells were sufficient for the synthesis of all-trans-retinal and its channeling to the binding site of RGR. The results indicate that both cells contain a membrane-bound all-trans-retinol dehydrogenase and may have a highly conserved system of providing the chromophore of RGR. The binding of all-trans-[3H]retinal to RGR was enhanced in the presence of NADP, although RGR was also radiolabeled in the absence of added cofactor. Like preparations of various dehydrogenases (47Kato T. Berger S.J. Carter J.A. Lowry O.H. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 53: 86-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), it is likely that the washed membranes still contained a significant amount of endogenous enzyme-bound NADP that allowed background synthesis of all-trans-[3H]retinal. The physical relationship between the RPE all-trans-retinol dehydrogenase and RGR is unknown. The all-trans-retinal chromophore of RGR may be synthesized also from precursor β,β-carotene by the oxidative cleavage activity of an enzyme, β,β-carotene-15,15′-dioxygenase (Bcdo) that has been found in the RPE (48Redmond T.M.

The oxidative cleavage of β,β-carotene by Bcdo would directly generate all-trans-retinal under dark or photic conditions. The all-trans-retinal synthesized from β,β-carotene may then bind to RGR physiologically. In humans, β,β-carotene and vitamin A are available to the RPE at plasma levels of 0.171–0.216 and 0.548–0.587 μg/ml, respectively (50Schünemann H.J. Grant B.J.B. Freudenheim J.L. Muti P. Browne R.W. Drake J.A. Klocke R.A. Trevisan M. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 163: 1246-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). On the other hand, only all-trans-retinol is transported from the photoreceptors to the RPE as an intermediate in the visual cycle. Consequently, the RPE all-trans-retinol dehydrogenase would be required to process all-trans-retinol rapidly in a continuous photic visual cycle. Like rhodopsin, the RGR opsin relies on retinol dehydrogenases for the processing of its retinal chromophore in biochemical pathways that lie upstream and downstream of photoisomerization. In contrast to the two-cell rhodopsin system, the all-trans-retinal chromophore of RGR is synthesized by a proximal retinol dehydrogenase within membranes of the RPE itself. After irradiation of RGR, the bound 11-cis-retinal is dissociated and converted to the alcohol by 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase (51Chen P. Lee T.D. Fong H.K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21098-21104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). RGR and the 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase copurify consistently and may be tightly associated in a protein complex. The evidence for functional interaction of all-trans-retinol dehydrogenase, RGR opsin, and 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase suggests a model for the flow of retinoids in the photic visual cycle (Fig.8). In this model, all-trans-retinal is converted to 11-cis-retinal by rapid photoisomerization, and the overall rate of conversion of all-trans retinoids to the 11-cis isomer is limited by binding kinetics and the enzymatic reactions catalyzed by the retinol dehydrogenases. The ARPE-hRGR and isolated RPE cells provide a promising approach to compare and analyze the biochemistry and kinetics of retinoid processing in the RGR system.

https://openalex.org/W2144807409,"The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene encodes two structurally related isozymes, somatic ACE and germinal ACE, that are uniquely expressed in discrete locations in the body. The importance of ACE in these cell types was revealed by generating Ace −/− mice, which exhibit multiple abnormalities including renal structural defects and functions, hypotension, and male sterility. To test the hypothesis that specific physiological functions of ACE are mediated by isozyme-specific and tissue-specific expression patterns, we have used a transgenic approach to develop mouse strains that express just one ACE isoform in the target tissue of Ace −/− mice. The mice described in this report produce germinal ACE in sperm and serum. These mice were as healthy as wild type mice, and the males were fertile. Interestingly, they had normal kidney structure, fluid homeostasis, and partially restored urine concentration despite having low blood pressure. This result demonstrated that circulating germinal ACE is sufficient for maintaining normal kidney structure and fluid homeostasis but insufficient for restoring blood pressure to normal levels."

These residues mediate high affinity binding of the hydrolases to mannose 6-phosphate receptors in thetrans-Golgi network (TGN), a necessary step in the transport of the hydrolases to lysosomes (1Kornfeld S. FASEB J. 1987; 1: 462-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that UCE itself resides in the TGN and cycles constitutively between this compartment and the plasma membrane (2Rohrer J. Kornfeld R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1623-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This previous study (2Rohrer J. Kornfeld R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1623-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) also establishes that the 488YHPL491 and C-terminal 511NPFKD515 motifs present in the cytoplasmic domain of UCE were important in the trafficking of the enzyme. Mouse L-cells expressing human UCE with a Y488A mutation had 63% of total enzyme activity on the cell surface at steady state compared with 1% of wild-type enzyme activity. The His510 stop mutant was intermediate with 7% of the enzyme activity at the cell surface. Because this analysis only involved steady-state measurements of enzyme activity, it was not possible to distinguish whether the mutations affected the rate of internalization, recycling of internalized UCE to the cell surface, enhanced escape of the enzyme from the TGN, or some combination of these processes. Furthermore, the molecular mechanism(s) by which the mutations alter trafficking were not explored. In this study, we have examined the kinetics of internalization of these and additional mutant forms of UCE. We have also analyzed the ability of the cytoplasmic tail of UCE to interact with the plasma membrane adaptor complex AP-2 and with Eps15, an accessory protein that binds NPF sequences and the α subunit of AP-2. Finally, we have examined the role of the cytoplasmic tail in the exit of UCE from the TGN. Our findings indicate that multiple signals regulate the trafficking of UCE at different compartments along the plasma membrane and endosomal and TGN trafficking pathway. The cellular distribution of UCE activity using the standard assay with [3H]GlcNAc-P-ManαMe as substrate was performed on a variety of parental and human UCE-expressing mouse L-cells plated in 24-well tissue culture dishes as described previously (2Rohrer J. Kornfeld R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1623-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Assays were performed on cells in buffer that contained either 1% Triton X-100 (total UCE activity) or no detergent (surface UCE activity). The surface biotinylation of UCE was carried out by the method described previously (3Rohrer J. Schweizer A. Russell D. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) on 12-well plates of confluent mouse L-cells transfected with human UCE. The plates were chilled on ice, and the cells were washed with 1 ml of PBS at 4 °C and then twice with 1 ml of PBS++ (PBS supplemented with 0.7 mm CaCl2 and 0.25 mm MgSO4). 500 μl of PBS++ containing 1 mg/ml of Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) were then added for 30 min on ice. After the biotinylation, the reagent was removed, and the cells were quickly washed twice with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline containing 50 mm glycine, pH 7.0, and then twice with Tris-buffered saline alone, pH 7.0. Control plates were kept on ice to allow the measurement of total cell surface-biotinylated UCE. The other plates were quickly brought to 37 °C with prewarmed α-minimum Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and incubated at 37 °C for various times to allow uptake of biotinylated UCE followed by rapid cooling on ice to stop uptake and washing twice with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline. The remaining cell surface-biotinylated UCE was stripped of biotin with 2-mercaptoethane sulfonic acid (Sigma) as described by Moll et al. (4Moll M. Klenk H-D. Herrier G. Maisner A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17887-17894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The cells were treated with 500 μl of 50 mm 2-mercaptoethane sulfonic acid in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.7, 100 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2 at 4 °C two times for 20 min before washing twice with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.0. One well was stripped at 0 time (never exposed to 37 °C) to correct for the small amount of biotinylated UCE (usually <10%) that cannot be stripped. The control wells were never stripped. The cells in all wells were lysed in 250 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The lysed cells were incubated 30 min at 4 °C before sedimenting at 260,000 × g for 20 min. An aliquot of the supernatant lysate was assayed for total UCE activity, and 200 μl were added to a Microfuge tube containing 25 μl of packed streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) preequilibrated with lysis buffer. The biotinylated UCE uptake was allowed to adsorb to the beads for 2 .5 h with turning at 4 °C. The beads were removed by centrifugation at 835 × g for 1 min and washed twice with lysis buffer before being assayed directly for UCE activity. The control beads represent the UCE biotinylated at the cell surface initially. The 0 time represents the UCE activity that could not be stripped and was used to correct the uptake at 37 °C for various times. The uptake is expressed as the percentage of the total biotinylated UCE. Values for t½ of endocytosis were derived graphically from semilog plots of % biotinylated UCE remaining at the cell surface versus time using the early time points. The exocytosis of internalized UCE was measured for the Y486A UCE mutant by allowing biotinylated UCE uptake as described above for 5 min followed by chilling to 4 °C and stripping of the cell surface biotin with 2-mercaptoethane sulfonic acid. The cells were rewarmed to 37 °C for various times to allow exocytosis of internalized biotinylated UCE, chilled at 4 °C and stripped, and the biotinylated UCE within the cells was measured after cell lysis as described above. Full-length cDNAs encoding wild-type, mutant Y488A, and H510Stop (the His510stop construct (H510Stop)) UCEs prepared as described previously (2Rohrer J. Kornfeld R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1623-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) were used as templates in PCR reactions. The PCR reactions also contained a sense strand primer including an in-frame BamHI restriction site at the 5′ end (CCTGTCCTGGATCCTGTCCAGAGC) and an antisense strand primer including an XhoI site at the 3′ end (5′-CAAGCTTTCTCGAGGTGCCACCCC-3′). The PCR fragments encoding Leu473 through the stop codon at 510 or 516 were gel-purified, digested with BamHI and XhoI, and inserted into a similarly digested pGEX-5X-3 plasmid downstream of GST. Other mutations of the cytoplasmic tail in the GST fusion protein constructs were derived from the GST-UCE fusion constructs by QuikChange mutagenesis using the kit from Stratagene and the appropriate mutant primers. All coding sequences created by PCR were verified by sequencing. The fusion proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli BL21 cells and purified as described by Traub et al. (5Traub L.M.

New mutants in the cytosolic tail of human full-length UCE cDNA were prepared as described previously (2Rohrer J. Kornfeld R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1623-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) using the new Stratagene QuikChange XL mutagenesis kit and the appropriate nucleotide primers encoding the mutant sequence according to the instructions by the manufacturer. The mutant cDNAs were transfected into mouse L-cells and stably transfected cells isolated as described previously (2Rohrer J. Kornfeld R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1623-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Cytosol from bovine adrenal glands was prepared as described previously (6Drake M.T. Zhu Y. Kornfeld S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3723-3736Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The cytosol was depleted of AP-2 by adsorption with an immobilized anti-AP-2 antibody as described previously (7Traub L.M. Ostrom J.A. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Eps15 was depleted from the cytosol by adsorption with immobilized GST-αC (αC is the C-terminal domain of the α subunit of AP-2) as described previously (5Traub L.M. Downs M.A. Westrich J.L. Fremont D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8907-8912Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar).E. coli BL21 cells expressing GST-αC were kindly provided by Dr. Linton Traub, and the fusion protein was purified as above. GST-αC can effectively remove Eps15, Epsin, amphiphysin, AP-180, and dynamin from cytosol (5Traub L.M. Downs M.A. Westrich J.L. Fremont D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The association of cytosolic proteins with the GST-UCE-cytoplasmic tail fusion proteins was carried out essentially as described previously (5Traub L.M. Downs M.A. Westrich J.L. Fremont D.H. Proc.

After incubation at 4 °C for 1 h, the glutathione-Sepharose beads were pelleted and washed twice with assay buffer (25 mm Hepes-OH, pH 7.2, 125 mmpotassium acetate, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and twice with PBS before boiling in reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer. An aliquot of the supernatant was also boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and 1–4% of the total supernatant and 10–40% of the total pellet for each sample were run on an 8% reducing SDS-PAGE gel. The gel was blotted to nitrocellulose and probed with antibodies to Eps15 and AP-2α followed by exposure to appropriate horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody and detection with ECL using X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak Co.). For quantitation of Eps15 and AP-2 binding, the film was scanned using Adobe Photoshop 6.0 and analyzed using NIH Image 1.61 and SigmaPlot 1997 software. Rabbit antiserum raised to a synthetic peptide of Eps15 was kindly provided by Dr. Ernst Ungewickell (Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany). Mouse monoclonal antibody 100/2 against the α-adaptin subunit of AP-2 and mouse monoclonal antibody 100/1 against AP-1/2β subunits were purchased from Sigma. Mouse monoclonal antibody TD.1 against clathrin heavy chain was kindly provided by Frances Brodsky (UCSF, San Francisco, CA), and rabbit antibody to α-mannosidase II was kindly provided by Kelley Moreman (University of Georgia, Athens, GA). The affinity-purified rabbit antibody to cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) was a gift from Walter Gregory of this laboratory, and the affinity-purified rabbit anti-human UCE was prepared as described previously (2Rohrer J. Kornfeld R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1623-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Clathrin-coated vesicles were isolated by the method of Woodman and Warren (8Woodman P.G. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) from mouse L-cells that were CI-MPR negative and had been stably transfected with bovine CI-MPR (Cc2 cells (9Lobel P. Fujimoto K. Ye R.D. Griffiths G. Kornfeld S. Cell. 1989; 57: 787-796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar)). 2-ml fractions were collected from the second density gradient centrifugation (Ficoll-D2O) from the bottom to the top. Aliquots of each fraction were submitted to SDS-PAGE on an 8% gel, blotted to nitrocellulose, and probed with a mixture of antibodies to CI-MPR, clathrin heavy chain, α-Mannosidase II, and both AP-2 α and AP-1/2 β. The blot was developed with a mixture of horseradish peroxidase anti-rabbit and horseradish peroxidase anti-mouse secondary antibodies and ECL detection. Another aliquot of 0.5 ml from fractions 3–11 was diluted in MES buffer and pelleted at 260,000 × g for 20 min in a Beckman Optima TL ultracentrifuge. The pellet from each fraction was resuspended in 40 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 20 μl were used for another SDS gel, and 20 μl were assayed for UCE activity. Nucleotide sequences encoding the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail of UCE were fused to the preprolactin signal sequence-GFP construct and transiently expressed in HeLa cells as described previously (2Rohrer J. Kornfeld R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1623-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Confocal fluorescence microscopy on GFP-UCE-transfected HeLa cells was carried out using stacks of images that were deconvoluted as described previously (2Rohrer J. Kornfeld R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1623-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). As the initial approach to further define the determinants in the 41-residue-cytoplasmic tail of UCE (Fig.1) that modulate its trafficking, a series of additional mutations in this domain was generated, and their effect on cell surface expression of UCE activity was analyzed. The non-transfected parental mouse L-cells have 1.6% of their endogenous UCE on the cell surface (Table I). Cells transfected with wild-type human UCE have only a slightly greater percentage of activity on the cell surface (2.3–3.2%) despite expressing a 14–21-fold more total activity. As reported previously (2Rohrer J. Kornfeld R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1623-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), UCE with a Y488A mutation had 63% of total activity on the cell surface. The UCE-cytoplasmic tail contains a second tyrosine located two residues upstream from the 488YHPL491sequence. Interestingly, the mutation of this tyrosine to alanine (the Y486A construct) resulted in 26–36% of the enzyme activity being present on the cell surface in different clones. Mutation of both tyrosines to alanines (the Y486A/Y488A construct) had a small additional effect (68% of activity on the cell surface) over mutation of Tyr488 alone.Table IDistribution of expressed human UCE in transfected mouse L-cellsCell lineTotal UCEUCE on cell surfacet1/2 of UCE endocytosisnmol/h/mg%minParent L-cells7.3 (4)1.6 (2)NDWild-type UCE clone 38101 (15)2.3 (8) clone 29148 (2)3.2 (1)0.65Y486A UCE clone 211166 (1)26 (1) clone 228234 (1)32 (1) clone 214507 (4)36 (3)0.4Y488A UCE173 (7)63 (6)97Y486A/Y488A UCE368 (2)68 (2)NDHis510 stop UCE198 (6)7.8 (5)0.55Met494 stop UCE162 (7)2.2 (2)NDY486A/Met494 stop UCE143 (5)5.9 (3)1.5Y488A/Met494 stop UCE276 (2)50 (2)NDTyr486 stop UCE105 (3)16 (2)39The values are averages of the number of measurements shown in parenthesis. ND is not determined. Open table in a new tab The values are averages of the number of measurements shown in parenthesis. ND is not determined. Deletion of the outer six residues of the tail (H510Stop) resulted in 7.8% UCE activity being at the plasma membrane, whereas the deletion of the outer 21 residues (the Met494 stop construct (M494Stop)) did not increase cell surface expression (2.2% on cell surface). Furthermore, the mutation of Tyr488 to alanine in the context of the M494Stop mutation resulted in 50% cell surface expression versus 63% with the Y488A mutation in the full-length tail. The mutation of Tyr486 to alanine in the M494Stop background gave rise to only 5.9% of enzyme activity on the cell surface versus 26–36% when this mutation is made in the full-length tail. When all of the cytoplasmic tail with the exception of 11 residues were deleted (the Tyr486 stop construct (Y486Stop)), only 16% UCE activity was present on the cell surface, even though this mutant lacks both Tyr486 and Tyr488. The steady-state level of UCE at the plasma membrane is determined by the rate of endocytosis of the enzyme, the fraction of internalized enzyme that recycles from endosomes back to the plasma membrane, and the rate at which the enzyme exits the TGN and is delivered to the plasma membrane. This delivery may be direct or occur following an initial transport to an endosomal compartment. Thus, mutations in the cytoplasmic tail that increase the steady-state level of UCE on the plasma membrane could be influencing one or more of these trafficking events. To begin to distinguish between these possibilities, we directly measured the endocytosis rate of wild-type UCE and a number of the mutants. The various cell lines were plated on a series of culture plates, and cell surface UCE was tagged with NHS-SS-biotin, a cleavable biotinylation reagent that does not permeate the membrane. Following biotinylation at 4 °C, the total cell surface biotinylated UCE was measured by lysing the cells from one dish and capturing the biotinylated UCE on streptavidin-agarose beads. To measure the uptake of biotinylated UCE, the remaining culture plates were brought to 37 °C for various times and then rapidly chilled, and residual cell surface-biotinylated UCE was stripped by cleavage of the S–S bond with the non-permeant-reducing agent 2-mercaptoethane sulfonic acid. The internalized biotinylated UCE was captured from lysed cells on streptavidin-agarose beads, and UCE activity was assayed directly on the washed beads. Fig. 2 shows the results of the uptake experiments expressed as a percent of the total biotinylated UCE internalized, and Table I lists the calculated internalization rates. The rate of uptake of wild-type UCE was very rapid with at½ of 0.65 min. Y486A UCE was endocytosed at approximately the same rate as wild-type UCE (t½ = 0.4 min). This finding indicates that the increased amount of this mutant UCE on the cell surface (36%) is not the consequence of impaired internalization. The double mutant Y486A/M494Stop, which has much less cell surface enzyme (5.9%), had an endocytosis rate that was modestly slower than that of wild-type UCE (t½ = 1.5 min). The rate of internalization of H510Stop UCE was also rapid (t½ = 0.55 min), indicating that the small increase in surface expression of this mutant is not secondary to slow internalization. In contrast, Y486Stop UCE and Y488A UCE were taken up quite slowly (t½ >30 min). The decreased rate of internalization of Y488A correlates well with its high level of cell surface expression (63%). However Y486Stop accumulates to a much lesser extent on the cell surface (16%), indicating that it is delivered to the plasma membrane at a slower rate than Y488A UCE. The rapid uptake of Y486A UCE in the presence of an elevated level of cell surface molecules suggested that the internalized enzyme may be recycling from an endosomal compartment back to the plasma membrane. To estimate the exocytosis rate of Y486A UCE from the recycling endosomal compartment, cells expressing this mutant enzyme were biotinylated at 4 °C, warmed to 37 °C for 5 min to allow endocytosis of the biotinylated UCE, and then chilled at 4 °C with subsequent stripping of remaining biotin from cell surface UCE. The plates of these cells were then rewarmed to 37 °C for 2, 5, or 10 min before chilling and stripping the biotin from externalized UCE. The internal biotinylated UCE was captured on streptavidin-Sepharose beads and measured. The result shown in Fig.3 and expressed as the percent of internal biotinylated UCE that was exocytosed does indeed indicate a rapid recycling of UCE back to the cell surface. Taking into account the rapid rate of reendocytosis of externalized biotinylated UCE, which is occurring during the experiment, it can be estimated that thet½ of exocytosis of Y486A UCE is between 1 and 2 min or 2.5–5 times slower than the t½ of endocytosis. The curve is already approaching steady state by the 10-min time point. This recycling experiment could not be performed with the wild-type UCE, because the low level of surface expression prevented adequate labeling. Tyrosine 488, which is essential for rapid endocytosis, is part of the YHPL motif that fits the well known endocytosis motif of YXXφ (where φ is a bulky hydrophobic residue) (10Trowbridge I.S.

This motif has been shown to interact with the μ2 subunit of the plasma membrane adaptor complex AP-2 (11Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyataki S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the NPF sequence near the C terminus of the cytoplasmic tail is a candidate to interact with the cytosolic protein Eps15, which binds NPF sequences by its EH (Eps homology) domain (12Salcini A.E. Confalonieri S. Doria M. Santolini E. Minenkova O. Cesareni G. Pellicci P.G. Di Fiore P.P. Genes Dev. 1997; 17: 2239-2249Crossref Scopus (281) Google Scholar). To study these potential interactions directly, various GST-UCE tail fusions (Fig. 4) were constructed and expressed and then tested for AP-2 and Eps15 binding using bovine adrenal cytosol as the source of AP-2 and Eps15 in pull-down assays. The GST-wild-type UCE-cytoplasmic tail displayed significant binding of both AP-2 and Eps15, whereas GST alone failed to bind either of the proteins (Fig. 5). The mutation of Tyr488 to alanine marked decreased AP-2 binding (10% WT) and also impaired Eps15 binding (44% WT). The Y486A mutation resulted in modest decreases in both AP-2 and Eps15 bindings (43 and 55% WT, respectively). The H510Stop fusion protein, which lacks the NPF motif, exhibited almost no binding of both Eps15 and AP-2 (<1% WT).Figure 5AP-2 and Eps15 interact with UCE wild-type cytoplasmic tail. GST-UCE-cytoplasmic tail fusion proteins, wild-type and mutant, as shown in Fig. 4 were used in pull-down experiments with cytosol from bovine adrenal glands. GST control consists of glutathione-Sepharose beads with only GST bound. Portions of the blot were probed with either anti-Eps15 rabbit antiserum or anti-α adaptin subunit of AP-2 monoclonal antibody 100/2.S, supernatant; P, bead pellet. The films were scanned as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the quantitation of the pellet bands from five separate experiments is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These results indicated that binding of the UCE-cytoplasmic tail to the μ2 subunit of AP-2 and Eps15 was synergistic in the pull-down assays. This might be expected, because Eps15 also binds to the appendage of the α subunit of AP-2 (13Benmerah A. Begue B. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf-Bensussan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12111-12116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). To further explore this possible synergy, two additional experiments were carried out. In the first experiment, Eps15 was depleted from the cytosol by adsorbing it on immobilized α appendage also referred to as the αC fragment (5Traub L.M. Downs M.A. Westrich J.L. Fremont D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8907-8912Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, this caused a marked decrease in the binding of AP-2 to GST-UCE (27% WT). In the second experiment, AP-2 was depleted from the cytosol by prior adsorption on immobilized anti-AP-2 antibody. Fig. 7shows that the depletion of the AP-2 was complete, and that the Eps15 was partially depleted perhaps by 2-fold, because it binds to AP-2 (see the intensity of the Eps15 in the supernatants). However, the interaction of GST-UCE wild-type with Eps15 was reduced to 23% of the amount bound in normal cytosol. These depletion experiments show that the binding of AP-2 and Eps15 to the cytoplasmic tail of UCE is synergistic under the conditions of the pull-down assays.Figure 7Depletion of AP-2 from cytosol decreases binding of Eps15 to GST-UCE-cytoplasmic tail fusion protein. AP-2 was depleted from bovine adrenal cytosol as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and varying amounts of depleted cytosol and normal cytosol were used in pull-down experiments. S,supernatant; P, bead pellet.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The GST fusion protein pull-down experiments indicate that UCE is internalized at the plasma membrane via AP-2 containing clathrin-coated vesicles. To directly test this notion, clathrin-coated vesicles were isolated from mouse L-cells, which express endogenous mouse UCE. After the second density gradient step as detailed under “Experimental Procedures,” aliquots of the fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE, blotted to nitrocellulose, and probed with antibodies to the clathrin heavy chain, AP-2, AP-1, the CI-MPR, and Golgi α-mannosidase II as shown in Fig.8. In addition, aliquots of the fractions were concentrated and assayed for UCE activity as well as subjected to SDS-PAGE, blotted, and probed with antibody to UCE. It can be seen in Fig. 8 that the clathrin-coated vesicles were mostly present in fractions 3–5, which stained for clathrin, AP-1, AP-2, and the CI-MPR, whereas the remnant of Golgi membranes not removed in the first gradient was concentrated in later fractions as shown by α-mannosidase II staining. Uncovering enzyme fractionated primarily with the clathrin-coated vesicles. The result confirms that endogenous UCE is packaged into clathrin-coated vesicles but cannot distinguish AP-2 clathrin-coated vesicles from AP-1 clathrin-coated vesicles. To explore the effects of the various cytoplasmic tail mutations on the intracellular localization of UCE, we turned to visualization of a variety of GFP-UCE-TM-cytoplasmic tail fusion proteins (Fig.9A). These GFP fusion proteins were transiently expressed in HeLa cells and localized by confocal imaging as shown in Fig. 9B. As previously reported, wild-type GFP-UCE is localized primarily in the TGN like the endogenous UCE (2Rohrer J. Kornfeld R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1623-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). GFP-UCE M494Stop was also concentrated in the TGN, whereas GFP-UCE Y488A/M494Stop showed heavy surface staining with residual labeling in the TGN. The"
