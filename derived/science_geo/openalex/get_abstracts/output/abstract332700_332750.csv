https://openalex.org/W2043331140,"Xanthotoxin, a linear furanocoumarin occurring in many plants of the family Umbelliferae, is not appreciably toxic to the umbellifer-feeding larvae of Papilio polyxenes (Lepidoptera; Papilionidae), whereas angelicin, an angular furanocoumarin found only in a few relatively advanced tribes of the Umbelliferae, reduces growth rate and fecundity. The biosynthetic pathway leading to angular attachment of the furan ring may thus have been a response within the Umbelliferae to selective pressures exerted by specialized herbivores that had adapted to feeding on linear furanocoumarins."
https://openalex.org/W1964044048,"The global tectonics of Venus differs significantly from that of Earth, most markedly in that the surface is covered predominately by gently rolling terrain; there apparently are no features like ocean rises; the gravity is positively correlated with topography at all wavelengths; and the few highlands are estimated to be supported or compensated at a depth of approximately 100 kilometers. The surface of Venus appears to be covered mainly by an ancient crust, the high surface temperature making subduction difficult. It seems likely that well over 1 billion years ago water was destabilized at the surface and, soon after, plate tectonics ceased. The highlands appear to be actively supported, presumably as manifestations of long-enduring hot spots."
https://openalex.org/W2089209090,"Fossil zooplankton fecal pellets found in thinly bedded marine and lacustrine black shales associated with phosphate, oil, and coal deposits, link the deposition of organic matter and biologically associated minerals with planktonic ecosystems. The black shales were probably formed in the anoxic basins of coastal marine waters, inland seas, and rift valley lakes where high productivity was supported by runoff, upwelling, and outwelling."
https://openalex.org/W1977331898,"Field experiments indicate that the use of off-road vehicles on arid land increases the amount and frequency of water runoff and erosion by decreasing soil porosity, infiltration capacity, effectiveness of surface stabilizers, and hydraulic resistance to overland flow. These effects are long-lived and may result even when the use of these vehicles is slight."
https://openalex.org/W2092911340,"Male Fowler's toads produce mating calls that are affected by the body size and temperature of the caller. Females are able to discriminate between variations in these calls and select the largest available males. By thermoregulation, males are able to alter their calls to make them more attractive to females."
https://openalex.org/W2057968487,"Some of the most important data on the effects of nuclear radiation on humans may be wrong, according to new research being done at the Lawrence Livermore Weapons Laboratory in California and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. The new findings are far from welcome, as one consultant in this work says, for all the revisions are moving in the wrong direction - a direction that will worry the advocates of nuclear power. Government physicists have recalculated the data on the radiation fields created by the atomic blasts at Hiroshima and Nagasaki and produced some unexpected results. Their statistics show that most of the cancer caused by those bombs came from low LET gamma rays, suggesting that this common type of radiation is more hazardous than had been assumed before."
https://openalex.org/W2024847125,"Federal regulation of automobile safety, emissions, and fuel economy is contradictory. Safety equipment and emissions control reduce fuel economy; reducing the size of automobiles is estimated to increase fatalities by 1400 a year and significantly increase serious injuries. These secondary impacts of regulation roughly double the estimated costs of achieving the individual goals. In formulating regulations, these contradictions must be taken into account, along with the effects on the price of the vehicle and its attractiveness to buyers."
