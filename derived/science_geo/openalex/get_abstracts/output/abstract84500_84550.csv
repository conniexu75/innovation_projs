https://openalex.org/W2003676968,"The cyc1-512 mutation is a 38 base pair deletion in the 3' nontranslated region of the CYC1 locus in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The deletion occurred between two 7 bp directly repeated sequences. The cyc1-512 mutant produces approximately 10% of the normal amount of the CYC1 gene product, iso-1-cytochrome c, and produces 5%--10% of the normal steady-state amount of CYC1 mRNA. Most of the mRNAs in cyc1-512 are longer at their 3' ends by up to 1000 nucleotides, suggesting that the 38 bp deletion in cyc1-512 prevents proper transcription termination. The improper transcription termination is shown to cause converging transcription between CYC1 and an adjacent gene. The fact that all of the aberrantly sized mRNAs in cyc1-512 are polyadenylated leads us to suggest that polyadenylation may be coupled to transcription termination in yeast. We have uncovered a consensus sequence between the region deleted in cyc1-512 and the 3' nontranslated regions of some but not all yeast genes, and discuss the possible role of this sequence in transcription termination."

https://openalex.org/W2085875002,"We constructed a cosmid library from BALB/c mouse sperm DNA and isolated 64 cosmid clones with cDNA probes for transplantation antigens (class I molecules). Of these clones, 54 mapped into 13 gene clusters containing 36 distinct class I genes and encompassing 837 kilobases of DNA. One gene cluster mapped to the L region and a second cluster with seven genes to the Qa-2,3 region of the major histocompatibility complex. Restriction map and Southern blot analyses suggest that there are subgroups of class I genes. Using a 5′ flanking sequence of the L gene as a hybridization probe, we show the L gene to be present in mouse strains expressing this antigen but deleted or mutated in strains failing to express it. Our data suggest that gene duplication and deletion presumably by homologous but unequal crossing-over has altered the size and organization of the class I clusters in different mouse strains and probably is an important mechanism for generating polymorphism in these genes. Analysis of the 36 class I genes with cDNA probes specific for the 5′ and 3′ ends shows that the exon encoding the third external domain is far more conserved than those encoding the first and second external domains of the transplantation antigen. These differences in variability have interesting functional implications."
https://openalex.org/W1983145743,"We have used a DNA-cellulose competitive binding assay to measure the extent of displacement of the chicken oviduct progesterone-receptor complex from calf thymus DNA-cellulose by purified cloned fragments of genomic DNA. Several DNA fragments from hormonally responsive genes coding for egg-white proteins were found to be efficient competitors for either crude or partially purified receptor complexes when compared with calf thymus DNA. Data obtained with deletion mutations constructed in vitro allowed delineation of a specific region necessary for strong competition, located 250–300 bp upstream from the mRNA startsite of the oval-bumin gene. Sequence homologies with this 5′-upstream region were observed in other fragments of the ovalbumin, conalbumin, ovomucoid, X and Y genes, which were also efficient competitors. Based on a comparison of such sequences of homology, a consensus sequence that may constitute a region binding progesterone-receptor complex has been constructed: ATCTTCCATTTATCTGTGTTGTA. The results suggest that specific double-stranded DNA sequences are recognized by. the oviduct progesterone-receptor complex in vitro, and are relevant to the question of whether specific DNA sequences are directly involved as genomic binding sites for steroid receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2141183114,"We have shown previously that alloxan and streptozotocin, two major diabetogenic agents, cause DNA strand breaks in rat pancreatic islets and stimulate nuclear poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase, thereby depleting intracellular NAD level and inhibiting proinsulin synthesis (Okamoto, H. (1981) Mol. Cell. Biochem. 37, 43-61; Yamamoto, H., Uchigata, Y., and Okamoto, H. (1981) Nature 294, 284-286). In the present study, superoxide dismutase and catalase, scavengers of radical oxygens, were found to protect against islet DNA strand breaks and inhibition of proinsulin synthesis induced by alloxan. The radical scavengers did not affect islet DNA strand breaks or inhibition of proinsulin synthesis induced by streptozotocin. On the other hand, compounds that inhibit islet nuclear poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase were found to protect against alloxan- as well as streptozotocin-induced inhibition of proinsulin synthesis. The poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase inhibitors were ineffective in protection against DNA strand breaks induced by the agents. These results may provide an important clue for elucidating the prevention of insulin-dependent diabetes as well as for understanding the cause of diabetes."

https://openalex.org/W2025842644,"The conformation and dynamics of the d(CGCGAATTCGCG) duplex, its analogs containing mismatched base pairs and helix interruptions, and its complexes with actinomycin and Netropsin, bound separately and simultaneously, have been investigated by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in aqueous solution. Structural information has been deduced from chemical shift and nuclear Overhauser effect parameters, while the kinetics have been probed from line width and saturation recovery experiments on proton and phosphorus markers at the individual base pair level. These studies lead to an improved understanding of the role of nucleic acid sequence on the structure, flexibility, and conformational interconversions in the duplex state. The nuclear magnetic resonance measurements readily identify helix modification and antibiotic binding sites on the nucleic acid and estimate the extent to which the observed conformational and dynamic perturbations are transmitted to adjacent base pair regions."
https://openalex.org/W1602588405,"Stimulation of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes with the chemotactic peptide formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine led to the formation of a novel leukotriene: 5(S),12(R)-dihydroxy-6,8,10,14-eicosatetraen-1,20-dioic acid. This dihydroxydicarboxylic acid is derived from omega-oxidation of 5(S),12(R),dihydroxy-6,8,10,14-eicosatetradienoic acid (leukotriene B4). The intermediate 5(S),12(R),20-trihydroxy-6,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid was also isolated from these incubations. The two metabolites of leukotriene B4 exhibit chemotactic properties for human polymorphonuclear leukocytes but are less active in this respect than the parent compound."
https://openalex.org/W1517264384,"We have developed a simple in vitro system for studying phosphorylation in isolated HeLa metaphase chromosomes which utilizes the endogenous protein kinase and phosphoprotein phosphatase activities in the chromosomes. Because the isolated chromosomes retain the specificity of phosphorylation seen in vivo, this system offers unique possibilities for studying the properties and regulation of the kinase and phosphatase by adding exogenous substances and observing their effects. It should also be useful for studying the sites of phosphorylation, since proteins can be more easily labeled to high specific activity with 32P in this system than in vivo. The pattern of proteins phosphorylated in isolated metaphase chromosomes appears to be nearly identical with the pattern found in vivo. Among the histones (H) only H1 and H3 are phosphorylated, but several nonhistone proteins, including high mobility group (HMG) 14, are also phosphorylated. Since HMG 14 has been implicated as a structural protein of actively transcribing chromatin, our results suggest that phosphorylation of chromatin proteins may be involved in the shutoff of transcription during mitosis. Tryptic peptide maps and analysis of the phosphorylated amino acids indicate that H1A, H1B, HMG 14, and H3 are phosphorylated at the same sites in vitro in metaphase chromosomes as in mitotic cells in vivo. The major site of phosphorylation of histone H3, both in vivo and in vitro, has been identified as serine 10. HMG 14 is phosphorylated both at serine and threonine residues."

https://openalex.org/W1973118582,The infrared spectrum of the purple membrane of Halobacterium halobium has amide I and amide A frequencies that are anomalously high for standard α-helical structures. Normal mode calculations indicate that these and other unusual features of the spectrum can be attributed to α11-helices. Such structures suggest that the helix backbone may provide the framework through which proton transport takes place.
https://openalex.org/W2172260025,"We have found that the uvrB gene of Escherichia coil is transcribed from at least two promoters, which we call P1 and P2. Transcription from P1 begins with an ATP at +1, and transcription from P2 begins primarily with a GTP at −31. A binding site for the lexA protein (LEXA), located between the −35 sequence and Pribnow box of P2, regulates transcription from this promoter. In vitro, LEXA inhibits transcription from P2 but has no detectable effect on transcription from P1. A third promoter, P3, was also detected at −341; transcription from P3 is toward uvrB but terminates in vitro in the region of the LEXA binding site. The binding of LEXA to P2 inhibits transcription from the P3 promoter even though several hundred nucleotides separate the two promoters. The data suggest that a transcribing RNA polymerase stalls when it reaches the repressor-operator complex but remains bound to the DNA, causing a jamming of RNA polymerases between P3 and the repressor-operator complex at P2. The physiological significance of P3 is unknown."
https://openalex.org/W1602988467,"The mechanism of electron transfer catalyzed by cytochrome oxidase was investigated by monitoring the reaction of cytochrome oxidase with cytochrome c under carefully controlled anaerobic conditions. The kinetics of the reaction were examined by varying conditions of ionic strength, inhibitor binding, and oxidation-reduction potential. An analogue of cytochrome c in which the iron atom was replaced with cobalt was used to probe the effect of redox potential on the reaction. Under conditions of low ionic strength, there is very rapid oxidation of cytochrome c and reduction of oxidase which occurs at a rate of 3 X 10(7) M-1 s-1. The number of electrons transferred exhibit a hyperbolic dependence on the concentration of cytochrome c reaching a maximum of 2 electrons transferred at the highest concentration of reduced cytochrome c employed. The total number of electrons transferred was always observed to be distributed equally between cytochrome a and a second acceptor which appears to be the associated copper center; electron transfer to cytochrome a3 did not occur in the absence of oxygen. Substitution of cytochrome c by the cobalt analogue (which represents a decrease in oxidation-reduction potential of about 400 mV) yielded identical results indicating that the origin of the lack of reactivity of cytochrome a3 is of a kinetic nature. The effect of increasing the ionic strength on the reaction was 2-fold: a marked decrease in reaction rate and the appearance of biphasic kinetics with the amplitude of the very fast absorbance changes at 605 nm decreasing from 80% to 40% of the total anticipated from static absorbance measurements. Each of the two phases accounted for a maximum of 1 electron at the highest ionic strength employed. These results are simulated in terms of a sample kinetic reaction scheme involving a two-step electron transfer at one binding site."

https://openalex.org/W1981436097,"Two populations of receptors for gamma-aminobutyric acid, one with low- and the other with high-affinity characteristics, are detectable in frozen, thawed, Triton-treated synaptic membrane preparations from normal brain. It is now reported that membrane preparations from rats with mild galactosamine-induced hepatic encephalopathy show an increase in the number of low- and high-affinity gamma-aminobutyric acid binding sites, whereas those from rats with severe encephalopathy show only high-affinity binding sites. Thus, hepatic encephalopathy appears to involve partial degeneration of the gamma-aminobutyric acid-containing presynaptic nerve terminals."

https://openalex.org/W2010109959,"A biochemically active conjugate of calmodulin and tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (CaM-RITC) was synthesized. When incubated with sections of chick lens, this conjugate bound to the surface membranes of lens fiber cells in the presence of absence of calcium. Incubation of lens sections with antibodies to gap junction protein of lens completely blocked the binding of the conjugate to cell membranes, whereas serum from nonimmunized animals or antibodies to other lens proteins reduced the binding only slightly. By means of a gel overlay procedure, 125I-labeled calmodulin was found to bind to the gap junction protein of lens, also in a calcium-independent manner. These results support the concept that calmodulin may interact with and regulate gap junctions in living cells."

https://openalex.org/W2035654064,"The reduced beta-globin synthesis characterizing the beta+ thalassemia phenotype has been shown to be caused by anomalous processing within the small intervening sequence (IVS1) of the beta-globin mRNA precursor. The beta-globin gene from such patients contains a single base substitution within IVS1, located 22 bp from the 3' junction between IVS1 and exon 2, creating an alternative splice site within IVS1 and resulting in retention of the 3'-terminal 19 bases of IVS1. We have identified this abnormally spliced mRNA in the reticulocyte RNA of two patients with beta+ thalassemia, by S1 nuclease mapping and primer-extension analysis. Moreover, a cloned beta+-thalassemic gene preferentially generated the anomalously spliced RNA when expressed in monkey kidney cells. The anomalously spliced RNA constituted approximately 80%--90%, and normal beta RNA approximately 10%--20%, of the total beta mRNA. In contrast, the small amount of beta mRNA present in reticulocytes from such patients consisted predominantly of normal beta mRNA. These results suggest that the reduced amount of normally functioning beta mRNA present in such patients results from preferential processing at the alternative splice site, with subsequent instability, reduced nuclear processing and/or inadequate cytoplasmic transport of the abnormal RNA species."
https://openalex.org/W2011596802,Adenosine receptors associated with a reduction of adenylate cyclase and labeled by tritium-labeled cyclohexyladenosine can be solubilized from brain membranes with sodium cholate. Regulation of receptor binding by guanine nucleotides is retained in the soluble state. Influences of cations observed in membrane preparations of adenosine receptors are no longer detected with the solubilized receptors. The apparent retention of a complex of receptors and guanosine triphosphate binding but not cation binding protein in the soluble state may permit a molecular analysis of receptor regulation.
https://openalex.org/W2065220425,"Administration of a potent gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist [Nac-L-Ala1,pCl-D-Phe2,D-Trp3,6]GnRH as a single subcutaneous injection to castrated adult male rats reduced, by more than 90 percent, both serum luteinizing hormone concentrations and specific pituitary GnRH receptor binding. This effect persisted for 24 hours. The dissociation rate of the antagonist from pituitary membrane homogenates was fourfold slower than the dissociation rate of a potent agonist. The prolonged in vivo inhibition of pituitary GnRH receptor binding and luteinizing hormone secretion by the GnRH antagonist may be mediated by the slower dissociation rate of the antagonist from its specific pituitary membrane receptor site."

Naloxone promptly antagonized this effect of the opiates but not that of clonidine which was reversed by alpha 2-adrenergic receptor antagonists. The independent depression of preganglionic neurons by clonidine may contribute to the ability of this drug to depress the symptoms of opiate withdrawal that are characterized by sympathetic hyperactivity."
https://openalex.org/W2045643952,"Photoreceptors of the vertebrate retina hyperpolarize in response to light. The hyperpolarization elicited by a brief flash is approximately ten times slower in rods than in cones of the same retina1. We have examined the amplification and temporal properties of synaptic transfer of rod and cone signals to a common postsynaptic element, the horizontal cell. We find that the kinetics of signal transfer at these chemical synapses parallels the speed of the light-evoked signals themselves."

https://openalex.org/W1493846119,"The relative stability of the cruciform state at the large inverted repeat of plasmid pVH51 is measured. At physiological superhelical densities, the cruciform state is present in a high percentage of the plasmid molecules. Investigation of the relationship between negative superhelical density and cruciform prevalence reveals a sharp transition from an undetectable level to a relatively stable state. This transition occurs over the negative superhelical density range of 0.046 to 0.066. Estimates of the free energy contribution to cruciform formation resulting from loss of negative superhelical turns suggest that about 22 kcal/mol are required to generate the cruciform structure at this site in pVH51."
https://openalex.org/W1642286861,"An H+/ATP ratio of 2 for H+ transport was determined from initial rate measurements at pH 6.1 in a purified gastric microsomal fraction containing the [H,K]ATPase. This ratio was independent of external KCl, though the apparent K0.5 for ATP was increased from 10.78 +/- 0.51 (n = 3) to 64.6 +/- 11.9 (n = 3) microM ATP and from 5.13 +/- 0.64 (n = 3) to 65.2 +/- 0.64 (n = 3) microM ATP for H+ transport and the K+-stimulated ATPase, respectively, as K+external was increased from 12 to 150 mM. The H+/ATP ratio was also relatively independent of ATP concentration. Maximum initial rates obtained in KCl-equilibrated vesicles were independent of added valinomycin, though net H+ transport was increased 29.3 +/- 1.03% (n = 6) by the addition of ionophore. Maximum net H+ transport in this vesicle preparation was 185 +/- 2.1 (n = 14) nmol mg-1 of protein. Initial rate measurements of ATPase represent a burst of K+-dependent activity of approximately 10-15 s duration. The H+/ATP stoichiometry was calculated based on the K+-stimulated component of hydrolysis. Under most conditions, the Mg2+-dependent component of hydrolysis was less than 10% of the (Mg2+ + K+) component of hydrolysis."

https://openalex.org/W1517499104,"The dose-response characteristics of the neutrophil 3-3'-dipentyloxacarbocyanine (di-O-C5(3)) fluorescence response to repetitive stimulation with the chemoattractant N-formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine (fMet-Leu-Phe) were studied. Neutrophils exposed to the chemoattractant fMet-Leu-Phe at less than 5 X 10(-8) M subsequently responded only to higher concentrations of fMet-Leu-Phe. This stimulus-induced modification of neutrophil responsiveness involved a reversible fMet-Leu-Phe-induced shift in response Km (the concentration of fMet-Leu-Phe producing a half-maximal response) to higher values which occurred 1 to 2 min after exposure to fMet-Leu-Phe and represented a form of adaptation. A Hill coefficient of 0.68 +/- 0.07 was determined from analysis of the data indicating that the di-O-C5(3) fluorescence response behavior is compatible with functional negatively cooperative interaction and/or heterogeneity of fMet-Leu-Phe receptors. In related studies, analysis of the binding of fMet-Leu-[3H]Phe to intact cells and cell-free plasma membrane preparations resulted in Hill coefficients of 0.64 +/- 0.06 and 0.69 +/- 0.07, respectively, indicating that fMet-Leu-Phe binding exhibits properties similar to the fMet-Leu-Phe-elicited di-O-C5(3) fluorescence response. Modulation of receptor affinity, through either negative cooperativity or changing populations of heterogeneous receptors, may be an important mechanism by which neutrophils adapt and respond to a gradient of chemoattractant during the process of chemotaxis."
https://openalex.org/W1517509499,"The hepatocyte asialoglycoprotein receptor is able to mediate the internalization of ligand in buffer devoid of Na+ but containing 0.15 M K+. Under these conditions, degradation of internalized ligand does not occur due to an inability to deliver the ligand to lysosomes. Instead, the ligand becomes localized in a vesicle with the same density as plasma membrane on Percoll gradients. This vesicle may be the functional equivalent of the uncoated vesicles observed by electron microscopy. Internalization of more than 20 glycoprotein molecules/high affinity surface receptor was observed under these conditions, indicating that delivery of ligand to lysosomes is not necessary for receptor reutilization."
https://openalex.org/W2000764465,"The amplification of ribosomal DNA during development of the somatic macronucleus in Tetrahymena thermophila was analyzed by genetic and molecular biological techniques. We have identified an alternate form of the rDNA, structurally distinguishable from the wild-type by an extra cutting site for Bam HI in its nontranscribed spacer. The altered rDNA was inherited in crosses in a simple Mendelian fashion, consistent with the presence of only one rRNA gene copy per haploid genome in the micronucleus. We therefore define a locus for the rRNA structural gene, the rdnA locus, with the allele determining the alternate form designated rdnA1. In over 95% of T. thermophila clones heterozygous for the rdnA locus in the micronucleus (rdnA1/rdn+), the macronucleus, which develops from a division product of this micronucleus, contained almost exclusively rdnA1-type amplified palindromic rDNA molecules. The rdnA1 allele is thus almost always dominant over the rdn+ allele with respect to amplification. This genetic variant of the rdnA locus was used to show that the single, free, nonpalindromic rRNA genes, which are synthesized during rDNA amplification, are derived from micronuclear gene copies from both chromosomal homologs. We therefore conclude that in these heterozygotes, selective amplification of the rdnA1 allele is not caused by the production of only one type of free, single rRNA gene during amplification."
https://openalex.org/W1985770805,"Nucleoprotein complexes with in vitro transcription activity were isolated from HeLa cells late in lytic infection with Adenovirus type 2 (Ad2). Both polymerase II and polymerase III were active in these extracts, and greater than 85% of the labeled RNA was Ad2-specific. Electrophoretic analyses and Southern blot analyses demonstrated that RNA complementary to the entire 30 kb late transcription unit including RNA near the presumed termination site was synthesized. The addition of DRB (5,6,dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-benzimidazole) in vivo prior to the isolation of the complexes resulted in accumulation of polymerase II at the promoter proximal sites, but nascent chains started in vivo in DRB were successfully elongated in vitro. Approximately 10% of the RNA labeled in vitro contained poly(A), and the length of poly(A) was very similar to that of nuclear RNA isolated from Ad2-infected cells. The in vitro sites of poly(A) addition were specific--labeled poly(A)-terminated RNA molecules ended at a point on the genome coincident with previously mapped poly(A) sites of mRNAs produced in vivo. In addition, the polyadenylation enzyme (or enzymes) cosediment with the nucleoprotein complexes during sucrose gradient centrifugation since gradient purified complexes synthesize poly(A) containing RNA in vitro in the absence of any added nuclear extract."
https://openalex.org/W1521289696,"A hypothetical model of the cytochrome c peroxidase.cytochrome c complex (Poulos, T. L., and Kraut, J. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 10322-10330) predicts charge interactions between aspartic acid residues of the peroxidase having a spatial distribution that is complementary to the distribution of essential and highly conserved residues of cytochrome c. In a first attempt to test this model, carboxyl groups of cytochrome c peroxidase have been modified with a water-soluble carbodiimide, either alone or in combination with a nucleophile. Modification led to the loss of up to 90% of the ferrocytochrome c peroxidase activity. At least 4-5 carboxyl groups out of a total of 48, but none of the heme carboxyls, were modified in a derivative with 14% residual activity. In the peroxidase.cytochrome c complex the rate of peroxidase inactivation is slowed and approximately 2 carboxyl groups are protected from chemical modification. In the presence of the carbodiimide, cytochrome c and peroxidase were cross-linked to form a covalent 1:1 complex and the linkage sites were preliminarily characterized. Cross-linking occurred to carboxyl groups of the NH2-terminal fragment 1-119 and of fragment 172-229. The four crucial aspartates of the hypothetical model are located in these same two sequence regions."
https://openalex.org/W1504662341,"Protein n, essential in forming the primosome for the in vitro conversion of phi X174 single-stranded (SS) DNA to the duplex replicative form (RF), has been purified about 5000-fold to near homogeneity from Escherichia coli. Protein n is heat- and acid-resistant and N-ethyl-maleimide-sensitive. It appears to be a dimer of 12,000 (+/- 2000)-dalton polypeptides. About 80 molecules of protein n are present/cell. Protein n binding to phi X SS DNA depends on the presence of single-strand binding protein (SSB). This requirement for SSB reflects a direct interaction of protein n and SSB. About 30 protein n monomers can be bound to an SSB-coated circle. However, in forming the primosome on an SSB-coated phi X circle, an input of only 2-3 protein n monomers is required and 1 monomer bound/circle. Retention of this low level of protein n on SSB-coated phi X SS DNA is dependent upon protein n', a DNA-dependent ATPase (dATPase) that guides primosome assembly. This single protein n monomer is retained in the assembled primosome, which is conserved on the completed parental RF and participates in the next stage of the replicative cycle, production of progeny RF."

https://openalex.org/W1580158729,"The biosynthesis of myeloperoxidase was studied in human myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells. Cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine and cell extracts were treated with anti-myeloperoxidase serum. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In a 1-h pulse, only two immunoreactive polypeptides of Mr 89,000 and 81,000 were labeled. During subsequent chase, the amounts of these polypeptides decreased with concomitant appearance of polypeptides of Mr 59,500 and 14,700, corresponding to the two chains of myeloperoxidase. Immunoprecipitation of all these polypeptides was prevented by adding excess myeloperoxidase. These results suggest that the Mr 89,000 and 81,000 polypeptides are precursors of myeloperoxidase. The precursors were present only in the soluble fraction of the cells, but the matured polypeptide chains were found in both the soluble and granule fraction after 17-h chase.

Amino acid sequence studies have revealed an extensive divergence (22%--33%) in the alternative forms of the kappa constant region (b4, b5, b6 and b9). Furthermore, independent studies have shown that a rabbit could express a wrong allotype. To assess the hypothesis that b allotypes are encoded by duplicated genes with a polymorphic control mechanism, we have analyzed the DNAs of four different homozygous rabbits using the Southern blot hybridization technique, with a cloned b4 C kappa probe. DNAs of individual b4, b5, b6 and b9 rabbits were cleaved with Eco RI, Kpn I and Pst I restriction endonucleases. Comparative analysis of restriction patterns shows that all four rabbit DNAs contain multiple DNA fragments hybridizing with the probe under low- and high-stringency washing conditions. In addition, each restriction pattern is distinct, suggesting that the C kappa genes are organized differently in animals expressing different allotypes."
https://openalex.org/W1494195428,"Incubation of crude extracts from cells lytically infected with polyoma virus in the presence of periodate-oxidized [alpha-32P]ATP led to the radioactive labeling of one main polypeptide immunoprecipitated by anti-T antigen antibodies. It was absent from extracts of mock-infected cells and exhibited an apparent Mr value of 105,000, identical with that of the large-T viral protein. This polypeptide was unambiguously identified as large-T on the basis of the heat sensitivity of the in vitro labeling in extracts from cells infected with a tsa mutant. The amount of incorporated radioactivity was found to increase linearly with that of infected cell extract and with the incubation time. Labeling resulted from the specific binding of an oxidized ATP molecule to a nucleotide binding site of the large-T protein, since it was efficiently completed by unlabeled ATP. Study of the dependence on the concentration of oxidized ATP evidenced a first order kinetic for the labeling reaction. Similar results were obtained for the large-T protein of SV40 virus."

https://openalex.org/W2014414068,"Lambda bacteriophages grown on arl mutants of Escherichia coli (""Arl-"" phages) display intermediate levels of cytosine methylation: less 5-methylcytosine (m5C) than phages grown on wild-type bacteria (""Arl+"" phages) but more than phages grown on dcm mutants, and thus lacking the methylated sequences (Cm5CATGG) characteristic of E. coli K-12 bacteria (""Dcm-"" phages). ""Arl-"" phages are one twelfth as resistant to Eco RII restriction (recognition site CCATGG) as ""Arl+"" phages, but 40-fold more resistant than ""Dcm-"" phages. Chromatographic analyses show the 5-methylcytosine content of ""Arl-"" DNA to be one third that of ""Arl+"" DNA. Altered cytosine methylation frequency correlates with two previously described properties of ""Arl-"" phages, increased genetic recombination and unusual sensitivity of phage DNA to endonuclease S1, which are absent in phages grown on dcm or dcm arl bacteria. Methylated/unmethylated heteroduplex DNA prepared in vitro (one strand from Eco RII-modified phages/one from ""Dcm-"" phages) is highly recombinogenic but not S1-sensitive. We hypothesize that hemimethylated CCATGG sites in ""Arl-"" DNA are necessary and sufficient for enhanced recombination, and necessary but not sufficient for S1 sensitivity."

Although purified approximately 2000-fold, the exact chemical nature of the follicle-stimulating hormone binding inhibitor is as yet uncertain. However, a variety of analytical procedures indicated it to be separate and distinct from the lutropin binding stimulator, to have a molecular weight of about 700, and to contain a peptide component. Available evidence suggests that the serum factor responsible for luteinizing hormone binding stimulation may be calcium."
https://openalex.org/W1537704738,"This study reports on various parameters which affect the binding stoichiometry for complexes of bacteriophage T4 gene 32 protein (P32) and single stranded polynucleotides (determined by UV absorbance and fluorescence quenching) and presents results of a quantitative electron spin resonance assay to determine physiologically effective binding affinity differences of nucleic acid binding proteins. The assay employs macromolecular spin probes (spin-labeled nucleic acids) which are used to determine the fraction of saturation in competition experiments with unlabeled nucleic acids. It was found that the fraction of complexed spin-labeled polynucleotides can be directly monitored by ESR with a two-component analysis approach when ligands such as poly(L-lysine), gene 5 protein (P5) of filamentous bacteriophage fd, and gene 32 protein (P32) of bacteriophage T4 are used. The ESR data unequivocally show that: 1) the binding stoichiometry for poly(L-lysine), P5 and P32 is nucleotide/lysine, 4 nucleotides/P5 monomer, and 10 nucleotides/P32 monomer, respectively; and 2) under physiologically relevant buffer conditions the relative affinity of P32 in the cooperative binding mode for polythymidylic acid is about 4 times greater than for polydeoxyinosinic acid and about 12 times greater than for polyinosinic acid, and the relative affinity of P32 for polydeoxyinosinic acid is about 3 times greater than for polyinosinic acid."

The high activity level was reversed by vasopressin treatment. Conversely, angiotensin-converting enzyme activity was significantly lower in the anterior pituitary of Brattleboro rats than in Long-Evans rats, and this activity level was not affected by vasopressin. these findings suggest an inverse relation between vasopressin and angiotensin systems in the posterior and intermediate lobes of the pituitary gland."
https://openalex.org/W1541440016,"Acute starvation of mammalian cells for amino acids results in translational errors that may be detected by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Using this as an assay for error frequency in mammalian cells, we investigated the hypothesis that neoplastic transformation was associated with an increased error frequency which in turn leads to an increased mutation rate and a decreased efficiency of regulatory controls (phenomena of tumor progression). Although we found that transformation was not always associated with an increased level of mistranslation we showed that SV40 transformation increased the level of translational errors in all cell types tested."
