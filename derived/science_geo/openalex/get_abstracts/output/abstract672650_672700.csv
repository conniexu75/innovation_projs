https://openalex.org/W3156664941,"Face masks became the symbol of the global fight against the coronavirus. While face masks’ medical benefits are clear, little is known about their psychological consequences. Drawing on theories of the social functions of emotions and rapid trait impressions, we tested hypotheses on face masks’ effects on emotion-recognition accuracy and social judgments (perceived trustworthiness, likability, and closeness). Our preregistered study with 191 German adults revealed that face masks diminish people’s ability to accurately categorize an emotion expression and make target persons appear less close. Exploratory analyses further revealed that face masks buffered the negative effect of negative (vs. non-negative) emotion expressions on perceptions of trustworthiness, likability, and closeness. Associating face masks with the coronavirus’ dangers predicted higher perceptions of closeness for masked but not for unmasked faces. By highlighting face masks’ effects on social functioning, our findings inform policymaking and point at contexts where alternatives to face masks are needed."
https://openalex.org/W3153211625,"Background Anemia is a major public health problem affecting more than half of children under the age of five globally. It has serious short- and long-term consequences including growth retardation, impaired motor and cognitive development, and increased morbidity and mortality. Despite anemia is the leading cause of child mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, there is limited evidence on the prevalence and determinants of anemia among under-five children in sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the prevalence and determinants of severity levels of anemia among children aged 6–59 months in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods This study was based on the most recent Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data of 32 sub-Saharan African countries. A total weighted sample of 135,619 children aged 6–59 months was included in the study. Considering the hierarchical nature of DHS data and the ordinal nature of anemia, a multilevel ordinal logistic regression model was applied. Proportional odds assumption was tested by Brant test and it was satisfied (p-value = 0.091). Besides, deviance was used for model comparison. Variables with a p-value ≤0.2 in the bivariable analysis were considered for the multivariable analysis. In the multivariable multilevel proportional odds model, the Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI) were reported for potential determinant factors of severity levels of anemia. Results The overall prevalence of anemia among children aged 6–59 months in sub-Saharan Africa was 64.1% [95% CI: 63.9%, 64.4%]. Of which, 26.2% were mildly anemic, 34.9% moderately anemic and 3% severely anemic. Poor maternal education, lower household wealth status, large family size, being male child, multiple births, having fever in the last two weeks, having diarrhea in the last two weeks, higher-order birth, maternal anemia, underweight, wasted, and stunted were significantly associated with increased odds of higher levels of anemia. Whereas, being 24–59 months age, taking drugs for an intestinal parasite, and born from mothers aged ≥ 20 years were significantly associated with lower odds of higher levels of anemia. Conclusion Severity levels of anemia among children aged 6–59 months in sub-Saharan Africa was a major public health problem. Enhancing maternal education, providing drugs for an intestinal parasite, designing interventions that address maternal anemia, febrile illness, and diarrheal disease, and strengthening the economic status of the family are recommended to reduce childhood anemia. Furthermore, it is better to strengthen the strategies of early detection and management of stunted, wasted, and underweight children to decrease childhood anemia."
https://openalex.org/W3155994952,"The impact of sex and menopausal status in Alzheimer’s disease remains understudied despite increasing evidence of greater female risk, particularly in APOE4 carriers. Utilizing female APOE-TR mice maintained on a high-fat diet background we induced ovarian failure through repeated VCD injections, to mimic human menopause. At 12 months of age, recognition memory and spatial memory were assessed using object recognition, Y-maze spontaneous alternation, and Barnes maze. A VCD*genotype interaction reduced the recognition memory (P < .05), with APOE4 VCD-treated animals unable to distinguish between novel and familiar objects. APOE4 mice displayed an additional 37% and 12% reduction in Barnes (P < .01) and Y-maze (P < .01) performance, indicative of genotype-specific spatial memory impairment. Molecular analysis indicated both VCD and genotype-related deficits in synaptic plasticity with BDNF, Akt, mTOR, and ERK signaling compromised. Subsequent reductions in the transcription factors Creb1 and Atf4 were also evident. Furthermore, the VCD*genotype interaction specifically diminished Ephb2 expression, while Fos, and Cnr1 expression reduced as a consequence of APOE4 genotype. Brain DHA levels were 13% lower in VCD-treated animals independent of genotype. Consistent with this, we detected alterations in the expression of the DHA transporters Acsl6 and Fatp4. Our results indicate that the combination of ovarian failure and APOE4 leads to an exacerbation of cognitive and neurological deficits."
https://openalex.org/W3155524240,"Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) may positively or negatively impact outcomes in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We investigated the association of ARB or ACEI use with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related outcomes in US Veterans with treated hypertension using an active comparator design, appropriate covariate adjustment, and negative control analyses.In this retrospective cohort study of Veterans with treated hypertension in the Veterans Health Administration (01/19/2020-08/28/2020), we compared users of (A) ARB/ACEI vs. non-ARB/ACEI (excluding Veterans with compelling indications to reduce confounding by indication) and (B) ARB vs. ACEI among (1) SARS-CoV-2+ outpatients and (2) COVID-19 hospitalized inpatients. The primary outcome was all-cause hospitalization or mortality (outpatients) and all-cause mortality (inpatients). We estimated hazard ratios (HR) using propensity score-weighted Cox regression. Baseline characteristics were well-balanced between exposure groups after weighting. Among outpatients, there were 5.0 and 6.0 primary outcomes per 100 person-months for ARB/ACEI (n = 2,482) vs. non-ARB/ACEI (n = 2,487) users (HR 0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.73-0.99, median follow-up 87 days). Among outpatients who were ARB (n = 4,877) vs. ACEI (n = 8,704) users, there were 13.2 and 14.8 primary outcomes per 100 person-months (HR 0.91, 95%CI 0.86-0.97, median follow-up 85 days). Among inpatients who were ARB/ACEI (n = 210) vs. non-ARB/ACEI (n = 275) users, there were 3.4 and 2.0 all-cause deaths per 100 person months (HR 1.25, 95%CI 0.30-5.13, median follow-up 30 days). Among inpatients, ARB (n = 1,164) and ACEI (n = 2,014) users had 21.0 vs. 17.7 all-cause deaths, per 100 person-months (HR 1.13, 95%CI 0.93-1.38, median follow-up 30 days).This observational analysis supports continued ARB or ACEI use for patients already using these medications before SARS-CoV-2 infection. The novel beneficial association observed among outpatients between users of ARBs vs. ACEIs on hospitalization or mortality should be confirmed with randomized trials."
https://openalex.org/W3155833069,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) causes bone loss, particularly in cortical bone, through formation of cortical pores which lead to skeletal fragility. Animal models of CKD have shown variability in the skeletal response to CKD between males and females suggesting sex may play a role in this variation. Our aim was to compare the impact of adenine-induced CKD on cortical parameters in skeletally mature male and female C57Bl/6 mice. After 10-weeks of adenine-induced CKD, both male and female adenine mice had high serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), high bone turnover, and cortical porosity compared to non-CKD controls. Both sexes had lower cortical thickness, but only male mice had lower cortical bone area. CKD imparted greater deficits in mechanical properties of male mice compared to female mice. These data demonstrate that both male and female mice develop high PTH/high bone turnover in response to adenine-induced CKD and that cortical bone phenotypes are slightly more severe in males, particularly in mechanical properties deficits."
https://openalex.org/W3155652465,"Following recent findings linking the human gut microbiota to gastrointestinal cancer and its treatment, the plausible relationship between lung microbiota and pulmonary cancer is explored. This study aims at characterizing the intratumoral and adjacent healthy tissue microbiota by applying a 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing protocol to tissue samples of 29 non-small cancer patients. Emphasis was put on contaminant management and a comprehensive comparison of bacterial composition between cancerous and healthy adjacent tissues of lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma is provided. A variable degree of similarity between the two tissues of a same patient was observed. Each patient seems to possess its own bacterial signature. The two types of cancer tissue do not have a distinct bacterial profile that is shared by every patient. In addition, enteric, potentially pathogenic and pro-inflammatory bacteria were more frequently found in cancer than healthy tissue. This work brings insights into the dynamic of bacterial communities in lung cancer and provides prospective data for more targeted studies."
https://openalex.org/W3152955310,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is emerging as a leading cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. Despite intensive nonclinical and clinical research in this field, no specific pharmacological therapy is currently approved to treat NAFLD, which has been recognized as one of the major unmet medical needs of the 21st century. Our recent studies have identified STE20-type kinase MST3, which localizes to intracellular lipid droplets, as a critical regulator of ectopic fat accumulation in human hepatocytes. Here, we explored whether treatment with Mst3-targeting antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) can promote hepatic lipid clearance and mitigate NAFLD progression in mice in the context of obesity. We found that administration of Mst3-targeting ASOs in mice effectively ameliorated the full spectrum of high-fat diet-induced NAFLD including liver steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and hepatocellular damage. Mechanistically, Mst3 ASOs suppressed lipogenic gene expression, as well as acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) protein abundance, and substantially reduced lipotoxicity-mediated oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress in the livers of obese mice. Furthermore, we found that MST3 protein levels correlated positively with the severity of NAFLD in human liver biopsies. In summary, this study provides the first in vivo evidence that antagonizing MST3 signaling is sufficient to mitigate NAFLD progression in conditions of excess dietary fuels and warrants future investigations to assess whether MST3 inhibitors may provide a new strategy for the treatment of patients with NAFLD."
https://openalex.org/W3155597364,"This study was conducted to investigate the effect of biofertilizers on the structure and diversity of the rhizosphere bacterial community of maize. Different biofertilizers were applied to maize. The physical and chemical properties of rhizosphere soil samples were analyzed and the rhizosphere bacteria were analyzed by 16S amplicon sequencing. The results showed that treatment with Bacillus licheniformis and B . amyloliquefaciens as biofertilizers increased the soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen, total phosphorus (TP), available phosphorus (AP), and available potassium (AK) contents, indicating that the plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria in the biofertilizers might help the host plant to produce root exudates that, in return, recruit beneficial communities due to available sugars, amino acids, organic acids, vitamins, and polymers. The rhizosphere of maize treated with B . subtilis biofertilizer had the highest diversity and richness. However, the rhizosphere treated with the combined bacterial strains had the lowest diversity and richness, which might be due to the directional increase of the abundance of some bacteria with special functions, but the decrease of the overall bacterial community diversity in the soil. The dominant bacterial phyla were Proteobacteria (32.2%–34.6%), Acidobacteria (15.0%–21.0%), Actinobacteria (13.1%–17.2%), and Gemmatimonadetes (9.0%–10.8%), and the dominant bacterial species were Aciditerrimonas ferrireducens JCM 15389 (4.3%–5.2%), Gemmatimonas aurantiaca (3.2%–4.1%), and Pyrinomonas methylaliphatogenes (2.1%–4.8%). The significantly enriched bacterial functions were associated with amino acid metabolism, sugar metabolism, and energy metabolism pathways. The results of a redundancy analysis showed that SOM, TP, and AK were the main factors affecting the microbial community structure in the maize rhizosphere. In conclusion, the application of biofertilizers increased the diversity and richness of the bacterial community in the maize rhizosphere soil. However, combined strain treatment was failed and not an ideal strategy due to the lowest abundance and diversity."
https://openalex.org/W3155480210,"Zika virus is a Flavivirus, transmitted via Aedes mosquitos, that causes a range of symptoms including Zika congenital syndrome. Zika has posed a challenging situation for health, public and economic sectors of affected countries. To quantitate Zika virus neutralizing antibody titers in serum samples, we developed a high throughput plate based Zika virus reporter virus particle (RVP) assay that uses an infective, non-replicating particle encoding Zika virus surface proteins and capsid (CprME) and a reporter gene ( Renilla luciferase). This is the first characterization of a Zika virus RVP assay in 384-well format using a Dengue replicon Renilla reporter construct. Serially diluted test sera were incubated with RVPs, followed by incubation with Vero cells. RVPs that have not been neutralized by antibodies in the test sera entered the cells and expressed Renilla luciferase. Quantitative measurements of neutralizing activity were determined using a plate-based assay and commercially available substrate. The principle of limiting the infection to a single round increases the precision of the assay measurements. RVP log 10 EC 50 titers correlated closely with titers determined using a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) (R 2 &gt;95%). The plate-based Zika virus RVP assay also demonstrated high levels of precision, reproducibility and throughput. The assay employs identical reagents for human, rhesus macaque and mouse serum matrices. Spiking studies indicated that the assay performs equally well in different species, producing comparable titers irrespective of the serum species. The assay is conducted in 384-well plates and can be automated to simultaneously achieve high throughput and high reproducibility."
https://openalex.org/W3155155916,"Gut microbiota is known to influence the host’s health; an imbalance of the gut microbial community leads to various intestinal and non-intestinal diseases. Research on gut microbes of endangered birds is vital for their conservation. However, a thorough understanding of the gut microbiome composition present in crested ibises at different ages and its correlation with crested ibis reproductive capacity has remained elusive. Here, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to explore the fecal microbial structure of nestlings and adult birds, and the difference in gut microbiota between healthy and sterile crested ibises. We observed that (1) bacterial microbiota, alpha and beta diversity of one-day-old nestlings significantly distinguished from other nestlings; abundance of Proteobacteria decreased, while that of Fusobacteria increased with an increase in the age of the nestlings; (2) there was no significant difference in community composition among adult crested ibises aged one, two, three, and five years; (3) the abundance of Proteobacteria and alpha diversity indices were higher in sterile crested ibises than in healthy crested ibises; thus, Proteobacteria can act as a diagnostic biomarker of reproductive dysfunction in crested ibises. This study significantly contributes to the field of ecology and conservation, as it provides a platform for assessing the reproductive capacity of endangered crested ibises, based on the gut microbiota composition. Further studies may unravel additional factors influencing crested ibises’ reproductive health, which will further help the management and control of the crested ibis population."
https://openalex.org/W3155767536,"Background and objectives Human papillomavirus (HPV)-driven oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is increasing globally. In Taiwan, HPV-positive OPSCC is obscured by tobacco, alcohol, and betel quid use. We investigated the role of high-risk HPV (hrHPV) in a large retrospective Taiwan OPSCC cohort. Methods and results The cohort of 541 OPSCCs treated at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital from 1998–2016 consisted of 507 men (94%) and 34 women (6%). Most used tobacco (81%), alcohol (51%), and betel quid (65%). Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue was used for p16 staining (a surrogate marker for HPV) and testing for HPV DNA presence and type by Multiplex HPV PCR-MassArray. HPV DNA and/or p16 staining (HPV-positive) was found in 28.4% (150/528) tumors. p16 and HPV DNA were strongly correlated ( F &lt; 0.0001). HPV16 was present in 82.8%, and HPV58 in 7.5% of HPV-positive tumors. HPV was associated with higher age (55.5 vs. 52.7 years, p = 0.004), lower T-stage ( p = 0.008) better overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio [HR] 0.58 [95% CI 0.42–0.81], p = 0.001), and disease-free survival (DFS) (HR 0.54 [95% CI 0.40–0.73], p &lt; 0.0001). Alcohol was strongly associated with recurrence and death (OS: HR 2.06 [95% CI 1.54–2.74], p &lt; 0.0001; DFS: HR 1.72 [95% CI 1.33–2.24], p &lt; 0.0001). OS and DFS in HPV-positive cases decreased for alcohol users ( p &lt; 0.0001). Obscured by the strong alcohol effect, predictive associations were not found for tobacco or betel quid. Conclusions As with HPV-positive OPSCC globally, HPV is an increasingly important etiological factor in Taiwanese OPSCC. HPV-positive OPSCC has considerable survival benefit, but this is reduced by alcohol, tobacco, and betel quid use. hrHPV is a cancer risk factor in males and females. Vaccinating both sexes with a multivalent vaccine including HPV58, combined with alcohol and tobacco cessation policies will be effective cancer-prevention public health strategies in Taiwan."
https://openalex.org/W3156836010,"Thyroid hormones regulate adult metabolism partly through actions on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). They also affect neurological development of the brain, but their role in cerebral OXPHOS before birth remains largely unknown, despite the increase in cerebral energy demand during the neonatal period. Thus, this study examined prepartum development of cerebral OXPHOS in hypothyroid fetal sheep. Using respirometry, Complex I (CI), Complex II (CII), and combined CI&CII OXPHOS capacity were measured in the fetal cerebellum and cortex at 128 and 142 days of gestational age (dGA) after surgical thyroidectomy or sham operation at 105 dGA (term ~145 dGA). Mitochondrial electron transfer system (ETS) complexes, mRNA transcripts related to mitochondrial biogenesis and ATP production, and mitochondrial density were quantified using molecular techniques. Cerebral morphology was assessed by immunohistochemistry and stereology. In the cortex, hypothyroidism reduced CI-linked respiration and CI abundance at 128 dGA and 142 dGA, respectively, and caused upregulation of PGC1α (regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis) and thyroid hormone receptor β at 128 dGA and 142 dGA, respectively. In contrast, in the cerebellum, hypothyroidism reduced CI&II- and CII-linked respiration at 128 dGA, with no significant effect on the ETS complexes. In addition, cerebellar glucocorticoid hormone receptor and adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT1) were downregulated at 128 dGA and 142 dGA, respectively. These alterations in mitochondrial function were accompanied by reduced myelination. The findings demonstrate the importance of thyroid hormones in the prepartum maturation of cerebral mitochondria and have implications for the etiology and treatment of the neurodevelopmental abnormalities associated with human prematurity and congenital hypothyroidism."
https://openalex.org/W3156620872,"Purpose To examine whether data sourced from electronic medical records (EMR) and a large industrial spectacle lens manufacturing database can estimate refractive error distribution within large populations as an alternative to typical population surveys of refractive error. Subjects A total of 555,528 patient visits from 28 Irish primary care optometry practices between the years 1980 and 2019 and 141,547,436 spectacle lens sales records from an international European lens manufacturer between the years 1998 and 2016. Methods Anonymized EMR data included demographic, refractive and visual acuity values. Anonymized spectacle lens data included refractive data. Spectacle lens data was separated into lenses containing an addition (ADD) and those without an addition (SV). The proportions of refractive errors from the EMR data and ADD lenses were compared to published results from the European Eye Epidemiology (E3) Consortium and the Gutenberg Health Study (GHS). Results Age and gender matched proportions of refractive error were comparable in the E3 data and the EMR data, with no significant difference in the overall refractive error distribution (χ 2 = 527, p = 0.29, DoF = 510). EMR data provided a closer match to the E3 refractive error distribution by age than the ADD lens data. The ADD lens data, however, provided a closer approximation to the E3 data for total myopia prevalence than the GHS data, up to age 64. Conclusions The prevalence of refractive error within a population can be estimated using EMR data in the absence of population surveys. Industry derived sales data can also provide insights on the epidemiology of refractive errors in a population over certain age ranges. EMR and industrial data may therefore provide a fast and cost-effective surrogate measure of refractive error distribution that can be used for future health service planning purposes."
https://openalex.org/W3153142966,"Inactivating mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 cause Tuberous Sclerosis Complex, an autosomal dominant disorder, characterized by multi-system tumor and hamartoma development. Mutation and loss of function of TSC1 and/or TSC2 also occur in a variety of sporadic cancers, and rapamycin and related drugs show highly variable treatment benefit in patients with such cancers. The TSC1 and TSC2 proteins function in a complex that inhibits mTORC1, a key regulator of cell growth, which acts to enhance anabolic biosynthetic pathways. In this study, we identified and validated five cancer cell lines with TSC1 or TSC2 mutations and performed a kinase inhibitor drug screen with 197 compounds. The five cell lines were sensitive to several mTOR inhibitors, and cell cycle kinase and HSP90 kinase inhibitors. The IC50 for Torin1 and INK128, both mTOR kinase inhibitors, was significantly increased in three TSC2 null cell lines in which TSC2 expression was restored. Rapamycin was significantly more effective than either INK128 or ganetespib (an HSP90 inhibitor) in reducing the growth of TSC2 null SNU-398 cells in a xenograft model. Combination ganetespib-rapamycin showed no significant enhancement of growth suppression over rapamycin. Hence, although HSP90 inhibitors show strong inhibition of TSC1/TSC2 null cell line growth in vitro, ganetespib showed little benefit at standard dosage in vivo. In contrast, rapamycin which showed very modest growth inhibition in vitro was the best agent for in vivo treatment, but did not cause tumor regression, only growth delay."
https://openalex.org/W3154692821,"Background The eRegCom cluster randomized controlled trial assesses the effectiveness of targeted client communication (TCC) via short message service (SMS) to pregnant women, from a digital maternal and child health registry (eRegistry) in Palestine, on improving attendance and quality of care. In this paper, we assess whether this TCC intervention could also have unintended consequences on pregnant women’s worries, and their satisfaction with antenatal care (ANC). Methods We interviewed a sub-sample of Arabic-speaking women attending ANC at public primary healthcare clinics, randomized to either the TCC intervention or no TCC (control) in the eRegCom trial, who were in 38 weeks of gestation and had a phone number registered in the eRegistry. Trained female data collectors interviewed women by phone from 67 intervention and 64 control clusters, after securing informed oral consent. The Arabic interview guide, pilot-tested prior to the data collection, included close-ended questions to capture the woman’s socio-demographic status, agreement questions about their satisfaction with ANC services, and the 13-item Cambridge Worry Scale (CWS). We employed a non-inferiority study design and an intention-to-treat analysis approach. Results A total of 454 women, 239 from the TCC intervention and 215 from the control arm participated in this sub-study. The mean and standard deviation of the CWS were 1.8 (1.9) for the intervention and 2.0 (1.9) for the control arm. The difference in mean between the intervention and control arms was -0.16 (95% CI: -0.31 to -0.01) after adjusting for clustering, which was below the predefined non-inferiority margin of 0.3. Women in both groups were equally satisfied with the ANC services they received. Conclusion The TCC intervention via SMS did not increase pregnancy-related worries among recipients. There was no difference in women’s satisfaction with the ANC services between intervention and control arms."
https://openalex.org/W3154720541,"In this before and after cross-sectional analysis, the authors aim to assess the impact of the bundle of research and training initiatives implemented between 2013 and 2018, and coordinated by the Italian Obstetric Surveillance System (ItOSS) to reduce obstetric haemorrhagic emergencies in five selected Italian Regions. To this purpose, the haemorrhagic Maternal Mortality Ratios (MMR) per 100,000 live births were estimated before and after implementing the bundle, through the ItOSS’s vital statistic linkage procedures and incident reporting and Confidential Enquiries. The research and training bundle was offered to all health professionals involved in pregnancy and birth care in the selected regions, representing 40% of national live births, and participating in the ItOSS audit cycle since its institution. The haemorrhagic MMR significantly decreased from 2.49/100,000 live births [95% CI 1.75 to 3.43] in the years 2007–2013 prior to the bundle implementation, to 0.77/100,000 live births [95% CI 0.31 to 1.58] in the years 2014–2018 after its implementation. According to the study results, the bundle of population-based initiatives might have contributed to reducing the haemorrhagic MMR in the participating regions, thus improving the quality of care of the major obstetric haemorrhage."
https://openalex.org/W3155503043,"Shoulder pain and pathology are extremely common for individuals with spinal cord injuries (SCI) who use manual wheelchairs (MWC). Although risky humeral kinematics have been measured during wheelchair-based activities performed in the lab, little is known about arm kinematics in the free-living environment. The purpose of this study was to measure the humeral elevation workspace throughout a typical day for individuals with SCI who use a MWC and matched able-bodied controls. Thirty-four individuals with SCI who use a MWC (42.7±12.7 years of age, 28 males/6 females, C6-L1) and 34 age-and sex-matched controls were enrolled. Participants wore three inertial measurement units (IMU) on their upper arms and torso for one to two days. Humeral elevation angles were estimated and the percentage of time individuals spent in five elevation bins (0–30°, 30–60°, 60–90°, 90–120°, and 120–180°) were calculated. For both arms, the SCI cohort spent a significantly lower percentage of the day in 0–30° of humeral elevation (Dominant: SCI = 15.7±12.6%, Control = 32.1±15.6%, p&lt;0.0001; Non-Dominant: SCI = 21.9±17.8%, Control = 34.3±15.5%, p = 0.001) and a significantly higher percentage of time in elevations associated with tendon compression (30–60° of humeral elevation, Dominant: SCI = 62.8±14.4%, Control = 49.9.1±13.0%, p&lt;0.0001; Non-Dominant: SCI = 58.8±14.9%, Control = 48.3±13.6%, p = 0.003) than controls. The increased percentage of time individuals with SCI spent in elevations associated with tendon compression may contribute to increased shoulder pathology. Characterizing the humeral elevation workspace utilized throughout a typical day may help in understanding the increased prevalence of shoulder pain and pathology in individuals with SCI who use MWCs."
https://openalex.org/W3156061180,"Drug shortages frequently and persistently affect healthcare institutions, posing formidable financial, logistical, and ethical challenges. Despite plentiful evidence characterizing the impact of drug shortages, there is a remarkable dearth of data describing current shortage management practices. Hospitals within the same state or region may not only take different approaches to shortages but may be unaware of shortages proximate facilities are facing. Our goal is to explore how hospitals in Michigan handle drug shortages to assess potential need for comprehensive drug shortage management resources. We conducted semi-structured interviews with diverse stakeholders throughout the state to describe experiences managing drug shortages, approaches to recent shortages, openness to inter-institutional engagement, ideas for a shared resource, and potential obstacles to implementation. To solicit additional feedback on ideas for a shared resource gathered from the interviews, we held focus groups with pharmacists, physicians, ethicists, and community representatives. Among participants representing a heterogeneous sample of institutions, three themes were consistent: (1) numerous drug shortage strategies occurring simultaneously; (2) inadequate resources and lead time to proactively manage shortages; and (3) interest in, but varied attitudes toward, a collaborative approach. These data provide insight to help develop and test a shared drug shortage management resource for enhancing fair allocation of scarce drugs. A shared resource may help institutions adopt accepted best practices and more efficiently access or share finite resources in times of shortage."
https://openalex.org/W3156748543,"Purpose The aim of this study was to explore the status of quality of life between the ages 40–59 in relation to presbyopia and dry eye. Methods Near add power and preferred contact lens power were examined in 219 participants at three clinics. 2000 participants completed a web-based survey on presbyopic symptoms, symptomatic dry eye, sleep quality, and subjective happiness. Results Mean preferred corrected visual acuity was less than 20/20 in women (vs men, P&lt;0.01) who were more often prescribed under-corrected contact lenses, whereas men preferred full correction. According to the annual progression rate of near add power in men (0.1468D/year), the estimated difference in presbyopia progression between men and women was 0.75 years in the right eye, and 1.69 years in the left eye, implying men might suffer presbyopia earlier than women due to higher myopic power of daily use contact lenses. The web-based survey revealed that men reported lower subjective happiness than women (P&lt;0.001) and earlier onset of presbyopic symptoms by 1.1–1.7 years (P&lt;0.05). Men received their first reading glasses 0.8 years earlier than women (P = 0.066). Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that awareness of presbyopic symptoms, visual burden, and dry eyes were significantly correlated with poor sleep quality and subjective happiness. Conclusion Presbyopia and dry eye were significantly associated with sleep quality and subjective happiness in middle-adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W3152702802,"The economic situation worldwide demands individuals with entrepreneurial skills and aptitudes. The adolescence stage is a critical period in which these abilities could be developed and the school is a relevant setting for this purpose. To this end, instruments that allow assessing enterprising abilities are needed. Nonetheless, there remains a lack of instruments with adequate evidence of validity. The purpose of this study was, thus, to analyze the psychometric properties of the Battery for the Assessment of the Enterprising Personality-Adaptive (BEPE-A). The sample included a total of 1105 participants (men = 528; 47.4%) with an age range from 12 to 19 years (M = 15.23 years; SD = 4.40). The BEPE-A and the Entrepreneurial Attitudes Scale for Students (EASS) were used in the study. The EFA, conducted in a subsample of 512 participants, revealed that each of the subscales of the BEPE-A were basically unidimensional. The CFA, conducted in a second subsample of 593 participants, showed that a bifactor model best fit the BEPE-A structure. In addition, measurement invariance was found both by gender and age.

Results found in the study contribute valuable information about new evidences of a battery that allows screening for entrepreneurship in a critical developmental period such as adolescence, and in a relevant setting like school."
https://openalex.org/W3152833294,"We reviewed the records of 337 confirmed cases of tuberculosis patients in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, 2015. The risk factors affecting the survival and multidrug-resistance of tuberculosis patients were examined. Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank test were used to assess the differences in survival among the patients, while Cox regression model was used for multivariate analysis. The qualitative data was tested with chi-square test in the single factor analysis of multidrug-resistant TB. Multivariate analysis was performed using binary logistic regression analysis. The significance level for all the tests were set at 0.05. The mean period of the follow-up of patients was 10 months. In the 337 patients, 33 (9.8%) died, the 21-month survival rate was 90.2%. The results of multivariate Cox regression analysis show that overcrowding (HR = 7.942, 95% CI 3.258-19.356), former smoking (HR = 3.773, 95% CI 1.601-8.889), current smoking (HR = 3.546, 95% CI 1.195-10.521), multidrug-resistance tuberculosis (HR = 4.632, 95% CI 1.913-11.217) were risk factors for death during anti-tuberculosis treatment in TB patients in Liberia. The results of binary logistic regression analysis show that extra-pulmonary (OR = 2.032, 95% CI 1.133-3.644), family history of TB (OR = 2.387, 95% CI 1.186-4.807) and current smoking (OR = 3.436, 95% CI 1.681-7.027) were risk factors for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. These results can provide insights on local tuberculosis early intervention, increase public health awareness, and strengthen the control of factors that may affect the survival and multidrug-resistance of tuberculosis patients."
https://openalex.org/W3153193956,"Reperfusion injury following cold and warm ischemia (IRI) is unavoidable during kidney transplantation and contributes to delayed graft function (DGF) and premature graft loss. Death of tubular epithelial cells (TECs) by necrosis during IRI releases pro-inflammatory mediators (e.g. HMGB1), propagating further inflammation (necroinflammation) and tissue damage. Kidney Injury Molecule-1 (KIM-1) is a phagocytic receptor upregulated on proximal TECs during acute kidney injury. We have previously shown that renal KIM-1 protects the graft against transplant associated IRI by enabling TECs to clear apoptotic and necrotic cells, and that recognition of necrotic cells by KIM-1 is augmented in the presence of the opsonin, apoptosis inhibitor of macrophages (AIM). Here, we tested whether recombinant AIM (rAIM) could be used to mitigate transplant associated IRI. We administered rAIM or vehicle control to nephrectomised B6 mice transplanted with a single B6 donor kidney. Compared to grafts in vehicle-treated recipients, grafts from rAIM-treated mice exhibited significantly less renal dysfunction, tubular cell death, tissue damage, tubular obstruction, as well as local and systemic inflammation. Both mouse and human rAIM enhanced the clearance of necrotic cells by murine and human TECs, respectively in vitro . These data support testing of rAIM as a potential therapeutic agent to reduce DGF following kidney transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W3154630731,"Differences in technical efficiency across farms are one of the major factors explaining differences in farm survival and growth and changes in farm industry structure. This study employs Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to compute technical inefficiency scores for output, energy, materials, pesticides and fertiliser of a sample of Dutch indoor vegetable farms within the period 2006–2016. A bootstrap truncated regression model is used to determine statistical associations between producer-specific characteristics and technical inefficiency scores for the specified inputs. For the sample of indoor growers, the average technical inefficiency was about 14% for energy, 23% for materials, 24% for pesticides and 22% for fertilisers. The bootstrap truncated regression suggested that the degree of specialisation exerts adverse effects on the technical inefficiency of variable inputs. While age, short-term, long-term debt and subsidy were statistically significant, the coefficients were not economically significant. Building the capacity of farmers to reduce input inefficiency will enable farmers to be competitive and reduce the adverse effects of input overuse on the environment."
https://openalex.org/W3155314241,"The biological herbicide and antibiotic 4-formylaminooxyvinylglycine (FVG) was originally isolated from several rhizosphere-associated strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens. Biosynthesis of FVG is dependent on the gvg biosynthetic gene cluster in P. fluorescens. In this investigation, we used comparative genomics to identify strains with the genetic potential to produce FVG due to presence of a gvg gene cluster. These strains primarily belong to two groups of Pseudomonas, P. fluorescens and P. syringae, however, a few strains with the gvg cluster were found outside of Pseudomonas. Mass spectrometry confirmed that all tested strains of the P. fluorescens species group produced FVG. However, P. syringae strains did not produce FVG under standard conditions. Several lines of evidence regarding the transmission of the gvg cluster including a robust phylogenetic analysis suggest that it was introduced multiple times through horizontal gene transfer within the Pseudomonas lineage as well as in select lineages of Thiomonas, Burkholderia and Pantoea. Together, these data broaden our understanding of the evolution and diversity of FVG biosynthesis. In the course of this investigation, additional gene clusters containing only a subset of the genes required to produce FVG were identified in a broad range of bacteria, including many non-pseudomonads."
https://openalex.org/W3155519782,"The objective of this study is to identify essential aspects influencing radiation dose in computed tomography [CT] of the chest, abdomen and pelvis by intraindividual comparison of imaging parameters and patient related factors. All patients receiving at least two consecutive CT examinations for tumor staging or follow-up within a period of 22 months were included in this retrospective study. Different CT dose estimates (computed tomography dose index [CTDI vol ], dose length product [DLP], size-specific dose estimate [SSDE]) were correlated with patient’s body mass index [BMI], scan length and technical parameters (tube current, tube voltage, pitch, noise level, level of iterative reconstruction). Repeated-measures-analysis was initiated with focus on response variables (CTDI vol , DLP, SSDE) and possible factors (age, BMI, noise, scan length, peak kilovoltage [kVp], tube current, pitch, adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction [ASIR]). A univariate-linear-mixed-model with repeated-measures-analysis followed by Bonferroni adjustments was used to find associations between CT imaging parameters, BMI and dose estimates followed by a subsequent multivariate-mixed-model with repeated-measures-analysis with Bonferroni adjustments for significant parameters. A p-value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. We found all dose estimates in all imaging regions were substantially affected by tube current. The iterative reconstruction significantly influenced all dose estimates in the thoracoabdominopelvic scans as well as DLP and SSDE in chest-CT. Pitch factor affected all dose parameters in the thoracoabdominopelvic CT group. These results provide further evidence that tube current has a pivotal role and potential in radiation dose management. The use of iterative reconstruction algorithms can substantially decrease radiation dose especially in thoracoabdominopelvic and chest-CT-scans. Pitch factor should be kept at a level of ≥1.0 in order to reduce radiation dose."
https://openalex.org/W3154938152,"Cold bending is a characteristic of significance for the beautiful curved glass curtain walls, because it affects them in terms of energy-efficiency and cost-efficiency. The increasing engineering projects call for more special studies on the mechanical properties of cold-bent glass panels, especially when the walls are built by insulating glass that is currently widely used while its relevant research is very scarce. This paper is devoted to studying the mechanical properties of anticlastic cold-bent insulating glass while taking different factors into consideration, including glass thickness, cold-bent torsion rate and cavity thickness. 9 pieces of insulating glass were manufactured for anticlastic cold-bending test and their coupled effect with identical load is also studied, and numerical finite element analysis sessions were carried out to simulate the experimental results for each one of them. Further, we analyzed the stress distribution performance of the sample pieces under cold bending and a uniform load, followed by discussions about stress transfer controls in glass plates. The results showed that the cold-bent control stress is on the surface with direct loads from cold bending and close to the cold-bent corner on the short edge, and it is transferred from the parts around the corner to the center when the uniform load plays a leading role in generating stress. This transfer could occur under a relatively small load with a small cold-bent torsion rate. A higher cold-bent torsion rate in cold bending contributed mostly to greater center stress in the glass, and as the glass thickness grows, stress and deflection at the plate center would significantly drop. However, the effect of cavity thickness on the anticlastic mechanical response of insulating glass was found to be trivial."
https://openalex.org/W3155442699,"In this article, the impact of postural variations on hand anthropometry and distribution of skin strain ratios has been investigated. The literature suggests the glove fit directly affects hand functions. However, gloves currently manufactured based on a static posture failed to provide optimum fit. Workers often do not wear protective gloves due to discomfort caused by improper design, which increases the risk of hand injury. Full-color three-dimensional scans of the hands are captured with thirty healthy subjects (20 females, 10 males) to analyze the hand measurements and skin deformation with various postures. 42 of the 57 hand dimensions were found to have significant differences (p &gt;0.05) related to hand posture. The skin strain ratios further suggest that the slant of the web space, dorsal-length and surface area should be increased, while the angles of the web space and length of the palm reduced to advance glove patterns. This research contributes to constructing gloves with optimum fit, performance, and comfort. Results show that in consideration of hand postures, the angle of the slant of web space between digits 2 and 5 and the finger length on the dorsal side should be increased, whilst the finger length on the palm side should be reduced in glove pattern design. Gloves currently constructed based on a splayed posture cannot provide a good fit. Consideration should be given to hand measurements in dynamic postures."
https://openalex.org/W3155858957,"The most successful immunotherapeutic agents are blocking antibodies to either programmed cell death-1 (PD-1), an inhibitory receptor expressed on T lymphocytes, or to its ligand, programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). Nevertheless, many patients do not respond, and additional approaches, specifically blocking other inhibitory receptors on T cells, are being explored. Importantly, the source of the ligands for these receptors are often the tumor cells. Indeed, cancer cells express high levels of PD-L1 upon stimulation with interferon-γ (IFN-γ), a major cytokine in the tumor microenvironment. The increase in PD-L1 expression serves as a negative feedback towards the immune system, and allows the tumor to evade the attack of immune cells. A potential novel immunoregulator is mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein that is secreted from pancreatic beta cells upon cytokines activation, and can induce an alternatively activated macrophage phenotype (M2), and thus may support tumor growth. While MANF was shown to be secreted from pancreatic beta cells, its IFN-γ-induced secretion from tumor cells has never been assessed. Here we found that IFN-γ induced MANF secretion from diverse tumor cell-lines—melanoma cells, colon carcinoma cells and hepatoma cells. Mechanistically, there was no increase in MANF RNA or intracellular protein levels upon IFN-γ stimulation. However, IFN-γ induced ER calcium depletion, which was necessary for MANF secretion, as Dantrolene, an inhibitor of ER calcium release, prevented its secretion. Thus, MANF is secreted from IFN-γ-stimulated tumor cells, and further studies are required to assess its potential as a drug target for cancer immunotherapy."

Dermacentor variabilis , A . maculatum , and Ixodes scapularis were collected using the flagging method, and were taxonomically identified using morphological and molecular methods. A total of 15946 ticks were collected from these sites. A vast majority of the ticks collected over the three-year study period was A . americanum (79.01%). The three other species collected included D . variabilis (13.10%), A . maculatum (7.15%), and Ixodes scapularis (0.73%). More female ticks of each species were collected throughout the study period from all sites, and a unimodal activity period was noted for all four species. The diversity, composition, and phenology of these medically significant tick species are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3156579471,"Collective migration of endothelial cells is important for wound healing and angiogenesis. During such migration, each constituent endothelial cell coordinates its magnitude and direction of migration with its neighbors while retaining intercellular adhesion. Ensuring coordination and cohesion involves a variety of intra- and inter-cellular signaling processes. However, the role of permeation of extracellular Na + in collective cell migration remains unclear. Here, we examined the effect of Na + permeation in collective migration of pulmonary artery endothelial cell (PAEC) monolayers triggered by either a scratch injury or a barrier removal over 24 hours. In the scratch assay, PAEC monolayers migrated in two approximately linear phases. In the first phase, wound closure started with fast speed which then rapidly reduced within 5 hours after scratching. In the second phase, wound closure maintained at slow and stable speed from 6 to 24 hours. In the absence of extracellular Na + , the wound closure distance was reduced by &gt;50%. Fewer cells at the leading edge protruded prominent lamellipodia. Beside transient gaps, some sustained interendothelial gaps also formed and progressively increased in size over time, and some fused with adjacent gaps. In the absence of both Na + and scratch injury, PAEC monolayer migrated even more slowly, and interendothelial gaps obviously increased in size towards the end. Pharmacological inhibition of the epithelial Na + channel (ENaC) using amiloride reduced wound closure distance by 30%. Inhibition of both the ENaC and the Na + /Ca 2+ exchanger (NCX) using benzamil further reduced wound closure distance in the second phase and caused accumulation of floating particles in the media. Surprisingly, pharmacological inhibition of the Ca 2+ release-activated Ca 2+ (CRAC) channel protein 1 (Orai1) using GSK-7975A, the transient receptor potential channel protein 1 and 4 (TRPC1/4) using Pico145, or both Orai1 and TRPC1/4 using combined GSK-7975A and Pico145 treatment did not affect wound closure distance dramatically. Nevertheless, the combined treatment appeared to cause accumulation of floating particles. Note that GSK-7975A also inhibits small inward Ca 2+ currents via Orai2 and Orai3 channels, whereas Pico145 also blocks TRPC4, TRPC5, and TRPC1/5 channels. By contrast, gene silence of Orai1 by shRNAs led to a 25% reduction of wound closure in the first 6 hours but had no effect afterwards. However, in the absence of extracellular Na + or cellular injury, Orai1 did not affect PAEC collective migration. Overall, the data reveal that Na + permeation into cells contributes to PAEC monolayer collective migration by increasing lamellipodial formation, reducing accumulation of floating particles, and improving intercellular adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W3156904464,"The μ-opioid peptide (MOP) receptor is a member of the opioid receptor family and an important clinical target for analgesia. Measuring MOP receptor location and tracking its turnover traditionally used radiolabels or antibodies with attendant problems of utility of radiolabels in whole cells and poor antibody selectivity. To address these issues we have synthesized and characterised a novel ATTO488 based fluorescent Dermorphin analogue; [Cys(ATTO 488) 8 ]Dermorphin-NH 2 (Derm ATTO488 ). We initially assessed the binding profile of Derm ATTO488 in HEK cells expressing human MOP and CHO cells expressing human MOP, δ-opioid peptide (DOP), κ-opioid peptide (KOP) and Nociceptin/Orphanin FQ peptide (NOP) receptors using radioligand binding. Functional activity of the conjugated peptide was assessed by measuring (i) the ability of the ligand to engage G-protein by measuring the ability to stimulate GTPγ[ 35 S] binding and (ii) the ability to stimulate phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Receptor location was visualised using confocal scanning laser microscopy. Dermorphin and Derm ATTO488 bound to HEK MOP (pK i : 8.29 and 7.00; p&lt;0.05), CHO MOP (pK i : 9.26 and 8.12; p&lt;0.05) and CHO DOP (pK i : 7.03 and 7.16; p&gt;0.05). Both ligands were inactive at KOP and NOP. Dermorphin and Derm ATTO488 stimulated the binding of GTPγ[ 35 S] with similar pEC 50 (7.84 and 7.62; p&gt;0.05) and E max (1.52 and 1.34fold p&gt;0.05) values. Moreover, Dermorphin and Derm ATTO488 produced a monophasic stimulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation peaking at 5mins (6.98 and 7.64-fold; p&gt;0.05). Finally, in confocal microscopy Derm ATTO488 bound to recombinant MOP receptors on CHO and HEK cells in a concentration dependent manner that could be blocked by pre-incubation with unlabelled Dermorphin or Naloxone. Collectively, addition to ATTO488 to Dermorphin produced a ligand not dissimilar to Dermorphin; with ~10fold selectivity over DOP. This new ligand Derm ATTO488 retained functional activity and could be used to visualise MOP receptor location."
https://openalex.org/W3152634253,"Study objective To assess individual changes of deep dyspareunia (DDyspareunia) six months after laparoscopic nerve-sparing complete excision of endometriosis, with or without robotic assistance. Methods This preplanned interdisciplinary observational study with a retrospective analysis of intervention enrolled 126 consecutive women who underwent surgery between January 2018 and September 2019 at a private specialized center. Demographics, medical history and surgery details were recorded systematically. DDyspareunia (primary outcome), dysmenorrhea and acyclic pelvic pain were assessed on self-reported 11-point numeric rating scales both preoperatively and at six-month follow-up. Cases with poor prognosis in relation to dyspareunia were described individually in greater detail. Results Preoperative DDyspareunia showed weak correlation with dysmenorrhea (rho = .240; P = .014) and pelvic pain (rho = .260; P = .004). Although DDyspareunia improved significantly (P &lt; .001) by 3 points or more in 75.8% (95%CI: 64.7–86.2) and disappeared totally in 59.7% of cases (95%CI:47.8–71.6), individual analysis identified different patterns of response. The probability of a preoperative moderate/severe DDyspareunia worsening more than 2 points was 4.8% (95%CI: 0.0–10.7) and the probability of a woman with no DDyspareunia developing “de novo” moderate or severe DDyspareunia was 7.7% (95%CI: 1.8–15.8) and 5.8% (95%CI: 0.0–13.0), respectively. In a qualitative analysis, several conditions were hypothesized to impact the post-operative DDyspareunia response; these included adenomyosis, mental health disorders, lack of hormone therapy after surgery, colporrhaphy, nodule excision in ENZIAN B compartment (uterosacral ligament/parametrium), the rectovaginal septum or the retrocervical region. Conclusion Endometriosis surgery provides significant improvement in DDyspareunia. However, patients should be alerted about the possibility of unsatisfactory results."
https://openalex.org/W3153995673,"CD44 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that binds to hyaluronic acid, plays roles in a number of cellular processes and is expressed in a variety of cell types. It is up-regulated in stem cells and cancer. Anti-CD44 monoclonal antibodies affect cell motility and aggregation, and repress tumorigenesis and metastasis. Here we describe four new anti-CD44 monoclonal antibodies originating from B cells of a mouse injected with a plasmid expressing CD44 isoform 12. The four monoclonal antibodies bind to the terminal, extracellular, conserved domain of CD44 isoforms. Based on differences in western blot patterns of cancer cell lysates, the four anti-CD44 mAbs separated into three distinct categories that include P4G9, P3D2, and P3A7, and P3G4. Spot assay analysis with peptides generated in Escherichia coli support the conclusion that the monoclonal antibodies recognize unglycosylated sequences in the N-terminal conserved region between amino acid 21–220, and analyses with a peptide generated in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, demonstrate that these monoclonal antibodies bind to these peptides only after deglycosylation. Western blots with lysates from three cancer cell lines demonstrate that several CD44 isoforms are unglycosylated in the anti-CD44 target regions. The potential utility of the monoclonal antibodies in blocking tumorigenesis was tested by co-injection of cells of the breast cancer-derived tumorigenic cell line MDA-MB-231 with the anti-CD44 monoclonal antibody P3D2 into the mammary fat pads of mice. All five control mice injected with MDA-MB-231 cells plus anti-IgG formed palpable tumors, while only one of the six test mice injected with MDA-MB-231 cells plus P3D2 formed a tiny tumor, while the remaining five were tumor-free, indicating that the four anti-CD44 mAbs may be useful therapeutically."
https://openalex.org/W3154162686,"Activated platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has been used in the clinical settings of wound healing and regenerative medicine, with activation typically induced by the addition of bovine thrombin. To eliminate issues with availability, cost and potential side effects associated with bovine thrombin, ex vivo PRP activation using pulse electric fields (PEF) has been proposed and demonstrated. The present study characterizes the effect of PEF voltage and pulse width, in combination with a range of calcium concentrations, on clot formation, growth factor release, and serotonin (5-HT) release from dense granules. The main findings are: 1) increasing calcium concentrations with most PEF conditions leads to increased levels of PDGF and 5-HT release; 2) whether EGF levels increase or decrease with increasing calcium concentration depends on the specific PEF parameters; 3) the pattern of PDGF and EGF levels in supernatants suggest that these molecules are localized differently within platelets; 4) significant levels of PDGF, EGF, and 5-HT can be released without inducing clot formation or hemoglobin release. In conclusion, voltage, pulse width and calcium concentration can be used to control and tune the release of growth factors, serotonin and hemoglobin from PEF-activated PRP. Because growth factor requirements vary for different types of wounds and for wounds at different stages of healing, the unique balance of factors in supernatants of PEF-activated PRP may provide more clinically advantageous than the current standard of bovine thrombin-activated PRP."

Venous and arterial blood was collected in both Streck and Heparin tubes. A total of 96 metabolites were detected, affected by sex (n = 56), collection tube (n = 33), and blood location (n = 8). These metabolites belonged to a wide array of compound classes including lipids, acids, pharmaceutical agents, signalling molecules, vitamins, among others. Phospholipids and carboxylic acids accounted for 28% of all detected compounds. Out of the 33 compounds significantly affected by collection tube, 18 compounds were higher in the Streck tubes, including allantoin and ketoleucine, and 15 were higher in the Heparin tubes, including LysoPC(P-16:0), PS 40:6, and chenodeoxycholic acid glycine conjugate. Based on our results, it is recommended that replicate blood samples from each patient should be collected in different types of blood collection tubes for a broader range of the metabolome. Several metabolites were found at higher concentrations in cancer patients such as lactic acid in Squamous Cell Carcinoma, and lysoPCs in Adenocarcinoma and Acinar Cell Carcinoma, which may be used to detect early onset and/or to monitor the progress of the cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W3007586829,"Objective To assess attitudes, perceptions, and practices of healthcare workers regarding hospital discharge and follow-up care for children under age five in Migori and Homa Bay, Kenya. Methods This mixed-methods study included surveys and semi-structured telephone interviews with healthcare workers delivering inpatient pediatric care at eight hospitals between November 2017 and December 2018. Results The survey was completed by 111 (85%) eligible HCWs. Ninety-seven of the surveyed HCWs were invited for interviews and 39 (40%) participated. Discharge tasks were reported to be “very important” to patient outcomes by over 80% of respondents, but only 37 (33%) perceived their hospital to deliver this care “very well” and 23 (21%) believed their facility provides sufficient resources for its provision. The vast majority (97%) of participants underestimated the risk of pediatric post-discharge mortality. Inadequate training, understaffing, stock-outs of take-home therapeutics, and user fees were commonly reported health systems barriers to adequate discharge care while poverty was seen as limiting caregiver adherence to discharge and follow-up care. Respondents endorsed the importance of follow-up care, but reported supportive mechanisms to be lacking. They requested enhanced guidelines on discharge and follow-up care. Conclusion Kenyan healthcare workers substantially underestimated the risk of pediatric post-discharge mortality. Pre- and in-service training should incorporate instruction on discharge and follow-up care. Improved post-discharge deaths tracking–e.g., through vital registry systems, child mortality surveillance studies, and community health worker feedback loops–is needed, alongside dissemination which could leverage platforms such as routine hospital-based mortality reports. Finally, further interventional trials are needed to assess the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of novel packages to improve discharge and follow-up care."

Knowing the cancer risk factors could help the policy-makers to design appropriate preventive and control strategies. Objective To investigate the awareness regarding risk factors and determinants of cancers among Bahir Dar city residents, northwest, 2019 Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was employed. A systematic random sampling technique was carried out to select 845 study participants from May 1 to June 30, 2019. A validated structured cancer awareness measuring tool was used to collect the data. The data were entered into the Epi-data version 3.1 and analyzed using SPSS version 21 software. A simple logistic regression was run, and AOR (adjusted odds ratio) at a 95% confidence interval was used to identify the determinants of awareness regarding risk factors of cancers. Results Nearly twenty percent of the respondents had a good awareness regarding risk factors of cancers. An orthodox Christian (AOR = 3. 2; 95%CI: 1.8, 5.6), college graduated (AOR = 2. 3; 95%CI:1.1, 4.9), a family member with cancer (AOR = 2. 0; 95%CI: 1.3, 3.3), and living in a rental house (AOR = 0. 6; 95%CI: 0.4, 0.9) were significantly associated with awareness regarding risk factors of cancers. Conclusion The study revealed that awareness regarding risk factors of cancers was very low in the study area. Being Orthodox Christian, college graduated, a family member with cancer, and living in the rental house were the determinants of awareness regarding risk factors of cancers."
https://openalex.org/W3155464590,"Introduction We saw a lack of data on the biomechanical behavior of degenerated articular cartilage (OA) compared with that of healthy cartilage, even though the susceptibility to wear and tear of articular cartilage plays a key role in the progression of osteoarthritis (OA). Therefore, we performed a comparison between naturally occurring OA and healthy cartilage from pigs, before and after tribological stress. Aim The aim of the study was to compare OA-cartilage with healthy cartilage and to analyze the resilience to tribological shear stress, which will be measured as height loss (HL), and to friction forces of the cartilage layers. The findings will be substantiated in macro- and microscopical evaluations before and after tribological exposure. Methods We assessed stifle joints of fifteen old and sixteen young pigs from the local abattoir radiologically, macroscopically and histologically to determine possible OA alterations. We put pins from the femoral part of the joints and plates from the corresponding tibial plateaus in a pin-on-plate tribometer under stress for about two hours with about 1108 reciprocating cycles under a pressure of approximately 1 MPa. As a surrogate criterion of wear and tear, the HL was recorded in the tribometer. The heights of the cartilage layers measured before and after the tribological exposure were compared histologically. The condition of the cartilage before and after the tribological exposure was analyzed both macroscopically with an adapted ICRS score and microscopically according to Little et al. (2010). We assessed the friction forces acting between the surfaces of the cartilage pair–specimens. Results Articular cartilage taken from old pigs showed significant degenerative changes compared to that taken from the young animals. The macroscopic and microscopic scores showed strong alterations of the cartilage after the tribological exposure. There was a noticeable HL of the cartilage specimens after the first 100 to 300 cycles. The HL after tribological exposure was lower in the group of the old animals with 0.52 mm ± 0.23 mm than in the group of the young animals with 0.86 mm ± 0.26 mm (p &lt; 0.0001). The data for the HL was validated by the histological height measurements with 0.50 mm ± 0.82 mm for the old and 0.79 mm ±0.53 mm for the young animals (p = 0.133). The friction forces measured at the cartilage of the old animals were 2.25 N ± 1.15 N and 1.89 N ± 1.45 N of the young animals (p = 0.3225). Conclusion Unlike articular cartilage from young pigs, articular cartilage from old pigs showed OA alterations. Tribological shear stress exposure revealed that OA cartilage showed less HL than healthy articular cartilage. Tribological stress exposure in a pin–on–plate tribometer seemed to be an appropriate way to analyze the mechanical stability of articular cartilage, and the applied protocol could reveal weaknesses of the assessed cartilage tissue. Friction and HL seemed to be independent parameters when degenerated and healthy articular cartilage were assessed under tribological exposure in a pin–on- plate tribometer."

https://openalex.org/W3154079166,"Background and aims The prognosis of stented lesions differs according to in-stent neointimal characteristics on optical coherence tomography (OCT). In particular, patients who show in-stent heterogeneous neointima are associated with a higher incidence of target lesion revascularization (TLR) compared with those who show in-stent non-heterogeneous neointima. However, the relationship between in-stent neointimal characteristics and native coronary atherosclerosis progression has not been clearly elucidated. The study aimed to investigate the relationship between in-stent neointimal characteristics and progression of native atherosclerosis. Methods The neointimal characteristics of 377 patients with 377 drug-eluting stents (DESs) were quantitatively and qualitatively assessed using OCT. The OCT-based neointima was categorized as homogeneous (n = 207), heterogeneous (n = 93), and layered (n = 77). The relationship of non-target lesion revascularization (non-TLR) with neointimal characteristics was evaluated after OCT examination of the stents. Results After a median follow-up duration of 40.0 months, patients with heterogeneous neointima showed significantly higher non-TLR rates than those with homogeneous neointima and tended to have higher non-TLR rates than those with layered neointima (heterogeneous vs. homogeneous:14.0% vs. 8.7%, p = 0.046; heterogeneous vs. layered neointima:14.0% vs. 7.8%, p = 0.152). Multivariate analysis showed that the independent determinants for non-TLR were heterogeneous neointima (HR: 2.237, 95% CI: 1.023–4.890, p = 0.044) and chronic kidney disease (hazard ratio [HR]: 8.730, 95% CI: 2.175–35.036, p = 0.002). Conclusions The heterogeneous neointima in DES-treated lesions was associated with a higher incidence of non-TLR and target lesion failure. This finding suggests that the neointimal pattern may reflect the progression of the native lesion."
https://openalex.org/W3154381445,"Purpose This study compared the validity and inter- and intra-unit reliability of local (LPM) and global (GPS) position measurement systems for measuring acceleration during team sports. Methods Devices were attached to a remote-controlled car and validated against a laser. Mean percentage biases (MPBs) of maximal acceleration (a max ) and maximal running speed (v max ) were used to measure validity. Mean between-device and mean within-device standard deviations of the percentage biases (bd-SDs and wd-SDs) of a max and v max were used to measure inter- and intra-unit reliability, respectively. Results Both systems tended to underestimate a max similarly (GPS: –61.8 to 3.5%; LPM: –53.9 to 9.6%). The MPBs of a max were lower in trials with unidirectional linear movements (GPS: –18.8 to 3.5%; LPM: −11.2 to 9.6%) than in trials with changes of direction (CODs; GPS: –61.8 to −21.1%; LPM: −53.9 to –35.3%). The MPBs of v max (GPS: –3.3 to –1.0%; LPM: –12.4 to 1.5%) were lower than those of a max . The bd-SDs and the wd-SDs of a max were similar for both systems (bd-SDs: GPS: 2.8 to 12.0%; LPM 3.7 to 15.3%; wd-SDs: GPS: 3.7 to 28.4%; LPM: 5.3 to 27.2%), whereas GPS showed better bd-SDs of v max than LPM. Conclusion The accuracy depended strongly on the type of action measured, with CODs displaying particularly poor validity, indicating a challenge for quantifying training loads in team sports."
https://openalex.org/W3155797762,"The size of a city is not only essential for depicting the scale of the urban system, but also crucial to support the prosperity, order, and high-speed developments. However, its relation to the underlying urban structure has not been empirically investigated in detail. To examine the impact of city size on the city structure and quantify structural features, in this study, a statistical analysis was performed based on network science and an interdisciplinary theoretical system. To obtain the statistical law of internal node layout, the urban system was regarded as a complete graph weighted by the Euclidean distance. The relationship between the urban internal nodes layout (points of interest data, Weibo check-in data, and central point of road intersection data) and the city size was established. The results confirmed the existence of statistical laws in the layout of urban spatial elements, and explored the relationship between the changes in urban node network structure and inequality. This study provided a new perspective of urban structure to understand the complexity of the city, and suggested an approach to adjust this structure to narrow down the gap between the urban and rural areas."
https://openalex.org/W3156409006,"Background Physician professionalism, including anaesthesiologists and intensive care doctors, should be continuously assessed during training and subsequent clinical practice. Multi-source feedback (MSF) is an assessment system in which healthcare professionals are assessed on several constructs (e.g., communication, professionalism, etc.) by multiple people (medical colleagues, coworkers, patients, self) in their sphere of influence. MSF has gained widespread acceptance for both formative and summative assessment of professionalism for reflecting on how to improve clinical practice. Methods Instrument development and psychometric analysis (feasibility, reliability, construct validity via exploratory factor analysis) for MSF questionnaires in a postgraduate specialty training in Anaesthesiology and intensive care in Italy. Sixty-four residents at the Università del Piemonte Orientale (Italy) Anesthesiology Residency Program. Main outcomes assessed were: development and psychometric testing of 4 questionnaires: self, medical colleague, coworker and patient assessment. Results Overall 605 medical colleague questionnaires (mean of 9.3 ±1.9) and 543 coworker surveys (mean 8.4 ±1.4) were collected providing high mean ratings for all items (&gt; 4.0 /5.0). The self-assessment item mean score ranged from 3.1 to 4.3. Patient questionnaires (n = 308) were returned from 31 residents (40%; mean 9.9 ± 6.2). Three items had high percentages of “unable to assess” (&gt; 15%) in coworker questionnaires. Factor analyses resulted in a two-factor solution: clinical management with leadership and accountability accounting for at least 75% of the total variance for the medical colleague and coworker’s survey with high internal consistency reliability (Cronbach’s α &gt; 0.9). Patient’s questionnaires had a low return rate, a limited exploratory analysis was performed. Conclusions We provide a feasible and reliable Italian language MSF instrument with evidence of construct validity for the self, coworkers and medical colleague. Patient feedback was difficult to collect in our setting."
https://openalex.org/W3156883389,"The literature on organ donation in Taiwan lacks a discussion of the roles of medical staff, organ donors, and transplant coordinators in organ donation. The biggest plight of organ donation is lack of the organ donations. When we probed the possibilities of not finish the organ donation procedure, such as religions, traditions and cultural belief, disease cognitions, and the failure of persuasion or the loss of organ donors. There are lots of research literature shown that the attitude of medical personnel would influence the willingness of organ donation or persuasion. This study considered such personnel and their participation in organ donation, specifically analyzing factors influencing their effectiveness. Snowball sampling was adopted to recruit medical staff, organ donors, and transplant coordinators for an online survey. The results revealed that some participants were unclear as to how to initiate the organ donation process and what practical operations are involved. Even with the necessary qualifications, some participants remained passive when soliciting organ donations in clinical practice. Organ donation coordinators with experience in caring for organ donors who attended organ donation courses performed well in soliciting organ donations. The researchers recommend that training courses on clinical planning and organ donation are incorporated into intensive care training and that they serve as the basis for counsellors soliciting organ donations to increase nurses’ willingness to solicit organ donations."
https://openalex.org/W3156990845,"We previously demonstrated that the percentage of blood eosinophils that are associated with platelets and thus positive for CD41 (integrin α IIb -subunit) correlates with and predicts peak eosinophil count (PEC) in biopsies of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) patients after treatment. Thus, flow cytometric determination of CD41+ eosinophils is a potential measure of EoE disease activity. Determinants of association of platelets with eosinophils and other leukocytes in EoE are largely unknown. The objectives of this study were to test the hypotheses that platelets associate with blood leukocytes other than eosinophils in EoE and that such associations also predict EoE activity. Whole blood flow cytometry was performed on samples from 25 subjects before and after two months of standard of care EoE treatment. CD41 positivity of cells within gates for eosinophils, neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, and natural killer cells was compared. We found that percent CD41+ neutrophils, monocytes, and eosinophils correlated with one another such that principal component analysis of the five cell types identified “myeloid” and “lymphoid” factors. Percent CD41+ neutrophils or monocytes, or the myeloid factor, like CD41+ eosinophils, correlated with PEC after treatment, and CD41+ neutrophils or the myeloid factor predicted PEC &lt; 6/high power field after treatment, albeit with lower area under the curve than for CD41+ eosinophils. We conclude that the processes driving platelets to associate with eosinophils in EoE also drive association of platelets with neutrophils and monocytes and that association of platelets with all three cell types is related to disease activity.

https://openalex.org/W3153431499,"The day trading in Taiwanese stock market expands considerably at the beginning of 2016, which increases the transactions of stocks consequently and sparks our interest in exploring the issue of day trading. In this study, we use the data of Taiwan Stock Exchange listed firms to investigate whether the day trading volume over total trading volume (hereinafter referred to as the day trading ratio) and the turnover ratio enhanced by the increase of day trading volume would affect the shareholding and trading behaviors of diverse institutional and individual investors. Unquestionably, we bring out several impressive findings. First, foreign institutional investors would not prefer holding or trading the stocks with high day trading ratios, whereas individual investors would prefer holding these kinds of stocks. We infer that this finding might result from the fundamental and the speculative concerns of these various investors. Second, domestic institutional investors and security dealers would prefer trading the stocks with high turnover ratios, but foreign institutional investors still lack of interest in trading these stocks, implying that the investment strategies would be dissimilar among various institutional investors. Since foreign institutional investors are regarded as the successful institutional investors in Taiwan, we argue that our revealed results may help market participants trace the behaviors of diverse investors, especially the foreign institutional investors, after day trading relaxation in Taiwan."
https://openalex.org/W3153532786,"The purpose of this paper is to examine, whether and under which conditions humans are able to predict the putting distance of a robotic device. Based on the “flash-lag effect” (FLE) it was expected that the prediction errors increase with increasing putting velocity. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the predictions are more accurate and more confident if human observers operate under full vision (F-RCHB) compared to either temporal occlusion (I-RCHB) or spatial occlusion (invisible ball, F-RHC, or club, F-B). In two experiments, 48 video sequences of putt movements performed by a BioRob robot arm were presented to thirty-nine students (age: 24.49±3.20 years). In the experiments, video sequences included six putting distances (1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, and 4.0 m; experiment 1) under full versus incomplete vision (F-RCHB versus I-RCHB) and three putting distances (2. 0, 3.0, and 4.0 m; experiment 2) under the four visual conditions (F-RCHB, I-RCHB, F-RCH, and F-B). After the presentation of each video sequence, the participants estimated the putting distance on a scale from 0 to 6 m and provided their confidence of prediction on a 5-point scale. Both experiments show comparable results for the respective dependent variables (error and confidence measures). The participants consistently overestimated the putting distance under the full vision conditions; however, the experiments did not show a pattern that was consistent with the FLE. Under the temporal occlusion condition, a prediction was not possible; rather a random estimation pattern was found around the centre of the prediction scale (3 m). Spatial occlusion did not affect errors and confidence of prediction. The experiments indicate that temporal constraints seem to be more critical than spatial constraints. The FLE may not apply to distance prediction compared to location estimation."
https://openalex.org/W3154920948,"The 57 countries of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation are suffering from an increasing burden from mental health disorders. We investigated their research outputs during 2008–17 in the Web of Science in order to compare them with the burden from different mental health disorders and in different countries. The papers were identified with a complex filter based on title words and journals. Their addresses were parsed to give fractional country counts, show international collaboration, and also reveal country concentration on individual disorders and types of research. We found 17,920 papers in the decade, with output quadrupling. Foreign contributions accounted for 15% of addresses; they were from Europe (7%), Canada + USA (5%) and elsewhere (3%). They were much greater for Qatar and Uganda (&gt; 60%), but less than 10% for Iran and Turkey. Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder were over-researched, but suicide and self-harm were seriously neglected, relative to their mental health disorder burdens. Although OIC research has been expanding rapidly, some countries have published little on this subject, perhaps because of stigma. Turkey collaborates relatively little internationally and as a result its papers received few citations. Among the large OIC countries, it has almost the highest relative mental health disorders burden, which is also growing rapidly."
https://openalex.org/W3156027830,"We examined the association between genotype and resistance training-induced changes (12 wk) in dual x-ray energy absorptiometry (DXA)-derived lean soft tissue mass (LSTM) as well as muscle fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA; vastus lateralis; n = 109; age = 22 ± 2 y, BMI = 24.7 ± 3.1 kg/m2). Over 315 000 genetic polymorphisms were interrogated from muscle using DNA microarrays. First, a targeted investigation was performed where single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) identified from a systematic literature review were related to changes in LSTM and fCSA. Next, genome-wide association (GWA) studies were performed to reveal associations between novel SNP targets with pre- to post-training change scores in mean fCSA and LSTM. Our targeted investigation revealed no genotype-by-time interactions for 12 common polymorphisms regarding the change in mean fCSA or change in LSTM. Our first GWA study indicated no SNP were associated with the change in LSTM. However, the second GWA study indicated two SNP exceeded the significance level with the change in mean fCSA (P = 6.9 × 10–7 for rs4675569, 1.7 × 10–6 for rs10263647). While the former target is not annotated (chr2:205936846 (GRCh38.p12)), the latter target (chr7:41971865 (GRCh38.p12)) is an intron variant of the GLI Family Zinc Finger 3 (GLI3) gene. Follow-up analyses indicated fCSA increases were greater in the T/C and C/C GLI3 genotypes than the T/T GLI3 genotype (P < .05). Data from the Auburn cohort also revealed participants with the T/C and C/C genotypes exhibited increases in satellite cell number with training (P < .05), whereas T/T participants did not. Additionally, those with the T/C and C/C genotypes achieved myonuclear addition in response to training (P < .05), whereas the T/T participants did not. In summary, this is the first GWA study to examine how polymorphisms associate with the change in hypertrophy measures following resistance training. Future studies are needed to determine if the GLI3 variant differentiates hypertrophic responses to resistance training given the potential link between this gene and satellite cell physiology."
https://openalex.org/W3156546946,"We measured the overshoot effect in a linac and reduced it using block correction, reverse-sequence correction, and index correction. A StarTrack detector was used on a Varian iX. Five segments, 1 × 10 cm 2 in area, were designed; the centers were at −4, −2, 0, 2, and 4 cm on the x axis for measuring the overshoot effect on a 10 × 10 cm 2 collimator setting. Block correction was applied to two segments. The first was on the new first segment at −6 cm, and the other was on the new last segment at 6 cm. Both two new segments were obtained from the 10 × 10 cm 2 collimator setting. The order of segments was reversed in reverse-sequence correction. Reverse-sequence correction averages the dose at every segment after two irradiations. When we used MLC Shaper, index correction reduced the first segment’s index (cumulative radiation occupation) by 60% and increased the last segment’s radiation occupation by 60% in a new MLC.log file. As for relative dose, the first segment had an overdose of 52.4% and the last segment had an underdose of 48.6%, when irradiated at 1 MU at 600 MU/min. The relative doses at the first segment, irradiated at 1 MU, after block correction, reverse-sequence correction, and index correction were applied decreased from 152.5% to 95.1%, 104.8%, and 100.1%, respectively. The relative doses at the last segment, irradiated at 1 MU, after block correction, reverse-sequence correction, and index correction were applied increased from 48.6% to 97.3%, 91.1%, and 95.9%, respectively. The overshoot effect depended on the speed of irradiation. High irradiation speeds resulted in notable overdosing and underdosing at the first and last segments, respectively. The three corrections mitigated the overshoot effect on dose. To save time and effort, the MLC.log file should be edited with a program in the future."
