acid by a number of mammals."
https://openalex.org/W1805717502,Until recently there has been no demonstrated case in Neurospora in which the loss of activity of an essential enzyme could be attributed to gene mutation. It has been assumed from indirect evidence1 that gene mutations do cause such losses and thereby result in “blocks” of essential biochemical reactions. The products of the “blocked” reactions thus become essential growth substances for the mutants. The first success in obtaining direct evidence to support the above assumption has been attained by Wagner and Guirard in studies on the enzymatic synthesis of pantothenic acid by cell-free extracts of Neurospora.

https://openalex.org/W2059218361,THE question of the possibility of obtaining experimental evidence for the existence of a neutral particle of mass 2 has recently been raised by Kundu and Pool1. These authors suggest that certain features of nuclear transformations produced by bombardment by tritium (3H) ions favour the conclusion that a di-neutron having at least transient existence may be captured as a single entity in a nuclear process of an Oppenheimer– Phillips type.

https://openalex.org/W1992197774,"RECENTLY we have isolated products of hydroxylation from dilute aqueous solutions of benzene and benzoic acid irradiated with ionizing radiations (X-rays, I³-rays, neutrons)1. The formation of phenolic compounds in these experiments furnished experimental evidence in support of the theory put forward by one of us2 in 1944, according to which the primary action of ionizing radiations results in the splitting of the water molecules according to,presumably through the ions H2O+ and H2O−. These reaction products are similar to those obtained from the same substances by the action of OH-radicals produced chemically (for example, by the hydrogen peroxide – ferrous salt system), or in the biological oxidation of these substances3. We have now found that irradiation by X-rays of dilute aqueous solutions of certain simple amino-acids results in an (oxidative) deamination yielding ammonia, and the corresponding aldehydes similar to those obtained from the same substances in vitro by the action of OH-radicals produced chemically4."

A 0.5 per cent solution in acetone has been applied twice weekly for fifteen months to the inter-scapular skin of a group of thirty mixed stock mice. A further twenty mice were subcutaneously implanted with pellets of paraffin wax containing 3 per cent of ‘Gammexane', and have since been observed for ten months."
https://openalex.org/W1967385921,"IN their interesting article on the ""Chemistry of Visual Processes"", Ball, Collins, Morton and Stubbs1 consider that Lythgoe‘s indicator yellow2 is a ""fortuitous artefact having no direct relevance to visual chemistry"". They base this conclusion on the fact that retinene1 may be extracted from bleached retinæ or from bleached visual purple (rhodopsin) solutions by a mixture of acetone, ethanol and light petroleum ether and that ""free or loosely bound retinene1 (the final product of bleaching rhodopsin) may combine with any suitable protein or amino-acid which may be available"". They regard this fortuitous combination as the means of production of indicator yellow in solution."

https://openalex.org/W1968672370,"SEVERAL years ago, Brinkman and his collaborators reported that carbonic anhydrase is present in the blood of Arenicola1. This observation was confirmed by Florkin2. Recently, through the kindness of Prof. H. Munro Fox, I have had an opportunity of studying the distribution of the enzyme in this annelid in more detail than was done in these two papers, and some interesting points have come to light."

Wassermann report some experiments on the de-swelling of calcium alginate fibres in salt solutions. They noted that water-swollen alginate fibres when placed in various alkali-salt solutions first contract and then increase in length. The authors suggest that the contraction results from destruction of calcium ion cross-links between alginate chains as the calcium is replaced by alkali ions. They propose also that plastic flow is mainly responsible for the final swelling effect."

https://openalex.org/W2070968540,"WHILE studying, by paper partition chromatography1, the utilization of amino-acids during the growth of the Park Williams No. 8 strain of C. diphtheriæ, we noted a strong yellow fluorescence with ultra-violet light of culture filtrates of the organism grown on a casein hydrolysate medium prepared essentially according to the method of Mueller and Miller2. When such culture filtrates were run on chromatograms using n-butanol-acetic acid as the solvent3, two strongly fluorescent yellow spots were observed when the dried paper was placed under an ultra-violet lamp. Neither of these spots gave any colour when the paper was sprayed with 0·1 per cent (w./v.) ninhydrin in chloroform. One of them was in a position approximating to that occupied by proline and the other to that occupied by the basic amino-acids."

https://openalex.org/W2030353832,IN a previous paper1 evidence was presented that there is a relation between the curariform activity of an onium ion and the charge density on its quaternary central atom. A consideration of this theory and of the fact that the paralysing action of curare can be reversed by a fall of temperature2 led to an investigation of the antagonism between curare and the potassium ion3.

https://openalex.org/W1998098791,"A SURVEY carried out in Cambridge during March–April among teaching staffs and booksellers shows that nearly half of the scientific books the average student is recommended to buy are not available for him to buy new. It also shows that American books cover 33 per cent of all books students are recommended to buy, as opposed to 10 per cent before the War."

https://openalex.org/W4239464540,"From the national point of view, a proper balance must be struck between productive effort and research effort, as in any successful private business ; it is the task of management to secure that the appropriate balance is achieved, and that it is achieved Without diverting too many creative and fertile minds to the equally essential task of administration. This is the point of view from which the present organisation of scientific and industrial research in Great Britain must be considered. As Sir John Anderson rightly said in his lecture to the Society of Chemical Industry when he received the Messel Medal on July 14, Great Britain has been a pioneer among the nations in the organisation of scientific research ; but nevertheless We must have the organisation of science in the public service constantly under review. In particular, it is essential that we should consider whether, by any changes in the existing organisation or by more careful use of our limited scientific man-power, we can rectify admitted weaknesses in the development of research results, and in the supply of trained scientific men and technologists."
https://openalex.org/W4256384388,"In the Golden Age, Plato and Aristotle walked in the Academy and in the Lyceum, instructing and disputing. We, in our time, are in possession of much of their labours ; we have entered into them, and they have become part of our inheritance. Other searchers after truth there were too in those days—artists and craftsmen—who fashioned things for delight as well as for use. But alas ! less, much less, of their works have survived to the present day. In the case of paintings (originally a great number) next to nothing now remains,. In due time, men of genius in applied science appeared, men who understood how to harness natural law to immediate needs. They had to combat the Platonic tendency to discourage investigations concerned with gross matter, and for centuries there had been the lag between discovery and application. But it may be that man was not then ready for such advances. Enough to recollect that when a giant appeared-in the person of Leonardo da Vinci-he combined consummate artist, engineer, technician and natural philosopher all in one. Perhaps sensing his own incapacity to generalize, he strove against heavy odds to study afresh the works of Archimedes, and thus, with not inconsiderable success, to effect a junction between studio and laboratory."
