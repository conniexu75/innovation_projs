This hypothesis postulates a mechanism whereby anions are transported by an electron carrier (probably cytochrome) in the direction opposite to electrons, and whereby cations exchange for hydrogen ions ; both electrons and hydrogen ions enter into the formation of water in the respiratory process. Both ions of a salt are accumulated."

Experiments confirmed the calculated order of magnitude of the critical value of the rate of shear as a function of the chain-length of the molecule."

Parry's “Journal of a Voyage for the Discovery of the North West Passage”, 1821, is relevant. It concerns the white whale (Delphinapterus leucas), p. 35. “Mr. Fisher described them to be generally from 18–20 feet in length; and he stated, that he had several times heard them emit a shrill, ringing sound, not unlike that of musical glasses when badly played. This sound, he further observed, was most distinctly heard, when they happened to swim directly beneath the boat, even when they were several feet under water, and ceased altogether on their coming to the surface.”"

Following the use of mustard-gas (β,β'-dichlorodiethyl sulphide) in producing mutations in the vinegar fly (Drosophila melanogaster) by Auerbach and Robson8, this reagent has been used by Horowitz et al.9 to produce mutations in Neurospora spp. A method for isolating strains of Aspergillus nidulans deficient for a specific amino-acid, cystine, from a mixture of mutants produced by mustard-gas, is now described. These special mutants grow normally in presence of cystine but are unable to grow with sulphate as sole sulphur source."

Some interesting studies and information on this subject already exist, but many of the reports of speed recorded in the past have proved rather conflicting in character. Care appears to have been taken on the recent Expedition to obtain reliable observations, and it now appears to be substantially confirmed that a blue whale can attain a speed of 20 knots for a short burst of about ten minutes duration, and maintain a speed of 14½ knots for two hours and probably longer. A killer whale may obtain slightly higher speeds"

This view has been criticized by Bell, Gillespie and Taylor2 on the grounds of electrometric titration data. The observation that buffering of urea solutions can only be detected at low pH values has been interpreted by these authors to mean that urea is a weak monacid base having the uncharged structure III. This result, however, would appear to be compatible with the polar structure of the molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2070346237,"IT is ten years since Dr. A. Q. Wells reported the presence in the wild vole (Microtus agrestis) of a marine type of tubercle bacillus; since then a good deal of work has been done upon this organism. Tuberculosis has been found also in the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus), the wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) and the shrew (Sorex araneus), and the relationships of this marine type of tubercle bacillus to the bacilli which cause human and avian tuberculosis have been carefully studied. The present position of our knowledge of the problems raised by the discovery of this bacillus has now been ably stated by Dr. A. Q. Wells in a report entitled “The Murine Type of Tubercle Bacillus (The Vole Acid-Fast Bacillus)”, to which Dr. A. H. T. Robb-Smith has contributed notes on the morphology of infection by the vole acid-fast bacillus.*"
https://openalex.org/W2003288002,"Professional workers often have the problem of preparing illustrations for a lecture to a lay or technical audience. The decision regarding the number of lantern slides to be used rests frequently upon three factors: (a) the available funds, a consideration rarely negligible at academic institutions, particularly when slides are to be shown on a single occasion; (b) facilities for preparation of reproducible drawings; (c) the availability of prompt photographic service (capable of filling lastminute orders). The end result is often a great dearth of illustrations and a crowding of information on a few slides. This latter usually leads to illegibly small print of letters or numbers. The effeetive lecture appeals to the visual rather than the auditory comprehension of an audience. Particularly, the merely oral mention of numerical values or the description of conditions, arrangements, trends, etc., generally leave too much to the imagination of the listeners and tax their retentive capacity to such an extent that they find it difficult to follow subsequent statements or reasoning. Therefore, the generous employment of lantern slides is highly desirable. In most cases, it is not necessary to exhibit masterpieces of draftsmanship. Legibly printed words or numbers, schematic sketches of diagrams, and even cartoons serve in good stead. The author happened upon a direct method of making slides which eliminates the expensive photographic process and may be useful to others. Typing on cellophane, with an inverted sheet of carbon paper on the back side for increased density of the print, is probably a well-known expedient. The results of this method are, however, often disappointing because of unwanted carbon adhering to the cellophane or because of smudges from the typewriter ribbon. Also, cellophane does not offer a good drawing surface. A more versatile and convenient material for making slides is available in Permafilm (dull),' a cellulose acetate with a dull finish on one side-and an adhesive on the other. When this film is smoothly applied to a slide cover glass, it exhibits a high transparency and facilitates the writing, drawing, or copying of diagrams onto the slide. While India ink is the most efficient medium for writing and drawing, ordinary pen and ink, soft pencil, or carbon pencil will also give very satisfactory results. All of these media can easily be erased or wiped off with a"

https://openalex.org/W2040840146,KNEE joints of rabbits were infected by intra-articular injection of staphylococci. In some oases a diluted solution of a standardized staphylococcus filtrate was used instead. The absorption of protein from the joint cavity was tested by means of 5·5 gm. per cent solution of human haemoglobin in isotonic saline containing 10 mgm. per cent of calcium. Living radioactive bacteria used in absorption tests were prepared by growing Mycobacterium phlei on a Sauton substrate containing radiophosphorus.

https://openalex.org/W2114284688,"The development of the spores in two species of Verticillium, namely, V. Malthousei Ware and V. psalliotae Treschow, both parasitic on the cultivated mushroom Psalliota sp., was reported by Treschow1to be different. He observed the spores of V. psalliotae lying transversely across the tips of the phialides on which they were developed. He concluded from this observation that the spores, which originated as a minute globule, grew out on either side perpendicular to the long axis of the phialide. He did not observe this transverse arrangement in V. Malthousei Ware, and neither did Ware2 himself. It was, however, recorded in illustrations of this fungus by Atkins and Bulloch3. My own observations from time to time confirmed this record. More recently, I decided to compare the development of the spores in both these species under similar conditions, by continuous observation, using a moist chamber placed on slide cultures."

https://openalex.org/W2569555690,"A SYMPOSIUM arranged by the New York Academy of Sciences and held in December 1946 on ""Nutrition in Relation to Cancer""covered a wide field and included a number of interesting articles which have now been published*. The paper by Dr. E. L. Tatum on chemically induced mutations and their bearing on carcinogenesis deals mainly with mutations induced in Neurospora and Escherichia coli, where the mutations have made the organisms more exacting in their nutritional requirements. Dr. W. J. Bobbins, dealing with the botanical contributions to the cancer problem, suggests that the autonomous growth of plant tumours induced by Phytomonas Pumefaciens is due to their ability to produce indole-acetic acid. In discussing the nutrition of tissue cultures, Dr. P. R. White indicates that if mammalian cells could be grown in controlled synthetic media, then the nutritional techniques used in the study of mutations in Neurospora could be applied to cancer tissue and carcinogenesis. This might give more insight into the relation of carcinogenesis and mutations involving changes in nutritional requirements. The induction of cancer in animals is often greatly affected by diet. Dr. A. Tannenbaum describes how the restriction of the calorific intake of animals reduces the incidence of spontaneous mammary tumours, lung adenomas, hepatomas, sarcomas, and skin tumours, in mice treated with 3: 4-benzpyrene. Restriction of calorific intake, however, has little effect on growth of established cancer. Perhaps the most interesting results of the effect of diet on carcinogenesis are seen in the experiments on hepa-toma induction with azo dyes. Such experiments, carried out at Wisconsin, are described by Dr. J. A. Miller, and results obtained at the Memorial Hospital by Dr. C. J. Kensler. A high content of ribofiavin in the liver reduces the chance of tumour development. Treatment with carcinogenic azo dyes tends to reduce the riboflavin content of the liver; but the carcinogenic action can be neutralized by adding riboflavin to the diet. Dr. J. White, Dr. F. R. White and Dr. G. B. Mider find that the incidence of leukaemia in mice treated with methylcholanthrene is not reduced if the dietary lysine or tryptophane is reduced to levels which prevent growth. On the other hand, reduction of the cystine intake to such a level did reduce the incidence of leukaemia in mice treated with methylcholanthrene."

It is therefore not surprising that much time and money are spent investigating the corn plant. In addition to its economic importance, corn possesses a number of properties making it useful experimental material for cytologists, geneticists, plant breeders, and for evolutionists interested in the origins of cultivated plants. Some aspects of the genetic and breeding problems now attracting attention and an indication of lines of approach for solving them will give a brief indication of current work with this plant in the United States."

Certain classes of books were completely excluded, and others, including scientific and technical books, were admitted up to a limiting money value. During the War, the licensing had, of course, been in operation; but there was the additional need at that time for extreme economy in the use of shipping space, which made restrictions almost inevitable."
https://openalex.org/W4246309394,"THE best form for the central organisation of scientific effort in Great Britain is so complex a problem that it may be wise not to determine it finally with undue haste. We should have regard to the orderly evolution that marks the advance of science, and be on guard against rash generalizations and unsound analogies just as much as against the tendency to excessive planning at the centre. In this connexion, a review by Dr. F. B. Jewett of the future of scientific research in the post-war world (Amer. Sci., 34, 439 ; July, 1946) should be studied. Dr. Jewett does much more than sound a note of caution as to whether there is not a limit to the speed at which society can wisely assimilate radically new scientific developments en masse into the social structure. He is concerned both with the effect on the balance of society, and, what is much more commonly overlooked, with its bearing on the attitude of the man of science himself towards his work as well as towards the society of which he is a part. Sir Hanry Dale, in his presidential address at the Dundee meeting of the British Association, was obviously concerned with this latter aspect, though unlike Dr. Jewett he made no reference to the importance of further stimulating research into other fields of knowledge than the physical or biological sciences. In this connexion the forthcoming report of the National Committee on the Social Sciences set up by the Association of Scientific Workers (see p. 68) will be of interest."
