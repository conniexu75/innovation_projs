https://openalex.org/W2045113343,"Psoriasis is a common immune-mediated disorder that affects the skin, nails and joints. To identify psoriasis susceptibility loci, we genotyped 438,670 SNPs in 1,409 psoriasis cases and 1,436 controls of European ancestry. We followed up 21 promising SNPs in 5,048 psoriasis cases and 5,041 controls. Our results provide strong support for the association of at least seven genetic loci and psoriasis (each with combined P < 5 x 10(-8)). Loci with confirmed association include HLA-C, three genes involved in IL-23 signaling (IL23A, IL23R, IL12B), two genes that act downstream of TNF-alpha and regulate NF-kappaB signaling (TNIP1, TNFAIP3) and two genes involved in the modulation of Th2 immune responses (IL4, IL13). Although the proteins encoded in these loci are known to interact biologically, we found no evidence for epistasis between associated SNPs. Our results expand the catalog of genetic loci implicated in psoriasis susceptibility and suggest priority targets for study in other auto-immune disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1963604994,"Genome-wide pervasive transcription has been reported in many eukaryotic organisms, revealing a highly interleaved transcriptome organization that involves hundreds of previously unknown non-coding RNAs. These recently identified transcripts either exist stably in cells (stable unannotated transcripts, SUTs) or are rapidly degraded by the RNA surveillance pathway (cryptic unstable transcripts, CUTs). One characteristic of pervasive transcription is the extensive overlap of SUTs and CUTs with previously annotated features, which prompts questions regarding how these transcripts are generated, and whether they exert function. Single-gene studies have shown that transcription of SUTs and CUTs can be functional, through mechanisms involving the generated RNAs or their generation itself. So far, a complete transcriptome architecture including SUTs and CUTs has not been described in any organism. Knowledge about the position and genome-wide arrangement of these transcripts will be instrumental in understanding their function. Here we provide a comprehensive analysis of these transcripts in the context of multiple conditions, a mutant of the exosome machinery and different strain backgrounds of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that both SUTs and CUTs display distinct patterns of distribution at specific locations. Most of the newly identified transcripts initiate from nucleosome-free regions (NFRs) associated with the promoters of other transcripts (mostly protein-coding genes), or from NFRs at the 3' ends of protein-coding genes. Likewise, about half of all coding transcripts initiate from NFRs associated with promoters of other transcripts. These data change our view of how a genome is transcribed, indicating that bidirectionality is an inherent feature of promoters. Such an arrangement of divergent and overlapping transcripts may provide a mechanism for local spreading of regulatory signals-that is, coupling the transcriptional regulation of neighbouring genes by means of transcriptional interference or histone modification."

https://openalex.org/W2107503279,"Hedgehog signalling has been implicated in a number of cancers. It is now shown to be important in chronic myeloid leukaemias (CML) where it acts to maintain leukaemia stem cells, by regulating the expression of Numb. Importantly, CML stem cells can be depleted when Hedgehog signalling is inhibited, including cells that are resistant to the drug imatinib that is used to treat CML. Here it is shown that Hedgehog signalling is important in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), where it acts to maintain leukaemia stem cells by regulating the expression of Numb. CML stem cells can be depleted when Hedgehog signalling is inhibited, including cells that are resistant to the drug imatinib that is used to treat CML. Although the role of Hedgehog (Hh) signalling in embryonic pattern formation is well established1, its functions in adult tissue renewal and maintenance remain unclear, and the relationship of these functions to cancer development has not been determined. Here we show that the loss of Smoothened (Smo), an essential component of the Hh pathway2, impairs haematopoietic stem cell renewal and decreases induction of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) by the BCR–ABL1 oncoprotein3. Loss of Smo causes depletion of CML stem cells—the cells that propagate the leukaemia—whereas constitutively active Smo augments CML stem cell number and accelerates disease. As a possible mechanism for Smo action, we show that the cell fate determinant Numb, which depletes CML stem cells, is increased in the absence of Smo activity. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of Hh signalling impairs not only the propagation of CML driven by wild-type BCR–ABL1, but also the growth of imatinib-resistant mouse and human CML. These data indicate that Hh pathway activity is required for maintenance of normal and neoplastic stem cells of the haematopoietic system and raise the possibility that the drug resistance and disease recurrence associated with imatinib treatment of CML4,5 might be avoided by targeting this essential stem cell maintenance pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2017438799,"Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells can be obtained from fibroblasts upon expression of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc. To understand how these factors induce pluripotency, we carried out genome-wide analyses of their promoter binding and expression in iPS and partially reprogrammed cells. We find that target genes of the four factors strongly overlap in iPS and embryonic stem (ES) cells. In partially reprogrammed cells, many genes co-occupied by c-Myc and any of the other three factors already show an ES cell-like binding and expression pattern. In contrast, genes that are specifically co-bound by Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4 in ES cells and encode pluripotency regulators severely lack binding and transcriptional activation. Among the four factors, c-Myc promotes the most ES cell-like transcription pattern when expressed individually in fibroblasts. These data uncover temporal and separable contributions of the four factors during the reprogramming process and indicate that ectopic c-Myc predominantly acts before pluripotency regulators are activated."

https://openalex.org/W2124896761,"Psoriasis is a common inflammatory skin disease with a prevalence of 2-3% in individuals of European ancestry. In a genome-wide search for copy number variants (CNV) using a sample pooling approach, we have identified a deletion comprising LCE3B and LCE3C, members of the late cornified envelope (LCE) gene cluster. The absence of LCE3B and LCE3C (LCE3C_LCE3B-del) is significantly associated (P = 1.38E-08) with risk of psoriasis in 2,831 samples from Spain, The Netherlands, Italy and the United States, and in a family-based study (P = 5.4E-04). LCE3C_LCE3B-del is tagged by rs4112788 (r(2) = 0.93), which is also strongly associated with psoriasis (P < 6.6E-09). LCE3C_LCE3B-del shows epistatic effects with the HLA-Cw6 allele on the development of psoriasis in Dutch samples and multiplicative effects in the other samples. LCE expression can be induced in normal epidermis by skin barrier disruption and is strongly expressed in psoriatic lesions, suggesting that compromised skin barrier function has a role in psoriasis susceptibility."

However, the fate of nuclear pores in postmitotic cells is unknown. Here, we show that NPCs, unlike other nuclear structures, do not turn over in differentiated cells. While a subset of NPC components, like Nup153 and Nup50, are continuously exchanged, scaffold nucleoporins, like the Nup107/160 complex, are extremely long-lived and remain incorporated in the nuclear membrane during the entire cellular life span. Besides the lack of nucleoporin expression and NPC turnover, we discovered an age-related deterioration of NPCs, leading to an increase in nuclear permeability and the leaking of cytoplasmic proteins into the nucleus. Our finding that nuclear “leakiness” is dramatically accelerated during aging and that a subset of nucleoporins is oxidatively damaged in old cells suggests that the accumulation of damage at the NPC might be a crucial aging event.

Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are aqueous channels formed by multiple copies of ∼30 different proteins known as nucleoporins. Pores have an 8-fold symmetrical structure consisting of a nuclear envelope (NE)-embedded scaffold, which surrounds the central channel through which all nucleocytoplasmic transport occurs, and a cytoplasmic and nuclear ring to which eight filaments are attached (Figure 1A). Whereas the cytoplasmic filaments have one loose end, the nuclear filaments are attached to a distal ring forming a structure known as a nuclear basket. NPCs span the double-lipid bilayer of the NE at sites where the inner and outer nuclear membranes are fused (Alber et al., 2007Alber F. Dokudovskaya S. Veenhoff L.M. Zhang W. Kipper J. Devos D.

To accommodate the selective transport of cargo across the NE, additional nucleoporins are attached to the membrane-embedded scaffold (Rabut et al., 2004aRabut G. Doye V. Ellenberg J.

Whereas most peripheral nucleoporins are constantly exchanged at the NPC, the pore scaffold is stable during interphase and only disassembles during the M phase of dividing cells (Daigle et al., 2001Daigle N. Beaudouin J. Hartnell L. Imreh G. Hallberg E. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Ellenberg J. Nuclear pore complexes form immobile networks and have a very low turnover in live mammalian cells.J.

Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This raises the question of how the structural and functional integrity of NPCs is maintained throughout the life span of nondividing cells in which this mitotic renewal cycle is absent. By using C. elegans and a mammalian differentiation system, we found that the expression of the NPC scaffold members is strongly downregulated when the cells exit the cell cycle. Furthermore, we observed that the scaffold nucleoporins are extremely stable and do not exchange once they are incorporated into the NE, persisting for the entire life span of a differentiated cell. We discovered that, in postmitotic cells, NPCs deteriorate with time, losing nucleoporins responsible for maintaining the pore diffusion barrier. Strikingly, we found that nuclei of old rat neurons containing deteriorated NPCs show an increased nuclear permeability and the intranuclear accumulation of cytoplasmic tubulin. The findings that oxidative stress accelerates the age-related “leakiness” of pores and that the proteins that are lost from NPCs can be found carbonylated in old cells, a result of oxidative protein damage, suggest that the deterioration of nuclear selectivity is a consequence of accumulated damage in old NPCs. As a first approach to characterize how NPCs are maintained in differentiated cells, we decided to analyze whether there were differences in the expression of scaffold nucleoporins between dividing and postmitotic cells. We reasoned that, if new pores are assembled in nondividing cells, scaffold nucleoporins that are essential for NPC formation into the NE, such as the Nup107/160 complex (D'Angelo et al., 2006D'Angelo M.A. Anderson D.J. Richard E. Hetzer M.W. Nuclear pores form de novo from both sides of the nuclear envelope.Science. 2006; 312: 440-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), should be expressed. In contrast, if pore assembly is restricted to dividing cells, the expression of scaffold nucleoporins could be repressed as soon as cells exit the cell cycle. To distinguish between these two scenarios, we analyzed nucleoporin expression levels during the development of Caenorhabditis elegans, a well-characterized nematode from which different developmental stages can be separated manually. Importantly for this study, embryos and larvae contain dividing cells, whereas somatic cells of adult worms are entirely postmitotic. We generated stable worm lines expressing GFP under the promoter of a peripheral nucleoporin, ceNup153, or under the promoter of a scaffold nucleoporin, ceNup160. Driven by the ceNup153 promoter, GFP was expressed in most if not all cells of embryos and adult worms (Figures 1B and S1A available online). In contrast, the ceNup160 promoter-driven expression of GFP was restricted to the embryo and, except for a few neurons in the head (Figure 1C), was not detectable in adult worms (Figure 1B). Strikingly, even in embryos, the ceNup160 promoter was only active in a few cells that likely represent dividing cells, as evidenced by the coexpression with cyclin B (Figures S1B and S1C). It is important to note that the lack of promoter activity for both nucleoporins in the dividing germline is likely due to transgene silencing associated with this technique and not to the lack of promoter activity in the cells. These experiments indicate that expression of the ceNup160 scaffold nucleoporin is tightly regulated during development and absent in postmitotic cells. The lack of ceNup160 expression in adult worms raised the question of whether the protein was present in the NPCs of adult cells. To test this, we generated stable worm lines expressing full-length ceNup160 or ceNup153 fused to GFP, again under their own promoters, and found that both nucleoporins were present in all embryonic, larval, and adult nuclei (Figure 1B). The correct incorporation of the GFP-tagged nucleoporins into C. elegans NPCs was verified by colocalization with endogenous nucleoporins (Figure 1D). To directly confirm that Nup160 was not expressed in postmitotic cells, we fed worms that stably expressed ceNup160-GFP or ceNup153-GFP with bacteria expressing GFP RNAi for several generations until we obtained transgenic adult worms with no detectable GFP signal. When RNAi-mediated gene knockdown of ceNup160-GFP and ceNup153-GFP was reversed in these adult worms by RNAi against C. elegans dicer (DCR-1), an essential component of the RNAi machinery (Ketting et al., 2001Ketting R.F. Fischer S.E. Bernstein E. Sijen T. Hannon G.J. Plasterk R.H. Dicer functions in RNA interference and in synthesis of small RNA involved in developmental timing in C. elegans.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2654-2659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar), only ceNup153-GFP expression was restored (Figure 1E), further supporting the idea that ceNup160 is not expressed in postmitotic cells. Taken together, these results suggest that ceNup160 protein found in adult worms originates from embryonic expression and is extremely stable. To analyze whether other scaffold nucleoporins showed a similar behavior, we obtained worm lines expressing tomato under ceNup133 promoter or ceNup133-tomato under its own promoter. Similar to our findings for ceNup160, the promoter of ceNup133 was restricted to the pharynx cells and a few neurons in the postmitotic adult worms, whereas the ceNup133 protein was present in every nucleus (Figure S1D). These results indicate that the life-long stability is a common feature of scaffold nucleoporins. The dramatic difference in the transcriptional regulation of ceNup153 and the scaffold components ceNup160 and ceNup133 in differentiated cells prompted us to analyze the mRNA levels of other nucleoporins. Because wild-type worms contain a large number of dividing cells in their gonads, we used C. elegans glp-4 mutant animals (strain SS104), which have normal morphology and brood size at 15°C but lack gonads and are unable to produce germ cells at 25°C (Beanan and Strome, 1992Beanan M.J. Strome S. Characterization of a germ-line proliferation mutation in C. elegans.Development. 1992; 116: 755-766PubMed Google Scholar) (Figure 2A). Consistent with this phenotype, adult glp-4 mutant animals were essentially free of dividing cells as indicated by the absence of cyclin B mRNA (Figure S2A). Whereas the mRNA levels of all tested nucleoporins and lamin were lower in adult worms compared to embryos, only the scaffold nucleoporins, such as ceNup107/160 complex, ceNup205, and ceNup155, were reduced to similar levels as cyclin B (Figure 2B). An exception was the ceNup107/160 complex member ceSec13, which remained highly expressed in adults, consistent with its additional function in COPII-mediated vesicular transport (Salama et al., 1993Salama N.R. Yeung T. Schekman R.W. The Sec13p complex and reconstitution of vesicle budding from the ER with purified cytosolic proteins.EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4073-4082Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Nucleoporin downregulation was dependent on cell-cycle exit since adult worms containing gonads with dividing cells exhibited high levels of nucleoporin expression (Figures 2A and 2C). These results suggest that the expression of scaffold nucleoporins, in contrast to peripheral NPC components, is either strongly downregulated or absent in nondividing cells. Despite the low amounts of scaffold nucleoporin mRNAs in postmitotic cells and the absence of detectable GFP expression from the ceNup160 promoter, it was still possible that low levels of nucleoporin production were sufficient to maintain nuclear integrity in postmitotic cells. To directly test this, we knocked down nucleoporin mRNAs by RNAi in N2 (wild-type) and daf-2(e1370) mutant worms, the latter having extended life spans due to a mutation in the insulin/IGF-1 receptor (Kenyon et al., 1993Kenyon C. Chang J. Gensch E. Rudner A. Tabtiang R. A C. elegans mutant that lives twice as long as wild type.Nature. 1993; 366: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (2298) Google Scholar, Kimura et al., 1997Kimura K.D. Tissenbaum H.A. Liu Y. Ruvkun G. daf-2, an insulin receptor-like gene that regulates longevity and diapause in Caenorhabditis elegans.Science. 1997; 277: 942-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar), and analyzed their life spans. The mRNA levels of all tested knockdowns were further reduced by > 60%–90% (Figure S2B). If low levels of scaffold nucleoporins were required for nuclear function, we expected the knockdown to either reduce the life spans of adult worms and/or their nucleoporin protein levels. Consistent with their essential role in pore assembly in dividing cells, RNAi against most of the nucleoporins tested were embryonic lethal (Table S1). However, when the RNAi was performed in postmitotic adult worms, only the knockdown of dynamic nucleoporins significantly reduced adult life span, whereas none of the scaffold nucleoporins had a measurable effect, even when depleted in long-lived worms (Figures 3A and S2C). Similar to previous results (Haithcock et al., 2005Haithcock E. Dayani Y. Neufeld E. Zahand A.J. Feinstein N. Mattout A. Gruenbaum Y. Liu J. Age-related changes of nuclear architecture in Caenorhabditis elegans.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 16690-16695Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), knockdown of the single lamin gene was lethal to adult worms with lethality rates comparable to that of ceNup153 (Figure 3A). Notably, the protein levels of the scaffold ceNup107 and ceNup160 nucleoporins in postmitotic worms remained high during the persistent depletion of the corresponding mRNAs by RNAi (Figures 3B and S2D). In contrast, the protein levels of the dynamic ceNup153 and ceNup35 decreased when their mRNAs were knocked down. When the RNAi was performed in reproductive worms containing the dividing cells of the germline, the total levels of all nucleoporins tested decreased (Figure 3C), consistent with the fact that new NPCs are constantly being assembled in proliferating cells. Taken together, these results suggest that the expression of scaffold nucleoporins is not required in the postmitotic stage, even in long-lived animals. From the experiments described above, we conclude that (1) pore assembly is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level, (2) NPC assembly ceases upon cell-cycle exit, and (3) the NPC scaffold can last the entire life span of a metazoan organism. To test whether the transcriptional repression and the life-long stability of the NPC scaffold structure could also be observed in mammalian cells, we first compared mRNA levels of nucleoporins in dividing C2C12 mouse myoblasts and terminally differentiated myotubes (Figure S3A) by using Q-PCR. Consistent with our findings in C. elegans, all nucleoporins tested were highly expressed in dividing myoblasts. However, only the scaffold nucleoporins were strongly downregulated in postmitotic myotubes (Figure 4A). In the C2C12 differentiation system, ∼30% of the cells do not differentiate into myotubes and remain as quiescent cells that maintain the capability of re-entering the cell cycle when exposed to growth-factors-rich media. To investigate whether the downregulation of nucleoporin expression occurs during differentiation or when the cells exit the cell cycle, we separated differentiated myotubes from nondividing quiescent cells and analyzed the mRNA levels of different nucleoporins in comparison with dividing myoblasts. We observed that the shutdown of scaffold nucleoporin expression also occurred in quiescent cells and that releasing the cells into the cell cycle rapidly reactivated nucleoporin expression (Figure 4B). Our results indicate that the transcriptional downregulation of nucleoporins is conserved from worms to mammals and support the idea that, due to the lack of expression of essential scaffold nucleoporins, new pore formation ceases upon cell-cycle exit. Despite the reduction of core nucleoporin expression, the nucleoporin protein levels and the overall number of NPCs (Figures 4C and 4D) remained high during differentiation, which can only be explained by life-long stability of these proteins. One prediction from the life-long stability of scaffold nucleoporins is that these proteins would not be exchanged once they are incorporated into the NE. This hypothesis could not be experimentally tested by using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) measurements of GFP-tagged nucleoporins because the lifetime of nucleoporins exceeded the stability of GFP (we noticed a sharp decline in fluorescence intensity of ceNup160-GFP in adult worms, although the protein remained stable; data not shown). As an alternative approach, we mixed myoblasts expressing GFP-Nup107, a scaffold nucleoporin (Krull et al., 2004Krull S. Thyberg J. Bjorkroth B. Rackwitz H.R. Cordes V.C.

The role of the nuclear envelope in cellular organization.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 316-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), under a constitutive cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter with untransfected myoblasts and induced the fusion/differentiation into multinucleated myotubes by lowering the serum concentration. We then followed the incorporation of the GFP-tagged proteins into the nonfluorescent nuclei derived from untransfected cells (Figure 5A). As expected, we observed that Pom121-GFP, GFP-Nup107, and Lamin B1-GFP efficiently incorporated into the NPCs and lamina of dividing cells (Figure S3B). In postmitotic myotubes, Pom121 equilibrated at pores after ∼30 hr (Figures 5B and 5C and Movie S1). In striking contrast, we did not detect any incorporation (i.e., replacement of endogenous Nup107) of GFP-Nup107 even after 2 days of imaging (Figures 5B and 5C and Movie S2). The lack of incorporation was also observed for all other scaffold nucleoporins tested, including Nup93, Nup43, and Seh-1, whereas all dynamic nucleoporins analyzed were replaced (Figure S3B). Supporting the fact that scaffold proteins cannot be incorporated at the NE of postmitotic myotubes, prolonged or high expression of these nucleoporins resulted in their cytoplasmic accumulation and the formation of NE-associated aggregates (Figures 5D and S3B). Interestingly, the incorporation of Lamin B1-GFP, which has been shown to have a residence time at the NE comparable to the Nup107/160 complex (Rabut et al., 2004aRabut G. Doye V. Ellenberg J. Mapping the dynamic organization of the nuclear pore complex inside single living cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1114-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), was similar to Pom121-GFP (Figures 5B and 5C and Movie S3), indicating that the lamina turns over, albeit slowly. If scaffold nucleoporins are not exchanged once inserted in the NPC, we should expect these proteins to be present in postmitotic cells for long periods of time. To test this, we performed pulse-chase experiments by using isotope labeling of proteins in C2C12 cells. For this experiment, dividing myoblasts were incubated with an S35-methionine/cysteine mix to allow the radioactively labeled scaffold nucleoporins to be incorporated into newly forming NPCs. Cells were then induced to differentiate, and nucleoporins were immunoprecipitated and analyzed at different times after differentiation. Consistent with an extreme stability of the NPC scaffold, we found that Nup107 showed no significant degradation over several weeks. In contrast, dynamic nucleoporins, such as Nup62 and Nup153, and structural proteins like tubulin and lamin A turned over rapidly (Figure 5E). Interestingly, histone H2B also showed high stability in postmitotic cells (Figure 5E), consistent with its reported half-life of 223 days (Commerford et al., 1982Commerford S.L. Carsten A.L. Cronkite E.P. Histone turnover within nonproliferating cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1982; 79: 1163-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). But, unlike Nup107, histone H2B was exchanged from nucleosomes in postmitotic nuclei (Figure S4A). Thus, the observed extreme stability of scaffold nucleoporins is most likely due to the protective environment where these proteins are located, i.e., embedded in the NE and coated with peripheral nucleoporins, and not due to the intrinsic stability of proteins. This notion is supported by the finding that the entire nonameric Nup107/160 complex is rapidly degraded when one of its components is knocked down by RNAi in dividing cells (Walther et al., 2003Walther T.C. Alves A. Pickersgill H. Loiodice I. Hetzer M. Galy V. Hulsmann B.B. Kocher T. Wilm M. Allen T. et al.The conserved Nup107-160 complex is critical for nuclear pore complex assembly.Cell. 2003; 113: 195-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Additionally, we found that the cytoplasmic Nup107 protein that is not incorporated into NPCs in postmitotic myotubes is degraded (Figure S4B). Together with our findings in C. elegans, these results suggest that the NPC scaffold is built to last the lifetime of a cell, and, once embedded in the NE, its subcomponents are not replaced. Defects in nuclear organization and function have been reported in many old organisms (Haithcock et al., 2005Haithcock E. Dayani Y. Neufeld E. Zahand A.J. Feinstein N. Mattout A. Gruenbaum Y. Liu J.

Lamin A-dependent nuclear defects in human aging.Science. 2006; 312: 1059-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Our findings that pores do not turn over in nondividing cells raise the question of whether NPC function is compromised in old cells. Because a central role of the scaffold nucleoporins is to anchor other NPC components that are responsible for the maintenance of the nuclear permeability barrier (Alber et al., 2007Alber F.

Cell. 1997; 8: 2017-2038Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), we decided to test whether the NPCs remain functional as cells age. Potential defects in nuclear membrane integrity and the permeability barrier of NPCs can be directly tested by using fluorescent dextrans with defined molecular weights because molecules larger than 60 kDa are excluded from intact nuclei (Lenart and Ellenberg, 2006Lenart P. Ellenberg J. Monitoring the permeability of the nuclear envelope during the cell cycle.Methods. 2006; 38: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) (Figure S5A). If the permeability barrier of NPCs is compromised, a 70 kDa dextran would be able to leak into the nucleus, whereas perturbations of the nuclear membrane are required to allow access of a 500 kDa dextran (Galy et al., 2003Galy V. Mattaj I.W. Askjaer P. Caenorhabditis elegans nucleoporins Nup93 and Nup205 determine the limit of nuclear pore complex size exclusion in vivo.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 5104-5115Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) (Figure S5A). It is important to note that dextran influx assays are more sensitive than measuring active transport through the NPC because even a single defective pore can be detected (Lenart et al., 2003Lenart P. Rabut G. Daigle N. Hand A.R. Terasaki M. Ellenberg J. Nuclear envelope breakdown in starfish oocytes proceeds by partial NPC disassembly followed by a rapidly spreading fenestration of nuclear membranes.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1055-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To test for functional alterations in old NPCs, we isolated nuclei from postmitotic adult worms at different ages and analyzed their nuclear permeability. We found that, whereas both dextrans were excluded from the nuclei of young worms, influx of the 70 kDa dextran, but not 500 kDa dextran, was observed in a significant percentage (∼30%) of the old worm nuclei (Figure 6A), indicating that the NPC function becomes compromised with age. To analyze whether these “leaky nuclei” could also be observed in mammals and to further determine whether this is a general phenomenon of aging, we isolated nuclei from nonproliferative regions of young (3 months) and old (28 months) rat brains and analyzed their permeability to dextrans. Similar to our observations in C. elegans, the ability to exclude 70 kDa dextran, but not 500 kDa, declined with age (Figure 6B). To confirm that the influx of dextran occurs through defective NPCs, we tested the effect of the wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), a lectin that binds to several glycosylated nucleoporins and can efficiently plug nuclear pores (D'Angelo et al., 2006D'Angelo M.A. Anderson D.J.

This phosphatome resource gives an expanded insight into intrafamily PTP diversity, catalytic activity, substrate recognition, and autoregulatory self-association. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation is a dynamic process governed by the balanced action of tyrosine kinases and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) and is a critical event in the regulation of numerous physiological processes (Pao et al., 2007Pao L.I.

Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 833-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar) . Dysregulation of PTPs is associated with a multitude of diseases, and many members of the PTP family have been recognized as potential therapeutic targets (Tautz et al., 2006Tautz L. Pellecchia M. Mustelin T. Targeting the PTPome in human disease.Expert Opin. Ther. Targets. 2006; 10: 157-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The human genome contains 107 PTPs, with the class I cysteine-based PTPs constituting the largest group. This group can be further subdivided into 61 dual-specificity phosphatases and 38 tyrosine-specific PTP genes, the “classical PTPome,” which are the focus of this study. Classical PTPs have been further subdivided into receptor (R1–R8) and nontransmembrane (NT1–NT9) subgroups (Alonso et al., 2004Alonso A. Sasin J. Bottini N. Friedberg I. Friedberg I. Osterman A.

Biol. 2001; 21: 7117-7136Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Twelve receptor PTPs have two catalytic domains (tandem domains), while the remaining PTPs all have a single catalytic phosphatase domain. In tandem-domain receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs), it is the PTP (D1) domain adjacent to the plasma membrane that displays catalytic activity while the PTP (D2) domain is either inactive or has negligible catalytic activity (Andersen et al., 2001Andersen J.N. Mortensen O.H. Peters G.H. Drake P.G. Iversen L.F. Olsen O.H. Jansen P.G. Andersen H.S. Tonks N.K. Moller N.P. Structural and evolutionary relationships among protein tyrosine phosphatase domains.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7117-7136Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The functional role of the D2 domain has not yet been defined although possible roles in regulating RPTP stability, specificity, and dimerization have been suggested. Furthermore, all RPTPs, with the exception of RPTPα and RPTPɛ, contain large and diverse extracellular regions that regulate cell contacts and adhesion (Aricescu et al., 2007Aricescu A.R. Siebold C. Choudhuri K. Chang V.T. Lu W. Davis S.J. van der Merwe P.A. Jones E.Y. Structure of a tyrosine phosphatase adhesive interaction reveals a spacer-clamp mechanism.Science. 2007; 317: 1217-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The ∼280 residue PTP catalytic domain consists of an α/β structure, and biochemical and structural studies have led to a detailed understanding of the catalytic mechanism (Barford et al., 1994Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Crystal structure of human protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B.Science. 1994; 263: 1397-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, Zhang, 2002Zhang Z.Y. Protein tyrosine phosphatases: structure and function, substrate specificity, and inhibitor development.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 209-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Key features of the domain include the PTP signature motif, the mobile Trp-Pro-Asp “WPD” loop that in the closed conformation positions the conserved and catalytically important aspartate residue, and the phosphotyrosine recognition loop. PTPs exhibit exceptional substrate specificity in vivo, which is conveyed both by the catalytic domain and other regulatory mechanisms including restricted subcellular localization, posttranslational modification events (e.g., phosphorylation), specific tissue distribution, and accessory or regulatory domains (e.g., KIM motifs or SH2 domains) (Tiganis and Bennett, 2007Tiganis T. Bennett A.M. Protein tyrosine phosphatase function: the substrate perspective.Biochem. J. 2007; 402: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Within the catalytic domain, the phosphotyrosine recognition loop (between α1–β1) contributes to the selective recognition of phosphotyrosine over phosphoserine/threonine, and two nonconserved residues following the conserved tyrosine in this loop are important in substrate interactions. A secondary phosphotyrosine (pY) binding site, proximal to the active site, has been identified in PTP1B. The secondary site is accessed from the active site via a channel referred to as the “gateway” region (Peters et al., 2000Peters G.H. Iversen L.F. Branner S. Andersen H.S. Mortensen S.B. Olsen O.H. Moller K.B. Moller N.P. Residue 259 is a key determinant of substrate specificity of protein-tyrosine phosphatases 1B and alpha.J. Biol.

Cell. 2000; 6: 1401-1412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The secondary pY-binding pocket has enabled the development of high-affinity inhibitors that target both pY-binding sites (Tautz et al., 2006Tautz L. Pellecchia M. Mustelin T. Targeting the PTPome in human disease.Expert Opin. Ther. Targets. 2006; 10: 157-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A variety of mechanisms for regulation of PTP function have been reported, including inactivation of receptor PTPs by dimerization, reversible oxidation, and regulation via extracellular ligands and phosphorylation (Tonks, 2006Tonks N.K. Protein tyrosine phosphatases: from genes, to function, to disease.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 833-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). Dimerization as a control mechanism was first suggested based on structural studies on the membrane-proximal D1 domain of RPTPα and EGF receptor/CD45 chimeras (Bilwes et al., 1996Bilwes A.M. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Structural basis for inhibition of receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase-alpha by dimerization.Nature. 1996; 382: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, Desai et al., 1993Desai D.M. Sap J. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. Ligand-mediated negative regulation of a chimeric transmembrane receptor tyrosine phosphatase.Cell. 1993; 73: 541-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The structure revealed a dimeric assembly in which an inhibitory N-terminal helix-turn-helix wedge motif occluded the active site of the interacting catalytic domain. Subsequently, RPTPα and a number of other PTP domains have been shown to homodimerize at the cell surface resulting in inactivation (Jiang et al., 2000Jiang G. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase alpha homodimerizes on the cell surface.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5917-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Here we report the crystal structures of 22 PTP domains, including two tandem-domain RPTP structures and a detailed structural comparison of this protein family. The generated structures include at least one member of each PTP subgroup and thereby provide a comprehensive coverage of the classical phosphotyrosine-specific PTPome. This phosphatome resource gives an expanded insight into intrafamily PTP diversity, catalytic activity, substrate recognition, and autoregulatory self-association and supports a “head-to-toe” dimerization model for RPTPγ/ζ that provides a molecular basis for inhibitory regulation of this subgroup. In this study we used a large-scale structural comparison to identify shared as well as target-specific structural features of members of the classical PTP family. A prerequisite for a conclusive structural intrafamily comparison is a comprehensive coverage of the analyzed protein family. To this end, we determined 22 catalytic domain structures of the human PTP family including 16 not published previously (Supplemental Data available online). Combined with other structure determination efforts (see http://ptp.cshl.edu/ and Almo et al., 2007Almo S.C. Bonanno J.B. Sauder J.M. Emtage S. Dilorenzo T.P. Malashkevich V. Wasserman S.R. Swaminathan S. Eswaramoorthy S. Agarwal R. et al.Structural genomics of protein phosphatases.J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2007; 8: 121-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), the available structures now provide high-resolution information for at least one member of each of the main receptor and nontransmembrane subgroups across the classical PTPome. The catalytic domains of the remaining PTPs of unknown structure are more than 49% identical in sequence to their closest structure-determined family member allowing the construction of reliable homology models. The structural coverage of the PTP family is outlined in the phylogenetic tree shown in Figure 1A. We also report here structures of two tandem-domain RPTPs, RPTPɛ and RPTPγ, revealing the domain organization for the PTP subgroups R4 and R5. The novel structures discussed here were refined at high resolution (average resolution of 2.0 Å and satisfactory stereochemistry; Supplemental Data). Examination of the constructed phylogenetic tree (Figure 1A) revealed that the D2 domains from the R2A and R4 subgroups are most closely related to their respective D1 domains, suggesting a gene duplication event, while the D2 domains from RPTPγ, RPTPζ, RPTPμ, RPTPκ, RPTPρ, and RPTPλ cluster independently of their D1 domains and appear to have a distinct evolutionary root. Superimposition of all known individual PTP D1 and D2 domain structures showed that PTPs fold into a single domain of β sheets flanked by α helices and have a highly conserved topology. The key structural features are highlighted in Figure 1B. Superimposition of all five tandem-domain RPTP structures (CD45, LAR, RPTPσ, RPTPγ, and RPTPɛ) showed that the orientation of the D1 and D2 domains is highly conserved and root mean square deviation (rmsd) values of less than 4.4 Å were obtained, for each pairwise comparison, considering Cα positions of both domains (Supplemental Data). In contrast to the conserved ternary structure, the surfaces of PTPs are surprisingly diverse. A structure-based alignment of all experimental structures for nontransmembrane and receptor PTPs was used to map conserved residues onto the surface of PTP1B and the D1 domain of RPTPμ, respectively (Figures 1C and 1D). This mapping of surface residues identified only a few conserved surface patches comprising loop regions surrounding the active site (Figure 1C, labels A and C). Conserved surfaces are formed by the phosphotyrosine recognition loop (KNRY motif) and by conserved glutamine residues of the Q loop. Conserved WPD loop residues are largely buried (Figure 1C, label D). Highly diverse regions including the two residues following the KNRY motif (Figure 1C, label B) and the topology of the secondary substrate-binding pocket present in a number of PTPs (Figure 1C, label F) contribute to defining substrate specificity. A conserved tyrosine residue (Tyr1019 in RPTPμ) flanking the active site is characteristic for RPTPs (Figure 1D, label A), and the face opposing the active site contains only one conserved cleft as already noted (Andersen et al., 2001Andersen J.N. Mortensen O.H. Peters G.H. Drake P.G. Iversen L.F. Olsen O.H. Jansen P.G. Andersen H.S. Tonks N.K. Moller N.P. Structural and evolutionary relationships among protein tyrosine phosphatase domains.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7117-7136Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The diverse PTP surface gives rise to significant differences in surface electrostatic potential, a property that is likely to influence substrate recognition, association with regulatory proteins, and regulatory mechanisms such as dimerization (Figure 2). This diversity, which was first noted by Alonso et al. based on homology models (Alonso et al., 2004Alonso A. Sasin J. Bottini N. Friedberg I. Friedberg I. Osterman A. Godzik A. Hunter T. Dixon J. Mustelin T. Protein tyrosine phosphatases in the human genome.Cell. 2004; 117: 699-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar), is apparent not only between different PTP family members but also within individual subgroups. However, some diversity in surface potential is introduced by differences in the open or closed states of the active site (e.g., compare PTP1B open/closed conformations; Figure 2), but such changes are localized only to a small surface area. Particularly notable within the RPTP group is the significantly different electrostatic potentials of CD45 and either LAR or RPTPγ. The active site and proximal surface in most PTPNs are largely electropositive, whereas in most RPTPs areas of positive electrostatic potential are mainly localized to the active sites. The dynamics of the opening/closing transition of the WPD loop has implications for PTP substrate recognition and catalytic efficiency and is also of paramount importance for the development of selective PTP inhibitors that may recognize a certain loop conformation. Structural comparisons of all available PTP structures identified four main WPD loop conformations: a closed state, an intermediate state, an open state, and an atypically open state present in STEP, LYP, and GLEPP1 (Figure 3A). The atypically open state is associated in STEP with a stabilizing 310 helix C-terminal to the WPD loop (Eswaran et al., 2006Eswaran J. von Kries J.P. Marsden B. Longman E. Debreczeni J.E. Ugochukwu E. Turnbull A. Lee W.H. Knapp S. Barr A.J. Crystal structures and inhibitor identification for PTPN5, PTPRR and PTPN7: a family of human MAPK-specific protein tyrosine phosphatases.Biochem. J. 2006; 395: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and in LYP and GLEPP1 an extra turn of helix α3 following the WPD loop. The presence of an atypically open state, catalytically nonactive conformation, in three PTPs from different subgroups suggests that this conformation may have significance for the family as a whole. On cocrystallization of a substrate-trapping mutant of STEP (Cys472Ser) with pY bound to the active site, the WPD loop was also present in the atypical open state (Figure 3B), indicating that this conformation is stable and that substrate binding alone is not sufficient to induce loop closure as initially suggested based on apo structures and substrate complexes of PTP1B (Barford et al., 1998Barford D. Das A.K. Egloff M.P. The structure and mechanism of protein phosphatases: insights into catalysis and regulation.Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 133-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). The observation of an open substrate complex and closed apo structures (Pedersen et al., 2004Pedersen A.K. Peters G.G. Moller K.B. Iversen L.F. Kastrup J.S. Water-molecule network and active-site flexibility of apo protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B.Acta Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1527-1534Google Scholar) raises the question of the mechanism that triggers loop closure. Structural comparison revealed that all closed structures share a tightly bound “catalytic water” molecule coordinated by two conserved glutamine residues (Gln262 and 266 in PTP1B) (Figure 3C). In PTP1B this conserved water molecule has been noted previously in a closed apo-structure, in addition to three water molecules that mimic the presence of oxygen atoms of a substrate phosphotyrosine (Pedersen et al., 2004Pedersen A.K. Peters G.G. Moller K.B. Iversen L.F. Kastrup J.S. Water-molecule network and active-site flexibility of apo protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B.Acta Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1527-1534Google Scholar). In contrast, in structures with an open or atypical WPD loop conformation this water molecule was not observed or was significantly displaced, suggesting that it is a key part of the closure mechanism. In order to determine whether other PTPs have a secondary substrate-binding pocket analogous to that found in PTP1B, we analyzed the structural topology and residue characteristics of this region. The presence of a secondary substrate-binding site cannot easily be predicted by sequence comparisons alone since it depends not only on the characteristics of the residues in this region but also on the conformation of the loop connecting helix α2′ and helix α1, which we term the “second-site loop.” The great diversity in conformations of this loop is shown (Figure 4). On the basis of these structural comparisons the PTPs can be grouped into five categories. In the first category are TCPTP, SHP1, SHP2, BDP1, LYP, PEST, PTPBAS, DEP1, MEG2, and GLEPP1, which have a “PTP1B-like” accessible pocket that harbors a basic residue corresponding to Arg24 of PTP1B (Figure 4 and Supplemental Data). This pocket has the potential to accommodate pY at the +1 position as in PTP1B or potentially other acidic or phosphorylated residues in positions N-terminal to the substrate pY. Also within this category are RPTPγ and RPTPβ, which have the secondary pocket with a basic residue albeit with bulky residues in the gateway region. In the second category are PTPs in which both the gateway and the second-site loop are open and accessible as found in the R8 pseudophosphatase group (IA2, IA2β) but a cysteine residue occupies the position of Arg24. The third category is exemplified by the R2A group (LAR, RPTPσ, and RPTPδ) in which the gateway region contains bulky residues that block access to an open secondary pocket, with an aspartate residue in the position corresponding to Arg24. In the fourth category, both the gateway and secondary pocket are blocked and the inaccessible binding cavity harbors an aromatic residue or a proline in position of Arg24. The second-site loop assumes a twisted conformation in these phosphatases. This architecture is present in the subgroups NT5 (PTPH1, MEG1), NT6 (PTPD1, PTPD2), R1 (CD45), R2B (RPTPμ, RPTPκ, RPTPρ), and R4 (RPTPα, RPTPɛ). In the fifth category, the gateway is open and accessible while the secondary site is blocked by an aromatic or proline residue located in the closed secondary site loop. This scenario is present in the R7 group phosphatases (PCPTP, STEP, and HEPTP). To assess enzymatic activity and substrate selectivity of PTP catalytic domains, we selected a panel of diverse phosphopeptides derived from known regulatory phosphorylation sites and assayed them against 28 highly purified PTPs (Figure 5). The peptides were grouped into acidic substrates, mixed acidic-basic substrates, and basic substrates based on the characteristics of residues in N- and C-terminal flanking regions of the phosphorylated site. Specific activity toward the general PTP substrate DiFMUP was measured and used to standardize the amount of protein for phosphopeptide assays. PTPs with particularly high enzymatic activity against generic substrates were RPTPσ and PTP subgroups R5, R3, NT1, NT2, NT3, NT4, and NT5. CD45 and members of subgroups R3 and R5 were extremely promiscuous and dephosphorylated most phosphopeptides with reasonable activity. The subgroups NT1, NT2, NT3, and NT5 exhibited a pronounced preference for acidic residues N-terminal to the phosphorylation site. In PTP1B this selectivity has been explained by substrate peptide interaction with Arg47 of the pY-recognition loop (Zhang, 2002Zhang Z.Y. Protein tyrosine phosphatases: structure and function, substrate specificity, and inhibitor development.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 209-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In contrast, RPTPσ, the R7 group, and NT4 group PTPs were quite selective and showed a preference for a sequence derived from the phosphorylation site in N-cadherin (pY785), a reported substrate of RPTPσ (Siu et al., 2007Siu R. Fladd C. Rotin D. N-cadherin is an in vivo substrate for protein tyrosine phosphatase sigma (PTPsigma) and participates in PTPsigma-mediated inhibition of axon growth.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 208-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the phosphatases PTPD1 and PTPD2 were inactive against the entire panel of phosphopeptides despite displaying a similar level of activity as CD45 toward DiFMUP. The phosphatase HDPTP was also inactive toward the generic substrate DiFMUP and the entire panel of phosphopeptides. Dimerization of receptor PTPs has been proposed as a key mechanism of regulation that leads to inhibition of enzymatic activity. We have used analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) to examine the catalytic domain oligomerization of single- and tandem-domain receptor PTPs from all of the major subgroups. Surprisingly, sedimentation velocity measurements showed that all single-domain RPTPs studied (IA2, IA2β, GLEPP1, DEP1, and STEP) were entirely monomeric in solution (Figure 6A), as were tandem-domain receptor PTPs (RPTPα, CD45, RPTPɛ, and RPTPμ) (Figure 6B). The determined molecular masses calculated from AUC velocity data ranged from 68.5 kDa to 74.2 kDa in agreement with the theoretical mass of monomeric tandem domains. In contrast RPTPγ showed significant and concentration-dependent dimerization (Figure 6B). Sedimentation equilibrium confirmed that RPTPγ formed a stable dimer in solution. The experimental data fit well to a self-association model resulting in determination of a dissociation constant (KD) of 3.5 ± 0.3 μM. The correct masses for the monomeric and dimeric protein were obtained using this analysis and the residuals showed low systematic deviations (Figure 6C). Analysis of the RPTPγ tandem-domain structure revealed that RPTPγ associated with a symmetry-related molecule as a “head-to-toe” dimer (i.e., with the D1 domain of one molecule interacting with the D2 domain of a second molecule and vice versa) (Figure 6D). The interaction between RPTPγ monomers involves extensive electrostatic interactions from the active site D1 domain of one RPTPγ molecule, visible as a highly electropositive pocket, interacting with an electronegative surface of the D2 from the other molecule. The dimer interface covers 1200 Å2 (∼5% of the total molecule surface area) and involves residues from the phosphotyrosine recognition loop, the P loop at the bottom of the active site cleft, and sheet β6, while the D2 domain interface involves the loop connecting strands β10–β11. Multiple hydrogen bonds and salt bridges are involved in the interaction between the two molecules (Supplemental Data). In this dimeric form, the active site of RPTPγ is occluded by the D2 domain of the interacting molecule, suggesting that dimerization in this conformation would prevent substrate access leading to suppression of enzymatic activity. In order to determine whether the molecular mechanism of dimerization in solution correlates with that observed in the crystal structure, we mutated residues of the dimer interface from either the D1 or D2 domains (Figure 6E). In RPTPγ mutant “RKEE” residues, Arg958 and Lys960 of the D1 domain were mutated to glutamic acid, and in mutant “DDKK” residues, Asp1305 and Asp1306 of the D2 domain were mutated to lysine. Both the RKEE and DDKK mutants were entirely monomeric in solution, as assessed by velocity and equilibrium AUC analysis validating the head-to-toe dimerization model (Figure 6F). This study provides structural information for more than 22 human PTP catalytic domains, thereby completing structural coverage for all major subgroups of the classical PTP family and enabling a comprehensive large-scale structural comparison. This resource provides a family-wide insight into catalytic (WPD) loop dynamics, self-association, and catalytic domain substrate specificity. Structural comparisons identified an atypically open WPD loop conformation in LYP, GLEPP1, and STEP (Eswaran et al., 2006Eswaran J. von Kries J.P. Marsden B. Longman E. Debreczeni J.E. Ugochukwu E. Turnbull A. Lee W.H. Knapp S. Barr A.J. Crystal structures and inhibitor identification for PTPN5, PTPRR and PTPN7: a family of human MAPK-specific protein tyrosine phosphatases.Biochem. J. 2006; 395: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), suggesting a regulatory role in diverse family members. This conformation represents an inactive conformation in which the WPD aspartate is moved far out of the active site. Low crystallographic temperature factors observed in this loop region suggest that the atypically open conformation is stable, and multiple crystal forms ruled out that the WPD loop assumed this conformation as a result of crystal contacts. In protein kinases, inactive conformations and active site dynamics are crucial for the regulation of catalytic activity (Huse and Kuriyan, 2002Huse M. Kuriyan J. The conformational plasticity of protein kinases.Cell. 2002; 109: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). By analogy this conformation may represent a regulatory mechanism for PTPs and may find applications in the development of selective and potent inhibitors that target PTP inactive states. The new structural data and analysis presented here suggest that a secondary substrate-binding pocket, similar to that found in PTP1B, is present also in SHP2, BDP1, LYP, SHP1, TCPTP, MEG2, PTPBAS, DEP1, and GLEPP1. Previous structural studies of PTPBAS also provided evidence of a secondary phosphotyrosine pocket (Villa et al., 2005Villa F. Deak M. Bloomberg G.B. Alessi D.R. van Aalten D.M. Crystal structure of the PTPL1/FAP-1 human tyrosine phosphatase mutated in colorectal cancer: evidence for a second phosphotyrosine substrate recognition pocket.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8180-8187Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The basic pocket is also found in the phosphatases RPTPγ and RPTPβ; however, the topology of the region differs in these phosphatases in that the gateway region is inaccessible. The hypothesis that SHP1 and LYP have the potential to interact with phosphoproteins containing adjacent phosphotyrosines is consistent with reports that Zap-70 is a substrate of these PTPs (Pao et al., 2007Pao L.I. Badour K. Siminovitch K.A. Neel B.G. Nonreceptor protein-tyrosine phosphatases in immune cell signaling.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 25: 473-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, given that a relatively small number of proteins contain two adjacent phosphotyrosines, this pocket in other PTPs may interact with phosphothreonine, serine, or an acidic residue in a position N-terminal to the substrate pY. The secondary pocket of PTP1B, and more recently LYP, has been successfully exploited in the design of selective bidentate inhibitors (Yu et al., 2007Yu X. Sun J.P. He Y. Guo X. Liu S. Zhou B.

https://openalex.org/W2059478037,"The transcriptomes of eukaryotic cells are incredibly complex. Individual non-coding RNAs dwarf the number of protein-coding genes, and include classes that are well understood as well as classes for which the nature, extent and functional roles are obscure1. Deep sequencing of small RNAs (<200 nucleotides) from human HeLa and HepG2 cells revealed a remarkable breadth of species. These arose both from within annotated genes and from unannotated intergenic regions. Overall, small RNAs tended to align with CAGE (cap-analysis of gene expression) tags2, which mark the 5′ ends of capped, long RNA transcripts. Many small RNAs, including the previously described promoter-associated small RNAs3, appeared to possess cap structures. Members of an extensive class of both small RNAs and CAGE tags were distributed across internal exons of annotated protein coding and non-coding genes, sometimes crossing exon–exon junctions. Here we show that processing of mature mRNAs through an as yet unknown mechanism may generate complex populations of both long and short RNAs whose apparently capped 5′ ends coincide. Supplying synthetic promoter-associated small RNAs corresponding to the c-MYC transcriptional start site reduced MYC messenger RNA abundance. The studies presented here expand the catalogue of cellular small RNAs and demonstrate a biological impact for at least one class of non-canonical small RNAs."

Numerous predictions regarding the impact of our findings on lymphocyte function and development are noted. Activated Ras proteins regulate several cellular processes by acting on many substrates to affect signaling through diverse pathways (e.g., the MAPK pathway) (Campbell et al., 1998Campbell S.L.

Philips M.R. Compartmentalized Ras/MAPK signaling.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 24: 771-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Membrane-bound Ras proteins shuttle between inactive (GDP-bound) and active (GTP-bound) states. RasGDP binding to guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) results in nucleotide release, enabling nucleotide-free Ras to bind more abundant cellular GTP (Campbell et al., 1998Campbell S.L.

The intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras is enhanced by Ras GTPase-activating proteins (RasGAPs) that promote Ras deactivation (Campbell et al., 1998Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Increasing complexity of Ras signaling.Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). Ras activation is important for the development of T and B lymphocytes and for their effector functions directed against invading pathogens (Genot and Cantrell, 2000Genot E. Cantrell D.A. Ras regulation and function in lymphocytes.Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Antigen receptor stimulation of lymphocytes triggers uniquely high levels of Ras activation (Genot and Cantrell, 2000Genot E. Cantrell D.A. Ras regulation and function in lymphocytes.Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Two families of RasGEFs are well studied in lymphocytes: RasGRP1 and RasGRP3 (Ras guanyl nucleotide release protein) and SOS1 and SOS2 (Son of Sevenless) (Ebinu et al., 2000Ebinu J.O. Stang S.L.

Unusual interplay of two types of Ras activators, RasGRP and SOS, establishes sensitive and robust Ras activation in lymphocytes.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2732-2745Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). RasGRP proteins, mainly restricted to the nervous and hematopoietic systems, are activated by binding to membrane-localized diacylglycerol and by phosphorylation by protein kinase C (see Figures 2A and 4A). SOS proteins are ubiquitous and are recruited to sites of receptor or adaptor tyrosine phosphorylation. SOS' activity is regulated by membrane localization and is greatly accelerated upon binding of active RasGTP to a noncatalytic (allosteric) site (Margarit et al., 2003Margarit S.M. Sondermann H. Hall B.E. Nagar B. Hoelz A. Pirruccello M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Structural evidence for feedback activation by Ras.GTP of the Ras-specific nucleotide exchange factor SOS.Cell. 2003; 112: 685-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The functional consequences of such feedback regulation of SOS' activity, and its interplay with the other GEF, RasGRP, were unknown. An important issue in cell biology is to understand how cells respond in a decisive manner (digital) to the graded (analog) input of increasing amounts of receptor stimulation. Employing synergistic in silico and in vitro methods, we find that signaling in a population of lymphocytes is digital in character, i.e., a bimodal response emerges as stimulus is increased past a threshold. Digital signaling in individual cells requires SOS-mediated Ras activation. A further unanticipated characteristic of Ras activation via SOS is hysteresis in the dose-response curve, i.e., the response to the same stimulus dose depends upon whether the prevailing level of stimulus is achieved by increasing or decreasing the stimulus from its previous value. Our results suggest that bimodal responses and hysteresis also provide a mechanism for short-term molecular “memory,” making it easier to activate membrane-proximal signaling in previously stimulated cells. This may enable T lymphocytes to integrate signals from serial encounters with rare antigen-bearing cells. We find that Ras activation via RasGRP alone increases in a graded fashion with stimulus (analog) and does not exhibit hysteresis. This is because, unlike SOS, RasGRP's activity is not regulated by a positive feedback loop. Our results show how tuning the interplay between two complementary digital and analog signaling modules that activate the same substrate (Ras) leads to more efficient digital responses than if the digital pathway alone was employed. This may be a principle used broadly in biology. Positive feedback regulation is one of many nonlinear mechanisms that can result in “digital” responses of gene regulation programs and signaling networks (Barkai and Leibler, 2000Barkai N.

We describe an example of how positive feedback regulation of a signaling module embedded in a complex signaling network leads to functionally important consequences in cells that orchestrate adaptive immunity. The concepts revealed by our study lead to a number of testable predictions pertinent to lymphocyte development and their ability to be activated in vivo by small doses of stimulatory ligands. Stimulated tyrosine kinase receptors (e.g., growth factor receptors, T cell receptors) recruit SOS to the plasma membrane by the adaptor molecule, Grb2 (Genot and Cantrell, 2000Genot E. Cantrell D.A. Ras regulation and function in lymphocytes.Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The Rem and Cdc25 domains in SOS are required for its GEF catalytic activity (Figure 1A), and we refer to them together as SOScat (SOS catalytic domain). SOS itself has very low GEF activity. Crystallographic and biochemical studies as well as experiments with cell lines show that the activity of SOScat is strongly influenced by a second Ras binding site that is distal to the GEF catalytic site (Margarit et al., 2003Margarit S.M. Sondermann H. Hall B.E. Nagar B. Hoelz A. Pirruccello M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Structural evidence for feedback activation by Ras.GTP of the Ras-specific nucleotide exchange factor SOS.Cell. 2003; 112: 685-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Binding of RasGDP to this allosteric pocket results in a 5-fold increase in GEF activity, whereas binding of RasGTP effects a much larger (∼75-fold) increase (Freedman et al., 2006Freedman T.S. Sondermann H. Friedland G.D. Kortemme T. Bar-Sagi D. Marqusee S. Kuriyan J. A Ras-induced conformational switch in the Ras activator Son of sevenless.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Thus, SOS-mediated Ras activation involves positive feedback regulation by its own catalytic product, RasGTP (Figure 1A). The activity of full-length SOS is inhibited by both N-terminal and C-terminal regions that flank SOScat (Figure S21A available online). Recruitment of SOS to the plasma membrane results in conformational changes that relieve this inhibition and allow RasGDP to bind to SOS' catalytic site (Corbalan-Garcia et al., 1998Corbalan-Garcia S. Margarit S.M. Galron D. Yang S.S. Bar-Sagi D. Regulation of Sos activity by intramolecular interactions.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Binding of membrane phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to SOS' N-terminal PH domain further augments SOS' activity (Gureasko et al., 2008Gureasko J. Galush W.J. Boykevisch S. Sondermann H. Bar-Sagi D. Groves J.T. Kuriyan J. Membrane-dependent signal integration by the Ras activator Son of sevenless.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 452-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In agreement, expression of SOS1cat without these flanking sequences results in Ras signaling without the need for membrane targeting or external stimulus (Roose et al., 2007Roose J.P. Mollenauer M. Ho M. Kurosaki T. Weiss A. Unusual interplay of two types of Ras activators, RasGRP and SOS, establishes sensitive and robust Ras activation in lymphocytes.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2732-2745Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We explored the consequences of positive feedback regulation of SOS by developing a mathematical model for the signaling module in Figure 1B wherein SOScat is uninhibited. We first ignored stochastic fluctuations (van Kampen, 1992van Kampen N.G. Stochastic Processes in Physics and Chemistry. North-Holland, Amsterdam1992Google Scholar) in the number of molecules participating in signaling and developed a deterministic model describing the temporal evolution of the most probable number (or concentration) of the proteins involved in Ras activation via SOScat (Figure 1B). Table 1 summarizes the values of rate parameters that appear in the equations (Experimental Procedures). Only the ratios of certain parameters had been measured. Varying the individual parameters by factors of at least ten while keeping the ratio fixed did not affect the qualitative results (Figures S2–S4).Table 1Rate Constants Used for Model in Figure 1k1k−1k2k−2k3catK3mk4catK4mk5catK5m1.8 × 10−4 (μm)3(mols)−1s−13.0 s−11.7 × 10−4 (μm)3(mols)−1s−10.4 s−10.038 s−11.64 × 103 (mols)/(μm)30.003 s−19.12 × 103(mols)/(μm)30.1 s−11.07 × 102(mols)/(μm)3Sondermann et al., 2004Sondermann H.

Open table in a new tab Parameters used for the equations. Rates are calculated from the catalytic rates and/or the dissociation constants (KD) reported in the literature. For additional information, see Supplemental Data, Section I. Figure 1C shows the theoretical steady-state dose-response curve for Ras activity as the amount of SOScat (α) is varied. For low or high levels of SOScat, there is one possible state characterized by low or high levels of active Ras, respectively. However, for intermediate levels of SOScat, three states of Ras activity are possible. The states shown in blue are unstable to small perturbations, and these states could exist only fleetingly. Therefore, for intermediate levels of SOScat, two possible dominant states of Ras activity could be simultaneously observed, i.e., a bistability is predicted. As the amount of SOScat is increased, the system could follow the lower stable branch until this was no longer possible, and then there would be a large jump in Ras activity (at point A). Thus, the dose-response curve could be very sharp. Importantly, bistability and the concomitant sharp threshold are abrogated if the positive feedback loop regulating SOS' GEF activity is removed from the model (green line in Figures 1D and S2E). Formulas obtained from a detailed analytical study (Supplemental Data, Section VI) suggest that, in addition to feedback regulation of SOS, the minimal requirements for bistable Ras activity are (1) catalytic Ras activation by SOS, with RasGTP bound to the allosteric site and (2) catalytic deactivation of RasGTP by RasGAPs. These features are true. The analytical treatment of simplified models also supports our numerical parameter sensitivity studies, which show that our qualitative results are robust to wide variations in parameters as long as the basic ingredients described above are present. We then investigated the potential effect of Ras activation via RasGRP1 on the bistable Ras activity driven by SOScat. A GEF, RasGRF, which is structurally related to RasGRP, is not dependent on feedback regulation by Ras (Freedman et al., 2006Freedman T.S. Sondermann H. Friedland G.D. Kortemme T. Bar-Sagi D. Marqusee S. Kuriyan J. A Ras-induced conformational switch in the Ras activator Son of sevenless.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 16692-16697Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). So, we assumed that Ras is activated by RasGRP without feedback and used the measured rate parameters for RasGRF since those for RasGRP are unknown. As shown in Figure 1E, bistability and sharp responses are predicted to disappear if RasGRP levels (or activity) are very high. This is because RasGRP activity, which is not subject to feedback regulation, can convert most Ras molecules to its active form before the SOS feedback loop is engaged. Figure 1E also shows that low levels of RasGRP activity reduce the threshold for SOScat (α) to induce a sharp response. We show later that this is because absence of RasGRP makes it difficult to ignite the positive feedback loop regulating SOS' GEF activity. These results suggest that an optimal level of expression or activity of RasGRP, the analog route to Ras activation, enables efficient deployment of feedback regulation of SOS, which leads to bistability. To explore the manifestations of these characteristics of Ras activation in lymphocytes (where stochastic variations between stimulated cells can be important), we carried out stochastic computer simulations of signaling events that might occur in lymphocytes (Figure 2A). The simulations were carried out using the Gillespie algorithm (Gillespie, 1977Gillespie D.T. Exact stochastic simulation of coupled chemical-reactions.J. Phys.

Parameters not listed in Table 1 needed to carry out the simulations are provided in the Supplemental Data. The qualitative features of the results are robust to variations in unknown parameters over wide ranges (Tables S6–S8, Figures S5–S12). The purpose of our in silico studies was not quantitative recapitulation of known data but to provide qualitative mechanistic insights that can be tested experimentally. We carried out stochastic calculations using the amount of SOScat as a surrogate for the level of receptor stimulation. Many replicate dynamic simulations were carried out and levels of RasGTP at various time points were recorded (see Figure S30 for examples). Each simulation corresponds to assaying an individual lymphocyte. The combined results for all such in silico “cells” at a particular time point are displayed (Figure 2B). For low levels of SOScat, all simulations result in low levels of RasGTP, resulting in a single corresponding peak in the histogram. As SOScat is increased, this peak does not gradually move to higher values of RasGTP. Rather, beyond a threshold value of SOScat, a second peak corresponding to a much higher level of RasGTP emerges; the histogram is bimodal (Figure 2B). Thus, the sharp threshold and bistability shown in Figure 1C are manifested as digital signaling. The prediction is that lymphocytes are either “on” or “off” with regard to Ras activation. To test these predictions, we used a Jurkat T cell line into which different amounts of SOS1cat and GFP were transfected together (Roose et al., 2007Roose J.P. Mollenauer M. Ho M. Kurosaki T. Weiss A. Unusual interplay of two types of Ras activators, RasGRP and SOS, establishes sensitive and robust Ras activation in lymphocytes.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2732-2745Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Individual cell assays are required to compare experimental results with the histograms shown in Figure 2B. Analysis of active Ras for individual cells in a population is not possible in this transfection experiment, and so we examined upregulation of a cell-surface activation marker CD69 by individual cells using flow cytometry. CD69 levels correlate with the strength of Ras-ERK signaling (Roose et al., 2007Roose J.P. Mollenauer M. Ho M. Kurosaki T. Weiss A. Unusual interplay of two types of Ras activators, RasGRP and SOS, establishes sensitive and robust Ras activation in lymphocytes.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2732-2745Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), but activation of signaling molecules downstream of Ras could be influenced by feedback regulation of modules such as the MAPK pathway (Ferrell, 2002Ferrell J.E.

Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar, Kholodenko et al., 2002Kholodenko B.N. Kiyatkin A. Bruggeman F.J. Sontag E. Westerhoff H.V. Hoek J.B.

We will address this issue directly below. Low or high levels of SOS1cat expression led to unimodal cell populations with low or high levels of CD69 induction (Figures 2C and S21B). Intermediate levels of SOS1cat (red) induced a bimodal CD69 expression pattern in wild-type (WT) Jurkat T cells (Figure 2C). SOS1cat-induced bimodality was not observed for a control marker that is Ras unresponsive (Figure S21C). These results in cells mirror the predictions of the computer simulations in that signaling is digital. We next tested the hypothesis emerging from our calculations (Figures 1C and S2E) that the origin of digital signaling is feedback regulation of SOS-mediated Ras activation. Experiments carried out with RasGRP1-deficient JPRM441 cells indicate the importance of this feedback loop. In contrast to WT cells (Figure 2C), intermediate levels of SOS1cat induced high CD69 expression levels in very few JPRM441 cells (13% in Figure 3A, top row). Similarly, intermediate levels of SOScat did not generate a bimodal response in computer simulations of the RasGRP-deficient state (Figure 3B). Basal RasGRP1-mediated activation of Ras is not subject to feedback regulation but can “ignite” the SOS feedback loop (Roose et al., 2007Roose J.P. Mollenauer M. Ho M. Kurosaki T. Weiss A. Unusual interplay of two types of Ras activators, RasGRP and SOS, establishes sensitive and robust Ras activation in lymphocytes.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2732-2745Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) by providing RasGTP that can bind SOS' allosteric pocket and increase its activity 75-fold. Consistent with our computational results (Figure 1E), in RasGRP-deficient JPRM441 cells, lower basal levels of RasGTP make it more difficult to ignite the SOS feedback loop. Sufficiently high levels of SOScat can induce bimodal responses without RasGRP1 (Figures 3A, 3B, 1E, and S22) because RasGTP produced by the GEF activity of SOScat with RasGDP bound to the allosteric pocket can ultimately prime SOS' feedback loop. The computer simulation results suggested that a bimodal response would re-emerge in RasGRP-deficient cells for intermediate levels of SOS1cat if exogenous RasGTP molecules that bind to SOS' allosteric pocket were added. To test this, we introduced Ras molecules like H-RasV12C40 (Roose et al., 2007Roose J.P. Mollenauer M. Ho M. Kurosaki T. Weiss A. Unusual interplay of two types of Ras activators, RasGRP and SOS, establishes sensitive and robust Ras activation in lymphocytes.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2732-2745Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) or H-RasG59E38 (Boykevisch et al., 2006Boykevisch S. Zhao C. Sondermann H. Philippidou P. Halegoua S. Kuriyan J. Bar-Sagi D. Regulation of ras signaling dynamics by Sos-mediated positive feedback.Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 2173-2179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) that are predominantly GTP loaded (because of the V12 or G59 mutation) and thus bind SOS' allosteric pocket to increase GEF activity. These molecules also contain a second mutation (C40 or E38) that impairs binding to RAF and so do not directly activate the RAF-MEK-ERK-CD69 pathway, i.e., downstream pathways must be activated by endogenous Ras molecules. In this type of assay, not all transfected cells start to express SOS1cat synchronously and SOS1cat-expressing cells transit from low CD69 to high CD69 expression. It is therefore difficult to ascertain whether the response is bimodal or not by visual inspection. We adapted Hartigan's test (Hartigan and Hartigan, 1985Hartigan J.A. Hartigan P.M. The dip test of unimodality.Ann. Stat. 1985; 13: 70-84Crossref Google Scholar), which allows for a qualitative determination of whether a response in a population of cells is bimodal or unimodal. The generated histograms were divided into 120 equal portions and the mean fluorescence of CD69 and the number of cells in each portion were determined. Hartigan's test confirmed that intermediate levels of SOS1cat when combined with H-RasG59E38, but not with WT H-Ras, restored bimodal signaling in RasGRP-deficient cells (Figure 3C, bottom row: Bimodal with p < 0.01). The same level of SOS1cat or H-RasG59E38 alone also did not result in high CD69 expression (Figure 3C, top row, unimodal; U:p < 0.01). Importantly, when the allosteric pocket in SOScat is mutated (SOS1cat-W729E), so that it can no longer interact with nucleotide-associated Ras proteins, adding H-RasG59E38 does not result in a bimodal pattern of signaling (Figure 3C, bottom row). Similar results were obtained with H-RasV12C40 (data not shown). Modeling Ras activation in this cell biological e"

https://openalex.org/W2106203560,"Asparagine-linked glycosylation of polypeptides in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum is catalyzed by the hetero-oligomeric oligosaccharyltransferase (OST). OST isoforms with different catalytic subunits (STT3A versus STT3B) and distinct enzymatic properties are coexpressed in mammalian cells. Using siRNA to achieve isoform-specific knockdowns, we show that the OST isoforms cooperate and act sequentially to mediate protein N-glycosylation. The STT3A OST isoform is primarily responsible for cotranslational glycosylation of the nascent polypeptide as it enters the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. The STT3B isoform is required for efficient cotranslational glycosylation of an acceptor site adjacent to the N-terminal signal sequence of a secreted protein. Unlike STT3A, STT3B efficiently mediates posttranslational glycosylation of a carboxyl-terminal glycosylation site in an unfolded protein. These distinct and complementary roles for the OST isoforms allow sequential scanning of polypeptides for acceptor sites to insure the maximal efficiency of N-glycosylation."

We show that Imp8 interacts with Ago proteins and localizes to cytoplasmic processing bodies (P bodies), structures involved in RNA metabolism. Furthermore, we detect Ago2 in the nucleus of HeLa cells, and knockdown of Imp8 reduces the nuclear Ago2 pool. Using immunoprecipitations of Ago2-associated mRNAs followed by microarray analysis, we further demonstrate that Imp8 is required for the recruitment of Ago protein complexes to a large set of Ago2-associated target mRNAs, allowing for efficient and specific gene silencing. Therefore, we provide evidence that Imp8 is required for cytoplasmic miRNA-guided gene silencing and affects nuclear localization of Ago proteins."

Use of targeted mass spectrometry (MS) to verify disease- or therapy-related changes in protein levels requires the selection of peptides that are quantifiable surrogates for proteins of interest.

Identification of the most effective signature peptides, particularly in the absence of experimental data, remains a major resource constraint in developing targeted MS-based assays. Here we describe a computational method that uses protein physicochemical properties to select high-responding peptides and demonstrate its utility in identifying signature peptides in plasma, a complex proteome with a wide range of protein concentrations. Our method, which employs a Random Forest classifier, facilitates the development of targeted MS-based assays for biomarker verification or any application where protein levels need to be measured."

https://openalex.org/W1984704432,"Recent advances have led to insights into the structure of the bacterial ribosome, but little is known about the 3D organization of ribosomes in the context of translating polysomes. We employed cryoelectron tomography and a template-matching approach to map 70S ribosomes in vitrified bacterial translation extracts and in lysates of active E. coli spheroplasts. In these preparations, polysomal arrangements were observed in which neighboring ribosomes are densely packed and exhibit preferred orientations. Analysis of characteristic examples of polysomes reveals a staggered or pseudohelical organization of ribosomes along the mRNA trace, with the transcript being sequestered on the inside, the tRNA entrance sites being accessible, and the polypeptide exit sites facing the cytosol. Modeling of elongating nascent polypeptide chains suggests that this arrangement maximizes the distance between nascent chains on adjacent ribosomes, thereby reducing the probability of intermolecular interactions that would give rise to aggregation and limit productive folding."

This paper reports the unusual structure of the metabolite-sensing domain of a flavin mononucleotide (FMN)-specific riboswitch bound to FMN, riboflavin and an antibiotic. The relatively open ligand-binding pocket suggests that antimicrobials based on FMN could be devised. The biosynthesis of several protein cofactors is subject to feedback regulation by riboswitches1,2,3. Flavin mononucleotide (FMN)-specific riboswitches4,5, also known as RFN elements6, direct expression of bacterial genes involved in the biosynthesis and transport of riboflavin (vitamin B2) and related compounds. Here we present the crystal structures of the Fusobacterium nucleatum riboswitch bound to FMN, riboflavin and antibiotic roseoflavin7. The FMN riboswitch structure, centred on an FMN-bound six-stem junction, does not fold by collinear stacking of adjacent helices, typical for folding of large RNAs. Rather, it adopts a butterfly-like scaffold, stapled together by opposingly directed but nearly identically folded peripheral domains. FMN is positioned asymmetrically within the junctional site and is specifically bound to RNA through interactions with the isoalloxazine ring chromophore and direct and Mg2+-mediated contacts with the phosphate moiety. Our structural data, complemented by binding and footprinting experiments, imply a largely pre-folded tertiary RNA architecture and FMN recognition mediated by conformational transitions within the junctional binding pocket. The inherent plasticity of the FMN-binding pocket and the availability of large openings make the riboswitch an attractive target for structure-based design of FMN-like antimicrobial compounds. Our studies also explain the effects of spontaneous and antibiotic-induced deregulatory mutations and provided molecular insights into FMN-based control of gene expression in normal and riboflavin-overproducing bacterial strains."

Our study reveals a mechanism for preferential degradation of protein aggregates by autophagy and emphasizes the physiological significance of selective autophagy during animal development. Autophagy, the primary intracellular catabolic mechanism for degradation of cytosol or damaged organelles, involves the formation of a double-membrane structure, termed the autophagosome, which engulfs a portion of the cytoplasm and/or organelles and delivers it to the lysosome for degradation (Klionsky, 2005Klionsky D.J. The molecular machinery of autophagy: Unanswered questions.J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). In yeast, conserved proteins have been identified that act collaboratively in distinct steps of autophagosome biogenesis (Levine and Klionsky, 2004Levine B. Klionsky D.J.

These proteins include the Atg1 protein kinase complex that regulates the induction of autophagy; the Atg6/Vps34 class III phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase complex that mediates vesicle nucleation; the two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems that are required for vesicle expansion; and the retrieval complex that is involved in recycling the transmembrane protein Atg9 between preautophagosomal structures (PAS) and non-PAS structures (van der Vaart et al., 2008van der Vaart A. Mari M. Reggiori F. A picky eater: Exploring the mechanisms of selective autophagy in human pathologies.Traffic. 2008; 9: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the two ubiquitin-like conjugation pathways, Atg8 is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine through the sequential action of processing enzyme Atg4, E1-like activating enzyme Atg7, and E2-like conjugating enzyme Atg3. The lipidated form of Atg8 associates with the autophagosomal membrane. The sequential action of Atg7 and E2-like enzyme Atg10 leads to conjugation of Atg12 to Atg5 (Klionsky, 2005Klionsky D.J. The molecular machinery of autophagy: Unanswered questions.J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). The autophagic machinery is evolutionarily conserved, although some functional counterparts have yet to be identified in other organisms. Autophagy plays an important role in many physiological processes in mammalian cells, including response to nutrient stress, innate and adaptive immunity, and autophagic cell death (Mizushima et al., 2008Mizushima N. Levine B. Cuervo A.M. Klionsky D.J. Autophagy fights disease through cellular self-digestion.Nature. 2008; 451: 1069-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (4653) Google Scholar). Autophagy also functions as an important quality control system in eliminating disease-related mutant proteins associated with various neurodegenerative disorders, including mutant variants of huntingtin in Huntington's disease and α-synuclein in familial Parkinson's disease (Rubinsztein, 2006Rubinsztein D.C. The roles of intracellular protein-degradation pathways in neurodegeneration.Nature. 2006; 443: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). The basal constitutive level of autophagy also removes diffuse aggregate-prone proteins, and loss of autophagy activity leads to intracellular accumulation of polyubiquitinated protein aggregates, particularly in neurons or hepatocytes (Komatsu et al., 2006Komatsu M. Waguri S. Chiba T. Murata S. Iwata J. Tanida I. Ueno T. Koike M. Uchiyama Y. Kominami E. Tanaka K.

The formation of polyubiquitin-containing protein aggregates requires the activity of p62/sequestosome-1 (SQSTM1), which possesses a polyubiquitin-binding activity and is present in ubiquitin-positive protein aggregates (Komatsu et al., 2007Komatsu M. Waguri S. Koike M. Sou Y.S. Ueno T. Hara T. Mizushima N. Iwata J. Ezaki J.

Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 1065-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). p62 forms protein aggregates and is a preferential target of autophagy, probably through its direct interaction with the autophagy protein LC3/Atg8 (Pankiv et al., 2007Pankiv S. Clausen T.H. Lamark T. Brech A. Bruun J.A. Outzen H. Øvervatn A. Bjørkøy G.

Thus, p62 may be involved in linking polyubiquitinated protein aggregates to the autophagic machinery, facilitating the clearance of such aggregates. It remains to be determined whether nonubiquitinated protein aggregates could be selectively removed by autophagy and how such aggregates might be recognized and targeted. A specialized type of protein aggregate, which is suggested to carry the germ cell determinant, is segregated from oocytes into germ precursor cells in the formation of germ cells in many organisms, including C. elegans and Drosophila (Strome and Lehmann, 2007Strome S. Lehmann R. Germ versus soma decisions: Lessons from flies and worms.Science. 2007; 316: 392-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In C. elegans, these protein aggregates, called germ P granules, are maternally contributed and segregated exclusively into the germline blastomere during early embryonic divisions (Hird et al., 1996Hird S.N. Paulsen J.E. Strome S. Segregation of germ granules in living Caenorhabditis elegans embryos: Cell-type-specific mechanisms for cytoplasmic localisation.Development. 1996; 122: 1303-1312PubMed Google Scholar). P granules continue to be expressed in all of the descendants of the primordial germ cell P4, with the exception of mature sperm, and are associated with the outer surface of the nuclear envelope. Restriction of P granules to germline blastomeres is achieved through a combination of events, including migration of P granules toward the cytoplasm inherited by germ blastomeres and degradation and/or disassembly of P granules that remain in the cytoplasm of somatic daughters during early embryonic divisions (Hird et al., 1996Hird S.N. Paulsen J.E. Strome S. Segregation of germ granules in living Caenorhabditis elegans embryos: Cell-type-specific mechanisms for cytoplasmic localisation.Development. 1996; 122: 1303-1312PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism underlying P granule depletion in somatic cells is not known. In this study, we show that several maternally derived P granule components that remain in somatic cells during early embryonic divisions are selectively degraded by autophagy. sepa-1 is required both for the formation and degradation of PGL granules. SEPA-1 directly interacts with the P granule component PGL-3 and the autophagy protein LGG-1/Atg8, linking PGL granules to autophagy. SEPA-1 belongs to a family of C. elegans proteins that are preferential substrates of autophagy, suggesting that SEPA-1 family members may function as adaptor proteins in mediating selective autophagic degradation. To understand how germ P granules are exclusively localized in germ cells, we performed a genome-wide RNAi screen to identify genes whose loss of function caused ectopic accumulation of the P-granule-specific reporter, GFP::PGL-1, in somatic cells (Figures 1A and 1B) (Kawasaki et al., 1998Kawasaki I. Shim Y.H. Kirchner J. Kaminker J. Wood W.B. Strome S. PGL-1, a predicted RNA-binding component of germ granules, is essential for fertility in C. elegans.Cell. 1998; 94: 635-645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). We found that RNAi inactivation of lgg-1, encoding the ortholog of yeast autophagy protein Atg8, resulted in the formation of GFP::PGL-1-positive granules in somatic cells at embryonic and larval stages (Figures 1C–1E). To determine the distribution of endogenous PGL-1, lgg-1 mutant animals (without the gfp::pgl-1 reporter) were stained with the monoclonal anti-PGL-1 antibody K76. One to three granules were found to be dispersed in the cytoplasm in lgg-1 somatic cells (Figures 1F–1H). The formation of perinuclear P granules in germ cells was not affected in lgg-1 mutants (Figure 1H). Thus, loss of function of lgg-1 leads to the accumulation of PGL-1 granules in somatic cells. In addition to PGL-1, germ P granules contain other components that associate with P granules at all stages of germline development, including PGL-3 and an unidentified P-granule-specific epitope recognized by the monoclonal antibody OIC1D4 (Kawasaki et al., 1998Kawasaki I. Shim Y.H. Kirchner J. Kaminker J. Wood W.B. Strome S.

The PGL family proteins associate with germ granules and function redundantly in Caenorhabditis elegans germline development.Genetics. 2004; 167: 645-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Costaining of lgg-1 animals with anti-PGL-1 and anti-PGL-3 antibodies revealed that PGL-1 and PGL-3 were colocalized in granules in somatic cells (Figures 1I–1K). The somatic granules stained by OIC1D4 were also colocalized with those labeled by a rabbit anti-PGL-1 antibody in lgg-1 animals (data not shown). These somatic PGL-1-positive granules, which contain multiple germ P granule components, were referred to as PGL granules. PGL granules, however, lack components that are transiently associated with germ P granules in germline blastomeres and also do not contain germline RNA helicases GLH-1 and GLH-4 (Figures S1 and S2 available online). When the formation of PGL granules was examined in other autophagy mutants, we found that loss of function of components involved in the two ubiquitin-like pathways, including atg-4.1, atg-3, lgg-3/atg12, atg-7, and lgg-2/atg8, caused accumulation of PGL granules (Figures 1L–1O and Table S1). PGL granules were also found in unc-51, atg-18, and vps-16 mutant embryos (Figure 1P and Table S1), which encode components of the Atg1 kinase complex, the retrieval complex, and the complex required for autophagosome/lysosome fusion, respectively. Furthermore, mutant alleles of lgg-1, atg-3, atg-7, atg-10, and atg-18 were isolated in the genetic screen to identify mutants that cause formation of PGL granules in somatic cells (Figure S3). Taken together, these results indicate that autophagy is important for preventing the formation of PGL granules in somatic cells. We next determined whether somatic cells in autophagy mutants have been transformed to a germ cell fate. Reporters for various types of somatic cells, including neurons, pharyngeal muscles, seam cells, and intestine cells, are appropriately expressed in autophagy mutant animals (data not shown). atg-18 null mutants are viable and fertile. Null mutants for lgg-1, atg-3, and atg-7 develop into morphologically normal-looking larvae. Thus, despite the presence of germline P granule components, somatic cells in autophagy mutants still properly differentiate. The temporal formation of PGL granules in lgg-1 embryos was examined by immunostaining with K76. P granules were only detected in the posterior P1 cell at the 2-cell stage (n = 3) and were exclusively partitioned into the germ blastomere before the 16-cell stage (n = 3) in lgg-1 embryos (Figures S4A, S4B, S4K, and S4L). In 16-cell stage lgg-1 embryos, a few PGL granules were faintly detected in somatic cells, whereas, in 24-cell stage lgg-1 embryos, many brightly stained PGL granules were observed (Figures S4C, S4D, S4M, and S4N and data not shown). PGL granules increased in number as development proceeded around the comma to 2-fold stage and were present throughout embryogenesis (Figures S4E–J and S4O–S4T). These results indicate that PGL granules are progressively formed in lgg-1 embryos. PGL granule components in autophagy mutants could be synthesized from zygotically transcribed mRNAs or maternally contributed. To distinguish between these possibilities, we determined whether somatic PGL-3-positive PGL granules in autophagy mutants are dependent on maternal pgl-3. When the distribution of PGL-3 in embryos born from a cross between lgg-1 males and lgg-1; pgl-3(0) hermaphrodites was examined, no PGL-3 granules were detected (Figures 1Q and 1R). However, F1 embryos produced from lgg-1; pgl-3(0) males mated to lgg-1 hermaphrodites contained PGL-3 granules in somatic cells (Figures 1S and 1T). Similarly, PGL-1-positive PGL granules in lgg-1 mutants were dependent on maternal pgl-1 (data not shown). To rule out the possibility that somatic PGL-1 proteins in autophagy mutants are derived from zygotically transcribed mRNA, we analyzed the pgl-1 mRNA levels and found no induction of pgl-1 transcripts in lgg-1 embryos (Figure 1U). Taken together, our results strongly argue that PGL granule components in autophagy mutants are derived from the oocyte. The maternally loaded pgl-1 and pgl-3 mRNAs, which are present in somatic blastomeres during early embryonic divisions (Kawasaki et al., 2004Kawasaki I. Amiri A. Fan Y. Meyer N. Dunkelbarger S. Motohashi T. Karashima T. Bossinger O. Strome S. The PGL family proteins associate with germ granules and function redundantly in Caenorhabditis elegans germline development.Genetics. 2004; 167: 645-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), could also be translated and accumulated into PGL granules in autophagy mutants. To strengthen the evidence that P granule components in somatic cells are degraded by autophagy, we performed immunoelectron microscopy (immunoEM). Sections of wild-type, early-stage embryos were incubated with the anti-PGL-1 antibody K76 followed by gold-conjugated secondary antibody to determine whether PGL-1 was located in membrane-surrounded structures in somatic cells. Consistent with the idea that germline P granules that remain in somatic cells during early embryonic divisions are disassembled and quickly removed, gold-labeled PGL-1 particles were only rarely observed. After examining 83 EM sections, in the cytoplasm of somatic cells, we detected nine membrane-surrounded structures containing PGL-1 particles (Figures 1V and 1W). These membrane-bound structures are similar in dimension to autophagolysosomes that were previously reported in C. elegans (Melendez et al., 2003Melendez A. Talloczy Z. Seaman M. Eskelinen E.L. Hall D.H. Levine B. Autophagy genes are essential for dauer development and life-span extension in C. elegans.Science. 2003; 301: 1387-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar), further supporting the notion that P granule components are removed by autophagy in somatic cells. To investigate how PGL granules are formed in autophagy mutants, we performed genetic screens to identify mutants that suppressed the formation of PGL granules in lgg-1 mutants and atg-18 mutants (Figures 2A and 2B). Eleven mutant alleles of a single genetic locus, termed sepa-1 (suppressor of ectopic P granule in autophagy mutants), were isolated from ∼9500 genomes screened. In sepa-1; lgg-1 and sepa-1; atg-18 mutants, GFP::PGL-1 was homogeneously distributed in the cytoplasm of somatic cells (Figures 2C and 2D), indicating that PGL-1 proteins were still present but failed to form granules. The formation of endogenous PGL granules in lgg-1 and atg-18 mutants was also suppressed by mutations in sepa-1 (Figures 2E and 2H and data not shown). Mutations in sepa-1 also suppressed the formation of PGL granules in other autophagy mutants, including lgg-3 and atg-7 animals (data not shown). The formation of perinuclear P granules in germline cells, however, was not affected by sepa-1 mutations (Figures 2F and 2H). Therefore, sepa-1 is essential for the accumulation of PGL-1 and PGL-3 into PGL granules in autophagy mutants. We next investigated whether sepa-1 is required for the degradation of P granule components that remain in somatic cells during early embryonic divisions. In wild-type early embryos, GFP::PGL-1 is restricted to germ precursor cells. However, diffuse GFP::PGL-1 signal was observed in somatic cells from the 2-cell stage onward in sepa-1 mutants (Figure 2I), indicating that GFP::PGL-1 failed to be removed from somatic cells in sepa-1 mutants. To further demonstrate that loss of function of sepa-1 prevents the degradation of P granule components in somatic cells, we examined the level of endogenous PGL-3 protein. In wild-type animals, the level of PGL-3 was high in early embryos (before the 8-cell stage) but decreased dramatically in comma-stage embryos (Figure 2J). However, high levels of PGL-3 persisted in sepa-1 mutant comma-stage embryos (Figure 2J). These results demonstrate that sepa-1 is involved in the clearance of maternally derived P granule components in somatic cells. sepa-1 was mapped on the right side of chromosome I, at about +17.31, and cloned by transformation rescue (Figure 3A). A PCR fragment containing a single predicted gene, M01E5.6, restored the formation of PGL granules in sepa-1; atg-18 mutants (Figure 3A; see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details). Furthermore, RNAi knockdown of M01E5.6 disrupted the formation of PGL granules in atg-18 animals. Thus, suppression of PGL granule formation in autophagy mutants is caused by reduced activity of sepa-1. sepa-1 encodes a protein of 702 amino acids (Figure 3B). The N terminus of SEPA-1 is rich in helical structures, whereas the C terminus contains a protein interaction KIX domain (Figure 3B). The molecular lesions in 11 sepa-1 mutants were identified by sequencing the corresponding genomic DNA (Figure 3B). The presence of helical-rich structures and a KIX domain in SEPA-1 led us to test whether SEPA-1 self-interacts. In an in vitro pull-down assay, we detected a strong interaction between GST-SEPA-1 and His-SEPA-1 (Figure 3C). By preparing a series of SEPA-1 deletion fragments, we mapped the region required for self-association to amino acids 39 to 160 (Figure 3C and data not shown). Therefore, SEPA-1 is able to self-associate. To determine the expression pattern of sepa-1, we raised antibodies against the KIX domain of SEPA-1 (Figure S7). The specificity of this anti-SEPA-1 antibody is confirmed by the lack of SEPA-1 staining in sepa-1(bp402) animals (Figure S7), in which the KIX domain of SEPA-1 is deleted. In wild-type animals, no obvious expression of sepa-1 could be detected by anti-SEPA-1 antibody in embryos before the 16-cell stage (Figures 4A and 4B). A few SEPA-1 aggregates were found in ∼16-cell stage embryos, and the number of SEPA-1 aggregates was dramatically increased as the embryo developed to the ∼100-cell stage (Figures 4C and 4D). As development proceeded, SEPA-1 aggregates disappeared, and only a few cells contained SEPA-1 aggregates by the comma stage (Figures 4E and 4F). Immunostaining with anti-SEPA-1 antibody showed that SEPA-1 was not present in germline P granules at all embryonic and larval stages (Figures 4G–4J and S7). Because of homogenous background fluorescence from the secondary antibody, we were unable to determine whether weak diffuse SEPA-1 immunofluorescence signal was present in somatic cells. Therefore, we constructed a reporter that contains the entire coding sequence and promoter of sepa-1, with gfp joined in-frame at the C terminus, to further assess the expression pattern of sepa-1 in somatic cells. This translational reporter fully rescued the sepa-1 phenotype. The earliest appearance of SEPA-1::GFP was in ∼16-cell stage embryos, where it was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm of almost all cells, with a few small aggregates (Figures 4K and 4L). SEPA-1::GFP formed aggregates in a temporal pattern similar to that shown by the anti-SEPA-1 antibody (Figures 4M–4P). Diffuse SEPA-1::GFP signal was still evident in most cells at the comma stage and was greatly diminished by the 2-fold stage of embryogenesis (Figures 4O and 4P and data not shown). After hatching, cytoplasmic SEPA-1 aggregates were found in a few unidentified cells in the head and tail regions and also in the intestine, especially in the anterior and posterior pairs of intestine cells (Figures 4Q and 4R). The gradual disappearance of SEPA-1 during embryogenesis and its requirement for degradation of PGL granule components suggested that SEPA-1 could be a preferential target of autophagy. Indeed, compared to the expression pattern of sepa-1 in wild-type animals, we found that the number of SEPA-1 aggregates was dramatically increased in lgg-1 animals after the 100-cell stage (Figures 4S–4W). For example, SEPA-1 aggregates were present throughout the animal body in lgg-1 L1 larvae (Figure 4W). Furthermore, SEPA-1 accumulated into larger aggregates in lgg-1 animals. Other components of the autophagic machinery, including atg-3, atg-7, and lgg-3, were also required for the removal of SEPA-1. To rule out the possibility that the increased expression of sepa-1 in autophagy mutants was due to upregulation of sepa-1 transcription, we analyzed sepa-1 mRNA levels and found no obvious alteration in wild-type and lgg-1 embryos (Figure 4X). These results indicate that SEPA-1 is removed by autophagy during animal development. The requirement of sepa-1 for accumulation of P granule components into granules in autophagy mutants prompted us to examine whether SEPA-1 aggregates are colocalized with PGL granules in autophagy mutants. When lgg-1 embryos carrying the sepa-1 reporter were immunostained with anti-PGL-1 or anti-PGL-3 antibody, SEPA-1 aggregates were colocalized with PGL-1-positive or PGL-3-positive granules (Figures 5A–5F). Costaining with anti-SEPA-1 and anti-PGL-3 antibodies also revealed the colocalization of endogenous SEPA-1 and PGL-3 in lgg-1 embryos (Figures 5G–5I). Therefore, SEPA-1 is an integral component of PGL granules present in autophagy mutants. To understand how SEPA-1 is involved in the formation of PGL granules in autophagy mutants, we identified proteins that interact with SEPA-1 by screening a yeast two-hybrid C. elegans cDNA library. Eleven positive clones were isolated from about 2.2 × 106 clones screened. Nine clones turned out to be PGL-3 (Figure 5J). Direct interaction between SEPA-1 and PGL-3 was also confirmed by an in vitro GST pull-down assay (data not shown). By constructing a series of PGL-3 fragments, we found that amino acids 581 to 614 of PGL-3 interacted with SEPA-1 (Figures 5J and 5K). The PGL-3 interacting domain in SEPA-1 was located at amino acids 39 to 160 (Figure 5L). We next investigated whether SEPA-1 associates with PGL-3 in vivo. Extracts of lgg-1 mutant embryos were immunoprecipitated with anti-PGL-3 antibody, and copurified proteins were detected by western blotting by using anti-SEPA-1 antibody. We found that SEPA-1 was specifically coimmunoprecipitated with anti-PGL-3, but not with the preimmune serum (Figure 5M). Thus, SEPA-1 associates with PGL-3 both in vitro and in embryo extracts. To further investigate the link between SEPA-1 and autophagy, we examined whether SEPA-1 is colocalized with autophagosome structures. The GFP::LGG-1 reporter has been widely used to visualize autophagosomes in C. elegans, as it binds to autophagic membranes (Melendez et al., 2003Melendez A. Talloczy Z. Seaman M. Eskelinen E.L. Hall D.H. Levine B. Autophagy genes are essential for dauer development and life-span extension in C. elegans.Science. 2003; 301: 1387-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). GFP::LGG-1 has diffuse cytoplasmic distribution in embryos with some areas of punctate staining (Figure 6A). When animals carrying both sepa-1::rfp and gfp::lgg-1 transgenes were examined, 94% of SEPA-1 aggregates (n = 34) were colocalized with GFP::LGG-1 dots (Figures 6A–6C). GFP::LGG-1 dots that did not show SEPA-1::RFP signal may correspond to autophagosomes that were involved in the degradation of other substrates. To study how SEPA-1 is recruited to autophagosome structures, we performed in vivo coimmunoprecipitation experiments to examine whether SEPA-1 interacts with LGG-1, whose mammalian homolog LC3 has been shown to associate with p62 in mediating its degradation (Pankiv et al., 2007Pankiv S. Clausen T.H. Lamark T. Brech A. Bruun J.A. Outzen H. Øvervatn A. Bjørkøy G. Johansen T. p62/SQSTM1 binds directly to Atg8/LC3 to facilitate degradation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates by autophagy.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24131-24145Crossref PubMed Scopus (2924) Google Scholar). Extracts from embryos expressing the gfp::lgg-1 reporter were precipitated with anti-GFP antibody, and the resulting immunoprecipitates were subjected to western blotting by using anti-SEPA-1 antibody. We found that SEPA-1 was specifically coimmunoprecipitated by anti-GFP antibody (Figure 6D). In vitro pull-down assays were performed to examine whether SEPA-1 directly interacts with LGG-1. We found that SEPA-1 bound to LGG-1, but not to ATG-18 (Figure 6E). By using a series of SEPA-1 fragments, we found that the SEPA-1 fragment containing amino acids 289 to 575, which is distinct from the PGL-3 interaction domain, strongly bound to LGG-1 (Figure 6E). Thus, SEPA-1 could be recruited to autophagosomes through its direct interaction with LGG-1. In addition to sepa-1, we isolated three alleles of the same genetic locus, bp438, bp439, and bp458, that suppressed the formation of somatic PGL-1-positive granules in atg-18 and lgg-1 mutants (Figure 2K and data not shown). Subsequent genetic and molecular analysis demonstrated that these are new alleles of pgl-3. In pgl-3 atg-18 and lgg-1; pgl-3 mutants, PGL-1-positive granules in somatic cells were almost undetectable. Concomitantly, GFP::PGL-1 was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm (Figure 2K). GFP::PGL-1 also failed to be degraded and was diffusely localized in the cytoplasm of somatic cells from the 2-cell stage onward in pgl-3 single-mutant embryos (Figure 2L). Thus, accumulation of PGL-1 into granules in somatic cells and degradation of PGL-1 by autophagy require PGL-3. In contrast, PGL-1 is not required for the accumulation of PGL-3 into granules in autophagy mutants (data not shown). SEPA-1 still formed aggregates in pgl-1 and pgl-3 mutants, and the number of SEPA-1 aggregates was increased in lgg-1; pgl-1 and lgg-1; pgl-3 mutants (data not shown), indicating that formation of SEPA-1 aggregates and autophagic degradation of SEPA-1 are not dependent on PGL-1 and PGL-3.

Using rodent models of spinal cord injury, we studied involvement of Trpm4 in the progressive expansion of secondary hemorrhage associated with capillary fragmentation, the most destructive mechanism of secondary injury in the central nervous system. Trpm4 mRNA and protein were abundantly upregulated in capillaries preceding their fragmentation and formation of petechial hemorrhages. Trpm4 expression in vitro rendered COS-7 cells highly susceptible to oncotic swelling and oncotic death following ATP depletion. After spinal cord injury, in vivo gene suppression in rats treated with Trpm4 antisense or in Trpm4(-/-) mice preserved capillary structural integrity, eliminated secondary hemorrhage, yielded a threefold to fivefold reduction in lesion volume and produced a substantial improvement in neurological function. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a Trp channel that must undergo de novo expression for manifestation of central nervous system pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2001635171,"Constitutive Hedgehog (Hh) signaling underlies several human tumors, including basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and basaloid follicular hamartoma in skin. Intriguingly, superficial BCCs arise as de novo epithelial buds resembling embryonic hair germs, collections of epidermal cells whose development is regulated by canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Similar to embryonic hair germs, human BCC buds showed increased levels of cytoplasmic and nuclear beta-catenin and expressed early hair follicle lineage markers. We also detected canonical Wnt/ beta-catenin signaling in epithelial buds and hamartomas from mice expressing an oncogene, M2SMO, leading to constitutive Hh signaling in skin. Conditional overexpression of the Wnt pathway antagonist Dkk1 in M2SMO-expressing mice potently inhibited epithelial bud and hamartoma development without affecting Hh signaling. Our findings uncover a hitherto unknown requirement for ligand-driven, canonical Wnt/ beta-catenin signaling for Hh pathway-driven tumorigenesis, identify a new pharmacological target for these neoplasms and establish the molecular basis for the well-known similarity between early superficial BCCs and embryonic hair germs."

However, the nonmitotic functions of Cdc20-APC have remained unexplored. We report that Cdc20-APC plays an essential role in dendrite morphogenesis in postmitotic neurons. Knockdown of Cdc20 in cerebellar slices and in postnatal rats in vivo profoundly impairs the formation of granule neuron dendrite arbors in the cerebellar cortex. Remarkably, Cdc20 is enriched at the centrosome in neurons, and the centrosomal localization is critical for Cdc20-dependent dendrite development. We also find that the centrosome-associated protein histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) promotes the polyubiquitination of Cdc20, stimulates the activity of centrosomal Cdc20-APC, and drives the differentiation of dendrites. These findings define a postmitotic function for Cdc20-APC in the morphogenesis of dendrites in the mammalian brain. The identification of a centrosomal Cdc20-APC ubiquitin signaling pathway holds important implications for diverse biological processes, including neuronal connectivity and plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2082119586,"The endocytosis of AMPA receptors underlies several forms of synaptic plasticity. Here, the authors show that PSD-95, via its binding to AKAP150, is important for NMDAR-triggered endocytosis of synaptic AMPARS. The endocytosis of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) underlies several forms of synaptic plasticity, including NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent long-term depression (LTD), but the molecular mechanisms responsible for this trafficking remain unknown. We found that PSD-95, a major postsynaptic density protein, is important for NMDAR-triggered endocytosis of synaptic AMPARs in rat neuron cultures because of its binding to A kinase–anchoring protein 150 (AKAP150), a scaffold for specific protein kinases and phosphatases. Knockdown of PSD-95 with shRNA blocked NMDAR-triggered, but not constitutive or mGluR-triggered, endocytosis of AMPARs. Deletion of PSD-95's Src homology 3 and guanylate kinase–like domains, as well as a point mutation (L460P), both of which inhibit binding of PSD-95 to AKAP150, also blocked NMDAR-triggered AMPAR endocytosis. Furthermore, expression of a mutant AKAP150 that does not bind calcineurin inhibited this NMDAR-triggered trafficking event. Our results suggest that PSD-95's interaction with AKAP150 is critical for NMDAR-triggered AMPAR endocytosis and LTD, possibly because these scaffolds position calcineurin in the appropriate subsynaptic domain."
https://openalex.org/W2025172485,"The c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway has been implicated in the development of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-dependent hepatitis. JNK may play a critical role in hepatocytes during TNF-stimulated cell death in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we examined the phenotype of mice with compound disruption of the Jnk1 and Jnk2 genes. Mice with loss of JNK1/2 expression in hepatocytes exhibited no defects in the development of hepatitis compared with control mice, whereas mice with loss of JNK1/2 in the hematopoietic compartment exhibited a profound defect in hepatitis that was associated with markedly reduced expression of TNF-α. These data indicate that JNK is required for TNF-α expression but not for TNF-α-stimulated death of hepatocytes. Indeed, TNF-α induced similar hepatic damage in both mice with hepatocyte-specific JNK1/2 deficiency and control mice. These observations confirm a role for JNK in the development of hepatitis but identify hematopoietic cells as the site of the essential function of JNK."

Here the authors report on an mGluR5-mediated depolarization that underlies persistent activity and is sensitive to both dopamine and cocaine. The intrinsic properties of neurons that enable them to maintain depolarized, persistently activated states in the absence of sustained input are poorly understood. In short-term memory tasks, individual prefrontal cortical (PFC) neurons can maintain persistent action potential output during delay periods between informative cues and behavioral responses. Dopamine and drugs of abuse alter PFC function and working memory, possibly by modulating intrinsic neuronal properties. Here we used patch-clamp recording of layer 5 PFC pyramidal neurons to identify a postsynaptic depolarization that was evoked by action potential bursts and mediated by metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5). This depolarization occurred in the absence of recurrent synaptic activity and was reduced by a dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) protein kinase A pathway. After behavioral sensitization to cocaine, the depolarization was substantially diminished and D1R modulation was lost. We propose that burst-evoked intrinsic depolarization is a form of short-term cellular memory that is modulated by dopamine and cocaine experience."

Using 3DPCR it was possible to show that all but A3DE were able to deaminate HBV DNA at levels from 10(-2) to 10(-5)in vitro, with A3A proving to be the most efficient editor. The amino terminal domain of A3G alone was completely devoid of deaminase activity to within the sensitivity of 3DPCR ( approximately 10(-4) to 10(-5)). Detailed analysis of the dinucleotide editing context showed that only A3G and A3H have strong preferences, notably CpC and TpC. A phylogenic analysis of A3 exons revealed that A3G is in fact a chimera with the first two exons being derived from the A3F gene.

https://openalex.org/W2075323902,"In the worm, netrin and the TGFβ-related molecule UNC-129 form opposing dorsoventral gradients. Motor axons are repelled by netrin and attracted to UNC-129, but no TGFβ receptors appear to be involved in the attraction. This study shows that UNC-129 enhances repulsive signaling from the netrin receptor complex UNC-5/UNC-40, via a direct interaction with UNC-5. The UNC-5 receptor mediates axon repulsion from UNC-6/netrin through UNC-40 dependent (UNC-5 + UNC-40) and independent (UNC-5 alone) signaling pathways. It has been shown that UNC-40–dependent signaling is required for long-range repulsion of UNC-6/netrin; however, the mechanisms used to regulate distinct UNC-5 signaling pathways are poorly understood. We found that the C. elegans transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) family ligand UNC-129, graded opposite to UNC-6/netrin, functions independent of the canonical TGF-β receptors to regulate UNC-5 cellular responses. Our observations indicates that UNC-129 facilitates long-range repulsive guidance of UNC-6 by enhancing UNC-5 + UNC-40 signaling at the expense of UNC-5 alone signaling through interaction with the UNC-5 receptor. This increases the set point sensitivity of growth cones to UNC-6/netrin as they simultaneously migrated up the UNC-129 gradient and down the UNC-6 gradient. Similar regulatory interactions between oppositely graded extracellular cues may be a common theme in guided cell and axon migrations."

Protein phosphorylation of IRS-1 Ser(636/639), Akt Ser(473), mTOR-Ser(2448), and S6K-Thr(389) were measured by Western blot with signal intensity measured by immunofluorescence.Cells exposed to 100 nM of insulin had increased IRS-1 Ser(636/639) and Akt Ser(473) phosphorylation. Cells pre-exposed to low-dose testosterone had significantly increased insulin-induced mTOR-Ser(2448) and S6K-Thr(389) phosphorylation (p<0.05), and further increased insulin-induced IRS-1 Ser(636/639) phosphorylation (p = 0.042) compared to control cells.

https://openalex.org/W2074680809,"Both prolactin (PRL) and estrogen (E2) are involved in the pathogenesis and progression of mammary neoplasia, but the mechanisms by which these hormones interact to exert their effects in breast cancer cells are not well understood. We show here that PRL is able to activate the unliganded estrogen receptor (ER). In breast cancer cells, PRL activates a reporter plasmid containing estrogen response elements (EREs) and induces the ER target gene pS2. These actions are blocked by the antagonist ICI 182,780, showing that ER is required for the PRL-mediated effect. Moreover, PRL leads to phosphorylation of ERα in serine-118 (P-ERα), a modification related to the potentiation of ligand-independent transcriptional activation. In addition, PRL mimics the effect of E2 on target gene expression by inducing cyclical recruitment of ERα and P-ERα to ERE-containing promoters, resulting in recruitment of co-activators and acetylation of histone H3. Finally, PRL induces expression of c-Myc and Cyclin D1 and leads to increased cell proliferation, which is specifically antagonized by ICI 182,780 or ERα depletion. These results show that ligand-independent ERα activation appears to be an important component of the proliferative and transcriptional actions of PRL in breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2044984965,"In a classical view of development, a cell can acquire positional information by reading the local concentration of a morphogen independently of its neighbors. Accordingly, in Drosophila, the morphogen Wingless produced in the wing's prospective distal region activates target genes in a dose-dependent fashion to organize the proximodistal pattern. Here, we show that, in parallel, Wingless triggers two nonautonomous inhibitory programs that play an important role in the establishment of positional information. Cells flanking the source of Wingless produce a negative signal (encoded by notum) that inhibits Wingless signaling in nearby cells. Additionally, in response to Wingless, all prospective wing cells produce an unidentified signal that dampens target gene expression in surrounding cells. Thus, cells influence each other's response to Wingless through at least two modes of lateral inhibition. Without lateral inhibition, some cells acquire ectopic fates. Lateral inhibition may be a general mechanism behind the interpretation of morphogen gradients."
https://openalex.org/W2001901796,"Background The intestine is responsible for absorbing dietary lipids and delivering them to the organism as triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL). It is important to determine how this process is regulated in enterocytes, the absorptive cells of the intestine, as prolonged postprandial hypertriglyceridemia is a known risk factor for atherosclerosis. During the postprandial period, dietary lipids, mostly triglycerides (TG) hydrolyzed by pancreatic enzymes, are combined with bile products and reach the apical membrane of enterocytes as postprandial micelles (PPM). Our aim was to determine whether these micelles induce, in enterocytes, specific early cell signaling events that could control the processes leading to TRL secretion. Methodology/Principal Findings The effects of supplying PPM to the apex of Caco-2/TC7 enterocytes were analyzed. Micelles devoid of TG hydrolysis products, like those present in the intestinal lumen in the interprandial period, were used as controls. The apical delivery of PPM specifically induced a number of cellular events that are not induced by interprandial micelles. These early events included the trafficking of apolipoprotein B, a structural component of TRL, from apical towards secretory domains, and the rapid, dose-dependent activation of ERK and p38MAPK. PPM supply induced the scavenger receptor SR-BI/CLA-1 to cluster at the apical brush border membrane and to move from non-raft to raft domains. Competition, inhibition or knockdown of SR-BI/CLA-1 impaired the PPM-dependent apoB trafficking and ERK activation. Conclusions/Significance These results are the first evidence that enterocytes specifically sense postprandial dietary lipid-containing micelles. SR-BI/CLA-1 is involved in this process and could be a target for further study with a view to modifying intestinal TRL secretion early in the control pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2034963767,"The cell wall of M. tuberculosis is central to its success as a pathogen. Mycolic acids are key components of this cell wall. The genes involved in joining the α and mero mycolates are located in a cluster, beginning with Rv3799c and extending at least until Rv3804c. The role of each enzyme encoded by these five genes is fairly well understood, except for Rv3802c. Rv3802 is one of seven putative cutinases encoded by the genome of M. tuberculosis. In phytopathogens, cutinases hydrolyze the waxy layer of plants, cutin. In a strictly mammalian pathogen, such as M. tuberculosis, it is likely that these proteins perform a different function. Of the seven, we chose to focus on Rv3802c because of its location in a mycolic acid synthesis gene cluster, its putative essentiality, its ubiquitous presence in actinomycetes, and its conservation in the minimal genome of Mycobacterium leprae. We expressed Rv3802 in Escherichia coli and purified the enzymatically active form. We probed its activities and inhibitors characterizing those relevant to its possible role in mycolic acid biosynthesis. In addition to its reported phospholipase A activity, Rv3802 has significant thioesterase activity, and it is inhibited by tetrahydrolipstatin (THL). THL is a described anti-tuberculous compound with an unknown mechanism, but it reportedly targets cell wall synthesis. Taken together, these data circumstantially support a role for Rv3802 in mycolic acid synthesis and, as the cell wall is integral to M. tuberculosis pathogenesis, identification of a novel cell wall enzyme and its inhibition has therapeutic and diagnostic implications."
https://openalex.org/W2044092945,"Background Accurate measurement of peripheral tissue perfusion is challenging but necessary to diagnose peripheral vascular insufficiency. Because near infrared (NIR) radiation can penetrate relatively deep into tissue, significant attention has been given to intravital NIR fluorescence imaging. Methodology/Principal Findings We developed a new optical imaging-based strategy for quantitative measurement of peripheral tissue perfusion by time-series analysis of local pharmacokinetics of the NIR fluorophore, indocyanine green (ICG). Time-series NIR fluorescence images were obtained after injecting ICG intravenously in a murine hindlimb ischemia model. Mathematical modeling and computational simulations were used for translating time-series ICG images into quantitative pixel perfusion rates and a perfusion map. We could successfully predict the prognosis of ischemic hindlimbs based on the perfusion profiles obtained immediately after surgery, which were dependent on the preexisting collaterals. This method also reflected increases in perfusion and improvements in prognosis of ischemic hindlimbs induced by treatment with vascular endothelial growth factor and COMP-angiopoietin-1. Conclusions/Significance We propose that this novel NIR-imaging-based strategy is a powerful tool for biomedical studies related to the evaluation of therapeutic interventions directed at stimulating angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2031383107,"PRDM genes are a family of transcriptional regulators that modulate cellular processes such as differentiation, cell growth and apoptosis. Some family members are involved in tissue or organ maturation, and are differentially expressed in specific phases of embryonic development. PRDM5 is a recently identified family member that functions as a transcriptional repressor and behaves as a putative tumor suppressor in different types of cancer. Using gene expression profiling, we found that transcriptional targets of PRDM5 in human U2OS cells include critical genes involved in developmental processes, and specifically in regulating wnt signaling. We therefore assessed PRDM5 function in vivo by performing loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments in zebrafish embryos. Depletion of prdm5 resulted in impairment of morphogenetic movements during gastrulation and increased the occurrence of the masterblind phenotype in axin+/- embryos, characterized by the loss of eyes and telencephalon. Overexpression of PRDM5 mRNA had opposite effects on the development of anterior neural structures, and resulted in embryos with a shorter body axis due to posterior truncation, a bigger head and abnormal somites. In situ hybridization experiments aimed at analyzing the integrity of wnt pathways during gastrulation at the level of the prechordal plate revealed inhibition of non canonical PCP wnt signaling in embryos overexpressing PRDM5, and over-activation of wnt/beta-catenin signaling in embryos lacking Prdm5. Our data demonstrate that PRDM5 regulates the expression of components of both canonical and non canonical wnt pathways and negatively modulates wnt signaling in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2052907252,"Accumulating evidence indicates that Reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with Kazal motifs (RECK), a membrane-anchored matrix metalloproteinase regulator, plays crucial roles in mammalian development and tumor suppression. Its mechanisms of action at the single cell level, however, remain largely unknown. In mouse fibroblasts, RECK is abundant around the perinuclear region, membrane ruffles and cell surface. Cells lacking Reck show decreased spreading, ambiguous anterior–posterior (AP) polarity, and increased speed and decreased directional persistence in migration; these characteristics are also found in transformed fibroblasts and fibrosarcoma cells with low RECK expression. RECK-deficient cells fail to form discrete focal adhesions, have increased levels of GTP-bound Rac1 and Cdc42, and a marked decrease in the level of detyrosinated tubulin, a hallmark of stabilized microtubules. RECK-deficient cells also show elevated gelatinolytic activity and decreased fibronectin fibrils. The phenotype of RECK-deficient cells is largely suppressed when the cells are plated on fibronectin-coated substrates. These findings suggest that RECK regulates pericellular extracellular matrix degradation, thereby allowing the cells to form proper cell–substrate adhesions and to maintain AP polarity during migration; this mechanism is compromised in malignant cells."
https://openalex.org/W2147994474,"Chk1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is activated by a wide range of DNA-damaging agents to slow the cell cycle during S phase and G2/M. Abrogation of these cell-cycle checkpoints using Chk1 inhibitors results in hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents in vitro and may provide a potential therapeutic tool to sensitize tumour cells in vivo. We have generated a Cre-Lox-based mouse model in which Chkl can be inducibly deleted from somatic epithelial cells in the adult mouse small intestine and liver. Loss of Chk1 in the liver is tolerated with no apparent phenotype. In contrast, the loss of Chk1 within the small intestine results in immediate DNA damage and high levels of p53-independent apoptosis leading to crypt death. However, the intestine is able to compensate for this death by undergoing complete re-population with Chk1-proficient cells. These data therefore show that Chk1 deficiency is cell lethal, but the intestine can tolerate such lethality at the organ level."
https://openalex.org/W2156956838,"Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), a negative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway, is one of the most frequently mutated/deleted tumor suppressor genes in human cancers. The aim of this study was to gain insight into the role played by PTEN in intestinal homeostasis and epithelial cell function. Using the Cre/loxP system, we have generated a mouse with a conditional intestinal epithelial Pten deficiency. Pten mutant mice and controls were sacrificed for histology, immunofluorescence, Western blot, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. Our results show that loss of epithelial Pten leads to an intestinalomegaly associated with an increase in epithelial cell proliferation. Histological analysis demonstrated significant perturbation of the crypt-villus architecture, a marked increase in goblet cells and a decrease in enteroendocrine cells, suggesting a role for Pten in the commitment of the multipotential-secretory precursor cell. Loss of epithelial Pten does not result in induction of nuclear beta-catenin protein levels, nor is it sufficient to promote tumorigenesis initiation. However, it severely enhances intestinal tumor load in Apc(Min/+) mice, in which c-Myc is already deregulated. These results reveal an unknown function for Pten signaling in the commitment of multipotential-secretory progenitor cells and suggest that epithelial Pten functions as a modifier gene in intestinal neoplasia."
https://openalex.org/W2093372036,"We have previously shown that Singleminded-2s (SIM2s), a member of the basic helix-loop-helix Per-Arnt-Sim (bHLH/PAS) family of transcription factors, is downregulated in breast cancer samples and has tumor suppressor activity. However, the mechanism by which SIM2s is repressed in breast cancer cells has not been determined. In this study, we show that transformation of MCF10A cells by Harvey-Ras (Ha-Ras) induces CCAAT/enhance binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta) and activates the NOTCH signaling pathway to block SIM2s gene expression. NOTCH-mediated repression acts through a C-repeat binding factor 1 (CBF1)-independent mechanism, as introduction of CBF1 had no effect on SIM2s expression. Consistent with C/ebpbeta-dependent inhibition of SIM2s, C/ebpbeta(-/-) mouse mammary glands express high levels of SIM2s and reestablishment of C/ebpbeta isoforms decreased SIM2s mRNA levels in C/ebpbeta immortalized mammary epithelial cell lines. These studies illustrate a novel pathway of tumor suppressor gene silencing in Ha-Ras-transformed breast epithelial cells and identify SIM2s as a target of C/EBPbeta and NOTCH signaling."

https://openalex.org/W2019883815,"Background Many men suffering from stress, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), report sexual dysfunction, which is traditionally treated via psychological counseling. Recently, we identified a gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) system in the lumbar spinal cord that is a primary mediator for male reproductive functions. Methodology/Principal Findings To ask whether an acute severe stress could alter the male specific GRP system, we used a single-prolonged stress (SPS), a putative rat model for PTSD in the present study. Exposure of SPS to male rats decreases both the local content and axonal distribution of GRP in the lower lumbar spinal cord and results in an attenuation of penile reflexes in vivo. Remarkably, pharmacological stimulation of GRP receptors restores penile reflexes in SPS-exposed males, and induces spontaneous ejaculation in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, although the level of plasma testosterone is normal 7 days after SPS exposure, we found a significant decrease in the expression of androgen receptor protein in this spinal center. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that the spinal GRP system appears to be a stress-vulnerable center for male reproductive functions, which may provide new insight into a clinical target for the treatment of erectile dysfunction triggered by stress and psychiatric disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2040348171,"Histone deacetylases (HDACs) play a key role in the regulation of gene expression and chromatin structure, and drugs targeting these enzymes might have an important impact in the treatment of human cancer. Herein, we report the characterization of (1H)-pyrroles as a new subfamily of HDAC inhibitors obtained by computational modeling of class-I human HDACs. From a functional standpoint, (1H)-pyrroles are powerful inductors of acetylation of histones H3 and H4, and restore the expression of growth-inhibitory genes. From a cellular view, these compounds cause a marked decrease in the viability of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, associated with a cell-cycle arrest at G2/M and an inhibition of angiogenesis. Thus, (1H)-pyrroles emerge as a novel group of HDAC inhibitors with promising antitumoral features."
https://openalex.org/W2120071583,"Genetically susceptible rodents exposed to low nontoxic levels of inorganic mercury (Hg(2+)) develop idiosyncratic autoimmune disease associated with defective T-cell function. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain mostly unexplained. Brief exposure of T cells to micromolar concentrations of Hg(2+) leads to physiologically relevant nontoxic cellular mercury burdens, and as we have previously reported, attenuates T-cell receptor (TCR) signal strength by approximately 50%. We have found this to be the result of an inadequate activation of the tyrosine kinase ZAP-70, which is hypophosphorylated following TCR stimulation in Hg(2+) burdened cells when compared to untreated controls. In T cells, ZAP-70 phosphorylation is dependent on lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (Lck) activity, which in turn is either positively or negatively regulated by the phosphorylation of specific Lck tyrosine residues. In particular, the general belief is that Lck is negatively regulated by phosphorylation of tyrosine 192 (Y192). We now demonstrate by Western blotting that, in Jurkat T cells, TCR signal transduction (and ZAP-70 phosphorylation) was positively associated with a rapid transient phosphorylation of Y192, which was inhibited in cells that were briefly (5 min) exposed to 5 microM Hg(2+). Thus, Hg(2+) inhibits a critical activating role played by Lck Y192 during the most proximal events of the TCR-induced cell signaling."
