https://openalex.org/W2141233619,"We describe a simple process for the fabrication of ultrathin, transparent, optically homogeneous, electrically conducting films of pure single-walled carbon nanotubes and the transfer of those films to various substrates. For equivalent sheet resistance, the films exhibit optical transmittance comparable to that of commercial indium tin oxide in the visible spectrum, but far superior transmittance in the technologically relevant 2- to 5-micrometer infrared spectral band. These characteristics indicate broad applicability of the films for electrical coupling in photonic devices. In an example application, the films are used to construct an electric field–activated optical modulator, which constitutes an optical analog to the nanotube-based field effect transistor."
https://openalex.org/W2068288454,"Aberrant alpha-synuclein degradation is implicated in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis because the protein accumulates in the Lewy inclusion bodies associated with the disease. Little is known, however, about the pathways by which wild-type alpha-synuclein is normally degraded. We found that wild-type alpha-synuclein was selectively translocated into lysosomes for degradation by the chaperone-mediated autophagy pathway. The pathogenic A53T and A30P alpha-synuclein mutants bound to the receptor for this pathway on the lysosomal membrane, but appeared to act as uptake blockers, inhibiting both their own degradation and that of other substrates. These findings may underlie the toxic gain-of-function by the mutants."
https://openalex.org/W2122075752,"The high catalytic activity of gold clusters on oxides has been attributed to structural effects (including particle thickness and shape and metal oxidation state), as well as to support effects. We have created well-ordered gold mono-layers and bilayers that completely wet (cover) the oxide support, thus eliminating particle shape and direct support effects. High-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy and carbon monoxide adsorption confirm that the gold atoms are bonded to titanium atoms. Kinetic measurements for the catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide show that the gold bilayer structure is significantly more active (by more than an order of magnitude) than the monolayer."
https://openalex.org/W1825286732,"Many people voluntarily incur costs to punish violations of social norms. Evolutionary models and empirical evidence indicate that such altruistic punishment has been a decisive force in the evolution of human cooperation. We used H 2 15 O positron emission tomography to examine the neural basis for altruistic punishment of defectors in an economic exchange. Subjects could punish defection either symbolically or effectively. Symbolic punishment did not reduce the defector's economic payoff, whereas effective punishment did reduce the payoff. We scanned the subjects' brains while they learned about the defector's abuse of trust and determined the punishment. Effective punishment, as compared with symbolic punishment, activated the dorsal striatum, which has been implicated in the processing of rewards that accrue as a result of goal-directed actions. Moreover, subjects with stronger activations in the dorsal striatum were willing to incur greater costs in order to punish. Our findings support the hypothesis that people derive satisfaction from punishing norm violations and that the activation in the dorsal striatum reflects the anticipated satisfaction from punishing defectors."
https://openalex.org/W2120127728,"As the interface between hippocampus and neocortex, the entorhinal cortex is likely to play a pivotal role in memory. To determine how information is represented in this area, we measured spatial modulation of neural activity in layers of medial entorhinal cortex projecting to the hippocampus. Close to the postrhinal-entorhinal border, entorhinal neurons had stable and discrete multipeaked place fields, predicting the rat's location as accurately as place cells in the hippocampus. Precise positional modulation was not observed more ventromedially in the entorhinal cortex or upstream in the postrhinal cortex, suggesting that sensory input is transformed into durable allocentric spatial representations internally in the dorsocaudal medial entorhinal cortex."
https://openalex.org/W1633737559,"Although the electrical integration of chemically synthesized nanowires has been achieved with lithography, optical integration, which promises high speeds and greater device versatility, remains unexplored. We describe the properties and functions of individual crystalline oxide nanoribbons that act as subwavelength optical waveguides and assess their applicability as nanoscale photonic elements. The length, flexibility, and strength of these structures enable their manipulation on surfaces, including the optical linking of nanoribbon waveguides and other nanowire elements to form networks and device components. We demonstrate the assembly of ribbon waveguides with nanowire light sources and detectors as a first step toward building nanowire photonic circuitry."
https://openalex.org/W2148393559,"The electromagnetic field of visible light performs ∼10 15 oscillations per second. Although many instruments are sensitive to the amplitude and frequency (or wavelength) of these oscillations, they cannot access the light field itself. We directly observed how the field built up and disappeared in a short, few-cycle pulse of visible laser light by probing the variation of the field strength with a 250-attosecond electron burst. Our apparatus allows complete characterization of few-cycle waves of visible, ultraviolet, and/or infrared light, thereby providing the possibility for controlled and reproducible synthesis of ultrabroadband light waveforms."
https://openalex.org/W2042717571,"We evaluated the commercial and recreational fishery landings over the past 22 years, first at the national level, then for populations of concern (those that are overfished or experiencing overfishing), and finally by region. Recreational landings in 2002 account for 4% of total marine fish landed in the United States. With large industrial fisheries excluded (e.g., menhaden and pollock), the recreational component rises to 10%. Among populations of concern, recreational landings in 2002 account for 23% of the total nationwide, rising to 38% in the South Atlantic and 64% in the Gulf of Mexico. Moreover, it affects many of the most-valued overfished species—including red drum, bocaccio, and red snapper—all of which are taken primarily in the recreational fishery."
https://openalex.org/W1988697869,"Group A streptococci, a common human pathogen, secrete streptokinase, which activates the host's blood clot-dissolving protein, plasminogen. Streptokinase is highly specific for human plasminogen, exhibiting little or no activity against other mammalian species, including mouse. Here, a transgene expressing human plasminogen markedly increased mortality in mice infected with streptococci, and this susceptibility was dependent on bacterial streptokinase expression. Thus, streptokinase is a key pathogenicity factor and the primary determinant of host species specificity for group A streptococcal infection. In addition, local fibrin clot formation may be implicated in host defense against microbial pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W1974785254,"Electricity was produced by catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO) by using gold catalysts at room temperature. The observed rates are faster than conventional processes operating at 500 kelvin or higher for the conversion of CO with water to produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide through the water-gas shift (WGS). By eliminating the WGS reaction, we remove the need to transport and vaporize liquid water in the production of energy for portable applications. This process can use CO-containing gas streams from the catalytic reforming of hydrocarbons to produce an aqueous solution of reduced polyoxometalate compounds that can be used to generate power. The reduced polyoxometalate can be reoxidized in fuel cells that contain simple carbon anodes."
https://openalex.org/W2054027245,"The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway is known to be activated under diabetic conditions and to possibly be involved in the progression of insulin resistance. In this study, we examined the effects of modulation of the JNK pathway in liver on insulin resistance and glucose tolerance. Overexpression of dominant-negative type JNK in the liver of obese diabetic mice dramatically improved insulin resistance and markedly decreased blood glucose levels. Conversely, expression of wild type JNK in the liver of normal mice decreased insulin sensitivity. The phosphorylation state of crucial molecules for insulin signaling was altered upon modification of the JNK pathway. Furthermore, suppression of the JNK pathway resulted in a dramatic decrease in the expression levels of the key gluconeogenic enzymes, and endogenous hepatic glucose production was also greatly reduced. Similar effects were observed in high fat, high sucrose diet-induced diabetic mice. Taken together, these findings suggest that suppression of the JNK pathway in liver exerts greatly beneficial effects on insulin resistance status and glucose tolerance in both genetic and dietary models of diabetes.

Taken together, these findings suggest that suppression of the JNK pathway in liver exerts greatly beneficial effects on insulin resistance status and glucose tolerance in both genetic and dietary models of diabetes. The hallmark of type 2 diabetes is insulin resistance and pancreatic β-cell dysfunction (1Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar, 2Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3842) Google Scholar). Normal β-cells can compensate for insulin resistance by increasing insulin secretion, but insufficient compensation leads to the onset of glucose intolerance. Once hyperglycemia becomes apparent, insulin sensitivity is further reduced, and β-cell function progressively deteriorates (3Weir G.C. Laybutt D.R. Kaneto H. Bonner-Weir S. Sharma A. Diabetes. 2001; 50: S154-S159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Various studies have demonstrated that hyperglycemia is the direct cause of these phenomena, collectively called “glucose toxicity” (4Robertson R.P. Zhang H.-J. Pyzdrowski K.L. Walseth T.F. J. Clin.

Indeed, it was shown that insulin resistance is substantially decreased in mice homozygous for a targeted mutation in the JNK gene (14Hirosumi J. Tuncman G. Chang L. Gorgun C.Z. Uysal K.T. Maeda K. Karin M. Hotamisligil G.S. Nature. 2002; 420: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (2593) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we reported recently that JNK activation is involved in the reduction of insulin gene expression by oxidative stress and that suppression of the JNK pathway can protect β-cells from glucose toxicity (18Kaneto H.

Thus, it is likely that JNK is a crucial mediator of the progression of insulin resistance as well as β-cell dysfunction found in type 2 diabetes. Here we report that suppression of the JNK pathway in the liver improves insulin resistance in the whole body and markedly ameliorates glucose intolerance in diabetic mice.MATERIALS AND METHODSPreparation of Recombinant Adenoviruses—Recombinant adenoviruses expressing wild type (WT) and dominant-negative type (DN) JNK were prepared using the AdEasy system (kindly provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein, the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center) (33He T.-C. Zhou S. DaCosta L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3229) Google Scholar). In brief, the encoding region of WT- and DN-JNK (K55R) was cloned into a shuttle vector pAdTrack-CMV, and to allow for homologous recombination, the linearized plasmid containing WT- or DN-JNK and the adenoviral backbone plasmid, pAdEasy-1, were introduced into electrocompetent Escherichia coli BJ5183 cells. The linearized plasmids were transfected into the adenovirus packaging cell line 293 using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen), and the adenovirus titers were increased up to 1 × 108 plaque-forming units (PFU)/ml in the 293 cells. Control adenovirus expressing green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP) was prepared in the same manner. Adenovirus titers were further increased up to 1 × 1010 PFU/ml using the Adeno-X™ virus purification kit (Clontech). Virus titers were estimated using the Adeno-X™ titer kit (Clontech).Animals and Administration of Recombinant Adenoviruses—Male C57BL6 and C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice were purchased from Japan SLC (Hamamatsu, Japan). Mice (8 weeks old) were injected with Ad-WT-JNK, Ad-DN-JNK, or Ad-GFP (1 × 1010 PFU/ml for Ad-WT-JNK and 2 × 109 PFU/ml for Ad-DN-JNK) from the cervical vein. After adenovirus injection, blood glucose levels were measured regularly with a portable glucose meter (Glu-test Sensor, Sanwa, Japan) after tail snipping. For measurement of serum insulin levels, blood samples of mice after a 6-h fast were collected into heparinized capillary tubes, and serum insulin levels were determined with the Insulin-EIA test kit (Glazyme).Glucose Tolerance Tests—After a 6-h fast, mice were injected intraperitoneally with glucose (2.0 g/kg of body weight). Blood samples were taken at various time points (0–120 min), and blood glucose levels and serum insulin levels were determined as described above.Insulin Tolerance Tests—After a 6-h fast, mice were injected intraperitoneally with insulin (2.0 units/kg for C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice). Blood samples were taken at various time points (0–90 min), and blood glucose levels were measured as described above.Euglycemic Hyperinsulinemic Clamp—Fourteen days before the clamp study, Ad-WT-JNK (1 × 1010 PFU/ml) or Ad-DN-JNK (2 × 109 PFU/ml) was injected from the left jugular vein. Three days before the clamp study, a silicon catheter (Phicon Tube, Fuji-Systems, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted into the right jugular vein under general anesthesia with sodium pentobarbital. The catheter, which is required for infusion in the clamp study, was exteriorized at the back of the neck through a subcutaneous tunnel and filled with heparinized saline (200 units/ml). Clamp studies were performed on mice under conscious and unstressed conditions after a 6-h fast. A euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp with a tracer dilution method was applied to determine peripheral glucose uptake and endogenous glucose production. Experiments consisted of a 120-min euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp period (15 pmol of regular human insulin/kg/min for C57BL6 mice and 27 pmol/kg/min for C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice during the 120-min clamp period). During this period, blood glucose levels were monitored every 5 min, and the rate of 50% glucose containing 10% [6,6-2H2]glucose infusion into the jugular vein was adjusted to maintain blood glucose concentrations at 120 ± 10 mg/dl.Measurement of Endogenous Hepatic Glucose Production (HGP) by Stable Isotope-labeled Glucose Enrichment—To estimate HGP, stable isotope-labeled glucose enrichment was determined. Blood samples were taken at 90, 105, and 120 min, and 20 μl of each plasma sample were deproteinized with 60 μl of 99.5% ethanol. The supernatant was evaporated, and the residue was derivatized by the following procedure. First, 7.5 μl of N-methyl-bis(trifluoroacetamide) (MBTFA, Pierce) and 7.5 μl of pyridine were added to the residue, and the mixture was heated for 1 h at 60 °C. The reaction product (1 μl) containing trifluoroacetylated glucose was then analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (model TSQ-700, Finningan-MAT, San Jose, CA) with a silicon SE-30 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm inner diameter, Gasukuro Kogyo, Tokyo, Japan). The trifluoroacetyl derivative of glucose was separated from the other compounds by gas chromatography and was analyzed by electron impact mass spectrometry at 70 eV. The fragment ion peaks of unlabeled glucose and [6,6-2H2]glucose were measured at a mass/electrical charge (m/e) of 319 and 321, respectively.Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell extracts obtained from liver were fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a reinforced cellulose nitrate membrane (Optitran BA-S85, Schleicher & Schuell). After blocking, the membranes were incubated at 4 °C overnight in TBS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl) containing a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit anti-IRS-1, anti-IRS-1-Ser(P)-307 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-Akt, or anti-Akt-Ser(P)-473 antibody (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature in TBS containing a 1:1000 dilution of anti-rabbit IgG antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by incubation with LumiGLO (Cell Signaling) and exposed to light-sensitive film.Northern Blot Analysis—Ten μg of total RNA isolated from freeze-clamped liver tissues were electrophoresed on 1.0% formaldehyde-denatured agarose gel in 1× MOPS running buffer and then transferred overnight to a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (Glc-6-Pase) cDNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Rediprime labeling system kit (Amersham Biosciences). After overnight hybridization with a 32P-labeled probe at 42 °C, the membranes were washed in 2× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA (SSPE), 0.1% SDS at 42 °C. The probed membranes were exposed to an imaging plate, BAS-MS 2040 (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan), and the hybridization intensity was quantified using a BAS2500 system (Fujifilm).Diet Study—Six-week-old male mice (C57BL6) were divided at random into two groups. One group was fed a high fat, high sucrose diet (AIN93G, Oriental Yeast, Suita, Japan), and the other was fed standard laboratory mouse chow (Clea Japan, Tokyo, Japan) for 4 weeks.Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Differences between groups were examined for statistical significance using the Student's t test or analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the Fisher's test.RESULTSActivation of the JNK Pathway in the Liver Decreases Insulin Sensitivity in C57BL6 Mice—To examine the effects of JNK overexpression in the liver on insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in non-diabetic animals, we prepared WT-JNK-expressing adenovirus (Ad-WT-JNK) and control adenovirus (Ad-GFP) and delivered each adenovirus to 8-week-old C57BL6 mice from the cervical vein. It is noted that this Ad-WT-JNK expressed GFP as well as WT-JNK. As shown in Fig. 1A, a marked increase in JNK expression was observed in the liver, but not in other tissues such as muscle and adipose tissue. The left panel of Fig. 1A shows a representative liver after exposure to Ad-WT-JNK. As seen by the GFP fluorescence, many cells in the liver were infected with the adenovirus. There was no difference in body weight and food intake between the two groups (data not shown), and nonfasting blood glucose concentrations in Ad-WT-JNK-treated mice were also comparable with those in Ad-GFP-treated mice (Fig. 1B). Next, to examine the effect of WT-JNK overexpression in the liver on glucose tolerance, we performed the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT). As shown in Fig. 1C, there was no difference in glucose tolerance between Ad-GFP-treated and Ad-WT-JNK-treated mice. Fasting serum insulin concentrations in Ad-WT-JNK-treated mice were higher than those in Ad-GFP-treated mice at the compatible fasting blood glucose levels (Fig. 1D), indicating that JNK overexpression increases insulin resistance. To investigate this point further, we performed the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp test. As shown in the left panel of Fig. 1E, in the clamp study, the steady-state glucose infusion rate (GIR) in Ad-WT-JNK-treated C57BL6 mice was significantly lower than that in Ad-GFP-treated mice (58.0 ± 6.8 versus 73.7 ± 3.2 mg/kg/min, p < 0.05, n = 6), indicating that activation of the JNK pathway in the liver reduces insulin sensitivity in C57BL6 mice. Furthermore, we evaluated endogenous HGP in Ad-WT-JNK-treated mice using tracer methods. As shown in the right panel of Fig. 1E, HGP in Ad-WT-JNK-treated mice was significantly greater than that in Ad-GFP-treated mice (18.2 ± 3.1 versus 6.4 ± 3.3 μmol/kg/min, p < 0.05, n = 6). In contrast, there was no difference in glucose disappearance rate between the two groups, which reflects glucose utilization in the peripheral tissues (data not shown). These results indicate that overexpression of JNK decreases insulin sensitivity mainly by increasing HGP in control mice. On the other hand, although JNK is well known to be involved in the immune response and regulation of apoptosis, hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed no morphological changes in the liver after WT-JNK overexpression (data not shown), indicating that the increase in insulin resistance induced by WT-JNK overexpression is not because of the induction of apoptosis in the liver.Suppression of the JNK Pathway in the Liver Markedly Reduces Insulin Resistance and Ameliorates Glucose Tolerance in C57BL/KsJ-db/db Mice—To examine the effect of suppression of the JNK pathway in the liver on insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in diabetic animals, we prepared DN-JNK-expressing adenovirus (Ad-DN-JNK) and control adenovirus (Ad-GFP) and delivered each adenovirus via the cervical vein to 8-week-old C57BL/KsJ-db/db obese diabetic mice. There was no difference in body weight and food intake between the two groups (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2A, when C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice were treated with Ad-DN-JNK, nonfasting blood glucose levels were markedly reduced from 405 ± 42 mg/dl to 211 ± 30 mg/dl (2 weeks after adenovirus injection), whereas no such effect was observed in Ad-GFP-treated mice. Fasting blood glucose concentrations (after a 6-h fast) were also lower in Ad-DN-JNK-treated mice compared with Ad-GFP-treated mice, although there was no difference in serum insulin concentrations between these two groups (Fig. 2B). To examine the effect of suppression of JNK activity in the liver on insulin resistance, we performed the intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test (IPITT). As shown in Fig. 2C, the hypoglycemic response to insulin was larger in Ad-DN-JNK-treated C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice compared with Ad-GFP-treated mice. To investigate this point further, we performed the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp test. As shown in Fig. 2D, in the clamp study, the GIR in Ad-DN-JNK-treated mice was around 2-fold higher than that in Ad-GFP-treated mice (20.8 ± 2.4 versus 10.1 ± 2.6 mg/kg/min, p < 0.05, n = 6), indicating that suppression of the JNK pathway in the liver reduces insulin resistance and thus ameliorates glucose tolerance in C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice. Furthermore, hepatic glucose production was significantly lower in Ad-DN-JNK-treated mice compared with Ad-GFP-treated mice (24.0 ± 4.2 versus 38.0 ± 3.9 μmol/kg/min, p < 0.05, n = 6) (Fig. 2D). In contrast, there was no difference in the glucose disappearance rate between these two groups (data not shown). These results indicate that reduction of insulin resistance and amelioration of glucose tolerance by DN-JNK overexpression are mainly a result of suppression of hepatic glucose production.Fig. 2Effects of adenoviral DN-JNK overexpression in the liver on insulin resistance and glucose tolerance in C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice.A, nonfasting blood glucose levels in C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice treated with Ad-DN-JNK or Ad-GFP (2 × 109 PFU/ml). After infection with the adenovirus, nonfasting blood glucose levels were measured for 25 days. B, fasting blood glucose and serum insulin levels 2 weeks after infection with Ad-DN-JNK or Ad-GFP. C, insulin resistance in C57BL6 mice treated with Ad-DN-JNK or Ad-GFP. Two weeks after Ad-DN-JNK or Ad-GFP treatment, intraperitoneal insulin tolerance tests were performed. After a 6-h fast, insulin was injected intraperitoneally at a dose of 2.0 units/kg of body weight, and blood glucose levels were measured. D, GIR and endogenous HGP in C57BL6 mice treated with Ad-DN-JNK or Ad-GFP. Two weeks after the adenovirus infection, GIR and HGP were estimated with an euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. *, p < 0.05, n = 6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Next, we examined whether Ad-DN-JNK exerts some effect on glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in non-diabetic C57BL6 mice. In contrast to C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice, there was no difference in fasting blood glucose levels between Ad-GFP-treated and Ad-DN-JNK-treated C57BL6 mice; after a 6-h fast, blood glucose levels in Ad-GFP-treated and Ad-DN-JNK-treated C57BL6 mice were 148 ± 9 mg/dl and 151 ± 8 mg/dl, respectively. Also there was no difference in the IPGTT between Ad-GFP-treated and Ad-DN-JNK-treated C57BL6 mice. Next, to evaluate the effect on insulin sensitivity, we measured fasting serum insulin levels. After a 6-h fast, serum insulin levels in Ad-GFP-treated and Ad-DN-JNK-treated C57BL6 mice were almost the same at 0.7 ± 0.4 ng/ml and 0.8 ± 0.4 ng/ml, respectively. Furthermore, to evaluate the effect of Ad-DN-JNK on insulin sensitivity in non-diabetic mice, we performed the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp test in C57BL6 mice. In contrast to C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice, there was no difference in the GIR between Ad-GFP-treated and Ad-DN-JNK-treated C57BL6 mice (73.7 ± 3.2 versus 73.4 ± 4.7 mg/kg/min, n = 5). These results are consistent with the idea that Ad-DN-JNK suppresses the JNK pathway, which is activated under diabetic conditions and thus leads to a decrease of insulin resistance and amelioration of glucose tolerance.Alteration of Insulin Action in the Liver via the JNK Pathway Is Associated with the Phosphorylation Status of Insulin Signaling Molecules and Expression of Gluconeogenic Enzymes—It has been reported that serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 inhibits insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, leading to an increase in insulin resistance (14Hirosumi J.

To explore the molecular mechanisms involved in the alteration of insulin actions via the JNK pathway, we evaluated IRS-1 serine 307 phosphorylation in the liver of Ad-WT-JNK-treated C57BL6 mice. As shown in Fig. 3A, IRS-1 serine 307 phosphorylation was increased in Ad-WT-JNK-treated mice compared with Ad-GFP-treated mice. We also found a decrease in IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in Ad-WT-JNK-treated mice compared with Ad-GFP-treated mice. Furthermore, a decrease in Akt serine 473 phosphorylation was observed in Ad-WT-JNK-treated C57BL6 mice compared with Ad-GFP-treated mice. Similarly, we examined the molecular mechanisms involved in the reduction of insulin resistance by DN-JNK overexpression in the liver. As shown in Fig. 3A, IRS-1 serine 307 phosphorylation was markedly decreased in Ad-DN-JNK-treated mice compared with Ad-GFP-treated mice. We also found an increase in IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in Ad-DN-JNK-treated mice compared with control mice. Reduction of Akt serine 473 phosphorylation was observed in Ad-DN-JNK-treated C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice compared with Ad-GFP-treated mice. Therefore, an increase in IRS-1 serine phosphorylation may be closely associated with the development of insulin resistance induced by JNK overexpression.Fig. 3Effects of WT- and DN-JNK overexpression on insulin signaling and gluconeogenesis in the liver.A, Ad-WT-JNK or Ad-GFP was injected into C57BL6 mice, and Ad-DN-JNK or Ad-GFP was injected into C57BL6 mice. Two weeks after the adenovirus infection, expressions of total and serine-phosphorylated forms (Ser-307) of IRS-1 were examined with Western blot analysis, and the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of IRS-1 was examined with immunoprecipitation. Expressions of total and serine-phosphorylated forms of Akt (Ser-473) were also examined with Western blot analysis. Similar results were obtained with at least three independent experiments. B, two weeks after the adenovirus infection, mRNA levels of the key gluconeogenic enzymes, PEPCK and Glc-6-Pase, were examined by Northern blot analysis. *, p < 0.05, n = 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Next, we examined the expression levels of the key gluconeogenic enzymes, PEPCK and Glc-6-Pase, both of which are known to be regulated by insulin signaling. As shown in Fig. 3B, expression levels of both enzymes, Glc-6-Pase and PEPCK, were significantly increased by Ad-WT-JNK treatment in C57BL6 mice. In contrast, expression levels of both enzymes were markedly decreased by Ad-DN-JNK treatment in C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice. These results indicate that suppression of the JNK pathway enhances insulin signaling, which leads to a decrease in gluconeogenesis and amelioration of glucose tolerance.Suppression of the JNK Pathway in the Liver Improves High Fat, High Sucrose Diet-induced Insulin Resistance and Glucose Tolerance—Because it is well known that a high fat and high sucrose diet induces insulin resistance, we fed C57BL6 mice a high fat, high sucrose diet and examined whether suppression of the JNK pathway has any effect on high fat, high sucrose diet-induced insulin resistance. There was no difference in body weight and food intake between the two groups (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 4A, nonfasting blood glucose gradually became lower 2–3 weeks after the challenge in the DN-JNK-treated mice. Four weeks after starting the high fat, high sucrose diet, nonfasting blood glucose and insulin concentrations were significantly lower in Ad-DN-JNK-treated mice compared with Ad-GFP-treated mice (nonfasting blood glucose of 115 ± 12 versus 157 ± 7 mg/dl, p < 0.05; insulin concentration of 8.2 ± 1.5 versus 10.0 ± 1.2 ng/ml) (Fig. 4B). To further investigate this point, we performed the IPGTT. As shown in Fig. 4C, blood glucose levels in Ad-DN-JNK-treated mice were significantly lower compared with those of Ad-GFP-treated mice. These results indicate that suppression of the JNK pathway in the liver improves insulin resistance and glucose tolerance induced by a high fat, high sucrose diet. Taken together, our results show that suppression of the JNK pathway in the liver improves insulin resistance and ameliorates glucose tolerance in two different diabetic animal models with insulin resistance, C57BL/KsJ-db/db diabetic mice (Fig. 2) and high fat, high sucrose diet-induced diabetic mice (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Effects of adenoviral DN-JNK overexpression in liver on insulin resistance and glucose tolerance in C57BL6 mice treated with a high fat, high sucrose diet.A, nonfasting blood glucose levels in C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice treated with Ad-DN-JNK or Ad-GFP (2 × 109 PFU/ml). After infection with the adenovirus, nonfasting blood glucose levels were measured for 4 weeks. B, fasting blood glucose and serum insulin levels 4 weeks after infection with Ad-DN-JNK or Ad-GFP. C, glucose tolerance in C57BL6 mice treated with Ad-DN-JNK or Ad-GFP. Four weeks after Ad-DN-JNK or Ad-GFP treatment, IPGTTs were performed. After a 6-h fast, glucose was injected intraperitoneally at a dose of 2.0 g/kg of body weight, and blood glucose levels were measured. *, p < 0.05, n = 6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn this study, we show that activation of the JNK pathway in the liver using WT-JNK adenovirus increases insulin resistance and that, in contrast, suppression of the JNK pathway using DN-JNK adenovirus decreases insulin resistance and markedly improves glucose tolerance in two different diabetic animal models with insulin resistance. These results suggest that the JNK pathway could be a potential therapeutic target for diabetes (Fig. 5). In addition, while it is well known that various insulin target tissues such as adipose tissue and muscle as well as the liver are involved in the progression of insulin resistance, in our study insulin resistance of the whole body in db/db mice was markedly improved by DN-JNK overexpression only in the liver, although there was no difference in glucose disappearance rate. These results suggest that JNK activation in the liver plays a pivotal role in causing insulin resistance and glucose tolerance in the whole body.Fig. 5Possible mechanism for JNK-mediated insulin resistance and glucose tolerance.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The JNK pathway is known to be activated by several factors such as oxidative stress, free fatty acids (FFAs), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), all of which are known to be increased under diabetic conditions.

https://openalex.org/W2049094182,"The AML1-ETO fusion protein, generated by the t(8;21) chromosomal translocation, is causally involved in nearly 15% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases. This study shows that AML1-ETO, as well as ETO, inhibits transcriptional activation by E proteins through stable interactions that preclude recruitment of p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP) coactivators. These interactions are mediated by a conserved ETO TAF4 homology domain and a 17–amino acid p300/CBP and ETO target motif within AD1 activation domains of E proteins. In t(8;21) leukemic cells, very stable interactions between AML1-ETO and E proteins underlie a t(8;21) translocation-specific silencing of E protein function through an aberrant cofactor exchange mechanism. These studies identify E proteins as AML1-ETO targets whose dysregulation may be important for t(8;21) leukemogenesis, as well as an E protein silencing mechanism that is distinct from that associated with differentiation-inhibitory proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1493908201,"In the past two decades, a large body of evidence has established a causative role for the beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, recent debate has focused on whether amyloid fibrils or soluble oligomers of Abeta are the main neurotoxic species that contribute to neurodegeneration and dementia. Considerable early evidence has indicated that amyloid fibrils are toxic, but some recent studies support the notion that Abeta oligomers are the primary neurotoxins. While this crucial aspect of AD pathogenesis remains controversial, effective therapeutic strategies should ideally target both oligomeric and fibrillar species of Abeta. Here, we describe the anti-amyloidogenic and neuroprotective actions of some di- and tri-substituted aromatic compounds. Inhibition of the formation of soluble Abeta oligomers was monitored using a specific antibody-based assay that discriminates between Abeta oligomers and monomers. Thioflavin T and electron microscopy were used to screen for inhibitors of fibril formation. Taken together, these results led to the identification of compounds that more effectively block Abeta oligomerization than fibrillization. It is significant that such compounds completely blocked the neurotoxicity of Abeta to rat hippocampal neurons in culture. These findings provide a basis for the development of novel small molecule Abeta inhibitors with potential applications in AD."
https://openalex.org/W1965110077,"The insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) is crucial for many functions in neoplastic cells, for example, antiapoptosis. Recently, we demonstrated that the cyclolignan PPP efficiently inhibited phosphorylation of IGF-1R without interfering with insulin receptor activity. PPP preferentially reduced phosphorylated Akt, as compared to phosphorylated Erk1/2, and caused apoptosis. Now, we aimed to investigate how PPP inhibits the IGF-1R tyrosine kinase (IGF-1RTK) and the PI3K/Akt apoptotic pathway. Using a baculovirus driven IGF-1RTK we found that PPP interfered with tyrosine phosphorylation in the activation loop of the kinase domain. Specifically, it blocked phosphorylation of tyrosine (Y) 1136, while sparing the two others (Y1131 and Y1135). To explore the impact of inhibition of Y1136 on Akt phosphorylation we transfected P6 cells (overexpressing IGF-1R) and malignant melanoma cells with different IGF-1R mutants, including Y1136F (tyrosine replaced by phenylalanine). Y1136F was found to strongly decrease IGF-1 stimulated phosphorylation of Akt. Conversely, Akt phosphorylation was weakly affected in the Y1131F transfectant. Taken together, our data suggest that the preferential inhibition of phosphorylated Akt, after PPP treatment, may be due to specific inhibition of Y1136. PPP was proven not to interfere directly with Akt or any of its downstream molecules in the apoptotic pathway."

Permeability is regulated by a variety of growth factors and cytokines and plays a role in numerous physiological and pathological processes. We examined a potential role for the p21-activated kinase (PAK) in the regulation of vascular permeability. In both bovine aortic and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, PAK is phosphorylated on Ser141 during the activation downstream of Rac, and the phosphorylated subfraction translocates to endothelial cell-cell junctions in response to serum, VEGF, bFGF, TNFα, histamine, and thrombin. Blocking PAK activation or translocation prevents the increase in permeability across the cell monolayer in response to these factors. Permeability correlates with myosin phosphorylation, formation of actin stress fibers, and the appearance of paracellular pores. Inhibition of myosin phosphorylation blocks the increase in permeability. These data suggest that PAK is a central regulator of endothelial permeability induced by multiple growth factors and cytokines via an effect on cell contractility. PAK may therefore be a suitable drug target for the treatment of pathological conditions where vascular leak is a contributing factor, such as ischemia and inflammation.

The endothelial cell monolayer lining the vasculature forms a barrier that maintains the integrity of the blood fluid compartment but permits passage of soluble factors and leukocytes in a regulated manner. Dysregulation of this process produces vascular leakage into underlying tissues, which accompanies the inflammation associated with pathological conditions involving edema (reviewed in Refs. 1Suzuki Y.

Vascular permeability is characterized by altered cell-cell contacts and the appearance of paracellular pores between adjacent cells. Integrity of the endothelial barrier is regulated in part by opposing roles of the actin cytoskeleton in which cortical F-actin stabilizes cell-cell contacts, whereas intracellular stress fibers exert tension to induce permeability (reviewed in Refs. 6Bogatcheva N.

In epithelial and endothelial cell types, Rac is important for both the assembly of adherens and tight junctions and for their disruption during cell scattering or in response to agonists that trigger permeability (8Takaishi K.

Precise temporal and spatial regulation of Rac and its effector pathways are likely to be critical for determining the balance between strengthening and disrupting cell-cell adhesions. However, the downstream pathways that govern these effects are poorly understood. The p21-activated kinases (PAKs) are serine/threonine kinases activated downstream of Rac and Cdc42 that participate in multiple cellular functions, including motility, morphogenesis, and angiogenesis (13Bokoch G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 743-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). GTP-bound Rac and Cdc42 bind to inactive PAK, releasing steric constraints imposed by a PAK autoinhibitory domain and permitting PAK auto-phosphorylation and activation. Numerous autophosphorylation sites have been identified that serve as markers for activated PAK (14Zenke F.T. King C.C. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol.

In endothelial cells, expression of catalytically active PAK1 increased MLC phosphorylation and cell contractility, whereas inhibiting PAK reduced cell contractility (23Kiosses W.B. Daniels R.H.

Thus, in these cells, the dominant effect of PAK appears to be the promotion of contractility. In this study, the observation that PAK phosphorylated on Ser141 strongly localized to cell-cell junctions prompted us to examine a possible effect on monolayer permeability. We found that PAK plays a key role in the induction of permeability by a wide variety of growth factors and cytokines and that cell contractility mediates these effects.

E, confluent BAEC on Transwell 3.0-μm filters were starved in medium with 0.5% serum for 18 h and then treated without (white bars) or with 25 ng/ml VEGF (black bars) and with vehicle only (vehicle) or with 1.0, 2.5, or 5.0 μm ML7 for 60 min. Permeability was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Monolayer Permeability and Paracellular Pore Formation Assays— Cells were plated onto FN-coated polycarbonate membranes (3.0-μ pore size; Transwell, Costar) at 6 × 104 cells/cm2 and cultured for 4 days with medium changes every other day until confluence was reached. Where indicated, cells in normal growth medium with 10% serum were transfected 36 h before the assays. For experiments using a PAK-blocking or control peptide, medium in the upper chamber was replaced with medium containing peptides for 60 min before the experiment; control cell chambers received replacement medium containing vehicle only. In experiments using growth factors or other stimulants, medium containing those additions was added to the upper chambers for 30–60 min, as indicated. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP, Sigma) was then added to the upper chambers at a final concentration of 1.5 μg/ml. After 20 min, the filters were removed and immediately fixed in 3.5% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. Medium was harvested from the lower chamber, and HRP activity was determined colorimetrically by absorbance at 490 nm to detect the O-phenylenediamine reaction product after 15 min of incubation with 0.5 mm guaiacol, 50 mm Na2HPO4, and 0.6 mm H2O2. The mean HRP concentration in the lower chamber medium from cells in variously treated wells was normalized to the HRP concentration in the control wells transfected with vector only or treated with vehicle only, and the results were graphed as means ± S.E. of 4–7 experiments. To quantify paracellular pore formation and correlate to permeability, the fixed cell monolayer-covered filters were stained for 2 h with Coomassie Blue (0.25% in 1:1:2 of methanol:glacial acetic acid:double distilled (dd)H2O), destained in the same solution minus dye, rinsed in ddH2O, and air-dried. Stained cell monolayers were examined by phase-contrast microscopy and the number of pores/mm2 of filter surface counted in eight randomly selected fields per filter. These values were normalized to the number of pores in the control cells. Statistical Analysis—For all quantitative assays, data from four to eight experiments were analyzed for statistical significance by analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Student's t test, as appropriate, using SigmaStat analytical software (Jandel Scientific) and are shown graphically as means ± S.E. Photographic or blot images shown are representative of results seen consistently in multiple experiments. PAK Phosphorylation and Translocation to Cell-Cell Junctions—PAK1, -2, and -3 are held in an inactive conformation via an interaction of the kinase domain with a sequence in the regulatory N terminus named the AID (13Bokoch G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 743-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). Binding of activated Rac or Cdc42 to PAK leads to autophosphorylation of several sites that confer sustained increases in PAK kinase activity (16Gatti A. Huang Z. Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8022-8028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 27Chong C. Tan L. Lim L. Manser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17347-17353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). One of these sites, Ser141 in PAK2 (which corresponds to Ser144 in PAK1), is within the AID and its phosphorylation contributes to activation by blocking the interaction of the AID with the kinase domain. To localize activated PAK in endothelial cells, we therefore utilized an antibody that specifically recognizes the phosphorylated Ser141 site. To initially evaluate PAK phosphorylation in endothelial cells in response to serum, confluent bovine aortic and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (BAEC and HUVEC, respectively) were serum-starved (0.5% serum) for 18 h and then stimulated with 10% serum. Western blotting with anti-phospho-PAK Ser141 antibody showed that serum stimulation increased PAK phosphorylation in both cell types (Fig. 1A, upper panels), consistent with previous studies that demonstrated increased PAK kinase activity in endothelial cells treated with serum or growth factors (28Hood J.D. Frausto R. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 933-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Western blots of BAEC lysates using an antibody specific for PAK phosphorylated at Thr423 confirmed the results seen with the phospho-Ser141 antibody (Fig. 1A, lower panels). Fluorescence staining of similarly treated cells with anti-phospho-PAK Ser141 (pPAK) also showed an increase in PAK phosphorylation in response to serum, with the activated fraction of the protein localized mainly to cell-cell junctions (Fig. 1B). Staining with an antibody that recognizes the total pool of PAK1, -2, and -3 (Fig. 1B, tot PAK) also showed an increase in the staining at cell-cell borders plus a large amount of diffuse cytoplasmic fluorescence that presumably represents the unphosphorylated fraction. The phosphorylated PAK antigenic peptide blocked staining by the phospho-PAK antibody (Fig. 1, +serum, Ab+AP), demonstrating that the pattern is specific. Taken together, these data show that PAK is autophosphorylated on Ser141 in response to serum and that the phosphorylated fraction localizes specifically to cell-cell contacts. Rac Regulation of PAK Phosphorylation—To confirm these results and evaluate the involvement of Rac upstream of PAK activation, BAEC were transiently transfected to overexpress wild-type PAK1 (Fig. 2, PAK1), constitutively active T423E PAK1 (acPAK), dominant negative (H83R/H86R/H299R) PAK1 (dnPAK), constitutively active V12Rac (acRac), or a dominant negative N17Rac (dnRac). Green fluorescent protein vector was included in all transfections, and transfection efficiency for these experiments was ∼30–35%, when green fluorescent protein expressors were scored under a low power objective (although this value is probably an underestimate because lower expressors may be missed). Transfected cells were serum-starved for 18 h and then treated with 10% serum for 2 h or left untreated. Western blots of cell lysates were probed with the phospho-PAK Ser141 antibody (pPAK), total PAK antibody (tot PAK), or phospho-PAK antibody in the presence of the antigenic phosphopeptide (pPAK+AP) (Fig. 2). Cells expressing wtPAK1 had increased levels of Ser141 phosphorylation, which was further increased after serum stimulation. The active PAK mutant showed higher phosphorylation, which was not further affected by serum. DnPAK transfection reduced levels of phospho-PAK even in the presence of serum. Active Rac also increased PAK phosphorylation both with and without serum, whereas dnRac suppressed PAK phosphorylation. Efficient blocking by the antigenic phosphopeptide demonstrates the specificity of the phospho-PAK antibody. These results suggest that Rac is the major upstream regulator of PAK activation under these conditions. Effect of a PAK Function-blocking Peptide—Previous work mapped the inhibitory sequences responsible for the dominant negative effects of kinase-dead PAK in endothelial cells to the first proline-rich repeat that mediates binding to the SH3 domain of Nck (23Kiosses W.B. Daniels R.H. Otey C. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 831-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). A synthetic peptide in which this sequence was fused to the polybasic sequence from the human immunodeficiency virus Tat protein to facilitate cell entry had a very similar effect, reducing endothelial cell motility and contractility (26Kiosses W.B. Hood J. Yang S. Gerritsen M.E. Cheresh D.A. Alderson N. Schwartz M.A. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The peptide did not appear to inhibit PAK kinase activity but did prevent its translocation to sites of action, which, in those studies with cells at low density, were actin stress fibers. We therefore asked whether this peptide might also limit pPAK translocation to cell-cell borders. BAECs and HUVECs were incubated with either the PAK-blocking peptide or the control peptide in which two critical prolines are mutated to prevent binding to SH3 domains. Western blots of lysates from these cells (Fig. 3A) showed that neither peptide altered PAK phosphorylation with or without serum, consistent with published data (26Kiosses W.B. Hood J. Yang S. Gerritsen M.E. Cheresh D.A. Alderson N. Schwartz M.A. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Staining of similarly treated BAECs (Fig. 3B) showed that the PAK-blocking peptide (+PAK pep) inhibited phospho-PAK translocation to cell-cell junctions in response to serum. Instead, greater phospho-PAK staining was observed in the cytosol and nucleus. The control peptide (+con pep) had no effect, and similar results were obtained with HUVECs (not shown). The PAK peptide therefore abrogates localization of phospho-PAK to cell-cell contacts in endothelial cells. PAK Regulates Monolayer Permeability—Junctional localization of phosphorylated and presumably activated PAK suggested a possible role in regulation of permeability across the endothelial monolayer. To test this idea, BAECs and HUVECs grown on filters with 3.0-μm pores were transiently transfected with wtPAK1, active or dnPAK, or active or dnRac. Movement of HRP across the filters was then measured. Overexpression of wtPAK1 increased HRP movement >2-fold in both cell types, whereas both active PAK and active Rac increased movement by greater amounts (Fig. 4A). The PAK-blocking peptide (Fig. 4A, black bars) strongly inhibited this increase in permeability, whereas the control peptide (gray bars) had no statistically significant effects. These data identify a role for PAK in the regulation of junctional permeability in endothelial cells. Growth Factor and Cytokine-stimulated Permeability— Vascular permeability is regulated by a variety of soluble cytokines and factors. VEGF is one such factor (4Paul R. Zhang Z. Eliceiri B. Jiang Q. Boccia A. Zhang R. Chopp M. Cheresh D. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 5Weis S. Shintani S. Weber A. Kirchmair R. Wood M. Cravens A. McSharry H. Iwakura A. Yoon Y.-S. Himes N. Burstein D. Doukas J. Soll R. Losordo D. Cheresh D. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 885-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar); similarly, bFGF, histamine, thrombin, and TNFα also increase vascular permeability. We therefore examined the effect of the PAK inhibitory peptide on permeability induced by these agents. The addition of VEGF induced a 2–3-fold increase in movement of HRP across the endothelial monolayer, which was almost completely blocked by the PAK peptide (gray bars) in BAEC and HUVEC (Fig. 4B). The control peptide (black bars) had no detectable effect. These effects correlated with the accumulation of phospho-S141 PAK at cell-cell contacts (Fig. 5). To confirm this result, cells were transiently transfected with a construct coding for AID from PAK1 (Fig. 4C). Although control empty vector (black bars) had no significant effect, the AID construct (gray bars) efficiently blocked VEGF-induced permeability. The other cytokines tested had similar effects on permeability, which were also blocked by the inhibitory PAK peptide and the AID (Fig. 4, B and C). These results show that PAK activity is required for induction of vascular leak by VEGF and other factors. Role of Contractility—The results with the PAK AID were surprising in that transfection efficiencies were below 50%, and yet the increase in permeability was almost completely inhibited. In considering possible explanations for this result, we recalled that myosin-dependent contractility is well known to regulate cell-cell junctions and permeability across endothelial or epithelial monolayers"
https://openalex.org/W1998394852,"Black tea improves endothelial function in patients with coronary artery disease. We sought to determine the responsible components of black tea and elucidate the underlying cell signaling mechanisms. We exposed porcine aortic endothelial cells to components of black tea and found that the polyphenol fraction acutely enhanced nitric oxide bioactivity. This effect involved endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation at Ser-1177 and dephosphorylation at Thr-495, consistent with increased eNOS activity. These effects were calcium-dependent, as removal of extracellular calcium prevented eNOS phosphorylation at Ser-1177, whereas inhibition of intracellular calcium mobilization with TMB-8 blunted Thr-495 dephosphorylation. Black tea polyphenol-induced eNOS activation appeared dependent upon the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt pathway, as it was significantly inhibited by LY294002 and a dominant negative Akt, respectively. Pharmacological inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) with either SB202190 or SB203580 as well as overexpression of a dominant negative p38 MAPKα attenuated both eNOS activation and phosphorylation changes in response to black tea polyphenols. Inhibition of p38 MAPKα also blunted Akt activation in response to black tea polyphenols, suggesting that p38α MAPK is upstream of Akt in this pathway. Finally, a constitutively active mutant of MKK6bE, an upstream kinase for p38 MAPK, enhanced both the basal and stimulated activity of Akt, leading to increased eNOS activity.

The general appreciation that oxidative stress is involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases has prompted interest in natural classes of antioxidants. One such class of natural antioxidants is the flavonoid family, a group of polyphenolic substances found mainly in fruit, vegetables, wine, and tea (1Duffy S.J. Vita J.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2003; 14: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Being the second most consumed beverage world-wide aside from water, tea has become a subject of many epidemiological studies, suggesting an inverse relationship between tea consumption and cardiovascular diseases (for review, see Ref 2Higdon J.V. Frei B. Crit. Rev. Food Sci. Nutr. 2003; 43: 89-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar). One proposed mechanism for the benefit of such dietary flavonoids is their antioxidant properties that include the scavenging of reactive oxygen species (3Robak J. Gryglewski R.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 837-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar) and the inhibition of lipid peroxidation (4van Acker F.A. Schouten O. Haenen G.R. van der Vijgh W.J. Bast A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). This latter property of flavonoids suggests they may inhibit low density lipoprotein oxidation, an event implicated in atherosclerosis (5Boullier A. Bird D.A. Chang M.K. Dennis E.A. Friedman P. Gillotre-Taylor K. Horkko S. Palinski W. Quehenberger O. Shaw P. Steinberg D. Terpstra V. Witztum J.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 947: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). However, clinical studies in healthy human subjects indicate that tea flavonoids have a limited impact on this process ex vivo (6Princen H.M. Van Duyvenvoorde W. Buytenhek R. Blonk C. Tijburg L.B.

Opin. Lipidol. 2003; 14: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar and 7Vita J.A. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 3293S-3297SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Normally, the endothelium regulates vasomotor tone, platelet activity, leukocyte adhesion, and vascular smooth muscle proliferation via the release of several paracrine factors, including nitric oxide (NO) 1The abbreviations used are: NO, nitric oxide; eNOS, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase; PAEC, porcine aortic endothelial cells; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPK, MAP kinase; MAPKAPK-2, MAPK-activated protein kinase 2; MKK6, MAPK kinase 6; MKK6bE, recombinant adenovirus-expressing activated MKK6; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GSK3, glycogen synthase kinase 3; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PSS, physiologic salt solution; l-NAME, l-nitro-arginine methyl ester; IBMX, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine; PI 3-K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; TBS, Tris-buffered saline.1The abbreviations used are: NO, nitric oxide; eNOS, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase; PAEC, porcine aortic endothelial cells; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPK, MAP kinase; MAPKAPK-2, MAPK-activated protein kinase 2; MKK6, MAPK kinase 6; MKK6bE, recombinant adenovirus-expressing activated MKK6; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GSK3, glycogen synthase kinase 3; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PSS, physiologic salt solution; l-NAME, l-nitro-arginine methyl ester; IBMX, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine; PI 3-K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; TBS, Tris-buffered saline.

These functions of the endothelium are impaired in the setting of atherosclerosis and its associated vascular diseases (8Widlansky M.E. Gokce N. Keaney Jr., J.F. Vita J.A. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2003; 42: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). Moreover, individuals with the greatest impairment of endothelial function are at the greatest risk of cardiovascular events (9Gokce N. Keaney Jr., J.F. Hunter L.M. Watkins M.T. Nedeljkovic Z.S. Menzoian J.O. Vita J.A. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2003; 41: 1769-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar), suggesting that endothelial dysfunction is, in part, responsible for the clinical activity of atherosclerosis. In this regard, we have found that endothelial NO bioactivity is enhanced in patients with atherosclerosis by either the acute or chronic administration of black tea (10Duffy S.J. Keaney Jr., J.F. Holbrook M. Gokce N. Swerdloff P.L. Frei B. Vita J.A. Circulation. 2001; 104: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The purpose of the current investigation was to determine the components of black tea responsible for this effect and to elucidate the underlying cell signaling events involved in the effect of black tea.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—M-199 medium, l-glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin, and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were obtained from Invitrogen. We obtained LY294002, SB202190, SB203580, p38 inhibitor III, W7 hydrochloride, and TMB-8 hydrochloride from Calbiochem. Polyclonal antibodies directed against Akt, phospho-Akt (Ser-473), phospho-GSK-3α/β (Ser-21/9), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr-180 and Tyr-182), phospho-MAPK-activated protein kinase-2 (phospho-MAPKAPK-2) (Thr-222), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), phospho-ERK (Thr-202 and Tyr-204), and anti-hemagglutinin were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Polyclonal antibodies directed against phospho-eNOS (Thr-495) and phospho-eNOS (Ser-1179) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-eNOS monoclonal antibody was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). l-[3H]arginine (1 mCi; 53mCi/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and cGMP assay kits were from Cayman (Ann Arbor, MI). Black tea polyphenols and black tea fractions were provided by Unilever, Inc. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma.Endothelial Cell Culture—Porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAECs) were harvested and cultured on fibronectin-coated tissue culture flasks in M-199 medium supplemented with 20% FBS, 50 μg/ml heparin sulfate, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For experiments, confluent PAECs were used between passages 4 and 10. Prior to all experiments, PAECs were placed in serum-free and phenol-free media (Opti-MEM, Invitrogen) for 6 h and then washed twice in HEPES-buffered physiologic salt solution (PSS) containing 22 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 124 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 0.16 mm Na2PO4, 0.4 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm NaHCO3, and 5.6 mm d-glucose. Cells were then incubated in HEPES-buffered PSS 30 min prior to the addition of the black tea compounds as indicated.l-[3H]Arginine to l-[3H]Citrulline Conversion Assay—Determination of eNOS catalytic activity in intact PAECs was performed by measurement of the conversion of l-[3H]arginine to l-[3H]citrulline, which was sensitive to l-nitro-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME). Confluent PAECs in 100-mm culture dishes were washed and incubated in PSS for 30 min followed by the addition of 10 μm l-arginine plus 3.3μCi of l-[3H]arginine. PAECs were then treated with the agonist of interest or buffer for 15 min and then washed with PSS and lysed with 200 μl of 100% ethanol, after which 2 ml of stop buffer (20 mm sodium acetate anhydrous, pH 5.5, 1 mm l-citrulline, 2 mm EDTA, and 2 mm EGTA) was added. The lysates was then subjected to anion exchange chromatography using 2-ml Dowex AG50W-X8 columns (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with stop buffer. l-Citrulline was eluted three times with 2 ml of stop buffer, and the eluent was collected for the determination of l-[3H]citrulline by liquid scintillation counting. Data are reported as the extent of conversion of l-[3H]arginine to l-[3H]citrulline that is sensitive to pretreatment of the PAECs for 30 min with l-NAME (500 μm) and is expressed as dpm/106 PAECs.Estimation of Endothelium-derived NO—Confluent PAECs in six-well plates were equilibrated for 30 min in PSS supplemented with 250 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) and 250 μm l-arginine in the absence or presence of l-NAME (500 μm) or the inhibitor of interest. Equilibrated cells were then exposed to the black tea compound or vehicle alone for 30 min before the cells were lysed by the addition of 6% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid. Cell lysates were then subjected to centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and determination of cGMP in supernatants was performed as described previously (11Huang A. Vita J.A. Venema R.C. Keaney Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17399-17406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The cell pellet protein content was determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce) after solubilization with 1 n KOH.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Endothelial cells were washed with PSS and incubated in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 30 min on ice followed by brief sonication. Cell lysates were centrifuged (12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant was either resuspended in loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, and 0.2% bromphenol blue) or used for immunoprecipitation. For eNOS immunoprecipitation, lysates were incubated with eNOS monoclonal antibody (5 μg/ml) rotating for 16 h at 4 °C followed by a 1-h incubation with protein A/G-agarose. Following centrifugation, the immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer, resuspended in loading buffer, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Resolved proteins were transferred at 4 °C to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond; Amersham Biosciences), and the membrane was blocked with 4% nonfat dry milk in TBS-Tween buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 135 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween) for 30 min. Blocked membranes were incubated with primary antibody (1:1000 dilution) in 4% nonfat dry milk in TBS-Tween buffer at 4 °C for 16 h. Membranes were washed with TBS-Tween and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:7500 dilution) in TBS-Tween containing 4% nonfat dry milk. Membranes were washed in TBS-Tween, and proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA).Recombinant Adenoviral Transfection—The recombinant adenoviral vectors expressing dominant negative Akt (T308A and S473A), which cannot be activated by phosphorylation (12Alessi D.R.

The transfection efficiency of the dominant-negative Akt and Myr-Akt was confirmed by immunoblotting for total protein, and transfection of the MKK6bE adenovirus was determined by immunoblotting for the hemagglutinin tag. Transfection of the FLAG-tagged dominant negative isoform of p38 MAPK was assessed by immunoblotting for the FLAG protein. PAECs were infected in medium without FBS for 2 h, washed, and incubated in fresh medium with 10% FBS for 24–36 h prior to experimentation.Statistical Analysis—All numerical data are presented as means ± S.E. Western blots shown are representative of three or more independent experiments. For parametric data, comparisons among treatment groups were performed with one-way analysis of variance and an appropriate post hoc comparison. Instances involving only two comparisons were evaluated with a Student's t test. Instances involving more then two comparisons were evaluated using analysis of variance. Statistical significance was accepted if the null hypothesis was rejected with p < 0.05.RESULTSThe Polyphenolic Fraction of Black Tea Activates eNOS—We first assessed dose- and time-dependent effects of black tea on endothelial NO production by the increase in cellular cGMP content (Fig. 1, A and B). Black tea-induced cGMP accumulation appeared to result from eNOS activation, as it was also characterized by the enhanced conversion of l-[3H]arginine to l-[3H]citrulline and was sensitive to the NOS inhibitor l-NAME (Fig. 1C). Treatment with inactive enantiomer, d-NAME, had no effect on the black tea-induced eNOS activation (data not shown). The effect of black tea was entirely reproduced by the polyphenolic fraction (Fig. 1, C and D) over a physiologic concentration range (∼50–200 ng/ml) (10Duffy S.J. Keaney Jr., J.F. Holbrook M.

Therefore, PAECs were exposed to black tea polyphenols, and eNOS phosphorylation was examined. Under resting conditions, PAECs exhibit little or no phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser-1177 but significant phosphorylation at Thr-495 (Fig. 2A). Treatment with black tea polyphenols resulted in a time-dependent increase in eNOS phosphorylation at Ser-1177 and dephosphorylation at Thr-495 (Fig. 2A), which is consistent with eNOS activation. We next investigated the upstream kinases involved in eNOS phosphorylation in response to black tea polyphenols.Fig. 2Black tea polyphenols induce eNOS and Akt phosphorylation. A, PAECs were treated with black tea polyphenols (100 ng/ml) for the indicated times, cells were lysed, eNOS was immunoprecipitated, and phosphorylation status at Ser-1177 and Thr-495 was assessed by immunoblotting with phosphorylation-specific antibodies. An anti-eNOS monoclonal antibody was used to determine total eNOS in the immunoprecipitates. B, PAECs were treated as described for panel A, and the total lysates were analyzed for the phosphorylation status of Akt (P-Akt; Ser-473), GSK-3α/β (P-GSK-3α; Ser-21/9), and total Akt.

To probe the involvement of Akt, PAECs were treated with black tea polyphenols, and the lysates were assayed for Akt activation using an antibody specific for activated Akt (i.e. phosphorylated at Ser-473). We observed time-dependent activation of Akt by black tea polyphenols, which closely approximated the time course of eNOS phosphorylation at Ser-1177 (Fig. 2B). To specifically address the role of Akt in black tea polyphenol-induced eNOS stimulation, we overexpressed a dominant negative mutant Akt isoform via adenoviral vector transfection. Dominant negative Akt significantly attenuated black tea polyphenol-induced changes in eNOS Ser-1177 phosphorylation (Fig. 3A), and its activation was determined both by the increase in cellular cGMP (Fig 3B) and the conversion of l-[3H] arginine to l-[3H] citrulline (Fig. 3C).Fig. 3Polyphenol-induced eNOS activation involves Akt. A, PAECs were transfected (multiplicity of infection of 50) with an adenovirus containing either dominant negative Akt (dN Akt) LacZ (–) for 24–36 h. PAECs were then equilibrated in PSS for 30 min followed by treatment with 100 ng/ml black tea polyphenols or vehicle for 5 min. The cells were then lysed, eNOS was immunoprecipitated, phosphorylation status was assessed, and total eNOS was detected as described for Fig. 2A. Supernatants were analyzed for phospho-GSK-3α/β (P-GSK3α; Ser-21/9), and total Akt was assessed by immunoblotting. B, PAECs treated as described for panel A were incubated for 30 min in PSS containing 250 μm IBMX and 200 μm l-arginine prior to a 5-min treatment with buffer alone or black tea polyphenols (BTP; 100 ng/ml), and NO bioactivity was determined by cGMP accumulation.

Treatment of PAECs with the PI 3-K inhibitor LY294002 significantly attenuated the black tea polyphenol-induced changes in eNOS phosphorylation and Akt activation (Fig. 4A). This effect had important implications for eNOS activity, because both cellular cGMP accumulation and l-[3H]arginine conversion to l-[3H]citrulline in response to black tea polyphenols were abrogated (Fig. 4, B and C). These data implicate PI 3-K as an upstream signal for both Ser-1177 phosphorylation and Thr-495 dephosphorylation in the response to black tea polyphenols.Fig. 4Black tea polyphenol-induced eNOS activation is PI 3-kinase-dependent.

Kindermann M. Hecker M. Fleming I. Busse R. Clin. Res. 1996; 78: 750-758Google Scholar), we investigated the role of calcium on eNOS activation by black tea polyphenols. Stimulation of PAECs with black tea polyphenols in a calcium-free PSS solution selectively attenuated eNOS Ser-1177 phosphorylation with no effect on Thr-495 dephosphorylation (Fig. 5A). This condition induced only a 2-fold increase in cGMP synthesis (p < 0.05 versus without polyphenols) compared with a 5-fold increase in the presence of extracellular calcium (Fig. 5B; p < 0.05 versus with extracellular calcium). In contrast, inhibition of intracellular calcium release with TMB8 had no impact on Ser-1177 phosphorylation in response to black tea polyphenols and completely abrogated Thr-495 dephosphorylation (Fig. 5A). This condition was associated with a 2.5-fold increase in cGMP (p < 0.05 versus without polyphenols) that was significantly less than that without TMB8 (p < 0.05 versus polyphenols alone; Fig. 5B). The combined inhibition of both intracellular and extracellular calcium transients completely inhibited all responses to black tea polyphenols (Fig. 5B). Thus, both intracellular and extracellular calcium are required for full changes in eNOS phosphorylation and activation in response to black tea polyphenols.Fig. 5The effect of calcium and calmodulin on eNOS activation by black tea polyphenols. A and B, PAECs were incubated for 30 min in PSS with (+) or without (–) CaCl2 (EC Ca2+) or TMB8 as indicated.

Inhibition of calmodulin with W7 had no impact on changes in eNOS phosphorylation induced by black tea polyphenols (Fig. 5C), whereas eNOS activation was completely inhibited as judged by cGMP accumulation (Fig. 5D). Thus, although calmodulin is required for eNOS activation, it is not required for polyphenol-induced changes in eNOS phosphorylation.The Role of p38MAP Kinase in the Response to Black Tea Polyphenols—Previous data implicate MAP kinases in eNOS activation by high density lipoprotein (25Mineo C.

Therefore, we probed lysates with antibodies specific for the activated forms ERK, p38 MAPK, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Lysates from black tea polyphenol-treated PAECs demonstrated rapid phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and its down-stream target, MAPKAPK-2 (Fig. 6A), which was temporally reminiscent of eNOS phosphorylation at Ser-1177 (Fig. 2A). Consistent with this notion, pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK with either SB202190 or SB203580 attenuated polyphenol-induced eNOS phosphorylation on Ser-1177 (Fig. 6B), and eNOS activation was measured by cGMP accumulation (Fig. 6C) and the conversion of l-[3H]arginine to l-[3H]citrulline (Fig. 6D). In contrast, we did not observe any reproducible activation of ERK or c-Jun N-terminal kinase in response to black tea polyphenols (data not shown).Fig. 6Role of p38 MAPK in eNOS activation by black tea polyphenols.

To examine the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance to anoikis in human oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells, we cultured human squamous carcinoma (HSC-3) cells in suspension on plates coated with poly-2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, which blocks access to the ECM. Cells in suspension that formed multicellular aggregates had significantly lower levels of apoptosis than single cells. Aggregates, but not single cells, had high levels of fibronectin. Preincubation with a cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic acid peptide or fibronectin-blocking antibody significantly increased anoikis. Single cells had markedly lower expression of the integrin α<sub>v</sub> receptor than aggregates. Blocking α<sub>v</sub> function with a blocking antibody or by transfection with an antisense oligonucleotide increased apoptosis and inhibited aggregation. In single cells but not aggregates, phosphorylation of the integrin-associated focal adhesion kinase (FAK) at tyrosine 397 was reduced, and p53 levels were increased. Apoptosis was increased by blocking FAK with an antisense oligonucleotide and reduced by blocking p53. These findings show that SCC cells escape suspension-induced anoikis by forming multicellular aggregates that avail themselves of fibronectin survival signals mediated by integrin α<sub>v</sub>. Single cells in suspension that do not form aggregates undergo anoikis because of decreased FAK phosphorylation and increased p53 levels. Thus, SCC cells appear to use neighboring cells and the ECM molecule FN to promote the metastatic phenotype."

The sugar backbone of natural RNAs are also homochiral, but of the D -configuration. Because protein synthesis requires the aminoacylation of RNA, it is this step that could have provided chiral selectivity. Here we show that an RNA minihelix was aminoacylated by an aminoacyl-phosphate- D -oligonucleotide with a clear preference for L - as opposed to D -amino acids. A mirror-image RNA system showed the opposite selectivity. These results suggest the possibility that the selection of L -amino acids for proteins was determined by the stereochemistry of RNA."

Based on sequence similarity, DAL-1/4.1B has been assigned to the Protein 4.1 superfamily whose members interact with plasma membrane proteins through their N-terminal FERM (4.1/Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin) domain, and cytoskeletal components via their C-terminal SAB (spectrin-actin binding) region. Using the DAL-1/4.1B FERM domain as bait for yeast two-hybrid interaction cloning, we identified protein arginine N-methyltransferase 3 (PRMT3) as a specific DAL-1/4.1B-interacting protein. PRMT3 catalyses the post-translational transfer of methyl groups from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to arginine residues of proteins. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments using lung and breast cancer cell lines confirmed this interaction in mammalian cells in vivo. In vitro binding assays demonstrated that this was an interaction occurring via the C-terminal catalytic core domain of PRMT3. DAL-1/4.1B was determined not to be a substrate for PRMT3-mediated methylation but its presence inhibits the in vitro methylation of a glycine-rich and arginine-rich methyl-accepting protein, GST (glutathione-S-transferase-GAR (glycine- and arginine-rich), which contains 14 'RGG' consensus methylation sites. In addition, induced expression of DAL-1/4.1B in MCF-7 breast cancer cells showed that the DAL-1/4.1B protein significantly inhibits PRMT3 methylation of cellular substrates. These findings suggest that modulation of post-translational methylation may be an important mechanism through which DAL-1/4.1B affects tumor cell growth."

 discusses the current research on the tectonic source of the earthquake. Recent evidence suggests that an eastward-dipping subduction zone beneath Gibraltar may have caused the earthquake. Though no interplate earthquakes have been recorded here, evidence from mud volcanoes, seismic images of deformed sediments, and heat flow data suggest that subduction is active and that the seismogenic fault zone may be locked.

In the current study, time-dependent (3 h-11 days) changes in fetal tissue gene expression in a rat model of in utero hypoxia compared with normoxic controls were investigated as an initial approach to understand molecular events underlying fetal development in response to hypoxia. Under hypoxic conditions, litter size was reduced and IGFBP-1 was up-regulated in maternal serum and in fetal liver and heart. Tissue-specific, distinct regulatory patterns of gene expression were observed under acute vs. chronic hypoxic conditions. Induction of glycolytic enzymes was an early event in response to hypoxia during organ development; consistently, tissue-specific induction of calcium homeostasis-related genes and suppression of growth-related genes were observed, suggesting mechanisms underlying hypoxia-related fetal growth restriction. Furthermore, induction of inflammation-related genes in placentas exposed to long-term hypoxia (11 days) suggests a mechanism for placental dysfunction and impaired pregnancy outcome accompanying in utero hypoxia."

Here, we compare a structure-function relationship between two subtype D Tat proteins from patients in Uganda with different rates of disease progression. Structural heterogeneities are revealed by CD, which translate into differing trans-activational and apoptotic effects. CD data analysis and molecular modeling indicate that the short α-helix observed in subtype D Tat proteins from RP patients such as Tat Mal and Tat Ug05RP is not present in Ug11LTS. We show that LTS Tat is less efficient than RP Tat in trans-activation and in inducing apoptosis in T-cells. The glutamine-rich region (region V) of Tat appears to be involved in the Tat-mediated apoptosis of T-cells via mitochondria. Tat Sequences—The Rural Clinical Cohort was established in South West Uganda by the Medical Research Council (United Kingdom) Programme on AIDS in Uganda in 1990 (49Mulder D.W. Nunn A.J. Wagner H.U. Kamali A. Kengeya-Kayondo J.F. AIDS. 1994; 8: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). It was initially composed of prevalent cases of HIV-1 identified by a serosurvey of a larger General Population Cohort. The General Population Cohort continues to be annually serosurveyed, and any persons who have seroconverted to HIV-1-positive are invited to join as incident cases. Patients are invited to attend the study clinic every 3 months, at which time they provide a detailed medical history and undergo a full physical examination and laboratory investigation if required. In this way, the mean time from seroconversion to death has been estimated in this population to be 9.8 years (6Morgan D. Mahe C. Mayanja B. Okongo J.M. Lubega R. Whitworth J.A. AIDS. 2002; 16: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Tat sequences from directly PCR-amplified proviral DNA were obtained from two individuals from this cohort. The estimated date of seroconversion for Ug05RP was July 1993, and death occurred 4.5 years later in January 1998. This compares with Ug11LTS, for which the estimated date of seroconversion was November 1990 and on March 2004 was still at World Heath Organization Stage 2 with a CD4 count in excess of 400 cells/mm3. Protein Synthesis, Purification, and Characterization—The Tat proteins were assembled according to the method of Barany and Merrifield (50Barany G. Merrifield R.B. Gross E. Meinhofer J. The Peptide: Analysis, Synthesis, Biology. 2. Academic Press, Inc., New York1980: 1-284Google Scholar) on (4-(hydroxymethyl)phenoxymethyl)copolystyrene (1% divinylbenzene)-preloaded resin (0.5–0.65 mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) on an ABI 433A automated synthesizer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (51Péloponèse Jr., J.M.

Purification was carried out using a Beckman high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) apparatus with a Beckman C8 reverse-phase column (10 × 150 mm). Buffer A was water with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and Buffer B was acetonitrile (Merck) with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The gradient was buffer B from 15 to 35% over 40 min with a flow rate of 2 ml/min. HPLC analysis was carried out using a Merck Chromolith™ Performance RP-8e (4.6 × 100 mm) with similar buffers but using a gradient from 10 to 50% over 15 min with a flow rate of 1.8 ml/min. Amino acid analyses were performed on a Beckman Model 6300 analyzer, and mass spectrometry was carried out using an Ettan™ MALDI-ToF Pro (Amersham Biosciences). trans-Activation with HIV Long Terminal Repeat-transfected Cells— The trans-activation function of the HIV-1 Tat variants was tested using the human HeLa P4 cells as described previously (51Péloponèse Jr., J.M.

Cells (2 × 105/well) were incubated in 24-well plates (Falcon) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and 100 μg/ml neomycin. After 24 h, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Tat protein was dissolved in phosphate buffer at pH 6 (to avoid precipitation that occurs at neutral pH) and was directly mixed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.01% protamine (Sigma) and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and added to the cells. Two concentrations of Tat (100 and 50 nm) were tested to verify that the level of β-galactosidase was dose-dependent regarding extracellular Tat. After 16 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2, cells were washed with PBS and lysed; the β-galactosidase content was measured with a commercial antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Applied Science); and absorbance values (B) were measured at 405 nm. Results were normalized using Bradford reagent (Sigma). B0 corresponds to the background β-galactosidase expressed by HeLa cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.01% protamine and 0.1% bovine serum albumin without Tat. Apoptosis—The different effects of Tat-induced apoptosis by Ug05RP and Ug11LTS were carried out using Jurkat T-cells. Cells were cultivated in RPMI 1640 medium with Ultraglutamine (Cambrex, East Rutherford, NJ) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Cells were incubated in 24-well flat-bottomed plates (Falcon) at 37 °C with the indicated amounts of Tat as described in the figure legends. To perform cell cycle analysis, cells were harvested at 19 h, fixed in cold methanol, and incubated with 120 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) immediately before analysis. DNA content was measured by flow cytometry using a BD Biosciences FACScan. To detect apoptosis by fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated annexin V staining, cells were harvested at 19 h, and 5 × 105 live cells were incubated with 4 μg/ml FITC-conjugated annexin V and 5 μg/ml propidium iodide for 15 min (annexin V-FITC kit, Bender Medsystems, Vienna, Austria) followed immediately by flow cytometry using the FACScan. Cytogram analysis was performed with Cell Quest Pro® software (BD Biosciences) as described previously (52Carre M. Carles G. Andre N. Douillard S. Ciccolini J. Briand C. Braguer D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 1831-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Cells were distributed into three populations: viable cells (low FITC-conjugated annexin V labeling and low propidium iodide, R4), early apoptotic cells (high FITC-conjugated annexin V labeling and low propidium iodide labeling, R2), and cells that had lost membrane integrity as a result of very late stage apoptosis (high FITC-conjugated annexin V and high propidium iodide labeling, R1). Thus, cells in quadrants R1 and R2 were apoptotic cells. Western Blot Analysis—After treatment with Tat, the culture medium was removed, and cells were washed with cold PBS. HeLa P4 cells were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors) without bovine serum albumin. Lysates were then centrifuged at 4000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. We obtained a cytoplasmic supernatant and a pellet corresponding to the nuclear extract. Jurkat T-cells were lysed for 1 min in digitonin, and cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. All supernatants were stored at -80 °C. Samples (40 μg) were heated at 100 °C for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer containing reducing agent, separated by 15% SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (53Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Biotechnology. 1979; 24: 145-149Google Scholar). Non-specific sites were blocked by a 1-h incubation at room temperature with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, and 10% dried nonfat milk (10% MPBS). Membranes were then incubated with rabbit anti-Tat sera at 1:500 dilution in 10% MPBS, mouse anti-cytochrome c antibody (1:500 dilution in 5% MPBS; Pharmingen), or mouse anti-porin antibody (1:1000 dilution in 5% MPBS; Calbiochem; the levels of the mitochondrial outer membrane porin were systematically measured to ensure that lysis of the mitochondria did not occur during Jurkat T-cell lysis); washed four times; and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit (Sigma) or anti-mouse (Amersham Biosciences) secondary antibody (1: 2000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature in 5% MPBS. The bound horseradish peroxidase was revealed with H2O2 and 0.1% diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Sigma) in PBS as substrate. Bands were analyzed using NIH Image software. Real-time PCR—The different effects of Tat-induced up-regulation of FasL by Ug05RP and Ug11LTS were carried out using Jurkat T-cells. Cells were cultivated as described for the apoptosis assay. Cells (2 × 105/ml) were incubated in 24-well flat-bottomed plates at 37 °C with 2 μm Tat for 19 h. Cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and stored at -80 °C. Total cellular RNA was prepared with a total RNA isolation kit (Macherey-Nagel, Hoerdt, France) in accordance with the manufactur er's directions. 1 μg of total RNA was used for reverse transcription with random primers. FasL mRNA expression in relation to β2-microglobulin expression (internal standard) was determined using the LightCycler system and the FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche Diagnostics). Human-specific primers of the two genes were then designed based on the sequence of each gene as follows: FasL, 5′-GTAGGATTGGGCCTGGGGAT-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGTTGGACTTGCCTGTTAAA-3′ (antisense); and β2-microglobulin, 5′-CCGACATTGAAGTTGACTTAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-ATCTTCAAACCTCCATGATG-3′ (antisense). PCR was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions with 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 μm each primer, 5 μl of sample, and 1-fold LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I mixture in a total volume of 20 μl. The reaction mixture was initially incubated at 95 °C for 10 min to denature the cDNA. Amplification was performed for 45 cycles with the following cycle parameters: 10 s of denaturation at 95 °C, 10 s of primer annealing at 65 °C, and 15 s of fragment elongation at 72 °C. Amplified reverse transcription-PCR products were detected on-line via intercalation of the fluorescent dye. The Light-Cycler was then programmed to carry out a melting cycle to verify the specificity of the desired product. This consisted of a denaturing step at 95 °C, after which the LightCycler cooled to 65 °C and then increased the temperature at a rate of 0.2 °C/s until the temperature reached 95 °C. Fluorescence was acquired every 0.1 °C. The conversion of the melting curves into melting peaks (plot of the negative derivative of fluorescence versus temperature) allowed identification of the specificity of the reaction. Quantification and the melting curve were analyzed with the LightCycler analysis software. All results are expressed as the ratio of the copy number of the target gene to the copy number of β2-microglobulin and were normalized so that FasL expression from Ug05RP-treated cells equals 1.00. Tat-Tubulin Interaction—Lamb brain tubulin was purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation and ion-exchange chromatography, stored in liquid nitrogen, and prepared for use as described (54Weisenberg R.C.

Its concentration was determined in SDS in neutral aqueous buffer with an extinction coefficient of ϵ275 nm = 1.07 liter/g/cm. All experiments were done in PG buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate buffer and 0.1 mm GTP (pH 7.0)) at 25 °C. Fluorescence measurements and uncorrected spectra were obtained with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Model 50 luminescence spectrometer with slit widths of 5 and 10 nm monitored by an IBM PS2 computer. Fluorescence spectra were obtained in PG buffer using 0.2 (excitation direction) × 1-cm cells (Hellma) thermostatted at 25 °C by circulating water from an external water bath. Quenching of the intrinsic tubulin fluorescence signal by Tat was employed to estimate the binding parameters. Tubulin (2 μm) was titrated by various concentrations of Tat. Fluorescence measurements were performed with an excitation wavelength of 295 nm to specifically excite the tryptophan residues. At the concentration used, spectra gave no appreciable inner filter effect (A < 0.05). The changes in fluorescence (ΔF) at 338 nm between the Tat-tubulin complex and Tat (ΔF = Fcomplex - FTat) were plotted versus total Tat concentrations. The curves (ΔFcorr) were inverted and fitted to the saturation curve equation by nonlinear leastsquares regression analysis using the following equation: ΔFcorr = ΔFmax[Tatf]/Kd + [Tatf], where [Tatf] is the free Tat concentration and ΔFmax is the maximum difference in fluorescence. The concentrations of bound Tat ([Tatb]) and free Tat and the dissociation constant (Kd) were determined using the following equation: [Tatb] = 1/2(([Tat0] + [P0] + Kd) - (([Tat0] + [P0] + Kd)2 - 4[P0][Tat0])1/2), where [Tat0] and [P0] are the total Tat and tubulin concentrations, respectively. The algorithm starts with an arbitrary opening set of ΔFmax and Kd values. With"
https://openalex.org/W1966116579,"Tumors have developed several forms of resistance to receptor-induced cell death. Here, we show that malignant mesothelial (MM) cell lines as well as primary MM cells and normal mesothelial (NM) cells express Fas and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors DR4 and DR5. We found that, although Fas expression levels are comparable, only MM cells are resistant to cell death. Furthermore, MM cells show resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Caspase-8 (FLICE) is not activated by death receptors triggering in malignant cells whereas it is well activated by nonreceptor stimuli, such as UV radiation. We found that FLIP (FLICE-Inhibitory Protein) is constitutively expressed in all MM cell lines and is more expressed in primary MM cells than in NM cells. Knockdown of FLIP expression in MM cell lines, by a FLIPsiRNA, re-established the normal response to apoptosis induced by Fas or DR4/DR5, which was blocked by pretreatment with the caspase-8 inhibitor z-IETD-fmk. These results indicate that MM cells develop an intrinsic resistance to apoptosis induced by death receptors upregulating the expression of the antiapoptotic protein c-FLIP."
https://openalex.org/W2058160681,"Lipid phosphates can act as signaling molecules to influence cell division, apoptosis, and migration. wunen and wunen2 encode Drosophila lipid phosphate phosphohydrolases, integral membrane enzymes that dephosphorylate extracellular lipid phosphates. wun and wun2 act redundantly in somatic tissues to repel migrating germ cells, although the mechanism by which germ cells respond is unclear. Here, we report that wun2 also functions in germ cells, enabling them to perceive the wun/wun2 –related signal from the soma. Upon Wun2 expression, cultured insect cells dephosphorylate and internalize exogenously supplied lipid phosphate. We propose that Drosophila germ cell migration and survival are controlled by competition for hydrolysis of a lipid phosphate between germ cells and soma."
https://openalex.org/W2008749541,"Female sexual function is under-studied, and mechanisms of clitoral engorgement-relaxation are incompletely understood. Penile erection results from nitric oxide (NO) -induced cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) accumulation. cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) activates large-conductance, calcium-activated potassium channels (BK(Ca)), thereby hyperpolarizing and relaxing vascular and trabecular smooth muscle cells, allowing engorgement. We hypothesize rat clitorises relax by a similar mechanism. Rat clitorises express components of the proposed pathway: neuronal and endothelial NO synthases, soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), type 5 phosphodiesterase (PDE-5), and BK(Ca) channels. The NO donor diethylamine NONOate (DEANO), the PKG activator 8-pCPT-cGMP, and the PDE-5 inhibitor sildenafil, cause dose-dependent clitoral relaxation that is inhibited by antagonists of PKG (Rp-8-Br-cGMPS) or BK(Ca) channels (iberiotoxin). Electrical field stimulation induces tetrodotoxin-sensitive NO release and relaxation that is inhibited by the Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin or sGC inhibitor 1H-(1,2,4)oxadiozolo(4,3-a)quinoxalin-1-one. Human BK(Ca) channels, transferred to Chinese hamster ovary cells via an adenoviral vector, and endogenous rat clitoral smooth muscle K+ current are activated by this PKG-dependent mechanism. Laser confocal microscopy reveals protein expression of BK(Ca) channels on clitoral smooth muscle cells; these cells exhibit BK(Ca) channel activity that is activated by both DEANO and sildenafil. We conclude that neurovascular derived NO causes clitoral relaxation via a PKG-dependent activation of BK(Ca) channels. The BK(Ca) channel is an appealing target for drug therapy of female erectile dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2097545739,"Neuroimmunomodulation has experienced an explosive growth not only in basic research, but expanding to the point that prospective clinical research could be now a reality. A crucial factor for the functioning of this intimate bidirectional network was the demonstration that the immune and neuroendocrine systems speak a mutual biochemical language. This implies 1) production of neuroendocrine hormones and neuropeptides by immune cells and of cytokines by neuroendocrine cells; 2) evidence for shared receptors on cells of the immune and neuroendocrine systems; 3) effect of neuroendocrine mediators on immune functions; and 4) effect of cytokines on the neuroendocrine system. This reduces traditional differences between neurotransmitters, hormones, and immune mediators and raises the following question: what can we now regard as immune or neuroendocrine? Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is one example of this paradigm. VIP has traditionally been classified as a neuropeptide/neurotransmitter based in its capacity to mediate and regulate neuronal functions. Recent work has demonstrated that VIP is produced by T cells, especially Th2 cells, and that through specific receptors it exerts immunological functions typically ascribed to Th2 cytokines in nervous and immune systems. Here, we postulate that instead of a neuropeptide, VIP could be fully considered a type 2 cytokine with a key role in neuroimmunology."

Here we show that treatment with an 11-base DNA oligonucleotide homologous to the telomere 3' overhang sequence (T-oligo) induces apoptosis of several established human melanoma cell lines, including the aggressive MM-AN line, whereas normal human melanocytes exposed to the same or higher T-oligo concentrations show only transient cell cycle arrest, implying that malignant cells are more sensitive to T-oligo effects. When MM-AN cells were briefly exposed to T-oligo in culture and injected into the flank or tail vein of SCID mice, eventual tumor volume and number of metastases were reduced 85-95% compared with control mice. Similarly, T-oligos administered intralesionally or systemically selectively inhibited the growth of previously established MM-AN tumor nodules in the flank and peritoneal cavity by 85 to 90% without detectable toxicity. We previously showed that T-oligos act through ATM, p95/Nbs1, E2F1, p16INK4A, p53, and the p53 homologue p73 to modulate downstream effectors and now additionally demonstrate striking down-regulation of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein livin/ML-IAP. We suggest that T-oligo mimics a physiologic DNA damage signal that is frequently masked in malignant cells and thereby activates innate cancer prevention responses. T-oligos may provide a novel therapeutic approach to melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2071337332,"We previously established a model of acquired oxaliplatin resistance derived from the HCT116 oxaliplatin-sensitive cell line (HCT116S) and consisting in two resistant clones (HCT116R1, HCT116R2) and their total or partial revertants (HCT116Rev1 and HCT116Rev2, respectively). Using this cellular model, we explored the contribution of mitochondrial apoptosis and nuclear DNA to oxaliplatin-mediated apoptosis induction and oxaliplatin resistance. We showed that the activity of oxaliplatin is mediated by the induction of Bax/Bak-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis and that oxaliplatin resistance is mediated by a defect in Bax/Bak activation correlating with a reduced loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsim). In addition, we observed that p53 only contributed marginally to oxaliplatin-induced cytotoxicity and was not involved in oxaliplatin resistance. Moreover and surprisingly, depletion of the nucleus in HCT116S cells did not abolish the oxaliplatin-induced DeltaPsim loss indicative of imminent apoptosis. Enucleation abolished the oxaliplatin resistance of HCT116R1 cells, while HCT116R2 cytoplasts conserved their resistant phenotype. Altogether, these data demonstrate that oxaliplatin exerts its cytotoxic effects by inducing mitochondrial apoptosis and that these effects can be initiated by interacting on other cellular structures than nuclear DNA. Resistance to oxaliplatin may imply both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments."
https://openalex.org/W1977779944,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a pleiotropic cytokine implicated as a pathogenic mediator in various liver diseases. Enhanced TGF-beta production and lack of TGF-beta responses are often observed during hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. In this study, we demonstrate that TGF-beta-mediated transactivation is decreased in cells exogenously expressing the intact HCV polyprotein. Among 10 viral products of HCV, only core and nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) physically interact with the MH1 (Mad homology 1) region of the Smad3 and block TGF-beta/Smad3-mediated transcriptional activation through interference with the DNA-binding ability of Smad3, not the nuclear translocation. However, the interactive domain of NS3 extends to the MH2 (Mad homology 2) region of Smad3 and a distinction is found between effects mediated, respectively, by these two viral proteins. HCV core, in the presence or absence of TGF-beta, has a stronger suppressive effect on the DNA-binding and transactivation ability of Smad3 than NS3. Although HCV core, NS3, and the HCV subgenomic replicon all attenuate TGF-beta/Smad3-mediated apoptosis, only HCV core represses TGF-beta-induced G1 phase arrest through downregulation of the TGF-beta-induced p21 promoter activation. Along with this, HCV core, rather than NS3, exhibits a significant inhibitory effect on the binding of Smad3/Sp1 complex to the proximal p21 promoter in response to TGF-beta. In conclusion, HCV viral proteins interact with the TGF-beta signaling mediator Smad3 and differentially impair TGF-beta/Smad3-mediated transactivation and growth inhibition. This functional counteraction of TGF-beta responses provides insights into possible mechanisms, whereby the HCV oncogenic proteins antagonize the host defenses during hepatocarcinogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2045934284,"In most human colorectal cancers, mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC) or CTNNB1 constitutively activate the β-catenin/T-cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF) signaling pathway. Here, we show that the transcription factor activator protein (AP)-2α inhibited a β-catenin/TCF-responsive reporter in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and in two human colorectal cancer lines, despite the fact that β-catenin and TCF-4 protein levels were unchanged in the nucleus. Co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed that AP-2α formed a complex with APC and β-catenin and that AP-2α disrupted β-catenin/TCF-4 interactions in the nucleus. Thus, AP-2α·APC·β-catenin complex formation appears to suppress β-catenin transactivation by shifting the pool of nuclear β-catenin toward an inactive form, having reduced binding to TCF/LEF transcription factors. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays showed that AP-2α physically associated with APC rather than with β-catenin, and the AP-2α binding site was identified in the N terminus of APC, involving both the heptad and armadillo repeat domains, whereas the APC binding site in AP-2α was in the basic region of the C-terminal DNA binding domain.

Consequently, there is considerable interest in mechanisms that down-regulate β-catenin and/or its target genes, since this provides an avenue for the prevention of colorectal and other cancers. We became interested in the transcription factor AP-2α as a putative negative regulator of β-catenin/TCF/LEF signaling. The AP-2 family of transcription factors consists of five members, AP-2α, AP-2β, AP-2γ, AP-2δ, and AP-2∈, which have been implicated as critical regulators of gene expression during vertebrate development, embryogenesis, and transformation (5Zhang J.

Bowerman B. Boutrous M. Perrimon N. Science. 2002; 296: 1644-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). We became interested in the cross-talk between AP-2α and β-catenin/TCF signaling and sought to test the hypothesis that AP-2α might act further upstream as a negative regulator of β-catenin/TCF/LEF signaling. Plasmids—pCMV/APC was kindly provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein. Dr. Hans Clevers and Dr. Marc van de Wetering generously supplied the wild type β-catenin cDNA construct, the positive control reporter TOPflash, and also the corresponding negative control FOPflash, containing mutated TCF/LEF binding sites. Expression vectors for S33Y and Δ45 β-catenins were made by site-directed mutagenesis, starting with the wild type β-catenin construct. pcDNA3.1/AP-2α was generated by cloning cDNA-encoding full-length AP-2α into pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) between HindIII and EcoRV. pGEX/AP-2α was constructed by cloning AP-2α cDNA into pGEX-5x-2 (Amersham Biosciences) between EcoRI and NotI. Plasmids expressing GST-tagged AP-2α fragments were constructed by PCR amplification from pcDNA3.1/AP-2α, followed by cloning into pGEX-5x-2 between EcoRI and NotI. APC and AP-2α fragments were generated from pCMV/APC and pcDNA3.1/AP-2α, respectively, using standard PCR-based methods, and PCR products were cloned into pcDNA3.1(+). All constructs were confirmed by sequencing in both directions. Cells and Transient Transfections—HT29 and HCT116 human colorectal cancer cells were grown in McCoy's 5A Medium supplemented with 10% bovine fetal serum (Invitrogen), whereas human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2-containing atmosphere. Transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE™ 2000 (Invitrogen) or TransFast (Promega), and cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection. Reporter Assays—β-Galactosidase and luciferase assays were performed as reported (20Li Q. Dashwood W.-M. Zhong X. Al-Fageeh M. Dashwood D.H. Genomics. 2004; 83: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), including the appropriate controls for transfection efficiency. Western Blotting and Co-immunoprecipitation Studies—Whole cell lysates were prepared using reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and the protein concentration was determined as reported (20Li Q. Dashwood W.-M. Zhong X. Al-Fageeh M. Dashwood D.H. Genomics. 2004; 83: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), whereas nuclear extracts were obtained using NE-PER extraction reagents (Pierce). Proteins were separated on 4–12% bis-tris gels (Novex) or on 3–8% Tris-acetate gels (for APC); they were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen); and after incubation with primary antibody followed by secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, detection was by Western Lighting Chemiluminescence Reagents Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Antibodies were as follows: rabbit anti-AP-2α polyclonal (C-18; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), mouse anti-β-catenin monoclonal (C19220; Transduction Laboratory), mouse anti-β-actin monoclonal (AC-15; Sigma), mouse anti-TCF-4 monoclonal (6H5-3; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), mouse anti-APC monoclonal (F-3; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and mouse anti-HA tag monoclonal (262K; Cell Signaling). Although β-actin served as a loading control in most experiments, we routinely confirmed the clean separation of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions by immunoblotting with anti-α-tubulin antibody, which detected a signal only for cytoplasmic extracts (data not presented). For co-immunoprecipitation, cells were washed with PBS and incubated in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Supernatants were precleared with protein A-Sepharose for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation was conducted overnight at 4 °C with 4 μg of the indicated antibody. Immunocomplexes were collected by adding 100 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose slurry and incubating for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed five times with lysis buffer, resuspended in 20 μlof SDS sample buffer, heated to 90 °C for 10 min, and subjected to Western blotting analysis with corresponding antibodies. In some experiments, TCF-4 and β-catenin were co-immunoprecipitated from nuclear lysates, followed by immunoblotting for β-catenin and TCF-4 as above. GST Pull-down Assays—To study the interactions between AP-2α, APC, and β-catenin, GST-tagged AP-2α and AP-2α fragments were expressed in the BL21 strain of Escherichia coli and purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). β-Catenin and selected fragments of APC were translated in vitro with the TNT® quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences). The translated proteins and the GST affinity matrix were incubated for 2 h at room temperature in NETN buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) (21Song L.N. Herrell R. Byers S. Shah S. Wilson E.M. Gelmann E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1674-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The beads were then washed five times with NETN buffer, and the bound 35S-labeled protein was analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis with autoradiography. Densitometric Analysis—Image analysis and quantification were performed on an AlphaImager™ 2200 documentation and analysis system (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). AP-2α Inhibits β-Catenin/TCF/LEF-dependent Transcriptional Activity in Colorectal Cancer Cells—To investigate whether AP-2α modulates β-catenin/TCF/LEF-dependent transcriptional activity, experiments were performed with the reporter TOPflash (1Morin P.J.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4839-4846Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) or with the corresponding negative control FOPflash, and pSV-β-galactosidase was included to normalize for transfection efficiency. Initially, wild type β-catenin was overexpressed by transient transfection in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1A). Exogenous β-catenin increased TOPflash but not FOPflash reporter activity, and interestingly, transient transfection of AP-2α suppressed TOPflash activity by ∼65% under the experimental conditions used. Western blotting of whole cell lysates confirmed that AP-2α expression was increased in cells transfected with exogenous AP-2α, but surprisingly, total (endogenous plus transfected) β-catenin levels were similar in cells transfected with or without AP-2α (Fig. 1A, lower panel). Thus, the AP-2α-mediated attenuation of TOPflash reporter activity did not appear to involve changes in total β-catenin expression levels in HEK293 cells. Oncogenic forms of β-catenin, namely S33Y and Δ45, also responded to the inhibitory effects of AP-2α in the reporter assays (Fig. 1, B and C). We next studied the effects of AP-2α in cells transiently transfected with TOPflash but no exogenous β-catenin. In addition to studies with HEK293 cells, which have relatively low levels of cytoplasmic β-catenin, we chose two human colorectal cancer lines known to contain high endogenous β-catenin expression, namely HCT116 and HT29 cells (Fig. 2). AP-2α inhibited TOPflash reporter activity by >50% in HEK293 and HCT116 cells and by ∼25% in HT29 colorectal cancer cells. The latter finding is noteworthy, because HT29 cells lack wild type APC (see below for further discussion). AP-2α Does Not Attenuate β-Catenin or TCF-4 Levels in the Nucleus—Cells treated as described in the legend to Fig. 2 were subjected to immunoblot analyses. In all three cell lines, the nuclear expression levels of β-catenin and TCF-4 remained unchanged by AP-2α (Fig. 3). Taken together, the results in Figs. 1 and 3 clearly indicated that AP-2α decreased TOPflash reporter activity without reducing nuclear levels of β-catenin or TCF/LEF. Cytoplasmic levels of β-catenin and TCF-4 also remained unchanged in response to AP-2α (data not shown). AP-2α Associates with APC and β-Catenin but Not with TCF-4 —Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed next, in order to examine possible direct interactions between AP-2α and APC, β-catenin, or TCF-4. Immunoblotting with anti-TCF-4 antibody identified a strong band in all three cell lines when the same antibody was used for immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4A, right lane) but not when an irrelevant HA-tag antibody or no antibody was used for immunoprecipitation. Importantly, AP-2α antibody also failed to immunoprecipitate TCF-4, which implies no physical interaction between AP-2α and TCF-4. In contrast, AP-2α antibody successfully pulled down β-catenin in all three cell lines (Fig. 4B). As expected, β-catenin and APC antibodies also immunoprecipitated β-catenin (Fig. 4B). In HEK293 and HCT116 cells, antibody to AP-2α immunoprecipitated full-length APC (Fig. 4C), whereas in HT29 cells, which contain two truncated forms of APC, AP-2α antibody pulled down one protein of 200 kDa and another of 100 kDa (Fig. 4D). In the reverse experiment, immunoprecipitation with APC antibody pulled down AP-2α (Fig. 4D, lower blot). Collectively, these results suggested a complex involving AP-2α, β-catenin, and APC, but not TCF-4. AP-2α, Alone or in Combination with APC, Reduces β-Catenin/TCF-4 Interaction in the Nucleus—We next examined whether AP-2α disrupts the association of β-catenin with TCF-4, as a mechanism for attenuating TOPflash reporter activity. Nuclear fractions from HEK293, HT29, and HCT116 cells were immunoprecipitated using anti-human TCF-4 antibody, followed by immunoblotting for β-catenin and reprobing for TCF-4 (Fig. 5). In cells treated with no exogenous AP-2α or APC, anti-TCF-4 antibody pulled down β-catenin, as expected. These β-catenin levels were quantified relative to TCF-4 in the same blot, and each was assigned an arbitrary expression value of 1.00 (see Relative β-cat level in Fig. 5). Transient transfection with AP-2α, APC, or the combination of AP-2α and APC attenuated the levels of TCF-associated β-catenin in each of the cell lines (Fig. 5). In HCT116 cells, for example (Fig. 5, lower blot), overexpression of AP-2α, APC, or AP-2α plus APC produced relative expression levels for TCF-associated β-catenin of 0.72, 0.65, and 0.55, respectively. AP-2α Binds to the Heptad and Armadillo Repeats of APC Rather than to β-Catenin—The APC protein contains several “repeat domains,” namely the N-terminal heptad repeats, the armadillo (“Arm”) repeats, the central 15- and 20-amino acid repeats that bind β-catenin, and also a C-terminal basic region (26Eklof Spink K. Fridman S.G. Weis W.I. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6203-6212Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We generated expression constructs containing each of the major APC domains (designated APC1–APC5; Fig. 6A) and attempted to pull down each APC fragment, as well as β-catenin, using GST-tagged AP-2α. As shown in Fig. 6B (upper panel), AP-2α interacted strongly with the heptad repeats (APC1) and Arm repeats (APC3), and with an APC fragment containing both heptad and Arm repeats (APC2). However, no interaction was seen for AP-2α with the 15-/20-amino acid central repeat region (APC4) or basic region (APC5), or with β-catenin, despite the fact that these proteins were detected in the input controls (Fig. 6B, lower panel). The β-catenin that was immunoprecipitated using anti-AP-2α antibody (Fig. 4B) most likely was associated with APC in the same complex, rather than directly binding to AP-2α. Collectively, the results suggest that AP-2α physically associates with APC rather than β-catenin and that the AP-2α binding domain in APC is located at the N terminus, involving the heptad and armadillo repeats. APC Binds to the Basic Region of AP-2α—As illustrated in Fig. 7A, the AP-2α DNA binding domain is located in the C terminus and includes basic and helix-span-helix dimerization regions, whereas the transactivation domain is in the N-terminal half of the protein and involves glutamine- and proline-rich segments (27Williams T. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 670-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The basic region is identical among human, mouse, and rat species, and a high level of conservation (∼96%) is observed for this region among different AP-2 isoforms (28Hilger-Eversheim K. Moser M. Schorle H. Buettner R. Gene. 2000; 260: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). To identify the APC binding motif in AP-2α, GST-tagged AP-2α fragments were generated and used to pull down 35S-labeled APC2 (i.e. the APC fragment shown previously to contain the AP-2α binding region) (Fig. 6). Full-length AP-2α and the fragment AP-2α-3 interacted strongly with APC2, whereas all other AP-2α fragments had signals similar to the GST background control (Fig. 7B). These data indicated that APC binds to the highly conserved basic region of AP-2α. Finally, to demonstrate that the ability of AP-2α to inhibit β-catenin/TCF/LEF signaling is dependent upon its interaction with APC, we generated constructs expressing truncated forms of AP-2α, namely AP-2α-1, AP-2α-12, and AP-2α-123 (Fig. 8A). In cells transiently transfected with S33Y β-catenin (Fig. 8B) or in cells expressing endogenous β-catenin alone (Fig. 8C), full-length AP-2α inhibited TOPflash activity, as expected, whereas AP-2α-1 and AP-2α-12 lacking the basic region had no effect. Interestingly, AP-2α-123 also failed to suppress TOP-flash activity, despite the presence of the APC-binding basic region. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show that AP-2α binds directly to APC, stabilizing APC/β-catenin interactions in the nucleus, attenuating β-catenin/TCF-4 interactions, and inhibiting TOPflash reporter activity in human colorectal cancer cells. Thus, AP-2α·APC·β-catenin complex formation shifted the pool of nuclear β-catenin to a more inactive form, effectively sequestering β-catenin away from TCF/LEF transcription factors and lowering the transactivation potential of β-catenin within the nucleus. The results are noteworthy, because they suggest a role for AP-2α in modulating the Wnt signaling pathway as a tumor suppressor that negatively regulates ownstream targets of β-catenin/TCF/LEF (1Morin P.J.

This is not the first study to ascribe a tumor suppressor function to AP-2α. Immunohistochemical studies revealed lower than normal expression levels of AP-2α in high grade colorectal carcinomas (13Ropponen K.M. Kellokoski J.K. Pirinen R.T. Moisio K.I. Eskelinen M.J.

Normal melanocytes and nonmetastatic melanoma cell lines had high levels of AP-2, whereas highly metastatic melanoma cell lines expressed little or no AP-2 (14Ruiz M. Pettaway C. Song R. Stoeltzing O. Ellis L. Bar-Eli M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and forced AP-2 expression suppressed tumorigenicity and metastatic potential of human melanoma cells by down-regulating MCAM/MUC18 (29Jean D.

AP-2 regulates several genes involved in the progression of human melanoma, such as c-KIT, E-cadherin, MMP-2, and p21, and AP-2α recently was confirmed as a negative regulator of chondrocyte differentiation (30Huang Z.

We provide here the first evidence that APC is a direct binding partner of AP-2α, but several other AP-2α-interacting proteins have been identified, including retinoblastoma protein (16Decary S.

Many of these AP-2α-binding proteins are well established regulators of gene expression. APC is a tumor suppressor that normally promotes the destruction of β-catenin by forming a cytoplasmic complex with axin, glycogen kinase-3β, and casein kinase I (37Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, APC also has been implicated in developmental processes; mouse embryos with truncated Apc do not complete gastrulation, and Apc mutations in zebra fish result in heart malformations (37Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Narayan S. Roy D. Mol. Cancer. 2003; 2: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 39Fodde R. Edelmann W. Yang K. van Leeuwen C.

Recently, APC was found to shuttle in and out of the nucleus (41Rosin-Arbesfeld R. Cliffe A. Brabletz T. Bienz M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1101-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Somewhat surprisingly, truncated forms of mutant APC lacking one or more nuclear localization signals had a nuclear distribution pattern similar to that of full-length APC (42Fagman H. Larsson F. Arvidsson Y. Meuller J. Nordling M. Martinsson T. Helmbrecht K. Brabant G. Nilsson M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6013-6022Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These findings have stimulated a debate about the nuclear role of APC and the residual function(s) of truncated APC fragments found commonly in tumor cells with APC mutations. Our findings provide possible insight into this question by showing that full-length as well as truncated forms of APC interact with AP-2α in the nucleus. The AP-2α-binding domain was localized in the N-terminal heptad/Arm repeat region of APC. This is noteworthy, because human colon cancers frequently contain truncated forms of APC. We postulate that severely truncated forms of mutant APC containing only the heptad/Arm repeats are capable of forming a functional AP-2α·APC complex in the nucleus, thereby interfering with the transcriptional activities of AP-2α and thus its tumor suppressor functions. It is noteworthy that the most common germ line mutations in APC occur between codons 1061 and 1309, and over 60% of all somatic mutations in APC are localized between codons 1286 and 1513 (43Fearnhead N.S. Britton M.P. Bodmer W.F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 721-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar), leaving one or more β-catenin binding sites in the truncated APC protein. Some of the less severely truncated forms of APC, which fail to down-regulate β-catenin via the Axin/GSK-3β pathway, retain partial β-catenin binding capability and are predicted to form a functional AP-2α·APC·β-catenin complex in the nucleus. This hypothesis was supported by immunoprecipitation studies in HT29 cells, in which two forms of truncated APC were seen in the AP-2α immunoprecipitation complex (Fig. 4D), an AP-2α·APC·β-catenin complex was detected (Fig. 4B), and β-catenin/TCF-4 interactions were attenuated in the nucleus of HT29 cells (Fig. 5). This led to reduced TOPflash reporter activity in HT29 cells, albeit less marked that in HCT116 and HEK cells containing full-length APC (Fig. 2). We also identified the basic region of AP-2α as the APC binding domain. This region is highly conserved in different AP-2 isoforms and in different species. The basic region of AP-2α shares 97 and 99% homology with those of AP-2β and AP-2γ, respectively, and AP-2α from human, mouse, and rat species has an identical basic region. It has been shown that AP-2 requires a basic region and an adjacent dimerization domain to achieve a sequence-specific protein/DNA interaction (44Williams T. Tjian R. Science. 1991; 251: 1067-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Hence, all full-length AP-2 proteins should be able to associate with APC, implying that APC, especially truncated APC, may broadly affect functions of AP-2 family members, and conversely, different AP-2 proteins may interfere with oncogenic functions of mutant APC. Truncated forms of AP-2α failed to inhibit β-catenin/TCF-dependent reporter activity, including fragment AP-2α-123, which contained the APC-binding basic region but not the helix-span-helix domain (Fig. 8). We speculate that the functional complex between AP-2α, APC and β-catenin requires dimerization of AP-2α and possibly interaction with DNA, and follow up studies are in progress to address these questions. Taken together, our findings underscore the important role of AP-2α as a tumor suppressor; they link AP-2α to the Wnt signaling pathway for the first time and suggest possible cross-talk between the Wnt signaling pathway and other pathways of development and differentiation known to be associated with AP-2α. It is predicted that specific inducers of AP-2α will act as novel agents for chemoprevention and chemotherapy in colorectal and other cancers, and further studies in this direction are clearly warranted."

To further investigate the cellular functions of PP4, we isolated and identified PP4-interacting proteins using a proteomic approach. We found that insulin receptor substrate 4 (IRS-4) interacted with PP4 and that this interaction was enhanced following TNF-α stimulation. We also found that PP4, but not PP2A, down-regulated IRS-4 in a phosphatase activity-dependent manner. Pulse-chase analysis revealed that PP4 decreased the half-life of IRS-4 from 4 to 1 h. Moreover, we found that TNF-α stimulated a PP4-dependent degradation of IRS-4, as indicated by the blockage of the degradation by a potent PP4 inhibitor (okadaic acid) and a phosphatase-dead PP4 mutant (PP4-RL). Taken together, our studies indicate that IRS-4 is subject to regulation by TNF-α and that PP4 mediates TNF-α-induced degradation of IRS-4.

Recently, two more signaling proteins, IRS5/DOK4 and IRS6/DOK5, have been identified as potentially new members of the IRS family (6Cai D. Dhe-Paganon S. Melendez P.A. Lee J. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25323-25330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). IRSs are tyrosine-phosphorylated following insulin or IGF-1 stimulation and form signaling complexes at the receptor with Src homology 2 domain-containing proteins, including the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Grb2, Nck, and Shc (7White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 8Giovannone B. Scaldaferri M.L. Federici M. Porzio O. Lauro D. Fusco A. Sbraccia P. Borboni P. Lauro R. Sesti G. Diabetes Metab. Res. Rev. 2000; 16: 434-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). All IRS proteins share a number of structural and functional characteristics, including an N-terminal pleckstrin homology and a phosphotyrosine binding domain, followed by a large C-terminal region containing multiple sites of tyrosine phosphorylation, which serve as docking sites for Src homology 2 domain-containing signaling proteins. IRS proteins also carry a large number of potential sites for serine and threonine phosphorylation, which may regulate protein-protein interactions (9Virkamaki A. Ueki K. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Despite the overall similarity, the IRS proteins differ in their subcellular distribution and tissue/developmental expression pattern. Each IRS is phosphorylated on a set of specific tyrosine residues, leading to its binding to the Src homology 2 domains of distinct signaling proteins and therefore, activation of specific signaling cascades. Disruption of each individual IRS gene causes distinct phenotypes in mice (10Araki E. Lipes M.A. Patti M.E. Bruning J.C. Haag 3rd, B. Johnson R.S. Kahn C.R.

Recently, it was found that IRS-4 expression level is decreased in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) theca cells (24Yen H.W. Jakimiuk A.J. Munir I. Magoffin D.A. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2004; 10: 473-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). IRS-4 has a compensatory role for IRS-1 in adipocyte differentiation (25Tseng Y.H. Kriauciunas K.M. Kokkotou E. Kahn C.R. Mol.

However, the negative regulation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 by IRS-4 in IGF-1 signaling has also been suggested (27Tsuruzoe K. Emkey R. Kriauciunas K.M. Ueki K. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell.

In comparison with other IRSs, IRS-4 exhibits a more limited tissue expression. Besides HEK293 cells, the IRS-4 protein has only been detected in heart and skeletal muscle cells (28Schreyer S. Ledwig D. Rakatzi I. Kloting I. Eckel J.

Tissue-specific expression of IRS-4 suggests the potential involvement of IRS-4 in the regulation of insulin/IGF-1 signaling in these tissues. Five amino acid polymorphisms have been identified in IRS-4, although their functional relevance remains to be determined (30Almind K. Frederiksen S.K. Ahlgren M.G. Urhammer S. Hansen T. Clausen J.O.

We have also found that PP4 plays a role as a positive regulator of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway in TNF-α signaling (48Zhou G. Mihindukulasuriya K.A. MacCorkle-Chosnek R.A. Van Hooser A.

Gene (Amst.). 2001; 278: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), it is likely that PP4 may participate in many essential cellular processes. In this study, by applying a functional proteomic approach, we identified IRS-4 as a novel PP4-interacting protein. Moreover, we found that the stability of IRS-4 was subject to regulation by TNF-α and that PP4 mediated the degradation of IRS-4 by TNF-α.

HEK293 and HEK293T cells were plated at a density of either 2.5 × 105 cells/35-mm plate well or 1.6 × 106 cells/100-mm dish and transfected the next day using the modified calcium phosphate precipitation protocol (Specialty Media, Inc., Lavallette, NJ). Cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40) freshly supplemented with 6.6 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μmp-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed as previously described (51Ling P. Yao Z. Meyer C.F. Wang X.S. Oehl W. Feller S.M. Tan T.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), except that the immunoprecipitates were washed three times with ice-cold NETN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Western blot analysis was performed using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit according to the manufacturer's protocols (Pierce). Phosphatase Assay—HEK293T cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% Nonidet P-40, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 6 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μmp-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. PP4 was immunoprecipitated with an anti-PP4 (Ab 104) antibody. FLAG-PP2A was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG (M2) antibody. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 500 mm NaCl. Phosphatase assays were performed using Ser/Thr phosphatase assay kit 1, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Upstate Biotechnology). In brief, the immunoprecipitates were incubated with 4 μm KTpIRR peptide in 40 μl of assay buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.0), 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MnCl2) at 30 °Cfor 30 min. Buffer plus peptide was used as a negative control. The immunoprecipitates were then pelleted, and the assay buffer was transferred to a 96-well, half-volume plate. The assay was terminated by the addition of 100 μl of Malachite Green solution (1 volume of 4.2% (w/v) ammonium molybdate in 4 m HCl, 3 volumes of 0.045% (w/v) Malachite Green in water, and 1 μl/ml 10% Tween 20 added fresh). After 15 min at room temperature, the assay was read at 650 nm on a PerkinElmer bioassay reader (HTS 7000 plus). Establishment of the HEK293 Cell Clone (10F1) Stably Transfected with FLAG-PP4—HEK293 cells were grown in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with 12.5 mm HEPES, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). We transfected the HEK293 cells with FLAG-PP4 by the Fugene 6 method according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Applied Science). The transfected cells were selected by Geneticin (G418; Invitrogen) at a concentration of 750 μg/ml. The cells were replated at a 1:15 dilution whenever they reached 80% confluence. After 10–14 days, the T-75 flasks were trypsinized, and the drug-resistant cells were replated at a limiting dilution to obtain independent clones. Each clone was tested for FLAG-PP4 expression by Western blotting. Isolation of FLAG-PP4-interacting Protein Complexes—HEK293 cells stably expressing FLAG-PP4, designated as 10F1 clone, were left unstimulated or stimulated with TNF-α (10 ng/ml) for 10 min. Fifteen confluent T175 flasks of 10F1 or parental HEK293 cells (5.175 × 108 cells) were used per purification. The cells were trypsinized, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and stored at –80 °C until needed. The cells were lysed in 5 ml of PIP lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl) freshly supplemented with 6.6 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 50 μmp-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. The lysate was centrifuged at 20,817 × g (14,000 rpm) for 15 min to remove cellular debris. Chromosomal DNA was sheared with a 1-ml syringe. The whole cell extract (105 mg) was incubated with either anti-FLAG-Sepharose or unconjugated Sepharose at 4 °C for 3 h with continuous rotation, packed into a column, and washed three times with 10 ml of NETN buffer. FLAG-PP4 was eluted four times with 1× column volume of 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide in TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 150 mm NaCl). 0.1 μl of each 100-μl fraction was used for anti-FLAG Western blotting to determine which fraction(s) contained FLAG-PP4. The fraction containing the most FLAG-PP4 and the corresponding fractions for the negative controls were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue. Identification of Proteins by Mass Spectrometry—Identification of proteins by mass spectrometry was performed as previously described (52Humphrey G.W. Wang Y. Russanova V.R. Hirai T. Qin J.

A MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer with delayed extraction, a home-built MALDI-ion trap mass spectrometer, and an electrospray ion trap mass spectrometer (LCQ; Finnigan MAT, San Jose, CA) coupled on-line with a capillary high pressure liquid chromatograph (Magic 2002; Michom BioResources, Auburn, CA) were used to acquire tandem mass spectra. A 0.1 × 50-mm Magic MS C18 column (5-μm particle diameter, 200-Å pore size) with mobile phases A (methanol/water/acetic acid, 5:95:1) and B (methanol/water/acetic acid, 85:15:1) was used with a gradient of 2–98% mobile phase B over 2.5 min, followed by 98% mobile phase B for 2 min. Specific protein bands from Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels were excised, destained, and digested with trypsin (200 ng/digestion) in 20 μl of 50 mm NH4HCO3 buffer for 2 h at 37 °C using a protein/enzyme weight ratio of 1:1. The resulting peptides were extracted, and 20–50% of the sample was used to obtain liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectra. The tandem mass spectra were used to search the compiled NCBI nonredundant protein and expressed sequence tag data bases with the program Pep-Frag to identify the proteins. Pulse-chase Analysis—HEK293T cells were plated at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells per 35-mm plate well and transfected the next day with HA-IRS-4 (2 μg) plus empty vector or PP4 (2 μg) as described above. Thirty-six h after transfection, the medium was replaced with 2 ml of prelabeling medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking cysteine and methionine + 5% fetal calf serum). After 1 h of incubation, the prelabeling medium was replaced with 1 ml of labeling medium (prelabeling medium + 0.1 mCi/ml [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine). The cells were labeled for 4 h and then chased with fresh, nonradioactive medium for the times indicated. The cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and 150 mm NaCl) freshly supplemented with 6.6 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 μmp-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. 100 μg of cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody (12CA5) and protein A-Sepharose and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried and autoradiographed. IRS-4 Is a TNF-α-inducible, PP4-interacting Protein—We have previously shown that PP4 is involved in TNF-α signaling (48Zhou G. Mihindukulasuriya K.A.

In the search for novel cellular functions of PP4, we established a HEK293 cell clone (10F1) stably transfected with FLAG-PP4 and applied a functional proteomic approach to identify TNF-α-inducible, PP4-interacting protein(s) in 10F1 cells. We treated 10F1 cells with TNF-α, and the whole cell extract of 10F1 cells was incubated with anti-FLAG-Sepharose. After extensive washing, FLAG-PP4 and the proteins that complexed with PP4 were eluted with FLAG peptide, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 1A). By mass spectrometry, a group of potential PP4-interacting proteins in response to TNF-α stimulation was identified (Fig. 1A). We selected one of these proteins, insulin receptor protein 4 (IRS-4), a docking protein that coordinates cellular responses to insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), for further study. A representative spectrum is shown for IRS-4 along with the peptide sequence and its position in the IRS-4 protein (Fig. 1B). To confirm the interaction between PP4 and IRS-4, we took a fraction of the FLAG peptide elution and performed Western blot analysis using an anti-IRS-4 antibody. As shown in Fig. 2, the presence of IRS-4 in FLAG-PP4-interacting protein complex was greatly increased upon TNF-α treatment (top panel). These data indicate that IRS-4 is a TNF-α-inducible, PP4-interacting protein. We also found that three known PP4-interacting proteins, α4, PP4-R1, and PP4-R2, co-purified with FLAG-PP4 (Fig. 2), further confirming the binding specificity of our approach.Fig. 2IRS-4 co-purifies with PP4. Equal amounts of eluate from the fractionation described in the legend to Fig. 1A were separated via SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes.

https://openalex.org/W2045043949,"Although DNA repair pathways have been the focus of much attention, there is an emerging appreciation that distinct pathways exist to maintain or manipulate RNA structure in response to breakage events. Here we identify an RNA ligase (DraRnl) from the radiation-resistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans. DraRnl seals 3′-OH/5′-PO4 RNA nicks in either a duplex RNA or an RNA: DNA hybrid, but it cannot seal 3′-OH/5′-PO4 DNA nicks. The specificity of DraRnl arises from a requirementfor RNA on the 3′-OH side of the nick. DraRnl is a 342-amino acid monomeric protein with a distinctive structure composed of a C-terminal adenylyltransferase domain linked to an N-terminal module that resembles the OB-fold of phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetases. RNA sealing activity was abolished by mutation of the predicted lysine adenylylation site (Lys-165) in the C-terminal domain and was reduced by an order of magnitude by deletion of the N-terminal OB module. Our findings highlight the existence of an RNA repair capacity in bacteria and support the hypothesis that contemporary DNA ligases, RNA ligases, and RNA capping enzymes evolved by the fusion of ancillary effector domains to an ancestral catalytic module involved in RNA repair.

Polynucleotide ligases seal broken 3′-OH and 5′-PO4 ends in DNA or RNA. The ubiquity and essentiality of DNA ligases attest to the premium placed on the avoidance of strand breaks in the DNA genome. It is sensible to think that polynucleotide ligases initially evolved to catalyze RNA repair/recombination reactions during an aboriginal RNA-protein world. There are a limited number of documented RNA repair pathways in current biology that exploit RNA ligases, including bacteriophage tRNA restriction-repair, fungal tRNA splicing, nonspliceosomal mRNA splicing in the yeast unfolded protein response, and kinetoplastid mRNA editing (1Amitsur M.

The discovery of these exemplary RNA breakage and rejoining pathways was an unexpected dividend of basic research in diverse fields (phage genetics, kinetoplast gene expression, signaling from the ER to the nucleus, tRNA gene structure) rather than a targeted effort to mine the subject of RNA repair. Indeed, it is not clear if these few cases comprise sporadic relics of an ancient RNA repair system or whether RNA repair is a widespread phenomenon in current biology. Our hypothesis is that RNA repair is “hiding in plain sight,” if only we knew how to see it. Specifically, we posit that RNA repair enzymes exist in diverse niches and species and that they can be uncovered by integrating recent biochemical and structural insights to ligase mechanism with phylogenetic analyses of cellular and viral proteomes. RNA ligases join 3′-OH and 5′-PO4 RNA termini via a series of three nucleotidyl transfer steps. (i) RNA ligase reacts with ATP to form a covalent ligase-(lysyl-N)-AMP intermediate plus pyrophosphate. (ii) AMP is transferred from ligase-adenylate to the 5′-PO4 RNA end to form an RNA-adenylate intermediate (AppRNA); and (iii) ligase catalyzes attack by an RNA 3′-OH on the RNA-adenylate to seal the two ends via a phosphodiester bond and release AMP (5Silber R.

Fungal tRNA ligase is an Rnl1-type enzyme that mediates the sealing steps of both tRNA splicing and mRNA splicing in the unfolded protein response (2Abelson J. Trotta C.R. Li H. J. Biol.

Although bacteriophage tRNA restriction provided the initial insights to RNA repair biology, little attention has been paid to the issue of whether bacteria themselves (as opposed to phage) might specify enzymes that catalyze RNA repair reactions. Here we identify and characterize an Rnl2-like RNA ligase from Deinococcus radiodurans, a bacterium that is famous for its extreme resistance to ionizing radiation (20Makarova K.S. Aravind L. Wolf Y.I. Tatusov R.L. Minton K.W. Koonin E.V. Daly M.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 44-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). The D. radiodurans RNA ligase (henceforth DraRnl) 1The abbreviations used are: DraRnl, Deinococcus radiodurans RNA ligase; aa, amino acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DTT, dithiothreitol; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA. has a novel domain structure and distinctive substrate and cofactor specificities in sealing RNA strands. Recombinant DraRnl—A DNA fragment containing the D. radiodurans DRB0094 gene was amplified by PCR from total genomic DNA with oligonucleotide primers designed to introduce an NdeI restriction site at the translation start codon and a BamHI site 3′ of the stop codon. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and inserted into pET16b (Novagen) to generate the expression plasmid pET-DraRNL. Amino-terminal truncation alleles DraRNL-(106–342), DraRNL-(126–342), and DraRNL-(136–342) were generated by PCR amplification using sense primers that introduced an NdeI site and a Met codon in lieu of the codons for Phe-105 or Pro-135 or an NdeI site at the Met-126 codon. Alanine substitution mutations K165A and E278A were introduced by PCR using the two-stage overlap extension method. The truncated and/or mutated DraRNL DNAs were digested with NdeI and BamHI and then inserted into pET16b. The inserts of the wild-type and mutant RNL plasmids were sequenced completely to exclude the acquisition of unwanted changes during amplification and cloning. Wild-type and mutant pET-DraRNL plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). Cultures (1 liter) of E. coli BL21(DE3)/pET-DraRNL were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin until the A600 reached ∼0.6. The cultures were chilled on ice for 30 min, adjusted to 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and 2% ethanol, and then incubated at 17 °C for 16 h with continuous shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was stored at –80 °C. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C. Thawed bacteria were resuspended in 30 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 m NaCl, and 10% sucrose). Lysozyme, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Triton X-100 were added to final concentrations of 1 mg/ml, 1 mm, and 0.1%, respectively. The lysates were sonicated to reduce viscosity, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The soluble extracts were applied to 1-ml columns of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) that had been equilibrated with buffer A. The columns were washed with 8 ml of the same buffer and then eluted stepwise with 4-ml aliquots of 25, 50, and 200 mm imidazole in buffer B (50 mm Tris HCl (pH 8), 0.5 m NaCl, and 10% glycerol). The polypeptide compositions of the column fractions were monitored by SDS-PAGE. The His10-DraRnl proteins adsorbed to the column and were recovered predominantly in the 200 mm imidazole eluates. The eluates were dialyzed against buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Triton X-100 and then stored at –80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by SDS-PAGE analysis of serial dilutions of the DraRnl preparations in parallel with serial dilutions of a BSA standard. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, and the staining intensities of the DraRnl and BSA polypeptides were quantified using a digital imaging and analysis system from Alpha Innotech Corporation. RNA Ligase Substrates—Oligoribonucleotides were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) and deprotected as instructed by the vendor. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides were purchased from BIOSOURCE. The RNA or DNA strands were 32P-5′-end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP and then gel-purified. To form the RNA-labeled tandemly nicked RNA:DNA hybrid, the 32P-labeled RNA strand was annealed to a 2-fold molar excess of an unlabeled 5-OH-terminated DNA strand in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), and 1 mm EDTA by incubation for 10 min at 65 °C, followed by incubation for 15 min at 37 °C and then for 30 min at 22 °C. To form the singly nicked substrates, mixtures of a 5′-PO4 strand, a 3′-OH strand, and a complementary template strand were annealed at a molar ratio of 1:5:2. Substrates containing gaps and flaps were prepared as described (21Nandakumar J. Ho C.K. Lima C.D. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31337-31347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). RNA Ligase Assay—Reaction mixtures (10 μl) containing components as specified were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The reactions were quenched by adding 15 μl of 80% formamide and 100 mm EDTA. The samples were heated for 5 min at 95 °C and then analyzed by electrophoresis through a 14-cm 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in 45 mm Tris borate, and 1 mm EDTA. The ligation products were visualized by autoradiography. Ligation activity with the tandemly nicked dsRNA:DNA hybrid substrates was quantified by scanning the gel with a Fuji BAS-2500 imaging apparatus. The radioactivity signal was determined for each “n-mer” (e.g. n = 1 for the input substrate strand, n = 2 for linear dimer, etc.) that was visualized. The radioactivity for individual n-mers in each reaction was summed, and each n-mer species was expressed as the fraction of the total. The amount (in femtomoles) of 5′ 32P-labeled 24-mer comprising each labeled n-mer was determined by multiplying this fraction by the known amount of input 24-mer substrate strands. Each linear n-mer is necessarily generated as a consequence of “n – 1” ligation events. Thus, the amount (in femtomoles) of ligation required to form each n-mer product was calculated for each n-mer by the following equation: fmol(ligation) = fmol(24-mer) × [(n – 1)/n]. The total amount of strand ligation (fmol of 5′-ends joined) for each reaction was then determined by summing the ligation events for each n-mer product in the ladder. A Candidate Deinococcus RNA Ligase with a Novel Domain Structure—The genome of the radiation-resistant bacterium D. radiodurans consists of 3,195 predicted genes contained on two chromosomes, one megaplasmid, and one plasmid (20Makarova K.S. Aravind L. Wolf Y.I. Tatusov R.L. Minton K.W. Koonin E.V. Daly M.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 44-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). The DRB0094 gene on the megaplasmid encodes a 342-aa polypeptide, DraRnl, that we classify as a putative RNA ligase. Homologous proteins of similar size are encoded by the bacterium Streptomyces avermitilis (355-aa) and the bacteriophage 44RR.8t (366-aa). An alignment of these three putative ligases reveals that their primary structures are conserved throughout their lengths, with 84 positions of side chain identity/similarity (Fig. 1). The C-terminal portions of DraRnl and its homologs contain putative counterparts of the five motifs (I, III, IIIa, IV, and V) that define the covalent nucleotidyl transferase enzyme superfamily (Fig. 1). The members of this superfamily, consisting of DNA ligases, Rnl2-like RNA ligases, and mRNA capping enzymes, all catalyze NMP transfer to polynucleotide 5′ ends via a covalent enzyme-(lysyl-N)-NMP intermediate (22Shuman S. Schwer B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). DNA ligases and mRNA capping enzymes have a common tertiary structure composed of a proximal nucleotidyl transferase domain fused to a distal OB-fold domain (23Subramanya H.S. Doherty A.J.

The NMP-binding pocket of the nucleotidyltransferase domain is composed of a cage of β-strands that includes motifs I, III, IIIa, IV, and V. Motif I, KX(D/H)G, contains the lysine nucleophile to which the NMP becomes covalently linked (28Thogersen H.C. Morris H.R. Rand K.N. Gait M.J. Eur. J.

Motifs III, IIIa, IV, and V contain conserved side chains that contact AMP or GMP and play essential roles in one or more steps of the ligation/capping pathways (30Sriskanda V. Shuman S.

T4 RNA ligase 2 is composed of a structurally homologous N-terminal nucleotidyltransferase domain fused to a distinctive essential C-terminal domain that has no recognizable similarity to the OB-folds of DNA ligases and capping enzymes (37Ho C.K.

The striking features of the putative Deinococcus RNA ligase polypeptide and its homologs are as follows. (i) They terminate immediately distal to nucleotidyltransferase motif V and therefore have no equivalent of the C-terminal domains that are essential for known ligases and capping enzymes. (ii) They include N-terminal domain modules that have no apparent primary structural similarity to segments of any known RNA ligases, DNA ligases, or mRNA capping enzymes; and (iii) their nucleotidyltransferase domains are structurally similar to the Rnl2-like RNA ligases (21Nandakumar J.

Thus, DraRnl and its homologs have a unique domain architecture that sets them apart from previously described covalent nucleotidyltransferases. Purification and Adenylyltransferase Activity of DraRnl— We expressed DraRnl in E. coli as a His10-tagged fusion and purified the 40-kDa recombinant protein from a soluble bacterial extract by adsorption to nickel-agarose and step elution with imidazole (Fig. 2a). The native size of DraRnl was gauged by sedimentation through a 15–30% glycerol gradient. Marker proteins catalase (248 kDa), BSA (66 kDa), and cytochrome c (13 kDa) were included as internal standards. DraRnl sedimented as a single discrete peak between BSA and cytochrome c (Fig. 3a). An S value of 3.2 was determined for DraRnl by interpolation to the internal standard curve. We surmise that DraRnl is a monomer in solution.Fig. 3Glycerol gradient sedimentation of DraRnl. An aliquot (200 μg) of the nickel-agarose preparation of DraRnl was mixed with catalase (100 μg), BSA (100 μg), and cytochrome c (100 μg). The mixture was applied to a 4.8-ml 15–30% glycerol gradient containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.3 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The gradient was centrifuged for 18 h at 4 °C in a Beckman SW50 rotor at 50,000 rpm. Fractions (∼0.2 ml) were collected from the bottom of the tube. a, aliquots (10 μl) of even-numbered gradient fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The Coomassie Blue-stained gel is shown. The positions of the RNA ligase protein (Rnl) and the internal standards are indicated. b, adenylyltransferase activity. Reaction mixtures (10 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 5 mm DTT, 50 μm [α-32P]ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 μl of the even-numbered gradient fractions were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. c, RNA sealing activity.

The adenylyltransferase activity profile during glycerol gradient sedimentation paralleled exactly the sedimentation profile of the DraRnl polypeptide (Fig. 3b). The adenylyltransferase activity of DraRnl was characterized in greater detail using the nickel-agarose enzyme fraction. The extent of ligase-adenylate formation was proportional to input DraRnl (Fig. 4a). DraRnl adenylylation was optimal at pH 9–9.5 and declined sharply at and below neutral pH (Fig. 4b). DraRnl required a divalent cation cofactor to form the covalent adduct. MgCl2 and MnCl2 supported approximately equivalent activity at the optimal concentrations of 10–20 and 2.5–5 mm, respectively (Fig. 4c). Other divalent cations (calcium, cobalt, cadmium, copper, and zinc) were ineffective in supporting enzyme adenylylation at 5 mm concentration (data not shown). The yield of DraRnl-AMP complex reached saturation at ≥12 μm ATP (Fig. 4d). Half-saturation was achieved at ∼4 μm ATP. We calculated that ∼7–10% of the DraRnl protein preparation could be adenylated in vitro with 32P-AMP. DraRnl was unreactive with [α-32P]GTP (data not shown). RNA Ligase Activity of DraRnl—Rnl2 and protozoan RNA-editing ligases are particularly adept at joining RNA termini splinted together by a bridging template strand (10Palazzo S.S. Panigrahi A.K.

Chem. 2004; 279: 31337-31347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the case of Rnl2, sealing activity is optimal when the reactive 3′-OH and 5′-PO4 RNA ends are opposed at a nick in a double-stranded RNA or an RNA:DNA hybrid (21Nandakumar J. Ho C.K. Lima C.D. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31337-31347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Here, we prepared a nicked dsRNA:DNA substrate by annealing a 32P-5′-endlabeled 24-mer RNA oligonucleotide to an unlabeled 24-mer DNA oligonucleotide with overlapping complementarity (Fig. 2c). The annealed strands form a 12-bp duplex with complementary 12-nucleotide 5′-tails that promote self-assembly into an RNA:DNA hybrid duplex containing staggered 3′-OH/5′-PO4 RNA nicks on one strand (note that the DNA strand of the RNA:DNA hybrid contains staggered 3′-OH/5′-OH nicks, which cannot be sealed by polynucleotide ligases). DraRnl was reacted with the annealed 32P-5′-end-labeled RNA:DNA hybrid (20 nm), and the products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. DraRnl generated a ladder of sealed 32P-labeled RNAs comprising a perfectly spaced series of n-mers, with n values ranging from 2 to ≥12 (Fig. 2c). The RNA sealing activity profile of DraRnl during zonal velocity sedimentation coincided with the adenylyltransferase activity profile and the abundance of the DraRnl polypeptide (Fig. 3c). The extent of the ligation of the tandemly nicked dsRNA: DNA hybrid was proportional to input DraRnl (Fig. 2c). Equivalent concentrations of DraRnl were incapable of joining a tandemly nicked dsDNA:DNA substrate of identical sequence and complementarity (data not shown). However, a tandemly nicked dsRNA:RNA substrate of identical sequence and complementarity was sealed by DraRnl (data not shown). A control reaction confirmed that the nicked dsDNA substrate that was unreactive with DraRnl was readily sealed by T4 DNA ligase (not shown). DraRnl was unable to seal (either intermolecularly or intramolecularly) the 32P-labeled 24-mer RNA single-strand by itself; a control experiment showed that the 32P-labeled 24-mer ssRNA was circularized nearly quantitatively by baculovirus RNA ligase, an Rnl1-type enzyme (data not shown). These results indicate that Deinococcus RNA ligase specifically seals RNA strands at a duplex nick. Sealing of the nicked dsRNA:DNA hybrid required a divalent cation cofactor. Activity was optimal in the presence of 5 to 10 mm manganese (Fig. 5a). Whereas cobalt (5 mm) was half as effective as manganese, magnesium and cadmium were only 5% as effective as manganese (Fig. 5b). Neither calcium, copper, nor zinc was able to support RNA-joining activity ata5mm concentration. RNA strand joining was optimal at pH 5.5–7 and declined at alkaline pH (Fig. 5c). The standard ligation reaction mixtures contained ≤10 mm NaCl contributed by the enzyme and RNA substrate solutions. The effect of increasing ionic strength on RNA ligation was gauged by supplementing the reactions with NaCl, KCl, or potassium glutamate. Activity was reduced by each of these monovalent salts in a concentration-dependent manner; 85–95% inhibition was seen at 100 mm added salts (Fig. 5d). Enzyme titrations in the presence or absence of 0.2 mm ATP showed that RNA sealing activity was stimulated 2-fold by ATP (not shown). ATP-independent sealing activity is attributable to the presence of pre-adenylated DraRnl in the enzyme preparation. From the slope of the ATP-independent ligase titration curve, we estimated that one-third of the enzyme preparation was ligase-proficient DraRnl-AMP. The relatively modest ATP stimulation of sealing likely reflects the fact that the pH optimum values for the ligase adenylylation reaction and the overall RNA sealing reaction are significantly different. Ligation of RNA Ends at a Nick versus a Gap or Flap—The DNA strand of the RNA:DNA hybrid was altered by adding one or two deoxyadenosine nucleotides in the center of the oligonucleotide such that, upon annealing to the 24-mer 32P-labeled RNA strand, the 3′-OH RNA end was separated from the 5′-PO4 end by a one- or two-nucleotide gap (21Nandakumar J. Ho C.K. Lima C.D. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31337-31347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The specific activities of DraRnl in sealing the one- and two-nucleotide gap substrates were 7.2% and 0.3%, respectively, of its activity at a nick (Fig. 6a). We then removed one nucleotide in the center of the DNA strand of the RNA:DNA hybrid such that, upon annealing to the 24-mer 32P-labeled RNA strand, either the 3′-OH RNA end or the 5′-PO4 end protruded from the bridging template strand as a one-nucleotide flap (21Nandakumar J.

DraRnl-specific activities on the 5′-flap and 3′-flap substrates were 1.4 and 0.7%, respectively, of the specific activity on the nicked substrate (Fig. 6b). We surmise that DraRnl sealing activity is optimal when the reactive termini are approximated at a"

While interactions with heparin are thought to modulate the biological activity of HB-EGF, the precise role of the heparin-binding domain has remained unclear. We analyzed the activity of wild-type HB-EGF and a mutant form lacking the heparin-binding domain (ΔHB) in the presence or absence of heparin. The activity of the EGF-like domain of HB-EGF was determined by measuring binding to diphtheria toxin (DT) as well as the growth factor activity in EGF receptor-expressing cells. The binding affinity of ΔHB for DT was much higher than that of wild-type HB-EGF in the absence of heparin. The binding affinity of HB-EGF for DT was increased by addition of exogenous heparin and reached the level close to the affinity of ΔHB, whereas that of ΔHB was not affected. Moreover, the growth factor activity of ΔHB was much higher than that of wild-type HB-EGF in the absence of heparin but was not affected by addition of exogenous heparin, whereas HB-EGF had increased growth factor activity with added heparin. These results indicate that the heparin-binding domain suppresses the activity of the EGF-like domain of HB-EGF and that association of heparin with HB-EGF via this domain removes the suppressive effect. Thus, we conclude that the heparin-binding domain serves as a negative regulator of this growth factor.

Bernfield M. Nature. 2000; 404: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Studies with FGFs and their receptor tyrosine kinases also documented a coreceptor role for HSPGs and have suggested models in which HS promotes ligand dimerization, leading to receptor dimerization and stimulation of kinase activity (1Bernfield M. Gotte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2332) Google Scholar). Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), a member of the EGF family growth factors, has a high affinity for heparin and heparan sulfate (HS) (9Higashiyama S. Abraham J.A. Miller J.

Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 933-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). HB-EGF is first synthesized as a type I transmembrane protein (pro-HB-EGF) containing heparin-binding and EGF-like domains (9Higashiyama S. Abraham J.A. Miller J. Fiddes J.C. Klagsbrun M.

Pro-HB-EGF is cleaved within the juxtamembrane domain on the cell surface, resulting in the shedding of soluble HB-EGF (sHB-EGF) (12Goishi K. Higashiyama S. Klagsbrun M. Nakano N. Umata T.

In addition, we recently demonstrated through analysis of HB-EGF null mice that HB-EGF is an essential factor for normal heart function and valvulogenesis (30Iwamoto R. Yamazaki S. Asakura M.

The modulation of various HB-EGF activities by cell surface HSPGs has been previously described (21Raab G. Klagsbrun M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F179-F199PubMed Google Scholar). For examples: (i) reduced HS expression on the cell surface decreases the ability of HB-EGF to stimulate the migration of bovine aortic smooth muscle cells (10Higashiyama S. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 933-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), (ii) binding of HB-EGF to HSPG-deficient CHO cells expressing EGFR is lower than binding to wild-type CHO cells expressing EGFR, an effect that is rescued by the addition of exogenous heparin (31Aviezer D. Yayon A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12173-12177Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), (iii) CHO cells expressing pro-HB-EGF, but deficient in cell surface HSPGs, were 15-fold less sensitive to DT-toxicity than wild-type CHO cells, but DT sensitivity was restored by addition of either HS or heparin, which increased the binding affinity of pro-HB-EGF for DT (32Shishido Y. Sharma K.D. Higashiyama S. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29578-29585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although previous studies well documented the modulation of the biological activities of HB-EGF with heparin, the precise role of the heparin-binding domain remained unclear. Here we analyze the DT binding and growth factor activities of HB-EGF and a mutant form lacking the heparin-binding domain, in the presence or absence of heparin. We present evidence that the heparin-binding domain of HB-EGF suppresses the activity of the EGF-like domain and that binding of heparin to this domain removes the suppressive effect.

Generation of HB-EGF Mutant Constructs—cDNA encoding a mutant form of sHB-EGF lacking the heparin-binding domain (HBΔtmΔhb) was obtained and isolated by PCR using the forward primer (5′-GACCCATGTCTTCGGAAATACAAG-3′) and the phosphorylated reverse primer (5′-CCCGTGCTCCTCCTTGTTTGGTGT-3′), using pRcHBΔtm, which contains the human HB-EGF deletion mutant (HBΔtm) missing the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (34Yamazaki S.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2322-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). To obtain transfectants producing human sHB-EGF and sΔHB, 677 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding sHB-EGF cDNA (pcDNA6/HBΔtmmyc-His) or sΔHB cDNA (pcDNA6/HBΔtmΔhbmyc-His) using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h after transfection, the medium was exchanged with fresh RPMI1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum, and cells were cultured for 48 h. Conditioned medium (CM) containing sHB-EGF or sΔHB was harvested and centrifuged. To obtain stable transfectants of 677 cells and L cells that express pro-ΔHB, cells were transfected with pRcpro-HBΔhb by the calcium phosphate method (35Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured for 48 h and further cultured for 7 days in the presence of 200 μg/ml G418. Colonies growing in the selection medium were isolated and assayed for DT-binding activity as described later. Positive clones were isolated and subcloned again. Clones with highest expression of human pro-ΔHB were chosen from among 677pro-ΔHB cells derived from 677 cells and Lpro-ΔHB cells derived from L cells. Immunoblotting of HB-EGF—Recombinant His-tagged sHB-EGF and sΔHB proteins were collected from conditioned medium of transfected 677 cells using TALON metal affinity resin. Samples were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer with 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, run on an SDS-PAGE gel, and transferred to an Immobilon membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membrane was blocked with 1% skim milk in TTBS (0.05% Tween 20, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl), incubated with anti-human HB-EGF-neutralizing antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG antibody. Proteins were visualized using an ECL Western blotting kit (Amersham Biosciences). To detect pro-HB-EGF and pro-ΔHB protein in transfected 677 cell lysates, cells were lysed with OG-lysis buffer (60 mm 1-O-n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, 0.15 m NaCl, 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.2, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 μm aprotinin, 1 μm E-64, 1 μm leupeptin) and then centrifuged for 20 min at 15,000 × g. The supernatant was boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer with 10% 2-mercaptoethanol and then run on an SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to an Immobilon membrane. After blocking with 1% skim milk in TTBS, the membrane was incubated with anti-human HB-EGF-neutralizing antibody and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG antibody. The membrane was finally analyzed using an ECL Western blotting kit. Heparin-Sepharose Chromatography—CM samples containing sHBEGF or sΔHB were diluted by 2-fold with the dilution buffer (20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.2). 10 μl of heparin-Sepharose was added to 900 μl of the diluted sample, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 4 h. The incubated heparin-Sepharose was washed three times with 1 ml of washing buffer (50 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.2), and eluted with 50 μl of elution buffer (0.05–1.65 m NaCl and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2). Equal amounts of eluants were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer with 10% 2-mercaptoethanol and then run on an SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to an Immobilon membrane. The membrane was blotted with anti-human HB-EGF-neutralizing antibody and with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG antibody as described above. DT Binding Assay—Purified DT was labeled with Na125I (Amersham Biosciences) by an IODO-GEN Pre-Coated Iodination Tube (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Binding of 125I-DT to sHB-EGF secreted into CM was measured as follows: 500 μl of CM containing either sHB-EGF or sΔHB, both His-tagged, was added to 20 μl of 1 m HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.2, and then the mixture was incubated with 20 μl of TALON metal affinity resin at 4 °C for 4 h. After washing the gel three times with 1 ml WS buffer (0.1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline), the gel was suspended with 970 μl of WS buffer. Then the gel was incubated with 10 μlof 125I-DT at the indicated concentrations in the presence or absence of 10 μl of unlabeled DT (final 10 μg/ml) and 10 μl of heparin at the indicated concentrations. After incubation for 8 h at 4 °C, the gel was washed three times with 1 ml of WS buffer. The radioactivity bound to the gel was counted with a γ-counter. Specific binding of 125I-DT to the recombinant HB-EGF molecules was calculated by subtracting the radioactivity of a sample with excess unlabeled DT from that of the sample without unlabeled DT. Specific binding values were plotted as described by Scatchard (36Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17815) Google Scholar) to determine the number of DT binding sites and the binding affinity of sHB-EGF or sΔHB for DT. Binding curves were generated by regression analysis. Binding of 125I-DT to pro-HB-EGF at the cell surface was measured as previously described (18Iwamoto R. Higashiyama S. Mitamura T. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2322-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), except that 100 ng/ml 125I-DT was used. This concentration (1.7 nm) is close to the concentration required for half-saturation of DT binding to human pro-HB-EGF (18Iwamoto R. Higashiyama S. Mitamura T. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2322-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 37Mitamura T. Higashiyama S. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1015-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding of 125I-DT was assessed in the presence of 10 μg/ml unlabeled DT. Specific binding was determined by subtracting the nonspecific binding from the total binding obtained using 125I-DT alone. The relative values of 125I-DT binding to pro-HB-EGF and to pro-ΔHB on the cell surface were calculated as the ratio of specific DT binding to the total amount of pro-HB-EGF or pro-ΔHB on the cell surface, measured by the anti-HB-EGF antibody (H-6) binding assay, as previously described (38Mitamura T. Umata T. Nakano F. Shishido Y. Toyoda T. Itai A. Kimura H. Mekada E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27084-27090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Determination of the Concentration of sHB-EGF and sΔHB in the CM Samples—The concentration of sHB-EGF and sΔHB in each CM sample was calculated from the Bmax value in the Scatchard plot analysis of DT binding as described above. In each experiment, the actual concentration was determined in which the Bmax value was corrected by a proportion of collected recombinant protein with the metal affinity resin, by using a known concentration of commercial purified recombinant HB-EGF (R&D Systems) as a standard. CM samples determined for the concentrations of these species were used in the mitogenic assay and in the EGFR autophosphorylation assay as described later. Heparitinase Treatments of Cells—Heparitinase treatments were carried out as described previously (32Shishido Y. Sharma K.D. Higashiyama S. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29578-29585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Mitogenic Assay—40 μl of DER cells (1.0 × 104 cells) in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum were inoculated in each well of a 96-well tissue culture plate. CM samples containing either sHB-EGF or sΔHB were diluted with the medium to the indicated concentrations. 50 μl of CM sample, with or without anti-HB-EGF-neutralizing antibody (10 μg/ml), was added to the wells containing the DER cells. 10 μl of heparin at the indicated concentrations was also added to the wells. After 36 h of culture at 37 °C, the cell number in each well was measured by the Cell Count Reagent SF (Nacalai, Kyoto, Japan), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mitogenic activity of the secreted HB-EGF species was calculated as the difference between the values obtained with and without anti-HB-EGF-neutralizing antibody. EGFR Autophosphorylation Assay—DER cells were washed twice and incubated with serum-free RPMI 1640 for 30 min before the experiment. 100 μl of DER cells (4 × 106 cells) was treated with 100 μl of CM from mock-transfected cells or cells expressing sHB-EGF or sΔHB, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 min. After incubation, DER cells were lysed with Triton X-100-lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.15 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 μm aprotinin, 1 μm E-64, 1 μm leupeptin, 0.5 μm EDTA) and then centrifuged for 20 min at 15,000 × g. The supernatant was boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer with 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, then run on an SDS-PAGE gel, and transferred to an Immobilon membrane. After blocking with 1% skim milk in TTBS, the membrane was incubated with anti-EGFR or anti-phospho-EGFR antibody and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody. The membrane was finally analyzed using an ECL Western blotting kit. Mutant Forms of HB-EGF Lacking the Heparin-binding Domain—To elucidate the role of the heparin-binding domain of HB-EGF, mutant forms of HB-EGF were generated, as shown in Fig. 1A. Pro-ΔHB, a membrane-anchored form of HB-EGF lacking the heparin-binding domain (amino acids 93–105), and sΔHB, a myc- and His-tagged soluble form of HB-EGF lacking the heparin-binding domain, were both generated. In addition, sHB-EGF, also a myc- and His-tagged wild-type soluble form, was used as a control. Each construct was expressed in a mutant CHO cell line, 677, which lacks both N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase and glucuronosyltransferase, enzymes required for the polymerization of HS chains (39Lidholt K. Weinke J.L. Kiser C.S. Lugemwa F.N. Bame K.J. Cheifetz S. Massague J. Lindahl U. Esko J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2267-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). First, we examined the recombinant proteins from these cell lines by Western blot. sHB-EGF and sΔHB were detected in the conditioned medium with the expected molecular masses ranging from 18 to 28 kDa and from 14 to 24 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1B, left panel). Pro-HB-EGF or pro-ΔHB was detected in the lysate of the transfected 677 cells, with the expected molecular masses ranging from 27 to 52 kDa and 24 to 50 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1B, right panel). Because both sΔHB and pro-ΔHB lack the heparin-binding domain, the molecular masses of these proteins are smaller than wild type, as expected. Immunoblotting of HB-EGF species showed several bands, which represent various post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and N-terminal processing (11Higashiyama S. Lau K. Besner G.E. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6205-6212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Davis-Fleische K.M. Brigstock D.R. Besner G.E. Growth Factors. 2001; 19: 127-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). sΔHB and pro-ΔHB had similar banding patterns as sHB-EGF and pro-HB-EGF, respectively, indicating that deletion of heparin-binding domain does not affect the post-translational modification of HB-EGF (Fig. 1B). The heparin-binding activity of sHB-EGF and sΔHB was assessed using heparin-Sepharose chromatography. As shown in the upper panel of Fig. 1C, sHB-EGF bound to heparin-Sepharose in 0.05 m NaCl buffer and was eluted in buffer containing more than 0.75 m NaCl, as reported previously (41Thompson S.A. Higashiyama S. Wood K. Pollitt N.S. Damm D. McEnroe G. Garrick B. Ashton N. Lau K. Hancock N. et al.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2541-2549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the contrary, almost all of the sΔHB input was detected in the flow-through fraction (Fig. 1C, lower panel), indicating that heparin-binding activity of sΔHB was undetectable. A previous study indicated that the heparin-binding domain consisted of a 21-amino acid stretch from amino acid 93 through 113 (41Thompson S.A. Higashiyama S. Wood K. Pollitt N.S. Damm D. McEnroe G. Garrick B. Ashton N. Lau K. Hancock N. et al.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2541-2549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the highly basic sequences 93KRKKK97, 103KKR105, and 110RKYK113 contributing the most to the heparin-binding function. However, here we deleted amino acids 93–105, which lie adjacent to but do not overlap the EGF-like domain, and found that the amino acid stretch 93KRKKKGKGLGKKR105 is essential for heparin-binding property in HB-EGF. DT Binding Assay—HB-EGF has been shown to act as a diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) and binds to DT through its EGF-like domain (37Mitamura T. Higashiyama S. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J.

We found 12 spots, the intensity of which was entirely lost or decreased in both the human glioma tissues examined as compared with that in matched normal lymphocytes, indicating aberrant methylation of these CpG islands in gliomas. The expression of RFX1, one of the genes associated with the methylated CpG islands, was frequently decreased in human glioma cell lines and tissues. We also demonstrated that the isolated CpG island located in the seventh intron of the RFX1 gene had enhancer activity and was hypermethylated in all of the glioma tissues and cell lines analysed, but not in normal brains or lymphocytes. Treatment of glioma cells with a demethylating agent, 5-azacytidine, resulted in the expression of RFX1, indicating that the silencing of the RFX1 gene may be attributable to its methylation. RFX1 has been implicated in transcriptional downregulation of the proto-oncogene c-myc. By expression of the RFX1 gene, the cellular proliferative activity of glioma cells was suppressed. Taken together, these results suggest that the RFX1 gene may be epigenetically silenced in human gliomas and involved in glioma tumorigenesis."

However, with almost 400,000 American living with AIDS, the epidemic is far from over. Challenges to prevention include the need to increase the number of persons who know their HIV infection status, as well as increasing prevention efforts, especially among men who have sex with men and in the African-American community. To advance HIV prevention will require using new HIV testing technologies, identifying new prevention venues, taking actions that have not been politically acceptable, and identifying new leaders in affected communities."
https://openalex.org/W1589067421,"Over the past three decades, many researchers have searched for the tidal triggering of earthquakes in the hope that small triggered shocks would illuminate faults critically stressed for failure in future large earthquakes. The results have been equivocal, but not anymore, according to the Perspective by
 Stein. He highlights a recent paper by Tanaka, Ohtake, and Sato in
 Earth, Planets and Space, where they report the detection of detected tidal triggering in 10% of the Japanese archipelago and show that earthquakes are only triggered when the tidal stress acts in the same direction as the regional tectonic stress. If the results can be reproduced in places such as California and Taiwan, a long-sought goal of seismology would be achieved."
https://openalex.org/W2058420385,"Neuroglycan C (NGC) is a membrane-spanning chondroitin sulfate (CS) proteoglycan that is expressed predominantly in the central nervous system (CNS). NGC dramatically changed its structure from a proteoglycan to a nonproteoglycan form with cerebellar development, whereas a small portion of NGC molecules existed in a nonproteoglycan form in the other areas of the mature CNS, suggesting that the CS glycosylation of NGC is developmentally regulated in the whole CNS. As primary cultured neurons and astrocytes from cerebral cortices expressed NGC in a proteoglycan form and in a nonproteoglycan form, respectively, CS glycosylation seems to be regulated differently depending on cell type. To investigate the glycosylation process, cell lines expressing a proteoglycan form of NGC would be favorable experimental models. When a mouse NGC cDNA was transfected into COS 1, PC12D, and Neuro 2a cells, only Neuro 2a cells, a mouse neuroblastoma cell line, expressed NGC bearing CS chains. In PC12D cells, although three intrinsic CS proteoglycans were detected, exogenously expressed NGC did not bear any short CS chains just like NGC in the mature cerebellum. This suggests that the addition of CS chains to the NGC core protein is regulated in a manner different from that of other CS proteoglycans. As the first step in investigating the CS glycosylation mechanism using Neuro 2a cells, we determined the CS attachment site as Ser-123 on the NGC core protein by site-directed mutagenesis. The CS glycosylation was not necessary for intracellular trafficking of NGC to the cell surface at least in Neuro 2a cells.

Proteoglycans are a group of proteins that bear covalently bound sulfated glycosaminoglycan chains. They are located on the cell surface and in the extracellular space in various animal tissues including the central nervous system (CNS). 1The abbreviations used are: CNS, central nervous system; CHase ABC, chondroitinase ABC; CS, chondroitin sulfate; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; EGF, epidermal growth factor; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FCS, fetal calf serum; HS, horse serum; NGC, neuroglycan C; P7, 7-day-old; RT, reverse transcription; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; sulfo-NHS-biotin, sulfosuccinimidobiotin. In the vertebrate CNS, proteoglycans play multiple roles in various cellular events including mitogenesis, migration, differentiation, axonal outgrowth, and synaptogenesis (1Bandtlow C.E.

We found a transmembrane chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, named neuroglycan C (NGC), that is expressed in the brain, especially on the surface of neuronal cells, but not in other tissues in rats (7Watanabe E. Maeda N. Matsui F. Kushima Y. Noda M. Oohira A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26876-26882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and humans (8Yasuda Y. Tokita Y. Aono S. Matsui F. Ono T. Sonta S. Watanabe E. Nakanishi Y. Oohira A. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 32: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The core protein is divided into five structurally different domains as follows: an N-terminal domain to which the chondroitin sulfate (CS) chain is attached, a cluster of acidic amino acids, an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, a membrane-spanning segment, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Considering that NGC is strongly expressed in the immature brain (7Watanabe E. Maeda N. Matsui F. Kushima Y. Noda M. Oohira A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26876-26882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) where the neuronal circuits are actively being formed, this proteoglycan may play pivotal roles in neuronal circuit formation like other neural proteoglycans. Actually, CALEB (chicken acidic leucine-rich EGF-like domain containing brain protein), the chicken homolog of NGC, has been reported to participate in neuronal cell adhesion and neurite formation (9Schumacher S.

Most interestingly, the structure of NGC changes drastically during the development of the cerebellum (11Aono S. Keino H. Ono T. Yasuda Y. Tokita Y. Matsui F. Taniguchi M. Sonta S. Oohira A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 337-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 12Aono S. Keino H. Tokita Y. Yamauchi S. Oohira A. Connect. Tissue. 2000; 32: 45-48Google Scholar) as well as in the retina (13Inatani M. Tanihara H. Oohira A. Otori Y. Nishida A. Honjo M. Kido N. Honda Y. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 4338-4346PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analysis demonstrated that whereas NGC existed in a proteoglycan form in the immature cerebellum, most NGC molecules did not bear CS chain in the mature cerebellum, indicating that NGC is a typical part-time proteoglycan in the cerebellum. A “part-time proteoglycan” is defined as one in which only a small portion of the molecules bears glycosaminoglycan (14Fransson L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 406-411Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 15Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13369-13372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The structural change of NGC from a proteoglycan to a nonproteoglycan form coincides with the stage in which the dendrites of the Purkinje cells develop strikingly forming synapses with climbing fibers and parallel fibers. In the cerebellum at this developmental stage, various changes have been reported to occur as follows: N-methyl-d-aspartate-receptor composition changes from NR2B to NR2C (16Ozaki M. Sasner M. Yano R. Lu H.S. Buonanno A. Nature. 1997; 390: 691-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar); neural cell adhesion molecule undergoes conversion from an embryonic form with a high amount of sialic acid to an adult form with less sialic acid (17Edelman G.M. Chuong C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7036-7040Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar); and the insertion of the VASE exon in the fourth IgG domain of neural cell adhesion molecule is also found to parallel closely the developmental down-regulation of α2,8-linked sialic acid homopolymers (18Oka S. Bruses J.L. Nelson R.W. Rutishauser U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19357-19363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Like these molecules, the structural change of NGC must be precisely regulated during cerebellar development. Recently, we found that the CS chains of NGC purified from the brain of neonatal rats were rich in highly sulfated disaccharide units, or E-units, compared with those of neurocan and phosphacan isolated from the rat brain at the same developmental stage (19Shuo T. Aono S. Matsui F. Tokita Y. Maeda H. Shimada K. Oohira A. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 20: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Because CS rich in E-units has an affinity for some growth factors such as midkine (20Deepa S.S. Umehara Y. Higashiyama S. Itoh N. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43707-43716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), the CS chain of NGC may be involved in a certain developmental event through interaction with these growth factors. To investigate the CS glycosylation processes of NGC and the involvement of its CS moiety in developmental events, it is essential to find or establish cells that express a proteoglycan form of NGC. In the present study, we found that the CS glycosylation of NGC differs depending on not only developmental stage but also cell type. For example, some cells such as primary cultured neurons and Neuro 2a cells transfected with an NGC cDNA produced a proteoglycan form of NGC, but others such as primary cultured astrocytes and PC12D cells transfected with the NGC cDNA produced mainly a nonproteoglycan form of NGC, although both cell types produce some other CS proteoglycans (4Oohira A. Katoh-Semba R. Watanabe E. Matsui F. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 20: 195-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 21Katoh-Semba R. Oohira A. Kashiwamata S. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). By using Neuro 2a cells, we determined the CS attachment site on the NGC core protein by site-directed mutagenesis, and we examined the cell surface localization of NGC with or without CS chains. Cell Culture—COS 1 cells and Neuro 2a cells (Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Osaka, Japan) were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Sigma), 50 units/ml penicillin G potassium, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. In the case of PC12D cells (22Sano M. Kato K. Totsuka T. Katoh-Semba R. Brain Res. 1988; 459: 404-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), DMEM was supplemented with 5% FCS, 10% heat-inactivated horse serum (HS; Cambrex Corp., East Rutherford, NJ), and 10 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate (Invitrogen). For primary culture, cerebral cortices of Wistar rats were dissected on embryonic day 16. To obtain neuron-rich culture dishes, the cortices were treated with 0.15 units/ml of papain and dissociated by trituration with a Pasteur pipette. Then 4 × 106 cells were suspended in 10 ml of high glucose DMEM containing 0.4% HS, 50 units/ml penicillin G, 25 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 μl/ml N2 supplement (Invitrogen) and plated onto a 100-mm poly-l-lysine-coated plastic dish (23Nakanishi K. Nakanishi M. Kukita F. Brain Res. Brain Res. Protoc. 1999; 4: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Primary astrocyte cultures were prepared according to the procedures described by Nakanishi et al. (23Nakanishi K. Nakanishi M. Kukita F. Brain Res. Brain Res. Protoc. 1999; 4: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The cortices were treated with 0.15 units/ml papain and plated at a density of 2 × 107 cells per 25-cm2 flask in low glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 80 units/ml penicillin G, and 200 μg/ml streptomycin. After the cells had been maintained for 1 week, the top layer of cells (neurons, oligodendrocytes, and microglia) was removed by shaking horizontally, and the remaining cells were then detached with 0.05% trypsin containing 0.53% EDTA and re-plated on 100-mm plastic dishes. The medium was replaced twice a week with fresh medium. After an additional week of culture, the astrocytes reached confluency, and most cells were glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive and A2B5-negative. Reverse Transcription (RT)-mediated PCR—RT-PCR was performed using the Superscript One-step RT-PCR System (Invitrogen). Total RNA from the cultured cells was purified using TRIzoL reagent following the manual from Invitrogen. To prove the existence of NGC, the DNA primers 5′-TGCGACCTCTTCCCAAGTTA-3′ and 5′-ATGACTCCTCCTCTTTCAGG-3′ were used for COS 1 cells, TGTGACCTCTTCCCGAGTTA and AGGACTCTTCCTCCTTCAGG-3′ for PC12D cells, and 5′-TGTGACCTCTTTCCGAGTTA-3′and 5′-AGGACTCTTCCTCCTTCAGG-3′ for Neuro 2a cells. The PCR products were subcloned into pBluescript II phagemid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). In each case, six clones were removed, and both complementary strands of the DNAs were sequenced using a BcaBEST dideoxy sequencing kit, dCTP version (Takara, Osaka, Japan). Western Blot Analysis—The olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, brain stem, cerebellum, and spinal cord were obtained from 7-day-old (P7) and adult C57BL/6 mice. These cerebral tissues were processed for Western blot analyses by the method of Matsui et al. (24Matsui F. Watanabe E. Oohira A. Neurochem. Int. 1994; 25: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Cells in culture (100-mm dish) were solubilized with 3 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, 20 mm EDTA, 10 mmN-ethylmaleimide, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Proteoglycans were precipitated from the cell lysate by adding 3 volumes of 95% ethanol containing 1.3% potassium acetate at 0 °C and collected by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The samples thus prepared were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 3% stacking gel and a 6% separating gel. In some cases, the precipitates were dissolved in a chondroitinase reaction buffer and digested with protease-free chondroitinase ABC (CHase ABC, EC 4.2.2.4; Seikagaku Co., Tokyo, Japan) to remove CS side chains, as described previously (25Oohira A. Matsui F. Matsuda M. Takida Y. Kuboki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10240-10246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins treated with CHase ABC were again precipitated from the reaction buffer by adding 3 volumes of the ethanol/potassium acetate solution and then were separated by SDS-PAGE as described above. Proteins were transferred electrophoretically onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. Immunoreactive bands on the membranes were detected using a Vectastain elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and Konica Immunostaining HRP-1000 (Seikagaku Co.). Antibodies—NGC on the blots was detected with an antiserum against a recombinant polypeptide (amino acids 33–259 of rat NGC) representing the CS attachment domain of NGC (8Yasuda Y. Tokita Y. Aono S. Matsui F. Ono T. Sonta S. Watanabe E. Nakanishi Y. Oohira A. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 32: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). All CS proteoglycans including NGC on the blots were detected with monoclonal anti-proteoglycan ΔDi-0S, ΔDi-4S, and ΔDi-6S antibodies (Seikagaku Co.) after treatment with CHase ABC. These three monoclonal antibodies react with the CS “stub” that remains on core proteins after extensive CHase ABC digestion. Plasmid Construction—A cDNA of mouse NGC I, a major splicing variant of NGC (11Aono S. Keino H. Ono T. Yasuda Y. Tokita Y. Matsui F. Taniguchi M. Sonta S. Oohira A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 337-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), was subcloned into pCI-Neo vector (Amersham Biosciences). CS chains are thought to link to serine residues in serylglycine or glycyl-serine sequences in core proteins (15Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13369-13372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are six potential CS attachment sites (serine 38, 123, 156, 188, 232, and 369) conserved among mouse, rat, and human in the ectodomain of NGC (Fig. 1). Therefore, we produced six mutant cDNA constructs, each of which contains one or two mutations to convert one of these serine residues into alanine. In order to make a mutant with S123A, two oligonucleotides, 5′-CCTGGGTGGAGTGACTGCAGAGGCTGGCGCTGGCGA-3′ and 5′-CGTCGCCAGCGCCAGCCTCTGCAGTCACTCCACCCAGG-3′, were annealed, and then the DNA fragment was ligated to NGC I cDNA at StuI and BsaI sites. In other cases, DNA fragments bearing the substitution of one or two bases were amplified by PCR using a normal primer and a primer with a mutation (Table I) and ligated to NGC I cDNA. The sequences were confirmed using a BcaBEST dideoxy sequencing kit, dCTP version (Takara).Table IProduction of mutant NGC cDNA by PCRMutation siteNucleotide no.PrimerSer-38-115 to -935′-TCATGCTGCCCACCGTGGGCTGA-3′129 to 1105′-TTCAGCCTCGATCGCAGCGC-3′Ser-156445 to 4685′-ATCCCTGAGGCTACTGAAACCGCT-3′710 to 6915′-TCTGAGGTTCCTGGTGACCC-3′Ser-188312 to 3315′-TGCCTGGCTAGAGGCAGATG-3′603 to 5625′-CTCGAGAGTGCCCTGAAGGGGAAAAGTGGGCTCTGGTGTGGC-3′Ser-232687 to 7145′-CCCGGGGGCACCAGGAACCTCAGAAAAT-3′1012 to 9935′-AGATGCTGCTGCCAGGTACC-3′Ser-3691067 to 11065′-GCACAGAGTGCCGAGTTGGCTTCGTCAGGCACAATGGCAC-3′1415 to 13965′-TCGTTGTGGAGCTCAGATGG-3′ Open table in a new tab Selection of Cell Lines Stably Expressing Normal or Mutant NGC— NGC cDNAs (20–40 μg) were introduced into cultured cells using a Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad). Electroporation was carried out at 0.25 kV and 500 microfarads. At 24 h after the electroporation, geneticin (Sigma) was added at a concentration of 150 μg/ml. Cells expressing NGC protein were detected by immunocytochemistry, and the expression of NGC by these cells was confirmed by Western blotting using the anti-NGC antiserum (8Yasuda Y. Tokita Y. Aono S. Matsui F. Ono T. Sonta S. Watanabe E. Nakanishi Y. Oohira A. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 32: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cell Surface Biotinylation—Biotinylation of proteins on the cell surfaces was performed using sulfosuccinimidobiotin (sulfo-NHS-biotin; Pierce) according to the method of Altin and Pagler (26Altin J.G. Pagler E.B. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In brief, cells washed three times with ice-cold PBS were suspended in PBS (pH 8.0) at 2.5 × 106 cells/ml and were treated with 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-biotin for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed three times with cold PBS to remove unreacted reagent. To examine whether normal and mutant NGC expressed in Neuro 2a cells can be labeled by this method, immunoprecipitation analysis for NGC was performed. Cell lysates were prepared as described above. An aliquot (usually 0.6 ml) of the lysate was incubated with 2 μg of the affinity-purified anti-NGC antibody at 4 °C for 2 h. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (3 μl; Amersham Biosciences) was added to the antibody-containing cell lysate. The mixture was agitated gently at 4 °C overnight, and then was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min to collect the immunoprecipitates. The precipitated beads were washed twice with 200 μl of PBS containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40 and once with 200 μl of the chondroitinase reaction buffer. The beads suspended in the reaction buffer were incubated with protease-free chondroitinase ABC at 37 °C for 60 min as described above. The enzyme reaction was stopped by adding 3 volumes of the ethanol/potassium acetate solution at 0 °C. Precipitates were collected by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min and were boiled for 2 min in the sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. After centrifugation of the bead suspension, the supernatant was subjected to Western blot analysis. Biotinylated proteins on a PVDF membrane were detected using a Vectastain elite ABC kit (Vector Labs) and Western Lightning™ Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The NGC bands on a PVDF membrane were visualized by sequential treatments with the anti-NGC antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody, and the chemiluminescence reagent. Western Blot Analysis of NGC in Six Different Parts of CNS in Young and Adult Mice—The structure of NGC in the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, brain stem, cerebellum, and spinal cord was examined in P7 and adult mice by Western blotting using the anti-NGC antiserum. In P7 mice, NGC was recognized as a broad band, which is characteristic of a proteoglycan, at around 150 kDa in homogenates of all parts examined (Fig. 2). Digestion of the homogenates with CHase ABC produced a relatively narrow band with a molecular mass of 120 kDa. At adulthood, most NGC molecules in all parts except for the cerebellum existed in a proteoglycan form with a molecular mass of 150 kDa. In the cerebellar homogenate, a significant amount of the 120-kDa band was visible even without the CHase ABC treatment (Fig. 2E), consistent with our previous result (11Aono S. Keino H. Ono T. Yasuda Y. Tokita Y. Matsui F. Taniguchi M. Sonta S. Oohira A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 337-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the 120-kDa molecule was also detected in the other areas of the mature mouse CNS, although the proportion of this component is very small. These findings suggest that most NGC molecules in the mature cerebellum and a small portion of NGC molecules in the mature olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, brain stem, and spinal cord have very short or no CS chains. Nonproteoglycan Form of NGC in the Adult Mouse Cerebellum—To examine whether NGC in the mature cerebellum bears any short CS chains, NGC in the mature cerebellum was electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane after separation by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A), and the membrane strip containing the NGC band was exhaustively digested with CHase ABC. If the NGC molecules bear any short CS chains, the NGC band becomes immunoreactive with antibodies against the CS stubs after CHase ABC digestion. The enzymatic treatment of the PVDF membrane strip resulted in the appearance of an immunoreactive smear of over 200 kDa (3rd lane in Fig. 3A), but the NGC band shown in the 1st lane in Fig. 3A did not become immunoreactive with the anti-proteoglycan ΔDi-4S stub antibody (3rd lane in Fig. 3A). The same results were obtained using the anti-proteoglycan ΔDi-0S or ΔDi-6S antibody (data not shown). These findings indicate that most NGC molecules in the mature cerebellum do not bear any CS chains. It is not known whether the nonproteoglycan form of NGC bears the glycosaminoglycan-protein linkage region tetrasaccharide, GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl, common to various proteoglycans. The smear of over 200 kDa would mostly represent neurocan, because neurocan exists in the mature cerebellum and is recovered at this area upon SDS-PAGE. In the mature cerebrum, NGC was detected at about 150 kDa without CHase ABC treatment (1st lane in Fig. 3B), and a band of 120 kDa was detected after the enzymatic treatment (2nd lane) using the anti-rat NGC antibody. The anti-proteoglycan ΔDi-4S (Fig. 3B, 3rd and 4th lanes), ΔDi-0S (data not shown), and ΔDi-6S (data not shown) antibodies recognized the 120-kDa band corresponding to the NGC core glycoprotein in addition to several bands with higher molecular masses only after CHase ABC treatment. NGC Expression in Primary Cultured Neurons and Astrocytes—We examined the expression of NGC in primary cultures of cells derived from the fetal rat neocortex by Western blotting. Immunohistochemical analysis of the young rat brain indicates that neurons rather than glial cells are exclusively immunostained with anti-NGC antibody (7Watanabe E. Maeda N. Matsui F. Kushima Y. Noda M. Oohira A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26876-26882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, in the primary culture system, not only neurons but also astrocytes from the neocortex expressed NGC (Fig. 4). Most surprisingly, the structure of the NGC synthesized was quite different between neurons and astrocytes. Neurons in culture expressed mostly a chondroitinase-sensitive broad band or a proteoglycan form of NGC (Fig. 4B), whereas astrocytes in culture expressed a chondroitinase-resistant narrow band or a nonproteoglycan form of NGC (Fig. 4A). This indicates that the CS glycosylation of NGC is regulated differently in these two cell types. NGC Expression in Some Cell Lines—The findings mentioned above (Fig. 2E) indicate that the CS glycosylation of NGC is developmentally regulated in the cerebellum, and therefore suggest that the glycosylation is one of the molecular mechanisms regulating cerebellar development. To investigate the CS glycosylation mechanism for NGC, a cell line expressing a proteoglycan form of NGC would be a favorable experimental model. To detect the NGC proteoglycan in cultures of original COS 1, PC12D, and Neuro 2a cell lines, we performed Western blotting of lysates of these cells using the anti-NGC antibody. As shown in Fig. 5, NGC was not detected in cultures of COS 1 (A, lanes 1 and 2), PC12D (B, lanes 1 and 2), or Neuro 2a cells (C, lanes 1 and 2) regardless of CHase ABC treatment under these experimental conditions. We then transfected a mouse NGC-I cDNA into these cells, and we tried to detect the NGC proteoglycan by Western blotting. The transfected COS 1 cells expressed two bands at around 120 kDa without CHase ABC treatment (Fig. 5A, lane 3). After the enzymatic treatment, neither the thickness nor the mobility of the bands changed (Fig. 5A, lane 4), indicating that NGC does not bear any CS chains in COS 1 cells. The same result was obtained in PC12D cells, although there was only one immunoreactive band (Fig. 5B, lanes 3 and 4). When the NGC-I cDNA was transfected into Neuro 2a cells, a broad band of about 150 kDa was observed in addition to the two bands of around 120 kDa before the treatment with CHase ABC (Fig. 5C, lane 3). After the enzymatic treatment, the 150-kDa broad band disappeared, and the immunoreactivity of the 120-kDa doublet increased (Fig. 5C, lane 4), indicating that a large proportion of NGC molecules bear CS chain(s) in cultures of Neuro 2a cells. It is of interest that only Neuro 2a cells among these cell lines expressed a proteoglycan form of NGC when the same NGC-I cDNA was transfected. CS Proteoglycans in Cultures of PC12D Cells—Both COS 1 and PC12D cells must synthesize their endogenous CS proteoglycans. In fact, Katoh-Semba et al. (21Katoh-Semba R. Oohira A. Kashiwamata S. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) have reported the synthesis and characterization of CS-glycosaminoglycans in PC12D cells. We then examined whether PC12D cells stably expressing the nonproteoglycan form of NGC (Fig. 6B) express any other endogenous CS proteoglycans. When cell lysate of a stable transfectant was analyzed by Western blotting using a mixture of anti-proteoglycan ΔDi-0S, ΔDi-4S, and ΔDi-6S antibodies, three protein bands (* in Fig. 6A) appeared after CHase ABC treatment, but no band was observed at the location corresponding to NGC. Although CS chains were introduced into some endogenous proteoglycan core proteins in PC12D cells, this indicates that they were not incorporated into the NGC core protein, an exogenously expressed proteoglycan core protein. Attachment Site of CS Chain(s) on NGC Core Protein—As described above, when a wild type NGC cDNA was transfected into Neuro 2a cells, the expressed NGC bore CS chain(s) (Figs. 5C and 7B). Its molecular size was almost the same as that of NGC in primary cultures of neocortical neurons (Fig. 7A), 150 and 120 kDa before and after CHase ABC treatment, respectively. Therefore, by using this cell line, we determined the CS attachment site on the NGC core protein by site-directed mutagenesis. When a mutant NGC cDNA, which produces NGC with a mutation of S123A, was transfected into Neuro 2a cells, the NGC was observed as a band of 120 kDa regardless of CHase ABC digestion (Fig. 7C). Another five mutant NGCs, including one with the mutation S38A (Fig. 7D), were expressed as a chondroitinase-sensitive broad band of 150 kDa or a proteoglycan form. These results indicate that only one site, Ser-123, among the six potential sites on NGC was occupied by a CS chain. Although the NGC ectodomain can be phosphorylated by a casein kinase II-like kinase, the site of the phosphorylation is different from Ser-123 (27Yamauchi S. Tokita Y. Aono S. Matsui F. Shuo T.

Oohira A. Connect. Tissue. 2003; 35: 31-36Google Scholar). Cell Surface Localization of Normal NGC with a CS Chain and Mutant NGC without CS Chains in Neuro 2a Cells— Because there is a possibility that CS glycosylation is necessary for transportation of NGC to the cell surface, we examined whether NGC with a mutation of S123A was transported to and existed at the cell surfaces of Neuro 2a cells by biotinylating surface proteins. When the cells expressing normal NGC, which bears a CS chain (Fig. 5C), were subjected to biotinylation, many proteins were biotinylated (Fig. 8A, lane 1), including the 120-kDa doublet (Fig. 8A, lane 2) that was immunoreactive with the anti-NGC antibody (Fig. 8A, lane 3). NGC with a mutation of S123A does not bear any CS chains as shown in Fig. 7C. Unexpectedly, the mutant NGC molecules were also biotinylated, when the cell surfaces of Neuro 2a cells stably expressing the mutant molecules were biotinylated (Fig. 8B, lanes 2 and 3). These findings indicate that NGC can be transported to the cell surface regardless of its CS glycosylation. In the present study, we demonstrated that the CS glycosylation of NGC occurred depending on cell type as well as on developmental stage of the CNS. Neurons in culture and Neuro 2a cells transfected with an NGC cDNA expressed a proteoglycan form of NGC. Site-directed mutagenesis using Neuro 2a cells revealed that NGC has only one CS chain at Ser-123 of the mouse NGC sequence. Intracellular trafficking of NGC to the cell surface occurred regardless of the CS glycosylation in Neuro 2a cells. NGC Expression by Neurons and Astrocytes in Culture— Immunohistochemical analysis has demonstrated that the NGC immunoproducts are largely observed in association with neuronal structures (7Watanabe E. Maeda N. Matsui F. Kushima Y. Noda M. Oohira A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26876-26882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Glial structures are seldom stained with anti-NGC antibodies in the brain. In the present study, we found that astrocytes in culture as well as neurons expressed NGC (Fig. 4). Astrocytes in culture often synthesize molecules that are not synthesized in vivo (4Oohira A. Katoh-Semba R. Watanabe E. Matsui F. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 20: 195-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 29Asher R.A. Morgenstern D.A. Fidler P.S. Adcock K.H. Oohira A. Braistead J.E. Levine J.M. Margolis R.U. Rogers J.H. Fawcett J.W. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2427-2438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most surprisingly, although cultured neurons expressed a proteoglycan form of NGC, cultured astrocytes expressed a nonproteoglycan form (Fig. 4). Because cultured astrocytes can synthesize some CS proteoglycans such as neurocan and phosphacan in a proteoglycan form (4Oohira A. Katoh-Semba R. Watanabe E. Matsui F. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 20: 195-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), they must have the complete set of enzymes and substrates necessary for CS synthesis. Our results suggest that the CS glycosylation mechanism for NGC operative in neurons does not work in astrocytes. NGC Expression by Cell Lines Transfected with NGC cDNA—The transfection of mammalian cells with cDNA coding a proteoglycan core protein generally produces proteoglycan-bearing glycosaminoglycan chains (30Mann D.M.

Biol. 1996; 6: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In the present study, we transfected an NGC cDNA into three mammalian cell lines: Neuro 2a cells, COS 1 cells, and PC12D cells. Although the transfected Neuro 2a cells produced NGC bearing a CS chain, the other cell lines produced NGC without any CS chains (Fig. 5). COS 1 cells transfected with a cDNA of decorin, a small proteoglycan bearing only one chondroitin/dermatan sulfate chain, do produce decorin in a proteoglycan form (30Mann D.M. Yamaguchi Y. Bourdon M.A. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5317-5323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the glycosylation of decorin is regulated in a manner different from that of NGC in COS 1 cells. Similarly, PC 12D cells transfected with an NGC cDNA produced some intrinsic CS proteoglycans (Fig. 6) but could not synthesize a proteoglycan form of NGC. All these findings suggest that the CS glycosylation of NGC is controlled by a particular mechanism quite different from that of other CS proteoglycans. Neuro 2a cells could be a good experimental model to study the CS glycosylation mechanism for NGC and possibly the functional role of the CS moiety of NGC. CS Attachment Sites of CS Proteoglycans—CS glycosylation occurs recognizing Ser-Gly dipeptides that have one or more acidic amino acids in close proximity (34Esko J.D. Zhang L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of the CS attachment site of NGC, -TAEAGSGDAQT-, meets this criterion. Four -GS/SG-sites other than the site identified also have one or more acidic amino acids in close proximity (Fig. 1), but CS glycosylation did not occur at these sites (Fig. 7). Enzymes involved in CS synthesis would recognize not only the consensus sequence for CS glycosylation but also the other structural features of NGC. If some post-translational modification occurs at amino acids in the consensus sequence or in the other enzyme-recognizing areas, the CS glycosylation of NGC should be inhibited. As the NGC core protein is post-translationally modified in various ways such as phosphorylation (27Yamauchi S. Tokita Y. Aono S. Matsui F. Shuo T. Ito H. Kato K. Kasahara K. Oohira A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20583-20590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and glycosylation (19Shuo T. Aono S. Matsui F. Tokita Y. Maeda H. Shimada K. Oohira A. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 20: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), some of these modifications might be implicated in the regulation of the CS glycosylation of NGC. CS Glycosylation and Intracellular Trafficking—Glycosylation is considered to be a fundamental step of intracellular trafficking of some cell surface or secretory glycoproteins. For example, Cai et al. (35Cai B. Tomida A. Mikami K. Nagata K. Tsuruo T. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) have reported that underglycosylated epidermal growth factor receptor cannot be translocated to the cell surface resulting in a down-regulation of the EGF signaling pathway through the formation of a stable complex with GRP78/BiP, a molecular chaperone in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Additionally, it has been suggested that the glycosaminoglycan moiety of proteoglycans functions as a sorting signal in some cases (for a review see Ref. 36Prydz K. Dalen K.T. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 193-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because our previous immunoelectron microscopic study demonstrated that the hypolemmal cisternae, layers of ER, of the Purkinje cell dendrites in the mature mouse cerebellum were intensively immunostained for NGC (11Aono S. Keino H. Ono T. Yasuda Y. Tokita Y. Matsui F. Taniguchi M. Sonta S. Oohira A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 337-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that NGC without the CS chain could not be translocated to the cell surface like the EGF receptor, and that a signaling pathway related to NGC could be down-regulated in the mature CNS, especially in the cerebellum. NGC with a mutation of S123A, which does not bear any CS chains (Fig. 7C), was susceptible to cell surface biotinylation (Fig. 8), indicating that even a nonproteoglycan form of NGC can be transported to the cell surface at least in Neuro 2a cells. CS glycosylation would not be a essential step for intracellular trafficking of NGC."
https://openalex.org/W2153784600,"We have previously characterized the early intermediates of mariner transposition. Here we characterize the target interactions that occur later in the reaction. We find that, in contrast to the early transposition intermediates, the strand transfer complex is extremely stable and difficult to disassemble. Transposase is tightly bound to the transposon ends constraining rotation of the DNA at the single strand gaps in the target site flanking the element on either side. We also find that although the cleavage step requires Mg2+ or Mn2+ as cofactor, the strand transfer step is also supported by Ca2+, suggesting that the structure of the active site changes between cleavage and insertion. Finally, we show that, in contrast to the bacterial cut and paste transposons, mariner target interactions are promiscuous and can take place either before or after cleavage of the flanking DNA. This is similar to the behavior of the V(D)J system, which is believed to be derived from an ancestral eukaryotic transposon. We discuss the implications of promiscuous target interactions for promoting local transposition and whether this is an adaptation to facilitate the invasion of a genome following horizontal transfer to a new host species.

Himar1 is a synthetic mariner transposon reconstituted by “mixing and matching” DNA sequences from almost identical elements in the horn fly, Hematobia irritans, and the lacewing, Chrysoperla plorabunda (1Robertson H.M. Lampe D.J. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1995; 12: 850-862PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lampe D.J. Churchill M.E.A. Robertson H.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5470-5479Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). mariner is a Class II DNA transposon that belongs to a superfamily of elements that includes Tc1 in eukaryotes and the more distantly related IS630-like 1The abbreviations used are: IS, insertion sequence; STC, strand transfer complex; TBE, Tris borate-EDTA; PEG, polyethylene glycol; PEC, paired ends complex; ANOVA, analysis of variance.1The abbreviations used are: IS, insertion sequence; STC, strand transfer complex; TBE, Tris borate-EDTA; PEG, polyethylene glycol; PEC, paired ends complex; ANOVA, analysis of variance. elements in bacteria (3Mahillon J. Chandler M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 725-774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Hartl D.L. Lohe A.R. Lozovskaya E.R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 337-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). mariner elements are extremely widespread in nature, but the vast majority are inactive due to large numbers of point mutations and deletions. The only active examples identified in insects to date are the Mos1 elements from Drosophila mauritiana and Drosophila simulans and a newly discovered mariner from an earwig (5Barry E.G. Witherspoon D.J. Lampe D.J. Genetics. 2004; 166: 823-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). DNA transposons are well adapted to bacterial hosts and may persist in the genome for an indefinite period of time. In contrast, DNA transposons have a short life span in eukaryotic species and tend to accumulate inactivating mutations during the invasion of a genome (see Ref. 6Lipkow K. Buisine N. Lampe D.J. Chalmers R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8301-8311Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar and references therein). Therefore, for survival, DNA transposons rely on frequent horizontal transfer between species. As a result of this unusual lifestyle, the presence or absence of mariner does not correlate with the established phylogeny of closely related host organisms. Conversely, almost identical mariner elements are found in more distantly related species (Refs. 1Robertson H.M. Lampe D.J. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1995; 12: 850-862PubMed Google Scholar, 6Lipkow K. Buisine N. Lampe D.J. Chalmers R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8301-8311Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, and 7Plasterk R.H. Izsvak Z. Ivics Z. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 326-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar and references therein). mariner elements are very compact and contain a single transposase gene, usually flanked by simple terminal-inverted repeats (for review see Ref. 7Plasterk R.H. Izsvak Z. Ivics Z. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 326-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). They transpose in the germ line and/or soma via a “cut and paste” DNA intermediate and duplicate a TA dinucleotide upon insertion. All of the classical DNA transposons such as mariner are descended from a common ancestor and have an RNase H-like structural fold in the active site with a characteristic DDE(D) motif. These residues serve to coordinate the catalytic metal ion and are shared by a diverse group of proteins including DNA polymerases, RuvC, the V(D)J recombinase Rag1, and the retroviral integrases. However, there are considerable mechanistic differences, even among the transposases. The structure of mariner transposons most closely resembles that of the bacterial insertion sequences (IS elements). However, there are important differences in the molecular mechanism of transposition between the prokaryotic and eukaryotic elements. For example, one apparently universal feature of the bacterial IS elements is that the first nick during the excision step generates the 3′-OH at the end of the transposon that is eventually transferred to the target site by a direct transesterification mechanism (8Mizuuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21273-21276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In mariner and other eukaryotic elements such as Activator and Tam3, the polarity of the reaction chemistry is reversed and the first nick generates the 5′-phosphate at the end of the transposon, for example (9Dawson A. Finnegan D.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 225-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These and other differences may be attributed to a founder effect in the eukaryotic lineage, but this seems unlikely considering other examples of horizontal transfer. More likely is that the differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic elements are ancient adaptations favored by the different scale and organization of the respective genomes. We have already characterized the early intermediates of Himar1 transposition and documented further important mechanistic differences to the bacterial IS elements (6Lipkow K. Buisine N. Lampe D.J. Chalmers R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8301-8311Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In contrast to the bacterial elements, our results suggested that Himar1 transposase can multimerize and initiate catalysis at a single isolated transposon end. This shows that the architecture of the mariner synaptic complex has more in common with V(D)J recombination, which is probably derived from an ancestral eukaryotic transposon. Here we have gone on to characterize the later steps of Himar1 transposition when the element selects a target site for insertion. Target interactions in the cut and paste bacterial transposons Tn7 and IS10 (Tn10) take place at a defined point in the reaction, either before or after excision from the donor site, respectively (10Craig N.L. Craig N.L. Craigie R. Gellert M. Lambowitz A.M. Mobile DNA II. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2002: 423-456Crossref Google Scholar, 11Sakai J. Kleckner N. Cell. 1997; 89: 205-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This difference reflects the adaptation of these elements to very different evolutionary strategies. Tn7 transposition is to a single unique site in the bacterial chromosome, which is captured before the potentially suicidal excision from the donor. In contrast, IS10 transposition is to random sites and it is probably an advantage to diffuse away from the cleaved donor site before target capture. In the present work, we find that Himar1 is more promiscuous than Tn7 or IS10 and can interact with a target either before or after excision from the donor site. This is another case in which mariner has more in common with the Rag proteins in V(D)J transposition than with the bacterial IS elements (12Neiditch M.B. Lee G.S. Landree M.A. Roth D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4302-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We discuss the structural implications of this finding and how it could account for the often-observed local transposition of DNA transposons in eukaryotic genomes. Plasmids and DNA—Plasmids pKL97 and pKL99 encode 27 bases from the 5′-end of Himar1 and are described by Lipkow et al. (6Lipkow K. Buisine N. Lampe D.J. Chalmers R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8301-8311Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). pKL105 is identical to pKL97 with the exception that a BsrDI restriction endonuclease site was introduced by PCR immediately adjacent to the transposon end. pKL104 was created by digesting pBluescriptII SK+ with PvuII followed by religation. This procedure removed ∼0.5 kb of sequences including the polylinker region. The transposon end fragments were generated by restriction digestion as defined in the figure legends. The DNA fragments were radioactively labeled and purified from polyacrylamide gels as described by Lipkow et al. (6Lipkow K. Buisine N. Lampe D.J. Chalmers R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8301-8311Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Protein Purification and Transposition Reactions—Himar1 transposase was purified as described by Akerley and Lampe (13Akerley B.J. Lampe D.J. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 358: 100-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and modified by Lipkow et al. (6Lipkow K. Buisine N. Lampe D.J. Chalmers R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8301-8311Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Transposition reactions described by Lipkow et al. (6Lipkow K. Buisine N. Lampe D.J. Chalmers R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8301-8311Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) were performed as follows. Transposition reactions (15 μl, unless stated otherwise) were assembled in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm NH4Cl, 250 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm CaCl2. Each reaction contained 500 counts per second of radioactively labeled linear transposon end DNA fragment. The absolute amount of DNA (given in the figure legends) varied slightly depending on the efficiency of the end-labeling step. Unless stated otherwise, transposase was added last and the reactions were initiated by the addition of 10 mm MgCl2 and incubated at 30 °C for the indicated time. Reactions were deproteinated by the addition of one-tenth volume of 1.5% SDS + 150 mm EDTA and heated to 75 °C for 10 min. The reaction products were separated by electrophoresis on TBE-buffered agarose gels. After electrophoresis gels were stained with ethidium bromide, photographed, and dried onto a sheet of HyBond-N+ membrane. Autoradiograms of dried gels were recorded on a FUJI phosphorimaging device. The Himar1 Strand Transfer Complex—Himar1 has a non-replicative mechanism in which the transposon is completely separated from the donor site by double strand breaks at both ends (Fig. 1A). The 3′-end of the transposon is generated by a nick precisely at the end of the element. However, the 5′-end is nicked at several positions, predominantly 2 bp within the element (2Lampe D.J. Churchill M.E.A. Robertson H.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5470-5479Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 6Lipkow K. Buisine N. Lampe D.J. Chalmers R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8301-8311Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To study Himar1 target interactions, we have used an in vitro insertion assay in which the transposon ends are provided as short radiolabeled DNA fragments (Fig. 1B). The first step of the reaction is the transposase-mediated synapsis of two transposon ends to form a paired ends complex (PEC). The Himar1 PEC has not been observed directly because it appears to be unstable during electrophoresis (6Lipkow K. Buisine N. Lampe D.J. Chalmers R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8301-8311Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, its existence has been inferred from the concerted integration of both transposon ends on either side of a TA dinucleotide (2Lampe D.J. Churchill M.E.A. Robertson H.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5470-5479Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 6Lipkow K. Buisine N. Lampe D.J. Chalmers R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8301-8311Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). PEC assembly is followed by cleavage of the flanking DNA to produce the double-end break complex. In principle, complete separation from the donor site would allow diffusion of the excised transposon and capture of a target site by random collision. Non-covalent target capture would be followed by the strand transfer step that joins the 3′-ends of the transposon to the target site (Fig. 1B). The non-replicative bacterial transposons IS10 and IS50 (Tn5) most closely resemble Himar1 in structure, and these have been shown to transpose by this mechanism (14Haniford D.B. Craig N.L. Craigie R. Gellert M. Lambowitz A.M. Mobile DNA II. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2002: 457-483Crossref Google Scholar, 15Reznikoff W.S. Craig N.L. Craigie R. Gellert M. Lambowitz A.M. Mobile DNA II. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2002: 403-422Crossref Google Scholar). Himar1 transposition reactions were performed with a supercoiled target plasmid and analyzed by TBE-buffered agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2). After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with ethidium bromide to locate the target DNA and the molecular weight markers, dried, and recorded on a PhosphorImager to locate the radiolabeled integration products. When the reaction is stopped by the addition of EDTA and SDS prior to electrophoresis, most of the integration events are located at the position of the supercoiled target (Fig. 2, lane 1). This shows that the linear insertion product has retained the supercoils originally present in the target plasmid. Transposase must therefore bind and constrain rotation of the single strand gaps on either side of the insertion site. When the transposition reaction is extracted with phenol to remove transposase prior to electrophoresis, the insertion product runs at the position expected for linear DNA (Fig. 2, lane 4). However, the STC is extremely stable and is partially resistant to treatment with EDTA, SDS, and proteinase K at 50 °C (lane 3). Resistance to SDS and proteinase K suggests that the STC has a compact structure that is difficult to perturb. This may seem surprising in view of the instability of the PEC, which does not even survive electrophoresis in a Tris acetate-EDTA-buffered gel (6Lipkow K. Buisine N. Lampe D.J. Chalmers R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8301-8311Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, this is a common feature of transposition reactions where the intermediates generally become more stable as the reaction progresses. The Target Commitment Assay Conditions—Integration of a transposon into a target site occurs in at least two stages (Fig. 1B). The initial non-covalent interaction between the transpososome and the target site produces a non-covalent target capture complex. This is converted into a STC by the strand transfer step of the reaction. The capacity of a transposon to engage in productive non-covalent target interactions can be assessed in staged reactions in which different target molecules are presented sequentially (11Sakai J. Kleckner N. Cell. 1997; 89: 205-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 12Neiditch M.B. Lee G.S. Landree M.A. Roth D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4302-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments with Himar1 in a simple buffer system, target commitment was detected before and after cleavage of the flanking DNA (see below). However, in similar experiments on V(D)J transposition, reactions were supplemented with polyethylene glycol (PEG) (12Neiditch M.B. Lee G.S. Landree M.A. Roth D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4302-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The authors did not discuss this point or the effect of PEG on the reaction as a whole. However, PEG is known to enhance many biological reactions in vitro, probably because it helps mimic the crowded environment within the cell (see “Discussion”). Preliminary experiments demonstrated that including PEG in Himar1 reaction enhanced target commitment. However, to understand the meaning and potential pitfalls of these results, it was necessary first to determine the different effects of PEG on the Himar1 reaction. Effects of Molecular Crowding on Himar1 Transposition—Himar1 transposition reactions were set up with the transposon ends encoded on radioactively labeled linear DNA fragments and supercoiled pBluescript as target (e.g.Fig. 1B). Concerted insertion of a pair of transposon ends close to each other on opposite strands of the DNA gives a linear product slightly larger than the target plasmid (6Lipkow K. Buisine N. Lampe D.J. Chalmers R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8301-8311Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The reaction was first titrated with transposase at 0 and 10% PEG (Fig. 3A). In the presence of PEG, the optimum transposase concentration is reduced from 8 to 2 nm. The reaction is extremely sensitive to an excess of transposase and is almost completely abolished by transposase concentrations only 4-fold above the optimum. This holds true both in the presence or absence of PEG. Thus, at 10% PEG, the optimum transposase concentration and the amount of transposase required to inhibit the reaction are both reduced to the same extent. This is consistent with the molecular crowding activity of PEG, which excludes large molecules from a significant proportion of the volume of the solution. The transposition reaction was titrated next with 0–10% PEG (Fig. 3B). The transposase concentration in this experiment was limited to 1 nm to preclude the inhibition of the reaction observed at higher concentrations. Under these conditions, 2% PEG has little effect on the reaction. However, at 10% PEG, the reaction is inhibited and only 20% of the insertion activity remains. Finally, to determine whether inhibition of the reaction is a kinetic effect, a time course was performed at 0 and 10% PEG (Fig. 3C). As before, 10% PEG reduced transposition to ∼20% but the kinetics of the reactions are similar and both are close to completion after 3 h. Ca2+Supports the Strand Transfer Step—All of the classical DNA transposases have a DDE(D) motif in the active site, which serves to coordinate the divalent metal ions required for catalysis, for example (16Davies D.R. Goryshin I.Y. Reznikoff W.S. Rayment I. Science. 2000; 289: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Divalent metal ions are probably also required to structure the active site, because they promote the assembly, stability, and/or conformational changes in the IS10, phage Mu, and V(D)J transpososomes (11Sakai J. Kleckner N. Cell. 1997; 89: 205-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 12Neiditch M.B. Lee G.S. Landree M.A. Roth D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4302-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 17Crellin P. Sewitz S. Chalmers R. Mol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5868-5876Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 19Savilahti H. Rice P.A. Mizuuchi K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4893-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Although the catalytic metal ion in vivo is almost certainly Mg2+, Ca2+ can serve as a structural non-catalytic analog in some systems. For example, Ca2+ increased target commitment in IS10 from 14 to 43% and it was also included in all of the incubation mixtures for V(D)J target commitment assays (11Sakai J. Kleckner N. Cell. 1997; 89: 205-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 12Neiditch M.B. Lee G.S. Landree M.A. Roth D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4302-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed insertion reactions to determine whether Ca2+ supported any of the steps of Himar1 transposition. No cleavage or insertion activity was detected with uncleaved transposon ends (data not shown). However, when the transposon ends are pre-cleaved with a restriction enzyme (Fig. 1A), Ca2+ supports strand transfer and yields a linear insertion product (Fig. 3D). This contrasts with IS10 where none of the catalytic steps is supported by Ca2+ but is identical to phage Mu and V(D)J transposition when the substrates are pre-nicked and pre-cleaved, respectively (19Savilahti H. Rice P.A. Mizuuchi K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4893-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 20Hiom K. Melek M. Gellert M. Cell. 1998; 94: 463-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The ability of Ca2+ to support integration suggests that the structure of the active site changes between the excision and strand transfer steps and represents another similarity between mariner and V(D)J recombination. Target Commitment in Himar1 Transposition—To assess the degree of target commitment with uncleaved and pre-cleaved transposon ends, a staged assay was set up in which two targets of distinguishable size are presented sequentially (Fig. 4, left panel). Transposase was first incubated with transposon ends to allow assembly of the PEC under non-catalytic conditions. Reactions with uncleaved transposon ends contained no Mg2+, whereas reactions with pre-cleaved ends were incubated on ice to suppress the strand transfer activity supported by the Ca2+ present in the buffer. During Stage 1 of the reaction, Target 1 is presented and incubated for 30 min to allow target interactions to become established. At Stage 2 of the reaction, Target 2 is added together with the catalytic metal ion Mg2+. After a further incubation period at 30 °C, the reactions were terminated and analyzed to determine whether insertions are biased toward the target presented during Stage 1 of the assay. This would occur if the transpososome is able to establish a stable non-covalent interaction with the first target that DNA presented and if this is a precursor to strand transfer into this target. If there is indeed a bias of insertions into the target presented during Stage 1, target commitment has occurred. Conversely, if the transposon inserts into both targets equally, no target commitment is observed. The target plasmids were pBluescript and a derivative with a 448-bp deletion spanning the polylinker. The target plasmids were in the supercoiled closed circular form so that insertion of a pair of transposon ends gave a linear insertion product of unique size after deproteination (Fig. 1B) (6Lipkow K. Buisine N. Lampe D.J. Chalmers R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8301-8311Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). When the targets were presented alone or when both targets were present at Stage 1 of the assay, the short target received slightly more insertions than the long target (Fig. 4, lanes 2–4). We did not investigate this difference extensively, but it appears that Himar1 inserted into the short target more efficiently because it contained a higher ratio of supercoiled to nicked circular DNA. This initial bias was taken into account when calculating the extent of target commitment (see supplementary material). When the assay is performed in the absence of PEG and the targets are presented together at Stage 1, there is a slight bias toward insertion into the short target as noted above (lane 4). However, when the short target is presented first in a staged reaction, this bias is even more pronounced (lane 6). When the long target is presented first, the bias is reversed and the long target receives slightly more insertions than the short target (lane 5). These results show that, in the absence of PEG, there is a significant commitment to the target presented during Stage 1 of the assay. Commitment is observed for both types of transposon ends, but the effect was noticeably stronger for the pre-cleaved ends. The assay was performed next with PEG added during Stage 2 of the assay in a mixture with the second target and Mg2+ (lanes 7–9). Under these conditions, there is strong commitment to the first target presented (compare lanes 8 and 9). Note that the addition of PEG at Stage 2 is identical to the target commitment assay for V(D)J transposition (12Neiditch M.B. Lee G.S. Landree M.A. Roth D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4302-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Finally, a third set of target commitment assays was performed, but this time PEG was added at Stage 1 of the assay in a mixture with the first target (lanes 10–12). Target commitment for both types of transposon ends is extremely strong, and almost all of the insertions are made into the first target presented. We considered the possibility that the strong target commitment was due to the failure of the targets to mix freely in the presence of PEG. However, this seems unlikely as PEG is widely used in molecular biology and is not know to prevent mixing. Also, if PEG prevented mixing, we would expect the total number of insertions to be much lower when the targets are added at Stage 1 in a mixture with PEG. This is clearly not the case for the reactions with the pre-cleaved ends (Fig. 4, compare lanes 4, 7, and 10 in the bottom panel). We also considered the possibility that the observed target commitment was a consequence of nonspecific binding of DNA to the transposase protein. However, this is also very unlikely as Himar1 transposition in vitro is insensitive to competitor DNA present in the reaction before the addition of transposase (6Lipkow K. Buisine N. Lampe D.J. Chalmers R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8301-8311Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). If the transposase had a strong nonspecific DNA binding activity, as observed for many bacterial transposition systems, it would be highly likely to perturb the reaction, particularly if it was present in the reaction before transposase. Therefore, we conclude that the strong target commitment when PEG is added at Stage 1 or 2 is a true reflection of Himar1 behavior. Quantification and Statistical Analysis of Target Commitment—Target commitment assays were repeated several times to allow quantification and statistical analysis of the results. The level of target commitment was calculated using the formula of Sakai and Kleckner (11Sakai J. Kleckner N. Cell. 1997; 89: 205-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), taking into account the slight bias of insertions into the short target (see supplementary material). The mean value from multiple experiments was plotted on a bar chart together with mean ± S.E. bars (Fig. 5). In the simple buffer system lacking PEG, target commitment was 6 and 22% for uncleaved and pre-cleaved transposon ends, respectively. This compares with 0.3 and 43% target commitment observed for IS10 transposition under the same respective conditions (11Sakai J. Kleckner N. Cell. 1997; 89: 205-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). When PEG was added at Stage 2 or Stage 1, target commitment was 40 and 70%, respectively, for both types of transposon ends. Target commitment for V(D)J transposition was not explicitly quantified but was close to 100% when PEG was added at Stage 2 of the assay (12Neiditch M.B. Lee G.S. Landree M.A. Roth D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4302-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). ANOVA statistical analysis was used to evaluate the significance of the effects of PEG and end cleavage on the target commitment assays (Table I and supplementary material). The ANOVA technique is designed to analyze the variance of an unbalanced proportional data set in a two-factor factorial design (21Montgomery D.C. Design and Analysis of Experiments. 4th Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997Google Scholar). All of the data points used to construct the bar chart in Fig. 5 were included in the analysis.Table IAnalysis of variance in a factorial design for influences on Himar1 target commitmentSource of variationSum of squaresDegrees of freedomMean squareF0p valuePEG14,126.74327063.3718.080.00002End cleavage765.2141765.211.960.17447Interaction193.957296.980.250.78218Mean ± S.E.9377.42324390.73Total24,463.33629 Open table in a new tab The p value for PEG was extremely low (Table I). This indicates that the molecular crowding activity of PEG caused a significant increase in target commitment when added at Stage 2 or Stage 1 of the assay. The increase in target commitment is particularly strong in the case of the uncleaved transposon ends (Fig. 5). Thus, although pre-cleavage of the transposon ends produces a 4-fold increase in target commitment in the absence of PEG, this effect is reduced to ∼1.1-fold when PEG is added at either stage of the reaction. This effect is reflected in the ANOVA analysis across the whole data set including all three PEG conditions where the p value of 0.17 was not highly significant. Overall, it therefore appears that there is significant target commitment with both types of transposon ends but that commitment is consistently slightly stronger in the pre-cleaved situation. Finally, over the whole data set, there was a p value of 0.78 for an interaction between the effects of PEG and whether or not the transposon end was pre-cleaved (Table I). This means that the absence or presence of PEG at any stage of the reaction affected target commitment to the same extent with either type of the transposon end. The lack of interaction between PEG and transposon end cleavage suggests that the forces that determine target commitment with the uncleaved and pre-cleaved transposon ends are identical. Stability and Topological Constraints on the Himar1 Complexes—The chemical steps of transposition involve no high energy cofactors. Therefore, the reaction intermediates tend to become more stable as the reaction progresses as thermodynamic energy is lost from the system. We have shown previously that the Himar1 PEC is unstable and does not survive electrophoresis in TAE-buffered polyacrylamide gels (6Lipkow K. Buisine N. Lampe D.J. Chalmers R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8301-8311Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, the STC is extremely stable and survives treatment with SDS or proteinase K (Fig. 2). This is similar to other transposition systems. For example, in phage Mu transposition, the STC is extremely stable and a specific protease must be recruited for disassembly of the complex and to allow replication (22Levchenko I. Luo L. Baker T.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2399-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Target Commitment and the Effects of Molecular Crowding—In the simple buffer mixture lacking PEG, Himar1 target commitment was 6 and 22% for uncleaved and pre-cleaved transposon ends, respectively (Fig. 5). This 4-fold difference is very small compared to similar experiments with IS10 where there is a 143-fold difference between target commitment with uncleaved and pre-cleaved ends (0.32 and 43% target commitment, respectively) (11Sakai J. Kleckner N. Cell. 1997; 89: 205-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Biochemical reactions in vivo can be influenced by a number of environmental factors absent from in vitro systems. For example, in bacteria and the eukaryotic nucleus, the concentration of the DNA alone is in the region of 10 mg/ml compared with 0.02 mg/ml in our target commitment assays. Furthermore, DNA condensation and aggregation are promoted by multivalent cations, DNA supercoiling, and molecular crowding. In the eukaryotic cytoplasm, macromolecules typically occupy 20–30% of the available volume. In some organelles such as the nucleus, the level of crowding is even higher in the range of 30–45%. All of the intracellular systems have evolved to deal with and to make use of the effects resulting from nonspecific interactions and volume exclusion. Although largely ignored in experimental biochemistry, crowding agents have proven essential for the in vitro reconstitution of DNA replication, transcription, cell division, and many other processes (23Minton A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10577-10580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). The effect of crowding can be positive or negative. Solubility and diffusion rates are decreased, whereas protein folding and binding are generally increased (24Ellis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 597-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar). As an example, the binding of the HU protein to Escherichia coli DNA is increased over 10-fold in the presence of 12% PEG (25Murphy L.D. Zimmerman S.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). When the Himar1 transposition assays were spiked with PEG at Stage 2 or Stage 1 of the reaction, target commitment with uncleaved and pre-cleaved transposon ends increased to almost 40 and 80%, respectively (Fig. 5). This large increase in target commitment is another example of the way in which molecular crowding preserves interactions between macromolecules. In IS10 and V(D)J transposition, target commitment assays were accompanied by a physical demonstration that the respective PECs were engaged in a stable non-covalent interaction with the target DNA (11Sakai J. Kleckner N. Cell. 1997; 89: 205-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 12Neiditch M.B. Lee G.S. Landree M.A. Roth D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4302-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Himar1 also produced similar non-covalent complexes with target DNA in gel shift experiments (data not shown). However, because the Himar1 PEC is unstable and does not survive electrophoresis (6Lipkow K. Buisine N. Lampe D.J. Chalmers R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8301-8311Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the significance of these complexes was unclear. Local Transposition—Clusters of transposons are present in many bacterial genomes. They are often found inserted within and adjacent to each other in phage sequences and pathogenicity islands, for example (26Buisine N. Tang C.M. Chalmers R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 522: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The reason is that they may be targeted to their own ends or may tend to insert into distorted or highly bendable DNA sequences, for example (27Pribil P.A. Haniford D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 28Loot C. Turlan C. Rousseau P. Ton-Hoang B. Chandler M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4172-4182Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In contrast, several different families of eukaryotic transposons have been shown to cluster over much greater distances. This finding suggests that they have a propensity to select target sites physically linked to the donor. For example, 1% of P-element insertions is within 128 kb of the donor site, which is 67-fold more than expected if there was no linkage between the donor and target sites (29Tower J. Karpen G.H. Craig N. Spradling A.C. Genetics. 1993; 133: 347-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the Ac/Ds family of elements, ∼50% of new insertions are linked to the donor site in maize, Arabidopsis, and tobacco. In Arabidopsis, 35% are within 200 kb with a further 50% within 1,700 kb (see Refs. 30Bancroft I. Dean C. Genetics. 1993; 134: 1221-1229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 31Machida C. Onouchi H. Koizumi J. Hamada S. Semiarti E. Torikai S. Machida Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8675-8680Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar and references therein). Similar clustering is also observed for members of the Tc1/mariner family. For example, of 15 Tc1 insertions isolated from the unc-22 gene in Caenorhabditis elegans, 8 were from a donor site on the same chromosome (32Fischer S.E. Wienholds E. Plasterk R.H. Genetics. 2003; 164: 127-134PubMed Google Scholar). Local transposition in the Sleeping Beauty element has been even more thoroughly documented, because it is used as a tool for generating mutations in eukaryotic species. In contrast to transposition from a plasmid, which produces a random distribution of insertion sites in HeLa cells, 50% of insertions from a chromosomal donor site are made into the same chromosome (33Vigdal T.J. Kaufman C.D. Izsvak Z. Voytas D.F. Ivics Z. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 441-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In the mouse germ line, 27% Sleeping Beauty insertions were within 200 kb of the donor site and 75% were in the same chromosome (34Horie K. Yusa K. Yae K. Odajima J. Fischer S.E. Keng V.W. Hayakawa T. Mizuno S. Kondoh G. Ijiri T. Matsuda Y. Plasterk R.H. Takeda J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 9189-9207Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Interaction with a target before excision from the donor site is one mechanism that would account for transposition to linked loci. However, it is possible that other mechanisms contribute as well, e.g. if the transpososome were to remain associated with the DNA flanking the donor site after excision. Indeed, there is evidence for this in V(D)J recombination where mutations in the Rag proteins can influence whether the coding ends (the equivalent of flanking DNA) are rejoined by homologous recombination or by non-homologous end joining (35Lee G.S. Neiditch M.B. Salus S.S. Roth D.B. Cell. 2004; 117: 171-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The difference in target selection between prokaryotic and eukaryotic elements raises the issue of whether there is a selective advantage for transposition to linked loci in eukaryotes. One possibility is that the difference is related to the lifestyle of eukaryotic DNA transposons, which rely on a high rate of horizontal transfer (Ref. 6Lipkow K. Buisine N. Lampe D.J. Chalmers R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8301-8311Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar and references therein). The cut and paste mechanism of transposition does not produce an increase in the number of elements per se. Such elements can only prosper in the germ line if the donor site is restored by homologous recombination from a sister chromosome or from another copy of the element located elsewhere in the genome. This does not present a problem once the element is established. However, the first few transposition events at the start of a genome invasion are likely to be crucial for the survival of the element. A copy of the element close by on the same chromosome may therefore help to ensure restoration of the transposon during repair of the donor site. Indirect support for this model is provided by the exchange of sequences polymorphisms among Tc1 elements (32Fischer S.E. Wienholds E. Plasterk R.H. Genetics. 2003; 164: 127-134PubMed Google Scholar). The pattern of polymorphisms acquired suggested that, after excision, repair is by the synthesis-dependent-strand-annealing pathway using the sister chromosome as template. After synthesis has extended into the transposon sequences, the template is switched to a different copy of the transposon elsewhere in the genome. Because homologous recombination after P-element excision in Drosophila has a strong cis bias (36Engels W.R. Preston C.R. Johnson-Schlitz D.M. Science. 1994; 263: 1623-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), it may benefit mariner transposons in this and other species to transpose to physically linked loci.

Several platelet receptors interact with type I and type III collagens, including GP Ia/IIa and GP VI. We recently described a new platelet receptor (TIIICBP) specific for a type III collagen-related primary binding sequence, the KOGEOGPK octapeptide. Here, we characterize platelet adhesion to the immobilized octapeptide and demonstrate that this adhesion 1) is Ca2+ and Mg2+ independent, suggesting a noninvolvement of GP Ia/IIa; 2) is not inhibited by an antibody against GP VI; and 3) triggers platelet protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Whereas TXA2 has minimal effects, released ADP via only P2Y12 potentiates platelet adhesion to the octapeptide. Octapeptide-induced platelet adhesion triggers platelet signaling through tyrosine phosphorylation of the 68 kDa subunit of TIIICBP, Syk, PLCgamma2, and FAK. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the FcR gamma-chain and LAT is also observed but to a lesser extent than with type III collagen, suggesting the requirement of GP VI for full tyrosine phosphorylation of FcR gamma-chain and LAT. The present study provides evidence for a critical role for the type III collagen-related KOGEOGPK octapeptide in mediating platelet adhesion and signaling, and consequently in platelet-collagen interactions.-"
https://openalex.org/W2003106943,"The regulation of non-voltage-operated Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane remains unclear. However, there is often a link between the physiological release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and opening of Ca2+ influx channels on the plasma membrane. This route has been referred to variously as store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOC), capacitative Ca2+ entry, and Ca2+ release-activated channel opening (CRAC), and often underlies the large changes in cytosolic free Ca2+ that accompany many stimuli in a wide variety of cell types. The linkage between Ca2+ store release and opening of Ca2+ channels on the plasma membrane has remained elusive for a number of years, perhaps in part because different mechanisms exist for this linkage, and are used to differing extents by different cells. We suggest here that one of the mechanisms that may operate in cells of the immune system, but that may be important elsewhere, involves the release of mitochondrial adenosine diphosphate ribose (ADPR) or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). There is accumulating evidence to support each of the steps necessary for a complete description of this ""Ca2+ store release to plasma membrane channel opening"" link, but to our knowledge they have not been connected before to make a coherent model.-"
https://openalex.org/W2068925828,"R67 dihydrofolate reductase (R67 DHFR) is a novel protein encoded by an R-plasmid that confers resistance to the antibiotic, trimethoprim. This homotetrameric enzyme possesses 222 symmetry, which imposes numerous constraints on the single active site pore, including a “one-site-fits-both” strategy for binding its ligands, dihydrofolate (DHF) and NADPH. Previous studies uncovered salt effects on binding and catalysis (Hicks, S. N., Smiley, R. D., Hamilton, J. B., and Howell, E. E. (2003) Biochemistry 42, 10569–10578), however the one or more residues that participate in ionic contacts with the negatively charged tail of DHF as well as the phosphate groups in NADPH were not identified. Several studies predict that Lys-32 residues were involved, however mutations at this residue destabilize the R67 DHFR homotetramer. To study the role of Lys-32 in binding and catalysis, asymmetric K32M mutations have been utilized. To create asymmetry, individual mutations were added to a tandem array of four in-frame gene copies. These studies show one K32M mutation is tolerated quite well, whereas addition of two mutations has variable effects. Two double mutants, K32M:1+2 and K32M: 1+4, which place the mutations on opposite sides of the pore, reduce kcat. However a third double mutant, K32M: 1+3, that places two mutations on the same half pore, enhances kcat 4- to 5-fold compared with the parent enzyme, albeit at the expense of weaker binding of ligands. Because the kcat/Km values for this double mutant series are similar, these mutations appear to have uncovered some degree of non-productive binding. This non-productive binding mode likely arises from formation of an ionic interaction that must be broken to allow access to the transition state. The K32M:1+3 mutant data suggest this interaction is an ionic interaction between Lys-32 and the charged tail of dihydrofolate.

R67 dihydrofolate reductase (R67 DHFR) 1The abbreviations used are: DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; wt, wild type; DHF, dihydrofolate, NADP(+/H), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (oxidized/reduced); CD, circular dichroism; pABA-glu, the para-aminobenzoic acid-glutamate tail of dihydrofolate; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; Quad3, the protein product of the quadruplicated R67 DHFR gene. is an R-plasmid-encoded enzyme that catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of dihydrofolate (DHF) to tetrahydrofolate. Its presence in bacteria confers resistance to the antibiotic, trimethoprim. This enzyme is not similar in sequence or structure to the chromosomally encoded DHFRs. R67 DHFR is a homotetramer, and the pore that traverses the length of the molecule is the active site. Surprisingly, the structure possesses 222 symmetry (1Narayana N. Matthews D.A. Howell E.E. Xuong N.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1018-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), which imposes numerous constraints on binding and catalysis. For example, the symmetry requires that for each binding site, there must be three additional, symmetry-related sites. However, solution studies find only two sites can be occupied simultaneously because of steric constraints. The possible binding combinations are two NADPH molecules, or two folate/DHF molecules, or one NADPH plus one folate/DHF molecule (2Bradrick T.D. Beechem J.M. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11414-11424Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Only the latter is productive. Thus binding of neither ligand can be optimized, and a “one-site-fits-both” approach is employed (3Howell E.E. Shukla U. Hicks S.N. Smiley R.D. Kuhn L.A. Zavodszky M.I. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 2001; 15: 1035-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 4Strader M.B. Smiley R.D. Stinnett L.G. VerBerkmoes N.C. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11344-11352Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Another constraint arising from the symmetry is that addition of a mutation to the gene results in four mutations per single active site pore. Although addition of one mutation might help DHF binding in one half of the pore, it will not necessarily help NADPH binding in the other half of the pore (or vice versa). Breaking the 222 symmetry of R67 DHFR by introduction of asymmetric mutations should help unravel how R67 DHFR functions. To allow introduction of asymmetric mutations, a tandem array of four, in-frame R67 DHFR gene copies has been constructed (5Bradrick T.D. Shattuck C. Strader M.B. Wicker C. Eisenstein E. Howell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28031-28037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 6Smiley R.D. Stinnett L.G. Saxton A.M. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15664-15675Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The resulting protein product (named Quad3) possesses a mass four times that of the R67 DHFR monomer. Each domain in Quad3 corresponds to a monomer in R67 DHFR. The linker sequence connecting the gene copies is the natural N terminus. The quadruplicated gene product is almost fully active with only a slight decrease in kcat (1.6-fold) and a slight increase in Km values (1.5-fold). All other studies suggest the quadruplicated gene product mimics the homotetramer very closely. Which mutations should be introduced into Quad3 to allow analysis of R67 DHFR catalysis? Previous studies have identified Lys-32, Gln-67, Ile-68, and Tyr-69 as the most critical residues in binding and catalysis (4Strader M.B. Smiley R.D. Stinnett L.G. VerBerkmoes N.C. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11344-11352Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 7Hicks S.N. Smiley R.D. Hamilton J.B. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10569-10578Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 8Park H. Bradrick T.D. Howell E.E. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1415-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 9Strader M.B. Chopra S. Jackson M. Smiley R.D. Stinnett L.G. Wu J. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7403-7412Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). 2The amino acids in the first monomer (A) are labeled 1–78; those in the second monomer (B), 101–178; those in the third monomer (C), 201–278; and those in the fourth monomer (D), 301–378. For brevity, when a single residue is mentioned, all four symmetry-related residues are implied. The monomer arrangement going clockwise in the crystal structure (1VIE.pdb) is ABDC. To minimize confusion in the quadruplicated gene construct, we have re-labeled the monomers 1234 (= ABCD) going clockwise. Therefore these residues were targeted for introduction of asymmetric mutations. The first asymmetric mutation studied was Q67H (6Smiley R.D. Stinnett L.G. Saxton A.M. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15664-15675Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This study focuses on the role of Lys-32 residues, and a third study considers the effect of Y69F mutations (see companion paper: Stinnett et al. (46Stinnett L.G. Smiley R.D. Hicks S.N. Howell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47003-47009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar)). What role is proposed for K32? Because both substrates are negatively charged (DHF possesses two carboxylate groups in its p-aminobenzoylglutamic acid (pABA-glu) tail and NADPH possesses a 2′-phosphate on the AMP ribose as well as the pyrophosphate bridge), the role of counter charges was considered. The only positively charged residue in the active site is Lys-32, and the symmetry-related positions of this residue are shown in Fig. 1. To examine the role of Lys-32 in R67 DHFR function, mutagenesis was employed. Unfortunately, all mutants destabilized the homotetramer, therefore salt effects were used to indirectly probe the role of Lys-32 (7Hicks S.N. Smiley R.D. Hamilton J.B. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10569-10578Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 10.Hamilton, J. B. (1997) The Effect of a K32A Mutation on R67 Dihydrofolate Reductase. M.S. thesis in Biotechnology, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TNGoogle Scholar). Increasing ionic strength was found to dramatically increase the Km values for both ligands. A smaller, but significant rise in kcat was also noted, indicating ionic interactions are involved in binding and catalysis (11Park C. Raines R.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 11472-11479Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 12Record Jr., M.T. Lohman T.M. De Haseth P. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 107: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Further support for the importance of Lys-32 in binding and catalysis comes from NMR experiments that find a chemical shift in the resonances associated with Lys-32 upon NADPH binding (13Pitcher 3rd, W.H. DeRose E.F. Mueller G.A. Howell E.E. London R.E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11150-11160Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Also, docking of NADPH into the R67 DHFR·folate complex predicts that Lys-32 likely forms an ionic interaction with the 2′-phosphate of NADPH, while a symmetry-related Lys-32 likely interacts with the γ-carboxyl group on the glutamate tail of DHF (3Howell E.E. Shukla U. Hicks S.N. Smiley R.D. Kuhn L.A. Zavodszky M.I. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 2001; 15: 1035-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Our simple model for binding and catalysis suggests Lys-32 guides the negatively charged ligands to the active site pore by establishing a positive electrostatic potential (3Howell E.E. Shukla U. Hicks S.N. Smiley R.D. Kuhn L.A. Zavodszky M.I. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 2001; 15: 1035-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Once the ligands near the active site, symmetry-related Lys-32 residues form direct ionic interactions with both NADPH and DHF. After formation of the ground state complex, at least one ionic interaction breaks, leading to hydride transfer. To evaluate the role of Lys-32 in R67 DHFR, asymmetric K32M mutations were generated using the tandem gene array that encodes Quad3. From studies of these asymmetric mutants, a revised model for Lys-32 in binding and catalysis is proposed. Construction of Asymmetric Mutants—Construction of asymmetric mutations in our tandem array is straightforward, because the gene copies are separated by unique restriction enzyme sites. We mutagenize each gene copy separately and then reconstruct the tandem array. This process has been previously described for production of asymmetric Q67H mutations (6Smiley R.D. Stinnett L.G. Saxton A.M. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15664-15675Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). All K32M mutants were verified by DNA sequencing. Growth and Purification—E. coli STBLII cells are able to maintain the tandem gene array without recombination (14Strader M.B. Howell E.E. Gibco-BRL Focus. 1997; 19: 24-25Google Scholar). Cells containing the desired clone were grown in TB media at 30 °C for 60 h in the presence of only 200 μg/ml ampicillin, because introduction of trimethoprim into the growth media results in random mutations within the gene sequences. DNA from each of the 12 liters for the K32M:1+3 and K32M: 1+4 mutants was isolated and sequenced to verify that each culture still possessed the appropriate mutations. Cells were lysed, and protein purified as described previously (6Smiley R.D. Stinnett L.G. Saxton A.M. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15664-15675Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). During the purification process, 0.1g/liter polyethylene glycol 3350 was added to all solutions because this addition minimizes aggregation (15de Bernandez Clark E. Schwartz E. Rudolph R. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 217-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and leads to higher protein yields. Mass spectrometry (intact mass by electrospray-ion trap (4Strader M.B. Smiley R.D. Stinnett L.G. VerBerkmoes N.C. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11344-11352Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)) was utilized to verify that the K32M:1+2 mutant protein had the correct molecular mass. pH Titrations—Wild type R67 DHFR is a homotetramer that undergoes a pH-dependent dissociation to two dimers (16Nichols R. Weaver C.D. Eisenstein E. Blakley R.L. Appleman J. Huang T.H. Huang F.Y. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1695-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This process can be monitored by fluorescence, because symmetry-related tryptophan 38 residues occur at the two symmetry-related dimer-dimer interfaces (17West F.W. Seo H.S. Bradrick T.D. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3678-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). At pH 8, Trp-38 is buried (tetramer), whereas at pH 5 it is exposed to solvent (dimer). The pH dependence of dissociation arises from protonation of symmetry-related His-62 residues that also occur at the dimer-dimer interfaces. Although Quad3 cannot dissociate due to the linker sequences tethering each gene copy product, it can undergo a transition from a “closed” form (active conformation, pH 8) to an “open” form (inactive, pH 4) (5Bradrick T.D. Shattuck C. Strader M.B. Wicker C. Eisenstein E. Howell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28031-28037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 6Smiley R.D. Stinnett L.G. Saxton A.M. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15664-15675Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The effects of pH on Quad3 were assessed in varying salt conditions at room temperature. The intensity-averaged emission wavelength, 〈λ〉, for each emission spectrum was calculated according to Royer et al. (18Royer C.A. Mann C.J. Matthews C.R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1844-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The pH profiles were fit to a simple ionization equation and normalized according to Bradrick et al. (5Bradrick T.D. Shattuck C. Strader M.B. Wicker C. Eisenstein E. Howell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28031-28037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism—Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded at 22 °C in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8) with 10 μm Quad3, K32M:1+2, K32M:1+3, and K32M:1+4 mutant R67 DHFRs using an Aviv Model 202 series circular dichroism spectrometer as previously described (4Strader M.B. Smiley R.D. Stinnett L.G. VerBerkmoes N.C. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11344-11352Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Steady-state Kinetics with Mutants—The steady-state kinetic behavior of each mutant was monitored as previously described (19Howell E.E. Warren M.S. Booth C.L. Villafranca J.E. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8591-8598Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed at 30 °C in either 50 mm MES plus 100 mm Tris, plus 50 mm acetic acid (MTH buffer) polybuffer (20Ellis K.J. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 405-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) or TE buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7) in the presence of various concentrations of NaCl to adjust the ionic strength. At least five subsaturating concentrations of NADPH and DHF were used to measure activity. Global fitting of the data to an equation describing the bi-substrate kinetic reaction of R67 DHFR used a non-linear subroutine of SAS (version 8.2 (6Smiley R.D. Stinnett L.G. Saxton A.M. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15664-15675Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar)). The NLINEK macro for use in SAS is available on the internet at animalscience.ag.utk.edu/faculty/saxton/software.htm. The extinction coefficient for the R67 DHFR reaction at 340 nm is 12,300 liters mol-1 cm-1 (21Baccanari D. Phillips A. Smith S. Sinski D. Burchall J. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5267-5273Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Ligand concentrations were calculated using an extinction coefficient of 28,000 liters mol-1 cm-1 at 282 nm for DHF (22Blakley R.L. Nature. 1960; 188: 231-232Crossref Scopus (345) Google Scholar) and 6220 liters mol-1 cm-1 at 340 nm for NADPH (23Horecker B.L. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1948; 175: 385-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic data for the K32M:1+3 mutant were obtained at 360 nm to more accurately assess the Km values. The extinction coefficient for the DHFR reaction is 5020 liters mol-1cm-1 at this wavelength. Extinction coefficients for NADPH and DHF are 4020 liters mol-1 cm-1 and 2630 liters mol-1 cm-1, respectively, at 360 nm. Fluorescence Quenching—Binding of NADPH or DHF to 2 μm protein at 4 °C was monitored in TE buffer containing 0.03 m NaCl (μ = 0.05) using tryptophan fluorescence (24Zhuang P. Yin M. Holland J.C. Peterson C.B. Howell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22672-22679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Data were fit to: Fl = Fo - 0.5 Fo [Ptot + Kd + Ltot - ((Ptot + Kd + Ltot)2 - 4PtotLtot)1/2], where Fl is the observed fluorescence, Ltot is the total ligand concentration, and Ptot, Kd, and Fo are variables describing the number of enzyme binding sites, dissociation constant, and fluorescence yield per unit concentration of enzyme, respectively (25Dunn S.M. Lanigan T.M. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8569-8576Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Sedimentation Velocity—Sedimentation velocity experiments were conducted in a Beckman Optima XL-I ultracentrifuge equipped with both interference and absorbance optics. Protein samples were dialyzed into TE buffer, pH 7, with 0.03 m NaCl added (μ = 0.05) and the dialysate was used as an optical reference. Varying concentrations from 0.6 to 5 μm of each mutated protein were loaded (400 μl of loading volume) into double-sector charcoal-filled epon centerpieces, and sedimentation velocity analysis was carried out at 50,000 rpm at 4 °C using an An50 Ti eight-hole rotor. Sedimentation velocity analysis was performed by direct boundary modeling by using solutions of the Lamm equation and the program Sedfit (Ref. 26Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar; see www.analyticalultracentrifugation.com). Partial specific volume, buffer density, and viscosity were determined using the software SEDNTERP (John Philo at AMGEN Corp.; see www.jphilo.mailway.com/download.htm). Nomenclature—The following system will be used to name each of the asymmetric mutants. The residue, residue number, and mutation will be listed first followed by a colon. The asymmetric location of the particular mutations will be indicated numerically, where 1 refers to gene copy 1, 2 refers to gene copy 2, etc. For example, a single K32M:1 mutant was constructed 3For simplicity as well as to provide consistent nomenclature with other asymmetric mutants (e.g. Ref. 6Smiley R.D. Stinnett L.G. Saxton A.M. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15664-15675Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar and Stinnett et al. (46Stinnett L.G. Smiley R.D. Hicks S.N. Howell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47003-47009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), companion paper), we use the K32M:1, K32M:1+2 or 1+3 or 1+4 nomenclature. However, the single mutation was actually placed in the second gene copy. Because of the 222 symmetry, the K32M:2 construct should be equivalent to a K32M:1 construct. The double mutants actually constructed were K32M:3+4, K32M:2+4, and K32M:2+3 (which should be equivalent to the K32M:1+2, K32M:1+3, and K32M:1+4 constructs from the 222 symmetry). These constructs were made because we were concerned that two K32M mutations at what corresponds to a dimer-dimer interface in wild-type (wt) R67 DHFR could be destabilizing. Thus we placed the two K32M mutations into gene copies 2 and 3. Our reasoning for this placement was to allow the wild type sequences in copies 1 and 4 to interact at the N and C termini and provide contacts to hold the domains together. where the mutation was placed in gene copy 1. Although three other single mutants could have been constructed, the 222 symmetry of wt R67 DHFR predicts they will be equivalent. Three double mutants were also constructed. The K32M:1+3 mutant contains two mutations: lysine 32 in gene copy 1 has been mutated to methionine, as has lysine 32 located in gene copy 3. The K32M:1+2 and K32M:1+4 double mutants also have two mutations in their respective gene copies. The non-equivalency of these constructs can be illustrated using the crystal structure for homotetrameric R67 DHFR (Fig. 1), where each monomer would correspond to a domain in Quad3 (2Bradrick T.D. Beechem J.M. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11414-11424Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 27Reece L.J. Nichols R. Ogden R.C. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10895-10904Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The four domains are labeled in a counter-clockwise fashion where domain 1 is located at the top, left position. Fig. 1 (B–D) compares the different topologies of the three double mutants. For the K32M:1+3 mutant, one side of the active site pore contains two wild-type Lys-32 residues, whereas the opposite side of the pore contains two mutant K32M residues (panel C). In contrast, both the K32M:1+2 and K32M:1+4 mutants contain one Lys-32 and one K32M residue on each side of the pore (panels B and D), although with different geometries between the mutations. Fig. 1E depicts the arrangement of the mutations with respect to a reverse image of the active site pore and shows our simple model for bound NADPH and folate derived from docking NADPH into R67 DHFR-FolI (3Howell E.E. Shukla U. Hicks S.N. Smiley R.D. Kuhn L.A. Zavodszky M.I. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 2001; 15: 1035-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Because the K32M mutation destabilizes homotetrameric R67 DHFR, triple and quadruple mutants were not constructed. Physical Studies of the Apo Proteins—To examine whether the gene quadruplication event altered the salt sensitivity of the protein, pH titrations of Quad3 were performed in MTH buffer with various additions of NaCl (Fig. 2) (7Hicks S.N. Smiley R.D. Hamilton J.B. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10569-10578Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The data were fit, and the corresponding pKa values are given in the figure legend. It is apparent that addition of salt slightly stabilizes the protein. However, there is not a significant difference in the titrations near pH 7, where the majority of experiments are performed. pH titrations of the double mutants were attempted, however, asymmetric addition of the K32M mutation leads to increased aggregation. Visible turbidity usually appeared during dialysis or during strong mixing/shaking conditions, particularly for concentrated solutions. To minimize aggregation, the proteins were purified and maintained in buffer solutions containing 0.1 g/liter polyethylene glycol 3350 (15de Bernandez Clark E. Schwartz E. Rudolph R. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 217-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Although low concentrations of protein are stable at ≤4 °C, we were unable to perform pH titrations of 2 μm protein at room temperature. Because aggregation was a problem with these mutants, we evaluated whether the oligomerization state of the protein was altered using sedimentation velocity experiments. Sedimentation velocity profiles for each double mutant at 4 °C and at varying concentrations (≤5 μm) were fit using a continuous c(s) distribution model (Sedfit (26Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar)). The results clearly demonstrate the presence of a single species for all samples, with s values of 2.4, 2.4, and 3.4 for the K32M:1+2, K32M:1+3, and K32M:1+4 proteins, respectively. For all fits, conversion to a continuous molar mass distribution model demonstrated that all three mutants are of the same molecular mass (∼30 kDa). (From the gene sequence, the expected molecular mass is ∼33.5 kDa, thus these mutants are monomeric under these conditions.) It is likely that the observed difference in the S value for K32M:1+4 reflects an alteration in its molecular shape compared with the K32M:1+2 and K32M:1+3 mutants. Because the K32M mutations in this asymmetric mutant both occur at what would correspond to one dimer-dimer interface in homotetrameric R67 DHFR, this “interface” appears perturbed in the apo K32M:1+4 mutant (see Fig. 1D). CD spectra for each of the K32M double mutants at pH 8 are given as Supplemental Material. The signals for the K32M:1+2 and K32M:1+3 mutants show some changes with respect to Quad3, whereas the spectrum for the K32M:1+4 mutant displays greater differences. These differences could describe some level of conformational change in the proteins and/or alterations in the contribution of aromatic residues to the signal. Aromatic residues contribute significantly to the CD signal in R67 DHFR (17West F.W. Seo H.S. Bradrick T.D. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3678-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), in accord with general observations by Woody (28Woody R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 34-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Because Lys-32 is near Trp-38 (closest approach, ∼4 Å), mutation to K32M could potentially affect the CD signal. All the above physical studies suggest addition of one or more K32M mutations results in some level of structural destabilization. Occam's razor suggests the simplest interpretation is alteration of the structure at what would correspond to the dimer-dimer interface(s) in homotetrameric R67 DHFR. Although only limited conformational changes cannot be proven, the steady-state kinetic data below suggest addition of one or more ligands provides sufficient contacts to restore the active site structure. Binding of NADPH Monitored by Fluorescence Quenching—To monitor how the mutations affect NADPH binding, a fluorescence quenching approach was used (at 4 °C). This technique only monitors binding at the first tight site, yielding Kd1 (2Bradrick T.D. Beechem J.M. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11414-11424Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The titrations are shown in Fig. 3A, and the fitted values are given in Table I. The tightest Kd1 values are associated with Quad3 and the single mutant, K32M:1, followed by K32M: 1+3, and then by the K32M:1+2 and K32M:1+4 double mutants, which are quite similar in their behavior.Table IFluorescence quenching of Quad3 and the K32M mutants by NADPH These experiments were performed at 4 °C in TE buffer, pH 7, in the presence of 0.03 m NaCl (μ = 0.05) and 0.1g/liter polyethylene glycol.SpeciesKd1μmQuad31.0 ± 0.1K32M:11.2 ± 0.04K32M:1+29.7 ± 0.7K32M:1+35.2 ± 0.5K32M:1+48.4 ± 0.4 Open table in a new tab Another difference between the titrations is the percent quench observed. Similar quenches were observed for Quad3, K32M:1, as well as the K32M:1+3 mutant, suggesting related binding modes. Smaller quenches were observed for the K32M: 1+2 and K32M:1+4 mutants, suggesting either NADPH binds differently, or the environment of Trp-38 (which monitors the titration (17West F.W. Seo H.S. Bradrick T.D. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3678-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar)) is altered by a proximal K32M mutation. Binding of DHF Monitored by Fluorescence Quenching— Binding of DHF to the various mutants was also performed at 4 °C. Particularly for weaker binding mutants, the background quench associated with addition of DHF becomes substantial, precluding accurate fitting. Thus the DHF binding data monitored by fluorescence quenching are presented qualitatively in Fig. 3B. Binding of DHF to both Quad3 and the single mutant (K32M:1) proteins yielded titrations that were mostly complete upon addition of ∼7 μm ligand. An intermediate titration with a reduced quench was observed for DHF binding to the K32M: 1+4 mutant. Finally, the K32M:1+2 and K32M:1+3 double mutants both show minimal quenching as well as much weaker binding. Alterations in the percent quench could describe either changes in the number of DHF molecules bou"
https://openalex.org/W2076696522,"Poly(C)-binding proteins (PCBPs) constitute a family of nucleic acid-binding proteins that play important roles in a wide spectrum of regulatory mechanisms. The diverse functions of PCBPs are dependent on the ability of the PCBPs to recognize poly(C) sequences with high affinity and specificity. PCBPs contain three copies of KH (hnRNP Khomology) domains, which are responsible for binding nucleic acids. We have determined the NMR structure of the first KH domain (KH1) from PCBP2. The PCBP2 KH1 domain adopts a structure with three α-helices packed against one side of a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet. Specific binding of PCBP2 KH1 to a number of poly(C) RNA and DNA sequences, including the C-rich strand of the human telomeric DNA repeat, the RNA template region of human telomerase, and regulatory recognition motifs in the poliovirus-1 5′-untranslated region, was established by monitoring chemical shift changes in protein 15N-HSQC spectra. The nucleic acid binding groove was further mapped by chemical shift perturbation upon binding to a six-nucleotide human telomeric DNA. The binding groove is an α/β platform formed by the juxtaposition of two α-helices, one β-strand, and two flanking loops. Whereas there is a groove in common with all of the DNA and RNA binders with a hydrophobic floor accommodating a three-residue stretch of C residues, nuances in recognizing flanking residues are provided by hydrogen bonding partners in the KH domain. Specific interactions of PCBP2 KH1 with telomeric DNA and telomerase RNA suggest that PCBPs may participate in mechanisms involved in the regulation of telomere/telomerase functions.

Liebhaber S.A. RNA (N.Y.). 2002; 8: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar and 2Gamarnik A.V. Andino R. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2219-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar)). To date, five major members of the PCBP family have been identified in mammalian cells, namely PCBP1–4 (also known as αCP1–4; PCBP1 and -2 are also known as hnRNP E1 and E2) and hnRNP K. These PCBP proteins are evolutionarily related, as revealed by comparative analyses of the protein and gene structures (1Makeyev A.V. Liebhaber S.A. RNA (N.Y.). 2002; 8: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Except PCBP1, whose mRNA is intron-less, all PCBPs are known to have different isoforms because of alternative splicing. Most often, the PCBPs contain three copies of a conserved RNA-binding motif known as the KH domain (hnRNP Khomology), one of the most frequently occurring RNA-binding modules. The arrangement of the three KH domains is similar in each of the PCBPs: two consecutive KH domains at the N terminus and a third KH domain at the C terminus, with an intervening sequence of variable length between the second and third domains (Fig. 1A). PCBP proteins play important roles in a wide spectrum of regulation mechanisms in mammalian cells, at both the transcriptional control and post-transcriptional control levels, as well as in apoptotic and developmental pathways (1Makeyev A.V. Liebhaber S.A. RNA (N.Y.). 2002; 8: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). It has been shown that binding of PCBPs to pyrimidine-rich sequences within the 3′-UTRs of a number of cellular mRNAs confers unusual stability to these mRNAs, including α-globin (3Weiss I.

Blood. 1999; 93: 2111-2120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) mRNAs. Interaction between PCBPs and 3′-UTR pyrimidine-rich sequences can also result in translational silencing, as seen in 15-lipoxygenase mRNA (9Ostareck-Lederer A. Ostareck D.H. Standart N. Thiele B.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1476-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 10Ostareck D.H. Ostareck-Lederer A. Wilm M. Thiele B.J. Mann M. Hentze M.W.

Cell. 2001; 104: 281-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the PCBP binding sequences in the stabilized mRNAs and the silenced mRNAs are very similar, each containing three C-rich patches. The difference lies in that the PCBP-binding motifs always appear in tandem in the silenced mRNAs; a minimum of two repeats is required for function. Correspondingly, the stabilizing complexes involve only a single molecule of PCBP1 or PCBP2, whereas in the silencing complexes, two PCBPs are involved: hnRNP K and PCBP1 or -2. Besides cellular RNAs, PCBPs also critically participate in the regulation of viral RNA functions. It was shown that the 5′-UTR of Poliovirus mRNA (which is also the genomic RNA) harbors two binding sites for PCBP1 or -2. Binding of PCBP2 to one of the sites, a C-rich internal bulge sequence known as loop B RNA within the IRES (internal ribosomal entry site) element, is required for cap-independent translation of the viral RNA (12Blyn L.B. Swiderek K.M. Richards O. Stahl D.C. Semler B.L. Ehrenfeld E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11115-11120Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 13Blyn L.B. Towner J.S. Semler B.L.

Binding of PCBP1 or -2 to the other site, a C-rich loop in the stem-loop B domain within a so-called cloverleaf-like RNA structure, achieves high affinity only in the presence of the viral protein 3CD (precursor of the viral protease 3C and the viral polymerase 3D) bound to a different part of the cloverleaf. Formation of the PCBP-cloverleaf-3CD ternary complex inhibits translation and switches the viral RNA to a template for RNA replication (15Gamarnik A.V. Andino R. Gene Dev. 1998; 12: 2293-2304Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 17Andino R. Rieckhof G.E. Baltimore D. Cell. 1990; 63: 369-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Unlike PCBP-binding sites within 3′-UTRs of the cellular mRNAs, the two viral C-rich recognition sequences are presented in the context of a structured RNA, as demonstrated by our recent NMR structures of two sequence variants of the loop B RNA (18Du Z. Ulyanov N.B. Yu J. Andino R. James T.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5757-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Involvement of PCBPs in regulating RNA functions is certainly not limited to the cases mentioned above. A recent study has identified 160 mRNA species that associate in vivo with PCBP2 from a human hematopoietic cell line (19Waggoner S.A. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7055-7067Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), suggesting that the contribution of PCBPs in post-transcriptional gene regulation may be far more profound than currently known. Moreover, PCBP actions may not be limited to mRNAs. For example, an interaction between a PCBP4 isoform known as MCG10 or PCBP4b and the C-rich RNA template region of human telomerase has been proposed as a possible mechanism for the functional role of PCBP4b as a p53-induced regulator in apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at G2-M (20Zhu J. Chen X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5602-5618Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) Biological functions of PCBPs are further diversified by their ability to interact specifically with not only RNA but also DNA sequences. Specific binding of hnRNP K to the single-stranded pyrimidine-rich sequence in the promoter of the human c-myc gene activates transcription (21Tomonaga T. Levens D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5830-5835Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). It was also shown that hnRNP K could recognize the C-rich strand of human telomeric DNA with high affinity (22Lacroix L. Lienard H. Labourier E. Djavaheri-Mergny M. Lacoste J. Leffers H. Tazi J. Helene C. Mergny J.-L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1564-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This property of high-affinity binding to telomeric repeats has recently been extended to PCBP1. Using affinity chromatography and mass spectroscopy, Bandiera and co-workers (23Bandiera A. Tell G. Marsich E. Scaloni A. Pocsfalvi G. Akindahunsi A.A. Cesaratto L. Manzini G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 409: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) had identified PCBP1 as the most specific C-rich telomeric DNA binder in the K562 human cell line. The authors also implied that PCBP2 should share a similar binding property based on the high degree of homology between PCBP2 and PCBP1 (82% identical, 88% positive; the three nucleic acid-binding KH domains share an even higher degree of homology, which is 93% identical and 97% positive collectively, see Fig. 1B), and the remarkable similarity between high affinity SELEX RNA target sequences for PCBP2, W2–6[C3–5W2–6]3–4, W is A or U (24Thisted T. Lyakhov D.L. Liebhaber S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17484-17496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and the C-rich human telomeric repeats, (CCCTAA)n. Further studies are needed to confirm the interaction between the PCBPs and human telomeric DNA, and to assign the functional importance of such an interaction. Given all the current knowledge about PCBPs, it is very intriguing to note that the highly diverse functional roles of PCBPs are nearly all dependent on the ability to recognize C-rich RNA or DNA sequences with high specificity and affinity. It is known that individual KH domains from PCBPs can bind nucleic acids as discrete and independent entities (25Dejgaard K. Leffers H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). With the presence of three KH domains in the PCBPs, it would be very interesting to discover which KH domain, or synergy of domains, contributes to the nucleic acidbinding specificity and affinity. It would also be important to reveal the detailed interactions defining specificity and affinity, and how the seemingly similar events of binding to single-stranded C-rich motifs give rise to the very broad spectrum of functional diversities. In an effort to address these fundamentally important questions regarding structures and functions of PCBPs, we have begun a program to study the nucleic acid-protein interactions with a focus on PCBP2. So far, a large number of nucleic acid targets have been established or proposed for PCBP2. This portfolio covers both RNA and DNA sequences, both naturally occurring and SELEX motifs, and both non-structured and highly structured RNAs. Moreover, there is relatively good knowledge about the nucleic acid-binding property of the three KH domains from PCBP2; it was shown that both the KH1 and KH3 domains as independent entities could bind strongly to poly(C) ribohomopolymers (25Dejgaard K. Leffers H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar); however, only the KH1 domain was shown to interact specifically with the two C-rich sequences presented within the cloverleaf and the IRES structures from the Poliovirus 5′-UTR. With all these data, there is no doubt that PCBP2 represents one of the best biochemically characterized proteins not only in the PCBP subfamily but also in the superfamily of KH domain-containing proteins (considering that no bona fide nucleic acid targets have been identified for most of the known KH domain-containing proteins). Detailed structural study on the PCBP2 system should provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of PCBP functions in particular, and KH domain-mediated processes in general. As part of our continuing research effort, we have determined the solution structure of the first KH1 domain from PCBP2 and characterized its interaction with DNA and RNA targets including sequences from cellular mRNA, Poliovirus RNA, human C-rich strand telomeric DNA, and the RNA template of human telomerase. Sample Preparation—The gene that encodes the first KH domain (KH1) of human PCBP2 was amplified by PCR using appropriate primers and a plasmid containing the gene for full-length PCBP2. The amplified gene was cloned between NdeI and XhoI sites of plasmid vector pET 24a, so the protein was overexpressed with a C-terminal His tag. The cloned plasmid was transformed into a BL21(DE3) strain of Escherichia coli (Stratagene), and the bacteria were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium for unlabeled samples, or in M9 minimal medium with [15N]NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source and [13C]glucose as the sole carbon source for 15N-labeled and 15N,13C-labeled samples. Protein expression was induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at A600 = 0.6–0.8, and cells were harvested after a further growth of 3–4 h at 37 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0) and 50 mm sodium chloride and lysed by sonication. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant containing the His-tagged protein was added to a slurry of pre-equilibrated Tycon resin (Clontech) and incubated at 4 °C on a nutater for 2 h. The protein-bound resin was washed three times with buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0) and 300 mm sodium chloride. Elution of the His-tagged protein was achieved by incubating the resin in a buffer containing 25 mm sodium phosphate (pH 5.5), 25 mm sodium chloride, and 0.5 m imidazole for 10 min at 4 °C. The protein solution was dialyzed extensively against NMR buffer containing 25 mm sodium phosphate (pH 5.5) and 25 mm sodium chloride, and it was concentrated by centrifugation on Centricon 3 (Amicon) to 1–2 mm. For experiments in D2O, the proteins were lyophilized and redissolved in 99.996% D2O. Loop B and stem-loop B RNA samples with sequences illustrated in Fig. 3c were prepared by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase and a synthetic DNA template (26Milligan J.F. Uhlenbeck O.C. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar, 27Du Z. Yu J. Andino R. James T.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4373-4383Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For annealing, the RNA solutions were heated to 90 °C and slowly cooled to room temperature. DNA and RNA oligonucleotides were ordered from Integrated DNA Technology (IDT). Samples of the KH1-nucleic acid complexes for NMR studies were prepared by titrating solutions of the nucleic acids into solutions of the KH1 protein domain and monitoring the NMR signals of the protein in a 15N-HSQC spectrum. NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR experiments were performed on Varian Inova spectrometers operating at 600 MHz for protons. Spectra were processed with NMRPipe/NMRDraw (28Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11279) Google Scholar) and analyzed with SPARKY (29Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY 3.0 Ed. University of California, San Francisco, CA1998Google Scholar). In the two- and three-dimensional homonuclear and heteronuclear experiments, the States-TPPI method (30Marion D. Ikura M. Tschudin R. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 85: 393-399Google Scholar) was used to achieve quadrature detection in the indirect dimensions. All NMR experiments except those involving the anisotropic (liquid crystal) sample were carried out at 30 °C. 1H, 15N, and 13C resonance assignments were achieved by using the following three-dimensional heteronuclear NMR experiments: HNCO, HNCA, HN(CO)CA (31Bax A. Ikura M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1991; 1: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), CBCANH (32Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 6291-6293Crossref Scopus (918) Google Scholar), CBCA(CO)NH (33Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Magn. Res. 1992; 96: 432-440Google Scholar), HBHA(CO)NH, C(CO)NH, H(CCO)NH, 15N-TOCSY-HSQC, and HCCH-TOCSY (34Bax A. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 88: 425-431Google Scholar). Backbone φ and Ψ torsion angle restraints were derived from 3JHNHA values measured in a quantitative J correlation HNHA experiment (35Vuister G.W. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 7772-7777Crossref Scopus (1045) Google Scholar), and backbone chemical shifts were derived using the program TALOS (36Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar). Interproton distance restraints were derived from two-dimensional homonuclear NOESY spectra (60- and 150-ms mixing times), three-dimensional 15N-separated NOESY (80-ms mixing time), and 13C-separated NOESY (150-ms mixing time) experiments. Measurements of amide one bond N-H residual dipolar couplings were carried out at 25 °C by using a two-dimensional IPAP 15N-1H-HSQC experiment. Liquid crystalline media for measurements of residual dipolar coupling constants were prepared by stepwise addition with vigorous vortexing of microliter aliquots of hexanol to the protein solution containing 2.5% (w/v) of C12E6 until the solution became translucent. Dipolar coupling values were calculated from the difference in corresponding JNH splittings measured in the anisotropic (liquid crystalline) phase and in the isotropic phase. To monitor complex formation between the PCBP2 KH1 domain and various DNA/RNA molecules, we compared 15N-HSQC or TROSY-15N-HSQC spectra of the 15N-labeled protein before and after nucleic acid titration. It should be noted that although TROSY-type experiments are usually used in systems suffered from line-broadening as a result of increased molecular weight or exchanges and therefore suggestive of such problems, the choice of the TROSY experiment for some of the complexes in this study is largely a matter of personal flavor, rather than necessity. The TROSY experiment is less sensitive but has superior line shape because no decoupling is required during data acquisition. Because solubility of the KH1 domain and its nucleic acid complexes is generally quite good, we were able to perform our experiments at very high protein concentrations. Regular and TROSY-type 15N-HSQC spectra were used quite randomly in our studies without noticeable difference; with the only exception being the complex with a 34-nt RNA bulged stem-loop for which reasonable spectra could only be obtained using TROSY-15N-HSQC. Structure Calculations—In addition to the NOE-derived distance restraints, residual dipolar coupling restraints, and TALOS/HNHA-derived torsion angle restraints, generic hydrogen bond distance restraints were utilized for regions of regular secondary structure that were based on characteristic NOE patterns and secondary chemical shifts. Structure refinement was carried out by simulated annealing in torsion angle space using established procedures implemented in the program XPLOR-NIH (37Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Res. 2003; 160: 66-74Crossref Scopus (1831) Google Scholar). NMR restraint violations and structure quality were analyzed via the programs AQUA and PROCHECK_NMR (38Laskowski R.A. Rullmann J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4283) Google Scholar). Structure figures were generated using MidasPlus (39Ferrin T.E. Huang C.C. Jarvis L.E. Langridge R. Mol. Graphics. 1988; 6: 13-27Crossref Scopus (927) Google Scholar) or Chimera (40Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Pettersen E.F. Ferrin T.E. Pacific Symp. Biocomput. 1996; 1: 724Google Scholar) from the Computer Graphics Laboratory, University of California, San Francisco. Structure of the PCBP2 KH1 Domain—The secondary structure of the PCBP2 KH1 domain was defined by established NMR methods based on chemical shift indexing (CSI), backbone torsion angles derived from the HNHA experiment, and TALOS prediction, as well as characteristic NOE patterns. Fig. 1C shows the NMR-derived secondary structure, with a summary of the sequential and medium range NOEs characteristic of α-helices or β-strands, and CSI data taking into account of chemical shifts of amide proton, amide nitrogen, and α and β carbons. The secondary structure consists of three α helices and three β strands arranged in the order β1-α1-α2-β2-β3-α3. The evolutionarily conserved invariable GXXG loop is located between α1 and α2; the variable loop is between β2 and β3. As shown in Fig. 1C, measured one-bond amide H-N residual dipolar coupling values show different signs for the α helices and β strands, indicating the roughly parallel orientation of these secondary structure elements. The three-dimensional structure of the PCBP2 KH1 domain was calculated using residual dipolar coupling restraints in addition to distance restraints derived from NOE measurements and torsion angle restraints derived from scalar coupling experiments. Structure calculation statistics are summarized in Table I. Fig. 2A shows the backbone superimposition of the 20 final structures with the lowest energy penalty; Fig. 2B is a ribbon diagram of the structure with lowest overall energy. The spatial arrangement of the structural elements of the PCBP2 KH1 domain is that the three β strands form an antiparallel β-sheet, with a spatial order of β1-β3-β2; the three α helices are packed against one side of the β-sheet. The two loops, which are less ordered, point upward in the orientation shown and help to define the edges of the nucleic acid binding platform (details in later sections). The three α helices and the three β strands are all amphipathic in nature, with their hydrophobic residues pointing inward to form a hydrophobic core. The residues in the core (Leu-14, Ile-16, Leu-18, Ile-47, Ile-49, Ile-59, and Leu-61 from the β strands; Val-25, Ile-28, Ile-29, Val-36, Met-39, Ile-68, Ala-71, Phe-72, Ile-75, Ile-76, and Leu-79 from the α helices) are exclusively hydrophobic; most of these residues are isoleucines, leucines, or valines, which are the most hydrophobic amino acids (highest positive values for the Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy index). It therefore seems like a very high degree of hydrophobicity is sought in the core. This also provides a good explanation for the high degree of conservation for these residues among the KH domains (Fig. 1B). There are several sharp turns of the backbone in the molecule, at junctions between α1 and β1, β2 and α2, α3 and β3 (Fig. 2, A and B); all of these sharp turns are mediated by a glycine (Gly-22, Gly-44, and Gly-63, respectively, at the three junctions). Gly-44 and Gly-63 are highly conserved among the KH domains from PCBPs. Gly-22 is conserved among the KH1 domains, except from hnRNP K. For those KH domains in which a glycine is not present at position 22, a proline is most often used as a substitute at position 21 (Fig. 1B). The absolute conservation of Gly-30 and Gly-33 of the invariant GXXG loop (Fig. 1B) is also most likely because of steric consideration; the two helices (α1 and α2) connected by the GXXG loop assume a tight interhelical angle of ∼110–120°.Table INMR and structure determination statistics for PCBP2 KH1NOE-derived distance restraints780Intra-residue136Sequential267Medium range (i+2 to i+5)224Long range (>i+5)153Total hydrogen bond restraintsaIncludes two restraints per hydrogen bond70Total torsion angle restraints115Dipolar coupling restraints (1DNH)66r.m.s. deviation from experimental restraintsbAveraged over the 20 accepted structuresDistance restraints (Å)cNo violation >0.6 Å0.098 ± 0.004Dihedral restraints (°)0.000 ± 0.000Dipolar coupling restraints (Hz)0.59 ± 0.04Deviations from idealized covalent geometryBonds (Å)0.0026 ± 0.0002Angles (°)0.205 ± 0.001Impropers (°)0.74 ± 0.06r.m.s. deviation from mean structure (Å)bAveraged over the 20 accepted structuresBackbone0.47All non-hydrogen1.08Ramachandran plot analysisdChecked by PROCHECK_NMR (38)Residues in most favored regions (%)84.8%Residues in additional allowed regions (%)11.3%Residues in generously favored regions (%)3.2%Residues in disallowed regions (%)0.8%a Includes two restraints per hydrogen bondb Averaged over the 20 accepted structuresc No violation >0.6 Åd Checked by PROCHECK_NMR (38Laskowski R.A.

We first tested whether PCBP2 KH1 binds to a six-nucleotide RNA oligomer, 5′-UCCCCA-3′, which corresponds to one of the three C-rich patches comprising the RNA targets for PCBP2 within the 3′-UTR of the mRNAs of α-globin, collagen α1, tyrosine hydroxylase, and 15-lipoxygenase. This sequence also conforms to the SELEX consensus of PCBP2-binding RNAs. As shown in Fig. 3a, addition of this RNA oligonucleotide to PCBP2 KH1 causes very dramatic chemical shift changes in the 15N-HSQC spectrum; these include a couple of substantial downfield shifts unambiguously indicating the formation of a protein-RNA complex. To test whether this interaction is specific, we also titrated the protein with three other RNA oligonucleotides with the sequences 5′-UUUUUA-3′, 5′-UAAAAA-3′, and 5′-UGGGGA-3′, respectively. None of these oligonucleotides produced significant changes in the 15N-HSQC spectra that would suggest specific RNA-protein interaction (data not shown; an example of one such 15N-HSQC spectrum is included in the Supplemental Materials). To test the ability of the PCBP2 KH1 domain to interact with DNA sequences, four DNA oligonucleotides, which correspond in sequence to the four RNA oligonucleotides, were used as probes. Similar to the RNA sequences, only the DNA oligonucleotide 5′-TCCCCA-3′ could cause significant chemical shift changes in the 15N-HSQC spectrum (Fig. 3a). Comparing the 15N-HSQC spectra of the RNA and DNA complexes, it is clear that most of the chemic"
https://openalex.org/W2011773906,"R67 dihydrofolate reductase (R67 DHFR) catalyzes the transfer of a hydride ion from NADPH to dihydrofolate, generating tetrahydrofolate. The homotetrameric enzyme provides a unique environment for catalysis as both ligands bind within a single active site pore possessing 222 symmetry. Mutation of one active site residue results in concurrent mutation of three additional symmetry-related residues, causing large effects on binding of both ligands as well as catalysis. For example, mutation of symmetry-related tyrosine 69 residues to phenylalanine (Y69F), results in large increases in Km values for both ligands and a 2-fold rise in the kcat value for the reaction (Strader, M. B., Smiley, R. D., Stinnett, L. G., VerBerkmoes, N. C., and Howell, E. E. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 11344–11352). To understand the interactions between specific Tyr-69 residues and each ligand, asymmetric Y69F mutants were generated that contain one to four Y69F mutations. A general trend observed from isothermal titration calorimetry and steady-state kinetic studies of these asymmetric mutants is that increasing the number of Y69F mutations results in an increase in the Kd and Km values. In addition, a comparison of steady-state kinetic values suggests that two Tyr-69 residues in one half of the active site pore are necessary for NADPH to exhibit a wild-type Km value. A tyrosine 69 to leucine mutant was also generated to approach the type(s) of interaction(s) occurring between Tyr-69 residues and the ligands. These studies suggest that the hydroxyl group of Tyr-69 is important for interactions with NADPH, whereas both the hydroxyl group and hydrophobic ring atoms of the Tyr-69 residues are necessary for proper interactions with dihydrofolate.

DHFR activity is necessary for cell survival as tetrahydrofolate is involved in pathways leading to the synthesis of purine nucleosides and other metabolites (1Kraut J. Matthews D.A. Jurnak F.A. McPherson A. Biological Macromolecules & Assemblies. 3. John Wiley & Sons, New York1987: 1-71Google Scholar). Chromosomal (Escherichia coli) DHFR is inhibited by the antibiotic trimethoprim. However, plasmid-encoded R67 DHFR provides resistance to the antibiotic. The plasmid-encoded DHFR is unique in that it shows no genetic or structural homologies with chromosomal DHFR (2Narayana N. Matthews D.A. Howell E.E. Nguyen-huu X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1018-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 3Matthews D.A. Smith S.L. Baccanari D.P. Burchall J.J. Oatley S.J. Kraut J.

Several features of R67 dihydrofolate reductase are unusual. First, as a homotetramer with a monomer length of 78 amino acids, it is one of the smallest enzymes known to self-assemble into an active quaternary structure. Second, the structure possesses 222 symmetry as shown in Fig. 1 2The monomers of R67 DHFR are labeled ABDC going in a clockwise orientation in the crystal structure (1VIE and 1VIF in the Protein Data Bank). The residues in monomer A are labeled 1–78, whereas those in monomers B, C, and D are designated 101–178, 201–278, and 301–378, respectively. All four symmetry-related residues are implied when one residue of the homotetramer is described. The corresponding domains in Quad3 are relabeled 1234 (=ABCD) to minimize any confusion and provide consistent nomenclature. (2Narayana N. Matthews D.A. Howell E.E. Nguyen-huu X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1018-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Third, a pore, 25 Å long, extends through the middle of the enzyme (like a doughnut hole). Fourth, the symmetry, coupled with use of a single active site pore, results in overlapping binding sites for the two different ligands used in the reaction. For example, R67 DHFR binds a total of two molecules, either two NADPH, two folate/DHF, or one NADPH plus one folate/DHF (5Bradrick T.D. Beechem J.M. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11414-11424Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The first two are dead-end complexes, whereas the third is productive. (Interligand cooperativity patterns funnel the enzyme toward the productive ternary complex.) Fifth, site-directed mutagenesis results in four mutations per active site pore and large effects on binding and catalysis. Thus, it is difficult to produce local effects that could allow dissection of how each residue interacts with the ligands as well as the transition state. Although a generalized description of R67 DHFR catalysis exists (5Bradrick T.D. Beechem J.M. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11414-11424Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 6Li D.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15664-15675Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), additional detail can be obtained by introduction of asymmetry. To be able to introduce asymmetry in R67 DHFR, we have constructed a tandem gene array that allows control of the number and location of the mutation(s). Briefly, the tandem gene array contains four in-frame copies of the gene encoding wild-type (wt) R67 DHFR. Transcription and translation yield a monomeric protein (named “Quad3”) mimicking the wild-type enzyme. Quad3 is almost fully active (1.8-fold decrease in kcat/Km values), and all physical, binding, and steady-state kinetic studies indicate excellent agreement with wt R67 DHFR behavior (10Smiley R.D. Stinnett L.G. Saxton A.M. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15664-15675Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 11Bradrick T.D. Shattuck C. Strader M.B. Wicker C. Eisenstein E. Howell E.E. J.

Those residues identified as most important in R67 DHFR catalysis include Lys-32, Gln-67, Ile-68, and Tyr-69 (7Hicks S.N. Smiley R.D. Hamilton J.B. Howell E.E.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7403-7412Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The first asymmetric mutation series constructed to probe binding and catalysis involved the Q67H substitution (10Smiley R.D. Stinnett L.G. Saxton A.M. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15664-15675Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The companion paper (Hicks et al. (42Hicks S.N. Smiley R.D. Stinnett L.G. Minor K.H. Howell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46995-47002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar)) describes construction and characterization of a series of K32M asymmetric mutants. This study focuses on the role of Tyr-69 residues. What is the proposed role for Tyr-69 in R67 DHFR function? Docking studies suggest that these symmetry-related residues may be involved in interactions with both the substrate and cofactor (13Howell E.E. Shukla U. Hicks S.N. Smiley R.D. Kuhn L.A. Zavodszky M.I. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 2001; 15: 1035-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The ring edges of two symmetry-related tyrosine 69 residues dock within van der Waals contact with the pyrophosphate bridge of NADPH as well as with the adenine ribose. Docking studies also predict a possible interaction between the tyrosine hydroxyl and the glutamic acid tail of folate. Kinetic studies of the homotetrameric Y69F mutant also support the hypothesis that Tyr-69 interacts with both DHF and NADPH, because the Km values for DHF and NADPH are 11- and 17-fold weaker, respectively, than those for wild-type R67 DHFR (9Strader M.B. Smiley R.D. Stinnett L.G. VerBerkmoes N.C. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11344-11352Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition, the kcat for the reaction is 2-fold greater than the kcat for wild-type R67 DHFR. A less conservative substitution (Y69H) greatly increased both Km values as well as decreased kcat. Finally, a recent NMR study finds chemical shifts are associated with Tyr-69 upon NADP+ binding (14Pitcher 3rd, W.H. DeRose E.F. Mueller G.A. Howell E.E. London R.E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11150-11160Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A model of the docked R67 DHFR·NADPH·folate ternary complex is shown in Fig. 1E with the positions of the symmetry-related Tyr-69 residues indicated. Our approach to understanding the role of symmetry-related tyrosine 69 residues in ligand binding and catalysis in this report is 2-fold. First, we generated a series of asymmetric Y69F mutants, including a single mutant (containing one Y69F mutation), three double mutants (each containing two Y69F mutations), a triple mutant, and a quadruple mutant to better understand the specificity of the interactions between Tyr-69 and both DHF and NADPH. This approach allows us to determine if there is a preference for NADPH and/or DHF to interact with wild-type tyrosine 69 residues. Our second approach involved site-directed mutagenesis of tyrosine 69 residues within the homotetrameric enzyme to better understand the type(s) of interaction(s) occurring between symmetry-related tyrosine 69 and the ligands and how these interactions are involved in catalysis. Construction of Asymmetric Tyr-69 mutants—Asymmetric Y69F mutants were generated by PCR site-directed mutagenesis as previously described (10Smiley R.D. Stinnett L.G. Saxton A.M. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15664-15675Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Correct mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing and the DNA maintained in E. coli STBLII cells to avoid recombination problems (15Strader M.B. Howell E.E. Gibco-BRL Focus. 1997; 19: 24-25Google Scholar). Y69T, Y69K, Y69Q, and Y69L homotetrameric mutants were also generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. None of the cell lines transformed with these mutants were able to grow in the presence of 20 μg trimethoprim/ml. Because high protein expression was noted for the Y69L mutant, it was pursued. Protein Purification and Characterization—Proteins were purified as previously described (10Smiley R.D. Stinnett L.G. Saxton A.M. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15664-15675Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The asymmetric Y69F mutants were not as prone to aggregation as the asymmetric K32M mutants (companion paper, Hicks et al. (42Hicks S.N. Smiley R.D. Stinnett L.G. Minor K.H. Howell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46995-47002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar)); however, visible turbidity was sometimes noted at the high protein concentrations (∼100 μm) used in isothermal titration calorimetry experiments. Thus 0.1 g/liter polyethylene glycol 3350 was added to minimize aggregation as well as increase purification yields of the asymmetric mutants (16de Bernandez Clark E. Schwartz E. Rudolph R. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 217-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Steady-state kinetics were performed for each of the mutants to determine the corresponding Km and kcat values as previously described (Ref. 12Strader M.B. Chopra S. Jackson M. Smiley R.D. Stinnett L.G. Wu J. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7403-7412Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar and Hicks et al. (42Hicks S.N. Smiley R.D. Stinnett L.G. Minor K.H. Howell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46995-47002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar)). Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Isotherms were generated for substrate or cofactor binding to each mutant on a MicroCal VP isothermal titration calorimeter at 28 °C as described previously (5Bradrick T.D. Beechem J.M. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11414-11424Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 10Smiley R.D. Stinnett L.G. Saxton A.M. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15664-15675Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). MTH polybuffer (50 mm MES plus 100 mm Tris, plus 50 mm acetic acid; pH 8 (17Ellis K.J. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 405-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar)) was used for NADPH binding studies, whereas 10 mm Tris plus 1 mm EDTA buffer, pH 8, was used for DHF binding studies. Because DHF is a weak acid, the pH of the DHF solution was titrated to pH 8 prior to ligand binding studies. The data for NADPH binding to the mutants were analyzed by Origin software (Version 5.0) using both the single sites model and the sequential sites model where the stoichiometry was set to two. pH Titrations—Homotetrameric R67 DHFR dissociates into dimers upon titration with acid due to protonation of symmetry-related histidine 62 residues (18Nichols R.

This equilibrium is described by,T+2nH+⇆Koverall2DHnREACTION 1 where T is tetramer, DHn is protonated dimer, n is the number of protons, and Koverall equals [T] [H]2n/[DHn]2 and can be described by Ka2n/Kd. This dissociation process can be monitored by a change in fluorescence of symmetry-related tryptophan residues, which become solvent-exposed upon dissociation of the tetramer (18Nichols R. Weaver C.D. Eisenstein E. Blakley R.L. Appleman J. Huang T.H. Huang F.Y. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1695-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 19Park H. Zhuang P. Nichols R.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3678-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To determine if Y69L mutations in the homotetramer affect this equilibrium, pH versus fluorescence intensity profiles were generated. Data were fit as described previously by non-linear regression using SAS (18Nichols R. Weaver C.D. Eisenstein E. Blakley R.L. Appleman J. Huang T.H. Huang F.Y. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1695-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although the Y69F asymmetric mutants are unable to undergo a dimer to tetramer equilibrium, because the domains in Quad3 are covalently linked, it is possible for the domains to “open up” or “splay apart” upon titration of symmetry-related histidine 62 residues (10Smiley R.D. Stinnett L.G. Saxton A.M. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15664-15675Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 11Bradrick T.D. Shattuck C. Strader M.B. Wicker C. Eisenstein E. Howell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28031-28037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This process can also be monitored as a change in tryptophan fluorescence with decreasing pH. To determine whether Y69F asymmetric mutations had affected this process, pH versus fluorescence intensity profiles were generated. Data were fit to a simple ionization equation using SigmaPlot (21Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1999: 101-105Google Scholar). Nomenclature—The naming system used to name the asymmetric mutants follows the pattern established by our companion paper (Hicks et al. (42Hicks S.N. Smiley R.D. Stinnett L.G. Minor K.H. Howell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46995-47002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar)). Briefly, the Y69F mutation is listed followed by the number indicating the gene copy, which carries the mutation. For example, a single Y69F:1 mutant was constructed where the mutation was placed in gene copy 1. Three double mutants, one triple mutant and one quadruple mutant were also constructed. The double mutants are non-equivalent; this can be seen using the crystal structure for homotetrameric R67 DHFR (Fig. 1, B–D). A model of the NADPH·folate ternary complex that is consistent with NMR and crystallography constraints is shown in Fig. 1E along with the relative positions of Tyr-69, Lys-32, Gln-67, and Ile-68 residues (2Narayana N. Matthews D.A. Howell E.E. Nguyen-huu X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1018-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 6Li D. Levy L.A. Gabel S.A. Lebetkin M.S. DeRose E.F. Wall M.J. Howell E.E.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11150-11160Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition to Y69F asymmetric mutants, the effects of Y69L mutations in the homotetrameric enzyme were also assessed. This construct is named Y69L R67 DHFR and contains four symmetry-related Y69L mutations. Steady-state Kinetics—To gain a better understanding of the role of Tyr-69 in binding and catalysis, steady-state kinetic data were collected for each of the asymmetric Y69F mutants and are presented in Table I. In general, the Km values for NADPH and DHF as well as the kcat display a trend contingent upon the location and number of Y69F mutations. A wild-type Km (NADPH) value is observed for both the Y69F:1 and Y69F: 1+3 mutants, whereas the Km (NADPH) for the Y69F:1+2 and Y69F:1+4 mutants is ∼3- to 4-fold weaker. The Km (NADPH) values for the triple mutant and quadruple mutants continue to increase. The kinetic parameters for the Y69F:1+2+3+4 mutant are similar to those for Y69F R67 DHFR (9Strader M.B. Smiley R.D. Stinnett L.G. VerBerkmoes N.C. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11344-11352Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, for NADPH binding interactions in the productive, ternary complex, as the number of mutations increases, Km (NADPH) concurrently increases. The two exceptions to this trend are the Y69F:1 and Y69F:1+3 mutants, which both have wild-type Km values.Table IComparison of kinetic parameters for wild-type R67 DHFR, Quad3 DHFR, Y69F asymmetric mutants, Y69L R67 DHFR, and Y69F R67 DHFR at pH 7.0Enzyme variantkcatKm (NADPH)Km (DHF)s-1μmWT R67 DHFRaTaken from Ref. 391.3 ± 0.13.0 ± 0.15.8 ± 0.1Quad3 DHFRbTaken from Ref. 100.81 ± 0.024.4 ± 0.46.7 ± 0.4Y69F:1 DHFR0.98 ± 0.066.4 ± 0.621 ± 2Y69F:1+2 DHFR0.96 ± 0.0114 ± 0.820 ± 0.9Y69F:1+3 DHFR0.56 ± 0.013.1 ± 0.420 ± 2Y69F:1+4 DHFR1.9 ± 0.0814 ± 128 ± 2Y69F:1+2+3 DHFR1.4 ± 0.0421 ± 135 ± 2Y69F:1+2+3+4 DHFR1.4 ± 0.0440 ± 354 ± 3Y69F R67 DHFRcRefit from Ref. 9 using the non-linear, global SAS fit described in Ref. 102.9 ± 0.169 ± 368 ± 4Y69L R67 DHFR0.16 ± 0.0168 ± 3180 ± 11Y69H R67 DHFRcRefit from Ref. 9 using the non-linear, global SAS fit described in Ref. 100.014 ± 0.002176 ± 6.046 ± 4.5a Taken from Ref. 39Reece L.J.

Specifically, the Km (DHF) for the single and all double mutants is ∼2- to 3-fold weaker than the Km (DHF) for Quad3. In addition, the Km (DHF) for the Y69F:1+2+3 mutant continues the trend of increasing as additional mutations are added, up to the limit associated with the Y69F:1+2+3+4 mutant. Although binding of both NADPH and DHF in the Michaelis complex is, in general, weakened as the number of Y69F mutations is increased, the kcat value increases over a range of ∼2-fold. A trend is noted where the kcat increases when two Y69F mutations occur at the position that corresponds to one dimer-dimer interface in wt R67 DHFR, as occurs in the Y69F: 1+4 (see Fig. 1D), Y69F:1+2+3, and Y69F:1+2+3+4 mutants, suggesting this topology may be preferred in the transition state. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Although steady-state kinetics provide important insight into interactions between ligands in the Michaelis complex, these Km values do not necessarily correspond to dissociation constants, because other events can contribute to the observed Michaelis constants (21Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1999: 101-105Google Scholar). Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) provides a direct measure of the heat exchange upon ligand binding as well as a direct measure of the Kd for the ligand of interest (22Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar, 23Leavitt S. Freire E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 560-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Thus ITC experiments were performed using binary complex conditions where either two NADPH molecules or two DHF molecules can interact with the enzyme. Data for NADPH binding to the Y69F asymmetric mutants are summarized in Table II. These data were analyzed using both the single sites model and the sequential sites model where the stoichiometry was set to two. The Kd and ΔH values for the first NADPH binding event were similar regardless of the model used to describe the data. However the Kd2 and ΔH2 values generated using the sequential sites model varied, most likely because the Kd2 values are high and fall outside of the detection window afforded by the calorimeter. For accurate results, the c value, where c equals [protein]*Ka, should fall within 1 and 1000 (22Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar, 23Leavitt S. Freire E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 560-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Therefore, only the values for the first NADPH binding event are reported. For some mutants (i.e. Y69F:1+2), low stoichiometries were observed and may reflect the presence of some inactive protein in the reaction solution and/or concentration measurement errors.Table IIComparison of NADPH binding constants for Y69F asymmetric mutants and Y69L R67 DHFR as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry Data reported were fit using the single sites model.

As three to four mutations were added, the Kd values correspondingly increased (up to a 6.5-fold effect). The enthalpy change for NADPH binding to the Y69F:1 and Y69F:1+4 mutants was similar to that for Quad3, whereas the ΔH became less negative as the number of mutations was increased in the Y69F:1+2+3 and Y69F:1+2+3+4 mutants. Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments were also performed to determine the effects of asymmetric Y69F mutations on interactions with DHF. Previously, isotherms generated for DHF binding to wild-type R67 DHFR were fit to an interacting sites model, because isotherms displayed a “hook” reflecting positive cooperativity between two bound DHF molecules (5Bradrick T.D. Beechem J.M. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11414-11424Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). (A stoichiometry of two was previously confirmed by time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy measurements (5Bradrick T.D. Beechem J.M. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11414-11424Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).) New calorimeters have increased sensitivity to minor changes in solution pH during the titration. Close attention to the pH of both the ligand and protein solution indicated that the prominence of the hook is related to changes in pH of the protein solution upon injection of ligand into the solution. Additional studies indicated that the presence of the hook is affected by the ionic strength of the buffering solution (data not shown). The sensitivity of DHF binding to R67 DHFR may also be related to previous NMR studies that found DHF dimerizes in solution and this dimerization is affected by ligand concentration, pH, and ionic strength (24Poe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7025-7032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Khaled M.A. Krumdieck C.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 1273-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Due to the characteristics of the isotherms generated for DHF binding to the Y69F asymmetric mutants, we are unable to consistently fit the data using the Origin software provided by MicroCal. In particular, if there are only a few points in the “hook,” the Origin software does not provide a strong weighting to those points and the fit line excludes them. Therefore, for comparative purposes, we have overlaid the raw data for DHF binding to each of the asymmetric mutants in Fig. 2A. Based on the raw data, a trend is observed in both the shape of the curve and the initial heat released upon ligand binding as well as the prominence of the hook. Specifically, there is a trend in the DHF concentration required to reach saturation for the asymmetric mutants. The signal for Quad3 increases most dramatically as the DHF concentration is increased, whereas the steepness of the slope in the titrations decreases as the number of mutations is increased. This suggests that, as the number of mutations is"

A mutant version of the RT from Saccharomyces cerevisiae retrotransposon Ty1, in which one of the three active site aspartates has been changed to asparagine (D211N), is still capable of in vitro polymerization, although it is blocked for in vivo transposition. We generated recombinant WT and D211N Ty1 RTs to study RT function and determine specific roles for the Asp211 residue. Presteady-state kinetic analysis of the two enzymes shows that the D211N mutation has minimal effect on nucleotide binding but reduces the kpol by ∼230-fold. The mutation reduces binding affinity for both Mn2+ and Mg2+, indicating that the Asp211 side chain helps create a tight metal binding pocket. Although both enzymes are highly processive and tend to remain bound to their initial substrate, each shows distinctive patterns of pausing, attributable to interactions between metal ions and the active site residue. These results provide insights to specific roles for the Asp211 residue during polymerization and indicate unusual enzymatic properties that bear on the Ty1 replication pathway.

These enzymes are essential in multiple biological settings, ranging from retroviral and retrotransposon replication to telomere maintenance. A characteristic feature of the primary amino acid sequences of RTs is the presence of the YXDD motif (1Poch O. Sauvaget I. Delarue M. Tordo N. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3867-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar, 2Doolittle R.F. Feng D.-F. Johnson M.S. McClure M.A. Q. Rev.

The two invariant Asp residues as well as a third Asp that is amino-terminal to this motif are positioned within the active site of the three RTs whose crystal structures have been solved (4Kohlstaedt L.A.

A. 2002; 99: 14410-14415Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). By analogy with other polymerases, which contain either two or three invariant Asp residues, it has been suggested that these residues function to coordinate the two catalytic metal ions involved in the polymerization reaction. Polymerization is a complex process, and the architecture of the active site must properly position incoming dNTPs and the primer 3′-OH, aid in the nucleophilic attack, stabilize the transition state, assist in the removal of the pyrophosphate leaving group, and allow translocation of the primer end by one base. The active site Asp residues may influence all of these processes either directly or indirectly. Among the myriad of RTs, HIV-1 RT has received the lion's share of biochemical and genetic attention. Early mutagenesis studies indicated that substitution of any of the three aspartates led to loss of both infectivity and in vitro polymerase activity (9Larder B.A. Purifoy D.J. Powell K.L. Darby G. Nature. 1987; 327: 716-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 10Le Grice S.F.J. Naas T. Wohlgensinger B. Schatz O. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3905-3911Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Because of the severe biochemical defects associated with these substitutions, the consequences of modifications of these residues have not been extensively studied. Only one report measured steady-state biochemical parameters for mutant HIV RTs in which the first Asp (position 110) was changed to Ala or Ser, the second Asp (position 185) was changed to Ala, Glu, or Asn, and the third Asp (position 186) was changed to Ala, Glu, or Asn (11Kaushik N. Rege N. Yadav P.N. Sarafianos S.G. Modak M.J. Pandey V.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11536-11546Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These changes resulted in a decrease of kcat by ∼1,000–10,000-fold, indicating that these modifications severely crippled but did not entirely eliminate the enzymatic activity of the mutant enzyme. Ty1 is an LTR-containing retrotransposon of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The genetic structure and the mode of replication of this element are, to a first approximation, identical to retroviruses. The main difference is that Ty1 is endogenous and noninfectious. We previously generated Asp to Asn or Asp to Glu mutations for each of the three invariant Asp residues in Ty1 RT. Examining mutant enzymes within Ty1 virus-like particles (VLPs), we found that none were capable of in vitro polymerization except for D211N (equivalent to HIV-1 Asp186), using a standard homopolymer assay (12Uzun O. Gabriel A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6337-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Characterization of VLP contents showed that the D211N mutant could polymerize limited amounts of minus-strand strong stop DNA and strand transfer, but we could not detect plus-strand DNA within mutant VLPs. Genetic tests showed that whereas this mutant was incapable of transposition, second site mutations in the Ty1 RNase H domain could suppress the transposition defect of D211N and restore transposition to ∼5–10% of WT levels. These studies suggested that whereas the aspartate side chain at position 211 was not essential for the singular act of polymerization, it was required for other steps in the replication process (12Uzun O. Gabriel A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6337-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments of a wide range of polymerases as well as comparisons of multiple polymerase crystal structures show that only two of the three active site carboxylates are conserved (13Argos P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9909-9915Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 14Sarafianos S.G. Das K. Ding J. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: R137-R146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A specific role for the third Asp (equivalent to Ty1 Asp211) found in all RTs has not been established. Given that a likely function of the active site carboxylates is coordination of two catalytic metal ions, an understanding of the interactions between the aspartate side chain, the metals, and the other components of the active site is of great interest. The ability of the Ty1 RT D211N mutant to retain polymerase activity, despite substitution of a critical residue, indicates that this altered enzyme can be used to better understand the catalytic function of the active site D residues in RTs. Whereas VLPs are excellent sources of Ty1 intermediates, they are too impure to use for detailed biochemical comparisons of RT, since they contain multiple other activities at stoichiometric amounts. We have therefore purified recombinant forms of WT and D211N RT and compared their pre-steady-state or steady-state parameters associated with a number of steps in polymerization, including nucleotide binding, single base addition, divalent metal ion binding, and dissociation of the enzyme from the template. Since most of these parameters have not previously been studied for the WT enzyme, this allowed us to compare the retrotransposon enzyme to retroviral RTs as well as to look at the specific effects of this novel active site mutation. A previous study comparing a different recombinant form of WT and D211N Ty1 RT concluded that the WT enzyme binds Mg2+ with high affinity but Mn2+ with very low affinity, whereas the mutant enzyme behaves in a reciprocal manner (15Bolton E.C. Mildvan A.S. Boeke J.D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 879-889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). On the contrary, we find that the mutant enzyme has reduced affinity for both catalytic metals and that the two different metals affect polymerization of the two enzymes in idiosyncratic concentration-dependent ways. By single base turnover analysis, we find that the D211N substitution has an effect on the rate of polymerization, indicating a role in the chemistry of polymerization, but that it is not involved in either dNTP binding or dissociation of enzyme from its primer-template. Finally, the D211N mutant results in distinctive changes in the pattern of pausing during polymerization, suggesting a role for this residue in pyrophosphate release and/or translocation. Plasmids and Strains—The plasmid p6H Ty1 IN-RT-RH (construct 2 in Ref. 16Wilhelm M. Boutabout M. Wilhelm F.-X. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) contained WT Ty1 RT-RH plus a 115-amino acid contiguous C-terminal portion of Ty1 integrase fused to the N terminus of the RT-RH domain, all preceded by 6 histidine residues. It was kindly provided by Dr. F. X. Wilhelm (IBMC, Strasbourg) and designated AGE2186 in our laboratory. These extra 115 amino acids are part of a C-terminal extension found in Ty1 integrase, which is far downstream of all potential metal binding domains of Ty1 integrase (17Peterson-Burch B.D. Voytas D.F. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 1832-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The fusion construct was used, because equivalent recombinant proteins beginning at the N terminus of the RT-RH domain totally lack in vitro polymerase activity (16Wilhelm M. Boutabout M. Wilhelm F.-X. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). 2A. Gabriel, unpublished results. We had previously constructed the D211N polymerase active site mutation and expressed it in plasmid pGTy1D211Nmhis3AI (AGE1603) (12Uzun O. Gabriel A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6337-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To make the analogous mutant expression plasmid, constructs AGE1603 and AGE2186 were cut with SphI and AflII, and the 386-bp fragment of the former was ligated to the 5.016-kb fragment of the latter, to generate AGE2352 in strain XL1-Blue. The WT and mutant plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli expression strain M15 containing pREP4 (Qiagen) to generate AGE2193 and AGE2354, respectively. A detailed list of reagents and protocol for expression and purification of recombinant Ty1 RT are included in the Supplemental Material. Note that the only difference between the two enzymes is the presence of Asp or Asn at position 211 and that the two enzymes are expressed at similar levels in E. coli. Primer Extension Assay with DNA Templates—Procedures were modified from those of Patel et al. (18Patel S.S. Wong I. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). In the usual assay, a DNA-DNA primer-template was prepared by annealing a 28-mer plus-strand sequence from the polypurine tract region of Ty1 RT with a complementary 14-mer primer (primer-template ratio is 1:0.85), whose 5′-end is 32P-labeled, to generate the following model substrate.5′−TTACATTATGGGTGGTATGTTGGAATA −3′3′− CCATACAACCTTAT∗−5′MODEL SUBSTRATE 1Detailed descriptions of the primer extension conditions, labeling of oligonucleotides and DNA markers, and denaturing PAGE are in the Supplemental Material. Homopolymer Assay for RT—Routine RT assays during purification were carried out by estimating the dGTP incorporation into poly(rC)/oligo(dG)14–18 using the filter paper binding method (16Wilhelm M. Boutabout M. Wilhelm F.-X. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Determination of Kd and kpol for the Incorporation of dATP—The pre-steady-state kinetic parameters for single correct base incorporation by the WT and the mutant enzymes were measured as reported by Patel et al. (18Patel S.S. Wong I. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Reactions were carried out by rapid quench analysis (19Johnson K.A. Sigman D.S. The Enzymes. 20. Academic Press, Inc., New York1992: 1-61Google Scholar) for WT using a KinTek RQF-3 Rapid Quench Flow apparatus and manually for the mutant. Protein concentrations for both enzymes were determined at A280 in a 1-cm cell in the presence of 8 m urea (extinction coefficient for the 76.861-kDa protein = 86,390/cm·m). Enzymes were used at final concentrations of 228.3 nm (WT) and 92.64 nm (mutant), assuming that the enzyme is a monomer, 3F. X. Wilhelm, unpublished results. which were equivalent to active concentrations of 15.97 nm for WT and 15.66 nm for D211N as determined by 3-min reactions at 200 μm dATP. Analysis was performed using a 5′-32P-end-labeled 14-mer/28-mer substrate, as above, in the presence of varying amounts of the single nucleotide dATP. For WT, solution one (final concentrations of 40 nm primer-template with RT) was prepared in extension buffer (17 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 17 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20% glycerol) and loaded in one of the syringes. Solution two contained extension buffer with the appropriate [dATP] and MgCl2 to a final concentration of 20 mm and was loaded in the other syringe. Reactions were carried out at 22 °C by mixing equal volumes. Samples were taken at various time points and quenched with EDTA, at a final concentration of 35 mm. For D211N mutant Ty1 RT, reactions were carried out manually with similar solutions one and two after 10 min of preincubation of enzyme with substrate at 22 °C. Samples were taken at intervals over 4 min and immediately quenched with the loading buffer (95% formamide, 35 mm EDTA (pH 8), 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol). Products were denatured and resolved in 17% denaturing gels, scanned, and then analyzed. The time course of a single turnover for individual [dATP] was fitted to an exponential equation (Equation 1; see Supplemental Material). The calculated rates were plotted against respective [dATP] to fit this data to a hyperbolic equation (Equation 2; see Supplemental Material). Determination of the Kd of the Divalent Ions—Reactions were carried out in the presence of various concentrations of divalent ions, 0–228 mm Mg2+ (as MgCl2) and 0–49 mm Mn2+ (as MnCl2), in a 10-min extension assay using the 5′-32P-end-labeled 14-mer/28-mer substrate, with 8.0 μm each dNTP and equivalent amounts of active WT or D211N enzymes. Extended samples were resolved on gels and analyzed, as above. The amount of metal ion bound to dNTP at each total metal ion concentration was calculated using a quadratic equation (Equation 3; see Supplemental Material). For this estimate, we used a Kd(Mg·dATP) of 20 μm (20Pecoraro V.L. Hermes J.D. Cleland W.W. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5262-5271Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) and a Kd(Mn·dATP) of 9.77 μm (21Sigel H. Tullius T.D. Metal-DNA Chemistry. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1989: 159-204Google Scholar). The amount of product formed versus the free metal ion concentration was fitted to the Hill equation (Equation 4; see Supplemental Material). Pausing Experiments—We used the same 5′-32P-end-labeled 14-mer/28-mer DNA/DNA substrate (40 nm) for this experiment. All reactions were performed in extension buffer at the specified concentrations of Mg2+ or Mn2+ using WT or D211N enzymes. The reactions were divided into two, without or with an excess of an activated calf thymus DNA trap at 2.63 mg/ml, final concentration. Reactions were initiated by adding all four dNTPs (8.0 μm each) to the prewarmed enzyme and labeled DNA substrate. The reactions were incubated at 22 °C for 10 min. All reactions were stopped with loading buffer, and denatured samples were analyzed by electrophoresis as described. A trap effectiveness control was also carried out where the reaction was initiated by adding dNTPs with Mg2+ or Mn2+ to a mix containing enzyme, trap, and primer-template (where enzyme was added to the labeled substrate in the presence of trap and then prewarmed along with the two). For the DNA/RNA substrate, we used the 5′-labeled 14-mer DNA primer as above and a 28-mer RNA template, whose sequence was equivalent to the above DNA template (5′-AUU ACA UUA UGG GUG GUA UGU UGG AAU A-3′). These reactions were also carried out in the presence and the absence of trap. However, here we used the unlabeled DNA/DNA substrate as a trap at a 200-fold excess to the labeled substrate concentration. Reactions were carried out at 10 or 30 mm Mg2+ or at 2 mm Mn2+. Processivity Assay—Poly(rA) (500–600 nucleotides) or poly(dA) (350–400 nucleotides) primed with 5′-end-labeled oligo(dT)14–28 oligonucleotide (0.0894 ng/μl final concentration) was preincubated with WT or D211N Ty1 RT for 10 min at 22 °C. The extension reactions were initiated by adding a mixture containing 24 μm dTTP along with 10 or 30 mm Mg2+ or 2mm Mn2+ with or without an unlabeled 14-mer/28-mer DNA/DNA substrate trap (at a final concentration of 200-fold more than the labeled primer-template). Reactions were carried out in the extension buffer at 22 °C for 30 min and then terminated with loading buffer. Control reactions were carried out using Klenow polymerase under the same reaction conditions, with 10 mm Mg2+ or 2 mm Mn2+. Trap effectiveness controls were carried out as above. The terminated processivity reaction and control reactions were resolved by 6% polyacrylamide-urea denaturing gel electrophoresis and analyzed as above. Measurement of the Dissociation Rate for the Ty1 RT·DNA Complex— Ty1 RT (18 nm active WT or mutant enzyme) and 40 nm 5′-labeled 14-mer/28-mer were combined in a reaction mixture containing Mg2+ (final concentration, 10 mm) and then preincubated in the extension buffer for 10 min to allow the enzyme·DNA complex to reach equilibrium. A 200-fold excess of unlabeled substrate was then added to the reactions as trap for the dissociated enzyme. At various time points after the addition of the trap (0–180 min), samples were withdrawn and mixed with the next correct nucleotide, present in large excess, to initiate DNA synthesis for 3 min. Control reactions with Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) RT was also conducted using the same substrate but at 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 76 mm NaCl, 10 mm Mg2+, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 20% glycerol, and 20 mm dithiothreitol (38Roth M.J. Tanese N. Goff S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9326-9335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Trap effectiveness reactions were performed by adding the enzyme to the mix of labeled and unlabeled substrates and preincubating for 10 min, and then the reaction was started by adding dATP and Mg2+ for 3 min. For the zero time samples, dATP and Mg2+ were added along with the trap, and the reaction was carried out for 3 min. The reactions were terminated with loading buffer, and the samples were analyzed on denaturing gels. The amounts of the extension products (15-mer and greater) were determined relative to total labeled product (extended and unextended 14-mer). These values were normalized for 0 time, and then the ratio of intensity of extension products/total intensity were plotted against the time in minutes. The obtained curves were fitted to a single exponential equation using a three-parameter fit for the decay (Equation 5; see Supplemental Material). Pre-steady-state Kinetics of dATP Incorporation of WT and Mutant D211N Ty1 RT—Recombinant versions of both WT and D211N mutant Ty1 RT enzymes were purified by nickel affinity chromatography (Fig. 1). Both WT and D211N mutant enzymes were active in a standard homopolymer assay, using [α-32P]dGTP (data not shown), as expected from previous studies (12Uzun O. Gabriel A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6337-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 15Bolton E.C. Mildvan A.S. Boeke J.D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 879-889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The homopolymer assay is, however, extremely crude and not designed to measure subtle differences between enzymes. As a base line for comparing the polymerization properties of the WT and D211N enzymes, we therefore used a model substrate and measured the Kd and kpol for single nucleotide incorporation for the two enzymes, using pre-steady-state kinetics, based on the following minimal scheme for single base addition.E+T⋅Pn←koffE⋅T⋅Pn+dNTP⇌KdE⋅T⋅Pn⋅dNTP→kpolE⋅T⋅P+PPiSCHEME 1To this end, a 5′-end-labeled 14-mer primer was annealed to a 28-mer template and mixed with RT, and synthesis was initiated by the addition of varying concentrations of dATP in the presence of Mg2+, and reactions were quenched at various times. Labeled products were visualized and quantitated (see “Experimental Procedures”). The single exponential equation (Equation 1; see Supplemental Material) fit the kinetics well, as shown by the solid lines in Fig. 2, a and b. The derived exponential rate constants were plotted against their respective dATP concentrations, and the curve was fitted to a hyperbolic equation (Equation 2 in Supplemental Material and Fig. 2, c and d), from which Kd and kpol values were derived. In deriving Kd, we assumed that dNTP is in rapid equilibrium with E·T·Pn (see Scheme 1). Table I shows Kd values of 2.4 ± 0.4 and 1.0 ± 0.4 μm and kpol values of 7.8 ± 0.4 and 0.035 ± 0.002 s–1, respectively, for the WT and mutant D211N enzymes. Since the Kd provides a measure of enzyme affinity for dATP, it appears that the WT and D211N RTs have similar substrate affinity. In contrast, the D211N mutant showed a large defect in the rate of polymerization (223-fold less) relative to WT. The derived catalytic efficiency (i.e. the ratio of kpol and Kd) was ∼100-fold lower for the mutant RT enzyme. These results indicate that the Asp to Asn substitution of the third aspartate in the catalytic triad does not interfere with the binding of the deoxynucleoside triphosphates at the active site. Instead the mutant enzyme carries out the polymerization step at a reduced rate. The replacement of Asp at position 211 by Asn reduces rates of one or more steps of the polymerization reaction by a factor of 223, implying that this residue has a significant role in optimizing the chemistry of polymerization.Table IKinetic parameters of WT Ty1 and D211N mutant Ty1 and MMLV RTsKd(dATP)kpolkpol/KdKd(Mg)Kd(Mn)Hill constant (Mg)Hill constant (Mn)koff(enzyme-substrate)μms-1μm-1·s-1mmmmmin-1WT Ty12.4 ± 0.47.8 ± 0.43.3 ± 1.20.0043 ± 0.00030.0002 ± 0.00011.98 ± 0.282.5 ± 0.530.063 ± 0.006D211N Ty11.0 ± 0.40.035 ± 0.0020.033 ± 0.0050.3916 ± 0.040.0073 ± 0.0031.92 ± 0.362.3 ± 0.180.022 ± 0.003MMLVNAaNA, not analyzed.NANANANANANA∼5.485 ± 1.007a NA, not analyzed. Open table in a new tab Primer Extension Patterns Differ for WT and D211N Mutant RTs on a Model Substrate—We next compared the extension pattern of the two enzymes on the same model 14-mer/28-mer DNA/DNA substrate, in the presence of all four dNTPs. First we examined the pre-steady-state rates of extension for multiple base additions, using saturating concentrations of dNTPs. The results were similar to those obtained with our single base addition studies (data not shown). Next we compared the extension patterns of the two enzymes in the presence of either MgCl2 or MnCl2. The two enzymes generated distinct extension patterns under these conditions (Fig. 3). In the presence of 10 mm Mg2+, the WT enzyme was able to fully extend the primer within 10 min (Fig. 3, lane 5), and further extension consisted of nontemplated base addition beyond the 28-mer length (Fig. 3, lane 7). For the D211N RT, extension was slower (Fig. 3, lanes 6 and 8). In the presence of 100 μm Mn2+, the WT enzyme was also able to extend to the end of the template, but as opposed to the situation with Mg2+, several intermediate bands were seen. This suggests either stalling or dissociation of enzyme from primer-template (Fig. 3, lanes 9 and 11). We refer to this phenomenon as “pausing.” The D211N RT carried out more complete extension in Mn2+ than in the presence of Mg2+ and has distinct pause sites compared with Mg2+ (compare Fig. 3, lanes 8 and 12). Nontemplated base addition was much more apparent in the presence of Mn2+, particularly for the WT enzyme, where up to 4 bases were added beyond the template. D211N Enzyme Has Reduced Binding Affinity for Divalent Ions—To see how the concentration of Mg2+ or Mn2+ affected the extent and pattern of the polymerization reaction, we carried out primer extensions in the presence of a wide range of [Mg2+] or [Mn2+] (Fig. 4). The WT enzyme was capable of full-length extension plus nontemplated extension, without pauses, through a wide range (∼0.080 to ∼200 mm) of [Mg2+] (Fig. 4a). At the highest and lowest [Mg2+], nontemplated base additions were not observed. Full-length extension with the D211N RT occurred over a much narrower range of [Mg2+](∼5 to ∼101 mm, under these conditions), and distinct pausing bands were seen at different divalent metal ion concentrations (Fig. 4b). Extension was only apparent for the mutant enzyme at Mg2+ concentrations above 0.156 mm, ∼200-fold higher than was seen with the WT enzyme. At the lowest and highest [Mg2+], extension did not proceed to the end of the template in the 10-min time span of the reaction. Fig. 4, c and d, shows a very different pattern of primer extension for these two enzymes in the presence of Mn2+ instead of Mg2+. Full-length extension of the WT enzyme is reduced at [Mn2+] > 0.024 mm, and significant levels of full-length extension only accumulated within a narrow range of [Mn2+] (0.006–0.024 mm; Fig. 4c) during the 10-min reaction. Interestingly, the overall proportion of product that is extended in WT reactions does not decrease as a function of higher metal ion concentration. However, at [Mn2+] above 0.048 mm, most products were extended by a single base, and the proportion of full-length products decreased. Further, three distinct pausing patterns were observed at different [Mn2+]. Each of these patterns was distinct from the extension pattern seen in the presence of Mg2+ and differed as well from those seen with the mutant enzyme under the same metal conditions. For the D211N enzyme, full-length extension products are seen only at [Mn2+] ≥ 0.096 mm (Fig. 4d). Distinct from the WT enzyme, no inhibition was observed at high metal ion concentrations. Extension products were first observed at a [Mn2+] ∼30-fold higher than that seen with WT enzyme (0.012 mm Mn2+versus 0.00037 mm Mn2+). To estimate the Kd for metal binding for the WT and D211N RTs, we plotted the overall extension data against the [Mn2+]free, taking into account the metal binding of dNTP. In each case, the data were best fitted to the Hill equation (Equation 3 in Supplemental Material), and Hill constant values of ∼2 were calculated, indicating a positive cooperativity of metal ions (Table I). The D211N enzyme had metal dissociation constant values ∼91- and ∼36-fold greater than the WT enzyme for Mg2+ and Mn2+, respectively, indicating that the N substitution generally reduces metal binding affinity. WT Kd(Mg) was ∼21 times greater than Kd(Mn), and D211N Kd(Mg) was ∼53 times greater than Kd(Mn), indicating that for both enzymes Mn2+ is more efficiently bound than Mg2+. Our findings suggest that the amide side chain in the mutant perturbs the geometry of the metal binding portion of the active site, thus allowing for weaker binding of either metal ion. Stalling on, Versus Dissociation from, the Template—Since both the WT and mutant enzymes showed distinct patterns of intermediate length products under different conditions, we next examined whether these patterns represent a problem of processivity (i.e. the enzyme falls off the primer-template and then has to restart synthesis) or whether they represent"
https://openalex.org/W2059490342,"We have developed a simple yet sensitive dual color fluorescence-based technique for dissecting the tumor-neovascularization relationship and evaluated the susceptibility of each component to therapeutic interventions. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing melanoma cells were cocultured with endothelial cells on different three-dimensional (3-D) matrices and exposed to multiple growth factors and molecules with established anti-angiogenic or anticancer activities. Cells were fixed and stained with propidium iodide, imaged using a confocal microscope, and stereologically analyzed. Three-dimensionality of the system was tested by depth-coding and pseudocolor 3-D reconstruction in the z-axis. Selective ablation of the tumor cells was affected by the anthracycline antibiotic doxorubicin. Treatment with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) promoted the neovascular responses on matrigel and collagen-1 matrices. VEGF-induced angiogenesis was inhibited after treatment with combretastatin and thalidomide. In contrast, HGF exerted a protective effect against these anti-angiogenics in a matrigel matrix. However, this effect was lost when the matrix was substituted with collagen, suggesting that the extracellular matrix impinges on cellular function, possibly through an Akt-mediated mechanism. The VEGF-receptor antagonist PTK787 also selectively ablated the VEGF-induced angiogenic effect without inhibiting the HGF-induced response, demonstrating the sensitivity of the system to detect modulation of distinct signal cascades. The current model encompasses the possibility of studying tumor-angiogenesis-matrix interaction on the same platform, expanding the rapid screening of novel molecules in a simulated clinicopathological setting."
