https://openalex.org/W2143896438,"Diving into Deep Water The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico was one of the largest oil spills on record. Its setting at the bottom of the sea floor posed an unanticipated risk as substantial amounts of hydrocarbons leaked into the deepwater column. Three separate cruises identified and sampled deep underwater hydrocarbon plumes that existed in May and June, 2010—before the well head was ultimately sealed. Camilli et al. (p. 201 ; published online 19 August) used an automated underwater vehicle to assess the dimensions of a stabilized, diffuse underwater plume of oil that was 22 miles long and estimated the daily quantity of oil released from the well, based on the concentration and dimensions of the plume. Hazen et al. (p. 204 ; published online 26 August) also observed an underwater plume at the same depth and found that hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria were enriched in the plume and were breaking down some parts of the oil. Finally, Valentine et al. (p. 208 ; published online 16 September) found that natural gas, including propane and ethane, were also present in hydrocarbon plumes. These gases were broken down quickly by bacteria, but primed the system for biodegradation of larger hydrocarbons, including those comprising the leaking crude oil. Differences were observed in dissolved oxygen levels in the plumes (a proxy for bacterial respiration), which may reflect differences in the location of sampling or the aging of the plumes."

We tested the hypothesis that EPA and DHA may compete with arachidonic acid (AA) for the conversion by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, resulting in the formation of alternative, physiologically active, metabolites. Renal and hepatic microsomes, as well as various CYP isoforms, displayed equal or elevated activities when metabolizing EPA or DHA instead of AA. CYP2C/2J isoforms converting AA to epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) preferentially epoxidized the ω-3 double bond and thereby produced 17,18-epoxyeicosatetraenoic (17,18-EEQ) and 19,20-epoxydocosapentaenoic acid (19,20-EDP) from EPA and DHA. We found that these ω-3 epoxides are highly active as antiarrhythmic agents, suppressing the Ca2+-induced increased rate of spontaneous beating of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, at low nanomolar concentrations. CYP4A/4F isoforms ω-hydroxylating AA were less regioselective toward EPA and DHA, catalyzing predominantly ω- and ω minus 1 hydroxylation. Rats given dietary EPA/DHA supplementation exhibited substantial replacement of AA by EPA and DHA in membrane phospholipids in plasma, heart, kidney, liver, lung, and pancreas, with less pronounced changes in the brain. The changes in fatty acids were accompanied by concomitant changes in endogenous CYP metabolite profiles (e.g. altering the EET/EEQ/EDP ratio from 87:0:13 to 27:18:55 in the heart). These results demonstrate that CYP enzymes efficiently convert EPA and DHA to novel epoxy and hydroxy metabolites that could mediate some of the beneficial cardiovascular effects of dietary ω-3 fatty acids.

In particular, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3), the major n-3 PUFAs contained in fish oil, have anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, vasodilatory, hypolipidemic, and anti-arrhythmic properties and thus exert pleiotropic beneficial effects on cardiovascular function (18Kris-Etherton P.M.

The molecular mechanisms of n-3 PUFA action are only partially understood and include changes in membrane structures and gene expression, direct interactions with ion channels, and alterations in eicosanoid biosynthesis (24Chapkin R.S.

EPA and DHA compete with AA for binding and conversion by cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases and thus modulate the production and bioactivity of prostanoids and leukotrienes (30Schmitz G. Ecker J.

These interactions not only result in a partial replacement of the classical AA-derived eicosanoids by their less potent n-3 counterparts but also produce novel lipid mediators termed “resolvins” and “protectins” that have highly potent anti-inflammatory and pro-resolution properties (29Serhan C.N. Chiang N. Van Dyke T.E. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8: 349-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar). More recently, it became evident from several in vitro studies that n-3 PUFAs may also interfere with the CYP-branch of eicosanoid production (32Lauterbach B. Barbosa-Sicard E. Wang M.H. Honeck H.

The principal CYP-dependent metabolites derived from EPA include five regioisomeric epoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (EEQs) and ω/(ω-1)-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acids (20- and 19-HEPE), whereas DHA can be metabolized to six regioisomeric epoxydocosapentaenoic acids (EDPs) and ω/(ω-1)-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acids (22- and 21-HDoHE); see supplemental Fig. 1 (38Van Rollins M. Frade P.D. Carretero O.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 966: 133-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 39VanRollins M. Lipids. 1990; 25: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Considering the pivotal physiological and pathophysiological roles of the AA-derived EETs and 20-HETE, we hypothesize that their replacement by EPA- and DHA-derived epoxy and hydroxy metabolites may provide a novel mechanism of how dietary n-3 PUFAs influence cardiovascular function. However, to what extent such a replacement can indeed occur under in vivo conditions is unknown and may depend on both the relative availability of AA, EPA, and DHA and the substrate specificity of the individual CYP isoforms expressed in a given tissue. To address these questions, we have now analyzed the substrate specificity of major AA-metabolizing CYP isoforms from humans, rats, and mice; compared renal and hepatic microsomes for their capacity to metabolize AA, EPA, and DHA; and studied for the first time the effect of dietary EPA/DHA supplementation on the endogenous CYP-eicosanoid profile in different organs and tissues of rats. CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C11, CYP2C23, Cyp4a12a, and Cyp4a12b were cloned and co-expressed with the human NADPH-CYP reductase (CPR) in a baculovirus/Sf9 insect cell system, and microsomes containing the recombinant CYP enzymes were prepared as described previously (33Barbosa-Sicard E. Markovic M. Honeck H. Christ B. Muller D.N. Schunck W.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 329: 1275-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 40Muller D.N. Schmidt C. Barbosa-Sicard E.

The CYP concentrations were estimated by means of CO difference spectra using a molar absorption coefficient of 91 mm−1 cm−1 (41Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CPR activities were assayed in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05 mm cytochrome c, 0.1 mm NADPH, and 2.2 mm KCN at 25 °C, using a molar absorption coefficient of 21 mm−1 cm−1 at 550 nm. For calculation of CPR concentration, we assumed that 4.5 units (μmol of cytochrome c/min) correspond to 1 nmol of CPR based on the specific activity of the purified 79-kDa enzyme (60 units/mg). The microsomes used for comparing the rates of AA, EPA, docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), and DHA metabolism contained CYP and CPR in a molar ratio of 1:0.8 (CYP2C8), 1:0.7 (CYP2C9), 1:0.7 (CYP2C11), 1:1.4 (CYP2C23), 1:1.4 (Cyp4a12a), and 1:1.2 (Cyp4a12b). The metabolite pattern produced by each isoform was analyzed with at least three independent microsomal preparations having similar CYP/CPR ratios. CYP2C19, CYP2J2, CYP2E1, CYP4A11, and CYP4F2 were purchased as supersomes from Gentest (BD Biosciences), which contained coexpressed human CPR and in the case of CYP4F2 additionally cytochrome b5. Hepatic and renal microsomes from mice and rats were prepared as described previously (40Muller D.N. Schmidt C. Barbosa-Sicard E. Wellner M. Gross V. Hercule H. Markovic M. Honeck H. Luft F.C.

Standard reactions with the recombinant CYP enzymes were performed in 100 μl of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 10 (CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C11, CYP2C23, CYP2E1, Cyp4a12a, and Cyp4a12b), 5 (CYP2C19), or 2 pmol of CYP (CYP4A11 and CYP4F2) and the respective substrate at a concentration of 10 μm. Before composing the reaction mixtures, Cyp4a12a, Cyp4a12b, and CYP4A11 were supplemented with cytochrome b5 in a 1:1 molar ratio by incubating the corresponding microsomes with highly purified cytochrome b5 (from Calbiochem) in a total volume of 15 μl for 10 min on ice. The recombinant enzymes were preincubated with the substrates for 10 min at 37 °C. Reactions were started with NADPH (final concentration of 1 mm) and terminated after 10 min with all CYP isoforms except CYP2C11 and CYP2C19 (after 5 min) and CYP2E1 (after 15 min) by adding 5 μl of 0.4 m citric acid. Control experiments included (i) omission of NADPH from the reaction mixtures and (ii) use of microsomes obtained after infecting the insect cells with an empty baculovirus. Both types of control reactions did not yield any detectable amounts of products (data not shown). Reaction products were extracted into ethyl acetate, evaporated under nitrogen, and resuspended in ethanol. The enzymatic activities of CYP2J2 were determined under the same conditions, using, however, 50 pmol of CYP, a reaction volume of 200 μl, and the substrates at a concentration of 40 μm. For the analysis of regioselectivities, the standard reactions were scaled up 4–10-fold. The substrate specificity of renal and hepatic microsomes was analyzed under the same conditions, using, however, a reaction time of 20 min and 800 μg of microsomal protein in 100 μl of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) supplemented with 1 mm EDTA and 50 nm FAD/FMN. Extracted reaction samples were first resolved by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC; Shimadzu LC 10 Avp coupled to an online radioflow detector LB 509; Berthold), using a Nucleosil 100-5C18 HD column (250 × 4 mm; Macherey-Nagel) and a linear solvent gradient ranging from acetonitrile/water/acetic acid (50:50:0.1; v/v/v) to acetonitrile/acetic acid (100:0.1) over 40 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. This procedure separated the main product classes (dihydroxy, (ω-1)/ω-hydroxy, and epoxy metabolites (for representative examples, see supplemental Fig. 2). Hydroxylase activities were determined as the sum of the ω- and (ω-1)-hydroxy products formed/min and nmol of recombinant CYP or mg of microsomal protein. Total epoxygenase activities were calculated from the sum of epoxy and corresponding dihydroxy products. The (ω-1)/ω-hydroxy metabolites of AA, EPA, DPA, and DHA eluting with retention times of about 16.1 (19-/20-HETE), 14.2 (19-/20-HEPE), 15.6 (21-/22-OH-DPA), and 14.8 min (21-/22-HDoHE) from RP-HPLC were collected and further resolved by subsequent normal phase (NP)-HPLC essentially as described previously (32Lauterbach B. Barbosa-Sicard E. Wang M.H. Honeck H. Kärgel E. Theuer J. Schwartzman M.L. Haller H. Luft F.C. Gollasch M. Schunck W.H.

NP-HPLC was done on a Nucleosil 100–5 column (250 × 4 mm; from Macherey-Nagel) using a linear gradient ranging from hexane/2-propanol/acetic acid (99:1:0.1, v/v/v) to hexane/2-propanol/acetic acid (98.3:1.7:0.1, v/v/v) over 40 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Under these conditions, the (ω-1)-hydroxy products eluted first and were clearly separated from the ω-hydroxy metabolites: 19-/20-HETE at 20/28 min, 19-/20-HEPE at 19/26 min, 21-OH-/22-OH-DPA at 16/23 min, and 21-/22-DHoHE at 15/21 min (for representative examples, see supplemental Fig. 2). The epoxy metabolites eluted from RP-HPLC as follows: AA-derived EETs, 14,15-EET (23.4 min), 11,12-EET (24.7 min), and 8,9-EET (25.3 min); EPA-derived EEQs, 17,18-EEQ (19.6 min) and other regioisomeric EEQs (21–23 min); DPA-derived epoxydocosatetraenoic acids, 19,20-epoxydocosatetraenoic acid (24.4 min) and other regioisomeric epoxydocosatetraenoic acids (25.6–27.5 min); DHA-derived EDPs, 19,20-EDP (23.0 min) and other regioisomeric EDPs (25.2–27 min). The regioisomeric ω-6 to ω-12 epoxyproducts, which eluted largely unresolved from RP-HPLC, were collected and further resolved by NP-HPLC on a Nucleosil 100-5 column (250 × 4 mm; from Macherey-Nagel) with an isocratic solvent system of hexane/isopropyl alcohol/acetic acid (100:0.3:0.1, v/v/v) over 40 min at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min essentially as described previously (33Barbosa-Sicard E.

Karara A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) (for representative examples, see supplemental Fig. 2). The EPA-derived epoxides eluted in the order 14,15-, 11,12-, and 8,9-EEQ at 14.5, 16.5, and 21.5 min; the DPA-derived epoxides in the order 16,17-, 13,14-, 10,11-, and 7,8-EDQ at 21.7, 23.2, 26.2, and 29.0 min; and the DHA-derived epoxides in the order 16,17-, 13,14-, 10,11-, and 7,8-EDP at 17.4, 19.5, 23.2, and 29.7 min. 5,6-EET, 5,6-EEQ, and 4,5-EDP were not detectable as products of the in vitro reactions, probably because of the intrinsic instability of these metabolites due to lactone formation. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received two types of diet (n = 6/group) starting at an age of 4 weeks. The standard chow (EF R/M; SNIFF Spezialitäten GmbH, Soest, Germany) was supplemented with either 5% (w/w) sunflower oil containing α-linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3n-3) as the only source of n-3 PUFAs (0.03% of total chow corresponding to 0.6% of total fatty acids) or additionally with 2.5% (w/w) OMACOR® oil consisting of pure EPA- and DHA-ethylesters (480 mg of EPA + 360 mg of DHA per ml; Pronova BioPharma (Sandefjord, Norway) and Solvay Arzneimittel GmbH (Hannover, Germany)). For the detailed composition of the diets used, see supplemental Table 1. The animals were allowed free access to the chow and drinking water ad libitum. After 3 weeks of feeding, the animals were sacrificed. Harvested organs, plasma samples, and pelleted and washed red blood cells were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. For further analysis, organs were pulverized in liquid nitrogen using a Biopulverizer (Biospec Products). Fatty acid compositions were analyzed according to the HS-Omega-3 Index® methodology as described previously (44Harris W.S. Von Schacky C. Prev. Med. 2004; 39: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Fatty acid methyl esters were generated by acid transesterification and analyzed by gas chromatography using a GC2010 Gas Chromatograph (Shimadzu, Duisburg, Germany) equipped with a SP2560, 100-m column (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA) using hydrogen as carrier gas. Fatty acids were identified by comparison with a standard mixture of fatty acids characteristic of erythrocytes. The ω-3 index is given as EPA plus DHA expressed as a percentage of total identified fatty acids after response factor correction. The coefficient of variation for EPA plus DHA was 5%. Analyses were quality-controlled according to DIN ISO 15189. 30-mg aliquots of homogenized tissue (or pelleted red blood cells) were mixed with 0.5 ml of distilled water, 0.5 ml of methanol, and 0.1 ml of internal standard containing 10 ng of 20-HETE-d6 and 10 ng of 14,15-EET-d8 in acetonitrile; the deuterated compounds were purchased from Cayman Chemicals and Biomol/Enzo Life Sciences Inc., respectively. The samples were then hydrolyzed after adding 300 μl of 10 m sodium hydroxide for 20 min at 60 °C. The solution was neutralized by adding 300 μl of 60% acetic acid and 2 ml of 1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0. The pH was controlled and if necessary adjusted to pH 6.0 by adding small volumes of either 0.1 m NaOH or 10% acetic acid. The hydrolyzed sample was cleared by centrifugation, and the metabolites were extracted from the supernatant as described below. Essentially the same protocol was used for plasma samples; however, we started with 200 μl of plasma and added only 100 μl of 10 m NaOH for alkaline hydrolysis. Subsequent solid-phase extraction was performed using Varian Bond Elut Certify II columns as described previously (45Rivera J. Ward N. Hodgson J. Puddey I.B. Falck J.R. Croft K.D. Clin. Chem. 2004; 50: 224-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The solid-phase extraction columns were preconditioned with 2 ml of methanol, followed by 2 ml of 0.1 m sodium acetate solution (pH 7) containing 5% methanol before application of the hydrolyzed samples. The columns were washed with 2 ml of methanol/water (1:1, v/v), and the CYP-metabolites and internal standards were eluted with 2 ml of hexane/ethyl acetate (75:25, v/v) containing 1% acetic acid. The eluate was evaporated to dryness on a heating block at 40 °C under a stream of nitrogen. Residues were then dissolved in 50 μl of acetonitrile and applied to LC-MS/MS as described below. 20-μl samples were analyzed with an HPLC system of the Agilent 1200 series equipped with binary pump, autosampler, and column thermostat on a high resolution column (Zorbax Eclipse Plus-C18, 4.6 × 150 mm, 1.8 μm) using acetonitrile, 0.01 m ammonia acetate as the solvent system. Gradient elution was started with 30% acetonitrile. Acetonitrile was increased within 10 min to 90% and held for a further 10 min with a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The HPLC was coupled to the Agilent 6410 Triplequad mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization source. Analysis was performed with multiple reaction monitoring in negative mode, a gas temperature of 350 °C, a nitrogen stream of 12 liters/min, and a capillary voltage of 4000 V. Fragmentor voltage and collision energy were optimized for each individual metabolite using authentic standard compounds. The multiple reaction monitoring and MS conditions are shown in supplemental Table 2. 5,6-EET, 8,9-EET, 11,12-EET, 14,15-EET, 14,15-EEQ, 17,18-EEQ, 16,17-EDP, and 19,20-EDP as well as 20-HETE, EPA, DPA, and DHA were purchased from Cayman Chemicals. Other regioisomeric monoepoxides were synthesized by reacting the parental polyunsaturated fatty acid, supplemented with trace amounts of the corresponding 1-14C-labeled compound, with m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid as described for the chemical oxidation of AA to EETs (46Falck J.R. Yadagiri P. Capdevila J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The reaction products were resolved and purified by RP- and subsequent NP-HPLC as described in detail above. The identity of the regioisomeric monoepoxides was confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) after preparing the corresponding dihydroxy compounds and converting them into the trimethylsilylether-methylester derivatives as described previously (32Lauterbach B.

The GC-MS-electron impact spectra of these derivatives showed the characteristic fragments of α-cleavage products to -OSiMe3 groups at m/z 363, 233, and 131 (17,18-EEQ); 323, 273, and 171 (14,15-EEQ); 313, 283, and 211 (11,12-EEQ); 353, 251, and 243 (8,9-EEQ); 393, 291, and 203 (5,6-EEQ); 131, 233, and 391 (19,20-EDQ); 171, 273, and 351 (16,17-EDQ); 211, 311, and 313 (13,14-EDQ); 251, 271, and 353 (10,11-EDQ); 231, 291, and 393 (7,8-EDQ); 131, 389, and 491 (19,20-EDP); 171, 349, and 451 (16,17-EDP); 211, 309, and 411 (13,14-EDP); 251, 269, and 371 (10,11-EDP); 229, 291, and 331 (7,8-EDP); and 189, 291, and 331 (4,5-EDP). Recombinant Cyp4a12a was used to produce the ω- and (ω-1)-hydroxy derivatives of AA, EPA, and DHA required as standard compounds for NP-HPLC and LC-MS/MS analysis. The standard reaction described above was scaled up to 4 ml, and the specific radioactivity of the substrates was adjusted to 2 mCi/mmol by adding appropriate amounts of the corresponding unlabeled polyunsaturated fatty acid. The reaction products were resolved by RP-HPLC and subsequent NP-HPLC as described above. The identity of the hydroxy metabolites was confirmed by MS based on their collision-induced dissociation spectra. 19- and 20-HETE showed the expected molecular ions at m/z 319, yielded common product ions at m/z 301 (loss of H2O) and 275 (loss of CO2), and characteristic fragments at m/z 231 (combined loss of CO2 and CH3CH2OH from 19-HETE) or 245 (combined loss of CO2 and CH2OH from 20-HETE). 19- and 20-HEPE showed analogous collision-induced dissociation spectra with peaks at m/z 317 (molecular ion), 299 (loss of H2O), and 277 (loss of CO2) and characteristic fragments at m/z 229 (loss of CO2 and CH3CH2OH from 19-HEPE) or 243 (loss of CO2 and CH2OH from 20-HEPE). The collision-induced dissociation spectra of 21- and 22-DHoHE (molecular ions at m/z 343) displayed common fragment ions at m/z 325 (loss of H2O) and 299 (loss of CO2) and characteristic fragments at m/z 255 (loss of CO2 and CH3CH2OH from 21-HDoHE) or 269 (loss of CO2 and CH2OH from 22-HDoHE).

https://openalex.org/W2012616814,"The regulation of synthesis, degradation, and distribution of lipids is crucial for homeostasis of organisms and cells. The sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) transcription factor family is post-translationally activated in situations of reduced lipid abundance and activates numerous genes involved in cholesterol, fatty acid, and phospholipid synthesis. In this study, we provide evidence that the primary transcript of SREBP2 contains an intronic miRNA (miR-33) that reduces cellular cholesterol export via inhibition of translation of the cholesterol export pump ABCA1. Notably, miR-33 also inhibits translation of several transcripts encoding proteins involved in fatty acid β-oxidation including CPT1A, HADHB, and CROT, thereby reducing fatty acid degradation. The genetic locus encoding SREBP2 and miR-33 therefore contains a protein that increases lipid synthesis and a miRNA that prevents export and degradation of newly synthesized lipids. These results add an additional layer of complexity to our understanding of lipid homeostasis and might open possibilities for future therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2050698790,"Maternally-transmitted associations between endosymbiotic bacteria and insects are ubiquitous. While many of these associations are obligate and mutually beneficial, many are facultative, and the mechanism(s) by which these microbes persist in their host lineages remain elusive. Inherited microbes with imperfect transmission are expected to be lost from their host lineages if no other mechanisms increase their persistence (i.e., host reproductive manipulation and/or fitness benefits to host). Indeed numerous facultative heritable endosymbionts are reproductive manipulators. Nevertheless, many do not manipulate reproduction, so they are expected to confer fitness benefits to their hosts, as has been shown in several studies that report defense against natural enemies, tolerance to environmental stress, and increased fecundity.We examined whether larval to adult survival of Drosophila hydei against attack by a common parasitoid wasp (Leptopilina heterotoma), differed between uninfected flies and flies that were artificially infected with Spiroplasma, a heritable endosymbiont of Drosophila hydei that does not appear to manipulate host reproduction. Survival was significantly greater for Spiroplasma-infected flies, and the effect of Spiroplasma infection was most evident during the host's pupal stage. We examined whether or not increased survival of Spiroplasma-infected flies was due to reduced oviposition by the wasp (i.e., pre-oviposition mechanism). The number of wasp eggs per fly larva did not differ significantly between Spiroplasma-free and Spiroplasma-infected fly larvae, suggesting that differential fly survival is due to a post-oviposition mechanism.Our results suggest that Spiroplasma confers protection to D. hydei against wasp parasitism. This is to our knowledge the first report of a potential defensive mutualism in the genus Spiroplasma. Whether it explains the persistence and high abundance of this strain in natural populations of D. hydei, as well as the widespread distribution of heritable Spiroplasma in Drosophila and other arthropods, remains to be investigated."
https://openalex.org/W2084952088,"In response to different environmental stresses, phosphorylation of eIF2 (eIF2∼P) represses global translation coincident with preferential translation of ATF4. ATF4 is a transcriptional activator of the integrated stress response, a program of gene expression involved in metabolism, nutrient uptake, anti-oxidation, and the activation of additional transcription factors, such as CHOP/GADD153, that can induce apoptosis. Although eIF2-P elicits translational control in response to many different stress arrangements, there are selected stresses, such as exposure to UV irradiation, that do not increase ATF4 expression despite robust eIF2∼P. In this study we addressed the underlying mechanism for variable expression of ATF4 in response to eIF2∼P during different stress conditions and the biological significance of omission of enhanced ATF4 function. We show that in addition to translational control, ATF4 expression is subject to transcriptional regulation. Stress conditions such as endoplasmic reticulum stress induce both transcription and translation of ATF4, which together enhance expression of ATF4 and its target genes in response to eIF2∼P. By contrast, UV irradiation represses ATF4 transcription, which diminishes ATF4 mRNA available for translation during eIF2∼P. eIF2∼P enhances cell survival in response to UV irradiation. However, forced expression of ATF4 and its target gene CHOP leads to increased sensitivity to UV irradiation. This combination of transcriptional regulation and translational control allows the eIF2 kinase pathway to selectively repress or activate key regulatory genes subject to preferential translation, providing the integrated stress response versatility to direct the transcriptome that is essential for maintaining the balance between stress remediation and apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W2152746840,"Background When we observe an individual performing a motor act (e.g. grasping a cup) we get two types of information on the basis of how the motor act is done and the context: what the agent is doing (i.e. grasping) and the intention underlying it (i.e. grasping for drinking). Here we examined the temporal dynamics of the brain activations that follow the observation of a motor act and underlie the observer's capacity to understand what the agent is doing and why. Methodology/Principal Findings Volunteers were presented with two-frame video-clips. The first frame (T0) showed an object with or without context; the second frame (T1) showed a hand interacting with the object. The volunteers were instructed to understand the intention of the observed actions while their brain activity was recorded with a high-density 128-channel EEG system. Visual event-related potentials (VEPs) were recorded time-locked with the frame showing the hand-object interaction (T1). The data were analyzed by using electrical neuroimaging, which combines a cluster analysis performed on the group-averaged VEPs with the localization of the cortical sources that give rise to different spatio-temporal states of the global electrical field. Electrical neuroimaging results revealed four major steps: 1) bilateral posterior cortical activations; 2) a strong activation of the left posterior temporal and inferior parietal cortices with almost a complete disappearance of activations in the right hemisphere; 3) a significant increase of the activations of the right temporo-parietal region with simultaneously co-active left hemispheric sources, and 4) a significant global decrease of cortical activity accompanied by the appearance of activation of the orbito-frontal cortex. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that the early striking left hemisphere involvement is due to the activation of a lateralized action-observation/action execution network. The activation of this lateralized network mediates the understanding of the goal of object-directed motor acts (mirror mechanism). The successive right hemisphere activation indicates that this hemisphere plays an important role in understanding the intention of others."
https://openalex.org/W2014705718,"Vascular endothelial cell (VEC) permeability is largely dependent on the integrity of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin or VE-Cad)-based intercellular adhesions. Activators of protein kinase A (PKA) or of exchange protein activated by cAMP (EPAC) reduce VEC permeability largely by stabilizing VE-Cad-based intercellular adhesions. Currently, little is known concerning the nature and composition of the signaling complexes that allow PKA or EPAC to regulate VE-Cad-based structures and through these actions control permeability. Using pharmacological, biochemical, and cell biological approaches we identified and determined the composition and functionality of a signaling complex that coordinates cAMP-mediated control of VE-Cad-based adhesions and VEC permeability. Thus, we report that PKA, EPAC1, and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) enzymes integrate into VE-Cad-based signaling complexes in human arterial endothelial cells. Importantly, we show that protein-protein interactions between EPAC1 and PDE4D serve to foster their integration into VE-Cad-based complexes and allow robust local regulation of EPAC1-based stabilization of VE-Cad-based adhesions. Of potential translational importance, we mapped the EPAC1 peptide motif involved in binding PDE4D and show that a cell-permeable variant of this peptide antagonizes EPAC1-PDE4D binding and directly alters VEC permeability. Collectively, our data indicate that PDE4D regulates both the activity and subcellular localization of EPAC1 and identify a novel mechanism for regulated EPAC1 signaling in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1583797852,"Reversible ubiquitination of activated receptor complexes signals their sorting between recycling and degradation and thereby dictates receptor fate. The deubiquitinating enzyme ubiquitin-specific protease 8 (USP8/UBPy) has been previously implicated in the regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR); however, the molecular mechanisms governing its recruitment and activity in this context remain unclear. Herein, we investigate the role of USP8 in countering ligand-induced ubiquitination and down-regulation of EGFR and characterize a subset of protein-protein interaction determinants critical for this function. USP8 depletion accelerates receptor turnover, whereas loss of hepatocyte growth factor-regulated substrate (Hrs) rescues this phenotype, indicating that USP8 protects EGFR from degradation via an Hrs-dependent pathway. Catalytic inactivation of USP8 incurs EGFR hyperubiquitination and promotes receptor localization to endosomes marked by high ubiquitin content. These phenotypes require the central region of USP8, containing three extended Arg-X-X-Lys (RXXK) motifs that specify direct low affinity interactions with the SH3 domain(s) of ESCRT-0 proteins, STAM1/2. The USP8·STAM complex critically impinges on receptor ubiquitination status and modulates ubiquitin dynamics on EGFR-positive endosomes. Consequently, USP8-mediated deubiquitination slows progression of EGFR past the early-to-recycling endosome circuit in a manner dependent upon the RXXK motifs. Collectively, these findings demonstrate a role for the USP8·STAM complex as a protective mechanism regulating early endosomal sorting of EGFR between pathways destined for lysosomal degradation and recycling.

https://openalex.org/W1977793339,"In eukaryotic organisms, hydrogen peroxide has a dual effect; it is potentially toxic for the cell but also has an important signaling activity. According to the previously proposed floodgate hypothesis, the signaling activity of hydrogen peroxide in eukaryotes requires a transient increase in its concentration, which is due to the inactivation by overoxidation of 2-Cys peroxiredoxin (2-Cys Prx). Sensitivity to overoxidation depends on the structural GGLG and YF motifs present in eukaryotic 2-Cys Prxs and is believed to be absent from prokaryotic enzymes, thus representing a paradoxical gain of function exclusive to eukaryotic organisms. Here we show that 2-Cys Prxs from several prokaryotic organisms, including cyanobacteria, contain the GG(L/V/I)G and YF motifs characteristic of sensitive enzymes. In search of the existence of overoxidation-sensitive 2-Cys Prxs in prokaryotes, we have analyzed the sensitivity to overoxidation of 2-Cys Prxs from two cyanobacterial strains, Anabaena sp. PCC7120 and Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. In vitro analysis of wild type and mutant variants of the Anabaena 2-Cys Prx showed that this enzyme is overoxidized at the peroxidatic cysteine residue, thus constituting an exception among prokaryotes. Moreover, the 2-Cys Prx from Anabaena is readily and reversibly overoxidized in vivo in response to high light and hydrogen peroxide, showing higher sensitivity to overoxidation than the Synechocystis enzyme. These cyanobacterial strains have different strategies to cope with hydrogen peroxide. While Synechocystis has low content of less sensitive 2-Cys Prx and high catalase activity, Anabaena contains abundant and sensitive 2-Cys Prx, but low catalase activity, which is remarkably similar to the chloroplast system."
https://openalex.org/W1984878600,"We have previously shown that the hyperthermophilic archaeon, Sulfolobus solfataricus, catabolizes d-glucose and d-galactose to pyruvate and glyceraldehyde via a non-phosphorylative version of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. At each step, one enzyme is active with both C6 epimers, leading to a metabolically promiscuous pathway. On further investigation, the catalytic promiscuity of the first enzyme in this pathway, glucose dehydrogenase, has been shown to extend to the C5 sugars, D-xylose and L-arabinose. In the current paper we establish that this promiscuity for C6 and C5 metabolites is also exhibited by the third enzyme in the pathway, 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate aldolase, but that the second step requires a specific C5-dehydratase, the gluconate dehydratase being active only with C6 metabolites. The products of this pathway for the catabolism of D-xylose and L-arabinose are pyruvate and glycolaldehyde, pyruvate entering the citric acid cycle after oxidative decarboxylation to acetyl-coenzyme A. We have identified and characterized the enzymes, both native and recombinant, that catalyze the conversion of glycolaldehyde to glycolate and then to glyoxylate, which can enter the citric acid cycle via the action of malate synthase. Evidence is also presented that similar enzymes for this pentose sugar pathway are present in Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, and metabolic tracer studies in this archaeon demonstrate its in vivo operation in parallel with a route involving no aldol cleavage of the 2-keto-3-deoxy-pentanoates but direct conversion to the citric acid cycle C5-metabolite, 2-oxoglutarate."
https://openalex.org/W2135376655,"The Caenorhabditis elegans mitochondrial (Mit) mutants have disrupted mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) functionality, yet, surprisingly, they are long lived. We have previously proposed that Mit mutants supplement their energy needs by exploiting alternate energy production pathways normally used by wild-type animals only when exposed to hypoxic conditions. We have also proposed that longevity in the Mit mutants arises as a property of their new metabolic state. If longevity does arise as a function of metabolic state, we would expect to find a common metabolic signature among these animals. To test these predictions, we established a novel approach monitoring the C. elegans exometabolism as a surrogate marker for internal metabolic events. Using HPLC-ultraviolet-based metabolomics and multivariate analyses, we show that long-lived clk-1(qm30) and isp-1(qm150) Mit mutants have a common metabolic profile that is distinct from that of aerobically cultured wild-type animals and, unexpectedly, wild-type animals cultured under severe oxygen deprivation. Moreover, we show that 2 short-lived mitochondrial ETC mutants, mev-1(kn1) and ucr-2.3(pk732), also share a common metabolic signature that is unique. We show that removal of soluble fumarate reductase unexpectedly increases health span in several genetically defined Mit mutants, identifying at least 1 alternate energy production pathway, malate dismutation, that is operative in these animals. Our study suggests long-lived, genetically specified Mit mutants employ a novel metabolism and that life span may well arise as a function of metabolic state."
https://openalex.org/W1976640184,"Transducer of Cdc42-dependent actin assembly (Toca-1) consists of an F-BAR domain, a Cdc42 binding site and an SH3 domain. Toca-1 interacts with N-WASP, an activator of actin nucleation that binds Cdc42. Cdc42 may play an important role in regulating Toca-1 and N-WASP functions. We report here that the cellular expression of Toca-1 and N-WASP induces membrane tubulation and the formation of motile vesicles. Marker and uptake analysis suggests that the tubules and vesicles are associated with clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) analysis shows that Cdc42, N-WASP and Toca-1 form a trimer complex on the membrane tubules and vesicles and that Cdc42 interaction with N-WASP is critical for complex formation. Modulation of Cdc42 interaction with Toca-1 and/or N-WASP affects membrane tubulation, vesicle formation and vesicle motility. Thus Cdc42 may influence endocytic membrane trafficking by regulating the formation and activity of the Toca-1/N-WASP complex."
https://openalex.org/W2146300801,"It remains unclear how α-ketoisocaproate (KIC) and leucine are metabolized to stimulate insulin secretion. Mitochondrial BCATm (branched-chain aminotransferase) catalyzes reversible transamination of leucine and α-ketoglutarate to KIC and glutamate, the first step of leucine catabolism. We investigated the biochemical mechanisms of KIC and leucine-stimulated insulin secretion (KICSIS and LSIS, respectively) using BCATm(-/-) mice. In static incubation, BCATm disruption abolished insulin secretion by KIC, D,L-α-keto-β-methylvalerate, and α-ketocaproate without altering stimulation by glucose, leucine, or α-ketoglutarate. Similarly, during pancreas perfusions in BCATm(-/-) mice, glucose and arginine stimulated insulin release, whereas KICSIS was largely abolished. During islet perifusions, KIC and 2 mM glutamine caused robust dose-dependent insulin secretion in BCATm(+/+) not BCATm(-/-) islets, whereas LSIS was unaffected. Consistently, in contrast to BCATm(+/+) islets, the increases of the ATP concentration and NADPH/NADP(+) ratio in response to KIC were largely blunted in BCATm(-/-) islets. Compared with nontreated islets, the combination of KIC/glutamine (10/2 mM) did not influence α-ketoglutarate concentrations but caused 120 and 33% increases in malate in BCATm(+/+) and BCATm(-/-) islets, respectively. Although leucine oxidation and KIC transamination were blocked in BCATm(-/-) islets, KIC oxidation was unaltered. These data indicate that KICSIS requires transamination of KIC and glutamate to leucine and α-ketoglutarate, respectively. LSIS does not require leucine catabolism and may be through leucine activation of glutamate dehydrogenase. Thus, KICSIS and LSIS occur by enhancing the metabolism of glutamine/glutamate to α-ketoglutarate, which, in turn, is metabolized to produce the intracellular signals such as ATP and NADPH for insulin secretion."

CNV was induced by laser photocoagulation in C57BL/6 mice using an argon laser, and the animals received rCD59-APT542 via intravitreal (ivt) route. Western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry, and total complement hemolytic assay demonstrated that exogenously administered rCD59-APT542 was incorporated as well as retained in RPE and choroid and was functionally active in vivo. Single ivt injection during the growth of the CNV (i.e. at day 3 post-laser) resulted in ∼79% inhibition of the further growth of neovascular complex. The size of the CNV complex was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced by the administration of rCD59-APT542 after the CNV complex has fully developed (i.e. at day 7 post-laser). Treatment with rCD59-APT542 blocked the formation of membrane attack complex (MAC), increased apoptosis and decreased cell proliferation in the neovascular complex. On the basis of results presented here we conclude that recombinant membrane targeted CD59 inhibited the growth of the CNV complex and reduced the size of fully developed CNV in the laser-induced mouse model.

AMD, a complex disease with multiple risk factors (2Evans J.R. Prog. Retinal. Eye Res. 2001; 20: 227-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), is usually classified into two forms, namely “dry” and “wet” type (3Fine S.L. Berger J.W. Maguire M.G. Ho A.C. N. Engl. J.

Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is the defining characteristic of wet AMD, and is responsible for the sudden and disabling loss of central vision. Laser-induced mouse model of CNV in which Bruch's membrane (BM) is disrupted by laser photocoagulation is well established and is used by an increasing number of investigators (4Campochiaro P.A. J.

We demonstrated that membrane attack complex (MAC) formation via the alternative pathway activation is important for the release of angiogenic growth factors that are critical for the induction of CNV in mouse model (9Bora N.S.

Using the mouse model of laser-induced CNV we further reported that recombinant soluble (rs) CD59a-Fc controls the induction of CNV (10Bora N.S. Kaliappan S. Jha P. Xu Q. Sivasankar B. Harris C.L. Morgan B.P. Bora P.S. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). CD59 is a complement regulatory protein (CReg) that controls the formation and function of MAC. In mouse, the CD59 gene is duplicated, and two genes termed CD59a and CD59b show differential tissue distribution (12Baalasubramanian S. Harris C.L. Donev R.M. Mizuno M. Omidvar N. Song W.C.

Morgan B.P. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 3684-3692Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Interestingly, administration of rsCD59a-Fc inhibited the development of the CNV complex in the mouse model by blocking MAC formation and inhibiting the expression of angiogenic growth factors (10Bora N.S. Kaliappan S. Jha P. Xu Q. Sivasankar B. Harris C.L. Morgan B.P. Bora P.S. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Our initial results demonstrated that the growth of the CNV complex or the size of fully developed neovascular complex was not affected by treatment with rsCD59a-Fc. This may be due to the fact that although rsCD59a-Fc is an efficient complement inhibitor, its bioavailability and limited local retention at the site of interest limit its capacity to efficiently inhibit MAC formation as a result of increased complement activation during the growth of CNV. One way of improving local protein retention is by adding a membrane-targeting moiety (14Fraser D.A. Harris C.L. Smith R.A. Morgan B.P. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2512-2521Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 15Fraser D.A. Harris C.L. Williams A.S. Mizuno M. Gallagher S. Smith R.A. Morgan B.P. J. Biol.

CD59 containing a membrane targeting moiety (APT542) has been reported to bind firmly to the cell surface and is 100-fold more effective in inhibiting complement activation and MAC deposition than the untargeted protein (15Fraser D.A.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate if the growth of the CNV complex as well as the size of fully developed CNV can be inhibited by recombinant membrane targeted CD59 (rCD59-APT542) and compare its in vivo effectiveness to rsCD59a-Fc. Recombinant membrane targeted CD59 (rCD59-APT542) was prepared as previously described by coupling the soluble rat CD59 through its C terminus to a short, synthetic address tag termed APT542 (15Fraser D.A.

This protein inhibits the complement system of both rat and mouse (15Fraser D.A. Harris C.L. Williams A.S. Mizuno M. Gallagher S. Smith R.A. Morgan B.P. J. Biol.

In the current study we also explored the underlying mechanisms of rCD59-APT542 mediated inhibition of CNV. Male C57BL/6 mice (6–8 weeks old) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). This study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR. Recombinant membrane targeted CD59 (rCD59-APT542) was prepared as previously described (15Fraser D.A. Harris C.L. Williams A.S. Mizuno M. Gallagher S. Smith R.A. Morgan B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48921-48927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Naïve C57BL/6 mice were divided into two groups. Animals in group 1 received a single intravitreal (ivt) injection (25 μg in 2 μl) of rat rCD59-APT542 while the animals in group 2 received a similar treatment with sterile PBS. Animals in both the groups were sacrificed at day 5 (n = 3 mice) post-injection and RPE-choroid harvested from these animals were pooled separately. The tissue was homogenized, solubilized in PBS, and the protein samples were used in the “Complement Hemolytic Assay” and Western blot analysis described below. Because protease inhibitors and Nonidet P-40 interfere with “Complement Hemolytic Assay”, they were not added to the PBS used to solublize RPE and choroid used in “Complement Hemolytic Assay.” For Western blot analysis RPE-choroid tissue was homogenized in PBS containing 1% protease inhibitors and 1% Nonidet P-40. The experiment was repeated three times. Protein samples (25 μl) extracted from RPE-choroid harvested from CD59-APT542 or PBS injected mice were incubated in vitro with 50 μl of normal human serum (NHS) at 37 °C for 30 min as previously described (17Sohn J.H. Kaplan H.J. Suk H.J. Bora P.S. Bora N.S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 4195-4202PubMed Google Scholar). Different dilutions of this mixture were assayed for the inhibition of complement-dependent serum hemolytic activity as described before (7Bora P.S. Sohn J.H. Cruz J.M. Jha P. Nishihori H. Wang Y.

Normal human serum (NHS) not treated with protein samples but treated in vitro with the same volume of PBS was used as the positive control, and serum hemolytic activity of this sample was taken as 100%. After SDS-PAGE on 12% linear slab gel, separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. Blots were blocked in 5% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against amino acids 1–123 representing full-length CD59a of mouse origin (1:500; FL-123, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or monoclonal anti-β actin (1:10,000; mouse IgG1; Sigma-Aldrich) overnight at 4 °C. Control blots were treated with the same dilution of appropriate IgG isotype control. After washing and incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary Ab (1:5000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), blots were developed using the ECL Western blot analysis detection system (ECL Plus; Amersham Biosciences). CNV was induced by laser photocoagulation in C57BL/6 mice with an argon laser (50-μm spot size, 0.05 s duration, 260 milliwatt) as previously described by us (7Bora P.S. Sohn J.H. Cruz J.M. Jha P.

Immunol. 2006; 177: 1872-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Three laser spots were placed in each eye close to the optic nerve. In our initial experiments three different doses (12.5 μg in 2 μl of PBS, 25 μg in 2 μl of PBS, and 50 μg in 2 μl of PBS) of rat rCD59-APT542 were used for intravitreal injections. Intravitreal (25 μg) gave the best results and was used in subsequent experiments. CD59a coupled to mouse IgG Fc (rsCD59aFc) was prepared as previously described (13Harris C.L. Hanna S.M. Mizuno M. Holt D.S. Marchbank K.J. Morgan B.P. Immunology. 2003; 109: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In these experiments 75 μg of rsCD59a-Fc in 2 μl of PBS was injected via ivt route and this dose of rsCD59a-Fc was selected on the basis of our experience with this protein. Animals were divided into six groups (n = 5 mice/group). Animals received a single ivt injection of rCD59-APT542 (group 1) or rsCD59a-Fc (group 2) on day 3 post-laser. Control animals (group 3) received similar treatments with sterile PBS. Animals in group 1, 2, and 3 were sacrificed at day 7 post-laser treatment. In another set of experiments C57BL/6 mice received a single ivt injection of rCD59-APT542 (group 4) or rsCD59a-Fc (group 5) on day 7 after laser. Mice in group 6 received a single ivt injection of PBS at day 7 post-laser. Animals in group 4, 5, and 6 were sacrificed at day 9 post-laser. Experiments were repeated three times. Mice were anesthetized (ketamine/xylazine) and perfused through the heart with 1 ml PBS containing 50 mg/ml fluorescein labeled dextran (FITC-dextran, 2 million average molecular weight, Sigma). The eyes were removed and fixed for 1 h in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin. The cornea and the lens were removed and the neurosensory retina was carefully dissected from the eyecup. Five radial cuts were made from the edge of the eyecup to the equator and RPE-choroid-sclera tissue was stained with a mAb against elastin (Sigma) and a Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma). RPE-choroid-sclera tissue was flat-mounted, with the sclera facing down, on a glass slide in Aqua mount. Flat mounts were examined under a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM510). The CNV stained green whereas the elastin stained red. The percentage of FITC-dextran perfused vessels in laser injured zones was measured with ImagePro Plus software (Media Cybernetics, Inc. Bethesda, MD). In preliminary experiments, the capacity of a human SC5b-9 EIA kit (Quidel Corp.) to detect mouse SC5b-9/MAC was tested by comparing values obtained with normal human serum (unactivated or zymosan activated) and normal mouse serum (unactivated or zymosan activated). RPE-choroid tissue harvested from six mice was homogenized in 500 μl of lysis buffer (PBS with 1% of Nonidet P-40 and 1% of protease inhibitor) on ice. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and MAC levels in the supernatant were detected using human SC5b-9 Plus EIA kit and normalized to total protein concentration. ELISA was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The concentration of MAC was calculated by computer software using the standard curves obtained from known concentrations (EIA kit). Mice injected ivt with CD59-APT542 or PBS at day 3 post-laser (n = 5 mice/group) were sacrificed at day 7 post-laser. Another set of mice (n = 5 mice/group) received a single ivt injection of CD59-APT542 at day 7 and were sacrificed at day 9 post-laser. Eyes were harvested, fixed in 10% formalin solution (Sigma-Aldrich) and embedded in paraffin. The paraffin-embedded tissue sections (4 μm) were immunostained for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated d-UTP-FITC nick end labeling (TUNEL), MAC and proliferating-cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). TUNEL staining was performed using the kit purchased from Roche (Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For MAC detection, polyclonal rabbit anti-rat/mouse C9 (1:1000) was used as the primary antibody. PCNA was detected using goat polyclonal anti-PCNA antibody (1:500; Biovision, Mountain View, CA). AlexaFluor 594 conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) was used as the secondary antibody for MAC staining. AlexaFluor 594 conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (Invitrogen) was used as the secondary antibody for detecting PCNA. Mouse monoclonal anti-rat CD59 (6D1, mouse IgG1; 1:100) and M.O.M. Immunodetection kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) were used to localize rat CD59-APT542 in mouse RPE and choroid. Control stains were performed with non-relevant antibodies of the same Ig subclass at concentrations similar to those of the primary antibodies. Additional controls consisted of staining by omission of the primary or secondary antibody. After staining with the secondary antibody, the sections were covered with mounting medium (ProLong Gold Mounting Medium; Invitrogen). The slides were examined under a ZEISS LSM 510 confocal microscope. TUNEL- and PCNA-stained sections from each laser injured area were captured and a total of 30 laser spots sections per group were investigated. TUNEL- and PCNA-positive cells in laser injured area were counted in a masked fashion. For MAC staining images of red fluorescence in each laser-injured area were captured with Q Imaging GO-5 digital camera and confocal microscope. The intensity of red fluorescence was analyzed using ImageJ 1.40g (NIH), and the intensity was measured as integrated density using the software. The data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Data were analyzed and compared using Student's ttest, and differences were considered statistically significant with p < 0.05. To establish that exogenously administered membrane targeted form of recombinant rat CD59 (rCD59-APT542) was incorporated in RPE and choroid; naïve C57BL/6 mice received a single ivt injection of rCD59-APT-542. Animals were sacrificed on day 5 post-injection (n = 3 mice) and RPE and choroid tissue was used in Western blot analysis. Rabbit polyclonal anti-CD59 (FL-123) was used in Western blot analysis to distinguish endogenous murine CD59 from exogenously administered recombinant rat CD59 (rCD59-APT542). Western blot analysis demonstrated the presence of constitutively expressed murine CD59a (∼19 kDa) in RPE-choroid harvested from both PBS and rCD59-APT-542 treated animals (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2). Exogenously administered rat rCD59-APT542 (∼11 kDa) was detected in RPE-choroid harvested from mice injected with rCD59-APT542 on day 5 (Fig. 1A, lane 2) post-injection. In contrast, the 11 kDa band representing rat rCD59-APT542 was not present in the RPE-choroid from the PBS injected mice (Fig. 1A, lane 1). A strong band of equal intensity at 43 kDa for β-actin in lanes 1 and 2 indicated equal amount of total protein in both lanes (Fig. 1A). Purified rat rCD59-APT542 was used as the positive control and was loaded in lane 3 (Fig. 1A). Complement hemolytic assay was utilized to determine that rCD59-APT542 incorporated in RPE and choroid is functionally active. Naïve C57BL/6 mice received a single ivt injection of rCD59-APT542 or PBS and were sacrificed on day 5 post-injection (n = 3 mice). RPE and choroid were harvested and normal human serum (NHS) was treated separately with protein extracted from RPE-choroid harvested from these mice. NHS not treated with protein samples but treated in vitro with the same volume of PBS was used as the positive control and serum hemolytic activity of this sample was taken as 100% (Fig. 1B). As shown in Fig. 1B, protein samples prepared from RPE-choroid inhibited the complement-mediated lysis of sensitized SRBCs by NHS. Treatment of NHS with protein sample prepared from RPE-choroid of PBS injected mice resulted in ∼25% inhibition of the total hemolytic activity of NHS. This complement inhibitory activity is due both to nonspecific protein effects and to various complement regulatory proteins expressed constitutively on the RPE and choroid of PBS injected mice. Similar treatment of NHS with the RPE-choroid protein samples harvested from rCD59-APT542 injected mice decreased the total hemolytic activity of NHS by ∼ 45% (Fig. 1B). This additional (25–27%) inhibition of hemolytic activity by protein samples from rCD59-APT542 treated mice represents the complement inhibitory activity of exogenously administered rCD59-APT542 protein. Exogenously administered rCD59-APT542 contributes to the increased inhibition of total hemolytic complement activity observed in protein samples prepared from the eyes of rCD59-APT542-injected mice. Collectively, our results demonstrated that ivt-injected rat rCD59-APT542 reached the RPE and choroid, was locally retained and functionally active.

In the current study, rCD59-APT542 and rsCD59a-Fc were injected separately on day 3 or day 7 post-laser to investigate the effect of these agents on the growth of the CNV complex and on the size of the fully developed CNV complex, respectively. We studied the effect of local (ivt) injection of rCD59-APT542 and rsCD59a-Fc on the growth of the CNV complex using mouse model of laser-induced CNV. A single dose of rCD59-APT542 (25 μg) or rsCD59a-Fc (75 μg) was delivered via ivt route during the growth of the CNV complex (i.e. at day 3 post-laser), and the animals were sacrificed at day 7 after laser treatment. Control animals received a similar treatment with sterile PBS. Confocal analysis of RPE-choroid-sclera flat mounts demonstrated that the further growth of neovascular complex was significantly (∼79%, p < 0.05) inhibited by a single ivt injection of rCD59-APT542 in all C57BL/6 mice (Fig. 2, B and D). Similar administration of 75 μg of rsCD59a-Fc (Fig. 2, C and D) or sterile PBS (Fig. 2, A and D) did not affect the growth of the CNV complex. We next investigated if the administration of rCD59-APT542 or rsCD59a-Fc in the animals with fully developed CNV affects the size of neovascular complex. In this model, the CNV complex fully develops by day 7 post-laser (7Bora P.S. Sohn J.H. Cruz J.M. Jha P. Nishihori H. Wang Y. Kaliappan S. Kaplan H.J. Bora N.S. J.

C57BL/6 mice received a single ivt injection (25 μg) of rCD59-APT542 or rsCD59a-Fc (75 μg) at day 7 and were sacrificed at day 9 after laser treatment. Our results demonstrate that treatment with rCD59-APT542 resulted in significantly (p < 0.05) decreased (∼44%) size of the CNV complex (Fig. 3, B and D) in all mice compared with rsCD59a-Fc (Fig. 3, C and D) and PBS-injected animals (Fig. 3, A and D). Taken together our above mentioned results demonstrated that administration of rCD59-APT542 during the growth phase of laser-induced CNV or after the CNV complex is fully developed inhibited neovascular complex in C57BL/6 mice. In contrast, the growth of the CNV complex or the size of fully developed neovascular complex was not affected by treatment with rsCD59a-Fc. rCD59-APT542 and PBS were injected separately in C57BL/6 mice via ivt route at day 7 post-laser. Animals were sacrificed at day 9 after laser treatment and localization of rat rCD59-APT542 was performed by immunohistochemistry using monoclonal anti-rat CD59 antibody (6D1). This antibody recognizes rat CD59 only and does not cross-react with endogenous murine CD59. In mice injected with rCD59-APT542, RPE and choroid stained strongly for exogenously administered rat protein in the area of no laser injury (Fig. 4A) as well as in the laser-injured area (Fig. 4B). However, no staining for rCD59-APT542 was detected in PBS-injected mice (Fig. 4C). Control sections stained without the primary antibody showed no staining (Fig. 4D). Similar results were obtained in animals injected ivt with rat rCD59-APT542 at day 3 and sacrificed at day 7 post-laser treatment (data not shown). Collectively, our results demonstrated that intravitreally administered rCD59-APT542 localized to RPE and choroid of laser-treated C57BL/6 mice. We also explored the underlying mechanism responsible for above mentioned effects of rCD59-APT542 during the growth of CNV as well as on the fully developed CNV complex. We investigated the apoptosis of cells in the neovascular complex by TUNEL assay whereas the proliferation of cells in the neovascular complex was examined by staining for cell proliferation marker, PCNA. MAC deposition was determined using immunohistochemistry or a human SC5b-9 EIA kit. Capacity of human SC5b-9 EIA kit to detect mouse SC5b-9 was proven by showing that, while normal mouse serum gave no signal in the assay, after zymosan activation mouse serum was strongly positive in the assay (values ∼12-fold lower than in zymosan-activated human serum). Laser-treated C57BL/6 mice were divided into two groups (n = 5 mice/group). Mice in group 1 received a single intravitreal injection of rCD59-APT542 on day 3 post-laser and mice in group 2 (control) received a similar treatment with PBS. Animals in both groups 1 and 2 were sacrificed on day 7 post-laser. TUNEL+ fluorescent cells were barely detectable in laser-injured area of PBS-treated mice (Fig. 5B). In contrast, several TUNEL+ fluorescent cells were detected in the laser-injured area of rCD59-APT542-injected mice (Fig. 5A). These differences were statistically (p < 0.05) significant (Fig. 5C). The effect of rCD59-APT542 treatment on the proliferation of cells in the CNV complex was investigated by immunofluorescent staining of paraffin sections for the cell proliferation marker, PCNA. Fewer cells stained for PCNA in the laser spot of the mice that were injected with rCD59-APT542 (Fig. 5D) compared with PBS-treated control mice (Fig. 5E), and these differences were statistically (p < 0.05) significant (Fig. 5F). Our results revealed significantly (Fig. 5I; p < 0.05) reduced MAC deposition at day 7 post-laser in the laser-injured area of the mice that received rCD59-APT542 injection at day 3 post-laser (Fig. 5, G and I) compared with PBS-treated control mice (Fig. 5, H and I). Animals were divided into two groups (n = 5 mice/group). Animals in group 1 received single intravitreal injection of rCD59-APT542 on day 7 post-laser and sacrificed on day 9 post-laser. Mice in group 2 received PBS on day 7 and were sacrificed on day 9. Few TUNEL+ fluorescent cells were detected in the laser spots of PBS-treated mice sacrificed on day 9 (Fig. 6B). However, the administration of rCD59-APT542 at day 7 resulted in a significant (Fig. 6C; p < 0.05) increase in the number of TUNEL+ fluorescent cells in the laser spots at day 9 (Fig. 6, A and C). Next we investigated the effect of rCD59-APT542 treatment on cell proliferation in laser injured area. As shown in Fig. 6, few cells stained for PCNA in the laser-injured area, and no statistically significant (Fig. 6F; p > 0.05) difference in the number of PCNA-positive cells was observed between rCD59-APT542 (Fig. 6, D and F)-treated mice and PBS-treated mice (Fig. 6, E and F) on day 9 post-laser. At day 9, post-laser levels of MAC were almost undetectable in both rCD59-APT542- and PBS-treated mice using immunohistochemistry (Fig. 7, A and B). Because we were unable to detect any difference in MAC levels visually between PBS- and rCD59-APT542-injected mice at day 9 post-laser using immunohistochemistry, we used ELISA to see if we can detect any difference in the levels of MAC between the two groups at this time point. Our results presented in Fig. 7C demonstrated that administration of rCD59-APT542 resulted in significantly (p < 0.05) lower levels of MAC in RPE and choroid of rCD59-APT542-treated mice compared with PBS-treated mice on day 9 post-laser.FIGURE 7Effect of rCD59-APT542 administration on MAC after the CNV complex is fully developed.

Angiogenic neovascular changes in the choroid (CNV) are the hallmark of wet AMD and cause of sudden loss of vision in people over the age of 55. We have previously reported that administration of recombinant soluble (rs) CD59a-Fc before laser treatment inhibited the development of CNV by blocking the formation of MAC and inhibiting angiogenic growth factors (10Bora N.S.

In the present study, we used CD59-APT542 to inhibit the growth of CNV and compared its effectiveness to rsCD59a-Fc. CD59-APT542 is a recombinant protein generated by fusing a short, synthetic address tag (APT542) to rat recombinant CD59 (15Fraser D.A. Harris C.L. Williams A.S. Mizuno M. Gallagher S. Smith R.A.

Recombinant CD59-APT 542 has been reported to be an efficient and specific in vivo inhibitor of MAC activity in both rat and mouse (15Fraser D.A. Harris C.L. Williams A.S. Mizuno M. Gallagher S.

Our results from the present investigation demonstrated that rCD59-APT542 injected via intravitreal route was able to reach RPE and choroid of the naïve mouse eye and this recombinant protein was retained locally for at least 5 days. Furthermore, rCD59-APT542 incorporated and/or retained in RPE and choroid of naïve eye was functionally active. Importantly, our results demonstrated that intravitreally administered rCD59-APT542 localized to RPE and choroid of laser treated mice as well. We have shown in this study that local administration of rCD59-APT542 during the growth phase of neovascular complex significantly inhibited the further growth of the CNV complex. In addition, rCD59-APT542 significantly reduced the size of a fully developed neovascular complex, raising the possibility that such a treatment might be effective in established disease. In contrast, there was no effect on CNV when rsCD59a-Fc was administered during the growth of the CNV complex or when the CNV complex is fully developed. It has previously been reported that a single intraarticular administration of rCD59-APT542 markedly reduced the disease severity in a murine model of rheumatoid arthritis, and was more effective than soluble rCD59 again implying retention at the site of injection (15Fraser D.A.

The inhibitory effect of rCD59-APT542 on CNV observed in our study can be attributed to reduced levels of MAC. MAC has been implicated as a stimulus to cell proliferation in both in vitro and in vivo studies and sublytic levels of MAC have been directly implicated in stimulating cell proliferation under pathological conditions (22Cole D.S.

Administration of rCD59-APT542 during the growth of the CNV complex observed in our study resulted in reduced MAC formation that leads to reduced cell proliferation. Interestingly, after CNV is fully developed we did not observe any difference in the number of proliferating cells in the CNV complex of rCD59-APT542- and PBS-treated mice by staining for PCNA. This may be due to the fact that in the mouse model of laser-induced CNV, at day 7 post-laser most of the cells in the CNV complex are mature and proliferate at a very low rate (18Lyzogubov V.V.

In addition to the effect of MAC on cell proliferation, reduction of CNV size by rCD59-APT542 reported in the current study may involve MAC-mediated apoptosis. MAC at low levels has been reported to play a role in modulating apoptosis (22Cole D.S. Morgan B.P. Clin. Sci. 2003; 104: 455-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 27Nauta A.J. Daha M.R.

We observed an increase in the number of cells undergoing apoptosis in the CNV complex of mice treated with rCD59-APT542 compared with control animals during the growth of CNV. Also, the number of cells undergoing apoptosis increased while the levels of MAC decreased in mice injected with rCD59-APT542 after the CNV complex is fully developed compared with control mice. In conclusion, we report two novel findings in this manuscript. First, recombinant membrane-targeted CD59 inhibited the growth of the CNV complex as well as the size of fully developed CNV lesions in the laser-induced mouse model. Second, our results suggest that a combination of two mechanisms: 1) decreased cell proliferation; 2) increase in the number of cells undergoing apoptosis, both resulting from low levels of MAC caused by rCD59-APT542 lead to inhibition of CNV. Additionally, this may also be in part due to decreased levels of growth factors. We have previously reported that blockade of MAC formation by complement depletion (7Bora P.S. Sohn J.H. Cruz J.M. Jha P. Nishihori H. Wang Y. Kaliappan S. Kaplan H.J. Bora N.S. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), inhibition of the alternative pathway (9Bora N.S.

Immunol. 2007; 178: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) inhibited angiogenic growth factors in C57BL/6 mice with laser-induced CNV. The inhibition of CNV during the growth and after the CNV complex is fully developed as observed in our current study is of great clinical relevance because the experiments described here mimic frequent clinical presentation in humans. On the basis of the results presented here we believe that membrane targeted recombinant CD59 may have potential to treat human AMD. Recombinant membrane targeted CD59 may be a better therapeutic agent in humans than strategies targeting C3 or C5 because CD59 inhibits the complement system at the terminal step without affecting upstream events that play crucial roles in host defense.

https://openalex.org/W2012228543,"The Paf1 complex (Paf1C) affects RNA polymerase II transcription by coordinating co-transcriptional chromatin modifications and helping recruit mRNA 3' end processing factors. Paf1C cross-links to transcribed genes, but not downstream of the cleavage and polyadenylation site, suggesting that it may interact with the nascent mRNA. Paf1C purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae binds RNA in vitro, as do the purified Leo1 and Rtf1 subunits of the complex. In vivo cross-linking and immunoprecipitation of RNA associated with Paf1C (RNA-IP) show that Leo1, but not Rtf1, is necessary for the complex to bind RNA. Cells lacking Leo1 have reduced Paf1C recruitment as well as decreased levels of histone H3 and trimethylated H3 Lys(4) within transcribed chromatin. Together, these results suggest that association of Paf1C with RNA stabilizes its localization at actively transcribed regions where it influences chromatin structure."
https://openalex.org/W1545487618,"The formation of a β-catenin·TCF4 complex in the nucleus of cells is well known as a prerequisite for the transcription of Wnt target genes. Although many co-factors have been identified to regulate the activity of the β-catenin·TCF4 complex, it remains unclear how the complex association is negatively regulated. In this study, we report that p15RS, a negative regulator of the cell cycle, blocks β-catenin·TCF4 complex formation and inhibits Wnt signaling. We observed that p15RS interacts with β-catenin and TCF4. Interestingly, whereas the interaction of p15RS with β-catenin is increased, its interaction with TCF4 is decreased upon Wnt1 stimulation. Moreover, overexpression of p15RS reduces the interaction of β-catenin with TCF4, whereas the depletion of p15RS enhances their interaction. We further demonstrate that overexpression of p15RS suppresses canonical Wnt signaling and results in retarded cell growth, whereas depletion of p15RS shows an enhanced effect on Wnt signaling. We analyzed that inhibition of Wnt signaling by p15RS leads to decreased expression of CYCLIN D1 and c-MYC, two Wnt targeted genes critical for cell growth. Our data suggest that p15RS inhibits Wnt signaling by interrupting β-catenin·TCF4 complex formation and that Wnt signaling initiates downstream gene expression by removing p15RS from promoters."

Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is a hereditary human cancer stem cell syndrome currently linked to deregulated imprinting at chromosome 11p15 and uniparental disomy.

Yet, the role of the β2SP in human tumor syndromes remains unclear. Here, we report that β2SP+/− mice are born with many phenotypic characteristics observed in BWS patients, suggesting that β2SP mutant mice phenocopy BWS, and β2SP loss could be one of the mechanisms associated with BWS.

BWS is associated with an 800-fold increased risk of embryonal neoplasms of childhood and to a lesser extent, hepatocellular carcinoma and renal cell carcinomas. 85% of BWS cases are sporadic, whereas 15% are familial and exhibit an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with linkage to chromosome 11p15 (9Lapunzina P.

Furthermore, germ line mutations (homozygous frameshift) of NLRP2 (a member of the Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, Leucine-rich Repeat and Pyrin domain family) are also associated with BWS (15Meyer E. Lim D. Pasha S. Tee L.J. Rahman F. Yates J.R. Woods C.G. Reik W. Maher E.R. PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000423Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In addition, the transcriptional insulator CCCTC-binding factor, a highly conserved zinc finger protein, has been implicated in BWS and has diverse regulatory functions, including transcriptional activation/repression, insulation, imprinting, and X chromosome inactivation (16Phillips J.E. Corces V.G. Cell. 2009; 137: 1194-1211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar, 17Ling J.Q. Li T. Hu J.F. Vu T.H. Chen H.L. Qiu X.W. Cherry A.M. Hoffman A.R.

CCCTC-binding factor interacts with itself or chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 8, forming “active chromatin hubs” mediating long range chromatin interactions between multiple loci such as the IGF2/H19 gene locus which is associated with BWS (8Weksberg R.

Despite these advances in the field, no clear mouse model with cancer development has emerged for BWS to date. The non-pleckstrin homology (PH) domain β-spectrin (β2SP) (official name for human is Spectrin, beta, nonerythrocytic 1 (SPTBN1), isoform 2; official name for mouse is Spectrin beta 2 (Spnb2), isoform 2; also known as embryonic liver fodrin isoform; human gene ID, 6711; mouse gene ID, 20742/OMIM ID 182790), a TGF-β/Smad3/4 adaptor protein, is a potent suppressor of tumorigenesis, but the role of the β2SP in human gastrointestinal tumor syndromes remains unclear (2Mishra L.

In the present study, we report a serendipitous observation that β2SP+/− mice are born with many phenotypic characteristics observed in BWS patients. These include dramatic visceromegaly, macroglossia, abnormal ear folds, midface dysmorphology, followed in later months by the development of multiple cancers, including carcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract (liver, stomach, intestine, and pancreas), as well as renal and adrenal adenocarcinomas. Therefore, epigenetic regulation of β2SP expression in human BWS, and the β2SP+/− mouse phenotype could offer valuable models for further genetic studies of this disease, as well as sporadic cancers associated with this stem cell disorder. Seven BWS tissues from BWS patients were diagnosed based upon three major criteria (8Weksberg R. Shuman C. Smith A.C. Am. J. Med. Genet. C Semin. Med. Genet. 2005; 137C: 12-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 1). Seven human BWS cell lines were developed by Dr. Weksberg (Ontario, Canada) with institutional review board and research ethics approval. Cells were cultured in MEM-α with 10% FBS. The cell lines were named for the molecular abnormality identified (UPD, KvDMR-loss of methylation in KCNQ1OT1 region or CDKN1C-mutation; Plus (“+”) shows molecular defect, and minus (“−”) shows absence of defect). In addition, cell lines were given a tumor (T) designation if the patient had a tumor or a “no tumor” (NT) designation if no tumor has been detected. Cell lines used in this study were: CDKN1C+NT (referred to as BWSC-1); KvDMR-NT (referred to as BWSC-2); KvDMR+T, hepatoblastoma (referred as BWSC-3); UPD+NT (referred to as BWSC-4); UPD+T, hepatoblastoma (referred to as BWSC-5); two tongue tissue (UPD+) cell lines derived from the same case with biopsies at separate sites (8369F referred to as BWSC-6 and 8370F referred to as BWSC-7). BWSC-2 and BWSC-3 were derived from normal monozygotic twin (absence of KvDMR molecular defect but it had some clinical signs of BWS) and BWS monozygotic twin with KvDMR molecular defect, respectively. Normal human hepatocytes were from the Liver Tissue Cell Distribution System, University of Pittsburgh and University of Minnesota. The cDNA sequence of β2SP was amplified by gene-specific primers and inserted into pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen) for transfection studies. Rabbit anti-β2SP-N is an epitope-specific antibody recognizing the β2SP N terminus (36 amino acids). The mouse growth hormone (GH) ELISA kit was from Millipore. Genomic DNA was bisulfite-modified with an EpiTect Bisulfite kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Prediction of CpG islands in the β2SP promoter and primer design for methylation-specific PCR used urogene software. DNA methylation analysis was by a web tool from RIKEN. Primer pairs (Pms-1) used for BWS cell lines and BWS nontumor tissues methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing were methylated forward, 5′-CGG TGT TTT TAT AAA TTT TTT TTG CGT C-3′ and reverse, 5′-AAT TCC ATT ATA CCC GAC GTA ACG C-3′; and unmethylated forward, 5′-TTG GTG TTT TTA TAA ATT TTT TTT GTG TTG A-3′ and reverse, 5′-CAA TTC CAT TAT ACC CAA CAT AAC ACC C-3′. Primer Pairs (Pms-2) used for formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded BWS tumor tissues were methylated forward, 5′-TAG TTT TGT TTG GGA AGG TAT TAT C-3′ and reverse, 5′-TAT AAT TTT ATC AAA AAC CAC TCG C −3′ and unmethylated forward, 5′-GTA GTT TTG TTT GGG AAG GTA TTA TTG-3′ and reverse, 5′-TTA TAA TTT TAT CAA AAA CCA CTC ACC-3′. A total of 29 β2SP+/− mice were generated from β2SP+/− mice intercrossed with β2SP+/− mice. Genotypes were determined by Southern blotting or PCR. All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, D. C. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and unpaired Student's t test using the INSTAT 3.00 package (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Mice with homozygous deletion of β2SP (β2SP−/−) die during midgestation (21Tang Y. Katuri V. Dillner A. Mishra B. Deng C.X. Mishra L. Science. 2003; 299: 574-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Analysis of 29 β2SP+/− heterozygous mice revealed a 25% increase (35.65 ± 5.72g versus 44.55 ± 8.30g; p < 0.01) in the average body size and mass compared with wild type mice. β2SP+/− heterozygous mice liver increased 23% (1.32 ± 0.19g versus 1.62 ± 0.29, p < 0.1). This was accompanied by macroglossia, hyperplasia, multiple ear folds, frontal balding, increased incidence of sudden death in the male mutant mice, visceromegaly with multilobed livers, cardiomegaly, renal hypertrophy, and testicular enlargement (Fig. 1). The phenotypic resemblance between the β2SP+/− heterozygote mice and BWS patients is considerable (Table 1). In BWS, postnatal gigantism (height more than 2 S.D. above normal) is observed in 45% of cases. Macroglossia occurs in 92% of patients with BWS. Comparing β2SP+/− heterozygote mice with other BWS mice models, Table 1 indicates that those mice (IGF2R−/−, IGF-II overexpression, p57−/−, and GPC3−/−) overlap with many of the clinical features of BWS, but a prominent BWS feature, tumor formation, was absent.TABLE 1Comparison of mouse phenotypes with human Beckwith-Wiedemann syndromeManifestationBWSβ2SP+/−IGF2R−/−IGF-II overexpressionp57−/−GPC3−/−Overgrowth++++−+Increased circulating IGF-IINDND+−ND−Perinatal death+/−+/−++++Kidney dysplasia+/−+/−−−++Thymoma+/−+−−−−Breast adenomas+/−+−−−+Adrenocortical carcinomas++−−−−Renal cell carcinomas+/−+−−−−Optic nerve gliomas+/−+−−−−Hepatocellular carcinomas+/−+−−−−Thyroid carcinomas+/−+−−−−Pancreatic carcinomas++−−−−Adrenal cysts++/−−−−−Lymphomas+/−+−−−−a ND, not studied. Open table in a new tab a ND, not studied. Abnormalities including those of the ear are present in greater than 50% of BWS cases. Visceromegaly due to cellular hyperplasia of livers, kidneys, and pancreas occurs in a majority of cases and is sometimes accompanied by cardiomegaly (Fig. 1K). Interestingly, hyperplasia of three or more organs is associated with an increased risk of tumors (9Lapunzina P. Am. J. Med. Genet. C Semin. Med. Genet. 2005; 137C: 53-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 22Enklaar T. Zabel B.U. Prawitt D. Expert Rev. Mol. Med. 2006; 8: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Examination of heterozygous β2SP+/− mice revealed a 37.9% (Table 2) to 40% (23Kitisin K. Ganesan N. Tang Y. Jogunoori W. Volpe E.A. Kim S.S. Katuri V. Kallakury B. Pishvaian M. Albanese C.

New findings, in addition to the large size, macroglossia, and multiple ear folds, include adrenal, pancreatic, kidney, ovarian, and other tumors, not previously described (Table 2). These studies suggest that loss of β2SP in the whole animal leads to multiple tumors. Because β2SP has been earlier shown to be important for the maintenance of TGF-β signaling (21Tang Y. Katuri V. Dillner A. Mishra B. Deng C.X. Mishra L. Science. 2003; 299: 574-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), these results suggest either a universal role for this tumor suppressor pathway at key regulatory steps or in a specific cell subtype such as a stem or progenitor cell (2Mishra L. Derynck R. Mishra B. Science. 2005; 310: 68-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 3Tang Y. Kitisin K. Jogunoori W. Li C. Deng C.X. Mueller S.C. Ressom H.W. Rashid A. He A.R. Mendelson J.S.

We proceeded to analyze the role of β2SP as well as other molecules implicated in BWS: IGF2, IGF2R, and p57Kip2 from seven human BWS tissues and seven BWS cell lines. These human BWS cell lines displayed a significant decrease (p < 0.001) in β2SP mRNA with a 64–98% reduction compared with normal hepatocytes (Fig. 2A). Immunohistochemical labeling results revealed loss of β2SP expression in BWS kidney tumor compared with normal kidney (Fig. 2B). Western blot analysis of human BWS cell lines (BWSC) (Fig. 2C) and human BWS nontumor tissues (BWST) (Fig. 2D) shows complete loss of β2SP protein expression in tumor tissues compared with normal human liver and β2SP positive control (HepG2 cells), except for one, UPD+T, hepatoblastoma cells (BWSC-5), where β2SP protein expression is decreased. Our results indicated that a loss (or decrease) of β2SP expression occurs in nearly all BWS patients' tissues or cell lines examined, no matter what type molecular defects, even in unexplained cases of BWS, such as KvDMR-NT (BWSC-2) cell line, which is derived from a normal monozygotic twin (absence of KvDMR molecular defect, but it had some clinical signs of BWS) and a BWS monozygotic twin with KvDMR molecular defect (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. 1). DNA methylation patterns are often altered significantly in cancer cells including those from BWS patients. Growing evidence suggests that aberrant DNA methylation of CpG islands around promoter regions can have the same effect as coding region mutations, leading to the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes (24Jones P.A. Baylin S.B. Cell. 2007; 128: 683-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3648) Google Scholar). Because the promoter region of β2SP contains four typical CpG islands (Fig. 3A), we examined their methylation state in genomic DNA isolated from eight cell lines (seven BWS cell lines and the β2SP-positive HepG2 cell line), seven human BWS tissues, and normal human liver tissue utilizing methylation-specific PCR (Fig. 3B) and bisulfite sequencing (Fig. 3C). These results showed a positive correlation between low levels or lack of β2SP expression and methylation in the vicinity of the β2SP promoter in human BWS cells (Fig. 2). In six human BWS cell lines we observed either loss or markedly decreased expression of β2SP (CDKN1c, KvDMR−, KvDMR+, UPD− Tongue-1(UPD) and Tongue-2(UPD)), cytosine residues of CpG dinucleotide in the β2SP promoter region (−1100 to −386) and 5′ UTR (−385 to −1) were almost completely methylated, whereas those cytosine residues in two cell lines (HepG2 and UPD+) and normal human liver, which express normal levels of β2SP, were entirely methylation-free (Fig. 3C). Thus, our results confirmed hypermethylation in this region of the β2SP promoter. To confirm epigenetic silencing of β2SP in individuals with BWS further, we analyzed BWS primary tissues (including nontumor tissues ranging from tongue to placenta with and without loss of imprinting at the IGF2 locus) and observed that loss of β2SP occurs irrespective of IGF2 loss of imprinting in all seven of the tissues examined (Fig. 3, B and C). Moreover, we also determined the methylation state of β2SP at the promoter region (−627 to −510) in genomic DNA isolated from seven formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded BWS tumor tissues utilizing methylation-specific PCR (Fig. 3DI) and bisulfite sequencing (Fig. 3DII). The data demonstrate a comprehensive profile of β2SP silencing at its promoter by DNA methylation in human BWS cell lines, nontumor as well as tumor tissues. 5′-aza-2′-Deoxycytidine (5′-aza-dC), an inhibitor of DNA methylation, can reactivate gene expression when hypermethylation of CpG islands is the cause of reduced gene expression (25Cameron E.E. Bachman K.E. Myöhänen S. Herman J.G. Baylin S.B. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). To demonstrate regulation of β2SP expression by DNA methylation, three BWS cell lines (two β2SP-negative and one β2SP-positive) were treated with 5′-aza-dC for 6 days. As shown in Fig. 4A, 2.5 μm 5′-aza-dC reactivated β2SP expression in two β2SP-negative BWS cell lines. To confirm this result, we determined DNA methylation levels in β2SP-negative BWS cell line (BWS-3) with 5 μm 5′-aza-dC for 6 days. Results demonstrate significantly decreased methylation levels in both β2SP alleles compared with untreated cells (Fig. 4B). These studies further support the hypothesis that loss of β2SP is a causal event of human BWS. Increased IGF2 leading to BWS has been reported (8Weksberg R. Shuman C. Smith A.C. Am. J. Med. Genet. C Semin. Med. Genet. 2005; 137C: 12-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). We performed broad microarray and proteomic analyses on β2SP+/− liver tissues to determine alterations in pathways involved in BWS (supplemental Fig. 2). Microarray profiles of β2SP+/− liver tissues indicated a marked increase IGF2 expression with minor increased IGF2R or p57Kip2 levels (supplemental Fig. 2). Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed elevated expression of IGF2 in β2SP+/− liver and pancreatic tissues (Fig. 5AI). In contrast, IGF2 receptor is not activated in β2SP+/− pancreatic tissues, except for β2SP+/− liver tissue where a minor increase was noted (Fig. 5AII). p57Kip2 expression levels were slightly increased in β2SP+/− (Fig. 5B, I and II) tissues. However, KCNQ1 expression appears to be increased in β2SP+/− cardiac tissue (Fig. 5B, III and IV). We next investigated whether increased IGF2 levels in BWS cells could be secondary to loss of repression by β2SP. To determine this, β2SP was ectopically expressed in β2SP-negative BWS cell lines, and levels of IGF2 mRNA were determined. These studies revealed markedly reduced IGF2 mRNA levels (Fig. 5C) in β2SP-transfected BWS cells (a >5-fold reduction). These results indicate that β2SP is required for suppression of IGF2 signaling. Considering that GH and IGF1 may alter in β2SP+/− mice and may be involved in overgrowth, we measured β2SP+/− the mouse serum GH protein level by ELISA (Fig. 5D) and IGF1 mRNA level by RT-PCR (Fig. 5EI). Results show that the levels of GH and IGF1 were not changed in β2SP+/− mice compared with wild type mice. We also measured the mRNA level in BWS patients' liver by RT-PCR (Fig. 5EII). Results indicated that there are no alterations between normal and BWS, which is consistent with the observation from β2SP+/− mice. These results suggest that loss of β2SP does not affect the GH and IGF1 axis. BWS is considered to be linked to a cluster of imprinted genes at human chromosome 11p15.5, including increased IGF2, loss of H19, loss of p57Kip2, and loss of KCNQ1. The human syndrome is characterized by somatic overgrowth, macroglossia, abdominal wall defects, visceromegaly, and an increased susceptibility to a spectrum of tumors that include childhood tumors (26Miles H.L.

Yet to date, none of the mouse models develops the full panoply of symptoms and signs of BWS, particularly tumor formation (33Li M. Squire J.A. Weksberg R. Clin. Genet. 1998; 53: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For instance, mutant mice with loss of KCNQ1 develop deafness, abnormalities in inner ear development, mucous neck cell hyperplasia resulting in a 3-fold increase in stomach weight, but no features of BWS, suggesting that KCNQ1 is not responsible for BWS (34Lee M.P. Ravenel J.D. Hu R.J. Lustig L.R. Tomaselli G. Berger R.D. Brandenburg S.A. Litzi T.J. Bunton T.E. Limb C. Francis H. Gorelikow M. Gu H. Washington K. Argani P. Goldenring J.R Coffey R.J.

Mice with a maternally inherited deletion of H19 bear a 27% increase in birth weight, and paternal inheritance of the disruption has no effect (35Leighton P.A. Ingram R.S. Eggenschwiler J. Efstratiadis A. Tilghman S.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Deletion of the maternally inherited IGF2R (a maternally expressed imprinted gene in mouse but not man, partially functioning as a scavenger for IGF2, mediating its degradation) allele in mice results in increased free IGF2 available for growth factor signaling through the IGF1 receptor, with a 40% increase in birth weight, cardiac defects, and perinatal lethality (36Lau M.M. Stewart C.E. Liu Z. Bhatt H. Rotwein P. Stewart C.L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2953-2963Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). H19 and IGF2R double heterozygote mice overexpress 7- and 11-fold greater tissue and serum levels of IGF2 and develop a 2-fold increase in birth weight, embryonic lethality, omphalocele, visceromegaly, adrenal cysts, and cleft palate (37Ludwig T. Eggenschwiler J. Fisher P. D'Ercole A.J. Davenport M.L. Efstratiadis A. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 517-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Similar to H19 and IGF2R double heterozygote mice, IGF2-overexpression transgenic chimeric mice made with transgenic ES cells also leads to development of most of the BWS phenotypes, including prenatal overgrowth, polyhydramnios, fetal and neonatal lethality, disproportionate organ overgrowth such as tongue enlargement and skeletal abnormalities (13Sun F.L. Dean W.L. Kelsey G. Allen N.D. Reik W. Nature. 1997; 389: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Mice with loss-of-function mutations in p57KIP2 (a maternally expressed gene encoding a G1 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor) and loss of Igf2 imprinting develop placentomegaly, multitissue dysplasia, kidney dysplasia, macroglossia, cleft palate, omphalocele, and polydactyly, but not tumors (39Yan Y.

Targeted deletions of the murine homolog of glypican-3 gene (GPC3) encoding an extracellular proteoglycan believed to interact with IGF2 and/or other growth factors during development result in several features common to BWS and Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome, namely overgrowth and cystic kidneys (42Pilia G.

Filmus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7574-7577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Although the data above clearly support the role for IGF2 as the effector for overgrowth, none of the genes appears to be the sole effector for BWS, particularly tumor formation, suggesting that other key proteins remain to be sought. Our surprising findings indicate that the β2SP mutant mice phenocopy BWS by both a genetic and biochemical basis. Although genetic and biochemical data support the proposed β2SP protein function in human BWS, the situation in vivo is undoubtedly far more complex. Various types of imprinted gene abnormalities on the short arm of chromosome 11 are involved in the etiology of BWS, particularly in the IGF2 gene region (11p15.5). Our data point to an additional or perhaps related mechanism for deregulation of IGF2 involving β2SP. The resemblance of this mouse model to human BWS is substantial but not perfect. The tumors in human BWS are mostly of embryonal cell types, including nephroblastoma, hepatoblastoma, and pancreatoblastoma, whereas those in the mouse model are largely carcinomas or other “adult” type neoplasms. Neonatal hypoglycemia is observed in 13% of cases and has not been observed in the mutant mice. These distinctions may at least in part reflect species differences, or they may reflect the difficulties in discerning between embryonal and adult tumors in rodents, such as hepatoblastomas and hepatocellular carcinomas, and in part from the surprising discovery of the syndrome through tumors in surviving older mice in our colony. Importantly, we report for the first time and provide strong evidence that β2SP is epigenetically silenced in individuals with BWS by examining affected nontumor tissues as well as cell lines. In addition, we observe silencing of β2SP in tissues from affected BWS patients where no loss of imprinting at the IGF2 locus is seen, further supporting the theory that loss of β2SP is one of the causal factors leading to the syndrome. Thus, mutations of β2SP in cancers could lead to new diagnostic, prognostic insights, and new therapeutic strategies into difficult to manage subsets of colorectal and hepatocellular cancers (19Tang Y. Katuri V. Srinivasan R. Fogt F. Redman R. Anand G. Said A. Fishbein T. Zasloff M. Reddy E.P. Mishra B. Mishra L. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 4228-4237Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 20Lin L.

Furthermore, the unexpectedly high frequency of BWS in in vitro fertilization offspring is intriguing and highlights a previously undescribed role of the TGF-β pathway and new insight into epigenetic regulation of stem cells at crucial stages of differentiation and growth (11Halliday J.

It is possible that in BWS, as in sporadic hepatocellular cancer, derangement in TGF-β signaling in progenitor cells contributes to malignant transformation and eventual cancer development (2Mishra L.

Future studies on genomic imprinting as an epigenetic mechanism controlling parental-origin-specific gene expression, and its perturbations should yield new therapeutics for cancers. Indeed insights into consequences of epigenotype switches at birth, and in BWS from β2SP as a non-pleckstrin homology domain β-spectrin and its scaffolding function may be of profound significance.

The mechanisms of IFNβ-induced inhibition of arteriogenesis are unknown. In stimulated monocytes from patients with chronic total coronary artery occlusion and decreased arteriogenic response, whole genome expression analysis showed increased expression of IFNβ-regulated genes. Immunohistochemically, the IFNβ receptor was localized in the vascular media of murine collateral arteries. Treatment of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) with IFNβ resulted in an attenuated proliferation, cell-cycle arrest, and increased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-1A (p21). The growth inhibitory effect of IFNβ was attenuated by inhibition of p21 by RNA interference. IFNβ-treated THP1 monocytes showed enhanced apoptosis. Subsequently, we tested if collateral artery growth can be stimulated by inhibition of IFNβ-signaling. RNA interference of the IFNβ receptor-1 (IFNAR1) increased VSMC proliferation, cell cycle progression, and reduced p21 gene expression. IFNβ signaling and FAS and TRAIL expression were attenuated in monocytes from IFNAR1−/− mice, indicating reduced monocyte apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W2012455255,"Although it is well established that the majority of eukaryotic DNA is sequestered as nucleosomes, the higher-order structure resulting from nucleosome interactions as well as the dynamics of nucleosome stability are not as well understood. To characterize the structural and functional contribution of individual nucleosomal sites, we have developed a chromatin model system containing up to four nucleosomes, where the array composition, saturation, and length can be varied via the ordered ligation of distinct mononucleosomes. Using this system we find that the ligated tetranucleosomal arrays undergo intra-array compaction. However, this compaction is less extensive than for longer arrays and is histone H4 tail-independent, suggesting that well ordered stretches of four or fewer nucleosomes do not fully compact to the 30-nm fiber. Like longer arrays, the tetranucleosomal arrays exhibit cooperative self-association to form species composed of many copies of the array. This propensity for self-association decreases when the fraction of nucleosomes lacking H4 tails is systematically increased. However, even tetranucleosomal arrays with only two octamers possessing H4 tails recapitulate most of the inter-array self-association. Varying array length shows that systems as short as dinucleosomes demonstrate significant self-association, confirming that relatively few determinants are required for inter-array interactions and suggesting that in vivo multiple interactions of short runs of nucleosomes might contribute to complex fiber-fiber interactions. Additionally, we find that the stability of nucleosomes toward octamer loss increases with array length and saturation, suggesting that in vivo stretches of ordered, saturated nucleosomes could serve to protect these regions from histone ejection.

IntroductionThe nucleosome, composed of a histone octamer wrapped by 147 bp of DNA (1Luger K. Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6795) Google Scholar, 2Richmond T.J. Davey C.A. Nature. 2003; 423: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar), is the fundamental repeating unit of chromatin. Nucleosomes ubiquitously associate with genomic DNA, occupying the majority of DNA in most cells (3van Holde K.E. Rich A. Springer Series in Molecular Biology. Springer-Verlag, New York1989: 289-354Google Scholar). For example, high-resolution nucleosome mapping of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae suggests 69% of the DNA is associated with nucleosomes (4Yuan G.C. Liu Y.J. Dion M.F. Slack M.D. Wu L.F. Altschuler S.J. Rando O.J. Science. 2005; 309: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). Nucleosome positioning across the genome is not fully understood but is dictated in part by the underlying genomic sequence by the association and action of non-nucleosomal proteins and potentially by the direct interaction of nucleosomes (5Segal E. Fondufe-Mittendorf Y. Chen L. Thåström A. Field Y. Moore I.K. Wang J.P. Widom J. Nature. 2006; 442: 772-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). Positioning of nucleosomes results in free linker DNA between nucleosomes that varies within a genome and between cell types and species and can range from 10 or fewer nucleotides to more than 100 nucleotides (3van Holde K.E. Rich A. Springer Series in Molecular Biology. Springer-Verlag, New York1989: 289-354Google Scholar).Nucleosomes can interact with one another, generating chromatin structures that affect DNA-based biological processes such as transcription, replication, and repair. Direct nucleosome to nucleosome interactions that have been observed in vitro include short-range nucleosome interactions that form 30-nm fibers and longer range interactions to generate fiber to fiber structures (6van Holde K. Zlatanova J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 18: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 7Schwarz P.M. Hansen J.C. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4009-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The structural details and determinants of these higher-order structures remain an active area of research. However, previous studies have shown that histone tails, N-terminal stretches of amino acids that protrude out from the histone core, play a significant role in these processes, with the H4 tail playing a predominant role in both types of interactions (9Tse C. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11381-11388Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 10Dorigo B. Schalch T. Bystricky K. Richmond T.J. J. Mol.

Although the mechanism by which this repression is achieved is still not well defined in vivo, in vitro these proteins facilitate the creation of short and long range higher order chromatin structures through their interaction with various aspects of histone modifications, histone tails, the nucleosome core, and/or the linker DNA (14Francis N.J.

Nucleosome to nucleosome interactions may also be present in more transcriptionally active euchromatic regions, as establishment of histone H3 acetylation by the yeast SAGA coactivator complex can be facilitated by what appears to involve long-range bridging of nucleosomes (23Li S. Shogren-Knaak M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 18243-18248Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).The presence of nucleosomes can create a physical barrier that limits interaction with underlying DNA by proteins that are involved in transcription, replication, and repair. Because nucleosomes are dynamic structures that can be moved, assembled, and disassembled in a regulated fashion, this access can be controlled. For example, during transcriptional initiation, nucleosomes can be disassembled to generate stretches of DNA that are largely free of nucleosomes (24Reinke H. Hörz W. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1599-1607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 25Boeger H. Griesenbeck J. Strattan J.S. Kornberg R.D. Mol.

Biol. 2006; 13: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This disassembly process involves many factors, including nucleosome remodeling complexes, histone modifying enzymes, and histone chaperones (27Workman J.L. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2009-2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Loss of nucleosomes enhances transcription through a number of potential mechanisms, including exposure of stretches of DNA bearing transcriptional activator binding sites (28Lam F.H. Steger D.J. O'Shea E.K. Nature. 2008; 453: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar).Because the presence and interactions of nucleosomes have important structural and functional consequences but are potentially difficult to dissect into individual nucleosome components with traditional nucleosomal array systems, we sought to develop a new model system in which the composition of individual nucleosomes could be controlled. In this study we ligate mononucleosomes to assemble well ordered di-, tri, and tetranucleosomal arrays to better understand various features of higher-order chromatin structure and nucleosome stability.

U.S.A. 2008; 105: 18243-18248Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).The presence of nucleosomes can create a physical barrier that limits interaction with underlying DNA by proteins that are involved in transcription, replication, and repair. Because nucleosomes are dynamic structures that can be moved, assembled, and disassembled in a regulated fashion, this access can be controlled. For example, during transcriptional initiation, nucleosomes can be disassembled to generate stretches of DNA that are largely free of nucleosomes (24Reinke H. Hörz W. Mol.

Biol. 2006; 13: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This disassembly process involves many factors, including nucleosome remodeling complexes, histone modifying enzymes, and histone chaperones (27Workman J.L. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2009-2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Loss of nucleosomes enhances transcription through a number of potential mechanisms, including exposure of stretches of DNA bearing transcriptional activator binding sites (28Lam F.H. Steger D.J. O'Shea E.K. Nature. 2008; 453: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar).Because the presence and interactions of nucleosomes have important structural and functional consequences but are potentially difficult to dissect into individual nucleosome components with traditional nucleosomal array systems, we sought to develop a new model system in which the composition of individual nucleosomes could be controlled. In this study we ligate mononucleosomes to assemble well ordered di-, tri, and tetranucleosomal arrays to better understand various features of higher-order chromatin structure and nucleosome stability. The nucleosome, composed of a histone octamer wrapped by 147 bp of DNA (1Luger K. Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6795) Google Scholar, 2Richmond T.J. Davey C.A. Nature. 2003; 423: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar), is the fundamental repeating unit of chromatin. Nucleosomes ubiquitously associate with genomic DNA, occupying the majority of DNA in most cells (3van Holde K.E. Rich A. Springer Series in Molecular Biology. Springer-Verlag, New York1989: 289-354Google Scholar). For example, high-resolution nucleosome mapping of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae suggests 69% of the DNA is associated with nucleosomes (4Yuan G.C. Liu Y.J. Dion M.F. Slack M.D. Wu L.F. Altschuler S.J. Rando O.J. Science. 2005; 309: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). Nucleosome positioning across the genome is not fully understood but is dictated in part by the underlying genomic sequence by the association and action of non-nucleosomal proteins and potentially by the direct interaction of nucleosomes (5Segal E. Fondufe-Mittendorf Y. Chen L. Thåström A. Field Y. Moore I.K. Wang J.P. Widom J. Nature. 2006; 442: 772-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). Positioning of nucleosomes results in free linker DNA between nucleosomes that varies within a genome and between cell types and species and can range from 10 or fewer nucleotides to more than 100 nucleotides (3van Holde K.E. Rich A. Springer Series in Molecular Biology. Springer-Verlag, New York1989: 289-354Google Scholar). Nucleosomes can interact with one another, generating chromatin structures that affect DNA-based biological processes such as transcription, replication, and repair. Direct nucleosome to nucleosome interactions that have been observed in vitro include short-range nucleosome interactions that form 30-nm fibers and longer range interactions to generate fiber to fiber structures (6van Holde K. Zlatanova J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 18: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 7Schwarz P.M. Hansen J.C. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4009-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The structural details and determinants of these higher-order structures remain an active area of research. However, previous studies have shown that histone tails, N-terminal stretches of amino acids that protrude out from the histone core, play a significant role in these processes, with the H4 tail playing a predominant role in both types of interactions (9Tse C.

Other nucleosome-associated interactions that affect higher order chromatin structure are mediated by non-histone chromatin associated proteins. Several proteins play a role in the formation and/or maintenance of repressive chromatin, including the polycomb group protein PRC1 (14Francis N.J. Kingston R.E. Woodcock C.L.

Although the mechanism by which this repression is achieved is still not well defined in vivo, in vitro these proteins facilitate the creation of short and long range higher order chromatin structures through their interaction with various aspects of histone modifications, histone tails, the nucleosome core, and/or the linker DNA (14Francis N.J.

This study determined the kinetic properties of the individual human CTPS isozymes (hCTPS1 and hCTPS2) and regulation through substrate concentration, oligomerization, and phosphorylation. Kinetic analysis demonstrated that both hCTPS1 and hCTPS2 were maximally active at physiological concentrations of ATP, GTP, and glutamine, whereas the Km and IC50 values for the substrate UTP and the product CTP, respectively, were close to their physiological concentrations, indicating that the intracellular concentrations of UTP and CTP may precisely regulate hCTPS activity. Low serum treatment increased hCTPS2 phosphorylation, and five probable phosphorylation sites were identified in the hCTPS2 C-terminal domain. Metabolic labeling of hCTPS2 with [32P]H3PO4 demonstrated that Ser568 and Ser571 were two major phosphorylation sites, and additional studies demonstrated that Ser568 was phosphorylated by casein kinase 1 both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, mutation of Ser568 (S568A) but not Ser571 significantly increased hCTPS2 activity, demonstrating that Ser568 is a major inhibitory phosphorylation site. The S568A mutation had a greater effect on the glutamine than ammonia-dependent activity, indicating that phosphorylation of this site may influence the glutaminase domain of hCTPS2. Deletion of the C-terminal regulatory domain of hCTPS1 also greatly increased the Vmax of this enzyme. In summary, this is the first study to characterize the kinetic properties of hCTPS1 and hCTPS2 and to identify Ser568 as a major site of CTPS2 regulation by phosphorylation.

We describe the isolation of a meningococcal mutant lacking PPX, an exopolyphosphatase responsible for cleaving cellular polyphosphate, a polymer of tens to hundreds of orthophosphate residues found in virtually all living cells. Bacteria lacking PPX exhibit increased resistance to complement-mediated killing. By site directed mutagenesis, we define amino acids necessary for the biochemical activity of meningococcal PPX, including a conserved glutamate (Glu117) and residues in the Walker B box predicted to be involved in binding to phosphate. We show that the biochemical activity of PPX is necessary for interactions with the complement. The relative resistance of the ppx mutant does not result from changes in structures (such as capsule, lipopolysaccharide, and factor H-binding protein), which are known to be required for evasion of this key aspect of host immunity. Instead, expression of PPX modifies the interaction of N. meningitidis with the alternative pathway of complement activation.

Instead, expression of PPX modifies the interaction of N. meningitidis with the alternative pathway of complement activation. Neisseria meningitidis remains a leading cause of septicemia and bacterial meningitis worldwide (1Stephens D.S. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2007; 31: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Although the bacterium is a common commensal of the human upper respiratory tract in between 5 and 40% of healthy adults (2Yazdankhah S.P. Caugant D.A. J. Med. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 821-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), N. meningitidis occasionally disseminates from this site, entering the bloodstream and the cerebrospinal fluid to cause bacteremic disease and meningitis. Meningococcal disease can progress rapidly, and septicemia still carries a significant case fatality rate of ∼10% (3van Deuren M. Brandtzaeg P. van der Meer J.W. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 13: 144-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Furthermore, survivors can be left with disabilities, including hearing and other neurological deficits and loss of digits or limbs. The pathological consequences of meningococcal infection are dependent on the ability of the bacterium to survive and replicate within the systemic circulation, and the level of bacteremia, which can reach as high as 108–109 cfu/ml (4Darton T. Guiver M. Naylor S. Jack D.L. Kaczmarski E.B. Borrow R. Read R.C. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2009; 48: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), is directly correlated with the outcome. To reach such high levels, N. meningitidis must obtain nutrients to sustain its replication and avoid killing by the immune system (5Exley R.M. Shaw J. Mowe E. Sun Y.H. West N.P. Williamson M.

This is demonstrated by the exquisite susceptibility of individuals with complement deficiencies to meningococcal disease (7Figueroa J.E. Densen P. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 4: 359-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar); people with inherited absence of components of the membrane attack complex (MAC 2The abbreviations used are: MACmembrane attack complexpolyPpolyphosphateCPclassical pathwayLPlectin pathwayAPalternative pathwayfHbpfactor H-binding proteinBHIbrain heart infusionTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineNHSnormal human serumPPKpolyphosphate kinasePPXexopolyphosphatase.; C5–9-inclusive), which is necessary for the bacteriolytic activity of complement, have over a 1,000-fold increased lifetime risk of developing systemic meningococcal disease and are prone to recurrent infection (7Figueroa J.E.

Additionally, polymorphisms associated with other genes encoding complement factors, including mannose binding lectin and factor H (8Hibberd M.L. Sumiya M. Summerfield J.A. Booy R. Levin M.

The complement system can be activated through any of three pathways: the classical (CP), lectin (LP), and alternative (AP) pathways. All pathways converge at the cleavage of C3 to C3b by a C3 convertase. C3b is covalently linked to the surface of pathogens, which are then eliminated through phagocytosis or lysis following assembly of the MAC (10Walport M.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1058-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (2422) Google Scholar). The CP is initiated mainly by antibody binding to a foreign antigen, whereas the LP is activated through recognition of carbohydrates on the pathogen surface. In contrast, the AP largely serves to amplify complement activation initiated by the other pathways (10Walport M.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1058-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (2422) Google Scholar) and is precisely regulated during health by a series of membrane-bound and soluble factors such as factor H (11Zipfel P.F. Skerka C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). Several factors enable the meningococcus to overcome complement-mediated killing. Virtually all isolates of N. meningitidis from the systemic circulation express a polysaccharide capsule, whereas only around 40% of isolates from the nasopharynx are encapsulated (2Yazdankhah S.P. Caugant D.A. J. Med. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 821-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Strains lacking a capsule or expressing truncated forms of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) are highly sensitive to complement-mediated lysis in the presence of human serum (12Vogel U. Hammerschmidt S. Frosch M. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 185: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). LPS can be modified by addition of a sialic acid residue, and this can promote resistance against complement (13Estabrook M.M. Griffiss J.M. Jarvis G.A. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 4436-4444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of both capsule and lipopolysaccharide was highlighted in a study of over 4,000 N. meningitidis mutants in which all 18 mutants with enhanced sensitivity to complement were affected in the biogenesis of either capsule or LPS (14Geoffroy M.C. Floquet S. Métais A. Nassif X. Pelicic V. Genome Res. 2003; 13: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). More recently it has also been shown that the bacterium recruits factor H (15Schneider M.C. Exley R.M. Chan H. Feavers I. Kang Y.H. Sim R.B. Tang C.M. J.

Nature. 2009; 458: 890-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Here we sought to further understand the interaction of N. meningitidis with the human complement system by screening a library of transposon mutants for those with enhanced resistance against complement-mediated killing. We describe the identification of a mutant lacking an enzyme encoded by NMB1467 that we show is a polyphosphatase (PPX) and is responsible for cleaving cellular polyphosphate (polyP). PolyP forms linear chains composed of tens to many hundreds of inorganic phosphate (Pi) residues linked by a phosphoranhydride bond in virtually all living cells (18Shi X. Rao N.N. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 17061-17065Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We identify key amino acids required for PPX activity and provide insights into its contribution to avoidance of complement-mediated lysis. The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this work are shown in Table 1. N. meningitidis was grown on brain heart infusion (BHI) agar plates with Levinthal's supplement in the presence of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For growth curves, grown bacteria overnight were diluted to an A600 of 0.1 in 10 ml of liquid BHI. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C at 150 rpm. Samples were taken every hour to measure the A600, and the number of cfu was determined by plating aliquots of the cultures to solid medium. Escherichia coli was grown either in Luria-Bertani (LB) liquid medium with shaking at 200 rpm or on LB agar (1.5%, w/v) plates overnight at 37 °C. Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations: kanamycin, 50 and 75 μg/ml; erythromycin, 200 and 2.5 μg/ml; tetracycline, 15 and 2.5 μg/ml for E. coli and Neisseria, respectively; and ampicillin, 50 μg/ml for E. coli.TABLE 1Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this studyStrains/plasmidsGenotype/descriptionRef.N. meningitidis MC58Wild-type serogroup B19Tettelin H.

DNA samples were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by staining with 0.1% SYBR Green (Invitrogen). DNA was recovered from gels by the QIAquick method (Qiagen). Ligations were performed with pCR®2.1-TOPO® (Invitrogen) or T4 ligase (New England Biolabs). Competent E. coli was transformed by heat shock. To transform N. meningitidis, strains were grown overnight and resuspended in PBS, a 10-μl aliquot was plated to solid medium, and then DNA (∼1 μg) was added. The bacteria were incubated for 3–4 h and then plated to selective medium. PCRs were performed in a 50-μl volume with a 0.2 μm concentration of each primer, 2–50 ng of template DNA, and 2 units of Taq DNA polymerase. Details of the oligonucleotides are given in Table 2. Polymerase with proof reading activity (Expand High Fidelity, Roche Applied Science) was used to amplify DNA fragments for complementation and protein expression. For Southern analysis, genomic DNA was digested, and the fragments were separated by electrophoresis and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond N+, GE Healthcare) by standard methods.

Chromosomal DNA from N. meningitidis strain MC58 was incubated with Tn5 containing a Neisseria DNA uptake sequence and an E. coli origin of replication along with purified transposase. Reaction products were repaired with T4 DNA polymerase and T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) and used to transform N. meningitidis to kanamycin resistance. For complementation, nmb1467 was amplified from genomic DNA with primers NG551 and NG552, the product was digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and ligated into pYHS25 (20Winzer K.

Immun. 2002; 70: 2245-2248Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and the construct was used to transform MC58nmb1467::Tn5, resulting in MC58ppxcom. The same approach was used to generate MC58ppxE147A. To construct the N. meningitidis ppk mutant (21Tinsley C.R. Manjula B.N. Gotschlich E.C. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3703-3710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Tinsley C.R. Gotschlich E.C. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1624-1630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the entire nmb1900 ORF was amplified from MC58 genomic DNA with primers NG1153 and NG1157 and cloned into pTrcHisB (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid was linearized by digestion with EcoRI (at nucleotide 1704 in the ORF) and ligated to a gene encoding tetracycline resistance (tetM) (23Herbert M.A. Hayes S. Deadman M.E. Tang C.M. Hood D.W. Moxon E.R. Microb. Pathog. 2002; 33: 211-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The construct was amplified by PCR and introduced into N. meningitidis by transformation. The identity and genomic location of the transposon in the mutants were confirmed by PCR and Southern analysis. For RNA isolation, bacteria were grown in liquid BHI with gentle agitation to midlog phase and harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g, and RNA was extracted with the RNeasy method (Qiagen). Genomic DNA was removed by DNase treatment (Qiagen), and RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using SuperScript III First Strand Synthesis (Invitrogen). Transcript levels were measured by quantitative real time RT-PCR with SYBR Green detection (Quantace) on a Rotor-Gene 3000 thermal cycler (Corbett Research). The following primers were used to monitor transcript levels. NG955 and NG956 were used to amplify a 197-bp ppk product, whereas NG886 and NG887 generated a 235-bp product from the housekeeping gene gdh. Results for ppk were adjusted to the levels for gdh mRNA (Rotor-Gene 6.0 software). Quantitative real time RT-PCR was performed in triplicate on RNA obtained on three independent occasions. Whole cell lysates were prepared by mixing 1010 cfu/ml bacteria with an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 20 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol) and then boiling for 10 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE as described previously (5Exley R.M. Shaw J. Mowe E. Sun Y.H. West N.P. Williamson M. Botto M. Smith H. Tang C.M. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 1637-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred to Immobilon P polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore). Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies (concentration and incubation times were optimized for each antibody), washed with PBS and 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T), and then incubated with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. Binding was detected with the ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). For LPS analysis, bacterial suspensions were mixed with an equal volume of 2× LPS loading buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 6% β-mercaptoethanol, 6% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 46% glycerol, 10 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated with proteinase K (100 μg/ml final concentration) at 37 °C overnight. Samples were separated by Tricine SDS-PAGE as described previously (5Exley R.M. Shaw J. Mowe E. Sun Y.H. West N.P. Williamson M. Botto M. Smith H. Tang C.M. J. Exp.

LPS was visualized by silver staining (GE Healthcare). nmb1467 was amplified with primers NG552 and NG559, and the product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated into pET-15b (Novagen) to generate pnmb1467-pET-15b. pnmb1467E147A-pET-15b was constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with pnmb1467-pET-15b as DNA template and primers NG607 and NG608. Alanine substitution of residues Glu117, Asp140, and Ser145 was performed using a two-step PCR strategy. The upstream region of nmb1467 was amplified using NG559 with NG1985, NG1987, or NG1989 (for nmb1467E117A, nmb1467D140A, and nmb1467S145A, respectively); the downstream region was amplified with NG552 with NG1984, NG1986, or NG1988 (for nmb1467E117A, nmb1467D140A, and nmb1467S145A, respectively). The PCR products containing the desired mutations were mixed and used as template to amplify full-length nmb1467 with primers NG552 and NG559 and ligated into pET-15b. Plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21, and protein expression was induced with isopropyl d-thiogalactoside at a final concentration of 1 mm. Recombinant proteins were purified on a HisTrapTM HP column (GE healthcare) and eluted with a buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (41Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217370) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies were generated against NMB1467 by immunizing 6–8-week-old BALB/c mice (Harlan) by the subcutaneous route with 20 μg of NMB1467 with incomplete Freund's adjuvant on days 0, 21. and 28. Immune sera were obtained on day 35. All procedures were performed in accordance with Home Office guidelines. To screen for genes involved in resistance against complement, mutants from the library (105 cfu) were incubated with dilutions of heat-inactivated convalescent sera with baby rabbit complement (Pelfreeze; 1:4 final dilution) in a 2-ml volume for 1 h (24Maslanka S.E. Gheesling L.L. Libutti D.E. Donaldson K.B. Harakeh H.S. Dykes J.K. Arhin F.F. Devi S.J. Frasch C.E. Huang J.C. Kriz-Kuzemenska P. Lemmon R.D. Lorange M. Peeters C.C. Quataert S. Tai J.Y. Carlone G.M. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 1997; 4: 156-167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bacteria were recovered by plating to solid medium. For serum assays, bacteria were diluted to a final concentration of 1 × 105 cfu/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without CMP-N-acetyl neuraminic acid and incubated with different concentrations of normal human serum (NHS) at 37 °C for 1 h. Human serum was heated at 56 °C for 30 min to inactivate complement as required. To assess the binding of complement factors, bacteria were grown overnight and then fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for at least 1 h, and 2 × 107 cells were incubated with pooled immune sera from 10 individuals for 30 min at 37 °C, washed twice, and then resuspended in PBS-T with a FITC-conjugated goat anti-human C3 polyclonal antibody (ICN; at a 1:300 dilution) or a rabbit anti-human C5b-9 polyclonal antibody (Calbiochem; at a 1:200 dilution). Binding was detected with a goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen; at a 1:200 dilution). The activity of the CP and LP was inhibited in sera in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2 and 10 mm EGTA (25Drogari-Apiranthitou M. Kuijper E.J. Dekker N. Dankert J. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 3752-3758Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Strains were grown to midlogarithmic phase in liquid medium, collected by centrifugation, fixed as above, and then washed three times with PBS. Next, bacteria (2 × 107 cells) were incubated with mAb 3F11 (26Yamasaki R. Nasholds W. Schneider H. Apicella M.A. Mol. Immunol. 1991; 28: 1233-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) or an anti-serogroup B capsule mAb (National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, code 95/750). The cells were washed twice, resuspended in PBS-T containing a FITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse polyclonal antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories; at a 1:200 dilution), and incubated for 30 min on ice. After washing with PBS-T, fluorescence was measured using a FACSCalibur analyzer (BD Biosciences) recording at least 104 events. The gate was set at ∼2% of cells after incubation with PBS without a primary antibody. Results were expressed as the mean fluorescence index calculated as geometric mean fluorescence multiplied by the percentage of positive cells. The activity of NMB1467 was measured by its ability to reduce the concentration of Type 75 polyP (Sigma) with 1 unit of enzyme defined as the amount causing the release of 1 pmol of Pi from polyP/min at 37 °C. Reactions containing 50 mm Tricine/KOH, pH 8, 175 mm KCl, 15 mm polyP, and 1 mm MgCl2 or CaCl2 were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. To measure the concentration of polyP, 10-μl aliquots of reactions were added to toluidine blue (6 mg/liter), and the ratio of A at 530 and 630 nm was determined. As a polyanion, polyP induces a shift in the absorption spectrum of toluidine blue from 630 to 530 nm, and the concentration of polyP directly corresponds to changes in the ratio of absorbance at these wavelengths (27Mullan A. Quinn J.P. McGrath J.W. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 308: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Standard curves were generated with known concentrations of polyP. To measure polyP levels in N. meningitidis, polyP was extracted from cells using glass milk and converted to ATP, which was quantified by measuring bioluminescence in the presence of luciferase as described previously (28Ault-Riché D. Fraley C.D. Tzeng C.M. Kornberg A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1841-1847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 109 cfu of N. meningitidis were harvested after overnight growth on plates and lysed in 4 m guanidine isothiocyanate and 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7. Whole cell lysates were incubated with glass milk, treated with DNase and RNase (New England Biolabs), and washed, and the polyP was eluted with 150 μl of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8 and then measured by adding 50 μl of the sample to an equal volume of 40 mm (NH4)2SO4, 4 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm ADP with 1 μg of purified His-tagged polyphosphate kinase (PPK) (29Price-Carter M. Fazzio T.G. Vallbona E.I. Roth J.R. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 3088-3099Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The reaction was incubated for 40 min at 37 °C and then at 90 °C for 2 min to generate ATP from polyP. The mixture containing ATP was added to an equal volume of the CellTiter-Glow® reagent, and luminescence was measured with a Turner Designs TD-20/20 luminometer (Fisher). Significant differences in bacterial recovery, polyP levels, and mean fluorescence index between strains were examined with the Student's t test. To further understand interactions between N. meningitidis and the complement system, we isolated mutants with enhanced resistance against complement-mediated killing by screening a library of ∼40,000 MC58 mutants constructed by in vitro Tn5 mutagenesis. Mutants in the library or the wild-type strain MC58 were incubated for 2 h in the presence of dilutions of heat-inactivated convalescent sera from two patients with baby rabbit complement. No colonies were recovered after the wild-type strain was incubated in a 1:512 dilution of immune sera from the patients. However, several colonies were recovered when bacteria from the library were incubated under identical conditions. Two independent nmb1467 mutants, with Tn5 inserted at nucleotide 165 or nucleotide 187 of the predicted ORF, were recovered in separate screens with sera from the two patients. nmb1467 is present in the five available N. meningitidis genomes and 21 of 21 other isolates (detected by PCR; not shown). Examination of ORFs around nmb1467 suggests that transposon insertion in this gene is unlikely to cause polar effects (Fig. 1A). However, to exclude this possibility, the MC58nmb1467::Tn5 mutant was complemented by introducing a single wild-type copy of the gene under the control of its own promoter in the intergenic region between nmb102 and nmb103 (20Winzer K. Sun Y.H. Green A. Delory M. Blackley D. Hardie K.R. Baldwin T.J. Tang C.M. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 2245-2248Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), generating MC58nmb1467com (Fig. 1A). To examine the contribution of nmb1467 to survival in the presence of human complement, the recovery of MC58, MC58nmb1467::Tn5, and MC58nmb1467com was compared after 1 h in NHS. In a 1:8 dilution of NHS, approximately twice the number of MC58nmb1467::Tn5 survived compared with the wild-type strain (Fig. 1B; p < 0.001). This relative resistance was not observed in the complemented strain MC58nmb1467com (Fig. 1B), demonstrating that inactivation of nmb1467 is responsible for the enhanced resistance of the nmb1467 mutant. In contrast, there was no significant difference in the recovery of the strains after incubation in heat-treated serum (Fig. 1C; p = 0.086 for MC58 versus MC58nmb1467::Tn5, and p = 0.25 for MC58nmb1467::Tn5 versus MC58nm"
https://openalex.org/W2037663736,"Epigenetic mechanisms regulate the expression of virulence traits in diverse pathogens, including protozoan and fungi. In the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans, virulence traits such as antifungal resistance, white-opaque switching, and adhesion to lung cells are regulated by histone deacetylases (HDACs). However, the role of HDACs in the regulation of the yeast-hyphal morphogenetic transitions, a critical virulence attribute of C. albicans, remains poorly explored. In this study, we wished to determine the relevance of other HDACs on C. albicans morphogenesis. We generated mutants in the HDACs HOS1, HOS2, RPD31, and HDA1 and determined their ability to filament in response to different environmental stimuli. We found that while HOS1 and RPD31 have no or a more limited role in morphogenesis, the HDACs HOS2 and HDA1 have opposite roles in the regulation of hyphal formation. Our results demonstrate an important role for HDACs on the regulation of yeast-hyphal transitions in the human pathogen C. albicans."
https://openalex.org/W2147815579,"Lipid peroxidation in tissue and in tissue fractions represents a degradative process, which is the consequence of the production and the propagation of free radical reactions primarily involving membrane polyunsaturated fatty acids, and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We have found that bovine serum albumin incubated with peroxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids significantly cross-reacted with the sera from MRL-lpr mice, a representative murine model of SLE. To identify the active substances responsible for the generation of autoantigenic epitopes recognized by the SLE sera, we performed the activity-guiding separation of a principal source from 13-hydroperoxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic acid and identified 4-oxo-2-nonenal (ONE), a highly reactive aldehyde originating from the peroxidation of ω6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, as the source of the autoantigenic epitopes. When the age-dependent change in the antibody titer against the ONE-modified protein was measured in the sera from MRL-lpr mice and control MRL-MpJ mice, all of the MRL-lpr mice developed an anti-ONE titer, which was comparable with the anti-DNA titer. Strikingly, a subset of the anti-DNA monoclonal antibodies generated from the SLE mice showing recognition specificity toward DNA cross-reacted with the ONE-specific epitopes. Furthermore, these dual-specific antibodies rapidly bound and internalized into living cells. These findings raised the possibility that the enhanced lipid peroxidation followed by the generation of ONE may be involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders.

Several lines of evidence indicate that the nonenzymatic oxidative modification of proteins and the subsequent accumulation of the modified proteins have been found in cells during aging, during oxidative stress, and in various pathological states including premature diseases, muscular dystrophy, rheumatoid arthritis, and atherosclerosis (1Stadtman E.R. Science. 1992; 257: 1220-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (2389) Google Scholar, 2Stadtman E.R. Levine R.L. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 899: 191-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that many of the effects of cellular dysfunction under oxidative stress are mediated by the products of nonenzymatic reactions, such as the peroxidative degradation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (3Uchida K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1685-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 4Uchida K. Prog. Lipid Res. 2003; 42: 318-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Lipid peroxidation leads to the formation of a broad array of different products with diverse and powerful biological activities. Among them are a variety of different aldehydes. The primary products of lipid peroxidation, lipid hydroperoxides, can undergo carbon-carbon bond cleavage via alkoxyl radicals in the presence of transition metals, giving rise to the formation of short chain, unesterified aldehydes of three to nine carbons in length and a second class of aldehydes still esterified to the parent lipid (5Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5889) Google Scholar). These aldehydes generated during the lipid peroxidation have been implicated as causative agents in cytotoxic processes initiated by the exposure of biological systems to oxidizing agents. Some of the lipid peroxidation products exhibit a facile reactivity with proteins, generating a variety of intra- and intermolecular covalent adducts. Binder and Silverman (6Binder C.J. Silverman G.J. Springer Semin. Immunopathol. 2005; 26: 385-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) proposed that such adducts, called oxidation-derived epitopes, generated on self-antigens, are important immunodominant targets of natural antibodies and suggested that these antibodies play an important function in the host response to the consequences of oxidative stress during oxidative events that occur when cells undergo apoptosis. The fact that the post-translational modification of proteins is enhanced in aging and stressed cells and arises under physiological conditions (1Stadtman E.R. Science. 1992; 257: 1220-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (2389) Google Scholar, 2Stadtman E.R. Levine R.L. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 899: 191-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar) suggests the existence of an association between the formation of oxidation-specific epitopes and immune disorders. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) 2The abbreviations used are: SLEsystemic lupus erythematosusONE4-oxo-2-nonenalssDNAsingle-stranded DNA. is a potentially fatal systemic autoimmune disease, characterized by the increased production of autoantibodies, immune complex deposition in the microvasculature, leukocyte infiltration, and, ultimately, tissue damage in a number of organs. Of the multiple autoantibodies described in this disease, antibodies against the native DNA are among the most characteristic, yet the triggering antigen in the disease is still unknown. The appearance of these antibodies in humans and in murine models of lupus correlates with the progression of the disease, and by comparison with all the other lupus autoantibodies, those against the double-stranded DNA are thought to be the most pathogenic and involved in the development of renal pathology (7Koffler D. Carr R.I. Agnello V. Thoburn R. Kunkel H.G. J. Exp. Med. 1971; 134: 294-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). However, because of the systemic character and complexity of the disease, it still remains unclear what exactly are the primary stimuli that drive such autoantibody responses and the mechanisms that regulate the entire pathological process in lupus. Although some bacterial DNAs appear to be immunogenic in normal mouse strains, they do not elicit the production of antibodies that cross-react with the eukaryotic DNA (8Pisetsky D.S. Grudier J.P. Gilkeson G.S. Arthritis Rheum. 1990; 33: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 9Gilkeson G.S. Pippen A.M. Pisetsky D.S. J. Clin.

Thus, it remains unclear whether DNA or nucleosomes induce the anti-DNA antibodies in lupus-prone mice or whether the anti-DNA antibodies are made in response to some other antigen, either itself or foreign. systemic lupus erythematosus 4-oxo-2-nonenal single-stranded DNA. There is increasing evidence that lipid peroxidation plays a role in SLE: (i) SLE patients have an enhanced urinary excretion of isoprostanes, the well established biomarkers of lipid peroxidation (10Kurz E.U. Lees-Miller S.P. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 889-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar); (ii) the levels of the lipid peroxidation-derived short chain aldehydes are significantly elevated in children with a high disease activity of SLE (11Oren M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36031-36034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar); and (iii) there are elevated levels of the oxidized LDL together with elevated levels of autoantibodies related to the oxidized LDL in female patients with SLE (12Brown J.M. Wouters B.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1391-1399PubMed Google Scholar). The involvement of lipid peroxidation was also suggested by the observation that lipid peroxidation-specific epitopes were detected in tissues from the SLE patients (13Toyoda K. Nagae R. Akagawa M. Ishino K. Shibata T. Ito S. Shibata N. Yamamoto T. Kobayashi M. Takasaki Y. Matsuda T. Uchida K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25769-25778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These findings raised the possibility that the enhanced lipid peroxidation, through its pivotal role in oxidative stress, may be involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders. In light of the importance of lipid peroxidation-specific epitopes in autoimmune diseases, we sought to identify the source of the autoantigenic epitopes from the in vitro peroxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids. Following the identification of an active substance, we generated several anti-DNA mAbs from MRL-lpr mice and characterized their dual specificity toward DNA and lipid peroxidation-derived protein ligands. We also describe their genetic origins and ability to bind and internalize into live cells. Soybean lipoxidase (type I-B) and calf thymus DNA were purchased from Sigma. Linoleic acid was obtained from Nu-Chek Prep, Inc. (Elysian, MN). 13-Hydroperoxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic acid was synthesized by a previously described method (14Brash A.R. Song W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 250-259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other aldehydes were purchased from the Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). The HRP-linked anti-rabbit IgG immunoglobulin, HRP-NeutrAvidin, and ECL Western blotting detection reagents were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Female MRL-lpr and MRL-MpJ mice were purchased from Chubu Kagaku Shizai Co., Ltd. (Nagoya, Japan). All of the animal protocols were approved by the Animal Experiment Committee in the Graduate School of Bioagricultural Sciences of Nagoya University. The 1H NMR spectrum was recorded at 27 °C using an AMX400 (400 MHz) spectrometer (Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany). The solvent peak served as an internal standard for reporting the chemical shifts, which are expressed as parts per million downfield from tetramethylsilane (δ scale). HPLC was conducted using a JASCO system (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan). Modification of the protein by the lipid peroxidation products was performed by incubating BSA (1.0 mg/ml) with linoleic acid (5.0 mm), FeSO4(NH4)2SO4·6H2O (0.5 mm), and ascorbic acid (2.0 mm) in 0.1 m HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) with 10% ethanol at 37 °C under atmospheric oxygen. After 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h, aliquots were collected, and the reaction was terminated by adding butylated hydroxytoluene (1.0 mm) and diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (100 μm). Decomposition of the lipid hydroperoxide was performed by incubating 13-hydroperoxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic acid (1.0 mm) with FeSO4(NH4)2SO4.6H2O (125 μm) and ascorbic acid (500 μm) in 0.1 m HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) with 10% ethanol. The reaction mixture was vortexed and then followed by incubation with continuous shaking at 37 °C. After 4 h, the reaction mixture was cooled in an ice bath and extracted with diethylether. The diethylether layer was dried (Na2SO4) and concentrated in vacuo, and the residue was dissolved in acetonitrile and subjected to reverse phase HPLC on a Develosil ODS-HG-5 column (8.0-mm inner diameter × 250 mm; Nomura Chemicals, Aichi, Japan) eluted with a gradient of water containing 0.1% TFA (solvent A) with acetonitrile (solvent B) (0–20 min, 40% B; 40–50 min, 100% B) at a flow rate of 2.0 ml/min. The elution profiles were monitored by a photodiode array. The eluate was collected at 2-min intervals. The collected products were evaporated from acetonitrile and extracted using a 100-mg C18 Sep-Pak cartridge (Waters) eluted with diethylether. After concentration in vacuo, all of the fractions were incubated with 0.05 mg/ml BSA at 37 °C for 24 h as the coating agents in ELISA. The ELISA-positive fraction was further separated by reverse phase HPLC on a ChromaNik sunrise PhE column (4.6-mm inner diameter × 250 mm; ChromaNik, Osaka, Japan) eluted with a 30% acetonitrile containing 0.1% TFA at the flow rate of 1.2 ml/min. The elution profiles were monitored by a photodiode array. The eluate was collected at 2-min intervals. The collected products were evaporated from acetonitrile and extracted using a 100-mg C18 Sep-Pak cartridge (Waters) eluted with diethylether. After concentration in vacuo, all of the fractions were incubated with 0.05 mg/ml BSA at 37 °C for 24 h as the coating agents in ELISA. The semicarbazone derivative of the aldehydes was prepared as described previously (15Chen L.J. Hecht S.S. Peterson L.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1995; 8: 903-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The semicarbazone derivatives were analyzed by ultra performance liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. A 100-μl aliquot of the antigen solution was added to each well of a 96-well microtiter plate and incubated for 20 h at 4 °C. The antigen solution was then removed, and the plate was washed with PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 (PBS/Tween). Each well was incubated with 200 μl of 4% Blockace (Yukijirushi, Sapporo, Japan) in PBS/Tween for 60 min at 37 °C to block the unsaturated plastic surface. The plate was then washed three times with PBS/Tween. A 100-μl aliquot of a 1 × 103 dilution of serum was added to each well and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. After discarding the supernatants and washing three times with PBS/Tween, 100 μl of a 5 × 103 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase in PBS/Tween was added. After 1 h at 37 °C, the supernatant was discarded, and the plates were washed three times with PBS/Tween. The enzyme-linked antibody bound to the well was revealed by adding 100 μl/well of 1,2-phenylenediamine (0.5 mg/ml) in a 0.1 m citrate/phosphate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 0.003% hydrogen peroxide. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 2 m sulfuric acid (50 μl/well), and the absorbance at 490 nm was read using a micro-ELISA plate reader. Spleen cells from 14-week-old MRL-lpr mice were fused with P3/U1 murine myeloma cells and cultured in hypoxantine/aminopterin/thymidine selection medium. The culture supernatants of the hybridoma were screened using an ELISA, employing pairs of wells in microtiter plates on which were absorbed calf thymus DNA and ONE-treated BSA as antigens (0.5 μg of protein or DNA/well). After incubation with 100 μl of the hybridoma supernatants and with intervening washes with Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.8) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-Tween), the wells were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat antimouse IgG, followed by a substrate solution containing 1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Hybridoma cells, corresponding to the supernatants that were positive on either DNA or ONE-modified BSA and negative on native BSA, were then cloned by limited dilution. After repeated screenings, three clones showing the most distinctive recognition of DNA and two clones showing the most distinctive recognition of both ONE-modified BSAs were obtained. Immunogloblin variable region genes were cloned and sequenced following amplification by PCR. The total RNA was prepared from 5 × 106 hybridoma cells by the phenol-guanidine isothiocyanate method (TRIzol; Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The first strand cDNA synthesis was performed with recombinant Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Superscript II; Invitrogen) using the manufacturer's protocol. A 5-μg sample of the total RNA was primed with 10 pmol of random primers. Variable region genes were amplified using degenerate sense primers homologous to the mouse heavy and light chain leader sequences and antisense constant primers (Novagen), as described previously (16Antone S.M. Adderson E.E. Mertens N.M. Cunningham M.W. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5422-5430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amplification products were ligated into the pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega) using standard protocols, and both strands of inserts were sequenced using an automated dye chain termination DNA sequencer. The obtained sequences were analyzed using the DNASTAR software (DNASTAR, Madison, WI). The BLAST protocol was used to search the GenBankTM database to determine the homology with the V regions of other murine Abs that have been sequenced (17Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59759) Google Scholar). For light microscopy, kidney tissues were fixed and embedded in paraffin, and 4-μm sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. For immunofluorescence, paraffin sections fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde were stained with the Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated antibody against mouse IgG (Molecular Probes; Invitrogen). The images were digitally captured using a laser scanning confocal microscope and Pascal LSM software (LSM5 Pascal; Zeiss, Jena, Germany). The kidneys were thawed, minced, and homogenized in a high speed blender for 1 min in 4 volumes of cold PBS and then repeatedly washed in PBS. The washed homogenates were then incubated with 1 ml of glycine HCl buffer (20 mm, pH 3.0) at room temperature for 10 min and centrifuged at 1,500 rpm, and the pH of the supernatant was adjusted to pH 7.4. The eluates were dialyzed overnight against PBS at 4 °C. The samples were assessed for anti-DNA and anti-ONE titers. Jurkat cells were incubated in the complete culture medium with mAb DSO, anti-DNA mAb, or control murine IgG. At different time points, the cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. After extensive washing and treating with or without 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min, the cells were stained with the Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated antibody against mouse IgG for 1 h. Cell penetration was analyzed using a flow cytometer JSAN (Bay Bioscience, Kobe, Japan). A total of 10,000 events/sample were counted and analyzed. For confocal laser scanning microscopy, the cells were handled as above, and the nucleus was then stained with propidium iodide (160 nm) (Sigma) for 10 min after incubation with the Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-IgG. The images were digitally captured using a laser scanning confocal microscope and Pascal LSM software (LSM5 Pascal; Zeiss). These experiments were done to determine whether reactive products derived from peroxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids could modify protein and lead to the formation of autoantigenic epitopes recognized by the sera from MRL-lpr mice, a representative murine model of SLE, and from control MRL-MpJ mice. To this end, BSA was incubated with a polyunsaturated fatty acid (arachidonic acid or linoleic acid) in the presence of the Fe2+/ascorbate free radical-generating system and evaluated the formation of the autoantigenic epitopes. Strikingly, along with the progress in the peroxidation of linoleate, the protein showed a significant cross-reactivity with the sera from the MRL-lpr mice, whereas no cross-reactivity with the sera from the MRL-MpJ mice was observed (Fig. 1A). A similar increase in the cross-reactivity with the SLE sera was obtained when the protein was incubated with peroxidized arachidonate (Fig. 1B). Thus, the peroxidation of these polyunsaturated fatty acids is likely to generate product(s) that may have the ability to cause formation of autoantigenic epitopes that cross-react with the SLE sera. To define the lipid peroxidation product responsible for the formation of autoantigenic epitopes in the protein, we prepared the oxidized products by incubation of 13-hydroperoxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic acid with 125 μm Fe2+ and 0.5 mm ascorbic acid in 0.1 m HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 4 h. The diethyl ether extract of the reaction mixture was separated and fractionated every 2 min by reverse phase HPLC (Fig. 2A). The aliquots of each fraction were then incubated with BSA in 0.1 m HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 24 h and evaluated for its cross-reactivity with the sera from MRL-lpr mice. The ELISA analysis showed that the two fractions (fractions I and II), upon incubation with BSA, had a significant cross-reactivity with the autoantibodies. Because fraction I was expected to contain a major source of autoantigenic epitopes, we tried to isolate the product from fraction I. Using reverse phase HPLC on a phenethyl column, fraction I was further separated from other products, yielding the main product (product a) eluted from 16 to 18 min, which upon reaction with BSA formed autoantigenic epitopes cross-reactive with the SLE serum (Fig. 2B). After purification, the chemical structure of this product was characterized by NMR and ultra performance liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry analyses. The 1H NMR spectrum of product a showed the presence of an aldehydic proton at δ 9.73, two mutually coupled signals, and δ 6.97 (doublet) and δ 6.70 (double doublet) of the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde moiety. Moreover, the product has a carbonyl group; this was supported by the chemical shift in the methylene proton at δ 2.72. These data suggested the presence of a γ-keto-α,β-unsaturated aldehyde structure (Fig. 2C). The ultra performance liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry analysis of product a after semicarbazone derivatization showed that the product has a precursor ion at m/z 269 [M + H]+ and collision-induced dissociation on m/z 269, giving rise to peaks at m/z 209 [M - NHCONH2] and m/z 151 [M + 1 − 2(NHCONH2)]. Thus, the most likely structure of this product was 4-oxo-2-nonenal (ONE) (Fig. 2D), a recently identified aldehyde originating from the peroxidation of ω6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (18Rindgen D. Nakajima M. Wehrli S. Xu K. Blair I.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 1195-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 19Lee S.H. Blair I.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 698-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Indeed, the semicarbazone derivative of the authentic ONE gave the same fragmentation pattern as product a (supplemental Fig. S1). Furthermore, we observed that (i) ONE, upon incubation with BSA, generated autoantigenic epitopes that cross-reacted with the sera from MRL-lpr mice (Fig. 2E); and (ii) among several unsaturated aldehydes of chain lengths varying from three to nine carbons, the ONE-modified protein exclusively cross-reacted with the MRL-lpr mice sera (Fig. 2F). Thus, the active molecule generated from lipid peroxidation was identified to be ONE. Following the identification of ONE, the age-dependent change in the antibody titer against the ONE-specific epitopes was measured in the sera from the MRL-lpr mice and control MRL-MpJ mice. The control MRL-MpJ mice did not show any significant anti-DNA and anti-ONE titers. In contrast, the MRL-lpr mice displayed a spontaneous age-dependent elevation of the anti-DNA titer (Fig. 3A). Importantly, the mice also displayed a significant increase in the anti-ONE titers (Fig. 3B). Of note, the anti-DNA titer progressively increased up to the age of 18 weeks, whereas the anti-ONE response showed different kinetics; it peaked at the age of 10 weeks and then decreased. These data suggest that, although the details remain unknown, the anti-DNA and anti-ONE responses might be differentially regulated in the MRL-lpr mice. Glomerulonephritis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with SLE. The deposition of autoantibodies in the glomeruli plays a key role in the development of lupus nephritis. The MRL-lpr mice indeed had a moderate immunoglobulin deposition, mostly localized in the glomeruli, whereas no glomerular immunoglobulin deposition was present in the control MRL-MpJ mice (Fig. 3C). We also assessed the specificity of the antibody that deposited in glomeruli of the MRL-lpr mice and observed that the titers of the anti-ONE antibodies were significantly higher in the MRL-lpr mice than in the MRL-MpJ mice (Fig. 3D). These data suggest that the pathogenic autoantibodies recognize the ONE-specific epitopes as autoantigenic epitopes. Elevation of the anti-ONE titers was also observed in the autoimmune hemolytic anemia-prone New Zealand Black mice (supplemental Fig. S2). In addition, we observed enhanced anti-ONE antibody levels in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1)-deficient (SOD1−/−) mice and that the anti-ONE titer was significantly suppressed by the transgenic expression of SOD1 (supplemental Fig. S3). These data were consistent with our previous observations that the SOD1 deficiency causes anemia and autoimmune responses against red blood cells and that the transgenic expression of human SOD1 in erythroid cells rescues them (20Iuchi Y. Okada F. Takamiya R. Kibe N. Tsunoda S. Nakajima O. Toyoda K. Nagae R. Suematsu M. Soga T. Uchida K. Fujii J. Biochem. J. 2009; 422: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Moreover, we evaluated the presence of the anti-ONE antibodies in SLE patients and observed pronounced increases in them (supplemental Fig. S4). These data suggest that the antibody response against the ONE-specific epitopes may be an immunological characteristic common to various types of autoimmune diseases. Based on the observations that the MRL-lpr mice spontaneously developed the anti-DNA and the anti-ONE titers, we tried to isolate the hybridoma clones producing the antibodies specific for DNA and/or ONE-specific epitopes from the MRL-lpr mice and characterize their specificity in detail. Spleen cells from female MRL-lpr mice at 14 weeks of age were fused with P3/U1 murine myeloma cells, and after screening based on specific binding to the DNA, we established three hybridoma clones, DSO, A1116, and N1131, producing the antibodies specific for the DNA. Two of these cloned autoantibodies, DSO and A1116, were IgGs, whereas N1131 was an IgM. Strikingly, the anti-DNA antibodies produced from these hybridoma clones, DSO and A1116, cross-reacted not only with the single- and double-stranded DNA but also with the ONE-specific epitopes (Fig. 4A), suggesting that the anti-DNA IgGs originating from the MRL-lpr mice may have a common specificity toward the ONE-specific epitopes (Fig. 4B). In agreement with this hypothesis, hybridoma clones, LA6, LG1, and LA23, isolated from the MRL-lpr mice after screening based on the binding to the ONE-specific epitopes produced the anti-ONE mAbs that cross-reacted with the double-stranded DNA (supplemental Fig. S5). The VH and VL nucleotide sequences were determined for the dual-specific mAbs DSO and A1116 isolated from the MRL-lpr mice, and the identity of their V region genes was determined by searching the GenBankTM database for homologies to the known V region genes using the BLAST protocol (17Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59759) Google Scholar). To confirm that these mAbs represent the anti-DNA antibodies, the V region sequences were compared. A homology search revealed that the mAb DSO shared a high degree of sequence identity with the anti-DNA antibodies. The VH domain of the mAb DSO was almost identical, except their CDR3 regions (98–100% homology) to the mAbs 3D8 (anti-ssDNA/dsDNA), 202.80 (anti-ssDNA), F5–58 (anti-ssDNA/dsDNA), 202.s38 (anti-cardiolipin/ssDNA), and 2-12 (anti-Sm/anti-ssDNA) (Fig. 4C). In addition, the sequence identity of 89–99% for the VL domain of mAb DSO was shared with mAbs A1116, 11E6 (anti-nucleosome), F4-2 (anti-ssDNA), and BW2 19-19 (anti-DNA). Of interest, the presence of an arginine-arginine doublet, which may be responsible for anti-DNA reactivity (21Radic M.Z. Mackle J. Erikson J. Mol C. Anderson W.F. Weigert M. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 4966-4977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was noted in the hypervariable region of mAb DSO. The VH gene of A1116 also revealed a sequence similarity with the anti-DNA mAbs, ZB5G11 (anti-ssDNA), 1DC7 (anti-nuclear), 1DC10 (anti-nuclear), 11E6 (anti-nucleosome), and F4-2 (anti-ssDNA), whereas their identities were significantly lower (87–88% identity, except for CDR3 regions) than the identity of mAb DSO to the anti-DNA mAbs. One of the mechanisms proposed to explain the pathogenicity of the autoantibodies relies on their ability to either remain on the cell surface and participate in the complement-mediated cytotoxicity or be internalized to traverse the cytoplasm and localize to the nucleus (22Deshmukh U.S. Bagavant H. Fu S.M. Autoimmun. Rev. 2006; 5: 414-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To determine the penetration of the autoantibodies into live cells, Jurkat T cells were incubated with the dual-specific mAbs isolated from the MRL-lpr mice for the indicated times. The nonimmune control murine IgG was also used for comparison. After washing, fixation, and permeabilization, the intracellular mAb was stained with the Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated antibody against the mouse IgG and analyzed by flow cytometry. The dual-specific mAb DSO entered the cells in a very rap"
https://openalex.org/W2056526353,"Magic angle spinning solid-state NMR has been used to study the structural changes in the Pf1 filamentous bacteriophage, which occur near 10 °C. Comparisons of NMR spectra recorded above and below 10 °C reveal reversible perturbations in many NMR chemical shifts, most of which are assigned to atoms of hydrophobic side chains of the 46-residue subunit. The changes mainly involve groups located in patches on the interfaces between neighboring capsid subunits. The observations show that the transition adjusts the hydrophobic interfaces between fairly rigid subunits. The low temperature form has been generally more amenable to structure determination; spin diffusion experiments on this form revealed unambiguous contacts between side chains of neighboring subunits. These contacts are important constraints for structure modeling."
https://openalex.org/W2098286583,"Background It has recently been proposed that adult-born neurons in the olfactory bulb, whose survival is modulated by learning, support long-term olfactory memory. However, the mechanism used to select which adult-born neurons following learning will participate in the long-term retention of olfactory information is unknown. We addressed this question by investigating the effect of bulbar consolidation of olfactory learning on memory and neurogenesis. Methodology/Principal Findings Initially, we used a behavioral ecological approach using adult mice to assess the impact of consolidation on neurogenesis. Using learning paradigms in which consolidation time was varied, we showed that a spaced (across days), but not a massed (within day), learning paradigm increased survival of adult-born neurons and allowed long-term retention of the task. Subsequently, we used a pharmacological approach to block consolidation in the olfactory bulb, consisting in intrabulbar infusion of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin, and found impaired learning and no increase in neurogenesis, while basic olfactory processing and the basal rate of adult-born neuron survival remained unaffected. Taken together these data indicate that survival of adult-born neurons during learning depends on consolidation processes taking place in the olfactory bulb. Conclusion/Significance We can thus propose a model in which consolidation processes in the olfactory bulb determine both survival of adult-born neurons and long-term olfactory memory. The finding that adult-born neuron survival during olfactory learning is governed by consolidation in the olfactory bulb strongly argues in favor of a role for bulbar adult-born neurons in supporting olfactory memory."
https://openalex.org/W1990197755,"Double-stranded small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are important modulators of biological processes and hold great promise for therapeutic applications. However, serum processing of synthetic siRNAs is still largely unknown. To address this issue, serum degradation assays of 125 siRNAs were first performed in this study. Four siRNA categories of distinct serum stability were identified, including a group of siRNAs that were stable in their native form for both in vitro and in vivo assays. Fine mapping of the cleavage events occurring in serum treatment demonstrated that most occurred at two vulnerable sites, leading to a speculation that rational modification of these sites might protect most siRNAs from serum degradation. For proof of concept, an exhaustive siRNA modification study was performed. In addition to the consistent stabilization pattern revealed at these sites, our study further showed that a single modification made at the cleavage site stabilized the siRNAs to a large extent, highlighting the importance of these sites in siRNA degradation. In summary, the present study provided a comprehensive picture of serum processing of siRNA as well as a starting point for a rational siRNA modification strategy, both of which are of great importance to in vivo and therapeutic applications of siRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2044883507,"The human low affinity FcγRII family includes both the activating receptor FcγRIIA and the inhibitory receptor FcγRIIB2. These receptors have opposing signaling functions but are both capable of internalizing IgG-containing immune complexes through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We demonstrate that upon engagement by multivalent aggregated human IgG, FcγRIIA expressed in ts20 Chinese hamster fibroblasts is delivered along with its ligand to lysosomal compartments for degradation, while FcγRIIB2 dissociates from the ligand and is routed separately into the recycling pathway. FcγRIIA sorting to lysosomes requires receptor multimerization, but does not require either Src family kinase activity or ubiquitylation of receptor lysine residues. The sorting of FcγRIIB2 away from a degradative fate is not due to its lower affinity for IgG and occurs even upon persistent receptor aggregation. Upon co-engagement of FcγRIIA and FcγRIIB2, the receptors are sorted independently to distinct final fates after dissociation of co-clustering ligand. These results reveal fundamental differences in the trafficking behavior of different Fcγ receptors.

These results reveal fundamental differences in the trafficking behavior of different Fcγ receptors. Fcγ receptors (FcγR) 2The abbreviations used are: FcγRFcγ receptorITAMimmunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifITIMimmunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif. are key players in immune responses. Widely expressed on cells of the hematopoietic system, these receptors mediate a multitude of biological responses that are triggered upon receptor engagement by multivalent IgG-containing immune complexes (1Nimmerjahn F. Ravetch J.V. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (2095) Google Scholar). These responses include production of inflammatory cytokines, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and induction of dendritic cell maturation. FcγR also mediate the internalization of immune complexes. Soluble immune complexes are internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis whereas large (>0.5 μm) antibody-coated particles are internalized via phagocytosis. These uptake processes are important in host defense against infection; moreover, defects in immune complex clearance are associated with the development of autoimmunity (2Takai T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 580-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Fcγ receptor immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif. FcγRs can be categorized into two functional groups. The activating FcγR have an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) within the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor itself or an associated FcRγ signaling subunit. Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the ITAM by Src family kinases after receptor aggregation initiates signaling cascades that trigger downstream effector responses (3Daëron M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 203-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). In contrast, inhibitory FcγR contain an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), which recruits phosphatases that antagonize ITAM-mediated signaling. Therefore, the responsiveness of effector cells to immune complexes is determined by the balance between activating and inhibitory receptors (1Nimmerjahn F. Ravetch J.V. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (2095) Google Scholar). A feature of the human immune system that distinguishes it from that of mouse is the presence of both activating and inhibitory members of the low affinity FcγRII subfamily. FcγRIIA is an activating FcγR unique to humans and other primates, and is the most widely expressed FcγR on human leukocytes (4Tan Sardjono C. Mottram P.L. Hogarth P.M. Immunol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 81: 374-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition, FcγRIIA is unusual among activating FcγR in having both ligand binding and ITAM signaling domains contained in a single polypeptide chain. FcγRIIA exists as two codominantly expressed polymorphic variants, with either histidine or arginine at residue 131; the His-131 form has a higher affinity for several IgG subclasses (5Bruhns P. Iannascoli B. England P. Mancardi D.A. Fernandez N. Jorieux S. Daëron M. Blood. 2009; 113: 3716-3725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). FcγRIIA can mediate phagocytosis of large IgG-opsonized particles, which depends on ITAM-mediated signaling and rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton (6Indik Z. Kelly C. Chien P. Levinson A.I. Schreiber A.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1766-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). FcγRIIA is also able to mediate clathrin-dependent endocytosis of soluble IgG-containing immune complexes (7Budde P. Bewarder N. Weinrich V. Frey J. Eur J. Cell Biol. 1994; 64: 45-60PubMed Google Scholar, 8Mero P. Zhang C.Y. Huang Z.Y. Kim M.K. Schreiber A.D. Grinstein S. Booth J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33242-33249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Human leukocytes also express the inhibitory receptor FcγRIIB. Whereas the extracellular domains of FcγRIIA and FcγRIIB have 92% amino acid identity, their intracellular domains are divergent, with FcγRIIB containing an ITIM. Two different isoforms of FcγRIIB can be generated through alternative splicing. FcγRIIB1 is expressed mainly in B cells, where it inhibits signaling from the B cell receptor when the two receptors are coengaged by antigen-antibody complexes (9Ravetch J.V. Bolland S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 275-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar). FcγRIIB2 is expressed mainly in myeloid cells. Human FcγRIIB2 lacks the ability to support phagocytosis of IgG-opsonised large particles; on the contrary, it negatively regulates signaling for phagocytosis and other ITAM-dependent responses when coengaged with activating FcγR (10Hunter S. Indik Z.K. Kim M.K. Cauley M.D. Park J.G. Schreiber A.D. Blood. 1998; 91: 1762-1768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FcγRIIB2 is, however, able to mediate endocytosis of soluble immune complexes because of the presence of a di-leucine motif in its cytoplasmic domain (11Hunziker W. Fumey C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2963-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 12Matter K. Yamamoto E.M. Mellman I. J. Cell.

Immunol. 1994; 152: 574-585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As both of these receptors can mediate immune complex uptake, we sought to investigate how they traffic within the cell after such internalization. This is important for understanding both the overall regulation of inflammatory signaling as well as the processing of immune complexes internalized via FcγR. We demonstrate that, in addition to their opposing effects on cell activation, FcγRIIA and FcγRIIB2 exhibit divergent trafficking behavior after internalization, with FcγRIIA, but not FcγRIIB2, being targeted for degradation. Fetal bovine serum, α-minimal essential medium, and G418 were from Wisent (St. Bruno, Quebec, Canada). Mouse anti-Myc antibody 9E10 was from Covance (Berkeley, CA). Anti-FcγRIIA antibody IV.3 was purified from hybridoma supernatants and Fab fragments were prepared using a Pierce ImmunoPure Fab Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL). Anti-FcγRII antibody AT10 was from Abcam. Anti-hamster LAMP1 antibody UH1 was from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (University of Iowa). Cy3-, Cy5-, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories. Alexa488-conjugated secondary antibodies, Alexa488-transferrin and Rhodamine-transferrin were from Molecular Probes. Paraformaldehyde was from Canemco (16%, EM grade). PP1 was from Biomol. GM-CSF and cycloheximide were from Bioshop (Burlington, Ontario, Canada). Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate, Restore It stripping buffer, and Ultralink protein G beads were from Pierce. Human IgG, protease inhibitors, anti-β actin antibody, and other chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich. ts20 cells were grown at 34 °C and 5% CO2 in α-minimal essential medium +10% fetal bovine serum. For preparation of human monocyte-derived macrophages, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from blood of healthy donors by Ficoll-Paque Plus (GE Healthcare) density centrifugation, followed by isolation of monocytes by adherence to tissue culture plastic. Cells were then cultured for 6 days in RPMI+10% fetal bovine serum with GM-CSF (1000 units/ml). cDNAs for wild-type or mutated forms of FcγRIIA (His131 variant) and FcγRIIB2 were cloned into pcDNA3.1/Myc-His or pcDNA3.1/His (Invitrogen) for expression with C-terminal Myc-His or His tags. Chimeric FcγRIIA/FcγRIIB2 Myc-His-tagged receptors were generated by PCR amplification of receptor sequences from GFP-tagged chimeric receptors (14Syam S. Mero P. Pham T. McIntosh C.A. Bruhns P. Booth J.W. J. Immunol. 2010; 184: 2966-2973Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and cloning into pcDNA3.1/Myc-His. Transfections were performed with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Stable cell lines expressing FcγRIIA, FcγRIIB2 and mutant receptors were selected with G418 (0.5 mg/ml). For treatment of cells with inhibitors, cells were pretreated for 30 min by addition of the inhibitor directly to the culture medium at 30 μm (PP1) or 300 nm (bafilomycin). The intracellular domains of human FcγRIIA (residues 251–316) or FcγRIIB2 (residues 255–290) were individually cloned into the pGEX-3X vector to express the domains as fusion proteins to glutathione S-transferase (GST). The GST-tagged proteins were expressed in BL21 bacteria, purified on GST-agarose and used for immunization of New Zealand White rabbits (Division of Comparative Medicine, University of Toronto). Anti-GST antibodies were removed from antisera using GST-agarose. Human IgG (10 mg/ml) was aggregated at 62 °C for 20 min followed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min to precipitate insoluble IgG aggregates; supernatants containing soluble aggregates were used at 1:100 dilution to induce endocytosis. In experiments where endocytosis was triggered with anti-receptor antibodies, IV.3 (anti-FcγRIIA) or AT10 (pan anti-FcγRII) were added to transfected ts20 cells at 0.5 μg/ml for 20 min at 4 °C. After washing, cells were incubated for 20 min at 4 °C with 1 μg/ml Cy5-donkey anti-mouse antibody to cross-link the receptors, followed by warming to 34 °C to trigger endocytosis. In some experiments where subsequent immunofluoresence was performed using mouse antibodies, isotype-specific secondary antibodies were employed. For transferrin loading, rhodamine- or Alexa488-conjugated transferrin was added at 50 μg/ml for the last 10 min of incubation. For dextran loading, Alexa647-conjugated dextran was added at 50 μg/ml for 1 h followed by a chase for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 20 min. To detect FcγR, cells were blocked with 5% BSA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with anti-Myc antibody 9E10 or anti-FcγRIIB2 antibody at 1:1000 dilution in blocking buffer for one hour. For LAMP1 immunofluorescence, cells were permeabilized with methanol at −20 °C for 20 min followed by blocking with 5% BSA and treatment with UH1 antibody at 1:1 dilution. Samples were then treated with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies at 0.8 μg/ml in PBS for 30 min before mounting cells with DAKO mounting medium for microscopy analysis. AgIgG was detected with fluorophore-conjugated anti-human secondary antibody. Cells were analyzed using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 m microscope with 40× or 100× objectives or a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal scanning microscope with a 63× objective. Alexa488, Cy3, and Cy5 signals were detected using standard filter sets. ts20 cells expressing Myc-His-tagged FcγRIIA or FcRIIB2 were detached from culture dishes and dispersed in PBS. Following fixation with 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100, cells were blocked with 5% BSA and stained with anti-Myc antibody 9E10 at 1:1000 dilution in blocking buffer for 30 min at room temperature. After washing, cells were stained with Alexa488-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (0.8 μg/ml for 15 min) and analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson). The background fluorescence observed with 9E10-stained untransfected ts20 cells was subtracted from the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values. For detection of aggregated IgG, cells were stained with 1.5 μg/ml Cy5-anti-human secondary antibody, and background fluorescence observed with untransfected ts20 cells was subtracted. ts20 or THP-1 cells were lysed in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mm NaF, 0.1% protease inhibitor mixture in PBS). Lysates were incubated on ice for 20 min, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and lysates were frozen for future analysis. For immunoprecipitations, 1 μg of IV.3 antibody and 25 μl of protein G beads were mixed with cell lysates followed by overnight nutation at 4 °C. After washing beads two times with lysis buffer and two times with PBS-T (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20), beads were resuspended in Laemmli's sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad), blocked with 5% BSA in PBS-T for 1 h at room temperature and probed with primary antibody at 1:1000 dilution in blocking buffer overnight. Blots were washed in PBS-T three times, incubated with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase for 30 min, washed again, and developed with Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). A Genius2 Bioimager (Syngene) was used to visualize the blots. To better understand how these two Fcγ receptors traffic, FcγRIIA or FcγRIIB2 carrying Myc-His tags were stably transfected into ts20 cells, a Chinese hamster fibroblast cell line. This heterologous expression system allows us to study the trafficking behavior of a single class of FcγR either in its wild type or mutated forms (8Mero P. Zhang C.Y. Huang Z.Y. Kim M.K.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Soluble complexes of heat aggregated IgG (agIgG), a mimic of soluble multivalent immune complexes, were used to trigger endocytosis of either FcγRIIA or FcγRIIB2. Both receptors mediated uptake of agIgG (Fig. 1, B and E), and by 80 min the agIgG was delivered to late endosomal/lysosomal compartments, as indicated by its co-localization with LAMP1 (Fig. 1, A–F). No significant uptake of agIgG was observed in untransfected cells (data not shown). Consistent with the observed delivery to lysosomes, agIgG internalized via either receptor underwent degradation (Fig. 1G). Whereas agIgG ligand internalized by either FcγRIIA or FcγRIIB2 underwent similar degradation, a second important question is the fate of the receptors themselves. To address this, immunoblotting was performed to determine the amount of receptors remaining in cells after stimulation with agIgG. For FcγRIIA, receptor levels declined after induction of endocytosis, such that by 5 h after addition of agIgG very little FcγRIIA remained (Fig. 2A). In contrast, no drop in FcγRIIB2 levels was observed over the same time frame (Fig. 2A). The total amounts of FcγRIIA and FcγRIIB2 were also quantified by flow cytometry using intracellular staining with anti-myc antibody, which similarly showed loss of FcγRIIA but not FcγRIIB2 (Fig. 2, B and C and supplemental Fig. S1A). No drop in FcγRIIB2 level was observed after agIgG stimulation even in the presence of cycloheximide, indicating that the persistence of FcγRIIB2 following endocytosis is not due to new protein synthesis (data not shown). The loss of FcγRIIA after endocytosis was also analyzed in THP-1 cells, a human monocytic cell line that expresses endogenous FcγRIIA. As in the ts20 transfectants, FcγRIIA largely disappeared within 3 h of treatment with agIgG (Fig. 2D). This loss was inhibited by treatment with bafilomycin, indicating that degradation occurs in the endolysosomal system. To characterize the subcellular localization of FcγRIIA and FcγRIIB2 after endocytosis, the tagged receptors were detected by immunofluorescence. Under unstimulated conditions, both FcγRIIA and FcγRIIB2 were observed to reside on the cell surface and in diffuse perinuclear vesicles (Fig. 3, A and J). This intracellular compartment is a recycling endosome pool, as judged by its co-localization with loaded transferrin (Fig. 3, A–C, J–L). After 80 min of agIgG treatment, FcγRIIA was largely co-localized with internalized agIgG ligand, which, as noted above (Fig. 1), has moved by this time into punctate perinuclear lysosomes (Fig. 3, G–I). These puncta, while located in the central region of the cell like the transferrin-positive recycling endosomes, are adjacent to these endosomes rather than co-localized with them (Fig. 3, D–F). Thus, consistent with the observed receptor degradation, FcγRIIA is targeted to lysosomes along with its ligand. In contrast, at the same time point after agIgG addition, FcγRIIB2 showed a localization similar to that seen in unstimulated cells, namely, it was found at the cell surface and in transferrin-positive endosomes (Fig. 3, M–O), and did not follow internalized agIgG to lysosomes (Fig. 3, P–R), consistent with the observed lack of FcγRIIB2 degradation. Thus, FcγRIIB2 is sorted to recycling endosomes while agIgG ligand internalized via this receptor is degraded in lysosomes. Although the extracellular domains of FcγRIIA and FcγRIIB2 are highly similar, the affinities of the His-131 form of FcγRIIA for IgG1, IgG2, and IgG3 are severalfold higher than those of FcγRIIB2 (5Bruhns P. Iannascoli B. England P. Mancardi D.A. Fernandez N. Jorieux S. Daëron M. Blood. 2009; 113: 3716-3725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar, 16Maenaka K. van der Merwe P.A. Stuart D.I. Jones E.Y. Sondermann P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44898-44904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The divergent localization of FcγRIIB2 and agIgG at later times after endocytosis (Fig. 3, P–R) implies that the agIgG dissociates from the receptor after internalization. Thus, one possible determinant of the differential sorting of FcγRIIB2 and FcγRIIA could be a difference in release of ligand due to their differing extracellular domains. To address this possibility, chimeric receptors were generated in which the extracellular domain of FcγRIIA was fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of FcγRIIB2 (“IIA-IIB2”) or vice versa (“IIB2-IIA”). Western blotting was performed at different time points after induction of agIgG endocytosis in cells expressing these receptors. As shown in Fig. 4, the chimeric receptor with FcγRIIA extracellular domain and FcγRIIB2 intracellular domain (IIA-IIB2) showed no obvious drop in receptor level after agIgG internalization, while conversely the chimeric receptor with FcγRIIB2 extracellular domain and FcγRIIA intracellular domain (IIB2-IIA) was degraded. Thus, the differential sorting of these receptors following endocytosis is presumably due to their divergent cytoplasmic domains. Whereas a difference in affinity for IgG apparently does not explain the difference between FcγRIIA and FcγRIIB2 sorting, the question nonetheless remains whether release from clustering ligand is necessary for sorting of the low affinity FcγRIIB2 away from a degradative fate, since persistence of ligand binding is thought to be an important factor determining lysosomal sorting of receptors (17Longva K.E. Blystad F.D. Stang E. Larsen A.M. Johannessen L.E. Madshus I.H. J. Cell. Biol. 2002; 156: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). To address this question, we attempted to induce a more persistent clustering of FcγRIIB2 by engaging it with anti-FcγRII antibody AT10 followed by cross-linking receptors with secondary antibody, rather than through the low affinity binding of multivalent agIgG. When FcγRIIB2-expressing cells were incubated with AT10 alone (with no secondary antibody), the AT10 was delivered to transferrin-positive endosomes, suggesting that either there is constitutive cycling of FcγRIIB2 between cell surface and recycling endosomes in the unclustered state or that dimerization of receptors by bivalent antibody is sufficient to trigger such cycling (Fig. 5, A–D). Upon clustering receptors with AT10 and secondary antibody, in contrast to the release of ligand that occurs with agIgG, AT10-antibody complexes remained co-localized with the receptors, presumably due to their binding through a higher affinity interaction. Moreover, both FcγRIIB2 and the AT10 complexes were directed to recycling endosomes (Fig. 5, E–H). Consistent with this localization, neither FcγRIIB2 nor AT10 antibody complexes were degraded, in contrast to the case for FcγRIIA similarly engaged with AT10 and secondary antibody (supplemental Fig. S2). Thus, even under conditions of persistent oligomerization, FcγRIIB2 avoids a degradative fate. Of note, when FcγRIIA-expressing cells were incubated with Fab fragments of the anti-FcγRIIA antibody IV.3 and chased at 34 °C, the Fab was internalized to transferrin-positive endosomes, suggesting that constitutive cycling of FcγRIIA can occur in the absence of clustering (Fig. 5, J–L). In contrast, when whole IV.3 antibodies were used, FcγRIIA was sorted away from transferrin-positive recycling endosomes (Fig. 5, M–P) and showed localization in LAMP1-positive lysosomes (Fig. 5, Q–S). Similar results were obtained using whole AT10 (data not shown). Thus, dimerization of FcγRIIA by bivalent antibodies (or possibly trimerization through additional engagement of the Fc region) appears to be sufficient to drive this sorting event. With whole IV.3 followed by cross-linking with secondary antibody, robust delivery of FcγRIIA to lysosomes was seen (Fig. 5, T–V). To recapitulate these findings in primary human cells, monocyte-derived macrophages were used. FcγRIIA was engaged with IV.3 with or without secondary antibody cross-linking. Cells were preloaded with fluorescent dextran to label the lysosomal compartment. At early times after engagement, IV.3 or IV.3 complexes were internalized into peripheral early endosomes that were positive for EEA1 (data not shown) and negative for dextran (Fig. 6, A–C, G–I). By 60 min post-internalization, both IV.3 alone and IV.3-secondary antibody complexes moved into central lysosomes (Fig. 6, D–F, J–L). Our results with chimeric receptors indicate that it is most likely the divergent intracellular domains of FcγRIIA and FcγRIIB2 that dictate their divergent sorting. The intracellular domain of FcγRIIA contains an ITAM that is phosphorylated by Src family kinases to induce downstream signaling cascades (3Daëron M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 203-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that FcγRIIA engagement in transfected ts20 cells leads to receptor phosphorylation, and that both phosphorylation of FcγRIIA and phagocytosis driven by this receptor are inhibited by the Src family kinase inhibitor PP1 (8Mero P. Zhang C.Y. Huang Z.Y. Kim M.K. Schreiber A.D. Grinstein S. Booth J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33242-33249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Here, we tested the effect of PP1 on FcγRIIA intracellular sorting. While degradation was blocked by bafilomycin treatment, PP1 did not prevent agIgG-induced FcγRIIA degradation (Fig. 7, A and B), indicating that Src family kinase-mediated receptor tyrosine phosphorylation is not essential to direct FcγRIIA to lysosomes. Ubiquitylation of surface receptors can function both to trigger endocytosis and as a sorting signal driving their delivery to lysosomes (18Katzmann D.J. Odorizzi G. Emr S.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 893-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 19Staub O. Rotin D. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 669-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 20Stang E. Blystad F.D. Kazazic M. Bertelsen V. Brodahl T. Raiborg C. Stenmark H. Madshus I.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3591-3604Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). FcγRIIA is ubiquitylated upon engagement by immune complexes and an active ubiquitylation machinery is required for receptor endocytosis (8Mero P. Zhang C.Y. Huang Z.Y. Kim M.K. Schreiber A.D. Grinstein S. Booth J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33242-33249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 15Booth J.W. Kim M.K. Jankowski A. Schreiber A.D. Grinstein S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that receptor ubiquitylation may also account for its lysosomal sorting. The intracellular domain of FcγRIIA contains five lysine residues that can serve as potential ubiquitylation sites. We assessed the degradation of a mutated version of FcγRIIA in which all five lysine residues were mutated to arginine (IIA-5KR). ts20 cells expressing either wild-type FcγRIIA or IIA-5KR were treated with IV.3 and cross-linking secondary antibody to trigger endocytosis. Antibody complexes internalized by either wild-type FcγRIIA or IIA-5KR were both delivered to LAMP1-positive lysosomes (Fig. 8, A–F). Moreover, the lack of lysines does not prevent FcγRIIA degradation (Fig. 8G), indicating that direct ubiquitylation of lysines in FcγRIIA is not essential for its degradation, and suggesting that other sorting signals in the cytoplasmic domain of FcγRIIA are involved in this step of its trafficking. Our heterologous transfection model has the advantage of allowing the analysis of the intracellular trafficking capabilities of FcγRIIA and FcγRIIB2 in isolation. However, in cells expressing both FcγRIIA and FcγRIIB2, both receptors would be expected to be simultaneously co-engaged by multivalent immune complexes. If FcγRIIA and FcγRIIB2 carry different sorting signals, what is the result of such receptor co-engagement? On the one hand, FcγRIIA might have a dominant effect, pulling FcγRIIB2 toward lysosomal degradation. Conversely, co-engaged FcγRIIB2 might reroute FcγRIIA away from such a fate. A third possibility is that dissociation of immune complexes from the receptors allows them to sort to their respective fates independently of each other. To address this question, ts20 cells stably expressing Myc-His-tagged FcγRIIA were transiently transfected with untagged FcγRIIB2. AgIgG was added to these cells to co-engage FcγRIIA and FcγRIIB2 and the subcellular localization of FcγRIIA, FcγRIIB2, and agIgG were determined by immunofluorescence (Fig. 9, A–H). After 10 min of agIgG stimulation, FcγRIIA and FcγRIIB2 both co-localized with agIgG in dispersed peripheral endosomes (Fig. 9, A–D). However, by 90 min after agIgG stimulation, FcγRIIA and agIgG were colocalized in central puncta but FcγRIIB2 showed a distinct localization in a diffuse central endosomal pool, as was seen with individually expressed receptors (Fig. 9, E–H). As an alternative approach, the effect of co-engagement on receptor degradation was assessed by transiently overexpressing FcγRIIB2 in cells that stably express FcγRIIA, or vice versa, and measuring degradation of the stably expressed receptor by flow cytometry (Fig. 9, I and J). Expression of cotransfected GFP was used as a measure of transient receptor expression (Fig. 9, I and J and supplemental Fig. S1, B–D). FcγRIIA was still degraded in cells expressing a range of levels of FcγRIIB2 (Fig. 9I), and conversely there was no obvious degradation of FcγRIIB2 in cells expressing a range of levels of FcγRIIA (Fig. 9J). Thus, our results suggest that dissociation of FcγRII from immune complexes after internalization allows independent sorting of FcγRIIA and FcγRIIB2 receptors to distinct final fates. In this study, we have directly compared the intracellular trafficking of FcγRIIA and FcγRIIB2. Our results demonstrate that in addition to their opposing signaling functions, they have very different trafficking behaviors. Degradation of the activating receptor after its internalization may serve as a mechanism for ensuring appropriate termination of inflammatory signaling after initial encounter with immune complexes. In contrast, persistence of FcγRIIB2 may help to maintain the ability of myeloid"

Inclusion of mycobacterial single strand DNA-binding protein (SSB) in reactions containing linear plasmid dsDNA allowed us to study the AdnAB helicase under conditions in which the unwound single strands are coated by SSB and thereby prevented from reannealing or promoting ongoing ATP hydrolysis. We found that the AdnAB motor catalyzed processive unwinding of 2.7–11.2-kbp linear duplex DNAs at a rate of ∼250 bp s−1, while hydrolyzing ∼5 ATPs per bp unwound. Crippling the AdnA phosphohydrolase active site did not affect the rate of unwinding but lowered energy consumption slightly, to ∼4.2 ATPs bp−1. Mutation of the AdnB phosphohydrolase abolished duplex unwinding, consistent with a model in which the “leading” AdnB motor propagates a Y-fork by translocation along the 3′ DNA strand, ahead of the “lagging” AdnA motor domain. By tracking the resection of the 5′ and 3′ strands at the DSB ends, we illuminated a division of labor among the AdnA and AdnB nuclease modules during dsDNA unwinding, whereby the AdnA nuclease processes the unwound 5′ strand to liberate a short oligonucleotide product, and the AdnB nuclease incises the 3′ strand on which the motor translocates.

https://openalex.org/W2058783125,"Cot/tpl2 (also known as MAP3K8) has emerged as a new and potentially interesting therapeutic anti-inflammatory target. Here, we report the first study of Cot/tpl2 involvement in acute peripheral inflammation in vivo. Six hours after an intraplantar injection of zymosan, Cot/tpl2(-/-) mice showed a 47% reduction in myeloperoxidase activity, concomitant with a 46% lower neutrophil recruitment and a 40% decreased luminol-mediated bioluminescence imaging in vivo. Accordingly, Cot/tpl2 deficiency provoked a 25-30% reduction in luminol-mediated bioluminescence and neutrophil recruitment together with a 65% lower macrophage recruitment 4 h following zymosan-induced peritonitis. Significantly impaired levels of G-CSF and GM-CSF and of other cytokines such as TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6, as well as some chemokines such as MCP-1, MIP-1β, and keratinocyte-derived chemokine, were detected during the acute zymosan-induced intraplantar inflammatory response in Cot/tpl2(-/-) mice. Moreover, Cot/tpl2 deficiency dramatically decreased the production of the hypernociceptive ligand NGF at the inflammatory site during the course of inflammation. Most importantly, Cot/tpl2 deficiency significantly reduced zymosan-induced inflammatory hypernociception in mice, with a most pronounced effect of a 50% decrease compared with wild type (WT) at 24 h following intraplantar injection of zymosan. At this time, Cot/tpl2(-/-) mice showed significantly reduced NGF, TNFα, and prostaglandin E(2) levels compared with WT littermates. In conclusion, our study demonstrates an important role of Cot/tpl2 in the NGF, G-CSF, and GM-CSF production and myeloperoxidase activity in the acute inflammatory response process and its implication in inflammatory hypernociception."

In the present study, we analyzed primary and conventional gastric epithelial cell lines to establish an optimal in vitro mouse model system for the examination of H. pylori-induced overexpression of Ctsx in a functional way. Gastric epithelial cells were isolated from stomachs of wild-type C57BL6/N and Ctsx−/− mice and compared with the gastric cancer cell line CLS103. Indirect co-cultures of epithelial cells and macrophages were infected with H. pylori strain SS1 and analyzed for the expression of cathepsins, cytokines, and adhesion factors. Cellular interactions, migration capability, and adherence of H. pylori were assessed using time-lapse video microscopy and colony-forming assays. Isolated primary cells from wild-type and transgenic mice revealed qualities and expression profiles similar to those of corresponding tissue samples. Adherence of H. pylori was significantly higher in primary compared with commercially cells. Thus, induction of cathepsins, cytokines, and adhesion proteins was detected solely in primary cells and co-cultured macrophages. Microarray and migration experiments indicated that Ctsx is involved in B/T-cell proliferation/migration and adhesion of macrophages. Primary epithelial cells from stomach of Ctsx−/− mice represent an excellent model of H. pylori gastritis to elaborate the special functions of Ctsx in regulating the immune response to H. pylori.

Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative bacterium, which colonizes the stomach (1Blaser M.J. Atherton J.C. J. Clin.

H. pylori is widespread throughout the world and is colonized in more than half of the world's population (4Graham D.Y. Adam E. Reddy G.T. Agarwal J.P. Agarwal R. Evans Jr., D.J. Malaty H.M.

For the majority of infected persons, however, the H. pylori-induced gastric inflammation remains undiscovered (5Dooley C.P. Cohen H. Fitzgibbons P.L. Bauer M. Appleman M.D. Perez-Perez G.I.

Otherwise, infection with H. pylori can be associated with the development of chronic gastritis, gastric adenocarcinoma (6Forman D. Newell D.G. Fullerton F. Yarnell J.W.G. Stacey A.R. Wald N.

In contrast to CTSB, -L, and -K, only CTSX is strongly expressed in H. pylori-infected gastric mucosa and has also been found to be up-regulated in intestinal-type gastric cancer (12Krueger S.

Its expression is restricted primarily to cells of the immune system, such as monocytes, macrophages, or dentritic cells. Up-regulation in gastric cancer was also due to different expressions in neoplastic epithelium. The physiological function of CTSX still needs to be clarified. Obermajer et al. (15Obermajer N. Magister S. Kopitar A.N. Tepes B. Ihan A. Kos J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 88: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) focused on a potential function of CTSX in regulating immune response by activation of Mac-1 and lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) β2 integrins, resulting in increased adhesion and phagocytosis of macrophages, as well as in maturation of dendritic cells. Furthermore, CTSX has been shown to bind to cell surface heparin sulfate proteoglycans (16Nascimento F.D. Rizzi C.C. Nantes I.L. Stefe I. Turk B. Carmona A.K. Nader H.B. Juliano L. Tersariol I.L.

CTSX expression was found to be regulated by different cell-type-dependent pathways and stimulants. Up-regulation of CTSX expression in NCI-N87 epithelial cells has been found to be independent of infections with cagA+ H. pylori strains in vitro, but fine membrane localization in surface epithelial cells could be recognized only in CagA+ biopsies in vivo. Furthermore, induction involves activation of JNK and p38 signaling pathways, as well as IL-1β and IL-6. In contrast, up-regulation of CTSX in monocytes has been shown to be dependent on the translocation of CagA in corresponding epithelial cells in vitro and was regulated through activation of MEK1/2 signaling, as well as TNF-α and IL-8 (12Krueger S.

All experiments conducted by us so far analyzed CTSX expression and regulation in H. pylori-infected gastric mucosa, were done on gastric cancer cell lines (AGS, NCI-N87) and/or commercially available monocytic cells (THP-1) of human origin. Sequencially Krueger et al. (20Krueger S. Hundertmark T. Kuester D. Kalinski T. Peitz U. Roessner A. Pathol Res.

In addition to cell culture studies, several groups investigate H. pylori infections in mouse or gerbil models (21Marchetti M. Aricò B. Burroni D. Figura N. Rappuoli R. Ghiara P. Science. 1995; 267: 1655-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), but the expression or functional studies of cathepsins have not yet been subject in this research. Sevenich et al. (22Sevenich L. Schurigt U. Sachse K. Gajda M. Werner F. Müller S. Vasiljeva O. Schwinde A. Klemm N. Deussing J. Peters C. Reinheckel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In the present study, we used primary mouse gastric epithelial cells from WT and Ctsx−/− mice, as well as the murine gastric carcinoma cell line CLS 103 and a mouse macrophage cell line J-774A.1, to analyze the influence of loss of Ctsx during H. pylori infection on the expression of cytokines, chemokines, and genes involved in T- and B-cell activation as well as proliferation and differentiation. Moreover, we compared Ctsx-expressing and -nonexpressing epithelial cells for their ability to interact with macrophages and to initiate their migration. Mice with deficiencies in cathepsin B (mutant allele Ctsbtm1Jde, designated here as Ctsb−/−) and cathepsin X (mutant allele Ctsztm1Thre; designated here as Ctsx−/−) were generated by gene targeting in mouse embryonic stem cells as described (22Sevenich L.

The animals were housed in a 12:12 light/dark cycle with unconditional access to water and food. They are kept in specific pathogen-free facilities. In addition, stomachs from specific pathogen-free WT, Ctsx−/−, and Ctsb−/− mice were analyzed to be negative for H. pylori in routine tests. The H. pylori strain SS1 (Sydney strain 1), a mouse-adapted strain, was cultured in thin layers on 10% horse serum agar plates supplemented with vancomycin (10 μg/ml), trimethoprim (5 μg/ml), and nystatin (1 μg/ml) and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C in an anaerobic jar containing a CampyGen gas mix of 5% O2, 10% CO2, and 85% N2 (Oxoid, Wesel, Germany) as reported previously (20Krueger S. Hundertmark T. Kuester D. Kalinski T. Peitz U. Roessner A. Pathol Res. Pract. 2007; 203: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). All antibiotics were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Deisenhofen, Germany). The H. pylori strain SS1 was provided by Professor Steffen Backert (School of Biomolecular & Biomedical Science, University College Dublin). For the infection, bacteria were harvested in PBS, pH 7.4, and added to the serum-starved cells at a multiplicity of infection of 50. For the isolation of primary gastric epithelial cells, uninfected WT, Ctsx−/−, and Ctsb−/− mice were sacrificed at 12 to 20 weeks, stomachs were removed and immediately cleaned in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen). The stomachs were cut into small pieces (1–2 mm2) and incubated by stirring constantly in 25 ml collagenase (Sigma)/dispase (Invitrogen) solution (12,000 units of collagenase I, 125 units of dispase, 125 mg BSA per 100 ml Quantum 286) for 2 h at 37 °C. Six-well plates were precoated with 1 ml MatrigelTM (5 μl/ml; BD Biosciences) and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h to allow polymerization of MatrigelTM. After pelleting dispersed cells and washing with PBS (PAA, Linz, Austria), the cells were resuspended in epithelial cell culture medium Quantum 286 (PAA) supplemented with gentamycin (10 μg/ml), penicillin/streptomycin (5 μg/ml, Invitrogen) and seeded into Matrigel-coated six-well-plates (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) containing Quantum 286 medium (PAA) with antibiotics penicillin/streptomycin/gentamycin (Invitrogen) and incubated at 37 °C for at least 24 h. Cell purity was examined using light microscopy. Cells were classified as epithelial cells (cobblestone morphology), fibroblasts (spindle-shaped morphology), or unclassified (rounded cells of undetermined origin). Due to the Matrigel coating, the percentage of fibroblast and unclassified cells could be reduced to 2.7 + 0.7% and 0.2 + 0.1%, respectively. 97.1 + 8.2% of cells exhibited cobblestone morphology and grew in clusters. The murine gastric carcinoma cell line CLS 103 was obtained from CLS (Heidelberg, Germany). The cell line was grown in six-well plates (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) for 2 days. Each well contained 2 ml of RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin) and 10% FCS (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). The mouse macrophage cell line J-774A.1 is active in antibody-dependent phagocytosis and was also received from CLS. The cell line was cultured in high glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin, 10 mg/ml) and incubated at 37 °C under standard conditions of 5% CO2. For co-culture experiments, mouse gastric epithelial cells were seeded on the upper part of 0.4 μm trans-well chambers (Corning-Costar), infected with the H. pylori strain SS1 and co-cultured with J-774A.1 in the lower compartment of chambers. For infection, incubation medium was removed and replaced by medium without antibiotics. Uninfected cells were used as controls. Epithelial cells were plated in 6-cm tissue culture plates at 5 × 105 cells per plate and allowed to grow for 24 h to subconfluency. H. pylori SS1 was added to cells at an multiplicity of infection of 50. Infected cultures were washed after 4 h three times with PBS (pH 7.6) to remove nonadherent bacteria, and total cell lysates were harvested after 15 min of incubation with PBS/0.2% saponin. Serial 10-fold dilutions of cell extracts were cultured on 10% horse serum agar plates as described above and were incubated for 3 to 5 days under microaerobic conditions. Assays were performed on the LightCyclerTM (Roche Diagnostics). Several dilutions of plasmids containing the cDNA fragments of the different genes were used as internal controls. For plasmid construction, the cDNA fragments were amplified using the following primers: mCtsx, mCtsb, mCtsl, mIL-1β, mCxcl1, mMCP-1, and mIL-6. The sequences of all PCR primers with their optimal annealing temperature are listed in Table 1. The same primers were used for qPCR reactions. PCR products were inserted into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The copy number of the resulting plasmids was calculated after DNA quantification.TABLE 1Sequences of PCR primers, length of PCR products, and optimal annealing temperature for the indicated mouse genesPrimerSenseAntisenseTemplateAnnealingbp° CActinGTGCTGTCCCTGTATGCCTCTGAACCGCTCGTTGCCAATAGTG34955CtsxCCTGTCCGGGAGGGAGAATGGTTGATAACGGCCTGGTC13755CtsbTGCGTTCGGTGAGGACATAGAGGACGGGAGCCATTGACAT37154CtslGGAGATGAACGCCTTTGGTGTTACAGCCCTGATTGCCTTGA31154IL-1βCAACCAACAAGTGATATTCTCCATGGATCCAACATCTCCAGCTGCA44657Cxcl1GCACCCAAACCGAAGTCATAGCTTGTCAGAAGCCAGCGTTCACC17460MCP-1GCTCTCTCTTCCTCCACCACCATGCTCTCCAGCCTACTCATTGGGAT17060IL-6CACAAAGCCAGAGTCCTTCAGAGACTAGGTTTGCCGAGTAGATCTC22652CD81AATCCAAGCZCCGCAGGCCGGGCCCCATAGCACCCCAGGA27860Cdkn1aAACGCGCTCCCAGACGAAGTGCGATATCCAGACATTCAGAGCCACA26860PrkcdTGCCCTGGTTTGCACCGCATGGTCAACACATCACCAGTCTCCTACA29460GlmnGTGCTGGAAGCCCGGGTACTTGGAGGCATCGAACAACTGGACCAA29860IL-18TGGCCCAGGAACAATGGCTGCTGGTCTGGGGTTCACTGGCACT25160Spp1GCCACATGGCTGGTGCCTGACGGCCGTTGGGGACATCGAC31460Ap3b1TGAGCCTGCGCCCAGAAACGGTGGGCGGCCAGTCCTTTCC28660Gadd45gGCGTCAGGATCGCCTCACCGGTGCAGGTCTCGGGCTTCGG26260 Open table in a new tab Twenty-four hours after infection, cells were harvested, and total RNA was isolated using a High Pure RNA isolation kit (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For cDNA synthesis, total mRNA was reverse-transcribed using a Transcriptor High Fidelity cDNA kit (Roche Diagnostics). PCR reactions were done using the quantitative PCR Mastermix kit (Quantace, London) according to the manufacturer‘s instructions. The standard temperature profile included initial denaturation for 10 min at 95 °C, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 15s, annealing at 52 °C to 60 °C (primer-dependent) for 15 s, and extension at 72 °C for 10 s. Mouse actin served as a housekeeping gene. All oligonucleotide primers were purchased from BioTez (Berlin, Germany). The PCR products were analyzed on a 1.8% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Mouse gastric epithelial cells (WT and Ctsx−/−) and mouse macrophage cells (J-774A.1) were isolated and seeded in six-well plates as described above. After 48 h, a modified scratch-assay was performed. We used culture inserts from Ibidi (Munich, Germany), which created a cell-free gap of ∼500–600 μm after removing the culture insert. At first, all cells were counted in a Coulter Counter ZII (Coulter Immunotech, Marseille, France) and diluted to a cell suspension of 5 × 105 cells/ml. Subsequently, the epithelial cells (WT and Ctsx−/−) were transferred into the left well of the culture insert and the macrophage cell suspension in the right one. Mouse gastric epithelial cells (WT, Ctsx−/−) were infected with H. pylori SS1 as described above. The culture insert was removed, medium was changed, and the cellular interaction between the infected or noninfected mouse gastric epithelial cells (WT, Ctsx−/−) and mouse macrophages (J-774A.1) was monitored by time-lapse video microscopy (LEICA TCS SP2 microscope) with time intervals of 15 min. To quantify the migration, a scale bar was photographed using the same magnification, and images were combined to determine the mean distance traveled by 10 cells at the leading edge over the course of the experiment. Data of three separate experiments were presented as μm/h (migration speed). The Oligo GEArray® Mouse T-cell and B-cell Activation Microarray was purchased from SABiosciences Corp. (Biomol, Hamburg, Germany). The Oligo GEArray® is designed to profile expression of 113 focused genes representing T- and B-cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation, which are key steps of adaptive immunity. The complete lists of genes are listed and available on the SABiosciences Web site. In addition, genes that activate macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer cells are involved. Total RNA from primary gastric epithelial cells (infected with H. pylori and uninfected WT and Ctsx−/− mice) was transcribed to labeled cRNA according to the manufacturer‘s instructions (TrueLabelingAMPTM 2.0 and ArrayGradeTM cRNA Cleanup kit, SABiosciences Corp.). Prehybridization, washing steps, hybridization, and chemiluminescence detection were carried out following the protocol of the manufacturer. For signal development, we used the GEArray® chemiluminescent detection system (SABiosciences Corp.). Images were quantified using the GeneGnome and GeneTools image scanning and analysis package (Syngene BioImaging Systems, Synoptics Ltd.). Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical analyses were performed using Student's t test. Differences or significance between the groups was assumed for p ≤ 0.05 (*). We tested the expression of relevant cathepsins (Ctsx/b/l) in the complete mouse stomach and extracted gastric epithelial cells (WT, Ctsx−/−, and Ctsb−/−), all of C57BL/6 background, to clarify the general expression pattern of cathepsins in the WT compared with the gene-manipulated mice. RNA was isolated from gastric tissues and primary gastric epithelial cells. Expression of the cathepsins was studied by quantitative RT-PCRs. Ctsx expression was increased 2-fold in Ctsb−/− tissue compared with WT stomachs, whereas in extracted epithelial cells of similar origins, the increase was 6.5-fold. Ctsb expression was increased 1.7-fold in Ctsx−/− mice compared with WT tissue and 2.7-fold in isolated cells. Compared with WT mice, Ctsl is also overexpressed (up to 100-fold) in Ctsb−/− and in Ctsx−/− mice. The absolute expression in the epithelial cells is ∼2-fold lower than in tissue because of other Ctsx-expressing cells. Taken together, the expression and the increase of the expression are comparable in tissue and corresponding epithelial cells. Gene-manipulated mice generally expressed significantly higher levels of the cathepsins not depleted. Statistical data (t test) are shown in bar graphs in (Fig. 1, A and B). To compare Ctsx expression in wild-type primary gastric epithelial cells with the murine gastric carcinoma cell line CLS 103, we infected the different cell types with H. pylori and performed quantitative RT-PCR and bacterial adhesion assay. Our previous studies have shown that of all the cathepsins in gastric mucosa, only Ctsx was up-regulated by H. pylori (12Krueger S. Kuester D. Bernhardt A. Wex T. Roessner A. J. Pathol. 2009; 217: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 13Krueger S. Kalinski T. Hundertmark T. Wex T. Küster D. Peitz U. Ebert M. Nägler D.K. Kellner U. Malfertheiner P. Naumann M. Röcken C. Roessner A. J. Pathol. 2005; 207: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have concentrated only on Ctsx expression. The wild-type primary gastric epithelial cells (Fig. 2A) and the murine gastric carcinoma cell line CLS 103 (Fig. 2B) were grown on six-well plates for 2 days. The epithelial cells were infected with H. pylori strain SS1. Uninfected cells served as controls. The density of SS1 colonization was markedly higher in primary cells compared with CLS 103 cells (Fig. 2C). Ctsx was detected by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Mouse actin mRNA was used as a housekeeping gene. As shown in Fig. 2D, Ctsx is significantly up-regulated (17-fold) at the mRNA level in H. pylori-infected epithelial cells of WT mice (p = 0.00322). H. pylori infection of the CLS 103 cell line resulted in a 3-fold increase of Ctsx, which was not statistically significant. The Ctsx expression after H. pylori infection is generally 13-fold higher in WT cells than in CLS 103 cells. A characteristic feature of H. pylori is its ability to stimulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines. To analyze the influence of H. pylori infection on the expression of cytokines in conjunction with the Ctsx level, we used primary mouse gastric epithelial cells from wild-type and Ctsx−/− mice, as well as the mouse macrophage cell line J-774A.1. The wild-type and Ctsx−/− primary cells were co-cultured with J-774A.1 cells, infected with H. pylori SS1, and tested for the expression of mouse chemo- and cytokines (CXCL1, IL-6, IL-1β, and MCP-1). Mono-cultures with the same treatment served as controls. Ctsx expression is significantly increased after H. pylori infection, whereas Ctsb showed no significant increase in WT and Ctsx−/− mice after infection (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). The results obtained with co-cultured epithelial cells were similar. The macrophages in co-culture with Ctsx−/− epithelial cells induced Ctsx more strongly (2-fold) than macrophages co-cultured with WT epithelial cells (0.2-fold; data not shown). We then focused on the analysis of the expression of cytokines in mono- and co-cultures after H. pylori infection. In co-cultured epithelial WT cells, CXCL1 was 35-fold less expressed than in mono-cultured epithelial WT cells (Fig. 3, A and B), with a 7.4-fold increase in co-culture and a 10.2-fold elevation in mono-cultured WT epithelial cells after H. pylori infection (Fig. 3, E and D). Ctsx−/− cells showed a comparable increase of CXCL1 after H. pylori infection (Fig. 3D), unless CXCL1 was less strongly expressed in Ctsx−/− mono-cultured epithelial cells than in WT mono-cultured epithelial cells (Fig. 3A). As in WT, the CXCL1 expression in co-cultured Ctsx−/− epithelial cells was further reduced (Fig. 3B), but the increase is similar after H. pylori infection, with a tendency to express CXCL1 in Ctsx−/− more strongly than WT cells (Fig. 3E). Compared with WT, IL-6 expression is markedly reduced in Ctsx−/− mono-cultured (p ≤ 0.001) and co-cultured (p ≤ 0.06) epithelial cells (Fig. 3, A and B). After H. pylori infection, the expression of IL-6 was significantly more increased (p ≤ 0.044) only in Ctsx−/− co-cultured epithelial cells compared with WT (Fig. 3E). IL-1β behaved like IL-6 in WT mono- and co-cultured epithelial cells (Fig. 3, A–E), with a 4.5-fold increase after H. pylori infection in mono-cultures (Fig. 3D). In Ctsx−/− mono-cultured epithelial cells, IL-1β was expressed only at the detection limit (Fig. 3A). The level of IL-1β was slightly increased in co-cultured Ctsx−/− cells but was nonetheless significantly reduced (p ≤ 0.0059) compared with WT co-cultures (Fig. 3B). After infection, there was no induction detectable as in WT cells (Fig. 3E). MCP-1 is less expressed in Ctsx−/− mono- and co-cultured cells compared with the corresponding WT cells (Fig. 3, A and B). No significant differences in H. pylori-dependent induction of MCP-1 were found for Ctsx−/− and WT cells (Fig. 3, D and E). The expression of MCP-1 is significantly weaker in macrophages (J774A.1) co-cultured with WT cells (p ≤ 0.048) compared with Ctsx−/− co-cultured macrophages (Fig. 3C); however, the induction of MCP-1 after H. pylori infection is comparable (Fig. 3F). J774A.1 generally expresses CXCL1 at the detection limit without progression after H. pylori infection of the epithelial cells (Fig. 3, C and F). IL-6 was even expressed at the detection limit (Fig. 3C) but was markedly increased by H. pylori infection in both WT and Ctsx−/− co-cultured cells with a significant higher induction (p ≤ 0.0218) in Ctsx−/− co-cultured J774A.1 (Fig. 3F). Cytokine IL-1β, which indicated no induction in co-cultured epithelial cells after H. pylori infection, improved a massive induction (12- to 25-fold) in macrophages co-cultured with WT and Ctsx−/− cells (Fig. 3F), with no significant difference in induction between the two co-cultures. In summary, Ctsx−/− epithelial cells show weaker expression of CXCL1, IL-6, IL-1β, and MCP-1, but display a tendency for higher cytokine induction after H. pylori infection. Furthermore, macrophages in co-culture with Ctsx−/− epithelial cells express up to 18-fold more MCP-1 and show higher induction of all the other cytokines compared with J774A.1 in co-culture with WT cells. Fig. 3 shows all statistical data, presented in bar graphs for each cytokine. To analyze changes in the gene expression of primary gastric epithelial cells in response to H. pylori SS1, we performed cDNA microarray analysis using the Oligo GEArray® Mouse T-cell and B-cell activation microarray. This array contains 113 genes involved in T-cell and B-cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation. We used mRNA from primary gastric WT and Ctsx−/− epithelial cells with and without H. pylori SS1 infection. All images were quantified, and the final results are expressed as -fold changes given as a relative gene expression (Table 2). The majority of genes showed no differences in expression between WT and Ctsx−/− epithelial cells by infection with H. pylori. But there were 13 differently expressed genes in Ctsx−/− epithelial cells, the expression of which was >1.5-fold up-regulated after H. pylori infection. Some of these genes, for example Shb, Ccnd3, Ap3b1, and Gadd45g, were not influenced in WT epithelial cells after H. pylori infection (indicated by a dash in Table 2). Interestingly, 9 of these 13 genes are involved in T-cell or B-cell proliferation, whereas only four genes were up-regulated in T-cell and B-cell differentiation. Results were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. Primer sequences are listed in Table 1. The most abundant gene found to be up-regulated 3.03-fold was Spp1 in Ctsx−/− epithelial cells, followed by CD81 (2.01-fold). Induction of Hmgb3, Inpp5d, and Ccnd3, as shown by microarray data, could not be validated using quantitative RT-PCR. Furthermore, Gl"
https://openalex.org/W2058792024,"The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is an integral component of the pathway for Na(+) absorption in epithelial cells. The ubiquitin ligases Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 bind to ENaC and decrease its activity. Conversely, Serum- and Glucocorticoid regulated Kinase-1 (SGK1), a downstream mediator of aldosterone, increases ENaC activity. This effect is at least partly mediated by direct interaction between SGK and Nedd4-2. SGK binds both Nedd4 and Nedd4-2, but it is only able to phosphorylate Nedd4-2. Phosphorylation of Nedd4-2 reduces its ability to bind to ENaC, due to the interaction of phosphorylated Nedd4-2 with 14-3-3 proteins, and hence increases ENaC activity. WW-domains in Nedd4-like proteins bind PY-motifs (PPXY) present in ENaC subunits, and SGK also has a PY-motif.Here we show that single or tandem WW-domains of Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 mediate binding to SGK and that different WW-domains of Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 are involved. Our data also show that WW-domains 2 and 3 of Nedd4-2 mediate the interaction with SGK in a cooperative manner, that activated SGK has increased affinity for the WW-domains of Nedd4-2 in vitro, and a greater stimulatory effect on ENaC Na(+) transport compared to wildtype SGK. Further, SGK lacking a PY motif failed to stimulate ENaC activity in the presence of Nedd4-2.Binding of Nedd4-2 WW-domains to SGK is necessary for SGK-induced ENaC activity."
https://openalex.org/W2004727345,"Adenosine is a candidate modulator of sperm motility in the female reproductive tract that increases sperm flagellar beat frequency in vitro. Past work suggested that this acceleration may involve equilibrative (ENT) and concentrative (CNT) nucleoside transporters. Here we show that Slc29a1 (ENT-1) is the predominant nucleoside transporter expressed in the mouse testis. Unexpectedly, the beat of Slc29a1-null sperm still accelerates in response to 2-chloro-2′-deoxyadenosine (Cl-dAdo). Moreover, in wild-type sperm neither blockade of CNTs by removal of external Na+, nor inhibition of ENTs with nitrobenzylthioionosine, prevents acceleration of the sperm beat by Cl-dAdo. In contrast, pertussis toxin produces strong blockade, indicating involvement of a Gαi/o-coupled adenosine receptor. Although agonists selective for adenosine receptors A1R, A2aR, and A2bR are ineffective, A3R-selective agonists Cl-IB-MECA and IB-MECA do accelerate the beat. Consistent with this pharmacological profile, the predominant Adora transcripts in the testis are products of the nested Adora3i1 and Adora3i2 genes. Surprisingly, Cl-IB-MECA and Cl-dAdo still accelerate the beat of Adora3i1-null sperm indicating that the remaining Adora3i2 transcript produces an A3R that functions in sperm. When cloned Adora3i2 is heterologously expressed in tsA-201 cells, Cl-dAdo decreases forskolin-evoked accumulation of cAMP, indicating that Adora3i2 specifies a functional A3Ri2 adenosine receptor that couples through Gαi. Database mining reveals that mouse Adora3i2 is expressed primarily in testis, almost exclusively in spermatids. Expression of the orthologous ADORA3i3 transcript also is most prominent in human testis; presumably producing an A3Ri3 receptor that is functional in sperm and that may be a target for development of male-directed contraceptives.

The only known roles of sperm are to reach the egg and deliver its genetic payload and to initiate early signaling events in the zygote. Although the list is short, the tasks are complex, and the sperm requires numerous specialized components to accomplish these goals. Our recent work has focused on how the sperm applies its specialized components to control swimming behavior. We have combined biophysical methods with a genetic approach, using sperm from null-mutant (knock-out) mice that carry targeted disruptions of the genes for several of the components of the signaling pathways that operate in the sperm flagellum. This approach has provided definitive evidence for required roles of the unique CatSper ion channel proteins (1Carlson A.E. Quill T.A. Westenbroek R.E. Schuh S.M. Hille B. Babcock D.F. J. Biol.

Slc29a1+/− breeding pairs were maintained in a hybrid (50% C57BL6/J, 50% SX1/SvJ) background. Adora3i1−/− breeding pairs were maintained in a C57BL6/J background. After rinsing with medium HS (in mm): 135 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgSO4, 20 HEPES, 5 glucose, 10 lactic acid, 1 pyruvic acid, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH, the excised tissue was transferred to 1 ml of a swimout/capacitation medium (HS with 5 mg BSA/ml and 15 mm NaHCO3). Semen was allowed to exude (15 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2) from several small incisions. All subsequent operations were at room temperature (22–25 °C) in medium HS, unless noted otherwise. Sperm were washed twice, then dispersed, and stored at 1–2× 107 cells ml−1. Some experiments used Na+-deficient versions of medium HS prepared by replacement of NaCl with N-methyl-d-glucamine hydrochloride and of NaHCO3 with tetraethylammonium bicarbonate. Stock solutions of Cl-dAdo (1 mm in medium HS) and other adenosine analogs, agonists, and inhibitors (1–30 mm in DMSO) were stored frozen. After final dilution the DMSO was <1% (v/v). A parallel solvent-only control was performed when addition of stocks produced DMSO >0.1%. Mouse tissue was rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen, transferred to 6 m guanidinium chloride and sonicated. Mouse testis RNA was isolated using the RNAeasyTM kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) per the manufacturer's instructions. Human testis RNA was purchased from Origene (Rockville, MD). RNA concentrations were determined from A260. Quantitative RT-PCR reactions were performed using 25 ng of RNA in Brilliant II Syber Green Master MixTM with reverse transcriptase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using gene-specific primers with matched annealing temperatures and similar amplicon lengths. Mouse primers: Slc29a1 (F: 5′-CAGCCTGTGCAGTTGTCATT-3′, R: 5′-CCGTGAAGATGAAGCAGACA-3′), Slc29a2 (F: 5′-TTGCCCGTTACTACCTGACC-3′, R: 5′-CGACAGGGTGACTGTGAAGA-3′), Slc29a3 (F: 5′-TAGCAGCTCCTCCACCATCT-3′, R: 5′-GGCAACTGGCCTCATGTAGT-3′), Slc29a4 (F: 5′- ACCGCTACCATGCCATCTAC-3′, R: 5′-CCTGGTCGTGAGAGAAGAGC-3′), Slc28a1 (F: 5′-TGGTCTACCCAGAGGTGGAG-3′, R: 5′-GGACGTAGGAGCAGATGAGC-3′), Slc28a2 (F: 5′- ATGCTTGAAGCCTCTGGAAA-3′, R: 5′-ATCTGATCTCCCAGCCATTG-3′), Slc28a3 (F: 5′-CAAACTGGGCCAACAAAACT-3′, R: 5′-GGGCAGGATCTTAAATGCAA-3′), Adora1 (F: 5′-CTTCTACCTGATCCGCAAGC-3′, R: 5′-AGAAAGGTGACCCGGAACTT-3′), Adora2a (F: 5′-GGCTCCTCGGTGTACATCAT-3′, R: 5′-GGCTGAAGATGGAACTCTGC-3′), Adora2b (F: 5′-CCTTTGGCATTGGATTGACT-3′, R: 5′-CCTGGAGTGGTCCATCAGTT-3′), Adora3i1(F: 5′-CCCTGGTTGTCATGTGTGTC-3′, R: 5′-AGGGTTCATCATGGAGTTCG-3′), Adora3i2 (F: 5′-CAGGTGTTGAGCTGGAGACA-3′, R: 5′-ATTGGCCCGGTCTTCTCTAT-3′). Human primers: ADORA3i1 (F: 5′-GGGCATCACAATCCACTTCT-3′, R: 5′-CATGACCATGGCATCTGAAA-3′), ADORA3i2 (F: 5′-TTGTCATGTGCGCCATCTAT-3′, R: 5′-AGGGTTCATCATGGAGTTGG-3′), ADORA3i3 (F: 5′-GACCCATTGAGCAGAAGGAG-3′, R: 5′-CACATGACTGGAAGGAAGCA-3′). Quantitative PCR was performed in a MX3000P PCR machine (Stratagene), and the products were verified for appropriate length by gel electrophoresis then sequenced. Relative gene expression was determined using the ΔΔCt method with normalization to Arbp (acidic ribosomal-binding protein) as in Sanz et al. (24Sanz E. Yang L. Su T. Morris D.R. McKnight G.S. Amieux P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 13939-13944Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Positive control reference tissues were used to verify primer efficacy. RNA for human and mouse was also reverse-transcribed to generate cDNA using the Superscript First Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA). Full-length transcripts were amplified using transcript-specific primer combinations: human ADORA3i2 (F: 5′-ATGCCCAACAACAGCACTG-3′, R: 5′-CTACTCAGAATTCTTCTCAATGCTTG-3′); ADORA3i3 (F: 5′-ATGGAAGGGTCTCCAGCAG-3′, R: 5′-TCACATCTGTTCAGTAGGAGCC-3′). Full-length mouse transcripts of Adora3i1 and Adora3i2 were amplified with the primers used for cloning (see below). Transcripts of Adora3i3, which shares exons with both Adora3i1 and Adora3i2, were probed with the Adora3i2 forward primer and the Adora3i1 reverse primer. PCR products were visualized on 1% agarose gels run in TAE (Tris-acetate-EDTA) buffer and stained with ethidium bromide. Tissues and sperm were extracted with the TNE buffer (10 mm Tris pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1× protease inhibitor mixture) for 45 min on ice with vortexing every 5 min. Samples were clarified by centrifugation (10000 × g, 5 min), and protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay reagent (Thermo Scientific). As in past work (22Wennemuth G. Carlson A.E. Harper A.J. Babcock D.F. Development. 2003; 130: 1317-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), time series of stop-motion, phase-contrast images of loosely-tethered sperm were recorded while a gravity-fed, solenoid-controlled local-perfusion device applied and removed test solutions. After adjustments of image size and orientation using Metamorph (Molecular Devices, Toronto, Canada) and Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR) the flagellar location in each image was captured by automated determination of intensity maxima and minima in a line-scan perpendicular to the axis of the flagellar beat. The most prominent peak in the power spectrum of the Fourier transform of the flagellar location over time then directly reported flagellar beat frequency. Cloning of Adora3i2 was performed by RT-PCR amplification of the full-length transcript from testis RNA using gene-specific primers (Forward: 5′-TATCGAAGCTTCGCCACCATGGAGTTCCTCCTCCTTCTCT-3′, Reverse: 5′-GATACGGATCCCCTCAAATCCTTGCCAAAGTTATG-3′) as described (6Carlson A.E. Burnett L.A. del Camino D. Quill T.A. Hille B. Chong J.A. Moran M.M. Babcock D.F. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e6844Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites were incorporated into the 5′-ends of the forward and reverse PCR primers (underlined), to facilitate cloning into the EcoRI and HindIII sites in the tagRFP vector. A consensus Kozak sequence, CGCCAAC, was inserted upstream of the Adora3i2 start codon to ensure efficient translation. The full-length, PCR-amplified template was then digested with EcoRI and HindIII and ligated into the tagRFP vector. The ligated plasmids were then transformed into chemically competent DH5α Escherichia coli. Plasmid DNA isolated from bacterial clones was fully sequenced to verify the identity of the inserted gene. Recombinant adenosine receptor Adora3i2 was expressed in tsA-201 cells in culture by transient transfection with Fugene 6 (Roche, Mannheim, Germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 1% (w/v) penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C. Cells were transfected at 50% confluency and assayed at 100% confluency ∼24–36 h after transfection. Control cells were transfected with cytosolic GFP (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were washed with and equilibrated for 15 min in assay buffer (in mm): 110 NaCl, 5 NaHCO3, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 5 KCl, 2.7 CaCl2, 1 MgSO4, 20 HEPES, 10 glucose, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. Incubation continued for 15 min in the presence of 1 mm IBMX. Triplicate wells were further treated for 15 min with the same buffer containing 1 mm IBMX alone or with 3 μm forskolin. An additional 6 wells were treated with IBMX and 30 μm Cl-dAdo. In the final 15 min of incubation, forskolin was added to 3 of these 6 wells. All remaining wells received no further additions. Buffer was then carefully aspirated, and cells were lysed by addition of 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1 m NaOH (150 μl) followed by an equal volume of 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1 m HCl. The neutralized cell lysates were assayed for cAMP content using a cAMP radioimmunoassay kit per manufacturer's instructions for non-acetylated samples. Our past work suggested that adenosine and related analogs may enter sperm via equilibrative and concentrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs and CNTs) to engage a cAMP-mediated signaling pathway that increases sperm flagellar beat frequency (10Schuh S.M.

Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 728-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) and Slc29a1-4 genes encode ENT1–4 (26Baldwin S.A. Beal P.R. Yao S.Y. King A.E. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Since integral membrane proteins of sperm are obligatorily produced during spermatogenesis or spermiogenesis, we applied qRT-PCR to quantify the relative expression of nucleoside transporter transcripts in adult testis. The results (Fig. 1A) show that the testis has little or no mRNA for the Slc28a family, with more mRNA for the Slc29a genes. The relative abundance of the prominent Slc29a1 mRNA is 160- and 32-fold greater than mRNA of Slc29a4 and Slc29a2, the products of the genes for the other surface membrane ENT transporters (the Slc29a3 encodes ENT3, which is predominantly mitochondrial (27Govindarajan R. Leung G.P. Zhou M. Tse C.M. Wang J. Unadkat J.D. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2009; 296: G910-G922Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar)). Consequently, our focus turns to Slc29a1, the nucleoside transporter gene that is most highly expressed in the testis. To test directly for a required role of ENT1 in sperm responses to adenosine analogs, we used the Slc29a1-null mouse (16Choi D.S. Cascini M.G. Mailliard W. Young H. Paredes P. McMahon T. Diamond I. Bonci A. Messing R.O. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 855-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In the experiments of Fig. 1B, the averaged beat frequencies of resting sperm from wild-type and Slc29a1-null mice were ∼3 Hz. Upon challenge with 25 μm Cl-dAdo, the beat of wild-type sperm accelerated by 2.3 Hz min−1 reaching 5.6 Hz at 90 s of stimulus. In comparison, the Slc29a1-null sperm accelerated by 1.4 Hz min−1, reaching 4.3 Hz at 90 s. Although the adenosine analog increases beat frequency of the Slc29a1-null sperm, the flagellar waveform is abnormal (see supplemental videos and Fig. S1). Specifically, we consistently observe an apparent stiffness of the proximal flagellum so that the flagellar beat appears to initiate in the principal piece rather than in the proximal flagellum. We interpret this flagellar waveform abnormality to be a probable result of a developmental defect introduced into the flagellum by the absence of the ENT-1 transporter in spermatogenic cells or in the Sertoli cells that support them during spermiogenesis. The same developmental defect may explain the diminished ability of the flagellum of mature Slc29a1-null sperm to respond to accelerating stimuli. We conclude that, although decreased in extent, the ability of Cl-dAdo to accelerate the beat of Slc29a1-null sperm is inconsistent with a required role for ENT1. We also applied a pharmacological approach to examine the role of Slc29a-family transporters. Nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBTI) rapidly inhibits both ENT1 and ENT2 at 10 μm and likely also inhibits ENT3 and ENT4 (26Baldwin S.A. Beal P.R. Yao S.Y. King A.E. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). In the experiments of Fig. 2A, 12.5 μm Cl-dAdo accelerated the beat of wild-type sperm by 2.1 Hz min−1, reaching 5.1 Hz after 90 s of stimulus. In the presence of 10 μm NBTI, Cl-dAdo accelerated the beat by 2.3 Hz min−1, reaching 5.4 Hz at 90 s. The inability of this broad spectrum ENT inhibitor to diminish sperm response to Cl-dAdo suggests that ENT-1 and other Slc29a-family equilibrative nucleoside transporters are not required for flagellar response to Cl-dAdo. Fig. 2B examines possible involvement of the Slc28a family of concentrative nucleoside transporters in sperm. Because CNTs are driven by the transmembrane [Na+] gradient, we replaced external Na+ with N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG+). Sperm were perfused with Na+-containing HS medium or with NMDG-substituted (Na+-deficient) medium for 1 min, then challenged with the same medium containing 25 μm Cl-dAdo. The acceleration of the beat (4.4 Hz and 4.2 Hz min−1) was indistinguishable, reaching 8.7 and 8.5 Hz after 90 s of stimulus. A final challenge with 15 mm HCO3− produced little or no additional increase. Because removal of sodium has little impact on sperm response to Cl-dAdo, we conclude that Slc28a family (CNT) transporters also are not required. With strong indications that adenosine analog action does not require entry via cell surface adenosine transporters, we applied pharmacology to evaluate the alternate hypothesis that analog action involves cell surface adenosine receptors. Table 1 compares averaged beat frequencies of sperm bathed (1–5 min) in HS medium alone, with Cl-dAdo, or with agonists selective for the 3 families (A1R, A2R, and A3R) of adenosine receptors that have been defined by pharmacological response and binding profiles (13Fredholm B.B. Arslan G. Halldner L. Kull B. Schulte G. Wasserman W. Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 2000; 362: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The resting beat frequency (in HS alone) was ∼3–3.5 Hz, and increased ∼2-fold in the presence of Cl-dAdo, consistent with FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2. The A1R-selective agonist CCPA (100 μm) did not change the beat frequency significantly, and the A2aR- and A2bR-selective agonist CGS21680 (40 μm) slightly slowed the beat (to 2.5 Hz). By contrast, with the A3R-selective agonist Cl-IB-MECA (30 μm) the mean beat was 5.9 Hz, indistinguishable from that with Cl-dAdo. The related A3R agonist IB-MECA (100 μm) also was effective; however the mean beat with IB-MECA (5.1 Hz) was marginally slower than with either Cl-dAdo or Cl-IB-MECA. Fig. 3 shows the concentration dependence of the extent and time-course of response of the flagellar beat to Cl-IB-MECA. With 1 to 30 μm Cl-IB-MECA, the beat accelerated linearly for 60–90 s before reaching a sustained, concentration-dependent, elevated rate. The potency of Cl-IBMECA shown here (EC50 ∼5 μm) is consistent with its published potency in A3R-mediated responses in mast cells (28Baram D. Dekel O. Mekori Y.A. Sagi-Eisenberg R. J. Immunol. 2010; 184: 3677-3688Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) Subsequent replacement of 30 μm Cl-IBMECA with 15 mm NaHCO3 did not further increase the sustained rate. The agonist response profiles of Table 1 and Fig. 3 indicate that an A3R receptor may initiate acceleration of the flagellar beat evoked by adenosine and its analogs.TABLE 1Responses to selective adenosine receptor agonistsTreatmentBeat frequencynHzNone3.45 ± 0.19aThese groups did not differ (p > 0.05).97 DMSO (1%)3.27 ± 0.17aThese groups did not differ (p > 0.05).59Adenosine analog Cl-dAdo (25 μm)6.32 ± 0.51dThese groups differed from a and from one another (p < 0.05).71A1R agonist CCPA (100 μm)3.65 ± 0.18aThese groups did not differ (p > 0.05).62A2R agonist CGS21680 (40 μm)2.50 ± 0.14bThese groups differed from a and from one another (p < 0.05).20A3R agonist IB-MECA (100 μm)5.06 ± 0.37cThese groups differed from a and from one another (p < 0.05).53 Cl-IB-MECA (30 μm)5.87 ± 0.53cThese groups differed from a and from one another (p < 0.05).,dThese groups differed from a and from one another (p < 0.05).42a These groups did not differ (p > 0.05).b–d These groups differed from a and from one another (p < 0.05). Open table in a new tab The mouse genome has 3 documented isoforms of Adora3. Adora3i1 and Adora3i2 share no coding regions. The newly-recognized Adora3i3 shares exons with both Adora3i1 and Adora3i2, but shares coding exons only with Adora3i1 (Fig. 4A). If an adenosine receptor is required for Cl-dAdo-evoked acceleration of sperm, then that receptor should be expressed in their spermatogenic cell precursors. Using primers to amplify full-length transcripts, PCR reported that only Adora3i1 and Adora3i2 transcripts are expressed in the mouse testis (Fig. 4B). The mobility of the Adora3i1 and Adora3i2 PCR products indicated they were the appropriate size, and sequencing confirmed their identification. Using an approach similar to that in Fig. 1, we applied qRT-PCR to examine abundance of Adora1, -2a, -2b, and -3 mRNA in the adult testis. Fig. 4C shows that mRNA for Adora3i2 is 13-fold more abundant than mRNA for Adora3i1, and 250-fold more abundant than mRNA for Adora1, -2a, and -2b. Anticipating use of the Adora3 knock-out mouse to test for a required role of A3 receptors in sperm, we performed PCR on testes from Adora3−/− mice and from age-matched Adora3+/+ mice of the same genetic background. Fig. 5A shows that RNA from wild-type testis produces Adora3i1 and Adora3i2 PCR products. As expected, the Adora3−/− testis lacks the Adora3i1 transcript. Surprisingly, the Adora3i2 transcript was still present. Hence, we will refer to these animals as Adora3i1−/− or Adora3i1-null. The second exon of the Adora3 gene is absent in th"

Here, we report that plasminogen stimulates propagation of the protease-resistant scrapie PrP (PrP(Sc)). Compared to control PMCA conducted without plasminogen, addition of plasminogen in PMCA using wild-type brain material significantly increased PrP conversion, with an EC(50) = ∼56 nM. PrP conversion in PMCA was substantially less efficient with plasminogen-deficient brain material than with wild-type material. The activity stimulating PrP conversion was specific for plasminogen and conserved in its kringle domains. Such activity was abrogated by modification of plasminogen structure and interference of PrP-plasminogen interaction. Kinetic analysis of PrP(Sc) generation demonstrated that the presence of plasminogen in PMCA enhanced the PrP(Sc) production rate to ∼0.97 U/μl/h and reduced turnover time to ∼1 h compared to those (∼0.4 U/μl/h and ∼2.5 h) obtained without supplementation. Furthermore, as observed in PMCA, plasminogen and kringles promoted PrP(Sc) propagation in ScN2a and Elk 21(+) cells. Our results demonstrate that plasminogen functions in stimulating conversion processes and represents the first cellular protein cofactor that enhances the hypothetical mechanism of prion propagation."

https://openalex.org/W1989156145,"Background In analogy to normal stem cell differentiation, the current cancer stem cell (CSC) model presumes a hierarchical organization and an irreversible differentiation in tumor tissue. Accordingly, CSCs should comprise only a small subset of the tumor cells, which feeds tumor growth. However, some recent findings raised doubts on the general applicability of the CSC model and asked for its refinement. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study we analyzed the CSC properties of mammary carcinoma cells derived from transgenic (WAP-T) mice. We established a highly tumorigenic WAP-T cell line (G-2 cells) that displays stem-like traits. G-2 cells, as well as their clonal derivates, are closely related to primary tumors regarding histology and gene expression profiles, and reflect heterogeneity regarding their differentiation states. G-2 cultures comprise cell populations in distinct differentiation states identified by co-expression of cytoskeletal proteins (cytokeratins and vimentin), a combination of cell surface markers and a set of transcription factors. Cellular subsets sorted according to expression of CD24a, CD49f, CD61, Epcam, Sca1, and Thy1 cell surface proteins, or metabolic markers (e.g. ALDH activity) are competent to reconstitute the initial cellular composition. Repopulation efficiency greatly varies between individual subsets and is influenced by interactions with the respective complementary G-2 cellular subset. The balance between differentiation states is regulated in part by the transcription factor Sox10, as depletion of Sox10 led to up-regulation of Twist2 and increased the proportion of Thy1-expressing cells representing cells in a self-renewable, reversible, quasi-mesenchymal differentiation state. Conclusions/Significance G-2 cells constitute a self-reproducing cancer cell system, maintained by bi- and unidirectional conversion of complementary cellular subsets. Our work contributes to the current controversial discussion on the existence and nature of CSC and provides a basis for the incorporation of alternative hypotheses into the CSC model."

It has a soluble family member, LAIR-2, that also binds collagen and can interfere with LAIR-1/collagen interactions. Collagen is a main initiator for platelet adhesion and aggregation. Here, we explored the potential of soluble LAIR proteins to inhibit thrombus formation in vitro. LAIR-2/Fc but not LAIR-1/Fc inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation. In addition, LAIR-2/Fc also interfered with platelet adhesion to collagen at low shear rate (300 s(-1); IC(50) = 18 microg/ml) and high shear rate (1500 s(-1); IC(50) = 30 microg/ml). Additional experiments revealed that LAIR-2/Fc leaves interactions between collagen and alpha2beta1 unaffected, but efficiently prevents binding of collagen to Glycoprotein VI and von Willebrand factor. Thus, LAIR-2/Fc has the capacity to interfere with platelet-collagen interactions mediated by Glycoprotein VI and the VWF/Glycoprotein Ib axis."
https://openalex.org/W2035705986,"Activating transcription factor 1 (ATF1) and the closely related proteins CREB (cyclic AMP resonse element binding protein) and CREM (cyclic AMP response element modulator) constitute a subfamily of bZIP transcription factors that play critical roles in the regulation of cellular growth, metabolism, and survival. Previous studies demonstrated that CREB is phosphorylated on a cluster of conserved Ser residues, including Ser-111 and Ser-121, in response to DNA damage through the coordinated actions of the ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) protein kinase and casein kinases 1 and 2 (CK1/2). Here, we show that DNA damage-induced phosphorylation by ATM is a general feature of CREB and ATF1. ATF1 harbors a conserved ATM/CK cluster that is constitutively and stoichiometrically phosphorylated by CK1 and CK2 in asynchronously growing cells. Exposure to DNA damage further induced ATF1 phosphorylation on Ser-51 by ATM in a manner that required prior phosphorylation of the upstream CK residues. Hyperphosphorylated ATF1 showed a 4-fold reduced affinity for CREB-binding protein. We further show that PP2A, in conjunction with its targeting subunit B56γ, antagonized ATM and CK1/2-dependent phosphorylation of CREB and ATF1 in cellulo. Finally, we show that CK sites in CREB are phosphorylated during cellular growth and that phosphorylation of these residues reduces the threshold of DNA damage required for ATM-dependent phosphorylation of the inhibitory Ser-121 residue. These studies define overlapping and distinct modes of CREB and ATF1 regulation by phosphorylation that may ensure concerted changes in gene expression mediated by these factors."

We have previously shown that activation of protein kinase C (PKC) markedly reduces transepithelial chloride secretion in human colonic T84 cells, which correlates with both functional inhibition and loss of the NKCC1 surface expression. In the present study, we defined the specific roles of PKC isoforms in regulating epithelial NKCC1 and chloride secretion utilizing adenoviral vectors that express shRNAs targeting human PKC isoforms (α, δ, ϵ) (shPKCs) or LacZ (shLacZ, non-targeting control). After 72 h of adenoviral transduction, protein levels of the PKC isoforms in shPKCs-T84 cells were decreased by ∼90% compared with the shLacZ-control. Activation of PKCs by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) caused a redistribution of NKCC1 immunostaining from the basolateral membrane to intracellular vesicles in both shLacZ- and shPKCα-T84 cells, whereas the effect of PMA was not observed in shPKCδ- and shPKCϵ- cells. These results were further confirmed by basolateral surface biotinylation. Furthermore, activation of PKCs by PMA inhibited cAMP-stimulated chloride secretion in the uninfected, shLacZ- and shPKCα-T84 monolayers, but the inhibitory effect was significantly attenuated in shPKCδ- and shPKCϵ-T84 monolayers. In conclusion, the activated novel isoforms PKCδ or PKCϵ, but not the conventional isoform PKCα, inhibits transepithelial chloride secretion through inducing internalization of the basolateral surface NKCC1.

https://openalex.org/W2023096822,"Background Survivors of anterior MI are at increased risk for stroke with predilection to form ventricular thrombus. Commonly patients are discharged on dual antiplatelet therapy. Given the frequency of early coronary reperfusion and risk of bleeding, it remains uncertain whether anticoagulation offers additional utility. We examined the effectiveness of anticoagulation therapy for the prevention of stroke after anterior MI. Methods and Findings We performed a population-based cohort analysis of 10,383 patients who survived hospitalization for an acute MI in Ontario, Canada from April 1, 1999 to March 31, 2001. The primary outcome was four-year ischemic stroke rates compared between anterior and non-anterior MI patients. Risk factors for stroke were assessed by multivariate Cox proportional-hazards analysis. Warfarin use was determined at discharge and followed for 90 days among a subset of patients aged 66 and older (n = 1483). Among the 10,383 patients studied, 2,942 patients survived hospitalization for an anterior MI and 20% were discharged on anticoagulation therapy. Within 4 years, 169 patients (5.7%) were admitted with an ischemic stroke, half of which occurred within 1-year post-MI. There was no significant difference in stroke rate between anterior and non-anterior MI patients. The use of warfarin up to 90 days was not associated with stroke protection after anterior MI (hazard ratio [HR], 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37–1.26). The use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.44–0.95) and beta-blockers (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.41–0.87) were associated with a significant decrease in stroke risk. There was no significant difference in bleeding-related hospitalizations in patients who used warfarin for up to 90 days post-MI. Conclusion Many practitioners still consider a large anterior-wall MI as high risk for potential LV thrombus formation and stroke. Among a cohort of elderly patients who survived an anterior MI there was no benefit from the use of warfarin up to 90 days post-MI to prevent ischemic stroke. Our data suggests that routine anticoagulation of patients with anterior-wall MI may not be indicated. Prospective randomized trials are needed to determine the optimal antithrombin strategy for preventing this common and serious adverse outcome."
https://openalex.org/W1970071705,"Non-specific binding to biosensor surfaces is a major obstacle to quantitative analysis of selective retention of analytes at immobilized target molecules. Although a range of chemical antifouling monolayers has been developed to address this problem, many macromolecular interactions still remain refractory to analysis due to the prevalent high degree of non-specific binding. We describe how we use the dynamic process of the formation of self assembling monolayers and optimise physical and chemical properties thus reducing considerably non-specific binding and allowing analysis of specific binding of analytes to immobilized target molecules.We illustrate this approach by the production of specific protein arrays for the analysis of interactions between the 65kDa isoform of human glutamate decarboxylase (GAD65) and a human monoclonal antibody. Our data illustrate that we have effectively eliminated non-specific interactions with the surface containing the immobilised GAD65 molecules. The findings have several implications. First, this approach obviates the dubious process of background subtraction and gives access to more accurate kinetic and equilibrium values that are no longer contaminated by multiphase non-specific binding. Second, an enhanced signal to noise ratio increases not only the sensitivity but also confidence in the use of SPR to generate kinetic constants that may then be inserted into van't Hoff type analyses to provide comparative DeltaG, DeltaS and DeltaH values, making this an efficient, rapid and competitive alternative to ITC measurements used in drug and macromolecular-interaction mechanistic studies. Third, the accuracy of the measurements allows the application of more intricate interaction models than simple Langmuir monophasic binding.The detection and measurement of antibody binding by the type 1 diabetes autoantigen GAD65 represents an example of an antibody-antigen interaction where good structural, mechanistic and immunological data are available. Using SPRi we were able to characterise the kinetics of the interaction in greater detail than ELISA/RIA methods. Furthermore, our data indicate that SPRi is well suited to a multiplexed immunoassay using GAD65 proteins, and may be applicable to other biomarkers."

This rapidly expanding list includes voltage-gated K+ channels, inwardly rectifying K+ channels, and members of the TRP channel family, ENaC, NHE1, and NBCe1 (1Rosenhouse-Dantsker A. Logothetis D.E.

Common to these direct interaction studies has been the demonstration that mutagenesis of specific amino acids leads to changes in molecular interactions with phosphoinositides that lead to subsequent changes in physiologic channel or transporter activity. (ii) An indirect mechanism involves an additional intermediate, either protein or lipids, that binds via a phosphoinositide-dependent mechanism (5Rohacs T.

Sodium/hydrogen exchangers (SLC9a family) are ubiquitous transporters serving many functions in the cell, including regulation of intracellular pH, cell volume, and sodium absorption (15Zachos N.C. Tse M. Donowitz M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2005; 67: 411-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 16Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Pouyssegur J. Physiol.

Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that NHE1, the ubiquitous member of the sodium hydrogen exchanger gene family, is regulated by PI(4,5)P2, which binds to its C terminus. Using a unique whole cell patch pipette technique, Fuster et al. (18Fuster D. Moe O.W. Hilgemann D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10482-10487Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) showed that NHE3 is rapidly stimulated in opossum kidney cells by intracellular application of PI(3,4,5)P3. 2The abbreviations used are: PI(3,4,5)P3phosphatidylinositide 3,4,5-triphosphatePI(4,5,)P2phosphatidylinositide 4,5-bisphosphate, PI, phosphatidylinositolNSnot significant. However, the mechanism of this stimulation is unknown. We hypothesized that the epithelial brush border Na+/H+ antiporter NHE3 binds phosphoinositides based on the recognition that gene families have similar structural/functional organization (19Collins M.O. Science. 2009; 325: 1635-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to understand the mechanism of NHE3 regulation by phosphoinositides by the following: (i) investigating whether NHE3 can directly bind phosphoinositides; (ii) identifying regions and amino acids that are necessary for this interaction, and (iii) studying the physiologic relevance of this interaction. phosphatidylinositide 3,4,5-triphosphate phosphatidylinositide 4,5-bisphosphate, PI, phosphatidylinositol not significant. Lipids, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, PI(3,4,5)P3, and PI(4,5)P2 were from Avanti Polar Lipids. QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). EZ-link sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin was from Thermo Scientific (Rockford, IL). Nigericin and 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein were from Invitrogen. DNA primers were from Operon Biotechnologies (Huntsville, AL). Unless specified, all other chemicals and materials were from Sigma. Monoclonal mouse antibodies to the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (MMS 101-R) were from Covance Research Products (Princeton, NJ). Monoclonal mouse anti-polyhistidine antibodies (H1029) and monoclonal mouse anti-VSV-glycoprotein antibodies (A1970) were purchased from Sigma. Four His6-tagged cDNAs together spanning nearly the entire rabbit NHE3 C terminus were engineered by PCR to encode F1(amino acids 475–589), F2 (amino acids 590–667), F3 (amino acids 668–747), and F4 (amino acids 748–832). Fragments were ligated into pET 30a vector (Novagen) with N-terminal His6 tag using HindIII and EcoRI restriction sites. A 2-amino acid linker (LL) was placed at the C terminus, and a stop codon was inserted at the 3′ end for all inserts just after the linker region. Point mutations in full-length NHE3 were prepared using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Table 1). All the cDNAs were fully sequenced to ensure proper sequence, orientation, and reading frame.TABLE 1Summary of Na+/H+ exchange rates, surface biotinylation, and phosphoinositide binding studies for WT and NHE3 F1 point mutations The cDNAs of wild type (WT) rabbit (HA) NHE3 and point mutants Y501A/R503A/K505A, F509A/R511A/R512A, R511L/R512L, and R551L/R552L in pcDNA3.1/ G418 (Invitrogen) consisting of an N-terminal triple HA tag, as described previously (20Murtazina R.

Similarly, point mutation R520F/R527F with a C-terminal VSV-G epitope tag in pcDNA3.1/hygromycin was transfected into PS120 fibroblasts stably expressing NHERF2 (21Cha B. Tse M. Yun C. Kovbasnjuk O. Mohan S. Hubbard A. Arpin M. Donowitz M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2661-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Cells stably transfected with NHE3 (NHE3 wild type and mutants) were selected by an H+ selection procedure consisting of exposure to 50 mm NH4Cl/saline solution for 1 h, followed by an isotonic 2 mm Na+ solution for 1 h, as described previously (22Levine S.A. Nath S.K. Yun C.H. Yip J.W. Montrose M. Donowitz M. Tse C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13716-13725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Surviving cells were placed in normal culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4.5 g/liter glucose, 584 mg/ml l-glutamine, 110 mg/ml sodium pyruvate, and 10% FBS) with hygromycin and G418 to maintain selection pressure and allowed to reach 30–50% confluence. The H+ selection process was initially repeated every 2–3 days until more than 50% of the cells survived and was then repeated weekly thereafter. Rosetta 2 (DHE-3) cells grown in Luria broth (LB) medium were used to express His6-tagged fusion proteins using 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for induction. Crude cell extracts were prepared from culture pellets by breaking the cells in a microfluidizer. Lysates were loaded on columns packed with a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. The column was washed five times with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 300 mm NaCl and eluted in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl and 250 mm imidazole (protocol modified from Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue demonstrating a single predominant band for each protein (supplemental Fig. 2). PI(4,5)P2, PI(3,4,5)P3, or PI lipid vesicles were prepared with 30 mol % phosphatidylcholine, 17 mol % phosphatidylserine, 20 mol % phosphatidylethanolamine, 24.75 mol % phosphatidylinositol (PI) and 8.25 mol % PI(3,4,5)P3, PI(4,5)P2 or additional PI (in control experiments). Vesicles with serial dilutions of PI(4,5)P2, PI(3,4,5)P3, or PI were prepared by altering molar concentrations of PI with respect to PI(4,5)P2 or PI(3,4,5)P3, keeping the total molar concentration at 100 mol %. The lipids were dried in a speed vacuum and rehydrated using bath sonication in 250 μl of 0.2 m sucrose, 20 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.01% sodium azide. 150 of ng of test proteins (F1, F2, F3, F4, and point mutations) were mixed with 100 μl of PI(3,4,5)P3, PI(4,5)P2, or PI vesicles in 900 μl of liposomal reaction buffer (containing 0.12 m NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mg/ml BSA, and 0.75 mm fresh DTT) and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The 1000-μl mixture was then ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min in a Beckman Ti70.1 rotor. The supernatant was removed by fine tip vacuum suction, and the pellet thus obtained was resuspended in NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) preheated at 60 °C and bath-sonicated for 10 min at room temperature. 35 μl of sample was separated on 14% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose for immunoblot analysis. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and 0.15 m NaCl) for 1 h. Blots were then incubated with primary antibodies (where indicated: anti-His (1:5000); anti-HA (1:1000); anti VSVG (1:100)) in 5% milk/PBS for 1 h at room temperature and then washed with 0.05% Tween/PBS three times for 10 min each. The blots were incubated with fluorescently labeled secondary antibody goat anti-mouse IRDye 800 at 1:15,000 (Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA) for 1 h. Finally, blots were washed three times for 10 min each with 0.05% Tween/PBS, and bands were visualized by the Odyssey system (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). The transfected PS120 cells were grown to a confluence of ∼70% on glass coverslips and then placed in serum-free medium for 4–5 h to arrest cell division. The Na+/H+ exchanger activity of these cells was measured fluorometrically by using the intracellular pH-sensitive dye 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester (21Cha B. Tse M. Yun C. Kovbasnjuk O. Mohan S. Hubbard A. Arpin M. Donowitz M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2661-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The experiments were performed under basal, stimulated (10% dialyzed serum), and inhibited conditions (100 nm wortmannin). To study the effect of serum, PS120 cells were incubated with NH4Cl medium with 10% serum for 20 min at 37 °C. This was followed by sequential perfusion with tetramethylammonium and Na+ media containing 10% serum as described previously (22Levine S.A. Nath S.K. Yun C.H. Yip J.W. Montrose M. Donowitz M. Tse C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13716-13725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Study of the wortmannin effect was by adding 100 nm wortmannin to NH4Cl medium and incubating for 45 min at 37 °C followed by perfusion with tetramethylammonium and Na+ media. Na+/H+ exchange rates (H+ efflux) were calculated as the product of buffering capacity at each pHi and Na+-dependent change in pHi and were analyzed using data analysis software Origin (Microcal), by which data are fit to a general allosteric model as described by the Hill equation. In all experiments, Vmax and K′ (H+)i values were calculated. Means ± S.E. were calculated from kinetic parameters from at least five different experiments for each condition. The transfected PS120 cells were grown to 70–80% confluence in 10-cm Petri dishes. The cells were then serum-starved for 4–5 h. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline three times (150 mm NaCl and 20 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) and subsequently once in borate buffer (1 mm boric acid, 154 mm NaCl, 7.2 mm KCl, and 1.8 mm CaCl2, pH 9.0). The surface labeling of NHE3 was done by incubating cells with 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-SS biotin (21Cha B. Tse M. Yun C. Kovbasnjuk O. Mohan S. Hubbard A. Arpin M. Donowitz M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2661-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) for 20 min and repeated once. Post-labeling, the cells were washed three times with quenching buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 120 mm NaCl) to scavenge the unreacted biotin. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized with N+ lysis buffer (60 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 5 mm Na3EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, and 1% Triton X-100). The lysates were then incubated with streptavidin-agarose beads for 4 h. After precipitation of the streptavidin-agarose complex, the supernatant was recovered and called the intracellular fraction. The avidin-agarose beads were washed in N+ buffer six times. For recovering the plasma membrane NHE3, the streptavidin-agarose beads were resuspended in loading buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol), boiled for 5 min at 70 °C, and separated on 10% SDS-PAGE. The size-fractionated gel was then transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose. After blocking for 1 h in 5% non-fat milk, the blots were probed with monoclonal anti-HA antibody. Western analysis and quantification of the surface fraction were performed using Odyssey software (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE), as described previously (23Sarker R. Grønborg M. Cha B. Mohan S. Chen Y. Pandey A. Litchfield D. Donowitz M. Li X. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 3859-3870Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As shown in Table 1, in our studies with WT and mutant NHE3, the total expression of mutations was normalized to the WT expression level, which was set at 100% in each experiment. All numerical data are expressed as means ± S.E., and Student's t tests were used to calculate significance of difference between experimental groups. We hypothesized that the NHE3 C-terminal regulatory domain binds phosphoinositides, and we performed a bioinformatics analysis of the amino acid composition of the NHE3 C terminus using Scansite. A region in the NHE3 C-terminal domain, consisting of amino acids 502–516, was predicted by Scansite to be a candidate for lipid binding. This was not predicted by several other bioinformatics programs. This was conserved across species of NHE3. This region (Fig. 1A) has an estimated isoelectric point of 10 and contains clusters of positively charged and aromatic amino acids. The bioinformatics programs PFAM, ProSite, and Smart data bases did not identify any putative lipid binding domains in the NHE3 C terminus (specific searches for pleckstrin homology, Phox homology, FYVE (Fab-1, YGL023, Vps27, and EEA1), C1, C2, BAR (Bin, amphiphysin, Rvs), GLUE (GRAM-like ubiquitin-binding in EAP45), FERM (band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin), CLAM (clathrin assembly lymphoid myeloid), and GRAM (glucosyltransferases, Rab-like GTPase activators, and myotubularins) domains were performed). This made it unlikely that such domains were involved in any NHE3-plasma membrane lipid interactions leaving the possibility of charge and hydrophobicity based interactions in the area predicted by Scansite. Therefore, as a first step we determined whether the NHE3 C terminus, including the amino acids predicted to bind lipids by Scansite (amino acids 502–516), bound PI(4,5)P2 or PI(3,4,5)P3. To experimentally test whether the NHE3 C terminus directly binds phosphoinositides and where that binding occurs, we used liposomal pulldown assays with 150 ng of NHE3 C-terminal His6 fusion proteins (∼10 nm) and artificial liposomes (Fig. 2A). The F1 fragment of the NHE3 C terminus (amino acids 475–589) bound to liposomes containing either PI(3,4,5)P3 (Fig. 2B) or PI(4,5)P2 (Fig. 2C). No binding to PI(4,5)P2 or PI(3,4,5)P3 occurred with 150 ng of C-terminal fragments of NHE3 F2 (amino acids 590–667), F3 (amino acids 668–747), or F4 (amino acids 748–832). Binding to F1 was saturable for PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(4,5)P2. Both phosphoinositides had similar K50 values of 1.3 mol % for PI(3,4,5)P3 and 1.6 mol % for PI(4,5)P2 as shown in Fig. 3.FIGURE 3NHE3-F1 fusion protein binds to liposomes containing PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(4,5)P2 in a saturable manner. A, liposomal pulldowns assays performed with 150 ng of F1 protein and liposomes containing varied amounts of PI(3,4,5)P3. The makeup of the liposomes was set at 100 mol % by replacing mol % of PI(3,4,5)P3 by the same mol % PI. His6-tagged NHE3 F1 was identified by Western blot analysis of the pulldown by anti-His6 antibody, and the intensity of bands was quantified by Odyssey system (LI-COR). B, binding curve based on intensity values (y axis) versus PI(3,4,5)P3 in mol % (x axis). Background intensity due to F1 protein binding in absence of PI(3,4,5)P3 was subtracted from all data points in calculating kinetics of binding. All experiments were done three times, and the curve representing means ± S.E. calculated from data points of three different experiments is shown. Saturation (max) and K50 were calculated using Origin software.

Further studies explored how the F1 domain bound to PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(4,5)P2 and the functional consequences of that binding. Phosphoinositides bind to sites containing positively charged and aromatic amino acids (1Rosenhouse-Dantsker A. Logothetis D.E. Pflugers Arch. 2007; 455: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). By sequence analysis, we identified four putative binding motifs in the F1 region of NHE3 (amino acids 475–589), which contain clusters of positive charges and were conserved across species of NHE3 (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1A, these clusters were located C-terminal to the putative calcineurin homologous protein binding area of NHE3, which we predicted by homology to the NHE1 calcineurin homologous protein-binding site, the structure of which had been solved (24Donowitz M. Mohan S. Zhu C.X. Chen T.E. Lin R. Cha B. Zachos N.C. Murtazina R. Sarker R. Li X. J. Exp. Biol. 2009; 212: 1638-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 25Landau M. Herz K. Padan E. Ben-Tal N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37854-37863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). One of these positively charged amino acid clusters (Arg520/Arg527) has previously been shown to be involved in the direct binding of the cytoskeletal linking protein ezrin to the NHE3 C terminus (21Cha B. Tse M. Yun C. Kovbasnjuk O. Mohan S. Hubbard A. Arpin M. Donowitz M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2661-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A second motif (Tyr501/Arg503/Lys505) is immediately adjacent to His499, which had been shown by mutagenesis to be part of the NHE3 intracellular pH sensor (26Cha B. Oh S. Shanmugaratnam J. Donowitz M. Yun C.C. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 191: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To determine whether any of these conserved areas of clustered positively charged amino acids contributed to the interaction of NHE3 with PI(3 ,4,5)P3 and/or PI(4,5)P2, we individually mutated at least two positive charges in each cluster. In several instances, we also mutated an aromatic amino acid in the region. His6 fusion proteins of the mutated F1 domains were studied for phosphoinositide binding, and the same mutations were made in full-length NHE3 and expressed in PS120/NHERF2 cells for Na+/H+ exchange activity measurements. Table 1 lists the mutations that were made in these domains with arginine or lysine being generally mutated to an alanine or leucine except for R520F/R527F, a mutation that had previously been shown to reduce direct ezrin binding to NHE3 (21Cha B. Tse M. Yun C. Kovbasnjuk O. Mohan S. Hubbard A. Arpin M. Donowitz M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2661-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Liposomal pulldown assays with purified mutant F1 domains confirmed binding of wild type NHE3 to liposomes containing PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(4,5)P2. In contrast, the NHE3 F1 point mutants Y501A/R503A/K505A, F509A/R511A/R512A, R551L/R552L, and combination mutation Y501A/R503A/K505A + F509A/R511A/R512A showed loss of phosphoinositide binding. Mutation R520F/R527F displayed greater loss of PI(3,4,5)P3 (68.1%) binding than PI(4,5)P2 binding (23.3%). In contrast, the F1-R511L/R512L mutant exhibited increased binding to both PI(3,4,5)P3- and PI(4,5)P2-containing liposomes (Fig. 4, A–D). The function of PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 binding on NHE3 transport activity was studied in PS120/NHERF2 cells transfected with wild type NHE3 and full-length NHE3 mutated to contain the same point mutations listed in Table 1. Kinetic constants of WT NHE3 activity were compared with the mutants under basal, serum-stimulated, and wortmannin-inhibited conditions (Fig. 5, A–H, Table 1, and supplemental Table 1). All mutants with altered phosphoinositide binding displayed lower basal activity. This was true for both Vmax and K′(H+)i. Those mutants with decreased phosphoinositide binding had decreased or absent serum stimulation of NHE3 activity. In contrast, the single mutant with increased PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(4,5)P2 binding (R511L/R512L) had increased serum stimulation of NHE3 activity. Under basal conditions, WT NHE3 (Fig. 5, A and H, Table 1, and supplemental Table 1) had transport activity of 818 ± 72 μm/s (Vmax) and K′ (H+)i of 0.36 ± 0.03 μm. NHE3 responded to serum with the following: (i) 75% increase in Vmax, 1431 ± 171 μm/s, p < 0.05 and (ii) K′(H+)i change to 0.19 ± 0.06 μm, p < 0.05 (increased sensitivity to H+). Wortmannin-inhibited basal NHE3 activity was as follows: 50% inhibition of Vmax, 409 ± 43 μm/s, p < 0.005, and (ii) K′(H+)i change to 0.46 ± 0.01 μm, p < 0.05. (p values are in comparison with basal activity.) As an example of the changes in the mutants compared with wild type NHE3, Y501A/R503A/K505A, which does not bind PI(4,5)P2 or PI(3,4,5)P3, had the following: (i) lower basal activity (basal activity Vmax, 297 ± 45 μm/s, and K′(H+)i, 0.70 ± 0.11 μm), and (ii) no change in activity when exposed to serum or wortmannin (serum Vmax, 310 ± 25 μm/s, NS, K′(H+)i, 0.68 ± 0.06 μm, NS, and wortmannin Vmax, 360 ± 61 μm/s, NS, K′(H+)i, 0.72 ± 0.03 μm, NS) (Fig. 5, B and H, Table 1, and supplemental Table 1). The meaning of changes in basal transport is commented on under “Discussion.” As the bioinformatic analysis from Scansite predicted, Phe509 and two positive charges in the same amino acid cluster were important for phosphoinositide binding. As shown in Fig. 4, mutant F509A/R511A/R512A lost PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(4,5)P2 binding. This mutant displayed lower serum stimulation (55 ± 2.6%), which was significantly different from WT serum stimulation (75 ± 4.3% p < 0.05). In addition, this mutation had a wortmannin inhibitory response (68% inhibition ± 1.9%), which was significantly increased compared with WT wortmannin response (50 ± 5.4%, p < 0.01). Basal Vmax, 452 ± 60 μm/s, serum Vmax, 701 ± 12 μm/s, p < 0.05, wortmannin Vmax, 145 ± 14 μm/s, p < 0.05, K′(H+)i basal, 0.37 ± 0.07 μm, K′(H+)i serum 0.29 ± 0.03 μm, NS; K′(H+)i wortmannin, 0.62 ± 0.02 μm, p < 0.05 (Fig. 5, C and H, Table 1, and supplemental Table 1). To determine whether the effect of mutations Y501A/R503A/K505A and F509A/R511A/R512A acted on similar or different pathways, a combination of both mutations was expressed in PS120 cells. This combination double mutant compared with WT had lower basal activity (Vmax, 277 ± 86 μm/s, and K′(H+)i, 0.49 ± 0.07 μm) and no change in activity when exposed to serum or wortmannin (serum Vmax, 248 ± 28 μm/s, NS, K′(H+)i 0.45 ± 0.11 μm, NS and wortmannin Vmax, 199 ± 13 μm/s, NS, K′(H+)i, 0.41 ± 0.08 μm, NS). Thus, this combination mutation mimics Y501A/"
https://openalex.org/W2058958130,"In most mammalian cells, the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) is nuclear rather than cytoplasmic, regardless of its cognate ligand, retinoic acid (RA). In testis Sertoli cells, however, RAR is retained in the cytoplasm and moves to the nucleus only when RA is supplied. This led us to identify a protein that regulates the translocation of RAR. From yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified a novel RAR-interacting protein called CART1 (cytoplasmic adaptor for RAR and TR). Systematic interaction assays using deletion mutants showed that the C-terminal CoRNR box of CART1 was responsible for the interaction with the NCoR binding region of RAR and TR. Such interaction was impaired in the presence of ligand RA, as further determined by GST pulldown assays in vitro and immunoprecipitation assays in vivo. Fluorescence microscopy showed that unliganded RAR was captured by CART1 in the cytoplasm, whereas liganded RAR was liberated and moved to the nucleus. Overexpression of CART1 blocked the transcriptional repressing activity of unliganded apoRAR, mediated by corepressor NCoR in the nucleus. CART1 siRNA treatment in a mouse Sertoli cell line, TM4, allowed RAR to move to the nucleus and blocked the derepressing function of CART1, suggesting that CART1 might be a cytoplasmic, testis-specific derepressor of RAR.

The NR superfamily, which shares a common structural organization composed of distinct domains, is classified into three groups, steroid hormone receptors, non-steroid hormone receptors, and orphan receptors. One of the major regulatory effects of NRs can be achieved by a change in subcellular location in response to various cellular factors. Steroid hormone receptors, such as glucocorticoid receptor and estrogen receptor, reside in the cytoplasm in association with heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) but on the entry of their cognate ligands dissociate from Hsp90 and translocate to the nucleus to exert transcriptional activation (3Yamashita S.

However, non-steroid hormone receptors, such as RAR and TR, reside solely in the nucleus regardless of their ligands in most mammalian cells. In the absence of ligands, these receptors transverse the nuclear membrane and associate with nuclear corepressors, such as nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR1) or silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT or NCoR2) to mediate transcriptional repression (7Hörlein A.J. Näär A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Söderström M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar, 8Chen J.D.

These corepressors then recruit histone deacetylase, resulting in histone deacetylaton, chromatin compaction, and silencing of target gene expression (9Nagy L. Kao H.Y. Chakravarti D. Lin R.J.

Despite significant progress in understanding nuclear regulation of RAR and TR, little is known about their regulation in the cytoplasm. A few reports have suggested that TRs (TRα1 and TRβ1) actively shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm and that the ligand promotes cytoplasm-to-nucleus shuttling (13Bunn C.F. Neidig J.A.

Steroids. 2008; 73: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In some Sertoli cell lines derived from mouse testis, RARα is ordinarily located in the cytoplasm and rapidly moves to the nucleus in response to its ligand RA (15Akmal K.M. Dufour J.M. Vo M. Higginson S. Kim K.H. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1239-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 16Braun K.W. Tribley W.A. Griswold M.D. Kim K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4145-4151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In both cases, ligands are required for the promotion of nuclear translocation. However, it is largely unknown what cellular factor(s) is responsible for the cytoplasmic retention of TRs and RARα in the absence of the ligands. Recently, Rab11-FIP3 (also known as arfophilin and eferin) was identified by a yeast two-hybrid screen as an effector protein of Rab11 and ADP-ribosylation factor ARF5/6, both of which are members of the small GTPase family that functions in endosomal recycling and intracellular membrane trafficking (17Shin O.H.

In particular, Rab11 plays an essential role in protein recycling from endosomes to the plasma membrane (20Ullrich O. Reinsch S. Urbé S. Zerial M. Parton R.G. J. Cell. Biol. 1996; 135: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). Similarly, ARFs are key regulators of membrane trafficking and the actin cytoskeleton. FIP3 simultaneously interacts with Rab11 and ARF GTPases. This interaction is mediated by a highly conserved Rab11-binding domain (RBD) located at the C-terminal end of FIP3 (18Prekeris R. Davies J.M. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38966-38970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 21Shiba T. Koga H. Shin H.W. Kawasaki M. Kato R. Nakayama K.

Biol. 2006; 364: 121-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), which is also important for ARF5 binding (23Schonteich E. Pilli M. Simon G.C. Matern H.T. Junutula J.R. Sentz D. Holmes R.K. Prekeris R. Eur. J. Cell. Biol. 2007; 86: 417-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Recently, structural studies revealed that two Rab11 molecules bind to dyad symmetrical sites at the C terminus of a FIP3 dimer (21Shiba T. Koga H. Shin H.W. Kawasaki M. Kato R. Nakayama K. Wakatsuki S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 15416-15421Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 22Eathiraj S. Mishra A. Prekeris R. Lambright D.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 121-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Additionally, the amphiphilic α-helix of FIP3-Rab11 binding domain at the C terminus raises the possibility that FIP3 may accommodate binding partners other than Rab11 and ARF5/6. In this study we identified Rab11-FIP3 as a novel RAR binding partner using a yeast two-hybrid system. Subsequently, we demonstrated that Rab11-FIP3 interacted with RAR and TR among the NRs tested through its conserved C terminus. As noted above, Rab11-FIP3 has also been called arfophilin and eferin. Hereinafter, we refer to it as “cytoplasmic adaptor of RAR and TR” (CART1). Extensive in vitro and in vivo assays revealed that CART1 associates with unliganded RAR (and TR) and dissociates from RAR in the presence of ligand. CART1 binding to RAR (and TR) is similar to NCoR binding, but it is different in that CART1 is cytoplasmic, whereas NCoR is nuclear. The RAR binding motif of both CART1 and NCoR is highly conserved, as shown by binding assays with CART1 mutants and competition assays. CART1 overexpression blocks RAR entry into the nucleus and, thus, impairs the transcriptional repressing activity of unliganded RAR, likely mediated by NCoR. In contrast, CART1 knockdown in the mouse Sertoli cell line TM4 resulted in significant augmentation of the repressing potential of RAR. Our findings suggest that CART1 may be a cytoplasmic, testis-specific derepressor of RAR, which could be an additional checkpoint in the fine control of gene expression. NIH3T3 and TM4 cell were maintained in DMEM medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotic-antimycotic mix (all from Invitrogen). For transcription assays, FBS was pretreated with charcoal. All cDNAs were made according to standard methods and verified by sequencing. The multicopy yeast expression plasmids used in the two-hybrid assays were pBTM116 and pASV3 (24Kim E.J. Park J.S. Um S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32020-32028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The human CART1 full-length cDNA was kindly provided as a KIAA clone (KIAA0665) by the Kazusa DNA Research Institute (Japan). Deletion and point mutants of CART1 were created by PCR amplification and subcloned into the pBTM116 or pASV3 vectors. FLAG (2×)-tagged cTRβ, mRARβ, and CART1 genes were inserted in the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). Green fluorescence protein (GFP)- and red fluorescence protein (HcRed)-tagged constructs were inserted into pEGFP-C3 and pHcRed (BD Biosciences), respectively. For GST-fused CART1, pGEX2T (Amersham Biosciences) was used. A human HeLa cDNA library in the prey plasmid pACT2 (BD Biosciences) was screened for proteins that interact with the ligand binding domain (DEF region) of hRARα using the yeast reporter strain L40. The experimental procedures were the same as those previously described (25Cho Y.S. Kim E.J. Park U.H. Sin H.S. Um S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17588-17598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), except that the ligand all-trans retinoic acid (AtRA) was omitted. To map the interaction domains in CART1, deletion derivatives of CART1 were fused with the VP16 AD by subcloning into pASV3. To determine the specificity of the interaction, other NR family members, including RXRα, estrogen receptor α, glucocorticoid receptor, and TRβ, were subcloned into pBTM116. The resulting VP16 AD-CART1 fusion vectors were co-introduced with the pBTM116 derivatives encoding the LexA DBD-NR fusion proteins into L40 cells. The level of interaction was determined by quantitative β-galactosidase assays. A GST fusion of CART1 (amino acids 699–756) was purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) by standard methods. Indicated NR proteins were in vitro translated in 50 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega, Madison, WI) supplemented with [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences). For competition assays, a fragment of NCoR1 (amino acids 1953–2440) was synthesized. Other experimental procedures have been described previously (26Park J.S. Kim E.J. Kwon H.J. Hwang E.S. Namkoong S.E. Um S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6764-6769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 27Kim E.J. Park J.S. Um S.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5356-5367Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The bound proteins were eluted by boiling in sample buffer for 5 min and visualized by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. After transfection with the indicated plasmid DNA using the Lipofectamine plus reagent (Invitrogen), NIH3T3 cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and cell lysates were prepared by adding 1 ml of TEN-modified buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Lysates were precleared by preincubation with protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 15 min and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with beads and a 1:200 dilution of anti-RARα antibody (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Beads were then washed once with TEN and twice with PBS, and the immune complexes were released from the beads by boiling in sample buffer for 5 min. After electrophoresis on 10% SDS-PAGE, immunoprecipitated products were analyzed by Western blotting (WB) using anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (F-3165; Sigma; 1:1000). The endogenous interaction between RARα and CART1 in TM4 cells was determined by IP with anti-CART1 antibody (rabbit polyclonal serum against amino acids 206–719 of human CART1) and subsequent WB with anti-RARα antibody. For control, IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used. NIH3T3 cells seeded on coverslips were transfected with pEGFP-C3 for GFP-CART1 and pHcRed-C1 for HcRed-mRARβ (or cTRβ). One day later cells were treated with 1 μm AtRA (or T3) and incubated for 24 h. Cells were then washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After treatment with 10 μl of VectaShield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus Optical Co.). DAPI (1 μg/ml; Sigma) was used to localize chromosomal DNA in the nucleus. To locate endogenous RARα, either NIH3T3 or TM4 cells was fixed with paraformaldehyde and permeabilized for 10 min at 4 °C in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. After washing, cells were blocked for 60 min in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin and then incubated for 2 h with rabbit anti-RARα polyclonal antibody (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted in blocking buffer. Cells were then incubated with Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h in the dark, mounted with VectaShield, and observed by fluorescence microscopy. NIH3T3 cells were seeded in a 12-well culture plate. Transient transfections were performed using the Lipofectamine plus reagent (Invitrogen) with an RARα expression vector, RARE-tk-Luciferase reporter, and SV40-driven β-galactosidase expression vector as an internal control. Then, 4 h after transfection, cells were washed, fed with 5% charcoal-striped medium, and incubated for an additional 16 h. Depending on the experimental conditions, 1 μm AtRA was added. Cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS, collected, resuspended in 50 μl of luciferase lysis buffer (Promega), and subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles. Luciferase activity was measured by adding 20 μl of luciferin into 30 μl of cell lysate and using an analytical luminescence luminometer according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). The β-galactosidase activity was determined in 96-well plates using a microplate reader at 405 nm. The luciferase activity was normalized to the β-galactosidase activity. TM4 cells were transfected with control siRNA or CART1-specific siRNA for knockdown. Total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA (1.5 μg) was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using oligo(dT)6 primers (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (RT; Invitrogen). RT products were amplified by PCR using the following primer pairs: for RARβ2, forward, 5′-TTGTGTTCACCTTTGCCAAC-3′, and reverse, 5′-CGGTTCCTCAAGGTCCTGG-3′; for GAPDH, forward, 5′-CGGCTACCACATCCAAGGAA-3′, and reverse, 5′-AGCCACATCGCTCAGACACC-3′. The expression levels were normalized using GAPDH as an internal standard in each well. Relative expression (%) was defined as the variation relative to control. The sequences of the custom siRNA duplex (Stealth system, Invitrogen) for mouse CART1 were as follows: sense, 5′-UUAUUCUCCUGUUCCUCACUGAGCC-3′, and antisense, 5′-GGCUCAGUGAGGAACAGGAGAAUAA-3′. The siRNA duplex control used was the Stealth RNAi Negative Control with medium GC content (Invitrogen). Transfection of the siRNAs into TM4 cells was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 in Opti-MEM I reduced-serum medium (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In independent experiments, transfection efficiency was assessed to be greater than 80% using fluorescein-labeled siRNA (Invitrogen). Knockdown of mouse CART1 was verified by WB using an anti-CART1 antibody. In most mammalian cells, RAR and TR are nuclear rather than cytoplasmic regardless of their cognate ligands. However, some studies have demonstrated that RAR and TR are retained in the cytoplasm and move to the nucleus when ligands are supplied (13Bunn C.F. Neidig J.A. Freidinger K.E. Stankiewicz T.A.

In particular, we also found that RARα shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus in the Sertoli cell line TM4 in response to AtRA (Fig. 1A). However, it is largely unknown what cellular factor(s) is responsible for the cytoplasmic retention of TRs and RARα. To identify such a factor(s), we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a HeLa cDNA library using the ligand binding domain (or DEF) of hRARα as bait. From the screen, we isolated 101 clones that were His gene-positive and showed high β-galactosidase activity. Plasmids from these clones were recovered and sequenced. GenBankTM search results indicated 8 NCoR1, 13 NCoR2, 63 CART1, and 17 RXR with overlapping sequences (Fig. 1B). Of these, RXR is a heterodimer partner of RAR, and NCoRs have been reported as corepressors of RAR and TR (7Hörlein A.J. Näär A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y.

Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar), indicating that our screen was reliable. Most of the clones were found to be CART1 (also known as Rab11-FIP3, arfophilin, and eferin), which is expected to have a role in protein recycling and the actin cytoskeleton (17Shin O.H. Ross A.H.

Like the NCoR-RARα interaction, CART1 strongly interacts with RARα, and the interaction is abolished in the presence of AtRA (Fig. 1C). Subsequent yeast two-hybrid assays indicated that CART1 interacted with TRβ among the NR members tested (Fig. 1D). CART1 also interacted with other isoforms of RARα and TRβ with comparable binding affinities (data not shown). This property of CART1 is similar to that of NCoR, suggesting that CART1 may contain a conserved CoRNR box that has been identified as a RAR/TR binding motif in NCoRs (28Hu X. Lazar M.A. Nature. 1999; 402: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 29Perissi V. Staszewski L.M. McInerney E.M. Kurokawa R. Krones A. Rose D.W. Lambert M.H. Milburn M.V. Glass C.K.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3209-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). In fact, we found two putative CoRNR boxes at amino acid residues 621–629 and 734–742 (Fig. 1B). To map the RAR/TR-interacting domain in CART1, genes for its deletion derivatives were placed in the pASV3 vector. Subsequent yeast two-hybrid assays indicated that the region bounded by amino acids 721–756 was the minimal domain that was necessary and sufficient for binding to RARα and TRβ (Fig. 2A). As expected, the interaction was diminished in the presence of ligands AtRA for RARα and T3 for TRβ. The amino acid sequences of two putative CoRNR boxes of CART1 were compared with those of NCoR1 and NCoR2, where the consensus sequence corresponding to the CoRNR box is (L/I)XX(I/V)IXXXL (Fig. 2B). The amino acid alignment indicated that the C-terminal CoRNR box of CART1 was well conserved in mammals (data not shown). To determine which amino acid residues in that region are critical for the interaction with RAR and TR, eight point mutants were generated by PCR and subcloned into pASV3. As shown in Fig. 2C, one mutant (M5) with AA substitutions from two central isoleucines was defective in RAR/TR binding. These isoleucines are well conserved in the CoRNR boxes of NCoR1 and NCoR2, suggesting that CART1 and NCoRs share a common binding motif for RAR and TR binding. To map the CART1-interacting domain in RARα and TRβ, deletion mutants of RARα and TRβ were fused to the LexA DBD using the pBTM116 vector and assayed for interaction with Gal4 AD-CART1 (amino acids 575–756) in yeast L40. For comparison, Gal4 AD-NCoR1 (1953–2440) and Gal4 AD-NCoR2 (2141–2517) were used. The interaction of NCoR with RAR and TR has been shown to require a conserved sequence lying within the α-helix H1 of the ligand binding domain (DEF or DE) (7Hörlein A.J. Näär A.M. Heinzel T.

Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Like NCoR1 and NCoR2, CART1 failed to interact with RARα and TRβ when helix H1, corresponding to the D3 region in Fig. 3, was removed (compare DEF and D3EF with EF for RAR and DE and D3E with E for TR; Fig. 3). The C-terminal deletion of helix H12 containing AF-2 AD core, as shown by the dominant negative, had little effect on the constitutive interaction with CART1 but abolished the ligand-dependent decrease of the CART1-RARα and CART1-TRβ interactions. CART1 also interacted with v-erbα, a viral version of TR defective in AF-2 AD without ligand effect (data not shown). A similar pattern of the interaction was observed for NCoR1 and NCoR2. Thus, these results suggest that helix H1 (or the D3 region) of RAR or TR is required for CART1 interaction, whereas helix H12 (or AF-2 AD) is dispensable for the interaction but essential for ligand-dependent disruption of the interaction. Combined, our mapping data indicate that the CART1 interaction mode with apo (unliganded) and holo (liganded) RARα and TRβ is reminiscent of the NCoR mode, with the same or very similar binding surfaces. For GST pulldown assays, GST-fused CART1 (amino acids 699–756: containing the second CoRNR box) was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and mixed separately with in vitro translated, 35S-labeled mRARβ or cTRβ. Consistent with the yeast two-hybrid data, the 35S-labeled mRAR or cTR was retained by CART1 in the absence of the cognate ligand, and the retention was abrogated in the presence of ligand (Fig. 4, A and B). To verify the functional relevance of CART1 and NCoR binding to RAR and TR, competition assays were performed using GST-CART1, synthesized 35S-cTRβ or cTRβ, and unlabeled NCoR1 (amino acids 1953–2440). As the amounts of NCoR1 increased, CART1 binding to apoRAR or apoTR decreased (Fig. 4, C and D), suggesting that NCoR1 competes with CART1 for RAR or TR binding, likely due to close similarity in binding surfaces between NCoR1 and CART1. The endogenous interaction between RARα and CART1 in TM4 cells was demonstrated by IP with anti-CART1 antibody and subsequent WB using anti-RARα antibody (Fig. 4E). Other co-IP assays in NIH3T3 cells using exogenously expressed FLAG-tagged human full-length CART1 or the C-terminal deletion (CART1ΔC) further emphasized that the C-terminal region of CART1 is essential for RARα interaction in vivo (Fig. 4F). In both IPs, the interactions were disrupted in the presence of AtRA. These in vitro and in vivo findings confirmed the interaction observed in yeast, further emphasizing that both CART1 and NCoR share a common motif for binding to apoRAR (and apoTR). Our data showed that CART1 associated with apoRAR or apoTR and dissociated from the complex in the presence of ligand. Next, we examined the effect of the interaction on the subcellular localization of RAR. Previous studies have indicated that RAR is predominantly nuclear in most mammalian cells (33Baumann C.T.

To determine the effect of CART1 on the subcellular localization of RAR in living cells, we appended the GFP to human CART1 and the HcRed to mouse RARβ for fluorescence microscopy. When HcRed-RAR alone was expressed in NIH3T3 cells, RAR was nuclear (Fig. 5A). However, when both were transfected, RAR moved to the cytoplasm together with CART1 (Fig. 5B). Upon AtRA treatment, RAR was released from CART1, and RAR translocated to the nucleus, whereas CART1 remained in the cytoplasm. Similar subcellular distribution and ligand effects were observed when HcR"

Binding of the other human glycoprotein hormones to their cognate human receptors (luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR)) was expected to be similar. This study focuses on amino acid residues in β-strands 2 (Lys(74)), 4 (Tyr(124), Asn(129), and Thr(130)), and 5 (Asp(150) and Asp(153)) of the FSHR ECD identified in the human FSH·FSHR ECD crystal structure as contact sites with the common glycoprotein hormone α-subunit, and on noncontact residues in β-strands 2 (Ser(78)) and 8 (Asp(224) and Ser(226)) as controls. These nine residues are either invariant or highly conserved in LHR and TSHR. Mutagenesis and functional characterization of these residues in all three human receptors allowed an assessment of their contribution to binding and receptor activation. Surprisingly, the six reported α-subunit contact residues of the FSHR ECD could be replaced without significant loss of FSH binding, while cAMP signaling potency was diminished significantly with several replacements. Comparative studies of the homologous residues in LHR and TSHR revealed both similarities and differences. The results for FSH/FSHR were analyzed on the basis of the crystal structure of the FSH·FSHR ECD complex, and comparative modeling was used to generate structures for domains, proteins, and complexes for which no structures were available. Although structural information of hormone-receptor interaction allowed the identification of hormone-receptor contact sites, functional analysis of each contact site was necessary to assess its contribution to hormone binding and receptor activation."

The resulting transient increase in cytoplasmic free calcium concentration is a critical trigger for the initiation of such vital responses as muscle contraction and transcription. L-type Ca(v)1.2 calcium channels are complexes of the pore-forming α(1C) subunit associated with cytosolic Ca(v)β subunits. All major Ca(v)βs share a highly homologous membrane associated guanylate kinase-like (MAGUK) domain that binds to α(1C) at the α-interaction domain (AID), a short motif in the linker between transmembrane repeats I and II. In this study we show that Ca(v)β subunits form multimolecular homo- and heterooligomeric complexes in human vascular smooth muscle cells expressing native calcium channels and in Cos7 cells expressing recombinant Ca(v)1.2 channel subunits. Ca(v)βs oligomerize at the α(1C) subunits residing in the plasma membrane and bind to the AID. However, Ca(v)β oligomerization occurs independently on the association with α(1C). Molecular structures responsible for Ca(v)β oligomerization reside in 3 regions of the guanylate kinase subdomain of MAGUK. An augmentation of Ca(v)β homooligomerization significantly increases the calcium current density, while heterooligomerization may also change the voltage-dependence and inactivation kinetics of the channel. Thus, oligomerization of Ca(v)β subunits represents a novel and essential aspect of calcium channel regulation."

Induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in β-cells and vascular myocytes with SERCA inhibitors activates iPLA(2)β, resulting in hydrolysis of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids, by a mechanism that is not well understood. Regulatory proteins interact with iPLA(2)β, including the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIβ, and we have characterized the iPLA(2)β interactome further using affinity capture and LC/electrospray ionization/MS/MS. An iPLA(2)β-FLAG fusion protein was expressed in an INS-1 insulinoma cell line and then adsorbed to an anti-FLAG matrix after cell lysis. iPLA(2)β and any associated proteins were then displaced with FLAG peptide and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Gel sections were digested with trypsin, and the resultant peptide mixtures were analyzed by LC/MS/MS with database searching. This identified 37 proteins that associate with iPLA(2)β, and nearly half of them reside in ER or mitochondria. They include the ER chaperone calnexin, whose association with iPLA(2)β increases upon induction of ER stress. Phosphorylation of iPLA(2)β at Tyr(616) also occurs upon induction of ER stress, and the phosphoprotein associates with calnexin. The activity of iPLA(2)β in vitro increases upon co-incubation with calnexin, and overexpression of calnexin in INS-1 cells results in augmentation of ER stress-induced, iPLA(2)β-catalyzed hydrolysis of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids, reflecting the functional significance of the interaction. Similar results were obtained with mouse pancreatic islets."

https://openalex.org/W2053227231,"The decay of eukaryotic mRNA is triggered mainly by deadenylation, which leads to decapping and degradation from the 5′ end of an mRNA. Poly(A)-binding protein has been proposed to inhibit the decapping process and to stabilize mRNA by blocking the recruitment of mRNA to the P-bodies where mRNA degradation takes place after stimulation of translation initiation. In contrast, several lines of evidence show that poly(A)-binding protein (Pab1p) has distinct functions in mRNA decay and translation in yeast. To address the translation-independent function of Pab1p in inhibition of decapping, we examined the contribution of Pab1p to the stability of non-translated mRNAs, an AUG codon-less mRNA or an mRNA containing a stable stem-loop structure at the 5′-UTR. Tethering of Pab1p stabilized non-translated mRNAs, and this stabilization did not require either the eIF4G-interacting domain of Pab1p or the Pab1p-interacting domain of eIF4G. In a ski2Δ mutant in which 3′ to 5′ mRNA degradation activity is defective, stabilization of non-translated mRNAs by the tethering of Pab1p lacking an eIF4G-interacting domain (Pab1–34Cp) requires a cap structure but not a poly(A) tail. In wild type cells, stabilization of non-translated mRNA by tethered Pab1–34Cp results in the accumulation of deadenylated mRNA. These results strongly suggest that tethering of Pab1p may inhibit the decapping reaction after deadenylation, independent of translation.

The regulation of mRNA decay is an important process in determination of the expression and fate of cellular transcripts. There are two alternative pathways by which polyadenylated mRNAs are degraded, and both are initiated by removal of the 3′ polyadenosine tail (1Decker C.J. Parker R. Trends Biochem.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1497-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence show that dissociation of the ribosome is a prerequisite for mRNA decapping in yeast. First, the translational initiation rate is inversely proportional to the decapping rate (12Coller J. Parker R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 861-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Second, mRNA decapping can occur efficiently in structures termed P-bodies, which are ribosome-free cellular foci (12Coller J. Parker R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 861-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The mRNAs that are trapped in polysomes as a result of treatment of the cells with cycloheximide are resistant to decapping and are not found in P-bodies (12Coller J. Parker R. Annu. Rev.

Recently, it was reported that both deadenylated and decapped mRNAs are distributed in polysomes (17Hu W. Sweet T.J. Chamnongpol S. Baker K.E. Coller J. Nature. 2009; 461: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), indicating that decapping takes place, whereas the mRNAs are associated with actively translating ribosomes. It has been proposed that endogenous mRNAs are decapped on polysomes and that dissociation of ribosomes from mRNA is not a prerequisite for mRNA decay in yeast (17Hu W. Sweet T.J. Chamnongpol S. Baker K.E. Coller J. Nature. 2009; 461: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Several observations suggest that the ability of the poly(A) tail to inhibit decapping is primarily mediated through the poly(A)-binding protein (Pab1p) in yeast. First, it has been demonstrated that decapping occurs when the poly(A) tail is shortened to approximately the minimum length required for the binding of Pab1p (18Decker C.J. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1632-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 19Brown C.E. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6548-6559Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Second, decapping is uncoupled from deadenylation in pab1 mutant strains (20Caponigro G. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2421-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 21Morrissey J.P. Deardorff J.A. Hebron C. Sachs A.B. Yeast. 1999; 15: 687-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), indicating that the requirement for prior deadenylation before decapping is relieved in the absence of Pab1p. Third, the inhibition of decapping by Pab1p does not require the presence of the poly(A) tail when Pab1p is artificially tethered to the RNA (22Coller J.M. Gray N.K. Wickens M.P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3226-3235Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the poly(A)-binding protein inhibits decapping by several mechanisms, possibly connecting several processes such as translation, turnover, and mRNA localization. Although the inhibitory effects of poly(A)-binding protein on decapping are conserved between humans and yeast (7Wang Z. Jiao X. Carr-Schmid A. Kiledjian M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 12663-12668Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 12Coller J. Parker R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 861-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 23Wilusz C.J. Gao M. Jones C.L. Wilusz J. Peltz S.W. RNA. 2001; 7: 1416-1424PubMed Google Scholar), the mechanism still needs to be elucidated. It has been proposed that Pab1p may inhibit decapping by stimulating translation initiation in yeast (12Coller J. Parker R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 861-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 24Coller J. Parker R. Cell. 2005; 122: 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). In contrast, it was shown that deletion of the translation initiation factor eIF-4G-interacting domain of Pab1p has no effect on the ability of tethered Pab1p to block decapping (22Coller J.M. Gray N.K. Wickens M.P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3226-3235Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). This result suggests that Pab1p inhibits decapping via interactions that are independent of the translation initiation complex. However, it has been shown that Pab1p can stimulate the initiation of translation independent of eIF-4G-interacting domain of Pab1p (25Otero L.J. Ashe M.P. Sachs A.B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3153-3163Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 26Kühn U. Wahle E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1678: 67-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is still unclear if Pab1p inhibits decapping in yeast in the absence of translation. To address the translation-independent function of Pab1p in inhibition of mRNA decapping, we examined the contribution of Pab1p to the stability of non-translated mRNAs, an AUG codon-less mRNA or mRNA containing a stable stem-loop structure at the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR). Tethering of Pab1p stabilized non-translated mRNAs, and this stabilization did not require either the eIF4G-interacting domain of Pab1p or the Pab1p-interacting domain of eIF4G. Stabilization of non-translated mRNAs by tethering of Pab1p lacking an eIF4G-interacting domain in a ski2Δ mutant that is defective in 3′ to 5′ degradation pathway requires a cap structure but not a poly(A) tail. These results strongly suggest that tethering of Pab1p may inhibit the decapping reaction independent of translation. We also found that tethered Pab1–34Cp moderately stabilizes non-translated mRNAs in an xrn1Δ mutant that is defective in the 5′ to 3′ degradation pathway in a poly(A) tail-dependent manner. This result suggests that tethered Pab1–34Cp inhibits deadenylation, although the significance of this function is unknown. Based on these results, we propose that Pab1p inhibits the mRNA decapping reaction in yeast in a translation-independent manner in vivo.

The construction of plasmids is described in the supplemental Information. Yeast cells were grown in minimal medium containing 2% galactose. When the culture reached an A600 of 0.6 the cells were harvested and re-suspended in medium containing 2% glucose to inhibit transcription from the GAL1 promoter. At the times indicated, the cells were harvested to prepare RNA samples using the hot phenol. The mRNA levels of reporter genes were determined by Northern blotting using digoxigenin (DIG) 2The abbreviations used are: DIGdigoxigeninFLfull-lengthncRNAnon-coding RNA. reagents and kits to prepare nonradioactive probes by PCR-based nucleic acid labeling. Bound probes were detected according to the procedure specified by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). DIG-labeled MPT4 probes were prepared using the oligonucleotides OTS017 and OIT934. The intensity of bands on the blots was quantified using the LAS3000 mini and Multi-Gauge Version 3.0 (Fuji Film, Japan). The relative product levels were determined by comparison to a standard curve by using the series of dilution of the samples of time 0 just after the addition of glucose. The intensities of bands from the diluted samples were compared with the standard curve, and the mRNA levels relative to the control mRNA was determined. Most decay time courses are presented as straight lines in the half-log plots, but some curves are irregular. We calculated the half-lives listed are based on the slope of the first part of the curves. digoxigenin full-length non-coding RNA. Yeast cells were grown in minimal medium containing 2% galactose. When the culture reached an A600 of 0.6, the cells were harvested. The protein products of FLAG-tagged reporter genes were detected by Western blotting using an anti-FLAG antibody (F1804, Sigma) and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (GE Healthcare). The intensity of the bands on the blots was quantified using a LAS3000 mini and Multi-Gauge Version 3.0 (Fuji Film, Japan), and the intensity of the bands of the diluted samples was compared with that of the standard curve. The relative level of the product in the sample compared with the control product was determined. Yeast cells were grown exponentially at 30 °C in minimal media lacking methionine and cysteine. A 10-ml aliquot of yeast cells was labeled with 5 μCi of a [14C]amino acid mixture (NEG072; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 10 min. Cells were harvested, and cell extracts were prepared using Complete Lysis-Y (Roche Applied Science). Cell extracts were incubated with an anti-FLAG antibody (F1804, Sigma) and protein A-agarose (Roche Applied Science) in IXA-100 buffer (27Inada T. Aiba H. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1584-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), then washed 3 times and eluted with 0.4 mg/ml FLAG peptide. The radioactivities of the immunoprecipitated samples were then measured by liquid scintillation counter (Aloka, Japan). Yeast cells were grown exponentially at 30 °C and were harvested by centrifugation. Cell extracts were prepared as described previously (27Inada T. Aiba H. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1584-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The equivalent of 50 A260 units were then layered onto linear 10–50% sucrose density gradients. Sucrose gradients (10–50% sucrose in 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 70 mm ammonium acetate, 4 mm magnesium acetate) were prepared in 25 × 89-mm polyallomer tubes (Beckman Coulter) using a gradient master. Crude extracts were layered on top of the sucrose gradients and centrifuged at 150,000 × g in a P28S rotor (Hitachi Koki, Japan) for 2.5 h at 4 °C. Gradients were then fractionated (TOWA Laboratory, Tsukuba, Japan). Polysome profiles were generated by continuous absorbance measurement at 254 nm using a single path UV-1 optical unit (ATTO Biomini UV monitor) connected to a chart recorder (ATTO, digital mini-recorder). Equal volume fractions were collected and processed for Northern blotting as described above. To address the translation-independent function of Pab1p in the inhibition of mRNA decapping in yeast, we aimed to construct a reporter gene that did not contain an ATG codon in any reading frame. A search for a gene that would be suitable for this reporter construct revealed that the downstream region of the MPT4 ORF contained only a few ATG codons in all reading frames. We, therefore, used a fragment of the MPT4 gene (nucleotides 385–822; MPT4ΔN) to construct a reporter gene that did not contain any ATG codon in any reading frame (supplemental Fig. 1). The AUG-FLAG-MPT4ΔN reporter gene was constructed by insertion of an ATG codon followed by the FLAG tag sequence upstream of MPT4ΔN. The only internal ATG codon present within MPT4ΔN, at nucleotides 629–631, was eliminated by introduction of a SpeI restriction site. As a control, we constructed the No-AUG-FLAG-MPT4ΔN reporter gene in which the ATG codon of AUG-FLAG-MPT4ΔN was replaced by the TAC codon. To inhibit translation, we inserted a stable stem-loop structure at the UTR of AUG-FLAG-MPT4ΔN yielding the reporter gene SL-AUG-FLAG-MPT4ΔN. It is well known that insertion of such stem-loop structures into the 5′ region of a gene can strongly inhibit translation. These reporter genes were placed under the control of the GAL1 promoter and flanked by the PGK1 3′-UTR, which contains tandem MS2 binding sites that function to tether the MS2-Pab1p fusion protein to mRNA (Fig. 1a). We first confirmed by Western blotting analysis that the mRNA encoded by No-AUG-FLAG-MS2 and SL-AUG-FLAG-MS2 is not translated. As expected, no protein product was detected from either the No-AUG-FLAG-MS2 or the SL-AUG-FLAG-MS2 reporter gene (Fig. 1b, lanes 2 and 3) using conditions under which a protein product could be detected from the AUG-FLAG-MS2 reporter gene (Fig. 1b, lane 1). This result suggested that protein could not be produced or was very poorly produced from the AUG codon. However, there remained a possibility that protein might be synthesized from non-AUG codons including UGG or UUG codons. To detect putative protein products that might be translated from non-AUG codons, we constructed reporter constructs in which the FLAG tag sequence was inserted into the carboxyl-terminal region instead of the amino-terminal region of these reporter genes (Fig. 1c). Western blotting of extracts of cells expressing No-AUG-C-FLAG-MS2 and SL-AUG-C-FLAG-MS2 reporter genes could not detect the expression of FLAG-tagged proteins even in the presence of MG132, a proteasome inhibitor that would be expected to stabilize proteins because of degradation by the proteasome (Fig. 1d, lanes 2, 4, and 6). These results strongly suggest that protein is not synthesized from non-AUG codons. To further confirm that the No-AUG-C-FLAG-MS2 and SL-AUG-C-FLAG-MS2 mRNAs are not translated or are very poorly translated, we performed pulse-label experiments in which synthesized proteins were labeled by pulse-labeling cells with 14C amino acids after which the 14C counts of proteins precipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody were analyzed. The 14C counts that were precipitated from cells expressing No-AUG-C-FLAG-MS2 or SL-AUG-C-FLAG-MS2 reporter mRNA were less than 5% of the counts that were precipitated from cells expressing the control AUG-C-FLAG-MS2 mRNA (Fig. 1e). The combined results strongly suggest that the No-AUG-C-FLAG-MS2 and the SL-AUG-C-FLAG-MS2 mRNAs are not translated or are very poorly translated. To address the translation-independent function of Pab1p in the inhibition of mRNA decapping, we examined the contribution of Pab1p to the stability of the non-translated No-AUG-FLAG-MS2 or SL-AUG-FLAG-MS2 mRNAs. To tether Pab1p to these reporter mRNAs independent of the poly(A) sequence, Pab1p was fused to the MS2 coat protein as previously reported (22Coller J.M. Gray N.K. Wickens M.P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3226-3235Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We also constructed a series of FLAG-MS2-Pab1p deletion mutants to conduct a domain analysis of Pab1p. (Fig. 2a). Before analysis of the effect of these Pab1p constructs on mRNA stability, we first determined the expression levels of these Pab1p constructs by Western blotting using an anti-FLAG antibody. This analysis revealed that the expression level of FLAG-MS2-Pab1–34Cp that lacks the RRM1 and RRM2 domains was 2-fold lower than that of intact FLAG-MS2-Pab1p. The expression level of FLAG-MS2-Pab1-Cp that contains only the carboxyl-terminal region of Pab1p was 2–3-fold higher than that of FLAG-MS2-Pab1p. Importantly, co-expression of FLAG-MS2-Pab1 or its deletion mutants did not induce the production of a protein product from the No-AUG-FLAG-MS2 nor the SL-AUG-FLAG-MS2 reporter genes. In addition, the level of the FLAG-AUG protein produced from the AUG-C-FLAG-MS2 mRNA was not affected by co-expression of the various FLAG-MS2-Pab1p fusion proteins (Fig. 2b, lanes 1, 4, 7, and 10). The effect of Pab1p on the stability of the reporter mRNAs was then determined by measurement of the level of the mRNA that remained in the presence of different Pab1p constructs after inhibition of transcription from the GAL1 promoter by the addition of glucose. The level of mRNA was assayed using Northern blotting. We found that the FLAG-MS2-Pab1p fusion protein stabilized the No-AUG-FLAG-MS2 mRNA by a factor of 5.4 (extending its half-life (t½) from 5 to 27 min; Fig. 3, a and b). A No-AUG-FLAG mRNA that lacked the MS2 sites was slightly, but significantly, stabilized by the expression of FLAG-MS2-Pab1p (extending its half-life (t½) from 5.3 to 9 min; Fig. 3, a and b). Because FLAG-MS2-Pab1p complemented the lethality of the pab1Δ mutation (data not shown), we suspect that the Pab1p unstable stabilizes No-AUG-FLAG mRNA even without tethering of Pab1p when the level of Pab1p is increased. We next analyzed the effect of the Pab1p deletion mutants on the stability of the non-translated mRNA to identify the domains of Pab1p required for mRNA stabilization. The FLAG-MS2-Pab1p fusion protein stabilized No-AUG-FLAG-MS2 mRNA by a factor of 5.4, extending its half-life from 5 to 27 min; Fig. 3, a and b). However, No-AUG-FLAG mRNA was moderately but significantly stabilized when FLAG-MS2-Pab1p was expressed (Fig. 3, a and b). These results indicate that tethered Pab1p stabilizes No-AUG-FLAG-MS2 mRNA, but the stabilization of No-AUG-FLAG-MS2 mRNA is not solely dependent on the MS2 binding sites in the 3′-UTR of reporter mRNAs. The FLAG-MS2-Pab1–34Cp fusion protein stabilized No-AUG-FLAG-MS2 mRNA by a factor of 2.4, extending its half-life from 5 to 12 min; Fig. 3, a and b). No-AUG-FLAG mRNA was not stabilized even when FLAG-MS2-Pab1p-34C was expressed (Fig. 3, a and b). These results clearly indicate that stabilization of No-AUG-FLAG-MS2 mRNA is solely dependent on the MS2 binding sites in the 3′-UTR of reporter mRNAs, and stabilization of No-AUG-FLAG-MS2 mRNA by tethered Pab1p does not require the eIF4G-interacting domain of Pab1p. The No-AUG-FLAG-MS2 mRNA was only slightly stabilized by tethered FLAG-MS2-Pab1–4Cp (Fig. 3, a and b). However, this lack of stabilization cannot be attributed to different expression levels of FLAG-MS2-Pab1–4Cp and FLAG-MS2-Pab1–34Cp (Fig. 2b, lanes 4–6 and 7–9). These results suggest that the RRM3 domain of Pab1p plays an important role in stabilization of non-translated mRNA by tethered Pab1p. The stability of reporter mRNAs with or without MS2 sites in the presence of various Pab1p constructs is summarized in Fig. 3b. We conducted a similar domain analysis of Pab1p to identify the domains required for stabilization of the translated AUG-FLAG-MS2 and AUG-FLAG mRNAs as summarized in Fig. 3c. First, we confirmed that the translated RNA (AUG-FLAG-MS2) is more stable than the non-translated RNA (No-AUG-FLAG-MS2) (Fig. 3, b and c). The FLAG-MS2-Pab1p fusion protein stabilized AUG-FLAG-MS2 mRNA by a factor of 2.3 and extended its t½ from 16 to 36 min (Fig. 3c). AUG-FLAG mRNA lacking the MS2 sequences was not stabilized even when FLAG-MS2-Pab1p was expressed (Fig. 3c). Decay time course is not presented as straight lines in the half-log plots (Fig. 3c, right panel), and we estimate the half-lives based on the slope of the first part of the curves. These results indicate that the stabilization of AUG-FLAG-MS2 mRNA is solely dependent on the MS2 binding sites. The FLAG-MS2-Pab1–34Cp fusion protein stabilized AUG-FLAG-MS2 mRNA by a factor of 2.4 and extended its t½ from 16 to 38 min (Fig. 3c). AUG-FLAG mRNA lacking the MS2 sequences was not stabilized even when FLAG-MS2-Pab1p-34C was expressed (Fig. 3c), indicating that the stabilization of AUG-FLAG-MS2 mRNA is solely dependent on the MS2 binding sites in the 3′-UTR of the reporter mRNA. These results clearly indicate that stabilization of AUG-FLAG-MS2 mRNA by tethered Pab1p does not require the eIF4G-interacting domain of Pab1p and are consistent with previous results which reported that deletion of the eIF-4G interacting domain in Pab1p has no effect on the ability of tethered Pab1p to stabilize translating mRNA (22Coller J.M. Gray N.K. Wickens M.P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3226-3235Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Tethering of FLAG-MS2-Pab1–4Cp or FLAG-MS2-Pab1-Cp also had little effect on the stability of translated mRNA (Fig. 3c). These results suggest that the RRM3 domain of Pab1p plays an important role in the stabilization of translated mRNA as well as of non-translated mRNA by tethered Pab1p. We also found that the FLAG-MS2-Pab1-Cp fusion protein destabilized AUG-FLAG-MS2 mRNA and shortened its t½ from 16 to 8.6 min (Fig. 3c)."

https://openalex.org/W2105222020,"Phosphofructokinase is a sophisticated allosteric enzyme that is fundamental for the control of glycolysis. The structure of the bacterial enzyme is well characterized. However, little is known about the structural organization of the more complex enzyme from mammals. We have obtained the structure of human muscle phosphofructokinase in the presence of fructose 6-phosphate at a resolution of 1.8 nm by electron microscopy (EM). Particles of the tetrameric enzyme corresponded to an elongated molecule (14.5 × 9 nm) arranged into 2 dimeric subdomains. Image analysis and 3-dimensional reconstruction showed the presence of a prominent channel in one of the dimers but not in the opposite one, revealing that they are in greatly different conformations. Fitting of bacterial structures into the EM model suggested disruption of the fructose 6-phosphate catalytic and the fructose 2,6-bisphophate allosteric sites in the cavity-containing dimer. Therefore, the reported structure might have major implications for the function of mammalian phosphofructokinase."
