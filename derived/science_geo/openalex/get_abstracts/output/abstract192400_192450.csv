This statement is based on the observation that in the acid hydrolysate of the polyamine derivative (I, R= NH2) prepared from the polypeptide, by Curtius degradation of the polyhydrazide (I, R= CON2H3) or by Hofmann degradation of the polyamide (I, R= CONH2), only β-formylpropionic acid (II) appears in quantities easily assayable by preparative methods, and no α.γ-diaminobutyric acid was found to be present. Control experiments with synthetic α-polyglutamic acid, on the other hand, readily gave α.γ-diaminobutyric acid (IV) on acid hydrolysis of the degradation product."

An acetic acid buffer (pH 4.5) extract of saffron to which papain was added was taken. The pigment in the extract obtained (after destroying the enzyme papain by heating) was destroyed by addition of 10 ml. of 4 per cent potassium permanganate after adjusting the extract to pH 3.7 with glacial acetic acid. Hydrogen peroxide was added to destroy the excess of permanganate. The filtrate obtained was made up to volume and its fluorescence read on a spectrophotometer. The presence of fluorescing substances other than riboflavine was ruled out because on addition of sodium hydrosulphite solution in 0.2 M disodium phosphate, no fluorescence was observed, which would not have been the case had fluorescent substances other than riboflavine been present in the extract1. By treating an aliquot of the permanganate extract obtained above with alkaline potassium ferrocyanide and isobutyl alcohol, the thiamine was oxidized to thiochrome2 which gets transferred to the isobutyl alcohol layer because of its greater solubility in that solvent. After drying this extract over anhydrous sodium sulphate, readings for thiamine were taken on the spectrophotometer."

https://openalex.org/W1979979514,"THE sporozoite infection-rate of anopheline vectors of malaria dissected upon the day of capture depends upon, among other variables, the proportion which have survived long enough for the completion of the extrinsic cycle of the malaria parasite in them. If wild-caught mosquitoes are kept alive after capture for a period equal to that of the extrinsic cycle, the sporozoite-rate found at the end of this period would represent the proportion with any infection, however immature, at the time of capture. The ratio between the immediate and delayed sporozoite-rates is directly proportional to the chance of survival of the mosquitoes from the time that they receive an infective feed until sporozoites can be found in the salivary glands. The other variables influencing the sporozoite-rate, such as the infectivity of the population, can be ignored as they have -the same effect on the two rates. The pattern of mosquito mortality is thought to be geometric, all age-groups being on average exposed to the same risk of mortality1, so that it is possible to establish a simple mathematical relationship between the daily chance of survival and the ratio between the sporozoite-rates, where p = the probability of a mosquito surviving through one day, and n = period in days for completion of the extrinsic cycle in the mosquito (1 is subtracted from this as the mosquitoes are on average at least one day old at the time of the infective blood meal): whence pcan readily be calculated."

https://openalex.org/W2052347275,"IN blood genetic surveys conducted prior to 1948 on Australian aborigines it was shown1 that these natives possessed the gene Rz, and that its distribution in various Australian States appeared to be patchy. In all, the gene was demonstrated seven times (3 per cent) in 234 aborigines. It was found in natives of Queensland and the Northern Territory, but not in fifty-nine natives of South Australia."

From the analysis of our results, we are able to draw certain conclusions concerning the effect of diuresis on the urinary excretion of radioiodine. The iodine-131 was supplied from Harwell."
https://openalex.org/W2005682742,"THE tails of spermatozoa were generally thought to be radially symmetrical; although Randall and Friedlaender1 have shown that the tails of ram spermatozoa are elliptical and slightly flattened, this may have been due to the drastic treatment necessary for inspection by electron microscopy. Challice2, however, has produced more convincing evidence in the case of the mouse. He cut transverse sections of the spermatozoa tails, which, examined with an electron microscope, showed them to consist of a core of fibrils flanked by two ridges each composed of a single lateral fibril."
https://openalex.org/W2054301517,"JOWAR (Sorghum vulgare, L.), an important grain crop, occupies about 23 lakh acres in Uttar Pradesh, and the State stands third in its production in India. The crop is invariably attacked by a severe smut disease caused by Sphacelotheca sorghi (Link) Clinton. It causes usually 2–5 per cent infection in the crop; but as high as 65 per cent infection has been recorded in some fields. On the basis of 2 per cent loss, the grain smut is responsible for a loss of more than five thousand tons of grain or 15.5 lakhs of rupees in terms of money annually. Considerable work has been done in Bombay and Uttar Pradesh as well as in other States of India on the control of the smut by fungicidal seed treatments; but there seems to be no report available on the resistant varieties of jowar to grain smut in India. The work on testing some varieties of jowar against grain smut was therefore started in 1950 and continued up to 1952."
