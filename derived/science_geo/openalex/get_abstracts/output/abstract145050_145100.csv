https://openalex.org/W2025179363,"The abundant nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) synthesizes poly(ADP-ribose) in response to DNA strand breaks. During almost all forms of apoptosis, PARP is cleaved by caspases, suggesting the crucial role of its inactivation. A few studies have also reported a stimulation of PARP during apoptosis. However, the role of PARP stimulation and cleavage during this cell death process remains poorly understood. Here, we measured the stimulation of endogenous poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis during VP-16-induced apoptosis in HL60 cells and found that PARP was cleaved by caspases at the time of its poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. In vitro experiments showed that PARP cleavage by caspase-7, but not by caspase-3, was stimulated by its automodification by long and branched poly(ADP-ribose). Consistently, caspase-7 exhibited an affinity for poly(ADP-ribose), whereas caspase-3 did not. In addition, caspase-7 was activated and accumulated in the nucleus of HL60 cells in response to the VP-16 treatment. Furthermore, caspase-7 activation was concommitant with PARP cleavage in the caspase-3-deficient cell line MCF-7 in response to staurosporine treatment. These results strongly suggest that, in vivo, it is caspase-7 that is responsible for PARP cleavage and that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of PARP accelerates its proteolysis. Cleavage of the active form of caspase substrates could be a general feature of the apoptotic process, ensuring the rapid inactivation of stress signaling proteins.

Cleavage of the active form of caspase substrates could be a general feature of the apoptotic process, ensuring the rapid inactivation of stress signaling proteins. Apoptosis is a conserved mechanism of cell death controlling the development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms. In the last few years, a family of cysteine proteases named caspases, highly related to the interleukin-1Î²-converting enzyme and the proapoptotic CED-3 gene of Caenorhabditis elegans, have emerged as important mediators of the apoptotic process (1Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2182) Google Scholar, 2Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar). All caspases exist in the cytoplasm in the form of inactive proenzymes that are processed to a large and a small subunit to form the active enzyme (1Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2182) Google Scholar, 2Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar). Three of these caspases have been implicated in the execution phase of apoptosis (1Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2182) Google Scholar, 2Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar) and are shown to cleave specific substrates as the cell begins to present the characteristic morphological changes of apoptosis (nuclear condensation, cell blebbing, and formation of the apoptotic bodies). Caspase-3 was shown to cleave a wide range of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins (1Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2182) Google Scholar), which suggests an important role for this protease in apoptosis. Strikingly, caspase-3 knock-out mice, while showing major defects of apoptosis in the brain, seemed to have normal apoptotic responses otherwise (3Kuida K. Zheng T.S. Na S. Kuan C. Yang D. Karasuyama H. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). Caspase-7 is highly related to caspase-3 and shows the same synthetic substrate specificityin vitro (4Talanian R.V. Quinlan C. Trautz S. Hackett M.C. Mankovich J.A. Banach D. Ghayur T. Brady K.D. Wong W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9677-9682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). It is believed that caspase-7 cleaves caspase-3 substrates in caspase-3 knock-out mice. A recent caspase-3 knock-out report suggested that caspase-3 and -7 have distinct but possibly overlapping roles in apoptosis, because some caspase substrates are not cleaved in the knock-out cells, but the overall process is not altered (5Woo M. Hakem R. Soengas M.S. Duncan G.S. Shahinian A. Kagi D. Hakem A. McCurrach M. Khoo W. Kaufman S.A. Senaldi G. Howard T. Lowe S.W. Mak T.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 806-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). The third execution phase caspase, caspase-6, is responsible for the cleavage of the lamins (6Orth K. Chinnaiyan A.M. Garg M. Froelich C.J. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16443-16446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) 1The abbreviations used are:PARPpoly(ADP-ribose) polymeraseAFC7-amino-4-trifluoromethylCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1propanesulfonateCHOaldehydeDEVDacetyl-asp-glu-val-aspDHQ1,5-(dihydroxy)isoquinolinepNAp-nitroanilineVP-16etoposide synthesizes poly(ADP-ribose) from NAD in response to DNA strand breaks and is involved in many genomic processes including DNA base excision repair (7Satoh M.S. Poirier G.G. Lindahl T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7099-7106Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), DNA replication (8Yoshida S. Simbulan C.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 138: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and transcription (9Oei S.L. Griesenbeck J. Ziegler M. Schweiger M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1465-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). PARP is thought, along with DNA protein kinase, ATM, and p53, to be part of the cascade signaling DNA damage in the cell (10Agarwal M.L. Taylor W.R. Chernov M.V. Chernova O.B. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). PARP was one of the first substrates that was shown to be cleaved by caspases (11Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985PubMed Google Scholar, 12Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2277) Google Scholar). Although almost all caspases, including caspase-1, can cleave PARP in vitro (2Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar, 13Margolin N. Raybuck S.A. Wilson K.P. Chen W. Fox T. Gu Y. Livingston D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7223-7228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), it is most likely that caspase-3 and -7 are responsible for the in vivo processing of PARP to its apoptotic 24- and 89-kDa fragments (1Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2182) Google Scholar, 2Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar). The 89-kDa fragment, carrying the automodification domain and the catalytic domain of the enzyme, retains only a basal activity because it loses its capacity to bind to damaged DNA (11Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985PubMed Google Scholar). The 24-kDa fragment, which contains the two zinc fingers responsible for the DNA binding of PARP, is very likely to act as a transdominant inhibitor of active PARP, similar to the inhibition observed with the complete 46-kDa DNA-binding domain (14Molinete M. Vermeulen W. Burkle A. Menissier-de Murcia J. Kupper J.H. Hoeijmakers J.H. de Murcia G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2109-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Indeed, Smulson et al. (15Smulson M.E. Pang D. Jung M. Dimtchev A. Chasovskikh S. Spoonde A. Simbulan-Rosenthal C. Rosenthal D. Yakovlev A. Dritschilo A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3495-3498PubMed Google Scholar) have shown recently that the 24-kDa apoptotic fragment of PARP irreversibly binds to DNA breaks. poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1propanesulfonate aldehyde acetyl-asp-glu-val-asp 1,5-(dihydroxy)isoquinoline p-nitroaniline etoposide Here, we have studied the temporal association between PARP activation, its cleavage, and the appearance of the DNA ladder during the course of VP-16-induced apoptosis in HL60 cells. In these cells, we show that PARP is cleaved when it is poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated. In vitroanalysis of the cleavage kinetics of PARP as a function of its state of automodification reveals that PARP automodification stimulates its cleavage by caspase-7 but not by caspase-3. We also show that caspase-7 is activated and accumulates in the nucleus in response to the VP-16 treatment in HL60 cells. [32P]NAD (1.11 Tbq/mmol) and Î± [32P]dCTP (111 Tbq/mmol) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. DEVD-pNA, DEVD-AFC, and DEVD-CHO were purchased from Biomol Research Laboratory. DHQ was obtained from Aldrich. T4 DNA polymerase was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The polyclonal antibody against caspase-7 p19 subunit was kindly provided by Dr. G. M. Cohen (16MacFarlane M. Cain K. Sun X.M. Alnemri E.S. Cohen G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Jackson Immunoresearch. Other reagents were obtained from Sigma or Roche Molecular Biochemicals. HL60 human leukemia cells and MCF-7 cells were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine for MCF-7 cells. Apoptosis was induced with 68 Î¼m VP-16 and 1 Î¼m staurosporine for HL60 and MCF-7, respectively. For the Western blots, cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 830 Ãg, washed with HEPES-saline buffer (140 mm NaCl, 7 mm KCl, 6 mm glucose, 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4), and resuspended in reducing loading buffer. The cells were sonicated prior to loading on a 8% polyacrylamide gel, resolved, and transferred on a nitrocellulose membrane. PARP cleavage was detected using the monoclonal antibody CII10, which recognizes full-length PARP and its 89-kDa apoptotic fragment, as described by Lazebnik et al. (17Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2347) Google Scholar). The 116- and 89-kDa bands were quantified using a cooled CCD camera equipped with a Chemi Imager 4000, and the data were analyzed with the Digital Imaging Analysis Systems (Alpha Innotech Inc.). The apoptotic internucleosomal cleavage of the DNA was performed as described by McGahon et al. (18McGahon A.J. Martin S.J. Bissonnette R.P. Mahboubi A. Shi Y. Mogil R.J. Nishioka W.K. Green D.R. Schwartz L.M. Osborne B.A. Cell Death. Vol. 46. Academic Press, San Diego1995: 153-185Google Scholar). For the separation of nucleus from the cytoplasm, cells were resuspended in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mmEDTA, 300 mm sucrose, 2 mm Î²-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and antiprotease mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were then homogenized with a Dounce homogeneizer and centrifuged at 10,000 Ã g for 3 min. Pellets containing the nucleus were redissolved in the same buffer. Cytoplasm and nucleus were then diluted in reducing loading buffer prior to loading on a 15% polyacrylamide gel and submitted to Western blotting with an anti-caspase-7 p19 subunit antibody. Purification of NAD and poly(ADP-ribose) from cells and analysis of the NAD levels were done essentially as described by Shahet al. (19Shah G.M. Poirier D. Duchaine C. Brochu G. Desnoyers S. Lagueux J. Verreault A. Hoflack J.C. Kirkland J.B. Poirier G.G. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 227: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), except that the formic acid precipitation step, including addition of bovine serum albumin and cold poly(ADP-ribose), was omitted. Poly(ADP-ribose) was measured, using a dot blot technique with the LP96â10 antibody as described previously (20Affar E.B. Duriez P.J. Shah R.G. Sallmann F.R. Bourassa S. Kupper J.H. Burkle A. Poirier G.G. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 259: 280-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To determine the sizes of the polymers in the apoptotic cells, 5 Ã 107 HL60 cells were treated for 3 h with 68 Î¼m VP-16. After purification, the polymer was resolved on a 20% polyacrylamide gel, transferred on a Hybond N+membrane, and revealed using the LP96â10 antibody (21Affar E.B. Duriez P.J. Shah R.G. Winstall E. Germain M. Boucher C. Bourassa S. Kirkland J.B. Poirier G.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1428: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). PARP was purified to homogeneity from bovine thymus essentially as described by Zahradka and Ebisuzaki (22Zahradka P. Ebisuzaki K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 142: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and modified by Huletsky et al. (23Huletsky A. de Murcia G. Muller S. Hengartner M. Menard L. Lamarre D. Poirier G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8878-8886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity of the purified enzyme was 1341 units/mg protein. Human recombinant caspase-3 and -7 were purified to homogeneity from overexpressing bacteria, as described previously (6Orth K. Chinnaiyan A.M. Garg M. Froelich C.J. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16443-16446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase was purified up to the polyethylene glycol precipitation step according to Thomassin et al. (24Thomassin H. Jacobson M.K. Guay J. Verreault A. Aboul-ela N. Menard L. Poirier G.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4691-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Bovine PARP (150 ng/reaction) was poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated in a modified caspase-3 assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10% sucrose, and 10 mm dithiothreitol) (12Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2277) Google Scholar, 25D'Amours D. Germain M. Orth K. Dixit V.M. Poirier G.G. Radiat. Res. 1998; 150: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) in the absence or the presence of 6 Î¼g/ml activated calf thymus DNA and 200 Î¼m of NAD for 15 min at 25 Â°C. The automodification reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 Î¼m DHQ (26Shah G.M. Poirier D. Desnoyers S. Saint-Martin S. Hoflack J.C. Rong P. ApSimon M. Kirkland J.B. Poirier G.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1312: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Upon addition of 0.1% CHAPS and the indicated amount of caspase-3 or -7, the substrate was digested for specific times at 37 Â°C. The caspase-3-like protease inhibitor DEVD-CHO was then added to a final concentration of 100 nm to stop the digestion, followed by the addition of 0.25 units of glycohydrolase for 30 min at 25 Â°C to remove the polymer. The reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of reducing loading buffer and heating at 65 Â°C for 15 min. The apoptotic fragment was separated from the full-length PARP and visualized as described above. To produce polymers of different lengths, PARP was automodified for 1 min in the presence of activated DNA and the indicated concentrations of [32P]NAD. Poly(ADP-ribose) lengths were then determined as described (25D'Amours D. Germain M. Orth K. Dixit V.M. Poirier G.G. Radiat. Res. 1998; 150: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). One unit of caspase activity was defined as the amount of caspase necessary to produce one pmol of AFC/min from the substrate DEVD-AFC, in the same reaction conditions that for PARP. The experiments were carried out essentially as described by Althaus et al. (27Althaus F.R. Bachmann S. Hofferer L. Kleczkowska H.E. Malanga M. Panzeter P.L. Realini C. Zweifel B. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1995; 77: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Caspases and total histones were resolved on a 15% acrylamide gel and transferred on a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was washed three times with TBS-T (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20), blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in TBS-T, and washed again three times with TBS-T prior to incubation with the indicated quantities of [32P]poly(ADP-ribose) for 1 h. After washing the membranes with TBS-T, the radioactive polymer still bound to the membrane was analyzed by autoradiography. The same experiments were also carried out with radiolabeled genomic DNA (Sigma). The DNA was radiolabeled by [32P]dCTP using T4 DNA polymerase, as described by Legault et al. (28Legault J. Tremblay A. Ramotar D. Mirault M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5437-5452Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). During apoptosis, a drop in cellular NAD was observed in some cellular systems. This NAD depletion was partially inhibited by the PARP inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide, thus implicating PARP activation in apoptosis (11Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985PubMed Google Scholar, 29Nosseri C. Coppola S. Ghibelli L. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 212: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 30Coppola S. Nosseri C. Maresca V. Ghibelli L. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, enzymes other than PARP have recently been shown to decrease NAD levels following DNA damage (31Shieh W.M. Ame J.-C. Wilson M.V. Wang Z.-Q. Koh D.W. Jacobson M.K. Jacobson E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30069-30072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Furthermore, studies on polymer levels during apoptosis have relied on permeabilized cells, which do not allow an accurate measurement of endogenous poly(ADP-ribose) levels. These techniques have thus failed to evaluate the poly(ADP-ribose) metabolism in intact cells. To determine the extent of PARP activation during apoptosis and the relation to its cleavage, HL60 cells were treated with the topoisomerase II inhibitor, VP-16. PARP cleavage occurred 3 h after treatment, concomitantly with a transient polymer synthesis (Fig.1). The 89-kDa apoptotic fragment of PARP was poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated as recognized by the anti-polymer antibody, whereas full-length PARP was not (Fig. 1 B). This result suggests that automodified PARP is a natural substrate for caspases. The band at 66 kDa is likely to be the bovine serum albumin from the culture medium, which is recognized by the antibody. An immunological method recently developed in our laboratory (20Affar E.B. Duriez P.J. Shah R.G. Sallmann F.R. Bourassa S. Kupper J.H. Burkle A. Poirier G.G. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 259: 280-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was then used to directly measure the endogenous polymer levels. This technique relies on affinity chromatography purification of the polymers followed by their specific immunodetection. PARP cleavage was measured in parallel using Western blotting with CII10 antibody. The time course experiment presented in Fig.2 A shows the polymer peak at 3 h after the addition of VP-16, a time at which most PARP cleavage also occurred. This result further supports the notion that PARP is cleaved once it is activated. NAD was also measured during the course of the treatment to determine the relationship between polymer synthesis and NAD levels. A cellular drop in NAD occurred in apoptotic cells at the time at which the polymer peak was detected (Fig.2 B). However, NAD levels continued to drop after the polymer peak, even though more than 50% of PARP was cleaved. A concentration of 1 mm of the PARP inhibitor DHQ, known to completely inhibit PARP in vivo (26Shah G.M. Poirier D. Desnoyers S. Saint-Martin S. Hoflack J.C. Rong P. ApSimon M. Kirkland J.B. Poirier G.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1312: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), only partially prevented the loss of NAD (Fig. 2 B). These results indicate that the drop in NAD does not result only from PARP activation. During this time, 100% of the cells were still viable as determined by the exclusion of trypan blue dye. Because PARP is activated in response to DNA strand breaks, we expected the internucleosomal degradation of the DNA in the apoptotic cells to be responsible for the activation of PARP. Thus, the extent of DNA degradation in HL60 cells treated with VP-16 was measured. As shown in Fig. 2 C, the DNA ladder appeared at the same time point as the poly(ADP-ribose) peak, strongly suggesting that PARP activation was caused by these strand breaks. The results obtained from the apoptotic cells suggested that PARP cleavage occurs in vivowhen the enzyme is poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated in response to DNA strand breaks. To define more precisely the effect of PARP automodification on caspase activity, we investigated the in vitro kinetics of automodified PARP cleavage by purified caspase-3 and -7. PARP was automodified in the presence of NAD and activated DNA and then subjected to cleavage assay by caspase-3 and -7. Because highly modified PARP cannot be resolved by gel electrophoresis (23Huletsky A. de Murcia G. Muller S. Hengartner M. Menard L. Lamarre D. Poirier G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8878-8886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase, the enzyme responsible for poly(ADP-ribose) catabolism, was added to the cleaved poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP to remove the polymers that impair its mobility on gel. Under these conditions, almost all of the polymers could be removed (data not shown), ensuring a precise determination of the PARP cleavage kinetics. As control, PARP was digested under the same conditions except that the NAD and DNA were omitted, because the binding of PARP on DNA delays its cleavage (25D'Amours D. Germain M. Orth K. Dixit V.M. Poirier G.G. Radiat. Res. 1998; 150: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Because the specific activity may vary between enzyme preparations, the same enzymatic activity was used for each caspase. The results shown in Fig.3 indicates that caspase-7 cleaves PARP with a greater efficiency than caspase-3. Furthermore, they demonstrate that PARP automodification greatly stimulates its proteolytic cleavage by caspase-7 but not by caspase-3. Using higher amounts of caspase-3, PARP was cleaved efficiently independently of its state of automodification (data not shown). Thus, PARP cleavage by caspase-7 but not by caspase-3 is specifically increased by the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated substrate. The effect of free poly(ADP-ribose) on caspase activity was also measured, using the synthetic substrate DEVD-pNA to ensure that the polymers would not interact with the caspase substrate. The presence of 10 Î¼m free poly(ADP-ribose) had no effect either on caspase-3 or on caspase-7 activity (data not shown). Thus, the stimulation of PARP cleavage by caspase-7 is not mediated by a direct effect of the free polymer on caspases. Other experiments showed similar caspase activity in the absence or in the presence of NAD, activated DNA and DHQ (data not shown). None of these compounds had an effect on caspase activity at the concentrations found in the PARP automodification reaction mixture. To determine the length of poly(ADP-ribose) that stimulates caspase-7, PARP was automodified in presence of DNA and various concentrations of NAD, after which the automodified substrate was digested with caspase-7 for 20 min. Automodification with polymers up to 20 residues had only minimal effect on caspase-7 activity (Fig.4, A and B). The presence of DNA, which has been shown to delay PARP cleavage by caspase-3 (25D'Amours D. Germain M. Orth K. Dixit V.M. Poirier G.G. Radiat. Res. 1998; 150: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), could explain the absence of cleavage at concentrations of NAD below 0.1 Î¼m. However, PARP automodification with the long and branched polymers produced at 200 Î¼m NAD resulted in a strong stimulation of caspase-7 (Fig. 4,AâC). The length of the polymers was then measured in the apoptotic cells using a new technique consisting in the separation of the polymers on a polyacrylamide gel, followed by its transfer on a positively charged membrane and detection using an anti-poly(ADP-ribose) antibody (LP-96â10). As shown in Fig.4 D, long and branched polymers are produced in these cells during apoptosis. These results indicate that principally long and branched polymers, which are produced in vivo, stimulate caspase-7-mediated cleavage of PARP. The polymer blot assay described by Althauset al. (27Althaus F.R. Bachmann S. Hofferer L. Kleczkowska H.E. Malanga M. Panzeter P.L. Realini C. Zweifel B. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1995; 77: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) was used to determine caspase-3 and -7 affinities for poly(ADP-ribose). Using 0.1 Î¼m of free [32P]poly(ADP-ribose), we detected binding on the p19 subunit of caspase-7 as well as on total histones (Fig.5 A). A weak signal was observed from the p10 subunit of caspase-7. No binding was observed for caspase-3. The same experiment was repeated with 1 Î¼m of [32P]poly(ADP-ribose). At this concentration, the two subunits of caspase-7 appeared to bind the polymer almost equally, whereas in the case of caspase-3, only p17 showed a weak binding to the polymer (Fig. 5 B). The binding of [32P]poly(ADP-ribose) on native caspase-7 and its weak binding on native caspase-3 were also detected by dot blot (data not shown). Experiments using radiolabeled genomic DNA instead of poly(ADP-ribose) were also performed to determine whether the binding was specific. We were able to detect the binding of DNA to histones but not to caspase-7 (Fig. 5 C), indicating that the binding is not due to nonspecific ionic interactions. Because our results strongly suggest that caspase-7 is responsible for the cleavage of activated PARP in vivo, we verified the activation of caspase-7 in HL60 cells in response to VP-16 treatment. As shown in Fig. 6 A, caspase-7 was effectively processed to its active form in the apoptotic cells as seen by the apparition of its p19 subunit. This activation occurred 3 h after the treatment (data not shown), the time at which PARP was cleaved, suggesting that caspase-7 could effectively cleave PARPin vivo. Furthermore, there was active caspase-7 located in the nucleus, where it could cleave and inactivate poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP (Fig. 6 A). Caspase-7 was also activated at the time of PARP cleavage in MCF-7 cells treated with 1 Î¼mstaurosporine (Fig. 6, B and C). Because MCF-7 cells lack caspase-3 (32Janicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1720) Google Scholar), these results further support that caspase-7 cleaves PARP in vivo. During apoptosis, NAD depletion with partial restoration in the presence of PARP inhibitors has been reported (11Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985PubMed Google Scholar, 29Nosseri C. Coppola S. Ghibelli L. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 212: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 30Coppola S. Nosseri C.

Cell Res. 1994; 212: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 35Tanizawa A. Kubota M. Hashimoto H. Shimizu T. Takimoto T. Kitoh T. Akiyama Y. Mikawa H. Exp.

Chem. 1996; 271: 9129-9134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, poly(ADP-ribose) levels resulting from the activation of PARP were measured using NAD incorporation in permeabilized cells. Major draw backs of this technique are the inability to measure polymer levels precisely and the presence of artificially high amounts of polymer, even in control cells (35Tanizawa A. Kubota M. Hashimoto H. Shimizu T. Takimoto T. Kitoh T. Akiyama Y. Mikawa H. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 185: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, in this study, endogenous poly(ADP-ribose) was measured directly in intact HL60 cells to follow the activation of PARP during the course of VP-16-induced apoptosis. Using an immunological method for the quantification of polymer, we found that the activation of PARP coincided with the appearance of the DNA ladder. Furthermore, this endogenous polymer peak was sharp when compared with the one found using permeabilized cells (35Tanizawa A. Kubota M. Hashimoto H. Shimizu T. Takimoto T. Kitoh T. Akiyama Y. Mikawa H. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 185: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 36Yoon Y.S. Kim J.W. Kang K.W. Kim Y.S. Choi K.H. Joe C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9129-9134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), suggesting that PARP was activated only at the time of the appearance of the DNA ladder and not before. This suggests an activation of PARP by DNA strand breaks generated during internucleosomal DNA degradation, as proposed by Nosseriet al. (29Nosseri C. Coppola S. Ghibelli L. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 212: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Activation of PARP in response to apoptosis inducers like anti-Fas antibody or campthothecin has also been shown by Western blot using an antibody against poly(ADP-ribose) (34Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Rosenthal D.S. Iyer S. Boulares A.H. Smulson M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13703-13712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). During the course of VP-16-induced apoptosis of HL60 cells, PARP activation was low compared with the amount of DNA damage: 50 Î¼m of the alkylating agent 1-methyl-3-nitro-1-nitrosoguanidine produces 144 pmol of poly(ADP-ribose)/108 cells (unpublished results), whereas we measured 18 pmol/108 apoptotic cells. Two mechanisms could account for this low activation. First, PARP is cleaved and inactivated by caspases at the time of its activation (Figs. 1 and2 A). Second, the 24-kDa fragment of PARP generated by the caspases could act as a transdominant inhibitor of full-length PARP. This apoptotic fragment retains its ability to bind to degraded or fragmented DNA by the virtue of its zinc fingers. It cannot, however, be dislodged from the DNA breaks (15Smulson M.E. Pang D. Jung M. Dimtchev A. Chasovskikh S. Spoonde A. Simbulan-Rosenthal C. Rosenthal D. Yakovlev A. Dritschilo A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3495-3498PubMed Google Scholar). A similar mechanism has been shown for the full-length 46-kDa DNA-binding domain (14Molinete M. Vermeulen W. Burkle A. Menissier-de Murcia J. Kupper J.H. Hoeijmakers J.H. de Murcia G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2109-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Our results also show that neither PARP activation or the residual activity of the 89-kDa apoptotic fragment are responsible for the apoptotic NAD depletion, because NAD levels dropped only by 20% at the time of PARP activation and that the PARP inhibitor DHQ did not prevent the NAD depletion occurring after 6 h of treatment. However, these results do not exclude the possibility that the absence of PARP cleavage could result in its overactivation and massive NAD depletion that could cause necrotic cell death (37Virag L. Scott G.S. Cuzzocrea S. Marmer D. Salzman A.L. Szabo C. Immunology. 1998; 94: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The kinetics of PARP stimulation reported here indicate that it occurs at the same time as that of its cleavage. This is supported by the fact that the 89-kDa apoptotic fragment of PARP, which retains only a basal activity (11Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985PubMed Google Scholar), is automodified to a larger extent than the uncleaved full-length PARP (Fig. 1 B). These results differ from those of Simbulan-Rosenthal et al. (34Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Rosenthal D.S. Iyer S. Boulares A.H. Smulson M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13703-13712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) who found that caspases were activated after the polymer peak. They used an in vitrotranslated PARP with cytosolic extracts, a system in which the kinetics could differ from ours, because we measured the cleavage of endogenous PARP. However, because the apoptotic DNase (caspase-activated DNase) is activated by caspases (38Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2807) Google Scholar), it is likely that caspase activation occurs before PARP stimulation. Contrary to proteolysis of PARP by papain, which is inhibited by its automodification, 2G. G. Poirier and S. Bourassa, unpublished results. its cleavage by caspase-7 is stimulated. We found that long and branched polymers attached to PARP are capable of stimulating its cleavage by caspase-7, possibly by increasing the affinity of the latter for PARP. In addition, we have demonstrated directly the difference in the specificity of the two caspases toward PARP, in vitro. We found that caspase-7 was more effective in cleaving PARP than caspase-3 (Fig. 3), despite a similar Km for the synthetic substrate DEVD-pNA (11 Î¼m and 12 Î¼m for caspase-3 and -7, respectively) (4Talanian R.V. Quinlan C. Trautz S. Hackett M.C. Mankovich J.A. Banach D. Ghayur T. Brady K.D. Wong W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9677-9682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Because theKcat values of caspase-3 and -7 for DEVD-pNA are 10 sâ1 and 1.3 sâ1, respectively, 3Q. Zhou and G. S. Salvesen, personal communication. and because PARP is cleaved faster by caspase-7 than by caspase-3, our results suggest that caspase-7 has a much higher affinity for PARP than caspase-3, although one study on caspase specificity in vitro, done using the 46-kDa DBD that lacks the automodification sites, showed a preferential PARP cleavage by caspase-3 (13Margolin N. Raybuck S.A. Wilson K.P. Chen W. Fox T. Gu Y. Livingston D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7223-7228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). However, using different peptide inhibitors of caspases, Takahashi et al. (39Takahashi A. Hirata H. Yonehara S. Imai Y. Lee K.K. Moyer R.W. Turner P.C. Mesner P.W. Okazaki T. Sawai H. Kishi S. Yamamoto K. Okuma M. Sasada M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2741-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) observed that caspase-7 had the highest specificity for the PARP cleavage site (GDEVDâGIDEV). They also showed that a caspase-3 specific inhibitor peptide, DMQD-CHO, prevented the cleavage of some of the caspase-3 substrates but not of PARP (40Hirata H. Takahashi A. Kobayashi S. Yonehara S. Sawai H. Okazaki T. Yamamoto K. Sasada M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). In addition, PARP cleavage was observed in caspase-3 knock-out mice (3Kuida K. Zheng T.S. Na S. Kuan C. Yang D. Karasuyama H. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar,5Woo M. Hakem R. Soengas M.S. Duncan G.S. Shahinian A.

PARP was also cleaved in the caspase-3 defective cell line MCF-7, cleavage that paralleled caspase-7 activation (Fig. 6, B andC). These results all lend support to the notion that caspase-7 is the most efficient caspase for PARP cleavage. They also indicate that the tetrapeptide cleavage site is not the only important factor for efficient cleavage of caspase substrates. Furthermore, the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of PARP appears to target caspase-7 to the activated PARP to ensure its rapid inactivation. To maintain cellular integrity and homeostasis, a set of proteins act as stress sensors to promote a cellular response to situations such as DNA damage or heat shock. Because apoptosis results in the complete dismantling of the cell, such stress signaling proteins may be stimulated and interfere with the apoptotic process. However, this could be prevented by the rapid inactivation of these proteins by caspases. Because DNA is rapidly degraded in apoptotic cells, inhibition of DNA repair is primordial in this view. Because PARP can act as a DNA break sensor to signal DNA damage, the rapid cleavage of the activated PARP molecules would ensure the interruption of this signal. Interestingly, similar reasoning could apply to another DNA break sensing molecule, DNA protein kinase. It has been reported that the active DNA protein kinase holoenzyme, bound to DNA breaks, would be the physiological target of caspase-3 (41Casciola-Rosen L. Nicholson D.W. Chong T. Rowan K.R. Thornberry N.A. Miller D.K. Rosen A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1957-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Such a preferential cleavage would permit a much more rapid execution phase of apoptosis, because only the active form of these stress sensing proteins would need to be inactivated before dismantling of the cell, although all the molecules would eventually be cleaved independently on their state of activation. The failure to cleave those apoptotic substrates would not prevent the death of the cell but could retard it sufficiently to render it dangerous for the organism. Such an inhibition of apoptotic morphology has recently been shown for PARP (42Oliver F.J. de la Rubia G. Rolli V. Ruiz-Ruiz M.C. de Murcia G. MeÌnissier-de Murcia J. J. Biol.

Maheshwar M. Lazarou L. Davies F. Coles G. Ravine D. Hum. Genet. 1998; 102: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), is consistent with this formulation. Polycystic kidney disease resulting from mutations in eitherPKD1 or PKD2 occurs via a cellular recessive mechanism in which the somatic acquisition of âsecond hitsâ on the respective normal allele in a single cell gives rise to cyst formation. For PKD1, this evidence was obtained from studies using human cystic kidneys (14Qian F. Watnick T.J. Onunchic L.F. Germino G.G.

The loss of functional polycystin-2 in renal tubular and biliary epithelial cells causes these cells to proliferate, lose their normal structure within tissue architecture, and go on to form cysts. The function of polycystin-2, however, remains unknown. An essential step toward understanding the function of polycystin-2 is a molecular dissection of its important functional domains and the characterization of its cellular expression pattern. In this study, we use a pair of polyclonal antisera against intracellular domains of polycystin-2 to characterize polycystin-2 as an integral membrane glycoprotein whose predominant subcellular location is in the endoplasmic reticulum in cultured cells. We show that a 34-amino acid domain containing a pair of putative phosphorylation sites in cytoplasmic COOH terminus is necessary for the exclusive ER localization of polycystin-2. Fusion protein C2 (amino acids 687â962) contains most of the cytoplasmic COOH-terminal portion of polycystin-2, and B9 (amino acids 103â203) contains part of the cytoplasmic NH2-terminal portion of polycystin-2 (3Mochizuki T. Wu G. Hayashi T. Xenophontos S.L. Veldhuisen B. Saris J.J. Reynolds D.M. Cai Y. Gabow P.A. Pierides A. Kimberling W.J. Breuning M.H. DeltaS C.C. Peters D.J.M. Somlo S.

These recombinant proteins were generated by subcloning polymerase chain reaction-generated fragments of PKD2 into the pGEX2T expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscatway, NJ). Polymerase chain reaction primers were designed with a BamHI and EcoRI linkers for the forward and reverse primers, respectively. The primer sequences are as follows: C2, 5â²-CGCGGATCCGTGAAATCTGACTTGGCACA-3â² (forward), 5â²-CGCGAATTCAATTTCCACCTGCACCTTCC-3â² (reverse); B9, 5â²-CGCGGATCCGTGGAAGGGGAAGAAGGC-3â² (forward), and 5â²-CGCGAATTCATGTTCCCCAGAGACCTCG-3â² (reverse). Subclones were sequenced to confirm reading frame and fidelity to PKD2. Recombinant proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified with glutathione-agarose according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The purified fusion proteins were used to immunize New Zealand rabbits to raise polyclonal antisera (HRP, Denver, PA). Antiserum YCC2 raised against C2 fusion protein and YCB9 raised against B9, were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and high titer antisera were used for subsequent studies. Preabsorbed antisera were prepared by mixing 400 Î¼l of PBS containing proteinase inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 Î¼g/ml pepstatin, 4 mm benzamidine), 4 Î¼l of antiserum, and either 5 Î¼g of GST or 5 Î¼g of the respective fusion protein. After incubation for 1 h at 4 Â°C, 40 Î¼l of 50% glutathione-agarose was added, mixed repeatedly for 15 min at room temperature, and centrifuged at 12,000 Ã g for 5 min. The supernatants were used at a 1:10 dilution for immunohistochemistry. Affinity purified antibody, YCC2-P, was obtained using HiTrap affinity columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Briefly, GST-C2 fusion protein was cleaved by thrombin and GST protein was removed by binding to glutathione-agarose. The purified C2 polycystin-2 fragment in the eluate was coupled to the HiTrap affinity columns and the rabbit antiserum was affinity purified according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The following reagents were obtained from commercial sources: mouse monoclonal antibodies for protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) (StressGen, Victoria, BC, Canada), Î± subunit of Na+,K+-ATPase (National Institutes of Health, NICHD Hybridoma Bank), and Î²-COP (clone M3A5, Sigma); rabbit polyclonal antiserum for calnexin (StressGen). A full-length PKD2 cDNA, TM4-FL was constructed by taking advantage of the uniqueBamHI in the open reading frame. TheXbaI-BamHI fragment from the K1-1 clone andBamHI-XhoI fragment from cTM4B3-3 clone (3Mochizuki T. Wu G. Hayashi T. Xenophontos S.L. Veldhuisen B. Saris J.J. Reynolds D.M. Cai Y. Gabow P.A.

The construction of TM4-FL was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing. We introduced naturally occurring human PKD2 mutations, R742X (3Mochizuki T. Wu G. Hayashi T.

Nephrol,in press. into TM4-FL by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuickChange kit (Stratagene, LA Jolla, CA) as recommended by the manufacturer. Additional truncation constructs were produced by introducing stop codons at glutamate 787 (E787X) and glycine 821 (G821X). The mutagenesis primers used were as follows: 1) R742X: 5â²-GTTAAACTTTGACGAACTT T GACAAGATCTCAAAGGGAAG-3â² (forward) and its reverse complement (reverse); 2) E787X: 5â²-GACTTGGAGAAAGAGAGG T A A GACCTGGATTTGGATC-3â² (forward) and its reverse complement (reverse); 3) G821X: 5â²-GACGATGAAGATAGC T A A CATAGCTCCAGAAGGAGG-3â² (forward) and its reverse complement; 4) R872X: 5â²-GAAGCTAGAGATTATGGAG T GAGCCAAACTGAGAAGGAG-3â² (forward) and its reverse complement (reverse). The sequence change(s) from wild type is shown in bold and underlined. These four mutagenesis clones were constructed in pCDNA3.1 and were confirmed by direct sequencing. In addition, we produced a PKD2 clone truncated after leucine 703 (Leu703) by introduction of an influenza virus hemagglutinin protein epitope tag and an in-frame stop codon. For this, TM4-FL cloned into pCDNA3 was linearized by double digestion withBglII and XhoI (the former cutting the insert at Leu703) and re-ligated in the presence of an annealed adaptor: 5â²-GAT CTT CTTAAGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAG ATTACGCTTAAC-3â² (upper strand) and 5â²-TCGAGTTAAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTACTTAAGAA-3â² (lower strand). The Leu703 codon is indicated in the upper strand by bold underline and the HA tag sequence is shown in italics followed by a TAA stop codon. The clones were sequence verified. A COOH terminus clone containing codons 652â968 of PKD2 was generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification with forward and reverse primers containing EcoRI and SalI linkers (underline), respectively. The primer sequences are: 5â²-CTTGAATTCGCTAATCGAGTTTTGGGAC-3â² (forward), and 5â²-ACGCGTCGACTCATACGTGGACATTAGAAC-3â² (reverse). The amplification product was subcloned in-frame into theEcoRI-SalI sites of a modified pFLAG-CMV-2 vector (Kodak, Rochester, NY). 3Y. Maeda, unpublished data. The reading frame was confirmed by sequencing. The expression product contains the sixth transmembrane domain and the entire intracellular COOH terminus of PKD2 downstream of a FLAG tag. HEK293 cells (ATCC number CRT 1573) were used for most transfection experiments in this study. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. For transient transfections, â¼1 Ã 106 cells were transfected with 2 Î¼g of the appropriate expression plasmid using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were continuously cultured for 48â72 h before being used for analysis. For HEK293 stable cell lines expressing TM4-FL in pCDNA3.1, selection with 50 Î¼g/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was begun 48 h after transfection. After 2 weeks, individual colonies were selected and continuously cultured under selection and tested by immunoblotting and immocytochemistry for expression of polycystin-2 using YCC2 and YCB9 antisera. Other cell lines were used in selected experiments to assess the generality of the findings: AtT-20 cells (ATCC number CCL89), COS-7 cells (ATCC number CRL 1651), HeLa cells (ATCC number CCL2), LLC-PK1 cells (ATCC number CRL 1392), and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (ATCC number CCL 34). LLC-PK1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum for stable transfections. Cells at 70% confluence in 25-cm2 flasks were transfected with 8 Î¼g of expression plasmid (TM4-FL or L703HA in pCDNA3) using a calcium phosphate protocol (19Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4768) Google Scholar). After 16 h, cells were replated into 100-mm dishes and selection with G418 400 Î¼g/ml (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) was begun after 48 h in culture. Approximately 3 weeks later, resistant colonies were cultured individually and tested for the expression of the full-length and truncated PKD2 proteins. For Western blot analysis, 10â80 Î¼g of protein solubilized in sample buffer (125 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 200 mm dithiothreitol, 6% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 0.2% bromphenol blue) was subjected to electrophoresis on 8% SDS-PAGE gels without boiling. Fractionated proteins were electrotransfered to Polyscreen polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (NEN Life Science Products Inc., Boston, MA) and detected with the YCC2 (1:5000) or YCB9 (1:4000) polyclonal antisera, using ECL enhanced chemiluminescence (NEN Life Science Products). Immunoprecipitation was carried out as described previously with modifications (20Griffin M.D. O'Sullivan D.A. Torres V.E. Grande J.P. Kanwar Y.S. Kumar R. Kidney Int. 1997; 52: 1196-1205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared in NET buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.02% sodium azide), and protease inhibitors. One ml of total cell lysate was preincubated with preimmune serum and a 10% slurry of protein A-Sepharose beads at 4 Â°C for 1 h, then centrifuged at 500 Ã g. The supernatant was immunoprecipitated with purified YCC2-P antibody, washed extensively by NET buffer, and finally eluted with 1 Ã SDS sample buffer. The eluted supernatant was subjected for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Membrane proteins were prepared as described previously with modifications (21Kaminsky S.M. Levy O. Salvador C. Dai G. Carrasco N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3789-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Tissues of human fetal or adult kidneys or cultured cells were washed and homogenized with a motor driven Teflon pestle homogenizer in ice-cold SBE buffer (250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 7.5)) containing aprotinin (90 Î¼g/ml), benzamidine (1 mm), leupeptin (4 Î¼g/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.8 mm),p-tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester (20 Î¼g/ml),N Î±-benzoyl-l-arginine methyl ester (20 Î¼g/ml), and soybean inhibitor of trypsin (20 Î¼g/ml). The homogenates were centrifuged twice at 500 Ã g for 15 min. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 Ãg for 1 h or treated with Nonidet P-40, 0.2m Na2CO3 (pH 11.0) or 1.5m NaCl prior to centrifugation. The membrane pellet (M) was resuspended in ice-cold SMB buffer (250 mm sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 7.5)), aliquoted and stored at â80 Â°C. The supernatant (S) fraction was stored similarly. All steps were performed at 4 Â°C. Protein concentrations were measured by the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Subcellular fractionations were performed as described (22Yang M. Ellenberg J. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1970-1975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) with modifications. Cultured cells were rinsed twice with Buffer A (0.25m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) and harvested by gentle scraping into 5 ml of homogenization buffer (85% Buffer A and 15% Buffer B (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmEDTA, 128 mm NaCl)). Cells were spun at 300 Ãg and resuspended in 0.5 ml of homogenization buffer, followed by homogenization at 4 Â°C by a motor driven Teflon pestle homogenizer. Post-nuclear supernatants were prepared by centrifugation at 1000 Ã g. Supernatants were loaded on pre-formed 0â26% Optiprep (Life Technologies, Inc.) linear gradients that had been pre-cooled to 4 Â°C. Gradients were spun for 120 min at 40,000 rpm at 4 Â°C in a SW41 rotor in a Beckman ultracentrifuge. Twenty fractions (â¼600 Î¼l each) were recovered by continuous elution from the bottom using a peristaltic pump. Samples containing equal volumes from each fraction were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting analysis. Membrane fraction protein or cell lysates were treated with peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) or endoglycosidase H (Endo H) following the manufacturer's protocols (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Reactions were incubated at 37 Â°C overnight with 1 Î¼l (500 units) of PNGase F or Endo H in the appropriate buffer in 20â40 Î¼l of total reaction volume. After the overnight incubation, an equal volume of 2 Ã SDS sample buffer was added to each reaction, and incubated at 37 Â°C for 30 min prior to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Biotinylation of cell surface proteins was carried out using EZ-Link NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce, Rockford, IL) as described (23Gottardi C.J. Dunbar L.A. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F285-F295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).N-Hydroxysuccinimide-SS-biotin was applied to living cultured stable LLC-PK1 cell lines expressing either the L703HA mutant or full-length PKD2. Biotinylated proteins were recovered using streptavidin-agarose beads. The eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting with the NH2-terminal antisera, YCB9. Cultured cells were washed in serum-free medium and PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 10 min before incubation with the primary antibodies. fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and Cy3-labeled anti-rat or anti-mouse IgG were used as the secondary antibodies. Immunofluorescent staining was detected using Zeiss Axiophot microscope or a Bio-Rad MRC 600 scanning laser confocal microscope. Rabbits were immunized with a pair of recombinant GST fusion proteins, B9 and C2, containing portions of the cytoplasmic NH2 and COOH termini of polycystin-2, respectively. Each of the resultant antisera gave high enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titers (>10,000) with their respective immunogens and were shown to specifically detect the corresponding GST fusion proteins on immunoblots (data not shown). Preimmune sera did not detect this band. YCC2 and YCB9, but not preimmune sera, specifically immunostained cultured cells transfected with full-length PKD2 while endogenous PKD2 staining was much weaker (see below). This signal was completely competed by the immunizing fusion peptide but not by GST alone (data not shown). Initial characterization of the YCB9 and YCC2 antisera was performed using HEK293 cells transfected with full-length PKD2 as well as wild type cells. YCB9 and YCC2 detected a prominent band migrating at â¼110 kDa in the crude lysate of transfected cells (Fig.1). The â¼110-kDa signal was detected by YCB9 and YCC2 preabsorbed with GST protein but was abolished when using antisera preabsorbed with the respective immunizing fusion peptides (data not shown). Affinity purified YCC2-P antibody immunoprecipitated a â¼110-kDa band from transfected and untransfected cells that was detected by both YCB9 and YCC2 (Fig. 1). We have previously shown that mice homozygous for a null mutation in the Pkd2 gene lack the â¼110-kDa band on immunoblots of kidney tissue (16Wu G. D'Agati V. Cai Y. Markowitz G. Park J.H.

We prepared 100,000 Ã g membrane (M) and supernatant (S) fractions from adult and 22-week fetal normal human kidneys, 6 anonymous PKD kidneys of unknown genotype and from wild type HEK293 cells. Immunoblot analysis of endogenous PKD2 expression from these sources showed an abundant â¼110-kDa immunoreactive band in the membrane, but not supernatant, fractions of fetal, adult, and PKD kidney tissues and HEK293 cells using both YCB9 and YCC2 antisera (Fig.2 A). Treatment of crude HEK293 cell lysates with 1% Nonidet P-40 prior to sedimenting at 100,000 Ã g completely shifted the polycystin-2-specific band from the membrane to supernatant fraction (Fig. 2 B). Treatment with 1.5 m NaCl or 0.2 mNa2CO3 (pH 11.0) prior to centrifugation of 100,000 Ã g did not alter the membrane association of polycystin-2 (Fig. 2 B). These results indicate that polycystin-2 is an integral membrane protein that is not anchored to the cytoskeleton. Our predicted secondary structure model of polycystin-2 allows for the existence of 5 putative external Asn-glycosylation sites at positions 299, 305, 328, 362, and 377 of the primary amino acid sequence (3Mochizuki T. Wu G. Hayashi T. Xenophontos S.L. Veldhuisen B. Saris J.J. Reynolds D.M. Cai Y. Gabow P.A. Pierides A. Kimberling W.J. Breuning M.H. DeltaS C.C. Peters D.J.M. Somlo S. Science. 1996; 272: 1339-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar)}. In order to examine whether polycystin-2 is indeed a glycoprotein as predicted, membrane fractions from human kidney tissue, and untransfected as well as PKD2-transfected cultured cells were subjected to treatment with PNGase F, an enzyme that cleavesN-linked oligosaccharides from proteins. Immunoblot analysis showed a shift in the migration of polycystin-2 in PNGase F-treated membranes compared with untreated membranes from tissue and cell culture sources (Fig. 3). This finding shows that polycystin-2 is N-glycosylated in native tissue and in wild type and transfected cells in culture. To further characterize the nature of the N-glycosylation in PKD2, the respective membrane preparations were treated with endoglycosidase H (Endo H), an enzyme that cleaves all high-mannose oligosaccharides from proteins. Polycystin-2 from tissue and wild type and transfected cells in culture was completely sensitive to Endo H (Figs. 3 and 7). Typically, proteins that remain sensitive to Endo H are localized to the ER and cis portions of the Golgi. This finding is consistent with a finding that polycystin-2 is a membrane-bound protein whose expression is restricted to the ER and perhaps the pre-middle Golgi. To further evaluate the localization of PKD2 in cells, subcellular fractionation using iodixanol-based linear density gradient centrifugation was performed on wild type (untransfected) HEK293 cells. Twenty continuously eluted fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting with YCC2 and YCB9 anti-PKD2 antisera and by antibodies directed against calnexin, Î²-COP, and Na+,K+-ATPase as markers for ER, Golgi, and plasma membrane fractions, respectively. The distribution of polycystin-2 corresponded with the distribution of calnexin in the denser fractions of the gradient and differed from the distribution of Î²-COP and Na+,K+-ATPase (Fig.4). This finding suggests a predominant ER localization for polycsytin-2 and exclusion of prominent cell surface localization in the cultured cells. We examined PKD2-transfected cells by immunofluorescence m"

We identified mediators in oxidized LDL that induced an inflammatory reaction in vivo, and activated polymorphonuclear leukocytes and cells ectopically expressing human platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptors. Oxidation of a synthetic phosphatidylcholine showed that an sn-1 ether bond confers an 800-fold increase in potency. This suggests that rare ether-linked phospholipids in LDL are the likely source of PAF-like activity in oxidized LDL. Accordingly, treatment of oxidized LDL with phospholipase A1 greatly reduced phospholipid mass, but did not decrease its PAF-like activity. Tandem mass spectrometry identified traces of PAF, and more abundant levels of 1-O-hexadecyl-2-(butanoyl or butenoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholines (C4-PAF analogs) in oxidized LDL that comigrated with PAF-like activity. Synthesis showed that either C4-PAF was just 10-fold less potent than PAF as a PAF receptor ligand and agonist. Quantitation by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of pentafluorobenzoyl derivatives shows the C4-PAF analogs were 100-fold more abundant in oxidized LDL than PAF. Oxidation of synthetic alkyl arachidonoyl phosphatidylcholine generated these C4-PAFs in abundance. These results show that quite minor constituents of the LDL phosphatidylcholine pool are the exclusive precursors for PAF-like bioactivity in oxidized LDL.

PAF initiates the rapid inflammatory response as it is the leukocyte activating molecule produced and displayed by stimulated endothelial cells (1Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 93-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). PAF does not induce the bactericidal effector functions of leukocytes, but rather stimulates their adhesive and migratory behavior that allows them to transit the endothelial barrier. Leukocytes (polymorphonuclear leukocytes or PMN), monocytes, and eosinophils, as well as platelets, express the PAF receptor and accordingly are activated by PAF in concentrations ranging from picomolar to nanomolar levels. The potency of PAF, its broad actions, and the potentially deleterious events it invokes rationalize the tight regulation of PAF synthesis (2Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Gallin J.I.

Alone among this large family of receptors and related orphan sequences, the PAF receptor recognizes an intact phospholipid, and does so with a marked specificity. The PAF receptor shows a several hundredfold selectivity for the sn-1 ether bond of PAF, and complete specificity for the sn-2 acetyl residue compared with the long chain fatty acyl residue of most alkyl phosphatidylcholines (5O'Flaherty J.T. Salzer W.L. Cousart S. McCall C.E. Piantadosi C. Surles J.R. Hammett M.J. Wykle R.L. Res. Comm. Chem. Pathol. Pharm. 1983; 39: 291-309PubMed Google Scholar, 6Shen T.Y. Hwang S.-B. Doebber T.W.

FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1589-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), the PAF receptor has two additional, important recognition requirements; one is for a specific headgroup, and the second is for a specific, atypical sn-2 residue. The PAF receptor responds to synthetic analogs that contain shortsn-2 fatty acyl residues, and this too is relevant to inflammatory pathophysiology. PAF-like analogs with this structure are produced by oxidation of cellular (9Patel K.D. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol.

Oxidation of phosphatidylcholines generates a plethora of chemically related phosphatidylcholines and, as sn-1 alkyl or acyl phosphatidylcholines oxidize in a similar fashion (20Tokumura A. Kamiyasu K. Takauchi K. Tsukatani H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 145: 415-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), there is heterogeneity at both the sn-1 and sn-2 position. Only some of these will stimulate the PAF receptor, but identification of the biologically active species in the mix of similar oxidation products has been complicated by this heterogeneity. Here we show that one difficulty in identifying biologically active agents has been their profound dilution with related, but less active, diacyl homologs. We find that all of the PAF receptor agonists generated during the oxidation of LDL are derived from oxidation of the alkyl phosphatidylcholines found in very low abundance in LDL (21Diagne A. Fauvel J. Record M. Chap H. Douste-Blazy L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 793: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 22Tsoukatos D.C. Arborati M. Liapikos T. Clay K.L. Murphy R.C. Chapman M.J. Ninio E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 3505-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Removing the contaminating diacyl oxidation products allowed us to identify and quantitate fragmented alkyl phosphatidylcholines in oxidized LDL. While a trace amount of PAF was generated by oxidative fragmentation, major bioactive species are butanoyl- and butenoyl-PAF, which are also products of hexadecyl arachidonoyl phosphatidylcholine fragmentation. Thus, oxidation of rare phospholipid species in LDL generates bioactive, short chain PAF-analogs. Tissue culture grade chemicals were from Whittaker Bioproducts Inc., (Walkersville, MD), and tissue culture dishes were from Falcon Labware (Lincoln Park, NJ). Four-well multiwell dishes for PMN adhesion assays were from Nunclon (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark). Trypsin/EDTA was from Life Technologies, Inc., fetal Bovine Serum was from Hyclone Laboratories (Logan, UT), and human albumin was from Baxter Health Care Corp. (Glendale, CA). WEB 2086 was a generous gift from Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Ridgefield, CT). [3H]WEB 2086 (13.5 Ci/mml) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Aminopropyl columns were from J.T. Baker Inc. (Phillipsburg, NJ), and Pefabloc was from Pentapharm AG (Basel, Switzerland). The recombinant human plasma form PAF acetylhydrolase and hPAFR293 cells expressing the human PAF receptor were from ICOS Corp. (Bothell, WA), while phospholipase A2 (bee venom), phospholipase C (Bacillus cereus), phospholipase D (cabbage), and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) were from Sigma. Dialysis tubing (6000â8000-kDa cut-off) was from Spectrum Medical Industries, Inc. (Houston, TX), and glass fiber filter papers were from VWR Scientific (Westchester, PA). FURA-2AM ester was from Molecular Probe (Eugene, OR). All the solvents (J.T. Baker, Inc.) were HPLC grade. Lipase from Rhizopus arrhizus was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. 1-O-Hexadecyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (HAPC), PAF, 1-palmitoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (acyl-PAF), and lysoPAF were from Biomol Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA). The long chain phospholipids were purified by reversed phase HPLC prior to use. Commercial lysoPAF was subjected to mild alkaline hydrolysis as described below and acetylated with acid chlorides (acetyl, butyryl, or crotonyl) in the presence of perchloric acid (23Kumar R. Weintraub S.T. McManus L.M. Pinckard R.N. Hanahan D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 198-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to generate PAF and its C4 analogs. These were then purified by reversed phase HPLC and analyzed by GC/MS as described below. The total mass of the material was determined by lipid phosphorus analysis (24Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human LDL was isolated by density flotation from normolipidic subjects (25Chung B.H. Wilkinson T. Geer J.C. Segrest J.P. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 284-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described in detail (10Heery J.M. Kozak M. Stafforini D.M. Jones D.A. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2322-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), except that we employed Pefabloc (200 Î¼m) as a non-toxic alternative to diisopropyl fluorophosphate to inactivate PAF acetylhydrolase (26Dentan C. Tselepis A.D. Chapman M.J. Ninio E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and allow oxidized products to accumulate (10Heery J.M. Kozak M. Stafforini D.M. Jones D.A. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2322-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Isolated LDL was oxidized with 10 Î¼mCuSO4 for 18â24 h at 37 Â°C. Control LDL was not subjected to oxidation and was prevented from oxidation by 100 Î¼m BHT. Total lipids were extracted from LDL by the method of Bligh and Dyer (27Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar) before neutral lipids, fatty acids, and phospholipids were separated by aminopropyl chromatography (10Heery J.M. Kozak M. Stafforini D.M. Jones D.A. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2322-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The phospholipid fraction was further separated on a reversed phase column (ODS silica, 250 Ã 4.6-mm Microsorb MV; Rainin Instrument Co., Woford, MA) with a mobile phase of methanol/acetonitrile/H2O (840:150:10) containing 1 mm ammonium acetate and BHT (10 Î¼m) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions were collected for every minute for the first 10 min, and PAF-like lipids elute between minutes 5 and 8. Recovery of a [3H]PAF internal standard added to the LDL particle in the HPLC fractions was >75%. Fractions found to contain leukocyte agonists (as described below) were pooled, the solvent removed by a stream of N2, reconstituted with chloroform:methanol (2:1) containing BHT (10 Î¼m), and stored at â20 Â°C. Authentic PAF and PAF-like lipids were suspended in HBSS/A and sonicated prior to use. PAF-like lipids isolated from LDL were further purified by straight phase chromatography prior to determining their specific bioactivity. For this, a portion of the PAF-like lipids separated on reversed phase HPLC were treated with lipase from R. arrhizus (28Benveniste J. Le Couedic J.P. Polonsky J. Tence M. Nature. 1977; 269: 170-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and then injected onto a 5-Î¼m silica column (2 Ã 150 mm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) and the column developed with an isocratic solvent system (hexane:isopropanol:20 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7 (3:4:0.7, v/v/v)) (29Hall L.M. Murphy R.C. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258: 184-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Fractions were dried under nitrogen and used for bioassays and mass spectrometry. Human neutrophils were isolated by dextran sedimentation and centrifugation over Ficoll (30Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1986; 485: 349-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). CD18-dependent adhesion of activated neutrophils to a gelatin surface after 10 min of incubation at 37 Â°C was quantified using a video microscopy imaging system to count adherent cells. Authentic PAF was used as a positive control and to establish the daily sensitivity of the cells. In experiments where recombinant PAF acetylhydrolase was used, PAF-like lipids or PAF were treated with 4 Î¼g of this enzyme in HBSS/A for 1 h at 37 Â°C before addition of the agonist to neutrophils. The enzyme itself caused no activation at this concentration. Alternatively, neutrophils were treated with 10 Î¼m WEB 2086 for 20 min prior to the addition of agonist as a means to competitively block the PAF receptor. Wistar rats (150â200 g) were injected (0.1 ml total volume) intrathoracicaly with pooled HPLC fractions 6, 7, and 8 resuspended in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in sterile saline. Some animals were treated with the PAF receptor antagonist (20 mg/kg) 1 h before challenge. Some pooled HPLC aliquots were treated with recombinant PAF acetylhydrolase (2 Î¼g) for 20 min at 37 Â°C, the lipids reextracted, dried, and resuspended in injection buffer before use. The animals were euthanized 6 h after injection in a CO2 chamber, and the thoracic cavity opened and washed with 3 ml of heparinized (Liquemine; Roche, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) saline (10 units/ml). The pleural wash was recovered, and the volume measured with a graduated syringe. Pleural washes were diluted in Turk fluid (2% acetic acid) for total cell counts in Neubauer chambers. Differential analysis was performed in cytosmears stained by the May Grunwald-Giemsa method. The protein content of the pleural wash was determined by a Biuret reaction after clearing by centrifugation at 500 Ã g for 10 min. Subconfluent hPAFR293 cells (ICOS Corp., Bothell, WA) that stably express the human PAF receptor were treated with Versene (Life Technologies, Inc.) and resuspended in fresh culture medium (â¼1.1 Ã 107 cells/ml). FURA-2 AM was loaded into cells at 1 Î¼m from a 1 mm Me2SO stock, and after incubation in the dark for 45 min at 37 Â°C, the cells were washed with HBSS/A and resuspended in HBSS/A at a density of 2.25 Ã 106 cells/ml. Fluorescence of 1.5 ml of cells was measured at 24 Â°C, with dual excitation at 340 nm and 380 nm with the emission recorded at 510 nm (31Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The response of each batch of cells was tested with 0.1 and 1 nm authentic PAF to generate the maximal PAF response. Control 293 cells were processed in the same way, and their response was tested with PAF, or with thrombin or lysophosphatidic acid as positive controls. For some experiments, we confirmed the results obtained with hPAFR293 cells by performing parallel experiments in FURA2-labeled PMN. Ligand displacement of [3H]WEB 2086 from hPAFR293 cell membranes ectopically expressing the human PAF receptor was as described for Chinese hamster ovary cell membranes (32Aoki Y. Nakamura M. Kodama H. Matsumoto T. Shimizu T. Noma M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 186: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). PAF-like lipids were treated with 5 units of lipase from R. arrhizus in HBSS/A for 11 h at 37 Â°C and then tested directly for their ability to mobilize Ca2+ in hPAFR 293 cells (28Benveniste J. Le Couedic J.P. Polonsky J. Tence M. Nature. 1977; 269: 170-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Acyl-PAF (1-palmitoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) and PAF served as controls. In a similar fashion, PAF-like lipids were treated with phospholipase C (B. cereus), bee venom phospholipase A2, and cabbage phospholipase D before being tested for the ability to mobilize Ca2+ in PMN and hPAFR293 cells. The presence of an sn-1 ether bond was investigated by subjecting PAF-like lipids, PAF, or acyl-PAF to saponificaion with 0.5N NaOH in methanol for 2 h at 24 Â°C. Saponified material, containing free fatty acids and either lyso-PAF (1-O-hexadecyl-glycerophosphocholine) from glycerolipids with an sn-1 ether bond or glycerophosphocholine from diacyl phospholipids, did not induce Ca2+ accumulation in hPAFR293 cells. This material was reacetylated with excess acetyl chloride in the presence of perchloric acid (23Kumar R. Weintraub S.T. McManus L.M. Pinckard R.N. Hanahan D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 198-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and then reexamined for the ability to mobilize intracellular Ca2+ in the receptor-transfected cells. Direct LC/MS and LC/MS/MS analysis was carried out with a Sciex API-III+ triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (PE-Sciex, Thornhill, Ontario). For all electrospray ionization experiments, the curtain gas flow was 1.2 liter/min nitrogen with a nebulizer pressure at 38 p.s.i. The orifice potential was maintained at 75 V, and the electrospray ionization potential at +4200 V for detection of positive ions. For the analysis of negative ions, the ion spray potential was adjusted to â2800 V and purified air (zero air) was used to reduce any possibility for glow discharge at the electrospray needle. The orifice potential was maintained at â95 V. Selected ion recording experiments and multiple reaction monitoring experiments were carried out using the tandem quadrupole mass settings as indicated in the text. Normal phase HPLC was carried out in a 2 Ã 150-mm normal phase silica column (Phenomenex, Rancho Cordova, CA) using a mobile phase of hexane/isopropanol/20 mm ammonium acetate (3/4/0.7) at the flow rate of 200 Î¼l/min. The GC/MS analysis of PAF-like lipids was carried out following hydrolysis of the glycerophosphocholine lipids with phospholipase C, followed by derivatization of the liberated diglycerides with pentafluorobenzoyl chloride as described previously (33Murphy R.C. Snyder F. The Handbook of Lipid Research: Mass Spectrometry of Lipids. Vol. 7. Plenum Press, New York1993Google Scholar). For the quantitative analysis of target molecules, [2H3]PAF was added as internal standard (10 ng) to each aliquot taken for GC/MS analysis prior to treatment with phospholipase C. We extracted and purified the polar lipids from native and oxidized LDL and injected this into the pleural cavity of naive rats. The lipids isolated from oxidized LDL, but not its unoxidized counterpart, induced acute inflammation within 6 h as marked by leukocyte accumulation (Fig. 1 A) and proteinaceous edema (Fig. 1 B). The leukocyte accumulation was characterized by mononuclear cell and early eosinophil influx, but especially by a neutrophilic effusion. Treatment of the lipid preparation with recombinant human plasma acetylhydrolase (which specifically hydrolyzes phospholipids with short sn-2 acyl residues; Refs. 34Stremler K.E. Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5331-5334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 35Stremler K.E. Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11095-11103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) prior to injection into the animals blocked cellular infiltration and the edema. That the inflammatory principle was PAF or PAF-like analogs was strengthened by the potent inhibition of the inflammatory response by in vivo blockade of the PAF receptor with the specific antagonist WEB 2086. We purified the leukocyte agonist in oxidized LDL by quantitating neutrophil adhesion, a measure of CD11/CD18 activation (36Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The lipids derived from oxidized LDL that eluted between 5 and 7 min were leukocyte agonists, and these lipids were not present in native, unoxidized LDL (Fig. 2 A). Like the in vivo events induced by the lipids isolated from oxidized LDL, ex vivo leukocyte activation was blocked by a specific PAF receptor antagonist WEB 2086 and by pretreating these fractions with purified, recombinant PAF acetylhydrolase. Treatment of these fractions with phospholipase A2, phospholipase C, or phospholipase D inactivated the stimulatory compounds in fractions 5â7 (data not shown). This is an important confirmation that the biologically active species were still phospholipids, and were not simply fragments released from oxidizing polyunsaturated acyl residues. We established that the active agent(s) acted through the PAF receptor using 293 cells stably transfected with the human PAF receptor that allows these cells to respond to PAF (Fig.2 B). Each fraction that activated neutrophils also induced a Ca2+ flux in these cells and by doing so, desensitized the ectopic PAF receptor to a second stimulus with PAF (Fig.2 C). The Ca2+ flux in these cells was blocked by co-incubation with WEB 2086 or by pretreatment with PAF acetylhydrolase. Lipids from unoxidized LDL did not activate these cells, showing oxidation truly generates PAF-like phospholipids. We quantitated the amount of PAF equivalents in the active fractions to determine whether this shadowed leukoctye stimulation using a competitive [3H]WEB 2086 displacement assay and purified membranes from hPAFR293 cells (Fig. 2 D). We calculate that there was twice the amount of PAF-like material (equivalent to 20 nm PAF) in fraction 6 than in either fraction 5 or 7 (which contained 9 and 10 nm PAF equivalents, respectively.) Following the treatment of each fraction with recombinant PAF acetylhydrolase competition with [3H]WEB 2086 was lost, and surrounding fractions, or equivalent fractions from unoxidized LDL, also failed to displace [3H]WEB 2086. Oxidation of synthetic diacyl phosphatidylcholines generates PAF-like activity (11Tokumura A. Toujima M. Yoshioka Y. Fukuzawa K. Lipids. 1996; 31: 1251-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 16Smiley P.L. Stremler K.E. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol.

Acta. 1993; 1166: 264-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), suggesting that some particular modification of the fragmented sn-2 acyl residue can overcome the normally strong preference for an sn-1 ether bond. We tested this prediction by oxidizing 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospholcholine and its sn-1 ether homolog 1-O-hexadecyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospholcholine, purifying the oxidation products, and quantitating their mass by phosphorus analysis. When the concentration of the two homologous oxidation products was adjusted to give equivalent amounts of Ca2+ release in leukocytes, we found (Fig.3) that 800-fold more diacyl products were required. This suggests that there is no highly preferredsn-2 residue in oxidized diacyl phosphatidylcholines that can overcome the requirement for an sn-1 ether bond. In light of this information, we determined the nature of thesn-1 bond of the bioactive phospholipids in oxidized LDL. This was done by hydrolyzing diacyl phosphatidylcholines with phospholipase A1 before analysis in the hPAFR293 cell Ca2+ flux assay. Control experiments (Fig.4 A) showed the acyl analog of PAF (which is about 1% as potent as PAF in this assay) was destroyed by this digestion, while PAF with its sn-1 ether bond was unaffected. An identical result was obtained when the oxidation products of 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-glycerophosphocholine and 1-hexadecyl-2-arachidonoyl-glycerophospholcholine were digested. Similarly, phospholipase A1 digestion destroyed nearly all of the phospholipid mass in fractions 5 through 7 derived from oxidized LDL as determined by phosphorus staining of the lipids resolved by TLC (not shown). In contrast, phospholipase A1 did not detectably reduce the PAF-like bioactivity in these fractions (Fig.4 A). We confirmed this result using chemical saponification to completely hydrolyze diacyl compounds, which abolished PAF-like activity of both PAF and acyl-PAF (Fig. 4 B). Chemical acetylation returned the PAF sample to its original level of activity (compare tracings a and c), but did not have a similar effect with acyl-PAF. Saponification of fractions 6 and 7 from oxidized LDL, also completely inactivated the PAF-like activity. Acetylation of the hydrolysis products restored PAF-like activity, a result not possible if fractions 6 and 7 just contained oxidation products derived from diacyl phospholipids. We took advantage of the above findings to obtain"

Platelets are anucleate cells that mediate hemostasis through amplifying an initial stimulus and aggregating at a site of injury. Several agents including thrombin, ADP, and thromboxane A2 activate platelets. Activated platelets change shape, secrete Î±-granules and dense granules, and release positive feedback mediators (1Holmsen H. Eur J Clin Invest. 1994; 24 Suppl. 1: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). When platelets are initially stimulated, the first event is a rearrangement of the cytoskeletal proteins (actin and myosin), and the normally disc-shaped cells change into spheres with filopodia (1Holmsen H. Eur J Clin Invest. 1994; 24 Suppl. 1: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 2Wurzinger L.J. Adv. Anat. Embryol. Cell Biol. 1990; 120: 1-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of phospholipase A2 releases arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids, which is converted into thromboxane A2. Serotonin and ADP, released from dense granules, and thromboxane A2 function as positive feedback mediators, which recruit more platelets into a primary hemostatic plug (3Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1-5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have been investigating the intracellular events involved in agonist-induced platelet activation. Recently, we proposed a three-receptor model to explain the signaling events in platelet activation by ADP (for reviews, see Refs. 4Kunapuli S.P. Daniel J.L. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 513-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar and 5Kunapuli S.P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 391-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Through the use of receptor-specific antagonists, we have provided evidence for different functional roles for different P2 receptor subtypes present on platelets (6Jin J. Daniel J.L. Kunapuli S.P.

Platelets express two G protein-coupled P2 receptor subtypes: a P2TAC receptor subtype, coupled to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase via the heterotrimeric inhibitory G-protein, Gi, and P2Y1 receptor, coupled to the heterotrimeric protein Gq. Activation of the P2Y1 receptor results in the activation of phospholipase C, production of diacylglycerol, and mobilization of cytosolic Ca2+ in response to IP3 production. ATP acts as an antagonist at both the P2Y1 and P2TAC receptors while acting as an agonist at the ionotropic P2X1 receptor, the third ADP receptor on platelets (7Daniel J.L. Dangelmaier C. Jin J.

While ADP-induced platelet aggregation requires coactivation of both the P2Y1 and the P2TACreceptors (9Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2030-2034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Similarly, activation of Gq-coupled 5HT2A receptors by serotonin is also sufficient to induce shape change (9Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

During platelet shape change, the discoid cells undergo cytoskeletal changes including the disassembly of a microtubule ring that results in an intermediate spherical shape. This is followed by actin polymerization and the slower extension of filopodia (11Deranleau D.A. Dubler D. Rothen C. Luscher E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1998; 95: 8070-8074Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), our investigation has focused on the role of intracellular signaling events mediating shape change. Here, we provide evidence that platelet shape change incorporates both Ca2+-dependent and -independent mechanisms for cytoskeletal rearrangement. We have used 5,5â²-dimethyl-BAPTA to prevent the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ that occurs following Gq activation. Previous studies (e.g. Jen et al. (29Jen C.J. Chen H.I. Lai K.C. Usami S. Blood. 1996; 87: 3775-3782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) have successfully used 5,5â²-dimethyl-BAPTA to prevent increases in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration without deleterious effects on either cell viability or morphology. Through the use of p160ROCK-selective inhibitors, Y-27632 and HA 1077, we investigated the role of the RhoA/p160ROCK pathway in platelet response. We show that both Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase and the RhoA/p160ROCK pathways contribute to ADP-induced platelet shape change and regulation of myosin light chain phosphorylation. Apyrase (type V), ADP, fibrinogen, and bovine serum albumin (fraction V) were from Sigma. The acetoxymethyl ester of Fura PE-3 was from Teflabs (Austin, TX). The acetoxymethyl ester of 5,5â²-dimethyl-BAPTA, U46619 (a stable analog of thromboxane A2), Staurosporine, HA 1077, GF 109203X (bisindolylmaleimide I), Ro 31â8220 (bisindolylmaleimide IX), and phorbol-12-myristyl-13-acetate were from BioMol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Bovine thrombin was from Parke, Davis and Co. (Detroit, MI). Y-27632 was a gift from Yoshitomi Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). SC-57101 was a gift from Searle Research and Development (Skokie, IL). Ultrapure acrylamide gel reagents were from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA) except for Tris base, dithiothreitol, and glycine, which were purchased from Fisher. All other chemicals were reagent grade, and deionized water was used throughout. Human blood was collected from a pool of informed healthy volunteers, all of whom are students or staff at Temple University School of Medicine. The donated blood was collected into a one-sixth volume of ACD (2.5 g of sodium citrate, 1.5 g of citric acid, and 2.0 g of glucose in 100 ml of deionized H2O). Platelet-rich plasma was isolated by centrifugation of citrated blood at 180 Ã g for 15 min at room temperature. Platelet-rich plasma was incubated at 37 Â°C with 3 Î¼m Fura PE-3 acetoxymethyl ester and 1 mmacetylsalicylic acid for 15 min followed by the addition of either 50 Î¼m 5,5â²-dimethyl-BAPTA acetoxymethyl ester or a corresponding volume of the vehicle, dimethyl sulfoxide, and further incubation for 30 min. After 15 min at room temperature, the platelet-rich plasma was centrifuged at 1000 Ã g for 10 min at room temperature. The platelet pellet was resuspended in calcium-free HEPES-buffered Tyrode's solution (7Daniel J.L. Dangelmaier C. Jin J. Ashby B. Smith J.B. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2024-2029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 20 Î¼g/ml apyrase. The platelet count was adjusted to 2 Ã 108 cells/ml. All experiments were repeated at least three times using platelets from different donors. Aliquots (1.0 ml) of the platelet suspension were stirred in a water-jacketed cuvette maintained at 37 Â°C during activation. Fluorescence was constantly measured using a Perkin-Elmer LS-5 spectrofluorimeter with settings of 340 nm (excitation) and 510 nm (emission). Fura PE-3 fluorescence signals were calibrated as described previously (30Smith J.B. Dangelmaier C. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 187: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Fmin was determined by the addition of 2 mm EGTA and 20 mm Tris base.Fmax was determined by lysing the cells with 40 Î¼m digitonin in the presence of saturating CaCl2. Agonist-induced platelet aggregation was determined by measuring the transmission of light through a 0.5-ml sample of aspirinated washed platelets (2 Ã 108 cells/ml) with stirring in a lumiaggregometer at 37 Â°C (Chrono-Log, Havertown, PA). The base line was set using 0.5 ml of Tyrode's solution as a blank. Aggregation of washed platelets required the addition of fibrinogen (1 mg/ml) prior to the addition of an agonist, with the recorder output speed set to 0.2 mm/s. Platelet shape change was observed by the addition of 10 Î¼m SC-57101 before agonist stimulation as described earlier (6Jin J. Daniel J.L. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2030-2034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 14Daniel J.L. Molish I.R. Rigmaiden M. Stewart G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9826-9831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SC-57101 is a known inhibitor of platelet aggregation through blocking fibrinogen binding to its receptor (31Zablocki J.A. Miyano M. Garland R.B. Pireh D. Schretzman L. Rao S.N. Lindmark R.J. Panzer-Knodle S.G. Nicholson N.S. Taite B.B. Salyers A.K. King L.W. Campion J.G. Feigen L.P. J. Med. Chem. 1993; 36: 1811-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Three shape change curve characteristics were measured. First, the time from the addition of agonist to initiation of shape change. Second, the time from initiation of shape change to the point where shape change is half complete (or time to reach half-maximal light absorbance). Third, the initial rate constant of the shape change curve. In order to better resolve these three shape change curve characteristics, results were printed out using a Kipp and Zonen BD-41 (Fisher) analog recorder with the output speed set to 1 mm/s. The initial rate constant was determined using the program Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA) by graphing the fraction of shape change complete (fraction of maximal light absorbance) versus time, and the resulting points were fit with the exponential equation, y = 1 â e âkt, where krepresents the initial rate constant of platelet shape change andt is the time. The percentage of 20-kDa myosin light chain in the phosphorylated form was determined using a protocol (32Daniel J.L. Molish I.R. Holmsen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7510-7514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that was adapted from a modification (33Siemankowski R.F. Dreizen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8648-8658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the method described by Perrie and Perry (34Perrie W.T. Perry S.V. Biochem. J. 1970; 119: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). In brief, aspirinated platelets were resuspended in Tyrode's solution at a concentration of 2 Ã 109 cells/ml. Aliquots (0.5 ml) were stirred at 37 Â°C during stimulation in the lumiaggregometer. At specific time points, 25 Î¼l of 6.6 n HClO4was added, and the resulting acid precipitate was collected and chilled on ice. The pellets were centrifuged at 10,000 Ã g for 2 min followed first by rinsing and then resuspension in 1 ml of ice-cold deionized water. The protein was again pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 Ã g for 2 min. Protein pellets were dissolved in 50 Î¼l of sample buffer containing 8m urea, 20 mm Tris, 122 mm glycine, 5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.6, with approximately 0.1% bromphenol blue dye. The suspended pellets were further dissolved by sonication in a Branson (Shelton, CT) sonication bath. Gel electrophoresis was performed using 10% polyacrylamide slab gels containing 40% (v/v) glycerol with a 3.6% polyacrylamide stacking gel containing 8 m urea in a Bio-Rad model 220 (100-mm) gel apparatus. The running buffer used in the top chamber was 20 mm Tris, 122 mm glycine at pH 8.6 containing 4 mm urea. The samples were loaded onto the gels and electrophoresed at 8â9 mA for each gel plate being used. The electrophoresis was stopped 1 h after the bromphenol blue marker dye had come off the bottom of the gel. Gels were stained for 1 h in 0.05% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, destained, and scanned using a Hoeffer (San Francisco, CA) scanning densitometer hooked up to a Macintosh II computer via a National Instruments Corporation (Austin, TX) DAQ conversion board. The density peaks correlating to the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated myosin light chains as well as the 16-kDa band were analyzed using the program Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). The data points were fit using a three-peak gaussian equation. The amount of total myosin light chain in the phosphorylated form was determined by dividing the area of the phosphorylated peak by the combined areas of the phosphorylated and the nonphosphorylated myosin light chain peaks. Results were expressed as the percentage of total myosin light chain in the phosphorylated form. To investigate the role of the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ in agonist-induced platelet shape change, we loaded the platelets with Fura PE-3, either alone or in combination with the cytosolic Ca2+ chelator 5,5â²-dimethyl-BAPTA, and measured the fluorescence response. The normal increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, which occurs in response to ADP, thrombin, and U46619 (Fig.1 A), did not occur in the platelets loaded with 5,5â²-dimethyl-BAPTA (Fig. 1 B). Thesetraces are representative of experiments performed to establish (and reconfirm) the absence of an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ due to Ca2+ chelation by 5,5â²-dimethyl-BAPTA. In the absence of an increase in cytosolic Ca2+, platelets did not aggregate in response to ADP, thrombin, or U46619 (Fig.2), indicating that an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ is essential for fibrinogen receptor activation. However, agonist-induced platelet shape change still occurred. Close examination revealed that shape change in platelets treated with 5,5â²-dimethyl-BAPTA possess different characteristics from shape change occurring in control platelets. It is first apparent that the rate of increase in light absorbance (indicating the change in platelet shape from disc to spiny sphere) was significantly slower. Moreover, a delay in the initiation of shape change following the addition of an agonist can be observed. After repeating each of these conditions three or more times in three different donors, we quantitated and compared these three features of platelet shape changes in normal platelets and 5,5â²-dimethyl-BAPTA-treated platelets. In order to do so, the recorder's printout speed was increased to give greater resolution. In the absence of an increase in cytosolic Ca2+concentration, the time to initiate shape change increased substantially for all agonists examined (Fig.3 A). The time for half-completion of shape change was also dramatically increased in 5,5â²-dimethyl-BAPTA-treated platelets (Fig. 3 B). A significant decrease in the initial rate of shape change was observed for U46619 (â¼40% of control) and both ADP and thrombin (â¼60% of control) (Fig. 3 C).Figure 3The effect of 5,5â²-dimethyl-BAPTA on three characteristics of agonist-induced platelet shape change. Platelet shape change was induced by 10 Î¼m ADP, 0.1 unit/ml thrombin, or 1 Î¼m U46619 in aspirinated platelets that were previously treated with either vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide, labeled control) or with 50 Î¼m5,5â²-dimethyl-BAPTA acetoxymethyl ester as indicated. Agonist-induced platelet shape change characteristics were measured as described under âExperimental Procedures.â The time from the addition of agonist until the initiation of platelet shape change (A), the time to half-complete shape change (point at which half-maximal light absorbance was reached) (B), and the initial rate of light absorbance during platelet shape change (change in absorbance/s) (C) as compared with control values are presented. Results are presented as mean values Â± S.E. (n = 6). The effect of 5,5â²-dimethyl-BAPTA as compared with control is significant in each case (p < 0.01, Student's unpairedt test).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In normal platelets following stimulation by ADP, thrombin, and U46619, there was a large increase in the percentage of phosphorylated myosin light chain (Fig.4). When the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration was prevented with 5,5â²-dimethyl-BAPTA, the levels of phosphorylated myosin light chain were dramatically reduced in platelets stimulated with ADP, thrombin, and U46619 compared with vehicle-loaded platelets. The difference in levels of phosphorylated myosin light chain in 5,5â²-dimethyl-BAPTA-treated platelets following agonist stimulation was significant (p < 0.05; n = 3). In the absence of agonist stimulation, there was a very minor increase in the level of phosphorylated myosin light chain in 5,5â²-dimethyl-BAPTA-treated platelets; however, the difference between the level of phosphorylation in unstimulated treated platelets and unstimulated control platelets was not significant (Fig. 4 B). Measuring the amount of phosphorylated myosin light chain at the above time points (2, 20, and 45 s) gave only a partial indication of the signaling events following agonist stimulation. Shape change begins 2 s after the addition of ADP to control platelets. This is in contrast to 5,5â²-dimethyl-BAPTA-treated platelets, in which ADP-induced shape change did not begin until after 7.5 s following the addition of agonist. Therefore, we analyzed the changes in myosin light chain phosphorylation over time in vehicle-treated control platelets and compared our findings to changes in myosin light chain phosphorylation over time in 5,5â²-dimethyl-BAPTA-treated platelets (Fig. 5). Both the extent and rate of myosin light chain phosphorylation were dramatically inhibited in the absence of an increase in cytosolic Ca2+. A peak in myosin light chain phosphorylation occurred at 2 s in control platelets in contrast to a lesser peak in myosin light chain phosphorylation occurring at 30 s in 5,5â²-dimethyl-BAPTA-treated platelets. ADP-induced shape change is mediated through stimulation of the Gq-coupled P2Y1 receptor (6Jin J. Daniel J.L. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2030-2034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Gq-coupled receptors mediate the activation of serine/threonine PKC isoforms (35Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar). Using two cell-permeable inhibitors of PKC, Ro 31â8220 and GF 109203X, we investigated whether PKC stimulated by ADP, thrombin, or U46619 mediates Ca2+-independent platelet shape change. The Î±-, Î²-, and Î³-isoforms of PKC are potently inhibited by Ro 31â8220 and GF 109203X with in vitro IC50 values of 5â27 nm and 16â20 nm, respectively (36Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H.

Neither of these compounds had an effect on agonist-induced platelet shape change in either the presence or absence of an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ (data not shown). Staurosporine is a potent and nonspecific inhibitor of both tyrosine and serine/threonine protein kinases.

The genes that mutate to give rise to these disorders encode highly homologous copper transporting ATPases. We use yeast and mammalian two-hybrid systems, along with anin vitro assay to demonstrate a specific, copper-dependent interaction between the six metal-binding domains of the WD and MNK ATPases and the cytoplasmic copper chaperone HAH1. We demonstrate that several metal-binding domains interact independently or in combination with HAH1p, although notably domains five and six of WDp do not. Alteration of either the Met or Thr residue of the HAH1p MTCXXC motif has no observable effect on the copper-dependent interaction, whereas alteration of either of the two Cys residues abolishes the interaction. Mutation of any one of the HAH1p C-terminal Lys residues (Lys56, Lys57, or Lys60) to Gly does not affect the interaction, although deletion of the 15 C-terminal residues abolishes the interaction. We show that apo-HAH1p can bind in vitroto copper-loaded WDp, suggesting reversibility of copper transfer from HAH1p to WD/MNKp.

In excess, both cupric and cuprous ions are highly toxic, because they act as electron transfer intermediates and catalyze the formation of hydroxyl radicals. This copper-induced production of reactive oxygen species results in DNA damage, as evidenced by strand breaks and by base oxidation of guanosine within cellular DNA and in lipid peroxidation of membranes, especially in mitochondria and lysosomes (7Bremner I. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1998; 67: 1069S-1073SCrossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Thus, proper copper trafficking is essential to cell vitality. Dietary copper is absorbed into the body through the intestinal mucosa where it joins recycled endogenous copper secreted into the gastrointestinal tract from other tissues. In general, dietary copper absorption is dependent upon the amount of copper reabsorbed from the fluids of other tissues. Newly absorbed copper is transported to body tissues in two phases. First, albumin, transcuprein, amino acids, and a group of uncharacterized low molecular weight proteins transport the majority of exchangeable copper to the liver. After traversing the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes, copper is distributed to endogenous copper-requiring enzymes and to secreted cuproproteins such as ceruloplasmin, which is thereafter released to plasma for delivery of copper to other tissues. Any excess copper is excreted to the bile by the way of the canalicular (apical) plasma membrane (see Refs. 3Linder M.C. Wooten L. Cerveza P. Cotton S. Shulze R. Lomeli N. Am. J. Clin.

Mutations in these two genes lead to disorders of copper starvation (Menkes disease) and copper toxicity (Wilson disease), respectively. ATP7A is expressed in all tissues except liver, and mutations in this gene prevent the normal absorption and distribution of copper throughout the body. The resulting copper depletion leads to multi-system disorder and death in childhood. The ATP7B gene is expressed in most tissues but predominantly in the liver. Mutations in this gene lead to excessive copper buildup in the liver.

Recent studies show that the molecular components of copper trafficking pathways are highly conserved between yeast and humans. InSaccharomyces cerevisiae, the pathway begins with Cu+ uptake through the action of copper transporters CTR1p and CTR3p (13Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol.

CCC2p is then required to transfer copper from the cytosol to the lumen of the trans-Golgi network where the multi-copper ferrooxidase Fet3p, yeast homologue of ceruloplasmin, is loaded (22Yuan D.S.

Based on their subcellular localization, Lin and Culotta (15Lin S.J. Pufahl R.A. Dancis A. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol.

Recently, Pufahl et al. (17Pufahl R.A. Singer C.P. Peariso K.L. Lin S. Schmidt P.J. Fahrni C.J. Culotta V.C. Penner-Hahn J.E. Science. 1997; 278: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar) used the yeast two-hybrid protocol to demonstrate a copper-dependent interaction between ATX1p and CCC2p. In this study we show that human homologues of the yeast proteins ATX1p and CCC2p interact in a copper-dependent manner. Using three independent assays we characterize the interaction of HAH1p (Human ATX1-like Homolog) with the homologous Wilson disease (WDp) and Menkes disease (MNKp) proteins. The WD and MNK genes encode six MTCXXC motifs in the N-terminal portion of their proteins, whereas their prokaryotic and yeast counterparts typically encode one or two such motifs (24Odermatt A. Suter H. Krapf R. Solioz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12775-12779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Francis M.S. Thomas C.J. Mol. Gen.

Using deletion constructs of the WDp metal-binding domain, we provide evidence that a single MTCXXC motif is sufficient to interact with the HAH1p chaperone. Mutagenesis analysis demonstrates that the interaction is dependent on the co-coordination of copper ions by cysteine residues within the MTCXXC motifs of the interacting HAH1 and WD proteins. The data suggest a mechanism for the intermolecular transfer of copper ions similar to the âbucket brigadeâ model previously proposed for the trafficking of toxic ions in bacterial mercury detoxification (27Steele R.A. Opella S.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6885-6895Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 28Brown N.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1985; 10: 400-403Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The entire coding region from a human liver HAH1 cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the expression vectors pACT2 (CLONTECH), pVP16 (CLONTECH), and pProEx-HTb (Life Technologies, Inc.) to create the plasmid constructs pACT-HAH1, pVP-HAH1, and pHTb-HAH1. To create point mutations within the MTCXXC motif, nucleotide changes were introduced directly into the primers for polymerase chain reaction amplification. Plasmids pACT-WM (without Met), pVP-WM, and pHTb-WM carry HAH1 cDNA with the mutation Met10 â Val. Plasmids pACT-WT (without Thr), pVP-WT, and pHTb-WT carry HAH1 cDNA with the mutation Thr11 â Ala. Plasmids pACT-WC1 (without first Cys), pVP-WC1, and pHTb-WC1 carry an HAH1 cDNA with the Cys12 â Tyr mutation. Plasmids pACT-WC2 (without second Cys), pVP-WC2, and pHTb-WC2 carry an HAH1 cDNA with the Cys15 â Tyr mutation. Plasmids pACT-W15N, pVP-W15N, and pHTb-W15N encode HAH1p without the 15 N-terminal amino acid residues. Plasmids pACT-W15C, pVP-W15C, and pHTb-W15C encode HAH1p without the 15 C-terminal amino acid residues. Plasmids pACT-HAH-C12G and pACT-HAH-C15G carry an HAH1 cDNA with a Cys â Gly mutation in the first and second cysteines of the MTCXXC motif, respectively. Plasmids pACT-HAH-K56G, pACT-HAH-K57G, and pACT-HAH-K60G harbor Lys â Gly mutations at one of the Lys residues located at the C-terminal region of HAH1p. A fragment of WD cDNA encoding the entire metal-binding domain of WDp (coordinates Leu19âIle599) was cloned into the expression vectors pAS2â1 and pM (CLONTECH) to produce the plasmids pAS-CBM16 (copper-binding motifs 1â6) and pM-CBM16, respectively. The plasmid pMAL-c2/N-WD encodes a fusion of the maltose-binding protein and the metal-binding domain of WDp and has been described previously (29Lutsenko S. Petrukhin K. Cooper M.J. Gilliam T.C. Kaplan J.H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18939-18944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Plasmids pAS-CBM15, pAS-CBM14, pM-CBM14, pAS-CBM56, pAS-CBM13, pAS-CBM24, pAS-CBM23, pAS-CBM1, pAS-CBM2, and pAS-CBM3 encode fragments of the metal-binding domain of the WD protein containing metal-binding motifs 1â5, 1â4, 1â4, 5â6, 1â3, 2â4, 2â3, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Plasmids pAS-CBM14-W1 and pAS-CBM1-WMCC are identical to pAS-CBM14 and pAS-CBM1, respectively, except both harbor an altered first metal-binding motif (MTCQSC â ATAQSA). These alterations were implemented with the Muta-Gene Phagmidin vitro mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad). Plasmid pAS-MNK encodes a GAL4 DNA-binding domain-MNKp metal-binding domain fusion protein. All constructs were verified by sequence analysis. DNA sequencing was performed with the dideoxy chain termination method using theTaq Dye Deoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) as recommended by the supplier. The reactions were analyzed on an ABI model 373A automated sequencer. The yeast two-hybrid assay was performed according to the protocol supplied by the yeast two-hybrid system supplier (CLONTECH). HepG2 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 Î¼m nonessential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin, at 37 Â°C in 5% CO2. Cells were seeded at a density of 3.2 Ã 106/100-mm tissue culture dish the day before transfection. Transfection of HepG2 cells with plasmid DNA was performed using the DOSPER liposomal transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 12.5 Î¼g of both the pM- and pVP16-based plasmids, 2.5 Î¼g of reporter plasmid pG5CAT, and 100 Î¼l of DOSPER reagent were used per dish. Four days after transfection the cells were lysed, and CAT expression was assayed using the CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Escherichia coliSG20050 cells were transformed with the plasmids pHTb-HAH1, pHTb-WM, pHTb-WT, pHTb-WC1, pHTb-WC2, pHTb-W15N, and pHTb-W15C. Proteins were expressed using the ProEx-HT Prokaryotic Expression system (Life Technologies, Inc.) and purified using the nickel nitrilotriacetic acid spin kit (Qiagen). The amylose resin bound fusion product, maltose-binding protein-WDp metal-binding domain, was purified essentially as described by Lutsenko et al. (29Lutsenko S. Petrukhin K. Cooper M.J. Gilliam T.C. Kaplan J.H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18939-18944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Maltose-binding protein was obtained from New England Biolabs. Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The histidine tag was removed by cleavage with TEV protease (Life Technologies, Inc.) followed by chromatography on nickel nitrilotriacetic acid spin columns and dialysis. Purified proteins were loaded with copper by incubation in a solution containing 15 Î¼m cupric chloride in TBS-DTT (Tris-buffered saline with 25 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmDTT, pH 7.5) at 25 Â°C for 4 h. Excess copper was removed by overnight dialysis in TBS-DTT at 4 Â°C. 200 Î¼g of HAH1p (normal or mutated, loaded or not loaded with copper) was incubated with 1 ml of TBS-DTT containing either 200 Î¼g of amylose resin-bound fusion product of maltose-binding protein-metal-binding domain of the WDp or 100 Î¼g of amylose resin-bound maltose-binding protein at 25 Â°C for 3 h with shaking. The resin was washed four times with TBS-DTT, and proteins were eluted with 10 mm maltose in TBS-DTT. Equal aliquots of eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE in a Tris-Tricine buffer system. The gel system consisted of a 16.5% separating gel, a 10% spacer gel, and a 4% stacking gel, each made with a 32:1 ratio of acrylamide:bisacrylamide. After gel separation, proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. To test whether HAH1p transfers copper directly to WDp, we used the yeast two-hybrid assay. The entire 68-amino acid coding region of HAH1 cDNA was fused in frame to the activation domain of GAL4 (in pACT2 vector), whereas a fragment of WD cDNA encoding 623 N-terminal amino acids was fused in frame to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (in pAS2â1 vector). The WD protein is predicted to possess eight membrane-spanning domains along with four cytoplasmic domains. The six MTCXXC metal-binding motifs are all encoded within the 623-amino acid N-terminal cytoplasmic domain. The two-hybrid plasmids were co-introduced into S. cerevisiae Y187 cells, which contain both the lacZ and his3 reporter genes with upstream GAL4-binding sites. Interaction of the two fusion proteins is necessary to juxtapose the GAL4 DNA-binding and activation domains, which then activate transcription of the reporter genes. Results of these experiments are shown in Fig.1. The experiment was conducted with vector plasmids only (lane 1), single vector plasmid plus single fusion construct (lanes 2 and 3), both fusion constructs (lane 4), and laminin fusion construct plus HAH1p fusion construct (lane 5). It is clear that the Î²-galactosidase reporter gene is only activated in yeast cells expressing both the WDp metal-binding domain and HAH1p fusion proteins (Fig. 1, lane 4). These results indicate that HAH1p interacts directly with the N-terminal domain of WDp. The strength of signal (2.72 Î²-galactosidase units) was low relative to positive control plasmids (176.5 Î²-galactosidase units; data not shown) but much higher than negative controls (0.01â0.04 Î²-galactosidase units; Fig. 1, lanes 1â3 and 5). We observed the same strength of interaction when the two proteins were cloned in opposite vectors (data not shown). All results obtained from the Î²-galactosidase assay usingo-nitrophenyl-Î²-d-galactopyranoside as substrate were confirmed both by substituting 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl Î²-d-galactopyranoside as substrate and in yeast mating experiments that measure activation of the alternative reporter gene, his3 (data not shown). The presence of 3 mm BCA in the growth medium abolishes the interaction of WDp and HAH1p (Fig. 1, lane 6), suggesting that copper is required for this interaction. In the next set of experiments, we sought to determine which MTCXXC motifs, or combination of motifs, are required for interaction with HAH1p. Results of the yeast two-hybrid analysis are shown in Fig. 2. Fusion constructs were generated that contain the full complement of six metal-binding motifs (lane 1) along with various combinations of motifs beginning with the N-terminal most motif 1 to the C-terminal most motif 6: 1â5 (lane 2), 1â4 (lane 3), 5 and 6 (lane 4), 1â3 (lane 5), 2â4 (lane 6), 2 and 3 (lane 7), 1 only (lane 8), 2 only (lane 9), and 3 only (lane 10). The various combinations and numbers of WD metal-binding motifs have only marginal effect on ability to interact with HAH1p with two exceptions. The four N-terminal most motifs (lane 3) promote approximately five times more activity than full length peptide (lane 1), whereas the two C-terminal most motifs generate no evidence of interaction (lane 4). With these two exceptions, various combinations of one, two, or three metal-binding motifs promote virtually the same amounts of Î²-galactosidase activity. Alteration of the MTCXXC motif abolishes the interaction as shown by comparison of intact motif 1 (lane 9) and motif 1 containing the MTCQSC â ATAQSA alteration (lane 12). In the next set of experiments, we used direct mutagenesis to systematically alter each of the four conserved amino residues in the single MTCXXC motif of the HAH1 protein and then assayed the mutant proteins for copper mediated interaction with WDp. Fig. 3 shows that normal HAH1p (lane 2) and HAH1p with amino acid alterations at MTCXXC (lane 4) and M T CXXC (lane 5) interact with the metal-binding domain of WDp. By contrast, alterations at MT C XXC and MTCXX C residues (lanes 6,7, 12, and 13) abolish the interaction. We also see in Fig. 3 that omission of the N-terminal (lane 3) or C-terminal (lane 8) 15 amino acid residues of HAH1p likewise disrupts the interaction. In addition to the MTCXXC motif at the N terminus of HAH1p, this protein also harbors three lysine residues at its C terminus, which are highly conserved among eukaryotes. In Fig. 3 we show that mutations Lys56 â Gly, Lys57 â Gly, and Lys60 â Gly do not affect the interaction between HAH1p and WDp as measured by the yeast two-hybrid system (lanes 9â11). To better approximate the in vivo environment of a putative copper trafficking interaction between the HAH1 and WD proteins, we next measured the interaction in HepG2 hepatoma cells. Fragments of the WD cDNA encoding either 623 or 499 N-terminal amino acid residues were cloned into the pM vector to produce fusion products of six and four WDp metal-binding domains, respectively, with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. The entire coding region of the HAH1 gene was cloned into the pVP16 vector to produce a fusion product consisting of the activation domain of the herpes simplex virus VP16 protein and HAH1p. We co-transfected HepG2 cells with pM andpVP16-based plasmids plus a reporter plasmid (pCAT) containing a CAT gene downstream of four GAL4-binding sites and minimum adenovirus E1b promoter. Interestingly, fusion proteins containing all six metal-binding motifs interact minimally, if at all, with HAH1p (Fig. 4, lane 2), whereas protein encoding the four N-terminal most motifs interact more strongly (lanes 3â5). Interaction between WDp and HAH1p is blocked by altering either cysteine group (lanes 6 and 7) or by deleting either the 15 N-terminal most (lane 8) or 15 C-terminal most (lane 9) amino acid residues of HAH1p. Alteration of the methionine or threonine residue of the MTCXXC motif of HAH1p does not disrupt the interaction (lanes 4 and 5). Expression constructs were generated that encode first the entire HAH1 coding segment and second a fusion product consisting of the WDp metal-binding domain and the maltose-binding protein (MBP). E. coli SG20050 cells were transformed with these constructs, and the protein products were purified. HAH1p was subsequently incubated with 15 Î¼m CuCl2 in TBS-DTT, followed by removal of unbound copper by dialysis. The MBP-WDp fusion products (Fig. 5 A,lanes 4 and 5) or MBP alone (lanes 2and 3) were bound to amylose resin and incubated with preparations of HAH1p that were either loaded (lanes 3 and5) or not loaded (lanes 2 and 4) with copper. Bound protein was then eluted with 10 mm maltose and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fig. 5 A shows that the metal-binding domain of the WD protein binds specifically to HAH1 protein preloaded with copper (lane 5). In the next experiment (Fig. 5 B) the various mutant forms of HAH1p were preincubated with copper and then incubated with amylose resin-bound MBP-WDp fusion protein. Proteins bound to the resin were subsequently eluted with maltose and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Consistent with the yeast and mammalian two-hybrid assays results, intact HAH1p (lane 1), M TCXXC modified HAH1p (lane 3), and M T CXXC modified HAH1p (lane 4) were capable of binding the WDp fusion protein, whereas MT C XXC (lane 5) and MTCXX C (lane 6) modified HAH1p and HAH1p missing either the N-terminal (lane 2) or C-terminal amino acids (lane 7) were incapable of binding fusion protein. In this experiment, HAH1p constructs were loaded with copper, whereas resin-bound MBP-Dp fusion protein was copper deficient (see âExperimental Proceduresâ). The results of the mutagenesis experiments suggest that both Cys residues of the HAH1p MTCXXC motif (copper donor) are required for interaction with WDp (copper acceptor). The inverse experiment with copper-deficient HAH1p mutants and copper loaded resin-bound MBP-WDp fusion generated identical results (Fig. 5 C), suggesting that both Cys residues of the HAH1p MTCXXC motif (in this case, copper acceptor) are required for interaction with WDp (copper donor). Thus, four Cys residues, two from the copper donor and two from the copper acceptor, are required for the copper-dependent interaction. The MNK and WD proteins are highly homologous, sharing 55% amino acid identity (30Petrukhin K. Lutsenko S. Chernov I. Ross B.M. Kaplan J.H. Gilliam T.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 1647-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Both proteins contain six metal-binding MTCXXC motifs in their N-terminal portion, as well as a signature inter-membrane CPC motif and all characteristic motifs of P-type ATPases. In this set of experiments, we tested whether MNKp interacts with the HAH1 protein using the yeast two-hybrid assay. Fig. 6 (lane 2) shows that the strength of the HAH1p/MNKp interaction is similar to that of the HAH1p/WDp interaction (Fig. 1, lane 4). Addition of 3 mm BCA to the growth medium abolishes the protein-protein interaction (Fig. 6, lane 3), suggesting that copper is required for this interaction. The pattern of MNKp interaction with altered variants of HAH1p (Fig. 6, lanes 4â14) is the same as for the WD protein (Fig. 3). Amino acid alterations at M TCXXC (Fig. 6, lane 5), M T CXXC (lane 6), Lys56, Lys57, and Lys60(lanes 10â12) of HAH1p do not affect the HAH1p/MNKp interaction. By contrast, alterations at MT C XXC and MTCXX C (lanes 7, 8,13, and 14), as well as omission of the N-terminal (lane 4) or C-terminal (lane 9) 15 amino acid residues of HAH1p completely disrupts the interaction. In these experiments purified HAH1p was preincubated with a variety of metal ions. To test metalospecificity of the in vitro interaction of the WDp metal-binding domain and HAH1p, we preincubated HAH1p with different metal ions. After removal of unbound metal by dialysis, HAH1p was incubated with amylose resin-bound MBP-WDp fusion protein. Proteins bound to the resin were eluted with maltose and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fig. 7 shows that the metal-binding domain of WDp binds to HAH1 protein that has been preincubated with either Cu2+ or Hg2+ but not with Zn2+, Cd2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Fe3+, or Cr3+.

https://openalex.org/W2152137138,"We describe a line of mutant Chinese hamster ovary cells, designated SRD-13A, that cannot cleave sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) at site 1, due to mutations in the gene encoding SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP). The SRD-13A cells were obtained by two rounds of Î³-irradiation followed first by selection for a deficiency of low density lipoprotein receptors and second for cholesterol auxotrophy. In the SRD-13A cells, the only detectable SCAP allele encodes a truncated nonfunctional protein. In the absence of SCAP, the site 1 protease fails to cleave SREBPs, and their transcriptionally active NH2-terminal fragments cannot enter the nucleus. As a result, the cells manifest a marked reduction in the synthesis of cholesterol and its uptake from low density lipoproteins. The SRD-13A cells grow only when cholesterol is added to the culture medium. SREBP cleavage is restored and the cholesterol requirement is abolished when SRD-13A cells are transfected with expression vectors encoding SCAP. These results provide formal proof that SCAP is essential for the cleavage of SREBPs at site 1.

SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) is a membrane-bound regulatory protein that forms a complex with SREBPs and facilitates proteolytic release of the active fragments (2Sakai J. Nohturfft A.

SCAP contains a sterol-sensing domain that allows sterols to suppress SREBP cleavage, thereby mediating feedback suppression of lipid synthesis and uptake (4Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L.

The transcriptionally active NH2-terminal segment of â¼480 amino acids projects into the cytosol. This segment contains a basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper sequence that allows the protein to dimerize, to bind DNA, and to recruit transcriptional coactivators (6Naar A.M. Beaurang P.A.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5285-5291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal segment is followed by a 90-amino acid membrane attachment segment that consists of two membrane-spanning helices separated by a short hydrophilic loop of 31 amino acids that projects into the lumen of the ER and nuclear envelope. The third segment of the SREBP comprises â¼590 amino acids that project into the cytosol, where they form a complex with SCAP. This segment has been called the regulatory domain (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3004) Google Scholar). SCAP is a polytopic membrane protein of 1276 amino acids that has two distinct domains. The NH2-terminal domain of â¼730 amino acids consists of eight transmembrane helices separated by hydrophilic loops (5Nohturfft A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17243-17250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Transmembrane helices 2â6 have been designated the sterol-sensing domain (5Nohturfft A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17243-17250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This domain resembles sequences in three other proteins that are postulated to interact with sterols: 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, the Niemann-Pick C1 protein, and the developmental receptor Patched (4Hua X.

Missense mutations at two positions within this domain of SCAP render cleavage of SREBPs insensitive to suppression by sterols (9Nohturfft A. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13709-13714Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal domain of SCAP (â¼550 amino acids) is hydrophilic and projects into the cytosol. It contains five WD repeats (5Nohturfft A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17243-17250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), which are sequences of â¼40 amino acids that are found in many proteins where they mediate protein-protein interactions (10Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal WD repeat domain is the region of SCAP that forms a complex with the COOH-terminal regulatory domain of SREBPs (2Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Cheng D. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20213-20221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Proteolytic release of the NH2-terminal fragments of SREBPs begins with the action of site 1 protease (S1P), a membrane-bound serine protease that cleaves within the luminal loop, thereby separating the two transmembrane helices (11Sakai J. Rawson R.B. Espenshade P.J. Cheng D. Seegmiller A.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 505-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). S1P is distantly related to the mammalian subtilisin-like proteases furin and the prohormone convertases. It cleaves after the leucine of the sequence Arg-Ser-Val-Leu (RSVL) (12Duncan E.A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Sakai J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12778-12785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Extensive, but so far indirect, experiments suggest that formation of the SCAPÂ·SREBP complex is essential for the proteolytic cleavage of SREBPs by S1P (3Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5785-5793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). These experiments were performed with SREBP-2, one of the three isoforms of SREBP found in animal cells. The observations are as follows: 1) COOH-terminal truncations of SREBP-2 prevent formation of a complex with SCAP and abrogate cleavage of the SREBP; 2) overexpression of the COOH-terminal domain of either SREBP or SCAP disrupts the complex between full-length SCAP and SREBP and abolishes cleavage at site 1; and 3) the block can be overcome in both cases by overexpression of full-length SCAP, which restores the full-length SCAPÂ·SREBP complex (3Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5785-5793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Cleavage by S1P separates the two transmembrane helices of the SREBPs, but both halves remain bound to the membrane because each retains a single transmembrane helix. The NH2-terminal fragment is released from the membrane by site 2 protease (S2P), which cuts near the junction between the hydrophilic NH2-terminal fragment and the first transmembrane helix (12Duncan E.A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Sakai J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12778-12785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 13Rawson R.B. Zelenski N.G. Nijhawan D. Ye J. Sakai J. Hasan M.T. Chang T.-Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The cleavage site is three residues within the transmembrane helix. After cleavage by S2P, the NH2-terminal fragment leaves the membrane with three hydrophobic residues at its COOH terminus. This fragment then enters the nucleus, where it binds to sterol regulatory elements and activates transcription of more than 15 genes, whose products play roles in the biosynthesis and uptake of cholesterol and unsaturated fatty acids (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3004) Google Scholar,14Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1999; 10: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In unraveling the SREBP proteolytic pathway, our laboratory has relied on mutant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with defects in the genes encoding S2P and S1P (13Rawson R.B. Zelenski N.G. Nijhawan D. Ye J. Sakai J. Hasan M.T. Chang T.-Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 15Rawson R.B. Cheng D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28261-28269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The S2P-deficient cell line was derived by mutagenesis followed by selection for cholesterol auxotrophy (16Hasan M.T. Chang C.C.Y. Chang T.Y. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1994; 20: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The selection scheme is based on the method of Chang and Chang (17Chang T.-Y. Chang C.C.Y. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5316-5323Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), who showed that cholesterol auxotrophs are resistant to the polyene antibiotic amphotericin, which kills cells by forming complexes with cholesterol in the plasma membrane. Prior to amphotericin treatment, the mutagenized CHO cells are incubated briefly in the absence of exogenous cholesterol and in the presence of a low concentration of LDL. During this period, wild-type cells activate cholesterol synthesis, and they take up LDL via LDL receptors. As a result, they maintain high levels of plasma membrane cholesterol. The auxotrophs are unable to produce cholesterol or to take it up from LDL, and their plasma membranes become relatively depleted of this sterol. Brief treatment with amphotericin kills the wild-type cells but not the auxotrophs. The mutant cells are then rescued by growth in the presence of cholesterol, the unsaturated fatty acid oleate, and a low concentration of mevalonate to supply nonsterol products (13Rawson R.B. Zelenski N.G. Nijhawan D. Ye J. Sakai J. Hasan M.T. Chang T.-Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 15Rawson R.B. Cheng D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28261-28269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). When this selection procedure was first employed, all of the mutants recovered from the selection had defects in the gene encoding S2P, which resides on the X chromosome. We attributed this bias to the fact that wild-type CHO cells have only one functional copy of the S2P gene. This problem was overcome when we cloned the gene for S2P by complementation (13Rawson R.B. Zelenski N.G. Nijhawan D. Ye J. Sakai J. Hasan M.T. Chang T.-Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) and used transfection techniques to produce a line of CHO cells, designated CHO/pS2P, with multiple expressed copies of the S2P cDNA (15Rawson R.B. Cheng D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28261-28269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To isolate cholesterol auxotrophs with recessive defects at loci other than S2P, we employed a double mutagenesis protocol. The CHO/pS2P cells were first mutagenized with Î³-irradiation, and potential heterozygotes were identified by incubation with fluorescently labeled LDL. The cells with low levels of LDL receptor expression were isolated with a fluorescence-activated cell sorter and subjected to a second round of Î³-irradiation. Potential homozygotes were then selected for cholesterol auxotrophy using the amphotericin resistance protocol described above. This procedure yielded 12 cell lines that were auxotrophic for cholesterol. One of these, designated SRD-12B, had a defect in S1P, and these cells were used for the cloning of the S1P cDNA by complementation (11Sakai J. Rawson R.B. Espenshade P.J. Cheng D. Seegmiller A.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 505-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The 11 remaining cholesterol-auxotrophic cell lines were not further characterized. In the current studies, we characterize one of the 11 remaining amphotericin-resistant CHO cell lines. This cell line, designated SRD-13A, was found to have two defective copies of the gene encoding SCAP. As a result of the SCAP deficiency, the SRD-13A cells are unable to cleave SREBPs at site 1, and they are therefore cholesterol auxotrophs. The experiments with the SRD-13A cells provide formal genetic proof that the site 1 cleavage reaction requires SCAP. Lipoprotein-deficient serum (d > 1.215 g/ml), human LDL (d = 1.019â1.063 g/ml), sodium mevalonate, sodium oleate, and sodium compactin were prepared as described (18Brown M.S. Faust J.R.

https://openalex.org/W2028767896,"We have characterized cloned His-tag human RNase H1. The activity of the enzyme exhibited a bell-shaped response to divalent cations and pH. The optimum conditions for catalysis consisted of 1 mm Mg2+ and pH 7â8. In the presence of Mg2+, Mn2+ was inhibitory. Human RNase H1 shares many enzymatic properties with Escherichia coliRNase H1. The human enzyme cleaves RNA in a DNA-RNA duplex resulting in products with 5â²-phosphate and 3â²-hydroxy termini, can cleave overhanging single strand RNA adjacent to a DNA-RNA duplex, and is unable to cleave substrates in which either the RNA or DNA strand has 2â² modifications at the cleavage site. Human RNase H1 binds selectively to âA-formâ-type duplexes with approximately 10â20-fold greater affinity than that observed for E. coli RNase H1. The human enzyme displays a greater initial rate of cleavage of a heteroduplex-containing RNA-phosphorothioate DNA than an RNA-DNA duplex. Unlike the E. coli enzyme, human RNase H1 displays a strong positional preference for cleavage, i.e. it cleaves between 8 and 12 nucleotides from the 5â²-RNA-3â²-DNA terminus of the duplex. Within the preferred cleavage site, the enzyme displays modest sequence preference with GU being a preferred dinucleotide. The enzyme is inhibited by single-strand phosphorothioate oligonucleotides and displays no evidence of processivity.

RNase H1 hydrolyzes RNA in RNA-DNA duplexes (1Stein H. Hausen P. Science. 1969; 166: 393-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Proteins with RNase H activity have been isolated from numerous organisms ranging from viruses to mammalian cells and tissues (2Eder P.S. Walder J.A. J. Biol.

Ser. 1982; 14: 211-254Google Scholar). Although RNase H isotypes vary substantially in molecular weight and associated functions, the nuclease properties of the enzymes are similar. All RNase H enzymes, for example, function as endonucleases, specifically cleave RNA in RNA-DNA duplexes, require divalent cations, and generate products with 5â²-phosphate and 3â²-hydroxyl termini (7Crouch R.J. Dirksen M.L. Cold Spring Harbor Monogr. Ser. 1982; 14: 211-254Google Scholar). In prokaryotes, three classes of RNase H enzymes, RNase H1, H2, and H3, have been identified. RNase H2 and H3 share significant sequence homology, whereas RNase H3 and RNase H1 share similar divalent cation preference and cleavage properties. Of the three classes, RNase H2 appears to be the most ubiquitous (8Ohtani N. Haruki M. Morikawa M. Crouch R.J. Itaya M. Kanaya S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 605-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To date no organism has been shown to express active forms of all three classes of RNase H.

Furthermore, the enzyme-substrate interaction has been elucidated based on both the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme as well as chemical and structural modification of the heteroduplex substrate (10Katayanagi K.

RNase H has also been shown to be involved in viral replication. RNase H domains have been identified in viral reverse transcriptases, and these typically share homology with E. coli RNase H1 (15Yang W. Steitz T.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 131-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The RNase H portion of the enzyme has been shown to cleave the viral RNA strand producing RNA primers for second strand DNA synthesis, thereby converting the viral RNA into double strand DNA (22Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Hostomsky Z. Crouch R.J. Ribonucleases H. INSERM, Paris1998: 195-224Google Scholar). Two classes of RNase H enzymes have been identified in mammalian cells (2Eder P.S. Walder J.A. J. Biol.

Albert S. Cazenave C. Toulme J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5247-5254Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). They were reported to differ with respect to co-factor requirements and activity. For example, RNase H type 1 has been shown to be activated by both Mg2+ and Mn2+ and was active in the presence of sulfhydryl reagents, whereas RNase H type 2 was shown to be activated by only Mg2+ and inhibited by Mn2+ and sulfhydryl reagents (6Frank P. Albert S. Cazenave C. Toulme J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5247-5254Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although the biological roles of the mammalian enzymes are not fully understood, it has been suggested that mammalian RNase H type 1 may be involved in replication and that the type 2 enzyme may be involved in transcription (25Busen W. Peters J.H. Hausen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 74: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar,26Turchi J.J. Huang L. Murante R.S. Kim Y. Bambara R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In a previous study we have reported the cloning and expression of a His-tag-labeled RNase H from human cells (16Wu H. Lima W.F. Crooke S.T. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1998; 8: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The human enzyme was homologous to E. coli RNase H1. However, its biochemical properties were similar to those reported for the partially purified RNase H type 2. Because it was the first human enzyme to be cloned, it is referred to as human RNase H1. Additionally, a second human RNase H has been cloned (27Frank P. Braunshofer-Reiter C. Wintersberger U. Grimm R. Busen W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this communication we provide the first detailed characterization of the enzymological properties of human RNase H1 and compare its properties to those of the homologous protein E. coli RNase H1. These studies provide a basis to begin to develop a better understanding of the biological and pharmacological roles of the human RNase H family and to design antisense drugs that interact more effectively with the enzyme. T4 polynucleotide kinase was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). [Î³-32P]ATP and [32P]cytidine bisphosphate were purchased from ICN (Irvine, CA). RNase inhibitor was from 5 Prime â 3 Prime, Inc.

Human RNase H1 with a His-tag was expressed and purified from a bacterial expression system as described previously (16Wu H. Lima W.F. Crooke S.T.

Purified oligonucleotides were greater than 90% full-length material as determined by capillary gel electrophoretic analysis. RNA transcripts and oligoribonucleotides were 5â²-end-labeled with 32P using [Î³-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (31Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Third Edition. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 3.10.3Google Scholar). Oligoribonucleotides were 3â²-end-labeled using [32P]cytidine bisphosphate and T4 RNA ligase. Labeled transcripts and oligonucleotides were purified by electrophoresis on 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The specific activity of the 5â²- and 3â²-labeled RNAs were, respectively, approximately 6000 and 2000 cpm/fmol. Hybridization reactions were performed in a variety of reaction buffers (20 mm Tris or NaH2PO4 buffer (pH 5.0â10.0), 0â10 mm MgCl2, 0â5 mmMnCl2, 20â120 mm KCl, 0â100 mmNaCl, 0â5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 5% glycerol) containing 100 nm antisense oligonucleotide, 50 nm sense oligoribonucleotide, and 50,000 cpm (per 10-Î¼l reaction volume) 32P-labeled sense oligoribonucleotide. Reactions were heated at 90 Â°C for 2 min, then cooled, and RNase inhibitor, bovine serum albumin, and 2-mercaptoethanal (final concentration: 1 unit/100 Î¼l, 10 ng/100 Î¼l, and 5 mm, respectively) were added. Samples were equilibrated at 37 Â°C for at least 4 h and then incubated with human RNase H1. Samples were analyzed using the trichloroacetic acid assay as described previously and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (18Crooke S.T. Lemonidis K.M. Neilson L. Griffey R. Lesnik E.A. Monia B.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 599-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 21Lima W.F. Crooke S.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 390-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Various substrates at different concentrations (10â500 nm RNA, 20â000 nm antisense oligonucleotide) were prepared as described above in the reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 1 unit/100-Î¼l RNase inhibitor, 10 ng/100-Î¼l bovine serum albumin and 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol). Substrates were incubated with human RNase H1 orE. coli RNase H1 and then quenched at specific times. Samples were analyzed by the trichloroacetic acid assay. The amount of substrate hydrolyzed was measured, and the initial rate and Michaelis-Menten parameters (Km,Vmax) were calculated (32Copeland R.A. Enzymes: A Practical Introduction to Structure, Mechanism, and Data Analysis. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1996Google Scholar). Substrate concentrations for trichloroacetic acid assays were the concentrations (nM) of intact duplex in an incubation. The trichloroacetic acid assay compares the amount of 5â² 32P-labeled oligonucleotide that precipitates, thus directly measuring the fraction of duplex that remains intact, and by subtraction, the fraction cleaved to be trichloroacetic acid-soluble. Control studies showed that trichloroacetic acid precipitation was quantitative for single strand oligonucleotides â¥12 nucleotides in length. As the substrates were 5â²-labeled, most cleavage products were trichloroacetic acid-soluble. For longer products, the trichloroacetic acid assay may underestimate cleavage; however, polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis confirmed the cleavage rates observed in the trichloroacetic acid assays (data not shown). Consequently, the errors introduced into the trichloroacetic acid assay results by variations in precipitation of oligonucleotides of different lengths must be small. RNase H generated cleavage products were analyzed by a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. A base hydrolysis ladder was prepared by incubation of 5â²-end-labeled RNA at 90 Â°C for 5 min in 100 mm NaCO3 (pH 9.0). The positions of the cleavage sites were determined with oligonucleotide size markers generated by RNases A and T1 (33Lima W.F. Monia B.P. Ecker D.J. Freier S.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12055-12061Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The gels were then analyzed and quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (21Lima W.F. Crooke S.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 390-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Binding affinities were determined by competitive inhibition analyses. At various concentrations (n > 5) ranging from 10 to 100 nm, the substrates, i.e.oligodeoxynucleotide-oligoribonucleotide hybrids, were prepared as described above. The competing substrate analog was prepared in reaction buffer containing equimolar concentrations of the modified sense and antisense oligonucleotides. Following equilibration at 37 Â°C, the competing substrate analog was added to the wild type substrate reaction, and the mixture was incubated with human RNase H1 in the presence of excess competing substrate, as described above. The samples were analyzed by trichloroacetic acid assay and denaturing polyacrylamide gel analyses. These data were analyzed by both the Lineweaver-Burk and Augustinsson methods to determine if the inhibitors were competitive and to ascertain the inhibitory constants (Ki) for the competing substrates, also as described previously (21Lima W.F. Crooke S.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 390-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 32Copeland R.A. Enzymes: A Practical Introduction to Structure, Mechanism, and Data Analysis. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1996Google Scholar, 34Piszkiewicz D. Kinetics of Chemical and Enzyme-catalyzed Reactions. Oxford University Press, New York1977: 80-145Google Scholar). The effects of various reaction conditions on the activity of human RNase H1 were evaluated (Fig. 1). The optimal pH for the enzyme in both Tris-HCl and phosphate buffers was 7.0â8.0. At pH values above pH 8.0, enzyme activity was reduced. However, this could be due to instability of the substrate or effects on the enzyme, or both. To evaluate the potential contribution of changes in ionic strength to the activities observed at different pH values, two buffers, NaH2PO4 and Tris-HCl, were studied at pH 7.0 and gave the same enzyme activity even though the ionic strengths differed. Enzyme activity was inhibited by increasing ionic strength (Fig. 1 B) and N-ethylmaleimide (Fig.1 C). Enzyme activity increased as the temperature was raised from 25 to 42 Â°C (Fig. 1 D). Mg2+ stimulated enzyme activity with an optimal concentration of 1 mm. At higher concentrations, Mg2+ was inhibitory (Fig.1 E). In the presence of 1 mm Mg2+, Mn2+ was inhibitory at all concentrations tested (Fig.1 F). The purified enzyme was quite stable and easily handled. In fact, the enzyme could be boiled and rapidly or slowly cooled without significant loss of activity (Fig. 1 D). The initial rates of cleavage were determined for four duplex substrates studied simultaneously. The initial rate of cleavage for a phosphodiester DNA-RNA duplex was 1050 Â± 203 pmol literâ1minâ1 (TableI A). The initial rate of cleavage of a phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide duplex was approximately 4-fold faster than that of the same duplex comprised of a phosphodiester antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (Table I A). The initial rates for 17-mer and 20-mer substrates of different sequences were equal (Table I B). However, when a 25-mer heteroduplex containing the 17-mer sequence in the center of the duplex was digested (RNA No. 3), the rate was 50% faster. Interestingly, theKm of the enzyme for the 25-mer duplex was 40% lower than that for the 17-mer, whereas the Vmaxvalues for both duplexes were the same (see Table III), suggesting that with the increase in length, a larger number of cleavage sites are available, resulting in an increase in the number of productive binding interactions between the enzyme and substrate. As a result, a lower substrate concentration is required for the longer duplex to achieve a cleavage rate equal to that of the shorter duplex.Table IEffects of phosphorothioate substitution and substrate length on digestion by human RNase H1RNA No.RNAAntisense DNAInitial ratepmol literâ1 minâ1A 1GGGCGCCGUCGGUGUGG17-mer P=O1050 Â± 203 1GGGCGCCGUCGGUGUGG17-mer P=S4034 Â± 266B 1GGGCGCCGUCGGUGUGG17-mer P=O1050 Â± 203 2ACUCCACCAUAGUACACUCC20-mer P=O1015 Â± 264 3UGGUGGGCGCCGUCGGUGUGGGCAA25-mer P=O1502 Â± 182Oligoribonucleotides were preannealed with the complementary antisense oligodeoxynucleotide at 10 and 20 nm and subjected to digestion by human RNase H1.

For example, the initial rate of cleavage of a duplex containing a phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide and its complement was 3400 pmol literâ1minâ1, whereas that of its 2â²-propoxy-modified analog was undetectable (Table II). A duplex comprised of a fully modified 2â²-methoxy antisense strand also failed to support any cleavage (Table II). The placement of 2â²-methoxy modifications around a central region of oligodeoxynucleotides reduced the initial rate (Table II). The smaller the central oligodeoxynucleotide âgap,â the lower the initial rate. The smallest âgap-merâ for which cleavage could be measured was a 5 deoxynucleotide gap. These data are highly consistent with observations we have previously reported for E. coli RNase H1, except that for the bacterial enzyme, the minimum gap size was 4 deoxynucleotides (18Crooke S.T.

The Km and Vmax of human RNase H1 for three substrates are shown in TableIII. The Km valves for all three substrates were substantially lower than those of E. coli RNase H1 (Table III) (18Crooke S.T.

As previously reported forE. coli RNase H1, the Km for a phosphorothioate-containing duplex was lower than that of a phosphodiester duplex. The Vmax of the human enzyme was 30-fold lower than that of the E. coli enzyme. The Vmax for the phosphorothioate-containing substrate was less than the phosphodiester duplex. This is probably due to inhibition of the enzyme at higher concentrations by excess phosphorothioate single strand oligonucleotide (see below), as the initial rate of cleavage for a phosphorothioate-containing duplex was, in fact, greater than the phosphodiester (Table I) To evaluate the binding affinity of human RNase H1, a competitive cleavage assay in which increasing concentrations of noncleavable substrates were added was used (21Lima W.F. Crooke S.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 390-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Using this approach, the Ki is formally equivalent to the Kd for the competing substrates. Of the noncleavable substrates studied, Lineweaver-Burk analyses demonstrated that all inhibitors shown in TableIV were competitive (data not shown). A duplex containing a phosphodiester oligodeoxynucleotide hybridized to a phosphodiester 2â²-methoxy oligonucleotide as the noncleavable substrate is considered most like DNA-RNA.

https://openalex.org/W1986648879,"We describe here the identification and functional characterization of a novel human histone acetyltransferase, termed MORF (monocytic leukemia zinc finger protein-related factor). MORF is a 1781-residue protein displaying significant sequence similarity to MOZ (monocytic leukemia zinc finger protein). MORF is ubiquitously expressed in adult human tissues, and its gene is located at human chromosome band 10q22. MORF has intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity. In addition to its histone acetyltransferase domain, MORF possesses a strong transcriptional repression domain at its N terminus and a highly potent activation domain at its C terminus. Therefore, MORF is a novel histone acetyltransferase that contains multiple functional domains and may be involved in both positive and negative regulation of transcription.

In eukaryotes, DNA is packaged into chromatin, a highly organized DNA-protein complex that fulfills important functions not only as a structural element in preserving genetic information but also as an active player in controlling gene activity (1van Holde K.E.

How chromatin structure is regulated by DNA-binding transcription factors remains a central issue in studies of eukaryotic gene regulation.

For human MOZ, no biochemical or functional studies have been documented. In this paper, we report the identification of a new human HAT, termed MORF (for MOZ-related factor) and further show that MORF possesses functional domains characteristic of a transcriptional regulator. Our results suggest the direct involvement of MORF and its related protein MOZ in transcriptional regulation and thus provide new insights into how abnormal forms of MOZ lead to tumorigenesis. cDNA library screening, plasmid construction, and DNA sequencing were performed following standard procedures. Northern analyses on poly(A) RNA blots (CLONTECH) were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reporter tk-Luc was derived from pGL2 (Promega) by insertion of the thymidine kinase (tk) core promoter (â105/+52). Gal4-tk-Luc was constructed from tk-Luc by insertion of five copies of the Gal4-binding site upstream from the tk promoter. Gal4-E4-Luc was derived from Gal4-tk-Luc by replacement of the tk region with the adenoviral E4 core promoter from 3TP-Lux (38Hata A. Lo R.S. Wotton D. Lagna G. MassagueÌ J.

Full-length MORF was expressed in Sf9 cells as a fusion protein with the FLAG epitope tag (IBI-Kodak) using a recombinant baculovirus generated with the Bac-To-Bac baculovirus system (Life Technologies, Inc.). The expressed fusion protein, f-MORF, was affinity-purified on M2-agarose and eluted with FLAG peptide (0.1 mg/ml; IBI-Kodak). The FLAG-tagged PCAF protein, f-PCAF, was similarly produced in and purified from Sf9 cells using the PCAF recombinant baculovirus previously described (18Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar). Maltose-binding protein (MBP)-MORF mutants were expressed inEscherichia coli, purified on amylose resin (New England Biolabs), eluted with maltose (10 mm), and used directly for further analyses. For all affinity purification, buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors) containing 0.5 m KCl was used as lysis and washing buffers. In all elution buffers, the concentration of KCl was reduced to 0.15m. Affinity-purified f-MORF and f-PCAF proteins were electrotransferred to BioTrace nitrocellulose membranes (Gelman Sciences) and probed with M2 anti-FLAG antibody (IBI-Kodak). Blots were developed with Supersignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). HAT activity was determined by analyzing incorporation of 3H- or 14C-labeled acetyl groups into histones. To measure HAT activity, Whatman P81 filter binding assays were used (40Horiuchi K. Fujimoto D. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 69: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 41Brownell J.E. Allis C.D.

The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 Â°C for 10 min and then processed as described (40Horiuchi K. Fujimoto D. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 69: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 41Brownell J.E. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6364-6368Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). For acetyllysine peptides (19Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2378) Google Scholar), 30 Î¼g were used per reaction. To distinguish which histones were acetylated, each reaction (20 Î¼l) contained 2.5 nCi of [14C]acetyl-CoA (51 mCi/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 0.5 Î¼g of HeLa octamers, nucleosomes, or oligonucleosomes. The reaction was carried out at 30 Â°C for 30 min and stopped by the addition of 10 Î¼l of 3Ã SDS sample buffer, followed by separation on 15% SDS-PAGE gels and subsequent fluorography or phosphoimaging analysis using a FUJIX BAS 100 phosphoimager (18Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar). Although the latter assay distinguishes which histones are acetylated, the P81 filter binding assay is more reliable and convenient for quantitative determination of HAT activity. SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) was used to transiently transfect a luciferase reporter (200 ng) and/or mammalian expression plasmids (200 ng) into NIH3T3 or 293T cells. pBluescript KSII(+) was used to normalize the total amount of plasmids used in each transfection, and a Î²-galactosidase reporter driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter (50 ng) was cotransfected for normalization of transfection efficiency. After 48 h, luciferase activity of transfected cells was determined usingd-(â)-Luciferin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as the substrate. Galactosidase activity was measured using Galacto-Light Plusâ¢ (Tropix, Perkin-Elmer Co.) as the substrate. The chemiluminescence from activated Luciferin or Galacto-Light PlusTM was measured on a Luminometer Plate Reader (Dynex). Each transfection was performed at least three times to ensure that consistent results were obtained. To verify the expression of Gal4 fusion proteins, expression plasmids were transfected to 293T cells; total or nuclear extracts were prepared for Western blotting analysis using a monoclonal anti-Gal4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotech., RK5C1). Total extracts were prepared as described above using buffer B containing 0.15 m KCl. For nuclear extracts, transfected cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in situ using 5 ml (for a 10 cm dish) of ice-cold hypotonic lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20% glycerol, 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 25 mm NaF, 25 mm Î²-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors). After 5 min on ice, cell lysates were harvested by scraping and centrifuged for 5 min at 500 rpm on a Beckman swinging bucket tabletop centrifuge to pellet the nuclei. 0.1 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl was used to extract the nuclei. After being rotated for 20 min at 4 Â°C and brief centrifugation, the supernatants were collected and used as nuclear extracts for Western blotting analysis. With known and putative HATs as baits, we performed BLAST and PSI-BLAST searches (42Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59448) Google Scholar) against various sequence data bases. During these searches, we found a partial human cDNA clone (GenBankTM accession number AB002381). This partial clone encodes a polypeptide displaying significant sequence similarity to MOZ. To obtain the complete coding sequence, we screened human cDNA libraries. Polymerase chain reaction and sequence analyses of a majority of positive cDNA clones indicated that the full-length MORF clone encodes a polypeptide consisting of 1781 residues (Fig.1 A). The remaining positive clones were found to encode the polypeptides MORFÎ± and MORFÎ², with 109 and 292 residues inserted between Pro372 and Asp373 of MORF, respectively (Fig. 1 B). Data base searches and amino acid sequence comparison indicated that MORF is homologous to MOZ (identity, 60%; similarity, 66%). As shown in Fig.1 A, MORF is composed of four parts: an N-terminal region containing two C4HC3 PHD-zinc fingers, a putative HAT domain, an acidic region, and a C-terminal Ser/Met-rich domain. PHD-zinc fingers are putative protein-protein interaction motifs found in numerous proteins implicated in gene regulation, including the transcriptional regulator ATRX (43Aasland R. Gibson T.J.

The putative HAT domain of MORF is homologous to that shared by MOZ (26Borrow J. Stanton Jr., V.P. Andresen J.M. Becher R. Behm F.G. Chaganti R.S. Civin C.I. Disteche C. Dube I. Frischauf A.M.

A. 1998; 95: 3561-3565Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The acidic and Ser/Met-rich domains of MORF do not display obvious sequence similarity to known proteins other than MOZ. These structural features of MORF suggest that it may be a HAT with novel properties. As shown in Fig. 2 A, Northern blot analyses of poly(A) RNA from various human tissues indicated that MORF is ubiquitously expressed, most abundantly in heart, pancreas, testis, and ovary. The expression of MORF is low in lung but detectable. FISH analyses revealed that the MORF gene is located at human chromosome band 10q22.2 (Fig. 2, B and C). A juvenile polyposis tumor suppressor locus has been mapped to 10q22 (53Jacoby R.F. Schlack S. Cole C.E. Skarbek M. Harris C. Meisner L.F. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 1398-1403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this band is abnormal in a patient with biphenotypic acute leukemia (54Ariyasu T. Matsuo Y. Harashima A. Nakamura S. Takaba S. Tsubota T. Orita K. Hum. Cell. 1998; 11: 43-50PubMed Google Scholar), and amplification of a candidate gene located at 10q22.1-q23.1 has been correlated with the metastasis of bladder cancers (55Hovey R.M. Chu L. Balazs M. DeVries S. Moore D. Sauter G. Carroll P.R. Waldman F.M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3555-3560PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the MORF gene is located at a chromosomal region that is rearranged in several neoplasms. Next we asked whether MORF is really a HAT. To test this, we tried to express full-length MORF as a FLAG-tagged fusion protein in Sf9 insect cells. Due to unknown reasons, the recombinant baculovirus was not stable, and the expression level of f-MORF was very low. Because of the limited amount of MORF available, Western analysis with an anti-FLAG antibody was used to determine the concentration of FLAG-tagged MORF (f-MORF) in affinity-purified preparations (Fig.3 A, lane 2). For such Western analyses, FLAG-tagged PCAF (Fig. 3 A,f-PCAF, lane 1), which could be highly expressed with a similar system and affinity-purified to near homogeneity (18Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar), was utilized for comparison. To determine HAT activity of full-length MORF, both f-MORF and f-PCAF were affinity-purified and subjected to HAT assays. As shown in Fig. 3 B, affinity-purified f-MORF was much more active than f-PCAF. To determine the substrate specificity, HeLa histones and oligonucleosomes were labeled with f-MORF in the presence of [14C]acetyl-CoA, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to fluorography or phosphoimaging analysis. As shown in Fig.3 C, f-MORF preferentially acetylated histones H3 and H4, whereas f-PCAF preferentially acetylated H3. Like f-PCAF, f-MORF was autoacetylated. When oligonucleosomes were used as substrates, f-MORF preferentially acetylated H4, whereas f-PCAF preferentially acetylated H3. Taken together, these results indicate that MORF is a potent HAT. To map the HAT domain, we expressed several MORF fragments in E. coli as a protein fused to the following affinity tags: His6, glutathione S-transferase, and MBP. Among these, only the MBP fusion proteins could be expressed in soluble forms (Fig.4 A). These fusion proteins were affinity-purified on amylose resin (Fig. 4 B). HAT assays were performed with these purified MBP fusion proteins. As shown in Fig. 4 C, MBP-A efficiently acetylated histones. Deletion of residues 361â425 increased HAT activity by 4-fold (Fig.4 C, compare MBP-A and MBP-B), suggesting that residues 361â425 negatively regulate the activity of the HAT domain. On a molar basis, MBP-B was found to be about 40-fold less active than f-MORF. Further deletion of residues 426â460 abolished the activity (Fig. 4 C, MBP-C). Deletion of residues 554â587, which contains the putative acetyl-CoA-binding motif, inactivated the enzyme (Fig. 4 C, MBP-D). Altogether, these results indicate that residues 426â716 of MORF constitute its HAT domain. These results also support that MORF has intrinsic HAT activity. As shown in Fig. 1, MORFÎ± contains an insertion of 109 residues between Pro372 and Asp373 of MORF. Because residues 361â425 of MORF serve as a negative regulator for the HAT activity, we tested whether the MORFÎ± fragment corresponding to residues 426â716 of MORF has distinct HAT activity. For this, residues 361â825 of MORFÎ± was expressed and purified as an MBP fusion protein. This fusion protein (Fig. 4 C, MBP-E) was as active as MBP-A, suggesting that the insertion of 109 residues between Pro372 and Asp373 of MORF does not relieve the inhibitory effect of residues 361â425 on the HAT domain. To determine which histones are acetylated, substrates labeled with MBP-A or MBP-E were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to fluorography or phosphoimaging analysis. As shown in Fig.4 D, MBP-A and MBP-E preferentially acetylated free histones H3 and H4. Unlike MBP-A, MBP-E was autoacetylated. When oligonucleosomes were used, no detectable acetylation was observed with either MBP-A or MBP-E (data not shown). Next we sought to assess which lysine of histone H4 is acetylated. For this, histone H4 acetyllysine peptides (Fig.5 A and Ref. 19Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2378) Google Scholar) were used as substrates. As shown in Fig. 5 (BâD), MBP-A, -B, and -E acetylated Lys5, Lys8, Lys12, and Lys16 of histone H4. Consistent with the fact that MORF shares a conserved HAT domain with TIP60 and ESA1 (Fig. 1 A and Refs. 32Smith E.R. Eisen A. Gu W. Sattah M. Pannuti A. Zhou J. Cook R.G. Lucchesi J.C. Allis C.D.

Chem. 1997; 272: 30595-30598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), these results indicate that the substrate specificity of MORF is similar to that reported for TIP60 and ESA1. With free core histones as a substrate, it has been reported that TIP60 and ESA1 acetylate H2A, H3, and H4 (32Smith E.R. Eisen A. Gu W. Sattah M. Pannuti A. Zhou J. Cook R.G. Lucchesi J.C. Allis C.D.

Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 789-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, unlike MORF, ESA1 and TIP60 were found to be unable to acetylate nucleosomal histones H2A, H3, and H4 (32Smith E.R.

We report here that during apoptosis induced by the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide, a fraction of GRP94 associated with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane undergoes specific proteolytic cleavage, coinciding with the activation of the caspase CPP32 and initiation of DNA fragmentation. In vivo, inhibitors of caspases able to block etoposide-induced apoptosis can only partially protect GRP94 from proteolytic cleavage, whereas complete inhibition is observed with calpain inhibitor I but not with the proteasome inhibitor. In vitro, GRP94 is not a substrate for CPP32; rather, it can be completely cleaved by calpain, a Ca2+-regulated protease. The cleavage of GRP94 by calpain is Ca2+-dependent and generates a discrete polypeptide of 80 kDa. In contrast, calpain has no effect on other stress proteins such as GRP78 or HSP70. Further, immunohistochemical staining reveals specific co-localization of GRP94 with calpain in the perinuclear region following etoposide treatment. We further showed that reduction of GRP94 by antisense decreased cell viability in etoposide-treated Jurkat cells. Our studies provide new evidence that the cytoprotective GRP94, as in the case of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, can be targets of proteolytic cleavage themselves during the apoptotic process.

Programmed cell death, or âapoptosisâ is a fundamental process in multicellular organisms for normal development as well as the maintenance of homeostasis (1Vaux D.L. Strasser A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2239-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). Cellular stress causes severe constraints on numerous physiological functions, damages cellular macromolecules and structures, and frequently leads to cell death. To understand the in vivo regulation of apoptosis, it is important to identify proteins that can protect cells from undergoing cell death. As part of their program to escape host destruction, many viruses express proteins that protect the infected cells from cell death (2Rao L. Debbas M. Sabbatini P. Hockenbery D. Korsmeyer S. White E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7742-7746Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 3Crook N.E. Clem R.J. Miller L.K. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2168-2174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, little is known about cellular proteins that can confer resistance to apoptosis. To date, the best characterized endogenous cellular proteins known to be able to inhibit apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli are Bcl-2, which is an integral intracellular membrane protein, and related members of the Bcl-2/Ced9 family (4NunÌez G.

While the central role of mitochondria in initiating cell death has been widely studied (25Reed J.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 559-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar), the involvement of the ER in the apoptotic process is not well understood. Apoptosis is triggered by the activation of several intracellular cysteine proteases of the interleukin-converting enzyme family referred to as caspases (26Porter A.G. Ng P. Janicke R.U. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Many of the protein targets identified so far during apoptosis are involved in morphological and biochemical changes that accompany programmed cell death, or in the sensing of DNA damage and repair (27Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6199) Google Scholar, 28Ubeda M. Habener J.F. J. Biol.

Recently, it was discovered that Bcl-2 undergoes specific proteolytic cleavage mediated by the caspases after induction of apoptosis by Fas ligation and interleukin-3 withdrawal (29Cheng E.H.

Strikingly, the cleavage of Bcl-2 not only inactivates its antiapoptotic function but converts the carboxyl-terminal Bcl-2 cleavage product into a proapoptotic molecule, accelerating Sindbis virus-induced apoptosis. Calpains are another family of cysteine proteinases with two major isoforms (Î¼- and m-calpain) that are ubiquitously expressed (30Croall D.E. DeMartino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, 31Carafoli E. Molinari M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). It is believed that these cytoplasmic proteases are activated at the cellular membranes (32Kawasaki H. Kawashima S. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1996; 13: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in platelet aggregation, neuronal long-term potentiation, neutrophil activation, and oocyte maturation, calpain also appears to be a necessary upstream regulator for cell death pathways that require new protein synthesis but not those that are independent of new protein synthesis (33Squier M.K. Cohen J.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3690-3697PubMed Google Scholar). Many putative calpain substrates are cytoskeleton-associated proteins located at or near cellular membranes, while some are nuclear proteins (31Carafoli E. Molinari M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 32Kawasaki H. Kawashima S. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1996; 13: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 33Squier M.K. Cohen J.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3690-3697PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, the stability of p53, a major regulator of apoptosis, is regulated by calpain (34Kubbutat M.H. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 460-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Further, Bax with proapoptotic properties is also cleaved by calpain in cells induced to undergo apoptosis (35Wood D.E. Thomas A. Devi L.A. Berman Y. Beavis R.C. Reed J.C. Newcomb E.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1069-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Thus, in various apoptotic models, both caspases and calpain appear to play important roles and act on specific subsets of protein substrates. In studying the expression of GRPs in a panel of human hematopoietic cell lines SN and S stably transfected with wild type or mutated forms of p53 (36Banerjee D. Lenz H.J. Schnieders B. Manno D.J. Ju J.F. Spears C.P. Hochhauser D. Danenberg K. Danenberg P. Bertino J.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1405-1413PubMed Google Scholar), we observed a correlation between the cell's ability to induce GRP94 and resistance to apoptosis induced by 2-deoxyglucose, a classical inducer of GRPs, reaffirming previous observations that GRP94 possesses antiapoptotic properties (20Little E. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9526-9534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 23McCormick T.S. McColl K.S. Distelhorst C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6087-6092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This prompted us to examine the status of stress proteins, in particular GRP94 and GRP78, under apoptotic conditions other than stress conditions targeted to the ER (8Lee A.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 20-23Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (391) Google Scholar). In this report, we focus on etoposide-induced apoptosis in three cell models: the SN cells, the human acute T cell leukemia line, Jurkat, and the hamster fibroblast K12 cell line, where the induction of GRPs has been extensively studied (37Lee A.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1981; 106: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Fortuitously, we discovered that GRP94, but not GRP78, is proteolytically cleaved during etoposide-induced apoptosis. However, in vivo, only a fraction of GRP94 appears to be accessible to calpain cleavage. Its cleavage in vivo is completely blocked by calpain inhibitor I and is partially inhibited by z-VAD-fmk, a general caspase inhibitor. In in vitro assays, calpain but not CPP32 is capable of cleavage of GRP94, with the generation of a 80-kDa carboxyl polypeptide. The cleavage of GRP94 in vitro by calpain is Ca2+-dependent and can be reproduced in purified microsome preparations. In contrast, neither GRP78 nor HSP70 are substrates for calpain. We further demonstrate by laser confocal microscopy that during etoposide-induced apoptosis, calpain becomes co-localized with GRP94 in the perinuclear region. The cytoprotective function of GRP94 in etoposide-treated cells is confirmed, since transfection with an antisense vector directed against GRP94 increased cell lethality. Our findings provide new evidence that the antiapoptotic stress protein GRP94 is a direct target of the apoptotic machinery. Our results are consistent with the existence of a subpopulation of GRP94 associated with the ER membrane, where it becomes a specific substrate for calpain cleavage concurrent with the progression of apoptosis induced by DNA damage mediated by etoposide. The SN cell line is a human hematopoietic cell line, HL60, stably transfected with the wild type p53 gene (36Banerjee D. Lenz H.J. Schnieders B. Manno D.J. Ju J.F. Spears C.P. Hochhauser D. Danenberg K. Danenberg P. Bertino J.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1405-1413PubMed Google Scholar). The human acute T cell leukemia line, Jurkat, and the SN cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin/neomycin antibiotics. The K12 hamster fibroblast cell line was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 Î¼g/ml glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotics (37Lee A.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1981; 106: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To induce apoptosis by etoposide (Calbiochem), the cells were exposed to 30 Î¼m etoposide for 1â10 h. To test the effect of caspase inhibitors in vivo, the cells were treated with either 50 Î¼m z-VAD-fmk (Calbiochem) for 2 h or 120 Î¼m z-DEVD-fmk (Calbiochem) for 3 h. For inhibition of calpain or proteasome activity during apoptosis, the cells were pretreated with 45 Î¼m calpain inhibitor I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or 50 Î¼m proteasome inhibitorN-benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-norvalinal (Sigma) for 4 h prior to the subsequent addition of etoposide. Conditions for preparation of cell lysate and immunoblots were as described (38Zhou Y. Lee A.S. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Recombinant GRP78 and antisera against GRP78, GRP94, and HSP70 were purchased fromStressGen (Victoria, Canada). Antisera used were 1:1000 dilution of the anti-GRP94 or anti-GRP78 monoclonal antibody, 1:10,000 dilution of anti-HSP70 polyclonal antibody, 1:5000 dilution of the anti-Î²-actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma), or 1:3000 dilution of the anti-CPP32 monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). The rat anti-GRP94 antibody (SPA-850) was raised against purified chicken GRP94. The mouse anti-GRP78 antibody (SPA-827) was raised against the SEKDEL peptide shared by ER luminal proteins. Under our experimental conditions, it recognizes most strongly GRP78 and a 45-kDa protein referred to as X, with minor but detectable reactivity toward GRP94. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were used as secondary antibodies. Rabbit anti-rat antibody (Cappel-ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) at 1:4000 dilution was used against anti-GRP94 antibody; goat anti-rabbit antibody (StressGen) at 1:5000 dilution was used against anti-HSP70 antibody; and sheep anti-mouse antibodies (Cappel-ICN) at 1:5000 dilution were used against anti-GRP78, anti-CPP32, and anti-Î²-actin antibodies. Immune complexes were detected with the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The bands were visualized by autoradiography and quantitated by densitometry scanning using the Bio-Rad Imaging Densitometer. 5 Ã 106 cells harvested at different time points of drug treatment were incubated at 37 Â°C in 0.5 ml of a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 0.5% (w/v) SDS. DNase-free RNase A was added (20 Î¼g/ml of lysate) and incubated at 37 Â°C with gentle shaking, followed by the addition of proteinase K (100 Î¼g/ml of lysate), and a further 4-h incubation at 56 Â°C. The DNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. Five Î¼g of genomic DNA was loaded onto a 1.9% agarose gel. DNA was visualized with ethidium bromide (0.5 Î¼g/ml) under UV light. For [35S]methionine-labeled GRP94, 80% confluent Jurkat cells were labeled with 100 Î¼Ci of [35S]methionine (NEN Life Science Products) in a 10-cm dish containing 5 ml of methionine-free medium with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum. After 2 h of labeling, proteins were isolated, and GRP94 protein was immunoprecipitated as described (39Ramakrishnan M. SchoÌnthal A.H. Lee A.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 170: 115-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To test CPP32 and calpain cleavage of GRP94 in vitro, 0.1 Î¼g of recombinant CPP32 (gift of Drs. T. Rudel and G. Bokoch; Ref. 40Rudel T. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1997; 276: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar) resuspended in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, or 0.2 unit of calpain (Sigma) resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1.5 mmÎ²-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm CaCl2, or buffer alone was added to the immunocomplex and kept at room temperature for 30 min. For the cleavage of recombinant GRP78, the same buffer was used with calpain added at 0.2 unit/Î¼g of protein, and the reaction was performed at 30 Â°C. The incubation was stopped by the addition of equal volumes of 2Ã Laemmli buffer (1Ã Laemmli buffer: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2.5% (v/v) Î²-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol) and resolved on 8.5% SDS-PAGE. In other reactions, total cell lysates prepared from K12 cells were resuspended in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mmTris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS). Calpain was added at 0.2â0.6 units/200 Î¼g of protein with varying amounts of CaCl2, and the reaction was performed at 30 Â°C. The levels of GRP94, GRP78, HSP70, and X were probed in immunoblot assays described above. Fibroblast K12 cells grown in chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde made in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min. For the detection of GRP94, the cells were stained with anti-GRP94 rat monoclonal antibody (1:100 dilution) as primary antibody and the fluorescein anti-rat IgG (1:200 dilution) (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA) as secondary antibody. For the detection of calpain, the cells were stained with mouse monoclonal anti-calpain antibody (MA3â940) at 1:100 dilution (Affinity Bioreagents, Inc., Golden, CO) and Texas Red anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:200 dilution) (Vector Laboratories) as primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. The stained cells were examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Conditions for preparation of microsomes were as described (41Kang H.S. Welch W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5643-5649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Essentially, K12 cells were trypsinized and after washing with cold phosphate-buffered saline were lysed by incubation in 10 volumes of cold hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and Dounce homogenization. The lysate was immediately adjusted to 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2 and centrifuged at 1000 Ãg for 10 min at 4 Â°C to remove nuclei and cell debris. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 10,000 Ã gfor 20 min at 4 Â°C. The supernatant was recentrifuged at 100,000 Ã g for 90 min. The pellet, representing microsomes, was rinsed briefly with cold water and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and used for proteolytic digestion studies. For separation of ER membranes from luminal proteins, the microsome pellet was resuspended in 10 volumes of 100 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11.5, and incubated on ice for 30 min. The suspension was then centrifuged for 1 h at 200,000 Ã g at 4 Â°C. The pellet, which represents ER membrane, was rinsed with cold water and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer and analyzed by Western blot. Proteins present in the ER lumen were recovered from the supernatant by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 10%. The pellet was solubilized in the Laemmli buffer and analyzed by Western blot. For calpain digestion reactions, approximately 100 Î¼g of microsomes in 25 Î¼l of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, was incubated with 0.2 unit of calpain in the presence of 5 mmCaCl2 at 30 Â°C for 30 min. For trypsin digestion reactions, the microsomes were incubated with trypsin (25 Î¼g/ml) either in the presence or absence of 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 30 Â°C. The proteolytic cleavage reactions were terminated by the addition of Laemmli buffer and boiling at 100 Â°C. 10â20 Î¼g of total protein from each reaction was analyzed by Western blotting. Transfection was performed according to the protocol for Superfect provided by Qiagen (Valencia, CA). About 7.5 Ã 106 Jurkat cells were seeded into 5 ml of culture medium. An expression vector of CMV-Î²-galactosidase was used as a reporter gene. It was co-transfected with either CMV-grp94-AS, containing the antisense version of the full-length rat grp94 cDNA driven by the CMV promoter, CMV-neo-Bcl-2 (gift of Dr. C.M. Zacharchuk, National Institutes of Health; Ref. 42Memon S.A. Petrak D. Moreno M.B. Zacharchuk C.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 180: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), or the CMV vector alone. After the addition of the transfection complexes into the cells for 24 h at 37 Â°C, one half of the cells were untreated and the other half were treated with 30 Î¼m of etoposide for 10 h. The cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, solubilized in 250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and, following freeze-thawing for three times, assayed for Î²-galactosidase activity. The percentage cell viability was calculated by the ratio between the amount of Î²-galactosidase activity remaining in the etoposide-treated and untreated cells. For the experiments performed with the grp94 antisense vector, each dosage was repeated two to three times. The transfection efficiency was measured by the fraction of control cells stained positive for Î²-galactosidase expression. Protein extracts were prepared from the transfected cells for measurement of GRP94 protein level by Western blots. Using the human hematopoietic cell line SN, which was stably transfected with p53 as a model system to explore the relationship between the GRPs and apoptosis, we tested whether the steady state levels of the GRPs were affected during apoptosis. Exponentially growing SN cells were incubated with etoposide and harvested at 1-h intervals for 4 h. The onset of apoptosis was monitored by the appearance of DNA ladders and the activation of CPP32 caspase through cleavage of its inactive proenzyme form (Fig. 1, A andB). Concomitantly, the level of GRP94 and GRP78 were measured by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1 B). The apoptotic process was evident after 3 h of etoposide treatment, as judged from the DNA fragmentation pattern and the sharp disappearance of the proenzyme form of CPP32. For GRP94 and GRP78, within the first 2 h of drug treatment, their level was relatively constant. Strikingly, we observed that the level of GRP94, but not GRP78, started to decrease at 3 h as DNA fragmentation became evident and CPP32 was activated. Nonetheless, in contrast to CPP32, which was cleaved completely by 4 h, there appeared to be a subpopulation of GRP94 that remained resistant to this proteolytic cleavage process. To determine whether this novel observation can be extended to other cell systems, the levels of GRP94, GRP78, and Î²-actin were monitored in the Jurkat human leukemia cell line, since etoposide has been shown to induce apoptosis in these cells in a relatively short time with high efficiency (43Erhardt P. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17601-17604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Further, the same experiments were performed with K12 hamster fibroblast cells subjected to etoposide treatment. The protein bands were quantitated by densitometry. The kinetics and magnitude of the decrease of GRP94 protein level in the SN, Jurkat, and K12 cells during the time course of etoposide treatment are shown in Fig.2. For all the three cell lines, the levels of GRP78 and Î²-actin remained relatively constant for the whole treatment period. In contrast, in all the three cell lines, a decrease in GRP94 level was detectable after 3 h. With SN and Jurkat cells, by 4 h, the level of GRP94 was reduced to about 40%. With K12 cells, which were more resistant to etoposide-induced cell death (data not shown), the GRP94 level was reduced to about 70% of the untreated cells. However, in all three cell lines, a residual amount of GRP94 remained uncleaved even after 6 h of etoposide treatment. The reduction in GRP94 protein level could be due to selective proteolytic cleavage by proteases activated during apoptosis. Since the activation of caspase CPP32 coincided with the reduction in GRP94 level and most apoptotic substrates identified have been shown to be cleaved by caspase family members (44Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1934) Google Scholar), we first tested whether the in vivo cleavage of GRP94 is mediated by CPP32 or its related members. For this purpose, Jurkat cells were pretreated with caspase inhibitors prior to induction of apoptosis by etoposide. Two caspase inhibitors were used: one set of cells were treated with a general caspase family inhibitor, a cell-permeable synthetic tripeptide, z-VAD-fmk, which can inhibit both caspase-1- and caspase-3-like protease activities (45Pronk G.J. Ramer K. Amiri P. Williams L.T. Science. 1996; 271: 808-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar); the other set of cells were treated with tetrapeptide z-DEVD-fmk, which is specific for the caspase-3 (CPP32) activity (28Ubeda M. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19562-19568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Our results showed that pretreatment of the cells with the general caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk partially prevented GRP94 cleavage during apoptosis (Fig.3 A). For cells pretreated with z-DEVD-fmk, the cleavage of GRP94 was delayed for about 3 h; however, by 6 h the reduction of GRP94 level was observed (Fig.3 B). Since GRP94 is a Ca2+-binding protein and its phosphorylation status is also dependent on Ca2+ (39Ramakrishnan M. SchoÌnthal A.H. Lee A.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 170: 115-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we tested whether the in vivo cleavage of GRP94 is sensitive to calpain, the Ca2+-activated neutral protease associated with the onset of apoptosis (31Carafoli E. Molinari M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 33Squier M.K. Cohen J.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3690-3697PubMed Google Scholar). For this purpose, Jurkat cells were pretreated with calpain inhibitor I (34Kubbutat M.H. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 460-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) prior to the addition of etoposide, and the level of GRP94 was monitored by Western blot (Fig.3 C). Our results showed that treatment of cells with calpain inhibitor completely blocked the cleavage of GRP94 during etoposide-induced apoptosis. Since calpain inhibitor I mi"
https://openalex.org/W2073948883,"Yap1 is a transcription factor that responds to oxidative stress in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The activity of Yap1 is regulated at the level of its intracellular localization, and a cysteine-rich domain at the C terminus of Yap1 is involved in this regulation. We investigated the effects of redox-regulatory proteins, thioredoxin and glutaredoxin, on the regulation of Yap1, using the deficient mutants of these thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases. In the thioredoxin-deficient mutant (trx1Î/trx2Î), Yap1 was constitutively concentrated in the nucleus and the level of expression of the Yap1 target genes was high under normal conditions, while this was not the case for the glutaredoxin-deficient mutant (grx1Î/grx2Î).

Many aerobic organisms show adaptive responses to oxidative stress by increasing the levels of antioxidant enzymes. A portion of the adaptive response is regulated at the transcriptional level, and several transcription factors that regulate the expression of antioxidant genes have been reported. In Escherichia coli, OxyR, SoxR, and SoxS are key transcription factors for the adaptive response to oxidative stress. OxyR regulates the expression of genes encoding H2O2-inducible proteins, and SoxR and SoxS regulate the expression of genes encoding superoxide-inducible proteins (1Jamieson D.J. Storz G. Scandalios J.G. Oxidative Stress and The Molecular Biology of Antioxidant Defenses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 91-116Google Scholar). In mammals, two transcription factors, NF-ÎºB and AP-1, have been strongly implicated in the oxidative stress response (2Nakamura H. Nakamura K. Yodoi J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 351-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). The activities of these transcription factors are reversibly controlled through redox states and modulated by thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases such as thioredoxin (TRX) 1The abbreviations used are:TRXthioredoxinGRXglutaredoxinGRglutathione reductaseGFPgreen fluorescent proteinCRDcysteine-rich domainNESnuclear export sequenceDCFH-DA2â²,7â²-dichlorofluorescin diacetatekbkilobase(s) and glutaredoxin (GRX) (2Nakamura H.

Science. 1998; 279: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). OxyR is activated through the formation of a disulfide bond between Cys199 and Cys208, and deactivated by the enzymatic reduction of the bond with GRX (3Zheng M. â«slund F. Storz G. Science. 1998; 279: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). The activities of NF-ÎºB and AP-1 are also regulated by the redox modification of cysteine residues. After the dissociation of NF-ÎºB/IÎºB complex, TRX augments the DNA binding and transcriptional activities of NF-ÎºB by reducing the Cys62 residue in its DNA-binding loop (4Matthews J.R. Wakasugi N.

Yap1 (yeast AP-1) is a transcription factor crucial for oxidative stress response in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and it regulates the expression of several genes whose gene products play major roles in the oxidative stress tolerance. The null mutant of theYAP1 gene displayed hypersensitivity to oxidative stress, and the overexpression of the YAP1 gene confers stress resistance (14Hertle K. Haase E. Brendel M. Curr. Genet. 1991; 19: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 15Hussain M. Lenard J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1991; 101: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 16Schnell N. Entian K.-D. Eur.

Several target genes for Yap1 have been identified, such as GSH1 encoding Î³-glutamylcysteine synthetase (19Wu A.-L. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5832-5839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), GLR1 encoding glutathione reductase (20Grant C.M. Collinson L.P. Roe J.-H. Dawes I.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar),TRX2 encoding TRX (21Kuge S. Jones N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), and TRR1 encoding thioredoxin reductase (22Morgan B.A. Banks G.R. Toone W.M. Raitt D. Kuge S. Johnston L.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). These gene products are involved in the adaptive response to oxidative stress. Yap1 was originally identified as a functional homologue of mammalian AP-1 on the basis of its ability to bind to an AP-1 recognition element (23Moye-Rowley W.S. Harshman K.D. Parker C.S. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Yap1 binds to the Yap1 recognition element (YRE: 5â²-TTAGT(C/A)A-3â²) in the promoter region of target genes (24Wemmie J.A. Szczypka M.S. Thiele D.J. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32592-32597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N terminus of Yap1 contains a bZip domain, which is conserved among the AP-1 family, including mammalian Jun, Fos, and S. cerevisiaeGcn4 (23Moye-Rowley W.S. Harshman K.D. Parker C.S. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). A cysteine-rich domain (CRD) at the C terminus of Yap1, containing three Cys-Ser-Glu sequence motifs, plays an important role in the control of Yap1, especially for the intracellular localization of Yap1 (25Alarco A.-M. Balan I. Talibi D. Mainville N. Raymond M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19304-19313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 26Kuge S. Jones N. Nomoto A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1710-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). In the response to oxidative stress, the localization of Yap1 changes dramatically, while the increase in the DNA binding activity is modest and the levels of Yap1 do not increase (26Kuge S. Jones N. Nomoto A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1710-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 27Takeuchi T. Miyahara K. Hirata D. Miyakawa T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 28Wemmie J.A. Steggerda S.M. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7908-7914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Yap1 exists both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus under non-stressed conditions, while it is concentrated in the nucleus under oxidative conditions (26Kuge S. Jones N. Nomoto A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1710-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that the localization of Yap1 is controlled by Crm1-mediated nuclear export and that Yap1 has an nuclear export sequence (NES) embedded within the CRD (29Kuge S. Toda T. Iizuka N. Nomoto A. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 30Yan C. Lee L.H. Davis L.I. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7416-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis suggested that cysteine residues within the CRD serve as redox sensors, which regulate the availability of the NES (30Yan C. Lee L.H. Davis L.I. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7416-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Therefore, removal of the CRD causes constitutive accumulation of Yap1 in the nucleus, which results in the increase of transcription of the Yap1 target genes (26Kuge S. Jones N. Nomoto A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1710-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Additionally, the CRD is required for Yap1 to discriminate the stresses elicited by H2O2, diamide, and CdCl2 (27Takeuchi T. Miyahara K. Hirata D. Miyakawa T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 28Wemmie J.A. Steggerda S.M. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7908-7914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The importance of the CRD raised the possibility that TRX and/or GRX modulate the activity of Yap1 by the redox modification of cysteine residues, like OxyR, NF-ÎºB, and AP-1. To examine whether TRX and/or GRX attend the redox regulation of Yap1, we analyzed the phenotypes of the TRX- and GRX-deficient mutants with respect to the Yap1-mediated gene expression and the localization of Yap1. Here we show that TRX deficiency (trx1Î/trx2Î) caused the constitutive activation of Yap1 under aerobic conditions but not under anaerobic conditions, and that GRX deficiency (grx1Î/grx2Î) did not affect the Yap1 activity. We also provide the evidence that theyap1Î/trx1Î/trx2Î triple mutant shows the synthetic lethality while theyap1Î/grx1Î/grx2Î triple mutant was viable. S. cerevisiae YPH250 and YPH252 were obtained from the Yeast Genetic Stock Center, University of California, Berkeley, CA. Cells were cultured in 50 ml of SD minimal medium (2% glucose, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, pH 5.5) with appropriate amino acids and bases at 30 Â°C with reciprocal shaking in 200-ml Erlenmeyer flasks. For anaerobic cultivation, the medium was flushed with nitrogen gas, sealed up, and incubated without shaking at 30 Â°C. Exponentially growing cells were harvested at A610 = 0.5. Theyap1Î mutants were constructed by using pSM27 as described by Wu et al. (17Wu A. Wemmie J.A. Edgington N.P. Goebl M. Guevara J.L. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18850-18858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pSM27 was digested with EcoRI and transformed to YPH250 (MAT a trp-Î1 his3-Î200 lys2â801 leu2-Î1 ade2â101 ura3â52) and YPH252 (MATÎ± trp-Î1 his3-Î200 lys2â801 leu2-Î1 ade2â101 ura3â52) to yield theyap1Î and YA-1Î±, respectively. All mutants used in this study were derived from YPH250 except for YA-1Î± and YT-1Î± (see below). S. cerevisiae has two cytosolic TRX genes, TRX1and TRX2 (31Gan Z.-R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1692-1696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); one mitochondrial TRX gene, TRX3(32Pedrajas J.R. Kosmidou E. Miranda-Vizuete A. Gustafsson J.-â«. Wright A.P.H. Spyrou G. J.

Commun. 1992; 187: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 34Luikenhuis S. Perrone G. Dawes I.W. Grant C.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1081-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). To disrupt the TRX1 gene, theTRX1 gene was amplified using the following oligonucleotide primers: 5â²-GATCAGAATGATTGAAATCA-3â² and 5â²-GACGAGCTATAGGATGATGA-3â². The amplicon (2.0 kb) was treated by Klenow fragment, and then cloned, respectively, to the HincII site of pUC19 (pTR-1) and to the BamHI site of YEp13, which was also treated by Klenow fragment (YEpTRX1). The URA3 gene (1.2 kb) isolated from YEp24 was treated with Klenow fragment and inserted between the MunI/MunI sites internal to the TRX1 gene in pTR-1, which was also treated by Klenow fragment, to yield pTRD1. pTRD1 was digested with ApaLI andDraI, and the trx1Î::URA3fragment was transformed to YPH250 and YA-1Î± to yield thetrx1Î and YT-1Î±, respectively. Disruption of theTRX2 gene was done using thetrx2::HIS3 disruption plasmid, kindly provided by Drs. S. Kuge and N. Jones (21Kuge S. Jones N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Thetrx2::HIS3 disruption plasmid was digested with SphI, and thetrx2Î::HIS3 fragment was transformed to YPH250 and the trx1Î mutant to yield thetrx2Î mutant and the trx1Î/trx2Î mutant, respectively. Additionally, thetrx2::LEU2 disruption plasmid was constructed. The TRX2 gene was amplified by using the following oligonucleotide primers: 5â²-GATCAGCATAACTTGAGTGC-3â² and 5â²-GATCGCATGGAACGCCAAGC-3â². The amplicon (0.8 kb) was treated with Klenow fragment, and then cloned to the HincII site of pUC19 (pTR-2), and to the BamHI site of YEp13 (YEpTRX2), respectively. The LEU2 gene (2.2 kb) isolated from YEp13 was treated with Klenow fragment and inserted between theHincII/EcoO65I sites internal to theTRX2 gene in pTR-2, which was also treated with Klenow fragment, to yield pTRD2. pTRD2 was digested with PstI andSmaI, and the trx2Î::LEU2fragment was transformed to the yap1Î mutant to yield YT-2a. Mitochondrial thioredoxin gene, TRX3 (YCR083w), was also amplified using the following oligonucleotide primers: 5â²-GGCGGAGAATAGGGATCCACTGCGA-3â² and 5â²-GTCTCCGCTGGATCCAGAATATAAC-3â². The amplicon (1.4 kb) was digested with BamHI and cloned to the BamHI site of YEp13 (YEpTRX3). To disrupt the GRX genes, the GRX1 gene was amplified using the following primers: 5â²-CATCCTTAGAAAGGATCCCACATTG-3â² and 5â²-CGAGACGTACGGGATCCTAAAGTGG-3â². The amplicon (1.1 kb) was digested with BamHI and cloned to the BamHI site of YEp13 (YEpGRX1), and also to the BamHI site of pUC19 (pGR-1). A 1.2-kb BglII-ClaI fragment containing theTRP1 gene from pRS414 was inserted betweenBglII/ClaI sites internal to the GRX1gene in pGR-1 (pGRD1). pGRD1 was digested with SmaI andSalI, and the grx1Î::TRP1fragment was transformed to YPH250 to yield the grx1Î mutant. The GRX2 gene was also amplified using the following primers: 5â²-GGGTCATTGCCGTGGATCCTACAAAAC-3â² and 5â²-TACACGTGGATCCTGATGCTGAAGT-3â². The amplicon (1.2 kb) was digested with BamHI and cloned to the BamHI site of YEp13 (YEpGRX2), and also to the BamHI site of pUC19 (pGR-2). The URA3 gene (1.2 kb) isolated from YEp24 was treated with Klenow fragment and inserted between theBsaAI/BsaAI sites internal to the GRX2gene (pGRD2). pGRD2 was digested with SmaI andSacI, and the grx2Î::URA3fragment was transformed to YPH250 and the grx1Î to yield the grx2Î mutant and thegrx1Î/grx2Î mutant, respectively. Disruption of each gene was verified by polymerase chain reaction. Thetrx1Î/trx2Î mutant showed the methionine auxotrophy, the increase of cell size, and elongation of generation time as reported by Muller (35Muller E.G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9194-9202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TheGSH1 promoter fragment containing the region from â800 to +33 (+1 representing the start of translation) was generated by polymerase chain reaction using the primers: 5â²-TAATCTTATGAATCCCGGGGATTTTATCGG-3â² and 5â²-CTAGACTCAAACCCGGGCAAAGGCGTGCCC-3â². The amplicon was digested with SmaI and cloned into the SmaI site of pMC1871 containing the coding region of lacZ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), to yield pMC-GSH1lacZ. As a result of this construction, the first 11 amino acid residues of Gsh1 were fused to Î²-galactosidase whose first 8 amino acids were deleted. TheGSH1-lacZ in pMC-GSH1lacZ was isolated by digestion withSalI and cloned into the SalI site of pRS414 (pRS-GSH1lacZ). A Yap1-dependent lacZ reporter gene containing three SV40 AP-1 sites and the TATA element of theCYC1 promoter was kindly gifted by Dr. Kuge (21Kuge S. Jones N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 26Kuge S. Jones N. Nomoto A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1710-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 29Kuge S. Toda T. Iizuka N. Nomoto A. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Î²-Galactosidase activity was measured as described by Miller (36Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-356Google Scholar). One unit of the activity was defined as the amount of enzyme increasing A420 per hour at 30 Â°C. Protein was determined by the method of Lowry et al.(37Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Northern hybridization was performed using 25 Î¼g of total cellular RNA isolated from yeast cells by the method of Schmitt et al. (38Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 18: 3091-3092Crossref Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). The probes were generated by random primed labeling of the 0.4-kbEcoRV-BamHI fragment of GSH1 gene, 0.7-kb PvuII-HincII fragment of TRR1gene, and 1.1-kb EcoRI-PstI fragment ofACT1 gene, respectively, with [Î±-32P]dCTP using a kit (Random Primer DNA labeling kit version 2, Takara). pRS cup1 cp-GFP-YAP1 was kindly provided by Dr. Kuge (26Kuge S. Jones N. Nomoto A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1710-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). To visualize DNA, the cells were stained with 1 Î¼g/ml 4â²,6â²-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride. ANdeI/BamHI fragment encoding the whole coding region of the TRX2 gene was inserted into theNdeI/BamHI site of pET15-b (Novagen) to construct pET-TRX2. The resulting protein contained six histidine tag residues fused in-frame with the TRX2 coding region. pET-TRX2 was transferred into E. coli strain BL21(DE3). Histidine-tagged Trx2 was purified using histidine affinity column chromatography (His-trap, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), followed by gel filtration chromatography (Superdex 75, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Purified fusion protein was then used for the production of anti-yeast TRX antibody using New Zealand White rabbits. Immunization and purification of anti-Trx antibody were accomplished by Sawady Technology Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan. This anti-TRX antibody was specific to yeast TRX and was able to detect both Trx1 and Trx2. Immunofluorescence microscopic observation of yeast was performed by the methods of Rose et al. (39Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). Anti-rabbit IgG (H+L)-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FI-1000, Vector Laboratory Inc.) was used as the secondary antibody. Cell extracts were prepared according to Wemmie et al. (28Wemmie J.A. Steggerda S.M. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7908-7914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and 170 Î¼g of total protein of each sample was run on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were electrically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon, Millipore). Anti-Yap1 antiserum raised in rabbit was kindly gifted by Dr. Moye-Rowley. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratory, Inc.) and diaminobenzidine were used to visualize immunoreactive protein. The activity of glutathione reductase, total glutathione, and the susceptibility and adaptation to H2O2 were determined as described previously (40Izawa S. Inoue Y. Kimura A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 41Izawa S. Inoue Y. Kimura A. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Intracellular oxidation level of yeast was measured using the oxidant-sensitive probe 2â²,7â²-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) purchased from Molecular Probes (42Davidson J.F. Whyte B. Bissinger P.H. Schiestl R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Cells growing exponentially in SD medium were collected and resuspended in fresh SD medium containing 0.1 mmDCFH-DA and incubated at 30 Â°C for 20 min. After the incubation, cells were washed, resuspended in distilled water, and disrupted by vortexing with glass beads. Cell extracts (70 Î¼l) were mixed in 500 Î¼l of distilled water, and fluorescence was measured with Î»ex = 490 nm and Î»em = 524 nm using a Hitachi F-3000 spectrofluorometer. Mating, sporulation, dissection, and tetrad analysis of yeast were done as described by Roseet al. (39Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). In order to see the effect of TRX and GRX on the activity of Yap1, we investigated the levels of cellular glutathione and glutathione reductase (GR) activity in the TRX- and GRX-deficient mutants. The GSH1 and GLR1 genes, which are target genes for Yap1 (19Wu A.-L. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5832-5839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Grant C.M. Collinson L.P. Roe J.-H. Dawes I.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), encode Î³-glutamylcysteine synthetase (Gsh1) and GR, respectively (43Ohtake Y. Yabuuchi S. Yeast. 1991; 7: 6953-6961Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 44Collinson L.P. Dawes I. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 156: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The Gsh1 catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step of glutathione synthesis (45Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (5972) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is conceivable that the levels of intracellular glutathione and GR activity reflect the activity of Yap1. Table I shows the levels of total glutathione and GR activity in various mutants. As reported previously, the yap1Î mutant showed lower levels of total glutathione and GR activity than the wild type (19Wu A.-L. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5832-5839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Grant C.M. Collinson L.P. Roe J.-H. Dawes I.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Total glutathione and GR activity in the wild type were increased by the treatment with 0.2 mm H2O2, but not in theyap1Î mutant (46Izawa S. Maeda K. Miki T. Mano J. Inoue Y. Kimura A. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The levels of glutathione and GR activity in trx1Î/trx2Î were constitutively high under non-stressed conditions, and the values were higher than those in the wild type which was treated with H2O2. This indicates that the loss of both Trx1 and Trx2 affects intracellular glutathione metabolism. GRX deficiency (grx1Î/grx2Î) and single-gene mutation of TRX or GRX genes did not affect total glutathione levels and GR activity (data for single-gene mutants are not shown), and our results are consistent with the previous reports (34Luikenhuis S. Perrone G. Dawes I.W. Grant C.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1081-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 47Muller E.G.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1805-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The results in Table Iimply that Yap1 is constitutively activated intrx1Î/trx2Î even though the cells are not exposed to oxidative stress.Table ICellular total glutathione contents and GR activity in various mutantsStrainH2O2GlutathioneGR activityÎ¼mol/g cellmilliunits/mgWild typeâ1.81 Â± 0.1274.2 Â± 5.8+2.08 Â± 0.1197.3 Â± 6.4yap1Îâ0.85 Â± 0.0946.5 Â± 4.2+0.87 Â± 0.0951.0 Â± 5.0grx1Î/grx2Îâ1.76 Â± 0.1276.0 Â± 5.4+1.90 Â± 0.1295.4 Â± 3.8trx1Î/trx2Îâ2.78 Â± 0.22117.0 Â± 8.4+3.14 Â± 0.20143.0 Â± 8.8Cells growing exponentially were treated with or without 0.2 mm H2O2 for 60 min.

One unit of GR was defined as the amount of enzyme reducing 1.0 Î¼mol of GSSG/min at 25 Â°C. To confirm the constitutive activation of Yap1 in the TRX-deficient mutant, we next assessed the expression of the lacZ reporter gene under the control of the GSH1 promoter. A fusion gene was constructed containing the lacZ coding region fused to the GSH1 promoter sequence which contains the Yap1 binding site (5â²-TTAGTCA-3â²) (19Wu A.-L. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5832-5839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 A, Î²-galactosidase activity was increased with H2O2 treatment in the wild type, but not in the yap1Î, as reported previously (48Stephan D.W.S. Rivers S.T. Jamieson D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The Î²-galactosidase activities in single mutants (trx1Î or trx2Î) under non-stressed conditions were the same to that in the wild type. On the contrary, the basal level of Î²-galactosidase activity in trx1Î/trx2Î was significantly higher than that of the wild type, and the value was almost the same as that of the wild type treated with 0.2 mm H2O2 (the wild type with H2O2, 88.8 Â± 1.3;trx1Î/trx2Î without H2O2, 95.1 Â± 1.2 units/mg). The Î²-galactosidase activity in trx1Î/trx2Î was scarcely increased by the treatment with H2O2, suggesting that Yap1 activity was constitutively high and presumably saturated in the trx1Î/trx2Î mutant under non-stressed conditions. We reconfirmed the increased expression of the GSH1 gene intrx1Î/trx2Î by Northern blotting analysis (Fig. 1 B). Basal level of the GSH1 gene expression in trx1Î/trx2Î was almost the same as that of the H2O2-treated wild type. Expression of the GSH1 gene intrx1Î/trx2Î did not increase with 0.2 mm H2O2 stress. These results were in good agreement with those obtained by using the GSH1-lacZreporter gene assay. Expression of the TRR1 gene, another target gene for Yap1 (22Morgan B.A. Banks G.R. Toone W.M. Raitt D. Kuge S. Johnston L.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), was also constitutively high intrx1Î/trx2Î, but not ingrx1Î/grx2Î (Fig. 1 C). In yeast and other eukaryotic cells, expression of most genes is controlled by multiple transcription factors acting co-operatively (49Robertson L.M. Kerppola T.K. Vandrell M. Luk D. Smeyne R.J. Bocchiaro C. Morgan J.I. Curran T. Neuron. 1995; 14: 241-252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). To see whether other factor(s) that may bind to theGSH1 promoter region are involved in increased expression of the GSH1-lacZ reporter gene in thetrx1Î/trx2Î mutant, we also examined the expression of a lacZ reporter gene driven by three SV40 AP-1 sites and the TATA element of the CYC1 promoter (21Kuge S.

Bovine and human forms of fetuin glycoprotein bind to the transforming growth factor (TGF)-Î²/BMP (bone morphogenic protein) cytokines and block their osteogenic activity in cell culture assays (Demetriou, M., Binkert, C., Sukhu, B., Tenenbaum, H. C., and Dennis, J. W. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 12755â12761). Fetuin is a prominent serum glycoprotein and a major noncollagenous component of mineralized bone in mammals. In this study, we show that recombinant fetuin and native serum protein have similar potency as inhibitors of osteogenesis in dexamethasone-treated rat bone marrow cell cultures (dex-RBMC). Recombinant bovine fetuin also bound to TGF-Î²1 and BMP-2 in vitro with kinetics similar to native fetuin. Although TGF-Î²1 is required for osteogenesis in dex-RBMC, the cytokine also inhibited osteogenesis at concentrations â¥10 pm. Titration of fetuin or anti-TGF-Î²1 antibodies into the bone marrow cultures in the presence of 10 pm TGF-Î²1 restored osteogenesis, whereas titrations of the same reagents into cultures with 0.3 pmadded TGF-Î²1 were inhibitory, confirming the biphasic nature of the TGF-Î²1 response. Suppression of osteogenesis by both TGF-Î²1 and the antagonist proteins required their presence within the first 6 days of culture, well before mineralization at 10â12 days. Northern analysis showed that both fetuin and high dose TGF-Î²1 suppressed expression of the bone-associated transcripts alkaline phosphatase, osteopontin, collagen type I, and bone sialoprotein. The suppression of osteogenesis by fetuin and by high dose TGF-Î²1 was accompanied by the differentiation of an alternate cell lineage with adipocyte characteristics. In summary, the biphasic osteogenic response to TGF-Î²1 suggests that overlapping gradients of TGF-Î²/BMP cytokines and fetuin regulate osteogenesis in remodeling bone.

Serum fetuin measured in cattle, sheep, and goats is highest in the 3rd trimester (i.e. 10â22 g/liter) and declines after birth by an order of magnitude in adults (reviewed in Ref. 4Nie Z. Am. J. Med. 1992; 263: 551-562Google Scholar). Fetuin is a negative acute phase reactant (5Lebreton J.P. Joisel F. Raoult J.P. Lannuzel B. Rogez J.P. Humbert G. J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 64: 118-129Crossref Scopus (300) Google Scholar), and serum levels decline in some cancer patients correlating with impaired cellular immune function (6Baskies A.M. Chretien P.B.

Patients with Paget's disease, an affliction of increased bone turnover with disordered and thickened bone, show depressed serum AHSG levels (7Ashton B.A. Smith R. Clin. Sci. ( Lond. ). 1980; 58: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Elevation of serum AHSG has been correlated with a common form of mild osteogenesis imperfecta where bone mass is lost (8Dickson I.R. Bagga M. Paterson C.R. Calcif. Tissue.

Fetuin does not appear to be required for embryogenesis, as mice lacking the protein are viable with no gross anatomical abnormality at birth (11Jahnen-Dechent W. Schinke T. Tridl A. Muller-Esterl W.

However, fetuin-deficient mice show altered cellular and biomechanical properties in bone at 3 months of age. 2M. Szweras, B. Sukhu, M. Kasra, H. C. Tenenbaum, W. Jahnen-Dechent, M. D. Grynpas, and J. W. Dennis, manuscript in preparation. 2M. Szweras, B. Sukhu, M. Kasra, H. C. Tenenbaum, W. Jahnen-Dechent, M. D. Grynpas, and J. W. Dennis, manuscript in preparation. We have reported that fetuin binds to BMP-2 > BMP-4 > BMP-6 > TGF-Î²1 > TGF-Î²2 withKD values ranging from 2 Ã 10â8m to 2 Ã 10â6m, respectively (12Demetriou M. Binkert C. Sukhu B. Tenenbaum H.C. Dennis J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12755-12761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Fetuin and the TGF-Î² receptor type II (TÎ²RII) share sequence homology within a 19â20-amino acid disulfide-looped sequence designated TGF-Î²receptor homology domain (TRH1), which defines the major cytokine binding domain. Cyclized TRH1 peptides bind directly to TGF-Î²1 and BMP-2 cytokines and competitively inhibit TGF-Î² binding to TÎ²RII. Fetuin blocked TGF-Î²1 activity in cell cultures with an IC50 of 1â2 Î¼m in cell culture, similar to the KD value measured by surface plasmon resonance. Fetuin concentrations in human serum are similar to the TGF-Î²1 binding constant, consistent with a role for fetuin in regulating TGF-Î² activity in vivo (12Demetriou M. Binkert C. Sukhu B. Tenenbaum H.C. Dennis J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12755-12761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Considering the higher affinity of fetuin for BMP cytokines than TGF-Î²s, the antagonist may also regulate their activities. The BMPs are important in skeletal development during embryogenesis (13Hogan B.L.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar) and induce ectopic bone formation when injected into animals (14Rosen V. Thies R.S. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 97-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). TGF-Î²1 is concentrated in mineralized human bone but declines in concentration with age, and levels in bone matrix correlate with bone turnover rates (15Pfeilschifter J. Diel I. Scheppach B. Bretz A. Krempien R. Erdmann J. Schmid G. Reske N. Bismar H. Seck T. Krempien B. Ziegler R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 716-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The release and activation of TGF-Î²1 by osteoclasts in bone matrix has been implicated in several sequential steps in bone remodeling: recruitment of osteoblast precursor cells, induction of matrix deposition, and mineralization. In mice, an age-related decline in bone TGF-Î²1 is associated with reduced numbers and responsiveness of the bone marrow osteoprogenitor cells (16Gazit D. Zilberman Y. Ebner R. Kahn A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 70: 478-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A polymorphism in the coding region of the TGF-Î²1 gene has been correlated with decreased serum levels of TGF-Î²1 and susceptibility to osteoporosis in postmenopausal Japanese women (17Yamada Y. Miyauchi A. Goto J. Takagi Y. Okuizumi H. Kanematsu M. Hase M. Takai H. Harada A. Ikeda K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 1569-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In cell culture models of osteogenesis, TGF-Î²1 appears to regulate sequential events including stimuli for osteoblast precursor cell recruitment and differentiation, cessation of cell proliferation, synthesis, and deposition of matrix proteins and mineralization (18Owen T.A. Aronow M. Shalhoub V. Barone L.M. Wilming L. Tassinari M.S. Kennedy M.B. Pockwinse S. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 143: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). The addition of glucocorticoid (i.e. dexamethasone) to rat bone marrow cell cultures (dex-RBMC) enhances the activation of latent TGF-Î², which correlates with osteogenic differentiation and expression of the osteoblast markers alkaline phosphatase (AP), osteopontin (OPN), bone sialoprotein (BSP) and collagen type I, as well as promoting mineralization (19Sukhu B. Rotenberg B. Binkert C. Kohno H. Zohar R. Tenenbaum H.C. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3269-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that recombinant bovine fetuin, made as a fusion protein with maltose-binding protein (MBP-fetuin) inEscherichia coli has similar affinities for TGF-Î²1 and BMP-2 as the native protein as well as similar potency in regulating osteogenesis in dex-RBMC. Furthermore, we demonstrate that TGF-Î²1 produced in the cultures is necessary for differentiation, but that excess exogenous TGF-Î²1 completely inhibited mineralization. This biphasic response to TGF-Î²1 showed a pronounced optimum, and addition of both exogenous fetuin and neutralizing anti-TGF-Î²1 antibodies shifted the TGF-Î²1 optimum for osteogenesis. Both fetuin and high dose TGF-Î²1 inhibited dex-induced increases in AP, BSP, OPN, and Coll I transcripts, as well as mineralization while promoting the differentiation of cells with adipocyte characteristics. This suggests that suboptimal levels of TGF-Î²1 block osteogenic differentiation and are permissive for adipogenesis in dex-RBMC. Our results show that fetuin antagonizes TGF-Î²1 activity in dex-RBMC and suggests that gradients of cytokine and antagonists may regulate osteogenic and adipogenic cell differentiation in bone. Bovine fetuin was purchased from Sigma (catalog #F3004), and bovine serum albumin was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (fraction V). R&D Systems Research provided recombinant human TGF-Î²1 (catalog #240B), recombinant human sTÎ²RII/Fc (catalog #341-BR), and anti-TGF-Î²1-neutralizing antibodies (catalog #AB-101-NA). Recombinant human BMP-2 was kindly supplied by Genetics Institute. Bovine fetuin was expressed as an MBP fusion protein in the pMal-c2 vector (New England Biolabs). Full-length fetuin cDNA was cloned by polymerase chain reaction from a bovine liver cDNA library (Stratagene). Polymerase chain reaction-directed mutagenesis was used to connect the open reading frames of MBP and fetuin. The signal peptide of fetuin, which is the C-terminal fusion partner, was removed during this process. The amino acid sequence at the site of the fusion was IEGRISEFGSSRVENSIPLD. IEGR is the recognition sequence for factor Xa protease, which is present at the C terminus of MBP. IPLD represents the N terminus of native fetuin. The nucleotide sequence of the entire cDNA inserted into the expression vector was verified. The MBP fusion protein was expressed in the E. coli strain AD494 (Novagen). An overnight culture of the cells carrying the MBP-fetuin expression construct was diluted 1/100 into 660 ml of LB medium (Difco, catalog #0446-17-3) containing 100 Î¼g/ml ampicillin. The culture was grown at 37 Â°C to an A600 of approximately 0.9, at which point isopropyl-1-thio-Î²-d-galactopyranoside was added to the medium for a final concentration of 0.5 mm. Recombinant protein expression was induced for 2 h at 37 Â°C. The cells were harvested in a GSA rotor (4000 rpm for 20 min at 4 Â°C), resuspended in 17 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mmNa2HPO4 (pH 7.0), 30 mm NaCl, 0.25% Tween 20, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm Î²-mercaptoethanol), frozen in a 50-ml falcon tube in dry ice/ethanol, and stored at â20 Â°C. The extract was thawed on ice and sonicated on ice with an 8-mm tip for a total of 90 s in 2 intervals. 0.1 volume of 5 m NaCl was added, and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (SS34 rotor, 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 Â°C). The supernatant was diluted into 5 volumes of column buffer (10 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 7.2), 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mmÎ²-mercaptoethanol, filtered) and passed at room temperature through an amylose affinity column (New England Biolabs, catalog #800-21) that was equilibrated with column buffer. The column was washed with 3 bed volumes of column buffer, 0.25% Tween 20 and with 3 bed volumes of column buffer. MBP-fetuin was eluted with 3 bed volumes of column buffer, 10 mm maltose. The A280 of the eluate was determined, and the material was stored at â20 Â°C. The eluate from the amylose column was thawed and centrifuged to pellet precipitates. The solution was concentrated toA280 of approximately 4 with a Centricon 30 cartridge (Amicon), and the concentration of maltose was reduced to less than 1 mm with several rounds of concentrating the solution and rediluting in column buffer. The proteins were denatured and reduced by the addition of 40% (weight/volume) urea and 0.1 volume of 1 m dithiothreitol and nutated at room temperature for 2 h. The solution was centrifuged to remove precipitates, transferred into a syringe (piston removed), and slowly allowed to drip through a 27-gauge hypodermic needle into 1000 volumes of renaturation buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 2 mm reduced glutathione, 0.2 mm oxidized glutathione, 0.01% sodium azide, filtered through a 0.2-Î¼m filter). The buffer was slowly stirred in a siliconized Erlenmeyer flask at room temperature in the dark. Incubation was for 60 h. The renatured protein was concentrated to 50 ml using an H1-P30-20 hollow fiber cartridge (Amicon) and then to 1.5 ml with a Centriprep 30 (Amicon). The solution was then subjected to 3 rounds of 10-fold dilutions in HBS (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 150 mmNaCl) and subsequent reconcentrations to change the buffer to HBS. The solution was sterile-filtered and further concentrated in a Centricon 30 cartridge (sterilized with 70% ethanol and rinsed with sterile HBS). Protein concentration was determined with Bio-Rad BCA reagent and by estimation from the intensity of bands in acrylamide gels stained with Coomassie Blue. Protein concentrations up to 30 mg/ml could be achieved in this manner without protein precipitation. Acrylamide gel electrophoresis (Novex) performed in the absence of reducing agents was used to assess the success of refolding of the MBP-fetuin preparations. Misfolded proteins tended to be cross-linked through intermolecular disulfide bridges, which could be identified on nonreducing gels. Western blots derived from nonreducing gels were probed with anti-MBP (New England Biolabs) or anti-fetuin antisera (Dako) to enhance sensitivity and to identify degradation products and contaminants. The MBP-fetuin preparations routinely were greater than 90% monomeric, with little multimeric or degraded MBP-fetuin and with little contaminating protein. Femoral bones were removed under aseptic conditions from adult male Wistar rats (120 g), cleaned of adherent soft tissues, and washed extensively in antibiotics. The distal ends were removed, and the marrow contents were flushed out with 10 ml of culture medium. The cells were dispersed by repeated passage through a 20-gauge needle and incubated in Î±- minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, ascorbic acid (50 Î¼g/ml), antibiotics (penicillin G 100 Î¼g/ml, gentamicin 50 Î¼g/ml, Fungizone 0.3 Î¼g/ml), 10 mmÎ²-glycerophosphate, and vitamin C. The culture media were supplemented further with dexamethasone (10â8m). After 6 days of culture, the cells were replated at a density of 1 Ã 102 cells/mm2 in 96-well plates and grown for another 12â14 days, with changes of the same medium at 48-h intervals. At the end of the culture, the cells were fixed with 10% buffered formalin and stained for calcium with alizarin red S to identify mineralized bone nodules. To quantify mineralized tissue formation in the cultures, the absorbance at 525 nm was measured using a 96-well plate reader. Duplicate wells were stained for lipid content. Cells were fixed with 70% ethanol and stained with Sudan IV in acetone/ethanol for 20 min and then washed with 70% ethanol for photographic documentation. Binding constants for bovine serum fetuin and recombinant fetuin were measured using the BIAcore machine and BIA-evaluation software (Pharmacia Biosensor) (33Faure S. Vigneron S. Galas S. Brassac T.

Bone. 1998; 23: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). TGF-Î²1 and BMP-2 were immobilized onto the carboxymethylated dextran surface of the CM5 sensor chip. The running buffer was 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, and the flow rate was 3 Î¼l/min. Protein binding to the surface causes a change in reflected light, which is directly proportional to mass bound and is measured in arbitrary response units. Protein binding is observed in two ways, increasing response with time during the injection phase and the difference in the position of the base line before and after injection. Regeneration of the surface to remove bound analyte was done by injecting 10 Î¼l of 20 mm NaOH. RNA was extracted from the rat bone marrow cultures by using a guanidinium isothiocyanate procedure as described (20Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). Total RNA was run on a 1% agarose gel containing 2% formaldehyde and 1 Ã MOPS buffer and transferred to Genescreen (Dupont) membrane. Full-length rat cDNA probes for AP, OPN, BSP, and collagen type I were labeled using [32P]dCTP by random priming and used to probe Northern blots. Hybridization was done at 65 Â°C using a sodium phosphate hybridization buffer (0.5 m NaP, 0.001 m EDTA, 7% SDS). The membrane was washed for 15 min at room temperature followed by 2 Ã 30 min at 65 Â°C (30 mm NaP, 0.1%SDS) before exposure. Commercially available sources of bovine fetuin are purified from serum by differential precipitation methods. It has been suggested in the past that impurities in fetuin preparations might contribute to some of the effects reported for fetuin in biological assays (reviewed in Ref. 4Nie Z. Am. J. Med. 1992; 263: 551-562Google Scholar). We produced recombinant fetuin as an MBP fusion protein inE. coli to confirm cytokine binding activity and anti-osteogenic activities attributed to native fetuin. Following affinity purification and refolding in vitro, MBP-fetuin was more than 90% monomeric with a minor fraction of dimeric protein as indicated by mobility in nondenaturing SDS-PAGE (Fig.1). Surface plasmon resonance measurements showed that MBP-fetuin and native fetuin protein bound to TGF-Î²1 with similar on- and off-rates (TableI). MBP-fetuin also bound to BMP-2; however, the off-rate was faster than that of native fetuin binding to BMP-2. Neither denatured MBP-fetuin nor reduced and alkylated native fetuin bound to TGF-Î² cytokines (data not shown). These results establish that recombinant MBP-fetuin binds TGF-Î² cytokines with affinities similar to those of commercially prepared fetuin.Table ITGF-Î²1 and BMP-2 binding to fetuin and recombinant MBP-fetuinLigandAnalytekasskdissKDmâ1sâ1sâ1mTGF-Î²1Fetuin8.7 Ã 102 Â± 2.7 Ã 1021.9 Ã 10â3 Â± 6.0 Ã 10â42.2 Ã 10â6TGF-Î²1MBP-fetuin8.1 Ã 102 Â± 7.5 Ã 1014.8 Ã 10â3 Â± 5.4 Ã 10â45.9 Ã 10â6BMP-2Fetuin2.4 Ã 103 Â± 1.2 Ã 1036.5 Ã 10â5 Â± 2.1 Ã 10â52.7 Ã 10â8BMP-2MBP-fetuin9.0 Ã 103 Â± 6.0 Ã 1023.9 Ã 10â3 Â± 9.9 Ã 10â44.3 Ã 10â7Binding constants for fetuin and recombinant MBP-fetuin binding to TGF-Î² and BMP-2 measured using the BIAcore and BIA-evaluation software (Pharmacia Biosensor).

Treatment of RBMC with 10â8m dex for 12 days resulted in an increase in active TGF-Î² in the culture medium (12Demetriou M. Binkert C. Sukhu B. Tenenbaum H.C. Dennis J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12755-12761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar,21Oursler M.J. Riggs B.L. Spelberg T.C. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2187-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and in osteogenesis and mineralization. TGF-Î²1 is required for osteogenesis in the dex-RBMC cultures, because specific TGF-Î² antagonists like sTÎ²RII/Fc and polyclonal anti-TGF-Î²1 antibody blocked mineralization. sTÎ²RII/Fc showed an IC50 value of 300 pm in the dex-RBMC assay (Fig.2). MBP-fetuin and native fetuin proteins showed IC50 values of 2â3 Î¼m in dex-RBMC (Fig. 2). These values are very similar to the fetuin-TGF-Î²1 binding constant measured by surface plasmon resonance (Table I). The control proteins, human transferrin and bovine serum albumin, had no effect. These results confirmed that fetuin and not a serum contaminant of the commercial preparations is the active molecule in the dex-RMBC assay. Exogenous TGF-Î²1 at concentrations greater than 10 pmalso completely inhibited mineralization (Fig.3 A). Therefore, it appears that response to TGF-Î²1 is biphasic, and both cytokine and fetuin may promote or antagonize osteogenesis depending upon their relative concentrations. To test this hypothesis, fetuin and anti-TGF-Î²1 antibodies were titrated into cultures with either 0.3 or 10 pm of exogenous TGF-Î²1. Indeed, both TGF-Î² antagonists completely reversed the inhibitory effect of 10 pm TGF-Î²1 and also suppressed the action of low dose TGF-Î² (Fig. 3,B and C). In effect, optimal osteogenesis in the dex-RBMC cultures is dependent upon the ratio of TGF-Î² to antagonist protein. Time course experiments were done to determine whether inhibition of osteogenesis in dex-RBMC by fetuin occurs during osteoblast differentiation or late with hydroxyapatite formation. Inhibition by fetuin occurred during the first 6 days of culture, well before mineralization, which is observed at 10â12 days (Fig.4). Furthermore, when added after 6 days of culture, 1â30 Î¼m concentrations of fetuin did not inhibit mineralization. Fetuin has been shown to inhibit hydroxyapatite formation in vitro, with an IC50 of 0.5 Î¼m, via a calcium binding motif in the first cystatin-like domain of the protein (22Schinke T. Amendt C. Trindl A. Poschke O. Muller-Esterl W. Jahnen-Dechent W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20789-20796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar); however, in our hands this activity did not inhibit mineralization in the RBMC cultures. To further characterize the developmental stage at which fetuin and high dose TGF-Î²1 block osteogenesis in dex-RBMC, transcripts of several genes normally induced during osteogenic differentiation were examined by Northern blot analysis. Transcript levels for AP, BSP, OPN, and Coll I increased 10 days after the addition of dex to the RBMC cultures (Fig. 5). Fetuin and high dose TGF-Î²1 suppressed dex-induced increases in these transcripts, whereas anti-TGF-Î²1 antibodies had no effect. This suggests that fetuin and high dose TGF-Î²1 both block early stages of differentiation, whereas anti-TGF-Î²1 inhibits at a later stage, following progenitor cell commitment. The results suggest that TGF-Î² cytokines are required at more than one stage of cellular differentiation and that TGF-Î²1 is specifically required following induction of AP, BSP, OPN, and Coll I gene expression. The inhibition of osteogenesis in dex-RBMC by fetuin was accompanied by the appearance of large cells in the cultures. These cells stained positive with Sudan IV, a characteristic of adipocytes (Fig. 6 A). A reciprocal relationship between Sudan IV-positive cells and alizarin red S staining cultures was observed with increasing fetuin concentrations in the dex-RBMC (Fig. 6 B). Sudan IV-positive cells were also observed in the high dose TGF-Î²-treated cultures but at a much lower frequency (i.e. 5â10/well) than in fetuin-treated cultures. Cultures treated with anti-TGF-Î²1 antibody showed no evidence of Sudan IV-positive cells or mineralization, consistent with a block at a stage following commitment to an osteogenic lineage but before terminal differentiation and mineralization. Both fetuin and TGF-Î²1 are present in bone matrix at high concentrations relative to other tissues and have previously been implicated in bone remodeling (1Triffitt J.T. Gebauer U. Ashton B.A. Owen M.E. Nature. 1976; 262: 226-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 2Dickson I.R. Poole A.R. Veis A. Nature. 1975; 256: 430-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 23Yang F. Schwartz Z. Swain L.D. Lee C.-C. Bowman B.H. Boyan B.D. Blood. 1991; 12: 7-15Google Scholar). The TRH1 peptide domain of fetuin is related in sequence to the cytokine binding domain of TÎ²RII, and fetuin binds directly to TGF-Î²1, -Î²2, and BMP-2, -4, -6 cytokines (12Demetriou M. Binkert C. Sukhu B. Tenenbaum H.C. Dennis J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12755-12761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In this report, we showed that recombinant MBP-fetuin produced in E. coli and refolded in vitro has similar binding kinetics for TGF-Î²1 and BMP-2 as the native protein from bovine serum. Therefore, fetuin requires neither mammalian glycosylation nor phosphorylation to bind TGF-Î² cytokines, as these modifications are absent in the E. coli-produced protein. In addition to comparable affinity for cytokines, recombinant and native fetuin had similar IC50 values for inhibition of osteogenesis in dex-RBMC, confirming that fetuin rather than a contaminant of the native protein preparation was the active molecule in the assay. Titration of TGF-Î²1 into dex-RBMC produced a biphasic response with complete inhibition at â¥10 pm and an optimal osteogenic response at â¼1 pm. By titrating both TGF-Î²1 and antagonist proteins into the dex-RBMC, we have demonstrated that the optimal osteogenic response is a function of their relative concentrations. The working range for inhibition observed in the dex-RBMC cultures was 0.3 to 10 pm TGF-Î² and 0.1 to 3 Î¼m fetuin, a molar ratio of 1/300,000 and a reflection of the physiological levels of these proteins. The biphasic response to TGF-Î²1 may be a manifestation of cytokine and antagonist gradientsin vivo, creating a zone or front of osteogenic differentiation defined by opposing gradients of cytokine and antagonist. Both fetuin and TGF-Î²1 levels are more concentrated in bone rather than in osteoid and marrow (24Pinero G.J. Farach-Carson M.C. Devoll R.E. Aubin J.E. Brunn J.C. Butler W.T. Arch. Oral Biol. 1995; 40: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 25Centrella M. McCarthy T.L. Canalis E. J. Bone Jt. Surg. Am. 1991; 73: 1418-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Hence, osteoclast-mediated destruction of bone during remodeling may increase local TGF-Î² cytokine concentrations, whereas fetuin and other serum antagonists may serve to confine the zone of precursor cell recruitment and osteogenic differentiation. A number of TGF-Î²/BMP/activin cytokine-binding proteins with antagonist activity have been identified in mammals, Xenopus and Drosophila (13Hogan B.L.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar). In the gastrula stage, the long range effects of two BMP inhibitors, noggin and chordin, establish a BMP-4 gradient (26Jones C.M. Smith J.C. Dev. Biol. 1998; 194: 12-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Mice lacking noggin protein show failure of chondrocyte positioning to form joints (27Brunet L.J. McMahon J.A. McMahon A.P. Harland R.M. Science. 1998; 280: 1455-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Other TGF-Î² cytokine-binding proteins include follistatin, serum Î±2-macroglobulin (28O'Connor-McCourt M.D. Wakefield L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14090-14099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), soluble betaglycan (29Lopez-Casillas F. Payne H.M. Andres J.L. Massague J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), the proteoglycans, decorin, biglycan, and fibromodulin (30Yamaguchi Y. Mann D.M. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1990; 346: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar;31Hildebrand A. Romaris M. Rasmussen L.M. Heinegard D. Twardzik D.R. Border W.A. Ruoslahti E. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar), each with varying cytokine specificity and affinity. Biglycan is implicated in bone remodeling, as mice deficient in biglycan show a progressive deficiency in bone mass with age (32Xu T. Bianco P. Fisher L.W. Longenecker G. Smith E. Goldstein S. Bonadio J. Boskey A. Heegaard A.-M. Sommer B. Satomura K. Dominguez P. Zhao C. Kulkarni A.B. Gehron Robey P. Young M.F. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Fetuin-deficient mice also show differences in bone properties.2 Bone loss and risk of fractures are common side effects of glucocorticoid treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, chronic active hepatitis, and asthma. Glucocorticoids stimulate osteogenesis and mineralization in RBMC, but repeated stimulation results in depletion of osteoprogenitor cells, which may also contribute to bone lossin vivo (33Faure S. Vigneron S. Galas S. Brassac T. Delsert C. Morin N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3573-3579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Glucocorticoids enhance TGF-Î²1 levels in RBMC cultures and may do so in vivo as well, but levels of cytokines and antagonists in vivo likely differ from cell culture experiments. More importantly, the biphasic osteogenic response to TGF-Î²1 suggests that either overexpression or depletion of the cytokine could suppress osteogenesis in vivo. In this regard, TGF-Î²1-deficient mice show decreased longitudinal growth and reduced bone mass (34Geiser A.G Zeng Q.Q. Sato M. Hirano T. Turner C.H. Bone. 1998; 23: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and TGF-Î²2 transgenic mice expressing the cytokine in osteoblasts also show loss of bone mass and increased mineral apposition rates (35Erlebacher A. Derynck R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 195-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Although the gross features of bone morphology in these mice are similar, the molecular and cellular phenotypes associated with overexpression and depletion of TGF-Î² in bone likely differ substantially. Nevertheless, with a biphasic osteogenic response to TGF-Î²1, it is possible that both depletion and increased availability of cytokine have similar pathological consequences on bone remodeling. The levels of antagonist proteins in the microenvironment and their effects on the strength of cytokine gradients may determine the rates and spatial precision of osteogenesis in remodeling bone. Although opposing gradients of factor and antagonist reduce the potency of a signal, they can effectively increase both the sharpness of the concentration gradient, and in addition, the alignment between the sources of cytokine and antagonist may improve directionality of cell movement (36Barki N. Rose M.D. Wingreen N.S. Nature. 1998; 396: 422-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In bone remodeling, this feature of cytokine regulation may add precision and sharpness to the boundaries between osteoid, mineralized bone and non-bone regions. Osteogenic differentiation in dex-RMBC involves sequential events, including cell proliferation, commitment of pre-osteoblast cells, matrix deposition, and finally matrix mineralization (18Owen T.A. Aronow M. Shalhoub V. Barone L.M. Wilming L. Tassinari M.S. Kennedy M.B. Pockwinse S. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 143: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). The addition of fetuin or anti-TGF-Î²1 antibodies to dex-RBMC before the 6th day of the 12-day culture period was necessary and sufficient to block mineralization. This indicates that both proteins interfere with osteogenic differentiation and act before the mineralization stage. However, fetuin appeared to block bone formation at an earlier stage of differentiation than anti-TGF-Î²1 antibodies, as the latter protein did not block induction of the bone-associated transcripts AP, BSP, OPN, and Coll I. Tamoxifen, an estrogen analogue used in the treatment of breast cancer, also blocks dex-RBMC osteogenesis at a stage post-expression of the AP, BSP, OPN, and Coll I transcripts (19Sukhu B. Rotenberg B. Binkert C. Kohno H. Zohar R. Tenenbaum H.C. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3269-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Tamoxifen treatment reduces bone loss, possibly by inducing TGF-Î² gene expression (19Sukhu B. Rotenberg B. Binkert C. Kohno H. Zohar R. Tenenbaum H.C. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3269-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Fetuin binds to BMPs as well as the TGF-Î² cytokines and therefore may block osteogenesis earlier by neutralizing several cytokines. The addition of BMPs to RBMC enhances osteogenesis (37Centrella M. Casinghino S. Kim J. Pham T. Rosen V. Wozney J. McCarthy T.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3273-3281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, glucocorticoid stimulates BMPs- 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 production in cultured fetal calvarial cell, which contribute to osteogenic commitment in vitro (38Boden S.D. Hair G. Titus L. Racine M. McCuaig K. Wozney J.M. Nanes M.S. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2820-2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Osteogenesis in dex-RBMC proceeded further in the presence of anti-TGF-Î²1 antibodies, suggesting the cytokine was specifically required in the later phases of matrix deposition and mineralization. In mouse bone marrow cultures, TGF-Î²1 levels have been shown to rise in the first 4â5 days of osteogenic differentiation, then decline and rise again late in the mineralization phase (39Van Vlasselaer P. Borremans B. van Gorp U. Dasch J.R. De Waal-Malefyt R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 569-577Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The early increase in TGF-Î²1 appears to coincide with the proliferation phase of pre-osteoblast cells and may also be required for osteogenesis. However, the addition of high dose TGF-Î²1 into the cultures suppressed dex-induced expression of the bone-associated genes. TGF-Î²1 is known to suppress proliferation of many cell types and, if present at high concentration or at the wrong time, may block expansion of the osteoblast precursor cells. Dex-RBMC differentiate primarily along the osteogenic lineage under the culture conditions used in our experiments, but other cell lineages including macrophage and adipocyte have also been observed in RBMCs (40Herbertson A. Aubin J.E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Inhibition of osteogenesis by either fetuin and, to a lesser degree, high dose TGF-Î²1 resulted in an increase in adipocyte-like cells in the cultures, suggesting that TGF-Î² regulates a reciprocal relationship between osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation in the cultures. Consistent with this interpretation of the results, fetuin-deficient mice show a marked increase in marrow adipocytes.2 Our results show that fetuin functions as a TGF-Î²/BMP cytokine antagonist and regulator of osteogenesis and suggests that overlapping gradients of cytokines and antagonists regulate osteogenesis in bone remodeling.

https://openalex.org/W2146622690,"Human natural killer cells and a subset of T cells express a repertoire of killer cell immunoglobulin receptors (KIRs) that recognize major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. KIRs and T cell receptors (TCRs) bind in a peptide-dependent manner to overlapping regions of peptide-MHC class I complexes. KIRs with two immunoglobulin domains (KIR2Ds) recognize distinct subsets of HLA-C alleles. Here we use surface plasmon resonance to study the binding of soluble forms of KIR2DL1 and KIR2DL3 to several peptide-HLA-Cw7 complexes. KIR2DL3 bound to the HLA-Cw7 allele presenting the peptide RYRPGTVAL with a 1:1 stoichiometry and an affinity (K(d) approximately 7 microM at 25 degrees C) within the range of values measured for other cell-cell recognition molecules, including the TCR. Although KIR2DL1 is reported not to recognize the HLA-Cw7 allele in functional assays, it bound RYRPGTVAL/HLA-Cw7, albeit with a 10-20-fold lower affinity. TCR/peptide-MHC interactions are characterized by comparatively slow kinetics and unfavorable entropic changes (Willcox, B. E., Gao, G. F., Wyer, J. R. , Ladbury, J. E., Bell, J. I., Jakobsen, B. K., and van der Merwe, P. A. (1999) Immunity 10, 357-365), suggesting that binding is accompanied by conformational adjustments. In contrast, we show that KIR2DL3 binds RYRPGTVAL/HLA-Cw7 with fast kinetics and a favorable binding entropy, consistent with rigid body association. These results indicate that KIR/peptide-MHC class I interactions have properties typical of other cell-cell recognition molecules, and they highlight the unusual nature of TCR/peptide-MHC recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2157805702,"Phagocytosis and killing of microbial pathogens by professional phagocytes is an essential component of the innate immune response. Recently, heterologous transfection of individual receptors into nonmyeloid cells has been used successfully to elucidate the early steps that signal phagosome formation. It is unclear, however, whether the vacuoles formed by such transfected cells are bona fide phagosomes, capable of fusion with endomembranes, of luminal acidification, and of controlling the growth of microorganisms. The aim of the current study was to determine whether COS-1 and Chinese hamster ovary cells, rendered phagocytic by expression of human FcÎ³RIIA receptors, express the cellular machinery required to support phagosomal maturation. Immunolocalization studies demonstrated that early endosomes, as well as late endosomes and/or lysosomes, fuse sequentially with phagosomes in the transfectants. Microfluorescence ratio imaging of particles labeled with pH-sensitive dyes revealed that maturation of the phagosome was accompanied by luminal acidification. The drop in pH, which attained levels comparable to those reported in professional phagocytes, was prevented by inhibitors of vacuolar-type H+-ATPases. Optimal phagosomal acidification required elevation of cytosolic [Ca2+], suggesting that it results from fusion of endomembranes bearing proton pumps. Moreover, the transfected cells effectively internalized live bacteria. Opsonization was essential for bacterial internalization, implying that it occurred by FcÎ³RIIA-mediated phagocytosis, as opposed to invasion. Uptake into phagolysosomes was associated with inhibition of bacterial growth, due at least in part to the low intraphagosomal pH. These studies indicate that the biochemical events that follow receptor-mediated particle internalization in cells transfected with FcÎ³RIIA receptors closely resemble the process of phagosomal maturation in neutrophils and macrophages.

Microbes are taken up into a phagocytic vacuole, which matures upon fusion with endomembrane compartments including endosomes and lysosomes (4Gabay J.E. Horwitz M.A. Cohn Z.A. Biochem. Soc.

These serum factors, known as opsonins, are recognized by receptors on the phagocyte cell membrane, such as the complement receptor 3 and immunoglobulin Fc receptors. Recent studies have begun to elucidate the signaling pathways involved in this complex series of events (for reviews, see Refs. 3Allen L.A. Aderem A. Curr. Opin.

These events are associated with the formation of an actin-rich cup encircling the nascent phagosome, leading to internalization of the particle (3Allen L.A. Aderem A. Curr. Opin.

Not only are both complement and Fc receptors present in neutrophils and macrophages, but several different members of the Fc receptor family co-exist in these cells. To overcome this difficulty, several laboratories have opted to express individual, well defined receptors in nonphagocytic cells, which are devoid of endogenous opsonin receptors (10Indik Z.K. Park J. Hunter S. Schreiber A.D. Blood. 1995; 86: 4389-4399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Greenberg S. Chang P. Wang D.C. Xavier R. Seed B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Remarkably, heterologous expression of single subtypes of Fc receptors, such as the FcÎ³RIIA receptor, suffices to induce effective internalization of IgG-opsonized particles (10Indik Z.K. Park J. Hunter S. Schreiber A.D. Blood. 1995; 86: 4389-4399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Such heterologous models are attractive not only because they afford analysis of individual receptors but also because the cells used for expression are more amenable to transfection than natural phagocytes. This facilitates the introduction of cDNAs encoding other molecules of interest, and this model can be used to study multiple aspects of phagosomal formation, maturation, and bactericidal activity. To date, however, the use of heterologous expression systems has been limited to the analysis of the early steps in the signaling cascade (10Indik Z.K. Park J. Hunter S. Schreiber A.D.

It is not clear whether such phagosomes undergo a maturation process that resembles that reported for professional phagocytes.The aim of the current study was to determine whether nonmyeloid cells, rendered phagocytic by expression of FcÎ³ receptors, possess the cellular machinery required for phagosomal maturation. Immunofluorescence was used to monitor the interaction between endomembrane compartments and the nascent phagosome in COS-1 and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) 1The abbreviations used are:CHOChinese hamster ovaryBAPTA1,2-bis(aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,Nâ²,Nâ²-tetraacetic acidBCECF2â²,7â²-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluoresceinFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateLAMPlysosome-associated membrane proteinPBSphosphate-buffered salinepHccytosolic pHpHpphagosomal pHRBCred blood cellsTfntransferrinV-ATPasevacuolar-type H+-ATPaseITAMimmunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif 1The abbreviations used are:CHOChinese hamster ovaryBAPTA1,2-bis(aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,Nâ²,Nâ²-tetraacetic acidBCECF2â²,7â²-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluoresceinFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateLAMPlysosome-associated membrane proteinPBSphosphate-buffered salinepHccytosolic pHpHpphagosomal pHRBCred blood cellsTfntransferrinV-ATPasevacuolar-type H+-ATPaseITAMimmunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif cells transfected with human FcÎ³RIIA. In addition, microfluorescence ratio imaging of zymosan particles labeled with pH-sensitive dyes was used to study the development of phagosomal acidification.DISCUSSIONThe goal of this study was to determine whether nonmyeloid cells, rendered phagocytic by expression of human FcÎ³ receptors, possessed the cellular machinery that would allow functional maturation of the phagosome. Our data demonstrate that not only can such cells internalize opsonized particles rapidly and efficiently in a ligand-dependent manner but that the phagosome becomes progressively acidified by recruitment of V-ATPases from endomembrane compartments. Moreover, we observed that when actively dividingE. coli are internalized by this receptor-mediated pathway, they promptly cease to proliferate. Failure of the bacteria to grow within the transfected cells was not due to opsonization or to the phagocytic process itself, because E. coli released from phagosomes shortly after internalization proliferated actively in suspension. Instead, it is likely that the conditions generated within the phagosome upon fusion with lysosomes limit the growth of the bacteria. Lysosomal hydrolases and the low luminal pH probably contribute to this effect.Fc receptors were shown earlier to modify the fate of intracellular vacuoles that encapsulate invading Toxoplasma. This microorganism generates a parasitophorous vacuole that neither fuses with lysosomes nor becomes acidic (24Joiner K.A. Fuhrman S.A. Miettinen H.M. Kasper L.H. Mellman I. Science. 1990; 249: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). When the vacuole contains active FcÎ³RIIB1 or B2 receptors, fusion with lysosomes and acidification develop (24Joiner K.A.

Importantly, unlike FcÎ³RIIA, the B1 and B2 isoforms are unable to trigger phagocytosis of IgG-coated inert particles, such as RBC (10Indik Z.K. Park J. Hunter S. Schreiber A.D. Blood. 1995; 86: 4389-4399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Poo H. Krauss J.C. Todd III R.F. Petty H.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 597-603PubMed Google Scholar, 41Lowry M.B. Duchemin A.M. Robinson J.M.

This implies that signals generated by interaction of Toxoplasma with other cellular components are required for FcÎ³RIIB1 or B2-induced phagosomal formation and maturation. In contrast, cross-linking of FcÎ³RIIA suffices to induce phagosome formation (25Indik Z. Kelly C. Chien P. Levinson A.I. Schreiber A.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1766-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and to trigger its fusion with endosomes and lysosomes. This differential behavior has been attributed to the presence of an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) or ITAM-like sequence in the cytoplasmic tail of FcÎ³RIIA receptors. Such an ITAM-like sequence is not present in human FcÎ³RIIB1 or B2 (42Isakov N. Immunol. Res. 1997; 16: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 43Clynes R. Maizes J.S. Guinamard R. Ono M.

Concomitant phosphorylation of both ITAM tyrosine residues of FcÎ³RIIA is thought to promote the attachment and subsequent activation of p72syk via its dual SH2 domains (12Greenberg S. Chang P.

Biol. 1998; 18: 4209-4220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clustering of p72syk is in turn sufficient to promote phagocytosis (13Greenberg S. Chang P. Wang D.C. Xavier R. Seed B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1103-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and failure to activate this kinase may account for the inability of FcÎ³RIIB1 and B2 to initiate phagocytosis. It is likely that signals other than the activation of p72syk must contribute to phagosomal maturation, inasmuch as FcÎ³RIIB1 and B2 facilitate lysosomal fusion and acidification, at least in the case of Toxoplasma-induced vacuoles (24Joiner K.A. Fuhrman S.A. Miettinen H.M. Kasper L.H. Mellman I. Science. 1990; 249: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar).As in the case of macrophages, phagosomes formed by IgG-opsonized particles in FcÎ³RIIA-transfected cells fused sequentially with early endosomes and subsequently with late endosomes and lysosomes (Fig. 7). The resulting phagolysosomes acidified to levels comparable to those reported in macrophages (48Hackam D.J. Rotstein O.D. Zhang W. Gruenheid S. Gros P. Grinstein S. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 351-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 49Sturgill-Koszycki S. Schlesinger P.H. Chakraborty P. Haddix P.L. Collins H.L. Fok A.K. Allen R.D. Gluck S.L. Heuser J. Russell D.G. Science. 1994; 263: 678-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). The acidification was reduced but not eliminated by chelation of intracellular calcium or by depletion of intracellular calcium stores. In this regard, the transfected cells resemble neutrophils, in which prevention of calcium transients inhibits phago-lysosomal fusion (19Jaconi M.E. Lew D.P. Carpentier J.L. Magnusson K.E. Sjogren M. Stendahl O. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1555-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), but they differ from macrophages, in which no effect was noted (37Zimmerli S. Majeed M. Gustavsson M. Stendahl O. Sanan D.A. Ernst J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). It remains unclear whether these two closely related cell types utilize fundamentally different fusion mechanisms, or whether methodological differences account for the apparent discrepancies. It is noteworthy, in this regard, that fusion systems heretofore thought to be calcium-independent are being found to require the divalent cation (50Peters C. Mayer A. Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 51Lee M.A. Dunn R.C. Clapham D.E. Stehno-Bittel L. Cell Calcium. 1998; 23: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The calcium change occurs rapidly in a localized juxtamembrane region and can only be abrogated using high concentrations of rapid chelating agents (50Peters C. Mayer A. Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 51Lee M.A. Dunn R.C. Clapham D.E. Stehno-Bittel L. Cell Calcium. 1998; 23: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It is therefore conceivable that a requirement for calcium transients may have been overlooked in some macrophage studies.In macrophages, fusion of phagosomes with lysosomes has also been reported to be disrupted by agents and conditions that dissipate intraorganellar acidification (39D'Arcy Hart P. Young M.R. Jordan M.M. Geisow M.J. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 158: 477-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, no such inhibition was detected in the transfected cells. This may point to a fundamental difference in the underlying fusion mechanism, but it may alternatively reflect secondary effects of the procedures used to dissipate the acidification. In our experiments, the formation of a pH gradient was prevented by inhibition of the V-ATPase, whereas in previous studies, weak bases or ionophores were used. In the presence of an active ATPase, the earlier methods lead to progressive swelling of phagosomes and other acidic organelles and can even produce ATP depletion. These effects are not expected to occur in bafilomycin or concanamycin-treated cells. The method used herein is more conservative, and therefore, the role of pH in phagosome to lysosome fusion in leukocytes warrants reconsideration.In summary, transfection of FcÎ³RIIA into nonmyeloid cells was observed to reconstitute not only particle internalization but also phagosomal maturation and acidification. Such reconstituted phagolysosomes are capable of limiting the growth of internalized microorganisms. Additional microbicidal mechanisms of professional phagocytes, such as the respiratory burst oxidase and pore-forming peptides like the defensins are lacking in the FcÎ³RIIA receptor-expressing cells, and they could potentially be co-transfected to evaluate their individual contribution to bacterial killing. The present findings, therefore, further extend the use of FcÎ³ receptor transfection systems for the study of the biology of phagocytosis. Phagocytosis of invading microorganisms by leukocytes represents a vital component of host defense against infection (1Brown E.J.

Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Microbes are taken up into a phagocytic vacuole, which matures upon fusion with endomembrane compartments including endosomes and lysosomes (4Gabay J.E. Horwitz M.A. Cohn Z.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1986; 14: 256-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 5Desjardins M. Celis J.E. van Meer G. Dieplinger H. Jahraus A. Griffiths G. Huber L.A. J. Biol.

Transfer of soluble and membrane-associated components from these compartments confers microbicidal activity to the phagosome (7Hampton M.B. Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Blood. 1998; 92: 3007-3017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The initial steps of the phagocytic sequence involve recognition and binding of microbial pathogens, a process enhanced by soluble components of serum, including complement fragments and immunoglobulins. These serum factors, known as opsonins, are recognized by receptors on the phagocyte cell membrane, such as the complement receptor 3 and immunoglobulin Fc receptors. Recent studies have begun to elucidate the signaling pathways involved in this complex series of events (for reviews, see Refs. 3Allen L.A. Aderem A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar and 8Swanson J.A. Baer S.C. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 89-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 9Greenberg S.

Binding of antibody-opsonized particles to the phagocyte surface initiates activation of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases of the Src family and of p72syk that are important for the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues within the Fc receptor complex (11Greenberg S. Chang P. Silverstein S.C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 12Greenberg S. Chang P. Silverstein S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3897-3902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Spatial grouping (âclusteringâ) of p72syk appears to be a key step in the early phase of phagocytosis (13Greenberg S. Chang P. Wang D.C. Xavier R. Seed B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1103-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and is accompanied by an accumulation of additional phosphorylated proteins in the vicinity of the phagocytic particle, resulting in activation of Ser/Thr (14Suchard S.J.

Science. 1991; 254: 1785-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). These events are associated with the formation of an actin-rich cup encircling the nascent phagosome, leading to internalization of the particle (3Allen L.A. Aderem A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 21Greenberg S. Burridge K. Silverstein S.C. J. Exp.

Definition of the detailed molecular mechanisms triggered by individual receptors is complicated by the co-expression of multiple receptor types in phagocytes. Not only are both complement and Fc receptors present in neutrophils and macrophages, but several different members of the Fc receptor family co-exist in these cells. To overcome this difficulty, several laboratories have opted to express individual, well defined receptors in nonphagocytic cells, which are devoid of endogenous opsonin receptors (10Indik Z.K. Park J. Hunter S. Schreiber A.D. Blood. 1995; 86: 4389-4399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Greenberg S. Chang P. Wang D.C. Xavier R. Seed B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 24513-24520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Remarkably, heterologous expression of single subtypes of Fc receptors, such as the FcÎ³RIIA receptor, suffices to induce effective internalization of IgG-opsonized particles (10Indik Z.K. Park J. Hunter S. Schreiber A.D. Blood. 1995; 86: 4389-4399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such heterologous models are attractive not only because they afford analysis of individual receptors but also because the cells used for expression are more amenable to transfection than natural phagocytes. This facilitates the introduction of cDNAs encoding other molecules of interest, and this model can be used to study multiple aspects of phagosomal formation, maturation, and bactericidal activity. To date, however, the use of heterologous expression systems has been limited to the analysis of the early steps in the signaling cascade (10Indik Z.K. Park J. Hunter S. Schreiber A.D. Blood. 1995; 86: 4389-4399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Odin J.A. Edberg J.C. Painter C.J. Kimberley R.P. Unkeless J.C.

Science. 1990; 249: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). This is due, in part, to the fact that the fate of phagosomes in cells transfected with opsonin receptors is not known. It is not clear whether such phagosomes undergo a maturation process that resembles that reported for professional phagocytes. The aim of the current study was to determine whether nonmyeloid cells, rendered phagocytic by expression of FcÎ³ receptors, possess the cellular machinery required for phagosomal maturation. Immunofluorescence was used to monitor the interaction between endomembrane compartments and the nascent phagosome in COS-1 and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) 1The abbreviations used are:CHOChinese hamster ovaryBAPTA1,2-bis(aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,Nâ²,Nâ²-tetraacetic acidBCECF2â²,7â²-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluoresceinFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateLAMPlysosome-associated membrane proteinPBSphosphate-buffered salinepHccytosolic pHpHpphagosomal pHRBCred blood cellsTfntransferrinV-ATPasevacuolar-type H+-ATPaseITAMimmunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif 1The abbreviations used are:CHOChinese hamster ovaryBAPTA1,2-bis(aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,Nâ²,Nâ²-tetraacetic acidBCECF2â²,7â²-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluoresceinFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateLAMPlysosome-associated membrane proteinPBSphosphate-buffered salinepHccytosolic pHpHpphagosomal pHRBCred blood cellsTfntransferrinV-ATPasevacuolar-type H+-ATPaseITAMimmunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif cells transfected with human FcÎ³RIIA.

Our data demonstrate that not only can such cells internalize opsonized particles rapidly and efficiently in a ligand-dependent manner but that the phagosome becomes progressively acidified by recruitment of V-ATPases from endomembrane compartments. Moreover, we observed that when actively dividingE. coli are internalized by this receptor-mediated pathway, they promptly cease to proliferate. Failure of the bacteria to grow within the transfected cells was not due to opsonization or to the phagocytic process itself, because E. coli released from phagosomes shortly after internalization proliferated actively in suspension. Instead, it is likely that the conditions generated within the phagosome upon fusion with lysosomes limit the growth of the bacteria. Lysosomal hydrolases and the low luminal pH probably contribute to this effect.Fc receptors were shown earlier to modify the fate of intracellular vacuoles that encapsulate invading Toxoplasma. This microorganism generates a parasitophorous vacuole that neither fuses with lysosomes nor becomes acidic (24Joiner K.A. Fuhrman S.A. Miettinen H.M. Kasper L.H. Mellman I. Science. 1990; 249: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). When the vacuole contains active FcÎ³RIIB1 or B2 receptors, fusion with lysosomes and acidification develop (24Joiner K.A. Fuhrman S.A. Miettinen H.M. Kasper L.H. Mellman I. Science. 1990; 249: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar).

Fuhrman S.A. Miettinen H.M. Kasper L.H. Mellman I. Science. 1990; 249: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Importantly, unlike FcÎ³RIIA, the B1 and B2 isoforms are unable to trigger phagocytosis of IgG-coated inert particles, such as RBC (10Indik Z.K. Park J. Hunter S. Schreiber A.D. Blood. 1995; 86: 4389-4399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Poo H. Krauss J.C. Todd III R.F. Petty H.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 597-603PubMed Google Scholar, 41Lowry M.B. Duchemin A.M. Robinson J.M. Anderson C.L. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 161-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This implies that signals generated by interaction of Toxoplasma with other cellular components are required for FcÎ³RIIB1 or B2-induced phagosomal formation and maturation. In contrast, cross-linking of FcÎ³RIIA suffices to induce phagosome formation (25Indik Z. Kelly C. Chien P. Levinson A.I. Schreiber A.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1766-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and to trigger its fusion with endosomes and lysosomes. This differential behavior has been attributed to the presence of an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) or ITAM-like sequence in the cytoplasmic tail of FcÎ³RIIA receptors. Such an ITAM-like sequence is not present in human FcÎ³RIIB1 or B2 (42Isakov N. Immunol. Res. 1997; 16: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 43Clynes R. Maizes J.S. Guinamard R. Ono M. Takai T. Ravetch J.V. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 44Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3281-3285PubMed Google Scholar, 45Isakov N. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Concomitant phosphorylation of both ITAM tyrosine residues of FcÎ³RIIA is thought to promote the attachment and subsequent activation of p72syk via its dual SH2 domains (12Greenberg S. Chang P. Silverstein S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3897-3902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Indik Z.K. Park J.G. Pan X.Q. Schreiber A.D.

Biol. 1998; 18: 4209-4220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clustering of p72syk is in turn sufficient to promote phagocytosis (13Greenberg S. Chang P. Wang D.C. Xavier R. Seed B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1103-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and failure to activate this kinase may account for the inability of FcÎ³RIIB1 and B2 to initiate phagocytosis. It is likely that signals other than the activation of p72syk must contribute to phagosomal maturation, inasmuch as FcÎ³RIIB1 and B2 facilitate lysosomal fusion and acidification, at least in the case of Toxoplasma-induced vacuoles (24Joiner K.A. Fuhrman S.A. Miettinen H.M. Kasper L.H. Mellman I. Science. 1990; 249: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). As in the case of macrophages, phagosomes formed by IgG-opsonized particles in FcÎ³RIIA-transfected cells fused sequentially with early endosomes and subsequently with late endosomes and lysosomes (Fig. 7). The resulting phagolysosomes acidified to levels comparable to those reported in macrophages (48Hackam D.J. Rotstein O.D. Zhang W. Gruenheid S. Gros P. Grinstein S. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 351-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 49Sturgill-Koszycki S. Schlesinger P.H. Chakraborty P. Haddix P.L. Collins H.L. Fok A.K. Allen R.D. Gluck S.L. Heuser J. Russell D.G. Science. 1994; 263: 678-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). The acidification was reduced but not eliminated by chelation of intracellular calcium or by depletion of intracellular calcium stores. In this regard, the transfected cells resemble neutrophils, in which prevention of calcium transients inhibits phago-lysosomal fusion (19Jaconi M.E. Lew D.P. Carpentier J.L. Magnusson K.E. Sjogren M. Stendahl O. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1555-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), but they differ from macrophages, in which no effect was noted (37Zimmerli S. Majeed M. Gustavsson M. Stendahl O. Sanan D.A. Ernst J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). It remains unclear whether these two closely related cell types utilize fundamentally different fusion mechanisms, or whether methodological differences account for the apparent discrepancies. It is noteworthy, in this regard, that fusion systems heretofore thought to be calcium-independent are being found to require the divalent cation (50Peters C. Mayer A. Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 51Lee M.A. Dunn R.C. Clapham D.E. Stehno-Bittel L. Cell Calcium. 1998; 23: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The calcium change occurs rapidly in a localized juxtamembrane region and can only be abrogated using high concentrations of rapid chelating agents (50Peters C. Mayer A. Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 51Lee M.A. Dunn R.C. Clapham D.E. Stehno-Bittel L. Cell Calcium. 1998; 23: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It is therefore conceivable that a requirement for calcium transients may have been overlooked in some macrophage studies. In macrophages, fusion of phagosomes with lysosomes has also been reported to be disrupted by agents and conditions that dissipate intraorganellar acidification (39D'Arcy Hart P. Young M.R. Jordan M.M. Geisow M.J. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 158: 477-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, no such inhibition was detected in the transfected cells. This may point to a fundamental difference in the underlying fusion mechanism, but it may alternatively reflect secondary effects of the procedures used to dissipate the acidification. In our experiments, the formation of a pH gradient was prevented by inhibition of the V-ATPase, whereas in previous studies, weak bases or ionophores were used. In the presence of an active ATPase, the earlier methods lead to progressive swelling of phagosomes and other acidic organelles and can even produce ATP depletion. These effects are not expected to occur in bafilomycin or concanamycin-treated cells. The method used herein is more conservative, and therefore, the role of pH in phagosome to lysosome fusion in leukocytes warrants reconsideration. In summary, transfection of FcÎ³RIIA into nonmyeloid cells was observed to reconstitute not only particle internalization but also phagosomal maturation and acidification. Such reconstituted phagolysosomes are capable of limiting the growth of internalized microorganisms. Additional microbicidal mechanisms of professional phagocytes, such as the respiratory burst oxidase and pore-forming peptides like the defensins are lacking in the FcÎ³RIIA receptor-expressing cells, and they could potentially be co-transfected to evaluate their individual contribution to bacterial killing. The present findings, therefore, further extend the use of FcÎ³ receptor transfection systems for the study of the biology of phagocytosis."

Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar). Because the major site of FAK autophosphorylation, Tyr397, is potentially a high affinity binding site for the SH2 domain of Src, phosphorylation of this site could facilitate the formation of a FAK-Src signaling complex in which both kinases are active (35Parsons J.T. Parsons S.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 51Hanks S.K. Polte T.R. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). However, FAK tyrosine phosphorylation is not sufficient for FAK/Src association, indicating the requirement for additional signals (52Schlaepfer D.D. Jones K.C. Hunter T. Mol. Cell.

In contrast, little is known about the assembly of FAK signaling complexes in response to physiological concentrations of GPCR agonists in attached cells.In the present study, we demonstrate that the mitogenic GPCR agonists bombesin, endothelin, bradykinin, and LPA induce a rapid increase in the formation of FAK-Src complexes in quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells. Bombesin stimulates FAK/Src association through a Ca2+ and PI 3-kinase-independent pathway that requires the integrity of the actin filament network and is partly dependent on functional PKC. In contrast, PDGF stimulates biphasic FAK/Src association via a PI 3-kinase-dependent pathway. Thus, GPCRs and tyrosine kinase receptors promote complex formation between endogenous FAK and Src in attached cells through different signal transduction pathways.DISCUSSIONThe results presented here demonstrate that stimulation with bombesin, other GPCR agonists (endothelin, bradykinin, and LPA), and PDGF promotes the formation of FAK-Src complexes in Swiss 3T3 cells. Association of Src with phosphorylated FAK has been demonstrated previously in v-Src-transformed cells and in cells replated on fibronectin-coated dishes, an assay of integrin receptor activation (54Xing Z.

Our results show that bombesin, at nanomolar concentrations, induced complex formation between endogenous FAK and Src in attached cells i.e. without overexpressing any of these components and without subjecting the cells to detachment and subsequent replating.The kinase activity of Src kinase family members (such as Src, Yes, and Fyn) is repressed when a key tyrosine residue in the carboxyl-terminal region (corresponding to Tyr527 of the chicken protein) is phosphorylated by Csk (reviewed in Ref. 50Pawson T.

Phosphorylation at Tyr527 creates a binding site for Src SH2 domain and allows an intramolecular interaction that locks Src in an inactive conformation. Our previous results demonstrated that bombesin induces a very rapid (peaking at 30â40 s) and transient activation of Src in Swiss 3T3 cells (24RodrÄ±Ìguez-FernaÌndez J.L. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27895-27901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) probably via dephosphorylation of Tyr527 by a tyrosine phosphatase. Src activity returned to base line levels after 2 min of incubation (24RodrÄ±Ìguez-FernaÌndez J.L. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27895-27901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In contrast, the results presented here demonstrate that complexes between Src and FAK persisted for at least 30 min. Given that competition for the SH2 and/or SH3 domains of Src by high affinity allosteric ligands is an alternative mechanism that promotes enzymatic activation of this kinase (50Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar, 76Thomas J.W. Ellis B. Boerner R.J. Knight W.B. White G.C., II Schaller M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 577-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), the association of Src to FAK would lead to the formation of a molecular complex in which Src kinases are active. Taken together, our results suggest that GPCR agonists induce Src activation via at least two different mechanisms in Swiss 3T3 cells.Recently, we demonstrated that GPCR agonists including bombesin induce FAK activation (23RodrÄ±Ìguez-FernaÌndez J.L. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19321-19328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), but the precise mechanism by which GPCR agonists up-regulate FAK activity is not understood. Src associated to FAK is thought to phosphorylate FAK at additional sites including Tyr576 and Tyr577, which are located in the catalytic domain of FAK. The phosphorylation of these sites is required for maximal FAK activity in vitro (52Schlaepfer D.D. Jones K.C. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2571-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 64Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since bombesin stimulates complex formation between FAK and Src, we tested the hypothesis that Src mediates FAK transphosphorylation and activation in response to bombesin in intact cells. Our results show, for the first time, that bombesin induces phosphorylation of Tyr577of FAK and that the selective Src inhibitor PP-2, at a concentration that markedly reduced the phosphorylation of Tyr577, also attenuated FAK activation in response to bombesin. These findings suggest that Src mediates the increase in FAK activity induced by bombesin in intact Swiss 3T3 cells.Src plays a critical role in FAK signaling including migration and apoptosis (44Cary L.A. Chang J.F. Guan J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar), and FAK-Src complexes are implicated in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the adaptor proteins p130CASand paxillin (77Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that FAK-Src complex formation is under tight regulation (52Schlaepfer D.D. Jones K.C. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2571-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that FAK tyrosine phosphorylation is necessary but not sufficient for promoting the formation of FAK-Src complexes, suggesting the need for additional signals. For example, the kinetics of FAK tyrosine phosphorylation did not coincide with FAK-Src complex formation in bombesin-stimulated cells. Specifically, tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK was detectable within seconds and persisted longer than FAK/Src association. Furthermore, bombesin stimulated FAK tyrosine phosphorylation through a signal transduction pathway that is largely independent of PKC (e.g. Ref. 22Sinnett-Smith J. Zachary I. Valverde A.M. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14261-14268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 3 B). However, we show here that maximal FAK/Src association induced by bombesin requires a functional PKC pathway. These findings support the hypothesis that FAK tyrosine phosphorylation is not sufficient for triggering FAK/Src association and suggests that a PKC-dependent signaling pathway contributes to the formation of this complex.Agonist-mediated increase in FAK tyrosine phosphorylation is accompanied by profound alterations in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and in the assembly of focal adhesions (26Seufferlein T.

Treatment of the cells with cytochalasin D, which disrupts actin filaments, prevents the increase in FAK tyrosine phosphorylation in response to multiple agents, suggesting a mechanism involving the actin cytoskeleton and the focal adhesion plaques (22Sinnett-Smith J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9587-9596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In contrast, bombesin induces Src activation in cytochalasin D-treated cells, indicating that FAK and Src activation are mediated by different pathways (24RodrÄ±Ìguez-FernaÌndez J.L. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27895-27901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).Here we show that cytochalasin D profoundly inhibits FAK-Src complex formation induced by bombesin and other agonists. Previous studies demonstrated that treatment with cytochalasin D does not inhibit production of inositol phosphates, Ca2+ mobilization, and stimulation of PKC, Src, and p42MAPK/p44MAPKactivation in response to bombesin (22Sinnett-Smith J.

Thus, disruption of the actin cytoskeleton prevents FAK tyrosine phosphorylation, activation, and association with Src in a selective manner. These findings are consistent with a model in which FAK/Src association requires the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton and intact focal adhesion plaques.Our results demonstrate that PDGF induces a striking biphasic association between FAK and Src, with maximal effect at only 5 ng/ml. At higher concentrations of PDGF, complex formation between FAK and Src is dramatically reduced. Previous studies demonstrated that PDGF, at low concentrations, stimulates PI 3-kinase activity and causes accumulation of actin in membrane ruffles, while at high concentrations, PDGF induces actin disorganization (29Rankin S. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 704-710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase activity is required for PDGF-induced formation of membrane ruffles (69WennstroÌm S. Siegbahn A. Yokote K. Arvidsson A.K. Heldin C.H. Mori S. Claesson-Welsh L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 651-660PubMed Google Scholar) and for the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK (30Rankin S. Hooshmand-Rad R. Claesson-Welsh L. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7829-7834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 66Casamassima A. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9363-9370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the increase in complex formation between FAK and Src induced by PDGF requires functional PI 3-kinase and an intact actin cytoskeleton. We hypothesize that the stimulatory limb of the bell-shaped dose-response curve of PDGF-stimulated FAK/Src association is mediated by a PI 3-kinase-dependent pathway, whereas the inhibitory limb is caused by PDGF-induced disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Interestingly, bombesin does not increase the levels of phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate in Swiss 3T3 cells (72Nobes C.D. Hawkins P. Stephens L. Hall A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 225-233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and, accordingly, our results show that the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin did not prevent FAK/Src association promoted by this GPCR agonist. We conclude that there are PI 3-kinase-dependent and -independent pathways leading to FAK/Src association in the same cell.In conclusion, our results demonstrate that stimulation of Swiss 3T3 cells with bombesin, endothelin, bradykinin, LPA, and PDGF induces a rapid increase in the formation of a complex between FAK and Src. Bombesin stimulates FAK/Src association through a Ca2+- and PI 3-kinase-independent pathway that requires the integrity of the actin filament network and is partly dependent on functional PKC. In contrast, PDGF simulates biphasic FAK/Src association via a PI 3-kinase pathway. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that agonists of either GPCRs or tyrosine kinase receptors promote FAK/Src association in attached cells through different signal transduction pathways. Neuropeptides stimulate DNA synthesis and cell proliferation in cultured cells and are implicated as growth factors in a variety of fundamental processes including development, inflammation, tissue regeneration, and tumorigenesis (1Rozengurt E.

https://openalex.org/W2059019606,"A novel rabphilin-3-like gene, granuphilin, has been identified in pancreatic beta cells by comparing genes expressed in pancreatic alpha and beta cell lines using mRNA differential display. The domain structure of the protein products of the granuphilin gene contains an amino-terminal zinc-finger motif and carboxyl-terminal C2-domains, similar to that of the rabphilin-3 gene. There are two isoforms: the larger isoform, granuphilin-a, has two C2-domains, whereas the smaller one, granuphilin-b, contains only the first C2-domain. Granuphilin is specifically expressed in pancreatic beta cells and the pituitary gland, but not in pancreatic alpha cells, the adrenal gland, or other major organs such as the brain. A portion of granuphilin associates with insulin-containing dense-core granules, but not with synaptic-like microvesicles in beta cells. Thus, its distribution pattern presents a striking contrast with that of rabphilin-3, which associates with small synaptic vesicles in neurons. The first C2-domain of granuphilin binds phospholipids in a Ca2+-independent manner, whereas the second one does not. These distinctive characteristics of granuphilin suggest that it is not a simple counterpart of rabphilin-3 in endocrine cells and that it has a unique role in the regulated exocytosis of dense-core granules in endocrine tissues.

These distinctive characteristics of granuphilin suggest that it is not a simple counterpart of rabphilin-3 in endocrine cells and that it has a unique role in the regulated exocytosis of dense-core granules in endocrine tissues. A combination of genetics in yeast and biochemistry in animal cell-free systems has revealed basic molecular mechanisms of constitutive exocytosis (1Pryer N.K. Wuestehube L.J. Scheckman R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 471-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 2Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T. Science. 1996; 272: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). For its cells to adapt to changes in environments and to communicate with other cells, a multicellular organism further differentiates a regulated exocytosis that occurs only in the presence of secretagogues (3Kelly R.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 43-53Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). This pathway is highly developed in neuronal, endocrine, and exocrine cells, where neurotransmitters, hormones, and digestive enzymes are released by exocytosis in response to an intracellular Ca2+ signal generated by secretagogues. These cells must be equipped with specific machinery that permits them, for example, to sense the Ca2+ signal and then release their cargo and replenish the stored material. Biochemical studies of synaptic vesicles at the nerve terminal have identified a number of molecules possibly involved in these processes (4SuÌdhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar). A group of proteins with two C2-domains has drawn particular attention because this motif has biochemical properties that sense a Ca2+signal and then bind membranes through interaction with phospholipids (5SuÌdhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 379-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Furthermore, some C2-domains interact with other proteins in a Ca2+-dependent manner (5SuÌdhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 379-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). These C2-domain-containing molecules include synaptotagmins (5SuÌdhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 379-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), rabphilin-3 (6Shirataki H. Kaibuchi K. Sakoda T. Kishida S. Yamaguchi T. Wada K. Miyazaki M. Takai Y.

Nature. 1997; 388: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), although their precise functions remain elusive. Both neuron and endocrine cells contain at least two types of secretory vesicles (9Thomas-Reetz A.C. De Camilli P. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). One type of vesicle, the small synaptic vesicle (SSV) 1The abbreviations used are:SSVsmall synaptic vesicleSLMVsynaptic-like microvesicleLDCVlarge dense-core vesicleRT-PCRreverse transcription-polymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s)VAMPvesicle-associated membrane proteinMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineGSTglutathione S-transferase 1The abbreviations used are:SSVsmall synaptic vesicleSLMVsynaptic-like microvesicleLDCVlarge dense-core vesicleRT-PCRreverse transcription-polymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s)VAMPvesicle-associated membrane proteinMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineGSTglutathione S-transferase in neurons and the synaptic-like microvesicle (SLMV) in endocrine cells, releases classical neurotransmitters. These are relatively small and electron-lucent and cycle between the plasmalemma and the early endosome compartment. The other type of vesicle, the large dense-core vesicle (LDCV) or the secretory granule in neuroendocrine cells, mainly secretes polypeptides, although some of these in specific subpopulations secrete monoamines. These LDCVs directly form from thetrans-Golgi network and have an electron-dense core. The physiologic and pharmacologic properties of the membranes of the two types of vesicles differ. For example, LDCV exocytosis is triggered by the lower Ca2+ concentrations reached away from the sites of Ca2+ entry (3â30 Î¼m calcium for half-maximal stimulation for release), whereas SSV exocytosis is triggered by high Ca2+ concentrations close to the entry site (200 Î¼m) (10Martin T.F.J. Vitam. Horm. 1998; 54: 207-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The synaptic events occur as brief as 60 Î¼s after stimulation for SSVs, whereas the latency of LDCVs in neuroendocrine cells is 100 times longer (10Martin T.F.J. Vitam. Horm. 1998; 54: 207-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in motor nerve terminals, the exocytosis of acetylcholine-containing SSVs is sensitive to Î±-latrotoxin, the toxin of black widow spider venom, which does not affect the exocytosis of calcitonin gene-related peptide-containing LDCVs (11Matteoli M. Haimann C. Torri-Tarelli F. Polak J.M. Ceccarelli B. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7366-7370Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Thus, the secretory pathways of SSVs/SLMVs and LDCVs/granules are different. It is also likely that their protein compositions are at least partly distinct; however, due to their low abundance, there has been less biochemical characterization of LDCVs/granules. small synaptic vesicle synaptic-like microvesicle large dense-core vesicle reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction base pair(s) vesicle-associated membrane protein 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine glutathione S-transferase small synaptic vesicle synaptic-like microvesicle large dense-core vesicle reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction base pair(s) vesicle-associated membrane protein 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine glutathione S-transferase To analyze the molecular machinery of regulated exocytosis of LDCVs/granules, we studied pancreatic beta cells, which secrete insulin in response to blood glucose levels. Because beta cells are one of the most physiologically characterized endocrine cells and possess both insulin-containing dense-core granules and Î³-aminobutyric acid-containing SLMVs (12Reetz A. Solimena M. Matteoli M. Folli F. Takei K. De Camilli P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1275-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), they are a good model for dissecting both types of secretory vesicles. The limited number and anatomical position of beta cells, however, have hampered their biochemical analysis. Therefore, we attempted molecular characterization by analyzing the genes expressed in the cells. The expression levels of beta cell genes were then compared with those in closely related pancreatic alpha cells by mRNA differential display (13Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4675) Google Scholar), which resulted in the identification of several novel genes that are preferentially expressed in beta cells. 2J. Wang, T. Takeuchi, I. Hirayama, K. Hamaguchi, and T. Izumi, unpublished observations. 2J. Wang, T. Takeuchi, I. Hirayama, K. Hamaguchi, and T. Izumi, unpublished observations. In this study, one of these genes, granuphilin, was characterized. This gene encodes a protein whose domain structure is similar to that of rabphilin-3. Rabphilin-3 is specifically expressed in neurons, contains two C2-domains, and is thought to be involved in the regulated secretion of SSVs (6Shirataki H. Kaibuchi K. Sakoda T. Kishida S. Yamaguchi T. Wada K. Miyazaki M. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2061-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 14Li C. Takei K. Geppert M. Daniell L. Stenius K. Chapman E.R. Jahn R. De Camilli P. SuÌdhof T.C. Neuron. 1994; 13: 885-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Granuphilin, however, has a number of distinct characteristics compared with rabphilin-3: it is specifically expressed in pancreatic beta cells and in the pituitary, but not in other major organs such as the brain. Furthermore, it is associated with insulin-containing dense-core granules, but not with the SLMVs in beta cells. In addition to a difference in the distribution, other distinctive properties of granuphilin suggest that it is not a simple counterpart of rabphilin-3 in endocrine cells and that it has a unique role in the regulated exocytosis of dense-core granules in endocrine tissues. Pancreatic beta cell lines (Î²HC9 and MIN6) and an alpha cell line (Î±TC1.6) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum under 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 Â°C as described previously (15Hirayama I.

Tissues were immediately excised from 8â12-week-old C57BL/6J mice killed by cervical dislocation, frozen in a liquid nitrogen bath, and stored at â80 Â°C. Pancreatic islets were isolated as described previously (16Wang J. Takeuchi T. Tanaka S. Kubo S.-K. Kayo T. Lu D. Takata K. Koizumi A. Izumi T. J. Clin.

Total RNA from cell lines (80% confluent culture at a density of 1â2 Ã 107 cells/10-cm plate) and tissues was prepared as described previously (17Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). For Northern blotting, 20 Î¼g of total RNA was separated on a 1% agarose and 6.7% formaldehyde gel and transferred onto Hybond-N membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Radioactive probes were generated with [Î±-32P]dCTP (1000â3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the Rediprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), followed by centrifugation through Sephadex G-50 spin columns to remove unincorporated dNTPs.

Using one of the cDNA fragments preferentially expressed in Î²HC9 cells as a probe (DDBJ/GenBankTM/EBI accession number AB005756), granuphilin cDNAs were cloned from a Î²HC9/MIN6 cell cDNA library (15Hirayama I.

Sequencing was performed using an ABI PRISM cycle sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer). Total RNA (1 Î¼g) was reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT)17 primer as described previously (15Hirayama I. Tamemoto H. Yokota H. Kubo S.-K. Wang J. Kuwano H. Nagamachi Y. Takeuchi T. Izumi T. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1237-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The 5â²- and 3â²-primers used for PCR were derived from sequences flanking the granuphilin-a-specific region so that the sizes of PCR products from the two isoforms are discriminated. The 5â²-primer, 5â²-ACTTTCCTTGGAGAGGCGGA-3â², was combined with either of the 3â²-primers, 5â²-CATCATCTACCTTGATACCC-3â² or 5â²-CCCTGGGTACTGTCGCATCT-3â². The expected sizes of PCR products with the former 3â²-primer are 936 base pairs (bp) for granuphilin-a and 518 bp for granuphilin-b, and those with the latter 3â²-primer are 588 bp for granuphilin-a and 170 bp for granuphilin-b. PCR was carried out in 20 Î¼l of 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 200 Î¼m each dNTP, 1.5 units ofTaq DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany), 12.5 pmol of the 5â²- and 3â²-primers, and the RT mixture described above. Following incubation for 5 min at 94 Â°C for denaturation, the samples were incubated at 94 Â°C for 30 s, 56 Â°C for 30 s, and 72 Â°C for 1 min for 27 cycles. The products were resolved on 2% agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide. Rabbit antibodies against the carboxyl-terminal granuphilin-a peptide, CTLQLRSSMVKQKLGV, were produced as described previously (15Hirayama I. Tamemoto H. Yokota H. Kubo S.-K. Wang J. Kuwano H. Nagamachi Y. Takeuchi T. Izumi T. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1237-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Rabbit antibodies against vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)-2 (18Oho C. Seino S. Takahashi M. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 186: 208-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and synaptotagmin III (19Mizuta M. Kurose T. Miki T. Shoji-Kasai Y. Takahashi M. Seino S. Matsukura S. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 2002-2006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were gifts from Dr. M. Takahashi (Mitsubishi Kasei Institute of Life Sciences). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against synaptophysin (SY 38) and guinea pig anti-glucagon serum were purchased from Progen Biotechnik (Heidelberg, Germany) and Linco Research (St. Charles, MO), respectively. Guinea pig anti-porcine insulin serum was a gift from Drs. K. Wakabayashi and H. Kobayashi (Institute for Molecular and Cellular Regulation, Gunma University). Immunostaining on the mouse pancreas specimen was performed as described previously (15Hirayama I. Tamemoto H. Yokota H. Kubo S.-K. Wang J. Kuwano H. Nagamachi Y. Takeuchi T. Izumi T. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1237-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, proteins were solubilized in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and the following protease inhibitors: 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 Î¼g/ml each aprotinin, pepstatin A, and leupeptin. The supernatant of the whole-cell extract was prepared by sedimenting the insoluble material by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Immunoblotting was performed using enhanced chemiluminescent Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). SLMVs and dense-core granules were separated according to the method described previously (12Reetz A. Solimena M. Matteoli M. Folli F. Takei K. De Camilli P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1275-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), with modifications. Briefly, MIN6 cells (1â2 Ã 107 cells/10-cm plate) were resuspended in 1.5 ml of homogenization buffer (0.3 m sucrose, 20 mmMOPS, pH 7.0, and the protease inhibitors described above) and homogenized by 25 strokes with a Dounce glass homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 2500 Ã g for 15 min at 4 Â°C. The resultant post-nuclear supernatant was loaded on top of a continuous sucrose density gradient (0.45â2 m sucrose and 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0) and then centrifuged at 30,000 rpm for 15 h at 4 Â°C in an RPS40T rotor (Hitachi Koki, Katsuta, Japan). Fractions (870 Î¼l) were collected from the bottom of the gradient. The sucrose molarity of each fraction was determined by measuring its refractive index. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by immunoblotting. Immunoreactive insulin was extracted with acidic ethanol (sample/ethanol/concentrated HCl = 28.5:70:1.5) overnight at 4 Â°C. After sonication and centrifugation, the insulin was measured using anti-insulin antibodies as described previously (16Wang J. Takeuchi T. Tanaka S. Kubo S.-K. Kayo T. Lu D. Takata K. Koizumi A. Izumi T. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). This was performed according to the method described previously (19Mizuta M. Kurose T. Miki T. Shoji-Kasai Y. Takahashi M. Seino S. Matsukura S. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 2002-2006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the post-nuclear supernatant was prepared from five confluent 10-cm plates of MIN6 cells as described above with the addition of resuspension in 3 ml of homogenization buffer (0.3 msucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1% bovine serum albumin, and the protease inhibitors described above). A portion of the supernatant (0.6 ml) was incubated with the indicated antibodies at 4 Â°C for 2 h. The antibodies were then bound to protein G-Sepharose 4FF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 Â°C for 1 h with gentle rotation. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times with the homogenization buffer. Tricine/SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (20SchaÌgger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar) was used to detect small peptides such as insulin, and proteins were transferred onto an Immobilon-PSQ membrane (Millipore Corp.). Immunoblotting was then performed using anti-insulin antibodies. Two cDNA fragments of granuphilin-a encoding amino acids 315â502 and 487â673 that contained the first and second C2-domains, respectively, were amplified by PCR using a full-length granuphilin-a cDNA as a template. Amplified cDNA fragments were subcloned into pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A cDNA fragment encoding the first C2-domain of rat synaptotagmin I (amino acids 139â267), synthesized by RT-PCR using rat brain RNA as a template, was similarly fused to GST (21Davletov B.A. SuÌdhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26386-26390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified by affinity chromatography with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Preparation of3H-labeled liposomes and measurement of phospholipid binding were performed according to the methods described previously (21Davletov B.A. SuÌdhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26386-26390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All phospholipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Liposomes were made from 1.25 mg of phosphatidylcholine, 0.42 mg of phosphatidylserine, and 20 Î¼Ci of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-l-3-phosphatidyl[N-methyl-3H]choline (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). When indicated, phosphatidylserine was replaced by either phosphatidylinositol or phosphatidylethanolamine. Phospholipids dissolved in chloroform were mixed and dried under a stream of nitrogen gas. After resuspension in 5 ml of buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0.1 m NaCl) by vigorous shaking for 1 min, phospholipid suspensions were sonicated for 15 s and centrifuged at 10,000 Ã g for 10 min to remove aggregates. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube; 5 ml of buffer A was added; and then it was stored at 4 Â°C for as long as 1 month. The phospholipid binding assay contained 15 Î¼g of recombinant protein bound to 10 Î¼l of glutathione beads. Beads were prewashed twice with the respective test solutions and resuspended in 0.1 ml of buffer A containing 3H-labeled liposomes (â¼0.1 Î¼Ci/16.7 Î¼g of phospholipid) and 2 mm EGTA with or without the addition of 2.1 mm CaCl2. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min with vigorous shaking and then briefly centrifuged at 2200 rpm in a tabletop centrifuge. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of the incubation buffer without liposomes. After eluting the proteins with 250 Î¼l of buffer containing 1% SDS and 10 mm EDTA, liposome binding was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Although the pancreatic alpha and beta cells are developmentally very close, they have an opposite role in maintaining glucose homeostasis: the alpha cells secrete glucagon in response to a low glucose level, and the beta cells increase insulin secretion in response to a high glucose level. Therefore, there must exist fundamental differences in their glucose recognition and metabolism and in their regulation of peptide hormone secretion. A comparison of the genes expressed in the two cells may reveal the molecules involved in these processes. It is difficult to purify considerable amounts of these cells from islets, and so we instead used cultured alpha and beta cell lines (Î±TC1.6 and Î²HC9) derived from transgenic mice. Using mRNA differential display (13Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4675) Google Scholar), we identified several novel genes that are specifically or preferentially expressed in Î²HC9 cells.2 Molecular cloning of the full-length cDNAs revealed one novel gene, granuphilin, which encodes a protein whose domain structure is similar to that of rabphilin-3 (6Shirataki H. Kaibuchi K. Sakoda T. Kishida S. Yamaguchi T. Wada K. Miyazaki M. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2061-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Two isoforms were found among the multiple independent clones in the Î²HC9/MIN6 cDNA library. One (granuphilin-a) encodes a protein of 673 amino acids that has a zinc-finger motif at the N terminus and two C2-domains at the C terminus (Fig. 1). The other (granuphilin-b) lacks 418 nucleotides (from positions 1641 to 2058) of granuphilin-a, which causes a frameshift at residue 486, located between the two C2-domains of granuphilin-a, and generates a stop codon at residue 503. Thus, granuphilin-b is a protein of 502 amino acids and has only the first C2-domain of granuphilin-a and a different C-terminal sequence, GSVMAKWWTGWIRLVKK (Fig. 1). The calculated molecular mass and isoelectric point for granuphilin-a are 76,000 Da and 9.2, and those for granuphilin-b are 57,000 Da and 9.2, respectively. Despite the similarity of the domain structure, the overall identity of the amino acid sequences of granuphilin-a and rabphilin-3 only amounts to 22%. Rabphilin-3 is specifically localized on the synaptic vesicles at the nerve terminals and is associated with Rab3A through the N-terminal fragment containing the zinc-finger motif (14Li C. Takei K.

Although the amino acid conservation in the N-terminal regions of granuphilin and rabphilin-3 is only 31%, the distribution of cysteine residues in granuphilin (Fig. 1, boxed), CX2CX12â13CX2CX4CX2CX10â18CX2C, is similar to that in rabphilin-3 (6Shirataki H. Kaibuchi K. Sakoda T. Kishida S. Yamaguchi T. Wada K. Miyazaki M. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2061-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), RIM (8Wang Y. Okamoto M. Schmitz F. Hofmann K. SuÌdhof T.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), and FGD1 protein (23Pasteris N.G. Cadle A. Logie L.J. Porteous M.E.M. Schwartz C.E. Stevenson R.E. Glover T.W. Wilroy R.S. Gorski J.L. Cell. 1994; 79: 669-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), all of which bind small G proteins. Crystal structural analysis of the Rab3AÂ·rabphilin-3 complex has revealed that a deep pocket in Rab3A, called the Rab complementarity-determining region, directly interacts with an SGAWFF motif in rabphilin-3 (24Ostermeier C. Brunger A.T. Cell. 1999; 96: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Although the SGAWFF motif is conserved among other members of the rabphilin-3 family, including RIM (8Wang Y. Okamoto M. Schmitz F. Hofmann K. SuÌdhof T.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) and Noc2 (25Kotake K. Ozaki N. Mizuta M. Sekiya S. Inagaki N. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29407-29410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the corresponding sequence of granuphilin is distinct, TGDWFY (Fig. 1, boxed). Like rabphilin-3, there is a single stretch of glutamate residues between the zinc-finger motif and the first C2-domain, although its functional role remains unknown (Fig. 1, dashed underlining). The primary sequences within the C2-domains of granuphilin and rabphilin-3 also vary considerably (31% conservation). Particularly, the five aspartate residues participating in Ca2+ binding in the C2A-domain of synaptotagmin I (5SuÌdhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 379-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) are only partially conserved in the C2-domains of granuphilin (Fig. 1,asterisks). Tissue expression of granuphilin was examined. Northern blot analysis revealed that it was not expressed in major tissues such as the brain, kidney, liver, heart, muscle, and spleen (Fig.2 A). As expected from our finding using mRNA differential display (data not shown), it was specifically expressed in Î²HC9 cells, but not in Î±TC1.6 cells. The double bands of signals in Î²HC9 cells suggest that both granuphilin-a and -b are transcribed. This interpretation was further supported by RT-PCR analysis. The PCR products consisted of two discrete bands, whose sizes correspond to those expected for the two isoforms, in the pancreatic islets, Î²HC9 cells, and MIN6 cells (Fig. 2 B,lanes 2â4 and 7â9). In contrast, they were not found in either Î±TC1.6 cells or brain (Fig. 2 B,lanes 1, 5, 6, and 10). These results indicate that both isoforms are expressed in pancreatic beta cells. A polyclonal antibody was produced against the C-terminal peptide of granuphilin-a. In this study, the larger isoform, granuphilin-a, was further characterized using this antibody. Immunoblot analysis showed that the antibody recognized a single 78-kDa protein (the value of which is consistent with the calculated molecular mass of granuphilin-a) in the extracts of Î²HC9 cells (Fig. 2 C) and MIN6 cells (data not shown, but see Fig. 4 A). Consistent with the finding from the Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2 A), there were no immunoreactive proteins in either Î±TC1.6 cells or other major organs (Fig. 2 C). Among the endocrine tissues examined, granuphilin-a was most abundantly expressed in pancreatic islets. It was also expressed in the pituitary, but was not significantly expressed in the testis, ovary, and adrenal gland. This expression pattern is in striking contrast to that of rabphilin-3, which is specifically expressed in the brain, but is not expressed in endocrine tissues, except for the adrenal gland (6Shirataki H. Kaibuchi K. Sakoda T. Kishida S. Yamaguchi T. Wada K. Miyazaki M. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2061-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 26Inagaki N. Mizuta M. Seino S. J. Biochem.

Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2265-2273PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis in cultured cell lines suggests that granuphilin is expressed in pancreatic beta cells, but not in alpha cells. Transformed cell lines, however, may acquire properties different from those of the original progenitors, as in the case of the insulin receptor-related receptor, which is expressed in pancreatic alpha cells, but not in Î±TC1.6 cells (15Hirayama I.

Therefore, we performed immunohistochemical analysis directly on the mouse pancreas specimen. Granuphilin-a was highly expressed in the insulin-positive beta cells (Fig. 3, a, c, ande).

Sk-Tmod is 62% identical in amino acid sequence to the previously described chicken E-Tmod and is the product of a different gene. Sk-Tmod isoform sequences are highly conserved across vertebrates and constitute an independent group in the tropomodulin family. In vitro, chicken Sk-Tmod caps actin and tropomyosin-actin filament pointed ends to the same extent as does chicken E-Tmod. However, E- and Sk-Tmods differ in their tissue distribution; Sk-Tmod predominates in fast skeletal muscle fibers, lens, and erythrocytes, while E-Tmod is found in heart and slow skeletal muscle fibers. Additionally, their expression is developmentally regulated during chicken breast muscle differentiation with Sk-Tmod replacing E-Tmod after hatching. Finally, in skeletal muscle fibers that coexpress both Sk- and E-Tmod, they are recruited to different actin filament-containing cytoskeletal structures within the cell: myofibrils and costameres, respectively. All together, these observations support the hypothesis that vertebrates have acquired different tropomodulin isoforms that play distinct roles in vivo.

Full-Text PDF Open Access One of the most spectacular examples of cytoskeletal architecture found in cells is the sarcomere, the contractile unit of striated muscle. Antiparallel polarized actin filaments (thin filaments), bipolar myosin filaments (thick filaments), titin, and nebulin filaments interdigitate and interact with each other to create sarcomeres, which support the contraction of muscle cells (1Huxley H.E. Brachet J. Mirsky A.E. The Cell: Biochemistry, Physiology, Morphology. Vol. 4. Academic Press, New York1960: 365-481Google Scholar). Despite the similarity in the basic organization of the filaments in all sarcomeres, a closer examination reveals some important and interesting variations in sarcomeric architecture in different types of muscle. Most strikingly, while thick filament lengths are remarkably constant among different vertebrate muscles (2Allen E.R. Pepe F.A. Am. J. Anat. 1965; 116: 115-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 3Auber J. J. Microscopie. 1969; 8: 367-390Google Scholar, 4Fischman D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1967; 32: 557-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), thin filament lengths exhibit considerable variability among physiologically distinct types of muscles (for review, see Ref. 5Littlefield R. Fowler V.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 487-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). For example, in the rabbit psoas muscle, a fast twitch skeletal muscle, thin filament lengths fall into a narrow range of 1.11 Â± 0.03 Î¼m (6Sosa H. Popp D. Ouyang G. Huxley H.E. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In contrast, in rat cardiac atrial muscle, thin filament lengths vary from 0.6 to 1.1 Î¼m (7Robinson T.F. Winegrad S. J. Physiol. 1979; 286: 607-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Differences in thin filament length between fast and slow skeletal muscles have also been observed in the fish Perca fluviaris(8Granzier H.L. Akster H.A. Ter Keurs H.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C1060-C1070Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This variation in thin filament length can be an important determinant of the length-tension relationship during contraction and thus can influence the physiological properties of the muscles (i.e. cardiac, fast skeletal, and slow skeletal) (7Robinson T.F. Winegrad S. J. Physiol. 1979; 286: 607-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 8Granzier H.L. Akster H.A. Ter Keurs H.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C1060-C1070Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of variations in thin filament lengths are not yet understood. An excellent candidate for regulating the length of the thin filaments is tropomodulin, the capping protein for the thin filament pointed ends (5Littlefield R. Fowler V.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 487-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 9Fowler V.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 86-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). When embryonic chick cardiac myocytes are microinjected with an antibody that blocks tropomodulin's ability to cap actin filament pointed ends in vitro, actin elongates from the thin filament pointed ends (10Gregorio C.C. Weber A. Bondad M. Pennise C.R. Fowler V.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the cells are no longer able to beat, demonstrating that maintenance of thin filament length by tropomodulin is critical for normal contraction (10Gregorio C.C. Weber A. Bondad M. Pennise C.R. Fowler V.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The levels of tropomodulin also appear to be important for the stabilization and proper organization of thin filaments in myofibrils, based on results from studies employing sense and antisense erythrocyte tropomodulin (E-Tmod) 1The abbreviations used are:E-Tmoderythrocyte tropomodulinSk-Tmodskeletal tropomodulinmAbmonoclonal antibodyPMpectoralis majorBFbiceps femorisCAPS3-cyclohexylamino-1-propanesulfonic acidaaamino acidsESTexpressed sequence tagbpbase pair(s)kbkilobase(s)GSTglutathione S-transferaseN-Tmodneuronal tropomodulinUTRuntranslated region 1The abbreviations used are:E-Tmoderythrocyte tropomodulinSk-Tmodskeletal tropomodulinmAbmonoclonal antibodyPMpectoralis majorBFbiceps femorisCAPS3-cyclohexylamino-1-propanesulfonic acidaaamino acidsESTexpressed sequence tagbpbase pair(s)kbkilobase(s)GSTglutathione S-transferaseN-Tmodneuronal tropomodulinUTRuntranslated region mRNAs in adenovirus vectors in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes (11Sussman M.A. Baque S.

In this study, we have identified and cloned a novel tropomodulin isoform from vertebrates, Sk-Tmod, which is highly expressed in fast skeletal muscle and is not present in slow skeletal or cardiac muscle. The high conservation of Sk-Tmod sequences among vertebrates and its different tissue and subcellular distribution as compared with E-Tmod suggest that the Sk-Tmod isoform may be functionally distinct from the E-Tmod isoform. A panel of 19 monoclonal anti-tropomodulin antibodies were generated using recombinant chicken E-Tmod as an antigen (16Babcock G.G. Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27510-27518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Chris W. Grant, Custom Monoclonals, West Sacramento, CA). The antibodies were purified from the hybridoma culture supernatants over a Protein G-Sepharose fast performance liquid chromatography column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) and eluted with 0.2 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.8. The specificity of the antibodies was characterized by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, followed by Western blotting (see below) and by immunofluorescence. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 17, 23, and 47 recognize a single tropomodulin spot by Western blots in both heart and breast muscle (pectoralis major, PM) (Fig. 1, left panel). In contrast, mAbs 9 and 95 only recognize a tropomodulin spot in heart and none in breast muscle (PM) (Fig. 1, right panel). Mixing experiments demonstrate that tropomodulin spots from heart and breast muscle (PM) do not comigrate (Fig. 1, bottom left panel). By immunofluorescence, mAb 95 specifically recognizes E-Tmod, as demonstrated by staining of embryonic breast muscle myofibrils, which contain E-Tmod (17Almenar-Queralt A. Gregorio C.C. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1111-1123PubMed Google Scholar), and its inability to stain adult chicken breast muscle myofibrils, which contain Sk-Tmod (data not shown and see below). In contrast, although mAb 17 recognizes both E- and Sk-Tmod isoforms on Western blots, it preferentially recognizes Sk-Tmod by immunofluorescence since it does not stain E-Tmod in the myofibrils of embryonic breast muscle but stains the pointed ends of thin filaments in isolated myofibrils from adult chicken breast muscle, which contain Sk-Tmod (data not shown and see below). Polyclonal antibodies to recombinant chicken Sk-Tmod (see below) were generated in rabbits (R3577) and affinity-purified over a column of recombinant chicken Sk-Tmod coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (Sigma) by standard procedures. The monoclonal anti-sarcomeric Î±-actinin antibody (clone 9A2B8) (18Schultheiss T. Lin Z. Lu M.-H. Murray J. Fischman D.A. Weber K. Masaki T. Imamura M. Holtzer H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1159-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) was generously provided by Drs. S. and H. Holtzer (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). The monoclonal anti-chicken fast C-protein antibody (clone MF1) (19Reinach F.C. Masaki T. Shafiq S. Obinata T. Fischman D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) developed by Dr. D. A. Fischman was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank developed under the auspices of the NICHD and maintained by the University of Iowa, Department of Biological Sciences, Iowa City, IA 52242. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies generated against bovine brain Î±-spectrin were prepared as described previously (21Fowler V.M. Adam E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1559-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-mouse IgG + IgM was purchased from Pierce. Bodipy-labeled phallacidin, tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG, and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR), Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corp. (Westbury, NY), and Roche Molecular Biochemicals, respectively. Breast muscle (PM) from 12-day chicken embryos and breast, heart biceps femoris (BF), and posterior latissimus dorsi muscle from adult chickens (about 2 months old) were dissected and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline plus protease inhibitors (17Almenar-Queralt A. Gregorio C.C. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1111-1123PubMed Google Scholar). Muscles were minced and then homogenized in a Polytron homogenizer with 10 volumes of 9.2 m urea and 1% (v/v) 2-Î²-mercaptoethanol, and their tropomodulin isoform composition was characterized by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting (17Almenar-Queralt A. Gregorio C.C. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1111-1123PubMed Google Scholar). The migration position of muscle Î±-actin (stained with Ponceau S) was used as a positional marker to compare the mobility of tropomodulin isoforms electrophoresed on different gels. For comparison of tropomodulins from adult chicken PM, lens, and erythrocyte membranes, proteins were solubilized in 9.2 murea, 1% 2-Î²-mercaptoethanol, and 2% Nonidet P-40 to improve the resolution of the first dimension. Membranes were prepared from chicken erythrocytes according to Granger (22Granger B.L. Repasky E.A. Lazarides E. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 299-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Tropomodulin was immunoprecipitated from adult chicken lens extracts using rabbit polyclonal antibodies (R745) (20Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), as described previously for rat lenses (23Woo M.K. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1359-1367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prior to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, purified rabbit skeletal muscle Î±-actin was added to the immunoprecipitated lens tropomodulin and the erythrocyte membrane samples so that the mobility of tropomodulin in the erythrocytes and lens could be compared with that of the other muscle tissues. Tropomodulin from adult chicken breast muscle was immunoprecipitated as described (24Fowler V.M. Sussmann M.A. Miller P.G. Flucher B.E. Daniels M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) using anti-tropomodulin mAb 17. Samples were electrophoresed on 7.5â15% acrylamide linear gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels at pH 9.1 (20Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar), and polypeptides were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (0.45 Î¼m; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) in CAPS buffer (10 mm CAPS, pH 11, 10% methanol). The membrane was stained briefly in 0.1% Ponceau S in 1% acetic acid and the region of the membrane containing the tropomodulin band was excised and subjected to tryptic digestion and microsequencing. The sequences of four peptides were obtained (Dr. John Leszyk, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Shrewsbury, MA) (underlined sequences in Fig. 2). Degenerate primers to amplify Sk-Tmod cDNA were designed based on the peptides TLQSLNIESNFITSAGMMSVIK and YKPVPDEPPNPTNVEETLR (see below, Fig. 2). These primers were used to amplify a 300-bp cDNA fragment by polymerase chain reaction using Taq polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI) from a Î»Zap adult chicken skeletal muscle cDNA library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). This fragment was labeled with [Î±-32P]dCTP using a Random Primer kit (Stratagene) and then used to screen the same library. Approximately 1 Ã 106 colonies were screened, and phage containing putative Sk-Tmod cDNAs were isolated following the manufacturer's instructions. Clones were analyzed by restriction mapping, and selected clones were sequenced to identify overlapping fragments from the same cDNA sequence. Both strands from two of the longest clones (1.3 kb) were sequenced. The available tropomodulin sequences at GenBank together with the new chicken Sk-Tmod cDNA sequence reported in this study, were used to screen the expressed sequence tag data base (dbEST). A number of overlapping ESTs from human, mouse, and zebrafish were identified that showed higher levels of sequence similarity to the chicken Sk-Tmod than to any other tropomodulin sequences. To determine the cDNA sequences of clones corresponding to these ESTs, several cDNA clones were obtained from the IMAGE Consortium clone collection (Genome Systems, St. Louis, MO) and sequenced. The longest mouse cDNA corresponded to amino acids 63â348 of chicken Sk-Tmod with a 95-bp 3â²-UTR and the longest human cDNA corresponded to amino acids 20â348 together with a 122-bp 3â²-UTR. The complete coding sequence of the human Sk-Tmod was reconstructed from the sequences of five additional human ESTs, which overlapped by 200â500 bp with the 1.1-kb human Sk-Tmod cDNA sequence and extended â¼120 bp upstream to nucleotide â66 before the start codon. A zebrafish cDNA clone was also purchased from Genome Systems (St. Louis, MO), and it contained an apparently full-length Sk-Tmod cDNA of 1.4 kb with 5â²- and 3â²-UTRs of 62 and 328 bp, respectively, and encoded a protein of 343 amino acids. For construction of the phylogenetic trees, the available â¼40-kDa tropomodulin sequences from GenBank, the chicken Sk-Tmod, and the human, mouse, and zebrafish Sk-Tmods, were aligned with the program CLUSTAL (26Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55635) Google Scholar). A human EST encoding a putative N-Tmod with â¼82% identity to rat N-Tmod (27Watakabe A. Kobayashi R. Helfman D.M. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2299-2310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was also included in the tree. A tropomodulin homolog encoding a predicted protein of 324 aa present inCaenorhabditis elegans was used to root the sequences of vertebrate tropomodulins. Other larger, more distantly related proteins such as the 64-kDa autoantigen D1 and a 684-amino acid protein inC. elegans were not included in this analysis (28Fowler V.M. Conley C.A. Kreis T.E. Vale R.D. Guidebook to Cytoskeletal and Motor Proteins. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 154-159Google Scholar). To optimize the alignment procedure, three different sets of gap opening and extension penalties were used (10â0.05, 5â0.02, and 2â0.02). Each alignment was used independently to calculate the phylogenetic relationship between the aligned sequences. The distance method implemented in the programs PROTDIST and NEIGHBOR (PHYLIP) (29Felsenstein J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 521-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar) was used to infer the phylogeny of Sk-Tmod sequences. The bootstrap frequencies (100 cycles) were used to assess the reliability of the different branching nodes of the final tree (30Felsenstein J. Genet. Res. 1992; 59: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Identical branching arrangements were obtained with the three different alignment conditions. The bootstrap frequencies shown in Fig. 4 correspond to the alignment done with standard CLUSTAL parameters (10â0.05). The nucleotide sequences used in these studies are available from GenBank under the following accession numbers: Gallus domesticus E-Tmod (L36678) (16Babcock G.G. Fowler V.M. J. Biol.

Total mRNA from different adult chicken tissues was extracted using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. mRNAs were resolved by electrophoresis on a 1.2% agarose, 1.2 mformaldehyde gel and then transferred to a nylon Zeta-probe membrane (Bio-Rad). Blots were hybridized with [Î±-32P]dCTP full-length Sk-Tmod cDNA in hybridization solution following standard protocols (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Blots were stripped following the manufacturer's instructions prior to incubating with other probes. For detection of E-Tmod mRNA, a fragment containing the E-Tmod coding sequence was obtained by the polymerase chain reaction and labeled with [Î±-32P]dCTP using the random primer kit (Stratagene). A 60-bp [Î±-32P]dCTP mouse 5.8 S ribosomal RNA fragment, kindly provided by Dr. Vincent Mauro (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) was used as a probe to control for loading and integrity of the mRNA. The migrations of the 28 S and 18 S ribosomal RNAs were used to estimate the size of the tropomodulin mRNAs. Isolated myofibrils from adult chicken breast muscle myofibrils were prepared as described previously for rat psoas myofibrils (24Fowler V.M. Sussmann M.A. Miller P.G. Flucher B.E. Daniels M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The immunostaining was carried out basically as described (33Gregorio C.C. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 683-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, coverslips were washed with phosphate-buffered saline to remove excess fixative, incubated with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min, and then incubated for 1 h with rabbit serum (R3577) generated against recombinant Sk-Tmod (1:100 dilution) or mAb anti-Î±-actinin antibody (1:400 dilution) followed by rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or rhodamine conjugated-donkey anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:200 dilution each) together with bodipy-phallacidin (1:200 dilution). To obtain muscle cryosections, small pieces of adult chicken biceps femoris (BF) muscle were dissected, embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA) in a cryomold (Miles, Elkhart, IN) and immersed in liquid N2. Serial cross-sections of approximately 10 Î¼m thickness were obtained at â16 Â°C on a Cryocut 1800 (Leica, Heidelberg, West Germany) and collected on a glass coverslip. Sections were processed for immunofluorescence as described above. Myofibrils and muscle sections were observed on a Zeiss Axioskop using a Zeiss 63Ã Plan-Apochromat objective lens (1.4 numeric aperture) and a Zeiss 25Ã multi-immersion objective (0.8 numeric aperture). Images were acquired with a cooled CCD-1300Y camera equipped with a Sony interline chip (Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ) using IP laboratory software and then processed using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc. San Jose, CA). In Fig. 9, images were recorded using TriX (400 ASA) film. The full-length Sk-Tmod cDNA was excised from the pBluescript plasmid at EcoRI sites and subcloned in frame into the plasmid pGEX-KG (16Babcock G.G. Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27510-27518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to express a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein in E. coli. Proper orientation of all inserts was confirmed by restriction mapping. For high yields, cells were grown to an A605 of approximately 1 before inducing with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-Î²-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h, and the GST fusion protein was purified as described for E-Tmod (16Babcock G.G. Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27510-27518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. After affinity isolation of the GST fusion protein on a glutathione column and release from the GST by thrombin cleavage, Sk-Tmod was further purified by sequential anion exchange chromatography on a Resource Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), followed by a Mono Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The purified protein was concentrated and dialyzed by vacuum dialysis into 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 80 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.02% sodium azide, 20 Î¼g/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and stored frozen at â80 Â°C. The concentration of Sk-Tmod was determined by light absorption, using Îµ280 = 10.24 mmâ1 cmâ1. The extinction coefficient was calculated from the amino acid composition as described (34Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5048) Google Scholar) using the ProtParam tool available at the EXPASY web site. The amino acid sequence of the GST linker that remains at the N-terminal end of Sk-Tmod is GSPGISGGGGG, which is directly followed by the Sk-Tmod sequence. Measurements of actin elongation were carried out as described previously (35Young C.L. Southwick F.S. Weber A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2232-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar,36Weber A. Pennise C.R. Babcock G.G. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), 2A. Weber, C. Pennise, and V. M. Fowler, submitted for publication. using pyrenyl-labeled rabbit skeletal muscle actin (10% pyrenyl-labeled) and short gelsolin-capped actin filaments as nuclei for polymerization. Actin polymerization was followed continuously for 5â7 h and measured again the next morning. The fluorescence changes (excitation 366.5 and emission 407 nm) were standardized against a Raman excitation peak and measured in a photon counting fluorimeter (Photon Technology International, Princeton, NJ). All experiments were carried out at 20 Â°C with Mg2+-actin (converted from Ca2+-actin as described previously (36Weber A. Pennise C.R. Babcock G.G. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) in a medium containing 10 mm imidazole buffer, pH 7.0, 0.1m KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mmazide, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm ATP, and 0.1 mm CaCl2 (polymerization medium)). Gelsolin-capped actin filaments used as nuclei for polymerization were obtained by copolymerizing actin (usually 10 Î¼m) with gelsolin in the presence of calcium. Average sizes for filaments are given in the figure legend as the ratios of actin:gelsolin. TheKd of Sk-Tmod for capping the pointed ends of pure actin filaments was estimated from the relative proportions of free and capped pointed ends when F-actin was half-maximally polymerized as described.2 For the preparation of gelsolin-capped, tropomyosin-actin filaments as nuclei, rabbit skeletal muscle tropomyosin (37Smillie L.B. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) in excess over that necessary for filament saturation (excess of about 1.0 Î¼m) was mixed with G-actin before copolymerization was started by the addition of salt. In addition, 1.0 Î¼m tropomyosin was added directly to the assay medium to ensure that elongating actin filaments were always saturated with tropomyosin.2 While screening different muscles with a panel of mAbs generated against E-Tmod, we observed a spot in chicken breast muscle that migrated differently from E-Tmod on two-dimensional gels (Fig.1). To determine whether this new tropomodulin spot was a novel isoform of tropomodulin, sequences of four peptides were obtained from tropomodulin immunoprecipitated from adult breast muscle. Comparison of the peptide sequences to the chicken E-Tmod amino acid sequence (16Babcock G.G. Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27510-27518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that all of the peptides we"

To test this hypothesis, we examined the accessibility of native and introduced cysteines in the putative P loop of ENaC.

Biol. 1995; 143: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 2Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). In addition, ENaC is slightly more permeable to Li+ than to Na+, and it is impermeable to anions. However, little is known about the structure of the ion conduction pathway of DEG/ENaC channels or the mechanism of selectivity. The structure of another cation channel, the KcsA K+channel, was recently determined (21Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5796) Google Scholar). Like DEG/ENaC subunits, KcsA has two membrane-spanning domains. The outer pore is a P loop formed by amino acids that precede the second transmembrane segment (M2) and that contains the GYG selectivity filter. Sequence similarity and experimental evidence suggest that this pore structure is shared by Shaker and other six membrane-spanning K+ channels, and it may also be conserved in other tetrameric voltage-gated and cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (21Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5796) Google Scholar). Several findings suggest that DEG/ENaC channels may also contain a P loop and have a pore structure similar to KcsA. First, genetic analysis suggested that DEG/ENaC channels and K+ channels may have evolved from a common ancestral channel (22Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Nature. 1994; 371: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Second, DEG/ENaC channels contain a hydrophobic domain that precedes M2; this may be similar to the K+ channel hydrophobic P loop. Third, consistent with a P loop, protease sensitivity suggests that this hydrophobic domain may extend into the plasma membrane (14Renard S. Lingueglia E. Voilley N. Lazdunski M. Barbry P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12981-12986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, tetraethylammonium (TEA), 1The abbreviations used are:TEAtetraethylammoniumMTSmethanethiosulfonateMTSEA(2-aminoethyl)methanethiosulfonate hydrobromideMTSET[2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate bromideMTSESsodium (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonateMTS-4-fluorescein2[(5-fluoresceinyl)aminocarbonyl]ethyl methanethiosulfonate which interacts with the P loop to block K+ channels, also blocks the pore of a neuronal DEG/ENaC channel (BNC1) (23Adams C.M. Price M.P. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 1377-1383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). tetraethylammonium methanethiosulfonate (2-aminoethyl)methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate bromide sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate 2[(5-fluoresceinyl)aminocarbonyl]ethyl methanethiosulfonate We therefore tested the hypothesis that the pore of DEG/ENaC Na+ channels is similar in structure to the pore of K+ channels. We used methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents to examine the accessibility of native and introduced cysteines in the putative P loop of ENaC, and we compared our results to predictions based on the structure of KcsA. A similar strategy has been successfully used in the structural analysis of a variety of transporters and ion channels including K+ channels (24Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). In addition, we asked whether mutations in this domain altered the selectivity of ENaC. Because the three ENaC subunits have a very similar amino acid sequence, it is likely that they share a similar structure. Thus, we focused our studies on one subunit (Î³) and then extended key findings to the other two subunits. cDNAs encoding human Î±, Î², and Î³ENaC in pMT3 or pcDNA3 vectors were constructed as described previously (12McDonald F.J. Price M.P. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1157-C1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutations were generated by oligonucleotide-based mutagenesis using the Muta-Gene (Bio-Rad) or Quick-change (Stratagene) kits, and the accuracy of the mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. We expressed ENaC inXenopus oocytes by nuclear injection of cDNAs encoding each subunit (0.2â0.4 ng each). Following incubation of the oocytes for 16â24 h in modified Barth's solution at 18 Â°C, we measured whole-cell current by two-electrode voltage clamp. Oocytes were bathed in NaCl Ringer (116 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 0.4 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, with NaOH) or a solution in which NaCl was replaced by LiCl or KCl. Oocytes were voltage-clamped at a potential of â60 mV, and current-voltage relationships were obtained by stepping to potentials between â140 and +40 mV (20 mV steps) for 300 ms. Amiloride-sensitive current was determined by subtracting current obtained at â60 mV with a maximal dose of amiloride (or benzamil) in the bathing solution, from base-line current without amiloride. We used concentrations of amiloride and benzamil that completely blocked the channels. Mean amiloride-sensitive Na+ current for wild-type ENaC was 1.87 Â± 0.22 Î¼A (n = 34). Permeability ratios were calculated from changes in reversal potential with Na+, Li+, and K+ as the predominant cation in the extracellular bathing solution (25Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates Inc., Sunderland, MA1992: 344Google Scholar). We determined the sensitivity of wild-type or mutant ENaC to (2-aminoethyl)methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide (MTSEA, 1 mm), [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET, 1 mm), sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTSES, 10 mm), and 2[(5-fluoresceinyl)aminocarbonyl]ethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTS-4-fluorescein, 200 Î¼m) (Toronto Research Chemicals) by addition of these compounds to the extracellular bathing solution. Percent change in amiloride-sensitive Na+ current was calculated as ((IMTS â Ibasal)/Ibasal)Â·100 where IMTS is amiloride-sensitive current after treatment with an MTS reagent, and Ibasal is amiloride-sensitive current before treatment. Coexpression of Î± and Î²ENaC without Î³ produced small Na+ currents (12McDonald F.J. Price M.P. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1157-C1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to facilitate electrophysiological analysis, we used a Î² subunit truncated after M2 (Î²R566X) to increase Na+ current (4Schild L. Canessa C.M. Shimkets R.A. Gautschi I. Lifton R.P. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5699-5703Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar,5Snyder P.M. Price M.P. McDonald F.J. Adams C.M. Volk K.A. Zeiher B.G. Stokes J.B. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 969-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Mutation of residues 542â544 in Î³ENaC also produced a significant decrease in Na+ current, so we introduced an equivalent truncation mutation (Î³K576X) in these constructs to increase current. Truncation of Î² and Î³ENaC had no effect on the sensitivity of ENaC to MTS reagents or selectivity. Each mutant channel produced >20-fold more Na+ current than Î± and Î²ENaC coexpressed without Î³. ENaC contains three native cysteines in M2: Cys541 and Cys545 in the Î³ subunit and Cys536 in Î² (see Fig. 5 Abelow). To determine whether these cysteines were accessible to the extracellular bathing solution, we examined the effect of extracellular MTSEA on Na+ current. This compound modifies cysteines by covalently attaching a positively charged (S)-ethyl ammonium group. In Xenopus oocytes expressing Î±, Î², and Î³ENaC, addition of MTSEA to the extracellular bathing solution irreversibly decreased Na+ current by 60% (Fig.1, A and B). The residual current was blocked by amiloride, a blocker of DEG/ENaC channels. This result suggests that MTSEA covalently modified one or more cysteine(s) in wild-type ENaC, resulting in irreversible inhibition of the channel.Figure 1Effect of MTS reagents on ENaC.

Inhibition in the presence of amiloride was not different than zero (p = 0.08).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify the subunit or subunits modified by MTSEA, we expressed the Î± subunit alone or in combination with Î² or Î³ENaC. Although maximal Na+ current requires coexpression of all three subunits, expression of Î±ENaC alone or coexpression of Î± with either Î² or Î³ENaC produce functional Na+ channels (11Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1795) Google Scholar,12McDonald F.J. Price M.P. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1157-C1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When the Î± subunit was expressed alone or with Î²ENaC, MTSEA produced only a small decrease in Na+ current (Fig.1 B). Thus, modification of Î²Cys-536 or other cysteines in Î² or Î±ENaC was not responsible for inhibition of the wild-type channel. In contrast, when we coexpressed Î± and Î³, MTSEA decreased Na+ current to the same extent as with expression of all three subunits (Fig. 1 B), indicating that the Î³ subunit was the major target for MTSEA. Mutation of both M2 cysteines in Î³ (Î³C541A/C545A) significantly diminished inhibition by MTSEA (by 45%) (Fig.1 C). Mutation of Cys541 (Î³C541A) reproduced the effect of Î³C54A/C545A, but mutation of Cys545 (Î³C545A) did not (Fig. 1 C). These data suggest that Cys541 was accessible to modification and was the main residue responsible for inhibition of ENaC by MTSEA. Other cysteines in ENaC may also be modified by MTSEA, since mutation of Cys541 did not completely abolish inhibition, but such cysteines lie outside the M2 and pre-M2 segment. In contrast to MTSEA, a larger cationic reagent, MTSET, did not inhibit ENaC (Fig. 1, D and F). Subsequent treatment with MTSEA (after MTSET) decreased Na+ current (Fig. 1,D and F), suggesting that Cys541 had not been modified by MTSET and was therefore inaccessible to this reagent. An anionic reagent, MTSES, also did not decrease Na+ current and did not prevent MTSEA from subsequently inhibiting the channel (Fig. 1, E and F). Because MTSES is 10-fold less reactive than MTSEA to thiols in aqueous solution, we used a 10-fold higher concentration (10 mm). Thus, access to Cys541 is constrained by the size and charge of the MTS reagent, consistent with location of this residue in the channel pore. Amiloride inhibits ENaC by directly or indirectly occluding the pore. Therefore, if Cys541 is located in the pore, amiloride might protect this residue from modification by MTSEA. To test this, we blocked ENaC with a maximal concentration of amiloride (100 Î¼m) and then added MTSEA to the bathing solution in the continued presence of amiloride (Fig. 1 G). Following washout of both MTSEA and amiloride, whole-cell current was similar to current prior to treatment; MTSEA decreased Na+ current by only 8.6% (not statistically different than zero) when amiloride blocked the channel (Fig. 1, G and H). Subsequent treatment with MTSEA (without amiloride) irreversibly inhibited ENaC to the same extent (60%) as channels not previously treated with amiloride and MTSEA (Fig. 1 G). Thus, amiloride prevented access to the cysteine or cysteines responsible for most of the inhibition by MTSEA. Because Cys541 makes an important contribution to this inhibition, these results suggest that amiloride prevented modification of Cys541 and, therefore, that this residue is located in the channel pore. Moreover, these results suggest that Cys541 lies deeper within the pore than the site of amiloride block. Although MTSEA is membrane-permeable in its unprotonated form (26Holmgren M. Liu Y. Xu Y. Yellen G. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), the ability of extracellular amiloride to protect Cys541 argues that MTSEA must enter the pore from the extracellular side to modify this residue. To examine the accessibility of other residues in the M2 and pre-M2 segments, we replaced amino acids in Î³ preceding Cys541(540 to 519) individually with cysteine. Following expression of each mutant Î³ subunit with wild-type Î± and Î², we examined the effect of extracellular MTSET, which did not inhibit wild-type ENaC (Fig.2, A and B). Based on the response to MTSET, we identified three functional segments between amino acids 519 and 540. In the most C-terminal segment, cysteines introduced at position 536 (Î³G536C) or 533 (Î³G533C) allowed MTSET to irreversibly decrease Na+ current (90 and 35%, respectively) (Fig. 2, A and B), indicating that these cysteines were accessible to modification by MTSET. When cysteines were placed at other positions from 531 to 540, MTSET did not alter Na+ current (Fig. 2 B). Either these residues were not accessible to extracellular MTSET or modification did not alter Na+ current. In the Î± and Î² subunits, introduction of cysteine at the position equivalent to Î³Gly-536 (Î±S556C and Î²G527C) each resulted in inhibition by MTSET (76 and 67%, respectively). In a second segment (526â530), cysteine modification stimulated ENaC. When we placed cysteine at position 530 (Î³N530C), 528 (Î³L528C), or 526 (Î³M526C), extracellular MTSET produced a large increase in Na+ current (Fig. 2,A and B). In each case, stimulation resulted from covalent modification of the introduced cysteine, since the increase was irreversible and the current was completely blocked by amiloride. MTSET also stimulated current when cysteines were placed in the Î± and Î² subunits within this domain (Î±S549C, 77%; Î²S520C, 328%). MTSET inhibited ENaC when cysteines were placed at two positions in a third segment further toward the N terminus. When we mutated Ser523 and Ser519 individually to cysteine, MTSET produced a rapid and irreversible decrease in Na+current (39 and 34%, respectively) (Fig. 2, A andB). Therefore, these residues were also accessible to modification by MTSET. To localize the reactive cysteines relative to the site of amiloride block, we asked whether amiloride (or the amiloride analog benzamil) would prevent modification. Channels were treated with MTSET while they were blocked by a maximal dose of amiloride or benzamil (Fig.3 A). Following washout of both reagents, current was compared with base-line current before treatment. Fig. 3 B plots the MTSET-induced change in Na+current in the absence or presence of amiloride/benzamil. When the channel contained cysteine at position 536, current returned close to the original base line following washout (Fig. 3 A). Thus, benzamil prevented modification of this residue (Fig. 3 B), similar to our finding that amiloride protected wild-type ENaC from modification by MTSEA. Conversely, when cysteine was placed at position 533, MTSET inhibited the channel to the same extent in the absence or presence of amiloride (Fig. 3, A and B). Thus, amiloride did not prevent modification of residue 533. MTSET also modified cysteines at positions 530, 528, and 526 when the channel was blocked by amiloride (Fig. 3, A and B), resulting in increased Na+ current. Similarly, MTSET modified cysteines at positions 523 and 519 in the presence of amiloride, decreasing Na+ current (Fig. 3, A andB). These results localize Gly536 in the pore internal to the site of amiloride/benzamil block, whereas the reactive residues from 533 to 519 lie external to this site. To define further the relative positions of the reactive amino acids, we took advantage of the ability of the ENaC pore to exclude anions. MTSES is similar in size to MTSET, but it carries a negative charge. As described above, Cys541 was inaccessible to MTSES. Similarly, MTSES did not alter Na+current when ENaC contained cysteine at position 536, in contrast to MTSET which decreased Na+ current 90%. To determine whether Cys536 was inaccessible to MTSES or if modification by MTSES did not alter Na+ current, we asked whether this residue could be modified by MTSET following treatment with MTSES. MTSET decreased Na+ current to the same extent as in cells not pretreated with MTSES (Fig. 3 C), indicating that the cysteine at position 536 was inaccessible to MTSES. In contrast to Cys536, pretreatment of cysteine at position 533 with MTSES prevented inhibition of the channel by MTSET (Fig. 3 C). This indicates that MTSES modified Cys533. Cysteines at positions 530, 523, and 519 were also accessible to MTSES, as indicated by the lack of response to MTSET following pretreatment by MTSES (Fig.3 C). These results suggest that the segment from 536 to 533 spans a selectivity barrier that excludes anions, although it is unclear if the same mechanism prevents small anions (e.g.Clâ) from permeating ENaC. Cys541 and Gly536 lie internal and residues 533, 530, 523, and 519 lie external to this selectivity barrier. We also took advantage of the ability of the pore to discriminate based on size. We tested the accessibility of the introduced cysteines to an MTS reagent that covalently attaches a much larger side chain, MTS-4-fluorescein. This reagent does not alter Na+ current through wild-type ENaC. Similar to our studies with MTSES above, we asked whether MTSET would alter Na+ current following pretreatment with MTS-4-fluorescein. MTS-4-fluorescein did not prevent inhibition of channels containing Cys536 (Fig.3 C), indicating that this cysteine was not accessible to this reagent. Conversely, cysteines at positions 533, 530, 523, and 519 were accessible to modification by MTS-4-fluorescein; pretreatment with MTS-4-fluorescein prevented modification by MTSET (Fig. 3 C). Thus, the segment from 536 to 533 also spans a size barrier; Cys541 and Gly536 are internal and residues 533, 530, 523, and 519 are external to this size barrier. A defining characteristic of ENaC is its selectivity for Na+ over K+. To determine whether amino acids in the M2 and pre-M2 segments are required, we examined the selectivity of ENaC containing mutations in this segment of the Î³ subunit. Fig.4 A shows current-voltage relationships with Na+, Li+, or K+as the predominant cation in the extracellular bathing solution; permeability ratios were calculated from the resulting reversal potentials. Wild-type ENaC is less permeable to Na+ than Li+(PNa+/PLi+= 0.76 Â± 0.03) and relatively impermeable to K+(PK+/PNa+= 0.006 Â± 0.003) (Fig. 4, A and B). Although most of the mutations had little effect, mutation of the amino acids surrounding Cys541 altered selectivity. Î³C541A produced a small (but statistically insignificant) increase in the Na+/Li+ permeability ratio (1.6 Â± 0.4) but did not alter K+ permeability (Fig.4 B). A relatively conservative mutation of neighboring Ser540 to cysteine produced a much larger increase in the Na+/Li+ permeability ratio (5.0 Â± 1.3), as reflected by the smaller current and the shift in reversal potential when Li+ replaced Na+ in the bathing solution (Fig. 4, A and B). This mutation also had no effect on K+ permeability (Fig. 4, A andB). Interestingly, the amino acid at the equivalent position in Î± and Î²ENaC, and in all other members of the DEG/ENaC family, is glycine (Fig. 5 A). However, this amino acid difference is functionally conservative; mutation of Ser540 in Î³ to glycine produced permeability properties identical to wild-type ENaC (not shown). In contrast to these effects on Na+/Li+selectivity, mutation of another neighboring amino acid, Ser542, increased the permeability of the channel to K+ but did not alter the Na+/Li+permeability ratio (Fig. 4, A and B). Although this mutant channel was still more permeable to Na+ than K+ ( PK+/ PNa+ = 0.15 Â± 0.02), the inward K+ current observed was in stark contrast to the relative K+ impermeability of wild-type ENaC (Fig.4 A). All members of the DEG/ENaC family studied to date are selective for Na+ over K+, and Ser542 is conserved in each of these channels. Thus, this conserved serine might be an important determinant of Na+/K+ selectivity. To test the hypothesis that DEG/ENaC subunits and K+channels have a similar pore structure, we aligned their sequences based on hydrophobicity plots of the M2 and pre-M2 segments (Fig.5 A). Despite only limited sequence similarity between ENaC and K+ channels, hydrophobicity plots for these channels are remarkably similar in this region. An identical alignment was previously proposed (22Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Nature. 1994; 371: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). We then compared the accessibility of cysteines in Î³ENaC to predictions made from the alignment and known structure of KcsA. Fig. 5 B shows two (of four) subunits of KcsA. We superimposed the predicted positions of reactive cysteines in Î³ENaC; inhibitory residues 541, 536, and 533 are blue,stimulatory residues 530, 528, and 526 are yellow, and inhibitory residues 523 and 519 are red. If ENaC and K+ channels have a similar pore structure, the KcsA structure predicts that Cys541 would lie outside the pore (Fig. 5 B). However, four findings suggest not only that Cys541 is located in the pore but in a relatively narrow region of the pore. First, Cys541 was covalently modified by a small MTS reagent (MTSEA), but not by larger (MTSET, MTS-4-fluorescein) or anionic (MTSES) reagents. Second, the rate of modification by MTSEA was slow requiring more than 100 s, consistent with a relatively inaccessible location. Third, the data suggest that amiloride prevented modification of Cys541, indicating that this residue lies internal to the site of amiloride block. Fourth, mutation of neighboring residues altered channel selectivity, suggesting that Cys541 is located in a segment ((S/G)CS) that may contribute to the selectivity filter of ENaC. In K+ channels, the residue predicted to be equivalent to Gly536 (Tyr82 in KcsA) is the binding site for external TEA (Fig. 5, A and B) (21Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5796) Google Scholar). This is interesting since mutation of Gly536 decreased the affinity of ENaC for amiloride (27Schild L. Schneeberger E. Gautschi I. Firsov D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and benzamil. 2P. M. Snyder, D. R. Olson, and D. B. Bucher, unpublished observations. The predicted equivalent to Gly533 (Gly79 in KcsA) is part of the selectivity filter of the K+ channel (Fig. 5,A and B) (21Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5796) Google Scholar). However, mutation of Gly533 and adjacent amino acids did not disrupt the selectivity of ENaC. Based on the structure of KcsA, we would predict that Gly533 would lie internal to Gly536 (Fig.5 B). Both residues were accessible to MTSET. However, in contrast to the prediction, Gly533 was also accessible to anionic (MTSES) and large (MTS-4-fluorescein) reagents, whereas Gly536 was not. In addition benzamil protected Gly536 from modification but did not protect Gly533. Thus, Gly536 lies deeper within the pore than Gly533, opposite to the orientation predicted from alignment with KcsA. The alignment predicts that residues in the stimulatory segment of Î³ENaC (residues 526â530) are located internal to the selectivity filter. Asn530 lines up with Val76 in KcsA which lies at the internal end of the selectivity filter (Fig.5 A), and Leu528 in Î³ENaC is the predicted equivalent to the residue that forms the binding site for internal TEA in K+ channels (Thr74 in KcsA, Fig. 5,A and B) (28Yellen G. Jurman M.E. Abramson T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1991; 251: 939-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Thus, if the pore of ENaC is similar to K+ channels, residues 528 and 530 would be internal to Gly536 and not accessible to modification from the extracellular side (Fig. 5 B). However, external MTSET did modify these residues. In addition, several findings suggest that these residues lie in a relatively exposed position external to Gly536. First, modification by MTSET increased Na+ current. If these residues were located deep within the pore, we would expect that addition of a large cationic side chain (by MTSET modification) would impede the flow of Na+ through the pore, decreasing current. Second, MTSES and MTS-4-fluorescein also modified a residue in this domain, suggesting that it lies external to the selectivity and size barrier that restricts access to Gly536. Third, amiloride did not protect these residues from modification, suggesting that they lie external to the site of amiloride block. Finally, in another DEG/ENaC family member, BNC1, mutation of Gly430 to phenylalanine in this domain created a binding site for external TEA (23Adams C.M. Price M.P. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 1377-1383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Therefore, the data are not consistent with the hypothesis that ENaC and K+ channels have a similar pore structure and suggest that the pore of ENaC has a novel structure. Fig. 5 C shows a working model. The results suggest that Cys541 and the (S/G)CS motif lie in a relatively narrow part of the pore and may contribute to the selectivity filter, analogous to the GYG motif in K+ channels. However, in ENaC this sequence is not predicted to be located in a pore loop but near the extracellular end of M2. The equivalent segment in the Î± and Î² subunits may also contribute to selectivity; mutation of the residues in Î±ENaC equivalent to Î³Cys-541 and Î³Ser-542produced a small change in the Na+/Li+selectivity (29Waldmann R. Champigny G. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11735-11737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and in the Na+/K+ selectivity (30Kellenberger S. Gautschi I. Schild L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4170-4175Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), respectively. Based on this altered Na+/K+ selectivity, Kellenberger and co-workers (30Kellenberger S. Gautschi I. Schild L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4170-4175Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) independently proposed a model in which Î±Ser-589contributes to the cation selectivity of ENaC. The (S/G)CS motif might participate in selectivity by forming a cation-binding site. It is interesting that serine and glycine at position 540 were equivalent, suggesting that a specific side chain was not required for normal selectivity. Perhaps the cation-binding site is not formed by the side chain but by the main chain carbonyl oxygens, as has been proposed for K+ channels (21Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5796) Google Scholar). Alternatively, mutations of the (S/G)CS motif might indirectly alter selectivity by causing a structural change. This seems less likely since the mutations that we tested outside of this motif did not alter selectivity. However, since we only tested the effect of cysteine substitutions, we cannot exclude the possibility that mutation to other amino acids might alter selectivity. The data suggest that Gly536 is located in a wider and more superficial part of the pore than Cys541 (Fig.5 C); a cysteine introduced at position 536 was modified not only by MTSEA but also by the larger reagent MTSET. Our results suggest that the equivalent residues in Î± and Î² make a similar contribution to the pore and are consistent with previous reports regarding the accessibility of these residues to Zn2+ (27Schild L. Schneeberger E. Gautschi I. Firsov D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and (for mouse Î±ENaC) MTSEA (19Kosari F. Sheng S. Li J. Mak D.-O.D. Foskett J.K. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13469-13474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The contribution of this residue to the pore is also conserved in another DEG/ENaC family member; in BNC1, MTSEA inhibited the channel when a cysteine was introduced at Gly437 (equivalent to Î³Gly-536) (31Adams C.M. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15500-15504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Gly533 lies external to Gly536, as discussed above. Our results localize the site of amiloride and benzamil block to this short segment of amino acids between 533 and 536 (Fig.5 C). In addition, these amino acids form a barrier that can exclude MTS reagents based on their charge and size. The mechanism of amiloride block is not clear. Amiloride block is voltage-dependent, sensing 15â30% of the electrical field (32Palmer L.G. J. Membr. Biol. 1984; 80: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 33McNicholas C.M. Canessa C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 34Fyfe G.K. Canessa C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition, as discussed above, mutation of Gly536 decreased the affinity of ENaC for amiloride. Thus, the simplest interpretation is that amiloride directly blocks the pore by binding to a site between Gly533 and Gly536(as illustrated in Fig. 5 C). However, it has been reported that mutation of residues at a site in the extracellular domain also disrupted block by amiloride, raising the possibility that amiloride might block the channel indirectly through an allosteric mechanism (35Ismailov I.I. Kieber-Emmons T. Lin C. Berdiev B.K. Shlyonsky V.Gh. Patton H.K. Fuller C.M. Worrell R. Zuckerman J.B. Sun W. Eaton D.C. Benos D.J. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21075-21083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). If this is the case, then the site between Gly533 and Gly536 might not be a binding site for amiloride, but rather the site of a conformational change that occludes the pore in response to the binding of amiloride to a distant site. Although this mechanism seems less likely, it remains consistent with the location of Gly533 and Gly536 in the channel pore. Our results suggest that residues 526, 528, and 530 also lie external to Gly536. Although their position relative to Gly533 is less clear, the simplest interpretation is that they lie external to this residue (Fig. 5 C) since modification increased Na+ current, rather than blocking the channel. In the Î± and Î² subunits, modification of cysteines placed in this domain also increased Na+ current, suggesting that they occupy relatively equivalent positions in the channel. Interestingly, these residues are located at the equivalent position to âDEGâ mutations in other DEG/ENaC family members; mutation of a specific residue (e.g. Gly430 in BNC1) to an amino acid with a large side chain causes neuronal swelling and/or channel activation (6Tavernarakis N. Driscoll M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 659-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 9Adams C.M. Anderson M.G. Motto D.G. Price M.P. Johnson W.A. Welsh M.J. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 30204-30207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of increased current is unknown, our recent results suggest that in BNC1, the large side chain disrupts channel gating by interfering with closing of the channel (37Adams C.M. Snyder P.M. Price M.P. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30204-30207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In ENaC, modification of cysteines introduced in this DEG domain may have an analogous effect by increasing the size of the cysteine side chain. It is interesting that in Î³ENaC stimulation was not specific to the single DEG residue but could be produced by modification of cysteines at three different positions within this functional segment. Ser523 and Ser519 appear to lie external to Gly536 based on the inability of amiloride to protect these residues from modification and on the accessibility of these residues to MTSES and MTS-4-fluorescein. Their location relative to the stimulatory segment (residues 526â530) is unclear. The hydrophobicity plot suggests that the pre-M2 segment may form a loop, which is consistent with the results of previous protease sensitivity experiments (14Renard S. Lingueglia E. Voilley N. Lazdunski M. Barbry P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12981-12986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in our model we tentatively placed these amino acids in the pore internal to residues 526â530 (Fig.5 C). Such a position is consistent with our finding that modification by MTSET decreased Na+ current, possibly by obstructing the flow of Na+ through the pore. This overall architecture is also consistent with an Î±Î² barrel model for the outer pore of ENaC proposed by Guy and Durell (38Guy H.R. Durell S.R. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: A243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) using theoretical considerations. However, it is also possible that Ser523and Ser519 lie external to residues 526â530, with modification inhibiting the channel through an indirect conformational change. The model that we propose assumes that the MTS reagents can only access cysteines via an aqueous pathway, an assumption that is consistent with previous reports (24Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). However, if MTS reagents modified cysteines through other non-aqueous pathways, the data could be consistent with other pore models. Our studies focused on the Î³ subunit. However, studies on key residues in the Î± and Î² subunits suggest that the three subunits share a similar structure in the pore domain and that each subunit makes a similar contribution to the pore of ENaC. In previous studies, investigators swapped the M2 segments between Î±ENaC and MEC-4, a related protein from Caenorhabditis elegans (29Waldmann R. Champigny G. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11735-11737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 39Hong K. Driscoll M. Nature. 1994; 367: 470-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this produced functional proteins, suggesting that M2 from one family member could substitute for M2 of another. In addition, several observations from BNC1 fit nicely with the model proposed for the pore of ENaC. Thus, it seems likely that members of the DEG/ENaC family share a common pore architecture.

Dynamic interaction studies using combinations of Nt-abp1, synthetic peptides corresponding to conserved sequences within auxin-binding proteins, and the mAbs have shown that a number of the mAbs recognized discontinuous epitopes revealing the junction of distinct domains in the folded protein. In particular, the two putative auxin binding domains and the C terminus of the protein were shown to interact with each other in the folded protein. Using the auxin-induced electrical response of tobacco protoplasts as a functional assay, all the mAbs exhibited either auxin antagonist or hormonomimetic properties. These effects, measured for the first time in homologous conditions, confirm that Nt-abp1 is present at the plasma membrane and is involved in the activation of the auxin-dependent electrical response of tobacco protoplasts. Based on our surface plasmon resonance data, we propose that the key event leading to the activation of this auxin electrical response consists of a conformational change in Nt-abp1.

The plant hormone auxin controls alone or in concert with other plant hormones a wide range of plant growth and developmental processes including cell division, cell elongation, lateral and adventitious root formation, tropisms, and cell differentiation (1Davies P.J. Davies P.J. Plant Hormones: Physiology, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Kluwer Academic Publishers, The Netherlands1995: 1-38Crossref Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms of auxin action are still poorly understood, although recent advances resulting from molecular studies of auxin-regulated genes and genetic approaches have contributed to the identification of transcription factors, some with defined genetic function, and to the demonstration that the regulated protein degradation by the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway plays a key role in auxin action (2Abel S.

Within the last 10 years, biochemical approaches have been developed with the objective of identifying auxin receptors. A number of soluble and membrane-associated auxin-binding proteins have been described. However, in most cases their functional role in signaling, transport, or metabolism of auxin remains unclear (6Venis M.A. Napier R.M. CRC Crit. Rev.

Even the function of the most studied auxin-binding protein (ABP1) 1The abbreviations used are:ABP1auxin-binding protein 1NAA1-naphthaleneacetic acidmAbmonoclonal antibodyNt-abp1Nicotiana tabacum auxin-binding protein 1RUresonance unitZm-abp1Zea maÄ±Ìs auxin-binding protein 1ELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay remains elusive.

This hypothesis depended mainly on electrophysiological studies (10Barbier-Brygoo H. Ephritikhine G. KlaÌmbt D. Ghislain M. Guern J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Electrophysiological responses to auxin reflect the modulation of membrane ion transport as a rapid response (less than 1 min) to auxin action at the outer face of the plasma membrane (15Venis M.A. Thomas E.W. Barbier-Brygoo H. Ephritikhine G. Guern J. Planta. 1990; 1: 232-235Google Scholar). The involvement of ABP1 or an immunologically related protein was mainly suggested by a series of electrophysiological experiments with the maize protein (10Barbier-Brygoo H. Ephritikhine G.

Guern J. Plant Growth Regul. 1996; 18: 23-28Crossref Google Scholar) as plant materials. Thus, these data have been obtained by using heterologous tools for distinct electrical measurements. Most of the polyclonal antibodies to Zm-abp1 are mapped close to itsN-glycosylation site interacting with a restricted region of the protein (17Napier R. Venis M.A. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 841-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), weakening the reported data, and compromising their use to further investigate the involvement of ABP1 in auxin signaling. At the moment, the involvement of ABP1 as an auxin receptor is based on the accumulation of weak evidence and remains open to question, as reflected in a provocative paper by Hertel (18Hertel R. J. Exp. Bot. 1995; 46: 461-462Crossref Google Scholar). Recently, interest in ABP1 was brought up to date by work in which transgenic plants overexpressing ABP1 were shown to exhibit an increased capacity for auxin-mediated cell expansion (19Jones A.M. Im K.H. Savka M.A. Wu M.J. DeWitt N.G. Shillito R. Binns A.N. Science. 1998; 282: 1114-1117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), establishing a relationship between the expression of ABP1 and this auxin growth response. In addition, we have recently shown that the tobacco protein alone induces the activation of the electrical membrane response of tobacco mesophyll protoplasts (20Leblanc N. Perrot-Rechenmann C. Barbier-Brygoo H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) reinforcing the correlation between ABP1, auxin, and the early electrical response. auxin-binding protein 1 1-naphthaleneacetic acid monoclonal antibody Nicotiana tabacum auxin-binding protein 1 resonance unit Zea maÄ±Ìs auxin-binding protein 1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay To further characterize ABP1 and investigate its possible role in auxin signaling, we have assembled specific tools and functional responses for a single plant material. Modification of the transmembrane electrical potential of tobacco protoplasts in response to auxin was one of the earliest responses related to the perception of auxin at the plasma membrane to be reported (15Venis M.A. Thomas E.W. Barbier-Brygoo H. Ephritikhine G. Guern J. Planta. 1990; 1: 232-235Google Scholar). Following the isolation of the tobacco ABP1 cDNA (21Leblanc N. Roux C. Pradier J.M. Perrot-Rechenmann C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 33: 679-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we have developed a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the recombinant Nt-abp1 allowing experiments to be performed in homologous conditions. The interaction between these mAbs and Nt-abp1 has been extensively characterized using a biosensor-based analytical system to provide real-time measurements. This method has allowed for the first time detailed analysis of the three-dimensional configuration of the protein, and we report a unique picture of the folding of Nt-abp1. The present work clarifies the involvement of Nt-abp1 in an early auxin response. Our results are discussed in relation to the idea that different conformational states of Nt-abp1 mediate transduction of the auxin signal at the plasma membrane. The recombinant tobacco protein, Nt-abp1, was produced in Escherichia coli and purified as described by Leblanc et al. (21Leblanc N. Roux C. Pradier J.M. Perrot-Rechenmann C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 33: 679-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Zm-abp1 was extracted and purified from microsomal fractions of maize coleoptiles as described previously (22Napier R.M. Venis M.A. Bolton M.A. Richardson L.I. Butcher G.W. Planta. 1988; 176: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Four synthetic peptides corresponding to Nt-abp1 domains have been used. Their sequences correspond to particular domains of ABP1 proteins: RTPIHRHSCEEIFIVLKG, named pep A, corresponds to the conserved box A suspected to be involved in the binding of auxin (23Venis M.A. Napier R.M. Barbier-Brygoo H. Maurel C. Perrot-Rechenmann C. Guern J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7208-7212Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar); EHEDLQVLDVISRPP, named pep B, corresponds to the highly conserved box B; VFMYDDWSMPHTAAKLKFP, named pep C, corresponds to the peptide 11 found by Brown and Jones (24Brown J.C. Jones A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21136-21140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to be labeled by azidoindole-3-acetic acid; and WDEDCYQTTSWKDEL, named C-term, corresponds to the C-terminal domain of Nt-abp1 (20Leblanc N. Perrot-Rechenmann C. Barbier-Brygoo H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Peptides A, B, and C were provided by A. Jones (University of North Carolina) via the Micro Protein Chemistry Facility, and pep C-term was synthesized and purified in the laboratory of J. Igolen (Institut Pasteur, Paris). A BALB/c mouse was injected intraperitoneally with 24 Î¼g of purified E. coli Nt-abp1 emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant. Two other boosts of antigen were given 2 and 3 months later 3 days before fusion. Fusion of splenocytes with SP2O-Ag14 myeloma cells was carried out with 1 ml of 45% polyethylene glycol following the procedure described by Nowinsky et al. (25Nowinski R.C. Lonstrom M.E. Tam M.R. Burnette W.R. Virology. 1979; 93: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). After initial screening of hybridomas by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), selected hybridomas were subcloned to ensure monoclonality. Strong positive clones were propagated in mice to produce ascitic fluids. Monoclonal isotypes were determined using the Serotec kit (Argene). The initial screening of culture supernatants was done by ELISA. Microwell plates (Falcon) were coated with 100 Î¼l of purified E. coli Nt-abp1 (0.5 Î¼g/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl) containing 4 Î¼g/ml fat-free milk proteins for 90 min at 37 Â°C and then incubated overnight at 4 Â°C. Control wells were coated in the same conditions with fat-free milk proteins (4 Î¼g/ml) or proteins extracted from nonrecombinant E. coli cells (4 Î¼g/ml). Incubation with the supernatants (dilution 1/2) was followed by incubation with an anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. Enzymatic activity was revealed using p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 1 mm diethanolamine, pH 9.8, 10 mmMgCl2. For Western blot analysis, proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis on 12.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes (HybondC, 0.45 Î¼m, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After blocking with 5% fat-free milk, membranes were incubated with monoclonal antibodies to Nt-abp1 (ascitic fluids diluted at 1:1000) for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline Tween (250 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1% Tween 20). After washing in Tris-buffered saline Tween, the bound antibodies were detected by goat anti-mouse IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Biosys, diluted at 1:1000). Membranes were then transferred in 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 9.7, 10 mm magnesium acetate, and the enzymatic activity was revealed using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (Bio-Rad) as substrates. The analytical system, BIAcore (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), based on surface plasmon resonance (26Johnsson B. LoÌfas S. Lindquist G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar, 27Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. End P. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 913-915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), was used to extensively characterize the interaction of mAbs with Nt-abp1 whole protein or domains. Purified E. coli-produced Nt-abp1 was biotinylated using photoactivable biotin (CLONTECH) as described by Lacey and Grant (28Lacey E. Grant W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 163: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and about 10,000 RU avidin D (Vector) were first covalently immobilized by aminolink to CM-dextran under standard conditions (26Johnsson B. LoÌfas S. Lindquist G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). Biotinylated Nt-abp1 was injected at concentrations ranging from 40 to 100 Î¼g/ml under a flow of 10 Î¼l/min for 8 min. In these conditions, 500â2000 RU were immobilized on the linked avidin. The different peptides were immobilized by aminolink on a hyperactivated CM-dextran matrix. Hyperactivation was performed by injection of 50 mm N-ethyl-Nâ²-(3-diethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide in HBS (25 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, and 0.05% P20) for 20 min at flow 2 Î¼l/min. The peptides of acidic pI were injected at a concentration of 500 Î¼g/ml in 10 mm sodium formate buffer at pH 3.5, and the peptides of alkaline pI were injected at the same concentration in 5 mmmaleate buffer, pH 6.0. Unreacted sites were blocked with a 25-min injection of 1 m ethylenediamine hydrochloride, pH 7.8, at 2 Î¼l/min. The reactivity of each mAb was checked by injection of 30 Î¼l of diluted ascitic fluids or hybridoma supernatants at a final concentration of about 0.3 Î¼mimmunoglobulin. Standard mAb binding experiments were performed under a flow of 5 Î¼l/min in HBS. After each experiment, the antibodies were removed by a short pulse of 8 Î¼l of 100 mm HCl. Under these conditions, Nt-abp1 antigenicity was well conserved for 40â50 runs. Interaction of mAbs with Nt-abp1 has also been investigated at pH 5.7 in 15 mm maleate buffer, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% P20. Pairwise epitope mapping was conducted under two distinct conditions. Competition assays were first performed on the immobilized biotinylated Nt-abp1. Three 40-Î¼l sequential injections of the first mAb, ensuring exhaustive binding to the corresponding epitope, were followed by one injection of a second mAb. Each mAb was successively used as a first or second mAb. In a distinct set of experiments, a sandwich procedure was performed as follows: on immobilized rabbit anti-mouse antibody the first mAb to Nt-abp1 was captured; then the purified Nt-abp1 was injected followed by one injection of a second mAb. Monoclonal antibodies were incubated in the presence of a 30-fold excess of peptide (mole of mAb/mole of peptide) before injection on the biosensors consisting of immobilized Nt-abp1 or of the individual synthetic peptides. The capture of the mAbs in the presence of the synthetic peptides was compared with their capture on the same biosensor in the absence of the peptide competitors. The effects of mAbs to E. coli-produced Nt-abp1 were tested on mesophyll protoplasts from young tobacco leaves (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi, wild-type clone XHFD8) isolated as described previously (29Caboche M. Planta. 1980; 149: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). For each experiment, aliquots (100 Î¼l) of the protoplast suspension (5 Ã 104protoplasts/ml) were incubated with different concentrations of IgGs for 5 min at room temperature. The membrane potentialEm was measured as described previously (30Ephritikhine G. Barbier-Brygoo H. Muller J.F. Guern J. Plant Physiol. ( Bethesda ). 1987; 83: 801-804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) directly or after the addition of NAA 3 Ã 10â6m in the external medium. Dose-response curves were established by plotting ÎEm values as a function of antibody concentration. For these experiments, mAb 12 IgG1 was purified using recombinant protein A/G affinity chromatography (Pierce), and mAb 37 IgM was precipitated with ammonium sulfate from culture supernatants. In all experiments, controls were performed with nonspecific IgGs or IgMs prepared in the same conditions. Recombinant Nt-abp1, purified from E. coli, was used for mouse immunization to raise monoclonal antibodies. About 70 culture supernatants of hybridomas derived from one fusion were tested by ELISA allowing the selection of 9 positive clones. Antibody isotyping revealed that 4 of these mAbs were IgMs (mAbs 15, 37, 43, and 49), whereas the others corresponded to IgG1 type (mAbs 12, 17, 28, and 34) or IgG3 type (mAb 50). In further experiments, we concentrated on the characterization of the IgG1-type and two IgM-type (mAbs 15 and 37) antibodies. The immunoblot presented in Fig. 1 shows that mAbs 12, 17, 28, and 34 recognize the recombinant protein Nt-abp1 purified from bacterial extracts (lane 1) as well as the maize protein purified from maize coleoptiles (lane 2). mAbs 12 and 28 recognize the maize protein as well as the tobacco protein. The ability of mAb 17 and mAb 34 to detect Zm-abp1 appears to be lower than for Nt-abp1, which suggests that the epitopes recognized by these two mAbs are not strictly conserved in Zm-abp1. The interactions between Nt-abp1 and mAbs have been studied using surface plasmon resonance. This method enables real-time measurements of the biospecific interactions, as shown in the resulting sensorgrams (Fig.1, B and C). mAbs 12, 17, 28, and 34 bound rapidly to the immobilized Nt-abp1 protein, as shown by the slope of the curves (Fig. 1 B) (31Karlsson R. Roos H. FaÌgerstam L. Persson B. Abelson J.N. Simon M.I. Methods: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology. Vol. 6. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1994: 99-110Google Scholar). The koffvalues calculated from dissociation phases ranged from 3 Ã 10â5 to 10â5m evincing a stable interaction of each mAb with Nt-abp1. No significant change of the interaction was observed when assayed at pH 5.7; conditions were similar to the electrophysiological experiments. Surface plasmon resonance was used to monitor the binding of two distinct mAbs to establish the interference map of the different monoclonal antibody epitopes on Nt-abp1. The binding matrix shown in Fig.2 A results from interference experiments such as the one illustrated in Fig. 2 B, which shows an overlay plot of two sensorgrams on immobilized Nt-abp1. The three consecutive injections of the first mAb, here mAb 34, allowed a saturation of the corresponding epitope. The capture of mAb 12 to the protein was not affected by prior binding of mAb 34, indicating that mAb 12 and mAb 34 do not interfere and recognize distant epitopes, whereas the capture of mAb 17 was reduced by about 80%. The interference between mAb 34 and mAb 17 demonstrates that their surfaces of interaction with the protein are overlapping. The interference map shown in Fig. 2 C results from these analyses. Each oval schematizes the surface of interaction of one mAb to the protein Nt-abp1. Taken together, the surfaces of interaction are distinct but form a large cluster. Inside of this cluster, the surfaces of interaction defined for mAb 17 and mAb 34 are closely overlapping, as also for mAb 15 and mAb 37, whereas the surfaces of interaction recognized by mAb 28, mAb 34, and mAb 37, and consequently their corresponding epitopes, are totally independent from one another. Within the cluster, mAb 12 fills a central position as it partially overlaps with the other three groups of independent mAbs. Further characterization of interactions of the different mAbs with Nt-abp1 was performed using a series of synthetic peptides covering part of the Nt-abp1 sequence (Fig. 3 A). BIAcore technology was used for this analysis either by checking the direct recognition of the mAbs to the individual synthetic peptides immobilized on a sensor chip or by investigating the effect of these peptides on the interaction of the mAbs to the whole protein. The two distinct procedures are illustrated in Figs.4 and 5 for mAb 12 and mAb 37, respectively. The sensorgrams shown in Fig.4 A illustrate the direct capture of mAb 12 on the immobilized peptides A, C, or C-term. mAb 12 associated slowly with the peptide A and even more slowly with the C-term peptide but in both cases the association was stable as no dissociation was observed after washing. Binding of mAb 12 to pep C was extremely rapid but was counteracted by dissociation as the interaction was unstable. To evaluate the relative efficiency of interaction between mAb 12, the protein, and the different peptides, we compared the number of mAb 12 RU bound in 6 min of injection to each captor taking into account the amount of protein or peptide immobilized on the matrix and the molecular weight of the interacting molecules (Fig. 4 B). The ratio of mAb 12 IgG bound to immobilized protein or peptide, expressed in mole/mole, is 25â150-fold higher with the whole protein than with each interacting synthetic peptide.Figure 4Interaction of mAb 12 with three synthetic peptides corresponding to box A, box C, and the C-terminal domain (A) of Nt-abp1 covalently linked to CM-dextran through amino groups. Resonance signals (RU) were plotted as a function of time. The association phases were followed through 300 s, after which the injection of mAb 12 was stopped and the dissociation phase in continuous buffer flow was monitored for 100 s. B,relative efficiencies of mAb 12 binding to the protein and the different peptides. Crude RU numbers of immobilized Nt-abp1 or synthetic peptide and captured mAb 12 are given. The ratio corresponds to the mole number of bound immunoglobulin mAb 12/mole number of covalently immobilized peptide on each sensorchip. Molecular mass used for the calculation were: IgG1 mAb 12 (150,000 Da), Nt-abp1 (22,000 Da), pep A and pep C (2400 Da), pep B and pepC-ter (2000 Da).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5Interaction of mAb 37 with Nt-abp1 (A) and the two synthetic peptides corresponding to box C (B) and box B (C andD) of the protein. mAb 37 was injected alone (*) or in the presence of a 10-fold excess of peptides B or C on the different sensor chips.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Competitive binding assays of mAbs in the presence of an excess of synthetic peptide are illustrated for mAb 37 (Fig. 5). The addition of peptides B or C to mAb 37 produced a strong reduction of mAb 37 capture on the immobilized Nt-abp1 (Fig. 5 A), indicating that both interact specifically with the site of recognition. Both peptides decreased the score of mAb 37 binding to the immobilized peptide B (Fig. 5, C and D), whereas peptide B competed poorly with the interaction between mAb 37 and the immobilized peptide C (Fig. 5 B). Direct binding of mAb 37 (not shown) proved that its interaction with peptide C is stronger than with peptide B, which explains the differences observed in the competitive binding assays. The two peptides therefore interact specifically with mAb 37 and constitute part of the corresponding epitope. Similar results were obtained with mAb 15 (data not shown) thus confirming the proximity of mAb 15 and mAb 37 epitopes as indicated in Fig. 2, A andC. Fig. 3 B summarizes the results of the direct and competitive assays. All the mAbs exhibited a stronger interaction with the whole protein than with the individual synthetic peptides. Different mAbs bound independently one or a number of synthetic peptides (as shown for mAb 12 or 37 in Figs. 4 and 5, respectively) with the exception of mAb 28 for which no direct binding was detected. However, a slight effect of the C-terminal peptide was observed in competitive binding of mAb 28 on Nt-abp1. Auxin modifies the transmembrane electrical potential of isolated tobacco mesophyll protoplasts according to an inverted bell-shaped dose-response curve with a maximal hyperpolarization at 3 Ã 10â6m NAA (30Ephritikhine G. Barbier-Brygoo H. Muller J.F. Guern J. Plant Physiol. ( Bethesda ). 1987; 83: 801-804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The auxin electrical membrane response of tobacco mesophyll protoplasts has been used as a specific assay to check the effects of the 9 isolated mAbs to Nt-abp1. When tested at 10â8m immunoglobulin, all mAbs were shown to interfere with the hyperpolarization response (data not shown). Immunoglobulin concentrations ranging from 10â12 to 10â8m have been investigated in the presence or in the absence of the optimal auxin concentration. Two kinds of effects have been observed as illustrated in Figs.6 and7.Figure 7Effects of mAb 37 on the transmembrane potential of tobacco mesophyll protoplasts. Tobacco mesophyll protoplasts were incubated for 5 min at room temperature in the presence of mAb 37 (â), or nonspecific antibodies (â ). Measurements of Em values of 15 individual protoplasts were performed in each condition. In dose-response curves,Em variations (ÎEm) obtained in one representative experiment of three are plotted as a function of antibody concentrations in the external medium. Standard errors did not exceed 0.4 mVView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) mAb 12 does not modify the membrane potential of tobacco protoplasts when applied alone (Fig. 6). The preincubation of protoplasts with mAb 12 prior to the addition of 3 Ã 10â6mNAA in the medium results in an inhibition of the auxin-induced response, increasing linearly between 10â12 and 10â10m IgG. In the presence of 10â9m IgG, hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane could no longer be induced by NAA. Similar effects have been obtained using mAb 17 or mAb 34 but both seem to be less efficient than mAb 12, because in the presence of 10â8m IgG, the hyperpolarizing effect of auxin on the electrical membrane response is not totally inhibited (not shown). Whatever the efficiencies, these mAbs are antagonists of auxin action in this specific auxin response of tobacco protoplasts. In the absence of NAA in the medium, mAb 37 is able to induce a hyperpolarization of the protoplast plasma membrane (Fig. 7). The maximum hyperpolarization is reached for 10â10m of mAb 37 and is followed by a relative depolarization of the plasma membrane for higher immunoglobulin concentrations. These effects result in a bell-shaped dose-response curve sharing similar characteristics to those of the auxin response (10Barbier-Brygoo H. Ephritikhine G. KlaÌmbt D. Ghislain M. Guern J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 891-895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nonspecific IgM, tested as a control in the same concentration range, has no effect on the membrane potential. mAb 28 (not shown), an IgG1, as well as mAb 37 mimic auxin action on the electrical membrane response of tobacco protoplasts.

https://openalex.org/W2085528344,"We examined the effect of bicarbonate on the peroxidase activity of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1), using the nitrite anion as a peroxidase probe. Oxidation of nitrite by the enzyme-bound oxidant results in the formation of the nitrogen dioxide radical, which was measured by monitoring 5-nitro-Î³-tocopherol formation. Results indicate that the presence of bicarbonate is not required for the peroxidase activity of SOD1, as monitored by the SOD1/H2O2-mediated nitration of Î³-tocopherol in the presence of nitrite. However, bicarbonate enhanced SOD1/H2O2-dependent oxidation of tocopherols in the presence and absence of nitrite and dramatically enhanced SOD1/H2O2-mediated oxidation of unsaturated lipid in the presence of nitrite. These results, coupled with the finding that bicarbonate protects against inactivation of SOD1 by H2O2, suggest that SOD1/H2O2 oxidizes the bicarbonate anion to the carbonate radical anion. Thus, the amplification of peroxidase activity of SOD1/H2O2 by bicarbonate is attributed to the intermediary role of the diffusible oxidant, the carbonate radical anion. We conclude that, contrary to a previous report (Sankarapandi, S., and Zweier, J. L. (1999) J. Biol.

The peroxidase activity of SOD1 was determined using the electron spin resonance (ESR) technique to monitor the oxidation of spin trap 5,5â²-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) to the DMPO-hydroxyl radical adduct (DMPO-OH).

These small molecular weight anionic ligands are presumed to be oxidized by the oxidant formed at the active site of SOD1. The oxidizing potential of this putative SOD-Cu2+-âOH species is similar to that of the âfreeâ hydroxyl radical, which is considerably higher than those associated with conventional peroxidases (4Singh R.J.

COâ¨ª3, although less reactive than the hydroxyl radical, is a more selective oxidant that may diffuse over a longer distance, thereby causing oxidative damage to distant biological targets (9Adams G.E.

Our results clearly demonstrate that the bicarbonate anion is not required for the peroxidase activity of SOD1; however, bicarbonate enhances oxidation of Î±- and Î³-tocopherols in the presence and absence of the nitrite anion. In addition, bicarbonate provided protection against H2O2-dependent inactivation of SOD1. Taken together, these data suggest that SOD1 and H2O2 are able to oxidize HCO3â to COâ¨ª3, a more selective oxidant, that leads to amplification of the peroxidase activity of SOD1. Biological implications of the oxidation of HCO3â, a ubiquitous cellular and plasma component, in free radical biology are discussed. SOD1 (bovine) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. 1,2-Dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DLPC) was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Î±-Tocopherol (Î±-TH), Î³-tocopherol (Î³-TH), and H2O2were obtained from Sigma. Î±-TQ was synthesized as previously reported (11Hogg N. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. Arch. Biochem.

NGTH was synthesized by incubating Î³-TH (2 mm) with ONOOâ (2 mm) in an acetonitrile/methanol mixture (3:1 v/v) for 10 min. NGTH was extracted with heptane and purified by HPLC. Liposomes were synthesized from DLPC (16Singh R.J. Feix J.B. Pintar T.J. Girotti A.W. Kalyanaraman B. Photochem. Photobiol. 1991; 53: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Methanolic solutions of Î±-TH, Î³-TH, Î±-TQ, or NGTH were added to the phospholipid, which was then dried down under a stream of nitrogen and placed in a vacuum dessicator overnight. Multilamellar liposomes were prepared by hydration of the dried lipid with phosphate buffer (200 mm, pH 7.4) containing diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) (100 Î¼m) and thorough mixing. Unilamellar liposomes were prepared from the multilamellar liposomes by freeze-thawing five times using liquid nitrogen and extrusion through a 0.2-Î¼m polycarbonate filter (Nucleopore, Pleasanton, CA) five times using an extrusion apparatus (Lipex Biomembranes, Inc., Vancouver, BC). Detection and separation of Î±-TH, Î³-TH, and their oxidation products were performed on a HPLC system equipped with a UV detector. Samples (usually 200 Î¼l) were mixed with water (200 Î¼l) and ethanol (400 Î¼l) and vortexed for 60 s. Heptane (400 Î¼l) was added to the samples and vortex-mixed for an additional 60 s. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 rpm to separate the organic and aqueous phases. The organic layer (top) was removed, dried down under a stream of nitrogen, and stored at â20 Â°C until analysis (<18 h). The samples were dissolved in methanol and analyzed by HPLC. The mobile phase was methanol/water (95:5) for 10 min, graded to 100% methanol over a 5-min period, and followed by 5 min at 100% methanol. The stationary phase was an analytical C18 reversed phase column (Partisil ODS-3, 5-Î¼m particle size, Whatman Inc., Clifton, NJ). UV detection at Î» = 290 nm was used to quantify Î±-TH, Î³-TH, and NGTH levels, and Î» = 266 nm was used to quantify Î±-TQ. SOD1 activity was measured using the ferricytochrome c (cyt c) reduction assay (4Singh R.J. Goss S.P.A. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Briefly, xanthine (0.5 mm) and xanthine oxidase (0.05 units/ml) were incubated with cyt c (20 Î¼m) in phosphate buffer (200 mm, pH 7.4). The rate of cyt c reduction by the superoxide anion was measured in the presence and absence of SOD1. To investigate the effect of HCO3â and NO2â on SOD1 inactivation by H2O2, SOD1 (1 mg/ml) was incubated with H2O2 (1 mm) at 37 Â°C in the presence and absence of HCO3â and NO2â. SOD1 activity was measured after diluting an aliquot (5 Î¼l) of the reaction mixture with 1 ml of the assay mixture (phosphate buffer containing 1 mm DTPA and 1000 units/ml catalase) (18Liochev S.I. Chen L.L. Hallewell R.A. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 352: 237-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of HCO3â on the release of copper and zinc from the enzyme during H2O2-mediated SOD1 inactivation, SOD1 (1 mg/ml) was incubated with H2O2 (1 mm) in Chelex-treated phosphate buffer (200 mm, pH 7.4) at 37 Â°C in the presence of 4-pyridylazaresorcinol (PAR, 100 Î¼m). The change in absorbance due to Cu2+- and Zn2+-PAR complex formation was followed for 3 h at 500 nm. The amount of zinc released during this process was calculated by adding 1.6 mm of nitrilotriacetic acid at the end of the reaction. The decrease in absorbance corresponds to Zn2+-nitrilotriacetic acid complex formation (19Crow J.P. Sampson J.B. Zhuang Y. Thompson J.A. Beckman J.S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1936-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The amount of copper released during this process was calculated by the subsequent addition of 0.8 mmEDTA to the incubation mixture as previously reported (19Crow J.P. Sampson J.B. Zhuang Y. Thompson J.A. Beckman J.S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1936-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The molar extinction coefficient of the Cu2+- and Zn2+-PAR complex remained unchanged up to 250 mm HCO3â. The formation of Î±-tocopheroxyl (Î±-Tâ) and 5-nitro-Î³-tocopheroxyl (NGTâ) radicals was monitored by ESR (4Singh R.J. Goss S.P.A. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

ESR measurements were performed at ambient temperature using a Varian E-109 spectrometer operating at 9.5 GHz (X-band) and 100 kHz field modulation. A typical incubation for ESR experiments consisted of SOD1 (10 mg/ml), H2O2(10 mm); bicarbonate (25 mm); and Î±-TH, Î³-TH, or NGTH (2 mm) incorporated into DLPC liposomes (100 mm) in 0.25 ml of phosphate buffer (200 mm, pH 7.4) containing DTPA (100 Î¼m). The reaction was initiated by the addition of H2O2. Samples were immediately analyzed in a quartz flat cell. l-Î±-Lecithin liposomes (250 Î¼g/ml) were incubated with SOD1 (0.2 mg/ml) and H2O2 (1 mm) in Chelex-treated phosphate buffer (200 mm, pH 7.4) with the transition metal ion chelator DTPA (100 Î¼m) at 37 Â°C. The changes in absorbance were continuously monitored at 234 nm to detect the formation of conjugated dienes (21Goss S.P. Hogg N. Kalyanaraman B. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1995; 8: 800-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Î±-TH and Î³-TH were used as probes to monitor the peroxidase activity of SOD1 in the presence of H2O2 (4Singh R.J. Goss S.P.A. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12912-12917Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In order to limit CO2contamination, all solutions were degassed and stored in a nitrogen glove box. After a minimum of 48 h, experiments were performed in the nitrogen glove box. A buffer concentration of 200 mmphosphate was used to prevent changes in pH after the addition of bicarbonate solutions. The pH was determined both before and after the termination of all reactions to ensure that the bicarbonate effect was not due to pH changes. Fig. 1 shows typical HPLC traces obtained when analyzing large unilamellar DLPC liposomes containing Î±-TH, Î³-TH, NGTH, or Î±-TQ (structures shown in insets). Fluorescence detection (Î»ex = 275 nm, Î»em = 320 nm) was used to detect both Î³-TH (B) and Î±-TH (D) with retention times of 13.7 and 15.9 min, respectively. NGTH (A), the nitration product of Î³-TH, was observed to have a retention time of 18.0 min at 290 nm. Î±-TQ (C), the two-electron oxidation product of Î±-TH, was observed to have a retention time of 11.4 min at 266 nm. All peaks were verified using authentic standards. The time course of SOD1/H2O2/NO2â-mediated Î±-TH depletion is shown in Fig.2 A. Î±-TH was incubated with SOD1 (1 mg/ml), H2O2 (1 mm), and NO2â (1 mm) in phosphate buffer (200 mm, pH 7.4) containing DTPA (100 Î¼m). Approximately 10 Î¼m Î±-TH was consumed during the first hour of incubation, after which tocopherol depletion occurred at a slower rate (5 Î¼m during the next hour and 6 Î¼m over the next 3 h). This result can be explained in terms of the reaction between Î±-TH and NO2â by SOD1/H2O2 (4Singh R.J. Goss S.P.A. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12912-12917Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The addition of HCO3â to this system markedly enhanced Î±-TH oxidation and Î±-TQ formation. When 3 mm HCO3â was added to the solution, little change in Î±-TH consumption occurred during the first hour. However, by the fourth hour of incubation, a small increase in consumption was observed. With increasing HCO3â concentration, a significant increase in Î±-TH consumption (Fig. 2 A) and Î±-TQ formation (Fig. 2 B) was observed at each time point. Fig. 2 C (control, t = 0 h) shows the effect of the presence or absence of NO2â and HCO3â on SOD1/H2O2-mediated oxidation of Î±-TH depletion. Approximately 60 Î¼m Î³-TH was incubated with SOD1 (1 mg/ml) in the presence of H2O2 (1 mm). After 4 h (control, t = 4 h), Î±-TH levels remained constant. The addition of NO2â (1 mm) resulted in the consumption of approximately 20 Î¼m Î±-TH, and the formation of 15 Î¼m Î±-TQ, the two-electron oxidation product of Î±-TH. This clearly demonstrates that the peroxidase activity of SOD1/H2O2 is not dependent on the presence of HCO3â. However, the presence of both NO2â and HCO3â resulted in the consumption of 45 Î¼m Î±-TH, with a further increase in Î±-TQ formation. When HCO3â (20 mm) alone was added, approximately 20 Î¼m Î±-TH was consumed; however, in this case, Î±-TQ formation was negligible. Further investigation is required to fully characterize the product(s) formed from the oxidation of Î±-TH by the SOD1/H2O2/HCO3âsystem. The time course of SOD1/H2O2/NO2â-mediated Î³-TH depletion is shown in Fig.3 A. Î³-TH was incubated with SOD1 (1 mg/ml), H2O2 (1 mm), and NO2â (1 mm) in phosphate buffer (200 mm, pH 7.4) containing DTPA (100 Î¼m). Approximately 15 Î¼m Î³-TH was consumed during the first hour of incubation, after which tocopherol depletion occurred at a slower rate (10 Î¼m during the next 3 h). As before (cf. Fig. 2 A), the addition of HCO3â caused a significant increase in Î³-TH consumption at each time point. The effect of HCO3â on SOD1/H2O2/NO2â-mediated NGTH formation is shown in Fig. 3 B. Î³-TH was incubated with SOD1 (1 mg/ml), H2O2 (1 mm), and NO2â (1 mm) in phosphate buffer (200 mm, pH 7.4) containing DTPA (100 Î¼m). During the first hour of incubation, approximately 4 Î¼m NGTH was formed. The addition of HCO3â had little effect on NGTH formation. Fig. 3 C shows the effect of the presence or absence of NO2â and HCO3â on Î³-TH depletion and NGTH formation after a 4-h incubation in the presence of SOD1 (1 mg/ml) and H2O2 (1 mm). Approximately 5 Î¼m Î³-TH was consumed over a 4-h period, possibly due to NO2â contamination (as evidenced by a slight increase in the formation of NGTH, control t = 4 h). In the presence of added NO2â (1 mm), 20 Î¼m Î³-TH was consumed, and 10 Î¼m NGTH was formed. In the presence of HCO3â (20 mm), 20 Î¼m Î³-TH was also consumed, but NGTH formation was negligible. When both HCO3â and NO2â were present, approximately 90% of Î³-TH was consumed, with a concomitant formation of approximately 8 Î¼m NGTH. This paradoxical result (i.e.enhanced Î³-TH depletion and decreased NGTH formation) can be explained if COâ¨ª3 also caused the oxidation of NGTH. These reactions suggest that HCO3â is not required for SOD1/H2O2/NO2â-mediated nitration of Î³-TH. The presence of HCO3â, however, enhanced the oxidation of Î³-TH and possibly NGTH. To probe the involvement of tocopheroxyl radical during HCO3â-enhanced oxidation of tocopherols, we used direct ESR. The addition of H2O2 (10 mm) to an incubation mixture containing Î±-TH (2 mm) and SOD1 (10 mg/ml) produced a seven-line ESR spectrum (Fig.4 A, a) characteristic of the Î±-Tâ radical. In the presence of HCO3â, there was a marked increase in signal intensity (Fig. 4 A, b). Due to a decreased signal-to-noise ratio, a high modulation amplitude was used that restricted our ability to resolve couplings from the methyl protons at carbon-8 and methylene protons at carbon-4. The computer simulation of the Î±-Tâ radical is shown in Fig. 4 A, c( aCH35(3H) = 5.66 G; aCH37(3H) = 4.49 G) (20Kalyanaraman B. Darley-Usmar V.M. Wood J. Joseph J. Parthasarathy S. J. Biol.

When either SOD1 or H2O2 was excluded, there was no detectable ESR signal (data not shown). Incubation of DLPC liposomes containing NGTH with SOD1/H2O2 produced a four-line spectrum (Fig.4 B, a) with a 1:3:3:1 intensity ratio, typical for an electron interacting with three equivalent protons. The addition of 25 mm HCO3â resulted in the enhancement of this signal (Fig. 4 B, b). The computer simulation of this spectrum (dotted lines) is shown in Fig. 4 B, c( aCH37(3H) = 4.35 G). At this high modulation, the nitrogen coupling could not be resolved. DLPC liposomes containing Î±-TH (60 Î¼m) were incubated with SOD1 (1 mg/ml) and H2O2 (1 mm). Fig. 4 C shows HPLC traces of samples incubated in the absence (Fig. 4 C, a, 58 Â± 1 Î¼m Î±-TH) or presence (Fig. 4 C,b, 39 Â± 2 Î¼m Î±-TH) of HCO3â (25 mm) after a 4-h incubation at 37 Â°C. Incubation of DLPC liposomes containing NGTH (25 Î¼m) with SOD1 (1 mg/ml) and H2O2 (1 mm) at 37 Â°C for 4 h resulted in a reduction in NGTH concentration to 20 Â± 1 Î¼m in the absence of HCO3â (Fig. 4 D,a) and to 14 Â± 1 Î¼m in the presence of HCO3â (25 mm, Fig.4 D, b). The ESR and HPLC results clearly demonstrate that the HCO3â anion enhanced SOD1/H2O2-mediated oxidation of tocopherolsvia a radical-mediated pathway. It is likely that an oxidant, possibly the COâ¨ª3 radical derived from the SOD1/H2O2-catalyzed oxidation of HCO3â anion, is responsible for the increased oxidation of tocopherols. SOD1/H2O2/HCO3â- and SOD1/H2O2/NO2â-mediated lipid peroxidation were monitored by measuring conjugated diene formation at 234 nm in l-Î±-lecithin liposomes containing DTPA (100 Î¼m). Conjugated diene formation was minimal during the incubation of liposomes in the presence of SOD1 (200 Î¼g/ml) and H2O2 (1 mm) in the absence of either HCO3â or NO2â (Fig.5). The addition of NO2â (1 mm) resulted in an increase in absorbance at 234 nm, corresponding to the formation of conjugated dienes as a function of time. HCO3â (25 mm) significantly enhanced conjugated diene formation in the presence of NO2â. Fig.6 A (inset) shows the rate of superoxide-dependent cyt creduction, monitored as an increase in absorbance at 550 nm (a). In the presence of SOD1, the increase in absorbance was inhibited (f). After incubation of SOD1 with H2O2 for 4 h, SOD1-mediated inhibition of cyt c reduction was less effective (b). The presence of HCO3â (c), NO2â (d), or HCO3â and NO2â (e) prevented the inactivation of SOD1 by H2O2. SOD1 activity was calculated from the initial rate of cyt c reduction and is shown as a percentage of the rates of cyt c observed in the absence (a) or in the presence (f) of SOD1 (n = 3 Â± S.D.). Inactivation of SOD1 was accompanied by the release of copper and zinc from the active site as determined by the PAR assay. NO2â (1 mm) and/or HCO3â (20 mm) inhibited the release of copper and zinc during H2O2-mediated inactivation of SOD1 (Fig. 6 B). The oxidative inactivation of SOD1 caused by H2O2 has been attributed to the âperoxidase activityâ (2Hodgson E.K. Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5299-5303Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 3Hodgson E.K. Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5294-5299Crossref Scopus (682) Google Scholar). This âperoxidase activityâ results in the generation of a highly potent, âsite-specificâ hydroxyl radical-like species that inactivates the enzyme by oxidative attack on a histidine residue (His-61) at the active site (24Sato K.

The putative oxidant, SOD-Cu2+-âOH, reacts with several electron donor compounds to form the corresponding radical while protecting the enzyme from oxidative inactivation. HCO3â partially protects against H2O2-induced inactivation of SOD1 and inhibits copper release. This may be attributed to the oxidation of HCO3â to COâ¨ª3 by the enzyme-bound oxidant (2Hodgson E.K. Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5299-5303Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 3Hodgson E.K. Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5294-5299Crossref Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 4Singh R.J. Goss S.P.A.

Biochimie ( Paris ). 1983; 65: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We attribute the increased peroxidase activity of SOD1 (observed in the presence of HCO3â) to the oxidative reactions catalyzed by COâ¨ª3. In contrast to COâ¨ª2, a reducing radical formed from oxidation of the formate anion, COâ¨ª3 is an oxidizing radical (28Popp J.C. Kalyanaraman B. Kirk T.K. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10475-10480Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 29Adams G.E. Wilson R.L. Trans. Faraday. Soc. 1969; 65: 2981-2987Crossref Google Scholar). For example, COâ¨ª2 reacts with O2 to form Oâ¨ª2, whereas COâ¨ª3 does not react with O2. While COâ¨ª2reduces âNO to NOâ, COâ¨ª3 oxidizesâNO to NO2â (30Czapski G. Holcman J. Bielski B.H.J. J.

COâ¨ª3forms a conjugate acid and base form, and this radical is mostly unprotonated and exists as an anion at physiological pH levels (31Bisby R.H. Johnson S.A. Parker A.W. Tavender S.M. J. Chem.

We attribute this to a fast electron transfer reaction between COâ¨ª3 and NO2â that results in the formation of NO2â (33Lilie J. Hanrahan R.J. Henglein A. Radiat. Phys.

Alternatively, NO2âreacts with the linoleate-type fatty acid (k = 105 to 106mâ1sâ1) to form the lipid-conjugated diene. COâ¨ª3 can participate in electron transfer reactions, addition, or hydrogen abstraction reactions (9Adams G.E. Aldrich J.E. Bisby R.H. Cundall R.B. Redpath J.L. Willson R.L. Radiat.

COâ¨ª3 reacts rapidly with tyrosine (Tyr-OH), tryptophan, and other phenolic compounds (k = 107 to 108mâ1 sâ1) to form the corresponding phenoxyl radicals (35Chen S.N. Hoffman M.Z. Radiat.

Hoffman M.Z. Radiat. Res. 1973; 56: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Reactions similar to those discussed above may explain the HCO3â-induced increase in formation of DMPO-OH and ABTS radical cation (ABTSâ¨¥) observed in the SOD1/H2O2 system (1Sankarapandi S. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1226-1232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The DMPOâ¨¥ cation radical has been postulated as an intermediate (7Jewett S.L. Rocklin A.M. Ghanevati M. Abel J.M. Marach J.A. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 905-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 36Singh R.J. Karoui H. Gunther M.R. Beckman J.S. Mason R.P. Kalyanaraman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6675-6680Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The DMPOâ¨¥ will undergo hydrolysis to form DMPO-OH. This proposal is in agreement with our previous spin trapping investigation in oxygen-17-enriched water and H2O2 (36Singh R.J. Karoui H. Gunther M.R. Beckman J.S. Mason R.P. Kalyanaraman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6675-6680Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To determine the source of the oxygen atom in the DMPO-OH adduct, we used oxygen-17-enriched hydrogen peroxide ([17O]-H2O2) and water ([17O]-H2O). The reaction of SOD1 with [17O]-H2O2 in HCO3â/CO2 buffer yielded 63% DMPO-17OH and 37% DMPO-16OH. In contrast, the relative concentrations of DMPO-17OH and DMPO-16OH formed in the Fenton reaction were 90 and 10%, respectively. Since the commercial [17O]H2O2 contained 89%17O-labeled H2O2, nearly all of the DMPO-OH formed in the Fenton reaction originated from H2O2. 2There is no 17O exchange between DMPO-16OH and H217O or H217O2 (36Singh R.J. Karoui H. Gunther M.R. Beckman J.S. Mason R.P. Kalyanaraman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6675-6680Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The commercially available [17O]H2O2 has been kept in [16O]H2O without evidence of exchange for years. In contrast, nearly 35% of DMPO-OH arises from the incorporation of oxygen from water in the SOD1/H2O2 reaction. These results were further confirmed using a different spin trap, 5-diethoxyphosphoryl-5-methyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (36Singh R.J. Karoui H. Gunther M.R. Beckman J.S. Mason R.P. Kalyanaraman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6675-6680Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These results do not support the model previously proposed for HCO3â-assisted hydroxylation of DMPO at the active site of SOD1 (1Sankarapandi S. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1226-1232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Based on that model, one would have expected 100% incorporation of H2O2-derived oxygen into DMPO-OH. The COâ¨ª2 radical formed during SOD1/H2O2-catalyzed oxidation of the formate anion has been spin-trapped with DMPO to give a DMPO- COâ¨ª2adduct, which gave a characteristic ESR spectrum (28Popp J.C. Kalyanaraman B. Kirk T.K. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10475-10480Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In contrast, the addition of SOD1 to an incubation mixture containing DMPO, H2O2, HCO3â, and DTPA enhanced DMPO-OH formation (1Sankarapandi S. Zweier J.L. J. Biol.

Recently, using a rapid mixing continuous flow ESR, COâ¨ª3production from peroxynitrite and carbon dioxide was detected at physiological pH levels (32Bonini M.G. Radi R. Ferrer-Sueta G.

Cosgrove T.P. Beckman J.S. Freeman B.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The CO2-peroxynitrite reaction facilitated the nitration and oxidation of tyrosine (39Lemercier J.N. Padmaja S. Cueto R. Squadrito G.L. Uppu R.M. Pryor W.A. Arch. Biochem.

HCO3â is abundant in biological systems. The plasma concentration of HCO3â is approximately 25 mm (50Levinski A.M. Maral J. Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine. 13th Ed. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1983Google Scholar). Recently, an extracellular SOD1 has been identified in atherogenesis (51Fukai T. Galis Z.S. Meng X.P. Parthasarathy S. Harrison D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2101-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The peroxidase activity of this extracellular SOD1 has been suggested to play an important role in the oxidative modification of lipid. This activity may be amplified in the presence of HCO3â. There is emerging evidence that links familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis to mutations in the gene encoding cytosolic SOD1 (52Siddique T. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1996; 61: 699-708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutations in SOD1 induce a gain in function that is associated with increased peroxidase activity (53Wideau-Pazos M. Goto J.J. Rabizadeh S. Gralla E.B. Roe J.A. Lee M.K. Valentine J.S. Bredesen D.E. Science. 1996; 271: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). HCO3â may influence the radical reactions catalyzed by these mutations of SOD1. Regulation of oxidative reactions by HCO3â in other physiologically relevant inflammatory processes (e.g.myeloperoxidase) may also be important (54Eiserich J.P. Hristova M. Cross C.E. Jones A.D.

Chem. 1999; 274: 1226-1232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), evidence presented in this study strongly suggests that HCO3â is not an absolute requirement for eliciting the peroxidase activity of SOD1. However, HCO3â enhances the peroxidase activity of SOD1 by acting as a âsacrificialâ electron donor and in so doing forms a COâ¨ª3 radical intermediate, a selective yet potent biological oxidant. The involvement of COâ¨ª3 in biological oxidation seems more ubiquitous (56Wolcott R.G. Franks B.J. Hannum D.M. Hurst J.K. J. Biol.

These molecules have central roles in contraction or its regulation, suggesting that abnormal contraction of the heart leads to the clinical, histological, and morphological manifestations of FHC. Strong support for this conclusion comes from three related types of observations: (i) purified mutant proteins retain many of their basic functions but display kinetic or other abnormalities that would be expected to alter muscle contraction (6Cuda G.

McKenna W.J. Thierfelder L. Suk H.J. Anan R. O'Donoghue A. Spirito P. Matsumori A. Moravec C.S. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1058-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). Like the abnormalities in other genes that cause this syndrome, the troponin T mutations occur widely throughout the sequence, are generally missense or point deletions, and occasionally are premature truncations. Although there is less severe hypertrophy in kindreds with the troponin T mutations than is observed in other FHC patients, these kindreds show a high incidence of sudden death and have mortality rates as high as those accompanying the most severe mutations in the myosin heavy chain gene (1Watkins H. McKenna W.J. Thierfelder L. Suk H.J. Anan R. O'Donoghue A. Spirito P. Matsumori A. Moravec C.S. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1058-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that the contraction abnormalities resulting from troponin T mutations may differ from those found in FHC more generally. The troponin T mutations were first reported in 1994 and 1995 (1Watkins H. McKenna W.J. Thierfelder L. Suk H.J. Anan R. O'Donoghue A. Spirito P. Matsumori A. Moravec C.S. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1058-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 2Thierfelder L. Watkins H. MacRae C. Lamas R. McKenna W. Vosberg H.-P. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 701-712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar), and since then some experimental information has emerged concerning their properties and effects. The troponin T mutation best characterized at the level of the purified protein is the missense mutant Ile79 â Asn. Troponin containing a rat recombinant form of this mutation functioned normally in many respects but had the unexpected effect of increasing the speed that thin filaments slide over a myosin fragment-coated surface (8Lin D. Bobkova A. Homsher E. Tobacman L.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2842-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This was not anticipated from the known properties of troponin T and was different from the characteristic consequences of FHC-causing mutations in the cardiac myosin heavy chain gene. More recently it has been shown that this same troponin T mutation decreases the force that is exerted by myosin (13Sweeney H.L. Feng H.S. Yang Z. Watkins H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14406-14410Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). When overexpressed in quail myotubes, two other troponin T mutations also decrease force, and a different mutation increases the unloaded shortening speed (12Watkins H.C. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Feng H.S. Sweeney H.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2456-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 13Sweeney H.L. Feng H.S. Yang Z. Watkins H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14406-14410Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, information about these and other mutants is limited, so the overall picture remains unclear. Troponin T is highly elongated and interacts with all the other polypeptides of the thin filament: tropomyosin, actin, and the other two troponin subunits, troponin I and troponin C (see Ref. 19Tobacman L.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 447-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar for review). Therefore, there are many possibilities for how the mutations could alter function. To characterize the functional properties of the troponin T mutations present in FHC, we now report effects of mutations introduced into bovine cardiac troponin T via mutagenesis of cDNA isolated from a bovine heart cDNA library. Four new functional abnormalities were identified using the bacterially expressed mutant proteins. One of the FHC mutants increased the calcium affinity of the troponin C binding site that regulates cardiac contraction. Another mutation decreased the thin filament-myosin subfragment 1 MgATPase rate and increased in vitro sliding speed, implying impaired myosin cross-bridge function. Several mutants caused either weakened binding of troponin to the thin filament or impaired troponin solubility, abnormalities that may affect the relative incorporation of normal and mutant troponin Ts into the thin filaments of heterozygous patients. The results are discussed for their significance regarding both FHC pathophysiology and the normal functions of troponin T in muscle contraction. Bovine heart cDNA was isolated from a bovine heart cDNA library in the Unizap XR vector system (Stratagene). The library, created from the heart of a 2-year-old animal, was screened by colony hybridization using a primer obtained by nick translation of a rat cardiac troponin T cDNA template (20Jin J.-P. Lin J.J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14471-14477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hybridization was done at 65 Â°C in the presence of 6Ã SSC, 20 mm NaH2PO4, 0.4% SDS, 10 Î¼g/Î¼l salmon sperm DNA, 200,000 cpm/ml probe. After primary and secondary screening the positive plaques were excised using the Stratagene Unizap excision protocol resulting in pBluescript SK vectors containing the library inserts. Clones were then screened by restriction digest. Five clones large enough to contain the bovine cardiac troponin T sequence were chosen. Sequencing was performed, with primer walking where necessary, by the dideoxy chain termination method (21Greene L.E. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2120-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). All of the isolates were found to have open reading frames encoding portions of bovine cardiac troponin T, as previously characterized by protein sequencing methods (22Leszyk J. Dumaswala R. Potter J.D. Gusev N.B. Verin A.D. Tobacman L.S. Collins J.H. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7035-7042Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Different isolates encoded regions defining the two known isoforms, which differ by the presence or absence of residues 15â19 (22Leszyk J. Dumaswala R. Potter J.D. Gusev N.B. Verin A.D. Tobacman L.S. Collins J.H. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7035-7042Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The longer isoform is predominant in the bovine heart and was used for mutagenesis. To obtain the entire coding region, fragments from two isolates were subcloned into pSP72 and combined. The protein sequence deduced from the troponin T cDNA agreed with the published protein sequence, with one discrepancy. The codon for Glu42 is missing from the cDNA. Although this portion of the nucleotide sequence is based upon only one cDNA isolate, we do not believe it is an artifact. Alignment with the rat cardiac troponin T genomic sequence (23Jin J.-P. Huang Q.-Q. Yeh H.-I. Lin J.J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 1269-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) indicates that Glu42arises from a split exon at the boundary of exons 5 and 6. An alternative splice acceptor site, shifted by 3 base pairs into exon 6, would produce this result. There is precedent for this from reverse transcription-PCR analysis of human cardiac troponin T (24Townsend P.J. Barton P.J.R. Yacoub M.H. Farza H. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1995; 27: 2223-2236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Also, variable deletions of single Glu residues were found at two sites in the hypervariable region of troponin T (25Breitbart R.E. Andreadis A. Nadal-Ginard B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 467-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) that includes exons 5 and 6, and the splice sites are functionally weak in this region (26Breitbart R.E. Nadal-Ginard B. Cell. 1987; 49: 793-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For the purposes of the present study, it is notable that the protein corresponding to the sequence in Fig. 1 A has functional properties indistinguishable from those of troponin T isolated from the heart (see below). Because the pET expression system (27Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar) was successful in expressing rat cardiac troponin T (8Lin D. Bobkova A. Homsher E. Tobacman L.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2842-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), the same system was used for the bovine protein. In constructing the wild type vector two changes were made at the 5â² end of the troponin T cDNA by PCR mutagenesis. AnAflII site was created at the translation initiation site, producing an end that could be ligated into the NcoI insertion site of pET3d without changing the amino acid sequence. Also, the second codon (Ser) was changed from TCG (infrequent inEscherichia coli) to TCT. The mutagenesis primers were 5â²-AAGGGCCTGGGCTTGGGC-3â² (internal primer) and 5â²-ATAATAATAATCGATGAGGAGGACATGTCTGACGTGGAAGAGGCC-3â² (initiating Met codon is in bold), which includes aClaI site at the 5â² end for ligation into the polylinker of pSP72. PCR was performed with Vent Polymerase (New England Biolabs) for 29 cycles. DNA sequencing confirmed no incidental changes were introduced by PCR. This wild type TnT sequence was then released by digestion with AflII and HindIII (Klenow) and ligated by standard techniques into theNcoI/BamHI (Klenow) site of pET3d. DE3(BL21) were transformed and single colonies grown overnight without subculturing or isopropyl-1-thio-Î²-d-galactopyranoside induction in 500-ml volumes of LB plus ampicillin. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the darkest band in cell homogenates was not present in untransformed cells and comigrated with bovine cardiac troponin T isolated from the heart. The recombinant protein was purified by the same method used previously for rat troponin T (8Lin D. Bobkova A. Homsher E. Tobacman L.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2842-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). From a liter of cell culture the procedure yields 10â20 mg of purified recombinant troponin T. Using PCR-based protocols similar to the one described above, the wild type troponin T in pET3d was altered to produce six different mutations. The human mutations are (with the position in the bovine protein sequence (22Leszyk J. Dumaswala R. Potter J.D. Gusev N.B. Verin A.D. Tobacman L.S. Collins J.H. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7035-7042Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) in parenthesis): R92Q (89), F110I (107), ÎE160 (157), E163K (160), E244D (240), and intron 15 G1â A (COOH truncation of 28 residues). In humans, this last mutation results in two truncated proteins, one missing 14 COOH-terminal residues and the other in which the 28 COOH-terminal residues are replaced by seven novel residues. The bovine cardiac troponin T mutants were expressed and purified as above. To facilitate comparison with other papers, in this manuscript the bovine mutations are referred to by the corresponding position in human troponin T. All experiments were performed with proteins purified to homogeneity. Cardiac tropomyosin, whole troponin, and troponin subunits were obtained from bovine hearts (28Tobacman L.S. Adelstein R.S.

Troponin was also obtained by reconstitution from subunits,i.e. by serial dialysis of 1:1:1 mixtures of troponin I, troponin C, and the various forms of troponin T (29Tobacman L.S. Lee R. J. Biol.

Sawyer D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 931-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The speed of thin filament movement over a heavy meromyosin-coated surface was measured as previously (36Homsher E. Kim B. Bobkova A. Tobacman L.S. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1881-1892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. To diminish troponin-tropomyosin-induced bundling of filaments, rhodamine-phalloidin actin was allowed to bind to the HMM-coated surface in the absence of ATP, washed twice with buffer, and then incubated in the presence of 0.5 Î¼m troponin-tropomyosin for 10 min at room temperature. This solution was then replaced with a solution containing 0.1 Î¼m troponin-tropomyosin, ATP, oxygen-scavenging enzymes, and either pCa5 or pCa9. The effects of the mutations on the affinity of troponin for actin-tropomyosin were determined by modification of a competitive binding assay (42Huynh Q. Butters C.A. Leiden J.M. Tobacman L.S. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1447-1455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). F-actin samples contained identical, saturating amounts of unlabeled tropomyosin and control 3H-labeled cardiac troponin and variable amounts of competing mutant troponin. After centrifugation, displacement of the 3H-labeled troponin from the thin filament was measured by liquid scintillation counting of the supernatants. Control troponin binding is tight (K > 108mâ1) under these conditions (43Dahiya R. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29457-29461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which makes this competitive approach necessary. The ratio (KR) of the affinities of competitor troponin:radiolabeled control troponin for actin-tropomyosin was measured by fitting the data to a simple competition model as in Ref. 44Hinkle A.

The bovine heart is a convenient source for cardiac troponin, because this tissue can be used to purify large amounts of troponin and/or troponin subunits. To procure mutant troponin T subunits that could be combined with TnI and TnC to create nonchimeric troponin complexes, the bovine cardiac troponin T cDNA was isolated. Fig.1 A shows 993 base pairs of bovine cardiac troponin T cDNA, including the entire coding region and partial 5â² and 3â² noncoding region sequences of 51 and 87 base pairs, respectively. The encoded amino acid sequence was consistent with the predominant adult bovine cardiac troponin T isoform, as previously determined by protein sequencing (22Leszyk J. Dumaswala R. Potter J.D. Gusev N.B. Verin A.D. Tobacman L.S. Collins J.H. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7035-7042Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The sites of FHC mutations investigated in the present work are indicated in Fig. 1 B. They are distributed widely within the amino acid sequence and in every case are in residues conserved between human and bovine sequences. Between positions 67 and 284 of the bovine sequence, which includes all the identified FHC sites, there are seven relatively conservative differences from the human sequence and 97% identity. Note that many of the troponin T sites implicated in FHC, including the Arg92 mutational âhot spotâ (45Anan R. Shono H. Kisanuki A. Arima S. Nakao S. Tanaka H. Circulation. 1998; 98: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) are within conserved portions of the troponin tail. The troponin tail plays a key role in anchoring troponin-tropomyosin onto actin, both in the Ca2+ conformation of the thin filament and in the inhibitory conformation found in the absence of Ca2+ (19Tobacman L.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 447-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar,30Hill L.E. Mehegan J.P. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol.

Residues 1â184 correspond to rabbit fast skeletal muscle troponin T fragment T1, which binds tightly to tropomyosin (via residues 98â184) and part of which (residues 1â97) spans the tropomyosin-tropomyosin overlap joint (46Fisher D. Wang G. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25455-25460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 47White S.P. Cohen C. Phillips J.G.N.

Troponin T interacts with tropomyosin, TnI, TnC, and probably actin and has a critical role in anchoring the regulatory complex onto the thin filament (19Tobacman L.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 447-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Therefore, alterations in the binding of troponin to the thin filament are potential consequences of the troponin T mutations found in FHC kindreds. To test this, we assembled thin filaments containing actin, tropomyosin, and radiolabeled control troponin and then displaced the troponin by addition of wild type or mutant troponin complexes. Fig.2 A shows a representative experiment for troponin(Îex15â16). Troponin(Îex15â16) lacks troponin T COOH-terminal residues 257â284 but nevertheless is able to displace troponin from the thin filament. The mutant troponin is not as good a competitor as control unlabeled troponin, whether Ca2+ is present (Fig. 2 A, â´versus âª) or Ca2+ is absent (Fig.2 A, âµ versus â ). Interestingly, troponin(Îex15â16) is a better competitor (more displacement) in the presence (â´) than in the absence (âµ) of Ca2+. (This aspect is also shown in Fig. 4). A critical feature in interpreting this is that Ca2+ weakens the binding of the normal, labeled troponin to the thin filament approximately 2-fold (31Mehegan J.P. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 966-972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Huynh Q. Butters C.A. Leiden J.M. Tobacman L.S. Biophys.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25455-25460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 2 A therefore indicate that Ca2+ increases the effectiveness of troponin(Îex15â16) as a binding competitor, because Ca2+ has less of an effect on the mutant troponin than on the radiolabeled (normal) troponin. More precisely, KR (the ratio of the affinities of the two troponins) is 2-fold greater in the presence of Ca2+, increasing from 0.22 to 0.43. This 2-fold effect is the same magnitude as the previously established weakening effect of Ca2+ on the binding of the wild type labeled troponin, so the data imply that Ca2+ has no effect on the binding of troponin(Îex15â16) to the thin filament.Figure 4Effect of troponin T mutations on the affinity of troponin for actin-tropomyosin. Data were obtained from experiments conducted as described in the legend to Fig.2 A and are expressed relative to the affinity of wild type labeled troponin for actin-tropomyosin measured under the same conditions, either the presence (filled bars) or the absence (open bars) of calcium. The affinities of troponins containing the F110I, E244D, and Îex15â16 mutations are significantly different from control (p < 0.01).View Large Image"

These events are preceded by the ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor and its association with SH2-containing signaling enzymes including Src family members (Src), the phosphotyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and phospholipase C-Î³1 (PLCÎ³). In this study, we sought to systematically evaluate the relative roles of the signaling enzymes that are recruited to the Î±PDGFR for DNA synthesis and cell migration. Our approach was to generate and characterize tyrosine to phenylalanine Î±PDGFR mutants that failed to associate with one or more of the above listed signaling enzymes. In a 3T3-like cell line (Ph cells), PDGF-dependent DNA synthesis was strictly dependent on only one of the receptor-associated proteins, PI3K. In contrast, multiple signaling enzymes were required for maximal chemotaxis, as receptors unable to associate with either Src, PI3K, or PLCÎ³ initiated chemotaxis to 4, 47, or 56% of the wild-type level, respectively. Furthermore, coexpression of mutant receptors revealed that these signaling enzymes do not need to be on the same receptor for a cell to respond chemotactically to PDGF. We conclude that for the Î±PDGFR, PI3K plays a major role in initiating DNA synthesis, whereas PI3K, PLCÎ³, and especially Src are required for chemotaxis.

Receptor tyrosine kinases elicit responses such as cell proliferation and migration via binding and activation of Src homology 2 (SH2) 1The abbreviations used are:SH2Src homology 2PDGFplatelet-derived growth factorÎ±PDGFRPDGF Î± receptorPI3Kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinasePLCÎ³ phospholipase C-Î³1WT, wild typeDMEDulbecco's modified Eagle'sPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisErkextracellular signal-regulated kinase domain-containing signaling molecules. Upon ligand binding, receptor tyrosine kinases dimerize and autophosphorylate, and the phosphorylated tyrosines serve as a key component of the docking sites for SH2 domain-containing signal relay enzymes. There are at least several different ways in which signaling enzymes associate with a tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor tyrosine kinase. For the epidermal growth factor receptor, each of the signaling enzymes appears to bind to any one of the phosphorylation sites. The hepatocyte growth factor receptor contains a pair of tyrosine phosphorylation sites, which are required for stable recruitment of at least four signaling enzymes. In contrast, at least some of the signaling enzymes that associate with the Î²PDGFR and the fibroblast growth factor receptor have specific binding sites (1Kazlauskas A. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 1994; 4: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Src homology 2 platelet-derived growth factor PDGF Î± receptor phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase WT, wild type Dulbecco's modified Eagle's polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis extracellular signal-regulated kinase Activation of the Î±PDGFR results in its phosphorylation at numerous tyrosine residues, and eight such phosphorylation sites have been identified (reviewed in Ref. 2Rosenkranz S. Kazlauskas A. Growth Factors. 1999; 16: 201-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). One of the consequences of phosphorylation of the Î±PDGFR is the selective recruitment of SH2-containing signaling enzymes such as Src family members (Src), the phosphotyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and phospholipase C-Î³1 (PLCÎ³). Recent studies have shown that some of the Î±PDGFR-associated proteins are not essential for biological responses such as cell cycle progression. Src family members and SHP-2 are not required for cell proliferation or DNA synthesis (3Gelderloos J.A. Rosenkranz S. Bazenet C. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol.

Interestingly, although PI3K and PLCÎ³ are required for PDGF-dependent DNA synthesis initiated by the Î²PDGFR (6Valius M. Kazlauskas A.

Thus, which, if any, of the recruited signaling molecules is required for mitogenic signal relay from the Î±PDGFR remains an open question. A number of groups (9Yu J.-C. Heidaran M.A. Pierce J.H.

Engagement of the Î±PDGFR promotes chemotaxis in some cell types such as lung fibroblasts, Swiss 3T3 cells, and hematopoietic 32D cells. In other cell types (foreskin fibroblasts, aortic endothelial cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells), PDGF-AA does not promote chemotaxis, but it inhibits the chemotactic response induced by other agents (13Siegbahn A. Hammacher A. Westermark B. Heldin C.-H. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 916-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 14Yokote K. Mori S. Siegbahn A. Ronnstrand L. Wernstedt C Heldin C.-H.

In regard to which of the signaling molecules are involved with PDGF-dependent chemotaxis, PI3K was absolutely required for PDGF-AA-induced migration of NIH3T3 cells; however, it was not required for Î±PDGFR-mediated chemotaxis of hematopoietic 32D cells (9Yu J.-C.

Finally, in transfected porcine aortic endothelial cells, Src family members did not contribute to Î±PDGFR-mediated chemotaxis (4Hooshmand-Rad R. Yokote K. Heldin C.-H. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 607-614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data indicate that PDGF-AA-dependent responses such as cell cycle progression and chemotaxis are highly dependent on the cell type, and the mechanisms by which the Î±PDGFR relays a biological signal remain poorly understood. Therefore, we sought to evaluate systematically the role of each of the signaling enzymes that are recruited to the activated Î±PDGFR for PDGF-dependent DNA synthesis and chemotaxis in a single cell type. Our approach was to generate and characterize tyrosine to phenylalanine Î±PDGFR mutants that failed to associate with one or more of the signaling enzymes and then to compare the ability of the WT and mutant receptors to mediate signal transduction events and biological responses. We found that PDGF-AA-induced DNA synthesis required activation of only one signal relay enzyme, PI3K. In contrast, multiple signaling molecules including Src, PI3K, and PLCÎ³ contributed to Î±PDGFR-mediated chemotaxis. Furthermore, these three signaling enzymes did not necessarily need to be recruited to the same receptor. Ph cells and their maintenance were previously described (3Gelderloos J.A. Rosenkranz S.

The human WT and mutant Î±PDGFRs were stably expressed in Ph cells to approximately 1 Ã 105receptors per cell, using the pLNCX2 retroviral vector (3Gelderloos J.A. Rosenkranz S. Bazenet C.

DNA constructs were transfected into 293GPG cells (19Ory D.S. Neugeboren B.A. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11400-11406Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar), and the viral supernatant was collected for 7 days and concentrated by centrifugation (25,000 Ã g, 90 min, 4 Â°C). The virus was titered, and equal amounts of colony-forming units were used to infect Ph cells. The infected cells were selected in the presence of 1 mg/ml G418, and mass populations of drug-resistant cells were used in all of the experiments. The 1.7-kilobase pairPstI-BamHI fragment of the human Î±PDGFR was subcloned into the pBS+ plasmid, and the resulting construct was called 19E. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis kit. The oligonucleotides used to introduce the phenylalanine changes at Tyr-572/74 and Tyr-720 have been described previously (3Gelderloos J.A. Rosenkranz S. Bazenet C. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol.

To mutate Tyr-742 to phenylalanine, the following oligonucleotide, also introducing aXhoI site, was used: 5â²-CCTCTTTCCTCTCGAGCATGGGGACAAACTGTGTAGT-3â². The following oligonucleotide was used to mutate Tyr-988 to phenylalanine: 5â²-GACACCAATGAATGCATTGTCTGAGTCGACACGCATGCG-3â². This oligonucleotide also introduced a SalI site. The following oligonucleotide was used to introduce the phenylalanine substitution at Tyr-1018: 5â²-GACAGGGTCGATATCAGG-CAGAGGAATGATGAAGCCACTGTC-3â². This oligonucleotide also introduced an EcoRV site. Finally, the following oligonucleotide was used to introduce the arginine substitution at Lys-627: 5â²-TTTTAGCATCCTCACTGCAACTTTCATTACAGGTTGGGA-3â². This oligonucleotide also introduced a BstB1 site. In all cases the introduced restriction site did not alter the amino acid sequence of the receptor. The F7 and add-back mutants were created by subcloning. All mutants were initially identified by restriction enzyme digestion using the introduced restriction sites and then verified by sequencing. The PstI-BamHI fragment of 19E was then subcloned into 18F, which is the full-length human Î±PDGFR (3.5-kilobase pair NotI-BamHI insert) subcloned into pBluescript SKII+ (5Bazenet C. Gelderloos J.A. Kazlauskas A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6926-6936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, theNotI-BamHI fragment from 18F was subcloned into the NotI-BamHI-digested pLNCX2retroviral vector. The rabbit polyclonal Î±PDGFR antibodies recognize either the carboxyl terminus (27P) or a portion of the first immunoglobulin domain (80.8) of the human Î±PDGFR (3Gelderloos J.A. Rosenkranz S. Bazenet C. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5908-5915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The Src-2 antibody used for immunoprecipitation of Src was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and recognizes all three of the Src family members that are expressed in fibroblasts, Src, Yes, and Fyn. For Western blot analysis of Src, a mouse monoclonal antibody, 327 (Oncogene Science Inc.), was used at a 1:1,000 dilution. For anti-phosphotyrosine Western blot analysis, a combination of PY20 (Transduction Laboratories) and 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) each at a 1:5,000 dilution was used. PLCÎ³ Western blot analysis was performed using a mixture of monoclonal anti-PLCÎ³1 antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) at a concentration of 0.25 Î¼g/ml. For Western blot analysis of PI3K, a polyclonal antibody recognizing the p85 subunit of PI3K (kindly provided by Alex Toker) was used at a 1:2,000 dilution. The monoclonal dPTP1D antibody (Transduction Laboratories) was used for Western blot analysis of SHP-2 at a 1:1,000 dilution. For anti-phospho-Erk Western blot analysis, a phospho-specific p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (Thr-202/Tyr-204) antibody purchased from New England Biolabs (catalog number 9101L) was used at a 1:500 dilution. Ph cells expressing the WT or mutant Î±PDGFRs were cultured and stimulated (50 ng/ml PDGF-AA) as described previously (3Gelderloos J.A. Rosenkranz S. Bazenet C. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5908-5915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The Î±PDGFR was immunoprecipitated exactly as described previously (3Gelderloos J.A. Rosenkranz S. Bazenet C. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5908-5915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Î±PDGFR immunoprecipitates representing approximately 3 Ã 106cells were resolved on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel, and the proteins were transferred to Immobilon and subjected to Western blot analysis as described (3Gelderloos J.A. Rosenkranz S. Bazenet C. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5908-5915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To monitor the association between Src and the Î±PDGFR, Src was immunoprecipitated from resting or PDGF-stimulated cells using the Src-2 antibody, and immunoprecipitates representing approximately 3 Ã 106 cells were subjected to anti-Î±PDGFR (80.8 + 27P) or anti-Src (327) Western blot analysis. Activation of Erk was monitored using 30 Î¼g of cleared total cell lysate as described (21DeMali K.A. Kazlauskas A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2014-2022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PI3K assays were performed with immunoprecipitates of Î±PDGFRs exactly as described (20Kazlauskas A. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3279-3286Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), except the silica gel plates were pretreated with 60 mm EDTA, 2% sodium tartrate, and 50% EtOH and dried in a 100 Â°C oven overnight. PDGF-stimulated [3H]thymidine uptake was assayed as follows. Cells were plated at 8 Ã 104 cells/ml in DME containing 5% calf serum in 24-well dishes and incubated at 37 Â°C for 1 h. They were then washed 2Ã in phosphate-buffered saline and arrested in 0.5 ml of DME containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 48 h at 37 Â°C. PDGF buffer or various doses of PDGF-AA were added and incubated for 18â20 h at 37 Â°C. The cells were pulsed for 4 h with [3H]thymidine and harvested as described previously (21DeMali K.A.

The data are expressed as a fold increase over the buffer control. PDGF-dependent chemotaxis was assayed utilizing a 48-well modified Boyden chemotaxis chamber (NeuroProbe Inc., Baltimore, MD) and polyvinyl pyroidone-free polycarbonate filters (8-Î¼m pore size) (Poretics Corp., Livermore, CA) as described previously (22Godwin S.L. Solthoff S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11307-11312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, the lower wells of the chamber were filled with DME + 0.1% calf serum supplemented with 10 ng/ml PDGF-AA or vehicle. The filters were coated with 50 Î¼g/ml rat type I collagen (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA) and fixed atop the bottom wells. Ph cells expressing WT or mutated Î±PDGFRs were trypsinized, washed, and diluted in DME containing 0.1% calf serum to a final concentration of 4 Ã 105 cells per ml, and 50 Î¼l of this cell suspension were placed into the top wells of the chamber. In each experiment, at least 6 of the 48 wells of the chamber were used for each condition examined. The chamber was incubated for 4 h at 37 Â°C in a 5% CO2atmosphere. Following incubation, the chamber was disassembled, and the cells on the upper surface of the filter were removed. The cells on the lower surface were fixed and stained with Diff-Quick (Baxter Healthcare Corp., Miami, FL). Chemotaxis was quantified by counting the number of cells on the lower surface of the filter in each well using a grid containing 100 non-overlapping fields. The total number of cells present in 100 fields was approximately 5â20 in resting or nonresponding cells and between 80 and 150 in responding cells. The response being measured was primarily chemotaxis, since including PDGF in the top and bottom chamber reduced the number of cells migrating through the filter by approximately 70%. Activation of the Î±PDGFR results in its tyrosine phosphorylation at a number of residues. Eight major phosphorylation sites have been identified, and their phosphorylation leads to the recruitment of SH2 domain-containing signaling enzymes such as Src family members (Src), the phosphotyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and phospholipase C-Î³1 (PLCÎ³). To evaluate systematically the role of each of the signaling molecules for Î±PDGFR-mediated cellular responses in a single cell line, we created a series of Î±PDGFR mutants in which the tyrosine residues required for the association of one of the above listed signaling enzymes was mutated to phenylalanine (subtraction mutants) (Fig. 1 A). A second set of Î±PDGFR mutants (add-back mutants) included the F7 receptor, in which all 7 tyrosine phosphorylation sites were mutated, as well as a panel of receptors that have the tyrosine residue(s) required for binding of one of the associated proteins restored (Fig. 1 B). The resulting receptors were expressed in Ph cells, a 3T3-like cell line that expresses normal levels of the Î²PDGFR but no endogenous Î±PDGFR (5Bazenet C. Gelderloos J.A. Kazlauskas A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6926-6936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze the expression levels of the introduced Î±PDGFRs, lysates were prepared from resting or PDGF-stimulated cells, and the samples were subjected to an anti-Î±PDGFR Western blot. As shown in Fig.2 A (subtraction panel) and Fig. 3 A(add-back panel), all cell lines expressed comparable levels of the introduced receptor, which we have previously estimated to be similar to the level of the endogenous Î²PDGFR (23Bazenet C.E. Kazlauskas A. Oncogene. 1993; 9: 517-525Google Scholar).Figure 3Expression levels, tyrosine phosphorylation, and binding characteristics of the add-back panel of Î±PDGFR mutants.

B, PDGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation and association with signaling molecules. The R627 receptor has lysine at position 627 replaced with arginine and has no detectable in vitro kinase activity. C, PDGF-dependent association of the Î±PDGFR with Src. Cells were stimulated and lysed as described in the legend of Fig. 2 B, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with an antiserum that recognizes multiple Src family members (Src-2; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitates were then immunoblotted with anti-Î±PDGFR antiserum (80.8 + 27P) to detect coimmunoprecipitation of the Î±PDGFR (upper panel) or with anti-Src (327) to determine the amount of Src in each of the samples (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate the ligand-induced autophosphorylation of the receptor and PDGF-dependent binding of signaling molecules, the Î±PDGFR was immunoprecipitated from resting or PDGF-stimulated cells, and the samples were subjected to Western blot analysis using antibodies against the Î±PDGFR and against each of the signal relay enzymes. In addition, the receptor blot was stripped and re-probed with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As shown in Figs. 2 B and3 B, PDGF increased the phosphotyrosine content of all the receptors, with the exception of the kinase-inactive receptor mutant (R627). The level of receptor autophosphorylation was not substantially decreased, even in mutants missing up to 7 phosphorylation sites. This may reflect the presence of additional phosphorylation sites or the ability of the receptor to autophosphorylate at cryptic sites. A similar phenomenon is observed with mutants of the Î²PDGFR (24Joly M. Kazlauskas A. Fay F.S. Corvera S. Science. 1994; 263: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the WT Î±PDGFR coimmunoprecipitated with PLCÎ³, the p85 subunit of PI3K, and SHP-2 in a PDGF-dependent manner. No associated proteins were detected in receptor immunoprecipitates from stimulated cells expressing an empty vector (23Bazenet C.E. Kazlauskas A. Oncogene. 1993; 9: 517-525Google Scholar). Mutation of tyrosine 1018 largely reduced binding of PLCÎ³; the F31/42 mutant failed to associate with PI3K (p85), and the F720 mutant did not bind SHP-2 upon PDGF stimulation (Fig. 2 B). We and others (3Gelderloos J.A. Rosenkranz S. Bazenet C. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5908-5915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 4Hooshmand-Rad R. Yokote K. Heldin C.-H. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 607-614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have previously found that the WT receptor associates with Src family members, and this event is dependent on tyrosines 572 and 574 in the juxtamembrane domain of the Î±PDGFR. Although the F72/74 and F720 mutants have been reported elsewhere, they are included in the present study for completeness. Fig. 3 B demonstrates the binding characteristics of the add-back panel of Î±PDGFR mutants. Restoration of the PLCÎ³- and PI3K-binding sites at tyrosines 1018 and 731/42 rescued the PDGF-dependent association with PLCÎ³ and p85, whereas none of the other signal relay enzymes were able to associate with these receptors (Fig. 3 B). We routinely observed that the Y988 mutant associated with trace amounts of PLCÎ³, and this finding agrees with the work of Eriksson et al. (8Eriksson A. Nanberg E. Ronnstrand L. Engstrom U. Hellman U. Rupp E. Carpenter G. Heldin C.-H. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7773-7781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), where the phosphorylation of tyrosine 988 was found to make a minor but reproducible contribution to the overall binding of PLCÎ³ to the Î±PDGFR. As expected, only the WT receptor and the Y72/74 mutant were able to recruit Src family members upon PDGF stimulation (Fig.3 C). A kinase-inactive receptor mutant (R627), which served as a negative control in the biological assays, was not autophosphorylated and failed to associate with either PLCÎ³, p85, or SHP-2 upon PDGF stimulation. No receptor-associated proteins were detected in receptor immunoprecipitates prepared from cells harboring an empty expression vector (23Bazenet C.E. Kazlauskas A. Oncogene. 1993; 9: 517-525Google Scholar). We conclude that binding of PLCÎ³, PI3K, and Src is largely dependent on the tyrosine phosphorylation sites at 1018, 731 and/or 742, and 572 and/or 574, respectively. The association of SHP-2 with the Î±PDGFR appeared to be more complicated than simply binding to tyrosine 720. Whereas binding of SHP-2 was abolished when only tyrosine 720 was mutated, SHP-2 bound to the activated F7 receptor as well as all add-back Î±PDGFR mutants, with the exception of the Y31/42 receptor. This suggests that SHP-2 is able to associate with at least one additional binding site besides tyrosine 720 and, furthermore, that either binding or activation of PI3K prevents SHP-2 binding to this or these additional site(s). Tyrosine 754 (which is close to the PI3K-binding site) has been suggested as an additional site for SHP-2 to associate with the Î±PDGFR (25Heldin C.-H. Ostman A. Ronnstrand L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F79-F113PubMed Google Scholar). Preincubation of cells expressing the Y31/42 mutant with the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (100 nm) did not restore PDGF-dependent binding of SHP-2 to this receptor (data not shown). Thus, it is likely that association of PI3K with the Î±PDGFR sterically prevents binding of SHP-2 to its alternate binding site. Note that this alternative site may not be physiologically relevant, as it seems to contribute to SHP-2 binding only when the majority of the phosphorylation sites of the receptor is eliminated. The PDGF-dependent recruitment of PI3K activity to the receptor was assessed by measuring the PI3K activity in receptor immunoprecipitates isolated from resting or PDGF-stimulated cells. Western blot analysis of an aliquot of the samples was routinely performed to determine the amount of receptor in each sample. In cells expressing the WT Î±PDGFR, PDGF triggered a substantial increase in the PI3K activity present in receptor immunoprecipitates. Mutating tyrosines 731 and 742 severely impaired association of PI3K activity with the Î±PDGFR, whereas PI3K activity was recruited to WT levels by all other mutants in the subtraction panel (Fig.4 A). The reduced response in cells expressing the F988 receptor in this experiment may be explained by the fact that there was less receptor immunoprecipitate present in this particular sample (see Fig. 2 B). In the add-back panel, only the Y31/42 receptor was able to recruit PI3K activity in response to PDGF stimulation (Fig. 4 B). These data indicate that tyrosines 731 and 742 are necessary and sufficient for binding of PI3K to the activated Î±PDGFR and are consistent with the findings of other groups that these tyrosines are required for association with PI3K. We also examined PLCÎ³ activation by measuring PDGF-AA-dependent accumulation of inositol phosphates. Similar to the findings of other groups (8Eriksson A. Nanberg E. Ronnstrand L. Engstrom U. Hellman U. Rupp E. Carpenter G. Heldin C.-H. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7773-7781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), PLCÎ³ activation was very weakly induced by PDGF-AA, even though PLCÎ³ was tyrosine-phosphorylated and recruited to the Î±PDGFR (3Gelderloos J.A. Rosenkranz S. Bazenet C. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5908-5915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 4Hooshmand-Rad R. Yokote K. Heldin C.-H. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 607-614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the Î²PDGFR was able to drive detectable accumulation of PLCÎ³ products, as was a chimeric Î±/Î²PDGFR (Ref. 26DeMali K.A. Whiteford C.C. Ulug E.T. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9011-9018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar and data not shown). Attemps to optimize PLCÎ³ activation by altering the dose of PDGF or the duration of exposure to PDGF did not improve the response. We conclude that if PLCÎ³ is activated by PDGF-AA, it is below the level of detection in our assays. In summary, the data in Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 show that the Î±PDGFR recruits some signaling enzymes such as PI3K, Src, and to a lesser extent PLCÎ³ with high fidelity and in this respect is comparable to the Î²PDGFR. Association of SHP-2 is more complicated, as there appear to be multiple and possibly cryptic binding sites. Activation of ex"

The conserved NPLY sequence represents a potential Î²-turn motif in the Î²3 cytoplasmic tail and has been suggested to mediate the interaction of Î²3integrins with talin. In the present study, we performed a double mutation (N744Q/P745A) in the integrin Î²3 subunit to test the functional significance of this Î²-turn motif. Chinese hamster ovary cells were co-transfected with cDNA constructs encoding mutant Î²3 and wild type Î±IIb. Cells expressing either wild type (A5) or mutant (D4) Î±IIbÎ²3 adhered to fibrinogen; however, as opposed to control A5 cells, adherent D4 cells failed to spread, form focal adhesions, or initiate protein tyrosine phosphorylation. To investigate the role of the NPLY motif in talin binding, we examined the ability of the mutant Î±IIbÎ²3 to interact with talin in a solid phase binding assay. Both wild type and mutant Î±IIbÎ²3, purified by RGD affinity chromatography, bound to a similar extent to immobilized talin. Additionally, purified talin failed to interact with peptides containing the AKWDTANNPLYK sequence indicating that the talin binding domain in the integrin Î²3 subunit does not reside in the NPLY motif. In contrast, specific binding of talin to peptides containing the membrane-proximal HDRKEFAKFEEERARAK sequence of the Î²3 cytoplasmic tail was observed, and this interaction was blocked by a recombinant protein fragment corresponding to the 47-kDa N-terminal head domain of talin (rTalin-N). In addition, RGD affinity purified platelet Î±IIbÎ²3 bound dose-dependently to immobilized rTalin-N, indicating that an integrin-binding site is present in the talin N-terminal head domain. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that the NPLY Î²-turn motif regulates post-ligand binding functions of Î±IIbÎ²3 in a manner independent of talin interaction. Moreover, talin was shown to bind through its N-terminal head domain to the membrane-proximal sequence of the Î²3cytoplasmic tail.

Integrins are transmembrane Î±Â·Î² receptor complexes involved in numerous physiological processes such as embryogenesis, angiogenesis, immune response, and hemostasis (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9002) Google Scholar). It is generally agreed that binding of adhesive proteins to integrins initiates a series of post-ligand occupancy events that are dependent on an intact cytoskeleton (2Burridge K. Fath K. Kelly T. Nuckolls G. Turner C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 487-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar). On blood platelets, integrin Î±IIbÎ²3 is the most prominent adhesion receptor and plays an essential role in platelet aggregation and the retraction of platelet-rich fibrin clots (3Phillips D.R.

At sites of vascular injury, stimulation of platelets with physiological agonists is thought to result in a change of the native Î±IIbÎ²3conformation from an inactive to an active state which is competent to bind soluble fibrinogen. Following fibrinogen binding to Î±IIbÎ²3 and platelet aggregation, this integrin becomes associated with the cytoskeleton (5Phillips D.R. Jennings L.K. Edwards H.H. J.

In addition, site-directed mutagenesis of integrin Î²1 and Î²3 cytoplasmic domains defined the membrane-proximal region (cyto-1) and two highly homologous NXXY motifs (cyto-2 and cyto-3) as being important in the regulation of integrin affinity states, cell spreading, and receptor recruitment into adhesion plaques (24Reszka A.A.

In addition, a N744Q/P745A double mutation would greatly diminish the probability of forming the Î²-turn within the Î²3 cytoplasmic tail. To examine the functional significance of the N744PLY Î²-turn motif, we generated this N744Q/P745A Î²3 mutant construct and co-transfected it with a wild type Î±IIb construct into CHO cells. The abilities of cells expressing mutant Î²3 integrins to support cell spreading, focal adhesion formation, and protein tyrosine phosphorylation were determined. Since the corresponding region in the Î²1 cytoplasmic tail has been implicated in talin binding function (27Tapley P. Horwitz A. Buck C. Duggan K. Rohrschneider L.

In these experiments, we found that the N744Q/P745A mutation in Î²3 blocked post-ligand binding functions but did not affect Î±IIbÎ²3 binding to talin. This led us to investigate further the talin-binding site within the Î²3 cytoplasmic tail as well as the integrin-binding site within talin.

Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6823) Google Scholar). Overlapping fragments containing this mutation were first generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications using the oligonucleotide pairs 5â²-CGAGGCTGATCAGCGAGCTC-3â², 5â²-CAAAATGGGACACAGCCAACcAggCACTGTATAAAGAGGCCACG-3â² and 5â²-CGTGGCCTCTTTATACAGTGccTgGTTGGCTGTGTCCCATTTTGC-3â², 5â²-GGCCAGTGCAGCTGTGGGGAC-3â² as primers and pc3A as template. The overlapping fragments were combined, denatured by heating at 85 Â°C for 10 min, and reannealed by cooling to 22 Â°C. The ends were filled in with Sequenase, and the double-stranded fragments were then amplified by PCR using the oligonucleotide 5â²-CGAGGCTGATCAGCGAGCTC-3â², 5â²-GGCCAGTGCAGCTGTGGGGAC-3â² pair. The amplified product was digested with AflII and XbaI and ligated into anAflII-XbaI-digested pc3A vector fragment. The mutant construct was verified by automated DNA sequencing (Applied Biosystems model 373A DNA sequenator) and purified by chromatography on Qiagen Tip-100. CHO-K1 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 1% non-essential amino acids, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin. The N744Q/P745A mutant Î²3 construct was co-transfected with the wild type Î±IIb construct (CD2b) into CHO cells by liposome-mediated transfection. Briefly, 2 Î¼g of each construct were incubated with 20 Î¼l of LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies Inc.) in 180 Î¼l of unsupplemented DMEM at 22 Â°C for 20 min, and 3.8 ml of unsupplemented DMEM was then added. The DNA-liposome complexes were overlaid onto CHO cells and incubated for 6 h at 37 Â°C. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl) and incubated in complete medium at 37 Â°C for 48 h with a change of medium at 24 h. The cells were analyzed for transient expression of mutated Î±IIbÎ²3 by flow cytometry using FITC-conjugated AP-2, an anti-Î±IIbÎ²3complex specific monoclonal antibody (30Pidard D. Montgomery R.R. Bennett J.S. Kunicki T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12582-12587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stable cell lines were selected in medium containing 0.75 mg/ml G418 (Sigma), and single cell sorting was performed to obtain stable clonal lines that were high expressors of the mutant Î±IIbÎ²3. The production of the control A5 cell line expressing wild type Î±IIbÎ²3 has been described previously (37O'Toole T.E. Loftus J.C. Du X. Glass A.A. Ruggeri Z.M. Shattil S.J. Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Coverslips were coated with fibrinogen (100 Î¼g/ml in PBS) overnight at 4 Â°C and then blocked with 1% BSA for 1 h at 22 Â°C. CHO cells were harvested and seeded onto the fibrinogen-coated coverslips in a serum-free medium for 3 h. Adherent cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 4 Â°C and subsequently neutralized with NH4Cl/Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4. For phase contrast microscopy, the specimens were examined with a Leitz microscope using a 10Ã dry objective and photographed with Eastman KodakTmax 400 film. For indirect immunofluorescent staining of focal contacts, fixed adherent cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. Following incubation with the anti-Î²3 monoclonal antibody mAb15 for 1 h, cells were stained with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) for 1 h. After washing, the samples were mounted on a droplet of FITC-GuardTM (Testog Inc.) and viewed with a Jenaval phase/fluorescence microscope equipped with an HBO 50-watt mercury lamp, and an IVF1 epifluorescence condenser with BP 485 and 546 nm excitation filters and BP 520â560 and LP 590 barrier filters. CHO cells were photographed with Eastman KodakTmax 400 film. Tissue culture plates (100 mm, Falcon) were coated with 100 Î¼g/ml fibrinogen in PBS overnight at 4 Â°C and then blocked with 0.5% BSA for 2 h at 37 Â°C. Harvested cells (1 Ã 107 cells), suspended in 1 ml of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, and 3.3 mm NaH2PO4, were added to the fibrinogen-coated plates and allowed to adhere for 90 min at 37 Â°C. Non-adherent cells on control BSA-coated plates and adherent cells on fibrinogen-coated plates were lysed with RIPA buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, 158 mm NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm Na2EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4, 100 KIU/ml aprotinin, pH 7.2). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,500 Ã gat 4 Â°C for 30 min, and their protein concentrations were determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 7% polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. In some experiments, the cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using an anti-FAK monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories) coupled to protein G-Sepharose (GammaBind Plus Sepharose, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein tyrosine phosphorylation was analyzed by immunoblotting using the anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody PY20 (ICN) and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce) as described (10Lipfert L.

For the binding of Î±IIbÎ²3 to talin, wild type and mutant Î±IIbÎ²3 were RGD affinity purified from A5 and D4 cells, respectively. In some experiments, Î±IIbÎ²3 was purified from octyl glucoside lysates of outdated human platelets as described (18Knezevic I. Leisner T.M. Lam S.C.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16416-16421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Briefly, 6 Ã 108 A5 and D4 cells were harvested, washed, and solubilized in lysis buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm leupeptin, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 mm octyl glucoside. The cell lysates were applied to 0.5 ml of GRGDSPK-coupled Sepharose 4B and incubated overnight at 4 Â°C. After washing unbound proteins, Î±IIbÎ²3 was eluted with 2 mmHHLGGAKQAGDV peptide. Talin was purified from detergent lysates of human platelets by a combination of DEAE-cellulose anion exchange chromatography, gel filtration on Sepharose CL-6B, and hydroxyapatite column chromatography (38Turner C.E. Burridge K. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 49: 202-206PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2,lane 1). The concentrations of Î±IIbÎ²3 and talin were determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce) with BSA as the standard. In the binding studies, purified talin (100 Î¼g/ml, 50 Î¼l/well) was coated onto microtiter wells (Immulon 2 Removawell strips, Dynex Technologies, Inc.) for 48 h at 4 Â°C. After blocking with 3% BSA, purified Î±IIbÎ²3 was added and incubated for 4 h at 37 Â°C. Following extensive washing, bound receptor was detected with 125I-labeled mAb15 as described (18Knezevic I. Leisner T.M. Lam S.C.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16416-16421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). For the binding of talin to synthetic peptides encompassing partial sequences of the Î²3 cytoplasmic tail, the peptides (0.5 mm, 50 Î¼l/well) were coated onto microtiter wells (Immulon 2, Removawell strips) overnight at 22 Â°C. After blocking the peptide-coated wells with 3% BSA, purified talin was added and incubated for 4 h at 37 Â°C. Bound talin was detected with125I-labeled 8d4, a monoclonal antibody directed against the 190-kDa C-terminal tail domain of talin (31Otey C. Griffiths W. Burridge K. Hybridoma. 1990; 9: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To determine the amounts of immobilized peptides, the peptide-coated wells were blocked with 1% gelatin and incubated overnight at 22 Â°C with 10 mm EZ-linkTM PEO-maleimide activated biotin (Pierce), which reacts with the free sulfhydryl group of the N-terminal cysteine residue of the peptides. After extensive washing, the amounts of coupled biotin were quantitated with 0.1 Î¼m125I-labeled streptavidin. In some experiments, talin binding to peptides with a biotinylated N-terminal lysine residue (Research Genetics, Inc., Table I) was examined. The biotinylated peptides (0.5 mm, 50 Î¼l/well) were coupled onto Reacti-BindTM NeutrAvidin-coated polystyrene microtiter wells (Pierce) at 37 Â°C for 2 h, and the binding of soluble talin to the immobilized peptides was performed as described above. Alternatively, talin (50 Î¼g/ml, 50 Î¼l/well) was immobilized onto Immulon 2 microtiter wells overnight at 22 Â°C. After blocking with 3% BSA, biotinylated peptides were allowed to bind to the immobilized talin for 3 h at 37 Â°C. Bound peptides were detected with 0.5 Î¼m125I-labeled streptavidin. At the time of our experiments, the human talin sequence was not available. Thus, based on the mouse sequence (GenBankTM accession number L46861), we performed 5â²-RACE reaction to determine the nucleotide sequence encoding the N terminus of human talin (39Ohara O. Dorit R.L. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5673-5677Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Briefly, total cellular RNA was extracted from human skin fibroblasts (CCD 1064Sk, ATCC, Rockville, MD) using the RNeasyTM mini kit (Qiagen) and reversed-transcribed using primer a,5â²-CACCTGGAAATTCTCAGGACCAGAGGC-3â², derived from the mouse sequence. 5â²-RACE was performed using the 5â²/3â²-RACE Kit (Mannheim Boehringer) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The coding sequence of the human talin N terminus was determined to be 5â²-ATGGTTGCACTTTCACTGAAGATCAGCATTGGG-3â², and a forward primerb corresponding to this sequence was synthesized. To create the rTalin-N fragment, PCR was performed using Pfu and the oligonucleotide pair b and a with theNdeI and XhoI restriction sites added to the 5â²-ends of these primers, respectively. The rTalin-N fragment was cloned into a pET-30-a(+) vector (Novagen) as a fusion protein with a hexahistidine tag at its C terminus and transformed into BL21(DE3) competent cells (Novagen). DNA sequencing revealed that the human talin N-terminal domain nucleotide sequence was 91.6% identical to the mouse sequence. As compared with the mouse talin protein (40Rees D.J.G. Ades S.E. Singer S.J. Hynes R.O. Nature. 1990; 347: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), there are 6 changes out of 465 amino acid residues in this region: M31I, L40P, N45S, D139E, G141I, and S352N (mouse to human). The expression of rTalin-N histidine-tagged fusion protein was induced in transformed bacteria with isopropylthio-Î²-d-galactoside, and the histidine-tagged fusion protein was purified by chromatography on Ni2+ resin (Novagen). The molecular mass of the purified fusion protein was â¼52 kDa, and it contained 32 amino acid residues downstream of the calpain cleavage site plus the histidine tag (Fig. 2,lane 2). To produce the 47-kDa rTalin-N fragment, the isolated fusion protein was digested with m-calpain (Sigma), and the released â¼5-kDa fragment was removed by extensive dialysis against 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.6, 20 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Î²-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 2, lane 3). By using the Chou and Fasman and Gor II methods to predict protein secondary structures, it has previously been reported that the N744PLY sequence represents a potential Î²-turn motif in the cytoplasmic tail of the integrin Î²3subunit (41Haas T.A. Plow E.F. Prot. Eng. 1997; 10: 1395-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To examine the functional significance of this Î²-turn motif, we performed site-directed mutagenesis and replaced the NPLY sequence with QALY which was predicted to alter the secondary structure of this region. The N744Q/P745A Î²3 mutant construct was co-transfected with a wild type Î±IIb construct into CHO-K1 cells, and stable clonal lines expressing the mutant receptor were developed for functional studies. All experiments described below were performed with at least three clonal cell lines yielding similar results. For simplicity, only those obtained with the D4 cell line are presented. Additionally, the control A5 cell line bearing wild type Î±IIbÎ²3 in CHO-K1 cells (37O'Toole T.E. Loftus J.C. Du X. Glass A.A. Ruggeri Z.M. Shattil S.J. Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H.

The type II sodium-dependent phosphate (Na/Pi) cotransporters (NPT2) are located at the apical membranes of renal proximal tubular cells and major functional transporters associated with renal Pi reabsorption. The consumption of a low-Pi diet induces the synthesis of NPT2, whereas a high Pi diet decreases it. The molecular mechanisms of regulation by dietary Pi are not yet known.In this report, in weaning mice fed a low-Pi diet for 4 days, the NPT2 mRNA level was increased 1.8-fold compared with mice fed a normal Pi diet. This increase was due to an elevation of the transcriptional activity. In theNPT2 gene promoter, the DNA footprint analysis showed that six regions were masked by the binding protein, but at the position â1010 to â985 upstream of the transcription start site, the binding clearly responded to the levels of dietary Pi. The phosphate response element (PRE) of the NPT2 gene was found to consist of the motif related to the E box, 5â²-CACGTG-3â². A yeast one-hybrid system was used to clone a transcription factor that binds to the PRE sequences in the proximal promoter of the NPT2gene. Two cDNA clones that encoded protein of the mouse transcription factor Î¼E3 (TFE3) were isolated. This is a DNA-binding protein that activates transcription through the Î¼E3 site of the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer. TFE3 antibody completely inhibited the binding to the PRE. The coexpression of TFE3 in COS-7 cells transfected with the NPT2 gene promoter markedly stimulated the transcriptional activity. The feeding of a low Pi diet significantly increased the amount of TFE3 mRNA in the kidney.

Miyamoto K. Hisano S. Fukui Y. Takeda E. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 121: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 7Morita K. Fujioka A. Haga H. Nii T. Segawa H. Kouda T. Taketani Y. Hisano S. Fukui Y. Miyamoto K. Takeda E. J. Bone Miner. Metab. 1998; 16: 234-240Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The DNA sequences responsible for the Pi response in the mouse kidney, which we have designated the phosphate response elements (PRE), have been mapped. The PRE of the NPT2 gene promoter shares a region with 9 of 10 bp identity to yeast phosphate-responsive transcription factor Pho4 binding element. At the center of this region is a CACGTG motif, the core recognition site for the helix-loop-helix of transcription factors. This segment contains a 5â²-CACGTG-3â² motif that is sufficient to confer the transactivation by dietary Pi deprivation. We also isolated a transcription factor (a helix-loop-helix protein), which has structural features very similar to those of yeast Pi regulon Pho 4. Male ICR mice (3 weeks after birth) were purchased from SLC (Shizuoka, Japan). They were housed in plastic cages and the animals were fed standard mouse chow (Oriental, Osaka, Japan)ad libitum. For the first week, they were fed the diet. After the period, they received a diet containing 1.2% calcium, 0.6% phosphorus and 4.4 IU vitamin D3/g for 5 days. Thereafter, they were fed a diet with a normal Pi level (0.6%) for 7 days, given between 11:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. (6Katai K. Segawa H. Haga H. Morita K. Arai K. Tatsumi S. Taketani Y. Miyamoto K.

On the 8th day, the following three groups of six mice each were established the normal Pi group, mice that were chronically fed a diet containing 0.6% Pi; the low Pi group, mice that received a diet containing a low percentage (0.02%) of Pi; and the high Pi group, in which the mice received a high percentage (1.2%) Pi diet. After 4 days of the given diet, all of the mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal pentobarbital, and the kidneys were rapidly removed. One-half of each kidney was used for RNA isolation and the other half was used for the isolation of brush-border membrane vesicles (7Morita K. Fujioka A. Haga H. Nii T. Segawa H. Kouda T. Taketani Y. Hisano S. Fukui Y. Miyamoto K. Takeda E. J. Bone Miner. Metab. 1998; 16: 234-240Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from the kidney by extraction with acid guanidine thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform using the method of Chomczynski et al. (13Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63148) Google Scholar). A NaPi-7 cDNA probe (2.4 kilobase pairs) was obtained from a mouse kidney cDNA library (5Werner A. Kempson S.A. Biber J. Murer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6637-6639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The internal standard was GAPDH cDNA. A reporter gene, NPT2 PRE-CYC1-HIS3, for yeast one-hybrid study (14Vidal M. Legrain P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) was constructed as follows. TheSaccharomyces cerevisiae HIS3 coding region connected downstream of the UAS (upstream activating sequence)-less S. cerevisiae CYC1 promoter was constructed on a pUC19-based plasmid containing the S. cerevisiae ADE2 gene fragment. This plasmid was designed as pCHNaPi0. The five tandem copies of 36-bp double-stranded oligonucleotide, which originates from the sequences corresponding to the nucleotide positions from â1010 to â985 in human NPT2 promoter, including PRE, were inserted into upstream of theCYC1 promoter on pCHNaPi0 as its UAS sequences. The resulting plasmid, pCHNaPi5, was integrated into a ade2locus on chromosome of S. cerevisiae strain HYP100 (MAT a ura3â52 leu2â3,112 trp1Î his3Î ade2â101 lys2â801; our stock strain), and this integrant strain was designated as YBH5. The other yeast strain YBH0 was constructed by the similar integration using pCHNaPi0 instead of pCHNaPi5. More than 2 Ã 106 colonies of YBH5 transformants by mouse kidney cDNA library (mouse kidney MATCHMAKER cDNA,CLONTECH Inc., Palo Alto, CA) were screened by their growth on the histidine omission plates with 30 mm of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole as described in the CLONTECHmanual. Eighty-five of positive colonies were obtained on the original plates, and two colonies out of them showed reproducible phenotypes on the above condition. Plasmids carrying the cDNA clones were obtained by extraction from the two yeast transformants as described (15Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 265-289Google Scholar) followed by transformation of E. coli. A 2450-bpBamHI-EcoRI DNA fragment containing the 5â²-flanking region of the NPT2 gene was subcloned into pBluescript II SK(+) (16Taketani Y. Miyamoto K. Tanaka K. Katai K. Chikamori M. Tatsumi S. Segawa H. Yamamoto H. Morita K. Takeda E. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 927-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A BamHI-HindIII fragment from the resulting plasmid was then subcloned upstream of the coding region of the luciferase gene in the vector Pica-Basic (Toyo Ink, Tokyo, Japan) to generate the reporter plasmid p3P2400. Mouse transcription factor Î¼E3 (TFE3) expression vectors were constructed by subcloning on an EcoRI DNA fragment containing the full-length TFE3 cDNA into pcDL-SRÎ±-296 (kindly provided by N. Arai) (17Roman C. Matera A.G. Cooper C. Artandi S. Blain S. Ward D.C. Calame K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 817-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The internal control vector pCMVÎ², which expresses Î²-galactosidase, was obtained from CLONTECH. Each plasmid was purified with a plasmid kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). COS-7 cells (Riken Cell Bank, Tokyo) were cultured at 37 Â°C and under 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sanko-junyaku, Tokyo) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). OK cells (ATCC:CRL1840) were maintained in F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1:1, v/v) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (16Taketani Y. Miyamoto K. Tanaka K. Katai K. Chikamori M. Tatsumi S. Segawa H. Yamamoto H. Morita K. Takeda E. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 927-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected using the DEAE-dextran method with 5 Î¼g of the NPT2gene promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid, 0.5 Î¼g of mouse TFE3L, or TFE3S expression plasmid and 5 Î¼g of pCMVÎ² per 5 Ã 105cells, as described previously (16Taketani Y.

Science. 1991; 254: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). After transfection, the cells were incubated under standard conditions for 48 h and then exposed to various agents for 15 h. Cells were then harvested in cell lysis buffer, and the lysate was assayed for luciferase activity, Î²-galactosidase activity, and protein concentration (19Arakawa T. Nakamura M. Yoshimoto T. Yamamoto S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from kidney or COS-7 cells as described previously (9Taketani Y. Segawa H. Chikamori M. Morita K. Tanaka K. Kido S. Yamamoto H. Iemori Y. Tatsumi S. Tsugawa N. Okano T. Kobayashi T. Miyamoto K. Takeda E. J. Biol.

The 32P-labeled â1045 to â1035 probe and wild-type and mutant promoter probes were purified from a nondenaturing acrylamide gel. EMSA was carried out as described previously (9Taketani Y.

The binding buffer for the probes was 4 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 50 Î¼m EDTA, and 0.1 mmdithiothreitol, and the gel was run in a low ionic strength buffer (6.4 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 3.3 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA) at room temperature. Supershift assays were carried out as described previously (9Taketani Y. Segawa H. Chikamori M. Morita K. Tanaka K. Kido S. Yamamoto H. Iemori Y. Tatsumi S. Tsugawa N. Okano T. Kobayashi T.

Merrell K. Avitahl N. Wong K.K. Calame K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3865-3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A DNase I footprinting analysis was performed using a commercial kit (SureTrac Footprinting Kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Shift-Western blotting was performed according to the method of Demczuk et al. (21Demczuk S. Habers M. Vennstrom B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2574-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This method was developed for identification and analysis of protein and DNA components of gel-shift assays. Approximately 20 Î¼g of nuclear protein was used in a preparative gel shift. After transfer onto DE81 paper, the protein-DNA complexes were identified by autoradiography. Proteins were eluted from excised filter pieces with 0.4 macetic acid, 1 m NaCl at 65 Â°C for 40 min and then precipitated for 30 min with 10% cold CCl3COOH, washed once in acetone and twice in cold 100% ethanol, vacuum-dried, resuspended, denatured in sample buffer, and subjected to SDS/10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting (21Demczuk S. Habers M. Vennstrom B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2574-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Nuclei were prepared from the kidney of mice fed a low Pi diet, and nuclear run-on transcription assays were performed as described previously (22Miura Y. Uchijima Y. Takahashi S. Noguchi T. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1993; 57: 358-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). RNA was extracted and resuspended in 300 Î¼l of hybridization buffer (7% SDS, 10% polyethylene glycol (8,000), 1.5% saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA). Aliquots of RNA from treated and untreated samples were counted in a scintillation counter, and an equal number of counts from each condition (1â2 Ã 106 cpm) were hybridized to linearized cDNAs (5 Î¼g) for NPT1, NPT2, GAPDH, pBluescript II DNA, which were immobilized to Hybond filters using a slot blot apparatus. Data are expressed as the mean Â± S.E. Differences between experimental groups were determined by analysis of variance, and p values < 0.05 were accepted as indicating a significant difference. The brush-border membrane vesicles isolated from renal proximal tubules of mice fed a diet low in Pi for 4 days were prepared and used for the assay of Pi transport activity. The analysis of the Na+-dependent Pi uptake at 1 min revealed an approximately 1.7-fold increase in these mice compared with mice that received a control Pi diet (p < 0.01) (Fig.1 A). As shown in Fig.1 B, the NPT2 mRNA levels were significantly increased (by about 1.8-fold) in the mice fed the low Pi diet for 4 days. In addition, the amounts of the NPT2 protein (the 80â90-kDa bands) were significantly increased (by about 2.5-fold for the 90-kDa band) compared with those in mice fed the control diet (Fig.1 C). In contrast, the high Pi diet significantly suppressed these three parameters (transport activity, mRNA, and protein). We studied the in vitro transcription in isolated nuclei of renal cortex cells from mice fed the low Pi diet. As shown in Fig. 1 D, the transcriptional activity in theNPT2 is significantly increased in the mice fed the low Pi diet compared with those in the mice fed the control Pi. The transcriptional activity of the type I NaPi cotransporter NPT1 gene was not significantly different between the normal Pi and low Pi groups. Thus, the elevation (1.8-fold) of the NPT2mRNA levels in the mice fed the low Pi diet was, at least in part, due to the increase in the transcription of theNPT2 gene. To clarify the protein binding region in the NPT-2gene promoter induced by the feeding of a low Pi diet, we performed DNase footprint assays using nuclear extracts from the renal cortex isolated from mice fed a low Pi diet (Fig. 2). The footprints in the nuclear extract isolated from mouse renal proximal tubular cells had a series of hypersensitive sites in common and a protected region extending from â2018 to â1996 nt (FP-1), â1556 to â1535 nt (FP-2), â 1010 to â985 nt (FP-3) nt relative to the transcription start site of the NPT2gene that may indicate the binding of a factor in mouse kidneys (Fig. 2). There was also additional protection within the regions of â779 to â757 nt (FP-4), â635 to â612 nt (FP-5) and â321 to â298 nt (FP-6), indicating that an additional factor binds the DNA in mice kidney (data not shown). In the comparison of these elements between the mice fed the low Pi and high Pi diets, we found that the extent of the protection at â1010 to â985 nt (FP-3) was significantly different between these two groups of animals (Fig.3 A). However, the other protected regions were not changed by the deprivation of dietary Pi (data not shown). We designed the FP-3 position as PRE.Figure 3Effect of dietray Pi on DNase I footprinting with renal cortex nuclear extracts. A, theNPT2 gene fragment (FP-3) was incubated with DNase I and 20 Î¼g of kidney extracts isolated from mice fed either a low Pi diet (lanes 1 and 2), those fed a normal Pi diet (lane 4), or those fed a high Pi diet (lanes 5 and 6). The number is the location of the protected regions by DNase footprinting analysis. Lane 3, no nuclear extract. B, the proximal NPT2 promoter sequences and the location of PRE. The lower panel indicates the sequences of oligonucleotides for EMSA in Fig. 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, we used the oligonucleotide of PRE (â1010/â985 nt) and performed EMSA. In nuclear extract isolated from mice fed a low Pi diet, the increased DNA-protein complex was observed in EMSA (Fig. 4), but the increase in the DNA/protein complex was not observed with FP-1, FP-2, FP-4, FP-5, and FP-6 probes (data not shown). The protein-DNA complex was completely inhibited unlabeled PRE oligonucleotide. Interestingly, the sequence of PRE was very similar to those of the Pi responsible element for the promoter of the Pi transporter gene PHO84 and acid phosphatase gene PHO5 in yeast (23Oshima Y. Genes Genet. Syst. 1997; 72: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). This element is known to be a Pho4 binding site. Pho4 is a helix-loop-helix transcription factor for the genes associated with yeast Pi metabolism and binds the E box sequence 5â²-CACGTG-3â². To confirm that the E box sequence is the target sequence of the putative binding protein, we performed EMSAs with oligonucleotides containing specific mutations of this sequence (Fig. 3 B). The PRE-MT1 oligonucleotide, in which GG in the 5â² half-site of the PRE sequence was changed to TT, showed binding activity similar to that of the PRE-WT (Figs. 3 B and4 B). The mutation of TG in the E-box to AA (PRE-MT2) abolished the ability to interact with PRE-WT (Fig. 3 B). Mutation of the second and third nucleotides (PRE-MT3) of the E-box also abolished the binding activity (Fig. 4 B), suggesting that the putative binding protein recognized the sequence 5â²-CACGTG-3â² in the promoter of the NPT2 gene. We investigated the role of the PRE in the basic promoter activity of theNPT2 gene. The vector (p3P1170) was constructed with theNPT2 gene promoter (â1289 to +54 nt), which contains the PRE (â110/â985 nt), linked to the luciferase reporter gene in OK cells. Transfection of p3P1170 into OK cells showed a 6-fold increase in the activity of control vector-transfected OK cells. Mutation of the E box in the PRE (p3P1170MT) markedly decreased the basic promoter activity, suggesting that the PRE is important for the expression of the NPT2 gene in OK cells (Fig.5). To further analyze whether the binding activity in the PRE is regulated by plasma Pi concentration, we measured plasma Pi levels and PRE binding activity in the nuclei isolated from mice fed a low Pi, normal Pi, or a high Pi diet. As shown in Fig.6, the binding activity in the PRE-WT oligonucleotide decreased in parallel with the elevation of plasma Pi levels. There was a good correlation with both parameters (PRE binding activity and plasma Piconcentration). To begin to identify some of the proteins that bind this segment, we used this DNA (nucleotide positions from â1010 to â985) as a UAS of the reporter gene's promoter in the yeast one-hybrid system and screened a mouse kidney cDNA library. The yeast strain YBH5 is histidine auxotroph and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole-sensitive phenotypes depending on the expression of the reporter gene, NPT2PRE-CYC1-HIS3 on its chromosome. More than 2 Ã 106 colonies of YBH5 transformants by mouse kidney cDNA library which produced fusion proteins between cDNA-encoding protein and the transcriptional activation domain of GAL4 were screened. Two positive colonies reproducibly showed histidine prototroph and 30 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole resistance phenotypes. The plasmids obtained from the two colonies didn't give histidine prototrophy phenotype to YBH0 strain which has a UAS-lessCYC1-HIS3 reporter gene on its chromosome instead of NPT2 PRE-CYC1-HIS3. It was speculated that the cDNA on the two plasmids encode the binding proteins to the NPT2 PRE sequence on the reporter gene. One cDNA contained an almost full-length coding sequence for TFE3 and the other was a shorter partial cDNA for TFE3. TFE3 is a DNA-binding protein that activates transcription through the Î¼E3 site of the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer (17Roman C. Matera A.G. Cooper C. Artandi S. Blain S. Ward D.C. Calame K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 817-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Roman C. Cohn L. Calame K. Science. 1991; 254: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To isolate the functional TFE3 full-length cDNA clone, we screened the mouse kidney cDNA library (from mice fed a low Pi diet). We isolated TFE3L and TFE3S cDNA clones. The full-length TFE3 was termed TFE3L, and TFE3S is the isoform for the TFE3L and is truncated at the N-terminal region (transactivation domain) of TFE3L (32Murayama A. Takeyama K. Kitanaka S. Kodera Y. Hosoya T. Kato S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) (Fig.7 A). To determine whether TFE3 can activate the transcription of the NPT2 gene, the TFE3L cDNA was cloned in a mammalian expression vector, and the vector was cotransfected with the NPT2 gene promoter (â1289 to +54) linked to t"

FYB/SLAP has the hallmarks of an adaptor protein that binds to the SH2 domains of the Src kinase FYN-T and SLP-76. Whereas two forms of FYB at 120 and 130 kDa have been identified biochemically, a cDNA encoding only the lower molecular weight isoform has been cloned (termed FYB-120 or SLAP-130). In this study, we report the isolation of an alternative isoform of FYB with a molecular mass of 130 kDa (FYB-130) that has the same structure as FYB-120 except for an insertion of 46 amino acids toward the carboxyl-terminal region of the protein. FYB-120 and FYB-130 share an ability to bind to the SH2 domains of FYN-T and SLP-76, to act as substrates for p59FYN-T, and to be expressed in the cytoplasm and nucleus of T-cells. Differences were noted between the isoforms in the efficiency of binding to SLP-76 and in the preferential expression of FYB-130 in mature T-cells. When co-expressed together with FYN-T and SLP-76, FYB-130 caused a significant increase in anti-CD3-driven NF-AT transcription. Finally, fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis localized the FYB gene to human chromosome 5 at position p13.1. FYB-130 therefore represents a novel variant of FYB protein that can up-regulate T-cell receptor-driven interleukin 2 production in mature T-cells.

Dual phosphorylation of tyrosines in each immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif is then required for tandem SH2 domain binding by another lymphoid kinase ZAP-70 (zeta-associated protein-70) or the related kinase SYK (4Chan A.C.

Subsequent phosphorylation of ZAP-70 by p56lck is then needed to activate the kinase, an event that leads to ZAP-70-mediated phosphorylation of its targets (6Chan A.C. Dalton M. Johnson R. Kong G.H.

These include LAT (linker for activation ofT-cell) as well as the cytosolic intracellular proteins SLP-76 (SH2-domain-containing leukocyteprotein of 76 kDa) and FYB/SLAP (FYN-T-binding protein)/SLAP (forSLP-76-associated protein) (8Peterson E.J.

Cell. 1999; 96: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). LAT (pp36) is a transmembrane type III surface protein with a small extracellular region attached to a long cytoplasmic tail that is expressed exclusively in hematopoietic cells (10Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). LAT acts as a surface protein that binds multiple intracellular proteins that include growth factor binding protein-2, Son of sevenless, Vav, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, phospholipase CÎ³, the cellular homologue of Casitas B-lineage lymphoma protein (c-Cbl), and SLP-76. Consensus motifs for direct SH2 domain binding exist for growth factor binding protein-2 and phospholipase CÎ³, whereas other components may be indirectly recruited. LAT is involved in integrating signals from the receptor as demonstrated by the ability of the dominant negative form of LAT to inhibit NF-AT transcriptional activity (10Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). LAT is also needed for the activation of phospholipase CÎ³ and the Ras pathway (11Finco T.S. Kadlecek T. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Weiss A.

SYK also promotes the binding of the adaptor Nck to the same region, leading to the formation of a SLP-76-Vav-Nck trimolecular complex that may regulate cytoskeletal organization (21Wardenburg J.B.

Vav is also a hematopoietic protein with guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity for Rho and Rac GTPases (22Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Overexpression of VAV and SLP-76 increases TcR-mediated IL-2 transcription in a cooperative manner (18Wu J. Motto D.G.

An additional SLP-76 associated protein is the lymphoid-specific protein FYB/SLAP, a protein cloned on the basis of its ability to bind to the Src-related kinase FYN-T and SLP-76 (23Musci M.A. Hendricks-Taylor L.R.

FYB/SLAP also has the hallmarks of an adaptor protein with several proline-rich regions, multiple tyrosine-containing motifs, and two putative nuclear localization sequences linked to a carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain. As with LAT and SLP-76, FYB/SLAP is expressed primarily in T-cells, monocytes, and mast cells but not in B-cells. FYB/SLAP also undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in response to TcR ligation, an event diminished in FYN-T-deficient T-cells (25da Silva A.J. Rosenfield J.M. Mueller I. Bouton A. Hirai H. Rudd C.E. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2007-2016PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of FYB/SLAP alone in T-cells has been reported to either weakly potentiate (24da Silva A.J. Li Z. de Vera C. Canto E. Findell P.

However, co-transfection of FYB/SLAP with its binding partners FYN-T and SLP-76 causes a potent up-regulation of TcR-driven IL-2 production (26Raab M. Kang H. da Silva A. Zhu X. Rudd C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21170-21179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These data suggest that FYB plays a role in the integration of signals from the TcR complex. Biochemical analysis of FYB has revealed two proteins FYB-120 and a higher Mr form with an apparent mass of 130 kDa (termed FYB-130) (25da Silva A.J. Rosenfield J.M. Mueller I. Bouton A. Hirai H. Rudd C.E. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2007-2016PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated cDNAs for FYB or SLAP encode a protein that corresponds to the lower Mrisoform. In order to establish the basis for the difference between FYB-120 and FYB-130, we re-screened a cDNA library to determine whether there exists an alternate form of FYB encoding the higherMr isoform. In this paper, we report the cDNA cloning of FYB-130 and demonstrate that this novel isoform binds to SH2 domains of FYN-T and SLP-76, localizes in the cytoplasm/nucleus of cells, and can potentiate TcR-driven IL-2 production in T-cells. FYB-130 differs from FYB-120 in its preferential expression in mature T-cells. FYB-130 represents a novel FYB isoform that positively regulates IL-2 production in mature T-cells. A murine T-cell hybridoma-derived cDNA library constructed into Î»ZAP-Express (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, generous gift of Dr. Linda Clayton, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston) was screened with the human FYB cDNA under moderate stringency conditions. Plasmid DNA was purified from positive clones, and both strands were subjected to sequencing by automatic sequencer (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Molecular Core Facility). DNA sequences were analyzed using the Genetics Computer Group (GCG) program (Madison, WI). The generation of the anti-FYB serum, anti-FYN-T, has been previously described (27Pelchen-Matthews A. Boulet I. Littman D.R. Fagard R. Marsh M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Anti-HA for immunoblotting (12CA5) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Rhodamine-labeled anti-mouse Ig was purchased from Caltag Laboratories. Computer analysis of the FYB-130 protein sequence was conducted using the Prosite data base (28Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 11: 2013-2018Crossref Scopus (425) Google Scholar), and sequence homologies were analyzed using BLASTP and BEAUTY programs (29Worley K.C. Culpepper P. Wiese B.A. Smith R.F. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 890-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and data bases available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information and Baylor College of Medicine. PEST sequences were based on prediction programs (30Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1964) Google Scholar). Secondary structural analysis was conducted using the NNPREDICT program and the COILS program (31Lupas A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). COS cells and DC27.10 murine T-cell hybridoma cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (v/v), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (w/v), and 1%l-glutamine (w/v) at 37 Â°C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. COS cells were transfected with FYB-120 and FYB-130 using the SRÎ±2 expression vector (gift of Dr. M. Streuli, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston) and the pEB expression vector as described previously (24da Silva A.J. Li Z. de Vera C. Canto E. Findell P. Rudd C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7493-7498Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Full-length FYB-120 or FYB-130 cDNAs were expressed in the pSRÎ± or pEB mammalian expression vector carrying the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag at the NH2-terminal end (FYB-HA). GST-SH2 domain fusion protein for SLP-76 was kindly provided by Dr. Paul R. Findell (Syntex, Palo Alto, CA). GST-SH2 domain fusion protein for FYN-T has been previously described (24da Silva A.J.

Thymus or spleen cell suspensions were prepared, and thymocyte T- cell subsets were isolated using immunodepletion using anti-CD3 mAb (145-2C11, generous gift of Dr. Jeff Bluestone, University of Chicago, IL), anti-CD4, and anti-CD8 mAb-coated magnetic beads coated with anti-hamster and anti-mouse Ig (Magnetic Perspectives, Cambridge, MA). COS cells were seeded at 1 Ã 105 cells/well into 6-well culture dishes (Nunc, Denmark) containing glass coverslips. After overnight incubation the cells were transfected with 2 Î¼g of SRÎ±-FYB 120-HA and pEB-FYB 130-HA DNA using Superfect (Qiagen). The cells were incubated for a further 48 h, and the coverslips were removed and fixed in methanol for 5 min, for staining. The coverslips were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with anti-FYB rabbit serum, diluted 1:100 for 1 h at 37 Â°C. After further washing with phosphate-buffered saline FYB expression was detected after incubation with rhodamine-labeled secondary antibody, and nuclei were stained using 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR; 0.5 Î¼g/ml). Coverslips were mounted in glycerol gelatin (Sigma) onto microscope slides. Endogenous FYB expression was detected in T-cell hybridoma cells DC27.10 using anti-FYB rabbit serum. Immunofluorescence was analyzed using the confocal laser scanning microscope LSM 410 (Zeiss, Germany) equipped with an external argon-krypton laser (568 nm). The images were printed with the Fujix Pictrography 3000 color printer (Fujifilm, Japan) using Adobe Photoshop software (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA). Precipitations were conducted using Triton X-100 lysis buffer (1% v/v in 20 mmTris, pH 8.1; 150 mm NaCl), as described (32da Silva A.J. Janssen O.J. Rudd C.E. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 2107-2113Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was carried out using chemoimmunofluorescence using the Renaissance detection kit (NEN Life Science Products), as described (32da Silva A.J. Janssen O.J. Rudd C.E. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 2107-2113Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Jurkat cells (2 Ã 107) were co-transfected with 20 Î¼g of FYN-T, FYB, SLP-76 cDNAs alone or in combination and were aliquoted into a 12-well plate and cultured in a final volume of 1 ml of RPMI growth medium. Cells were unstimulated or stimulated at 37 Â°C with OKT3 or 10 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate 16 h after transfection. After 6 h stimulation cells were lysed in 100 Î¼l of lysis buffer (Promega kit). Luciferase activity was determined using the luminometer (MicroLumat, EG7G Berthold) immediately after the addition of 100 Î¼l of luciferase substrate (Promega kit) followed by a Stop and Go reaction to measure the control reporter plasmid (dual luciferase system kit from Promega). Luciferase units of the experimental vector were normalized to the level of the control vector in each samples. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was conducted using probe labeling with digoxigenin: 1 Î¼g of a 1.5-kDa human FYB cDNA cloned into the SRÎ± vector was labeled with digoxigenin 11-dUTP as described in Zhaoet al. (33Zhao Y. Bjorbaek C. Weremowicz S. Morton C.C. Moller D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4353-4363Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), co-precipitated with 100 Î¼g of tRNA and resuspended in 1Ã TE at 100 Î¼g/ml. For fluorescence in situ hybridization, hybridization of metaphase chromosome preparations from peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained from normal human males was performed with the FYB gene at 10 Î¼g/ml in Hybrisol VI according to previously described methods (34Ney P.A. Andrews N.C. Jane S.M. Safer B. Purucker N.E. Weremowicz S. Morton C.C. Goff S.C. Orkin S.H. Nienhuis A.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5604-5612Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Digoxigenin-labeled probe was detected using reagents supplied in the Oncor Kit (Oncor, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Metaphase chromosomes were counterstained with DAPI. Map position of the human FYB was determined by visual inspection of the fluorescent signal on the DAPI-stained metaphase chromosomes. Twenty one metaphases were assessed for probe localization. Hybridization was observed with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope and images captured and printed using the Cytovision Imaging System (Applied Imaging, Pittsburgh, PA). The cloning of the gene encoding the lower Mr form of FYB (or SLAP) has previously been described (23Musci M.A. Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Motto D.G. Paskind M. Kamens J. Turck C.W. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol.

However, biochemical analysis has shown the presence of two bands at 120 and 130 kDa that do not appear to differ due to phosphorylation or glycosylation (25da Silva A.J. Rosenfield J.M. Mueller I. Bouton A. Hirai H. Rudd C.E. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2007-2016PubMed Google Scholar). In an attempt to isolate an alternative isoform of FYB encoding the 130-kDa isoform (FYB-130), we re-screened a murine cDNA library with oligonucleotide probes from FYB-120 that led to the identification of several positive clones. One new clone encoded an isoform of FYB (FYB-130) that is identical to the 120-kDa isoform except for a 138-base pair insert (Fig.1 A). The FYB-130 insert (FYB-130i) encodes 46 amino acids that occurs at murine residue 627 and is located between two tyrosine-based motifs YDGI and YDDV (Fig.1 A). Secondary structure predictions indicate that the insert is helical between residues 637 and 648 (Fig. 1 B). A charged grouping of residues enriched for lysine and aspartic acid (KGKDDRKK) precedes putative phosphorylation sites for the serine/threonine kinases, casein kinase II, protein kinase C, and cAMP or cGMP kinase. Two potential PEST sequences (polypeptide regions enriched in proline (P), glutamic acid (E), serine (S), and threonine (T) sequences), one of which is also found in the FYB-120 isoform, overlap with amino acids at the amino and the carboxyl termini of FYB-130i (Fig. 1 B). Of potential significance, a comparison of FYB-130i with the protein data base shows significant homology with several nuclear proteins (Fig. 1 C). These include the Asp/Glu-rich acidic site of HMG1/2-like protein (42% identical/68% similar from residues 641 to 669) (Fig. 1 C), the hypothetical protein MJ1361 (41% identical/70% similar from residues 635 to 664), the myristoylation site for the DNA repair enzyme RecA (37% identical/68% similar from residues 628 to 662) (Fig.1 C), as well as the regulator of chromosome condensation in yeast (25% identical/55% similar from residues 628 to 670). The regions of homology extend over a significant portion of the 46 amino acid FYB-130i insert. This new isoform also retains the structural features of murine FYB-120 that include type 1 (Arg-X-Pro-X-X-Pro) (residues 307â312) or type II (Pro-X-X-Pro-X-Arg/Lys) SH3 domain recognition motifs (residues 237â242, 357â362, and 417â422) (35Guy B.

Nature. 1987; 330: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), multiple tyrosine residues, two putative bipartite nuclear localization K(R/R)R-X11â12-K(K/R)K motifs (residues 467â505 and 664â694 (FYB-120), 710â746 (FYB-130)) and an SH3-like domain found in FYB-120. Additional features of FYB-120 and -130 include consensus sites for serine/threonine kinases such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (36Clark-Lewis I. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15180-15184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), protein kinase C, cAMP- or cGMP-dependent kinase, casein kinase II, and numerous possible myristoylation sites (Table I). Computer predictions of FYB secondary structure yielded a helical structure for the putative nuclear localization sequences that includes a coiled-coil (residues 458â493) and three potential PEST sequences for FYB-120 and four sequences for FYB-130 with possible phosphorylation sites for casein kinase II (Table I).Table IProsite analysis of FYBPotential protein kinase phosphorylation sitesAmino acid residueAmino acid consensus cAMP and cGMP565â568KKNS652â655RKKS Protein kinase C17â19SSR34â36SRK59â61TTK89â91SPR114â116SPK212â214TSK754â756TSK329â331TPK455â457SSK518â520SFK542â544TAR561â563SLK655â657 (130)SIR700â702 (120)STK746â748 (130) Casein kinase II69â72TYEE121â124TKED203â206STED449â452TYED455â458SSKE553â556TAVE610â613TDDE655â658SIRE663â666 (130)SESD730â733 (120)STDD776â779 (130)Myristoylation sites7â12GSNPTE93â98GTQPNS197â202GQKPSL269â274GLSKNF312â317GTPWGQ429â434GVMHSD597â602GQSGSG659â664 (120)GMSVGR705â710 (130)PEST sequences199â214 (120 Ã 130)KPSLSTEDSQEENTSK596â634 (130)HGQSGSGGMFPPPPTDDEIY596â631 (120)DGIEEEDDDDGSVPQVDEK661â677 (130)KVSESDNNEGSSLPSQH766â781 (130)KPGESLEVIQSTDDTK720â735 (120) Open table in a new tab In order to verify that the new clone encoded a 130-kDa protein, FYB-130 tagged with HA was transfected into COS cells and analyzed for expression by anti-HA blotting (Fig.2 A, upper panel). The expressed protein migrated at approximately 130 kDa (lane 3), at a position on SDS-PAGE above the expressed FYB-120 protein (lane 1). Furthermore, FYB-130 co-migrated with the upper band of the FYB 120/130 doublet precipitated by anti-FYB from T-cell hybridoma DC27.10 (lane 5). DC27.10 is the T-cell hybridoma from which peptide sequence was obtained for FYB (25da Silva A.J. Rosenfield J.M. Mueller I. Bouton A. Hirai H. Rudd C.E. J.

To assess whether FYB-130 shared this property, HA-tagged FYB-120 and FYB-130 were expressed individually with the FYN-T kinase and assessed for tyrosine phosphorylation by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). COS cells were used to avoid competition from endogenous FYB in T-cells. Nevertheless, similar results were also obtained in the T-cell hybridoma DC27.10 (data not shown). Under these conditions, co-expression with FYN-T resulted in the detection of a highly phosphorylated FYB-130 band (lane 4), whereas FYB-130 alone showed no background phosphorylation (lane 3). Specificity was shown by co-expression of another kinase ZAP-70 that failed to phosphorylate FYB-130 (data not shown). Similar levels of FYB-120 phosphorylation by FYN-T were observed (lane 2 versus lane 4). Probing the same blot with anti-HA revealed that equivalent amounts of the FYB proteins had been expressed (upper panel, lanes 2 and 4). These observations indicate that like FYB-120, FYB-130 acts as a substrate for the FYN-T kinase. In order to assess whether the SH2 domains of FYN-T and SLP-76 could bind to FYB-130, GST fusion proteins carrying the SH2 domains of FYN-T, SLP-76, or of the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase were added to cell lysates and assessed for their ability to precipitate FYB. As shown in Fig. 2 b, co-expression of FYB-130 and FYN-T created conditions for the binding of FYB-130 to the SH2 domains of FYN-T and SLP-76 (lanes 8 and 12, respectively). In contrast, no binding was noted against singly expressed unphosphorylated FYB-130 (lanes 7 and 11, respectively). Specificity was shown by the inability of the SH2 domain of p85 to precipitate the protein (lanes 15â16,respectively). As an additional control, GST alone did not precipitate FYB-130 (lanes 3 and 4). From this, it is evident that FYB-120 and FYB-130 share the ability to bind to the SH2 domains of FYN-T and SLP-76. The only difference noted between FYB-130 and FYB-120 was in the efficiency of precipitation. Despite similar levels of FYB-130 and FYB-120 expression and phosphorylation, FYN-T and SLP-76 SH2 domain generally was found to precipitate greater amounts of FYB-120 (lanes 6 versus 8 and10 versus 12, respectively). Given the structural similarity and differences of the FYB isoforms, it was next of i"

The C-terminal 158 residues of Bcl3 exhibited an autonomous transactivation function and interacted with specific subregions of the AP-1 components c-Jun and c-Fos, CREB-binding protein/p300, and steroid receptor coactivator-1, as demonstrated by the yeast and mammalian two-hybrid tests as well as glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays. In addition, anti-HA antibody co-precipitated c-Jun from HeLa cells co-expressing c-Jun and HA-tagged Bcl3, consistent with the idea that Bcl3 directly associates with AP-1 in vivo. Furthermore, microinjection of Bcl3 expression vector into Rat-1 fibroblast cells significantly enhanced DNA synthesis and expression of c-jun, one of the cellular target genes of AP-1. These results suggest that Bcl3 may directly participate in the tumorigenesis processes as a novel transcription coactivator of the mitogenic transcription factor AP-1in vivo. Bcl3, an IÎºB protein, was originally isolated as a putative proto-oncogene in a subset of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias. Bcl3 was subsequently shown to associate tightly with and transactivate the NFÎºB p50 or p52 homodimer. Herein, we show that Bcl3 stimulates the activating protein-1 (AP-1) transactivation, either alone or in conjunction with transcription integrators steroid receptor coactivator-1 and CREB-binding protein/p300.

The AP-1 complex consists of a heterodimer of a Fos family member and a Jun family member. This complex binds the consensus DNA sequence (TGAGTCA) (termed AP-1 sites) found in a variety of promoters. The Fos family contains four proteins (c-Fos, Fos-B, Fra-1, and Fra-2), while the Jun family is composed of three (c-Jun, Jun-B, and Jun-D). Fos and Jun are members of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family of sequence-specific dimeric DNA-binding proteins (2Baxevanis A. Vinson C.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 278-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The C-terminal half of the bZIP domain is amphipathic, containing a heptad repeat of leucines that is critical for the dimerization of bZIP proteins. The N-terminal half of the long bipartite Î±-helix is the basic region that is critical for sequence-specific DNA binding.Transcription coactivators bridge transcription factors and the components of the basal transcriptional apparatus (3Horwitz K.B.

In particular, the functionally conserved proteins CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300 have been shown to be essential for the activation of transcription by a large number of regulated transcription factors, including AP-1 (4Goldman P.S. Tran V.K. Goodman R.H. Rec. Prog. Horm. Res. 1997; 52: 103-119PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, it was recently shown that steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) (5Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2042) Google Scholar), originally isolated as a transcription coactivator of nuclear receptors, also stimulates transactivation by many different transcription factors such as NF-ÎºB (6Na S.-Y.

From these results, chromatin remodeling through histone acetylation-deacetylation was suggested to play an important role in transcription cofactor-mediated transcriptional regulation.Bcl3 belongs to a family of IÎºB proteins that also include IÎºBÎ±, IÎºBÎ², IÎºBÎ³, p105, and p100 (reviewed in Ref. 20Gilmore T.D. Morin P.J. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 427-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). These proteins have been shown to modulate transactivation by NF-ÎºB, which is important for the inducible expression of a wide variety of cellular and viral genes (reviewed in Ref. 21Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5542) Google Scholar). Bcl3 was originally isolated as a gene, which was recurrently translocated into the immunoglobulin Î± locus and highly expressed in a subset of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias (22McKeithan T.W. Takimoto G.S. Ohno H. Bjorling V.S. Morgan R. Hecht B.K. Dube I. Sandberg A.A. Rowley J.D. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1997; 20: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, it is currently uncertain whether the translocated and overexpressed Bcl3 directly contributes to the development of this disease. Bcl3 was shown to be a nuclear protein and associate tightly with p50 or p52 homodimers in cells (23Fujita T. Nolan G.P. Liou H.C. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1354-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 24Bours V. Franzoso G. Azarenko V. Park S. Kanno T. Brown K. Siebenlist U. Cell. 1993; 72: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The tethering of Bcl3 to DNA via the p50/p52 homodimers allowed Bcl3 to transactivate directly, while p50/p52 homodimers alone were inert (23Fujita T. Nolan G.P. Liou H.C. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1354-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar,24Bours V. Franzoso G. Azarenko V. Park S. Kanno T. Brown K. Siebenlist U. Cell. 1993; 72: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Recently, mice with a targeted disruption in Bcl3 were shown to have immunological defects similar to but distinct from that observed in the p50(â/â) mice, suggesting that Bcl3 could function independently of p50 in vivo (25Schwarz E.M. Krimpenfort P. Berns A. Verma I.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Indeed, we have recently shown that Bcl3 can function as a novel transcription coactivator of retinoid X receptor (RXR) (26Na S.-Y. Choi H.-S. Kim J.W. Na D.S. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30933-30938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). RXR belongs to a family of ligand-dependent transcriptional regulatory proteins that function by binding to specific DNA sequences named hormone response elements in the promoters of target genes (reviewed in Ref. 27Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6027) Google Scholar). This unexpected diversity of transcription factors regulated by Bcl3 led us to examine whether Bcl3 can modulate other transcription factors, particularly those involved with cellular proliferation, including AP-1.In this report, Bcl3 is shown to function as a novel transcription coactivator of AP-1, either alone or in conjunction with transcription integrators SRC-1 and CBP/p300. The C-terminal 158 residues of Bcl3 were mapped as an interaction interface with specific subregions of c-Jun, c-Fos, CBP/p300, and SRC-1. Importantly, microinjection of Bcl3 expression vector into Rat-1 fibroblast cells significantly enhanced expression of c-jun, one of the major cellular target genes of AP-1, as well as DNA synthesis, consistent with the mitogenic function of AP-1. Thus, Bcl3 may directly regulate the tumorigenesis processes in vivo.DISCUSSIONBcl3 exhibits properties consistent with its potential role as a transcription coactivator, bridging transcription factors to the basal transcription machinery. First, Bcl3 directly interacts with target transcription factors, including p50/p52 homodimers (23Fujita T. Nolan G.P. Liou H.C. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1354-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 24Bours V. Franzoso G. Azarenko V. Park S. Kanno T. Brown K. Siebenlist U. Cell. 1993; 72: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), RXR (26Na S.-Y. Choi H.-S. Kim J.W. Na D.S. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30933-30938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and AP-1 (Table I and Figs. 1 and 2). Second, Bcl3 physically associates with general transcription factors such as TFIIB, TBP, and TFIIA (26Na S.-Y. Choi H.-S. Kim J.W. Na D.S. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30933-30938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Third, Bcl3 functionally interacts with transcription integrators SRC-1 and CBP/p300 (Table I and Fig. 4) and contains an autonomous transactivation function (Ref. 26Na S.-Y. Choi H.-S. Kim J.W. Na D.S. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30933-30938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar and Fig. 1).The AP-1 interaction interface was localized to the region from Bcl3 residue 289 to the C terminus (Table I and Fig. 1). Since Bcl3ÎC3 (i.e. the Bcl3 residues 1â365) suffices to coactivate the AP-1 transactivation, the AP-1 interaction interface may localize to the Bcl3 residues 289â365, which include the Bcl3 ankyrin repeats 6 and 7 (Fig. 1 A). Interestingly, the autonomous transactivation function of Bcl3 was previously mapped to the Bcl3 residues 156â289 in yeast (26Na S.-Y. Choi H.-S. Kim J.W. Na D.S. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30933-30938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), whereas it was localized to the C-terminal region of Bcl3 (i.e. the Bcl3 residues 289â446) in mammalian cells (Fig. 1 B). This discrepancy is likely to have reflected some fundamental differences between yeast and mammalian transcription machinery. The autonomous transactivation functions of Bcl3 (particularly in mammalian cells) as well as the Bcl3-mediated coactivation of AP-1 transactivation may involve recruitment of other essential transcription coactivators such as CBP/p300 and SRC-1. Consistent with this notion, Bcl3 was shown to functionally cooperate with SRC-1 and CBP/p300 to coactivate the AP-1 transactivation (Fig.4). Finally, it is interesting to note that Bcl3 contains a numerous number of putative phosphorylation sites, including TPA-responsive MAP kinase sites (for a review, see Ref. 34Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 481-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). There is an exciting possibility that signal-dependent modification of Bcl3 such as phosphorylation may play an important role in stimulating the AP-1 transactivation.Cross-communications between distinct signaling pathways that lead to combinatorial controls are becoming a common theme in the area of transcriptional regulations and could involve a complex array of different mechanisms. Competition for a limiting amount of common transcription coactivators could serve as an important mechanism, for instance. Bcl3 targets at least three different transcription factors, AP-1, RXR, and the NF-ÎºB p50/p52 homodimers. Therefore, Bcl3 may be involved with the mutually antagonistic interactions between RXR and either NF-ÎºB (35Na S.-Y. Kang B.Y. Chung S.W. Han S.-J. Ma X. Trinchieri G. Im S.-Y. Lee J.W. Kim T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7674-7680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) or AP-1 (for a review, see Ref. 36Pfahl M. Skin Pharmacol. 1993; 6: 8-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Regarding the proliferative function of ectopically expressed Bcl3 (Fig. 5), it is interesting to note that AP-1 and NF-ÎºB are known to be proproliferative (1Herschman H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 281-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 37Rogers M.B. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1997; 35: 1-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, overexpressed Bcl3 may also oppose the antiproliferative action of retinoids, by relieving the retinoid/RXR-mediated inhibition of AP-1 and NF-ÎºB. These possibilities are currently under investigation.In conclusion, we have shown that Bcl3 enhances proliferation as a novel transcription coactivator of the mitogenic transcription factor AP-1. Consistent with our results, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and erythropoietin were recently shown to markedly enhance Bcl3 expression in association with stimulation of proliferation (38Zhang M.Y. Harhaj E.W. Bell L. Sun S.C. Miller B.A. Blood. 1998; 92: 1225-1234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, transgenic mice overexpressing Bcl3 developed normally but showed splenomegaly and accumulation of mature B cells in lymph nodes, bone marrow, and peritoneal cavity (39Ong S.T. Hackbarth M.L. Degenstein L.C. Baunoch D.A. Anastasi J. McKeithan T.W. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2333-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These results, along with ours, strongly suggest that Bcl3 should be directly involved with the tumorigenesis processes in a subset of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias, in which Bcl3 is recurrently translocated and highly expressed. Thus, further studies of Bcl3 should provide important insights into transcriptional regulatory mechanisms as well as the tumorigenesis processes.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1354-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar,24Bours V. Franzoso G. Azarenko V. Park S. Kanno T. Brown K. Siebenlist U. Cell. 1993; 72: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Recently, mice with a targeted disruption in Bcl3 were shown to have immunological defects similar to but distinct from that observed in the p50(â/â) mice, suggesting that Bcl3 could function independently of p50 in vivo (25Schwarz E.M. Krimpenfort P. Berns A. Verma I.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Indeed, we have recently shown that Bcl3 can function as a novel transcription coactivator of retinoid X receptor (RXR) (26Na S.-Y. Choi H.-S. Kim J.W. Na D.S. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30933-30938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). RXR belongs to a family of ligand-dependent transcriptional regulatory proteins that function by binding to specific DNA sequences named hormone response elements in the promoters of target genes (reviewed in Ref. 27Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6027) Google Scholar). This unexpected diversity of transcription factors regulated by Bcl3 led us to examine whether Bcl3 can modulate other transcription factors, particularly those involved with cellular proliferation, including AP-1. In this report, Bcl3 is shown to function as a novel transcription coactivator of AP-1, either alone or in conjunction with transcription integrators SRC-1 and CBP/p300. The C-terminal 158 residues of Bcl3 were mapped as an interaction interface with specific subregions of c-Jun, c-Fos, CBP/p300, and SRC-1. Importantly, microinjection of Bcl3 expression vector into Rat-1 fibroblast cells significantly enhanced expression of c-jun, one of the major cellular target genes of AP-1, as well as DNA synthesis, consistent with the mitogenic function of AP-1. Thus, Bcl3 may directly regulate the tumorigenesis processes in vivo. DISCUSSIONBcl3 exhibits properties consistent with its potential role as a transcription coactivator, bridging transcription factors to the basal transcription machinery. First, Bcl3 directly interacts with target transcription factors, including p50/p52 homodimers (23Fujita T. Nolan G.P. Liou H.C. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1354-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 24Bours V. Franzoso G. Azarenko V. Park S. Kanno T. Brown K. Siebenlist U. Cell. 1993; 72: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), RXR (26Na S.-Y. Choi H.-S. Kim J.W. Na D.S. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30933-30938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and AP-1 (Table I and Figs. 1 and 2). Second, Bcl3 physically associates with general transcription factors such as TFIIB, TBP, and TFIIA (26Na S.-Y. Choi H.-S. Kim J.W. Na D.S. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30933-30938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Third, Bcl3 functionally interacts with transcription integrators SRC-1 and CBP/p300 (Table I and Fig. 4) and contains an autonomous transactivation function (Ref. 26Na S.-Y. Choi H.-S. Kim J.W. Na D.S. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30933-30938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar and Fig. 1).The AP-1 interaction interface was localized to the region from Bcl3 residue 289 to the C terminus (Table I and Fig. 1). Since Bcl3ÎC3 (i.e. the Bcl3 residues 1â365) suffices to coactivate the AP-1 transactivation, the AP-1 interaction interface may localize to the Bcl3 residues 289â365, which include the Bcl3 ankyrin repeats 6 and 7 (Fig. 1 A). Interestingly, the autonomous transactivation function of Bcl3 was previously mapped to the Bcl3 residues 156â289 in yeast (26Na S.-Y. Choi H.-S. Kim J.W. Na D.S. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30933-30938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), whereas it was localized to the C-terminal region of Bcl3 (i.e. the Bcl3 residues 289â446) in mammalian cells (Fig. 1 B). This discrepancy is likely to have reflected some fundamental differences between yeast and mammalian transcription machinery. The autonomous transactivation functions of Bcl3 (particularly in mammalian cells) as well as the Bcl3-mediated coactivation of AP-1 transactivation may involve recruitment of other essential transcription coactivators such as CBP/p300 and SRC-1. Consistent with this notion, Bcl3 was shown to functionally cooperate with SRC-1 and CBP/p300 to coactivate the AP-1 transactivation (Fig.4). Finally, it is interesting to note that Bcl3 contains a numerous number of putative phosphorylation sites, including TPA-responsive MAP kinase sites (for a review, see Ref. 34Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 481-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). There is an exciting possibility that signal-dependent modification of Bcl3 such as phosphorylation may play an important role in stimulating the AP-1 transactivation.Cross-communications between distinct signaling pathways that lead to combinatorial controls are becoming a common theme in the area of transcriptional regulations and could involve a complex array of different mechanisms. Competition for a limiting amount of common transcription coactivators could serve as an important mechanism, for instance. Bcl3 targets at least three different transcription factors, AP-1, RXR, and the NF-ÎºB p50/p52 homodimers. Therefore, Bcl3 may be involved with the mutually antagonistic interactions between RXR and either NF-ÎºB (35Na S.-Y. Kang B.Y. Chung S.W. Han S.-J. Ma X. Trinchieri G. Im S.-Y. Lee J.W. Kim T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7674-7680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) or AP-1 (for a review, see Ref. 36Pfahl M. Skin Pharmacol. 1993; 6: 8-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Regarding the proliferative function of ectopically expressed Bcl3 (Fig. 5), it is interesting to note that AP-1 and NF-ÎºB are known to be proproliferative (1Herschman H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 281-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 37Rogers M.B. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1997; 35: 1-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, overexpressed Bcl3 may also oppose the antiproliferative action of retinoids, by relieving the retinoid/RXR-mediated inhibition of AP-1 and NF-ÎºB. These possibilities are currently under investigation.In conclusion, we have shown that Bcl3 enhances proliferation as a novel transcription coactivator of the mitogenic transcription factor AP-1. Consistent with our results, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and erythropoietin were recently shown to markedly enhance Bcl3 expression in association with stimulation of proliferation (38Zhang M.Y. Harhaj E.W. Bell L. Sun S.C. Miller B.A. Blood. 1998; 92: 1225-1234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, transgenic mice overexpressing Bcl3 developed normally but showed splenomegaly and accumulation of mature B cells in lymph nodes, bone marrow, and peritoneal cavity (39Ong S.T. Hackbarth M.L. Degenstein L.C. Baunoch D.A. Anastasi J. McKeithan T.W. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2333-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These results, along with ours, strongly suggest that Bcl3 should be directly involved with the tumorigenesis processes in a subset of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias, in which Bcl3 is recurrently translocated and highly expressed. Thus, further studies of Bcl3 should provide important insights into transcriptional regulatory mechanisms as well as the tumorigenesis processes.

(1999)Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 254, 284â291). Herein, we demonstrate that PLC-Î´1 has a functional nuclear export signal (NES) sequence in amino acid residues 164â177 of the EF-hand domain. The fluorescence of NES-disrupted GFP/PLC-Î´1 expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells was present not only at the plasma membrane and in the cytosol but also in the nucleus. Moreover, treatment with leptomycin B, a specific inhibitor of NES-dependent nuclear export, resulted in the accumulation of GFP/PLC-Î´1 in the nucleus. A site-directed mutant containing a pleckstrin homology domain, which does not bind inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and cannot hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in vitro, accumulated in the nucleus to a much greater extent than wild-type GFP/PLC-Î´1 after treatment with leptomycin B. These results suggest that PLC-Î´1 is shuttled between the cytoplasm and the nucleus; its nuclear export is dependent on the leucine-rich NES sequence and its active nuclear import is regulated by an unidentified signal(s).

Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 9: 262-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), its intracellular distribution is quite different. Expression of nuclear PLC-Î´4 dramatically increases at transition from the G1 to S phase, and the high expression continues to the end of the M phase (21Liu N.S. Fukami K., Yu, H.Y. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 355-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). PLC-Î²1 is constantly present in the nucleus of Swiss 3T3 cells, in which polyphosphoinositides are hydrolyzed quickly in response to insulin growth factor 1 (34Martelli A.M. Gilmour R.S. Bertagnolo V. Neri L.M. Manzoli L. Cocco L. Nature. 1992; 358: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Although there is no evidence that this breakdown is caused by nuclear PLC-Î²1, it has been reported that treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with insulin growth factor-1 induces activation of nuclear PI-PLC, a decrease in the levels of phosphatidylinositol monophosphate and PtdIns(4,5)P2, and an increase in nuclear DG levels that causes the translocation of protein kinase C-Î± (35Divecha N.

Marchisio M. Capitani S. Neri L.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These data support the idea that at least some PLC isoforms are responsible for intranuclear polyphosphoinositide turnover during cell proliferation and differentiation (39Cocco L. Gilmour R.S.

It was reported that the intracellular localization of many proteins, including the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1-coded Rev protein (44Fischer U. Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W. Luhrmann R.

Moreover, leptomycin B (LMB), an antifungal antibiotic and an inhibitor of the cell cycle in mammalian and fission yeast cells (47Yoshida M. Nishikawa M. Nishi K. Abe K. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 187: 150-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), has been shown to inhibit NES-dependent nuclear export (48Wolff B. Sanglier J.J. Wang Y. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 139-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar) by binding to CRM1, a NES receptor in the nuclear pore complex (49Nishi K. Yoshida M. Fujiwara D. Nishikawa M.

Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar).Here, we have identified residues 164â177 of PLC-Î´1 as a putative NES. We have demonstrated that disruption of the putative NES results in the nuclear localization of PLC-Î´1 in MDCK cells using a GFP fusion system and that LMB induces the nuclear accumulation of GFP/PLC-Î´1. These results suggest that the NES motif in PLC-Î´1 is functional.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we found that PLC-Î´1 has a functional NES sequence in its EF-hand domain. The EF-hand domain consists of four units of a helix-loop-helix structure (30Essen L.O. Perisic O. Cheung R. Katan M. Williams R.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), and a canonical NES sequence is present in the most N-terminal region (EF-hand 1). It has been previously reported that the EF-hand 1 contains a calcium binding motif, although there are no evidence that Ca2+ binds to this region. An x-ray crystallographic study (54Essen L.O. Perisic O. Lynch D.E. Katan M. Williams R.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2753-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and a binding study using isothermal calorimetric titration (55Grobler J.A. Hurley J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5020-5028Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) or atomic absorption 2H. Yagisawa, Y. Tamaoka, and H. Hirata, unpublished data. have suggested that there are four Ca2+ binding sites in PLC-Î´1, one in the catalytic domain and three in the C2 domain but none in the EF-hand domain.According to the molecular coordinates for a crystal of the Î(1â132) deletion variant of rat PLC-Î´1 (Protein Data Bank code 2ISD), the N terminus of EF-hand 1 lacks the expected electron density for E1Î± (the N-terminal Î±-helix of EF-hand 1) and the loop between E1Î± and F1Î± (the C-terminal Î±-helix of EF-hand 1) (30Essen L.O. Perisic O. Cheung R. Katan M. Williams R.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), indicating that EF-hand 1 is flexible. Furthermore, there is a slight difference in the F1Î± structure of the crystal in the presence of Ca2+(Protein Data Bank code 1DJI), suggesting that the conformational change of the EF-hand motif would expose the sequence that could be recognized by CRM1, a receptor and carrier protein for the NES sequence.We have also shown in this study that treatment with LMB induces the nuclear accumulation of exogenous GFP/PLC-Î´1 and endogenous PLC-Î´1. Because GFP/PLC-Î´1 and PLC-Î´1 have an apparent molecular mass of â¼110 and â¼85 kDa, respectively, nucleocytoplasmic shuttling by the passive diffusion is unlikely. Molecules with such molecular mass cannot cross the nuclear pore complexes by simple diffusion (56Ohno M. Fornerod M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1998; 92: 327-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Active nucleocytoplasmic translocation mechanisms must exist. Our results suggest that the intracellular distribution of PLC-Î´1 is regulated by two mechanisms, an NES-dependent nuclear export mechanism and an unidentified active nuclear import mechanism. In ordinary conditions, PLC-Î´1 would enter the nucleus as the result of certain stimuli such as growth factors, stress, and cell cycle-regulated signals, but the nuclear PLC-Î´1 would be immediately exported from the nucleus by NES-dependent nuclear export (Fig. 6). Because LMB blocks this NES-dependent nuclear export, PLC-Î´1 imported into the nucleus is not exported from the nucleus resulting in the nuclear accumulation of PLC-Î´1 (Fig. 6).Figure 6A model for intracellular shuttling of PLC-Î´1. PLC-Î´1 could be actively transported into the nucleus by a certain stimulus. Active PLC-Î´1 may hydrolyze PtdIns(4,5)P2 (PIP2) generating Ins(1,4,5)P3 (IP3) and DG in the nucleus. Ins(1,4,5)P3 could then increase the nuclear Ca2+ level causing a conformational change in the EF-hand domain of PLC-Î´1 to expose the NES sequence to the effector protein at the nuclear pore, CRM1. This would result in the immediate export of PLC-Î´1 from the nucleus.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The rate of entering the nucleus may be at least partly determined by the concentration of free PLC-Î´1 in the cytosol, because GFP/PLC-Î´1 R40A, which cannot bind the plasma membrane and is distributed mainly in the cytosol, accumulates more rapidly and intensely in the nucleus than the wild-type fusion protein by treatment with LMB (Fig. 4). It is noteworthy that the GFP fluorescence remains at the plasma membrane with the L172A/I174A mutant (Fig. 2) or with the wild-type fusion protein after treatment with LMB (Fig. 4) indicating strong affinity between PLC-Î´1 and the membrane.Signals responsible for translocation to the nucleus, such as a nuclear localization signal, however, have not been identified in PLC-Î´1 yet. To elucidate the nuclear localization of PLC-Î´4, Liu et al. (21Liu N.S. Fukami K., Yu, H.Y. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 355-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) have suggested that the positively charged residues in the PH domain serve as the nuclear localization signal sequence. This hypothesis, in the case of PLC-Î´1, is unlikely. When NIH3T3 cells were transfected to express the GFP-PLC-Î´1 PH domain (1â170) and treated with ionomycin, fluorescence released from the plasma membrane appeared only slowly in the nucleus (57Varnai P. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), suggesting that this nuclear accumulation was because of simple diffusion of the 40-kDa molecule into the nucleus. On our hands, neither the GFP-PLC-Î´1 PH domain containing the NES sequence (1â224) (32Fujii M. Ohtsubo M. Ogawa T. Kamata H. Hirata H. Yagisawa H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 284-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) nor that which lacks the NES sequence (1â140) (not shown) enters the nucleus of MDCK cells even when the cells were stimulated by Ca2+-mobilizing agents.The function of PLC-Î´1 in the nucleus has not been clarified. However, it has previously been demonstrated that other PLCs are responsible for nuclear polyphosphoinositide turnover. Neri et al. (36Neri M.N. Bergatti P. Capitani S. Martelli S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29738-29744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) reported that, after insulin growth factor-1 stimulation of 3T3 cells, nuclear PI-PLC is activated and causes increased intranuclear DG levels and nuclear translocation of protein kinase C-Î±. This nuclear PI-PLC activity is essential for G0/G1 to S phase transition. From such evidence, it is possible that PLC-Î´1 is also activated in the nucleus and hydrolyzes nuclear PtdIns(4,5)P2 generating Ins(1,4,5)P3 and DG. This nuclear PLC-Î´1 activity, however, may be transient. The increase in Ca2+ generated in the nucleus by Ins(1,4,5)P3 may cause a conformational change in the EF-hand domain of PLC-Î´1, exposing the NES sequence to CRM1. This would result in the immediate export of PLC-Î´1 from the nucleus (Fig. 6). The NES-dependent nuclear export mechanism would act as a rapid down-regulation system of nuclear PI-PLC. Nevertheless, it has not been revealed what induces the nuclear translocation of PLC-Î´1. It appears that targeting to the plasma membrane is not necessary for the signaling pathway by which PLC-Î´1 enters the nucleus, because the R40A mutant, which cannot be localized at the plasma membrane, is more potently translocated into the nucleus. It is possible that a novel association molecule(s) mediates this signaling pathway.In the future, it will be important to identify any novel association molecule(s), and also it would be particularly intriguing to reveal the physiological meaning of this nucleocytoplasmic translocation of PLC-Î´1.

PI-PLC hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) generating inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) and diacylglycerol (DG), both of which act as second messengers in cells.

Moreover, leptomycin B (LMB), an antifungal antibiotic and an inhibitor of the cell cycle in mammalian and fission yeast cells (47Yoshida M. Nishikawa M. Nishi K. Abe K. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 187: 150-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), has been shown to inhibit NES-dependent nuclear export (48Wolff B. Sanglier J.J. Wang Y. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 139-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar) by binding to CRM1, a NES receptor in the nuclear pore complex (49Nishi K. Yoshida M. Fujiwara D. Nishikawa M.

We have demonstrated that disruption of the putative NES results in the nuclear localization of PLC-Î´1 in MDCK cells using a GFP fusion system and that LMB induces the nuclear accumulation of GFP/PLC-Î´1. These results suggest that the NES motif in PLC-Î´1 is functional. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we found that PLC-Î´1 has a functional NES sequence in its EF-hand domain. The EF-hand domain consists of four units of a helix-loop-helix structure (30Essen L.O. Perisic O. Cheung R. Katan M. Williams R.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), and a canonical NES sequence is present in the most N-terminal region (EF-hand 1). It has been previously reported that the EF-hand 1 contains a calcium binding motif, although there are no evidence that Ca2+ binds to this region. An x-ray crystallographic study (54Essen L.O. Perisic O. Lynch D.E. Katan M. Williams R.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2753-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and a binding study using isothermal calorimetric titration (55Grobler J.A. Hurley J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5020-5028Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) or atomic absorption 2H. Yagisawa, Y. Tamaoka, and H. Hirata, unpublished data. have suggested that there are four Ca2+ binding sites in PLC-Î´1, one in the catalytic domain and three in the C2 domain but none in the EF-hand domain.According to the molecular coordinates for a crystal of the Î(1â132) deletion variant of rat PLC-Î´1 (Protein Data Bank code 2ISD), the N terminus of EF-hand 1 lacks the expected electron density for E1Î± (the N-terminal Î±-helix of EF-hand 1) and the loop between E1Î± and F1Î± (the C-terminal Î±-helix of EF-hand 1) (30Essen L.O. Perisic O. Cheung R. Katan M. Williams R.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), indicating that EF-hand 1 is flexible. Furthermore, there is a slight difference in the F1Î± structure of the crystal in the presence of Ca2+(Protein Data Bank code 1DJI), suggesting that the conformational change of the EF-hand motif would expose the sequence that could be recognized by CRM1, a receptor and carrier protein for the NES sequence.We have also shown in this study that treatment with LMB induces the nuclear accumulation of exogenous GFP/PLC-Î´1 and endogenous PLC-Î´1. Because GFP/PLC-Î´1 and PLC-Î´1 have an apparent molecular mass of â¼110 and â¼85 kDa, respectively, nucleocytoplasmic shuttling by the passive diffusion is unlikely. Molecules with such molecular mass cannot cross the nuclear pore complexes by simple diffusion (56Ohno M. Fornerod M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1998; 92: 327-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Active nucleocytoplasmic translocation mechanisms must exist. Our results suggest that the intracellular distribution of PLC-Î´1 is regulated by two mechanisms, an NES-dependent nuclear export mechanism and an unidentified active nuclear import mechanism. In ordinary conditions, PLC-Î´1 would enter the nucleus as the result of certain stimuli such as growth factors, stress, and cell cycle-regulated signals, but the nuclear PLC-Î´1 would be immediately exported from the nucleus by NES-dependent nuclear export (Fig. 6). Because LMB blocks this NES-dependent nuclear export, PLC-Î´1 imported into the nucleus is not exported from the nucleus resulting in the nuclear accumulation of PLC-Î´1 (Fig. 6).The rate of entering the nucleus may be at least partly determined by the concentration of free PLC-Î´1 in the cytosol, because GFP/PLC-Î´1 R40A, which cannot bind the plasma membrane and is distributed mainly in the cytosol, accumulates more rapidly and intensely in the nucleus than the wild-type fusion protein by treatment with LMB (Fig. 4). It is noteworthy that the GFP fluorescence remains at the plasma membrane with the L172A/I174A mutant (Fig. 2) or with the wild-type fusion protein after treatment with LMB (Fig. 4) indicating strong affinity between PLC-Î´1 and the membrane.Signals responsible for translocation to the nucleus, such as a nuclear localization signal, however, have not been identified in PLC-Î´1 yet. To elucidate the nuclear localization of PLC-Î´4, Liu et al. (21Liu N.S. Fukami K., Yu, H.Y. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 355-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) have suggested that the positively charged residues in the PH domain serve as the nuclear localization signal sequence. This hypothesis, in the case of PLC-Î´1, is unlikely. When NIH3T3 cells were transfected to express the GFP-PLC-Î´1 PH domain (1â170) and treated with ionomycin, fluorescence released from the plasma membrane appeared only slowly in the nucleus (57Varnai P. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), suggesting that this nuclear accumulation was because of simple diffusion of the 40-kDa molecule into the nucleus. On our hands, neither the GFP-PLC-Î´1 PH domain containing the NES sequence (1â224) (32Fujii M. Ohtsubo M. Ogawa T. Kamata H. Hirata H. Yagisawa H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 284-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) nor that which lacks the NES sequence (1â140) (not shown) enters the nucleus of MDCK cells even when the cells were stimulated by Ca2+-mobilizing agents.The function of PLC-Î´1 in the nucleus has not been clarified. However, it has previously been demonstrated that other PLCs are responsible for nuclear polyphosphoinositide turnover. Neri et al. (36Neri M.N. Bergatti P. Capitani S. Martelli S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29738-29744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) reported that, after insulin growth factor-1 stimulation of 3T3 cells, nuclear PI-PLC is activated and causes increased intranuclear DG levels and nuclear translocation of protein kinase C-Î±. This nuclear PI-PLC activity is essential for G0/G1 to S phase transition. From such evidence, it is possible that PLC-Î´1 is also activated in the nucleus and hydrolyzes nuclear PtdIns(4,5)P2 generating Ins(1,4,5)P3 and DG. This nuclear PLC-Î´1 activity, however, may be transient. The increase in Ca2+ generated in the nucleus by Ins(1,4,5)P3 may cause a conformational change in the EF-hand domain of PLC-Î´1, exposing the NES sequence to CRM1. This would result in the immediate export of PLC-Î´1 from the nucleus (Fig. 6). The NES-dependent nuclear export mechanism would act as a rapid down-regulation system of nuclear PI-PLC. Nevertheless, it has not been revealed what induces the nuclear translocation of PLC-Î´1. It appears that targeting to the plasma membrane is not necessary for the signaling pathway by which PLC-Î´1 enters the nucleus, because the R40A mutant, which cannot be localized at the plasma membrane, is more potently translocated into the nucleus. It is possible that a novel association molecule(s) mediates this signaling pathway.In the future, it will be important to identify any novel association molecule(s), and also it would be particularly intriguing to reveal the physiological meaning of this nucleocytoplasmic translocation of PLC-Î´1. In this study, we found that PLC-Î´1 has a functional NES sequence in its EF-hand domain. The EF-hand domain consists of four units of a helix-loop-helix structure (30Essen L.O. Perisic O. Cheung R.

The final model, which comprises 5312 protein atoms (residues 1 to 686) and 28 carbohydrate atoms (from two monosaccharides attached to Asn473), gives an R-factor of 0.231 for the 11,989 observed reflections between 20.0- and 3.0-â« resolution. In the structure, both empty iron binding clefts are in the open conformation, lending weight to the theory that Fe3+binding or release in transferrin proceeds via a mechanism that involves domain opening and closure. Upon opening, the domains rotate essentially as rigid bodies. The two domains of the N-lobe rotate away from one another by 53Â°, whereas the C-lobe domains rotate away each another by 35Â°. These rotations take place about an axis that passes through the two Î²-strands, linking the domains. The domains of each lobe make different contacts with one another in the open and closed forms. These contacts form two interdomain interfaces on either side of the rotation axis, and domain opening or closing produces a see-saw motion between these two alternative close-packed interfaces. The interdomain disulfide bridge (Cys478-Cys671), found only in the C-lobe, may restrict domain opening but does not completely prevent it.

The interdomain disulfide bridge (Cys478-Cys671), found only in the C-lobe, may restrict domain opening but does not completely prevent it. Transferrins are a group of iron-binding proteins that includes serum transferrin, ovotransferrin, and lactoferrin (1Aisen P. Listowsky I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 357-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). These proteins serve to control the levels of iron in the body fluids of vertebrates by their ability to bind very tightly two Fe3+ ions together with two CO32âions. Serum transferrins and ovotransferrin can act as iron transporters, whereas the lactoferrins possess an antimicrobial activity (2Arnold R.R. Cole M.F. McGhee J.R. Science. 1977; 197: 263-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) and a sequence-specific DNA binding capacity (3He J. Furmanski P. Nature. 1995; 373: 721-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The â¼80-kDa transferrin molecule consists of two similarly sized homologous N- and C-lobes, which are further divided into two similarly sized domains (N1 and N2 in the N-lobe; C1 and C2 in the C-lobe). The two iron binding sites are located within the interdomain cleft of each lobe. Crystal structures of the fully iron-loaded diferric forms (4Bailey S. Evans R.W. Garratt R.C. Gorinsky B. Hasnain S.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7919-7928Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) of several transferrins reveal that the two domains of each lobe are closed over an Fe3+ ion. Four of the six Fe3+ coordination sites are occupied by protein ligands (2 Tyr residues, 1 Asp, and 1 His) and the other two by a bidentate carbonate anion. The recent x-ray structure of theHemophilus influenzae Fe3+-binding protein has revealed that its overall structure, apart from consisting of a single lobe, is remarkably similar to that of the transferrin family (12Bruns C.M. Nowalk A.J. Arvai A.S. McTigue M.A. Vaughan K.G. Mietzner T.A. McRee D.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 919-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The ligands to iron are, however, a phosphate oxygen, a water molecule, and four protein ligands (2 Tyr residues, 1 Glu, and 1 His). Except for the carboxylate ligand, the other three protein ligands of the Fe3+-binding protein are all located in different parts of the protein fold from those of the transferrins, indicating convergent evolution for the development of the Fe3+ binding function (12Bruns C.M.

It is generally believed that the two domains of each transferrin lobe must open to allow entry or release of Fe3+ (13Baker E.N. Rumball S.V. Anderson B.F. Trends Biochem.

The iron-loaded holo form shows a higher affinity for the transferrin receptor than does the apo form, indicating that iron-dependent conformational changes may be important in the cellular uptake of iron (17Young S.P.

D. 1996; 52: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), data for the bilobal apo form is limited. The crystal structure of the apo form of human lactoferrin has been determined at 2.8-â« resolution by Anderson et al. (14Anderson B.F. Baker H.M. Norris G.E. Rumball S.V. Baker E.N. Nature. 1990; 344: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) and recently at 2.0-â« resolution by Jameson et al. (21Jameson G.B. Anderson B.F. Norris G.E. Thomas D.H. Baker E.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1998; 54: 1319-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In that structure the iron binding cleft in the N-lobe is wide open when compared with the closed holo structure. Upon uptake or release of iron, domains N1 and N2 rotate 54Â° away from one another as rigid bodies around a rotation axis that passes through the two antiparallel Î²-strands linking the domains. By contrast, the C-lobe is found in the closed conformation in both the holo and apo forms. This unexpected lack of conformational change may be related to the presence of an interdomain disulfide bridge (Cys483-Cys677) in the C-lobe of lactoferrin. It is also possible that lactoferrin might lack, because of its non-iron-transporting nature, an open/close mechanism that might be important for the selective recognition of the holo form by the receptor. The absence in human (5Anderson B.F. Baker H.M. Norris G.E. Rice D.W. Baker E.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 711-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) and bovine (22Moore S.A. Anderson B.F.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11963-11968Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), is another structural point that differentiates the lactoferrins from the iron-transporting transferrins. Ovotransferrin, a major egg white protein, should share the same structural characteristics as hen serum transferrin, which functions as an iron transporter, since these proteins are derived from the same gene and differ only in their attached carbohydrate (23Thibodeau S.N. Lee D.C. Palmiter R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3771-3774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although anin vivo iron transport function for ovotransferrin has not been proved, specific transferrin receptor interactions have been demonstrated for the protein (18Mason A.B. Brown S.A.

Hen ovotransferrin possesses the same six disulfide bridge pattern in the N-lobe as that observed in human lactoferrin: two bridges in the N1-domain and four in the N2-domain. There is, therefore, no interdomain disulfide bridge in the N-lobe of either protein (25Williams J. Elleman T.C. Kingston I.B. Wilkins A.G. Kuhn K.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 122: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 26Williams J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1982; 7: 394-400Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 27Crichton R.R. Charloteaux-Wauters M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 485-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). This six-disulfide motif is also observed in the C-lobes of ovotransferrin and lactoferrin. There are, however, three and four additional disulfides, respectively, in the ovotransferrin and lactoferrin C-lobes. One of the disulfides of the ovotransferrin C-lobe exists as the interdomain disulfide Cys478-Cys671 (6Kurokawa H. Mikami B. Hirose M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 196-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and is found in an equivalent site to the lactoferrin interdomain disulfide Cys483-Cys677 (5Anderson B.F. Baker H.M. Norris G.E. Rice D.W. Baker E.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 711-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). This suggests that if a restriction of domain opening is caused by the interdomain cross-link, it may operate in a similar manner in the two proteins. We report here the x-ray crystal structure of hen apo-ovotransferrin determined at 3.0-â« resolution. Comparison of the current apo structure with the previous holo structure (6Kurokawa H. Mikami B. Hirose M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 196-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) shows that both lobes adopt an open conformation upon iron release. Apo form of hen ovotransferrin was purified as described previously (28Hirose M. Oe H. Doi E. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1986; 50: 59-64Google Scholar). Colorless apo-ovotransferrin crystals were grown at 4 Â°C by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method where 5 Î¼l of protein solution (85 mg/ml, pH 6.0, 0.02 m acetate buffer) was mixed with 5 Î¼l of precipitant solution (4â6% polyethylene glycol 6000, pH 6.0, 0.02 m acetate buffer) on a silanized coverslip that was inverted and sealed above 0.7 ml of the precipitant solution. The crystal used for data collection was the largest available and had approximate dimensions of 2.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 mm. Many crystals were examined, but the data set employed herein was the best obtained to date. X-ray data were collected at â150 Â°C (29Dewan J.C. Tilton R.F. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1987; 20: 130-132Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) with CuKÎ±radiation (Î»=1.5418 â«) using a Siemens Hi-Star area detector coupled to a MacScience M18XHF rotating-anode generator. A total of 31,370 reflections was collected and averaged (Rsymm = 0.069), yielding 12,920 unique data (80% complete). The meanI/Ï(I) for the data set was 6.5. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using X-PLOR (30BruÌnger A.T. X-PLOR , Version 3.85. Yale University, New Haven, CT1996Google Scholar). The only search model to give the correct solution was the diferric ovotransferrin (6Kurokawa H. Mikami B. Hirose M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 196-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) C-lobe, with the domains opened by 40Â°. The N1-domain was then placed in the same relative orientation as domains N1/C1 of the diferric structure. After rigid body refinement, the N2-domain could be fitted into its electron density. Rigid body refinement, simulated annealing, and positional and B-factor refinement (30BruÌnger A.T. X-PLOR , Version 3.85. Yale University, New Haven, CT1996Google Scholar) have resulted in a finalr = 0.231 (Rfree = 0.265) for the 11,989 reflections (75% cimoleteness) with F > 2Ï(F) between 20.0 and 3.0-â« resolution. A bulk solvent correction was applied to the data. The final model consists of 5312 non-hydrogen protein atoms (residues 1â686) and 28 carbohydrate atoms (two residues attached to Asn473). Further experimental details appear in Table I. Model building and superposition of the structures were performed with TURBO-FRODO (Biographics).Table IStatistics for data collection and refinement of hen apo-ovotransferrinCrystal systemTetragonalSpace groupP43212Unit cell (â«)a = b = 92.26, c = 178.19Molecules/asymetric unit1DetectorSiemens Hi-StarCrystal-detector distance (cm)15No. crystals1Resolution limit (â«)3.0Scan width (Â°/frame)0.25Scan speed (Â°/min)0.25Scan range Ï-scan0â45Â° (2Î¸ = 15Â°, Ï = 0Â°) Ï-scan0â45Â° (2Î¸ = 15Â°, Ï = 30Â°)Measured reflections31,370Unique reflections12,920 [âIâ > Ï (I)]Completeness (%)80.0Rsymm on I (%)6.9Final model1â686 residues, 2 sugarsResolution range (â«)20.0â3.0Reflections11,989 [âFâ > 2Ï(F)]Completeness (%)75.0R-factor (%)23.1Rfree(%)26.5Root mean square bond length (â«)0.010 angle (Â°)1.70 Open table in a new tab The final model is comprised of the entire polypeptide chain (residues 1 to 686). In the final 2Fo â Fc electron density map, there are no breaks in the main-chain density when contoured at the 1Ï level. Two sugar residues are also included in the model attached to Asn473. The root mean square deviations from standard bond lengths and angles are 0.010 â« and 1.70Â°, respectively (TableI). A Ramachandran plot of the main-chain torsion angles shows that 60% of the residues are in the core regions, with 95% lying within the allowed regions as defined by the program PROCHECK (31Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Two non-glycine residues (Leu299 and Leu636) lie outside the allowed regions of conformational space (Ï = 64Â°, Ï = â48Â°, and Ï = 69Â°, Ï = â55Â°, respectively); both are the central residues of two Î³-turns in equivalent positions in each ovotransferrin lobe. The apo-ovotransferrin structure, superimposed on that of diferric ovotransferrin (Protein Data Bank code 1OVT) (6Kurokawa H. Mikami B. Hirose M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 196-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), is shown as a ribbon trace in Fig.1. There is no difference in the secondary structure assignment (Î²-strands a-k and Î±-helices 1â12) between the holo and apo forms (6Kurokawa H. Mikami B. Hirose M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 196-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). As in the diferric ovotransferrin structure, hen apo-ovotransferrin is folded into two homologous N- and C-lobes, and each of the lobes is divided into two distinct and similarly sized Î±/Î² domains (N-lobe: N1- and N2-domains; C- lobe: C1- and C2-domains). The two empty iron binding sites are located between the two domains in each lobe, and the two domains are linked by two antiparallel Î²-strands (e and j) that run behind the iron binding site of each lobe. Both iron binding clefts of apo-ovotransferrin are in the open conformation. The N2- and C2-domains move away from the N1- and C1-domains, respectively, almost as rigid bodies. Between the open and closed forms, the root mean square deviation of equivalent C-Î± atoms that are within a distance of 2.0 â« of one another is 1.02 â« for the N1-domain (186 C-Î± atoms) and 1.12 â« for the N2-domain (160 C-Î± atoms). For the C-lobe, these values are 1.06 â« for the C1-domain (204 C-Î± atoms) and 0.87 â« for the C2-domain (180 C-Î± atoms). The major conformational changes occur in the hinge regions on the two Î²-strands that link the domains of each lobe. In addition to the domain opening in the two lobes, there is a small rotation of the C1-domain relative to the N1-domain. The value of the rotation is 7Â°, suggesting that the N1- and C1-domains remain relatively fixed with respect to one another. Two GlcNAc residues attached to Asn473 reside between the C1- and C2-domains. To characterize the conformational changes that have occurred upon domain opening, the domain motion in each lobe was considered separately as a rotation and a translation (32Gerstein M. Anderson B.F. Norris G.E. Baker E.N. Lesk A.M. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 357-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In the N-lobe the N1-domains of the open and closed forms were superimposed, and the rotation and translation required to superimpose the N2-domains were determined to be 53Â° and 1.8 â«, respectively (Fig. 2 a). The rotation axis passes close to residues Ser91 and Val247 and is nearly parallel to a line through the C-Î± atoms of these two residues (Fig. 3). The same analysis was applied to the motion in the C-lobe. A 35Â° rotation, with a 0.2-â« translation, was required to superimpose the C2-domains of the open and closed forms (Fig. 2 b). The rotation axis passes close to residues Ala429 and Val589 and is nearly parallel to a line through the two C-Î± atoms of these residues (Fig. 3). The C-Î± atoms of Cys478 and Cys671, which form the C-lobe interdomain disulfide bridge, also lie close to this axis (Fig. 3). In either the N- or C-lobe, domain 2 translates only 1.8 or 0.2 â« with respect to domain 1, and thus, the motions of the N2- or C2-domains relative to the N1- or C1-domains are almost a pure rotation about the two central residues in each hinge.Figure 3The two hinges in the open apo-ovotransferrin N-lobe (left) and C-lobe (right). The views are as shown in Fig. 2, but rotated by 90Â°. The rotation axes, indicated by horizontal lines, are parallel to the plane of the page and perpendicular to the viewing direction. The C-Î± atoms of Ser91 and Val247 for the N-lobe and of Ala429 and Val589 for the C-lobe are indicated by open spheres. The shaded spheres in the C-lobe are the C-Î± atoms of Cys478 and Cys671. The carbohydrate moiety in the apo-ovotransferrin C-lobe is drawn as aball-and-stick representation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The two lobes of ovotransferrin make different interdomain contacts when in the open or closed form (Fig. 2). Most of the contacting residues are grouped into two categories: 1) those that make contact only in the closed form and 2) those that make contact only in the open form. Fig.4 shows the positions of the contacting residues in the open and closed forms. In the closed form there are 22 contacting residues observed for the N-lobe and 16 for the C-lobe. The differences in the accessible surface areas of these residues, between the open and closed forms, are listed in TableII. Almost all of the residues that make contact with the other domain in the closed form are exposed in the open form. In the open form there are 13 contacting residues for the N-lobe and 9 for the C-lobe, and most of them are exposed in the closed form (Table II). The contacting residues in the closed form are found mostly in the interdomain binding cleft and form the large interface. The contacting residues in the open form are located on the opposite side of the rotation axis and constitute the small interface. The alternating exposure and burying of the interfaces on either side of the rotation axis constitutes a âsee-sawâ motion that has been noted before by Gerstein et al. (32Gerstein M. Anderson B.F. Norris G.E. Baker E.N. Lesk A.M. Chothia C. J. Mol.

The different interdomain contacts in the apo and holo forms play a role in Fe3+ binding stability. For example, helix 11 (residues 321â332 in the N-lobe; 658â669 in the C-lobe) is located in the small interface, and 6 and 4 residues of the helix, respectively, in the N- and C-lobes participate in interdomain contacts (Table II). Previous observations have stressed the importance of the helix in Fe3+ binding stability. The removal of residues 280 to 332 from the ovotransferrin N-lobe results in a greatly reduced Fe3+ binding stability (33Kurokawa H. Mikami B. Hirose M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6671-6676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, helix 11 occurs in both lobes of lactoferrin and is disordered in the isolated N-lobe crystal structure. This half molecule displays a much lower Fe3+ binding affinity (10Day C.L. Anderson B.F. Tweedie J.W. Baker E.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 1084-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Fig.5 shows the superposition, on domain 1 in each case, of three open apo-transferrin lobes, namely the N- and C-lobes of apo-ovotransferrin and the apo-lactoferrin N-lobe (Protein Data Bank code 1LFH). The root mean square deviation of equivalent C-Î± atoms that are within 2 â« of one another is 1.09 â« between the N1-domain of apo-ovotransferrin and the N1-domain of apo-lactoferrin (199 C-Î± atoms) and 1.10 â« between the N1-domain and C1-domain of apo-ovotransferrin (161 C-Î± atoms). The extent and orientation of the opening in each lobe, however, are all different. When the different modes of domain opening are expressed as the relative orientations of the rotation axes of domain, the axis of the apo-ovotransferrin N-lobe intersects those of the apo-ovotransferrin C-lobe and of opening, the apo-lactoferrin N-lobe with angles of 17.5Â° and 12.3Â°, respectively. The rotation axes of the apo-ovotransferrin C-lobe and the apo-lactoferrin N-lobe can be related to one another by a rotation of 12.4Â° and a 1.0-â« translation. Such differences may be accounted for, at least in part, by different hinge sequences. Table III shows a sequence alignment of the hinge regions (part of Î²-strands e and j) in vertebrate transferrins. Other than the iron-coordinating ligands (Tyr92, His250, Tyr431, and His592 in the ovotransferrin sequence), several highly conserved residues are observed. Ala94 (Ala433in the C-lobe) and Ala245 (Ala587 in the C-lobe) are conserved in both the N- and C-lobes of all the vertebrate transferrins except for the substitution of a Ser residue in the rabbit transferrin C-lobe. Thr90, Tyr93, and Val247 are also conserved in all the N-lobes of the transferrins. Ser88 (Arg427 in the C-lobe), Ser91 (Ser430 in the C-lobe), and Ala249 (Thr591 in the C-lobe) are, however, unique residues in the avian transferrin as compared with the mammalian transferrins. Another unique residue to the avian protein is Val589 in the C-lobe; this residue is located at the equivalent position of Val247, that is conserved in the N-lobes of all the transferrins. The hinge residues that are unique to the ovotransferrin N-lobe are Trp244 and Ala248; at positions 244 and 248 (positions 586 and 590 in the C-lobe) Leu and Pro residues are, respectively, conserved in both lobes of all the other transferrins, including the C-lobe of ovotransferrin.Table IIISequence alignment of vertebrate transferrins in the hinge regionsN-Lobe88 91 94244 247 250 Hen ovotransferrin S T T S Y Y A W A R V A A H Human lactoferrin P R T H Y Y A L A R V P S H Bovine lactoferrin P Q T H Y Y A L A Q V P S H Human transferrin P Q T F Y Y A L A Q V P S H Rabbit t"

The purpose of the present study was to determine whether diminution of PITSLRE kinases leads to deregulation of apoptosis. The human melanoma cell lines A375 (Cdc2L wild-type alleles) and UACC 1227 (mutant Cdc2L alleles) were tested with agonist anti-Fas monoclonal antibody. We found that exposure of these cells to anti-Fas for 24, 48, or 72 h resulted in differential sensitivity to Fas-induced apoptosis. In A375, cell death started at 24â48 h post-treatment, and it was maximal by 72 h. Conversely, UACC 1227 cells were resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis. Induction of PITSLRE histone H1 kinase activity was observed in A375 anti-Fas treated but not in UACC 1227 cells. Also, the PITSLRE protein kinase activity in A375 anti-Fas-treated cells preceded maximal levels of apoptosis. Finally, fluorescence confocal microscopy revealed a nuclear localization of PITSLRE proteins in normal melanocytes and A375 cells but a cytoplasmic localization in UACC 1227 cells. The differences in PITSLRE protein and cellular localization between A375 and UACC 1227 cells appear to account for the differences in sensitivity of the two cells lines to anti-Fas and staurosporine. These observations suggest that alterations in PITSLRE gene expression and protein localization may result in the loss of apoptotic signaling.

Cornelis S. Van de Craen M. Denecker G. Lahti J.M. Gururajan R. Vandenabeele P. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11694-11697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ectopic expression of a p50-PITSLRE construct that resembles the final caspase-modified product induces apoptosis in CHO cells (25Lahti J.M. Xiang J. Heath L. Campana D. Kidd V.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Finally, Fas-mediated T-cell death is correlated with PITSLRE proteolysis and increased histone H1 kinase activity (25Lahti J.M. Xiang J. Heath L. Campana D. Kidd V.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The purpose of the present study was to determine whether alterations in the PITSLRE isoforms could lead to a disruption in the apoptotic signaling pathway(s) in cultured melanoma cells.DISCUSSIONPrevious studies in our laboratory using fluorescence in situ hybridization indicated that one allele of the PITSLRE gene complex on chromosome 1 was either deleted or translocated in several melanoma cell lines. Furthermore, the expression of PITSLRE proteins from the remaining allele was decreased in several melanoma cell lines and surgical melanoma specimens (21Nelson M.A. Ariza M.E. Yang J.M. Thompson F.H. Taetle R. Trent J.F. Wymer J. Massey-Brown K. Broome-Powell M. Easton J. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. Cancer Genet.

Similar results have been observed in neuroblastoma and in childhood endodermal sinus tumors (20Lahti J.M. Valentine M. Xiang J. Jones B. Amann J. Grenet J. Richmond G. Look A.T. Kidd V.J. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 370-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, the functional consequences of genetic alterations within the Cdc2L locus encoding the PITSLRE kinases in regards to the development of melanoma are not known. Because the PITSLRE p110 isoforms may be involved in apoptosis, we wanted to evaluate the functional consequences of PITSLRE gene alterations with regard to Fas-mediated apoptotic signaling in melanoma cell lines.In the present study, we provide evidence that the melanoma cell lines A375 and UACC 1227 express Fas receptor and that anti-Fas mAb induces apoptosis in A375, but not in UACC 1227 cells. Morphological changes consistent with apoptosis including cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation, and membrane blebbing were observed in the A375 Fas-sensitive cells, but not in the UACC 1227 Fas-resistant cells.We demonstrate that the A375 melanoma cells, which have normal Cdc2L alleles and normal PITSLRE protein expression, are sensitive to Fas-induced apoptosis. In contrast, UACC 1227 cells, which have decreased PITSLRE expression and mutant alleles, do not undergo Fas-induced apoptosis. In addition, an increase in PITSLRE kinase activity was observed in A375 Fas-sensitive cells, but not in the UACC 1227-resistant cell line. Stimulation of PITSLRE kinase activity was also observed in A375 cells following staurosporine treatment. The stimulation of PITSLRE kinase activity was markedly reduced (50â60%) by caspase inhibitors DEV-FMK or IETD during Fas- and staurosporine-mediated cell death. We also report the caspase cleavage of PITSLRE protein and PARP during Fas-induced apoptosis. These observations demonstrate that PITSLRE kinase activation is associated with Fas- and staurosporine-mediated apoptosis in melanoma cells. Furthermore, the data presented here suggest that multiple caspases appear to be involved in the cleavage of PITSLRE during Fas-induced apoptosis in A375 cells. Recently, it has been reported that PITSLRE kinases are specifically cleaved in response to TNF by caspases 1 and 3 resulting in the activation of the PITSLRE kinase, both in vivo and in vitro (27Beyaert R. Kidd V.J. Cornelis S. Van de Craen M. Denecker G. Lahti J.M. Gururajan R. Vandenabeele P. Fiers W. J. Biol.

However, the proteases responsible for the processing and activation of PITSLRE kinases in melanoma and the importance of this processing in apoptosis are unknown. We also demonstrate that caspases 3 and 8 are involved in the Fas signaling pathway in melanoma cells, and caspase 3 is involved in staurosporine-mediated cell death, which is consistent with the published reports on PITSLRE p110 isoforms being cleaved and activated by caspases during apoptosis (27Beyaert R. Kidd V.J. Cornelis S. Van de Craen M. Denecker G. Lahti J.M. Gururajan R. Vandenabeele P. Fiers W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 16601-16607Google Scholar).Finally, in this study we demonstrate that there is a difference in the subcellular localization of p110 PITSLRE isoforms in UACC 1227 melanoma cells relative to normal melanocytes. This result suggests that UACC 1227 cells express PITSLRE proteins that either lack the nuclear translocation signal or that contain a point mutation affecting this region of the protein. The amino-terminal domain also contains several distinct regions that may specify nuclear localization and protein stability (32Bunnell B.A. Heath L.S. Adams D.E. Lahti J. Kidd V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7467-7571Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 33Kidd V.J. Luo W. Xiang J. Easton J. McCune S. Snead M.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 85-93PubMed Google Scholar). Current studies in our laboratory, involving polymerase chain reaction-SSCP and direct DNA sequence analysis, suggest that UACC 1227 cells have a mutation(s) in the nuclear localization signal, which may explain the abnormal cytoplasmic localization of p110 PITSLRE isoforms. Loss or inactivation of the nuclear translocation signal in UACC 1227 cells and consequent cytoplasmic localization of p110 PITSLRE isoforms. In addition, resistance to Fas suggests a functional role of PITSLRE protein kinases in mediating Fas-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, if we consider a role for PITSLRE p110 isoforms in Fas-mediated signal transduction processes, altered distribution of PITSLRE kinases in transformed cells may contribute to the transformed phenotype by deregulating the processes of apoptosis, spliceosome formation, or assembly/disassembly of nuclear speckles, which is involved in the regulation of RNA splicing/transcription (26Loyer P. Lahti J.M. Trembley J.H. Kidd V.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1495-1506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).A question that remains unknown is the identity of the substrate that executes the final death sentence following activation of caspases. One candidate (or family of candidates) is the PITSLRE kinases. PITSLRE kinase proteins have been shown to be processed and activated in cells treated with anti-Fas and TNF (25Lahti J.M. Xiang J. Heath L. Campana D. Kidd V.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 27Beyaert R. Kidd V.J. Cornelis S. Van de Craen M. Denecker G. Lahti J.M. Gururajan R.

Chem. 1999; 274: 16601-16607Google Scholar). Circumstantial evidence suggests that, following the processing and activation of PITSLRE kinases, they may be released from associated restraining molecules to execute the final death sentence. However, this important role for the PITSLRE kinases as final executioners of apoptosis needs to be further investigated. The mechanism that we are proposing to explain the role of PITSLRE protein kinases during apoptosis in malignant melanoma cells is shown in Fig. 9. Activation of Fas receptor by anti-Fas monoclonal antibody results in the aggregation and rapid recruitment of FADD (11Chinnaiyan A.M. Orth K. O'Rourke K. Duan H. Poirier G.G. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4573-4576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). The interaction of FADD and Fas through their carboxyl-terminal death domains unmasks the amino-terminal death effector domain of FADD, allowing it to recruit and activate pro-caspase-8 to the Fas signaling complex (34Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Ni J. Scaffidi C. Bretz J.D. Zhang M. Gentz R. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 85: 817-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (2723) Google Scholar), Caspase 8 activates pro-caspase 3 either directly (pathway 2) or indirectly through cytochrome c release from the mitochondria (pathway 1). Cytochrome c forms a complex with apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (Apaf-1) that binds and activates pro-caspase 9 (35Liu X. Zou H. Slaugher C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar). Activated caspase 9 binds to and activates pro-caspase 3. Our data indicate that PITSLRE kinase activation precedes Fas-induced apoptosis, and it is a downstream event. Because PITSLRE kinases have cleavage sites for caspases 3 and 8 and it has been shown that PITSLRE p110 isoforms are cleaved by these caspases during Fas-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells, we are proposing that PITSLRE kinases get cleaved and activated by caspases 3 and 8 in melanoma cells. Activation of PITSLRE protein kinase results in the phosphorylation and activation of unknown downstream substrates and subsequent transcription of genes involved in the final stages of apoptosis. Staurosporine-induced cell death is also another operational apoptotic pathway present in malignant melanoma cells and is shown in Fig. 9. The fact that staurosporine-induced cell death, which bypasses receptor-mediated signaling, is altered in UACC 1227 cells suggests that PITSLRE kinases are involved in the staurosporine death signaling pathway. Furthermore, these data demonstrate that PITSLRE protein kinases are involved in Fas-, staurosporine-, and DR3-mediated cell death signaling pathways. However, the function of these PITSLRE kinases during apoptosis is not known.Finally, the data presented here suggests that alterations in Cdc2L gene expression and protein localization can result in the loss or deregulation of apoptotic signaling pathway(s). Therefore, altered PITSLRE kinases may represent a different mechanism from that reported for Fas ligand that could contribute to the immune privilege in malignant melanoma (36Hahne M. Rimoldi D. Schroter M. Romero P. Schreier M. French L.E. Schneider P. Bornand T. Fontana A. Lienard D. Cerotini J. Tschopp J. Science. 1996; 274: 1363-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). Deregulation of apoptotic signaling pathways may represent a mechanism to enhance tumorigenesis by preventing the elimination of these cells through normal checkpoint control. Apoptosis is a highly regulated process that plays a major role in development and homeostasis (1Rokhlin O.W. Bishop G.A. Hostager B.S. Waldschmidt T.J. Sidorenko S.P. Pavloff N. Kiefer M.C.

We have also shown that one allele of the Cdc2L locus on 1p36 was either deleted or translocated in eight of fourteen different melanoma cell lines (21Nelson M.A. Ariza M.E. Yang J.M. Thompson F.H.

Decreased expression of the PITSLRE proteins from the remaining allele was observed in several cell lines and surgical malignant melanoma specimens (21Nelson M.A. Ariza M.E. Yang J.M. Thompson F.H.

The PITSLRE proteins are part of the large family of p34cdc2-related kinases whose functions appear to be linked to control of cell division and possibly programmed cell death (22Meyerson M.

The PITSLRE p110 isoforms are reported to be involved in the regulation of RNA splicing/transcription during the cell cycle (26Loyer P. Lahti J.M. Trembley J.H. Kidd V.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1495-1506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The larger p110 PITSLRE isoforms are also cleaved by multiple caspases during Fas- and TNFÎ±-induced cell death (27Beyaert R. Kidd V.J. Cornelis S. Van de Craen M. Denecker G. Lahti J.M. Gururajan R. Vandenabeele P. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11694-11697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ectopic expression of a p50-PITSLRE construct that resembles the final caspase-modified product induces apoptosis in CHO cells (25Lahti J.M. Xiang J. Heath L. Campana D. Kidd V.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Finally, Fas-mediated T-cell death is correlated with PITSLRE proteolysis and increased histone H1 kinase activity (25Lahti J.M. Xiang J. Heath L. Campana D. Kidd V.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The purpose of the present study was to determine whether alterations in the PITSLRE isoforms could lead to a disruption in the apoptotic signaling pathway(s) in cultured melanoma cells. DISCUSSIONPrevious studies in our laboratory using fluorescence in situ hybridization indicated that one allele of the PITSLRE gene complex on chromosome 1 was either deleted or translocated in several melanoma cell lines. Furthermore, the expression of PITSLRE proteins from the remaining allele was decreased in several melanoma cell lines and surgical melanoma specimens (21Nelson M.A. Ariza M.E. Yang J.M. Thompson F.H. Taetle R. Trent J.F. Wymer J. Massey-Brown K. Broome-Powell M. Easton J. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. 1999; 108: 91-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Similar results have been observed in neuroblastoma and in childhood endodermal sinus tumors (20Lahti J.M. Valentine M. Xiang J. Jones B. Amann J. Grenet J. Richmond G. Look A.T. Kidd V.J. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 370-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, the functional consequences of genetic alterations within the Cdc2L locus encoding the PITSLRE kinases in regards to the development of melanoma are not known. Because the PITSLRE p110 isoforms may be involved in apoptosis, we wanted to evaluate the functional consequences of PITSLRE gene alterations with regard to Fas-mediated apoptotic signaling in melanoma cell lines.In the present study, we provide evidence that the melanoma cell lines A375 and UACC 1227 express Fas receptor and that anti-Fas mAb induces apoptosis in A375, but not in UACC 1227 cells. Morphological changes consistent with apoptosis including cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation, and membrane blebbing were observed in the A375 Fas-sensitive cells, but not in the UACC 1227 Fas-resistant cells.We demonstrate that the A375 melanoma cells, which have normal Cdc2L alleles and normal PITSLRE protein expression, are sensitive to Fas-induced apoptosis. In contrast, UACC 1227 cells, which have decreased PITSLRE expression and mutant alleles, do not undergo Fas-induced apoptosis. In addition, an increase in PITSLRE kinase activity was observed in A375 Fas-sensitive cells, but not in the UACC 1227-resistant cell line. Stimulation of PITSLRE kinase activity was also observed in A375 cells following staurosporine treatment. The stimulation of PITSLRE kinase activity was markedly reduced (50â60%) by caspase inhibitors DEV-FMK or IETD during Fas- and staurosporine-mediated cell death. We also report the caspase cleavage of PITSLRE protein and PARP during Fas-induced apoptosis. These observations demonstrate that PITSLRE kinase activation is associated with Fas- and staurosporine-mediated apoptosis in melanoma cells. Furthermore, the data presented here suggest that multiple caspases appear to be involved in the cleavage of PITSLRE during Fas-induced apoptosis in A375 cells. Recently, it has been reported that PITSLRE kinases are specifically cleaved in response to TNF by caspases 1 and 3 resulting in the activation of the PITSLRE kinase, both in vivo and in vitro (27Beyaert R. Kidd V.J. Cornelis S. Van de Craen M. Denecker G. Lahti J.M. Gururajan R. Vandenabeele P. Fiers W. J. Biol.

However, the proteases responsible for the processing and activation of PITSLRE kinases in melanoma and the importance of this processing in apoptosis are unknown. We also demonstrate that caspases 3 and 8 are involved in the Fas signaling pathway in melanoma cells, and caspase 3 is involved in staurosporine-mediated cell death, which is consistent with the published reports on PITSLRE p110 isoforms being cleaved and activated by caspases during apoptosis (27Beyaert R. Kidd V.J. Cornelis S. Van de Craen M. Denecker G. Lahti J.M. Gururajan R. Vandenabeele P. Fiers W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 16601-16607Google Scholar).Finally, in this study we demonstrate that there is a difference in the subcellular localization of p110 PITSLRE isoforms in UACC 1227 melanoma cells relative to normal melanocytes. This result suggests that UACC 1227 cells express PITSLRE proteins that either lack the nuclear translocation signal or that contain a point mutation affecting this region of the protein. The amino-terminal domain also contains several distinct regions that may specify nuclear localization and protein stability (32Bunnell B.A. Heath L.S. Adams D.E. Lahti J. Kidd V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7467-7571Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 33Kidd V.J. Luo W. Xiang J. Easton J. McCune S. Snead M.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 85-93PubMed Google Scholar). Current studies in our laboratory, involving polymerase chain reaction-SSCP and direct DNA sequence analysis, suggest that UACC 1227 cells have a mutation(s) in the nuclear localization signal, which may explain the abnormal cytoplasmic localization of p110 PITSLRE isoforms. Loss or inactivation of the nuclear translocation signal in UACC 1227 cells and consequent cytoplasmic localization of p110 PITSLRE isoforms. In addition, resistance to Fas suggests a functional role of PITSLRE protein kinases in mediating Fas-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, if we consider a role for PITSLRE p110 isoforms in Fas-mediated signal transduction processes, altered distribution of PITSLRE kinases in transformed cells may contribute to the transformed phenotype by deregulating the processes of apoptosis, spliceosome formation, or assembly/disassembly of nuclear speckles, which is involved in the regulation of RNA splicing/transcription (26Loyer P. Lahti J.M. Trembley J.H. Kidd V.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1495-1506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).A question that remains unknown is the identity of the substrate that executes the final death sentence following activation of caspases. One candidate (or family of candidates) is the PITSLRE kinases. PITSLRE kinase proteins have been shown to be processed and activated in cells treated with anti-Fas and TNF (25Lahti J.M. Xiang J. Heath L. Campana D. Kidd V.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 27Beyaert R. Kidd V.J. Cornelis S. Van de Craen M. Denecker G. Lahti J.M. Gururajan R.

Chem. 1999; 274: 16601-16607Google Scholar). Circumstantial evidence suggests that, following the processing and activation of PITSLRE kinases, they may be released from associated restraining molecules to execute the final death sentence. However, this important role for the PITSLRE kinases as final executioners of apoptosis needs to be further investigated. The mechanism that we are proposing to explain the role of PITSLRE protein kinases during apoptosis in malignant melanoma cells is shown in Fig. 9. Activation of Fas receptor by anti-Fas monoclonal antibody results in the aggregation and rapid recruitment of FADD (11Chinnaiyan A.M. Orth K. O'Rourke K. Duan H. Poirier G.G. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4573-4576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). The interaction of FADD and Fas through their carboxyl-terminal death domains unmasks the amino-terminal death effector domain of FADD, allowing it to recruit and activate pro-caspase-8 to the Fas signaling complex (34Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Ni J. Scaffidi C. Bretz J.D. Zhang M. Gentz R. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 85: 817-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (2723) Google Scholar), Caspase 8 activates pro-caspase 3 either directly (pathway 2) or indirectly through cytochrome c release from the mitochondria (pathway 1). Cytochrome c forms a complex with apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (Apaf-1) that binds and activates pro-caspase 9 (35Liu X. Zou H. Slaugher C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar). Activated caspase 9 binds to and activates pro-caspase 3. Our data indicate that PITSLRE kinase activation precedes Fas-induced apoptosis, and it is a downstream event. Because PITSLRE kinases have cleavage sites for caspases 3 and 8 and it has been shown that PITSLRE p110 isoforms are cleaved by these caspases during Fas-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells, we are proposing that PITSLRE kinases get cleaved and activated by caspases 3 and 8 in melanoma cells. Activation of PITSLRE protein kinase results in the phosphorylation and activation of unknown downstream substrates and subsequent transcription of genes involved in the final stages of apoptosis. Staurosporine-induced cell death is also another operational apoptotic pathway present in malignant melanoma cells and is shown in Fig. 9. The fact that staurosporine-induced cell death, which bypasses receptor-mediated signaling, is altered in UACC 1227 cells suggests that PITSLRE kinases are involved in the staurosporine death signaling pathway. Furthermore, these data demonstrate that PITSLRE protein kinases are involved in Fas-, staurosporine-, and DR3-mediated cell death signaling pathways. However, the function of these PITSLRE kinases during apoptosis is not known.Finally, the data presented here suggests that alterations in Cdc2L gene expression and protein localization can result in the loss or deregulation of apoptotic signaling pathway(s). Therefore, altered PITSLRE kinases may represent a different mechanism from that reported for Fas ligand that could contribute to the immune privilege in malignant melanoma (36Hahne M. Rimoldi D. Schroter M. Romero P. Schreier M. French L.E. Schneider P. Bornand T. Fontana A. Lienard D. Cerotini J. Tschopp J. Science. 1996; 274: 1363-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). Deregulation of apoptotic signaling pathways may represent a mechanism to enhance tumorigenesis by preventing the elimination of these cells through normal checkpoint control.

Ferryl intermediates and a tyrosyl radical are formed in the reaction. Linoleate diol synthase was digested with endoproteinase Lys-C, and internal peptides were sequenced. The sequence information was used for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis, and a cDNA probe was obtained. Northern blot analysis of linoleate diol synthase suggested a 3.7-kilobase pair (kb) mRNA. A full-length clone of the linoleate diol synthase gene was obtained by screening of a genomic Î»-ZAP II library of the fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis. The 5â²-untranslated region contained CAAT- and TATA-like boxes. The gene contained three short introns and spanned over 3.2-kb. The deduced open reading frame consisted of 2.9-kb, which corresponded to 978 amino acids and a molecular subunit mass of 108,000. Data base analysis with the gapped BLAST algorithm showed that 391 residues of linoleate diol synthase was 23â24% identical and 36â37% positive with the catalytic domain of mammalian prostaglandin H (PGH) synthase-2. Based on homology with PGH synthases, the proximal heme ligand of linoleate diol synthase was tentatively identified as His-379 and the important tyrosine for catalysis as residue 376 (apparent consensus EFNXXXYXWH). The distal heme ligand was tentatively identified as His-203 (apparent consensus THXXFXT).

Two isozymes, PGH synthase-1 and -2, have been described with 60â65% amino acid identity and with almost identical catalytic properties and tertiary structures (2Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Semin.

PGH synthases catalyze two reactions, viz. the double dioxygenation and cyclization of arachidonic acid into prostaglandin G2 (PGG2), the cyclooxygenase reaction, and the conversion of PGG2 to PGH2, the peroxidase reaction (2Smith W.L.

Linoleate diol synthase also catalyzes two enzymatic reactions, viz. dioxygenation of linoleic acid into (8R)-hydroperoxylinoleate and isomerization of (8R)-hydroperoxylinoleate into (7S,8S)-dihydroxylinoleate (5Brodowsky I.D.

Lipoxygenases can form leukotrienes and other mediators of allergic inflammation (1Funk C.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1304: 65-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit PGH synthases, and this accounts for wanted and unwanted effects of these drugs (2Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Semin.

Less is known about linoleate diol synthase, but it might be important for fungal reproduction and growth as one of its products, (8R)-hydroxylinoleate, has been identified as a sporulation hormone and an antifungal agent (15Champe S.P.

The pharmacological interest in PGH synthases has inspired extensive investigations on their reaction mechanisms, which have now been thoroughly characterized (2Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Semin.

PGH synthases and linoleate diol synthase form different enzymatic products, but their oxygenation mechanisms are similar. The first step of catalysis of both PGH synthases and linoleate diol synthase is stereospecific abstraction of a hydrogen from the substrate (2Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Semin. Nephrol. 1995; 15: 179-194PubMed Google Scholar, 3Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol.

Rev. 1998; 98: 705-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar). The tyrosyl radicals are likely formed after oxidation of the heme iron to a ferryl intermediate (compound I) by PGG2 or (8R)-hydroperoxylinoleate, respectively (8Su C. Sahlin M. Oliw E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20744-20751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 19Karthein R. Dietz R. Nastainczyk W. Ruf H.H. Eur. J.

Tyr-385 of ovine PGH synthase-1 is located at the end of the fatty acid substrate channel about 10 â« from the heme iron (23Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). A series of observations suggests that this and the corresponding tyrosine residue of PGH synthase-2 will form a radical during the cyclooxygenase reaction (2Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Semin. Nephrol. 1995; 15: 179-194PubMed Google Scholar, 3Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol.

Barnett J. Chow J. Ramesha C. Browner M.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 927-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). The position of the tyrosyl radical of linoleate diol synthase remains to be determined. The relaxation properties of the tyrosyl radical suggest that it is also located in the vicinity of the heme group (8Su C. Sahlin M. Oliw E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20744-20751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The second activities of the two enzymes differ. PGH synthases are prominent peroxidases (2Smith W.L.

Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism and Biochemistry. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1995: 49-80Crossref Google Scholar), whereas linoleate diol synthase catalyzes isomerization of (8R)-hydroperoxy C18 fatty acids into 7,8-dihydroxy C18 fatty acids (5Brodowsky I.D. Hamberg M. Oliw E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14738-14745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Su C. Brodowsky I.D. Oliw E.H.

Linoleate diol synthase and PGH synthases thus have two related features in common, viz. formation of a tyrosyl radical and ferryl intermediates. PGH synthases show â¼20% amino acid identity with the mammalian peroxidase gene family (23Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar, 25Marnett L.J. Kennedy T.A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism and Biochemistry. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1995: 49-80Crossref Google Scholar). PGH synthases also appear to have regions of amino acid similarity with two plant proteins (27van der Biezen E.A. Brandwagt B.F. van Leeuwen W. Nijkamp H.J. Hille J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 251: 267-280PubMed Google Scholar, 28Sanz A. Moreno J.I. Castresana C. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1523-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) but lack apparent homology to all previously sequenced dioxygenases. Whether PGH synthases and linoleate diol synthase are homologous proteins has not yet been determined. The aim of the present investigation was to clone and sequence the linoleate diol synthase gene, to determine the deduced primary structure of linoleate diol synthase precursor, and to compare it with PGH synthases and with peroxidases. We report as our main finding that linoleate diol synthase and PGH synthases are structurally related. The similar oxygenation mechanism of PGH synthases and linoleate diol synthase may therefore not be a coincidence. 35S-dATP (1000 Ci/mmol), [Î±-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol), dNTPs, [Î±-33P]ddNTPs, Hybond-N membranes, and DNA labeling beads, T-primed first-strand kit, T7 sequencing, and Thermo Sequenase kits were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. TA cloning kits were from Invitrogen. DNA polymerases for PCR were from Perkin-Elmer (AmpliTaq) and from New England Biolabs (Vent (exoâ)). Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase was from Life Technologies, Inc., and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs. G. graminis was obtained and grown as described (5Brodowsky I.D. Hamberg M. Oliw E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14738-14745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Su C. Oliw E.H. J. Biol.

Primers for PCR were used without further purification and obtained from TIB Molbiol (Berlin, Germany), Life Technologies, Inc., and CyberGene (Huddinge, Sweden). Purified linoleate diol synthase was subject to in situ digestion in the SDS-polyacrylamide gel with Lys-C. Peptides were isolated by narrow bore reverse phase liquid chromatography on the Smart System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and subjected to amino acid sequencing (Perkin-Elmer ABI 494 Sequencer) as described (29Hellman U. Kamp R.M. Choli-Papadopoulu T. Wittmann-Liebold B. Protein Structure Analysis: Preparation, Characterization, and Microsequencing. Springer Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1997: 97-104Crossref Google Scholar). Three peptide sequences (peptide 1, (K)XPTVYPNAPGN; peptide 2, (K)FRPHPNK; and peptide 3, (K)INEGGRFK) were used for synthesis of degenerate oligonucleotide primers (peptide 1, Su20 (5â²-AARAAYCCTACYGTTTAYCCIAAYGC; peptide 2, Su10 (5â²-AARTTYCGTCCTCAYCCTAAYAA and Su11 (5â²-TTGTTTGGRTGWGGTCTRAAYTT; and peptide 3, Su31 (5â²-CTTAAATCKACCACCYTCRTTDAT). Total RNA was prepared using the RNeasy plant kit (Qiagen). â¼5 Î¼g of total RNA was used in a 33-Î¼l reaction mixture for first strand cDNA synthesis (1 h at 37 Â°C). The reaction mixture contained reverse transcriptase buffer with 500 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, 15 mm dithiothreitol, 1.8 mm dNTPs, 2.5 Î¼m oligo(dT)16primer (Perkin-Elmer), and 20 units of RNase inhibitor (Perkin-Elmer). Two Î¼l were used as templates in each PCR. It was later found that these samples were contaminated by genomic DNA. The PCR (50 Î¼l) contained 0.4 Î¼m of each primer, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTPs, and 1.5 units of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase. The PCR protocol was 94 Â°C for 1 min, 1 cycle; 94 Â°C for 30 s, 48 Â°C for 30 s, 72 Â°C for 1 min, 30 cycles, and a final extension step (72 Â°C, 10 min) and then cooled to 8 Â°C. The amplified cDNAs were cloned in the TA vector pCR2.1. Sequencing of both strands was initially performed using dideoxynucleotide sequencing with T7 DNA polymerase but changed to cycle sequencing (Thermo Sequenase and radiolabeled ddNTPs or ABI Prism Big-Dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer)). The genomic library of G. graminis was constructed by partial digestion of genomic DNA with TspeI and ligation into theEcoRI site of Î»-ZAP II (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) as described (30Bowyer P. Clarke B.R. Lunness P. Daniels M.J. Osbourn A.E. Science. 1995; 267: 371-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). A cDNA probe (0.75-kb) was generated by the reverse transcription PCR using primers Su16 (identical with nucleotides 397â421 of the linoleate diol synthase gene) and Su31 and labeled with 32P using the random primer method (31Davis L. Kuehl M. Battey J. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Appleton & Lange, East Norwalk, CT1994: 113-458Google Scholar, 32Eun H.-M. Enzymology Primer for Recombinant DNA Technology. Academic Press, San Diego1996: 647-673Crossref Google Scholar). Control experiments with untranscribed RNA showed that this probe was formed by amplification of genomic DNA. Hybridization screening of the genomic library was performed in QuikHyb (Stratagene) as described (31Davis L. Kuehl M. Battey J. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Appleton & Lange, East Norwalk, CT1994: 113-458Google Scholar). The Bluescript plasmid was rescued from positive phage clones with helper phage as suggested by the manufacturer. Restriction analysis of the Bluescript plasmids was performed by cleavage withEcoRI, HindIII, EcoRV,XbaI, PstI, SalI, and NotI and size fractioning in 0.8â1.5% agarose gels (31Davis L. Kuehl M. Battey J. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Appleton & Lange, East Norwalk, CT1994: 113-458Google Scholar). Fragments generated by HindIII/EcoRI (1.6 kb) andEcoRI (2.8 kb) were subcloned in pCR2.1 for sequencing. Total RNA was size-fractionated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose, 0.22 m formaldehyde gels, transferred to Hybond-N membranes, and hybridized in QuikHyb (Stratagene) with 32P-labeled 0.75-kb linoleate diol synthase cDNA by published methods (31Davis L. Kuehl M. Battey J. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Appleton & Lange, East Norwalk, CT1994: 113-458Google Scholar, 32Eun H.-M. Enzymology Primer for Recombinant DNA Technology.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 12-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) was used for data base search and for pairwise alignments, whereas the Lasergene Megalign program (Dnastar, Madison, WI) was used for multiple alignments. Total amino acid analysis was performed after acidic hydrolysis at the amino acid laboratory of Uppsala University (courtesy Dr. D. Eaker). Purified linoleate diol synthase has an apparent subunit relative molecular mass of â¼130,000 (SDS- polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7Su C. Oliw E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14112-14118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar)). In situ digestion with endoproteinase Lys-C, peptide separation, and amino acid sequencing (29Hellman U. Kamp R.M. Choli-Papadopoulu T. Wittmann-Liebold B. Protein Structure Analysis: Preparation, Characterization, and Microsequencing. Springer Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1997: 97-104Crossref Google Scholar) yielded three useful internal peptide sequences ((K)XPTVYPNAPGN; (K)FRPHPNK; (K)INEGGRFK, where (K) denotes the fact that Lys-C cleaves peptides at the C-terminal side of Lys residues), which were used for design of degenerate oligonucleotide primers. The N terminus appeared to be blocked. Other internal peptide sequences were (K)AVDWGHVTYK, (K)RTLAGTRQSDGAFDD, (K)ARAPI, (K)XLAXMY, (K)VTX GPA, and (K)LHQASK. Some peptide sequences were ambiguous or weak but nevertheless useful for finding the correct reading frame (e.g. LVFF(or Q)NP, NIPD(K)EPEK, PAV(T)F (I)FN(D)TLMVR, (K)XXXXDPATXFAXAXD, (K)XXXIF(Q)DT, (K)HLPEMK, and (K)LPPASREGK). The primers Su20 (sense) and Su11 (antisense) generated a band of 550 base pairs, whereas semi-nested PCR, first round Su20 and Su31, second round Su10 (sense), and Su31 (antisense), yielded a band of 480 base pairs. Primers designed downstream of Su20 and upstream of Su31 generated a cDNA band of the expected size (about 1 kb), which contained the deduced amino acid sequence FRPHPNK (peptide 2) in one of its reading frames. The cDNA probe (0.75 kb) yielded a strong signal at 3.7 kb (data not shown). A weak signal at about 2 kb was also noted at lower stringency in some experiments. About 100,000 plaques were screened with a cDNA probe (0.75 kb), and 8 positive clones were obtained. Positive plaques were subject to three rounds of screening. All rescued Bluescript plasmids seemed to contain inserts of the same size (â¼7 kb). Restriction analysis and sequencing showed that the coding region of linoleate diol synthase started â¼2 kb from the 5â²-end of the insert. The linoleate diol synthase gene with a restriction map is shown in Fig. 1. The 5â²-untranslated region of the linoleate diol synthase gene contained a TATA-like box (at nucleotides â31 to â24, TAATAAAT) and a CAAT-like box (at nucleotides â76 to â72, TCAAT) located upstream of the tentative translation start point (GGCGCCA1TGA). The gene appeared to be divided into 4 exons and 3 short introns (TableI). Short introns are characteristic of filamentous fungi (34Turner G. Borda P. Oliver S.G. Sims P.F.G. The Eukaroytic Genome. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1993: 107-125Google Scholar). The introns were confirmed by sequencing of cDNA. The introns contained a motif similar to the consensus sequence of lariat formation ((C/T)NCT(A/G)A(C/T)) during splicing of RNA of filamentous fungi (34Turner G. Borda P. Oliver S.G. Sims P.F.G. The Eukaroytic Genome. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1993: 107-125Google Scholar). The GC content of the coding region was â¼60%. About 0.8 kb of the 3â²-untranslated region was sequenced, and a polyadenylation signal (AATTAT) (35Edwalds-Gilbert G. Veraldi K.L. Milcarek C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2547-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) appeared to be present 54 base pairs from the stop codon.Table IExon and intron boundaries of the linoleate diol synthase precursorIntronDonorIntron sizeLariatAcceptorbp1AGgttcg â¦85tgctgacâ¦ tagC TTC CGASer-128 Phe Arg2ACGgtatg â¦74tgctaacâ¦ cag TCA CCTThr-209 Ser Pro3AAgtaag â¦74tgctgacâ¦ cagG ATC AACLys-283 Ile Asn Open table in a new tab The predicted amino acid sequence of the linoleate diol synthase precursor is shown in Fig. 2.

The sequence contained five possibleN-glycosylation sites, and the sequence NGNGVY(H,P)T(A) was repeated five consecutive times starting at amino acid residue 862.

Open table in a new tab When the predicted amino acid sequence of linoleate diol synthase was subject to BLAST (33Benson D.A. Boguski M.S. Lipman D.J. Ostell J. Ouellette F.F.F.

They were followed by all other PGH synthases (E values <10â10). An alignment of linoleate diol synthase with horse and rabbit PGH synthase-2 based on BLAST analysis is shown in Fig.3 A. Thus 391 amino acids of linoleate diol synthase were aligned with 367 amino acids of horse and rabbit PGH synthase-2 with 23â24% amino acid identity and 37% positives (data not shown) with a gap frequency of 24%. A partial alignment of the predicted linoleate diol synthase sequence with chick PGH synthase-2, rat PGH synthase-2 and -1, and ovine PGH synthase-1 was performed with the MegAlign program. The sequence similarity appeared to be restricted to the catalytic domain of PGH synthases (23Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar, 24Luong C. Miller A. Barnett J. Chow J. Ramesha C. Browner M.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 927-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), and linoleate diol synthase could be aligned with a similarity index of 25â27%. Both the distal and proximal His heme ligands, the important Tyr residue for catalysis, and Ser, which is acetylated by aspirin, aligned in context with identical amino acids of linoleate diol synthase (data not shown). The similarity of linoleate diol synthase with this set of PGH synthases was most conspicuous (26â54% amino acid identity) along Î±-helices of the catalytic domains as shown in Fig. 3 B. The first region of apparent homology (26% identical) corresponded to the core helix H2 (residues 196â207 of ovine PGH synthase-1, see Ref.23Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar) with the distal His heme ligand (consensus TH XXFXT, where boldface indicates the distal His) at the edge. The second and third regions contained helices H3 and H5 of PGH synthases with 38 and 32% identical residues. Helix H5 is of interest since it harbors the highly conserved decapeptide sequence (consensus TLWLREHNRL) of mammalian peroxidases (25Marnett L.J. Kennedy T.A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism and Biochemistry. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1995: 49-80Crossref Google Scholar). The fourth region contained 54% identical residues and corresponded to core helix H6. The fifth region (33% identical) contained the core helix H8 with the proximal heme ligand and the important Tyr residue (consensus EFNXX Y XWH) of PGH synthases. The sixth region contained helices H11âH16, and linoleate diol synthase was aligned for more than 60 amino acids without gaps, with 35% identical amino acids in helices H15 and H16. A BLAST search of GenBankTM suggested that 70â100 residues of exons 1 and 2 of linoleate diol synthase had sequence similarity with many peroxidases, e.g. human thyroid peroxidase (36Kimura S. Hong Y.S. Kotani T. Ohtaki S. Kikkawa F. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4481-4489Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and the peroxidase precursor of Drosophila melanogaster(37Ng S.W. Wiedemann M. Kontermann R. Petersen G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1171: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This sequence similarity included and ended near the His residue, which is the distal heme ligand of peroxidases. The set of PGH synthases was followed on the BLAST search by three proteins with apparent homology to linoleate diol synthase (E values <6 Ã 10â4), viz. a peroxidase-related protein 2The GenBankTM accession number is Z66520. ofCaenorhabditis elegans, and two closely related plant proteins, the feebly protein of tomato (27van der Biezen E.A. Brandwagt B.F. van Leeuwen W. Nijkamp H.J. Hille J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 251: 267-280PubMed Google Scholar) and the oxygenase ofNicotiana tabacum (28Sanz A. Moreno J.I. Castresana C. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1523-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Their sequence similarities extended over at least 450, 240, and 380 residues of linoleate diol synthase. All sequences appeared to be homologous around the predicted proximal heme ligand of diol synthase. A partial alignment of the peroxidase-like proteins of C. elegans, D. melanogaster, and N. tabacum with the amino acids around the predicted proximal heme ligands of linoleate diol synthase is shown in Fig. 4 A. Some sequence similarity in the region of the distal heme ligand might also be present (cf. Ref. 28Sanz A. Moreno J.I. Castresana C. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1523-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). A phylogenetic tree of linoleate diol synthase, sheep PGH synthase-1, chick PGH synthase-2, and the oxygenase of N. tabacum, is shown in Fig. 4 B. As discussed above, the amino acid identity between linoleate diol synthase and PGH synthases was most apparent in certain Î±-helices of PGH synthases. A schematic drawing of some of these Î±-helices and the position of the heme is shown in Fig. 4 C. We have cloned and sequenced the gene of linoleate diol synthase. We report as our main finding that linoleate diol synthase is homologous to PGH synthases and more distantly related to peroxidases and peroxidase-related proteins. Mature linoleate diol synthase consists of a homotetramer with a relative subunit mass of â¼130,000 as judged from gel filtration and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7Su C. Oliw E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14112-14118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The deduced subunit molecular mass of the linoleate diol synthase precursor was somewhat lower than these estimates (108,000), which might indicate post-translational modifications. Nevertheless, the determined amino acid composition of linoleate diol synthase agreed with the predicted composition (TableII). The tertiary structure of PGH synthases can be divided into three folding units (23Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar), the EGF-like module (residues 34â72 of ovine PGH synthase-1), a membrane-binding motif (residues 73â116), and a globular catalytic domain (residues 117â587). 391 amino acids of the catalytic domain of PGH synthases were found to have significant (23â24%) sequence identity with linoleate diol synthase. The sequence identity increased to an average of 36% (range 25â54%) in selected core Î±-helices, which included the proximal and distal heme ligands and the critical tyrosine residue of PGH synthases. Previous work has shown that linoleate diol synthase is a ferric hemeprotein, which forms a tyrosyl radical and ferryl oxygen intermediates during catalysis (7Su C. Oliw E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14112-14118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 8Su C. Sahlin M. Oliw E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20744-20751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The structural homology and the catalytic similarity between PGH synthases and linoleate diol synthase suggest that His-203 (consensus THXXFXT) could be the distal heme ligand of linoleate diol synthase. His-379 could be the proximal ligand and Tyr-376 an important residue for catalysis (consensus EFNXXYXWH). Additional work including site-directed mutagenesis will be needed to confirm that these His residues indeed are heme ligands and to determine both the position and the catalytic function of the tyrosyl radical of linoleate diol synthase. Tyrosyl radicals can be formed by many enzymes, e.g.ribonucleotide reductase, bovine liver catalase, galactose oxidase, and photosystem II, but only the tyrosyl radical of PGH synthases has been demonstrated to be catalytically competent (22Stubbe J. van der Donk W.A. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 705-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar). The tyrosyl radical is a powerful oxidant with a redox potential of 0.94 V (22Stubbe J. van der Donk W.A. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 705-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar). Indeed, PGH synthases can abstract a hydrogen and introduce molecular oxygen at the monoallylic C-13 of 5,8,11-eicosatrienoic acid in an abortive cyclooxygenase reaction (38Oliw E.H. HoÌrnsten L. Sprecher H. Hamberg M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 39Oliw E.H. HoÌrnsten L. Sprecher H. J. Chromatogr. B. 1997; 690: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), which is in close analogy with the hydrogen abstraction and dioxygenation at C-8 of linoleic acid by linoleate diol synthase (5Brodowsky I.D. Hamberg M. Oliw E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14738-14745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hamberg M. Zhang L.-Y. Brodowsky I.D. Oliw E.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This analogy and the structural homology suggest that the tyrosyl radical of linoleate diol synthase might be catalytically competent. Linoleate diol synthase also appeared to be homologous to a peroxidase-related protein of C. elegans and with two plant proteins and distantly related to various peroxidases. In contrast to the plant proteins, the peroxidase-related protein of C. elegans appears to be homologous with linoleate diol synthase both at the proximal and distal heme ligands. For many proteins of common ancestry, the tertiary structure has been conserved, whereas the amino acid sequence has changed considerably during evolution. The catalytic domains of PGH synthase-1 and canine myeloperoxidase show approximately 20% amino acid identity, yet their tertiary structures have been described as strikingly similar (23Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). Linoleate diol synthase and PGH synthases have a somewhat higher degree of sequence similarity (23â24%). It is therefore possible that the catalytic domain of linoleate diol synthase may fold in a similar fashion to the catalytic domains of canine myeloperoxidase and PGH synthases. In summary, both catalytic and structural features suggest that linoleate diol synthase and PGH synthases may belong to the same gene family, which we propose to designate the fatty acid heme dioxygenase family. Two important catalytic characteristics of proteins of this family appear to be the conserved tyrosine residue close to the heme and the proximal His heme ligand and formation of a tyrosyl radical during catalysis. Further studies on linoleate diol synthase may shed some light on the common catalytic mechanism of the fatty acid heme dioxygenases.

The activation of GS by insulin and glucose was completely reversed by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin. Wortmannin also inhibited insulin-induced phosphorylation and activation of protein kinase B/Akt (PKB/Akt) as well as insulin-induced inactivation of GS kinase-3 (GSK-3), consistent with a role for the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/PKB-Akt/GSK-3 axis in insulin-induced GS activation. Although wortmannin completely inhibited the significantly greater level of GS activation produced by the insulin-mimetic bisperoxovanadium 1,10-phenanthroline (bpV(phen)), there was only minimal accompanying inhibition of bpV(phen)-induced phosphorylation and activation of PKB/Akt, and inactivation of GSK-3. Thus, PKB/Akt activation and GSK-3 inactivation may be necessary but are not sufficient to induce GS activation in rat hepatocytes. Rapamycin partially inhibited the GS activation induced by bpV(phen) but not that effected by insulin. Both insulin- and bpV(phen)-induced activation of the atypical protein kinase C (Î¶/Î») (PKC (Î¶/Î»)) was reversed by wortmannin. Inhibition of PKC (Î¶/Î») with a pseudosubstrate peptide had no effect on GS activation by insulin, but substantially reversed GS activation by bpV(phen). The combination of this inhibitor with rapamycin produced an additive inhibitory effect on bpV(phen)-mediated GS activation.

Whereas there have been numerous studies of GS activation in skeletal muscle, the modulators of GS in liver have been less completely evaluated. Studies to date indicate that glucose and insulin are the major physiologic effectors of hepatic GS activation (1Pugazhenthi S. Khandelwal R.L. Mol. Cell.

It appears that glucose and/or its metabolite glucose 6-phosphate activate hepatic GS by physically associating with critical regulatory enzymes upstream of GS or with GS itself (2Villar-Palasi C.

In the present study, we sought to identify, in primary rat hepatocyte cultures, the molecular components and signal transduction pathways involved in the regulation of GS by both insulin and bpV(phen). Our results demonstrate that neither PKB/Akt activation nor GSK-3 inactivation is sufficient for GS activation and hence raise a question about the role suggested for this pathway in insulin-mediated GS activation. We demonstrate the involvement of two other pathways in the modulation of GS activation, accessed by bpV(phen) but not insulin, a rapamycin-sensitive component that is not p70s6k, and wortmannin-sensitive activation of PKC (Î¶/Î»).DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we evaluated the modulation of GS in primary rat hepatocytes by glucose, insulin, and the insulin-mimetic compound bpV(phen). Previous work demonstrated the allosteric actions of glucose and/or its primary metabolite glucose 6-phosphate on the key enzymes associated with GS activation or with GS itself in liver (2Villar-Palasi C. Guinovart J.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 544-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 4Stalmans W. Bollen M. Mvumbi L. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1987; 3: 127-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The present study showed that a signaling-based mechanism contributes to glucose-mediated GS activation. Thus, as previously observed (6Krause U. Rider M.H. Hue L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16668-16673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), wortmannin partially reversed glucose-induced GS activation (data not shown), implicating PI 3-kinase in glucose signaling to GS. However, glucose did not activate PI 3-kinase activity when assayed in phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates (data not shown). Because the lipid products of PI 3-kinase are potent inhibitors of hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase (51Mithieux G. Daniele N. Payrastre B. Zitoun C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the inhibitory effect of wortmannin may be explained by a reduction in the levels of such lipid products, resulting in augmented glucose-6-phosphatase activity and hence reduced amounts of glucose 6-phosphate available for GS activation. A novel finding was the demonstration that glucose-induced GS activation is sensitive to rapamycin. A role for amino acids in the control of mTOR function has recently been proposed (52Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.-P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). Our data suggest a role for yet another nutrient, glucose, in modulating mTOR function. The rapamycin-sensitive glucose effector(s) remains to be identified, but it does not appear to be p70s6k (Fig. 2) or phosphorylase (Fig. 3).We examined the roles of PI 3-kinase, MAP kinase, and p70s6k in effecting insulin-mediated GS activation in the cultured hepatocyte system. Wortmannin blocked insulin-induced GS activation, indicating a role for PI 3-kinase, as observed previously in various cell lines (38Shepherd P.R. NaveÌ B.T. Siddle K. Biochem.

J. 1996; 320: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, we failed to observe an inhibitory effect of rapamycin on insulin-induced GS activation in rat hepatocytes, consistent with the lack of effect of this inhibitor on insulin-mediated hepatic glycogen synthesis (8Peak M. Rochford J.J. Borthwick A.C. Yeaman S.J. Agius L. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, the stimulation of hepatic GS requires PI 3-kinase but not MAP kinase or p70s6k activation.We sought to define downstream effectors of PI 3-kinase involved in GS activation. GSK-3 is a multisubstrate serine/threonine protein kinase considered to be a major regulator of hepatic GS in vivo(1Pugazhenthi S. Khandelwal R.L. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 149: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), which inhibits GS by phosphorylation (3Lawrence Jr., J.C. Roach P.J. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 541-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, inactivation of GSK-3 should promote GS activation. Insulin has been shown to inactivate GSK-3 in several cell types including hepatocytes (8Peak M. Rochford J.J. Borthwick A.C. Yeaman S.J.

J. 1994; 303: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). We found that insulin induced GSK-3 inactivation and that this was completely reversed by wortmannin. Furthermore, PKB/Akt phosphorylation and activation by insulin was also completely reversed by wortmannin. These findings support the view that the PI 3-kinase/PKB-Akt/GSK-3 axis is involved in effecting insulin-mediated GS activation in hepatocytes as has been inferred in skeletal muscle and adipocytes (61Cross D.A. Watt P.W. Shaw M. van der Kaay J. Downes C.P. Holder J.C. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar).Our studies with bpV(phen) raise reservations about the significance of the above observations for understanding the mechanism of insulin action. Furthermore, since the activation of GS by bpV(phen) was significantly greater than that effected by insulin for the same level of IRK activation (22Band C.J. Posner B.I. Dumas V. Contreres J.-O. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1899-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we anticipated seeing the involvement of processes other than those delineated above. As in the case of insulin, wortmannin entirely reversed bpV(phen)-induced GS activation. This observation effectively excluded a role for MAP kinases, since bpV(phen) strongly activates MAP kinases in the presence of wortmannin (27Band C.J. Posner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 138-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Despite the abrogation of bpV(phen)-induced GS activation by wortmannin, GSK-3 remained markedly inactivated (Fig. 4) and PKB/Akt remained powerfully activated (Fig. 5). Studies by Peak et al. demonstrated that epidermal growth factor antagonizes insulin-induced glycogen synthesis (62Peak M. Agius L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) despite its ability to inactivate GSK-3 and activate, albeit much less markedly, PKB/Akt in primary rat hepatocytes (8Peak M. Rochford J.J. Borthwick A.C. Yeaman S.J. Agius L. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, the entrainment of the sequence involving PKB/Akt and GSK-3 may play a necessary role but is clearly insufficient for GS activation in hepatocytes. The observation that bpV(phen)-induced phosphorylation and activation of PKB/Akt were only minimally affected by wortmannin raises interesting mechanistic considerations. PKB/Akt activation appears to be effected when its pleckstrin homology domain interacts with phospholipid products of PI 3-kinase to induce a conformational change in PKB/Akt, rendering Thr308 and Ser473 accessible for phosphorylation and full activation of the enzyme (15Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Because bpV(phen) is a powerful protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, our results point to a critical role for a protein-tyrosine phosphatase(s) in attenuating PKB/Akt phosphorylation and activation. In light of the recent demonstration that the protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTEN is a lipid phosphatase that dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (63Maehama T. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13375-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2571) Google Scholar, 64Myers M.P. Pass I. Batty I.H. Van Der Kaay J. Stolarov J.P. Hemmings B.A. Wigler M.H. Downes C.P. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13513-13518Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar) and that PKB/Akt activity and phosphorylation are constitutively elevated in PTEN-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (65Stambolic V. Suzuki A. de la Pompa J.L. Brothers G.M. Mirtsos C. Sasaki T. Ruland J. Penniger J.M. Siderovski D.P. Mak T.W. Cell. 1998; 95: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2090) Google Scholar), it is possible that bpV(phen) inhibits PTEN, leading to sustained phosphoinositide 3-phosphate levels and hence PKB/Akt activity. It is also possible that bpV(phen) inhibits a protein-tyrosine phosphatase(s) involved in negatively regulating the activities of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinases 1 and 2, which have been described as the enzymes responsible for phosphorylating PKB/Akt at Thr308 and Ser473, respectively (15Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). In keeping with the current model for PKB/Akt activation (reviewed in Ref. 66Downward J. Science. 1998; 279: 673-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), this would mean that in the presence of wortmannin, sufficient PI 3-kinase lipid products accumulate due to PTEN inhibition so as to induce the conformational change in PKB/Akt necessary for Thr308 and Ser473phosphorylation.We sought to identify the PI 3-kinase-dependent downstream protein kinase(s) that were inactivated by wortmannin and hence could be implicated in modulating GS activation by bpV(phen). PKC (Î¶/Î») is activated in vitro by phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (47Nakanishi H. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and has been shown to lie downstream of PI 3-kinase in rat adipocytes (17Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Karnam P. Bandyopadhyay G. Moscat J. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30075-30082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) and L6 muscle cells (49Bandyopadhyay G. Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Moscat J. Farese R.V. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4721-4731Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Our observation of a reversal by wortmannin of insulin- and bpV(phen)-induced PKC (Î¶/Î») activation in rat hepatocytes is consistent with a role for PI 3-kinase lipid products in PKC (Î¶/Î») activation in hepatocytes. Whereas the addition of the PKC (Î¶/Î») pseudosubstrate inhibitor had no effect on insulin-induced GS activation, it significantly suppressed bpV(phen)-induced GS activation. Thus, PKC (Î¶/Î») is not the downstream kinase activated by insulin. The pseudosubstrate studies implicate the involvement of PKCs in bpV(phen)-induced GS activation. We know that the pseudosubstrate inhibits both typical and atypical PKCs (see Ref. 17Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Karnam P. Bandyopadhyay G. Moscat J. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30075-30082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). However, activation of typical PKCs leads to GS inactivation (1Pugazhenthi S. Khandelwal R.L. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 149: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and their inhibition should hence augment GS activation by bpV(phen). This is clearly not the case, as seen in Fig. 7. Furthermore, since wortmannin fully inhibits bpV(phen)-induced GS activation, it must subsume that portion which is PKC-dependent and hence implicates atypical PKCs (i.e. PKC (Î¶/Î»)) whose activation is inhibited by wortmannin.Since the PKC (Î¶/Î») pseudosubstrate only effected partial inhibition (â¼35%) of bpV(phen)-induced GS activation, we explored the role of other pathways in this process. Unlike the case with insulin, rapamycin significantly reduced the magnitude of bpV(phen)-stimulated GS activity, pointing to the involvement of mTOR-dependent event(s) in bpV(phen) action. Indeed, our data demonstrate that the activation of PKC (Î¶/Î») combined with a rapamycin-sensitive step constitutes most of the stimulation of GS by bpV(phen). Prior in vivo studies implicated a role for phosphorylase inactivation in insulin-mediated hepatic GS activation (40Curnow R.T. Rayfield E.J. George D.T. Zesner T.V. De Ruberstis F. Am. J. Physiol. 1975; 228: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 41van de Werve G. Stalmans W. Hers H.-G. Biochem. J. 1977; 162: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, the confounding effects of circulating glucose levels rendered interpretation difficult. In the present study, we show that, in hepatocytes incubated with insulin, GS was activated, while phosphorylase activity was not significantly diminished. This agrees with earlier studies performed on rat hepatocytes (67Thomas A.P. Martin-Requero A. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5963-5973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 68Miller Jr., T.B. Garnache A. Cruz J. McPherson R.K. Wollenben C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 785-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and indicates that phosphorylase inactivation is unlikely to be involved in the activation of hepatic GS by insulin. In contrast to these findings, we observed that bpV(phen) significantly modulated both phosphorylase phosphatase and phosphorylase and that the changes effected by bpV(phen) were rapamycin-sensitive. Indeed, this might explain the greater ability of bpV(phen) compared with insulin to stimulate GS. How mTOR signals to these enzymes is at present unclear, but p70s6k is not involved, since its activation by insulin and bpV(phen) is both similar in magnitude and sensitive to rapamycin (Ref.27Band C.J. Posner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 138-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar and data not shown). Effectors downstream of mTOR other than p70s6k have been described (69von Manteufell S.R. Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Gingras A.-C. Sonenberg N. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5426-5436Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), and mTOR itself possesses serine kinase activity (70Brunn G.J. Williams J. Sabers C. Wiederrecht G. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5256-5267Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar) such that it may directly regulate phosphorylase phosphatase and/or phosphorylase by phosphorylation.In summary, we have presented data indicating that the activation of PKB/Akt and the inhibition of GSK-3 in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner may be necessary for insulin-induced GS activation but cannot be sufficient. We suggest that an additional pathway needs to be activated to realize the effect of insulin. Our observations with bpV(phen) identified mTOR and PKC (Î¶/Î») as other PI 3-kinase-dependent signaling components that contribute to GS activation in hepatocytes. They do not appear to be the additional postulated component activated by insulin in the course of"

The limited resolution of the S1-decorated actin structure leaves considerable doubt as to which amino acid residues are involved in the actomyosin binding sites, particularly the secondary one. In addition, the S1-decorated F-actin is in a rigor conformation, and it is not known to what extent the monomer crystal structures are relevant for the complex. In fact, adjustments were made to the S1 structure to fit the EM densities (4Rayment I. Holden H.M. Whittaker M. Yohn C.B. Lorentz M. Holmes K.C. Milligan R.A.

Since the IFMs account for approximately one-fifth of the body volume of the adult fly and the ACT88F actin is the major isoform, we believed that it should be possible to isolate pure ACT88F actin. indirect flight muscle heavy meromyosin 4-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis pyrene-labeled rabbit F-actin rabbit skeletal actin myosin subfragment 1 wild-type piconewtons indirect flight muscle heavy meromyosin 4-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis pyrene-labeled rabbit F-actin rabbit skeletal actin myosin subfragment 1 wild-type piconewtons To study actomyosin interactions we have 1) developed a minipurification of ACT88F actin from dissected IFMs that yields sufficient quantities (1â10 Î¼g) for in vitro motility, force/displacement measurements, and some biochemical assays; 2) developed a large scale purification (0.1â1.0 mg) of the ACT88F isoform from a whole fly actin preparation for more detailed stop-flow kinetic studies; and 3) used these approaches with the E93K mutation to investigate whether residue Glu93 is involved in the actomyosin interface and to what extent it affects this binding. Our particular interest in choosing to study this mutant was to examine the proposal for the secondary myosin binding site on actin, for which there is currently little experimental support, and in which residue Glu93 has been identified as having a role. An ry 506 homozygous strain (ry 506 is an allele of therosy eye-color gene) was used to prepare wild-type (WT)Drosophila actins. Whole fly actin preparations lacking the IFM-specific isoform, ACT88F, were made fromry 506 KM88 e s flies (KM88 is an Act88F gene null mutation; Ref. 20Hiromi Y. Hotta Y. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1681-1687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The E93K mutant actin was isolated from thery 506 KM88 e sP[Act88F E93K] transgenic strain, which has a single copy of the E93K mutant Act88F gene inserted into theKM88 strain by P-element-mediated transformation (8Drummond D.R. Hennessey E.S. Sparrow J.C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 226: 70-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Flies were grown on standard Drosophila media. Young adults were collected and stored at â20 Â°C prior to processing. Approximately 5 Î¼g of pure ACT88F actin (co-purified with arthrin, an actin-ubiquitin conjugate; see Ref. 15Ball E.

Cell Motil. 1990; 11: 203-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) of a minimum of 10 flies. Dissected dorso-longitudinal muscles in 0.5 ml of York modified glycerol (20 mm KPO4, 50% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmNaN3, pH 7.0) were spun at 13,000 rpm for 2 min in a benchtop centrifuge. The pellet was extracted in 500 Î¼l of high salt buffer (20 mm KPO4, 800 mm KCl, pH 7.0) at room temperature for 2 min. After centrifuging, the pellet was washed twice with deionized water (1 ml and then 0.5 ml) to remove salt and dehydrated using 50 and then 100% ice-cold acetone, followed by air-drying at room temperature for >15 min. Actin was extracted from the acetone powder with two consecutive 30-Î¼l aliquots of ACEX (2 mm Tris-Cl, 0.2 mmCaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 1 mmdithiothreitol, pH 8.0) for 45 min each. Extracts were combined, and the actin was polymerized by the addition of 6 Î¼l of 10Ã polymerization buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 500 mmKCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP, pH 8.0) for 2 h at room temperature. Solid KCl was added to a final concentration of 800 mm and incubated for 30 min at 37 Â°C to release tropomyosin and troponin contaminants from the F-actin. After spinning at 100,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 Â°C, the F-actin pellets were resuspended in 25 Î¼l of ACEX and labeled with rhodamine-phalloidin (24Kron S.J. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6272-6276Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). The actin purification scheme used for the miniactin preparation from IFMs was scaled up to purify 100-Î¼g to 1-mg quantities of Drosophila ACT88F from thousands of flies. A myofibrillar preparation was made from 50 g of flies (50,000 flies) according to the method of Saide et al. (25Saide J.D. Chin-Bow S. Hogan-Sheldon J. Busquets-Turner L. Vigoreaux J.O.M. Valgiersdottir K. Pardue M.L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2157-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). All centrifugations at this stage were performed at 11,500 rpm for 20 min at 4 Â°C in a Sorvall RC5B centrifuge using a GSA rotor. After a myosin extraction with 200 ml of 20 mmKPO4, 800 mm KCl, pH 7.0, on ice for 10 min, followed by centrifugation, the pellet was quickly washed twice with 600 ml of deionized water and then dehydrated using acetone (see above) but finally air dried overnight at room temperature. Actin extraction from the acetone powder followed essentially the methods of Bullard et al. (26Bullard B. Dabrowska R. Winkelman L. Biochem. J. 1973; 135: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and Pardee and Spudich (27Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1982; 24: 271-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) using two successive volumes of ACEX (see above) for 30 min each at 4 Â°C. After the first extract was spun at 20,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 Â°C, the pellet was re-extracted for 30 min with another aliquot of ACEX, and a one-tenth volume of 10Ã polymerization buffer (see above) was added to the first extract to initiate polymerization. The second extract was treated similarly and combined with the first, and polymerization continued for a further 60 min at 4 Â°C. The contaminating thin filament proteins were removed by adding KCl to 800 mm, incubation at 37 Â°C, and centrifugation (see above). The F-actin was resuspended in ACEX, homogenized, and dialyzed overnight in 3Ã 1-liter changes of ACEX. Optical density atA290âA310, with an extinction coefficient of 0.63 cm2/mg, was used to estimate G-actin molarity. Actin purity was assessed by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE. The ACT88F isoform was purified from the isoform mixture in whole fly actin extracts by anion exchange chromatography. G-actin preparations were clarified by spinning at 90,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 Â°C in a Beckman TLA100.3 rotor and then filtered through a 0.20-Î¼m Millipore filter before loading onto a 1-ml anion exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Mono-Q HR5/5). The column was washed with 20 mm MOPS, pH 6.5, and elution was performed with a 28-min, segmented gradient of 0â500 mm NaCl in 20 mmMOPS pH 6.5 (see Fig. 2). Individual peak fractions were analyzed by one- and also two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (28O'Farrel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad Mini-Protean II gel electrophoresis system. Rabbit skeletal muscle myosin and HMM were prepared using a modification of the method of Margossian and Lowey (29Margossian S.S. Lowey S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 55-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). The HMM concentration was estimated spectrophotometrically withA280 = 0.60 cm2/mg. The stock was drop-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at â80 Â°C. In vitro motility assays were performed according to standard methods (24Kron S.J. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

All assays used the same batch of rabbit HMM and were performed over a 3-day period. Assay buffers (25 mm imidazole-HCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm ATP, pH 7.4) supplemented with KCl (0â50 mm) were degassed before use. In vitro motility assays were performed at 23 Â°C (Â± 0.5 Â°C) and recorded onto video tape. RetracTM software was used to both grab video images every 0.5 s from at least two separate assay slides and track filaments. Only filaments that moved smoothly and continuously for >3 s were tracked for velocity determinations. The single actomyosin cross-bridge mechanical experiments were carried out using an optical tweezers transducer in the âthree-beadâ configuration (33Finer J.F. Simmons R.M. Spudich J.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholar, 34Molloy J.E. Burns J.E. Tregear R.T. Kendrick-Jones J. White D.C.S.

Two independently trapped latex beads, attached to the ends of an actin filament, held the filament close to a glass bead coated with a low surface concentration of rabbit skeletal HMM molecules, allowing interactions between single myosin heads and the actin filament. Beam steering of the traps and calibrations were performed as described previously (34Molloy J.E. Burns J.E. Tregear R.T. Kendrick-Jones J. White D.C.S. Nature. 1995; 378: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 35Veigel C. Bartoo M. White D.C.S. Sparrow J.C. Molloy J.E. Biophys.

Actomyosin interactions were measured at a single trap stiffness of 0.02â0.04 pN nmâ1. The size of the working stroke of rabbit HMM interacting with the different actins was determined by analyzing many displacement events (for details, see Refs. 34Molloy J.E. Burns J.E. Tregear R.T. Kendrick-Jones J. White D.C.S. Nature. 1995; 378: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar and 35Veigel C. Bartoo M. White D.C.S. Sparrow J.C. Molloy J.E. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1424-1438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Histograms of the displacement events could be fitted by a Gaussian distribution whose midpoint shifted from zero, reflected the size of the working stroke, and whose width was determined by the trap stiffness (34Molloy J.E. Burns J.E. Tregear R.T. Kendrick-Jones J. White D.C.S. Nature. 1995; 378: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). The cross-bridge stiffness measurements were made by applying a sinusoidal forcing function (100 Hz) to one bead (Fig. 4 a) (35Veigel C. Bartoo M. White D.C.S. Sparrow J.C. Molloy J.E. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1424-1438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The applied force was calculated from the movement of the driven bead, and the induced extension of the attached cross-bridge was derived from the bead movement of the bead at the other end of the actin filament. Rabbit skeletal F-actin (RSA), pyrene-labeled rabbit F-actin (pyr-RSA), and rabbit myosin subfragment 1 (S1) were prepared, and their molar concentrations were determined as described by Kurzawa and Geeves (37Kurzawa S.E. Geeves M.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1996; 17: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The absorbance of the pyrene label at 280 nm was calculated by multiplying the absorbance at 344 nm by 1.059 (38Criddle A.H. Geeves M.A. Jeffries T. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Phalloidin was used to prevent F-actin from depolymerizing at the low actin concentrations used. Phalloidin-RSA and phalloidin-pyr-RSA stock solutions were made by incubating a 10 Î¼m concentration of the respective F-actins with equimolar concentrations of phalloidin in 20 mm MOPS, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, pH 7.0 (low salt buffer) overnight at 4 Â°C. The fly ACT88F F-actin stock solutions were prepared as follows. Peak B fractions from the anion exchange chromatography runs were collected in 10Ã polymerization buffer. Excess phalloidin was added to the pooled fractions, and actins were polymerized overnight at 4 Â°C. F-actin was pelleted at 100,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 Â°C in a Beckman TLA 100.4 rotor. The pellet was washed and resuspended in the low salt buffer to a concentration of about 10 Î¼m. Stop-flow measurements were performed at 20 Â°C as described by Kurzawa and Geeves (37Kurzawa S.E. Geeves M.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1996; 17: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) using a Hi-Tech Scientific SF-61MX stop-flow spectrophotometer in fluorescence mode. Transients shown are the average of 5â10 consecutive shots of the stop-flow machine, and the concentrations after mixing are quoted, since these are the relevant ones for kinetic analysis of the exponential curves. In the secondary plot, the concentrations present before mixing in the stop-flow are plotted, since these are the relevant concentrations to assay the fraction of actin bound to S1 at equilibrium. The experimental buffer was 20 mm MOPS, 5 mm MgCl2, 10â100 mm KCl, pH 7.0. The minipreparation of the ACT88F isoform depends upon IFM dissection, since the Act88F actin gene is the only actin gene expressed in the IFMs (14Fyrberg E.A. Mahaffey J.W. Bond B.J. Davidson N. Cell. 1983; 33: 115-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 15Ball E. Karlik C.C. Beall C.J. Saville D. Sparrow J.C. Bullard B. Fyrberg E.A.

Cell. 1980; 19: 365-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The preparation allows rapid purification of small amounts (â¼5 Î¼g) of pure ACT88F actin (Fig. 1), sufficient for in vitro motility/force measurements ofAct88F mutants. However, these preparations contain arthrin, a stable post-translationally ubiquitinated form of ACT88F (15Ball E. Karlik C.C. Beall C.J. Saville D. Sparrow J.C. Bullard B. Fyrberg E.A. Cell. 1987; 51: 221-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). No differences in polymerization, activation of myosin ATPase, or myosin binding have been found between actin and arthrin from eitherLethocerus (39Bullard B. Bell J. Craig R. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 182: 443-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) orDrosophila. 2S. Schmitz, A. Razzaq, M. A. Geeves, and J. C. Sparrow, unpublished observations. The calculated isoelectric points of the isoforms from the six Drosophilaactin genes fall into three charge groups: 1) ACT57B at 5.23; 2) ACT42A, ACT79B, ACT87E, and ACT88F at 5.30; and 3) ACT5C at 5.37. In the sequences used for these calculations, the first two N-terminal amino acids, methionine and cysteine, were removed, since it is a common feature of class II actins (40Rubenstein P.A. BioEssays. 1990; 12: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), but no other post-translational changes were considered. Separation of the actin isoforms from WT flies on two-dimensional gels produces four actin spots (see Fig.2 a). The largest and most basic isoform, arthrin, is a stable conjugate of ACT88F actin and ubiquitin (15Ball E. Karlik C.C. Beall C.J. Saville D. Sparrow J.C. Bullard B. Fyrberg E.A. Cell. 1987; 51: 221-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The three main actin spots are labeled IâIII in order of increasing basicity (41Lang A.B. Wyss C. Eppenberger H.M. Nature. 1981; 291 (506): 506Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and might be expected to correspond to the three charge groups above. When the Act88F gene is transcribed and translated in vitro under conditions allowing complete N-terminal processing, including acetylation, ACT88F runs, as predicted, at spot II (42Hennessey E.S. Drummond D.R. Sparrow J.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, the most basic actin, labeled III, on two-dimensional gels of the whole fly actin extract is the mature ACT88F isoform (43Mahaffey J.W. Coutu M.D. Fyrberg E.A. Inwood W. Cell. 1985; 40: 101-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), which we refer to as ACT88F-III. This difference relates to the finding that most of the ACT88F undergoes an unknown in vivo post-translational modification under the control of the mod gene (43Mahaffey J.W. Coutu M.D. Fyrberg E.A. Inwood W. Cell. 1985; 40: 101-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) to gain a more basic charge. The basic charge of ACT88F predicts that as a major adult fly actin it is separable from the other isoforms. The whole fly actin preparations were relatively pure, each containing a major actin band (by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE, not shown) and a band corresponding to arthrin. The major band includes the different isoforms found in adult flies, including nonmuscle actins. Anion exchange chromatography resolved the actins into four separate peaks, labeled AâD according to their elution order from the column (see Fig.2 b). Peak A is the first and most basic actin fraction; peak D is the last and most acidic. The four discrete peaks match the two-dimensional separation of the mixed actins into arthrin and three actin spots (IIIâI). The identity of peak A as pure arthrin was confirmed by its mass in one-dimensional PAGE (data not shown). To prove that the actin in peaks B and C represented one or more isoforms of a particular pI, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of different combinations of peak fractions was performed (data not shown). The two nonoverlapping spots found upon mixing of peak B and C samples confirmed that each peak contained one or more actin isoforms of a particular charge, coincident with the expectation that these represent actin spots III and II, respectively. Since ACT88F is the major adult actin and runs as spot III (14Fyrberg E.A. Mahaffey J.W. Bond B.J. Davidson N. Cell. 1983; 33: 115-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 43Mahaffey J.W. Coutu M.D. Fyrberg E.A. Inwood W. Cell. 1985; 40: 101-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), this is likely to be the major component of peak B. To confirm this anion exchange separations of actin extracts from two Act88Fmutants were performed. First, the separation was used on actin preparations from KM88 strain flies that lack any ACT88F because KM88 has a nonsense (stop) mutation in codon 79 of its Act88F gene (20Hiromi Y. Hotta Y. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1681-1687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anion exchange chromatography of theKM88 actin extract generated three actin peaks (Fig.2 c). These were depicted as Bi, C and D since they eluted at positions corresponding to peaks B, C and D in a WT chromatogram (Fig.2 b). As expected no peak eluted at the position corresponding to the arthrin peak A. Whereas the relative magnitudes of peaks C and D in the KM88 profile were similar to the corresponding peaks in a WT chromatogram, peak Bi is very much smaller than WT peak B. It can therefore be argued that peak B constitutes ACT88F-III in a WT profile. Peak Bi must be another isoform, and the calculated isoelectric points (see above) suggest that it is most likely ACT5C, a cytoplasmic isoform. Since peak Bi in a WT profile will be obscured by co-elution with the ACT88F-III isoform, the WT peak B fractions are only greater than 90% pure ACT88F-III. Second, due to the amino acid substitution, ACT88F-E93K is more basic than the other isoforms, and peaks A and B from the ACT88F-E93K strain should elute earlier than the corresponding WT peaks. As expected, four major peaks eluted (Fig. 2 d), with peaks A and B eluting earlier than the corresponding WT peaks, confirming that peak B is the ACT88F-III actin; the positions and magnitudes of peaks C and D were unaltered. The premature peak B had a similar amplitude to its WT counterpart. Two additional minor actin peaks were distinguishable between peaks B and C, labeled Bi and Bii (Fig. 2 d). The earlier elution of peak B in the E93K chromatogram uncovered the same small Bi actin peak seen in the KM88 chromatogram (Fig.2 c). Peak Bii is assumed to be the E93K-ACT88F-II fraction (ACT88F actin unchanged by the mod gene product; Ref. 43Mahaffey J.W. Coutu M.D. Fyrberg E.A. Inwood W. Cell. 1985; 40: 101-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), which would also elute earlier than its WT counterpart due to increased basicity. From calculated isoelectric points, peak C (spot II on a two-dimensional gel) is probably a mixture of ACT79B, ACT88F-II, ACT87E, and ACT42A. Peak D is probably the ACT57A isoform (spot I). Approximately 30% of extracted fly actin is the ACT88F-III isoform. A single column run produces 250 Î¼g of ACT88F-III isoform in a 1â2-ml volume. However, significant amounts a"
https://openalex.org/W1982378715,"Transcription of the L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene is induced by glucose in the presence of insulin and repressed by glucagon via cyclic AMP. The DNA regulatory sequence responsible for mediating glucose and cyclic AMP responses, called glucose response element (GlRE), consists of two degenerated E boxes spaced by 5 base pairs and is able to bind basic helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper proteins, in particular the upstream stimulatory factors (USFs). From ex vivo and in vivo experiments, it appears that USFs are required for correct response of the L-PK gene to glucose, but their expression and binding activity are not known to be regulated by glucose. A genetic screen in yeast has allowed us to identify a novel transcriptional factor binding to the GlRE, i.e. the chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor II (COUP-TFII). Binding of COUP-TFII to the GlRE was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and COUP-TFII-containing complexes were detectable in liver nuclear extracts. Neither abundance nor binding activity of COUP-TFII appeared to be significantly regulated by diets. In footprinting experiments, two COUP-TFII-binding sites overlapping the E boxes were detected. Overexpression of COUP-TFII abrogated the USF-dependent transactivation of an artificial GlRE-dependent promoter in COS cells and the glucose responsiveness of the L-PK promoter in hepatocytes in primary culture. In addition, a mutated GlRE with increased affinity for USF and very low affinity for COUP-TFII conferred a dramatically decreased glucose responsiveness on the L-PK promoter in hepatocytes in primary culture by increasing activity of the reporter gene in low glucose condition. We propose that COUP-TFII could be a negative regulatory component of the glucose sensor complex assembled on the GlRE of the L-PK gene and most likely of other glucose-responsive genes as well.

Doiron et al. (7Doiron B. Cuif M.-H. Chen R. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5321-5324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) suggested that glucose is metabolized into active intermediates that in turn activate specific transcriptional factors that enhance the L-PK gene promoter. We defined a sequence responsible for mediating the positive response to glucose and the negative responses to cAMP in the proximal L-PK promoter from the position â172 to â142 bp, ex vivo by transient expression assays in hepatocytes in primary culture and in vivo in transgenic mice (8Bergot M.

This DNA-binding site was termed the glucose response element (GlRE). This GlRE is closely related to the carbohydrate response element (ChoRE) described by Towle's group (12Shih H.-M. Liu Z. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21991-21997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) in the regulatory region of the S14 gene and also to the glucose response element recently identified upstream of the glucagon receptor gene (13Portois L. Maget B. Tastenoy M. Perret J. Svoboda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8181-8190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the context of the wild-type L-PK promoter, the complex that binds to this element cooperates with an adjacent DNA-binding site, the auxiliary site L3 (8Bergot M. Diaz-Guerra M. Puzenat N. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1871-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 10Diaz Guerra M.-J.M. Bergot M. Martinez A. Cuif M. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7725-7733Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), to confer a strong glucose responsiveness. This auxiliary site has been shown to bind mainly hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) in the liver but has also some affinity for chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TF) (10Diaz Guerra M.-J.M. Bergot M. Martinez A. Cuif M. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7725-7733Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 14Liu Z. Towle H.C. Biochem.

However, our group and Towle's group showed that a GlRE multimer is sufficient to confer both carbohydrates and cAMP responses in the absence of the auxiliary site (8Bergot M. Diaz-Guerra M. Puzenat N. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1871-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 10Diaz Guerra M.-J.M. Bergot M. Martinez A. Cuif M. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7725-7733Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The GlRE consists of two palindromic noncanonical E boxes (CANNTG) separated by 5 bp (12Shih H.-M. Liu Z. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21991-21997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The full activity of the L-PK GlRE seems to require the cooperation between these two E boxes (8Bergot M. Diaz-Guerra M. Puzenat N. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1871-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 10Diaz Guerra M.-J.M. Bergot M. Martinez A. Cuif M. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7725-7733Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We have found that these E boxes are able to bind the upstream stimulatory factors (USFs), which are members of the basic helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper family (10Diaz Guerra M.-J.M. Bergot M. Martinez A. Cuif M. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7725-7733Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 16Vaulont S. Puzenat N. Levrat F. Cognet M. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In vivo footprinting on the â183-PK promoter suggested that both E boxes are occupied in the liver (17Miquerol L. Cluzeaud F. Porteu A. Alexandre Y. Vandewalle A. Kahn A. Gene Expr. 1996; 5: 315-330PubMed Google Scholar).In vitro experiments showed that, in the liver as well as in most cells and tissues tested (18Viollet B. LefrancÌ§ois-Martinez A.-M. Henrion A. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Martinez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1405-1415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), USF binding activity is mainly accounted for by the USF1/USF2 heterodimer. By different approaches in cell culture and in vivo, we have shown that USF was implicated in the response of the L-PK gene to glucose (8Bergot M. Diaz-Guerra M. Puzenat N. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1871-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 9Cuif M.H. Cognet M. Boquet D. Tremp G. Kahn A. Vaulont S. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1995; 270: 2640-2643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Accordingly, response of the L-PK, S14, and fatty acid synthase genes to dietary glucose is abnormal in USF2-defective knock-out mice (20Vallet V.S. Henrion A.A. Bucchini D. Casado M. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Vaulont S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21944-21949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar,21Casado M. Vallet V.S. Kahn A. Vaulont S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2009-2013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In USF1â/â knock-out mice, only dietary response of the fatty acid synthase gene was impaired, whereas that of the L-PK and S14 genes was normal (21Casado M. Vallet V.S. Kahn A. Vaulont S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2009-2013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 22Vallet V.S. Casado M. Henrion A.A. Bucchini D. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Vaulont S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20175-20179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, USFs alone cannot account for the transcriptional response to glucose because most genes whose promoters include USF-binding E boxes are not regulated by glucose (23Henrion A. Vaulont S. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition, the glucose responsiveness conferred by GlREs/ChoREs is clearly not parallel to their affinity for USFs (24Kaytor E.N. Shih H. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7525-7531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Finally, gel shift assays with the L-PK GlRE as probe can detect, under some conditions, other binding proteins than USFs (Refs. 15Yamada K. Tanaka T. Noguchi T. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 917-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar and 25Hasegawa J. Osatomi K. Wu R.-F. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 271: 1100-1107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (47) Google Scholar and this paper). We therefore undertook research of novel partners of the glucose response complex interacting with the L-PK GlRE. Using a one-hybrid system in yeast with the GlRE as the target sequence, we cloned the COUP-TFII orphan nuclear receptor (also referred to as ARP-1) (26Malik S. Karathanasis S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1536-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). COUP-TF is a member of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor (TR) superfamily and was first identified as a homodimer that binds to a direct repeat regulatory element (DR1) in the chicken ovalbumin gene promoter (27Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Indeed, COUP-TFII is able to bind to the GlRE in vitro, and COUP-TF-containing complexes interacting with the GlRE are detected in liver nuclear extracts. DNA binding activities of these complexes do not seem to be modulated by diets. COUP-TF- and USF-binding sites are overlapping, and consequently binding of these factors mutually interferes one on the other. Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of COUP-TFII not only inhibits USF-dependent transactivation of the L-PK promoter but also represses its stimulation by glucose in hepatocytes. Furthermore, a mutant GlRE with very low affinity for COUP-TFII conferred an impaired glucose response, because of increased activity under low glucose conditions. We propose that the glucose responsiveness mediated by the GlRE could involve a complex interaction between USF transactivators and COUP-TFII, probably in association with other, as yet not characterized partners. COUP-TFII-containing dimers could be involved in a glucose sensor system abrogating transactivation by USFs in the absence of glucose. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain used in this study was the CD156 strain (MATa, ade2, his3, leu2, lys2, trp1, ura3, gal4, gal80, cbf1Î). The CYC1-HIS3 gene fusion used for the one-hybrid screen was as described in Blaiseau et al. (28Blaiseau P.L. Isnard A.D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Thomas D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3640-3648Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Wild-type GlRE motifs of the L-PK gene was cloned as two oriented copies, 200 bp upstream of the TATA box owing to the unique cloning site XhoI. The resulting plasmid was linearized with StuI (within theURA3 marker) and used to transform the CD156 strain. Stable uracil prototroph transformants were selected, and correct integration events were verified by Southern blot analysis. About 109 cells of strain YMV1 (cbf1::hisg, ura3::GlRE-HIS3::URA3) were transformed with 90 Î¼g of the cDNA fusion library (kindly provided by Dr. A. Vojtek) (29Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar) in the presence of 300 Î¼g of salmon sperm carrier DNA according to Bartel and Fields (30Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 254: 241-263Crossref Scopus (302) Google Scholar). After transformation, the cells were recovered for 1 h in complete yeast medium and plated, and histidine prototroph, aminotriazole (AT, 30 mm)-resistant transformants were selected. From a screen of about 2 Ã 106 transformants, 60 AT-resistant clones were selected after 3â10 days at 30 Â°C. The corresponding plasmids were recovered and then tested for specificity by transforming yeast cells containing either the GlRE-HIS3 or the unrelated MEF3-HIS3gene construct integrated in the genome. From this second round of selection, only one plasmid was shown to result in the specific activation of the GlRE-HIS3 reporter gene. The cDNA insert contained within this plasmid was sequenced using the Sanger dideoxy termination method adapted to the automated sequencer 373A from Applied Biosystems. All plasmids were constructed by using standard DNA cloning procedures. The constructs were verified by nucleotide sequencing. (LL)2-54PK/CAT and (MM)2-54PK/CAT constructs comprise two oriented copies of the L-PK GlRE (also called LL and L4 boxes) (8Bergot M. Diaz-Guerra M. Puzenat N. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1871-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 10Diaz Guerra M.-J.M. Bergot M. Martinez A. Cuif M. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7725-7733Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) or MM (10Diaz Guerra M.-J.M. Bergot M. Martinez A. Cuif M. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7725-7733Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) ligated to the â54 to +11 proximal base pairs of the L-PK minimal promoter (31Cognet M. Bergot M.O. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7368-7375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). L-PK firefly luciferase (Luc) constructs are novel. Restriction or oligonucleotidic fragments of the L-PK gene corresponding to the regions â54, â96, or â183 to +11 nucleotides with respect to the transcriptional start were subcloned into the basic plasmid pGL3 (Promega). (LL)3-96PK/Luc, (MM)3-96PK/Luc, (L3)3-54PK/Luc, and (LL)3-54PK/Luc plasmids consist of three oriented tandem repeats of L-PK GlRE motif inserted in front of the â96 PK/Luc or â54 PK/Luc constructs, respectively. To correct for variations because of the transfection procedure and cell types, we cotransfected each test plasmid with a RSV/Rluc vector. This vector contains a cDNA encoding Renilla luciferase gene (pRL-null/Promega) driven by the RSV promoter. For cell transfection experiments, we used the human COUP-TFII cDNA cloned into an eukaryotic expression vector, pMT2, driven by the adenovirus major late promoter and the simian virus 40 enhancer region (kindly provided by Dr. S. Karathanasis). Human USF2a was cloned into an eukaryotic expression vector, pCR3, driven by the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter region (18Viollet B. LefrancÌ§ois-Martinez A.-M. Henrion A. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Martinez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1405-1415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The USF2 gene gives rise predominantly to full-length USF2a subunits, associated with two minor forms, USF2b (resulting from an alternative splicing out of an exon in the NH2 domain) and mini-USF2, a NH2 truncated form. COUP-TFII used for in vitro transcription/translation was obtained by inserting the COUP-TFII EcoRI cDNA fragment into the pCR3 vector. The recombinant rat COUP-TFII expression vector pGEX-KG-COUP-TFII was a gift from J.-M. Boutin. TheNcoI-XhoI fragment, containing the entire coding frame, was inserted in the same sites in the pGEX-KG vector (32Chu K. Boutin J.M. Breton C. Zingg H.H. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 137: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). All plasmids were purified with a Qiagen kit. Three-month-old Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to different previously described nutritional and hormonal treatments to study L-PK expression in the rat liver (1Vaulont S. Munnich A. Decaux J.F. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7621-7635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Animals were fasted for 48 h and then separated into three groups and refed for 24 h with different diets: high carbohydrate for the first group, high protein for the second group, and high fat for the third group. As previously demonstrated, we observed that the endogenous L-PK mRNA was abundant in the animals of the first group and scarcely detectable in the animals of the other two groups (data not shown). Other rats were fed with a regular chow ad libitum. The plasmids pCR3/COUP-TFII and pCR3/USF2a were linearized with NotI andXbaI, respectively, and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of m7G(5â²)ppp(5â²)G (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The resulting mRNAs were translated in vitro with rabbit reticulocyte lysate according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). GST-COUP-TFII protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL-21 (DE3). Overnight cultures of bacteria that were newly transformed with the plasmid pGEX-KG-COUP-TFII were diluted with 10 volumes of medium, cultured for several hours to an optical density of 0.6 at 600 nm, and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-Î²-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 37 Â°C for 3 h. Bacteria from 500 ml of culture were harvested and resuspended in 10 ml of NTEN [(20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 Î¼g of leupeptin/ml, 10 Î¼g of pepstatin/ml, 10 Î¼g of aprotinin/ml, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were sonicated, and after centrifugation, the supernatants were mixed with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (500 Î¼l, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 Â°C for 30 min in NTEN buffer. After two washes with TG buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10% glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol), the GST-COUP-TFII was eluted with the TG buffer containing 30 mm glutathione. USF2a protein was expressed in E. coli tagged with histidine residues at its N terminus, allowing purification over Ni2+ affinity resin as described (18Viollet B. LefrancÌ§ois-Martinez A.-M. Henrion A. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Martinez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1405-1415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts for EMSA were prepared at a concentration of about 10 mg/ml. Different methods of nuclear extract preparation were tested. Results present nuclear extract preparation according to the procedure described in Hasegawa et al. (25Hasegawa J. Osatomi K. Wu R.-F. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 271: 1100-1107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (47) Google Scholar) in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors, as described in Ref. 33Viollet B. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4208-4219Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar. EMSA were performed at room temperature with 1 ng of double-stranded oligonucleotides as probes, end-labeled and blunt-ended using Klenow enzyme with the appropriate radionucleotide or labeled in the presence of [Î³-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase. Incubation reactions were done on ice in the presence of 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 Î¼g of poly(dI-dC) (100 ng for recombinant proteins), and either 5 Î¼g of liver nuclear extracts or 1â4 Î¼l of reticulocyte lysate extracts and recombinant proteins. In Fig. 5 B, the reaction buffer used was 20 mmHepes/KOH, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% (v/v) glycerol as reported by Hasegawa et al. (25Hasegawa J. Osatomi K. Wu R.-F. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 271: 1100-1107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For competition assays, 10â50 ng of different oligonucleotides were used as specific competitors, and 50 ng of MEF3 oligonucleotide was used as an unrelated competitor. For antibody supershift analysis, 0.5â1 Î¼l of the antiserum were included in the binding reactions. Each reaction mixture was then electrophoresed in a native 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel in 0.25 Ã Tris-borate-EDTA (or 5% in the case of the in vitro translated product and recombinant proteins experiments or 4.5% in Fig. 5 B). Gels were prerun for 30 min and run for 3â4 h at 140 V. The sequences of L-PK/GlRE (L4 or LL), MM, L-PK/L3, Sp1, DR1, MLP, NF-Y, and MEF3 oligonucleotides were as follows: GlRE L-PK site (bp â172 to â142) TGGGCGCCACGGGGCACTCCCGTGGTTCCTG; MM site (bp â172 to â142) TGGGCGCCACGTGGCACTCACGTGGTTCCTG; L3 L-PK site (bp â150 to â121) TGGTTCCTGGACTCTGGCCCCCAGTGTACA; Sp1 site (from Santa Cruz) ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC; DR1 site GGCGGGCCCAGGTCAGAGGTCATTAGA; USF MLP adenovirus 2 site (bp â70 to â43) AGGTGTAGGCCACGTGACCGGGTGTTCC; NF-Y rat albumin (bp â93 to â65) GGGGTAGGAACCAATGAAATGAAAGGTTA; and MEF3 myogenin (bp â87 to â63) GAGGGGGGCTCAGGTTTCTGTGGCG. Anti-COUP-TFII antibody, used to characterize the retarded complexes in supershift or Western blotting experiments, was provided by Dr. S. Karathanasis. RXRÎ± and TRÎ± antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz. Anti-USFs (USF1 and LZ2) antibodies were produced in our laboratory (18Viollet B. LefrancÌ§ois-Martinez A.-M. Henrion A. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Martinez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1405-1415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). A 100-bpXbaI-NheI rat L-PK 5â²-flanking region (â196 to â96 containing the GlRE) was used for DNase I footprinting analysis. The labeled fragment was obtained by digestion of the â183-PK/CAT plasmid by NheI (coding strand) or by XbaI (noncoding strand), followed by filling in with Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase in the presence of [32P[dCTP and [32P]dTTP and then digested with XbaI orNheI. The DNase I footprinting was performed with a footprinting kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Before digestion with 0.1 unit of DNase I, the labeled fragments were incubated with various amounts of COUP-TFII recombinant protein (10, 25, and 50 ng). The DNA fragments were analyzed on a 7.5% (w/v) denaturing polyacrylamide sequencing gel. The chemical reaction for G+A on the same fragments were included as markers. The eluted GST-COUP-TFII recombinant protein (100 ng) or liver nuclear or whole COS-7 cell extracts (20 Î¼g) were separated by 10â12% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes in a Bio-Rad apparatus according to the manufacturer's instructions. After blocking of nonspecific protein-binding sites for 1 h at room temperature in TBST (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20) containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, the blots were incubated with the primary hCOUP-TF antibody at a 1:500 dilution (a generous gift from Dr. S. Karathanasis) or with primary affinity-purified hUSF2 (LZ2) at a 1:500 dilution and (18Viollet B. LefrancÌ§ois-Martinez A.-M. Henrion A. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Martinez A. J. Biol.

Following three washes of 20 min each in TBST, the secondary antibody, peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit (Dako), was added at a 1:4000 dilution and left for 45 min at room temperature. The blots were washed again, and peroxidase activity was detected by autoradiography with ECL enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To ensure comparable loading of the samples, blots performed with nuclear and whole cell extracts were incubated with anti-annexin V antibody at a 1:1000 dilution. COS-7 were plated at 70% of confluence on 6-cm-diameter dish and cultured at 37 Â°C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum and antibiotics. COS-7 cells were transfected 15 h after plating by the lipofection method, using theN-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were transfected with a total amount of 6 Î¼g of plasmid DNA divided into 2 Î¼g of reporter constructs, various amounts of expression vector, 0.2 Î¼g of the pRSV-luciferase plasmid as an internal transfection control (34De Wet J.R. Wood K.V. De Luca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2478) Google Scholar), and pKSBluescript as a carrier to keep constant total amount of DNA.

Neutrophils do not contain LTC4 synthase but are known to cooperate with endothelial cells or platelets (which do have this enzyme) to generate cys-LTs. Stimulation of human neutrophils perfusing isolated rabbit hearts resulted in production of cys-LTs, whereas these were not seen with perfused hearts alone or isolated neutrophils. In addition, the stimulated, neutrophil-perfused hearts generated much greater amounts of total LTA4 products, suggesting that the hearts were supplying arachidonate to the neutrophils and, in addition, that this externally derived arachidonate was preferentially used for exported LTA4 that could be metabolized to cys-LTs by the coronary endothelium. Stable isotope-labeled arachidonate and electrospray tandem mass spectrometry were used to differentially follow metabolism of exogenous and endogenous arachidonate. Isolated, adherent neutrophils at low concentrations (to minimize transcellular metabolism between them) were shown to generate higher proportions of nonenzymatic LTA4products from exogenous arachidonate (deuterium-labeled) than from endogenous (unlabeled) sources. The endogenous arachidonate, on the other hand, was preferentially used for conversion to LTB4by the LTA4 hydrolase. This result was not because of saturation of the LTA4 hydrolase, because it occurred at widely differing concentrations of exogenous arachidonate. Finally, in the presence of platelets (which contain LTC4 synthase), the LTA4 synthesized from exogenous deuterium-labeled arachidonate was converted to cys-LTs to a greater degree than that from endogenous sources. These experiments suggest that exogenous arachidonate is preferentially converted to LTA4 for export (not intracellular conversion) and raises the likelihood that there are different intracellular pathways for arachidonate metabolism.

The importance of the leukotriene pathway in general is demonstrated by the significantly limited inflammatory response to specific stimuli seen in mice with a targeted disruption of the 5-lipoxygenase gene (9Chen X.S. Zhang Y.Y. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31237-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Neutrophils also express cytosolic phospholipase A2, which specifically releases arachidonic acid from glycerophosphocholine lipids for eicosanoid generation (10Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16709-16712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar), and targeted disruption of this gene also reduces inflammation (11Bonventre J.V. Huang Z. Taheri M.R. O'Leary E. Li E. Moskowitz M.A. Sapirstein A. Nature. 1997; 390: 622-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). However, the processes involved have, for the most part, been studied within a uniform cell population; in whole tissues eicosanoid biosynthesis, and specifically leukotriene biosynthesis, is much more complex resulting from the intricate interplay between different cells, cellular events, and enzymatic reactions. For example, contact between cooperating cells can lead to the multidirectional transfer of arachidonate or reactive intermediates of this fatty acid such as LTA4.Adhesion of neutrophils to vascular endothelial cells is a characteristic feature of inflammation involving numerous adhesion proteins that regulate their transmigration across the vascular endothelial barrier (12Carlos T.M. Harlan J.M. Blood. 1994; 84: 2068-2101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The microenvironment at the interface between adherent neutrophils and endothelial cells is suggested to represent a strategic site for exchange, transcellular synthesis, and metabolism of lipid mediators. Neutrophils by themselves do not synthesize cys-LT but, in cooperation with endothelial cells (or platelets), lead to the production of these mediators by the exchange of newly synthesized LTA4 to the endothelial cell or platelet that contains constitutively active leukotriene synthase (13Feinmark S.J.

Chem. 1988; 263: 174-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This cooperative formation of cys-LT has been shown to cause coronary vasoconstriction and severe inflammatory changes in the rabbit heart (15Sala A. Rossoni G. Buccellati C. Berti F. Folco G.

Blood. 1996; 87: 1824-1832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, pharmacological manipulations aimed at altering the neutrophil-endothelial cell adhesion process, such as the application of nitric oxide and prostacyclin, have also been shown to reduce not only the cys-LT production but also, secondarily, to alter coronary vascular reactivity and cardiac function (17Rossoni G. Sala A. Berti F. Testa T. Buccellati C. Molta C. Muller-Peddinghaus R. Maclouf J. Folco G.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 335-341PubMed Google Scholar, 18Buccellati C. Rossoni G. Bonazzi A. Berti F. Maclouf J. Folco G. Sala A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 1128-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).Previous studies from our group have suggested that the transcellular biosynthesis process is even more complicated and may often involve an additional exogenous supply of arachidonate from the platelet or endothelial cell, which is taken up by the neutrophil for conversion to the LTA4, that is then handed back to the donor cell for final conversion to cys-LT (19Antoine C. Murphy R.C. Henson P.M. Maclouf J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1128: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the biochemistry of this neutrophil-endothelial cell interaction for generation of bioactive leukotrienes within the context of a functioning organ system, we investigated the metabolic profile of LTA4-derived metabolites in isolated neutrophils as well as when perfused through a spontaneously beating, isolated rabbit heart. The study demonstrates that the metabolic fate of arachidonate released from the endogenous pool of neutrophil phospholipids is different from that of arachidonate derived from exogenous sources.RESULTSInitial experiments evaluated the profile of 5-lipoxygenase products formed after the challenge of neutrophils alone,i.e. utilizing endogenous sources of arachidonate. Human neutrophils (107 mlâ1 in suspension) were primed with GM-CSF and stimulated with fMLP. Significant amounts of LTA4 metabolites were synthesized with maximal production at concentrations higher than 0.1 Î¼m (Fig.1). The most abundant metabolite observed was 20-COOH-LTB4 with lower amounts of 20-OH-LTB4 and LTB4. Nonenzymatic LTA4 metabolites were not seen, and in the absence of endothelial cells or platelets, no LTC4 was produced (Fig. 2 A).Figure 2RP-HPLC analysis of LTA4 metabolites produced by isolated rabbit hearts perfused with GM-CSF-primed human neutrophils. Representative chromatograms are shown from: (A) isolated human neutrophils (107cells) challenged with fMLP (0.3 Î¼m) after priming with GM-CSF (1 nm, 30 min); (B) the entire recirculating perfusate obtained 60 min after the fMLP (0.3 Î¼m) challenge of isolated rabbit heart with no neutrophils; and (C) the entire recirculating perfusate of isolated rabbit heart in the presence of GM-CSF-primed human neutrophils (107 cells) 60 min after the challenge with fMLP (0.3 Î¼m). PGB2 (25 ng) was used as an internal standard. UV absorbance spectra of peaks aâf eluting at the characteristic retention time of 20-COOH-LTB4, 20-OH-LTB4, LTB4LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4, respectively, are shown in insets. Chromatographic peaks labeled withx represent uncharacterized background UV-absorbing material resulting from the extraction of the large volumes of recirculating buffer in the heart perfusion experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In agreement with previous results (16Sala A. Aliev G.M. Rossoni G. Berti F. Buccellati C. Burnstock G. Folco G. Maclouf J. Blood. 1996; 87: 1824-1832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an fMLP challenge of the same number of neutrophils in the reperfused, spontaneously beating, isolated rabbit heart resulted in the production of large amounts of cys-LT (Fig. 2 C), presumably as a result of neutrophil-endothelial cell cooperative synthesis of cys-LT (see Ref.23Sala A. Maclouf J. Folco G. Murphy R.C. Samuelsson B. Inhibitors of Leukotrienes. Birkhauser, Basel, Switzerland1999: 113-124Google Scholar). Whereas no LTA4 products were seen in the perfusate of fMLP-challenged isolated rabbit hearts alone, quantitative analysis revealed that in the neutrophil-perfused hearts the amount of LTA4 metabolites detected was greatly increased and, importantly, was much more that that seen when the same number of neutrophils were stimulated in vitro (Fig.3). The data suggested that neutrophil interaction with the coronary vasculature of the heart not only led to the new synthesis of cys-LTs (transcellular biosynthesis) but also to a 4-fold increase in total LTA4 metabolites, likely because of additional sources of externally derived (nonneutrophil) arachidonate.Figure 3Increased production of LTA4 metabolites by the combination of GM-CSF primed human neutrophils and isolated rabbit hearts.

To minimize the potential homotypic transcellular metabolism occurring during neutrophil activation in suspension (20Sala A. Bolla M. Zarini S. Muller-Peddinghaus R. Folco G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17944-17948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), the number of neutrophils was limited to 2 Ã 106, and cells were allowed to adhere to a plastic surface at the density of 2 Ã 105cmâ2 for 5 min prior to the challenge. Simultaneous evaluation of the metabolic fate of endogenous and exogenous arachidonate was carried out using GM-CSF-primed neutrophils challenged with fMLP in the presence of d8-arachidonate (5 Î¼m). The results shown in Fig.4 indicate a significantly increased abundance of deuterium label (increasedd8/d0 ratio) in nonenzymatic LTA4 hydrolysis products (e.g.Î6-trans-LTB4 isomers and 5,6-dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids) when compared with LTA4 hydrolase metabolites (e.g.LTB4, 20-OH-LTB4 and 20-COOH-LTB4). The LTA4 derived from exogenous arachidonate therefore seemed to be preferentially excluded from the enzymatic conversion to LTB4 and its subsequent metabolites. Relatively low levels of 20-OH-LTB4 and 20-COOH-LTB4 were seen in this experiment compared with Fig. 1 (data not shown) probably reflecting the absence of cell-cell contact and the transcellular metabolism needed for Ï-oxidation of LTB4 (20Sala A.

AA, arachidonic acid.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)One possible explanation for the observed shift with exogenous arachidonate toward a preferential release of LTA4, rather than conversion into LTB4, was that the LTA4hydrolase might have been saturated with substrate. Accordingly, the relative ratio of enzymatic to nonenzymatic metabolites of LTA4 resulting from the addition of increasing amounts of arachidonate in unprimed neutrophils was investigated. As shown in Fig.5, this ratio remained unchanged even when the concentration of exogenous arachidonate was varied (1â10 Î¼m). A comparison of LTA4 product level showed that administration of 2â5 Î¼m exogenous arachidonate together with fMLP in unprimed neutrophils led to amounts of metabolites not different from that observed in the GM-CSF-primed, fMLP-stimulated cells (Fig. 6). In keeping with the results observed with deuterium-labeled arachidonate, when unprimed neutrophils were challenged with fMLP and exogenous arachidonate (2â5 Î¼m) more nonenzymatic LTA4metabolites were produced than seen with GM-CSF-primed cells stimulated with fMLP in the absence of added arachidonate (Fig.7 A), and the ratio of nonenzymatic to enzymatic products showed a 2-fold increase (Fig.7 B). To determine if the increased production of nonenzymatic metabolites reflected an increased availability of intact LTA4 for transcellular metabolism, GM-CSF-primed neutrophils and platelets were co-incubated at a ratio of 1:40 (neutrophil:platelet) and challenged with fMLP (which does not activate the platelets) in the presence of deuterium-labeled arachidonate (5 Î¼m). This resulted in the preferential formation of deuterium-labeled LTC4 (ratio ofd8-LTC4/LTC4 is 2.3) when compared with enzymatic metabolites of LTA4-hydrolase (ratio ofd8-20-OH-LTB4/20-OH-LTB4is 1.2) (Fig. 8).Figure 5Relative amounts of LTA4 escaping LTA4-hydrolase metabolism at different concentrations of exogenous arachidonate.

In addition, however, transcellular metabolic events involving cooperation between different cell species in the synthesis of eicosanoids critically determine the overall quantity, as well as profile, of arachidonate metabolites generated by cell activation at the organ level. We and others (25Maclouf J. Murphy R.C. Henson P. Blood. 1989; 74: 703-707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Brady H.R. Serhan C.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 1307-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) have previously reported transcellular synthesis of cys-LT in mixed cell systems and more recently, the functional consequences of this process, in a model of a spontaneously beating, neutrophil-perfused rabbit heart (15Sala A. Rossoni G. Buccellati C. Berti F. Folco G. Maclouf J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 110: 1206-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 20Sala A. Bolla M. Zarini S. Muller-Peddinghaus R. Folco G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17944-17948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).In the present study we addressed the qualitative and quantitative changes in the profile of arachidonate metabolites produced by the activation of human neutrophils during perfusion of the isolated rabbit heart. In this environment, fMLP stimulation of GM-CSF-primed human neutrophils resulted in the production of very large amounts of cys-LT. In the absence of neutrophils the isolated perfused hearts did not generate detectable LTA4 products. In sharp contrast, the same number of GM-CSF-primed neutrophils stimulated with fMLP in vitro produced significantly lower amounts of overall LTA4 metabolites and only LTA4hydrolase-derived products, namely LTB4 and its Ï-oxidized derivatives, whereas LTC4 as well as nonenzymatic LTA4 metabolites could not be observed. This observation led to the hypothesis that additional arachidonate was provided to the neutrophils by rabbit heart cells, likely endothelial cells, thereby significantly enhancing the production of leukotrienes. The alternative suggestion that the leukotrienes came from the rabbit cells has been previously ruled out, showing that their formation is completely dependent on neutrophil 5-lipoxygenase (15Sala A. Rossoni G. Buccellati C. Berti F. Folco G. Maclouf J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 110: 1206-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Furthermore it appeared likely that this additional arachidonate supplied to neutrophils was undergoing a preferential metabolism into a pool of LTA4 that was readily exported outside of the neutrophil and therefore available for transcellular metabolism into LTC4 by adjacent endothelial cells.The suggestion that exogenous arachidonate plays a critical role in this process was tested in GM-CSF-primed isolated neutrophils challenged in the presence of exogenous, deuterium-labeled arachidonate. This allowed a distinction between metabolites derived from endogenous or exogenous arachidonate. The relative amount of labeled and unlabeled enzymatic (LTA4 hydrolase) metabolites of LTA4 was compared with that of nonenzymatic metabolites as an index of exported LTA4. The results obtained showed that significantly larger amounts of the exogenous arachidonate underwent preferential metabolism to an LTA4pool that was not apparently available to cytosolic LTA4hydrolase, thus resulting in export and nonenzymatic hydrolysis. As predicted, in the presence of a limited number of platelets, the LTA4 arising from metabolism of exogenous arachidonate was preferentially converted into LTC4 by the platelets (rather than into LTB4) as a result of transcellular cooperation between neutrophils and platelets, as described previously.One possible explanation for the different pathway exhibited for exogenous versus endogenous arachidonate was that the LTA4 hydrolase was readily saturated and/or suicide inactivated so that excess arachidonate supplied from outside the neutrophil was oxidized to LTA4 but was unable to be enzymatically hydrated. However, the arachidonate dose-response experiments suggested that this was not the case in that external arachidonate supplied to fMLP-stimulated, unprimed neutrophils at a concentration that yielded the same amount of total LTA4metabolites as that seen from only endogenous sources (fMLP with GM-CSF-primed neutrophils with no added arachidonate) still resulted in preferential production of nonenzymatic products.The data led to the suggestion that exogenous arachidonate is metabolized to leukotrienes by a pathway that is physically separate in the cell involved in conversion of arachidonate from endogenous sources. The simplest version of this concept is that a portion of the 5-lipoxygenase is located at (or translocated to) the plasma membrane and there preferentially metabolizes arachidonate reaching the cell from the outside. LTA4 produced at this site would be available for export and may have some difficulty gaining access to the cytosolic LTA4 hydrolase. More complex pathways may exist but again would require maintenance of separate pools of arachidonate and protection of the exogenous arachidonate-derived LTA4from the hydrolase. These possibilities are currently under investigation. Whatever the mechanism, the observations suggest that this unique pathway of arachidonate metabolism and eicosanoid generation occurs with physiologic cell stimuli not just with deliberately added arachidonate but also with arachidonate derived from adjacent cells and can also be extended to an intact organ, the isolated perfused heart. In this system, the complex transcellular metabolism event(s), namely arachidonate from endothelial cells to neutrophils and LTA4 back to the endothelial cells, seems to result in preferential production of cysteinyl leukotrienes and, as we have shown previously, significant physiologic consequences to the organ as a whole (16Sala A.

Based on our previous structural modeling studies, we conclude that cooperative interactions within the hydrophobic protein core play an integral role in determining the differences in structural stability observed between the methanococcal ADKs. From comparisons of the effects of temperature on protein unfolding and optimal enzymatic activity, we also conclude that thermostability and enzymatic temperature optima are influenced differently by molecular modifications and thus that the protein flexibility required for activity and stability, respectively, is not unconditionally linked within the methanococcal ADKs. There has recently been a drastic increase in the isolation and investigation of microorganisms living under conditions of extreme temperature, pH, or salinity (1Adams M.W.W. Kelly R. Chem. Eng. News. 1995; 73: 32-42Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Of particular interest have been studies to delineate those strategies by which hyperthermophiles grow and flourish in natural environments that approach and even exceed 100 Â°C. This research has focused mainly on the enzymes isolated from these hyperthermophilic organisms and their intrinsic ability to function and remain stable at or near the optimal growth temperature of the organism (2Haney P.J.

Despite numerous comparative studies of proteins from mesophilic and thermophilic organisms, the structural strategies employed in proteins to function in a particular thermal environment have not been fully identified. The interpretation of comparative studies has been limited for several reasons. On the one hand, the net free energy of stabilization of proteins is quite small, and minor changes in structure can significantly affect stability (32Pace C.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 14-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 33Creighton T.E. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar); yet numerous changes can be introduced into most proteins with little effect on overall structure or stability (34Bowie J.U. Reidhaar-Olsen J. Lim W. Sauer R. Science. 1990; 247: 1306-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 35Heinz D.W. Baase W. Matthews B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus, thermoadaptive features are often masked by a background of evolutionary sequence divergence, making interpretation of structural differences difficult. Clearly, comparing sets of enzymes from organisms that are phylogenetically related best minimizes the uncertainty in this kind of approach. Members of the archaeal genus Methanococcus offer an opportunity to compare thermophilic and mesophilic enzyme homologs that share substantial sequence identity (2Haney P.J. Badger J.H. Buldak G.L. Woese C.R. Olsen G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3578-3583Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). We have previously isolated, sequenced, and modeled the structures of the adenylate kinases (ADKs) 1The abbreviations used are:ADKsadenylate kinasesGdmClguanidinium Cl 1The abbreviations used are:ADKsadenylate kinasesGdmClguanidinium Cl from the mesophilicMethanococcus voltae (MVO), the moderately thermophilic Methanococcus thermolithotrophicus(MTH), and the extremely thermophilic Methanococcus igneus (MIG) and Methanococcus jannaschii (MJA) (37Rusnak P.

These enzymes share between 68 and 81% sequence identity, yet their temperature optima for enzymatic activity are 37, 68, 80, and 83 Â°C respectively. adenylate kinases guanidinium Cl adenylate kinases guanidinium Cl In this study, the wild-type methanococcal ADKs and a series of chimeric ADKs were expressed in Escherichia coli and subsequently analyzed for structural stability versusthermal inactivation and denaturation. Our results lead to two major conclusions: 1) the composition of the terminal regions of the methanococcal ADKs makes a major contribution to their thermal stability and optimal temperature for activity; and 2) the temperature for optimal activity and the thermal stability of the methanococcal ADKs are influenced differently by sequence modifications. The methanococcal ADKs contain substantial regions of sequence homology (see Fig. 2). This allowed the generation of hybrid enzymes using the polymerase chain reaction to amplify and then link regions of the MVO and MJAadkA genes (see Olsen et al. (40Olsen O. Borriss R. Simon O. Thomsen K.K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 225: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and Yon and Fried (41Yon J. Fried M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4895Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) for a description of this method). The methanococcaladkA genes, cloned into the pET11b vector (Novagen), were used as the target DNA for all polymerase chain reaction amplifications. Amplifications were performed using Ventpolymerase and primers homologous to the lac operator, T7 terminator, and conserved regions between MVO and MJA adkAgenes (nucleotides 100â119 and 457â477). Site-specific mutagenesis was subsequently performed using mismatched primers in polymerase chain reactions. Polymerase chain reaction fragments coding for chimeric enzymes were cloned into pET11b for expression in E. coli.Each protein-coding region was subsequently sequenced in both directions. E. coli cells (BL21(DE3)) harboring plasmids directing synthesis of wild-type and chimeric ADKs were grown to an absorbance of 0.6 at 600 nm in the presence of 100 mg/liter ampicillin and then induced with 1 mmisopropyl-Î²-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The cultures were incubated for an additional 2â3 h before harvesting by centrifugation. Cells were resuspended and then ruptured by passage through a French press before clarification by centrifugation. Cell extracts containing thermophilic ADKs were heated at 70 Â°C for 30 min to denature theE. coli proteins, which were then removed by centrifugation at 303,000 Ã g for 1 h. ADKs were purified from the supernatant by affinity chromatography on a Cibacron blue column (Sigma) as described previously (37Rusnak P. Haney P. Konisky J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2977-2981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All assays are performed at a final ADK concentration of â¼0.0001 mg/ml. For each experiment, ADK was added to a mixture containing 1.0 mm glucose, 0.4 mmNADP+, 100 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.7). Assay solutions were preheated at the desired temperature for at least 4 min before the reaction was started by the addition of ADP (2.5 mm final concentration). Assay solutions were incubated for 3 min before stopping the reactions. For thermal stable ADKs such as MJA, J160V, V36J, VJV, and JVJ, reactions were stopped by rapid cooling in an ice bath. No appreciable activity was observed for these ADKs below 20 Â°C. Reactions containing mesophilic ADKs were stopped by the addition of perchloric acid (6% final concentration), followed by neutralization and precipitation with KOH and KHCO3 (0.09 and 0.41 m final concentrations, respectively). The thermophilic methanococcal ADKs could not be acid-denatured. Final ATP levels were measured using an ATP-dependent reduction of NADP+ to NADPH involving hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. This reaction was allowed to proceed to completion at 4 Â°C (â¼5 min) and then analyzed for absorbance changes at 340 nm. Assays were repeated several times. The CD spectra were measured on a Jasco J-720 spectrophotometer (Japan Spectroscopic Co., Ltd.) at protein concentrations of 0.25â0.35 mg/ml in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH. 8.0) and an optical path length of 1 mm. Thermal denaturation curves were obtained by monitoring changes in ellipticity at 222 nm as temperature was increased at a rate of 1.5â3 Â°C/min. All proteins examined in this study denatured irreversibly at elevated temperatures, preventing direct determination of Tm. Therefore, the midpoint of rapid denaturation was used to estimate the melting point (Tm) Â± 0.5 Â°C. Long exposure of the ADKs to temperatures below that where rapid denaturation occurred resulted in gradual denaturation and aggregation of the protein. Fast heating rates and high starting temperatures were therefore required to estimate the denaturation midpoints. The spectrum of completely denatured ADK lacked any significant absorption between 190 and 250 nm. For chemical denaturation, each protein (0.3 mg/ml) was equilibrated at 25 Â°C in phosphate buffer containing varying concentrations of GdmCl for a minimum of 40 min prior to measurements. Protein denaturation was monitored by change in CD measurements at 222 nm. Each protein reversibly unfolded in the presence of GdmCl in a single cooperative manner. For the extremely thermophilic MJA, V32J, and J160V ADKs, thermal denaturation incorporating varying GdmCl concentrations was performed under conditions identical to those described above. Despite the presence of GdmCl, thermal denaturation remained largely irreversible. We utilized a set of chimeric adenylate kinase enzymes that combine structural regions of the mesophilic M. voltae (MVO) and hyperthermophilic M. jannaschii (MJA) ADKs to identify structural features that determine the overall thermal stability and temperature activity optimum. The high degree of sequence identity and similarity between the MVO (designated V) and MJA (designated J) ADKs facilitated the generation of chimeric ADKs. For this study, the 36-residue amino-terminal region or the 32-residue carboxyl-terminal region was exchanged to produce chimeras J36V, V36J, V160J, and J160V. Thus, J36V differs from MVO only by the 13 nonconserved residues donated by the MJA N-terminal fragment. Similarly, V36J differs from MJA only by the 13 nonconserved residues donated by the MVO N-terminal fragment. Chimeras formed by the exchange of C-terminal fragments differed from the native enzyme by the 11 nonconserved residues that accompanied fragment exchange. Chimeras with both terminal regions exchanged were also constructed (JVJ and VJV) (Figs. 1and 2). Overall, chimeras JVJ and VJV retain 88% sequence identity to the recipient ADK and have 80% identity to the ADK that donated the two ends. These exchanges resulted in the creation of fully functional chimeric enzymes with dramatically altered thermal properties (see below). To characterize the stabilizing interactions within specific regions of the protein, mutations were also introduced into the chimeric proteins JVJ and VJV. These mutations were introduced in pairs so as to increase the chances of identifying potentially small changes in thermostability (see Figs. 1 and 2 for a detailed description of the constructs). Analysis of the circular dichroism spectrum between 190 and 300 nm for each of the chimeras indicated that the chimeric enzymes were identical to the MVO and MJA ADKs in overall secondary structure composition. The effects sequence differences between the MVO and MJA ADKs have on thermal stability and enzymatic activity were assessed by examining the temperature optimum and temperature-dependent denaturation profile for each native and chimeric ADK. Thermal denaturation midpoints were determined by monitoring changes in secondary structure content as monitored by CD analysis at 222 nm. As can be seen, native MVO and MTH ADKs denatured irreversibly with midpoints of 69 and 86 Â°C, respectively (Figs. 3 and 4). However, for the extremely thermophilic MIG and MJA ADKs, rapid unfolding was not achieved within the temperature range limitation of the assay, indicating melting midpoints in excess of 95 Â°C. To estimate theTm of the MJA ADK, we monitored denaturation in the presence of increasing amounts of GdmCl and estimated theTm at zero GdmCl by extrapolation (Fig. 3). Using this method, the melting point of the MJA ADK was estimated to be between 102 and 105 Â°C, â¼34 Â°C higher than that of the MVO ADK. The validity of this approach was verified by our finding that it accurately predicts the experimentally determined melting point of the MTH ADK in the absence of denaturant. For chimeras V36J and J160V, the addition of GdmCl was also necessary to estimate aTm (Fig. 3).Figure 4Thermal stability of MVO (A) and MJA (B) ADKs and derived chimeras. Curves represent the percent ADK folded based on measurements of secondary structure according to changes in CD ellipticity at 222 nm.

Curves are representative of several experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The thermal denaturation profiles for the 13 chimeric ADKs are shown in Fig. 4. The addition of either terminal region of the MJA enzyme to the MVO enzyme led to chimeras (J36V and V160J) that manifested only a 4â5 Â°C increase in thermal stability compared with MVO (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, chimera JVJ, which contained both N- and C-terminal regions donated by MJA, displayed a thermal stability that was 20 Â°C higher than for MVO (Fig.4 A). A similar but opposite trend was seen for the replacement of the MJA termini with the corresponding regions of the mesophilic MVO ADK. Whereas the Tm of VJV was 20 Â°C less than that of the highly thermophilic MJA, theTm values of V36J and J160V were only â¼5 and 7 Â°C lower than that of MJA (Figs. 3 and 4 B). Additional changes in JVJ and VJV by the introduction of site-specific exchanges at several residue positions (see Fig. 1 for details) led to varying changes in thermal stability, ranging from a 1 Â°C increase in stability to a 10 Â°C decrease in stability (Figs. 1 and 4(A and B)). Examination of the thermal denaturation profiles reveals complex transitions in which the major steep and, presumably, cooperative transition is most often preceded by a less steep and variable transition that occurs at lower temperature. Although it is possible that these results reflect a transition between two states and an even more complex set of transitions, the irreversible nature of ADK thermal denaturation does not allow a detailed and conclusive interpretation of the CD profiles. The exchange of the terminal regions between the MVO and MJA ADKs altered the optimal temperature of each enzyme in a direction that reflected the temperature optimum of the enzyme that donated the terminal region. The temperature optima of chimeras J36V, V160J, and JVJ were 8, 16, and 23 Â°C higher than that of the MVO enzyme (37 Â°C) (Fig.5 A). In comparison, chimeras V36J, J160V, and VJV had temperature optima that were 11, 8, and 13 Â°C, respectively, below that of the MJA enzyme (83 Â°C) (Fig.5 B). The alteration of JVJ and VJV by the introduction of several additional mutations (see Fig. 1) did not alter the temperature optima of the chimeras. Each of the chimeras displayed a specific activity similar to that of the native enzymes, with the exception of JVJ182,185, which had significantly reduced activity levels (data not shown). Despite 68% amino acid sequence identity, the temperature optima and thermal melting points of the MVO and MJA ADKs were found to be separated by 45 and 34 Â°C, respectively. The production and examination of several chimeric enzymes containing regions of these mesophilic and thermophilic ADKs have identified a set of structural modifications responsible, in large part, for the mesophilic and thermophilic nature of the MVO and MJA ADKs. Whereas the replacement of the 36-residue N-terminal region of MVO with the homologous region derived from MJA to form chimeras J36V and V36J or the replacement of the 32-residue C-terminal region of MVO with the homologous region derived from MJA to form V160J and J160V led to single-substitution chimeras that displayed a modest alteration in temperature stability (Â±4â7 Â°C), the replacement of both regions to form JVJ and VJV created chimeras that denatured at a temperature that differed by 20 Â°C from the native enzymes. These results indicate that the terminal regions cooperate to confer thermal stability to the methanococcal ADKs. Although it is possible that our results reflect a direct interaction between N- and C-terminal regions, a consideration of our results within the context of our previous modeling studies (39Haney P. Konisky J. Koretke K.K. Luthey-Schulten Z. Wolynes P.G. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1997; 28: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) leads us to favor an explanation based on interactions of the terminal regions with the protein core (see below). Based on the structural models for the methanococcal ADKs, we predict interactions between three amphipathic Î±-helices (residues 143â165, 180â192, and 16â26) and three Î²-strands (residues 5â9, 170â173, and 34â37) derived from the exchanged terminal regions with two additional Î²-strands (residues 87â90 and 117â121) (Fig.6). Together, these regions of secondary structure form a substantial portion of the hydrophobic core. The majority of the residues that compose this region are conserved between the mesophilic MVO and thermophilic MJA ADK sequences. There remain a relatively small number of nonconserved residues to influence the thermal integrity of the core area (Fig. 6). A majority of the nonconserved residues are hydrophobic and are located in close proximity to each other. Ordered by proximity, these residues are 8 (Val in MVO/Ile in MJA), 19 (Ser/Thr), 24 (Met/Ile), 36 (Met/Ile), 87 (Val/Ile), and 88 (Ala/Val); 19 (Ser/Val), 32 (Val/Ile), and 188 (Thr/Ile); and 9 (Thr/Val), 117 (Leu/Ile), 120 (Val/Ile), and 173 (Val/Ile). We suggest that it is these residues that are involved in the cooperative interactions that determine enzyme stability by significantly altering hydrophobic packing and water accessibility to the core. This would be consistent with previous sequence analyses from which we concluded that the volume of branched chain hydrophobic amino acid residues play a structural role in conferring thermal stability to the methanococcal proteins (2Haney P.J. Badger J.H. Buldak G.L. Woese C.R. Olsen G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3578-3583Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 39Haney P. Konisky J. Koretke K.K. Luthey-Schulten Z. Wolynes P.G. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1997; 28: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis in which we introduced pairs of amino acids within chimeras JVJ and VJV further revealed the importance of the hydrophobic core in determining the overall protein stability of the methanococcal ADKs. J32,36VJ, which was generated from JVJ by the introduction of Val and Met at positions 32 and 36, respectively, exhibited a 6.5 Â°C decrease in temperature stability compared with JVJ (Val and Met reside at positions 32 and 36, respectively, in MVO). In contrast, the stability of V32,36JV, in which Val-32 and Met-36 were both replaced by introduction of Ile (present at positions 32 and 36 in MJA) was not significantly different from that of VJV. The results of these changes can be understood by consideration of our previously modeled structures for the methanococcal ADKs (39Haney P. Konisky J. Koretke K.K. Luthey-Schulten Z. Wolynes P.G. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1997; 28: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This study suggested that residue 32 interacts with residue 19 in the N-terminal region of the protein and residue 188 in the C-terminal region (Fig. 6). These correspond to the interaction of Ile-32 with Val-19 and Ile-188 in MJA and to the interaction of Val-32 with Ser-19 and Thr-188 in MVO. Additionally, residue 36 was predicted to partially interact with residues 20 and 24 (Ile with Thr and Ile in MJA; Met with Ser and Met in MVO). The stabilizing influence of these hydrophobic interactions would not be operative in MVO since MVO Ser-19 and Thr-188 would not participate in stabilizing hydrophobic interactions. Thus, the change from Ile-32 and Ile-36 present in JVJ to Val-32 and Met-32 in J32,36VJ would lead to a disruption in the hydrophobic interactions normally occurring in the MJA ADK and thus explain the reduced stability observed for J32,36VJ. In contrast, the substitution of Val-32 and Met-36 in VJV with Ile-32 and Ile-36 to create V32,36JV would not be expected to lead to a change in thermal stability since the hydrophobic associations are already absent. The effects of amino acid exchanges introduced into chimera JV117,120J further demonstrate the sensitivity of ADK stability to core modifications. It might have been expected that the highly conservative Leu-to-Ile and Val-to-Leu changes introduced into JVJ to generate JV117,120J would not have had a significant effect on thermal stability, yet a dramatic 10 Â°C loss in stability was observed. In accordance with our structural model, we believe that the introduction of Ile-117 and Ile-120 to form JV117,120J in combination with the neighboring Ile-119 and Ile-173 significantly increased the side chain volume near the peptide backbone at the Î²-carbons, leading to thermal destabilization due to suboptimal packing caused by steric interference. Although we fully appreciate the speculative nature of these interpretations, our results strongly suggest that cooperative interactions and packing within this core region are very important determinants for thermal stability. Although our thermal denaturation studies on chimeric ADKs clearly demonstrate the importance of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions in determining the overall stability of the methanococcal ADKs, analysis of enzymatic temperature optima indicates that these structural features contribute to catalytic activity and overall protein stability differently. The properties of chimera V160J and the effects of site-specific mutagenesis on chimeras JVJ and VJV best exemplify a partial separation between interactions influencing stability and activity. Whereas construction of chimera V160J resulted in an â¼16 Â°C increase in temperature optima (Fig. 5 A), overall thermostability was only changed slightly (+5 Â°C) (Fig.4 A). Similarly, mutations to chimeras JVJ and VJV had a variety of effects on stability, but failed to have any influence on temperature optima (Fig. 1). These differing results suggest that the temperature optima for enzymatic activity of these ADKs are not determined by the overall flexibility/stability of the protein. This conclusion is consistent with previous studies that have suggested that the active-site region of the enzyme is more flexible than the molecule as a whole (42Zhang Y.L. Zhou J.M. Tsou C.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1164: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the course of binding substrates, adenylate kinases undergo two large domain shifts: the first when the protein closes over bound AMP and the second when the large lid domain closes over the active site upon ATP binding in a proposed hinge-like movement between rigid bodies (43Gerstein M. Shulz G.E. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 44Diederichs K. Schultz G.E. J. Mol.

Based on our previous modeling studies and assuming a similar substrate binding scheme for the methanococcal ADKs, the terminal regions that we exchanged to construct the MVO/MJA chimeras would not be directly involved in the large domain movements that occur during the substrate-binding cycle. However, they do contain regions that our modeling studies predict would to be in close proximity to the proposed hinge sites (39Haney P. Konisky J. Koretke K.K. Luthey-Schulten Z. Wolynes P.G. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1997; 28: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The results of this study suggest that the temperature optimum for activity of adenylate kinases may be more dependent on the mechanics of conformational movements and substrate binding than the protein's overall flexibility/stability. This can be seen in the â¼10 Â°C lower temperature optimum of JVJ compared with VJV (60 versus 70 Â°C, respectively) despite its greater thermal stability (Tm = 85 versus82.5 Â°C). Although our studies demonstrate that the N- and C-terminal regions of the methanococcal ADKs play a major role in determining overall thermal stability and enzymatic activity, it is apparent that additional mutational studies and a complete structural analysis are required to delineate the full range of structural features that confer structural and functional integrity at elevated temperature. These detailed studies are currently underway. The experiments and analyses of the circular dichroism data were performed at the Laboratory for Fluorescence Dynamics at the University of Illinois. Automated DNA sequencing was carried out at the Genetic Engineering Facility of the University of Illinois Biotechnology Center."

Two of these were designed to generate interdomain cross-links that lock the C-terminal Î±-helical domain against the Î²-sandwich (ÎµM49C/A126C and ÎµF61C/V130C). The second set should give cross-linking between the two C-terminal Î±-helices (ÎµA94C/L128C and ÎµA101C/L121C). All four mutants cross-linked with 90â100% efficiency upon CuCl2 treatment in isolated Escherichia coli ATP synthase. This shows that the structure obtained for isolated Îµ is essentially the same as in the assembled complex.Functional studies revealed increased ATP hydrolysis after cross-linking between the two domains of the subunit but not after cross-linking between the C-terminal Î±-helices. None of the cross-links had any effect on proton pumping-coupled ATP hydrolysis, on DCCD sensitivity of this activity, or on ATP synthesis rates. Therefore, big conformational changes within Îµ can be ruled out as a part of the enzyme function. Protease digestion studies, however, showed that subtle changes do occur, since the Îµ subunit could be locked in an ADP or 5â²-adenylyl-Î²,Î³-imidodiphosphate conformation by the cross-linking with resulting differences in cleavage rates.

A proton translocating F1F0 type ATP synthase can be found in the periplasmic membrane of bacteria, the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts, and the cristae membranes of mitochondria. This enzyme can use a proton gradient to synthesize ATP, a process that is reversible in bacteria where the hydrolysis of ATP is used to generate a proton motive force for substrate and ion transport (1Boyer P.D.

The F1 portion contains the three catalytic sites, each predominantly on a Î² subunit, and located at the interfaces with the Î± subunits. Recent electron microscopy studies show that the F1 and F0 parts are connected by two stalks (8Wilkens S. Capaldi R.A. Biochim. Biophys.

Part of the Î³ subunit was resolved in the bovine heart F1, but neither of these structures provided information about the Îµ subunit (Î´ subunit of mammalian F1). However, the structure of the Îµ subunit when isolated from the E. coli enzyme has recently been solved by both NMR and x-ray crystallography (19Wilkens S. Dahlquist F.W. McIntosh L.P. Donaldson L.W.

This subunit is a two-domain protein with an N-terminal part arranged in a Î²-sandwich structure and the C-terminal portion in a helix-loop-helix motif. To understand how the Îµ subunit functions in the intact ECF1F0, it is necessary to know whether the structure of Îµ is the same in the assembled complex as when isolated. To examine this question, we have created four different mutants, each containing two cysteines, that should form disulfide bridges if the structure of the Îµ subunit is the same as in solution. The effects of generating disulfide bridges within the Îµ subunit on the functioning of ECF1F0 have also been examined. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out according to Kunkel et al. (22Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour M.A. Methods. Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar) using CJ236 (New England Biolabs). For routine cloning procedures, the strain XLI-Blue (Stratagene) was used (23Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

The double mutations in Îµ were created using two oligonucleotides (see Table I) with M13mp18 that contained the wild-type Îµ gene. Screening for mutants was done using the appropriate restriction enzymes. Subcloning of the mutated Îµ gene into pRA100 was performed as described by Aggeler et al. (25Aggeler R. Chicas-Cruz K.

Restriction enzymes used were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals or New England Biolabs. Reconstituted vesicles were washed in DTT-free buffer A (25 mm MOPS/HCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, pH 7.0) before inducing cross-linking with varying concentrations of CuCl2 (1 h, room temperature). The reaction was stopped with 10 mm EDTA (5 min) before 25 Î¼m E5M was added (5 min, room temperature, in the dark). The reaction was quenched by saturating the unreacted cysteines with 10 mm NEM (5 min, room temperature). As a zero control, washed, reconstituted vesicles were reacted with E5M directly. A second control was incubated with 10 mm DTT (1 h, room temperature) and then quenched by adding 20 mm NEM. To all samples, DTT-free dissociation buffer was added and then subjected to 10â20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The same procedure was applied to inner membranes where necessary. Reconstituted ECF1F0 was washed and CuCl2-treated as described above. Then the uncross-linked cysteines were reacted with NEM (10 mm) for 10 min at room temperature, and the volume was raised to 1 ml with buffer A, followed by centrifugation at 60,000 rpm, 20 min, 4 Â°C in a Beckmann TLA100.2 rotor. This procedure was repeated once before adding 5 mm DTT (20 min, room temperature) to open the disulfide bridges in the Îµ subunit. After repeating the washing step twice, free cysteines were reacted with 25 Î¼m E5M for 10 min at room temperature in the dark, and the reaction was quenched with 10 mm NEM. Noncross-linked ECF1F0 was used as a control. All samples were applied on a 10â20% polyacrylamide gel as before. Preweighed trypsin was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Reconstituted vesicles were washed in 25 mm Tris/HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5, to remove DTT and resuspended in the same buffer at 1 mg/ml. Samples were preincubated for 5 min at room temperature in the presence or absence of 5 mm AMP-PNP. Cross-linking was done for 1 h at room temperature in the presence of 75 Î¼mCuCl2. The reaction was stopped with 7 mm EDTA, and Mg2+ AMP-PNP was added to a final concentration of 5 mm (5 min, room temperature) before the trypsinization was started (ECF1F0:trypsin, 50:1). The cleavage was stopped at different times by adding 2 Î¼mphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. The same procedure was applied to noncross-linked ECF1F0. Samples were applied on a 10â20% polyacrylamide gel either in the presence or absence of DTT. 50 Î¼l (1 mg/ml) of inner membranes were diluted 10-fold in buffer B (10 mm Hepes, 5 mmMgCl2, 100 mm KCl, pH 7.0), and then 1 Î¼l of valinomycin (1.8 mm), 5 Î¼l of ACMA (0.1 mm), 5 Î¼l of NADH2 (50 mm), and 5 Î¼l of KCN (200 mm) were added. The fluorescence at 480 nm was measured for a short time before adding 5 Î¼l of ATP (200 mm). After the signal reached a plateau, 1 Î¼l of nigericin (1.8 mm) was added to uncouple the system. The excitation wavelength was 410 nm. For ATP-dependent proton pumping measurements, an SLM 8000 fluorometer was used. Inner membranes were washed twice with 25 mm Tris/HCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mmMgCl2, pH 7.5, diluted to 1 mg/ml, and reacted with 75 Î¼m CuCl2 for 1 h at room temperature if necessary. 200 Î¼l of Tris buffer were added to 50 Î¼l inner membranes (50 Î¼g) followed by 250 Î¼l of reaction buffer (100 mm Tris/HCl, 10 mm ADP, 5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.5). 100-Î¼l samples were immediately quenched with 30 Î¼l of 0.5m trichloroacetic acid on ice to measure the amount of endogenous ATP. To the residual 400-Î¼l sample, 50 Î¼mNADH (4 Î¼l, 0.5 m stock) was added and incubated in a 37 Â°C water bath. The reaction was stopped after 5 min by adding 130 Î¼l, 0.5 m trichloroacetic acid on ice. All samples including the background controls were diluted 25-fold with a buffer containing 0.1 m Tris acetate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.7, and measured. The amount of ATP was determined for 100 Î¼l of diluted sample, adding 50 Î¼l of a 1:2 diluted luciferin/luciferase ATP assay mix (Sigma) and 150 Î¼l of Tris acetate buffer. The emitted light was detected using a chemiluminometer after standardizing with preweighed ATP (also purchased from Sigma). Inner membranes were isolated from the strain RA1 (11Aggeler R. Ogilvie I. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19621-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) according to the procedure of Foster and Fillingame (27Foster D.L.

Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7107-7113Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) was used. ATP hydrolysis was measured using a regenerating system (29LoÌtscher H.-R. deJong C. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4140-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the test of Sedmak and Grossberg (30Sedmak J.J. Grossberg S.E. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 79: 544-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (2471) Google Scholar). Reconstitution of ECF1F0 into Egg-PC vesicles was performed as described (31Aggeler R. Haughton M.A. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9185-9191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). DTT was removed by centrifugation in a Beckman TLA100.2 rotor, for 20 min, 60,000 rpm, at 4 Â°C. The pellet was resuspended in DTT-free buffer and centrifuged again. The step was repeated and the pellets resuspended in DTT-free buffer at a final concentration of 0.5â1 mg/ml. Samples were analyzed on 10â20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R (33Downer N.W. Robinson N.C. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 2930-2936Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). ACMA and E5M were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). All other chemicals were of the highest purity available. Four different double mutants were used in this study, two with cysteine residues introduced at sites that are at the interface between the two domains (M49C/A126C or F61C/V130C, respectively) and two that place the two cysteines in close proximity at the interacting faces of the C-terminal Î±-helices (A94C/L128C or A101C/L121C). Fig.1 shows the position of these substitutions in the Îµ solution structure. With ECF1F0 purified from each mutant, disulfide bond formation was readily obtained in essentially 100% yield when high enough levels of Cu2+ were used. The SDS-polyacrylamide gel in Fig.2 A shows the effect of internal cross-linking on the migration of Îµ for the mutant ÎµM49C/A126C. CuCl2 treatment led to a shift to apparent lower molecular weight but, at the same time, to a weaker overall staining of the Îµ subunit band. This altered staining intensity made it difficult to quantitate cross-link yields. Therefore, the formation of the disulfide bond was also followed by fluorescence after labeling with E5M. Fig. 2, B and C, shows the result of E5M labeling of ÎµM49C/A126C using two different approaches. In one approach, cross-linking was induced by CuCl2, and the amount of Îµ that had not become cross-linked was determined by modification of remaining exposed cysteines with E5M (Fig. 2 B). As a complementary approach, cross-linked enzyme was reacted with NEM to block free cysteines, and then the disulfide bridge was broken by adding DTT to expose cysteine residues previously cross-linked. These were then modified with E5M (Fig. 2 C). Both approaches gave the same results. High cross-linking yields with the mutant ÎµM49C/A126C required 75 Î¼m CuCl2. Fig. 2,D and E, shows cross-linking between the C-terminal helices in the mutant ÎµA101C/L121C. In this case, uncross-linked Îµ labeled with E5M gave a diffuse band (D, lane 3), an effect prevented by previous cross-link formation. As with the other mutants, cross-link yields were quantitated by E5M incorporation. Essentially, a 100% yield of cross-linking could be obtained at 10 Î¼mCuCl2. The effects of cross-linking within the Îµ subunit on the function of the ATP synthase are summarized in Fig.3 A. Those mutants that formed a cross-link between N- and C-terminal domains had ATPase activities similar to wild-type enzyme. As shown for ÎµM49C/A126C in Fig.3 B, ATPase activity increased in proportion to the cross-linking yield, giving a 2.5-fold higher turnover rate. Nevertheless, the cross-linked and activated enzyme retained similar levels of DCCD inhibition to untreated or wild-type enzyme. Moreover, this activation of ATPase was not accompanied by enhanced steady-state levels of ATP-dependent proton pumping when measured by ACMA quenching (Fig. 4) or of ATP synthesis (Fig. 3) when these activities were measured in inner membranes from E. coli. The ATPase activity of the mutant ÎµA94C/L128C was significantly higher than wild-type even before the addition of Cu2+ and essentially the same as that of fully cross-linked enzyme from the mutant ÎµM49C/A126C. Cu2+treatment and the resulting cross-linking of ÎµA94C/L128C in yields greater than 90% failed to increase activity much further. In contrast, the ATPase activity of the mutant ÎµA101C/L121C was normal and not significantly activated by cross-linking. The DCCD sensitivity of both ÎµA94C/L128C and ÎµA101C/L121C was similar to wild-type (Fig.4). For both of these mutants, disulfide bond formation between the two C-terminal Î± helices had no significant effect on proton pumping or ATP synthesis.Figure 4ATP-dependent ACMA quenching of wild-type (A), ÎµM49C/A126C (B), ÎµA94C/L128C (C), and ÎµA101C/L121C (D) in the presence of 5 mm DTT (solid lines) or 100 Î¼m CuCl2 (dashed lines). All mutants had a yield of at least 90% internal cross-link based on E5M fluorescence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The nucleotide dependence of cross-linking of the mutant ÎµM49C/A126C is shown in Fig. 5. Disulfide bond formation was most efficient with 5 mm Mg2+ AMP-PNP present. In the presence of Mg2+ATP, which is rapidly hydrolyzed during the experiment, Mg2+ADP, or Mg2+ADP + Pi (5 mm respectively), the yields of cross-linking were 40â50%, compared with 90â100% in AMP-PNP. This can be seen clearly in the Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 5 A). In Mg2+AMP-PNP (lane 2), there is a nearly complete bandshift, whereas in ADP, ADP + Pi, or ATP (lanes 4â6), two bands are clearly visible. These conclusions are confirmed by E5M labeling (Fig. 5 B). Cross-linking of the mutant ÎµF61C/V130C gave the same general patterns as for ÎµM49C/A126C. The nucleotide dependence of cross-linking of mutants with both Cys in the C-terminal part was not examined in any detail. Earlier studies had shown a nucleotide dependence of the cleavage of Îµ by trypsin in the wild-type ECF1F0 complex (34Mendel-Hartvig J. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10987-10991Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and this proteolysis was found to activate the enzyme. Cleavage of the Îµ subunit was followed in the mutant ÎµM49C/A126C in the presence of Mg2+ADP and in Mg2+AMP-PNP. As with wild-type enzyme, cleavage of uncross-linked enzyme was fast in the presence of AMP-PNP but slow in the presence of Mg2+ADP. If both the mutant was cross-linked and protease digestion was conducted in AMP-PNP, the rate of cleavage was fast. However, if cross-linking occurred in the presence of Mg2+ADP, and then the ADP was replaced by AMP-PNP before trypsin treatment, the cleavage was slow (Fig. 6). Clearly, cross-linking in ADP traps the Îµ subunit in a conformation that is not subsequently modified by the addition of AMP-PNP. The inaccessibility of trypsin to cleavage sites could be a direct result of fixing the two domains of Îµ together so that the C-terminal Î± helix cannot unfold. Alternatively, the cross-link could fix a conformation of the whole ECF1F0 where the cleavage sites in Îµ are sterically shielded by other subunits. The present study offers important insights into the arrangement and functioning of the Îµ subunit in ECF1F0. Four mutants were generated, by reference to the structure of Îµ from NMR studies of the isolated polypeptide (21Wilkens S. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26645-26651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In each of these mutants, the positions of the cysteines are such that they should readily form disulfide bonds if the observed structure is retained in the enzyme complex. Internal cross-links were readily formed in essentially 100% yield between the introduced Cys in all four mutants when ECF1F0 was reacted with Cu2+. Two of the disulfide bridges are between one residue in the N-terminal Î²-barrel part and the very C-terminal Î±-helix of the C-terminal domain of the subunit. The other two disulfide bridges are between a residue in each of the C-terminal Î±-helices. This ready cross-linking would only be expected if the two domains and both C-terminal helices have the same position in ECF1F0 as in isolated Îµ subunit. Therefore, it can be concluded that the structure of Îµ in the intact complex is very similar to that already determined for purified Îµ subunit. The Îµ subunit, along with Î³, is now thought to be a part of the rotor that couples catalytic site events with proton pumping in the complex (11Aggeler R. Ogilvie I. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19621-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 35Schulenberg B. Wellmer F. Lill H. Junge W. Engelbrecht S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Nucleotide-dependent changes in interaction of the Îµ subunit with other subunits in ECF1F0 have been resolved by cross-linking studies (36Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13888-13891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These involve both domains of the subunit, and it has been suggested that the two domains move independently during functioning of the enzyme (35Schulenberg B. Wellmer F. Lill H. Junge W. Engelbrecht S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The observation that the two domains can be tethered together in either of two different places without altering coupling argues against this possibility but does not rule out subtle rotations of one domain relative to the other. The cross-linking studies here rule out that the C-terminal Î±-helices come apart during functioning (21Wilkens S. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26645-26651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This is not to say that conformational changes are absent from Îµ. The nucleotide dependence of cross-linking in mutants forming SâS bridges between the two domains points to some structural changes within Îµ. This notion is also supported by the observation that rates of cleavage of Îµ by trypsin are affected by the nucleotide conditions in which cross-linking is conducted prior to the proteolysis step. When cross-linked in ADP the Îµ subunit was locked in a conformation characterized by very slow proteolysis, a conformation that was not altered by the addition of AMP-PNP before trypsin treatment. In the presence of AMP-PNP, proteolysis of the Îµ subunit is normally rapid. The effect of cross-links within the Îµ subunit on functioning of ECF1F0 adds to our understanding of the role(s) of the two domains of this subunit. Cross-linking to fix the N- and C-terminal domains increases ATP hydrolysis by the enzyme complex up to 2.5- fold. The introduction of Cys for Ala94 plus Leu128 also increases ATPase activity more than 2-fold, an activation that is not greatly enhanced by disulfide bond formation between the introduced Cys residues. The activation of ATP hydrolysis in these mutants is without effect on coupling because, in each case, the steady-state levels of proton pumping, as well as ATP synthesis rates, are unaltered. Therefore, our results support and extend previous studies that indicate that the Îµ subunit acts to regulate ATPase rates in the intact ATP synthase, i.e. that it is an inhibitor of this function in the intact complex (34Mendel-Hartvig J.

Protease digestion of this domain by trypsin in ECF1 (41Mendel-Hartvig J. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1278-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) alters the inhibition by the Îµ subunit, while proteolysis and genetic deletion of part or all of this domain has no effect on coupling function (42Cruz J.A.

Our previous studies have shown that the C-terminal domain lies under the Î±3Î²3 hexagon in the enzyme complex, where it associates with two Î±âÎ² pairs (21Wilkens S. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol.

DNA topoisomerases are enzymes that catalyze changes in the topology of DNA via a mechanism involving the transient breakage and rejoining of phosphodiester bonds in the DNA backbone (1Cozzarelli N.C.

Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar). Studies in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have demonstrated the importance of topoisomerases in transcription, DNA replication, and chromosome segregation. The type II topoisomerases (top2) 1The abbreviations used are:top2topoisomerase IIPCRpolymerase chain reaction make transient DNA double-strand breaks and change the linking number of DNA in steps of two. They play key roles in DNA metabolism and chromosome structure and are essential in eukaryotic cells (2Wang J.C. Annu. Rev.

In order to maintain the integrity of the cleaved DNA during this process, the top2 enzymes form a proteinaceous bridge that spans the DNA break. This bridge is anchored by covalent phosphotyrosyl bonds established between each of the active site tyrosine residues of the homodimeric enzyme and the 5â²-DNA termini of the newly created DNA double-strand break (2Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions, these covalent top2-DNA complexes (referred to as cleavage or cleavable complexes) are normally short lived intermediates in the catalytic cycle of the enzyme. topoisomerase II polymerase chain reaction Beyond its vital cellular functions, top2 is the primary cytotoxic target for some of the most active drugs for the treatment of human cancers (4Corbett A.H.

Teicher B.A. Cancer Therapeutics: Experimental and Clinical Agents. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1997: 153-174Crossref Google Scholar). Top2 catalytic inhibitors do not stabilize DNA cleavage complexes. Bisdioxopiperazines (ICRF 159, 187 (dexrazoxane), and 193) belong to this category (9Hasinoff B.B. Hellmann K. Herman E.H. Ferrans V.J. Curr. Med. Chem. 1998; 5: 1-28PubMed Google Scholar). Top2 poisons inhibit the enzyme by increasing the steady-state levels of DNA cleavage complexes (8Pommier Y.

Top2 poisons can be further subdivided into two groups as follows: the DNA intercalators that include doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, amsacrine, ellipticines/olivacines, and the non-intercalators whose main representatives are the demethylepipodophyllotoxins etoposide (VP-16) and teniposide (VM-26), the quinolones among which CP-115,953 acts as a dual eukaryotic and prokaryotic top2 poison (13Robinson M.J.

Pommier Y. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 1283-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although top2 cleaves DNA at preferred sequences, little is known regarding the mechanism by which the enzyme selects its sites of action. Recent studies with etoposide suggested that etoposide interacts with top2 rather than with the DNA (7Kingma P.S. Burden D.A. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3457-3461Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). On the other hand, studies with a photoactivated amsacrine derivative and with bisantrene/amsacrine congeners indicated that for these agents, drug-DNA interactions are critical for the formation of top2-DNA cleavage complexes (16Sissi C. Bolgan L. Moro S. Zagotto G. Bailly C. Menta E. Capranico G. Palumbo M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 1036-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 17Freudenreich C.H. Kreuzer K.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11007-11011Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Analyses of drug-induced top2 cleavages revealed drug-specific base preferences in the immediate vicinity of the cleavage sites. In the case of amsacrine, A at position +1 was preferred, whereas in the case of etoposide, teniposide, mitoxantrone, and quinolones the highest preference is for C at position â1 (see diagram in Fig. 3). From these results, it has been proposed that drugs bind at the enzyme-DNA interface and form a ternary complex with top2 and the DNA. This model has been referred to as the drug stacking model (8Pommier Y. Teicher B.A. Cancer Therapeutics: Experimental and Clinical Agents.

However, no detailed comparison has been reported for DNA cleavage complexes formed by the yeast and the human top2 enzymes. Furthermore, since detailed fundamental information is available for the yeast enzyme (2Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar, 23Berger J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), but not for the human enzymes, direct comparison of the human and yeast proteins is useful for a structural understanding of the human enzymes as a drug target. Yeast top2 is also a potential target for antifungal treatment, and structural differences between the yeast and human top2 may allow selective targeting of the yeast top2 over its human counterpart. In this way, a clear and detailed comparison between yeast and human top2 is warranted and necessary. Since mutation of a conserved serine residue (Ser740 â Trp) in yeast top2 was recently reported to alter both enzyme-DNA and drug interactions (24Strumberg D. Nitiss J.L. Rose A. Nicklaus M.C. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7292-7301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the homologous mutation (Ser763 â Trp) in human top2Î± was analyzed in this study. Etoposide (VP16) was obtained from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. Amsacrine and mitoxantrone were from the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch (NCI, Bethesda, MD). Azatoxin and its derivatives were provided by Dr. T. Macdonald, Department of Chemistry of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA (15Leteurtre F. Sackett D.L. Madalengoitia J. Kohlhagen G. MacDonald T.

Drug stock solutions were made in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) at 10 mm. Further dilutions were made in distilled water immediately before use. Human c-MYCinserted into pBR322, restriction enzymes, T4 polynucleotide kinase, polyacrylamide/bisacrylamide, and Taq DNA polymerase were purchased from Lofstrand Laboratories (Gaithersburg, MD), Life Technologies, Inc., New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), or Qiagen Inc. (Valencia, CA). [Î³-32P]ATP was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. PCR oligonucleotide primers were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Three sets of labeled DNA fragments were prepared from the human c-MYCgene by PCR. A 254-base pair DNA fragment from the first intron was prepared between positions 3035 and 3288, with numbers referring to GenBankTM genomic positions using oligonucleotides 5â²-GTAATCCAGAACTGGATCGG-3â² for the upper strand and 5â²-ATGCGGTCCCTACTCCAAGG-3â² for the lower strand (annealing temperature 56 Â°C). A 401-base pair DNA fragment from the junction between the first intron and first exon was prepared between positions 2671 and 3072 using oligonucleotides 5â²-TGCCGCATCCACGAAACTTT-3â² for the upper strand and 5â²-TTGACAAGTCACTTTACCCC-3â² for the lower strand (annealing temperature 60 Â°C). A 480-base pair fragment from the first exon containing promoters P1 and P2 was prepared between positions 2265 and 2745 using the oligonucleotides 5â²-GATCCTCTCTCGCTAATCTCCGCCC-3â² for the upper strand and 5â²-TCCTTGCTCGGGTGTTGTAAGTTCC-3â² for the lower strand (annealing temperature 70 Â°C). A 213-base pair fragment from the human c-JUN gene was prepared between positions 5â²-TGTTGACAGCGGCGGAAAGCAGS-3â² for the upper strand and 5â²-CGTCCTTCTTCTCTTGCGTGGCTCT-3â² for the lower strand (annealing temperature 64 Â°C). Single end labeling of these DNA fragments was obtained by 5â²-end labeling of the specific primer oligonucleotide. Ten picomoles of DNA was incubated for 60 min at 37 Â°C with 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase and 10 pm[Î³-32P]ATP (100 Î¼Ci) in kinase buffer (70 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0, 1 m KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Reactions were stopped by heat denaturation at 70 Â°C for 15 min. After purification using Sephadex G-25 columns (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), the labeled oligonucleotides were used for PCR. Approximately 0.1 Î¼g of the c-MYC DNA that had been restricted by SmaI andPvuII (fragment 2265â2745) and XhoI andXbaI (fragment 2671â3072 and fragment 3035â3288) was used as template for the PCR. Ten picomoles of each oligonucleotide primer, one of them being 5â²-labeled, was used in 22 temperature cycle reactions (each cycle with 94 Â°C for 1 min, annealing for 1 min, and 72 Â°C for 2 min). The last extension was for 10 min. DNA was purified using PCR Select-II columns (5 Prime â 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO). Wild-type yeast and human top2, Ser740 â Trp, and Ser763 â Trp proteins were overexpressed using YEpTOP2-PGAL1 or YEptop2-S*W-PGAL1 using yeast strain JEL1t1â (25Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10485-10489Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and purified to homogeneity as described previously (26Worland S.T. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4412-4416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The detailed procedure has been described elsewhere (27Elsea S.H. Hsiung Y. Nitiss J.L. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1913-1920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). DNA fragments (5â10 Ã 104 dpm/reaction) were equilibrated with or without drug in 1% Me2SO, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm ATP, and 15 Î¼g/ml bovine serum albumin for 5 min before addition of 8 units (80 ng) of purified top2 in 10-Î¼l final reaction volume. Unless otherwise indicated, reactions were for 30 min at 37 Â°C. Reactions were stopped by adding 1% SDS (v/v) and further digested with proteinase K (0.4 mg/ml final concentration for 30 min at 55 Â°C). Calcium-promoted DNA cleavage was performed in the same buffer with 5 mm CaCl2 instead of MgCl2 (24Strumberg D. Nitiss J.L. Rose A. Nicklaus M.C. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7292-7301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For DNA sequence analysis, samples were precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in 5 Î¼l of loading buffer (80% formamide, 10 mm NaOH, 1 mm EDTA, 0, 1% xylene cyanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue). Samples were heated to 95 Â°C for 5 min and thereafter loaded onto DNA sequencing gels (7% polyacrylamide, 19:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) containing 7 m urea in 1Ã Tris borate/EDTA buffer. Electrophoresis was performed at 2500 V (60 watts) for 2â3 h. The gels were dried on Whatman No. 3MM paper sheets and visualized using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and ImageQuant software. The determination of preferred bases around top2 cleavage sites was done as described previously (28Capranico G. Zunino F. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 562-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 29Pommier Y. Capranico G. Orr A. Kohn K.W.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5157-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The calcium-promoted, drug-independent DNA cleavage sites induced by yeast and human wild-type top2 and byE. coli gyrase (i.e. in bacterial type II topoisomerase) (31Osheroff N. Zechiedrich E.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4303-4309Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 32Kampranis S.C. Maxwell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22606-22614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) were mapped on the upper strand of the c-MYC first intron fragment (Fig.1). Even in the presence of magnesium, differences in the cleavage sites could be observed. When magnesium was replaced by calcium, higher levels of DNA cleavage were seen in the yeast protein. DNA cleavage sites common to both proteins were seen in the presence of Ca2+. However, there were also major differences in the intensity of cleavage at other sites. Although a number of DNA cleavage sites in yeast were also found in gyrase,e.g. at positions 3227, 3221, 3064, the majority of cleavage sites were specific for either protein. These results suggest that human, yeast, and bacterial top2 are different regarding Ca2+-promoted DNA cleavage in the absence of a top2 drug. To investigate further possible differences between yeast and human top2 DNA cleavage patterns, we compared the drug-induced cleavage sites (Fig. 2). Several cleavage sites induced by etoposide were much stronger with the yeast enzyme, for example in Fig. 2, panel A, at positions 2816, 2842, 2901, and 2962, and in Fig. 2, panel B, at positions 3171 and 3167. Conversely, some etoposide-induced sites were stronger with the human than with the yeast enzyme, e.g. in Fig. 2,panel A, at position 2880 and in Fig. 2, panel B,at positions 3260, 3252, 3223, 3187, 3149, and 3084. In the case of CP-115,953, human top2Î± caused greater cleavage than the yeast enzyme at several sites (in Fig. 2, panel A, at positions 2842, 2880, 2901, and 2996, and in Fig. 2, panel B, at positions 3187, 3149, and 3084). In the case of the gyrase-specific quinolone ciprofloxacin, yeast top2 showed minimal cleavage induction at position 3144 (Fig. 2, panel B). With amsacrine, human top2Î± cleaved more extensively than yeast top2 (in Fig. 2, panel A, at positions 2842, 2912, 2962, and 3008 and in Fig. 2, panel B, at positions 3064, 3081, 3084, 3091, and 3118). At some sites (e.g. positions 3144, 3121, and 2974), however, cleavage was stronger with the yeast enzyme. Similarly, several changes in cleavage sites induced by mitoxantrone were seen. The azatoxin-derivative 11Î²(4â-nitroanilino)azatoxin (15Leteurtre F. Sackett D.L. Madalengoitia J. Kohlhagen G. MacDonald T. Hamel E. Paull K.D. Pommier Y. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 1283-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, panel A) was markedly more active against the human top2Î± than the yeast top2 in the DNA fragment examined. Taken together, these results show different DNA cleavage patterns for yeast and human top2 in the presence of both intercalating and non-intercalating drugs. Because the yeast and human top2 enzymes presented different cleavage activity in the presence of drugs, we compared the DNA base preferences for both proteins in the presence of etoposide, amsacrine, mitoxantrone, and CP-115,953 (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6and Tables I and II). Cleavage sites for the three c-MYC DNA fragments and the c-JUN fragment (see âExperimental Proceduresâ) were analyzed for both DNA strands.Table IBase distribution at each position of etoposide-, amsacrine-, and mitoxantrone-induced DNA cleavage siteshWT-Etoposide (173 sites)A4034455138405161411233394546424346403435C6361444756673730489945435354284854614552G4941504149335742512347534946824327306450T2137343430332840333948382627213946423036yWT-Etoposide (167 sites)A3933244037494153322138352129203140323126C51494644636128275210345457061325257613641G4747504740316451502359624642925221315467T3038473627263436332025253035233249434633hWT-AMSA (64 sites)A211412161614212118144718417151817152020C1514241714201286260212713152523201221G202315182119172024109241562489111813T8131313131114151614811828101315181410yWT-AMSA (61 sites)A131611101623252221122915149281122101417C18121317211669614615232272014261010G171821181210241620320181581613681722T1315161612126141432613922101719172012hWT-Mitoxantrone (106 sites)A2532253528233344351238193026332231312621C333834333528278296220383831202735483637G3216311425252530241023352431392412143229T1620162418302124182225141518143328131219yWT-Mitoxantrone (110 sites)A251225293641393218638272620341938252217C3648333436281717336041412926165237402427G292437292523362536421273537461611142734T2026151813181836234010152027142324313732Position from cleavage siteâ10â9â8â7â6â5â4â3â2â112345678910Underlined numbers represent base frequencies significantly (p < 0.001) greater or lower than expected.

For yeast and human proteins, etoposide preferentially stabilized sites with C at position â1 (Câ1) (Fig. 3 and TableI). This result agrees well with previous analyses (18Capranico G. Binaschi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 29Pommier Y. Capranico G. Orr A. Kohn K.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5973-5980Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Preference on the opposite strand showed a complementary (although slightly weaker) preference for G at position +5. Thus, the different cleavage patterns for yeast and human top2 in the presence of etoposide were not associated with detectably altered base preferences. In the presence of amsacrine (Fig. 4 and Table I), the human enzyme showed a clear preference for A+1 (47 of 64 sites) and a complementary (although weaker) preference for T+4 (28 of 64 sites), which conforms with earlier studies (29Pommier Y. Capranico G. Orr A. Kohn K.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5973-5980Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 33Spitzner J.R. Chung I.K. Gootz T.D. McGuirk P.R. Muller M.T. Mol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 12732-12739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The yeast protein also demonstrated a strong preference for A+1 (29 of 61 sites) but an additional preference for T at position â1 (32 of 61 sites) as well as the complementary A at position +5 (28 of 61 sites), which was not seen in the human enzyme. In case of mitoxantrone (Fig. 5 and TableI), the consensus sequence for the preferred mitoxantrone intercalation site (5â²-AC(A/G)) (35Panousis C. Phillips D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1342-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) was reflected by a preference for A+1 in yeast top2 (38 of 110 sites) and human top2Î± (38 of 106 sites). The preference of C at position +2 did not reach significance for either protein, and position +3 did not show any preference. The human enzyme showed a strong preference for Câ1 (62 of 106 sites). This preference for Câ1 was also seen in the yeast protein, although less strong (60 of 110 sites). Besides the yeast protein revealed an additional preference of T at position â1 (40 of 110 sites) that was not apparent in the human top2Î±. In addition to differences in the base preferences for the positions flanking the cleavage sites, the proteins also showed individual preferences at positions â3 and +8 for the human top2Î± and at positions â9 and +6 for the yeast top2. Thus, our data show significant differences in base sequence preferences between human and yeast top2 enzymes in the presence of amsacrine and mitoxantrone. In the case of etoposide, no significant difference in base preference was observed despite clear differences in observed DNA cleavage patterns. In the presence of the fluoroquinolone CP-115,953 (Fig. 6 and TableII), the human protein preferred cleavage sites with Câ1 (44 of 79 sites), A+1 (38 of 79 sites), and (more weakly) Aâ2 (29 of 79 sites). These results are consistent with other reports (33Spitzner J.R. Chung I.K. Gootz T.D. McGuirk P.R. Muller M.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 238-249PubMed Google Scholar, 36Capranico G. Binaschi M. Borgnetto M.E. Zunino F. Palumbo M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 323-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Complementary preferences for T+4 and G+5 were also observed. The yeast top2 showed additional preferences for Tâ1(Câ1 and Tâ1, 49 of 65 sites) and for G+1 (A+1 and G+1, 54 of 65 sites). There was no clear preference at position â2 for the yeast protein. Interestingly, gyrase showed the Tâ1 and G+1preferences observed for yeast top2 (41 and 50 of 107 sites, respectively). These preferences are in agreement with previous reports obtained with a different fluoroquinolone (37Fisher L.M. Mizuuchi K. O'Dea M.H. Ohmori H. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4165-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that the base preferences for the CP-115,953-induced sites in gyrase are more similar to the yeast than to the human top2Î±. We recently reported that mutation of Ser740 â Trp in yeast top2 affects both DNA and drug interactions (24Strumberg D. Nitiss J.L. Rose A. Nicklaus M.C. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7292-7301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To analyze the effect of the homologous mutation in human top2Î± (Ser763 â Trp), we compared the calcium-promoted DNA cleavages for both mutant proteins (Fig. 7). Even in the absence of drug (in the presence of Mg2+), both mutants presented different cleavage patterns compared with the corresponding wild-type proteins. When magnesium was replaced by calcium, higher levels of DNA cleavage were only seen in the yeast proteins, i.e. in the wild-type enzyme and in top2S740W. New DNA cleavage sites common to both of the mutant proteins were seen in the presence of Mg2+ and Ca2+, although there were considerable differences in cleavage intensity. Most of the DNA cleavage sites in the upper and lower strands were staggered by 4 base pairs with a 5â²-overhang, as expected for concerted top2-induced double-strand cleavage (see Fig. 3) (2Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar, 8Pommier Y. Teicher B.A. Cancer Therapeutics: Experimental and Clinical Agents. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1997: 153-174Crossref Google Scholar, 11Liu L. DNA Topoisomerases: Topoisomerase-targeting Drugs. Academic Press, New York1994Google Scholar). Since the Ser740 â Trp mutation in yeast affects the DNA cleavage patterns induced by both intercalating and non-intercalating drugs (24Strumberg D. Nitiss J.L. Rose A. Nicklaus M.C. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7292-7301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and confers partial resistance to fluoroquinolones and collateral hypersensitivity to etoposide (38Hsiung Y.

Chem. 1995; 270: 20359-20364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we compared the drug-induced DNA cleavage sites for the human top2Î±S763Wprotein to the corresponding wild-type human top2Î± (Fig.8). Several cleavage sites induced in the presence of CP-115,953 were markedly reduced in the top2Î±S763W (at positions 2842, 2883, 2901, 2908, 2912, and 2959). On the other hand, the huma"

The amount of heat produced during ATP hydrolysis by vesicles derived from the endoplasmic reticulum of blood platelets was the same in the absence and presence of a transmembrane Ca2+ gradient.

Heat generation plays a key role in the regulation of the metabolic activity and energy balance of the cell.

The catalytic cycle of the different SERCA can be reversed after a Ca2+ gradient has been formed across the vesicles membrane. During this reversal, Ca2+ leaves the vesicles through the ATPase in a process coupled with the synthesis of ATP from ADP and Pi (7Hasselbach W. Biochim. Biophys.

This efflux is referred to as uncoupled Ca2+efflux. Recently it was shown that the SERCA 1 of skeletal muscle is able to convert osmotic energy into heat. Calorimetric measurements revealed that the amount of heat produced after the hydrolysis of each ATP molecule hydrolyzed increases 2â3-fold when a Ca2+gradient is formed across the vesicles membrane (22de Meis L.

Vesicles derived from the dense tubules of human blood platelets and the light fraction of rabbit skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum were prepared as described previously (25Eletr S. Inesi G.

The muscle vesicle preparation does not contain significant amounts of ryanodine/caffeine-sensitive Ca2+-channels nor does it exhibit the phenomenon of activation of Ca2+ efflux by external Ca2+,i.e. Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release found in the heavy fraction of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (16Inesi G. de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5929-5936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both the muscle and blood platelet vesicles were stored in liquid nitrogen until use. This was measured by the filtration method using 45Ca and Millipore filters (27Chiesi M. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10370-10377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After filtration, the filters were washed five times with 5 ml of 3 mm La(NO3)3and the radioactivity remaining on the filters was counted on a liquid scintillation counter. The free Ca2+ concentration was calculated using the association constants of Schwartzenbach et al. (28Schwartzenbach G. Senn H. Anderegg G. Helv. Chim.

For Ca2+ efflux experiments, the vesicles were preloaded with45Ca in a medium containing 50 mm MOPS-Tris (pH 7.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 20 mm Pi, 0.3 mm CaCl2, 3 mm ATP, and 60 Î¼g of vesicles protein/ml. After 30 (muscle vesicles) or 60 (platelet vesicles) min incubation at 35 Â°C, the vesicles were centrifuged at 40,000 Ã g for 30 min, the supernatant was discarded, and the walls of the tubes were blotted to minimize the volume of residual loading medium. The pellet was kept on ice and resuspended in ice-cold water immediately before use. The efflux was arrested as described above for the Ca2+ uptake. This was assayed measuring the release of32Pi from [Î³-32P]ATP. The32Pi produced was extracted from the medium with ammonium molybdate and a mixture of isobutyl alcohol and benzene (31de Meis L.

The Ca2+-ATPase activity was determined by subtracting the Mg2+ dependent activity from the activity measured in the presence of both Mg2+ and Ca2+. This was measured as described previously (31de Meis L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 190-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). [32P]Pi was obtained from the Brazilian Institute of Atomic Energy. This was measured using an OMEGA Isothermal Titration Calorimeter from Microcal Inc. (Northampton, MA) (22de Meis L. Bianconi M.L. Suzano V.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 24de Meis L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1738-C1744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The calorimeter cell was filled with a reaction medium, and the reference cell was filled with Milli-Q water. After equilibration at the desired temperature, the reaction was started by injecting sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles into the reaction cell and the heat change due to ATP hydrolysis was recorded starting from 2 min after the injection up to a maximum of 30 min. The calorimetric enthalpy of hydrolysis (ÎH cal) was calculated by dividing the amount of heat released by the net amount of ATP hydrolyzed. The units used were moles for ATP hydrolyzed and kcal for the heat released. A negative value indicates that the reaction was exothermic and a positive value indicates that it was endothermic. The PAF used wasdl-Î±-phosphatidylcholine Î²-acetyl-Î³-O-hexadecyl (1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine), obtained from Sigma. PAF was dissolved in ethanol. Thapsigargin (LC Service, Woburn, MA) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. After dilution, the final concentrations of ethanol and dimethyl sulfoxide in the assay medium were less than 1%. 45Ca was purchased from Dupont (Wilmington, DE). All other reagents were of analytical grade. In agreement with previous reports, we found that the vesicles derived from blood platelets (Fig. 1 A and TableI) were able to accumulate a smaller amount of Ca2+ than the vesicles derived from muscle (Fig. 2 A and TableII). During transport the two vesicle preparations catalyze simultaneously the hydrolysis (Figs.1 B and 2 B) and the synthesis of ATP from ADP and Pi. The rate of synthesis was severalfold slower than the rate of hydrolysis. Using the same experimental conditions as those described in Tables I and II and in the presence of 1 Î¼mfree Ca2+, the rates of ATP synthesis for platelets and muscle vesicles were 0.08 Â± 0.01 (6Dumonteil E.

The kinetics of Ca2+ transport and ATP synthesis have been analyzed in detail in previous reports (7Hasselbach W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 515: 23-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 8de Meis L. Bittar E. The Sarcoplasmic Reticulum: Transport and Energy Transduction. Vol. 2.

Biophys. 1993; 306: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this study we focused on heat produced during transport. The overall reaction of Ca2+ transport was exothermic regardless of whether muscle or platelet vesicles were used (Figs. 1 C and2 C). The amount of heat released during the different incubation intervals was proportional to the amount of ATP cleaved. This could be visualized by either plotting the heat released as a function of the amount of ATP hydrolyzed (Fig.3) or calculating the ÎH cal using the values of heat release and Pi produced at different incubation intervals (Fig.4). Two different ATPase activities can be distinguished in both platelet and muscle vesicles. The Mg2+ dependent activity requires only Mg2+ for its activation and is measured in the presence of EGTA to remove contaminant Ca2+ from the assay medium. The ATPase activity which is correlated with Ca2+ transport requires both Ca2+ and Mg2+ for full activity. In both vesicle preparations, the Mg2+-dependent ATPase activity represents a small fraction of the total ATPase activity measured in presence of Mg2+ and Ca2+ (Figs.1 B and 2 B). The amount of heat produced during the hydrolysis of ATP by the Mg2+-dependent ATPase was the same regardless of whether muscle or platelet vesicles were used (Fig. 3 C) and the ÎH calvalue (Fig. 4 and Tables I and II) calculated in the two conditions was the same as that previously measured with soluble F1 mitochondrial ATPase (23de Meis L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 598-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and soluble myosin at pH 7.2 (32Gajewski E. Steckler D.K. Goldberg R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12733-12737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the vesicles derived from muscle (SERCA 1) the formation of a Ca2+ gradient increased the yield of heat production during ATP hydrolysis (Figs.3 B and 4 B and Table II). This was not observed with the use of platelet vesicles (SERCA 2b and 3) where the yield of heat produced during ATP cleavage was the same in the presence and absence of a transmembrane Ca2+ gradient (Figs.3 A and 4 A and Table I). For the muscle vesicles (Table II), there was no difference in the ÎH cal value of the Mg2+-dependent ATPase and the Ca2+-ATPase when the vesicles were rendered leaky (no gradient). With intact vesicles, the ÎH calvalue was more negative, i.e. more heat was produced during the hydrolysis of each ATP molecule when the free Ca2+concentration in the medium was decreased from 10 to 1 Î¼m(Fig. 4 B and Table II). During transport, the Piavailable in the assay medium diffuses through the membrane to form Ca2+ phosphate crystals inside the vesicles. These crystals operate as a Ca2+ buffer that maintains the free Ca2+ concentration inside the vesicles constant (â¼5 mm) at the level of the solubility product of calcium phosphate (8de Meis L. Bittar E. The Sarcoplasmic Reticulum: Transport and Energy Transduction. Vol. 2. John Wiley and Sons, New York1981Google Scholar, 33de Meis L. Hasselbach W. Machado R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 62: 505-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The energy derived from the gradient depends on the difference between the Ca2+ concentrations inside and outside the vesicles. Thus, the different values of ÎH cal measured with the muscle vesicles with 1 and 10 Î¼m Ca2+ suggest that when the free Ca2+ concentration in the medium is lower, the gradient formed across the vesicles membrane is steeper; thus more heat was produced and a more negative value of the ÎH cal for ATP hydrolysis was observed. With vesicles derived from blood platelets, there was no extra heat production during Ca2+ transport regardless of the free Ca2+ concentration in the medium (Figs. 3 A and4 A and Table I). Similar to muscle, Pi diffuses through the membrane of the platelet vesicles forming calcium phosphate crystal inside the vesicles that ensures the maintenance of the free Ca2+ concentration in the vesicles lumen at the same level as that of the muscle (â¼5 mm). Thus during transport, the Ca2+ gradient formed across the membrane in the presence of 1 and 10 Î¼m Ca2+ should be the same in muscle and platelet vesicles. These findings indicate that different from the muscle, the Ca2+-ATPase of platelets is not able to convert the osmotic energy derived from the gradient into heat.Table IHeat production during Ca2+ transport and ATP hydrolysis by the platelets Ca2+-ATPaseCa2+Ca2+ uptakeATPase activityHeat releasedÎH calÎ¼mÎ¼mol/mg, 30 minÎ¼mol/mg, 30 minmcal/mg, 30 minkcal/mol0â0.35 Â± 0.08 (7)4.17 Â± 0.87 (7)â12.30 Â± 0.71 (7)0.10.047 Â± 0.007 (3)0.80 Â± 0.11 (6)9.80 Â± 1.30 (6)â13.43 Â± 2.27 (6)0.40.129 Â± 0.038 (6)1.45 Â± 0.26 (9)14.34 Â± 1.67 (9)â10.73 Â± 0.86 (9)1.00.144 Â± 0.020 (3)1.77 Â± 0.29 (4)15.93 Â± 0.75 (4)â9.91 Â± 1.93 (4)10.00.215 Â± 0.023 (9)1.61 Â± 0.23 (15)17.11 Â± 2.59 (15)â10.99 Â± 1.09 (15)The assay medium composition and experimental conditions were as described in Fig. 1 using 5 mm EGTA (zero Ca2+) or 0.1 mm EGTA and 0.029, 0.063, 0.082 or 0.112 mmCaCl2.

Kinetics evidence described in previous reports (22de Meis L. Bianconi M.L. Suzano V.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 24de Meis L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1738-C1744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that the extra heat measured in muscle vesicles was related to the uncoupled Ca2+ efflux mediated by the Ca2+-ATPase. This can be measured arresting the pump by the addition of an excess EGTA to the medium (Fig.5). In this condition, the free calcium available in the medium is chelated but MgÂ·ATP and other reagents remain at the same concentration as those used in the experiments of Figs. 1 and 2. For the muscle vesicles, the efflux promoted by EGTA decreased when thapsigargin, a specific inhibitor of the Ca2+-ATPase (34Thastrup O. Foder B. Scharff O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 142: 654-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 35Sagara Y. Fernandez-Belda F. de Meis L. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12606-12613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was added to the medium simultaneously with EGTA. The difference between the total efflux and the efflux measured in the presence of thapsigargin represents the uncoupled efflux mediated by the Ca2+-ATPase (19de Meis L. Inesi G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 299: 33-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 36Wolosker H. de Meis L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1376-C1381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in muscle vesicles it represents about 70% of the total Ca2+ efflux (Fig. 5 and TableIII). The uncoupled efflux can also be measured diluting vesicles previously loaded with Ca2+ in a medium containing only buffer and EGTA (Fig.6 B and Tables III andIV). For the muscle vesicles, this leakage was also decreased by thapsigargin to the same extent as that measured in the conditions of Fig. 5. The Ca2+ efflux of platelet vesicles was slower than that of muscle and was not impaired by thapsigargin, regardless of the method used to measure the efflux (Fig. 6 A and Table IV). These data suggest that Ca2+ leaks through the SERCA 1 of skeletal muscle but not through the SERCA 2B and 3 found in blood platelets. Therefore, the difference of heat production measured in muscle and platelet vesicles after formation of a transmembrane gradient (Fig. 3 and Tables I andII) could be due to the absence of uncoupled Ca2+ leakage through the Ca2+-ATPase in platelet vesicles (thapsigargin-sensitive efflux in Table III).Table IIICa2+ efflux from skeletal muscle vesiclesMethod usednCa2+ effluxTotal (A)5 Î¼m TG (B)TG-sensitive (A-B)nmol/mg minâ1Without PAF 1) Preloaded and diluted8206 Â± 3366 Â± 14139 Â± 24 2) EGTA added during uptake7203 Â± 2663 Â± 19140 Â± 22With 4 Î¼m PAF 3) Preloaded and diluted8196 Â± 34109 Â± 1994 Â± 23 4) PAF added during uptake4228 Â± 3897 Â± 20130 Â± 38In 1 and 3 the vesicles were previously loaded with 45Ca as described under âExperimental Proceduresâ and then diluted in a medium containing 50 mm MOPS/Tris (pH 7.0) and 0.1 mm EGTA as described in Fig. 6 B.

In previous reports it was shown that some of the lipids derived from the breakdown of membrane phospholipids were able to increase the uncoupled efflux mediated by the Ca2+-ATPase of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (37Cardoso C.M. de Meis L. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 49-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We therefore tested different lipids in platelet vesicles in search of a compound that could promote a thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ efflux. The reasoning was that if we could promote the leakage of Ca2+ through the platelet Ca2+-ATPase then, similar to the muscle vesicles, the platelet vesicles should become able to convert osmotic energy into heat. In the course of these experiments we found thatdl-Î±-phosphatidylcholine Î²-acetyl-Î³-O-hexadecyl could promote such an efflux in platelets but not in muscle vesicles. This phospholipid belongs to a family of acetylated phospholipids known as PAF which are produced when cells involved in inflammatory process are activated. PAF was found to inhibit the Ca2+ uptake of both platelets and muscle vesicles (Figs. 7 and 8 and TableV). With the two vesicles, half-maximal inhibition was obtained with 4 to 6 Î¼m PAF. In contrast with the Ca2+ uptake, the ATPase activity of the two vesicle preparations was not inhibited by PAF (Fig. 7). The discrepancy between Ca2+ uptake and ATPase activity suggests that the decrease of Ca2+ accumulation was promoted by an increase of Ca2+ efflux and not by an inhibition of the ATPase. The amount of Ca2+ retained by the vesicles is determined by the differences between the rates of Ca2+ uptake and Ca2+ efflux. The higher the efflux, the smaller the amount of Ca2+ retained by the vesicles. The addition of PAF during the course of Ca2+ uptake promoted the release of Ca2+ until a new steady state level of Ca2+retention was achieved (Fig. 8 and Table V). With both preparations, when the higher concentration of PAF was added, the lower the new steady state level of Ca2+ filling (Figs. 7 and 8). The release of Ca2+ promoted by PAF was not accompanied by a burst of ATP synthesis. On the contrary, PAF inhibited the synthesis of ATP driven by the coupled Ca2+ efflux (Fig.9). This indicates that Ca2+release promoted by PAF was not promoted by an increase of the reversal of the pump. A major difference between the muscle and platelet vesicles was found when thapsigargin was added to the medium together with PAF. For platelet vesicles, the rate of Ca2+ release measured after the addition of PAF was greatly decreased in the presence of thapsigargin (Fig. 8 A and Table IV) indicating that most of the Ca2+ left the vesicles through the ATPase as an uncoupled Ca2+ efflux. This could be better seen after the initial minute of incubation. In fact, the rate of release in platelet vesicles was so fast that we could not measure the initial velocity of release with the method available in our laboratory. Thus, the values with PAF in Table III differ from the other values in that it does not reflect a true rate, but only the parcel of Ca2+ released during the first incubation minute. In muscle, the rate of Ca2+ efflux measured after the addition of PAF was slower than that measured with platelet vesicles (compare Fig. 8, A and B) and the proportion between the Ca2+ effluxes sensitive and insensitive to thapsigargin measured with PAF was practically the same as that measured when the pump was arrested with EGTA (Table IV).Figure 8Ca2+ release after the addition of PAF .

Having found a compound that induces the release of Ca2+through the pump, we then measured the heat produced during ATP hydrolysis in the presence and absence of PAF. The PAF concentrations selected were sufficient to enhance the rate of efflux without completely abolishing the retention of Ca2+ by the vesicles, i.e. without abolishing the formation of a Ca2+ gradient through the vesicles membrane (Fig. 8). In such conditions PAF was found to enhance the amount of heat produced during the hydrolysis of ATP by blood platelets (Fig.10 and Table V). In muscle vesicles, however, PAF was found to decrease the amount of heat produced during ATP hydrolysis. The ÎH cal values measured with PAF and muscle vesicles were less negative than those measured in the absence of PAF, but still more negative than the values measured in the absence of Ca2+ gradient. It is generally assumed that the energy released during the hydrolysis of ATP by Ca2+-ATPase can be divided in two non-interchangeable parts, one is converted into heat and the other is used to pump Ca2+ across the membrane (1Clausen T.

By this route, a part of the energy released during ATP hydrolysis is dissipated into the surrounding medium as heat. The other part is used to pump Ca2+ across the membrane. During uptake, a fraction of the Ca2+ accumulated flows back through the Ca2+-ATPase from the vesicles lumen to the medium driven by the Ca2+ gradient. This efflux is coupled with the production of heat (thapsigargin-sensitive efflux). Thus, for the muscle vesicles, heat would be produced at least in two different steps of the energy interconversion cycle: (i) during the hydrolysis of ATP, where a part of the chemical energy released was directly converted into heat and (ii) during the leakage of Ca2+ through the ATPase where part of the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis used to pump Ca2+ is first converted into osmotic energy, and then converted by the enzyme into heat (22de Meis L. Bianconi M.L. Suzano V.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 24de Meis L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1738-C1744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The data reported show that not all SERCA isoforms are able to readily convert osmotic energy into heat. The vesicles of blood platelets, as obtained after cell fractionation, are not able to promote this conversion. These vesicles, however, can be converted by PAF into a system capable of increasing the heat production during ATP hydrolysis, suggesting that the mechanism capable of providing additional heat production can be turned on and off and this could represent a mechanism of thermoregulation specific of the cells expressing SERCA 2b and 3. Both in muscle and platelet vesicles there is a Ca2+ efflux which is not inhibited by thapsigargin. We do not know through which membrane structure this Ca2+ flows, but the data obtained with platelets before the addition of PAF indicate that during this efflux, osmotic energy is not converted into heat. In platelets, PAF promoted simultaneously the appearance of thapsigargin-sensitive efflux and extra heat production during ATP hydrolysis (Tables IV and V). These observations corroborate with the notion that the conversion of osmotic energy into heat cannot be promoted by any kind of Ca2+leakage and that a device is needed for this conversion (24de Meis L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1738-C1744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum, this device seems to be the Ca2+-ATPase itself, which in addition to interconvert chemical into osmotic energy, could also convert osmotic energy into heat. Regardless of its possible physiological implication, in this study the use of PAF as an experimental tool permitted us to show that the platelet vesicles can be converted from an inactive into an active system capable of converting osmotic energy into heat. Heat generation is implicated in the regulation of several physiological processes including metabolism and energy balance of the cell. The Vmax of most enzymes varies significantly after a discrete temperature change leading to a substantial change of the metabolic activity of the cell (1Clausen T. Hardeveld C.V. Everts M.E. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 733-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 2Chinet A.E. Decrouy A. Even P.C. J. Physiol.

PAF was originally described as a soluble factor in blood, so it is apparent that some cells secrete it following synthesis. Subsequent experimentation revealed that the secretion of PAF varies greatly depending on the cell type. In some cells, for instance, endothelial cells, the PAF synthesized is not secreted and is used by the cell itself (for reviews, see Refs. 38Prescott S.M. Zimmerman A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17381-17384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 39Chao W. Oslo M.S. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 617-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The synthesis of PAF is initiated by phospholipase A2. The subsequent steps of synthesis are catalyzed by enzymes located in the endoplasmic reticulum. In metabolic labeling experiments, PAF appears first in the endoplasmic reticulum and then in the plasma membrane. PAF causes an elevation of the cytosolic-free Ca2+ promoted by the release of Ca2+ from both the plasma membrane and from intracellular stores. This was shown in various cells that express SERCA 2B and 3 including platelets, neutrophils, macrophage, endothelial cells, and neuronal cells (38Prescott S.M. Zimmerman A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17381-17384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Chao W. Oslo M.S. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 617-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). PAF can therefore act in two different manners, through a receptor in the plasma membrane or as an intracellular messenger. The affinity for PAF of the cell membrane receptor is very high, and the PAF concentration needed for cell activation varies between 10â12 and 10â9m, a concentration much smaller than that needed in this report to activate the thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ efflux in platelet vesicles (38Prescott S.M. Zimmerman A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17381-17384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Chao W. Oslo M.S. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 617-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The only possibility that the effect of PAF observed in this report could have some physiological implication is if the concentration of PAF reaches the micromolar range in the microenvironment surrounding the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, where the Ca2+-ATPase is located and PAF is synthesized. In this case, the local effect of PAF not only would promote the release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 8 A) but also enhance the amount of heat produced during hydrolysis of ATP (Tables IV and V). We are grateful to Valdecir A. Suzano for the technical assistance."

Seven different cDNAs have been identified that encode for MCTs in mammalians, designated MCT1 to MCT7 (3Garcia C.K. Goldstein J.L. Pathak R.K. Anderson R.G. Brown M.S.

Grollman E.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: R1824-R1828PubMed Google Scholar) and muscle fibers (8Wilson M.C. Jackson V.N. Heddle C. Price N.T. Pilegaard H. Juel C. Bonen A. Montgomery I. Hutter O.F.

Three additional MCT isoforms, MCT5, MCT6, and MCT7, have been identified in human tissues (6Price N.T. Jackson V.N. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms of lactate export and import have been extensively investigated in a variety of tissues (for review, see Ref.9Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C761-C782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), little information has been available concerning the mechanisms of lactate transport by the distal nephron, and the molecular identity of these transporters has not been established. To our knowledge, only one study has been performed on the MTAL. Vinay et al. (10Vinay P. Senecal J. Noel J. Tejedor A. Berteloot A. Gougoux A. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: F1042-F1053PubMed Google Scholar) reported the presence of a lactate/OHâ(HCO3â) antiporter in preparations of basolateral membrane vesicles isolated from the dog MTAL. That study, however, was derived from experiments in membrane preparations that were more enriched with Î³-glutamyltransferase, now recognized as a luminal marker of the MTAL (11Attmane-Elakeb A. Chambrey R. Tsimaratos M. Leviel F. Blanchard A. Warnock D.G. Paillard M. Podevin R.-A. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 1051-1057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), than with Na+/K+-ATPase, a basolateral marker. As a result, the allocation of a lactate/OHâ(HCO3â) antiporter to the basolateral or luminal membrane domains and its possible physiological role are not yet known. This study was initiated in an attempt to characterize, at both the functional and molecular levels, the possible presence of monocarboxylate transporters at the luminal and/or basolateral cell surfaces of the MTAL. Isotopic flux studies performed on basolateral (BLMVs) and luminal (LMVs) membrane vesicles isolated from rat MTALs provide evidence for the presence of a CHC-sensitive lactate/H+ cotransporter restricted to BLMVs, whereas a H+-independent organic anion exchanger has been detected in LMVs. We also demonstrate, using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy and Western blot analysis of BLMVs and LMVs, that the recently cloned MCT2 isoform (4Garcia C.K. Brown M.S. Pathak R.K. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1843-1849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) is specifically expressed on the basolateral domain of the rat MTAL, whereas the MCT1 isoform could not be detected in this nephron segment. Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (250â300 g) were anesthetized with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg intraperitoneal), and the kidneys were removed quickly, decapsulated, and sliced sagittally. The method used for isolating MTAL tubules was the same as that previously described (11Attmane-Elakeb A. Chambrey R. Tsimaratos M. Leviel F. Blanchard A. Warnock D.G. Paillard M. Podevin R.-A.

( Lond. ). 1998; 506: 689-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, under stereomicroscopic control, the inner stripe of the outer medulla was carefully excised. The resulting tissue was subjected to collagenase treatment. In the final suspensions, no significant activity of maltase, a marker of the proximal tubule brush-border membrane, could be detected, whereas its specific activity in homogenates from the immediately adjacent outer stripe of the outer medulla was â¼150 nmol/mg of protein/min, excluding significant contamination of the starting material with tubule segments from the outer stripe of the outer medulla. Typically, the preparation began with 30â60 mg of protein from MTAL tubules obtained from the kidneys of 20 rats. LMVs and BLMVs were prepared from purified rat MTAL tubules as described previously in detail (11Attmane-Elakeb A. Chambrey R. Tsimaratos M. Leviel F. Blanchard A. Warnock D.G. Paillard M.

Podevin R.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3243-3250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Differential and Percoll gradient centrifugations were used for isolating basolateral membrane fractions from whole renal cortex (14Boumendil-Podevin E.F. Podevin R.-A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 735: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Transport assays were performed after overnight storage of the vesicles at â85 Â°C. l-[14C]Lactate and36Clâ uptake in the membrane vesicles was assayed at 20â25 Â°C by a rapid filtration technique. For each experiment, the specific conditions are given in the figure legends. The reaction was stopped with 1.4 ml of ice-cold stop solution containing 20 mm Tris/Hepes (pH 7.40) and the desired potassium gluconate concentration to maintain constant osmolarity. This suspension was rapidly filtered on a 0.45-Î¼m prewetted Millipore cellulose filter (HAWP) and washed with an additional 16 ml of ice-cold stop solution. In all experiments, vesicle uptake was corrected for nonspecific isotopic binding to the filter. Radioactivity was determined using a Î²-scintillation counter. Fractionated basolateral and apical membranes were solubilized and separated by SDS-7.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For immunoblotting, nitrocellulose was first incubated in 10% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature to block nonspecific binding of antibody, followed by an overnight incubation at 4 Â°C with different diluted primary antibodies. Membranes were then washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 5 min each before incubation with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). Blots were washed as described above, and luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to visualize bound antibodies on Polaroid film. Photographs of immunoblots were numerized with NIH image software. For peptide inhibition experiments, the anti-MCT1 and anti-MCT2 antibodies were preincubated with 100 Î¼g/ml concentrations of the specific immunizing peptides prior to immunoblotting basolateral membrane fractions. Rat kidneys were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/Ham's F-12 medium. Coronal kidney sections were incubated overnight at 4 Â°C in 4% paraformaldehyde and then embedded in paraffin. Subsequently, 4-Î¼m sections of the paraffin block were deparaffinized, washed in graded ethanol, rehydrated in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.6) (TBS), and subjected to microwave antigen retrieval. To reduce nonspecific binding, sections were treated with background reducing buffer from Dako Corp. (Copenhagen, Denmark). This was blotted away after 10 min, and the sections were incubated with a 1:200 dilution of chicken anti-rat MCT2 peptide polyclonal antibody (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA) overnight in a humid chamber at room temperature. Sections were then washed in TBS (3 Ã 5 min) and incubated with a 1:200 dilution of biotinylated anti-chicken immunoglobulin (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA), followed by Cy2-conjugated streptavidin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1:500 in TBS, each for 30 min at room temperature with three TBS washes in between. Sections were mounted in Glycergel solution (Dako Corp.). Slides were then observed using a Leica TCS SP confocal laser microscope equipped with an ArKr laser (excitation at 488 nm and detection at 502â601 nm). Control experiments using anti-MCT2 antibody preadsorbed with a 100 Î¼g/ml concentration of the immunizing peptide revealed no labeling. To ascertain the presence of MCT2 in medullary thick ascending limbs, sections were dually labeled with anti-MCT2 antibody and an antibody to NHE3, which specifically stains apical membranes of thick ascending limbs within the inner stripe of the outer medulla (15Amemiya M. Loffing J. Lotscher M. Kaissling B. Alpern R.J. Moe O.W. Kidney Int. 1995; 48: 1206-1215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Microwaved sections were first stained for MCT2 as described above. Sections were then incubated with a 1:100 dilution of monoclonal anti-NHE3 antibody (Chemicon International, Inc.), followed by Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1:200 in TBS, each for 30 min with three TBS washes in between. Sections were then washed in TBS (3 Ã 5 min). Sections were mounted and observed using the confocal microscope. To avoid cross-talk (unwanted overlap range) of emission spectra of Cy2 and Cy3, sequential scanning was used. Cy2 was excited at 488 nm and detected at 502â601 nm, and then, on exactly the same field, Cy3 was excited at 568 nm and detected at 560â650 nm. From Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, we obtainedl-[U-14C]lactic acid. H36Cl obtained from NEN Life Science Products was titrated to neutrality with tetramethylammonium (TMA) base to produce TMA36Cl. Rabbit polyclonal antibody to NHE3 was a gift of Dr. R. Alpern (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). Mouse monoclonal antibody to NHE3 and chicken anti-rat MCT2 peptide, anti-rat MCT1 peptide, and anti-Na+/K+-ATPase polyclonal antibodies were from Chemicon International Inc. All data are represented as the means Â± S.E., and error bars in the figures also represent S.E. Comparison between groups was generally carried out by ANOVA. For all analyses, statistical significance was accepted as p < 0.05. Since outwardly directed OHâ gradients have been reported to stimulate l-lactate uptake in partially purified basolateral membrane vesicles isolated from the dog MTAL (10Vinay P. Senecal J. Noel J. Tejedor A. Berteloot A. Gougoux A. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: F1042-F1053PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated for the presence of this possible mode of lactate transport in both BLMVs and LMVs. These experiments were conducted in the presence of a valinomycin voltage clamp. As illustrated in Fig.1, an inside alkaline pH gradient (intravesicular pH (pHi) = 7.8, extravesicular pH (pHo) = 5.5) stimulated the rate ofl-[14C]lactate uptake compared with no pH gradient (pHi = pHo = 7.8) and induced transient accumulation of l-[14C]lactate to levels â¼8- and 3-fold greater than equilibrium values in BLMVs and LMVs, respectively. The pH gradient-stimulated uptake of lactate could be explained by the transport of this anion via non-ionic diffusion of lactic acid or via carrier-mediated H+/lactate cotransport. To distinguish between these possibilities, we evaluated the effect of CHC, a relatively specific inhibitor of H+-coupled monocarboxylate transporters (16Halestrap A.P. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1974; 138: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), on the initial rates ofl-[14C]lactate uptake under the same conditions as in the Fig. 1 experiments. Fig.2 shows that pH gradient-stimulatedl-[14C]lactate uptake in BLMVs was sensitive to CHC inhibition with an IC50 of 63 Â± 16 Î¼m. In marked contrast, CHC, even at a concentration of 5 mm, had no effect on the pH gradient-stimulatedl-[14C]lactate uptake in LMVs. These results are consistent with carrier-mediated lactate/H+ cotransport (or lactate/OHâ exchange) in BLMVs and with transport of lactate via non-ionic diffusion of lactic acid in LMVs. We next compared the effect of several less specific anion transport blockers such as furosemide, DIDS, and phloretin (9Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C761-C782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) on the pH gradient-stimulated transport ofl-[14C]lactate in BLMVs and LMVs. As shown in Fig. 3, with the exception of phloretin, DIDS and furosemide significantly inhibited the BLMV transporter. In contrast, the pH gradient-stimulated transport ofl-[14C]lactate in LMVs was not significantly inhibited by all of the tested agents. These findings confirm the view that lactate/H+ cotransport is present only in BLMVs. It is well established (3Garcia C.K. Goldstein J.L. Pathak R.K. Anderson R.G. Brown M.S. Cell. 1994; 76: 865-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 9Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C761-C782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lin R.Y. Vera J.C.

Physiol. 1996; 270: H476-H484PubMed Google Scholar) that MCTs have affinity for several substituted monocarboxylates in addition tol-lactate and H+ (or OHâ). To test for monocarboxylates that might share the H+/lactate cotransporter (or its equivalent, a OHâ/lactate exchanger), we measured l-[14C]lactate uptake in BLMVs in the presence of outwardly directed gradients of various substituted and unsubstituted monocarboxylates (transstimulation). These experiments were conducted at pH 7.8 under non-pH gradient conditions using vesicles equilibrated with a highly buffered medium. To further minimize possible alkalinization of the intravesicular space, a valinomycin/FCCP pH clamp was used. As shown in Fig.4, the uptake ofl-[14C]lactate in BLMVs was stimulated 183 Â± 14% by prior incubation with unlabeledl-lactate (lactate self-exchange) compared with the gluconate non-gradient control, whereas d-lactate stimulated l-[14C]lactate uptake by only 53 Â± 8%. Because d-lactate is not available as a sodium salt, these experiments were performed using eitherl-lactate as a lithium or sodium salt. The results were identical; thus, the two sets of data were averaged. Prior loading of BLMVs with other Î±-substituted anions (pyruvate and Î±-hydroxybutyrate) and with Î²-hydroxybutyrate also significantly stimulated the uptake of l-[14C]lactate. In contrast, we detected only marginal transstimulation with formate. The other unsubstituted anions tested (acetate, propionate, and butyrate) stimulated the uptake of l-[14C]lactate, but the stimulation decreased progressively as the carbon chain length increased from C2 to C4. Because of the absence of lactate/H+ cotransport in LMVs, we next considered whether an anion-exchange pathway for lactate may represent an alternative transport system in these membranes. We tested this hypothesis in two ways. In the first approach, we compared the effects of outwardly directed l-and d-lactate gradients on the initial rates ofl-[14C]lactate uptake (transstimulation). As shown in Fig. 5, the uptake ofl-[14C]lactate was stimulated nearly 100% by prior incubation of LMVs with unlabeled l-lactate (l-lactate self-exchange) compared with the gluconate non-gradient control, but by only 30% with the d-isomer. Because these experiments were conducted under non-pH gradient conditions using a valinomycin/FCCP pH clamp and because l- and d-lactate are stereoisomers with similar physical properties, stimulation of l-[14C]lactate uptake by an outward l-lactate gradient must be direct rather than secondary to alterations in pHi and/or transmembrane potential. In the second approach, we examined the possible effects of some anion transport blockers onl-lactate self-exchange. As shown in Fig.6,l-[14C]lactate uptake was markedly inhibited by DIDS and CHC and almost completely by furosemide. These findings are therefore consistent with the presence of an anion-exchange pathway forl-lactate in LMVs.Figure 6Effect of inhibitors on l-lactate gradient-stimulated l-[14C]lactate uptake in LMVs. LMVs were equilibrated and incubated under the conditions described in the legend to Fig. 4. DIDS was added as the disodium salt, and sodium gluconate was added as appropriate to maintain the Na+ concentration constant. In all conditions, the final concentration of l-[14C]lactate in the incubation buffer was 0.3 mm. *, p < 0.01 by ANOVA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next investigated whether additional mechanisms of lactate transport were present in BLMVs and LMVs. Because the rat MTAL possesses both luminal and basolateral Na+-independent Clâ/HCO3â exchangers (19Eladari D. Blanchard A. Leviel F. Paillard M. Stuart-Tilley A.K. Alper S.L. Podevin R.-A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F334-F342PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the effect of outwardly directed lactate gradients on36Clâ uptake under conditions in which the vesicles were voltage- and pH-clamped. As indicated in Fig.7, imposing an outward Clâgradient stimulated by â¼600% the rates of36Clâ influx in both BLMVs and LMVs compared with their respective gluconate non-gradient controls, confirming the presence Clâ/HCO3âexchangers operating on the Clâ/36Clâ exchange mode in both preparations. In contrast, imposing an outward lactate gradient had no significant effect on 36Clâ uptake in BLMVs and LMVs. Taken together, these results demonstrate thatl-lactate is not a substrate for the BLMV and LMV Clâ/HCO3â exchangers. We also examined whether lactate could be cotransported with Na+ across the basolateral and luminal membranes. As illustrated in Fig. 8, for both preparations, the uptake of l-[14C]lactate in the presence of TMA+, used as a substitute for Na+, slowly approached equilibrium. Imposing an inward Na+ gradient caused no significant additional uptake ofl-[14C]lactate at the p < 0.05 level for incubation periods of 0.5, 1, and 3 min and failed to induce an overshoot of this anion. Thus, these data argue against the existence of direct coupling between the flux of Na+ and the flux of l-[14C]lactate (i.e.no Na+/lactate cotransport) in both BLMVs and LMVs. Five independent preparations of BLMVs and LMVs were assessed by immunoblotting for the presence of MCT1 and MCT2 polypeptides. As shown in Fig. 9 A, the affinity-purified anti-MCT2 peptide antibody recognized a 37-kDa protein that was enriched in basolateral membranes (B) compared with luminal membranes (L). In contrast, MCT1 could not be detected neither in BLMV nor in LMV preparations isolated from rat MTALs (Fig. 9 A). In immunoblotting performed with apical and basolateral membrane-enriched preparations from rat renal cortex, anti-MCT2 and anti-MCT1 antibodies recognized proteins with molecular masses of 37 and 41 kDa, respectively, in basolateral, but not in apical, membrane preparations. Labeling was blocked by the specific immunizing peptides (data not shown). Blots were also probed with an antibody to the Na+/K+-ATPase or with an antibody against the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3 (Fig. 9 B), which serve as markers for basolateral and apical membranes, respectively. Anti-NHE3 antibody reacted with a 85-kDa protein that was enriched in luminal membranes compared with basolateral membranes. Conversely, the Na+/K+-ATPase Î²-subunit identified as a 50-kDa protein was enriched in basolateral membranes and completely absent from luminal membranes. These results confirm the view (11Attmane-Elakeb A. Chambrey R. Tsimaratos M. Leviel F. Blanchard A. Warnock D.G. Paillard M. Podevin R.-A.

Physiol. 1998; 275: F334-F342PubMed Google Scholar) that basolateral and luminal membranes isolated from rat MTALs are largely separated from each other. Fig. 10 shows the localization of MCT2 in the inner stripe of the outer medulla of the rat kidney using indirect immunofluorescence on sections of paraformaldehyde-fixed kidney embedded in paraffin. Anti-MCT2 antibody binds intensely to thick ascending limbs and, to a lesser extent, to collecting ducts. When anti-MCT2 peptide antibody was incubated with the specific peptide antigen before application to a section, no binding of anti-MCT2 antibody was observed (data not shown). To confirm the polarized expression of MCT2 in thick ascending limbs, we performed dual labeling indirect immunofluorescence for MCT2 and the apical NHE3 protein. In the inner stripe of the outer medulla, only the apical membrane of the MTAL showed intense staining for NHE3. Anti-MCT2 antibody (Fig. 10 A) labeled the same tubules more intensely than did anti-NHE3 antibody (Fig. 10 B). However, all labeling of MCT2 did not spatially colocalize with that of NHE3 (Fig.10 C), indicating that MCT2 expression is restricted to the basolateral domain. This study provides the first description, at both the functional and molecular levels, of distinct monocarboxylate transporters at the basolateral and luminal surfaces of rat MTALs. In this report, we found evidence compatible with the presence of a member of the MCT family in the basolateral membranes isolated from rat MTALs. First, an inside alkaline pH gradient induced uphilll-[14C]lactate accumulation (overshoot). Second, the pH gradient-stimulated transport ofl-[14C]lactate was inhibited by CHC as well as by less specific anion transport blockers such as furosemide and DIDS. Third, l-[14C]lactate uptake was markedly transstimulated by prior equilibration of the vesicles withl-lactate, but only marginally with d-lactate. Fourth, the MCT2 isoform was shown by immunochemical methods to be expressed exclusively on the basolateral membranes of the MTAL, whereas MCT1 could not detected in this nephron segment. In marked contrast, we found that l-lactate cannot be transported across the luminal membrane in exchange for OHâ (i.e. no lactate/OHâ exchange or H+/lactate cotransport), but have detected the presence of a carrier-mediated system for lactate transport in these membranes. This conclusion is based on the following findings. First, the pH gradient-stimulated transport ofl-[14C]lactate is completely resistant to inhibition by anion transport blockers, suggesting that nonionic diffusion of lactic acid is the mechanism underlying pH gradient-stimulated lactate uptake. Second, under non-pH gradient conditions, l-[14C]lactate uptake is markedly transstimulated by prior equilibration of the vesicles withl-lactate, but only marginally with d-lactate. Third, l-lactate self-exchange is sensitive to inhibition by anion transport blockers such as DIDS, CHC, and furosemide. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy using antibodies to MCT1 and MCT2 revealed the presence of MCT2 at the basolateral surfaces of the MTAL, whereas MCT1 could not be detected in this nephron segment (Fig.10). We also found that the antibody to MCT2 detected a band of 37 kDa on immunoblots of BLMVs isolated from rat MTALs, whereas this band was barely detectable on LMVs (Fig. 9). This apparent molecular mass of MCT2 on SDS-polyacrylamide gels is close to the value of 43 kDa reported by others on immunoblots from membranes of various hamster tissues (4Garcia C.K. Brown M.S. Pathak R.K. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1843-1849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In agreement with our immunofluorescence microscopy experiments, Western blotting using the antibody to MCT1 showed no evidence for the presence of this isoform in both BLMVs and LMVs (Fig.9). As a positive control, we found that the antibody to MCT1 detected a band of 41 kDa on immunoblots of basolateral membranes isolated from rat kidney cortex (Fig. 9). In apparent contrast with our data, previous immunofluorescent studies (4Garcia C.K. Brown M.S. Pathak R.K. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1843-1849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) have shown expression of MCT2 restricted to the basolateral surfaces of the inner medullary collecting ducts of the hamster kidney. Using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, we have detected MCT2 not only at the basolateral surfaces of the MTAL (Fig. 10), but also at the basolateral domains of the inner medullary collecting ducts, cortical medullary thick ascending limbs, and distal convoluting tubules. 2D. Eladari, R. Chambrey, T. Irinopoulou, F. Leviel, F. Pezy, P. Bruneval, M. Paillard, and R.-A. Podevin, unpublished results. These differences between the results of Garcia et al. (4Garcia C.K. Brown M.S. Pathak R.K. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1843-1849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) and those reported here for the localization of the MCT2 isoform in rat kidneys are not surprising. Indeed, as recently pointed out in detail by Jacksonet al. (7Jackson V.N. Price N.T. Carpenter L. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), there are markedly different patterns of expression of MCT1 and MCT2 in hamster and rat tissues. For example, Garcia et al. (4Garcia C.K. Brown M.S. Pathak R.K. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1843-1849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) found MCT2 to be abundant in hamster heart, but not brain, whereas the opposite was found by Jacksonet al. (7Jackson V.N. Price N.T. Carpenter L. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) in membrane fractions prepared from rat heart and brain. The intense expression of the MCT2 polypeptide in the basolateral membranes of rat MTALs, as demonstrated here by immunochemical methods (Figs. 9 and 10), completely matches the robust functional expression of the H+/monocarboxylate cotransporter (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). Conversely, the absence of MCT1 and MCT2 immunoreactivities in the luminal membranes of rat MTALs (Figs. 9 and 10) is consistent with our functional data demonstrating that carrier-mediated lactate transport in these membranes (Figs. 5 and 6) does not occur via operation of a H+/monocarboxylate cotransporter (Fig. 3). Transstimulation experiments were used to investigate the substrate specificity of the BLMV H+/lactate cotransporter (Fig. 4). These studies were performed using vesicles equilibrated in a highly buffered medium and in the presence of FCCP and valinomycin. It is therefore highly unlikely that the organic acids tested caused stimulation indirectly, i.e. either by alkalinizing the intravesicular space via non-ionic diffusion and/or by generating an interior positive. Consistent with this possibility is the observation that l-lactate was more than three times as potent as thed-isomer in stimulatingl-[14C]lactate uptake (Fig. 4). The BLMV H+/lactate cotransporter (MCT2) is stereospecific and exhibits a broad specificity for monocarboxylates, as expected for an MCT isoform (9Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C761-C782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). l-Lactate and other Î±-substituted anions (pyruvate and Î±-hydroxybutyrate) are the best substrates. The possible importance of the 2-OH group in substrate recognition is suggested by the observations that butyrate has no affinity for the transporter and that Î²-hydroxybutyrate is significantly less effective than Î±-hydroxybutyrate in stimulatingl-[14C]lactate uptake. Since it is generally accepted that the proximal tubule depletes the tubular fluid in organic solutes and since MCT2 is restricted to the basolateral membrane of the MTAL (Figs. 9 and 10), it is likely that this isoform may play a major role in the uptake of lactate and other monocarboxylates. Consistent with this view, microperfusion studies indicated that lactate was effective to support Na+transport only on the basolateral side of the cortical thick ascending limb (20Wittner M. Weidtke C. Schlatter E. di Stefano A. Greger R. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1984; 402: 52-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), a nephron segment that exhibits a substrate preference comparable to that of the MTAL. The relatively high lactate concentration (10 mm) observed in rat medulla (21Scaglione P.R. Dell R.B. Winters R.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1965; 209: 1193-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) probably maintains an inward lactate gradient sufficient to override the outward H+ gradient. The possibility exists, however, that MCT2 can mediate net lactate transport in either direction, depending on the physiological status and thus the actual driving forces. Under anoxic conditions, there is an increase in lactic acid production in all distal segments, and the maximum increase was observed in the MTAL (2Bagnasco S. Good D. Balaban R. Burg M. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: F522-F526PubMed Google Scholar), a situation that may be associated with marked intracellular acidification, which may damage the MTAL (2Bagnasco S. Good D. Balaban R. Burg M. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: F522-F526PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a large thermodynamic driving force favoring net efflux of glycolytically derived lactic acid via MCT2 and via non-ionic diffusion is expected. The MTAL is particularly sensitive to anoxic damage because of the low medullary PO2 in the range of 10â20 mm Hg and the high rate of active NaCl transport (22Brezis M. Rosen S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Thus, under anoxic conditions, stimulation of MCT2 activity may contribute to limit intracellular acidification by increasing efflux of glycolytically derived lactic acid. The resultant lactic acid accumulation in the medullary interstitium probably acidifies the interstitial fluid, which may stimulate H+ secretion in the adjacent collecting duct. Moreover, under normal conditions, lactic acid secretion in the tubular fluid across the luminal membrane via non-ionic diffusion is expected because there is no lactate in the lumen, and so, at least theoretically, there is a large gradient for lactate exit, and because pHi (23Watts B.A. Good D.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 917-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) is markedly lower than the pH of the tubular fluid (6.6 versus 7.4) (24DuBose T.D.J. Lucci M.S. Hogg R.J. Pucacco L.R. Kokko J.P. Carter N.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 244: F497-F503PubMed Google Scholar). The transport studies reported here on the luminal membrane vesicles are preliminary and were designed to detect the presence in these vesicles of an organic anion transporter, distinct from the monocarboxylate transporters of the MCT family. Clearly, evaluation of the physiological role of this new H+-independent organic anion exchanger, demonstrated here, requires additional studies. With the exception of HCO3â, which is known to be present at a non-negligible concentration (â¼20 mm) in the tubular fluid of the rat MTAL (24DuBose T.D.J. Lucci M.S. Hogg R.J. Pucacco L.R. Kokko J.P. Carter N.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 244: F497-F503PubMed Google Scholar), little information has been available concerning the concentrations of other anions that might be substrates for the newly described LMV anion exchanger. Regarding HCO3â, however, we have found, in experiments not illustrated, that this anion is not a substrate for the LMV organic anion transporter (i.e. no lactate/HCO3â exchange). Recently, we have also demonstrated that the BLMV H+/monocarboxylate cotransporter has no affinity for HCO3â(25Leviel F. Eladari D. Blanchard A. Poumarat J.S. Paillard M. Podevin R.-A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F847-F856PubMed Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have demonstrated the existence of distinct monocarboxylate transporters in basolateral and luminal plasma membranes isolated from rat MTALs. The results of our immunolocalization studies demonstrate that the basolateral transport system is the H+/monocarboxylate cotransporter MCT2 isoform. Under normal conditions, MCT2 may be of special importance in mediating the active uptake of l-lactate and of other substituted monocarboxylates of physiological interest. Under hypoxic conditions, MCT2 may limit the degree of intracellular acidification, potentially damaging for the MTAL, by extruding glycolytically derived lactic acid into the medullary interstitium. On the other hand, the luminal anion exchanger identified in this report has not been characterized molecularly, and its physiological function remains to be evaluated."

These complex ligand/receptor interactions indicate that ErbB, EGF, and neuregulin proteins are most appropriately viewed as components of an intricate, highly regulated signaling network. The EC region of EGFR and other ErbB receptors is divided into four subdomains. Subdomain I corresponds to the N terminus, whereas subdomain III is flanked by subdomains II and IV, the cysteine-rich repeats. Evidence to date indicates that EGFR subdomains I and especially III are the major determinants of ligand binding (21Ullrich A. Schlessinger J.

Biophys. 1995; 322: 378-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) have markedly lower affinity for EGF and TGF-Î±. Additionally, substitution of subdomain III of chicken EGFR with that of human EGFR restores high affinity binding toward murine EGF, characteristic of the human receptor (24Lax I. Bellot F. Howk R.

Chem. 1999; 274: 574-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Despite their apparent importance, EC domain sequences mediating receptor dimerization have not been well defined. Moreover, the manner in which binding of various ligands differentially regulates ErbB receptor dimerization or underlies ligand-specific differences in bioactivity is also unclear. To further define sequence motifs in the EGFR EC domain that are involved in ligand binding and/or receptor dimerization, we performed site-directed mutagenesis. In contrast to most previous studies that manipulated soluble truncated receptor forms corresponding to the EC domain, we utilized full-length EGFR and extended the analyses to examine HER2/Neu transphosphorylation. Our initial focus was the potential role of EGFR subdomain IV sequences in receptor homo- and heterodimerization. However, we were surprised to find that a small cluster of mutations in subdomain IV dramatically impaired the binding of several EGFR ligands. Additionally, mutation of other subdomain IV clusters also reduced ligand binding to 30â40% of control. Our results thus unexpectedly implicated this portion of the extracellular domain in ligand/receptor interactions. All restriction and modification enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA) unless otherwise noted. R408 was from Promega (Madison, WI). Full-length human EGFR cDNA, kindly provided by Dr. Glenn Merlino (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), was subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) to generate pc3-EGFR. The latter vector was used for both mutagenesis and expression. Charged-to-alanine mutagenesis (36Bass S.H. Mulkerrin M.G. Wells J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To delete nucleotides 1810â2025 of subdomain IV, a NaeI restriction site (nucleotide 2025) was converted to an EcoNI site using the primer prÎNaeI (5â²-TGGATGGCACAGGTGGCACACCTGAGCGAGGTCTGCGTACTTCCAGACCTACTTCCAGACCAG-3â²). All annealing reactions also included a primer designed to eliminate a unique BstBI restriction site present in the vector sequence (38Briley G.P. Hissong M.A. Chiu M.L. Lee D.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1619-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), thus allowing for elimination of WT templates. Second-strand synthesis products were passaged through BMH cells (Promega) to inactivate the uracil templates, andBstBI-resistant DNAs were amplified in DH5Î± cells (Life Technologies, Inc.). The authenticity of wild-type or mutant sequences was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA), cultured as described previously (38Briley G.P. Hissong M.A. Chiu M.L. Lee D.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1619-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), were transfected with EGFR expression vectors using Dosper reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.)-resistant clones were screened for surface expression of wild-type or mutant receptor proteins using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a mixture of monoclonal antibodies specific for the EC domain. Briefly, clones grown on gelatin-coated microtiter plates were washed with PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+, fixed in 2% Formalin and 0.04% glutaraldehyde for 5 min, washed with PBS/Ca2+/Mg2+, and blocked in 3% BSA/PBS for 1 h. Fixed cells were then incubated for 2 h with anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (mAb) 1 + mAb 3 (Lab Vision Corp., Fremont, CA) at 1:250 in 3% BSA/PBS. Plates were washed, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 1:2000 for 1 h, washed again, and incubated with substrate solution. A405 nm values, measured with a microplate reader, were normalized for cell density determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA). Results were confirmed by Western blotting. For some experiments, CHO cell clones were transiently transfected with 100 ng of the full-length human HER2 cDNA expression vector pLXSN-Neu (kindly provided by Dr. David Stern, Yale University) (39Riese D.J., II van Raaij T.M. Plowman G.D. Andrews G.C. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5770-5776Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). To detect total EGFR, subconfluent cells (60-mm dishes) were washed with PBS and lysed in 500 Î¼l of Triton X-100 lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mmEGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 Î¼m sodium molybdate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, and 10 Î¼g/ml aprotinin). Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm, and supernatant protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Samples (120â200 Î¼g) were immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with anti-EGFR antibody ERCT (a gift from Dr. H. Shelton Earp, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC) as described previously (40Schroeder J.A. Lee D.C. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 451-464PubMed Google Scholar). To detect cell-surface EGFR, live cells were incubated with 5 Î¼g/ml EC domain-specific mAb 1 + mAb 3 or mAb 11 (Lab Vision Corp.) for 2 h in 3% BSA/PBS/Ca2+/Mg2+ at 4 Â°C. Washed cells were harvested in Triton X-100 lysis buffer and centrifuged. Immunoprecipitates were collected with protein G-agarose beads prior to Western blot analysis. Subconfluent cells were serum-starved for 16â24 h in nonessential amino acids-supplemented DMEM and stimulated for 2 min with human recombinant EGF (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), TGF-Î±, or HB-EGF (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Cells were washed with PBS and lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer, and EGFR was immunoprecipitated by incubating 350â500 Î¼g of protein sequentially with ERCT antibody and protein G-agarose. Immune complexes were boiled in 100 Î¼l of 2Ã SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer, and samples were resolved on duplicate gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with either 5% milk or 3% BSA in Tris-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20 and probed with ERCT antibody or anti-phosphotyrosine antibody RC20 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), respectively. Cells transiently transfected with pLXSN-Neu were serum-starved 36 h after LipofectAMINE treatment and 12â16 h later stimulated with 20 ng/ml EGF for 2 min. Receptors were immunoprecipitated with either ERCT antibody or 5 Î¼g/ml anti-HER2/Neu mAb 1 as described above. Immune complexes were boiled in 30 Î¼l of 2Ã SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting using RC20 antibody. Blots were then stripped in 5 mm glycine and 15 mm HCl (40Schroeder J.A. Lee D.C. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 451-464PubMed Google Scholar); washed with Tris-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20; and blotted with anti-EGFR antibody 1005 or anti-HER2/Neu antibody C-18 (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. Subconfluent cells in 12-well plates were incubated in triplicate with 15 Î¼Ci/ml (20 ng/ml)125I-EGF (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Irvine, CA) in DMEM, 0.1% BSA, and 20 mm HEPES (DMEM/BSA/HEPES) for 2 h at 4 Â°C. Duplicate wells were incubated with a 1000â2000-fold excess of unlabeled EGF to measure nonspecific binding. Wells were washed three times with PBS and solubilized in 0.5 ml of 1 n NaOH, and equal portions were used to measure bound radioactivity and protein concentration. Protein was trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, resuspended in 12.5 Î¼l of 1 n NaOH, neutralized with 12.5 Î¼l of 1 n HCl, and assayed. To correct for cell-surface receptor expression, duplicate plates were also incubated with 5 Î¼g/ml anti-EGFR mAb 1 + mAb 3 or mAb 11 in DMEM/BSA/HEPES for 2 h at 4 Â°C. They were then washed, and 0.5 Î¼Ci/well125I-protein A (ICN Pharmaceuticals) was added for 1 h. Some wells were incubated without antibody to correct for nonspecific binding of protein A. Cells were washed and processed for radioactive counting and protein determination as described above. Subconfluent cells grown in 100-mm dishes were serum-starved, incubated with or without 200 ng/ml EGF in DMEM/BSA/HEPES for 2 h at 4 Â°C, washed, and incubated with 5 mm bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (Pierce) for 2 h at 4 Â°C. Cross-linking was quenched by incubation in 20 mmTris (pH 7.5) for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were washed, harvested in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, and 1% sodium deoxycholate with 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 Î¼m sodium molybdate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, and 10 Î¼g/ml aprotinin), and centrifuged to remove debris. Lysate samples (500â800 Î¼g) in 1 ml of buffer were immunoprecipitated with ERCT antibody for 5 h at 4 Â°C, with protein G-agarose beads added during the last 2 h. Immune complexes were washed as described (41Kashles O. Yarden Y. Fischer R. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1454-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), resolved on 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked and probed for EGFR monomers and dimers using ERCT antibody. We replaced selected clusters of charged or aromatic amino acids with alanine residues throughout the EC region, focusing particularly on sequences previously implicated in ligand binding or exhibiting significant homology among ErbB family members. For each of â¼20 clusters, 3â5 charged or aromatic residues were simultaneously replaced with alanine in a full-length human EGFR cDNA using the method of Kunkel (42Kunkle T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar). Cytomegalovirus-directed expression vectors containing mutant or WT EGFR proteins or no insert were then transfected into CHO cells, and Geneticin-resistant colonies were selected. Colonies were screened for cell-surface receptor expression via an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a mixture of mAb 1 + mAb 3 monoclonal antibodies, specific for the EGFR extracellular domain. Cell-surface expression of mutant EGFR proteins containing alanine substitutions in subdomains IâIII was low to undetectable by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Similarly, Harte and Gentry (23Harte M.T. Gentry L.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 378-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) reported that soluble receptors containing insertional mutations in subdomain III are not efficiently secreted and that insertions in other subdomains markedly reduce receptor expression. Hence, we focused on six subdomain IV mutants (Fig. 1) that were readily detected on the cell surface (see below). In mt23, Arg-497 was mutated to alanine; spontaneous mutation of this residue to lysine in a carcinoma cell line results in reduced binding of TGF-Î± (43Moriai T. Kobrin M.S. Hope C. Speck L. Korc M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10217-10221Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). With mt24âmt27, clusters of 3â5 amino acids spanning EGFR residues 507â589 were, in each case, replaced with alanine. The ÎEN mutant contained an in-frame deletion of amino acids 518â589 that encompassed mt25âmt27 (Fig. 1). A subdomain IV deletion mutant lacking adjacent upstream sequence (amino acids 495â519) was not detectably expressed. Additionally, a mutant containing several alanine substitutions surrounding Arg-497 was also not detectably expressed. Fig.2 shows Western blot analysis of representative CHO cell clones expressing WT EGFR or EGFR subdomain IV mutants. Total EGFR was detected by blotting immunoprecipitated receptor with an antibody (ERCT) directed against its C-terminal sequences. Cell-surface EGFR was identified by incubating live cells with monoclonal antibodies to the receptor's EC domain (mAb 1 + mAb 3 or mAb 11). Cells were then lysed, and protein G-agarose-precipitated immune complexes were blotted with ERCT antibody. As expected, WT EGFR was predominantly detected as a diffuse band of â¼170 kDa corresponding to fully glycosylated, surface-localized EGFR (Fig. 2, upper panel). Mutant EGFR proteins were instead typically present in two forms: the broad 170-kDa band and a discrete band of 160 kDa that likely corresponds to nascent EGFR still retained in intracellular membranes (44Soderquist A.M. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12586-12594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Mayes E.L. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The ratio of 170/160-kDa forms varied with different mutants and was highest in the case of the single-point mutant mt23. The deletion mutant ÎEN was predictably smaller and detected as both diffuse 160- and discrete 120-kDa bands. For all mutants, similar receptor profiles were detected using multiple cell clones and an alternative anti-C terminus antibody. Incubation of live cells with either mAb 1 + mAb 3 or mAb 11 confirmed cell-surface localization of the diffuse 170- or 160-kDa (ÎEN) receptor bands. The latter analyses confirmed roughly comparable cell-surface expression of wild-type and mutant EGFR proteins. To assess whether subdomain IV mutations affected EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, serum-starved cells were stimulated for 2 min with 10 ng/ml EGF. EGFR proteins were then immunoprecipitated with ERCT antibody and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody RC20. To compare the levels of the various EGFR proteins, blots were reprobed (or in some cases, parallel blots were probed) with anti-receptor antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3 (upper panel), EGF treatment rapidly induced tyrosine phosphorylation of WT EGFR as well as the 170-kDa surface form of mt23, mt24, mt26, and mt27. Interestingly, basal phosphorylation of mt24 was observed in the absence of EGF, but was not seen with the WT receptor. Most striking, however, were the complete absence of EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of mt25 and the greatly reduced phosphorylation of ÎEN. Focusing on selected mutants, we examined tyrosine phosphorylation in response to a higher dose of EGF (100 ng/ml), and we examined the effects of equivalent concentrations of TGF-Î± or HB-EGF (all human recombinant) as well. Fig. 4 shows that all three human ligands induced a marked increase in the phosphotyrosine content of WT, mt24, and mt27 receptor proteins, with HB-EGF and TGF-Î± eliciting the strongest and weakest responses, respectively. In contrast, ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of mt26 and especially mt25 was dramatically reduced. Even at this high dose, mt25 was only weakly phosphorylated in response to HB-EGF and EGF and was unresponsive to TGF-Î±. The lack of induced tyrosine phosphorylation of mt25 could result from impaired binding of ligand to"

In Jurkat T cells, a major 68-kDa band and a minor 70-kDa band were immunoprecipitated by a monoclonal antibody against the SHP-1 protein-tyrosine phosphatase domain, while an antibody against the SHP-1 C-terminal 19 amino acids recognized only the 68-kDa SHP-1. The SDS-gel-purified 70-kDa protein was subjected to tryptic mapping and microsequencing, which was followed by molecular cloning. It revealed that the 70-kDa protein, termed SHP-1L, is a C-terminal alternatively spliced form of SHP-1. SHP-1L is 29 amino acids longer than SHP-1, and its 66 C-terminal amino acids are different from SHP-1. The C terminus of SHP-1L contains a proline-rich motif PVPGPPVLSP, a potential Src homology 3 domain-binding site. In contrast to SHP-1, tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-1L is not detected upon stimulation in Jurkat T cells. This is apparently due to the lack of a single in vivo tyrosine phosphorylation site, which only exists in the C terminus of SHP-1 (Y564). COS cell-expressed glutathione S-transferase-SHP-1L can dephosphorylate tyrosine-phosphorylated ZAP70. At pH 7.4, SHP-1L was shown to be more active than SHP-1 in the dephosphorylation of ZAP70.

These mice suffer from chronic macrophage and neutrophil activation, and abnormal B cell development, as well as T and B cell depletion and dysfunction. In me/me mice, hematopoietic cells hyper-proliferate in response to growth factor stimulation, which results in the enormous overexpansion of multiple hematopoietic cell lineages. The elevated proliferation and accumulation of myeloid cells appears to be responsible for the early death of theme/me mice (6Neel B.G. Semin.

These interactions appear to exert primarily inhibitory effects on their signaling cascades (35Lorenz U. Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9624-9629Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Jurkat T cells expressing a dominant negative SHP-1 (C453S) have increased tyrosine phosphorylation upon TCR stimulation (16Plas D.R. Johnson R. Pingel J.T. Matthews R.J. Dalton M. Roy G. Chan A.C. Thomas M.L. Science. 1996; 272: 1173-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Also in Jurkat T cells, T cell receptor cross-linking or pervanadate treatment induced the association of SHP-1 with ZAP70 kinase, resulting in the decrease of ZAP70 kinase activity. Co-expression of SHP-1 with ZAP70 in Sf9 cells also resulted in a dephosphorylation of ZAP70 (17Raab M. Rudd C.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The structures of SHP-1 and SHP-2 are similar (37Hof P. Pluskey S. Dhe-Paganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 441-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 38Yang J. Liang X. Niu T. Meng W. Zhao Z. Zhou G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28199-28207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The catalytic domains are conserved in all PTPs. The tandem N-SH2 and C-SH2 domains of SHP-1 and SHP-2 provide the docking sites for phosphorylated tyrosine residues. Several reports have shown that a truncation of 35â49 amino acids from the C terminus of SHP-1 dramatically increases its catalytic activity by 20â40-fold (39Zhao Z. Bouchard P. Diltz C.D. Shen S.H. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2816-2820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Pei D. Lorenz U. Klingmuller U. Neel B.G. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15483-15493Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Interestingly, truncation of 60 amino acids from the C terminus of SHP-1 had no affect on SHP-1 catalytic activity. It has been hypothesized that the entire C-terminal domain of SHP-1 contains two regions with the N-region 50 amino acid residues being critical for the activation of SHP-1, which is blocked by the C-region 30â40 residues. On the other hand, the catalytic activity of SHP-1 and SHP-2 is known to be negatively regulated through an intramolecular interaction between the SH2 domain(s) and catalytic domain (37Hof P. Pluskey S. Dhe-Paganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 441-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 38Yang J. Liang X. Niu T. Meng W. Zhao Z. Zhou G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28199-28207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the engagement of the SH2 domain with an exogenous phosphotyrosyl peptide or truncation of the SH2 domain(s) activates SHP-1 and SHP-2 (40Pei D. Lorenz U. Klingmuller U. Neel B.G. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15483-15493Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 41Lechleider R.J. Sugimoto S. Bennett A.M. Kashishian A.S. Cooper J.A. Shoelson S.E. Walsh C.T.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13414-13418Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that the catalytic activity of SHP-1 displays a distinctive pH dependence (40Pei D. Lorenz U. Klingmuller U. Neel B.G. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15483-15493Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli-expressed SHP-1 is nearly inactive at pH 7.4 as determined in vitrousing PNPP as a substrate, but is active at pH 5.4 (40Pei D. Lorenz U. Klingmuller U. Neel B.G. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15483-15493Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This suggests that a more open conformation of p-nitrophenyl phosphate SHP-1 may be formed at pH 5.4. The recently published crystal structure of the catalytic domain of SHP-1 suggests that SHP-1 needs to change from the half-open conformation to the open conformation before it can bind substrates (38Yang J. Liang X. Niu T. Meng W. Zhao Z. Zhou G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28199-28207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The full-length SHP-2 crystal structure reveals a âclosedâ domain arrangement in which the two SH2 domains contour around the catalytic domain with the N-terminal domain directly blocking the active site (37Hof P. Pluskey S. Dhe-Paganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 441-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether the C-terminal tail is involved in the folding of SHP-2, since the crystal structure of SHP-2 is missing 66 amino acids from the C terminus. It has been observed that, when the C-terminal 35 amino acids were truncated, SHP-1 was not further activated by phosphotyrosine peptide engagement. These data suggest that a C-terminal truncation alone is sufficient to activate the PTPs (40Pei D. Lorenz U. Klingmuller U. Neel B.G. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15483-15493Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In this report, we described the identification of SHP-1L, a splice isoform of SHP-1. SHP-1L contains a distinctive C terminus of 66 amino acid residues and exhibits a high catalytic activity at physiological pH. Thus, we suggest that this isoform may, unlike SHP-1, function in resting cells. The Jurkat T cell line J77, a variant of clone E6â1 (ATCC) was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium, and COS cells were cultured in minimal essential medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 Â°C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Anti-phosphotyrosine (RC20), anti-SHP-1-PTP domain mAb, anti-SHP-2 mAb, and anti-ZAP70 mAb were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-SHP-1 C-terminal 19 AA, an anti-SHP-1 polyclonal antibody raised to the 19 C-terminal amino acid, was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). When not specified, the mAb against the SHP-1 PTP domain was used. Anti-CD3 antibody (OKT3) was prepared from a hybridoma obtained from the ATCC. Jurkat T cells (2 Ã 107) were washed and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. For CD3 stimulation, cells were incubated with OKT3 (2 Î¼g/ml) for 5 min on ice, cross-linked by rabbit anti-mouse IgG (5 Î¼g/ml) on ice for another 5 min, then incubated at 37 Â°C for 3 min. For pervanadate stimulation, cells were incubated with 1 Î¼mpervanadate at 37 Â°C for 3 min. Pervanadate was prepared by mixing 20 Î¼l of 1 m vanadate with 11 Î¼l of 30% H2O2 and 69 Î¼l of double-distilled H2O, which was incubated at room temperature for 15 min before use. After washing with PBS, cells were lysed in 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm PMSF, 1 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 2 Î¼g/ml antipain) at 4 Â°C for 30 min. The Nonidet P-40 lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 Ã g for 15 min at 4 Â°C. Immunoprecipitations were carried out at 4 Â°C overnight or at room temperature for 4 h with protein A-Sepharose beads. The beads were washed twice with 0.1% Triton X-100/TBS and once with TBS. Proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling for 5 min in 50 Î¼l of Laemmli reducing SDS sample buffer. Proteins from about 107 cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membrane were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin/TBST and incubated with antibodies in TBST for 2 h at room temperature. Following four 15-min washes with TBST, the membranes were incubated with second antibody for 30 min, washed three times for 5 min each with TBST, and developed by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After washing in PBS, Jurkat cells (2 Ã 108) were incubated in 2 ml of hypotonic buffer (42 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2) for 15 min at 4 Â°C. The cells were passed through a 30-gauge needle 10 times. The extract was centrifuged at 250 Ã g for 10 min to remove the nuclei and intact cells. The postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 150,000 Ã g for 30 min at 4 Â°C to separate the cytoplasm from the membrane fraction. Pellets from 10 liters of Jurkat T cell culture were lysed in 50 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. After centrifugation, the supernatants were mixed with 5 ml of ThioBond resin (PAO-agarose) pretreated according to manufacturer's instruction (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The mixture was incubated at 4 Â°C for 1 h, then packed into a mini-column of 20 ml. The affinity resin was then washed with 100 ml of washing buffer (150 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4). Thio-resin-bound protein was eluted with 10 ml of the above buffer containing 200 mmÎ²-mercaptoethanol. Column eluates were dialyzed against TBS three times for 30 min each and adjusted to 0.5% Nonidet P-40. SHP-1 was then immunoprecipitated by adding 100 Î¼l of anti-SHP-1 (Transduction Laboratories), and 200 Î¼l of protein A beads. Immunoprecipitates were separated in 8% SDS-PAGE and briefly stained with Coomassie Blue before excising for microsequencing. All procedures were carried out by the Harvard Microchemistry Facility. After in gel reduction andS-carboxyamidomethylation, the band(s) were subjected to in gel tryptic digestion (Promega) and a single 10% aliquot was analyzed by mass spectrometry. Sequence information was determined by microcapillary (75 Î¼m Ã 10-cm column, packed-in house) reverse-phase chromatography, coupled to the electrospray ionization source of a quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer (Finnigan LC, San Jose, CA). The remainder (90%) of the peptide mixture was separated by microbore high performance liquid chromatography using a Zorbax C18 1.0 mm Ã 150-mm reverse-phase column coupled to a Hewlett-Packard 1090 HPLC/1040 diode array detector. Optimum fractions were chosen based on differential UV absorbance at 205, 277, and 292 nm, peak symmetry, and resolution; then further screened for length and homogeneity by matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Tryptic peptides were submitted for automated Edman degradation on a Perkin Elmer/Applied Biosystems 494A cLC protein sequencer (Foster City, CA). A human Jurkat leukemia T-cell cDNA library from CLONTECH (HL5008b) was screened for SHP-IL cDNA, using the oligonucleotide gcttggagtctagtgcagggaccgtgg as the probe. Filters were hybridized at 52 Â°C in QuikHyb solution (Stratagene), washed twice by 2 Ã SSC, 0.1% SDS, and washed once with 0.2 Ã SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min each at 55 Â°C. From a total of 2 Ã 105 phage plaques, 11 positive clones were obtained. The EcoRI insert was subcloned into pBluescript. Two clones containing 2.2 kilobases of full-length cDNA were submitted for sequencing. To construct GST-SHP-1L and GST-SHP-1 fusion genes, cDNAs encoding SHP-1 and SHP-1L were amplified by PCR withNotI sites in both 3â² and 5â² primers. The PCR products were subcloned in frame into the NotI site of pEBG. The fusion gene structures were then confirmed by sequencing. The pEBG fusion plasmids were transfected into COS cells by using the DEAE/dextran method. Cells were cultured for 48 h before harvest. To isolate the expressed GST fusion proteins, cells were washed with PBS, incubated with hypotonic buffer for 10 min at 4 Â°C, and then removed from the culture dishes. These cells were further lysed by passing through the 30-gauge needle for 10 times. After 30 min of centrifugation at 15,000 Ã g, the supernatants were added to glutathione-Sepharose beads to absorb GST fusion protein. The GST-SHP-1L and GST-SHP-1 proteins were eluted by 20 mmglutathione, dialyzed, concentrated, and quantitated by UV spectrometer. To prepare tyrosine-phosphorylated ZAP70, 200 Ã 106 Jurkat T cells were treated with pervanadate, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with anti-ZAP70 mAb plus protein A beads. ZAP70 kinase/protein A-Sepharose beads were diluted with two volumes of Sepharose beads and divided into aliquots for dephosphorylation assay. To study the kinetics of dephosphorylation, purified GST-SHP-1L or GST-SHP-1 was mixed with ZAP70/protein A beads in 25 Î¼l of pH 7.4 buffer (100 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Î²-mercaptoethanol (BME) or pH 5.4 buffer (100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm BME). The reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of cold TBS. The beads were pelleted and boiled in SDS sample buffer. The results were obtained by anti-Tyr(P) (RC20) immunoblotting. Jurkat T cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with a mAb against the PTP domain of human SHP-1. Two proteins with apparent molecular masses of 68 and 70 kDa were detected upon immunoblotting (Fig.1 A). When similar immunoprecipitations were carried out by using a polyclonal Ab raised against the C-terminal 19 amino acids of human SHP-1, only the major 68-kDa SHP-1 band was detected. This suggested that the 70-kDa protein might differ from the 68-kDa SHP-1 at the C terminus. To purify the 70-kDa protein, we adapted a novel approach using ThioBond resin originally designed for affinity purification of thioredoxin fusion proteins. The resin consists of an agarose-based support to which phenylarsine oxide (PAO) is covalently bound. PAO is a PTP inhibitor, which may oxidize and bind to the thiolate anion of the cysteine residue in the PTP-reactive center, blocking the formation of a phosphoryl-cysteine intermediate, a critical step in dephosphorylation (45Denu J.M. Stuckey J.A. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Cell. 1996; 87: 361-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Based on the x-ray structure of Yersinia PTP co-crystallized with vanadate, a specific PTP inhibitor, the PTP inhibitors are able to covalently bind to the cysteine residue in the PTP-reactive center (46Lorenz U. Ravichandran K.S. Pei D. Walsh C.T. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1824-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To determine whether SH2 containing PTPs will bind to a PAO column, Nonidet P-40 lysates of Jurkat T cells were passed through the PAO column. Column-bound proteins were eluted by BME and analyzed by immunoblotting. Both SHP-1 and the 70-kDa protein were found to be in the column bound protein mixture by anti-SHP-1 immunoblotting (Fig. 1 B). When re-blotted with anti-SHP-2, SHP-2 was determined to migrate slightly slower than the 70-kDa protein (Fig. 1 B). The results indicated that SHP-1, the 70-kDa protein, and SHP-2 all covalently bound to a PAO column and were eluted by BME. The PAO affinity-purified protein mixture was further purified by anti-SHP-1 immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1 C). When the relative amount of 70-kDa protein immunoprecipitated from the T cell lysates (Fig. 1 A) was compared with that immunoprecipitated from the PAO column elutes (Fig. 1 C), it was found that the 70-kDa protein appeared to be enriched by the PAO affinity purification, suggesting that the 70-kDa protein might have a higher affinity than SHP-1 for PAO. The binding of SHP-1 and the 70-kDa protein to PAO was not affected by stimulation of Jurkat T cells via CD3 cross-linking (Fig. 1 C). To determine the intracellular localization of the 70-kDa protein, Jurkat T cells were fractionated into membrane and cytoplasm fractions, lysed, and purified on a PAO column, followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-SHP-1. The results showed that both SHP-1 and the 70-kDa proteins appear predominantly in the cytosol (Fig. 1 D). To isolate the 70-kDa protein, lysates from 10 liters of cultured Jurkat T cells were PAO affinity-purified, then immunoprecipitated with anti-SHP-1. Both the 68-kDa SHP-1 and 70-kDa protein bands were excised from SDS-PAGE and subjected to trypsin digestion. The tryptic peptides were analyzed by HPLC (Fig.2 A). The HPLC profiles from 68-kDa SHP-1 and from the 70-kDa protein appeared to be quite similar, except that several peaks from the 70-kDa protein were distinctive. Similar results were also obtained by mass spectrometry (data not shown). Three peaks from HPLC and two from mass spectrometry were collected and microsequenced (Fig. 2 B). The sequencing results showed that two distinctive peaks from the 70-kDa protein did not match the SHP-1 sequence, whereas the other three peaks from the 70-kDa protein matched different regions of SHP-1 (Fig.3, A and B). These results indicated that the 70-kDa protein shared some common regions with SHP-1 but also contained unique regions not present in SHP-1 molecule. A GenBank search found that the DNA sequence encoding the unique region of the 70-kDa protein is located on human chromosome 12p12-p13 connected to exon 16 of SHP-1 and that the 70-kDa protein is generated by alternatively splicing and a reading frameshift in exon 16 of SHP-1 (Fig. 3, A and B) (2Matthews R.J. Bowne D.B. Flores E. Thomas M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2396-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). We termed the 70-kDa protein SHP-1L, since its molecular mass appears larger than SHP-1.Figure 3A, schematic map of alternative splicing between SHP-1 and SHP-1L.

https://openalex.org/W2056377426,"12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a phorbol ester that is known as a tumor promoter, induces differentiation of myeloid cells and suppresses their proliferation. We studied the regulation of apoptosis by TPA in human monocytic cell line U937 cells that lack p53. Untreated U937 cells constitutively underwent apoptosis, and TPA enhanced apoptosis in these cells. Further studies showed that TPA increased production of tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNFÎ±) in U937 cells, and exogenously added TNFÎ± induced apoptosis. Moreover, the induction of apoptosis by TPA was blocked by anti-TNFÎ± antibody. Similar results were obtained in the myeloblastic cell line KY821 cells. We also found that the induction of apoptosis by TPA was increased in cells overexpressed with TNF receptor 1 but not in control cells. Furthermore, TPA failed to induce the production of TNFÎ± and apoptosis in cells with either their protein kinase C or mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway blocked. Our results indicate that TPA induces apoptosis, at least in part, through a pathway that requires endogenous production of TNFÎ± in U937 cells. Our data also suggest that the induction of apoptosis by TPA occurs through activation of protein kinase C and mitogen-activated protein kinase and TNFÎ± is an autocrine-stimulating factor for the induction of apoptosis in these cells. 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a phorbol ester that is known as a tumor promoter, induces differentiation of myeloid cells and suppresses their proliferation. We studied the regulation of apoptosis by TPA in human monocytic cell line U937 cells that lack p53. Untreated U937 cells constitutively underwent apoptosis, and TPA enhanced apoptosis in these cells. Further studies showed that TPA increased production of tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNFÎ±) in U937 cells, and exogenously added TNFÎ± induced apoptosis. Moreover, the induction of apoptosis by TPA was blocked by anti-TNFÎ± antibody. Similar results were obtained in the myeloblastic cell line KY821 cells. We also found that the induction of apoptosis by TPA was increased in cells overexpressed with TNF receptor 1 but not in control cells. Furthermore, TPA failed to induce the production of TNFÎ± and apoptosis in cells with either their protein kinase C or mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway blocked. Our results indicate that TPA induces apoptosis, at least in part, through a pathway that requires endogenous production of TNFÎ± in U937 cells. Our data also suggest that the induction of apoptosis by TPA occurs through activation of protein kinase C and mitogen-activated protein kinase and TNFÎ± is an autocrine-stimulating factor for the induction of apoptosis in these cells. Apoptosis, a morphologically distinguished form of programmed cell death, plays important roles not only during development and tissue homeostasis but also in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases including cancer, autoimmune disease, viral infection, and neurodegenerative disorder (1Raff M.C.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). Moreover, various chemicals and drugs for treatment of cancers are known to destroy tumor cells through apoptosis (7Eastman A. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1990; 2: 1109-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 8Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Blood. 1993; 81: 151-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The precise mechanisms that control apoptosis have not been elucidated; it appears that this form of cell death is regulated by a genetic program involving both inducers and repressors (6White E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). The tumor suppressor p53 is one of the key proteins affecting the fate of cells exposed to external insults; activation of p53 leads to apoptosis or cell cycle arrest. Inactivation of p53 by either a mutation of the gene or interaction with oncogenic viral or cellular proteins is a common event in the development of malignancies (9Nigro J.M. Baker S.J. Preisinger A.C. Jessup J.M. Hostetter R. Cleary K. Bigner S.H. Davidson N. Baylin S. Devilee P. Glover T. Collins F.S. Weston A. Modali R. Harris C.C. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1989; 342: 705-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (2553) Google Scholar). On the other hand, recent studies have found pathways of apoptosis independent of p53 (10Yonish-Rouach E.

PKC phosphorylates and activates Raf-1, which leads to the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) or extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) (12Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). By contrast, studies have shown that proliferation of cells is also inhibited by PKC activation; phorbol esters that can activate PKC have been shown to inhibit the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product (Rb) (13Sasaguri T. Ishida A. Kosaka C. Nojima H. Ogata J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8345-8351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) is a novel activator of PKC; previous studies (14de Vente J.E.

Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1487-1498PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that TPA induces apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, U937 cells, and Jurkat T-lymphoma cells. TPA is also known to modulate apoptosis induced by various agents (17Jarvis W.D. Povirk L.F. Turner A.J. Traylor R.S. Gewirtz D.A. Pettit G.R. Grant S. Biochem.

Cell Res. 1993; 207: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, the effects of TPA on induction of apoptosis seem to depend upon the type of cells; treatment of cells with inhibitors of PKC resulted in apoptosis in lymphocytes and HL60 cells, and TPA blocked apoptosis induced by VP-16 or interleukin withdrawal (18Walker P.R. Kwast-Welfeld J. Gourdeau H. Leblanc J. Neugebauer W. Sikorska M. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 207: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 19Lucas M. Sanchez-Margalet V. Sanz A. Solano F.

Studies have suggested that this different response to TPA in apoptosis is, in part, due to the existence of multiple PKC isotypes (22Cuvillier O. Rosenthal D.S. Smulson M.E. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2910-2916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 23Mizuno K. Noda K. Araki T. Imaoka T. Kobayashi Y. Akita Y. Shimonaka M. Kishi S. Ohno S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).Tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNFÎ±) is a pleiotropic cytokine that was originally identified on the basis of its ability to induce hemorrhagic necrosis in murine transplantable tumors and of its direct cytotoxic effects against transformed cells lines in vivo (24Carswell E.A. Old L.J. Kassel R.L. Green S. Fiore N. Williamson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3666-3670Crossref PubMed Scopus (3723) Google Scholar, 25Helson L. Helson C. Green S. Exp.

TNFÎ± plays a physiological role in oncogeny and in the control of major inflammatory and immune reactions affecting both myelocytic and nonmyelocytic cells (27Fletcher J.R. Arch. Surg. 1993; 128: 1192-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It is primarily produced by activated macrophages and exerts its effect through two distinct cell surface receptors, denoted TNFR1 and TNFR2. These two TNFÎ± receptors are present on all nucleated cell types (28Hohmann H.P. Remy R. Brockhaus M. van Loon A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14927-14934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Vanhaesebroeck B. Grooten J. Fiers W. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2904-2913PubMed Google Scholar). TNFÎ± preferentially kills transformed cells in vivo although it is not cytotoxic to normal diploid cells (26Fransen L. Ruysschaert M.R. Van der Heyden J. Fiers W. Cell Immunol. 1986; 100: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 28Hohmann H.P. Remy R. Brockhaus M. van Loon A.P. J. Biol.

The mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic effects of TNFÎ± are not completely understood. However, it has been shown that cytotoxicity of TNFÎ± is mediated through mainly TNFR1, which has a 70-amino acid region in the cytoplasmic domain termed the âdeath domainâ (30Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Verma I.M. Green D.R. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 107-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Further studies have found that inhibition of DNA topoisomerase, production of reactive oxygen intermediates in the mitochondria, and induction of proteases appears to be involved (31Baloch Z. Cohen S. Coffman F.D. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 2908-2913PubMed Google Scholar, 32Goossens V. Grooten J. De Vos K. Fiers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8115-8119Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 33Suffys P. Beyaert R. Van Roy F. Fiers W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 178: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the cytotoxic effects of TNFÎ± on neoplastic cells are synergistically enhanced by TPA in vitro although the molecular mechanisms underlying this synergism are not known (34Wang A.M. Creasey A.A. Ladner M.B. Lin L.S. Strickler J. Van Arsdell J.N. Yamamoto R. Mark D.F. Science. 1985; 228: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar).In this study, we examined the cytotoxic effects of TPA on a human monocytic cell line, U937, and a human myeloblastic cell line, KY821. Our results demonstrate that TPA induces apoptosis through TNFÎ± production in U937 and KY821 cells.DISCUSSIONThe development and maintenance of tissues are achieved by several dynamically regulated processes that include cell proliferation, differentiation, and programmed cell death (51Saunders Jr., J.W. Science. 1966; 154: 604-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 52Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12726) Google Scholar). When cells are exposed to external insults, negative regulation of the cell cycle or apoptosis occurs; cells which fail to repair DNA are eliminated through apoptosis (53Lotem J. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Sachs L. Blood. 1991; 78: 953-960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 54Imamura J. Miyoshi I. Koeffler H.P. Blood. 1994; 84: 2412-2421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated the mechanisms of apoptosis by a potent stimulator of PKC, TPA in the human monocytic cell line U937 and the myeloblastic cell line KY821. Our results show that TPA induces apoptosis, at least in part, through a pathway which requires endogenous production of TNFÎ± in these cells.Our study showed that TPA stimulated production of TNFÎ± in these cells, and pretreatment of cells with anti-TNFÎ± neutralizing antibody abrogated apoptosis induced by TPA. Moreover, exogenously added TNFÎ± also induced apoptosis in U937 cells. TPA also increased levels of IL-1Î² mRNA in U937cells. IL-1Î² is a cytokine, which is also produced by cells of monocytic lineage, and TNFÎ± and IL-1Î² share a number of biological properties although they are molecularly distinct cytokines (55Le J. Vilcek J. Lab. Invest. 1987; 56: 234-248PubMed Google Scholar). However, treatment with anti-IL-1Î² antibody did not affect apoptosis induced by TPA. TNFÎ± induces apoptosis through binding to TNFR1 (56Baker S.J. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar). TNFR1 belongs to the same receptor family as Fas (APO/CD95) which is known to trigger apoptosis in a number of different cell types upon ligand binding (57Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4537) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that both receptors contain an approximately 70-amino acid domain in the cytoplasmic region known as the âdeath domain,â which is required for the cytotoxic effects (58Itoh N. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10932-10937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 59Tartaglia L.A. Ayres T.M. Wong G.H. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1993; 74: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). In this study, TPA increased levels of TNFR1 mRNA in U937 and KY821 cells. Moreover, the overexpression of TNFR1 enhanced the apoptosis induced by TPA in U937 cells whereas TPA did not affect levels of Fas. The cytotoxic effect of TNFÎ± on neoplastic cells has been shown also to be synergistically enhanced by TPA in vitro (34Wang A.M. Creasey A.A. Ladner M.B. Lin L.S. Strickler J. Van Arsdell J.N. Yamamoto R. Mark D.F. Science. 1985; 228: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that endogenous production of TNFÎ± plays a crucial role in apoptosis of these cells.Death domain receptors including TNFR1 are constitutively expressed in various types of cells; these receptors are maintained in inactive state in the absence of ligands (60Jiang Y. Woronicz J.D. Liu W. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1999; 283: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 61Tartaglia L.A. Goeddel D.V. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 151-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). Prior studies (60Jiang Y. Woronicz J.D. Liu W. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1999; 283: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) have suggested that it is difficult to generate stable cell lines overexpressing death domain receptors because the overexpression leads to receptor aggregation and constitutive apoptosis. We stably transfected U937 cells with a human TNFR1 expression vector and obtained several clones with different levels of TNFR1 mRNA. The most highly TNFR1-overexpressing U937 cells showed an approximately 6-fold TNFR1 level, as compared with that of control-transfected cells, with a slightly but significantly elevated basal level of apoptosis. A recent study has found a protein that protects against ligand-independent signaling by TNFR1 and other death domain receptors (60Jiang Y. Woronicz J.D. Liu W. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1999; 283: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). This protein, silencer of death domain (SODD), inhibits the intrinsic self-aggregation properties of the death domain and maintains TNFR1 in an active monomeric state; TNF reduces levels of silence of death domain bound to TNFR1 in U937 cells (60Jiang Y. Woronicz J.D. Liu W. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1999; 283: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The mechanism responsible for the overexpression of TNFR1 in our U937 cells remains to be elucidated but may involve the expression of silence of death domain at a high level in these U937 cells.Recent studies have demonstrated that an activation of PKC-modulated apoptosis though results are contradictory; TPA induces apoptosis in certain cells including U937 cells but inhibits apoptosis induced by various agents including ceramide (18Walker P.R.

Cell Res. 1997; 234: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Other studies have also reported that activation of PKC by TPA prevented apoptosis induced by TNFÎ± in U937 cells (65Cuvillier O. Pirianov G. Kleuser B. Vanek P.G. Coso O.A. Gutkind S. Spiegel S. Nature. 1996; 381: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar, 66Mayne G.C. Murray A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24115-24121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These results suggest that whether apoptosis is induced in response to TPA depends on the type of cell. In this study, TPA induced apoptosis in U937 cells; these results were consistent with previous studies (15de Vente J. Kiley S. Garris T. Bryant W. Hooker J. Posekany K. Parker P. Cook P. Fletcher D. Ways D.K. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 371-382PubMed Google Scholar, 23Mizuno K. Noda K. Araki T. Imaoka T. Kobayashi Y. Akita Y. Shimonaka M. Kishi S. Ohno S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We also showed that TPA stimulated MAPK activity and inhibition of PKC or MAPK pathway almost completely prevented the production of TNFÎ± and the induction of apoptosis by TPA. Activation of the MAPK signaling pathway via PKC is an important mechanism for several biological events such as apoptosis, and PKC regulates the MAPK pathway, alone or with other mechanisms (67Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar,68Hall-Jackson C.A. Jones T. Eccles N.G. Dawson T.P. Bond J.A. Gescher A. Wynford-Thomas D. Br. J. Cancer. 1998; 78: 641-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that activation of the PKC and MAPK-signaling cascade leads to the accumulation of TNFÎ±, which is required for the induction of apoptosis by TPA. However, much evidence accumulated suggests that TPA and TNFÎ± exert opposing effects on the induction of apoptosis in U937 cells (60Jiang Y. Woronicz J.D. Liu W. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1999; 283: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar).TNFÎ± stimulates sphingomyelin degradation with the subsequent formation of ceramide, and ceramide induces apoptosis in leukemia cells (69Dressler K.A.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Moreover, there are reports that PKC activation is antagonistic to ceramide-induced apoptosis (64Ferraris C. Cooklis M. Polakowska R.R. Haake A.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 234: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 75Ji L. Zhang G. Uematsu S. Akahori Y. Hirabayashi Y.

Also TPA has been shown to activate sphingosine kinase, leading to increased concentrations of sphingosine-1-phosphate (SPP), which is a metabolite of ceramide and suppresses ceramide-mediated apoptosis (65Cuvillier O. Pirianov G. Kleuser B. Vanek P.G. Coso O.A. Gutkind S. Spiegel S. Nature. 1996; 381: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar, 77Wu J. Spiegel S. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11484-11488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that blocking the MAPK pathway prevented the cytoprotective effect of SPP on TNFÎ±-induced apoptosis in U937 cells (65Cuvillier O. Pirianov G. Kleuser B. Vanek P.G. Coso O.A. Gutkind S. Spiegel S. Nature. 1996; 381: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). SPP stimulates MAPK activity and activation of MAPK promotes cell survival (77Wu J. Spiegel S. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11484-11488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 78Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5027) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies suggest that activation of MAPK may stimulate different pathways responsible for the opposing effects on apoptosis and cell survival.Leukemia cell lines including U937 and HL60 promyelomatic cells consist of phenotypically and biologically heterogeneous populations of cells that arrest at different stages of differentiation (79Ways D.K. Dodd R.C. Earp H.S. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 3344-3350PubMed Google Scholar). A recent report has shown that certain PKC isotypes were down-regulated in differentiated cells (23Mizuno K. Noda K. Araki T. Imaoka T. Kobayashi Y. Akita Y. Shimonaka M. Kishi S. Ohno S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Although we provided evidence that TPA induced apoptosis through production of TNFÎ± in U937 cells, the mechanism for the discrepancy between studies by other groups and us remains unclear. Studies suggest that the balance between the intracellular levels of ceramide and SPP is critical for the fate of cells (65Cuvillier O. Pirianov G. Kleuser B. Vanek P.G. Coso O.A. Gutkind S. Spiegel S. Nature. 1996; 381: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar, 66Mayne G.C. Murray A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24115-24121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Considering these studies, the ceramide/SPP rheostat may be characteristic of cell type and, also, the differentiation-stage. Furthermore, the levels of products of PKC activation, TNFÎ±, and SPP may be varied in each U937 cell line, leading to opposing effects on programmed cell death.Studies have shown that U937 cells have no wild type p53 transcripts or protein; a point mutation that converts G into A at the first base of intron 5 results in a partial deletion of 46 bases from the p53 mRNA (80Sugimoto K. Toyoshima H. Sakai R. Miyagawa K. Hagiwara K. Ishikawa F. Takaku F. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Blood. 1992; 79: 2378-2383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 81Foti A. Bar-Eli M. Ahuja H.G. Cline M.J. Br. J.

TNFÎ±-induced apoptosis can occur in cells deficient for p53 or with mutated p53 (82Donato N.J. Perez M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5067-5072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, TNFÎ± may be of critical importance for apoptosis in U937 cells that lack functional p53. Furthermore, in this study, untreated U937 cells constitutively underwent apoptosis to an extent. Moreover, the constitutive apoptosis was augmented by the overexpression of TNFR1 in these cells. Whereas the TNFÎ± protein in the supernatant of untreated cells was below the level of undetectability, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that cell lysates of untreated U937 cells contained TNFÎ± (0.39 Î¼g/mg protein and 20 pg/106cells). Endogenously produced TNFÎ± may induce apoptosis, in part, through autocrine loops in the endoplasmic reticulum. Apoptosis, a morphologically distinguished form of programmed cell death, plays important roles not only during development and tissue homeostasis but also in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases including cancer, autoimmune disease, viral infection, and neurodegenerative disorder (1Raff M.C.

The precise mechanisms that control apoptosis have not been elucidated; it appears that this form of cell death is regulated by a genetic program involving both inducers and repressors (6White E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). The tumor suppressor p53 is one of the key proteins affecting the fate of cells exposed to external insults; activation of p53 leads to apoptosis or cell cycle arrest. Inactivation of p53 by either a mutation of the gene or interaction with oncogenic viral or cellular proteins is a common event in the development of malignancies (9Nigro J.M. Baker S.J.

Here, we explored the molecular mechanism of silencing of MT-I gene in Ku-80 cells. Genomic footprinting analysis revealed both basal and heavy metal-inducible binding at specific cis elements in the parental cell line (Rat-1). By contrast, MT-I promoter in Ku-80 cells was refractory to any transactivating factors, implying alteration of chromatin structure. Treatment of two clonal lines of Ku-80 cells with 5-azacytidine, a potent DNA demethylating agent, rendered MT-I gene inducible by heavy metals, suggesting that the gene is methylated in these cells. Bisulfite genomic sequencing revealed that all 21 CpG dinucleotides in MT-I immediate promoter were methylated in Ku-80 cells, whereas only four CpG dinucleotides were methylated in Rat-1 cells. Almost all methylated CpG dinucleotides were demethylated in Ku-80 cells after 5-azacytidine treatment.

To our knowledge, this is the first report that describes hypermethylation of a specific gene promoter and its resultant silencing in response to overexpression of a cellular protein. Ku is an abundant nuclear protein that consists of two polypeptides of molecular masses 80â86 and 70â72 kDa. It was first identified in the serum of a patient with scleroderma polymyositis overlap syndrome (1Mimori T. Akizuki M. Yamagata H. Inada S. Yoshida S. Homma M. J. Clin.

Ku has been implicated in multiple cellular processes that include DNA replication, recombination, repair, ATPase and helicase activities, transcription, and alteration in chromatin structure (2Dynan W.S.

It is also involved in cell signaling (9Le Romancer M. Reyl-Desmars F. Cherifi Y. Pigeon C. Bottari S. Meyer O. Lewin M.J. J. Biol.

Further study showed that Ku could physically and functionally interact with another RNA polymerase I transcription activator, CPBF (14Niu H. Zhang J. Jacob S.T. Gene Expr. 1995; 4: 111-124PubMed Google Scholar), a protein that is structurally and functionally related to USF, a helix-loop-helix-zipper DNA binding factor (15Datta P.K. Ghosh A.K. Jacob S.T. J.

On the contrary, Ku purified from the growth-arrested cells inhibited polymerase I transcription, which could be restored following addition of purified Ku from the control cells (11Niu H. Jacob S.T.

Interestingly, overexpression of the small subunit (p70) of Ku or of the heterodimer (p70 and p80) did not inhibit MT induction by the heavy metals. Nuclear extracts from the p80-overexpressing cells contained a repressor activity that could block transcription from the MT-I promoter (19Ghoshal K. Li Z. Jacob S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10390-10395Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The activities of two of the key transcription factors, Sp1 and MTF-1, that modulate MT-I transcription were not modified in the extracts from these cells. The present study was undertaken to determine the molecular mechanism by which MT-I expression is repressed in the p80 overexpressing cells. This study showed that the promoter hypermethylation is primarily responsible for the suppression of MT induction. metallothionein 5-azacytidine dimethyl sulfate in vivogenomic footprinting metal response element, MLTF/ARE, adeno major late transcription factor/antioxidant response element ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction base pair(s) Rat-1 (parental cell line) as well as cell lines that overexpress p70 subunit (R70-15), p80 subunit (R80-1 and R80-6), and both subunits (R7080-6) were generously provided by Gloria Li, Memorial Sloan Kettering Institute. For convenience, overexpressing cell lines were also designated Ku-70, Ku-80, and Ku-7080, respectively. All experiments except that described in Fig.2 B were performed using the clonal isolate R80-1 (designated Ku-80 throughout the text). In the experiment described in Fig.2 B, R80-1 (Ku-80) and another clonal isolate, designated R80-6, were used. The culture conditions and treatment with the heavy metals were described earlier (19Ghoshal K. Li Z. Jacob S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10390-10395Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For 5-AzaC treatment, Ku-80 cells at 25â30% confluency were grown in presence of increasing concentration of the analog for 72 h. RNA isolation and Northern blot analysis were performed as described (19Ghoshal K. Li Z. Jacob S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10390-10395Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In vivo methylation of cellular DNA by dimethyl sulfate (DMS) and the subsequent DNA extraction were done following the protocol of Mueller and Wold (20Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). The procedure of Ping et. al (21Ping D. Jones P.L. Boss J.M. Immunity. 1996; 4: 455-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) was followed for ligation-mediated (LM)-PCR. MRE and MLTF/ARE sites (adeno major late transcription factor/antioxidant response element) were analyzed using one set of upper strand- and one set of lower strand-specific primers. The primers used to read the lower strand were: RMTI-5â²-1, 5â²-ACATGATGTTCCACACGTCAC; RMTI-5â²-2, 5â²-TGTTCCACACGTCACACGG; and RMTI-5â²-3, 5â²-CACACGTCACACGGGTCCTC. The annealing temperatures for this set of primers were 58, 61, and 64 Â°C, respectively. The sequences of primers to read the upper strand were: RMTI-3â²-1, 5â²-TTAGCGGACAGTCTGCTCTC; RMTI-3â²-2, 5â²-GCGGACAGTCTGCTCTCTTTATAG; and RMTI-3â²-3, 5â²-CTGCTCTCTTTATAGTCGTTGGACGG. The annealing temperatures were 57, 60, and 64 Â°C, respectively. Genomic DNA isolated from different cell lines were treated with sodium bisulfite according to Clark et. al (22Clark S.J. Harrison J. Paul C.L. Frommer M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar) with some modifications. MT-I promoter from â304 to +148 bp was then amplified using two sets of primers from the bisulfite-treated DNA. The primers used were: rMTI-T1, 5â²-GAAAGGAGAAGTTGAGGATAGTGTGTTATG; rMTI-T2, 5â²-TACCCCAAACCCCAACAAAAAACCATTC, annealing temperature was 60 Â°C. The nested primers were: A2, 5â²-CCAAACCCCTACAACTAAATATTC; and S2, 5â²-GTATTGGATTAGTGATGGTTTGTAATAT, annealing temperature was 59 Â°C. The PCR product was directly sequenced using fmolTMsequencing kit (Promega) with the S2 and A2 primers. Previous study (19Ghoshal K. Li Z. Jacob S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10390-10395Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) in our laboratory demonstrated that Ku-80 cells (cells overexpressing the large subunit of the protein Ku) were unable to induce MT-I or MT-II in response to heavy metals such as CdSO4 or ZnSO4. Under this condition, the parental Rat-1 cells, a fibroblast cell line, and Ku-70 cells (cells overexpressing the small subunit of Ku) or Ku-7080 cells (cells overproducing both subunits of Ku) could induce the gene by the toxic metals. This study suggested that the noninducibility of MT-I gene in Ku-80 cells was because of the existence of a repressor in the nuclear extract prepared from Ku-80 cells (19Ghoshal K. Li Z. Jacob S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10390-10395Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Alternatively, overexpression of p80 could result in altered chromatin structure that inhibits access of positive factors to the corresponding regulatory elements in the promoter. To address the latter issue, we took advantage of in vivo genomic footprinting (IVGF) to analyze and compare the state of MT-I promoter occupancy in Rat-1 and Ku-80 cells before and after exposure to heavy metals. This would allow us to identify the sequence-specific DNA-protein interactions that are unique to both cell lines, and potential alterations of these interactions specifically in the parental cells after exposure to heavy metals. IVGF analysis of the MT-I promoter was performed by LM-PCR with primers designed to amplify the sequence from â226 to â16 bp, which encompasses all cis-acting elements involved in the basal and metal-induced expression of MT-I. Fig.1 A depicts the metal regulatory elements and other key elements of the rat MT-I promoter. Both Rat-1 and Ku-80 cells were treated with DMS before and after exposure to ZnSO4 or CdSO4, and genomic DNA was extracted, cleaved with piperidine, followed by amplification of the promoter fragment by LM-PCR. Naked genomic DNA isolated from both Rat-1 and Ku-80 cells were treated in the same manner as intact cells and amplified to provide the genomic G-ladder. DNA-protein interactions can result in protection of G-residues from DMS reactivity that produce less intense bands (indicated by arrows in Fig. 1,B and C). Alternatively, such interactions can result in more intense bands of G-residues exhibiting enhanced DMS reactivity (indicated by asterisks in Fig. 1, Band C) when compared with the naked DNA ladder or untreated control. The DMS reactivity and cleavage pattern of both strands of naked genomic DNA from Rat-1 and Ku-80 cells were identical (Fig. 1,B and C). Heavy metal-induced footprinting was observed in the lower strand at MRE-d element where varying levels of protection of the G-residues spanning this element were detectable upon Zn2+ or Cd2+ treatment of the Rat-1 cells (Fig. 1 B,lanes 3 and 4). Distinct footprinting of MRE-c element and the overlapping MRE-câ² element were clearly detectable in the lower strand of MT-I promoter of Rat-1 cells, which were indistinguishable for Zn2+- and Cd2+-treated samples (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3 and 4). The G-residues encompassing MRE-e, MRE-b, and MRE-a element of the lower strand of MT-I promoter from the heavy metal-treated Rat-1 cells were also protected (Fig. 1 B). In addition, Zn2+- and Cd2+-induced footprinting was observed at the composite element MLTF/ARE in the lower strand of control Rat-1 cells when compared with the naked G-ladder (Fig. 1 B). The G-residues in Sp1 binding element were constitutively protected (Fig.1 C, lane 2, double arrow), and some were hypersensitive in the upper strand of control Rat-1 cells (Fig.1 C, asterisk) before and after ZnSO4or CdSO4 treatment. A very prominent DMS reactivity (hypersensitive residue) was observed at another Sp1 binding site overlapping with the MLTF/ARE element in the upper strand of MT-I promoter from both Zn2+- and Cd2+-treated Rat-1 cells (Fig. 1 C). On the contrary, none of the conspicuous constitutive and/or metal-induced footprinting observed in Rat-1 cells were visible in Ku-80 cells irrespective of metal ion treatment (Fig.1, B and C). This observation indicates that overexpression of p80 protein results in altered chromatin structure. Such chromatin modification is likely to lead to a conformation of the MT-I promoter refractory to any positive factor binding, which could explain the lack of heavy metal-induced MT-I induction in Ku-80 cells. The failure of the positive factors to footprint on the promoter of other genes silenced because of methylation of CpG dinucleotides has been reported by many laboratories (23Kass S.U. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 444-449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Based on these published reports and our own IVGF data with MT-I gene (Fig. 1), we reasoned that MT-I promoter may be silenced in Ku-80 cells because of promoter methylation. To test this possibility, we determined the effect of 5-AzaC, a potent DNA demethylating agent (24Santi D.V. Garrett C.E. Barr P.J. Cell. 1983; 33: 9-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) on MT-I expression. As treatment with 10 Î¼m 5-AzaC for 24 h did not result in induction of the gene in response to heavy metals (19Ghoshal K. Li Z. Jacob S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10390-10395Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we first determined the concentration of the cytosine analog and duration of treatment that can activate MT-I gene in Ku-80 cells. Increase in 5-AzaC concentration from 10 to 20 Î¼m and time of incubation with the drug from 24 to 72 h resulted in significant expression of MT-I mRNA after CdSO4treatment (Fig. 2 A). These data showed that MT-I gene can indeed be induced in Ku-80 cells (R80-1 clonal line) by heavy metals after prolonged treatment with relatively high concentration of 5-AzaC. The MT-I promoter methylation in the clonal cell line used in the present study may be because of a critical chance event of methylation that contributed to further methylation. To rule out this possibility, we used another randomly selected clonal isolate (R80-6) of p80 overexpressing cells. This study showed that MT-I gene is repressed in these cells as well and that demethylation with 5-AzaC reactivated the promoter (Fig. 2 B). The silencing of MT-I gene in the cells overexpressing the 80-kDa subunit is, therefore a specific event. After demethylation with 5-AzaC, MT-I gene could be activated by other inducers as well, e.g.zinc, dexamethasone, cycloheximide (data not shown). We then compared the level of induction of MT-I mRNA in Rat-1 cells following exposure to CdSO4 to that of Ku-80 cells treated with 5-AzaC plus CdSO4 (Fig. 2 C). Under this condition, MT-I mRNA level in the 5-AzaC-treated Ku-80 cells reached almost the same level as that in Rat-1 cells. We could not detect any basal expression of MT-I in Ku-80 cells after 5-AzaC treatment. This data suggests that hypermethylation of MT-I gene plays a key role in its silencing in Ku-80 cells. To ensure that the activation of MT-I gene by various inducers after 5-AzaC treatment was indeed because of demethylation of the promoter, we performed bisulfite genomic sequencing before and after the drug treatment. Sequence analysis of MT-I promoter (â225 to +1 bp with respect to transcription initiation site) that harbors the cis elements for most of the transacting factors revealed high density of potential methylatable CpG dinucleotides (twenty-one) spanning this region (Fig. 3 A). Therefore, it was essential to compare the methylation status of MT-I promoter in Ku-80 cells with that in Ku-70 and Ku-7080 cell lines, which express the smaller subunit of Ku and both subunits together, respectively. The latter two cell lines can express MT-I mRNA at the same level as the parental cell line (Rat-1) in response to heavy metals (19Ghoshal K. Li Z. Jacob S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10390-10395Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For this purpose, we performed bisulfite genomic sequencing of DNA isolated from (a) Rat-1, (b) Ku-80, (c) Ku-80 treated with 5-AzaC, (d) Ku-70, and (e) Ku-7080 cells. The bisulfite treatment of the genomic DNA resulted in complete conversion of unmethylated cytosines to uracils without affecting methylated cytosines. Subsequent PCR amplification and sequencing provided an accurate and consistent representation of mCpG sequences. Completion of bisulfite conversion of the genomic DNA isolated from the five different cell samples were confirmed by Tsp509I digestion. The restriction site for Tsp509I (âAATTâ) does not exist in MT-I promoter and is generated only after bisulfite conversion of unmethylated cytosine residues to uracils, which are amplified as thymine during PCR. The Tsp509I digestion analysis of PCR-amplified bisulfite-treated DNA from Ku-7080, Ku-70, Rat-1, and Ku-80 cells treated with 5-AzaC and Ku-80 cells showed total cleavage of amplified DNA from all five samples (Fig. 3 B), indicating completion of bisulfite reaction. To assess the existence of CpG methylation, we digested all the DNA samples with BstUI (CGâCG). The MT-I promoter contains the restriction site for this enzyme, which should be retained after bisulfite conversion if the cytosine residues were methylated. Only the amplified DNA from Ku-80 cells showed cleavage with BstUI, indicating the presence of methyl CpG dinucleotide in this cell line. The bisulfite conversion and restriction enzyme digestion of the amplified DNA were performed at least three times with different batches of chromosomal DNA. To study the status of all 21 CpG base pairs, we sequenced the amplified DNA from all five cell cultures (see Fig.4 for schematic representation of the sequencing data). Interestingly, all 21 CpG base pairs (between â225 to +1 site) in Ku-80 cells were methylated, whereas in Rat-1 cells only four methylated CpG dinucleotides were present in the same promoter stretch. It was logical to conceive that the additional CpG methylation of MT-I promoter in Ku-80 cells was a direct or indirect outcome of p80 overexpression in these cells. Interestingly, none of the CpG elements were methylated in Ku-70 or Ku-7080 cells, implying that methylation of MT-I promoter occurred in the cell line that overexpressed specifically p80 but not in cell lines overexpressing p70 homodimer or the p70/p80 heterodimer. Sequencing of bisulfite-converted DNA from Ku-80 cells treated with 5-AzaC showed extensive demethylation of the MT-I promoter. This explains the ability of 5-AzaC-treated Ku-80 cells to express MT-I upon heavy metal treatment as observed in Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2). This particular batch of 5-AzaC-treated Ku-80 cells retained one methylated CpG at â112 site of the MT-I promoter, which did not interfere with the expression of the gene. Although the role of Ku and associated DNA-PK has been well established in V-d-J recombination and double strand DNA break repair, the mechanism by which Ku regulates expression of various genes at the transcriptional level is still an enigma. Earlier studies showed that overexpression of the p70 subunit of Ku or the heterodimer represses induction of Hsp-70 protein (13Li G.C. Yang S.H. Kim D. Nussenzweig A. Ouyang H. Wei J. Burgman P.

Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 3799-3806Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The p80 subunit of Ku can function as a receptor for somatostatin (9Le Romancer M. Reyl-Desmars F. Cherifi Y. Pigeon C. Bottari S. Meyer O. Lewin M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17464-17468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the small polypeptide (p70) can directly interact with the proto-oncogene p95vav (26Romero F. Dargemont C. Pozo F. Reeves W.H. Camonis J. Gisselbrecht S. Fischer S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and GCN5, a transcriptional adapter that has chromatin-modifying activity (27Barlev N.A. Poltoratsky V. Owen-Hughes T. Ying C. Liu L. Workman J.L. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1349-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The present study using different clonal isolates of Rat-1 cells overexpressing the large Ku subunit, has clearly demonstrated for the first time that overproduction of a single subunit of a cellular protein can hypermethylate and consequently silence the promoter of a specific gene. These results implicate that the individual subunits of Ku can play important regulatory roles in cellular functions. Although Ku exists predominantly as heterodimer, a certain population of this protein may also exist as homodimers which could exert their specific functions. The ratio of homodimer to heterodimer may vary with the cell type and under certain physiological conditions and disease states. Because the Ku homodimers are generally unstable, they are degraded rapidly (2Dynan W.S. Yoo S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1551-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Consequently, the amount of p80 in Ku-80 cells is considerably less than that in Ku-7080 cells where both p70 and p80 are overexpressed (19Ghoshal K. Li Z. Jacob S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10390-10395Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 25Yang S.H. Nussenzweig A. Li L. Kim D. Ouyang H. Burgman P. Li G.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 3799-3806Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The overproduction of any individual subunit under certain physiological conditions or in pathological states may, therefore, have gone undetected. We have recently demonstrated that MT-I promoter is hypermethylated in a rat hepatoma and a mouse lymphosarcoma cell line (relative to the parental cells) which resulted in the repression of MT-I expression in these cancer cells. 2K. Ghoshal, unpublished data. Chromatographic fractionation of the nuclear extracts from the hepatoma has frequently yielded fractions that contain variable amounts of Ku homodimers. 3A. Ghosh and S. Jacob, unpublished data. This observation is consistent with the potential role of Ku subunits in the methylation of some promoters, which results in their inactivation. Previous study in our laboratory showed that only the cells that overproduce the large subunit of Ku fail to express metallothionein gene and that the suppression of MT-I transcription is at least, in part, because of the production of a repressor in these cells (19Ghoshal K. Li Z. Jacob S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10390-10395Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This conclusion was reached by studying the in vitrotranscription of MT-I promoter in nuclear extracts derived from the wild-type and mutant cells. This study did not suggest the role of promoter methylation along with the production of an active repressor in silencing the MT-I gene. The present data have clearly demonstrated that long term treatment of the cells with higher concentration of 5-AzaC was essential to remove the inhibitory methyl groups from methylated CpG residues in MT-I promoter. The methylation of four CpG elements of twenty one such dinucleotides in the MT-I promoter of Rat-1 cells did not affect the ability to express MT-I in response to heavy metals. The persistence of DNA binding activity of MTF-1, the key transcription factor for MT-I induction, in vitro (gel shift assay) or ability to transactivate in vivo (transient transaction assay) (28Radtke F. Hug M. Georgiev O. Matsuo K. Schaffner W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1996; 377: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) following methylation of some MRE sites may probably explain the capability of Rat-1 cells to express MT-I despite methylation of a few key cis elements. Interestingly, the DNA binding and transactivation property of the zinc finger protein Sp1 are also not inhibited upon methylation of its binding site (28Radtke F. Hug M. Georgiev O. Matsuo K. Schaffner W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1996; 377: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The differential methylation pattern of MT-I promoter in Rat-1 and Ku-80 cells leads us to postulate that the methylation of just a few key cis elements in Ku-80 cells alone may not cause MT-I gene silencing. Rather, extensive methylation of the promoter is likely to recruit the methyl CpG binding proteins along with repressors of transcription, like histone H1 or Sin3A (29Jones P.L. Veenstra G.J. Wade P.A. Vermaak D. Kass S.U. Landsberger N. Strouboulis J. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (2262) Google Scholar) that leads to alteration in the chromatin structure and consequently gene silencing. The repressor detected in our earlier study in Ku-80 cell extract (19Ghoshal K. Li Z. Jacob S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10390-10395Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) is probably a methyl C binding protein (MeCP), as it has been shown earlier that MeCP can inhibit transcription in vitro from unmethylated as well as methylated promoters depending upon the assay conditions (30Meehan R.R. Lewis J.D. Bird A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5085-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Further, overexpression of MeCP2 is known to inhibit Sp1-activated transcription of human leukosialin gene, although methylation of Sp1 binding site does not interfere with its binding (31Kudo S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5492-5499Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Preliminary UV cross-linking studies have shown that the activity of a MeCP is significantly higher in nuclear extract from the Ku-80 cells compared with that from Rat-1 cells. Alternatively, it is conceivable that a repressor different from MeCP may function in concert with the methylated promoter to achieve repression of MT induction in Ku-80 cells. It is unlikely that a repressor protein binds directly to the promoter (between â226 to +1 bp) and alters the chromatin conformation, as no unique or new footprinting appeared in the MT-I promoter of Ku-80 cells relative to that of Rat-1 cells. We extended our footprinting analysis up to â350 bp of the promoter using another set of primers, which did not indicate any DNA/repressor interaction in Ku-80 cells (data not shown). The events occurring upstream of â350 bp cannot, however, be discerned from the present data. Based on these data, it is reasonable to conclude that overexpression of the 80-kDa subunit of Ku protein silences MT-I gene in vivo by methylation of CpG island. Methylated CpGs would then be bound by a specific MeCP(s), resulting in altered conformation of chromatin structure that is inaccessible to the transcription activators. Ku-80 homodimer by itself or via a signaling mechanism might have initiated MT-I promoter methylation and subsequent silencing of the gene. Direct addition of recombinant p80 (expressed from histidine-tagged p80 in reticulocyte lysate) to the in vitrotranscription system from Rat-1 cell extract did not inhibit MT-I promoter activity in vitro (19Ghoshal K. Li Z. Jacob S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10390-10395Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These data do not, however, preclude the possibility of a direct role of p80 in the MT-I promoter hypermethylation in vivo. To test the possible activation of DNA methyl transferase in Ku-80 cells that could result in hypermethylation of MT-I promoter, we measured the enzyme activity in the whole cell extract prepared from the cell lines overexpressing different subunits of Ku. The activity of this enzyme in these cells was similar to that in the parental cell line (Rat-1). 4X. Dong, unpublished data. These results clearly show that MT-I promoter methylation in Ku-80 cells was mediated by some mechanism(s) other than activation of DNA-methyl transferase. Finally, the relative specificity of MT-I promoter methylation following overexpression of the 80-kDa subunit of Ku deserves comment. We have examined the expression of some growth suppressors (e.g. p16, p53) and housekeeping genes (e.g.Hsp70, heme oxygenase I) in Ku-80 cells. It is known that p16 and p53 promoters are hypermethylated and consequently silenced in many different types of cancers (32Baylin S.B. Herman J.G. Graff J.R. Vertino P.M. Issa J.P. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 72: 141-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). None of these genes were silenced in the Ku-80 cells (data not presented). Furthermore, the MT-I promoter was inducible by heavy metals in the cells that overproduce the smaller subunit of Ku or both subunits together (19Ghoshal K. Li Z. Jacob S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10390-10395Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Differential display of genes or related techniques should be performed to identify other genes that are suppressed in the Ku-80 cells. Clearly, overexpression of just the large subunit appears to trigger a signal transduction pathway that leads to hypermethylation of MT-I promoter and its silencing. The challenge for future studies is to identify the step(s) that leads to hypermethylation of a gene promoter as a result of p80 overexpression and the mechanism by which MT-I promoter and probably a few other promoters are susceptible to hypermethylation in Ku-80 cells. We sincerely thank Dr. Gloria Li, Memorial Sloan Kettering Institute, and Dr. Richard Palmiter, Washington University, for providing Ku overexpressing cell lines and mouse MT-I minigene, respectively."

To test the role of Brn-3a in cervical neoplasia we have manipulated its expression in cervical carcinoma-derived cell lines with or without endogenous HPV genes. In HPV-expressing cells, reduction in Brn-3a expression specifically reduces HPV gene expression, growth rate, saturation density and anchorage-independent growth, whereas these effects are not observed when Brn-3a expression is reduced in cervical cells lacking HPV genomes.

It is now generally accepted that the oncogenic human papilloma viruses types 16 and 18 (HPV-16 and HPV-18) 1The abbreviations used are:HPVhuman papilloma virusURRupstream regulatory regionCINcervical intra-epithelial neoplasia 1The abbreviations used are:HPVhuman papilloma virusURRupstream regulatory regionCINcervical intra-epithelial neoplasia play a key role in cervical cancer. Thus these viruses encode specific transforming proteins (E6, E7) and are found in the great majority of women with cervical cancer (1Schiffman M.H. Bauer H.M. Hoover R.N. Glass A.G. Cadell D.M.

Despite this, however, both HPV-16 and HPV-18 can be detected in women with undetectable or minimal cervical abnormality (4Cox M.F. Meanwell C.A. Maitland N.J. Blackledge G. Scully C. Jordan J.A. Lancet. 1986; 2: 157-158Abstract PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 5Meanwell C.A. Lancet. 1987; 1: 703-707Abstract PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). It is therefore unclear what factors trigger HPV-16 or HPV-18 to initiate the transformation of cervical cells to a malignant phenotype. It has recently been shown that one potential mechanism for regulating HPV-induced transformation is the regulation of the activity of the transforming proteins E6 and E7. Thus, a natural polymorphism exists in the human population with some individuals having a p53 tumor suppressor protein with a proline residue at position 72, whereas others have an arginine at this position (6Storey A. Thomas M. Kalita A. Harwood C. Gardiol D. Mantovani F. Breuer J. Leigh I.M. Matlashewsko G. Banks L. Nature. 1998; 393: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). As p53 with an arginine residue is more efficiently degraded by the HPV E6 protein, individuals with this amino acid have a higher risk of cervical cancer caused by HPV (6Storey A. Thomas M.

Thus, it has been shown that the upstream regulatory region (URR) of the virus genome, which controls the expression of the genes encoding E6 and E7, is specifically active in cervical cells (7Cripe T.C. Hangen T.H. Turk J.P. Tabatabai F. Schmid P.G. Duerst M. Gissmann L. Roman A. Twek L. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3745-3753Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 8Gloss B. Bernard H.U. Seedorf K. Klock G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3735-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), and it has therefore been suggested that the regulation of HPV URR activity by cellular transcription factors may play a key role in regulating viral transforming activity in different cell types and different individuals (9Zur Hausen H. Lancet. 1986; 2: 489-491Abstract PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). However, although numerous studies have documented binding of several cellular transcription factors to the URR (10Chan W-K. Chong T. Benard H-U. Klock G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 763-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 11Chan W-K. Klock G. Bernard H-U. J.

Virology. 1990; 178: 92-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), these factors are generally ubiquitously expressed and may not therefore fully explain the cervical cell-specific activity of the URR or its activation leading to transformation in vivo. In previous studies, we showed that a sequence ATGCAATT in the region of the URR that confers cervical specific activity was able to stimulate URR activity in cervical cell lines while inhibiting its activity in noncervical cells (14Morris P.J. Dent C.L. Ring C.J.A. Latchman D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1019-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, this motif binds the ubiquitously expressed POU family transcription factor Oct-1, which represses its activity in noncervical cells (14Morris P.J. Dent C.L. Ring C.J.A. Latchman D.S.

Conversely, in cervical cells this motif can, in addition, bind the POU family transcription factors Brn-3a and Brn-3b, which were originally identified in neuronal cells (16Gerrero M.R.

Biol. 1993; 5: 488-498Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar), which are closely related to one another but are encoded by distinct genes (21Theil T. McLean-Hunter S. Zornig M. MoÌroÌy T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5921-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, Brn-3a activates transcription directed by the HPV URR, and this effect is dependent on the ATGCAATT motif (22Morris P.J. Theil T. Ring C.J.A. Lillycrop K.A. MoÌroÌy T. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6907-6914Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Conversely, Brn-3b represses such transcription via the ATGCAATT motif and interferes with activation by Brn-3a (22Morris P.J. Theil T. Ring C.J.A. Lillycrop K.A. MoÌroÌy T. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6907-6914Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In view of the possibility that the balance between Brn-3a and Brn-3b expression might play a key role in determining the activity of the HPV URR and therefore the progression of cervical cancer, we previously examined the expression of these factors in cervical biopsies from women with no detectable cervical abnormality and those with cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3) lesions. Most interestingly, although the level of Brn-3b expression was similar in the two groups, the mean level of Brn-3a was elevated more than 300-fold in the samples from women with CIN3 compared with the normal samples (23Ndisang D. Morris P.J. Chapman C. Ho L. Singer A. Latchman D.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1687-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Evidently this finding taken together with the ability of Brn-3a to activate the HPV URR raises the possibility that elevated levels of Brn-3a may be critical for E6 and E7 gene expression in cervical cancer. We have therefore investigated the effect of artificially manipulating the levels of Brn-3a on HPV gene expression in cervical cancer cell lines and on their growth and transformation characteristics. The expression vector pLTRpoly(ATCC) containing the full-length cDNAs of the class IV POU domain transcription factors Brn-3a and Brn-3b under the Moloney murine leukemia virus promoter have previously been described (27Smith M.D. Dawson S.J. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The antisense Brn-3a construct was cloned within the pJ5 vector polylinker under the control of the glucocorticoid-inducible mouse mammary tumor virus promoter (28Lakin N.D. Morris P.J. Theil T.

SiHa (ATCC) and C33 (ATCC) cell lines were grown in minimum essential medium (Eagle's) with Earle's buffered saline solution supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, and 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate. The Brn-3 expression vectors were cotransfected with pci-neo (Promega) neomycin-resistant vector into both cell lines by calcium phosphate-mediated transfection method (30Gorman C.M. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning, a Practical Approach. 2. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1985: 143-190Google Scholar). Typically, 15 Î¼g of the respective recombinants plus 3 Î¼g of the neomycin-resistant plasmid were co-transfected into 80% subconfluent SiHa and C33 cells in 10-cm plates, and media were supplemented subsequently with G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) to a final concentration of 800 Î¼g/ml. Putative clones began emerging after about 10 days and were subsequently isolated with cloning rings and cultured in medium supplemented with 800 Î¼g/ml G418. Antisense and control clones were treated with 1 Î¼m dexamethasone 24 h before protein extraction. Harvested cells were resuspended in 100 Î¼l of extraction buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.8), 450 mm NaCl, 0.4 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 25% glycerol 0.05 mm phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride) and freeze-thawed. The protein concentration of the supernatant was determined, and the samples used for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as earlier reported (23Ndisang D. Morris P.J. Chapman C. Ho L. Singer A. Latchman D.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1687-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) although with some modification for HPV-E6 protein analysis with shorter SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis resolution time. The gel was blotted onto membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the membrane was blocked for 2 h with 10% Marvel (fat-free milk) and incubated with 1:500 HPV-16-E6 antibody (Santa Cruz) for 16 h overnight at 4 Â°C, washed 5 times with 0.1% Tween 20, then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse secondary antibody (Santa Cruz) for 1 h. To analyze the growth rate of both the parental and clonal cells, a basic method of counting the amount of viable cells in a hemacytometer chamber using a light microscope was employed. Routinely, each putative clone or control cell was seeded with an initial density of 1 Ã 104 cells in three groups of eight. At regular intervals of 8, 16, and 24 h, subsequent groups of three were trypsinized, washed, resuspended in appropriate percentage of trypan blue medium, and then counted. For determination of the saturation density, the same method was used except for the longer time interval of about 3 days, during which the cells were allowed to proliferate freely without passage. Determination of anchorage-independent proliferation was established by growing cells in soft agar. 3 ml of 103 clonal or parental cells resuspended in low melting point agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.) dissolved in G418 supplemented media with or without dexamethasone to a final constitution of 0.33% was overlaid in triplicate 60-mm plates containing 0.5% low melting point agarose dissolved in appropriate medium. The plates were immediately incubated at 37 Â°C, and colonies were scored after 10 days. To investigate the effect of manipulating the expression of Brn-3a in cervical cancer cell lines, we utilized the SiHa cell line, which contains a single integrated HPV-16 genome and, for comparison, the C33-transformed cervical cell line, which does not contain any HPV DNA (24Auersperg N.

To overexpress Brn-3a, the cells were transfected with an expression vector in which expression of Brn-3a is driven by the moloney murine leukemia virus promoter, which we have previously used to successfully overexpress Brn-3a in neuronal cells (27Smith M.D. Dawson S.J. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A similar vector was also used to overexpress Brn-3b in these cells for comparison. Similarly, to reduce the level of endogenous Brn-3a, we used a construct in which an antisense transcript of Brn-3a is produced under the control of the glucocorticoid-inducible mouse mammary tumor virus promoter, which we have similarly previously used to reduce Brn-3a levels in neuronal cells (28Lakin N.D.

Similar transfections were also carried out using the expression vectors lacking any insert to produce control cell lines. In each case, stably transfected cell lines were selected on the basis of their neomycin resistance, which was encoded on the plasmid vector. In each case, several cell lines were isolated from different culture plates to control for clonal variation. Clonal cell lines isolated in this way were first tested to determine whether they contained altered levels of Brn-3a as determined by Western blotting with a specific antibody. In these experiments (Fig.1) clear overexpression of Brn-3a was observed in several cell lines transfected with the Brn-3a expression vector compared either to parental untransfected cells, cells transfected with the expression vector alone, or cells transfected with the Brn-3b expression vector. In contrast, several cell lines obtained by transfection with the Brn-3a antisense construct showed only minimal reduction of Brn-3a levels in the absence of dexamethasone to induce the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter. However, a clear reduction in Brn-3a levels was observed in several of these cell lines when the cells were treated with dexamethasone, resulting in the induction of the antisense construct. This effect was observed in both the SiHa cells and in the C-33 cells transfected with the Brn-3a antisense construct (Fig. 1). In contrast, no effect of dexamethasone on endogenous Brn-3a levels was observed in either of the parental cell lines when treated with dexamethasone or in the cell lines transfected with expression vector lacking any insert (data not shown). Similarly, no alteration in exogenous Brn-3a levels in response to dexamethasone was observed in the cell lines obtained by transfection with the Brn-3a sense construct under the control of the Moloney murine leukemia virus promoter. These data thus indicate that the cell lines engineered to overexpress Brn-3a do indeed show a specific elevation of Brn-3a levels, whereas the antisense cell lines show decreased expression of Brn-3a, particularly when grown in the presence of dexamethasone to induce the antisense construct. The cell lines showing the greatest elevations or reductions in Brn-3a levels were selected for further study. Similarly, the SiHa and C33 cell lines over-engineered to express Brn-3b showed a specific elevation of Brn-3b levels, which was not observed in the other cell lines (data not shown). To determine whether these alterations in Brn-3a and Brn-3b levels did produce a change in the level of HPV gene expression driven by the URR promoter, the cellular extracts were also Western-blotted with antibody to the HPV E6 protein. In these experiments (Fig.2) the SiHa cells engineered to overexpress Brn-3a showed no significant increase in HPV expression over the control parental SiHa cells or SiHa cells containing only plasmid vector, suggesting that HPV gene expression is likely to be maximally stimulated by the endogenous Brn-3a present in the SiHa cells. Interestingly, however, the cells engineered to overexpress Brn-3b showed a small decrease in HPV gene expression. A small decrease in HPV gene expression was also observed in both the cell lines containing the antisense construct. Most importantly, a significant further decrease in HPV gene expression was observed in both these cell lines upon treatment with dexamethasone to fully induce the antisense constructs. In contrast, no effect of dexamethasone on HPV expression was observed in the parental SiHa cells (Fig. 2), confirming that this effect was dependent upon the activation of the antisense construct by dexamethasone rather than on a direct inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on HPV gene expression. Interestingly, the decrease in HPV gene expression was greatest in antisense cell line 5, paralleling the greater reduction in Brn-3a levels in this cell line compared with the antisense cell line 3. As expected, no HPV gene expression was detected in any of the cell lines derived from C-33 cells, which are not transformed with HPV. These data indicate therefore that the HPV gene expression that occurs in the SiHa cell line appears to be dependent upon the expression of Brn-3a in these cells since it can be specifically reduced by decreasing Brn-3a levels using an antisense approach. We therefore wished to establish whether such alteration in HPV gene expression mediated via Brn-3a resulted in alterations in the growth rate of the manipulated cells. Evidently, the C33 cells serve as an important control for these experiments, since any direct effect of manipulating Brn-3a levels on cellular growth would also be observed in these cells, whereas this would not be the case if the effect in SiHa cells is mediated via the alteration in HPV gene expression that would not occur in the C33 cells. We therefore measured the growth rate of the various different clones over a 72-h period. In the experiments with the SiHa clones, the parental SiHa cells and the cells transfected with empty expression vector alone showed a similar growth rate (Fig.3 a), indicating that the selection of stably transfected cell lines does not produce cell lines with enhanced growth rates. Interestingly, overexpression of Brn-3a resulted in a marginally enhanced growth rate of the SiHa cells, whereas overexpression of Brn-3b produced a significantly reduced growth rate (Fig. 3 a). Most importantly, although the cells engineered with antisense Brn-3a showed a similar growth rate to parental cells in the absence of dexamethasone, their growth rate was dramatically reduced by treatment by dexamethasone, although this treatment had no effect on the growth of parental cells (Fig.3 b). These experiments thus indicate that the reduced Brn-3a expression in the antisense SiHa cells is paralleled not only by reduced HPV gene expression but also by reduced growth rate. In similar experiments in the HPV-negative C-33 cells (Fig. 4), all the cell lines showed similar growth rates. Hence, manipulating the expression of Brn-3a or Brn-3b in a cervical cell line that does not express HPV does not result in altered growth rates. As well as measuring the effect of manipulating Brn-3a expression on cellular growth rate, we also wished to determine whether such manipulation would affect the saturation density of the cells, since the loss of contact inhibition resulting in growth to higher densities is characteristic of cancer cells. The various cell lines were therefore plated out and grown over a period of several days to determine their saturation density. In these experiments (Fig.5), similar saturation densities were observed in the parental SiHa cells, the cells transfected with plasmid expression vector alone, and the cells overexpressing Brn-3a. However, a clearly reduced saturation density was observed in the SiHa cells overexpressing Brn-3b (Fig. 5 a). Similarly, two distinct SiHa cell lines containing the transfected antisense construct showed a clear reduction in saturation density compared with the parental cells (Fig. 5 b). This reduction was greater in cell line 5 compared with cell line 3, paralleling the greater reduction in HPV gene expression in this cell line (see Fig. 2). Moreover, the saturation density of both the antisense cell lines was further reduced by full induction of antisense expression using dexamethasone, whereas no effect on saturation density was observed when the parental cells were treated in this way, confirming that this effect was specific to the cells containing the antisense construct (Fig.5 b). As in the cell growth experiments, all the C-33-derived cell clones showed similar saturation densities that were unaffected by dexamethasone (Fig. 6), indicating that the effects in SiHa cells correlate with the effect of Brn-3a on HPV gene expression.Figure 6Saturation density of parental C-33 cells or C-33-derived clones stably transfected with empty expression vector (neo), Brn-3a expression vector (A), Brn-3b expression vector (B), or the antisense Brn-3a vector (â3 A), and grown in the presence or absence of dexamethasone. Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. Panel a: â, C33; âª, C33-neo; â¦, C33A; *, C33B.

We therefore measured the ability of the various cell lines to form colonies in soft agar. As indicated in Fig.7 a, the SiHa cells showed a clear ability to form colonies in soft agar as expected, and this was not affected in the cells containing the plasmid expresion vector or in the cells overexpressing Brn-3a. However, a significantly reduced rate of colony formation in soft agar was observed in the cells overexpressing Brn-3b, paralleling their reduced growth rate and saturation density when grown attached to culture dishes (p < 0.05 for SiHa-neo compared with SiHa B). Moreover, a still greater reduction in colony formation of approximately 4-fold was observed in the two different cell lines containing the antisense Brn-3a construct (Fig. 7 a). This colony formation was reduced even further upon treatment of the antisense cells with dexamethasone, with colony formation being virtually undetectable in cell line 5, paralleling its greater reduction in HPV gene expression and saturation density (p < 0.05 for each antisense line compared with parental cells). This effect of dexamethasone was specific to the antisense cell lines, since no effect of dexamethasone on colony formation was observed in the parental cells. To determine whether these effects of manipulating Brn-3a levels on anchorage-independent growth were dependent upon the altered level of HPV gene expression, we carried out similar experiments in the C-33-derived cell lines. As illustrated in Fig. 7 b, however, all the various cell lines showed a similar ability to form colonies in soft agar, which was not in any way affected by the alteration of Brn-3a or Brn-3b levels, with no significant differences being noted between the various cell lines (p > 0.05 in all cases). Hence, the effects on anchorage-independent growth observed in the SiHa cell lines are correlated with the effect of Brn-3a on HPV gene expression in the same manner as the effect on the growth of cells attached to culture dishes. In this report we have demonstrated for the first time that the manipulation of Brn-3a expression can affect the levels of gene expression from an integrated HPV genome in a transformed cervical cell line. Thus, SiHa cell lines transfected with an antisense Brn-3a expression plasmid showed a clearly reduced expression of HPV. Hence, the expression of the single endogenous HPV genome in SiHa cells appears to depend upon the expression of Brn-3a in these cells such that when Brn-3a expression is reduced, HPV gene expression is correspondingly reduced. This effect evidently parallels our previous finding that the ATGCAATT motif in the HPV URR can be transactivated by Brn-3a in co-transfection assays involving promoter-reporter constructs (22Morris P.J. Theil T. Ring C.J.A. Lillycrop K.A. MoÌroÌy T. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6907-6914Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and extends such transactivation to an endogenous HPV genome. Interestingly, despite the increased Brn-3a levels observed in cells transfected with an expression vector for Brn-3a, the levels of HPV gene expression were not significantly increased, suggesting that HPV gene expression is already maximally stimulated in SiHa cells by the significant level of endogenous Brn-3a in these cells. Interestingly however, HPV gene expression could be reduced by overexpressing Brn-3b in SiHa cells, paralleling the ability of Brn-3b to repress URR activity via the ATGCAATT motif in co-transfection experiments (22Morris P.J. Theil T. Ring C.J.A. Lillycrop K.A. MoÌroÌy T. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6907-6914Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These experiments thus establish Brn-3a expression as being critical for the maintenance of HPV gene transcription in a cervical cancer cell line. In this report we have also demonstrated that the growth characteristics of such a cell line are similarly dependent upon Brn-3a. Thus, the inhibition of Brn-3a expression using an antisense approach led to reduced cellular growth rate, saturation density, and the ability to grow in an anchorage-independent manner. Several lines of evidence indicate that this effect is dependent upon the ability of Brn-3a to modulate HPV gene expression rather than to a direct effect of Brn-3a on the cell. Thus, no effect of reduced Brn-3a levels on cellular growth, saturation density, or anchorage independence was observed in the C-33 cells, which showed a similar reduction in Brn-3a levels but that are not transformed with HPV. Similarly, overexpression of Brn-3b in the SiHa cells, which also reduced HPV gene expression, also resulted in reduced growth rate, saturation density, and anchorage-independent growth, although the effects were not as dramatic as reducing Brn-3a levels, paralleling the less dramatic effect of overexpressing Brn-3b on HPV gene expression. Last, it should be noted that in the C4â1 cervical carcinoma cell line, reduction of E6 and E7 expression with an antisense approach similarly resulted in reduced cellular proliferation (29von Knebel Doeberitz M. Oltersdorf T. Schwarz E. Gissmann L. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 3780-3786PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, simply by manipulating Brn-3a levels it is possible to alter HPV oncogene expression and thereby alter the growth characteristics of the tumor cells in terms not only of growth rate and independence from contact inhibition but, most importantly, in terms of anchorage independence, which is a key requirement for tumorigenesis in vivo. This association of Brn-3a with HPV gene expression and the characteristics of transformed cervical cells is of particular interest in view of our previous finding that Brn-3a is overexpressed in the transformation zone of women with CIN3 compared with women with no detectable cervical abnormality (23Ndisang D. Morris P.J. Chapman C. Ho L. Singer A. Latchman D.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1687-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Such overexpression of Brn-3a is likely therefore, in view of our current results, to play a key role in the elevated HPV gene expression observed in the transformed cells, which is critical for oncogenic transformation. Hence the elevated levels of Brn-3a observed in CIN3 material and in cervical cancer cell lines appear to play a key role in the elevated expression of HPV and thereby in determining the transformed phenotype. These considerations evidently focus attention on the manner in which Brn-3a expression becomes elevated in women with CIN3. In our previous study (23Ndisang D. Morris P.J. Chapman C. Ho L. Singer A. Latchman D.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1687-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) we were able to show that similar elevated expression of Brn-3a occurs in histologically normal segments of the cervix adjacent to the CIN3 region that do not contain detectable HPV DNA or RNA, and we have now extended these findings to show that Brn-3a expression is elevated throughout the cervix in women with CIN3. 2D. Ndisang, unpublished data. This widespread elevation in Brn-3a levels in women with CIN3 may be dependent upon their exposure to an environmental factor that raises Brn-3a levels, or alternatively, could reflect a genetic difference in the Brn-3a gene regulatory region, which results in elevated expression of Brn-3a in these women. In this latter case, this genetic polymorphism would represent a risk factor for cervical cancer similar to having ap53 gene encoding a protein with an arginine at position 72, resulting in enhanced degradation by the HPV E6 protein (6Storey A. Thomas M. Kalita A. Harwood C. Gardiol D. Mantovani F. Breuer J. Leigh I.M. Matlashewsko G. Banks L. Nature. 1998; 393: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Whatever the cause of the elevated level of Brn-3a, however, it is clear that in individuals having such elevation, infection with HPV-16 or HPV-18 will result in the activation of the HPV URR, leading to E6 and E7 expression and cellular alterations in the cervical transformation zone at the junction of the endocervix and the ectocervix, where cervical tumors appear. Hence the elevated levels of Brn-3a, whether caused by environmental or genetic causes, would play a critical role in activation of viral transcription and disease progression, although other factors such as viral type, viral distribution, and cellular susceptibility to transformation would be responsible for the precise localization of the malignant lesions. Most importantly, the fact that the level of HPV gene expression and the abnormal growth characteristics of cervical cancer cells can be reversed by reduction of Brn-3a expression makes this factor an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. This could involve the reduction of endogenous Brn-3a expression either by pharmacological manipulations to reduce the activity of the Brn-3a gene promoter or by the use of gene delivery vectors to deliver Brn-3a antisense constructs similar to those utilized here. To investigate further the potential utility of such forms of therapy, it will be necessary to investigate whether the SiHa cells with reduced Brn-3a levels show reduced tumorigenicity when grown in nude mice and also whether the growth rate of an established tumor can be manipulated in vivo by using viral vectors expressing the antisense strand of the Brn-3agene. It is already clear, however, from the experiments described here that the Brn-3a factor, which is overexpressed in women with CIN3, plays a key role in HPV gene transcription and thereby regulates the growth characteristics of cervical carcinoma cells.

Recent molecular cloning studies have revealed that the PKC family consists of at least 11 distinct isoforms, which have been categorized into three subgroups based on their structure and cofactor requirements. Conventional PKC members (Î±, Î²I, Î²II, and Î³) are activated by diacylglycerol, acidic phospholipid, and Ca2+. Novel PKC members (Î´, Îµ, Î·/L, Î¸, and Î¼) are activated by diacylglycerol and acidic phospholipid but are not dependent on Ca2+. Atypical PKCs (Î¶ and Î»/Î¹) are not stimulated by either diacylglycerol or Ca2+ (4Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). PKC isoforms show distinct tissue, cellular, and subcellular distributions, and individual cells often express several isoforms (5Fisher G.J. Tavakkol A. Leach K. Burns D. Basta P. Loomis C.

The presence of multiple isoforms, their differential expression in mammalian tissues, and their different cofactor requirements suggest that different PKC isoforms may be regulated independently and may have different biological functions in signal transduction processes. protein kinase C kilobase pair(s) base pair(s) chloramphenicol acetyltransferase polymerase chain reaction reverse transcriptase stimulatory protein 1 heat shock factor activator protein-1 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid electrophoretic mobility shift assay 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole Keratinocytes, the predominant cell type in human skin, express at least five PKC isoforms: Î±, Î´, Îµ, Î·, and Î¶ (5Fisher G.J.

In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical staining indicate that PKC-Î· expression in human skin is restricted to keratinocytes undergoing terminal differentiation in the outermost layers of the epidermis (8Koizumi H. Kohno Y. Osada S. Ohno S. Ohkawara A. Kuroki T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 858-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During this terminal differentiation, keratinocytes that express PKC-Î· synthesize insoluble cross-linked envelopes and exude complex lipids that together form the structural basis of the skin barrier (9Ueda E.

If so, regulation of PKC-Î· expression may be critically important for the formation and maintenance of the human skin barrier, which is necessary for life. In view of these considerations, we investigated regulation of PKC-Î· gene expression. In this study we describe the cloning, chromosomal localization, and functional characterization of the human PKC-Î· promoter. A P1 genomic library (Genome Systems Inc., St. Louis, MO) was initially screened using a 125-bp cDNA probe that corresponded to the 5â²-end of the published PKC-Î· partial cDNA (11Bacher N. Zisman Y. Berent E. Livneh E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 126-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The cDNA probe was random-labeled with [Î±-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products, Boston, MA). Prehybridization was performed at 50 Â°C for 1 h; hybridization was then carried out at 50 Â°C overnight, as described (14Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1982: 1-62Google Scholar). This process yielded a positive 80-kb genomic clone designated 7239. This large P1 genomic clone was digested with BamHI and HindIII, and the resulting fragments were subcloned into the BamHI and HindIII sites of cloning vector pZErO-1 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The pZErO-1 subclones were rescreened with the 125-bp probe, yielding 15 positive genomic clones of which two were unique, pTHQ5 and pTHQ15. To obtain additional 5â²-upstream sequence, an EcoRI, XbaI sublibrary was generated from the P1 genomic clone, as described above, and screened with a 110-bp probe corresponding to the 5â²-end of pTHQ15. Twenty-one additional positive clones were identified, of which two were unique, pTHQ16 and pTHQ35. The alignment of these four unique clones was determined by restriction mapping (BamHI,HindIII, EcoRI, and XbaI), PCR analysis, nucleotide sequencing, and Lasergene computer program (DNAStar Inc., Madison, WI). All oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Biomedical Research DNA Core Facilities (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). Nucleic acid sequences of both strands were determined by automated sequencing using an applied Biosystems DNA Sequencer (model 377) or manually by the dideoxy chain termination method (15Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequences were confirmed by manual sequencing using a SequiTherm cycle sequencing kit (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI). Sequences spanning the transcription initiation site and intron-exon borders were subcloned into TA cloning vectors (pCR2.1, Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and subjected to manual sequencing in both directions, as described above. To identify putative cis-regulatory elements, 3.6 kb of 5â²-flanking DNA of the human PKC-Î· gene was analyzed with transcription element search software (Computational Biology and Informatics Laboratory, School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania). Human keratinocyte HaCaT cells and primary human fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Primary human keratinocytes were grown in complete MCDB 153, in a humidified incubator with a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 Â°C. Primary keratinocyte and fibroblast cultures were established from normal human skin, as described previously (5Fisher G.J. Tavakkol A. Leach K. Burns D. Basta P. Loomis C. Griffiths C.E.M.

All culture media were supplemented with penicillin G (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 units/ml). Total RNA was purified from human skin by the guanidinium/cesium trifluoroacetic acid method (16Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar). Total RNA from HaCaT cells, keratinocytes, and fibroblasts was extracted with a commercial kit (RNeasy kit, Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Poly(A)+ RNA was selected using an OligoTex mRNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method described by Schreiber et al. (17Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar), with slight modifications. Briefly, HaCaT keratinocytes, human skin fibroblasts, and human keratinocytes were harvested on ice by scraping in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation (1000 Ã g for 5 min at 4 Â°C) and washed in 10 ml of washing buffer (1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 m NaCl, 1 m KCl, 1 m MgCl2). Cells were washed and suspended in fresh hypotonic buffer (1 m HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 m KCl, 1 m MgCl2, 1m dithiothreitol, 0.3 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), incubated on ice for 10 min, and then homogenized by passing through a 25-gauge needle 10 times. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 4 Â°C and suspended in extraction buffer (1 m HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 5 m NaCl, 1 mMgCl2, 0.25 m EDTA, pH 8.0). The suspension was stirred for 1 h at 4 Â°C and centrifuged at 48,000 Ãg for 30 min at 4 Â°C. Supernatants were stored at â80 Â°C. P1 clone 7239 was labeled with digoxigenin dUTP by nick translation. Labeled probe was combined with sheared human DNA and hybridized to normal metaphase chromosomes, derived from phytohaemaglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes in a hybridizing solution (50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, and 2Ã SSC). Specific hybridization signals were detected by incubating the hybridized slide with fluoresceinated antidigoxigenin antibodies followed by counterstaining with DAPI. In separate experiments, chromosomes were cohybridized with digoxigenin-labeled P1 clone 7239 and a biotin-labeled probe specific for the centromere of chromosomes 14 and 22 (Genome Systems, St. Louis, MO). Probe detection was accomplished by incubating the hybridized slides with fluoresceinated antidigoxigenin antibodies and biotin-labeled avidin followed by counterstaining with DAPI. First strand cDNA was synthesized from HaCaT cell total RNA using an antisense 18-bp primer (H, 5â²-ATCGGTGAGGCAGTGGGG) complementary to the PKC-Î· cDNA sequence spanning positions +704 to +721, 45 bp downstream of the translation initiation codon. HaCaT cell total RNA (1 Î¼g) was denatured by heating at 85 Â°C for 10 min, chilled on ice for 5 min, and then reverse-transcribed at 55 Â°C for 30 min. PCR primers used were as follows: A, 5â²-GAAAAAGAACCTCCCCGCCG; B, 5â²-AGGTCAGTCTACCACGCCTCAGGT;C, 5â²-CACGGCCAGACCCAGCGCTACAAG; D, 5â²-ACGCCCCTGGGGTCCGGAAG; E, 5â²-TCCTGGTTTGAAGCTCGC;F, 5â²-CCTGGAGAAGGGGCGAGT; and G, 5â²-GAACTTCATGGTGCCAGACGACA. PCR amplification was performed by denaturing at 97 Â°C for 1 min, annealing at 52 Â°C for 1 min, and extension at 72 Â°C for 35 cycles for 3 min, followed by incubation for 10 min at 72 Â°C. PCR products were analyzed by 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized with ethidium bromide. Each RT-PCR experiment contained negative controls in which reverse transcriptase was omitted. In all cases, negative control reactions did not yield detectable PCR product, indicating that PCR products were amplified from bona fide PKC-Î· cDNA and not from contaminating genomic DNA. Primer extension assays were performed using an 18-bp antisense primer (I, 5â²-CTCTTGCTTCTCCTCCTG) complementary to the PKC-Î· cDNA sequence spanning positions +249 to +266. The primer was end-labeled with [Î³-32P]ATP (10 Î¼Ci/Î¼l, NEN Life Science Products) by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.). HaCaT cell total RNA (100 Î¼g) was denatured at 85 Â°C for 10 min, chilled on ice for 5 min, and then reverse-transcribed. Reverse transcription was performed at 55 Â°C for 30 min with 200 units of reverse transcriptase (Supertranscript II, Life Technologies, Inc.). Radioactive primer extension products were precipitated with ethanol, resuspended in gel loading buffer (90% formamide, 5 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylencynol), boiled for 5 min, chilled on ice, and loaded on a 6% acrylamide/8 m urea sequencing gel. The gel was transferred to 3 mm Whatman paper, dried, and scanned with a PhosphorImager (Storm 860, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The 5â² ends of primer extension products were determined by sequencing. A sense primer (C, 5â²-CACGGCCAGACCCAGCGCTACAA G-3â²) was 5â² phosphorylated by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.), and then combined with antisense primer (J, 5â²-CCTCAGCGGGCCGGGGAA-3â²) to generate a phosphorylated double-stranded PCR fragment. The PCR fragment was gel-purified and digested with lambda exonuclease (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to generate antisense single-stranded DNA. This antisense single-stranded DNA was then end-labeled, as described above. Total RNA from human skin (100 Î¼g) was hybridized with the end-labeled antisense probe (105 cpm) in 80% formamide, 0.4m sodium chloride, 0.2 m PIPES, pH 6.5, at 55 Â°C overnight. S1 nuclease (100 units, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was then added to the digestion buffer (280 mm sodium chloride, 30 mm sodium acetate, 4.5 mm zinc acetate, and 20 Î¼g/ml of salmon sperm DNA) for 30 min at 37 Â°C. Remaining DNA-RNA hybridized fragments were analyzed as described above for primer extension analysis. EMSAs were performed using a gelshift assay kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with minor modifications. Briefly, synthetic single-stranded oligonucleotides were annealed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.3 m NaCl at 75 Â°C for 15 min and cooled to room temperature overnight. Annealed double-stranded oligonucleotides (â1243 to â1220 and â1772 to â1703) were 5â²-end labeled with [Î³-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.). End-labeled probes were purified using a G50 column (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). End-labeled DNA probes (2 Ã 105 cpm) were incubated with HaCaT cell nuclear extract (5 Î¼g) in a volume of 20 Î¼l containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 6.25 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 Î¼g poly(dl-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min at room temperature. For antibody supershifts, nuclear extracts were incubated with antibody to Ets 1/2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), c-Fos (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), HSF-1 (StressGen, Victoria, BC, Canada), or c-Jun (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) overnight at 4 Â°C prior to addition of labeled probe. Incubation mixtures were subjected to electrophoresis on 4% polyacrylamide gels at 200 V at 4 Â°C using 0.5Ã TBE as electrophoresis buffer. For competition experiments, a 10â50-fold molar excess of cold competitor double-stranded oligonucleotides were preincubated with nuclear extracts for 30 min at room temperature before labeled probe was added. Gels were vacuum-dried and visualized by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). A series of 5â² deletion fragments were cloned upstream of the promoterless pCAT3-Basic CAT reporter gene (Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, 5â² deletion DNA fragments were obtained by PCR using pTHQ35 as a template and a series of primers extending to the 5â² end from position +708 of the PKC-Î· cDNA. These PCR fragments were gel purified and subcloned into a TA cloning vector (pCR2.1, Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Purified pCR2.1 DNA was digested with KpnI and XhoI, and the excised inserts were gel purified and ligated into pCAT3-Basic. Silencer and enhancer-like fragments spanning positions â2207 to â1645 and positions â1641 to â1084, respectively, were amplified by PCR and then inserted into the pBLCAT2 and pCAT3 promoter vectors (Promega). All constructs were subjected to restriction enzyme digestion analysis and nucleotide sequencing to verify correct sequence and orientation. The PKC-Î· enhancer region was mutated using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All mutated clones were sequenced to confirm correct sequences and orientation. Plasmid DNA was introduced into primary human keratinocytes and skin fibroblasts using LipofectAMINE-PLUS (Life Technologies, Inc.). HaCaT cells were transfected using Superfect (Qiagen). Plasmid DNA (5 Î¼g) containing the Î²-galactosidase gene (pCMVÎ², CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) was co-transfected with PKC-Î·/CAT constructs (10 Î¼g) to provide an internal standard for transfection efficiency. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection in extraction buffer (250 mm Tris, pH 7.5) and assayed for Î²-galactosidase activity (18Miller J.H. Expression in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1972Google Scholar). Aliquots containing identical Î²-galactosidase activity were used for each CAT assay (19Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). CAT activity was expressed as the percentage of the total chloramphenicol that was acetylated. Screening of a P1 genomic clone yielded a total of 36 positive clones, four of which were unique (pTHQ5, pTHQ15, pTHQ16, and pTHQ35) (Fig. 1 A). These four unique clones were characterized by restriction enzyme mapping (BamHI, HindIII, EcoRI, andXbaI), PCR screening, and nucleotide sequencing. These four positive clones varied from 3.9 to 5.2 kb in size as determined by 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis. Alignment of the four unique clones yielded 9.4 kb of continuous genomic sequencing, displaying the 5â²-flanking region, exon I, and intron I (Fig. 1 B). Sequencing of the four unique clones (pTHQ5, pTHQ15, PTHQ16, and pTHQ35) in both directions (Fig.1 B) yielded 4.2 kb of sequence upstream of the 5â² end of the published PKC-Î· cDNA (Fig. 2). This upstream region lacked canonical TATA and CAAT boxes commonly found within 100 bp upstream of transcription initiation sites. The 5â²-upstream sequences did contain several putativecis-acting regulatory elements. These included consensus binding sites for transcription factors Sp1 (20Kadonaga J.T. Jones K.A. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 20-23Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (878) Google Scholar), AP-1 (21Faisst S. Meyer S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 20: 3-26Crossref Scopus (938) Google Scholar), the Ets family (22Wasylyk B. Hahn S.L. Giovane A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 23Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), and others (Fig. 2). An exon 1/intron 1 junction was identified 363 bp downstream from the ATG translation start site, where the genomic sequence diverged from the PKC-Î· cDNA sequence (Fig.2). The first exon encodes 121 amino acids (Fig. 2). Further sequencing of exon 1 in the 3â² direction yielded no cDNA sequences. It follows that the second exon was separated by at least 4.7-kb intronic sequences. Chromosomal fluorescent in situ hybridization using PKC-Î· P1 clone 7239 as probe resulted in specific labeling of the long arm of a group D chromosome (Fig. 3). This chromosome was tentatively identified as number 14 based on DAPI staining. This identification was confirmed by double staining with the P1 clone probe and a biotin-labeled probe that was specific for the centromeres of chromosomes 14 and 22. This double staining resulted in specific labeling of the centromere of chromosome 14 in red and the long arm in green (Fig. 3). Based on ten independent measurements, the PKC-Î· hybridization signal was located 47% of the distance from the centromere to the telomere of chromosome arm 14q, an area that corresponds to the interface between bands 14q22â23. As stated above, the proximal promoter region of the PKC-Î· gene lacked sequences indicative of transcription initiation sites. For this reason, several complementary approaches were taken to determine the transcription start site. The first approach utilized RT-PCR to delineate the region of transcription initiation. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from HaCaT cell total RNA using antisense primer H (Fig.4), which hybridized 45 bp downstream of the translation initiation site. This first strand cDNA was then used as a template for PCR amplification with six primer pairs consisting of a common antisense primer G (Fig. 4) and a series of sense primers located 334 bp to 974 bp upstream fromG (Fig. 4). PCR amplification using the same six primer pairs with cloned PKC-Î· genomic DNA as template served as positive control. PCR products of the expected sizes were observed with all six primer pairs using PKC-Î· DNA as template (Fig. 4). RT-PCR products of the expected sizes were also observed with primer pairsG/F (334 bp), G/E (484 bp), and G/D (588 bp) (Fig. 4). In contrast, no RT-PCR products were found with primer pairs G/C (705 bp), G/B (799 bp), or G/A(974 bp) (Fig. 4), indicating that genomic sequences contained within primers A-C were not present in the PKC-Î· cDNA. These data indicate that the 5â² end of the PKC-Î· transcript lies within the 93-bp region between primers D and C. We next employed primer extension analysis to narrow down the location of the transcription initiation site. Antisense primer I(Fig. 5 A), which annealed 279 bp downstream of primer C (Fig. 4), was end-labeled and annealed to HaCaT cell total RNA and extended by Superscript II reverse transcriptase. Two major primer extension products were observed, approximately 260 bp in length (Fig. 5 B, lane 3). No extended products were observed with yeast tRNA as template, a control for the specificity of primer hybridization (Fig.5 B, lane 2). Sequence analysis revealed that the two alternative transcription start sites were separated by 12 nucleotides (Fig. 5 C). To confirm the primer extension results, we performed S1 nuclease mapping using a probe, generated with antisense primer J(Fig. 3 A) and sense primer C (Fig. 4), that extended 26 nucleotides upstream of the distal transcription start site identified by primer extension analysis. Two major S1 nuclease-protected fragments of 431 and 418 nucleotides were observed with HaCaT cell total RNA as template (Fig. 5 D, lane 4). The sizes of these two protected fragments exactly matched the expected transcription start sites identified by primer extension. No protected fragments were observed using yeast tRNA as template (Fig.5 D, lane 3). Taken together, the above RT-PCR, primer extension, and S1 nuclease mapping data demonstrate that the transcription initiation site of the human PKC-Î· gene is located approximately 650 bp upstream from the ATG translation initiation site. In human skin in vivo, PKC-Î· is expressed in epidermal keratinocytes but not in dermal fibroblasts (5Fisher G.J. Tavakkol A. Leach K. Burns D. Basta P. Loomis C. Griffiths C.E.M. Cooper K.D. Reynolds N.J. Elder J.T. Livneh E. Voorhees J.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 553-559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RT-PCR detected PKC-Î· transcripts in human skin, primary cultured human skin keratinocytes, and human keratinocyte HaCaT cells but not in human skin fibroblasts (Fig. 6 A). We therefore examined whether the 5â²-flanking region of the PKC-Î· gene also displayed cell type-specific regulation. The full-length 5â²-flanking sequence of the PKC-Î· gene (â3458 to +708) was inserted into the promoterless pCAT3-Basic reporter gene and transiently transfected into primary human keratinocytes, human keratinocyte HaCaT cells, and human skin fibroblasts. Transient transfection of the pCAT3-Control reporter plasmid (containing the SV40 promoter and SV40 enhancer) was used as positive control. The promoterless pCAT3-Basic reporter gene was unable to drive expression of CAT activity, whereas the pCAT3-Control reporter gene expressed high levels of CAT activity in each of the three cell types (Fig. 6 B). The PKC-Î· gene reporter construct displayed significant activity in keratinocytes and HaCaT cells (at least 10-fold higher than the promoterless CAT expression vector) but was inactive in fibroblasts (Fig.6 B). These data demonstrate that the upstream region of the PKC-Î· gene contains regulatory elements sufficient to drive cell type-specific transcription. To identify cis-acting regulatory elements in the 5â²-flanking region of the PKC-Î· gene, we constructed a series of 5â² deletion CAT expression vectors and transiently transfected them into primary keratinocytes and keratinocyte HaCaT cells (Fig.7). The promoter activities of the various constructs obtained from 6 to 11 independent experiments in HaCaT cells are summarized in Fig. 7. Similar data were obtained for primary keratinocytes (data not shown). All CAT constructs were also expressed in human skin fibroblasts but were found to be inactive (data not shown). As described above (Fig. 6 B), the largest construct, a 4.1-kb fragment extending from â3458 to +708 (Fig. 7, construct 83CN), displayed significant CAT activity. The activity of this construct was assigned a relative level of 1.0. 5â² deletion of 1251 bp (Fig. 7, construct 82CN) did not significantly alter CAT a"

The results presented here suggest that the pyrimidine nucleotide salvage pathway may operate in the nucleus. This localization may have implications in the regulation of nucleoside and nucleotide metabolism and nucleic acid biosynthesis. Pyrimidine nucleotides are synthesized either de novoor by salvage pathways from preformed pyrimidine compounds. The pyrimidine salvage pathways serve two different functions. One is to scavenge pyrimidine compounds for nucleotide synthesis. The other is degradative and leads to the generation of compounds that serve as carbon and nitrogen sources. Cytosine, cytidine, and deoxycytidylate deaminases belong to the family of enzymes that deaminate mononucleotide substrates and are involved in maintenance of the pyrimidine nucleotide pool in the cell (1Nygaard P. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1986; 195: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). They catalyze the irreversible hydrolytic deamination of cytosine, cytidine and deoxycytidine and several of their therapeutically useful analogues to the corresponding uridine derivative. Based on protein sequence alignment of this family of enzymes and the crystal structure ofEscherichia coli cytidine deaminase (2Betts L. Xiang S. Short S.A. Wolfenden R. Carter C.W. J. Mol.

The cysteine/histidine and two cysteine residues are involved in zinc binding at the active site, a requirement for catalytic activity, and the glutamine residue is involved in proton shuttling during catalysis (2Betts L.

The E. coli enzyme is a homodimer with two active sites formed by contributions from each monomer (2Betts L. Xiang S. Short S.A. Wolfenden R. Carter C.W. J. Mol.

A likely explanation for this is that the enzyme depletes both cytidine and deoxycytidine pools required for DNA synthesis (16BÃ¸yum A. LÃ¸vhaug D. Seeburg E. Nordlie E.M. Exp.

It has also been suggested that growth suppression might be by a receptor-mediated process triggered by cytidine deaminase (17Gran C. BÃ¸yum A. Johansen R.F. LÃ¸vhaug D. Seeberg E.C. Blood. 1998; 91: 4127-4135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cytidine deaminase plays an important role in the metabolism of a number of antitumoral and antiviral cytosine nucleoside analogues, leading to their pharmacological inactivation (18MuÌller W.E.G.

Although the enzymes are generally considered to be cytoplasmic in intracellular localization, in the sequence of HCDA, we identified two clusters of basic amino acids near the amino terminus with similarity to the classical bipartite nuclear localization signal. Nuclear localization signals (NLSs) are short regions within some proteins that direct import into the nucleus (21Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem.

In general, they contain a high content of the basic amino acids arginine and lysine and may contain residues, such as proline, that disrupt helical domains (22Chelsky D. Ralph R. Jonak G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2487-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). NLSs, unlike other signal sequences, can be located anywhere in the primary sequence of the protein. The best studied NLS is that found within the SV40 large T-antigen, PKKKRKV (23Kalderon D. Richardson W.D. Markham A.F. Smith A.E. Nature. 1984; 311: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar), and defines the first class of NLS known as monopartite NLSs. A second class of NLS, found to be the most common, is the bipartite NLS. This signal consists of two runs of basic amino acids separated by a spacer region (21Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar). The classic example of this type of NLS is found within the Xenopus protein nucleoplasmin (24Dingwall C. Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Roberts B. Richardson W.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 841-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Nuclear proteins that carry a basic NLS (mono- or bipartite) are recognized by the heterodimeric importin receptor, composed of importin Î± and importin Î² subunits (25GoÌrlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of yeast importin Î± was recently determined, and two sites that can accommodate the NLS peptides within a helical surface groove were identified (26Conti E. Uy M. Leighton L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). The identification of a putative bipartite NLS in HCDA led us to consider whether this enzyme might be nuclear in its localization. We have gone on to show this, and further, that HCDA does contain a functional nuclear localization signal. Other members of this family of enzymes contain similar sequences. These studies suggest that the nuclear localization of HCDA may be important in providing substrate for RNA biosynthesis, particularly in times of high metabolic activity. An analogous role and nuclear localization can be envisaged in dCMP deaminase and other members of this enzyme family that have an NLS. A human heart cDNA library (1 Ã 106 recombinants) and a human genomic library (1.5 Ã 106 recombinants) were screened using a 32P-labeled oligo probe derived from the HCDA cDNA sequence (27LaliberteÌ J. Momparler R.L. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5401-5407PubMed Google Scholar) following standard procedure. Positive clones were plaque purified, and phage DNA was isolated as described previously (28Maniatis T. Hraidson R.C. Lacy E. Lauer J. O'Connell C. Quon D. Sim G.K. Efstratiadis A.

Automated DNA sequencing was carried out using the Perkin-Elmer d-rhodamine cycle sequencing termination kit in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Wild-type and amino-terminal deletion 3â²FLAG-tagged HCDA constructs (wild-type HCDA and N-10 HCDA) for intracellular localization were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) from HCDA cDNA using primers 5HindHCD or 5HindHCD-10 and 3BamFLAGHCD and were cloned into pCMV-blue (Pharmingen) at the HindIII/BamHI sites. Plasmids glutathione S-transferase (GST) and SV40 GST, encoding GST and the SV40 NLS (PKKKRKV) fused to the amino terminus of GST were created by cloning PCR products amplified from the plasmid pGEX4T3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using primers 5HindGST or 5SV40GST and 3PstFLAG-GST into pCMV-blue (Pharmingen) at theHindIII/PstI sites. pCMV-blue encoding amino acids 1â30 of HCDA encompassing the putative NLS of HCDA fused to the amino terminus of GST-FLAG was constructed by inserting the 99-base pair PCR product, amplified from HCDA cDNA with primers 5EcoRVHCDA and 3NotIHCDA, in-frame with GST into EcoRV/NotI sites immediately upstream of GST in the pCMV-blue GST construct thereby creating HCDA (1Nygaard P.

The pET 14b vector (Novagen) was used for expression of proteins in E. coli. The FLAG-tagged HCDA insert was produced by PCR from the cDNA sequence using oligonucleotides 5NcoHCD and 3BamFLAGHCD using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). The PCR product was digested with NcoI and BamHI, ligated into pET14b/NcoI/BamHI, and transformed into E. coli JM109 cells, and the DNA sequence of the insert was verified (ABI 377 automated sequencing). HCDA point mutations were created by PCR using mutagenic oligonucleotides (C8A and C14A) and using the splicing by overlap extension technique. Complementing mutagenic oligonucleotides (e.g. E67A and E67A(R)) were used to generate two overlapping PCR products, using the upstream primer 5NcoHCD and the downstream primer 3BamFLAGHCD. The overlapping products were isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis and spliced in a further round of PCR. The product was digested and directionally cloned as described above. For protein expression, plasmids were retransformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells. Cells were grown to an absorbance of 0.6 and induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-Î²-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 30 Â°C. FLAG-tagged HCDA was purified on a M2-FLAG affinity column (Eastman Kodak Co.) following the instructions of the manufacturer. Protein content was assayed using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). About 2 Ã 108 HeLa cells were resuspended in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 8.0 (5Ã packed cell volume), containing 10 mmKCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 1% Triton. The lysate was sonicated on ice for 2 min and centrifuged at 33, 000 rpm for 20 min. Crystalline ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to 70% while being stirred at 4 Â°C. The precipitate was allowed to stand at 4 Â°C for 30 min. The precipitate was centrifuged at 33,000 rpm for 30 min, redissolved in 2 ml of 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm EDTA and 10% glycerol, and dialyzed at 4 Â°C against the same buffer. A 20-Î¼l sample was resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Western blotting as described below. 10 mg of FLAG-tagged HCDA was purified on an M2-FLAG affinity column as described above and coupled to 1 ml of cyanogen bromide-agarose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The HCDA-coupled cyanogen bromide-agarose column was mixed with 1 ml of HCDA rabbit antiserum at 4 Â°C overnight with gentle agitation. The column was then washed with 15 ml of 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 8.0, followed by 15 ml of 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm KCl. HCDA antibody was then eluted with three volumes of 3 ml of 0.1m glycine, pH 3.5, dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and concentrated with PEG 6000. The affinity purified antiserum was tested on Western blots containing HeLa cell extract and purified recombinant FLAG-tagged HCDA. For immunoblot analysis, proteins were separated on 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (DuPont), and probed with the affinity-purified HCDA antiserum at 1:100 dilution, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) at 1:3000 dilution. Immunocomplexes were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Yeast two-hybrid vectors pJG4â5, pSB202 (derived from pEG202 as described (30Navaratnam N.

Mattaj.EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites were created by PCR using primers 5EcoRI-imp Î± and 3XhoI-imp Î±, 5EcoRI-imp Î² and 3XhoI-imp Î², and 5EcoRI-trans and 3XhoI-trans plus importin Î±, importin Î², and transportin, cloned into pJG4â5. HCDA was PCR-amplified from HCDA cDNA with primers 5BamHCD and 3SalHCD and cloned in frame into pSB202BamHI/SalI. Liquid Î²-galactosidase assays usingÎ¿-nitrophenyl-Î²-d-galactopyranoside as a substrate were carried out as described for theCLONTECH Matchmaker two-hybrid system (PT265â1) by the manufacturer. COS-7, CCL13, HepG2, and HeLa cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 Â°C with a 5% CO2atmosphere. Cells were seeded onto 13-mm round coverslips (for immunofluorescence) at about 9 Ã 104 cells per coverslip in 24-well dishes, or onto 100-mm dishes (for cell labeling and immunoprecipitation) at about 4 Ã 105 cells per dish, 18 h before transfection. Cells were transfected with 10 Î¼g of purified plasmid DNA per 100-mm dish using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. The cells were incubated with the precipitate overnight, followed by a 2-min incubation with PBS containing 10% (v/v) dimethylsulphoxide. 48 h after transfection, cells were fixed for immunofluorescence or radioactively labeled before harvesting and immunoprecipitation. Cells on coverslips were fixed for 15 min in 100% methanol or 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Immunostaining was performed by incubating fixed cells for 1 h at room temperature with 40 Î¼g anti-flag M2Ab (Anachem; 1:250 in PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin) or anti-HCDA affinity purified antibody (1:50 in PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin), followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG or FITC-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (DAKO; 1:50 in PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin). Coverslips were incubated for about 5 s in 1 Î¼g/ml 4â²,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma), rinsed in PBS and mounted on glass slides with Aquamount improved (BDH). Slides were visualized under a Leica DMRB fluorescence microscope. 48 h post transfection cells were washed with PBS and incubated with 100 Î¼Ci of [35S]methionine in 5 ml of methionine-free medium. After 3 h of incubation, cells were washed with PBS, harvested in PBS, 2 mm EDTA, and lysed with 1 ml of PBS containing 0.5% Triton and protease inhibitors. The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatants were collected and immunoprecipitated with 25 Î¼l of M2FLAG affinity resin (Kodak) for 1 h at 4 Â°C. The immunoprecipitates were washed 5Ã PBS and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. HCDA is a homotetramer, previously identified as containing one active site zinc atom per monomeric subunit (32Vincenzetti S. Cambi A. Neuhard J. Garattini E. Vita A. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 33Vincenzetti S. Angeletti M. Lupidi G. Cambi A. Natalini P. Vita A. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1997; 42: 477-486PubMed Google Scholar). By amino acid sequence comparison of CDA from different species and the crystal structure of E. coli cytidine deaminase a conserved active site signature was identified ((C/H)XE- - - -PCXXC) (2Betts L. Xiang S. Short S.A. Wolfenden R. Carter C.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 635-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 3Navaratnam N. Shah R. Patel D. Fay V. Scott J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The cysteine/histidine and two cysteine residues are involved in zinc coordination at the active site, which is a requirement for catalytic activity. The glutamine residue is involved in proton shuttling during catalysis, and the proline residue plays a role in the orientation of the amino group to be removed by hydration (2Betts L. Xiang S. Short S.A. Wolfenden R. Carter C.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 635-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 35Xiang S. Short S.A. Wolfendon R. Carter Jr., C.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1335-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The conserved amino acid residues of the active site signature in HCDA, Cys-65, Glu-67, Pro-98, Cys-99, and Cys-102 were each mutated to alanine. Cys-14 and Cys-59, which are not thought to be involved in CDA catalysis, were also each mutated to alanine. FLAG-tagged wild-type HCDA and point mutants, generated by PCR, were expressed in E. coli, and the expressed protein was purified on a FLAG affinity column. Proteins were assayed for cytidine deaminase activity by a spectrophotometric assay as described (27LaliberteÌ J. Momparler R.L. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5401-5407PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of the active site residues completely abolished CDA activity, whereas C14A and C59A had no effect on enzyme activity (Table I). Mutational analysis of the key conserved amino acid residues of the presumed active site has therefore supported their importance in the function of the HCDA enzyme, as has previously been demonstrated for E. coli cytidine deaminase and the editing cytidine deaminase, APOBEC-1 (36Smith A.A. Carlow D.C. Wolfenden R. Short S.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6468-6474Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 37Navaratnam N. Bhattacharya S. Fujino T. Patel D. Jarmuz A.L. Scott J. Cell. 1995; 81: 187-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Mutagenic studies are often prone to questions concerning protein stability and folding. Mutagenesis of the active site amino acid residues may have resulted in misfolding of the enzyme and hence loss of activity.Table IMutational analysis of the HCDA active siteHCDA mutantPercentage activity%Wild-type100C14A94.5C59A96.5C65A0E67A0P98A0C99A0C102A0Relative activities of bacterially expressed, FLAG-affinity purified, HCDA wild-type and point mutants.

The HCDA antiserum was affinity purified and used on Western blots as well as immunofluorescence analysis. The antibody readily reacted with recombinant HCDA, with a molecular mass of 17.1 kDa, and with one single species of the expected HCDA molecular mass (â¼16 kDa) from a crude extract of HeLa cells (Fig. 1). This demonstrated that the antibody was highly specific for HCDA. To look at the intracellular localization of endogenous HCDA, we performed indirect immunofluorescence experiments using the affinity purified anti-HCDA antibody on a variety of cell lines: HeLa (Fig.2 A), COS7 (Fig.2 B), CCL13, and HepG2 (data not shown). A similar staining pattern was observed in all of the cell lines analyzed. A strong punctate nuclear stain accompanied by a diffuse cytoplasmic stain (Fig.2, A and B, row c).

https://openalex.org/W1987068390,"Human (H-) CCR5 is the primary coreceptor for ENV-mediated fusion by R5 strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1, whereas mouse (M-) CCR5 lacks this function. An array of 23 H/M-CCR5 hybrids containing increasing amounts of H-CCR5 extending from the N terminus generated by random chimeragenesis had a biphasic pattern of coreceptor activity with JRFL and 89.6, revealing active regions in the N-terminal extracellular domain (N-ED) and at the junction of cytoplasmic loop 3. The M-CCR5 mutant in which divergent residues were replaced with the corresponding H-CCR5 N-ED sequence (NyYTsE) gained coreceptor function in fusion but not infection experiments. A M-CCR5 double mutant with substitution of human sequences for divergent residues from the N-ED and cytoplasmic loop 3 had augmented coreceptor activity in fusion assays and gain of function in infection experiments. The SIV-251 ENV utilized H- and M-CCR5 and variants. Flow cytometric analysis of M-CCR5 mutants and bifunctional receptors composed of CD4 domains fused to M-CCR5 mutants excluded the possibility that differences in coreceptor activity resulted from variations in cell surface expression. These results demonstrate that the coreceptor activity of the H-CCR5 N-ED is modulated by intracellular residues, illustrating the complexity of CCR5 requirements for interaction with ENV."

Haemost. 1991; 66: 6-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), a single chain glycoprotein of 42 kDa and a member of the Kunitz family of serine protease inhibitors. TFPI contains an acidic N terminus, followed by three tandemly repeated Kunitz-type inhibition domains, and a basic C-terminal tail (8Wun T.C. Kretzmer K.K. Girard T.J. Miletich J.P. Broze G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6001-6004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis has revealed that the first Kunitz domain binds to FVIIa and that the second Kunitz domain interacts with the active site of FXa (9Girard T.J. Warren L.A. Novotny W.F. Likert K.M. Brown S.G. Miletich J.P. Broze Jr., G.J. Nature. 1989; 338: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). No such functions could be attributed to the third Kunitz domain (10Petersen L.C. BjoÌrn S.E. Olsen O.H. Nordfang O. Norris F. Norris K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 310-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Yet, various interactions have been ascribed to this domain, e.g. with lipoproteins and heparin, but their importance for the inhibitory function of TFPI is not clear (11Valentin S. Nordfang O. Bregengard C. Wildgoose P. Blood Coag. Fibrinol. 1993; 4: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 12Enjyoji K. Miyata T. Kamikubo Y. Kato H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5725-5735Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the basic C-terminal region of TFPI (residues 240â276) has been shown to play a crucial role in the anticoagulant activity of this inhibitor (13Nordfang O. BjoÌrn S.E. Valentin S. Nielsen L.S. Wildgoose P. Beck T.C. Hedner U. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10371-10376Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 14Wesselschmidt R. Likert K. Girard T. Wun T.C. Broze G.J. Blood. 1992; 79: 2004-2010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite numerous studies, it remains unclear how this basic C terminus modulates the anticoagulant activity of TFPI (15Hamamoto T. Yamamoto M. Nordfang O. Petersen J.G. Foster D.C. Kisiel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8704-8710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Huang Z.F. Wun T.C. Broze Jr., G.J. J. Biol.

Haemost. 1998; 80: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). TFPI inhibits the generation of FXa and FIXa by the TFÂ·FVIIa complex in a unique, two-step reaction (20Broze G.J. Warren L.A. Novotny W.F. Higuchi D.A. Girard J.J. Miletich J.P. Blood. 1988; 71: 335-343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). First, TFPI binds Ca2+independently to FXa, thereby inhibiting the FXa catalytic activity (9Girard T.J. Warren L.A. Novotny W.F. Likert K.M. Brown S.G. Miletich J.P. Broze Jr., G.J. Nature. 1989; 338: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). In a second step, the FXaÂ·TFPI complex binds in a Ca2+-dependent way to TFÂ·FVIIa. This results in the formation of the quaternary complex TFÂ·FVIIaÂ·FXaÂ·TFPI, in which the proteolytic activity of the TFÂ·FVIIa complex is fully neutralized. The effect of TFPI on TFÂ·FVIIa activity in the absence of FXa is negligible (21Callander N.S. Rao L.V. Nordfang O. Sandset P.M. Warn-Cramer B. Rapaport S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 876-882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Baugh R.J. Broze Jr., G.J. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4378-4386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), implying that the true inhibitor of TFÂ·FVIIa activity is the FXaÂ·TFPI complex. The rate of complex formation of FXa and TFPI is enhanced by negatively charged phospholipids for full-length TFPI (TFPIFL) but not for TFPI1â161, a truncated variant lacking the third Kunitz domain and the potential phospholipid binding C-terminal tail (16Huang Z.F. Wun T.C. Broze Jr., G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26950-26955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lindhout T. Franssen J. Willems G.M. Thromb. Haemost. 1995; 74: 910-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recently (24Willems G.M. Janssen M. Salemink I. Wun T.C. Lindhout T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3321-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that TFPIFL in complex with FXa has a much higher affinity for anionic phospholipid membranes compared with that of either protein alone. It is well recognized that the binding of blood coagulation enzymes as well as their cofactors and substrates to membranes containing anionic phospholipids may result in an immense increase of the catalytic efficiency of these enzymes. On the other hand, excess binding sites could cause a lowering of both solution concentration and surface density of the reactants (25Nesheim M.E. Tracy R.P. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1447-1453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26van Rijn J.L. Govers-Riemslag J.W. Zwaal R.F. Rosing J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4557-4564Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), resulting in a decrease of reaction rates. Previous studies (17Jesty J. Wun T.C. Lorenz A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12686-12694Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 22Baugh R.J. Broze Jr., G.J. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol.

Haemost. 1995; 74: 910-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) did not reveal a stimulatory or interfering effect of anionic phospholipids on the complex formation between FXaÂ·TFPI and TFÂ·FVIIa. These studies, however, were performed in the presence of excess phospholipid vesicles. It remains unclear what the role is of lipid-protein interactions and of the TFPI C terminus when TF is embedded in a macroscopic phospholipid membrane. Answering these questions could provide insight in the role of (TF-bearing) cell membranes in the regulation of the TFÂ·FVIIa-catalyzed initiation of the blood coagulation process. To mimic the processes occurring at TF-bearing cell surfaces as closely as possible, we made use of TF embedded in a macroscopic phospholipid surface to which the reactants were supplied under well defined flow conditions. This approach allows a quantitative study of the kinetics of inhibition of TFÂ·FVIIa-catalyzed FX activation as a function of the phospholipid composition of the membrane and the phospholipid-binding properties of the FXaÂ·TFPI complex. Our study showed that negatively charged phospholipid surfaces act as a safety net in the sense that FXaÂ·TFPIFL complexes readily bind to the surface. These phospholipid-bound FXaÂ·TFPIFLcomplexes then show a potent inhibitory activity against TFÂ·FVIIa present at the same membrane. Bovine serum albumin (BSA, essentially fatty acid-free) was obtained from Sigma. The chromogenic substrate for FXa, S2765, was purchased from Chromogenix (MoÌlndal, Sweden). 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PC) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine (PS) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). All other reagents used were of analytical grade. Human FX was purified according to Mertens et al.(27Mertens K. Bertina R.M. Biochem. J. 1980; 185: 647-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Human FXa was prepared by activation of purified FX with the FX activating protein from Russell's viper venom (Sigma) and isolated as was described for bovine FXa (28Lindhout M.J. Kop-Klaassen B.H. Hemker H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 533: 327-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The molar concentration was determined by active site titration with p-nitrophenylp-guanidinobenzoate hydrochloride (29Smith R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2418-2423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant human TFPIFL, produced in Escherichia coli (30Diaz-Collier J.A. Palmier M.O. Kretzmer K.K. Bishop B.F. Combs R.G.

Haemost. 1994; 71: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), was kindly supplied by Searle/Chiron (Emeryville, CA). This recombinant TFPIFL preparation, not being glycosylated, is very similar to the native highly glycosylated protein expressed in mammalian cells with respect to anticoagulant activity (16Huang Z.F. Wun T.C. Broze Jr., G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26950-26955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Diaz-Collier J.A. Palmier M.O. Kretzmer K.K. Bishop B.F. Combs R.G. Obukowicz M.G.

The C-terminal truncated TFPI preparation was kindly supplied by Dr. O. Nordfang (Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark). TFPI1â161 was expressed inSaccharomyces cerevisiae and purified as described previously (31Petersen J.G. Meyn G. Rasmussen J.S. Petersen J. BjoÌrn S.E. Jonassen I. Christiansen L. Nordfang O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13344-13351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molar concentrations of the TFPI preparations were determined by titration with known amounts of FXa (18Lindhout T. Willems G.M. Blezer R. Hemker H.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Recombinant human TF was a kind gift of Dr. Y. Nemerson (Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY). Recombinant FVIIa was a kind gift of Dr. U. Hedner (Novo Nordisk). Recombinant human TF, 20 and 100 nm, was reconstituted with 2 mm PSPC (25 mol% PS/75 mol% PC) and 2 mm PC (100 mol% PC), respectively, usingn-octyl-Î²-d-glucopyranoside (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) solubilization and dialysis as described (32Bach R. Gentry R. Nemerson Y. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4007-4020Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Because the TF is randomly oriented in the reconstituted vesicles, we considered the effective TF concentration to be 50% of the total concentration present in the reconstituted preparation (32Bach R. Gentry R. Nemerson Y. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4007-4020Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Calculations were therefore based on a TF:phospholipid ratio of 1:20 Ã 104 and 1:4 Ã 104 for PSPC and PC, respectively. The set-up used in the present study is a modification of the one described previously (33Willems G.M. Giesen P.L. Hermens W.T. Blood. 1993; 82: 497-504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In short, a cylinder (height 12 mm, width 16 mm) made of polyethylene terephthalate (PETP; AKZO Plastics, Amersloont, The Netherlands), containing four tiny magnets, was mounted on a motor with servo-controlled rotation speed. A cylindrical vessel is placed on top of the motor-containing holder, such that the cylinder rotates close to the glass bottom of the vessel. A glass coverslip (Menzel GlaÌser, Braunschweig, Germany) with a diameter of 20 mm is attached to another PETP cylinder (height 2 mm, width 12 mm), also containing four magnets. This second cylinder fits into a thin PETP ring, mounted in the vessel, which guides the movements of the rotating disc. A stationary baffle was immersed in the solution (3 ml) during the experiments to establish a well defined flow pattern. The glass coverslips of the rotating discs were made hydrophilic as described previously (34Billy D. Speijer H. Willems G.M. Hemker H.C. Lindhout T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1029-1034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In order to apply a TF-containing lipid bilayer, the rotating discs (63 rad/s) were exposed for 30 min to reconstituted vesicles in Tris buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, and 175 mm NaCl), with a final phospholipid-concentration of 20 Î¼m. Fluid phase vesicles were removed by flushing for 5 min with TBSA-CaCl2 buffer (Tris buffer containing 3 mm CaCl2 and 1 mg/ml BSA) at a rate of 10 ml/min using a Minipuls II pump (Gilson, Villiers-le-Bel, France). Finally the disc was transported, without exposing the lipid surface to an air-buffer interface, to a second vessel that had been pretreated for 1 h with 20 mg/ml BSA in Tris buffer. Before placing the coated disc in this second vessel, the high content BSA Tris buffer was replaced by TBSA-CaCl2 buffer. All preparations were performed at 37 Â°C. The effective TF surface density was 2.5 fmol/cm2 and 12.5 fmol/cm2 for PSPC and PC, respectively, as calculated on the basis of a phospholipid surface density of 0.5 nmol/cm2 and TF:phospholipid ratios of 1:20 Ã 104 or 1:4 Ã 104. The disc surface area was 3.14 cm2; the theoretical amount of TF available at the surface is therefore 7.8 and 39 fmol for PSPC and PC, respectively. Throughout this paper, TFÂ·PSPC and TFÂ·PC refer to the planar surfaces thus obtained. Discs coated with TFÂ·PSPC or TFÂ·PC were spun at 63 rad/s in 3 ml TBSA-CaCl2 buffer. FVIIa (1 nm) was added and incubated with the spinning disc for 5 min. The TFÂ·FVIIa activity was then assessed from FXa generation following the addition of FX (100 nm). Timed samples were taken from the reaction mixture and collected into polystyrene cuvettes containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 175 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mg/ml BSA, (total volume 450 Î¼l). To determine the amount of FXa present, 50 Î¼l of 3 mm chromogenic substrate S2765 was added to the cuvette, and the conversion of the chromogenic substrate was followed at 37 Â°C on a dual wavelength spectrophotometer at 405 nm (reference wavelength 500 nm). The FXa concentrations were calculated from standard curves obtained with known amounts of the enzyme. The TF containing phospholipid surface of the rotating disc could be reused after flushing with TBSA-EDTA buffer (20 mmEDTA) for 5 min at 10 ml/min, followed by a rinse with TBSA-CaCl2 buffer (5 min at 10 ml/min). All procedures were performed at 37 Â°C and unless otherwise mentioned, at an angular velocity of 63 rad/s. All inhibition experiments were carried out with preformed FXaÂ·TFPI complexes. These complexes were prepared by incubating FXa and TFPI at equimolar concentrations (50 nm) for 30 min at 37 Â°C in TBSA-CaCl2 buffer. This incubation time was sufficiently long to obtain an equilibrium in complex formation (95% of FXa in complex), as was established by measuring the free FXa concentration with chromogenic substrate S2765. The inhibitory activity of FXaÂ·TFPI was assessed in two different ways. The first method was by preincubating TFÂ·PSPC or TFÂ·PC with FVIIa (1 nm) for 5 min, then adding FX (100 nm) in the presence of various concentrations of FXaÂ·TFPI and subsequently assaying the timed samples taken from the vessel for FXa activity. Under these conditions, fluid phase inhibitor complex is assumed to be in equilibrium with surface-bound FXaÂ·TFPI. The second method was by preincubating TFÂ·PSPC or TFÂ·PC for 10 min with 0.4 nm FXaÂ·TFPI, in the absence of FVIIa, and then depleting the solution of inhibitor complex by flushing for various time intervals with TBSA-CaCl2 buffer. Subsequently, FX activation was started by adding FX (100 nm) and FVIIa (1 nm). Timed samples were taken and assayed for FXa activity as described above. As the catalytic efficiency of FVIIa in complex with TF is several orders of magnitude higher than that of free FVIIa, the observed FX generation rate, Vobs, reflects the formation of the binary TFÂ·FVIIa complex and is described by the formula shown in Equation 1, Vobs=Vmax[FVIIa]/([FVIIa]+Kd),(Eq. 1) with [FVIIa] the free FVIIa concentration,Kd the apparent dissociation constant of the TFÂ·FVIIa complex, and Vmax the FXa generation rate at saturating FVIIa concentrations. As the amount of TF present in the system is negligible compared with the concentration of added FVIIa, [FVIIa] equals the total FVIIa concentration. The parametersVmax and Kd were determined by least squares fitting of Equation 1 to the measurements ofVobs. Measurements of the observed rate of FXa generation, Vobs, were analyzed using the Michaelis-Menten formula as shown in Equation 2, Vobs=Vmax[FX]/([FX]+Km(app)),(Eq. 2) which relates Vobs toVmax the conversion rate at saturating FX concentrations, [FX] the FX concentration, andKm(app) the apparent Michaelis constant. The parameters Vmax andKm(app) were determined by least squares fitting of Equation 2 to the measurements ofVobs. It should be noted that the substrate transport from the bulk solution to the disc surface depends on the concentration gradient between bulk and the solution, immediately adjacent to the catalytic surface. To what extent this substrate depletion near the surface causes an underestimation of the trueKm value depends on the ratio of substrate conversion over the transport-limited rate of substrate supply (33Willems G.M. Giesen P.L. Hermens W.T. Blood. 1993; 82: 497-504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The decrease in FX activation rate reflects the formation of quaternary TFÂ·FVIIaÂ·TFPIÂ·FXa complexes and the corresponding decline of TFÂ·FVIIa activity, which for any fixed concentration of inhibitor, can be described as a pseudo-first order process (22Baugh R.J. Broze Jr., G.J. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4378-4386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 23Lindhout T. Franssen J. Willems G.M. Thromb. Haemost. 1995; 74: 910-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, the time-dependent FXa generation indicating a mono-exponential decay of TFÂ·FVIIa activity can be expressed as shown in Equation 3, [FXa]t=V0/k(1âeâkt),(Eq. 3) with [FXa]t the observed FXa generation at timet, V0 the rate of FXa generation in the absence of inhibitor, k the pseudo-first order rate constant of inhibition, and t the reaction time. In principle, the rate constants V0 andk can be determined by a least squares fit of Equation 3 to the FXa generation curve. This approach, however, is subject to the drawback that, because of the rapid decline of the FXa generation rate, the estimates of V0 and k become increasingly correlated and inaccurate for increasing concentrations of the inhibitory complex. To avoid this source of error, we employed the excellent reproducibility of repeated measurements of FXa generation on the same TFÂ·PSPC/TFÂ·PC disc after regeneration by an EDTA wash (see âResultsâ). Each measurement of FX activation in the presence of FXaÂ·TFPI complex was preceded by a measurement of the corresponding FXa generation in the absence of inhibitor complex. The rate constantsV0 and k were estimated by a simultaneous least squares fit of Equation 3 to the experimental data, with an individual parameter k for the uninhibited and the inhibited FX activation and a shared parameterV0 for the initial rate of FXa generation. Typical results of FX activation experiments using a rotating disc are shown in Fig.1. The disc with TF embedded in a planar phospholipid bilayer composed of PSPC or PC was incubated first with FVIIa (1 nm) during 5 min before FX (100 nm) was added to start the reaction. Apparently, for both TFÂ·PC and TFÂ·PSPC, the FXa activity increases linearly as a function of time. However, the inset to Fig. 1 reveals that, in contrast to the TFÂ·PC surface, it takes for the TFÂ·PSPC surface about 1 min before FXa activity starts to increase linearly. This delayed rise in solution FXa activity most likely reflects binding of FXa to the TFÂ·PSPC surface (35Andree H.A. Contino P.B. Repke D. Gentry R. Nemerson Y. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4368-4374Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Therefore, the initial rate of FX activation is defined as the linear increase in solution phase FXa 1.5 min after the start of the reaction. When the rotation of the disc was stopped FXa generation halted indicating that under the conditions of the experiment convective transport is essential both for delivery of FX to the catalytic surface and for the transfer of FXa from the surface to the solution. No FXa was produced in the absence of TF or FVIIa. The mean value Â± S.D. of the initial rate of FXa generation at TFÂ·PSPC after repeated regeneration (n = 5) of the same disc (see âExperimental Proceduresâ) was 2.99 Â± 0.12 nm/min. For TF embedded in PC, the initial rate of FXa generation was 0.82 Â± 0.07 nm/min (mean value Â± S.D., n = 5). A single TFÂ·PSPC or TFÂ·PC disc could thus be regenerated and used several times, allowing repeating experiments under different conditions with an unchanged catalytic active surface. The inter-disc variations were larger with mean values for the initial rate of FX activation Â± S.D. of 3.24 Â± 0.70 nm/min (n = 30) and 0.77 Â± 0.37 nm/min (n = 30) for TFÂ·PSPC and TFÂ·PC, respectively. It should be noted that the TFÂ·PC membrane preparation contained 5-fold more TF than the TFÂ·PSPC membrane. Fig. 2 shows the relation between the angular velocity of the rotating disc and the initial rate of FXa formation. For a rotating disc with TFÂ·PSPC, the initial rate of FXa formation increases when the angular velocity increases from 0 to 60 rad/s. An additional increase of the angular velocity does not result in a concomitant increase of the initial rate. Thus, an angular velocity of more than 60 rad/s appears to be sufficient to approach a kinetically controlled situation. That is, the rate at which FX is activated at the surface is smaller than the transport limited rate of FX delivery to the catalytic surface. A similar experiment was also performed with TF embedded in PC (Fig. 2). Obviously, an apparent kinetically controlled FX activation is achieved at a lower angular velocity (30 rad/s) than observed with TFÂ·PSPC. The 5-fold lower rate of FX activation at the TFÂ·PC surface likely reduces the transport-limited supply of reactants. All further experiments were performed at an angular velocity of 63 rad/s. Based on a previously reported Kd value of 41 pm for FVIIa binding to TF in PSPC vesicles (36Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8007-8013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we reckoned that a FVIIa concentration of 1 nm, as used in the experiments described above, was sufficient to saturate all the TF exposed at the catalytic surface. To verify whether this assumption applied for the rotating disc system, we measured the initial rate of FX activation as a function of the solution phase FVIIa concentration. The titration curves obtained (data not shown) were analyzed using Equation 1 to yield binding as well as kinetic parameters. For TFÂ·PSPC the fit yielded a Kd of 18 pm, and for TFÂ·PC the Kd value was 240 pm. Thus, whereas the Kd of FVIIa for TFÂ·PSPC is in good agreement with the value previously reported (36Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8007-8013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Waxman E. Ross J.B. Laue T.M. Guha A. Thiruvikraman S.V. Lin T.C. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3998-4003Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the affinity of FVIIa for TFÂ·PC is 10-fold higher than values reported by others (32Bach R. Gentry R. Nemerson Y. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4007-4020Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 36Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8007-8013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, a FVIIa concentration of 1 nm is indeed sufficient to saturate more than 80% of the TF present at the PC and PSPC surfaces. Furthermore, the fit yielded aVmax of 4.4 nm/min (TFÂ·PSPC) and 0.85 nm/min (TFÂ·PC), corresponding to a turnover number of 1677/min for TFÂ·PSPC and of 65/min for TFÂ·PC. Likewise, the relationship between the initial rate of FX activation at the spinning surface and the fluid-phase FX concentration was determined for TFÂ·PSPC and TFÂ·PC. By fitting Equation 2 to the experimental data (not shown), we estimated values of 110 nm for the apparent Km(Km(app)) and of 5.5 nm/min for Vmax. Calculation on basis of an estimated TF density of the PSPC surface (2.5 fmol/cm2) gave akcat value of 2098/min for TFÂ·PSPC. For TFÂ·PC a linear relation between the FXa generation rate and the FX concentration was found despite a much higher (up to 400 nm) FX concentration employed (data not shown). This indicated for the TFÂ·PC a Km(app)value of > 5 Î¼m, thus at least 1 order of magnitude greater than the highest FX concentration used. In a successive set of experiments, we assessed the inhibitory activity of preformed FXaÂ·TFPIFL and FXaÂ·TFPI1â161 complexes toward TFÂ·FVIIa-catalyzed FX activation at TFÂ·PC and TFÂ·PSPC membranes deposited on rotating discs. Following a preincubation with FVIIa for 5 min, the reaction was started by the simultaneous addition of FX (100 nm) and inhibitor complexes in varying concentrations. All inhibition experiments were preceded by a control experiment in the absence of inhibitor to assess the precise catalytic activity of that particular rotating disc. To correct for inter-disc variations in catalytic activity (Â± 20%, as shown before), the FXa generated in the presence of inhibitor is expressed as a percentage of the corresponding amount of FXa generated after 10 min in the absence of inhibitor. It is seen from Fig. 3 A that the rate of FXa generation on TFÂ·FVIIaÂ·PC in the presence of FXaÂ·TFPI1â161 gradually decreases in time and that this progressive inhibition becomes more pronounced at higher inhibitor concent"

Carbamoyl phosphate synthesis requires the concerted action of the glutaminase (GLN) and carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase domains of CAD. There is a functional linkage between these domains such that glutamine hydrolysis on the GLN domain does not occur at a significant rate unless ATP and HCO3â, the other substrates needed for carbamoyl phosphate synthesis, bind to the synthetase domain. The GLN domain consists of catalytic and attenuation subdomains. In the separately cloned GLN domain, the catalytic subdomain is down-regulated by interactions with the attenuation domain, a process thought to be part of the functional linkage. Replacement of Ser44 in the GLN attenuation domain with alanine increases thekcat/Km for glutamine hydrolysis 680-fold. The formation of a functional hybrid between the mammalian Ser44 GLN domain and the Escherichia coli carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase large subunit had little effect on glutamine hydrolysis. In contrast, ATP and HCO3â did not stimulate the glutaminase activity, indicating that the interdomain linkage had been disrupted. In accord with this interpretation, the rate of glutamine hydrolysis and carbamoyl phosphate synthesis were no longer coordinated. Approximately 3 times more glutamine was hydrolyzed by the Ser44 â Ala mutant than that needed for carbamoyl phosphate synthesis. Ser44, the only attenuation subdomain residue that extends into the GLN active site, appears to be an integral component of the regulatory circuit that phases glutamine hydrolysis and carbamoyl phosphate synthesis.

Remarkably, the active sites were found to be widely separated but connected by a narrow tunnel that passes through the interior of the molecule. The ammonia generated by hydrolysis of glutamine presumably diffuses through the tunnel to the active site of CPS.A, where it reacts with carboxy phosphate to form carbamate. The carbamate then diffuses through the tunnel to the active site of CPS.B, where carbamoyl phosphate is formed in the second ATP-dependent reaction.

The reaction proceeds through a thioester intermediate, and there is evidence that a catalytic triad consisting of Cys252, His336, and Glu338 in CAD promotes catalysis. The thioester was directly observed in the x-ray structure (24Thoden J.B. Miran S.G. Phillips J.C. Howard A.J. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8825-8831Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) of an E. coli CPSase mutant. The residues of the catalytic triad have the expected juxtaposition relative to the bound intermediate and in addition, Ser47(Ser44 in CAD) was found to be close to the carbonyl carbon of the thioester carboxamide group. The authors suggested that this serine residue may participate in catalysis by positioning the carbonyl group for nucleophilic attack by the active site cysteine and by stabilizing the developing oxyanion in the transition state. The partial reactions are coordinated by a reciprocal linkage between glutamine hydrolysis and carbamoyl phosphate synthesis. While the GLN and CPS domains of both E. coli and mammalian CPSase can function autonomously, many studies (1Anderson P.M. Meister A.

Glutamine hydrolysis does not proceed at a significant rate in the absence of ATP and bicarbonate. This functional linkage minimizes the hydrolysis of glutamine when the other substrates needed for carbamoyl phosphate synthesis are limiting. We have previously cloned and expressed the mammalian GLN domain (39Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7702-7708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and showed that the purified recombinant protein forms a stable, stoichiometric complex with the E. coli CPS subunit. The hybrid molecule has kinetic parameters that are similar to those of the GLN domain of intact CAD, and the linkage between the GLN and CPS domains is fully functional (31Hewagama A. Guy H.I. Chaparian M. Evans D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1388: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 39Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7702-7708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have used this hybrid molecule to examine the role of Ser44 and conclude that it is not a catalytic residue in the usual sense, but rather is a crucial element in the functional linkage that coordinates the reactions occurring on the GLN and CPS domains. [14C]Glutamine was purchased from DuPont, HPLC-grade methanol was from Burdick and Jackson, and theo-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) reagent solution and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma.

Cells harboring the recombinant plasmids were routinely grown from a single colony in 2Ã YT medium supplemented with 50â100 mg/liter ampicillin. The expression of the mammalian GLN domain in EK1104 transformants was induced as described previously (39Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7702-7708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while the E. coli CPS subunit is expressed constitutively (42Rubino S.D. Nyunoya H. Lusty C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4382-4386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in L673 cells transformed with pHN12, a plasmid encoding the E. coli CPSase large subunit. Plasmids were isolated using the Bio101 RPM kit. Transformation and preparation of competent E. coli cells were carried out by the Hanahan procedure (43Hanahan D. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. Vol. 1. IRL Press, New York1985Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by PCR using the Stratagene QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit and PfuTurboTM DNA polymerase, which replicates both plasmid strands with high fidelity. Oligonucleotide primers were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Custom Primers. Following PCR, the product was treated with DpnI endonuclease to digest the parental DNA template. The nicked vector DpnI-treated DNA was then transformed in E. coli Epicurian Coli XL1-Blue supercompetent cells. Colonies were grown and the DNA isolated and sequenced by the double-stranded dideoxy method at the Wayne State University Core Facility. The mutant plasmid was then transformed into the EK1104 strain. Restriction digests, ligations, and other DNA methods were carried out using standard protocols (44Maniatis T. Fritsch E.R. Sambrook I. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1st Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). CAD was isolated from an overproducing strain of Syrian hamster cells (BHK-128) as described previously (5Coleman P. Suttle D. Stark G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6379-6385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,45Mally M.I. Grayson D.R. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11372-11380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The E. coli CPSase large subunit was isolated from pHN12 transformants using the methods of Rubino et al. (42Rubino S.D. Nyunoya H. Lusty C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4382-4386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The wild type CAD GLN domain and the mutant were isolated by the method described earlier (39Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7702-7708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To form the hybrid CPSase (GLN-CPS), stoichiometric amounts of the wild type CAD GLN domain or its mutant and the E. coli CPSase large subunit were mixed together and incubated for 15 min (31Hewagama A. Guy H.I. Chaparian M. Evans D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1388: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 39Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7702-7708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The complex was then concentrated using either a Speed-Vac at room temperature or by centrifugation using Millipore Ultrafree-MC 30,000 NMWL filter units at 4 Â°C. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford dye binding method using bovine serum albumin as a standard (46Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). SDS-gel electrophoresis was carried out on 10% polyacrylamide gels (47Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). The structure of the CAD GLN-CPS domains was modeled with E. coli CPSase (Brookhaven Protein Data Bank; identification code 1JDB) serving as the tertiary template using the program Quanta version 4.0 (MSI). The alignment of CAD and E. coli CPSase sequences was carried out giving equal weight to secondary structure and sequence similarity. Undefined regions were regularized in two stages, 50 cycles of steepest descent, followed by 200 cycles of adopted basis set NR, prior to final energy minimization. The CPSase activity was assayed at 37 Â°C using a radiometric procedure described previously (6Mally M.I. Grayson D.R. Evans D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6647-6651Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 48Christopherson R.I. Jones M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11381-11395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a 2 mm excess of MgCl2 over the concentration of ATP in the assay. The GLNase activity (31Hewagama A. Guy H.I. Chaparian M. Evans D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1388: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) of the isolated CAD GLN domain and the mammalian-E. coli CPSase hybrid complex was measured by an assay that involved separating the reactant glutamine from the product glutamate by HPLC as described below. The assay buffer contained 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.05 mm EDTA, 25 mm KCl (with or without 10 mm ATP, 12 mm MgCl2, 15 mm NaHCO3), and variable glutamine in a total volume of 0.35 ml. The reaction was initiated by adding 7â17 Î¼g of the GLN domain in 50 Î¼l, allowed to proceed for 1 h at 37 Â°C, and then quenched with 100 Î¼l of 20% trichloroacetic acid. The samples stood on ice for 10 min prior to centrifugation for 5 min at 14,000 rpm to remove the precipitated protein. The supernatant (60 Î¼l) was then neutralized with 10.8 Î¼l of 1.2 m NaOH. For glutamine concentrations less than 10 mm, the samples were derivatized by directly adding 100 Î¼l of OPA reagent to the neutralized sample. At higher glutamine concentrations, 200 Î¼l of OPA reagent was added to 10 Î¼l of the neutralized protein solution. Exactly 90 s following the addition of OPA, a 100-Î¼l sample was injected onto the HPLC column. The activity is expressed as nanomoles/min/mg of the GLN domain, and the amounts assayed given in the legends represent micrograms of the GLN domain. The formation of a complex between the isolated 38-kDa mammalian GLN domain and the mutant, with the 120-kDaE. coli CPSase synthetase subunit, was verified by gel filtration. The hybrid (45â50 Î¼g) in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA and 5% glycerol was applied to a 1.5 Ã 63-cm Sephacryl S-300 column. The column was pre-equilibrated and eluted at 0.2 ml/min with the same buffer. Column fractions were analyzed by assaying CPSase and by SDS-gel electrophoresis. The mammalian GLN domain was modeled using the E. coli CPSase structure (23Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) as a template. As expected, given the strong sequence similarity of the mammalian and bacterial proteins, the configuration of active site residues closely resembles that observed for the E. coli enzyme. Ser44 (corresponding to Ser47 in the E. coli structure) is located within the catalytic site of the GLN domain. The side chain extends into the site (Fig.1) with its Î³-oxygen atom positioned within 4.2 â« of the Cys252 sulfur atom and 4.9 â« from the Îµ ring nitrogen of the catalytic histidine residue, His336. Ser44 was replaced with alanine by PCR-directed mutagenesis using the plasmid pHGGLN52 (39Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7702-7708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as a template. High levels of the 38-kDa wild type and mutant domains were expressed when the plasmids were transformed into the E. coli strain EK1104. Both proteins were purified to homogeneity as described (39Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7702-7708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) previously. Gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-300 column showed that, as in the case of the wild type protein, a stoichiometric mixture of the mammalian Ser44 â Ala GLN domain and the E. coli CPSase CPS subunit formed a stable hybrid complex. The isolated GLN domain had very low catalytic activity (Table I), a consequence of a highKm (4 mm) and a very lowkcat (0.020 sâ1). The formation of a hybrid complex consisting of the mammalian GLN domain and the isolated E. coli CPS subunit restored the function of the GLN domain. The Km decreased 45-fold while thekcat increased 15-fold relative to the isolated domain.

Open table in a new tab Contrary to the results that would be expected if Ser44were a catalytic residue, the suppression of catalytic activity of the isolated domain was largely relieved by its replacement with alanine (Fig. 2 and Table I). Compared with the isolated wild type domain, the Km was reduced 7-fold, while the kcat increased 21-fold. Thus, the mutation appreciably activated the isolated GLN domain, increasing the kcat/Km by a factor of 680. The formation of the hybrid with the Ser44 â Ala GLN domain gave a species with kinetic parameters similar to those obtained for the wild type complex, although the kcat andVmax values are about 1.7-fold higher. Compared with the isolated Ser44 â Ala GLN domain, theKm for glutamine was reduced another 6-fold in the mutant hybrid, but there was no appreciable change inkcat. Thus, Ser44 does not participate in glutamine hydrolysis in either the isolated domain or the hybrid in the absence of ATP and bicarbonate. The Ser44 â Ala hybrid protein can also catalyze the overall synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate. Saturation curves for the overall reaction (Fig. 3,A and B, and TableII) show that the Kmfor both glutamine and ATP are very similar to the values determined for the wild type hybrid. However, thekcat values obtained from both glutamine (0.193 sâ1) and ATP (0.164 sâ1) are approximately 14-fold lower for the mutant protein.Table IIKinetic parameters for carbamoyl phosphate synthesisEnzymeVariable substrateKmVmaxkcatkcat/Kmmmnmol/min/mgsâ1 Ã 103mâ1 sâ1Wild type GLN-CPSATP1.66 Â± 0.07aThe ATP saturation curves are sigmoidal and were fit to the Hill equation, so these represent apparent Kmvalues.

Open table in a new tab The binding of ATP and bicarbonate to the CPS subunit stimulates the GLNase activity of the wild type hybrid and CAD 10- and 14-fold, respectively. The stimulation is the result of a corresponding increase in kcat, without any significant change in the affinity for glutamine. In the absence of ATP and bicarbonate (Fig. 4, Table I), thekcat for glutamine hydrolysis of the mutant hybrid (0.525 sâ1) is only marginally increased compared with that of the wild type hybrid (0.309 sâ1) and it does not significantly change in the presence of saturating concentrations of these substrates (0.552 sâ1). Thus, the functional linkage that coordinates the reactions on the GLN and CPS domains is lost as a result of replacement of Ser44 with alanine. In CAD and in the wild type hybrid complex, the rate of glutamine hydrolysis is closely matched to the rate of carbamoyl phosphate synthesis. The maximum velocity for glutamine hydrolysis in the presence of saturating ATP and bicarbonate (Table I, kcat = 3.11 sâ1) parallels the overall rate of carbamoyl phosphate synthesis (Table II,kcat = 2.66 sâ1) in the wild type hybrid. Moreover, a replot (Fig. 3 C) of the velocity data of carbamoyl phosphate synthesized (Fig. 3 A) versusglutamine hydrolyzed (Fig. 4) measured at various concentrations of glutamine gives a slope of 1.15 Â± 0.04, in accord with the expected stoichiometry of the overall reaction at all concentrations of the substrate. In contrast, the rate of glutamine hydrolysis exceeds the rate of carbamoyl phosphate synthesized in the mutant hybrid. Thekcat for the GLNase reaction measured at saturating ATP and bicarbonate is 0.552 sâ1, whereas thekcat for the CPSase reaction is only 0.193 sâ1. Similarly, the plot of glutamine hydrolysisversus carbamoyl phosphate synthesized had a slope of 2.9 Â± 0.1, indicating that the 1:1 stoichiometry observed for the reaction catalyzed by the wild type enzyme is not sustained in the mutant. This result would be expected if Ser44 plays a major role in phasing the reactions occurring on the two domains. Carbamoyl phosphate synthesis involves the concerted action of two domains that must act in synchrony. We are especially interested in the mechanism of glutamine hydrolysis and the reciprocal interactions between the GLN and CPS domains of the mammalian multifunctional protein CAD. Although we have expressed each of the functional domains, we cannot as yet obtain sufficient amounts of CPS needed for the sorts of studies described here. However, previous steady state and presteady state kinetic studies (31Hewagama A. Guy H.I. Chaparian M. Evans D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1388: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 39Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7702-7708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the hybrid consisting of the isolated mammalian GLN domain and the E. coli CPS subunit has catalytic parameters similar to CAD as well as a functional interdomain linkage. Thus, we have used this system to assess the role of Ser44 in carbamoyl phosphate synthesis. Whereas the hydrolysis of glutamine by CAD can be easily measured, the isolated GLN domain has barely detectable activity as a result of an appreciable increase in the Km for glutamine and decrease in kcat. However, the kinetic parameters are restored to the normal values found in CAD when a stoichiometric complex is formed by the non-covalent association of the isolated GLN domain and the CPS subunit of E. coli CPSase. Sequence comparisons (10Simmer J.P. Kelly R.E. Rinker Jr., A.G. Scully J.L. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10395-10402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Bein K. Simmer J. Evans D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3791-3799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the 40-kDa CPSase GLN domain consists of two distinct regions. The carboxyl half of the domain is homologous to the amidotransferase domain of all trpG or triad type amidotransferases (33Zalkin H. Smith J.L. Enzymes Utilizing Glutamine as an Amide Donor: in Amino Acid Metabolism, Part A. Vol. 72. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1998: 87-144Google Scholar, 34Massiere F. Badet-Denisot M.-A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 205-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 49Zalkin H. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 263-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), while the amino half of the domain is unique to the CPSases. Since amidotransferase domains of the other biosynthetic enzymes have an average molecular mass of 20 kDa and do not have a chain segment corresponding to the amino half of the CPS GLN domain, it was reasonable to assume that all of the residues required for glutamine binding and catalysis would be found in the carboxyl half of the CAD GLN domain. Support for this interpretation was obtained when we cloned and expressed (50Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2190-2197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) the two halves of the mammalian CPSase GLN domain and showed that they are autonomously folded subdomains with specific functions. The amino half has no catalytic activity but forms a stable complex with the CPS domain. The carboxyl half, the catalytic subdomain, binds glutamine with the same affinity and is more active (kcat = 5.7 sâ1) than the maximum glutaminase activity observed for intact CAD, even when assayed in the presence of saturating ATP and HCO3â (kcat = 1.9 sâ1). We therefore suggested that a major function of the amino half of the GLN domain, the attenuation subdomain, was to modulate the intrinsically high catalytic activity of the catalytic subdomain and that this region of the molecule was instrumental in relaying the interdomain signal between the GLN and CPS domains. In accord with this hypothesis, the x-ray structure of E. coliCPSase (23Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) subsequently showed that the attenuation subdomain makes extensive contacts with the CPS subunit in E. coli CPSase. The x-ray structure also showed that Ser44 is the only residue in the attenuation subdomain that extends into the GLN active site, making it a prime candidate for participation in the functional linkage. The activation of the GLN domain that occurs upon association with the CPSase subunit is almost entirely mimicked by the replacement of Ser44 with alanine in the isolated domain. Thekcat increases 20-fold to 0.43 sâ1compared with a value of 0.31 sâ1 for the wild type hybrid complex. The high activity of the isolated Ser44 â Ala GLN domain confirms that this serine residue is not involved in catalysis. The Km also decreases to 0.6 mm in the isolated Ser44 â Ala domain, but is still 6-fold higher than that of the wild type hybrid complex. One could argue that this residue is important for binding glutamine, but, when the Ser44 â Ala GLN domain associates with theE. coli CPS subunit, the Km is virtually the same as the wild type hybrid complex. Thus, it seems clear that the suppression of activity in the isolated GLN domain is, to a large extent, the result of the serine residue. Since alanine is nearly isosteric with serine, the depression of activity is unlikely to be a consequence of steric interference, suggesting that Ser44may form a hydrogen bond with one of the active site residues that interferes with its normal function in catalysis. When the wild type isolated domain combines with the CPS subunit, Ser44 is likely to be displaced to its position located in the electron density maps of E. coli CPSase (23Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Since the serine residue has been replaced in the mutant, little change would be expected when the Ser44 â Ala domain combines with the CPS subunit. Consistent with this interpretation, the kinetic parameters for glutamine hydrolysis by the Ser44 â Ala hybrid are similar to the values measured for the wild type hybrid complex, suggesting that Ser44 is not required for glutamine hydrolysis by the hybrid in the absence of ATP and HCO3â. The hydrolysis of glutamine and the activation of bicarbonate are parallel reactions that must occur in phase to avoid the wasteful hydrolysis of glutamine or ATP that would otherwise occur. This requirement is especially important since the active sites are far from one another, about 45 â« in the E. coli structure (23Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), and ammonia must be delivered to the active site of CPS.A via a long interdomain tunnel. The coordination of these partial reactions requires that the GLNase activity be modulated so that it is not operating at or near its full catalytic potential unless the concentration of the other substrates needed for carbamoyl phosphate synthesis are saturating. A part of the interdomain functional linkage is the down-regulation of the glutaminase activity when ATP and bicarbonate are limiting. Steady state and presteady state kinetic studies of CAD (28Chaparian M.G. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3387-3395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Hewagama A. Guy H.I. Chaparian M. Evans D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1388: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) showed that, in the absence of ATP and bicarbonate, the thioester intermediate accumulates and the rate constant for the breakdown of the thioester intermediate is the same as the kcat for glutamine hydrolysis, indicating that it is the rate-limiting step. When ATP and bicarbonate are present, the breakdown of the thioester is accelerated, the intermediate cannot be detected, and the kcatfor the hydrolysis of glutamine increases 14-fold. Since the substrate induced acceleration of catalysis is due to an increase inkcat without an apparent change on glutamine binding, it is likely that the juxtaposition of catalytic residues is suboptimal in the absence of ATP and bicarbonate. Similar results have been reported (29Lusty C.J. Liao M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1278-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 30Miles B.W. Banzon J.A. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16773-16779Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) for E. coli CPSase. The functional linkage is abolished in the Ser44 â Ala hybrid. The addition of ATP and bicarbonate has no significant effect on either theKm or the kcat of the hybrid, suggesting that Ser44 is essential for transmission of the allosteric signal that up-regulates the GLN domain. Since activation primarily involves an increase in the rate of breakdown of the thioester, it is possible that Ser44 promotes its hydrolysis, but only when ATP and bicarbonate are bound to the CPS domain. If this functional linkage is important in phasing the reactions occurring on the GLN and CPS domains, then the rate of glutamine hydrolysis need no longer match the rate of carbamoyl phosphate synthesis if the linkage is disrupted. The stoichiometry of carbamoyl phosphate synthesis is tightly controlled in the wild type hybrid, with 1 mol of glutamine hydrolyzed/mol of carbamoyl phosphate synthesized. In contrast, the mutant hybrid hydrolyzed 3 times more glutamine than that needed for carbamoyl phosphate synthesis, with the excess presumably leaking out of the complex. We conclude that serine 44 in the GLN attenuation domain is not a catalytic residue in the usual sense but rather is an essential component in the regulatory linkage that phases glutamine hydrolysis and carbamoyl phosphate synthesis.

In an attempt to learn more about the enzymatic formation of the hepoxilins, we investigated other sources for the âhepoxilin synthaseâ which may provide an abundant supply for the purification of the enzyme. Herein, we report the formation of hepoxilins via the 15-lipoxygenase pathway which is abundant in freshly grown roots of garlic. The isolated compounds (14,15-hepoxilins) constitute structural analogs of the parent 11,12-hepoxilins and provide further information on the specificity of the hepoxilin receptor in human neutrophils toward hepoxilins derived from 12-lipoxygenase.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIncubation of arachidonic acid with a cell-free homogenate of garlic roots caused the formation of products that migrated on reverse phase-HPLC after conversion into fluorescent ADAM derivatives as characteristic doublets (19.4, 20.4, and 21.5, 22.1 min, Fig.1 E) in a region where authentic 11,12-hepoxilins A3 and B3 migrate (doublets at 23.0, 23.9 min for the two epimers of HxA3 and 25.5, 26.3 for HxB3, Fig. 1 A). Hence, the pattern and relative elution of these products indicated that they were hepoxilin-like products (Fig. 1). Further confirmation of the hepoxilin-like nature of these compounds was obtained by their disappearance from the chromatograms after treatment of the samples with acid (data not shown). Arachidonic acid comprises approximately 2% of the fatty acids in garlic roots and approximately 5% in garlic bulbs. 2D. Reynaud, M. Ali, P. Demin, and C. R. Pace-Asciak, unpublished observations.

AOCS Press, Champaign, IL1998: 400-402Google Scholar) and suggested therefore that the new products may be derived from this pathway. In fact, when 15-HPETE was incubated with a garlic root cell-free homogenate, products similar to those formed from arachidonic acid were observed (compare Fig. 1, D and E). Identical products were also formed when 15-HPETE was incubated with hemin (in the absence of tissue, Fig. 1 C), a condition previously shown by us to lead, in the 12-HPETE series, to the formation of 11(S),12(S)- and 11(R),12(R)-hepoxilins A3 and B3.Despite the nonenzymatic (hemin-catalyzed) conversion of 12-HPETE into the hepoxilins, we have previously observed that an enzyme system exists in the pineal gland which forms exclusively the 11(S),12(S)-hepoxilins (3Reynaud D. Demin P. Pace-Asciak C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23976-23980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This was demonstrated by the selective utilization of 12(S)- but not 12(R)-HPETE during hepoxilin formation. In the present experiments, we employed a similar approach with 15(S/R)-HPETE to investigate whether a selective consumption of 15(S)-HPETE could be observed during incubation with garlic root homogenates to indicate the presence of an HPETE isomerase. Hence HPLC fractions corresponding to 15-HETE and the 14,15-hepoxilins were isolated and subjected to chiral phase analysis. Fig.2 shows that garlic roots convert arachidonic acid exclusively into the 15(S)-HETE which accumulates in the incubation (Fig. 2 D); conversely, when 15(S/R)-HPETE is used as substrate, the 15(S)-enantiomer is selectively consumed for further conversion into hepoxilin products while the 15(R)-enantiomer remains unmetabolized (Fig. 2 C). When a nonselective reaction of 15-HPETE is carried out, as with hemin, both 15(S)- and 15(R)-HETE are detected at the end of the incubation (Fig. 2 B). These experiments indicate the stereospecificity of 15-lipoxygenase in garlic roots as well as the selective utilization of the 15(S)-enantiomer by HPETE isomerase to form the 14,15-hepoxilins. Confirmation of these findings was obtained when 14,15-hepoxilins were analyzed by chiral-phase HPLC. Fig. 3 a shows that while 14,15-hepoxilin B3 (the major hepoxilin formed by garlic roots) affords chiral specificity (compare panels Cand D) when an enzyme system is used, note that the corresponding hepoxilin A3 does not appear to, as its pattern is similar to that obtained during hemin catalysis (Fig.3 b).Figure 2Chiral phase HPLC analysis of 15-HETE fractions collected from the chromatograms in Fig. 1, after further purification on SP-HPLC. Note the selective formation of 15(S)-HETE from the incubations of garlic roots with arachidonic acid (AA) (panel D), indicating the presence of a 15(S)-lipoxygenase. Also note in the experiments with 15(S/R)-HPETE substrate thatboth HETE enantiomers are present in the incubate when hemin was used as catalyst (i.e. nonenzymatic reaction) (panel B), whereas in the presence of garlic rootsonly 15(R)-HETE accumulates (panel C), indicating the selective utilization of the 15(S) enantiomer of the racemic 15-HPETE substrate by the HPETE isomerase in the garlic root system.

In contrast to the highly stereoselective formation from arachidonic acid (AA) and 15(S)-HPETE of the 14(S),15(S)-hepoxilin B3 (Fig. 3), chiral phase analysis of the A-series appears to indicate that there is no stereo-selection in its formation by the garlic root system.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Characterization of the products was achieved through GCMS analysis both as the intact metabolites and after catalytic hydrogenation.

That this enzyme activity is of importance to the rooting system of garlic was demonstrated by the addition of two inhibitors of lipoxygenases, BW 755C and NDGA, prior to initiation of rooting. Both inhibitors blocked the appearance of roots which was abundant in the control groups (Fig.6).SCHEME 1Pathway describing the formation by garlic roots of the 14,15-hepoxilins isolated in this study.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6Inhibition of garlic root growth by BW 755C and NDGA indicating an important function of 15(S)-lipoxygenase in garlic.

A lipoxygenase pathway has recently been identified from garlic with the isolation of some unique divinyl ether metabolites of linoleic acid (34Grechkin A.N. Ilyasov A.V. Hamberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The presence of a 15(S)-lipoxygenase in garlic may afford relevance to atherosclerosis. Reported evidence suggests that 15-lipoxygenase oxidizes LDL to a pro-atherogenic form (35Kuhn H. Belkner J. Suzuki H. Yamamoto S. J. Lipid. Res. 1994; 35: 1749-1759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, evidence with transgenic rabbits that overexpress 15-lipoxygenase also indicates that these animals are resistant to the development of atherosclerosis when fed a cholesterol-rich diet (36Shen J. Kuhn H. Petho-Schramm A. Chan L. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1623-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar,37Shen J. Herderick E. Cornhill J.F. Zsigmond E. Kim H.S. Kuhn H. Valentinova N. Chan L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2201-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Hence 15-lipoxygenase may act in both a pro- and anti-atherogenic manner depending on the time course of atherosclerosis (38Kuhn H. Chan L. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In the early stages, 15-lipoxygenase may serve an anti-atherogenic role, whereas in the later stages, it may act in a pro-atherogenic fashion (39Kuhn H. Borngrabber S. Nigam S. Pace-Asciak C.R. Lipoxygenases and Their Metabolites, Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology Series. Vol. 447. Plenum Press, New York1999: 5-28Google Scholar). The products described herein are major products derived from 15-lipoxygenase present in garlic. Their actions on neutrophils in terms of intracellular calcium release may provide an insight into the antiinflammatory actions of these compounds as hepoxilins derived from the 12-lipoxygenase have been shown to inhibit the actions of inflammatory mediators (9Laneuville O. Reynaud D. Grinstein S. Nigam S. Pace-Asciak C.R. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Whether the anti-atherogenic actions of garlic are related to the formation of the 14,15-hepoxilins remains to be established.In conclusion, we have demonstrated the presence in garlic roots of 15(S)-lipoxygenase activity, and this is coupled with an HPETE isomerase (see Scheme 1). The products are analogs of the 11,12-hepoxilins that we described previously from the pancreas, pineal gland, and brain formed through the enzymatic isomerization of 12(S)-HPETE. The present results show that 15(S)-lipoxygenase is functionally important to the rooting system of garlic although we do not know whether the isolated 14,15-hepoxilins play a role. The present study also provides further information into the structural specificity of the hepoxilin receptor for 11,12-hepoxilin A3 in human neutrophils and the potential ubiquity of the HPETE isomerase (or hepoxilin synthase).

Interaction of ligand-occupied receptors with heterotrimeric G proteins triggers the exchange of GTP for GDP on the Î±-subunit, leading to a sequential release of GÎ±-GTP and the stable Î²Î³-complex from the receptor. The released G protein subunits are then able to interact with distinct effector enzymes and ion channels. G protein activation is terminated by hydrolysis of GTP by the intrinsic GTPase activity of the Î±-subunit, leading to reassociation of GÎ± and GÎ²Î³. The cycle is then complete, and the heterotrimeric G protein is able to be activated again. The structural determinations for several members of the family of heterotrimeric G proteins have shown that their Î±-subunits are composed of two domains (1Neer E.J.

It is therefore tempting to assume that the latter domain may be important for specific functions of heterotrimeric G proteins that are not shared by other members of the GTPase superfamily, such as coupling to heptahelical receptors. Surprisingly, current modeling suggests that receptor-G protein coupling is exclusively by the core domain of GÎ± and segments of the Î²- and Î³-subunits, however (1Neer E.J.

A screening of different GÎ±s antibodies for their applicability in studying insulin receptor-NADPH oxidase coupling revealed that one of the commercially available antibodies (K-20), which recognizes residues 100â119 within the Î±-helical domain of GÎ±s, mimicked the effects of inhibitory ligands, such as the Î²-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, on NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation that are transduced by Gs. We therefore explored whether the epitope recognized by K-20 may define a new contact site for activated Î²-adrenergic receptors or be involved in an alternative route of Gs activation that may be utilized for a receptor-independent activation of Gs by intracellular pseudoreceptors or accessory proteins, for example (10Higashijima T.

Briefly, adipose tissue was from nondiabetic subjects undergoing elective abdominal or cosmetic breast surgery. The specimens were cut into small pieces, and fat cells were isolated in a HEPES-buffered Krebs-Henseleit solution, pH 7.4, containing 20 mm HEPES, 10 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm glucose, 20 g/liter albumin, and 1 mg/ml collagenase (CLS, Worthington). After 30 min, fat cells were washed and resuspended in 10 volumes of an ice-cold lysing medium containing 20 mmMES, 1The abbreviations used are:MES2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidGTPÎ³Sguanosine-5â²-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)MOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidAMP(PNP)adenylyl imidodiphosphatePBSphosphate-buffered salineCTXcholera toxinNEMN-ethylmaleimide pH 6.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl, and 100 mg/liter soybean trypsin inhibitor. Cell lysis was completed by mechanical shaking, and fat cell ghosts were collected by low speed centrifugation (1,000 Ã g, 4 Â°C, 20 min). 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid guanosine-5â²-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid adenylyl imidodiphosphate phosphate-buffered saline cholera toxin N-ethylmaleimide A two-step procedure was used, as reported elsewhere (16Krieger-Brauer H.I. Medda P.K. Kather H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10135-10143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Plasma membranes from adipocytes were first exposed to hormones and were then assayed for NADPH oxidase activity. The activation step was carried out in 30 mmMOPS, pH 7.5, containing 120 mm NaCl, 1.4 mmCaCl2, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaHCO3, and 0.1% human albumin. Membranes were first incubated with 5 nm insulin in absence or presence of 5 Î¼m isoproterenol for 5 min to allow receptor occupation. Thereafter, 50 Î¼m GTPÎ³S was added. After 20 min, ghosts were collected by centrifugation, washed, and then resuspended in 30 mm MES, pH 5.8, containing 120 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1 mmNaN3, 250 Î¼m NADPH, and 10 Î¼mFAD for determination of NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation. To assess the effects of G protein antibodies and peptides corresponding their target sequences on NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation, membranes were exposed to both types of agents at 4 Â°C for 45 min, as indicated in the legends to figures, and were then subjected to the two-step procedure described above. Adenylyl cyclase activity of human fat cell plasma membranes was determined in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm ATP, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 10 Î¼m GTP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 0.1 mg of creatine kinase, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin in a final volume of 100 Î¼l. Reactions were initiated by addition of 5â8 Î¼g of membrane protein and were continued for 15 min at 37 Â°C in the absence or presence of isoproterenol, as indicated. Reactions were terminated by 100 Î¼l of ice-cold perchloric acid (5%). cAMP was determined by radioimmunoassay (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) after neutralization. To assess the effect of GÎ±s-derived peptides and antibody K-20 on adenylyl cyclase activity, membranes were pretreated with the K-20 antibody or peptides, as described above. For cholera toxin (CTX) labeling, membranes (500 Î¼g) were incubated for 45 min at 37 Â°C in 1 ml of 30 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, containing 2.5 mmMgCl2, 1.4 mm CaCl2, 120 mm NaCl, 10 mm thymidine, 10 mmarginine, 10 Î¼m GTP, 10 Î¼m NAD, and 100 Î¼g of cholera toxin A subunit. Membranes were washed and then subjected to GTPase assay. GTP hydrolysis was determined essentially as described by Jakobs and Aktories (20Jakobs K.H. Aktories K. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Untreated or CTX-treated membranes were preincubated (20 min, 4 Â°C) in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 100 Î¼m N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) to inactivate Gi. After washing, NEM-treated membranes were exposed to antibody K-20 or the peptide corresponding to its target sequence for 40 min at 0 Â°C, as indicated. For determination of GTPase activity membranes (5â10 Î¼g of protein) were incubated in 0.1 ml Tris-HCl (20 mm, pH 7.6) containing 0.2 Î¼m GTP, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm AMP(PNP), 2.5 mm Mg Cl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmcreatine phosphate, 0.025 mg of creatine kinase, and [Î³-32P]GTP (0.1â0.2 Î¼mol) at 37 Â°C for 10 min. Reactions were terminated by addition of 25% (w/v) activated charcoal. Release of 32Pi was determined by counting aliquots of the supernatants for radioactivity. Low affinity GTPase activity was determined by measuring the rate of GTP hydrolysis at 50 mm GTP. Less than 16% of total GTP hydrolysis was due to low affinity GTPases under the conditions used. In contrast to other G proteins, GÎ±s does not dissociate in the presence of GTPÎ³S alone under the conditions used in the present experiments (17Togoshige M. Okuga S. Rebois R.V. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4865-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 18Togoshige M. Basi N.S. Rebois R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8791-8795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Plasma membranes were therefore suspended in activation buffer containing 50 Î¼m GTPÎ³S, as described above, and incubated in the absence or presence of various concentrations K-20 for 25 min at ambient temperature, as indicated in the legend to Fig.1. After treatment with K-20, membranes were pelleted and solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 0 Â°C. Gs was immunoprecipitated by COOH-terminal anti-GÎ±s (RM/1), which does not discriminate between heterotrimeric and monomeric GÎ±s (17Togoshige M. Okuga S. Rebois R.V. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4865-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 18Togoshige M. Basi N.S. Rebois R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8791-8795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations were carried out in 10 mm Tris-HCl, ph 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, proteinase inhibitors (0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 Î¼mleupeptin, 2 Î¼m pepstatin, 1 unit/ml aprotinin), and antibody RM/1 at a dilution of 1:80 and 50 Î¼m GTPÎ³S. The samples (30 Î¼g of membrane protein/100 Î¼l of precipitation buffer) were incubated overnight at 4 Â°C. The immune complexes were captured with protein A-agarose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and washed three times with 1 ml of washing buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, and the protease inhibitors). The beads were boiled in SDS-sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Hybond polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Western blotting was performed using anti-GÎ±s (RM/1) and anti-GÎ² (SW/1 from NEN Life Science Products) antibodies. Bands were visualized by chemiluminescence using the ECL kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and were quantified by densitometric analysis. The amount of GÎ² was normalized to the amount of GÎ±simmunoprecipitated for each condition. Antibody K-20 selectively precipitated GÎ±s; neither GÎ±i nor GÎ±o was detectable after precipitation of solubilized membrane proteins by K-20 (data not shown). Fig. 1 shows that antibody K-20 was not only capable of specifically recognizing GÎ±s but also promoted dissociation of Gs into its component subunits in the presence of GTPÎ³S. Membranes were pretreated with different K-20 concentrations and monitored for dissociation of Gs by a immunoblot technique utilizing antibody RM/1, which does not discriminate between heterotrimeric and monomeric GÎ±s(17Togoshige M. Okuga S. Rebois R.V. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4865-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 18Togoshige M. Basi N.S. Rebois R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8791-8795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 demonstrates that the amount of GÎ² recovered in RM/1 immunoprecipitates was selectively reduced in membranes that had been pretreated with K-20 in the presence of 50 Î¼m GTPÎ³S. In the absence of GTPÎ³S, the antibody had no influence on the subunit composition of Gs, indicating that K-20 caused a guanine nucleotide triphosphate-dependent dissociation of Gs, which is characteristic for a receptor-mediated activation (1Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar, 2Hamm H.E. Gilchrist A. Curr. Opin.

The latter observation suggested that K-20 may bind to and activate Gs in a manner similar to activated heptahelical receptors. To corroborate this latter hypothesis, untreated and cholera toxin-treated membranes were incubated with increasing concentrations of K-20 and assayed for high affinity GTPase activity in the presence of NEM, which inactivates Gi (20Jakobs K.H. Aktories K. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The antibody caused a concentration-dependent increase in GTP hydrolysis, which was abolished after treatment with cholera toxin (Fig.2 A). At a maximal concentration (1:1,000), the antibody increased GTPase activity by approximately one-third, which is similar to the extent of activation seen in the presence of a maximal concentration of the Î²-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (Fig. 2 B). Consistent with its stimulatory effects on GTP hydrolysis by Gs, K-20 activated adenylyl cyclase activity in human fat cell plasma membranes over the same range of concentrations that were effective in stimulating GTPase activity (Fig.3 A); the maximal effect of the antibody was similar to that seen in the presence of isoproterenol (16Krieger-Brauer H.I. Medda P.K. Kather H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10135-10143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Activation of adenylyl cyclase was not the sole isoproterenol-like effect of K-20 (Fig. 3 B). The antibody mimicked the inhibitory effect of the Î²-adrenergic agonist on NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation as well, which is mediated by Î²Î³-subunits (16Krieger-Brauer H.I. Medda P.K. Kather H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10135-10143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). At maximal concentrations, both isoproterenol and K-20 inhibited the stimulatory effect of insulin on NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation completely, and their effects could be reversed by GÎ²-antibodies or agents that specifically bind GÎ²Î³ 2H. I. Krieger-Brauer, B. Sattel, P. Medda, and H. Kather, submitted for publication. . Thus, K-20 mimicked the action of activated Î²-adrenergic receptors in every aspect studied, suggesting that the epitope recognized by K-20 may either define a new contact site for Î²-adrenergic receptors on the Î±-helical domain of Gs or be involved in an alternative route of Gsactivation that may be utilized for a receptor-independent activation of Gs. The stimulatory effect of K-20 on GTP hydrolysis could be neutralized by a peptide corresponding to its target sequence, as expected (Fig.4 A). Surprisingly, the peptide not only neutralized the effect of the antibody on GTPase activity but inhibited isoproterenol action on GTP hydrolysis as well (Fig.4 B). At a concentration of 2.5 Î¼m, the peptide suppressed the stimulatory effect of isoproterenol over the whole range of concentrations tested, suggesting that the epitope recognized by K-20 may in fact be essential for interaction of activated Î²-adrenergic receptors with Gs (Fig. 4 B). Fig. 5 compares the effects of peptide 100â119 and of a COOH-terminal decapeptide derived from GÎ±s (Table I) on isoproterenol-stimulated rates of cAMP formation and its inhibitory effect on NADPH-dependent H2O2generation. At the concentrations used, both peptides decreased isoproterenol induced cAMP production to basal levels (Fig.5 A). The inhibitory effect of isoproterenol on NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation was also reversed by peptide 100â119 (Fig. 5 B). Surprisingly, the COOH-terminal decapeptide was only effective in inhibiting cAMP formation, a GÎ±s-mediated response, but failed to influence the inhibitory effect of isoproterenol on NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation, which is mediated by Î²Î³-subunits (Fig. 5 B). The effect of peptide 100â119 was specific, inasmuch as this fragment had no effect on forskolin-stimulated rates of cAMP production (Fig.6).Figure 6Lacking effect of peptide 100â119 on forskolin-induced cAMP formation. Membranes were preincubated in the absence or presence of 2.5 Î¼m peptide 100â119 and were stimulated by forskolin for 10 min and then assayed for adenylyl cyclase activity as described under âMethods.â Values are means Â± S.D. of three separate experiments carried out in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) This report demonstrates that polyclonal antibodies directed against a segment of the Î±-helical domain encompassing residues 100â119 of GÎ±s caused a dissociation of Gsinto its component subunits, stimulated a cholera toxin-sensitive high affinity GTPase, and were as efficient in stimulating adenylate cyclase activity as the Î²-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, suggesting that this antibody binds to and stimulates Gs in manner similar to that of ligand-occupied receptors. Consistently, the antibody not only stimulated adenylate cyclase but mimicked the inhibitory action of isoproterenol on NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation as well, which is mediated by GÎ²Î³, indicating that activation of a single G protein, Gs, can provide enough GÎ²Î³ for eliciting a GÎ²Î³-mediated response, which has been questioned (21Taussig R. Tang W.J. Hepler J.R. Gilmann A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With one possible exception (22Yilla M. Oleinick J. Ploegh H.L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 387: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), K-20 is the first example of an antibody exhibiting receptor-mimetic effects, a property that should be extremely useful in elucidating the role of Gs in processes where receptors have not yet been identified, such as membrane traffic (11Vitale N.

Nature. 1992; 358: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The antigenic site recognized by antibody K-20 encompasses the distal end of helix A and the beginning of the following loop, a region of general sequence diversity among GÎ±-subunits that is freely accessible and seems to be poorly ordered in crystals of GÎ±s-GTPÎ³S (25Sunahara R.K. Tesmer J.J.G. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1943-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in GÎ±i2, an adjacent region, e.g. the helix B-helix C segment, undergoes substantial structural changes upon GTP hydrolysis resulting in an opening of the nucleotide binding pocket (26Mixon M.B. Lee E. Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1995; 270: 954-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). However, current modeling suggests that the antigenic site recognized by K-20 may be too distant from the plasma membrane (>35 â«) to be involved in direct physical contact with activated Î²-adrenergic receptors (5Bohm A. Gaudet R. Sigler P.B. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 480-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 6Iiri T. Farfel Z. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1998; 394: 35-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), raising the interesting possibility that helix A and the beginning of the following loop may be utilized for a receptor-independent activation of Gs. Indeed, it is well established that the activity of G proteins may be directly modulated by a diverse group of proteins, including terminal complement complexes (13Niculescu F. Rus H. Shin M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4417-4423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), presenilin (15Smine A. Xu X. Nishiyama K. Katada T. Gambetti P. Yadaw S.P. Wu X. Shi Y.-C. Yasuhara S. Homburger V.

Nakajima T. Ross F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6491-6494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), carbolins (30Klinker J.F. Seifert R. Damm H. Rommelspacher H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 1621-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and taste substances (14Naim M. Seifert R. NuÌrnberg B. GruÌnbaum L. Schultz G. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 451-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the peptide corresponding to the antigenic site of K-20 (residues 100â119) not only neutralized the action of the antibody but impaired Î²-adrenergic receptor signaling via both component subunits of Gs as well, which resulted in inhibition of all effects of isoproterenol tested, including its antagonistic effects on adenylyl cyclase and NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation. Peptides that are effective in blocking receptor-G protein interaction are believed to mimic interfacial contact sites between the proteins. Indeed, this latter type of peptide competition now serves as a standard approach to identifying protein interaction pairs and their recognition sequences (31Taylor J.M. Neubig R.R. Cell. Signalling. 1994; 6: 841-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although provocative, it therefore appears safe to conclude that peptide 100â119 competed with GÎ±sfor activated Î²-adrenergic receptors, implying that the epitope recognized by antibody K-20 within the Î±-helical domain is directly accessible for this class of heptahelical receptors. Consistently, the peptide did not influence the stimulatory effect of forskolin which activates adenylyl cyclase directly. As pointed out above, the conclusion that peptide 100â119 competed with GÎ±s for activated Î²-adrenergic receptors implies that current ideas regarding the orientation of heterotrimeric Gs relative to the membrane and/or receptors may require careful reevaluation (1Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar, 2Hamm H.E. Gilchrist A. Curr. Opin.

Nature. 1998; 394: 35-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Much current thinking is based on the idea of freely mobile receptors, G proteins, and effectors (1Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar, 2Hamm H.E. Gilchrist A. Curr. Opin.

Farfel Z. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1998; 394: 35-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Based on this concept, current models predict that the heterotrimer face that interacts with receptors comprises the NH2 and COOH termini of GÎ±, exposed residues on helix Î±5 and strand Î²6, as well as the COOH terminus of the Î³-subunit and the sixth or seventh WD repeat of GÎ². The Î±-helical domain is thought to form the cytosolic pole of GÎ± (1Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar, 2Hamm H.E. Gilchrist A. Curr. Opin.

However, heterotrimeric G proteins are enriched in highly organized vesicular invaginations of the plasma membrane termed caveolae, which may represent sites of assembly of a signal transducing complex that could include receptors, G proteins, effectors, and even intracellular targets of the second messengers generated (28Li S.

It has been reported that G proteins bind to chief structural proteins of these organelles, the caveolins, via a sequence that lies between the switch-I and switch-II regions of the Î±-subunit (28Li S.

An incorporation of this latter site into structural models of the receptor/G protein complex changes the predicted orientation of the G protein in a way that brings the Î±-helical domain in close proximity to the membrane, which is consistent with the present data predicting a direct contact of activated Î²-adrenergic receptors with the distal end of helix A and the beginning of the following loop. Overall, it thus appears that antibody K-20 defines an as yet unrecognized contact site for Î²-adrenergic receptors on GÎ±s that localizes to the Î±-helical domain. This latter segment is the first example of a receptor binding region outside the core GTPase domain of GÎ± and is essential for eliciting the responses transmitted by both GÎ±s and GÎ²Î³s. As yet, the most precisely defined site of receptor contact involves the extreme carboxyl terminus, which is thought to be of fundamental importance for receptor recognition and G protein activation (1Neer E.J.

Indeed, COOH-terminal anti-GÎ±s and the peptide corresponding to its target sequence were as efficacious as peptide 100â119 in blocking the isoproterenol-induced stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, indicating that the extreme carboxyl terminus is in fact necessary for Î²-adrenergic receptor signaling via GÎ±s. However, in contrast to peptide 100â119, COOH-terminal anti-GÎ±s failed to prevent the isoproterenol-induced suppression of NADPH-dependent H2O2generation, a GÎ²Î³s-mediated response. Thus, a contact of activated Î²-adrenergic receptors with the extreme carboxyl terminus of GÎ±s appears to be required solely for receptor signaling via GÎ±s but is apparently not critical for receptor recognition and dissociation of the Gsheterotrimer. The latter finding is difficult to reconcile with current models of G protein activation but is consistent with the observations of others, indicating that COOH-terminal GÎ±s antibodies act as reliable and specific inhibitors of receptor signaling via GÎ±-subunits only. By contrast, their effects on GÎ²Î³-mediated responses are variable and may depend on the G protein, receptors, or cell type studied. Thus, antibodies directed against the COOH termini of GÎ±q and GÎ±13 have been shown to block signaling by m3 muscarinic and AT1A angiotensin II receptors via both types of component subunits of Gq and G13, while anti- GÎ±i1, and anti-GÎ±o, or anti-GÎ±s had no effect on GÎ²Î³-mediated responses elicited by sstr 3-somatostatin receptor stimulation or during transcytosis, respectively (23Bomsel M.

Together with the essential role of the epitope recognized by antibody K-20, the observation that COOH-terminal anti-GÎ±sselectively impaired Î²-adrenergic receptor signaling via GÎ±s without affecting the GÎ²Î³s-mediated response is consistent with the concept that Î²-adrenergic receptors interact with multiple sites on GÎ±s, each playing a distinct role, as has also been proposed by others (39Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). More importantly, this latter finding implies that the activation and/or release of GÎ²Î³s by ligand-occupied Î²-adrenergic receptors may not require the simultaneous activation of GÎ±s, which is in marked contrast to current concepts of G protein regulation. A subunit-specific activation of a G protein has in fact been described for the insulin-like growth factor II receptor, which may selectively turn on GÎ±Î¹2-mediated pathways (40Ikezu T. Okamoto T. Giambarella U. Yokota T. Nishimoto J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29224-29228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, this latter type of selectivity is achieved through sequestration of free Î²Î³-subunits by the activated receptors, which is not comparable with the mechanism outlined above. Whether receptors exist that selectively activate GÎ± without affecting the function of GÎ²Î³ or vice versa remains to be established. In conclusion, the current findings show that a commercially available polyclonal antiserum directed against residues 100â119 within the Î±-helical domain of GÎ±s (K-20) acts as a Î²-adrenergic receptor-mimetic agent, and defines a novel contact site for activated Î²-adrenergic receptors that localizes to the Î±-helical domain. In contrast to the COOH terminus of GÎ±s, which seems to be critical for Î²-adrenergic receptor signaling via GÎ±sonly, the epitope recognized by antibody K-20 appears to be essential for eliciting the complete spectrum of Î²-adrenergic responses mediated by both GÎ±s as well as GÎ²Î³s.
