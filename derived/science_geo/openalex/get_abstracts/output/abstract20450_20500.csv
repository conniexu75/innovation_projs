https://openalex.org/W2137433289,"An expression vector was modified to permit the rapid synthesis of purified, 32P-labeled, glutathione S-transferase (GST)-retinoblastoma (RB) fusion proteins. The products were used to screen lambda gt11 expression libraries, from which we cloned a cDNA encoding a polypeptide (RBAP-1) capable of binding directly to a putative functional domain (the pocket) of the retinoblastoma gene product (RB). The RB ""pocket"" is known to bind, directly or indirectly, to the cellular transcription factor, E2F, implicated in cell growth control. We have found that RBAP-1 copurifies with E2F, interacts specifically with the adenovirus E4 ORF 6/7 protein, binds specifically and directly to a known E2F DNA recognition sequence, and contains a functional tranasactivation domain. Therefore, RBAP-1 is a species of E2F and can bind specifically to the RB pocket."
https://openalex.org/W2037870474,"The retinoblastoma protein (pRB) plays an important role in the control of cell proliferation, apparently by binding to and regulating cellular transcription factors such as E2F. Here we describe the characterization of a cDNA clone that encodes a protein with properties of E2F. This clone, RBP3, was identified by the ability of its gene product to interact with pRB. RBP3 bound to pRB both in vitro and in vivo, and this binding was competed by viral proteins known to disrupt pRB-E2F association. RBP3 bound to E2F recognition sequences in a sequence-specific manner. Furthermore, transient expression of RBP3 caused a 10-fold transactivation of the adenovirus E2 promoter, and this transactivation was dependent on the E2F recognition sequences. These properties suggest that RBP3 encodes E2F, or an E2F-like protein."
https://openalex.org/W1985656017,"The function of cadherin cell adhesion molecules is thought to be regulated by a group of cytoplasmic proteins, including alpha-catenin. We identified a subtype of alpha-catenin, termed alpha N-catenin, which is associated with N-cadherin and expressed mainly in the nervous system. cDNA transfection experiments showed that alpha N-catenin can also bind with E-cadherin. To investigate the role of alpha N-catenin, we transfected lung carcinoma PC9 cells, which express E-cadherin and beta-catenin but neither alpha- nor alpha N-catenin, with alpha N-catenin cDNA. While parental PC9 grew as isolated cells, the transfectant lines formed aggregates in which cells were tightly adhered to each other, showing epithelial arrangements, and they occasionally gave rise to cystic spheres. These results suggest that alpha N-catenin is crucial not only for cadherin function but also for organization of multicellular structures."
https://openalex.org/W2097794761,"The iron storage protein ferritin consists of a spherical polypeptide shell (apoferritin) surrounding a 6-nanometer inorganic core of the hydrated iron oxide ferrihydrite (5Fe2O3⋅9H2O). Previous studies have shown that the in vitro reconstitution of apoferritin yields mineral cores essentially identical to those of the native proteins. A magnetic mineral was synthesized within the nanodimensional cavity of horse spleen ferritin by the use of controlled reconstitution conditions. Transmission electron microscopy and electron diffraction analysis indicate that the entrapped mineral particles are discrete 6-nanometer spherical single crystals of the ferrimagnetic iron oxide magnetite (Fe3O4). The resulting magnetic protein, ""magnetoferritin,"" could have uses in biomedical imaging, cell labeling, and separation procedures."
https://openalex.org/W2103880491,"The cell wall of gram-positive bacteria can be thought of as representing a unique cell compartment, which contains anchored surface proteins that require specific sorting signals. Some biologically important products are anchored in this way, including protein A and fibronectin binding protein of Staphylococcus aureus and streptococcal M protein. Studies of staphylococcal protein A and Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase show that the signal both necessary and sufficient for cell wall anchoring consists of an LPXTGX motif, a C-terminal hydrophobic domain, and a charged tail. These sequence elements are conserved in many surface proteins from different gram-positive bacteria. We propose the existence of a hitherto undescribed sorting mechanism that positions proteins on the surface of gram-positive bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2046555621,"Murine interleukin-4 (IL-4) exhibits potent antitumor activity when present at the site of tumor cell challenge. Associated with tumor cell death is the appearance of an inflammatory infiltrate comprised predominantly of eosinophils and macrophages, but with few lymphocytes. Antibodies that specifically block the accumulation of granulocytes at the site of inflammation were injected in vivo to define the cell type responsible for the antitumor action of IL-4. These studies implicate eosinophils in IL-4-mediated tumor cytotoxicity. The lymphoid-independent nature of IL-4 action is supported by the analysis of mutant mouse strains with defined lymphocyte immunodeficiencies. The observed regression of established tumor masses by localized IL-4 action provides a rationale for exploring IL-4-mediated tumor killing as a potential therapy for human malignant disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2079140747,"The course of infection with the protozoan parasite Leishmania is determined in part by their early replication in macrophages, the exclusive host cells for these organisms. Although factors contributing to the survival of Leishmania are not well understood, cytokines influence the course of infection. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a multipotential cytokine with diverse effects on cells of the immune system, including down-regulation of certain macrophage functions. Leishmanial infection induced the production of active TGF-beta, both in vitro and in vivo. TGF-beta was important for determining in vivo susceptibility to experimental leishmanial infection."
https://openalex.org/W2090509456,"We have devised a genetic strategy to isolate the target of acidic activation domains of transcriptional activators based on toxicity in yeast cells of the chimeric activator, GAL4-VP16. Toxicity required the integrity of both the VP16 acidic activation domain and the GAL4 DNA-binding domain, suggesting that inhibition resulted from trapping of general transcription factors at genomic sites. Mutations that break the interaction between GAL4-VP16 and general factors would alleviate toxicity and identify transcriptional adaptors, if adaptors bridged the interaction between activators and general factors. We thus identified ADA1, ADA2, and ADA3. Mutations in ADA2 reduced the activity of GAL4-VP16 and GCN4 in vivo. ada2 mutant extracts exhibited normal basal transcription, but were defective in responding to GAL4-VP16, GCN4, or the dA:dT activator. Strikingly, the mutant extract responded like wild type to GAL4-HAP4. We conclude that ADA2 potentiates the activity of one class of acidic activation domain but not a second class."
https://openalex.org/W2037196975,"We describe the characterization of the Drosophila gene, corkscrew (csw), which is maternally required for normal determination of cell fates at the termini of the embryo. Determination of terminal cell fates is mediated by a signal transduction pathway that involves a receptor tyrosine kinase, torso, a serine/threonine kinase, D-raf, and the transcription factors, tailless and huckebein. Double mutant and cellular analyses between csw, torso, D-raf, and tailless indicate that csw acts downstream of torso and in concert with D-raf to positively transduce the torso signal via tailless, to downstream terminal genes. The csw gene encodes a putative nonreceptor protein tyrosine phosphatase covalently linked to two N-terminal SH2 domains, which is similar to the mammalian PTP1C protein."
https://openalex.org/W1968177644,"Interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), the primary transcription factor induced by interferon α, is a complex of four (113, 91, 84, and 48 kd) proteins. This paper reports that the 113, 91, and 84 kd (ISGF3α) proteins of ISGF3 contain conserved SH2 and SH3 domains. A specific interferon α-induced cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase(s) can form a transient complex with ISGF3α proteins. These ISGF3α proteins can be immunoprecipitated by anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies only after interferon α treatment. Phosphoamino acid analyses of 32P-labeled ISGF3α proteins confirm that ISGF3α proteins are directly tyrosine phosphorylated both in vitro and in vivo in response to interferon α, and this tyrosine phosphorylation can be inhibited by staurosporine and genistein. Phosphatase treatment of these ISGF3α proteins results in inhibition of ISGF3 complex formation in vitro. These observations indicate that interferon α-induced direct tyrosine phosphorylation of ISGF3α proteins is necessary for activation of the transcription factor ISGF3."
https://openalex.org/W2093005961,"Stress has been shown to impair subsequent learning. To determine whether stress would impair classical conditioning, rats were exposed to inescapable, low-intensity tail shock and subsequently classically conditioned under freely moving conditions with a brief periorbital shock unconditioned stimulus and a white noise conditioned stimulus. Unexpectedly stressed rats exhibited significantly more conditioned eyeblink responses and the magnitude of their individual responses was also enhanced. These results stand in contrast to the learning deficits typically observed and suggest that stress can enhance the acquisition of discrete conditioned responses."
https://openalex.org/W1999219468,"In response to visual stimulation, cells of the cat visual cortex fire rhythmically at frequencies between 30 and 60 hertz. This rhythmic firing can be synchronized among cells in widespread areas of the visual cortex. The visual stimulus conditions under which this process occurs suggest that the synchronization may contribute to the integration of information across broadly displaced parts of the visual field. An intricate mechanism must control the regularity of firing and its synchronization. In vivo whole-cell patch recordings from cells in area 17 have now shown that robust oscillations of membrane potential underlie the regularity of firing seen extracellularly. In the cells studied, the characteristics of the oscillations of membrane potential suggest that such oscillations are produced by rhythmic activity in synaptic inputs. These rhythmic synaptic inputs form the most likely mechanism for the synchronization of activity in neighboring cortical cells."
https://openalex.org/W1568357466,"The effects of anoxia were studied in freshly isolated rat hepatocytes maintained in agarose gel threads and perfused with Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer (KHB). Cytosolic free calcium (Ca2+i) was measured with aequorin, intracellular sodium (Na+i) with SBFI, intracellular pH (pHi) with BCECF, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) by the increase in NADH absorbance during lactate oxidation to pyruvate, ATP by 31P NMR spectroscopy in real time, and intracellular free Mg2+ (Mg2+i) from the chemical shift of beta-ATP relative to alpha-ATP in the NMR spectra. Anoxia was induced by perfusing the cells with KHB saturated with 95% N2, 5% CO2. After 1 h of anoxia, beta-ATP fell 66%, and 85% after 2 h, while the Pi/ATP ratio increased 10-fold from 2.75 to 28.3. Under control conditions, the resting cytosolic free calcium was 127 +/- 6 nM. Anoxia increased Ca2+i in two distinct phases: a first rise occurred within 15 min and reached a mean value of 389 +/- 35 nM (p less than 0.001). A second peak reached a maximum value of 1.45 +/- 0.12 microM (p less than 0.001) after 1 h. During the first hour of anoxia, Na+i increased from 15.9 +/- 2.4 mM to 32.2 +/- 1.2 mM (p less than 0.001), Mg2+i doubled from 0.51 +/- 0.05 to 1.12 +/- 0.01 mM (p less than 0.001), and pHi decreased from 7.41 +/- 0.03 to 7.06 +/- 0.1 (p less than 0.001). LDH release doubled during the first hour and increased 6-fold during the second hour of anoxia. Upon reoxygenation, ATP, Ca2+i, Mg2+i, Na+i, and LDH returned near the control levels within 45 min. To determine whether the increased LDH release was related to the rise in Ca2+i, and whether the increased Ca2+i was caused by Ca2+ influx, the cells were perfused with Ca(2+)-free KHB (+ 0.1 mM EGTA) during the anoxic period. After 2 h of anoxia in Ca(2+)-free medium, beta-ATP again fell 90%, but Ca2+i, after the first initial peak, fell below control levels, and LDH release increased only 2.7-fold. During reoxygenation, Ca2+i, ATP, Na+i, and LDH returned near the control levels within 45 min. These results suggest that the rise in Ca2+i induced by anoxia is caused by an influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular fluid, and that LDH release and cell injury may be related to the resulting rise in Ca2+i."
https://openalex.org/W1535725499,"The lipid activators of protein kinase C, phosphatidylserine and diacylglycerol, induce a reversible conformational change that exposes the auto-inhibitory pseudosubstrate domain of the enzyme. The pseudosubstrate domain of beta-II protein kinase C is cleaved after the first residue, arginine 19, by the endoproteinase Arg-C only when the kinase is bound to the activating lipid phosphatidylserine. Exposure of this residue is markedly enhanced by diacylglycerol. In contrast, the pseudosubstrate domain is not cleaved in the absence of lipids, when protein kinase C is bound to non-activating acidic lipids, when the kinase has autophosphorylated on the amino terminus, or after dilution of the activating lipids. This work reveals specificity in the interaction of protein kinase C with phosphatidylserine since only this phospholipid causes the specific conformational change detected in the regulatory domain of the enzyme, and demonstrates that allosteric regulators expose the intramolecular auto-inhibitory domain of a kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1983058620,"The elucidation of bioactive conformations of small peptide hormones remains an elusive goal to structural chemists because of the inherent flexibility of these molecules. Angiotensin II (AII), the major effector of the renin-angiotensin system, is an octapeptide hormone for which no clear structural models exist. Peptide hormones such as AII share the property that they bind to their receptors with high affinities, in spite of the fact that they must overcome an extremely large conformational entropy barrier to bind in one conformation. A ""surrogate system"" that consists of a high-affinity monoclonal antibody (MAb) and AII has been used to study a bound conformation of AII. The crystallographic structure of the complex reveals a structure of AII that is compatible with predicted bioactive conformations of AII derived from structure-activity studies and theoretical calculations. In the complex, the deeply bound hormone is folded into a compact structure in which two turns bring the amino and carboxyl termini close together. The antibody of this complex (MAb 131) has the unusual property that it was not generated against AII, but rather against an anti-idiotypic antibody reactive with a MAb to AII, which renders this antibody an anti-anti-idiotypic antibody. The high affinity for AII of the original MAb to AII was passed on to MAb 131 through a structural determinant on the anti-idiotypic antibody. Strikingly, the conformation of AII in this complex is highly similar to complementarity determining region loops of antibodies, possibly indicating that a true molecular mimic of bound AII was present on the anti-idiotypic antibody against which MAb 131 was elicited."
https://openalex.org/W2090738016,"It has long been thought that anteroposterior (A-P) pattern in the vertebrate central nervous system is induced in the embryo's dorsal ectoderm exclusively by signals passing vertically from underlying, patterned dorsal mesoderm. Explants from early gastrulae of the frog Xenopus laevis were prepared in which vertical contact between dorsal ectoderm and mesoderm was prevented but planar contact was maintained. In these, four position-specific neural markers (engrailed-2, Krox-20, XlHbox 1, and XlHbox 6) were expressed in the ectoderm in the same A-P order as in the embryo. Thus, planar signals alone, following a path available in the normal embryo, can induce A-P neural pattern."
https://openalex.org/W1549694960,"A subtraction library was constructed from human insulinoma (beta cell tumor) and glucagonoma (alpha cell tumor) cDNA phagemid libraries. Differential screening of 153 clones with end-labeled mRNAs from insulinoma, glucagonoma, and HeLa cells resulted in the isolation of a novel cDNA clone designated IA-1. This cDNA clone has a 2838-base pair sequence consisting of an open reading frame of 1530 nucleotides, which translates into a protein of 510 amino acids with a pI value of 9.1 and a molecular mass of 52,923 daltons. At the 3'-untranslated region there are seven ATTTA sequences between two polyadenylation signals (AATAAA). The IA-1 protein can be divided into two domains based upon the features of its amino acid sequence. The NH2-terminal domain of the deduced protein sequence (amino acids 1-250) has four classical pro-hormone dibasic conversion sites and an amidation signal sequence, Pro-Gly-Lys-Arg. The COOH-terminal domain (amino acids 251-510) contains five putative zinc-finger DNA-binding motifs of the form X3-Cys-X2-4-Cys-X12-His-X3-4-His-X4 which has been described as a consensus sequence for members of the Cys2-His2 DNA-binding protein class. Northern blot analysis revealed IA-1 mRNA in five of five human insulinoma and three of three murine insulinoma cell lines. Expression of this gene was undetectable in normal tissues. Additional tissue studies revealed that the message is expressed in several tumor cell lines of neuroendocrine origin including pheochromocytoma, medullary thyroid carcinoma, insulinoma, pituitary tumor, and small cell lung carcinoma. The restricted tissue distribution and unique sequence motifs suggest that this novel cDNA clone may encode a protein associated with the transformation of neuroendocrine cells."
https://openalex.org/W1529469385,"Enzymological studies have implicated two Ca(2+)-dependent endopeptidases in the conversion of proinsulin to insulin; a type 1 activity which cleaves on the C-terminal side of Arg31-Arg32 and a type 2 activity which cleaves C-terminally to Lys64-Arg65 in the proinsulin sequence. The possibility that these enzymes are related to the recently discovered family of mammalian subtilisin-like gene products (furin, PC2, and PC3) and the yeast propheromone-converting enzyme (KEX-2), was investigated. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers flanking the putative catalytic domain within this gene family were used in a polymerase chain reaction to amplify related sequences from rat insulinoma cDNA. One major product of 700 base pairs was obtained which was greater than 99% identical to the corresponding rat PC2 sequence. This cDNA was subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-3X to generate a recombinant protein for antibody production. Western blot analysis showed the immunoreactivity was prominent in neuroendocrine tissues as a 65-kDa protein. It was concentrated in secretory granule-enriched fractions of insulinoma tissue, where it was present as a readily solubilized monomeric protein. Deglycosylation studies using endoglycosidase H and N-glycanase showed that the 65-kDa protein was comprised of approximately 9% carbohydrate, consistent with the presence of three consensus sequences for N-linked glycosylation in rat PC2. The immunoreactivity co-eluted with the type 2 proinsulin endopeptidase on gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography and the antisera specifically immunoprecipitated type 2 activity from insulin granule extracts. N-terminal sequence analysis of the immunoreactive protein gave two sequences which corresponded to residues 109-112 and 112-119 of rat PC2. This indicated that posttranslational processing of PC2 itself occurs C-terminally to basic amino acids to produce the mature enzyme. It is concluded that PC2 is the type 2 endopeptidase involved in proinsulin conversion. Localization of PC2 immunoreactivity to other tissues of the diffuse neuroendocrine system suggests that the type 2 endopeptidase also functions in the processing of precursor forms of other prohormones and polypeptide neurotransmitters."
https://openalex.org/W1527433663,"The expression and localization of bovine beta 1,4-galactosyltransferase (Gal T) has been studied in mammalian cells transfected with Gal T cDNA constructs, and the role of the amino-terminal domains of Gal T in Golgi localization examined. Here we demonstrate that the transmembrane (signal/anchor) domain of bovine Gal T contains a positive Golgi retention signal. Bovine Gal T was characterized in transfected cells with anti-bovine Gal T antibodies, affinity-purified from a rabbit antiserum using a bacterial recombinant fusion protein. These affinity-purified antibodies recognized native bovine Gal T and showed minimum cross-reactivity with Gal T from non-bovine sources. Bovine Gal T cDNA was expressed, as active enzyme, transiently in COS-1 cells and stably in murine L cells, and the product was shown to be localized to the Golgi complex by immunofluorescence using the polypeptide-specific antibodies. A low level of surface bovine Gal T was also detected in the transfected L cells by flow cytometry. The removal of 18 of the 24 amino acids from the cytoplasmic domain of bovine Gal T did not alter the Golgi localization of the product transiently expressed in COS-1 cells or stably expressed in L cells. Both the full-length bovine Gal T and the cytoplasmic domain deletion mutant were N-glycosylated in the transfected L cells, indicating both proteins have the correct N(in)/C(out) membrane orientation. Deletion of both the cytoplasmic and signal/anchor domains of bovine Gal T and incorporation of a cleavable signal sequence resulted in a truncated soluble bovine Gal T that was rapidly secreted (within 1 h) from transfected COS-1 cells. Replacement of the signal/anchor domain of bovine Gal T with the signal/anchor domain of the human transferrin receptor resulted in the transport of the hybrid molecule to the cell surface of transfected COS-1 cells. Furthermore, a hybrid construct containing the signal/anchor domain of Gal T with ovalbumin was efficiently retained in the Golgi complex, whereas ovalbumin anchored to the membrane by the transferrin receptor signal/anchor was expressed at the cell surface of transfected COS-1 cells. Overall, these studies show that the hydrophobic, signal/anchor domain of Gal T is both necessary and sufficient for Golgi localization."
https://openalex.org/W1541425590,"The 4F2 cell surface antigen is a disulfide-linked heterodimer induced during the process of cellular activation and expressed widely in mammalian tissues (Parmacek, M. S., Karpinski, B. A., Gottesdiener, K. M., Thompson, C. B., and Leiden, J. M. (1989) Nucleic Acids Res. 17, 1915-1931). The human heavy chain component, a type II membrane glycoprotein, has 29% identity to the amino acid transport-related protein encoded by the recently cloned rat D2 cDNA. We have demonstrated that Xenopus oocytes injected with in vitro transcribed cRNA from D2 take up cystine and dibasic and neutral amino acids (Wells, R. G., and Hediger, M. A. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 89, 5596-5600). In the present study, we examine the role of the human 4F2 heavy chain in amino acid transport. In vitro transcribed 4F2 cRNA was injected into Xenopus oocytes which were assayed for the uptake of radiolabeled amino acids. Our results show that cRNA from 4F2 stimulates the uptake of dibasic and neutral amino acids into oocytes at levels up to 3-fold higher than for water-injected control oocytes. There is no demonstrable uptake of cystine. Uptake is saturable, with characteristics of high affinity transport, and inhibition data suggest that uptake occurs via a single transporter. Dibasic amino acids are taken up by both 4F2 and D2 cRNA-injected oocytes in a sodium-independent manner. In contrast, 4F2-induced but not D2-induced neutral amino acid uptake has a significant component of sodium dependence. Likewise, neutral amino acids in excess inhibit the 4F2-induced uptake of radiolabeled arginine but not leucine in a sodium-dependent manner. The 4F2-induced uptake we observe most likely represents the activity of a single transport system with some characteristics of systems y+, b0,+, and B0,+. We suggest that 4F2 and D2 represent a new family of proteins which induce amino acid transport with distinct characteristics, possibly functioning as transport activators or regulators."
https://openalex.org/W2032260999,"Laboratory isolates of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) such as HTLV-IIIB are generally T cell line-tropic and highly sensitive to neutralization by soluble CD4 (sCD4), a potential antiviral agent that is undergoing clinical trial. However, many primary HIV-1 isolates are macrophage-tropic and sCD4-resistant. Envelope V3 loop sequences derived from primary HIV-1 isolates were sufficient to confer on HTLV-IIIB not only the tissue tropism but also the degree of sCD4 neutralization resistance characteristic of their HIV-1 strains of origin. Single amino acid changes in the V3 loop enhanced sCD4 resistance by up to tenfold. These observations suggest that the tissue tropism and sCD4 neutralization sensitivity of HIV-1 isolates are regulated by similar mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1585344925,"Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate induces a 3- and 10-fold induction of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity in HT1080 and HeLa cells, respectively, following transient transfection of a 336-base pair plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) promoter fragment linked to a CAT reporter gene. Substitution mutations in the regions encompassing nucleotides -78 to -69 (TGGGTGGGGC) or -61 to -54 (TGAGTTCA), but not in the regions -155 to -149 (TGCCTCA) or -84 to -76 (AGTGAGTGG) reduced this induction. Gel electrophoresis of double-stranded -65 to -50 oligonucleotides of the PAI-1 promoter region and nuclear extracts from Hela cells produced a gel shift pattern similar to that obtained with a AP-1 consensus oligomer, and excess unlabeled AP-1 oligomer reverted binding, suggesting that this region of the PAI-1 promoter is an AP-1-like binding site. Gel electrophoresis of double-stranded -82 to -65 oligonucleotides with HeLa nuclear extracts revealed a gel shift pattern of three bands; Sp1 consensus oligomer competed with the binding to two of these bands and AP-2 consensus sequence oligomer with the binding to the third band. The -82 to -65 oligomer also bound to purified AP-2 and Sp1 proteins. Southwestern blotting of HeLa nuclear extracts revealed that the labeled oligomer spanning region -82 to -65 bound to proteins with molecular masses of 52 and 72 kDa. Consensus AP-2 oligonucleotides competed for binding of the labeled -82 to -65 oligonucleotide to the 52-kDa protein, but consensus Sp-1 oligonucleotides did not compete for binding to the 72-kDa compound. The 72-kDa component binding to the -82 to -65 region may represent a new protein involved in transcriptional regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1552224126,"Bacteriophage T7 gene 2.5 protein has been purified to homogeneity from cells overexpressing its gene. Native gene 2.5 protein consists of a dimer of two identical subunits of molecular weight 25,562. Gene 2.5 protein binds specifically to single-stranded DNA with a stoichiometry of approximately 7 nucleotides bound per monomer of gene 2.5 protein; binding appears to be noncooperative. Electron microscopic analysis shows that gene 2.5 protein is able to disrupt the secondary structure of single-stranded DNA. The single-stranded DNA is extended into a chain of gene 2.5 protein dimers bound along the DNA. In fluorescence quenching and nitrocellulose filter binding assays, the binding constants of gene 2.5 protein to single-stranded DNA are 1.2 x 10(6) M-1 and 3.8 x 10(6) M-1, respectively. Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein and phage T4 gene 32 protein bind to single-stranded DNA more tightly by a factor of 25. Fluorescence spectroscopy suggests that tyrosine residue(s), but not tryptophan residues, on gene 2.5 protein interacts with single-stranded DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1593098818,"Abstract The four principal cellular constituents of the mouse intestinal epithelium are all derived from a multipotent stem cell functionally anchored near the base of its crypts. Differentiation of enterocytes, enteroendocrine, and goblet cells occurs during an orderly upward migration from monoclonal crypts supplied by a single active stem cell to adjacent polyclonal small intestinal villi or to their colonic homologs, the surface epithelial cuffs. Paneth cells differentiate as they descend to the base of crypts. This epithelium undergoes rapid and perpetual renewal yet is able to maintain cephalocaudal (duodenal-to-colonic) differences in the differentiation programs of its four cell types from the time of its initial cytodifferentiation in late fetal life (embryonic (E) days 16-17). Rat liver fatty acid-binding protein/human growth hormone transgenes (Fabpl/hGH) have been used as novel phenotypic markers to describe the biological properties of gut stem cells and the differentiation programs of their enterocytic and enteroendocrine lineages. To determine whether the multipotent stem cell is able to retain a address in the absence of luminal signals, we prepared isografts from the proximal small intestine or distal small intestine and colon of E15-E16 Fabpl/hGH transgenic mice and their normal littermates and implanted them into the subcutaneous tissues of young, adult male CBY/B6 nude mice. Immunocytochemical and histochemical studies indicate that appropriate position-specific differences in the differentiation programs of each of the four principal cell lineages are present along the cephalocaudal and crypt-to-villus (or crypt-to-epithelial cuff) axes of isografts harvested 4-6 weeks after implantation. This suggests that the gut stem cell can be characterized not only by its multipotency and enormous capacity for self-renewal but also by its ability to be programmed (? imprinted) with positional information. Transgene expression is reduced in a number of enteroendocrine subpopulations in small intestinal and colonic isografts compared to the intact gut. Moreover, the decision to express the Fabpl/hGH transgene appears to be coordinated between adjacent crypts as evidenced by (i) the presence of multicrypt patches of wholly reporter (hGH)-positive or reporter-negative cells in the intact colon and in colonic isografts and (ii) by the presence of coherent bands of reporter-positive or -negative cells that emanate from adjacent monophenotypic crypts and extend to the apical extrusion zone of distal small intestinal villi.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1530429246,"Bacteriophage T7 gene 2.5 protein has been shown to interact with T7 DNA polymerase (the complex of T7 gene 5 protein and Escherichia coli thioredoxin) by affinity chromatography and fluorescence emission anisotropy. T7 DNA polymerase binds specifically to a resin coupled to gene 2.5 protein and elutes from the resin when the ionic strength of the buffer is raised to 250 mM NaCl. In contrast, T7 gene 5 protein alone binds more weakly to gene 2.5 protein, eluting when the ionic strength of the buffer is 50 mM NaCl. Thioredoxin does not bind to gene 2.5 protein. Steady-state fluorescence emission anisotropy gives a dissociation constant of 1.1 +/- 0.2 microM for the complex of gene 2.5 protein and T7 DNA polymerase, with a ratio of gene 2.5 protein to T7 DNA polymerase in the complex of 1:1. Nanosecond emission anisotropic analysis suggests that the complex contains one monomer each of gene 2.5 protein, gene 5 protein, and thioredoxin. The ability of T7 gene 2.5 protein to stimulate the activity and processivity of T7 DNA polymerase is compared with the ability of three other single-stranded DNA-binding proteins: E. coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein, T4 gene 32 protein, and E. coli recA protein. All except E. coli recA protein stimulate the activity and processivity of T7 DNA polymerase; E. coli recA protein inhibits these activities."
https://openalex.org/W1494112528,"Sphingosine displays multiple biochemical and biological effects, in particular inhibition and activation of protein kinases. To determine the predominant interaction of sphingosine with cellular kinases, the effects of sphingosine on endogenous protein phosphorylation in Jurkat T lymphoblastic cells were investigated in vitro. Sphingosine was found to cause prominent phosphorylation of a number of cytosolic proteins ranging in molecular mass from 18 to 165 kDa. Phosphorylation was calcium-independent. Phosphorylation of substrates was increased in response to concentrations of sphingosine as low as 10 microM and peaked at concentrations of 20-200 microM. Multiple lines of evidence suggested that sphingosine activated more than one protein kinase: 1) the concentration dependence on sphingosine differed from substrate to substrate, 2) phosphorylation of one group of substrates required ATP as the phosphate donor, whereas a second group showed no preference between ATP and GTP, and 3) phosphorylation of some substrates was inhibited by heparin, whereas other substrates were resistant. Activation of these kinases demonstrated a very specific requirement for D-erythro-sphingoid bases. DL-erythro-dihydrosphingosine was partially active, whereas DL-threo-dihydrosphingosine was not. Other related molecules such as stearylamine, sphingomyelin, and C2-ceramide were not active. Sphingosine-activated kinase(s) were distinct from protein kinase C, cyclic nucleotide-activated kinases, and calcium-dependent kinases. These observations demonstrate the existence of multiple sphingosine-activated protein kinases with high specificity for D-erythro-sphingosine, suggesting physiologic regulation of protein phosphorylation by sphingosine."
https://openalex.org/W1507466570,"The behavior of an array of fluorescent human alpha-thrombin derivatives in reporting binding of the fragment 2 domain of prothrombin was characterized as a representative application of the active-site-selective labeling approach to studies of blood coagulation proteinase regulatory interactions. An array of 16 thrombin derivatives was prepared by affinity labeling of the proteinase active site with the thioester peptide chloromethyl ketones, N alpha-[(acetylthio)acetyl]-D-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl or N alpha-[(acetylthio)acetyl]-D-Phe-Phe-Arg-CH2Cl, followed by selective modification of the NH2OH-generated thiol group on the covalently incorporated inhibitors with each of eight thiol-reactive fluorescence probes. The changes in probe fluorescence intensity of the derivatives, signaling changes in the environment of the catalytic site associated with fragment 2 binding, appeared to be a unique and unpredictable function of the structure of the probe and the connecting peptide. These results demonstrated the utility of the labeling approach for overcoming the problem of not being able to predict which fluorescent label will provide the most useful proteinase derivative for investigating an interaction by enabling a greater variety of them to be prepared and screened for those with the most desirable properties. To determine whether the approach could be extended to other proteinases, the specificity of labeling with the fluorescence probe iodoacetamide, 5-(iodoacetamido)fluorescein, by use of the two thioester inhibitors was evaluated for several other blood coagulation proteinases and related trypsin-like enzymes. All of the proteinases were labeled in an active-site-selective manner. The combined results of quantitating the labeling reactions for the proteinase and inhibitor combinations studied thus far showed active-site-specific incorporation of 0.98 +/- 0.10 mol of inhibitor/mol of active sites and 0.92 +/- 0.11 mol of probe/mol of active sites, representing an overall greater than or equal to 93% site-specificity of labeling. These results demonstrated the broad applicability of the labeling approach for fluorescence studies of proteinases that differ greatly in their catalytic specificities."
https://openalex.org/W1561754897,"We have raised a rabbit antiserum to a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C terminus (residues 400-416) of the Rh30A polypeptide. The rabbit antiserum reacted with the Rh30B (D30) polypeptide in addition to the Rh30A (C/c and/or E/e) polypeptide(s), indicating that these proteins share homology at their C termini. The antiserum did not react with erythrocyte membranes from an individual with Rh(null) syndrome. The rabbit antiserum immunoprecipitated Rh polypeptides from erythrocyte membranes and alkali-stripped membranes, but not from intact erythrocytes. Treatment of intact red cells with carboxypeptidase Y did not affect the reactivity of the antiserum, whereas treatment of alkali-stripped and unsealed erythrocyte ghost membranes resulted in the loss of antibody binding. Carboxypeptidase A treatment of intact erythrocytes and alkali-stripped membranes had no effect on antibody binding, indicating that the C-terminal domains of the Rh polypeptides contain lysine, arginine, proline, or histidine residues. These results show that the C termini of the Rh polypeptides are located toward the cytoplasmic face of the erythrocyte membrane. Treatment of intact radioiodinated erythrocytes with bromelain followed by immunoprecipitation with monoclonal anti-D gave a band of M(r) 24,000-25,000, indicating that the Rh30B (D30) polypeptide is cleaved at an extracellular domain close to the N or C terminus, with loss of the major radioiodinated domain. Immunoblotting of bromelain treated D-positive erythrocyte membranes with the rabbit antiserum to the C-terminal peptide revealed a new band of M(r) 6000-6500, indicating that the extracellular bromelain cleavage site is located near the C terminus of the molecule. The band of M(r) 6000-6500 was not obtained in erythrocyte membranes derived from bromelain treated D-negative erythrocytes. Erythrocytes of the rare -D- phenotype appear to either totally lack, or have gross alterations in, the Cc/Ee polypeptide(s), since the bromelain treatment of these cells resulted in the total loss of staining in the M(r) 35,000-37,000 region and the concomitant appearance of the new band of M(r) 6000-6500."
https://openalex.org/W1541822450,"We identify His381 of Pseudomonas mevalonii 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase as the basic residue functional in catalysis. The catalytic domain of 20 HMG-CoA reductases contains a single conserved histidine (His381 of the P. mevalonii enzyme). Diethyl pyrocarbonate inactivated the P. mevalonii enzyme, and hydroxylamine partially restored activity. We changed His381 to alanine, lysine, asparagine, and glutamine. The mutant proteins were overexpressed, purified to homogeneity, and characterized. His381 mutant enzymes were not inactivated by diethyl pyrocarbonate. All four mutant enzymes exhibited wild-type crystal morphology and chromatographed on substrate affinity supports like wild-type enzyme. The mutant enzymes had low catalytic activity (Vmax 0.06-0.5% that of wild-type enzyme), but Km values approximated those for wild-type enzyme. For wild-type enzyme and mutant enzymes H381A, H381N, and H381Q, Km values at pH 8.1 were 0.45, 0.27, 3.7, and 0.71 mM [(R,S)-mevalonate]; 0.05, 0.03, 0.20, and 0.11 mM [coenzyme A]; 0.22, 0.14, 0.81, and 0.62 mM [NAD+]. Km values at pH 11 for wild-type enzyme and mutant enzyme H381K were 0.32 and 0.75 mM [(R,S)-mevalonate]; 0.24 and 0.50 mM [coenzyme A]; 0.15 and 1.23 mM [NAD+]. Both pK values for the enzyme-substrate complex increased relative to wild-type enzyme (by 1-2.5 pH units for pK1 and by 0.5-1.3 pH units for pK2). For mutant enzyme H381K, the pK1 of 10.2 is consistent with lysine acting as a general base at high pH. His381 of P. mevalonii HMG-CoA reductase, and consequently the histidine of the consensus Leu-Val-Lys-Ser-His-Met-Xaa-Xaa-Asn-Arg-Ser motif of the catalytic domain of eukaryotic HMG-CoA reductases, thus is the general base functional in catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1572697671,The yeast glycogen branching enzyme (EC 2.4.1.18) is shown to be induced in batch culture simultaneously with the onset of intracellular glycogen accumulation. The branching enzyme structural gene (GLC3) has been cloned. Its predicted amino acid sequence is very similar to procaryotic branching enzymes. Northern analysis indicates that GLC3 mRNA abundance increases in late exponential growth phase coincident with glycogen accumulation. Disruption of the branching enzyme structural gene establishes that branching enzyme activity is an absolute requirement for maximal glycogen synthesis.

The sequences of the variable regions of the Ab3 and of the Ab1 are nearly identical, even though the Ab1 is an antibody to a peptide and the Ab3 is an antibody to a globular protein. Significantly, amino acid residues that make critical contacts with antigen in the crystal structure of the Ab3-antigen complex are highly conserved in Ab1, suggesting that the epitopes of the Ab2-beta recognized by the Ab3 do indeed resemble the bound structure of the antigen."
https://openalex.org/W1524449564,"Cell membranes isolated from hamster insulinoma (HIT T15) cells at passages 65-74 contain high and low affinity receptors for a sulfonylurea derivative, 5-[125I]iodo,2-hydroxyglyburide (KD values of approximately 7 nM and 16 microM). Between passages 75 and 85, the estimated B(max) for the high affinity receptor decreases approximately 10-fold from approximately 1.6 to 0.16 pmol/mg membrane protein. By contrast, the density of low affinity binding sites, 800-1000 pmol/mg, is unaltered. The drop in high affinity receptors is paralleled by a decrease in the density of KATP channels assessed using patch-clamp and 86Rb(+)-efflux techniques. These results strongly support the idea that the high affinity sulfonylurea receptor is an integral part of the KATP channel."
https://openalex.org/W2102430103,"Stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy has been used to study the reaction of human alpha-thrombin with recombinant hirudin variant 1 (rhir) at 37 degrees C and an ionic strength of 0.125 M. A 35% enhancement in intrinsic fluorescence accompanied formation of the thrombin-rhir complex. Over one third of this enhancement corresponded to a structural change that could be induced by binding of either the NH2-terminal fragment (residues 1-51) or the COOH-terminal fragment (residues 52-65) of rhir. Three kinetic steps were detected for reaction of thrombin with rhir. At high rhir concentrations (greater than or equal to 3 microM), two intramolecular steps with observed rate constants of 296 +/- 5 s-1 and 50 +/- 1 s-1 were observed. By using the COOH-terminal fragment of rhir as a competitive inhibitor, it was possible to obtain an estimate of 2.9 x 10(8) M-1 s-1 for the effective association rate constant at low rhir concentrations. At higher ionic strengths, this rate constant was lower, which is consistent with the formation of the initial complex involving an ionic interaction. The mechanism for the reaction of both the COOH- and NH2-terminal fragments of rhir appeared to involve two steps. When thrombin was reacted with the COOH-terminal fragment at high concentrations (greater than or equal to 6 microM), the bimolecular step occurred within the dead time of the spectrometer and only one intramolecular step, with a rate constant of 308 +/- 5 s-1 was observed. At concentrations of NH2-terminal fragment below 50 microM, its binding to thrombin appeared to be a bimolecular reaction with an association rate constant of 8.3 x 10(5) M-1 s-1. In the presence of saturating concentrations of the COOH-terminal fragment, a 1.7-fold increase in this rate constant was observed. At concentrations of NH2-terminal fragment greater than 50 microM, biphasic reaction traces were observed which suggests a two-step mechanism. By comparing the reaction amplitudes and dissociation constants observed with rhir and its COOH-terminal fragment, it was possible to obtain approximate estimates for the values of the rate constants of different steps in the formation of the rhir-thrombin complex."
https://openalex.org/W2149453254,"Twenty-two components of human interferon-a (IFN-a) derived from Sendai virus-induced Namalwa cells were purified by sequential immunoadsorbent affinity chromatography using four monoclonal antibody affinity columns followed by ultrafiltration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The specific activity ranged from 0.2 to 2.6 x lo8 IU/mg protein on Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells, 0.3 to 4.6 X lo* IU/mg protein on human WISH cells, and lo4 to 7 x lo5 units/mg protein on mouse L929 cells. The apparent molecular weights of the components ranged from 17,500 to 23,300 using nonreducing sodium dodecyl polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis and 17,500 to 27,600 using reducing sodium dodecyl polyacylamide-gel electrophoresis. The amino-terminal amino acid sequences were similar among the components as well as to those reported for the cloned human IFN-a genes (Pestka, S. (1986) Methods Enzymol. 119, 3-14). However, four components, f, i, 1, and m, have amino-terminal amino acid sequences which appear to be unique when compared to those predicted from the cDNA clones. One component, prea, has a potential N-linked glycosylation site on the Asn of residues 2 through 4, Asn-Leu-Ser."
https://openalex.org/W1602634538,"The alkaline extracellular protease (AEP) of the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica is synthesized as a preproprotein. The precursor undergoes a complex maturation during its intracellular transit, successively involving signal peptide cleavage, dipeptidyl aminopeptidase processing, and cleavage at a dibasic site which results in the extracellular release of the active enzyme. It was previously shown that various deletions within the proregion affect the intracellular transit of the protease. Prodeleted precursors are translocated and have their signal sequences removed, but they accumulate in the secretion apparatus. We show here that the secretion of partially active proteins is restored when the prodomain is supplied in trans as an independent peptide. The secretion rescue and maturation processing that are reconstituted by the free propeptide do not reach wild type efficiency. The results of pulse-chase experiments indicate that a rate-limiting step occurs during the intracellular transit of the rescued precursors, before Kex2p proteolytic cleavage. This delayed maturation seems to be responsible for an overall slower release of the rescued polypeptides. Propeptide and AEP were secreted in equimolar amounts by both wild type and trans-complemented strains, but none could be detected in the supernatant when expressed alone. These experiments suggest that the prodomain of AEP initially acts as a crucial folding aid for the early secretory transit of the translocated precursor. They further suggest that the prodomain is also required for a second structural change of the AEP precursor during its activation."
https://openalex.org/W1597991394,"In a new strategy for labeling the active sites of serine proteinases with fluorescence probes (Bock, P. E. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 6633-6639), a thioester peptide chloromethyl ketone inhibitor is incorporated into the enzyme active center and used to produce a unique thiol group which provides a site for selective chemical modification with any one of many thiol-reactive fluorescence probes. This approach was developed to increase the opportunities for identifying fluorescent proteinase derivatives that act as reporters of binding interactions by allowing a large number of derivatives, representing a broad range of probe spectral properties, to be readily prepared. In the studies described here, the specificity of the labeling approach was evaluated quantitatively for the labeling of human alpha and beta/gamma-thrombin with the thioester peptide chloromethyl ketones, N alpha-[(acetylthio)acetyl]-D-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl and N alpha-[(acetylthio)acetyl]-D-Phe-Phe-Arg-CH2Cl, and the thiol-reactive fluorescence probe, 5-(iodoacetamido)fluorescein. Irreversible inactivation of thrombin by the inhibitors was accompanied by incorporation of 0.98 +/- 0.06 mol/mol of the thioester group into the active site, independent of a 470-fold difference between the thioester peptide chloromethyl ketones in the bimolecular rate constants of alpha-thrombin affinity labeling. Subsequent mild treatment of the covalent thrombin-inhibitor complexes with NH2OH in the presence of 5-(iodoacetamido)fluorescein resulted in generation of the thiol group together with its selective modification and incorporation of 0.96 +/- 0.07 mol of probe/mol of active sites. The incorporated label was localized to a 9000 molecular weight region of alpha and beta/gamma-thrombin containing the catalytic-site histidine residue. Evaluation of competing, side reactions showed that they did not significantly compromise the active site specificity of labeling. These results demonstrated equivalent, active-site-selective fluorescence probe labeling of alpha and beta/gamma-thrombin by use of either of the thioester peptide chloromethyl ketones, with a site specificity of greater than or equal to 94%."
https://openalex.org/W1552748166,"The expression of the genes encoding the three isoforms of the human ADP/ATP translocase (T1, T2, and T3) has been analyzed at different stages of myogenic differentiation in an in vitro muscle cell system and compared with that in mature muscle. The results indicate that the three stages of muscle differentiation corresponding to myoblast proliferation, myotube formation, and mature muscle fibers are characterized by a different pattern of expression of the ADP/ATP translocase genes. In particular, the two T2-specific mRNAs are present at high, similar levels in myoblasts and myotubes and markedly decrease in amount in mature adult muscle. By contrast, the T3-specific mRNA is present in high amount in growing myoblasts, decreases markedly in myotubes, and is barely detectable in adult muscle. Finally, the T1-specific mRNA is present at a high level in adult muscle and is not detectable in either myoblasts or myotubes. Therefore, T1 gene expression appears to be a marker of a late stage in myogenesis. A parallel investigation of expression of the myosin heavy chain mRNA revealed absence of hybridization with the specific probe in RNA from proliferating myoblasts, a significant hybridization in myotube RNA, and a strong signal in adult muscle RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1516518871,"The intact human growth hormone (hGH) gene is negatively regulated by triiodothyronine (T3) treatment in transfected rat pituitary tumor cells. We now demonstrate that this responsiveness is mediated by a negative thyroid hormone response element (nTRE) localized to the proximal 3'-untranslated/3'-flanking region (3'-UT/FR). This region binds thyroid hormone receptors specifically and with high affinity. nTRE function was promoter-dependent, since it suppressed the activity of a positive TRE in the human chorionic somatomammotropin promoter, partially repressed activity of the herpes simplex virus TK promoter, but did not function with the human actin or Rous sarcoma virus promoters. T3 treatment did not alter transcript termination sites nor selectively affect the stability of transcripts containing the hGH 3'-UT/FR when transcription was blocked by actinomycin D treatment. The function of the nTRE depended on its location in the 3'-UT/FR; it was inactive when positioned down-stream of the simian virus 40 (SV40) 3'-UT/FR, and it acted as a positive TRE when placed upstream of the hGH promoter. These results demonstrate a novel localization of a TRE with unique properties which suggests expanded mechanisms by which thyroid hormone receptors can affect gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W1568141302,"Stimulation of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor results in phosphorylation and activation of cytosolic Raf-1 serine/threonine kinase. Herein, we report that enzymatically active Raf-1 is physically associated with the IL-2 receptor beta chain (p75) in T-cell blasts. Following stimulation with IL-2, Raf-1 dissociates from the IL-2 receptor complex and translocates to the cytosol. Genistein, a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, prevents the dissociation of enzymatically active Raf-1 from the ligand-stimulated IL-2 receptor complex. These data favor a model of IL-2 receptor activation in which an IL-2-activated protein tyrosine kinase phosphorylates the IL-2 receptor and/or receptor-bound Raf-1. Following tyrosine phosphorylation, enzymatically active Raf-1 dissociates from the IL-2 receptor and translocates into the cytosol."
https://openalex.org/W1586211816,"Incubation of normal mitochondria at 45 degrees C results in increases of respiration and of total apparent proton conductance (TAPC, respiration/proton motive force) and in an upward shift of the flow-force relationships. Similar effects are observed during operation of the redox proton pumps at different sites of the respiratory chain. These effects are accompanied by an almost equivalent increase of the passive proton conductance (PPC, proton leakage/proton motive force). In mitochondria from 3,3,5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3)-treated rats there are also increases of respiration and of TAPC and an upward shift of flow-force relationships, more pronounced at the level of the cytochrome oxidase proton pump. However, at variance from the incubation at 45 degrees C, in mitochondria from T3-treated rats there is only a slight increase of PPC. Addition of bovine serum albumin to normal mitochondria incubated at 45 degrees C results in a marked depression of TAPC in the nonlinear range of the flow-force relationships. An equivalent effect is not observed in mitochondria from T3-treated rats. The experimental results have been compared with computer simulations obtained on the basis of a chemiosmotic model of energy transduction. The increase of TAPC following incubation at high temperature is apparently due to changes of the proton conductance mainly at the level of PPC, while the increase of TAPC following T3 administration is rather due to changes presumably at the level of the redox or ATPase proton pumps."

Mounting public concerns are driven primarily by a number of epidemiological studies that show increased risks of cancer among populations thought to experience unusual patterns of EMF exposure. Because the scientific evidence on EMF bioeffects is both complicated and contradictory, regulatory bodies and scientific standard-setting organizations have been unable to reach consensus on prescriptive approaches to EMF risk management. Although scientific opinion varies widely about whether the EMF-cancer connection is real, public apprehension over potential EMF hazards has prompted a host of political, legal, and market reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1501901994,"A critical feature of chromatin with regard to structure and function is the regular spacing of nucleosomes. In vivo, spacing of nucleosomes occurs in at least two steps, but the mechanism is not understood. In this report, we have mimicked the two-step process in vitro. A novel spacing activity has been partially purified from Xenopus laevis ovaries. When this activity is added, either at the beginning or at the end of a nucleosomal assembly reaction, it can convert a DNA template consisting of irregularly spaced nucleosomes into a chromatin structure made up of regularly spaced nucleosomes with a repeat length of about 165 base pairs. The reaction requires ATP. Histone H1 is able to increase the nucleosomal repeat from 165 to 190 base pairs. This two-step increase in nucleosomal repeat length suggests that both the spacing activity and histone H1 contribute to generating repeat lengths of greater than 165 base pairs and that their contributions may be additive. Alternatively, the critical step in the spacing reaction may not be the formation of the 165-base pair repeat but may be the sliding of nucleosomes or the reorganization of the octamer structure induced by the spacing activity."

The cDNA derived protein sequence contains a consensus site sufficient for the covalent attachment of myristate. To examine whether TCK was myristoylated, mouse fibroblast Swiss 3T3 and baby hamster kidney cell lines were transfected with a cDNA encoding the entire TCK protein linked to a metallothionein promotor. TCK expression was induced by zinc and paralleled by incorporation of [3H]myristic acid derived label into the protein. 3H Label incorporated into TCK was resistant to hydroxylamine treatment. The 3H-labeled material released from TCK by acid methanolysis eluted from a C18 reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography column at the positions of myristic acid and methylmyristate. Thus, TCK expressed in transfected mammalian cell lines contains authentic myristic acid, covalently attached through amide linkage. [3H]Myristoyl TCK comigrated on two-dimensional gels with the purified lipophilic isoform TCK II from sea urchins. Furthermore, like TCK II, [3H]myristoyl TCK associated with phospholipid liposomes, suggesting that myristoylation may mediate the observed membrane association of TCK. Myristoylation of sea urchin sperm flagellar creatine kinase may play a role in confining this enzyme to the flagellum during spermatogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1521293050,"Lipoprotein lipase (LPL), synthesized by adipocytes and myocytes, must be transported to the luminal endothelial cell surface where it then interacts with circulating lipoproteins. The first step in this extracellular LPL transport pathway is LPL release from the surface of LPL-synthesizing cells. Because hydrolysis of triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins releases LPL from the apical surface of endothelial cells, we hypothesized that the same substances dissociate LPL from adipocytes. 125I-LPL was bound to the surface of brown adipocytes (BFC-1 beta). LPL binding to the adipocyte surface was greater than to endothelial cell surfaces. Using low concentrations of heparin, more LPL was released from endothelial cells than BFC-1 beta, suggesting that the affinity of LPL binding to the adipocytes was greater than LPL affinity for endothelial cells. Greater than 3-fold more LPL was released from the cell surface when very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) were added to culture medium containing 3% bovine serum albumin. LPL remaining on the cell surface decreased with VLDL addition. Endogenously produced LPL activity was also released from the cells by VLDL. Low and high density lipoproteins did not release 125I-LPL or LPL activity from the adipocytes. To assess whether lipolysis was necessary for LPL release, BFC-1 beta were incubated with TG-rich lipoproteins from a patient with apoCII deficiency. The apoCII-deficient lipoproteins did not release LPL unless an exogenous source of apoCII was added. Apolipoproteins E and Cs and high molar ratios of oleic acid:bovine serum albumin did not release surface-associated LPL. Lysolecithin (25 and 100 microM), but not lecithin, monoglycerides, or diglycerides, released adipocyte surface LPL. Because lysolecithin also released LPL during a 4 degrees C incubation, cellular metabolic functions are not required for LPL dissociation from the cells. Lysolecithin also inhibited LPL binding to endothelial cells; however, this effect was abrogated by addition of bovine serum albumin. We hypothesize that lipolysis products from TG-rich lipoproteins release adipocyte surface LPL, which can then be transported to the luminal endothelial cell surface."

The ganglioside was isolated from rat spleen and characterized by compositional analysis, methylation analysis, sialidase hydrolysis, proton NMR spectroscopy, and negative ion fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. The structure was determined as follows. [formula: see text] This ganglioside is a unique derivative of N-acetyllactosaminyl-GM1. The three monosialogangliosides containing N-acetyllactosaminyl-GM1 structure, which had been originally isolated from rat spleen (Nohara, K., Suzuki, M., Inagaki, F., Ito, H., and Kaya, K. (1990) J.

On the other hand, GD1c(NeuGc,NeuGc) (IV3(NeuGc alpha 2-8NeuGc)-Gg4Cer), the overwhelmingly predominant ganglioside of rat thymocytes (Nohara, K., Suzuki, M., Inagaki, F., and Kaya, K. (1991) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 110, 274-278), was demonstrated to be only a minor component of the gangliosides of the spleen lymphocytes.

https://openalex.org/W1548798251,"Prolonged treatment of quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells with vasopressin induced heterologous desensitization of specific early signals stimulated by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). PDGF caused a striking dose-dependent release of [3H]arachidonic acid (EC50 = 2 ng/ml) and prostaglandin E2 (EC50 = 5 ng/ml). These responses are severely attenuated (greater than 85%) by prior exposure to vasopressin in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 = 1.5 nM). Maximal loss of responsiveness occurred after 40 h of vasopressin treatment with a half-maximal desensitization after 11-13 h. The desensitization is dependent upon binding to the V1 receptor, since it can be prevented by the antagonist [Pmp1,O-Me-Tyr2,Arg8]vasopressin. In contrast, stimulation of inositol phosphate accumulation and production of diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid by PDGF are unchanged. Thus, the observed heterologous desensitization cannot be attributed to an inability to activate phospholipase C. Furthermore, prior exposure to vasopressin did not affect the ability of PDGF to evoke tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular substrates, demonstrating that vasopressin-induced heterologous desensitization causes a block at a point distal to activation of receptor tyrosine kinase activity. Other downstream responses including transient induction of c-fos expression and stimulation of DNA synthesis were attenuated by vasopressin pretreatment. The findings demonstrate a novel mechanism of heterologous cellular desensitization namely, persistent occupancy of a guanine nucleotide-binding protein-coupled receptor, like the V1 type vasopressin receptor, attenuates responsiveness to a polypeptide growth factor like PDGF that initiates responses through a tyrosine kinase receptor."

Isolated adult rat cardiomyocytes, placed in agarose beads and superfused with phosphate-free buffer (Media 199 (GIBCO 400-1100) gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2), were used to evaluate a variety of cellular processes during different pharmacological and physiological interventions. Bioenergetic function was monitored with 31P NMR. Intermediary metabolism, gluconeogenesis, and glycolysis were monitored with 13C NMR. Sodium flux was monitored with 23Na NMR. Calcium flux was monitored with 19F NMR in conjunction with an intracellular calcium-chelating agent, 5F-1,2-bis(2-amino-phenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid. Creatine kinase kinetics (forward rate constant (Kf) and flux of phosphocreatine to ATP) were estimated with 31P NMR saturation transfer data. Various combinations of NMR parameters were monitored simultaneously so that the interaction of metabolism and ion flux could be evaluated. We have demonstrated that it is possible to simultaneously monitor a variety of cellular processes in intact heart cells in real time, without the confounding influences of perfusion, contractile function, and extrinsic blood-borne neurohumoral agents. This model will be useful for longitudinal studies of myocyte metabolism and ion flux."

Its ability to transfer stearoyl groups was both donor- and acceptor-dependent. For example, it used weakly acidic phospholipids, such as sn-1-stearoyl-2-acyl species of phosphatidylinositol (PI), as donors, but did not use phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate or sn-1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl phosphatidylcholine. Moreover, it used sn-2-acyl species of lysoPA and sn-2-arachidonoyl lysoPI as acceptors but did not use sn-2-arachidonoyl species of lysophosphatidylserine, lysophosphatidylethanolamine, or lysophosphatidylcholine. When taken together, our results raise the possibility that sn-1-stearoyl-2-acyl species of PI may be the primary acyl donors in the transacylase reaction in vivo, while sn-2-acyl species of lysoPA may be the primary acyl acceptors. Available evidence suggests that the PA that is formed may subsequently be converted into PI, but the metabolic fate of the other reaction product, sn-2-acyl lysoPI, remains to be determined."

Peptide mapping confirmed that W64CC65A contained a nonnative Cys64-Cys81 bond and three native disulfide bonds. The mutant had 2% of the lytic activity of the wild-type lysozyme. The midpoint concentration of the guanidine hydrochloride denaturation curve, the [D]1/2, was 2.7 M for W64CC65A at pH 3.0 and 25 degrees C, whereas the [D]1/2 for the wild-type h-lysozyme was 2.9 M. These results show that the W64CC65A protein is a compactly folded molecule. Our previous results, using the mutant C81A, indicate that Cys81 is not required for correct folding and activity, whereas Cys65 is indispensable (Taniyama, Y., Yamamoto, Y., Kuroki, R., and Kikuchi, M. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 65, 7570-7575). Cys64 substituted for Cys65 in W64CC65A, even though the distance between the alpha-carbons at positions 64 and 81 in the wild-type h-lysozyme is not favorable for forming a disulfide bond. Unlike C81A, the mutant W64CC65/81A, which has the additional substitution of Ala for Cys81, did not fold. These results suggest that the absence of both the Cys64-Cys81 bond and the amino acid residue Trp64 caused the misfolding or destabilization of W64CC65/81A in vivo. It is proposed that the formation of the alternative bond, Cys64-Cys81 is important for the folding of W64CC65A in vivo."
