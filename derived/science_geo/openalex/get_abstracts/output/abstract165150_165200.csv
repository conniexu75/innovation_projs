The prototype U box protein, yeast Ufd2, was identified as a ubiquitin chain assembly factor that cooperates with a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and a ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3) to catalyze ubiquitin chain formation on artificial substrates. E3 enzymes are thought to determine the substrate specificity of ubiquitination and have been classified into two families, the HECT and RING finger families. Six mammalian U box proteins have now been shown to mediate polyubiquitination in the presence of E1 and E2 and in the absence of E3. These U box proteins exhibited different specificities for E2 enzymes in this reaction. Deletion of the U box or mutation of conserved amino acids within it abolished ubiquitination activity. Some U box proteins catalyzed polyubiquitination by targeting lysine residues of ubiquitin other than lysine 48, which is utilized by HECT and RING finger E3 enzymes for polyubiquitination that serves as a signal for proteolysis by the 26 S proteasome. These data suggest that U box proteins constitute a third family of E3 enzymes and that E4 activity may reflect a specialized type of E3 activity.

Two predominant pathways for the degradation of cellular proteins have been identified: the vacuolar pathway (mediated by lysosomes, endosomes, and the endoplasmic reticulum, for example) and the cytoplasmic ubiquitin-mediated pathway. The ubiquitin proteolytic pathway plays an important role in the degradation of short lived regulatory proteins (1Peters J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), including those that participate in the cell cycle, cellular signaling in response to stress and to extracellular signals, morphogenesis, the secretory pathway, DNA repair, and organelle biogenesis (2Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar, 3Weissman A.M. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 189-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This pathway includes two distinct steps as follows: the covalent attachment of multiple ubiquitin molecules to the protein substrate, and the degradation of the ubiquitinated protein by the 26 S proteasome complex. The system responsible for ubiquitin attachment consists of several components that act in concert (4Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar, 5Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). A ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1),1 with ATP as a substrate, catalyzes the formation of a thioester bond between itself and ubiquitin and then transfers the activated ubiquitin to a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). Whereas some E2s transfer ubiquitin directly to a substrate, others require the participation of a third component, termed a ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3). E3 is thought to be the component of the ubiquitin conjugation system that is most directly responsible for substrate recognition (5Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 6Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8206-8214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the large number of protein substrates for the ubiquitin proteolytic pathway, relatively few E3s have been characterized at the molecular level. The amino acid sequences of E3s are known include members of the homologous to E6-AP COOH terminus (HECT) family (7Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5249Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and members of the RING finger-containing family (8Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

HECT family E3s include E6-AP, which targets p53 for ubiquitination in the presence of human papilloma virus E6 (11Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M.

Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). E3s that contain a RING finger, a motif defined by a total of eight cysteine and histidine residues that coordinate two zinc ions, include those that mediate protein degradation according to the N end rule (13Xie Y. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6832-6844Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar); Mdm2, which catalyzes both its own ubiquitination and that of p53 (14Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L.

Harper J.W. Science. 1999; 284: 662-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Furthermore, RING fingers of otherwise unrelated proteins, such as BRCA1, Siah-1, TRC-8, Praja1, and AO7, activate E2-dependent ubiquitination, suggesting that this domain plays a general role in the ubiquitin system (8Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11364-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). A new class of ubiquitination enzyme (termed E4), the prototype of which is yeast Ufd2, was recently identified (35Koegl M. Hoppe T. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Mayer T.U. Jentsch S. Cell. 1999; 96: 635-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Together with E1 (Uba1), E2 (Ubc4), and a HECT-type E3 (Ufd4), E4 (Ufd2) is required for the assembly of a polyubiquitin chain on artificial substrates that consist of proteins fused to ubiquitin at their NH2 termini and that are preferentially targeted for degradation. In yeast, Ufd2 is implicated in cell survival under stress conditions and is associated with Cdc48, which belongs to the large family of AAA-type ATPases that are thought to possess protein folding activity. Ufd2 and its homologs in other eukaryotes share a conserved domain designated the U box (35Koegl M. Hoppe T. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Mayer T.U. Jentsch S. Cell. 1999; 96: 635-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). The U box of Ufd2 mediates the interaction of this protein with ubiquitin-conjugated targets and therefore appears to be an essential functional unit of E4 enzymes. The predicted three-dimensional structure of the U box is similar to that of the RING finger, despite the lack in the former of the hallmark metal-chelating residues of the latter (36Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R132-R134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). This observation prompted us to investigate the possibility that U box proteins in general possess the ability to function as E3s in E2-dependent ubiquitination and that E4 activity might reflect a specialized type of E3 activity that targets the ubiquitinated ubiquitin moiety fused to other proteins for further ubiquitination. We now show that all six mammalian U box proteins tested mediate ubiquitination in conjunction with E1 and E2 and in the absence of other E3 components. Deletion of the U box domain or mutation of its most conserved amino acid resulted in the loss of E2-dependent ubiquitination activity, suggesting that this activity depends on an intact U box. The U box proteins appeared to catalyze their own ubiquitination as well as that of heterologous substrates. One of these proteins, UFD2a, attached ubiquitin to lysine residues of ubiquitin other than those at positions 29, 48, or 63, a property that is not usually exhibited by HECT or RING finger-containing E3s. These observations suggest that U box proteins are indeed E3s, some of which may function as E4s to mediate the assembly of polyubiquitin chains on proteins ubiquitinated by another E3 enzyme. The sequences of mouse UFD2a (accession number AI593754), UFD2b (accession numberAI390103), CHIP (accession number NM019719), and KIAA0860 (accession numbers AB020667 and AW476623) cDNAs as well as those of human CYC4 (accession number HSU37219) and PRP19 (accession number XM006045) cDNAs were obtained from the GenBankTM data base. The cDNAs for UFD2a, UFD2b, CHIP, and KIAA0860 were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with Taq polymerase (Takara, Tokyo, Japan) from mouse testis cDNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), whereas those for CYC4 and PRP19 were amplified from human thymus cDNA or human brain cDNA, respectively. The PCR primers were as follows: 5′-CAG TCA CTA CAG CAT TAC CTG GAG-3′ and 5′-AGC GAC GAC AAC TAG GCA GAA TAG-3′ for UFD2a; 5′-CCT TTT GGT CGC TGT AGC TGT GA-3′ and 5′-TTC CAA GTA CAC ACA ACG GCT GGG-3′ for UFD2b; 5′-GGC TGC GAG ATC TAG GTG-3′ and 5′-CTT CCG TCT CCA GAT CCT-3′ for CHIP; 5′-TGC TTG GAA GCT ATT GTT CCA GTT-3′ and 5′-TGG CCT GGC TTG GAA GCC CCT GTG-3′ for KIAA0860; 5′-GGC GCC ATG TCC CTA ATC TGC TCC-3′ and 5′-GGC CTA CAG GCT GTA GAA CTT GAG-3′ for CYC4; and 5′-GGC GCC ATG TCC CTA ATC TGC TCC-3′ and 5′-GGC CTA CAG GCT GTA GAA CTT GAG-3′ for PRP19. The amplified fragments were phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), subcloned into pBluescriptII SK+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and sequenced. In the case of UFD2a, UFD2b, and KIAA0860, the cDNA fragments were used as probes to isolate full-length clones from a mouse T cell cDNA library in λZAP (Stratagene). The positive clones obtained from of 1 × 106 plaques for each screening were isolated, and the inserts were subcloned into pBluescriptII SK+. The entire coding regions of the U box protein cDNAs were subcloned into pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), pBacPAC9 (CLONTECH), pFASTBAC HTa (Life Technologies, Inc.), or pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands). To generate U box deletion mutants of UFD2a or CHIP, we performed PCR with pBluescriptII SK+ containing UFD2a or CHIP cDNA as a template and with a sense primer beginning at the start codon and an antisense primer beginning proximal to the U box. To generate a U box deletion mutant (ΔU) of KIAA0860, we performed PCR with pBluescriptII SK+ containing KIAA0860 cDNA as a template and either with a sense primer beginning at the start codon and an antisense primer beginning proximal to the U box, or with a sense primer beginning distal to the U box and an antisense primer beginning at the stop codon. Both amplified products were mixed and subjected to a second PCR with a sense primer beginning at the start codon and an antisense primer beginning at the stop codon. To generate RING finger deletion mutants of KIAA0860, we performed PCR with wild-type or ΔU mutant KIAA0860 cDNA as a template and with a sense primer beginning at the start codon and an antisense primer beginning proximal to the RING finger domain. Complementary DNAs encoding mouse UFD2a, UFD2b, CHIP, and KIAA0860 as well as human CYC4 and PRP19 tagged at their NH2 termini with the FLAG epitope were generated by PCR, sequenced, and subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The plasmids pT7-7-Ubc2A, -Ubc2B, -Ubc3, -Ubc4, -UbcH5C, -UbcH6, -UbcH7, and -UbcH8 (Novagen, Madison, WI) were kindly provided by H. Yasuda (Tokyo Pharmaceutical University), and pCGN-HA-Ub was kindly provided by M. Nakao (Kumamoto University). A cDNA encoding hemagglutinin epitope (HA)-tagged ubiquitin was generated by PCR with pCGN-HA-Ub as template, with a sense primer that includes an EcoRI site, the HA tag sequence, and the beginning of the ubiquitin coding region and with an antisense primer that includes the ubiquitin stop codon and a XhoI site. The resulting PCR product was subcloned into pGEX-6P-1. To generate the various lysine residue mutants of ubiquitin, we performed site-directed mutagenesis with a Quick Change kit (Stratagene) and with mutated oligonucleotide primers corresponding to each lysine site. GlutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli strain DH5α cultured in the presence of 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Bacterial cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed by sonication, and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation for 20 min at 13,000 × g. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added to the resulting supernatant, and the mixture was rotated at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed in PBS, and GST fusion proteins were eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 10 mm reduced glutathione. To generate the ubiquitin mutants, we subjected the purified GST fusion proteins attached to the glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads to digestion for 4 h at 4 °C with PreScission protease (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Only the ubiquitin derivatives, not the GST moiety nor the GST-ubiquitin fusion proteins, were detected in the eluate by electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining (data not shown). His6-tagged proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) incubated in the presence of 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The recombinant proteins were purified with the use of ProBond resin (Invitrogen). Baculoviruses were generated in Sf9 cells with the use of BacPAK6 virus DNA and pBacPAK9-GST containing the relevant cDNA (23Kitagawa M. Hatakeyama S. Shirane M. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Hattori K. Nakamichi I. Kikuchi A. Nakayama K.-I. Nakayama K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2401-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). The recombinant proteins were purified from Sf9 cell lysates according to the protocol described for bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins. The plasmid pFASTBAC HTa containing the relevant cDNA was subjected to recombination with the baculoviral genome in HB10BAC, and the resulting recombinant viral genome was introduced into Sf9 cells by transfection in order to generate recombinant baculovirus. The infected Sf9 cells were lysed, and the recombinant proteins were purified by the protocol described for bacterially expressed His6-tagged proteins. Only the purified recombinant proteins were detected by electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining. Mouse and human multiple-tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) were subjected to hybridization with U box protein or β-actin (mouse or human) cDNA probes that had been labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. The blots were washed at 68 °C in 0.2× standard saline citrate containing 0.1% SDS and were then exposed and analyzed with a BAS-2000 instrument (Fuji Film, Kanagawa, Japan). Polyclonal antibodies to UFD2a were generated in rabbits by standard procedures with the use of a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 129–142 of mouse UFD2a (MEVDENDRREKRSL) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. HeLa cells grown on glass coverslips were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation and prepared for immunostaining as described (37Hatakeyama S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15085-15092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were fixed for 20 min at room temperature with 4% formaldehyde in PBS and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a mouse monoclonal antibody (M5) to the FLAG epitope (1 µg/ml) (Sigma) in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% saponin. They were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Alexa 546-labeled goat polyclonal antibodies to mouse immunoglobulin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at a dilution of 1:500 and stained with Hoechst 33258 (Wako, Osaka, Japan). Cells were covered with a drop of GEL/MOUNT (Biomeda, Foster City, CA) and then viewed and photographed with a Nikon Eclipse E800M microscope equipped with a color chilled 3CCD camera (model C5810; Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan). The in vitro ubiquitination assay was performed as described (8Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11364-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar) with some modifications. In brief, reaction mixtures (20 µl) containing 1 µg of GST-UFD2a, -UFD2b, -CHIP, or -KIAA0860, or of His6-CYC4 or -PRP19, 0.1 µg of recombinant rabbit E1 (Boston Biomedica, Cambridge, MA), 1 µl of crude lysate of E. coli expressing UbcH5C or 1 µg of purified UbcH5C, 0.5 units of phosphocreatine kinase, 1 µg of ubiquitin (Sigma), 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 120 mm NaCl, 2 mm ATP, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm creatine phosphate were incubated for 2 h at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer containing 4% β-mercaptoethanol and heating at 95 °C for 5 min (37Hatakeyama S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15085-15092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) on 9 or 12% gels and then subjected to immunoblot analysis with a mouse monoclonal antibody to ubiquitin (clone 1B3; MBL, Nagoya, Japan) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit polyclonal antibodies to mouse immunoglobulin (Promega, Madison, WI). Immune complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL kit; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In some experiments, the ubiquitination reaction was terminated by the addition of 400 µl of a solution containing 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, and 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate. After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C with 50 µl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and removal of the beads, the mixture was incubated first for 4 h at 4 °C with 5 µg of mouse monoclonal antibodies to GST (kindly provided by S. Tanaka, Hokkaido University) or antibodies to the FLAG epitope (M5) and then for 4 h at 4 °C with protein G-Sepharose beads. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times with an ice-cold solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 300 mmNaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, aprotinin (10 µg/ml), leupeptin (10 µg/ml), 10 mm iodoacetamide, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.4 mmNa3VO4, 0.4 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, and 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate and were then subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to ubiquitin, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies to mouse immunoglobulin, and ECL reagents. For chelation experiments, glutathione-bound proteins were incubated for 18 h at 4 °C with three changes of PBS containing 5 mm TPEN (Sigma). The TPEN-chelated GST fusion proteins were then washed with PBS and eluted from the glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 10 mmreduced glutathione (8Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11364-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). 35S-Labeled FLAG-Nedd4, -UFD2a, and -KIAA0860 were synthesized with the use of a TNT Quick-coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega) and [35S]methionine (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA). Translation was performed in a 100-µl reaction mixture containing 98 µl of reticulocyte extract and 2 µg of circular plasmid containing the relevant cDNA. To remove ubiquitin and potential fraction I-containing E2 enzymes, we applied the translation mixture containing the labeled protein to DEAE-cellulose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. After extensive washing of the resin with 100 mm NaCl, the labeled protein was eluted with 400 mm NaCl and subjected to in vitro assay of self-ubiquitination. A search of the GenBankTM data base for mammalian proteins that contain a U box domain identified six molecules as follows: mouse UFD2a, UFD2b, CHIP, and KIAA0860 and human CYC4 and PRP19 (Fig.1A). UFD2a and UFD2b appear to be mammalian homologs of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ufd2; they contain the U box domain at their COOH termini and, unlike the other four proteins identified, do not possess other known motifs. In addition to their U box domains, CHIP contains three tandem tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs), KIAA0860 contains a RING finger, CYC4 contains a cyclophilin-like motif, and PRP19 contains six WD40 repeats. Alignment of their amino acid sequences revealed a marked similarity among the U box domains of the yeast and mammalian proteins (Fig.1 B). The U box sequences of UFD2a, UFD2b, CHIP, and KIAA0860 are more closely related to each other than to those of CYC4 and PRP19. The proline residue corresponding to proline 924 of S. cerevisiae Ufd2 is perfectly conserved not only in the six mammalian U box proteins but also in all U box proteins from other organisms that are present in the data base (data not shown). The tissue specificity of expression of the genes for these mammalian U box proteins was examined by Northern blot analysis of polyadenylated RNA from a variety of mouse or human tissues (Fig.2A). The genes for UFD2a, UFD2b, and KIAA0860 are expressed in liver, heart, brain, kidney, and testis. CHIP mRNA was most abundant in skeletal muscle but was also present in smaller amounts in heart, liver, kidney, and pancreas.CYC4 gene transcripts were detected in heart, brain, placenta, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas, and PRP19 mRNA was present in all tissues examined. The subcellular localization of the mammalian U box proteins was examined by immunofluorescence analysis of HeLa cells transfected with vectors encoding FLAG epitope-tagged versions of these proteins. Cells were also transfected with plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged versions of Skp2 and IKK2 (IκB kinase 2) as controls for nuclear and cytoplasmic expression, respectively. Whereas KIAA0860 and CYC4 appeared to be localized to the nucleus of transfected HeLa cells, UFD2b and CHIP were localized to the cytoplasm (Fig. 2 B). UFD2a and PRP19 exhibited a nuclear localization in some cells and a cytoplasmic localization in others, suggesting that the localization of these proteins might be regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. To determine whether the mammalian U box proteins mediate ubiquitination, we subjected them to an in vitroassay with recombinant proteins produced in E. coli, which does not express components of the ubiquitin-conjugating system, thereby avoiding contamination with or copurification of eukaryotic proteins such as E3s (8Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11364-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). The U box proteins were expressed as GST or histidine (His6)-tagged fusion constructs and were isolated by affinity chromatography. Recombinant ubiquitin, recombinant E1, andE. coli lysate containing recombinant E2 (UbcH5C) were added to the assay. Potential substrates included the added fusion proteins and bacterial proteins. UFD2a and Nedd4 (an E3 of the HECT family) each mediated polyubiquitination in the presence of both E1 and E2 (Fig.3A). To examine the requirements for E1, E2, UFD2a, and ubiquitin in the ubiquitination reaction, we performed in vitro ubiquitination assays with the various combinations thereof in which one component (E1, E2, UFD2a, or ubiquitin) was missing from the reaction mixture (Fig.3 B). All components were required for polyubiquitination. Some of the ubiquitinated species detected were smaller than UFD2a (GST-FLAG-UFD2a, 162 kDa), suggesting that they were derived from bacterial proteins, although it remains possible that the recombinant protein might be degraded during the reaction. Given that immunoblot analysis with antibodies to the FLAG epitope revealed a shift in the mobility of the band corresponding to GST-FLAG-UFD2a, UFD2a was itself likely a target of polyubiquitination (Fig. 3 B; see also Figs. 6B and 7). To confirm that bacterial proteins were ubiquitinated in the reaction, we subjected the reaction mixture after completion of the incubation to immunodepletion with antibodies to GST (for GST-FLAG-UFD2a), and the resulting supernatant was then subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to ubiquitin (Fig.3 C). Although the GST-FLAG-UFD2a protein was almost completely removed by the immunodepletion procedure, the remaining supernatant still contained a substantial amount of ubiquitinated protein. We thus conclude that the ubiquitinated"

However, numerous receptor-tyrosine kinases are expressed in multicomponent complexes with other receptors that may signal independently or alter the binding characteristics of the receptor-tyrosine kinase. Nerve growth factor (NGF) interacts with two structurally unrelated receptors, the Trk A receptor-tyrosine kinase and p75, a tumor necrosis factor receptor family member. Each receptor binds independently to NGF with predominantly low affinity (K d = 10−9m), but they produce high affinity binding sites (K d = 10−11m) upon receptor co-expression. Here we provide evidence that the number of high affinity sites is regulated by the ratio of the two receptors and by specific domains of Trk A and p75. Co-expression of Trk A containing mutant transmembrane or cytoplasmic domains with p75 yielded reduced numbers of high affinity binding sites. Similarly, co-expression of mutant p75 containing altered transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains with Trk A also resulted in predominantly low affinity binding sites. Surprisingly, extracellular domain mutations of p75 that abolished NGF binding still generated high affinity binding with Trk A. These results indicate that the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of Trk A and p75 are responsible for high affinity site formation and suggest that p75 alters the conformation of Trk A to generate high affinity NGF binding.

Although homodimerization of receptor-tyrosine kinases is sufficient to initiate transmembrane signaling, an increasing number of receptor-tyrosine kinases have been found to be co-expressed with heterologous co-receptors lacking intrinsic kinase activity. Examples of such heteromeric receptors include the receptors for vascular endothelial growth factor, the flt-1 receptor-tyrosine kinase and neuropilin-1 (1Fuh G. Garcia K.C. de Vos A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26690-26695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the receptors for the glial-derived neurotrophic growth factor (GDNF), the ret receptor-tyrosine kinase and GRFα (2Eketjall S. Fainzilber M Murray-Rust J. Ibanez C.F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5901-5910Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar); and the receptors for nerve growth factor (NGF), the Trk A receptor-tyrosine kinase and the p75 neurotrophin receptor (3Hempstead B.L. Martin-Zanca D. Kaplan D.R. Parada L.F. Chao M.V. Nature. 1991; 350: 678-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). With the vascular endothelial growth factor and NGF ligands, co-expression of their receptor-tyrosine kinase and heterologous co-receptor generates receptor complexes that exhibit higher affinity binding constants than those exhibited by homodimeric receptor-tyrosine kinase complexes. For GDNF receptor activation, expression of both the ret receptor-tyrosine kinase and GRFα subunit is required for ligand binding because GDNF is unable to activate homodimeric ret receptor complexes (4Trupp M. Raynochek C. Belluardo N. Ibanez C.F. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1998; 11: 47-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Several models have been proposed to accommodate co-operative roles for these dual receptor systems. A model in which the nonreceptor-tyrosine kinase first binds the ligand, alters the local concentration, and then passes the ligand to the receptor-tyrosine kinase has been proposed. A second, conformational model predicts that co-expression of both receptor-tyrosine kinase and co-receptor alters the conformation of the receptor-tyrosine kinase through allosteric interactions, generating a higher affinity binding site by altering the association or dissociation constants of the ligand with its receptor-tyrosine kinase. We have utilized the NGF receptors as a model system to clarify a mechanism that generates high affinity site formation. NGF belongs to the neurotrophin family of survival and differentiation factors, which also includes BDNF, NT-3, and NT-4/5. NGF-responsive neurons exhibit two classes of binding sites based upon equilibrium binding reactions (5Sutter A. Riopelle R.J. Harris-Warrick R.M. Shooter E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 5972-5982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transmembrane proteins responsible for high affinity NGF binding (K d 10−11m) are the Trk A receptor and the p75 neurotrophin receptor (which binds all neurotrophins (6Rodriguez-Tebar A. Dechant G. Gotz R. Barde Y.A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar)). Kinetic analysis of NGF binding indicates that each receptor binds NGF with a relatively low affinity K dbetween 10−9 and 10−10m (7Mahadeo D. Kaplan L. Chao M.V. Hempstead B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6884-6891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although p75 displays very rapid rates of association and dissociation with NGF, the Trk A receptor has much slower on- and off-rates. When Trk A receptors are co-expressed with p75, the rate of association is accelerated 25-fold, generating a new kinetic site exhibiting high affinity binding properties (7Mahadeo D. Kaplan L. Chao M.V. Hempstead B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6884-6891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, one function of p75 is to increase the binding affinity of NGF. How this is accomplished has not been determined. Direct interactions between the p75 and Trk A receptors have been difficult to document biochemically, although ligand-induced receptor homodimers can be readily detected in affinity cross-linking reactions (8Jing S.Q. Tapley P. Barbacid M. Neuron. 1992; 9: 1067-1079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). However, immunoprecipitation experiments using 125I cross-linked to neural tissue or cell lines suggest that an association between the Trk A and p75 may take place (9Huber L.J. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 40: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 10Ross G.M. Shamovsky I.L. Lawrence G. Solc M. Dostaler S.M. Weaver D.F. Riopelle R.J. Eur. J.

Co-precipitation of endogenous Trk A and p75 in PC12 cells indicates that the receptor complex may form without NGF (12Yano H. Chao M.V. Pharm. Acta Helv. 2000; 74: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Photobleaching recovery experiments using fluorescently tagged p75 receptors or using monovalent antibody detection of Trk A have also revealed physical clustering of p75 with Trk A mediated by both intracellular and extracellular domains of p75 and Trk A and augmented by Trk A kinase activity (13Wolf D.E. McKinnon C.A. Daou M.-C. Stephens R.M. Kaplan D.R. Ross A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2133-2138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These studies have recently been extended to other Trk family members with the demonstration of a Trk B and p75 interaction by co-immunoprecipitation mediated by intracellular and extracellular domains (14Bibel M. Hoppe E. Barde Y-A. EMBO J. 1999; 186: 16-22Google Scholar). Furthermore, co-expression of p75 with Trk B was found to modulate the ligand specificity of Trk B (14Bibel M. Hoppe E. Barde Y-A. EMBO J. 1999; 186: 16-22Google Scholar). In addition to altering ligand binding, co-expression of p75 with Trk A can also influence Trk A signaling (15Hantzopoulos P.A. Suri C. Glass D.J.

A. 1991; 88: 857-866Google Scholar). The binding of NGF to Trk A receptors activates its cytoplasmic kinase, resulting in the phosphorylation of cytoplasmic tyrosine residues followed by the binding and activation of multiple proteins, including Shc, PLCγ, FRS-2, and SH2B (19Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar, 20Qian X. Riccio A. Zhang Y. Ginty D.D.

Chem. 1999; 274: 9861-9870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), which mediate effects such as survival and differentiation. The p75 receptor is a member of the tumor necrosis factor family of receptors and contains a putative cytoplasmic death domain (22Liepinsh E. Ilag L.L. Otting G. Ibanez C.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4999-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Although the p75 receptor can modulate Trk activity, and alter the specificity of Trk receptors for neurotrophin ligands (14Bibel M. Hoppe E. Barde Y-A. EMBO J. 1999; 186: 16-22Google Scholar,16Barker P.A. Shooter E.M. Neuron. 1994; 13: 203-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 23Maliartchouk S. Saragovi H.U. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6031-6037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the p75 receptor can also mediate cell death when expressed independent of Trk receptors (24Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Carter B.D. Dobrowsky R.T. Chao M.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 716-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 25Frade J.M. Rodriguez-Tebar A. Barde Y-A.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 911-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Neurotrophin binding to p75 can result in sphingomyelinase activation (27Dobrowsky R.T. Carter B.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 845: 32-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and recruitment of TRAF-6, a mediator of tumor necrosis factor receptor activation (28Khursigara G. Orlinick J.R. Chao M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2597-2600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), RhoA (29Yamashita T. Tucker K.L. Barde Y.A. Neuron. 1999; 24: 585-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), and NRIF (30Casademunt E. Carter B.D. Benzel J. Frade J.M. Dechant G. Barde Y.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6050-6061Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Thus, receptor-mediated signal transduction by the neurotrophins is unique among polypeptide growth factors because two different transmembrane signaling receptors can be activated by a neurotrophin ligand with distinctive biological outcomes. In addition, the ability of each receptor subunit to modulate the signaling cascades initiated by the co-receptor suggests that the receptors directly interact. One potential mechanism for the p75 receptor's ability to influence high affinity binding may be to increase the effective concentration of neurotrophin at the cell surface and thus enhance NGF binding to Trk A (16Barker P.A. Shooter E.M. Neuron. 1994; 13: 203-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism involving heparin sulfate facilitation of fibroblast growth factor binding to FGFR2 has been postulated (31Spivak-Kroizman T. Lemmon M.A. Dikic I. Ladbury J.E. Pinchasi D. Huang J. Jayne M. Crumley G. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Cell. 1994; 79: 1015-1024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar), but a more complex role in inducing conformational changes in the FGFR2 complex has become apparent with crystallographic analysis (32Pellegrini L. Burke D.F. von Delft F. Mulloy B. Blundell T.L. Nature. 2000; 407: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Another mechanism for p75 regulation of high affinity site formation is that the conformation of Trk A may be altered in the presence of p75, and this allosteric regulation facilitates Trk A-ligand binding and subsequent signaling functions (7Mahadeo D. Kaplan L. Chao M.V. Hempstead B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6884-6891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Ross G.M. Shamovsky I.L. Lawrence G. Solc M. Dostaler S.M. Weaver D.F. Riopelle R.J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 890-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To test these hypotheses, we undertook structure/function analysis of the p75 and Trk A receptors to identify the domains of each receptor required for high affinity ligand binding. The generation of the baculovirus constructs containing cDNAs for wild type and mutant p75 and Trk A have been described (33Stephens R.M. Loeb D.M. Copeland T.D. Pawson T. Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 1994; 12: 691-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), as has the generation of chimeric cDNAs encoding Trk A-torso constructs (34Ross A.H. Daou M.-C. McKinnon C.A. Condon P.J. Lachyankar M.B. Stephens R.M. Kaplan D.R. Wolf D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The cDNAs encoding the epidermal growth factor receptor-p75 chimeras (constructs EN10 and EN31) (35Yan H. Schlessinger J. Chao M.V. Science. 1991; 252: 561-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) were released by EcoRI digestion from the Bluescript vector and ligated into the Nco to EcoRI site of the baculovirus expression vector using polymerase chain reaction primers. The cDNA for the mutant p75 construct (p75–105) (36Yan H. Chao M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12099-12104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was excised from Bluescript usingEcoRI digestion and subcloned into the pCMV expression vector. The construction of pCMV5 plasmids encoding the native Trk A and p75 and a Trk A-Trk B chimeric receptor (3.2B) has been described (37Perez P. Coll P.M. Hempstead B.L. Martin-Zanca D. Chao M.V. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This 3.2B Trk A-Trk B chimera contains the Trk A sequence in the IgGC1 and C2 domains with the leucine-rich repeats, transmembrane, and intracellular domains of Trk B origin. A second Trk A-Trk B chimeric receptor containing the Trk A IgGC1 and C2 domains and the Trk A transmembrane domain with Trk B leucine-rich repeats and intracellular domain was constructed by domain swapping using the polymerase chain reaction primers and techniques described in detail (37Perez P. Coll P.M. Hempstead B.L. Martin-Zanca D. Chao M.V. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of each cloned fragment from Trk A and Trk B was determined using the dideoxy chain termination method. Sf9 insect cells were maintained in TMN-FH medium from JRH Biosciences supplemented with 9% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 50 µg/ml gentamycin at 28 °C. PC12 nnr5 cells expressing mutant Trk A receptors were cultured as described (33Stephens R.M. Loeb D.M. Copeland T.D. Pawson T. Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 1994; 12: 691-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney cell line 293 was maintained as described (35Yan H. Schlessinger J. Chao M.V. Science. 1991; 252: 561-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To express a single NGF receptor, recombinant baculovirus was added to Sf9 cells (2 − 106 cells in a 25 cm2 flask) at a multiplicity of infection of 1 for the p75 virus or 4 for the Trk A virus. For co-expression experiments, baculovirus encoding Trk A was added to SF9 cells at a m.o.i. of 16 followed immediately by the addition of virus encoding p75 at a m.o.i. of 1. To vary the ratio of infection, the m.o.i. of virus encoding Trk A was varied from 2 to 40, and the m.o.i. of virus encoding p75 was varied from 1 to 10. After 60 h of infection, cells were pelleted by centrifugation, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. 293 cells were cotransfected with the pCMV p75 or pCMV mutant p75 (p75–105) construct and the pMEX construct, which encodes a neomycin resistance gene, using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (37Perez P. Coll P.M. Hempstead B.L. Martin-Zanca D. Chao M.V. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Following selection in media containing 250 µg of G418, colonies were subcloned and expanded. The level of expression of native or mutant p75 was determined using whole cell lysates in Western blot analysis with the 9992 antisera specific for the intracellular domain of human p75 (36Yan H. Chao M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12099-12104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Clones expressing native or mutant p75 were subsequently transiently transfected with pCMV5 encoding Trk A using the calcium phosphate method and incubation of the cells with DNA for 4 h followed by replacement with fresh media. Twenty eight h after the addition of DNA, cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm EDTA. For membrane binding assays, cells were pelleted and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. For binding analysis using intact cells, cell suspensions were utilized immediately upon harvesting. Following lysis of cells in radioimmunoprecipitation assay, protein content was determined by the Bio-Rad assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard (38Hempstead B.L. Patil N. Thiel B. Chao M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9595-9598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Equivalent concentrations of protein were subjected to separation by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and probed with the 9992 antisera to intracellular epitopes of p75 (7Mahadeo D. Kaplan L. Chao M.V. Hempstead B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6884-6891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), anti-Trk antisera 203 detecting intracellular epitopes (3Hempstead B.L. Martin-Zanca D.

Stephens R.M. Kaplan D.R. Wolf D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) as described. Immunocomplexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence technique (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and subjected to densitometry. Mouse NGF (Bioproducts for Science, renin free) was radioiodinated using lactoperoxidase and hydrogen peroxide as described (38Hempstead B.L. Patil N. Thiel B. Chao M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9595-9598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity averaged 3000 dpm/fmol and was used within 2 weeks of radioiodination. Crude membrane preparations from snap frozen cells were prepared as described (7Mahadeo D. Kaplan L. Chao M.V. Hempstead B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6884-6891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The equilibrium binding assay conditions utilizing membrane preparations have been described in detail (7Mahadeo D. Kaplan L. Chao M.V. Hempstead B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6884-6891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Hempstead B.L. Patil N. Thiel B. Chao M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9595-9598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), utilizing 125I-NGF concentrations from 0.0005 to 4 nm, and each condition was assessed in triplicate in the presence or absence of excess unlabeled (0.8 µm) NGF. The specific counts averaged 60–85% of the total counts. In indicated experiments, equilibrium binding studies were performed using the whole cells binding assay (7Mahadeo D. Kaplan L. Chao M.V. Hempstead B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6884-6891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were resuspended at 0.75 − 106/ml final concentration, and binding to radioiodinated NGF (0.0005 to 4 nm) in the presence or absence of excess unlabeled NGF (0.8 µm) proceeded for 2 h at 0.4 °C. Cell-bound NGF was separated from free NGF by pelleting through calf serum. The Scatchard plot analysis was performed using the LIGAND program as described (7Mahadeo D. Kaplan L. Chao M.V. Hempstead B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6884-6891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and additionally analyzed using the PRISM program to perform nonlinear regression and directly compare curve fits to determine whether they were similar with 95% confidence limits. The level of expression of the p75 and Trk A receptors are highly regulated during neuronal development and in response to injury. To determine the optimal levels of expression of each receptor that confers the maximal percentage of high affinity binding sites, binding studies were performed using cells that expressed varying ratios of Trk A:p75. In prior studies using PC12 cells, we had noted that expression of Trk A:p75 at ratios of 1.0:0.8 yielded a higher percentage of high affinity sites as compared with PC12 cells with a 1:20 ratio of Trk A:p75 (42Hempstead B.L.

Transient expression of Trk A and p75 in Sf9 cells using baculovirus expression vectors allowed the two receptors to be expressed at defined ratios by altering the ratio of infectious virus and generated Sf9 cells that expressed high levels of receptors necessary for equilibrium binding studies. The level of expression of each receptor in infected Sf9 cells was determined by Western blot analysis (Fig.1a) in comparison with detergent extracts of Trk A overexpressing PC12 (Trk A-PC12) cells, which express 70,000 Trk A and 90,000 p75 receptors per cell as assessed by kinetic analysis of NGF binding sites in whole cell preparations (7Mahadeo D. Kaplan L. Chao M.V. Hempstead B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6884-6891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 b). Expression of the Trk A receptor at levels significantly in excess of p75 results in predominantly low affinity binding sites. At ratios of Trk A:p75 of ∼20:1, only low affinity binding sites were detected, and these sites exhibited a K d of 1.1 × 10−9m (Fig. 1 e and TablesIand II). Conversely, when p75 was expressed at levels significantly in excess of Trk A (ratio of Trk A:p75 of 1:15), only 3% of the sites exhibited high affinity binding (K d = 1.6 × 10−11m) (Fig. 1 b and Tables I andII). However, as the ratio of receptors became closer to equivalency (ratios of Trk:p75 of 1:5 or 1:0.8), the percentage of high affinity sites (K d = 2.4–2.8 × 10−11m) increased to 7 or 10% of the total binding sites, respectively (Fig. 1, C andD, and Tables I and II). Indeed, the percentage of high affinity sites and the K d of the high affinity site observed in Sf9 cells expressing Trk A:p75 at a 1:0.8 ratio is comparable with that observed using Trk A-overexpressing PC12 cells at a 0.8:1 ratio (7Mahadeo D.

Neuron. 1992; 9: 883-896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), demonstrating that binding results obtained with whole cells and membrane preparations are consistent and that receptor expression in different cell types yields binding sites with similar affinity (3Hempstead B.L. Martin-Zanca D. Kaplan D.R. Parada L.F. Chao M.V. Nature. 1991; 350: 678-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 7Mahadeo D. Kaplan L. Chao M.V. Hempstead B.L. J. Biol.

Thus, the ratio of expression of Trk A to p75 can significantly alter the number of high affinity sites with a higher percentage of the total receptors exhibiting high affinity binding when the receptors are expressed in near equimolar ratios.Table ISchematic representation of the structural domains of the p75 and Trk A receptor required for high affinity NGF bindingTable IIBinding constants and quantitation of binding sites obtained from equilibrium binding sitesExperimental conditionAnalysis of equilibrium bindingLow affinity siteCell typeHigh affinity siteKd (10−11m)BmaxKd (10−9m)BmaxATrkA:p751:15**(2)Sf91.6151-aBmax recorded in fmol/µg.1.24501-aBmax recorded in fmol/µg.1:5 (2)Sf92.4231-aBmax recorded in fmol/µg.1.13001-aBmax recorded in fmol/µg.1:0.8*(2)Sf92.8331-aBmax recorded in fmol/µg.1.33001-aBmax recorded in fmol/µg.20:1**(3)Sf9––1.19901-aBmax recorded in fmol/µg.BTrk + p75*(3)Sf91.71501-aBmax recorded in fmol/µg.0.910101-aBmax recorded in fmol/µg.305 + p75**(3)Sf91.81401-aBmax recorded in fmol/µg.0.834101-aBmax recorded in fmol/µg.303 + p75**(3)Sf97.01401-aBmax recorded in fmol/µg.1.919501-aBmax recorded in fmol/µg.325 + p75**(2)Sf94.0901.023401-aBmax recorded in fmol/µg.CTrk + p75*(2)2932.3220.81601-bBmax recorded in fmol/106 cells.3.3 + p75**(3)2932.6111-bBmax recorded in fmol/106 cells.1.0601-bBmax recorded in fmol/106 cells.3.2 + p75**(3)29318.2401-bBmax recorded in fmol/106 cells.0.91501-bBmax recorded in fmol/106 cells.K538 + p75**(4)NC––0.93001-aBmax recorded in fmol/µg.DTrk A + EGF-p75(10)*(3)Sf91.9241-aBmax recorded in fmol/µg.1.31401-aBmax recorded in fmol/µg.Trk A + EGFR-p75(31)**(3)Sf9––1.62001-aBmax recorded in fmol/µg.Trk A + p75(50)(2)2932.8161-bBmax recorded in fmol/106 cells.1.41801-bBmax recorded in fmol/106 cells.The PRISM program was used for linear regression analysis of the equilibrium binding data, and Scatchard transformation was performed to generate the K d and B max of each site.

To assess the role of each of these domains, the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the torso receptor kinase were exchanged with the Trk A receptor. Torso is a distantly related receptor-tyrosine kinase to Trk A, and a series of chimeric Trk A-torso receptors were generated (34Ross A.H. Daou M.-C. McKinnon C.A. Condon P.J. Lachyankar M.B.

We found that the two C2 domains of RIM display properties analogous to those of the C2B domain of synaptotagmin-I. Thus, RIM-C2A and RIM-C2B bind in a Ca2+-independent manner to α1B, the pore-forming subunit of N-type Ca2+ channels (EC50 = ∼20 nm). They also weakly interact with the α1C but not the α1D subunit of L-type Ca2+channels. In addition, the C2 domains of RIM associate with SNAP-25 and synaptotagmin-I. The binding affinities for these two proteins are 203 and 24 nm, respectively, for RIM-C2A and 224 and 16 nm for RIM-C2B. The interactions of the C2 domains of RIM with SNAP-25 and synaptotagmin-I are modulated by Ca2+. Thus, in the presence of Ca2+ (EC50 = ∼75 µm) the interaction with synaptotagmin-I is increased, whereas SNAP-25 binding is reduced. Synaptotagmin-I binding is abolished by mutations in two positively charged amino acids in the C2 domains of RIM and by the addition of inositol polyphosphates. We propose that the Rab3 effector RIM is a scaffold protein that participates through its multiple binding partners in the docking and fusion of secretory vesicles at the release sites.

SNAP receptor synaptotagmin glutathione S- transferase inositol-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Secretion of neurotransmitters, polypeptide hormones, and a variety of other proteins occurs by exocytosis, a multistage process including targeting, docking, and, finally, fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane. During the last few years, a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches has lead to the identification of several proteins involved in this complex cascade of events. Most of these proteins turned out to be specialized components of the evolutionary conserved machinery that governs intracellular vesicular trafficking in eukaryotic cells (1Gerst J.E. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 707-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Exocytosis was found to necessitate the assembly of a ternary complex between the vesicular SNARE1 VAMP, associated with the secretory vesicle, and the target SNAREs syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25, localized at the plasma membrane (2Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). The SNARE complex was initially proposed to ensure the docking of secretory vesicles at the plasma membrane (3Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar). However, it is unlikely that SNARE assembly constitutes the sole determinant for the targeting of secretory vesicles at the release sites because SNARE pairing is rather promiscuous (4Grote E. Novick P.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4149-4161Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 5Yang B. Gonzalez Jr., L. Prekeris R. Steegmaier M. Advani R.J. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5649-5653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), and the localization of syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25 is not restricted to active zones (6Galli T. Garcia E.P. Mundigl O. Chilcote T.J. De Camilli P. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1351-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A current hypothesis, supported by biochemical and structural data, proposes that the assembly of the heterotrimeric complex between VAMP, SNAP-25, and syntaxin-1 provides the driving force for membrane fusion (7Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1989) Google Scholar). In most secretory systems, the exocytotic process is initiated by an increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. In some cells, such as neurons, the elevation of Ca2+ ions is due to opening of voltage-gated calcium channels that are clustered at the release sites, whereas in others, Ca2+ ions are mobilized from intracellular stores. Biochemical and genetic studies indicate that synaptotagmins constitute the main Ca2+ sensors for regulated exocytosis (8Geppert M. Südhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1998; 21: 75-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Synaptotagmin (Syt)-I, the best characterized member of the synaptotagmin family, is localized on synaptic vesicles and is essential for the fast, Ca2+-dependent component of neurotransmitter release (9Geppert M. Goda Y. Hammer R.E. Li C. Rosahl T.W. Stevens C.F. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 717-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar, 10Davis A.F. Bai J. Fasshauer D. Wolowick M.J. Lewis J.L. Chapman E.R. Neuron. 1999; 24: 363-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Synaptotagmins possess a short N-terminal tail that resides inside secretory vesicles, a single membrane-spanning region, and a large cytoplasmic sequence containing two so-called C2 domains designated C2A and C2B. These two domains cooperate to mediate the binding of synaptotagmins with several proteins and phospholipids. Although most of these interactions are influenced by both C2 domains, Ca2+-dependent binding to syntaxin-1 and anionic phospholipids is predominantly associated with C2A (11Chapman E.R. Hanson P.I. An S. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23667-23671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 12Ohara-Imaizumi M. Fukuda M. Niinobe M. Misonou H. Ikeda K. Murakami T.

In contrast, Ca2+-dependent oligomerization of synaptotagmins and several Ca2+-independent interactions such as the binding to the II-III cytoplasmic loop or “synprint” (synapticprotein interaction) motif of the pore-forming subunit of Ca2+ channels (14Sheng Z.H. Yokoyama C.T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5405-5410Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) to inositol polyphosphates (15Niinobe M. Yamaguchi Y. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1036-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and to SNAP-25 (16Schiavo G. Stenbeck G. Rothman J.E. Sollner T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 997-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) are mediated predominantly by C2B. Ras-like GTPases of the Rab family represent additional components of the machinery involved in vesicular trafficking. Rab GTPases are associated with distinct cellular compartments and control different steps in the secretory pathway (17Martinez O. Goud B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The four isoforms of Rab3 (Rab3A, -B, -C, and -D) are associated with secretory vesicles of neuronal, endocrine, and exocrine cells and regulate exocytosis (18Fischer von Mollard G. Stahl B. Li C. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 164-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). It is still unclear whether Rab3 proteins participate in vesicle docking, membrane fusion, or both processes. Constitutively active mutants of Rab3 diminish regulated secretion (19Holz R.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5885-5891Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and in Rab3A-deficient mice, the number of synaptic vesicle fusions elicited by a nerve impulse is increased (23Geppert M. Goda Y. Stevens C.F. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 810-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), suggesting that Rab3 functions as a negative modulator of exocytosis. However, amylase secretion is enhanced in transgenic mice displaying mild overexpression of Rab3D in pancreatic acinar cells (24Ohnishi H. Samuelson L.C. Yule D.I. Ernst S.A. Williams J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 3044-3052Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and inhibition of Rab3B expression in anterior pituitary cells by antisense oligonucleotides results in a decrease in Ca2+-induced secretion (25Lledo P.M. Vernier P. Vincent J.D. Mason W.T. Zorec R. Nature. 1993; 364: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). These contradictory observations could be due to differences in the cell systems, or they may reflect the existence of positive and negative regulatory functions of Rab3 proteins differentially highlighted by the experimental approach used. Rabs have been suggested to contribute an additional layer of specificity to vesicular transport by controlling the assembly of the SNARE complex. Ypt1, a Rab protein implicated in the transport between endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi in yeast, has been proposed to favor SNARE assembly by associating with the target SNARE Sed5 (26Lupashin V.V. Waters M.G. Science. 1997; 276: 1255-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, the binding of other members of the Rab family to target SNAREs was found to be inefficient and nonspecific (4Grote E. Novick P.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4149-4161Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Rab6, Rab3, and Rab4 have also been shown to bind to theN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein, but the physiological meaning of this interaction remains to be established (27Han S.Y. Park D.Y. Park S.D. Hong S.H. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Recently, the Rab5 effector EEA1 has been reported to interact directly with the target SNAREs syntaxin-6 and syntaxin-13 (28Simonsen A. Gaullier J.M. D'arrigo A. Stenmark H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28857-28860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 29McBride H.M. Rybin V. Murphy C. Giner A. Teasdale R. Zerial M. Cell. 1999; 98: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), indicating that some Rabs may rely on their effectors for controlling the assembly of the SNARE complex. RIM is a putative effector of Rab3 that associates selectively with the active form of the GTPase (30Wang Y. Okamoto M. Schmitz F. Hofmann K. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). RIM contains an N-terminal domain that interacts with Rab3 and Munc13-1 (31Betz A. Thakur P. Junge H.J. Ashery U. Rhee J. Scheuss V. Rosenmund C. Rettig J. Brose N. Neuron. 2001; 30: 183-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) and two C2 domains located at the C terminus. In rat, the distance between the two C2 regions of RIM is determined by alternatively spliced sequences that generate a large set of different isoforms (30Wang Y. Okamoto M. Schmitz F. Hofmann K. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 32Wang Y. Sugita S. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20033-20044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). RIM is concentrated in presynaptic active zones, and overexpression of the Rab3-binding domain of RIM in PC12 and insulin-secreting cells enhances exocytosis elicited by secretagogues (30Wang Y. Okamoto M. Schmitz F. Hofmann K. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 33Iezzi M. Regazzi R. Wollheim C.B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). RIM was also found to bind to the cAMP sensor cAMP-GEFII and to mediate cAMP-induced secretion (34Ozaki N. Shibazaki T. Kashima Y. Miki T. Takahashi K. Ueno H. Sunaga Y. Yano H. Matsuura Y. Iwanaga T. Takai Y. Seino S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). In this study, we attempted to elucidate the role of this putative Rab3 effector by searching for possible binding partners of the protein. We found that the C2 domains of RIM mediate the interaction of this Rab3 target with the pore-forming subunit of Ca2+channels and with Syt-I and SNAP-25. This indicates that RIM constitutes a scaffold protein that binds to different components of the exocytotic machinery and suggests that it coordinates the docking and fusion of secretory vesicles at release sites. The plasmids encoding the cytoplasmic domain of syntaxin-1A and a fusion protein between GST and the cytoplasmic domain of rat Syt-I (residues 80–421) were kindly provided by Dr. R. Scheller (Stanford University, Stanford, CA). The human brain cDNA clone KIAA0340 (GenBankTM accession number AB002338) was obtained from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute. The antibodies against Syt-I and the α1B subunit of Ca2+ channels were purchased from Chemicon International. The antibody against SNAP-25 (SMI 81) was from Sternberg Monoclonals Incorporated. Inositol-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate (IP6) was from Calbiochem. The antibody directed against Syt-II has been described previously (35Osborne S.L. Herreros J. Bastiaens P.I. Schiavo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 59-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region including the two C2 domains of different RIM isoforms was cloned by RT-PCR from human brain mRNA (1 µg) (CLONTECH). The first-strand cDNA was synthesized with an oligo(dT) primer using the omniscript kit (Qiagen). The polymerase chain reaction was performed using forward primer 5′-TGGACGTCCTCGAAATCCCTATG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ATATGCGGCCGCTGATCGAATACAGGGAGGCCC-3′. The former primer was designed according to the sequence of human brain cDNA clone KIAA0340 from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute (GenBankTM accession number AB002338); the latter primer was designed according to the sequence of the human RIM gene (GenBankTM accession number AL035633). The polymerase chain reaction was performed using the following conditions: 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C 2 min. The polymerase chain reaction products were subcloned in the pGEM T-easy system (Promega) for sequencing. Sequence analysis was performed by MWG Biotech Company. The cDNA sequences encoding the cytoplasmic loop between domain II and III of the α1B, α1C, and α1D subunits of Ca2+channels were cloned by RT-PCR from mouse brain mRNA. Specific primers for α1B and α1C were designed from the reported cDNA sequences (36Coppola T. Waldmann R. Borsotto M. Heurteaux C. Romey G. Mattei M.G. Lazdunski M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 37Ma W.J. Holz R.W. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22728-22732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (GenBankTM accession numbers U04999 andL01776). The primers for α1D were derived from the sequence of the rat homologue (38Seino S. Chen L. Seino M. Blondel O. Takeda J. Johnson J.H. Bell G.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 584-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The α1B (amino acids 713–933), α1C (amino acids 754–899), and α1D (amino acids 773–907) fragments generated by RT-PCR were sequenced and then subcloned in myc-pcDNA3, a modified pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) designed to insert a myc epitope at the N terminus of the amino acid sequence (21Iezzi M. Escher G. Meda M. Charollais A. Baldini G. Darchen F. Wollheim C.B. Regazzi R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 202-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To generate the corresponding GST fusion proteins, the C2 domains of RIM were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned in bacterial expression vector pGEX-KG (39Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). RIM-C2A was amplified from the KIAA0340 clone (residues 744–839). RIM-C2B was amplified from one of the RIM clones obtained by RT-PCR (residues 615–760). The same procedure was used to generate an expression plasmid encoding the C2B domain (residues 262–386) of rat Syt-I. The C2domains of RIM and the cytosolic portion of Syt-I produced as GST fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads. The beads were resuspended in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.05% Tween 20, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. They were then incubated with 35S-labeled fragments of α1 subunits or with the cytoplasmic domain of syntaxin-1A produced by in vitro translation (Promega). The proteins that remained associated with the affinity columns after extensive washing were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and revealed by autoradiography or, for quantification experiments, by Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad). Rat brain detergent extracts were prepared as described previously (11Chapman E.R. Hanson P.I. An S. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23667-23671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) in HEPES-buffered saline (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100). 1-ml aliquots of the brain extract (about 1 mg of protein) were preincubated for 30 min at 4 °C in the presence of 2 mmEGTA or 500 µm CaCl2 and then incubated in the same buffer with immobilized GST fusion proteins for 2 h at 4 °C. The proteins remaining attached to the beads after several washes were detected by Western blotting using the indicated antibodies. To investigate the effect of different Ca2+concentrations on the binding of RIM C2 domains to Syt-I, the preincubations and incubations were performed in Ca2+/EGTA buffers (40Brooks S.P.J. Storey K.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The final concentration of EGTA in the buffers was 2 mm. The fraction of Syt-I bound to the GST affinity columns was estimated by analyzing the films with Scion Image software. The same quantification method was used for saturation experiments. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Quickchange kit (Stratagene) and verified by sequencing the insert of the plasmids. To shed light on the role of the Rab3-interacting molecule RIM, we searched for additional binding partners interacting with the C terminus of the protein. For this purpose, the 3′ region of RIM encompassing the two C2 domains was amplified by RT-PCR from human brain mRNA. Experiments performed on first-strand cDNA generated several heterogeneous DNA fragments with a size between 1600 and 2300 base pairs. The sequences of six DNA fragments have been submitted to GenBankTM(GenBankTM accession numbers AF263305-AF263310). The sequences encoded by the DNA fragments display a high degree of homology with the corresponding region of rat RIM. Alignment of the sequences indicates that the RT-PCR fragments result from a combination of different splice variants of human RIM mRNA that diverge in two domains corresponding to the splicing site B and C described in rat RIM (30Wang Y. Okamoto M. Schmitz F. Hofmann K. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 32Wang Y. Sugita S. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20033-20044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Site B appears to be an hypervariable region because each of the six clones displays a different sequence. These observations demonstrate that human brain contains several RIM isoforms that differ from each other in the distance between the two C2domains. Direct comparison of the C2 domains of RIM with the C2 domains of Syt-I (Fig. 1) reveals that the overall homology between the sequences is rather low (RIM-C2A has 20% and 19% homology with Syt-I C2A and C2B; RIM-C2B has 16% and 22% homology with Syt-I C2A and C2B). However, both C2 domains of RIM contain a cluster of four amino acids homologous to the KKKT sequence of Syt-I C2B. The KKKT sequence is conserved in RIM-C2B, whereas in RIM-C2A, two lysines are replaced with two arginines (KRRT) (Fig. 1). The KKKT sequence is known to be required for the interaction with the synprint motif of Ca2+ channels (14Sheng Z.H. Yokoyama C.T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5405-5410Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 41Chapman E.R. Desai R.C. Davis A.F. Tornehl C.K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 5844-5849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). More recently, this particular sequence has been postulated to be the oligomerization interface for Syt-I (43Desai R.C. Vyas B. Earles C.A. Littleton J.T. Kowalchyck J.A. Martin T.F.J. Chapman E.R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1125-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The presence of the KKKT sequence prompted us to investigate whether the C2 domains of RIM interact with known partners of Syt-I. We first tested the ability of the C2 domains of RIM to bind to the α1 subunits of N- and L-type Ca2+ channels. To address this issue, GST fusion proteins containing the cytoplasmic domain of Syt-I, RIM-C2A, or RIM-C2B were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads. They were then incubated with recombinantin vitro-translated proteins representing the cytoplasmic loop connecting domain II and III of α1B (N-type), α1C (L-type), and α1D (L-type) subunits. As shown in Fig.2A, the in vitro-translated fragment of the neuron-specific α1B subunit associated equally well with the GST affinity columns of Syt-I, RIM-C2B, and RIM-C2A. The binding was not affected by the concentration of Ca2+ in the incubation buffer (data not shown). A weak interaction of the three recombinant proteins with the L-type α1C subunit could also be observed, but a much longer exposure of the film was required (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, no specific binding was detectable with the cytoplasmic loop of α1D. To determine more precisely the affinity of the pore-forming subunit of N-type Ca2+ channels for Syt-I and for the C2 domains of RIM, we performed dose-response experiments using a fixed amount of GST fusion proteins and variable amounts ofin vitro-translated α1B (Fig. 2 B). Using this approach, we estimated that half-maximal binding of α1B synprint to Syt-I is obtained at about 25 nm. This value is in good agreement with the K D of 25 nm measured previously using a solid phase assay (14Sheng Z.H. Yokoyama C.T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5405-5410Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The affinity of α1B for RIM-C2A and RIM-C2B (14 and 18 nm, respectively) was almost identical to that of α1B for Syt-I C2B. These results suggest that in neurons, the interaction between the C2 domain of RIM and the N-type calcium channel could contribute to ensure a tight structural and functional association of the exocytotic machinery with the sites of calcium entry. Syt-I has been reported to bind to syntaxin-1. This interaction is modulated by Ca2+ and is mediated mainly by the C2A domain of Syt-I (11Chapman E.R. Hanson P.I. An S. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23667-23671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 44Shao X. Li C. Fernandez I. Zhang X. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 133-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). As expected, we observed a strong binding of in vitro-translated syntaxin-1 with the cytoplasmic domain of Syt-I in the presence of calcium and a weaker binding in the absence of calcium (Fig.3). In contrast, under the same conditions, syntaxin-1 was unable to interact efficiently with the C2 domains of RIM or with GST alone. We next tested the ability of the C2 domains of RIM to associate with Syt-I and SNAP-25. In this case, GST fusion proteins containing Syt-I C2B, RIM-C2A, or RIM-C2B were incubated with brain extracts in the presence of either EGTA or 500 µm Ca2+. In the absence of Ca2+, binding of rat brain Syt-I to the GST affinity columns was barely detectable (Fig. 4). However, in the presence of Ca2+, the binding to RIM-C2A and RIM-C2B and the oligomerization with Syt-I were dramatically increased. Similar results were obtained with an antibody directed against Syt-II, indicating that the C2 domains can interact in a Ca2+-dependent manner with different Syt isoforms (data not shown). Ca2+-dependent binding was also observed in the presence of the purified cytoplasmic domain of Syt-I (data not shown), showing that RIM-C2A and RIM-C2B associate directly with synaptotagmins. To confirm the specificity of these interactions, we estimated the binding affinities at 500 µm Ca2+ using different amounts of brain extracts. Using a recombinant protein as a standard, in our rat brain extracts Syt-I was found to represent ∼0.1% of the protein content. By applying this estimate, half-maximal binding of rat brain Syt-I to the GST affinity columns containing Syt-I C2B, RIM-C2A, and RIM-C2B was calculated to be ∼12, 24, and 16 nm, respectively (Fig.5A). We also estimated the Ca2+ dependence of the binding of Syt-I to the C2 domains of RIM (Fig. 6). The half-maximal effect for hetero-oligomerization with the C2 domains of RIM and homo-oligomerization with Syt-I was very similar and was observed in the presence of 70–100 µm Ca2+ (Fig. 6). This value is consistent with the Ca2+ dependence for exocytosis (45Heidelberger R. Heinemann C. Neher E. Matthews G. Nature. 1994; 371: 513-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Thus, Ca2+ triggers not only the self-association of synaptotagmins but also promotes the hetero-oligomerization of distinct C2 domains with properties analogous to those of Syt-I C2B.Figure 5Measurement of the affinity of Syt-I C2B, RIM-C2A, and RIM-C2B for native Syt-I and SNAP-25.

Analysis of epithelial lining fluid samples from individuals with emphysema indicated the presence of cleaved SLPI in these samples whereas only intact SLPI was observed in control epithelial lining fluid samples. Active cathepsin L was shown to be present in emphysema epithelial lining fluid and inhibition of this protease prevented the cleavage of recombinant SLPI added to emphysema epithelial lining fluid.

SLPI was initially identified as a potent inhibitor of neutrophil elastase (NE) and is thought to provide significant protection for the lung epithelial surfaces against NE released from activated or disintegrating neutrophils (7Gauthier F. Frysmark U. Ohlsson K. Bieth J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 700: 178-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In recent years SLPI has been recognized to have anti-bacterial, anti-viral, and anti-inflammatory properties. These include the prevention of human immunodeficiency virus replication in monocytic cells (8McNeely T. Dealy M. Dripps D.J. Orenstein J.M. Eisenberg S.P. Wahl S.M. J. Clin.

Cathepsins B, L, and S are cysteine proteases produced by macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells in the lung and have been demonstrated to possess elastolytic activity (11Chapman H.A. Riese R.J. Shi G-P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 63-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Cathepsins B, L, and S all work at acidic pH and their proteolytic activity is neutralized at neutral pH with the exception of cathepsin S (12Kirschke H. Wiederanders B. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 500-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Cathepsin L activity has been shown to be elevated in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from emphysema (13Takeyabu K.

A large percentage of the elastolytic activity of cultured macrophages has been attributed to cathepsins (18Chapman Jr., H.A. Stone O.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 1693-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and it is believed that protease-antiprotease imbalance such as occurs in emphysema may result in destruction of local tissue (19Senior R.M. Shapiro S.D. Fishman A.P. Elias J.A. Fishman J.A. Grippi M.A. Kaiser L.R. Senior R.M. Fishman's Pulmonary Diseases and Disorders. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1998: 659-681Google Scholar). A variety of other proteases are produced by activated macrophages and neutrophils in the emphysematous lung including the matrix metalloproteases, MMP-1, -8, -9, and -12 as well as a number of serine proteases (20Shapiro S.D.

However, SLPI is believed to be proteolytically stable due to the large number of disulfide bridges present in its structure (22Grutter M.G. Fendrich G. Huber R. Bode W. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). To date, only NE has been demonstrated to cleave oxidized SLPI, at a 2:1 molar ratio, and has no action on the native molecule (5Vogelmeier C. Hubbard R.C. Fells G.A. Schnebli H-P. Thompson R.C.

TCEP was obtained from Pierce (Rockford, IL). Microcon-3 columns were from Millipore (Watford, England). Western blotting reagents were obtained from Tropix (Bedford, MA). SLPI was assayed by measuring its inhibition of human neutrophil elastase activity onN-methoxy-succinyl-Pro-Ala-Ala-Val-p-nitroanilide as previously described (23McElvaney N.G. Nakamura H. Birrer P.

SLPI inactivation was determined by measuring NE inhibitory activity following incubation with cathepsin B, L, or S over a 60-min time period. SLPI (8 nmol) was incubated alone or with cathepsin B (0.5 nmol), cathepsin L (20 pmol), or cathepsin S (20 pmol) in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol in a 100-μl volume at 37 °C. Samples (5 μl) were removed from each incubation over a 60-min time period and mixed with 15 μl of 0.2 mTris, pH 8.5, containing 1 μm E-64. The samples and controls were then assayed for anti-NE activity. SLPI (4 nmol) was incubated with neutrophil elastase (0.5 nmol), proteinase 3 (0.5 nmol), and cathepsin G (0.5 nmol) in 0.1 m HEPES, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.5, for 24 h at 37 °C. SLPI (4 nmol) was also incubated with MMP-1 (0.5 nmol), MMP-8 (0.5 nmol), and MMP-9 (0.5 nmol) in 50 mmTris, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 1 mm ZnCl2, pH 7.5, for 24 h at 37 °C. Finally, SLPI (4 nmol) was incubated with cathepsin B, L, and S in 0.1m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol in a 50-μl volume at 37 °C for 1 h. 5-μl samples were removed after each incubation and serine protease activity was neutralized with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, MMP activity with 1 mm EDTA and cathepsin activity with 0.2 m Tris, pH 8.5, containing 1 μm E-64. The samples were boiled for 5 min in an equal volume of SDS sample treatment buffer, containing 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, prior to electrophoresis in a 17.5% polyacrylamide gel. Gels were then stained in Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and destained as previously described (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). SLPI (4 nmol) was incubated with cathepsin B, L, and S for 48, 8, and 1 h, respectively, in 0.1m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 1 mm EDTA (without dithiothreitol) in a 50 μl volume at 37 °C. Cathepsin activity was neutralized with 0.2 mTris, pH 8.5, containing 1 μm E-64 and the samples were lyophilized and reconstituted in 6 m guanidine HCl at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. Tris[2-carboxyethyl]phosphine (final concentration 1 mm, added to assure unambiguous identification of each peptide) was added to each sample and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. 20 μl (20 μg) of SLPI was loaded onto the HPLC, separated, and analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry as previously described (24Taggart C.

Mass spectra were deconvoluted with the software provided by the instrument manufacturer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, Chemstation version 8). Expected masses were calculated from the SLPI sequence by the GPMAW program (Lighthouse Data, Odense, Denmark). Sixteen individuals with emphysema (all smokers) and 15 healthy volunteers (all non-smokers) were studied. Emphysema patients attended the outpatient clinic at Beaumont Hospital, Dublin. All subjects had normal AAT levels and phenotypes as determined by nephelometry and isoelectric focussing. Diagnosis of emphysema was based on previous guidelines (25Snider G.L. Kleinerman J. Thurlbeck W.M. Bengali Z.K. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1985; 132: 182-185PubMed Google Scholar) including medical history, chest roentgenography, pulmonary function, and CT scan. Symptoms of a respiratory tract infection were absent for the 6 weeks preceding lavage. Arterial blood gas analysis performed on all subjects while they breathed room air showed no clinically significant hypoxemia or hypercapnea. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects and the study was approved by the Beaumont Hospital Ethics Committee. BAL was performed with 120 ml of sterile saline as described by Klech and Pohl (26Klech H. Pohl W. Eur. Respir. J. 1989; 2: 561-585PubMed Google Scholar). Recovered fluid was filtered through sterile gauze to remove debris and mucus and was then centrifuged at 300 × g and the supernatants were stored at −70 °C until analyzed. Cell number was determined by a hemocytometer and cell differentiation was carried out by May-Grunwald Giemsa staining of cytospin preparations. This was carried out by measuring urea nitrogen in serum and BAL as previously described (23McElvaney N.G. Nakamura H. Birrer P. Hebert C.A. Wong W.L. Alphonso M. Baker J.B. Catalano M.A. Crystal R.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1296-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). This gave an accurate determination for the actual amount of epithelial surface liquid present in each BAL sample. SLPI levels were determined by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, as previously described (23McElvaney N.G. Nakamura H. Birrer P. Hebert C.A. Wong W.L. Alphonso M. Baker J.B. Catalano M.A. Crystal R.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1296-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). SLPI activity was determined as previously described (23McElvaney N.G. Nakamura H. Birrer P. Hebert C.A. Wong W.L. Alphonso M. Baker J.B. Catalano M.A. Crystal R.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1296-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Briefly, increasing amounts of BAL are titrated against a fixed concentration of NE (2 nm) and porcine pancreatic elastase (2 nm). AAT, SLPI, and elafin, the other significant antiprotease present in the lung (23McElvaney N.G. Nakamura H. Birrer P. Hebert C.A. Wong W.L. Alphonso M. Baker J.B. Catalano M.A. Crystal R.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1296-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), can all inhibit NE. However, AAT and elafin both inhibit porcine pancreatic elastase whereas SLPI does not (23McElvaney N.G. Nakamura H. Birrer P. Hebert C.A. Wong W.L. Alphonso M. Baker J.B. Catalano M.A. Crystal R.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1296-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Therefore, the difference in the amount of BAL required to inhibit NE compared with amount needed to inhibit porcine pancreatic elastase is taken to be equivalent to the SLPI activity present in BAL. Values were corrected for ELF and expressed as micromolar/ml ELF. BAL samples were concentrated 20-fold using Microcon-3 columns. Equal amounts of ELF were electrophoresed on 15% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose. After blocking in I-Block (Tropix), SLPI was detected using affinity purified rabbit anti-SLPI IgG (1:1000 in I-block) for 1 h followed by incubation with alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:7500) for 1 h. Development was carried out using the Tropix Western Kit. Cathepsin B and L activities in BAL were measured using Z-Arg-Arg-p-nitroanilide (0.1 mm) for the estimation of cathepsin B activity and Z-Phe-Arg-p-nitroanilide (0.1 mm), in the presence of the cathepsin B inhibitor CA-074 (10 μg/ml), for the estimation of cathepsin L activity. The incubation buffer was 0.2m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The buffer was made 10% acetonitrile for the cathepsin L activity measurement. Values were corrected for ELF and expressed as micromolar p-nitroaniline released per min/ml ELF. Emphysema BAL samples were preincubated with inhibitors of cathepsin B (CA-074, 50 μm) and cathepsin L (Z-Phe-Phe-CHN2, 50 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C followed by incubation with recombinant SLPI (2 μg) for 24 h at 37 °C. Samples were analyzed for SLPI cleavage by Western blot. Similarly, emphysema BAL samples were incubated with monoclonal anti-cathepsin L IgG (10 μg/ml) or with isotype control IgG (10 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C. The samples were then incubated with recombinant SLPI (2 μg) for 4 h at 37 °C and analyzed for SLPI cleavage by Western analysis. The effect on the anti-NE activity of each sample was also measured. SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrated that incubation of SLPI with serine proteases (Fig.1 a) or MMPs (Fig.1 b) did not lead to cleavage of SLPI. However, cathepsin incubation with SLPI revealed a very similar cleavage pattern for all three cathepsins resulting in the generation of two SLPI cleavage fragments with approximate molecular masses of 7.5 kDa (SLPI*) and 4.5 kDa (SLPI#) (Fig. 1 c). This is not entirely surprising considering that cathepsin B, L, and S have a very similar substrate profile and probably cleave at very similar sites. SLPI did not lose anti-NE activity over the duration of the experiment when incubated in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (Fig.2) indicating that acidic pH does not affect anti-NE activity. Incubation of SLPI:cathepsin B at a molar ratio of 15:1 resulted in a decrease in anti-NE activity to 14% of control (Fig. 2). However, inactivation of SLPI anti-NE activity by cathepsin L and S (to 10 and 4% of control, respectively, Fig. 2) was achieved at molar ratios of SLPI:cathepsin of 400:1 indicating that SLPI is a much better substrate for cathepsins L and S than cathepsin B. HPLC separation of the products obtained following incubation of cathepsins B, L, and S with SLPI resulted in the initial formation of three species (Fig.3, peaks 1, 2, and 5). The mass spectrum of peak 1 obtained from the HPLC is shown in Fig.4 a. The deconvoluted mass of this mass was 7,353.4 Da, identifying it as SLPI residues 1–67 (calculated mass = 7,353.7 Da). Likewise, the mass spectrum for peak 5 is shown in Fig. 4 b, and the deconvoluted mass for this peak was 4,389.8 Da, identifying it as SLPI residues 68–107 (calculated mass = 4,390.4 Da). Mass spectrometric analysis of peak 2 established that this peak was SLPI residues 75–107 (observed mass = 3,580.9 Da; calculated mass = 3,581.3 Da). The other peaks in the chromatogram were the small amount of residual wild-type SLPI (Peak 4, observed mass = 11,725.5 Da, calculated = 11, 725.5 Da) and the monomethionine sulfoxide SLPI (peak 3, observed mass = 11, 741.5 Da, calculated = 11,741.5 Da). These results indicated that in the case of all three cathepsins the initial site of cleavage in the SLPI molecule occurred after the threonine 67 residue. Cleavage at the Thr67-Tyr68 bond was followed by trimming of the 68–107 peptide to generate the 75–107 peptide. The SLPI active site for NE inhibition occurs at Met72-Leu73(23McElvaney N.G. Nakamura H. Birrer P. Hebert C.A. Wong W.L. Alphonso M. Baker J.B. Catalano M.A. Crystal R.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1296-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and destruction of this site by cathepsin B, L, and S action clearly resulted in the loss of anti-NE activity observed in Fig. 2. The presence of oxidized SLPI in SLPI in the commercial preparation has been previously identified by HPLC mass spectrometry analysis of native SLPI (data not shown) and did not occur as a result of SLPI incubation with cathepsins B, L, or S. Interestingly, the oxidized SLPI species appeared to be relatively resistant to cleavage by any of the cathepsins since it was present at approximately the same concentration before and after incubation with cathepsins B, L, and S.Figure 3HPLC analysis of SLPI incubated with cathepsins B, L, and S.

The samples were neutralized with 0.2 m Tris, pH 8.0, and 1 μm E-64, dried and reconstituted in 6 mguanidine HCl with TCEP (1 mm). The samples were then separated by HPLC.

All emphysema patients had impaired pulmonary function with FEV1 values of <70%, decreased FEV1/FVC and DLco values compared with the controls (p < 0.001). ELF recovery for emphysema and controls was very similar (0.87 ± 0.3 ml versus 0.89 ± 0.18 ml). Emphysema BAL samples contained a greater number of cells compared with controls (3.5 × 107 ± 0.8 × 107 versus 2 × 107 ± 0.4 × 107) and an increased percentage of macrophages (97 versus 89%, p < 0.001).

ELF values, and cell types and number present for the emphysema and control patient population examined in this study. SLPI levels were found to be significantly lower in emphysema ELF compared with control ELF (0.37 ± 0.12 μm/ELFversus 0.67 ± 0.21 μm/ELF,p < 0.05, Fig.5 a. Likewise, SLPI activity was found to be lower in emphysema ELF compared with control ELF (0.18 ± 0.07 μm/ELF versus0.42 ± 0.1 μm/ELF, p < 0.05, Fig.5 b). Thus, SLPI status in emphysema and control BAL samples was investigated by Western blotting. BAL samples were concentrated using Microcon-3 columns in order to detect SLPI by Western blot. Attempted analysis of SLPI in BAL samples by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Blue R-250 gave a confused picture due to the presence of other small molecular weight species in BAL with a molecular weight similar to SLPI. SLPI was detected as a band at ∼12 kDa in all normal BAL samples and a representative blot is shown in Fig. 5 b, insert 1 (lane 2). However, analysis of SLPI in emphysema BAL demonstrated that it was present as a cleaved product with some native intact SLPI remaining (Fig. 5 b,insert 1, lane 3). The size of the SLPI cleavage product was equivalent to that obtained when SLPI was incubated with purified cathepsin and analyzed separately by Western blot (Fig. 5 b, insert 1, lane 4). Only the native SLPI and the larger 7.5-kDa SLPI fragment can be detected by Western blot. The smaller 4.5-kDa SLPI fragment cannot be detected by Western blot presumably due to degradation of the epitope specific for the anti-SLPI IgG by cathepsin activity. In light of these results we investigated the different protease activities present in emphysema ELF that might be cleaving and inactivating SLPI. The presence of active cathepsin L in ELF samples from individuals with emphysema has previously been demonstrated therefore, we measured the activities of cathepsins B and L in our emphysema and control BAL samples. Cathepsin B activity was present in 4 COPD BAL samples but was not significantly elevated above controls (data not shown). Cathepsin L activity was demonstrated in 15 emphysema BAL and 2 control BAL samples, with cathepsin L activity being significantly increased in emphysema ELF compared with control ELF (Fig.6, p < 0.001). Therefore, this result suggested that cathepsin L was the possible candidate protease responsible for the cleavage and inactivation of SLPI in emphysema ELF. Incubation of emphysema BAL with recombinant SLPI resulted in SLPI cleavage (Fig.7 a, lane 2) with a pattern similar to that seen with endogenous SLPI present in emphysema BAL (Fig. 5 b, insert 1, lane 3) and recombinant SLPI incubated with purified cathepsin (Fig.5 b, insert 1, lane 4). Incubation of emphysema BAL with inhibitors of cathepsin B and L followed by incubation with SLPI in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 1 mm EDTA, resulted in the cleavage of SLPI in the presence of cathepsin B inhibitor (Fig.7 a, lane 4). However, no cleavage of SLPI was observed in the presence of cathepsin L inhibitor (Fig. 7 a,lane 5). Incubation under the same conditions using dimethyl sulfoxide (the solvent that both inhibitors was dissolved in) also resulted in SLPI cleavage (Fig. 7 a, lane 3) indicating that dimethyl sulfoxide did not inhibit the cathepsin L activity in emphysema BAL. This confirmed that inhibition of cathepsin L in emphysema BAL prevented cleavage of SLPI. The findings in this experiment were confirmed using several emphysema BAL samples incubated with recombinant SLPI (data not shown). Emphysema BAL was also incubated with IgG to cathepsin L or isotype control IgG followed by incubation with SLPI as above. These experiments demonstrated that isotype IgG did not prevent SLPI cleavage from occurring (Fig. 7 b, lane 3) but anti-cathepsin L IgG prevented significant SLPI cleavage (Fig.7 b, lane 4). The findings in this experiment were also confirmed using several emphysema BAL samples incubated with recombinant SLPI (data not shown). SLPI is cleaved by the elastolytic cysteine proteases cathepsins B, L, and S resulting in the inactivation of SLPI anti-NE activity. Previous studies have shown that SLPI is susceptible to inactivation by bacterial proteases (27Sponer M. Nick H.P. Schnebli H.P. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1991; 372: 963-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 28Draper D. Donohoe W. Mortimer L. Heine R.P. J. Infect. Dis. 1998; 178: 815-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, in this study we have demonstrated that SLPI can be cleaved and inactivated by members of the cathepsin family. Investigation of emphysema ELF revealed that SLPI levels and activity were decreased compared with ELF from controls. Analysis of SLPI by Western blot revealed that SLPI was intact in control ELF but SLPI cleavage products were present in emphysema ELF with a banding pattern similar to that obtained by Western blotting when recombinant SLPI was incubated with purified cathepsin. Cathepsin L activity was shown to be increased significantly in emphysema ELF and the use of a synthetic inhibitor for cathepsin L and a neutralizing antibody for human cathepsin L were both capable of inhibiting the cleavage of recombinant SLPI added to emphysema BAL. This result shows that cathepsin L-mediated SLPI cleavage occursin vivo in emphysema and probably decreases the antiprotease screen present in the emphysema lung. SLPI is composed of two highly homologous domains, an N-terminal domain composed of residues 1–54 and a C-terminal domain consisting of residues 55–107 (29Seemuller U. Arnold M. Fritz H. Wiedenmann K. Machleidt W. Heinzel R. Applehans H. Gassen H.G. Lottspeich F. FEBS Lett. 1986; 199: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Four disulfide bridges are present in each domain, a feature that was thought to make the SLPI molecule inaccessible to proteolytic action. Leucine at position 72 has been demonstrated to be the active residue for NE inhibition and the methionine at position 73 is has been shown to be susceptible to oxidation which renders SLPI inactive toward NE (30Rudolphus A. Heinzel-Weiland R. Vincent V.A.M.M. Saunders D. Steffens G.J. Dijkman J.H. Kramps J.D. Clin. Sci. 1991; 81: 777-784Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). It is also thought that the region between residues 67–74 of the SLPI molecule act as a docking region for a number of proteases (3Jin F-Y. Nathan C. Radzioch D. Ding A. Cell. 1997; 88: 417-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Therefore, our observation that cathepsins B, L, and S proteolytically cleave SLPI at Thr67-Tyr68 and subsequently remove residues 68–74 indicates that the region surrounding this bond is susceptible to cleavage leading to inactivation of SLPI's anti-NE activity. The other major serine protease inhibitor of the respiratory tract, α1-antitrypsin, also possesses proteolytically susceptible sites and oxidation sensitive residues in its active site between residues 350 and 358. This region can be cleaved by a variety of proteases including MMP-1, MMP-7, MMP-8, MMP-9, and Pseudomonas elastase resulting in a loss in the anti-NE activity of α1-antitrypsin (31Desrochers P.E. Jeffrey J.J. Weiss S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 2258-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 32Zhang Z. Winyard P.G. Chidwick K. Murphy G. Wardell M. Carrell R.W. Blake D.R. Biochim.

In addition, cathepsin L can also inactivate α1-antitrypsin by cleavage at bonds Glu354-Ala355 and Met358-Ser359 (16Johnson D.A. Barrett A.J. Mason R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14748-14751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly to SLPI, α1-antitrypsin also possesses oxidation-sensitive methionine residues in its active site (24Taggart C. Cervantes-Laurean D. Kim G. McElvaney N.G. Wehr N. Moss J. Levine R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27258-27265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, together with the data presented in this paper, cathepsin L is the only protease identified to date that is capable of inactivating both SLPI and α1-antitrypsin, the major antiproteases of the upper and lower respiratory tracts. However, it seems likely that the cathepsins play an important role in inflammatory lung diseases. As well as the ability to inactivate antiproteases, the cathepsins L and S are capable of degrading lung connective tissue such as elastin (36Mason R.W. Johnson D.A. Barrett A.J. Chapman H.A. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 925-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 37Shi G-P. Munger J.S. Meara J.P. Rich D.H. Chapman Jr., H.A. J. Biol.

In this study we have shown that active cathepsin L is present at significantly elevated levels in emphysema ELF compared with control ELF fluid. It has also been demonstrated previously that smokers have increased levels of cathepsin L compared with healthy controls (13Takeyabu K. Betsuyaku T. Nishimura M. Yoshioka A. Tanino M. Miyamoto K. Kawakami Y. Eur. Respir. J. 1998; 12: 1033-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 14Takehashi H. Ishidoh K. Muno D. Ohwada A. Nukiwa T. Kominami E. Kira S. Am. Rev. Respir.

Wilcox D. Mason R.W. Chapman Jr., H.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: L41-L48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The evidence we have presented in this study shows that cathepsin activity present in the respiratory tract of smokers may result in SLPI inactivation. This would have consequences for the anti-NE activity of the lung in disease states in which cathepsins are present in active concentrations. The destruction of the anti-NE activity of both SLPI and α1-antitrypsin by cathepsin activity may result in a dramatically decreased antiprotease screen in the disease states resulting in subsequent lung damage."

RNA polymerase II carboxyl-terminal repeat domain hemagglutinin fast protein liquid chromatography matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization reflectron time-of-flight nitrilotriacetic acid histone acetyltransferase The form of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)1 responsible for transcript elongation is fundamentally different from the form that enters a promoter to form a preinitiation complex (1Dahmus M.E.

Sci. 1996; 21: 346-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). During initiation, RNAPII is hypo-phosphorylated and associated with the functionally conserved Mediator complex, a multisubunit factor required for regulation of transcription (3Malik S. Roeder R.G.

The association of RNAPII with Mediator and the general transcription factors is severed during promoter clearance, triggered by TFIIH-mediated hyperphosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal repeat domain (CTD) of the largest RNAPII subunit (5Usheva A.

Nature. 2000; 408: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). During elongation, hyperphosphorylated yeast RNAPII is associated with the Elongator complex. Elongator binds directly to RNAPII, at least partly via the CTD, and the interaction is stabilized by CTD hyperphosphorylation (8Otero G. Fellows J. Li Y. de Bizemont T. Dirac A.M.G. Gustafsson C.M.

The genes encoding the Elongator subunits have been identified and shown to play a role in transcription elongation in vivo: ELP1 encodes a protein without discernable motifs (8Otero G. Fellows J.

The identification of a highly conserved HAT associated with elongating RNAPII suggests a mechanism for modification and remodeling of chromatin during transcript elongation. Recombinant Elp3 indeed has HAT activity in a gel-based HAT assay, and mutations in the sequence encoding the predicted acetyl-CoA binding pocket of the protein significantly reduce this activity (11Wittschieben B.O. Fellows J. Du W. Stillman D.J. Svejstrup J.Q. EMBO Journal. 2000; 19: 3060-3068Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Importantly, when the same point mutations are introduced in yeast, they confer phenotypes that are virtually identical to those resulting from deletion of either of the ELP genes, indicating that the catalytic activity of the Elp3 protein is essential for Elongator function. The in vivo function of Elp3 is overlapping with that of the prototype HAT, Gcn5, the catalytic subunit of SAGA/ADA (12Grant P.A. Duggan L. Cote J. Roberts S.M. Brownell J.E. Candau R. Ohba R.

In the absence of both Elongator and SAGA HAT activity, cells are sick and unable to grow under a large variety of conditions. These phenotypes can be suppressed by concomitantly deleting the genes encoding two histone deacetylases (HDACs), indicating functional redundancy between HDACs as well and supporting the notion that maintenance of a certain overall acetylation level in a cell may be important for cell viability and growth (11Wittschieben B.O.

Elongator function, such as HAT activity, is required for normal activation of a number of genes, indicating that Elongator is involved in creating a chromatin structure that is amenable to efficient transcription (8Otero G.

To further our understanding of Elongator function, we isolated the complex from extracts of yeast cells in which the gene encoding Elp1 had been modified to express a double affinity-tagged version of the protein. This tag made it possible to rapidly purify Elongator to virtual homogeneity under mild conditions. Here we show that the purified factor is a six-subunit complex, comprised of two discrete, three subunit subcomplexes that easily dissociate. We have identified the three novel proteins of the complex, as well as a human homologue of one of the encoding genes, and provide evidence that holo-Elongator is the functional entity of Elongator in vivo. A sequence encoding a (His)10-HA epitope tag followed by a transcription termination signal was created by polymerase chain reaction using primers 5′-AGCTGACTAGTCATCACCATCACCATCACCATCACCATCACTATCCATGTTCCTGACTATGCCTAATTCCGGGCGAATTTCTTATG-3′ and 5′-GTTCTGAGCTCTTACGCCAAGCTTGCATGCCGGT-3′ and plasmid pAS2–1 (CLONTECH) as a template. The resulting sequence was inserted between the SpeI and SacI sites of pRS304 (13Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to yield vector pSE.HISHA-304. Part of the ELP1open-reading frame was amplified using primers 5′-GCTACACTCGAGACAAGATAATGAGCCTTTACGCCG-3′ and 5′-TGTGACACTAGTAAAATCAACAATATGACTCTTAGGG-3′ and cloned into pSE.HISHA-304 using the XhoI and SpeI sites yielding plasmid pELP1-HISHA-304. After transformation of the protease-deficient Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain BJ2168 (Table I), a TRP+clone was isolated in which the 3′-end of the ELP1 gene was replaced, resulting in expression of an Elp1-(His)10-HA fusion protein (Elp1-HisHA; strain JSY549). To ensure that the (His)10-HA epitope tag did not interfere with Elp1 function, the same integration was performed in the W303 strain background, making it possible to do phenotypic analysis and comparison with wild type and elp1Δ cells.Table IList of yeast strains usedNameDescriptionReference/SourceW303–1AMATa, leu2–2, 112, his3–11, 15, trp1–1, ade 2–1 can1–100Thomas and Rothstein (25Thomas B.J.

Protein was stepwise eluted with buffer A (40 mm Hepes-KOH pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% (v/v) glycerol) containing 150 mm, 300 mm, 600 mm, and 1200 mm KOAc. The vast majority of Elongator eluted in the fraction containing 600 mm KOAc. Typically, 50 ml of this fraction was incubated with 0.8 ml of protein A-Sepharose CL4B-12CA5 monoclonal antibody resin (1–3 mg of antibody/ml of resin) overnight at 4 °C. The resin was collected by gravity flow in a column holder and washed extensively with buffer A containing 600 mm KOAc and equilibrated in A containing 300 mm KOAc. Bound proteins were then eluted in three washes with 1 ml of buffer A containing 300 mm KOAc and 2 mg/ml HA peptide (KKKRILKMYPYDVPDYARIL) for 15 min at 30 °C. These fractions were pooled and diluted with an equal volume of buffer (40 mm Hepes-KOH pH 7.6, 300 mm KOAc, 20% (v/v) glycerol) and allowed to bind to 0.4 ml Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) at 4 °C overnight with mixing. The resin was collected in a column holder and washed with 2 ml of buffer A containing 300 mm KOAc. After washing with 2 ml of the same buffer containing 300 mm KOAc and 10 mm imidazole, bound protein was eluted in 1 ml of the same buffer containing 300 mm imidazole. Fractions were dialyzed against buffer A containing 100 mm KOAc and stored in small aliquots at −80 °C. Gel filtration was carried out on a SMART chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A portion of the eluate from the anti-HA immunoaffinity column was applied via a 25-µl sample loop onto a Superose 6 PC1.6/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) collecting 50-µl fractions. Aliquots (1 and 5 µl, respectively) were analyzed by immunoblotting and staining with silver nitrate. Different Elongator (sub)complexes were obtained by anion-exchange chromatography using anÄKTA-FPLC (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Anti-HA eluate fractions 1–3 were pooled (∼2 ml), diluted with buffer B (25 mmTris-HAc, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 20% glycerol) to a final concentration of 150 mm KOAc and loaded onto a Mono Q HR5/5 FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was washed with 2 volumes of buffer B containing 150 mm KOAc and developed with a 10-column volume linear gradient from 150 to 1500 mm KOAc collecting 0.35-ml fractions. Elongator subcomplexes eluted between 1000 and 1450 mm KOAc. Aliquots were analyzed by immunoblotting (1 µl) and staining with silver nitrate (5 µl). Gel-fractionated proteins were digested with trypsin, and the mixtures were fractionated on a Poros 50 R2 RP microtip (14Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Lacomis L. Grewal A. Annan R.S. Carr S.A. Tempst P. J. Chromatogr. A. 1998; 826: 167-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Resulting peptide pools were then analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization reflectron time-of-flight (MALDI-reTOF) MS using a Reflex III instrument (Brüker Franzen; Bremen, Germany) and by electrospray ionization (ESI) MS/MS on an API 300 triple quadrupole instrument (PE-SCIEX; Thornhill, Canada), modified with an ultrafine ionization source (15Geromanos S. Freckleton G. Tempst P. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 777-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Selected mass values from the MALDI-TOF experiments were taken to search a S. cerevisiae subset of the protein non-redundant data base (NR; NCBI, Bethesda, MD) using the PeptideSearch (16Mann M. Hojrup P. Roepstorff P. Biol. Mass. Spectrom. 1993; 22: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar) algorithm. MS/MS spectra were inspected for y“ ion series to compare with the computer-generated fragment ion series of the predicted tryptic peptides. To produce antibodies recognizing Elp4, Elp5/Iki1, and Elp6, peptides encompassing an amino-terminal cysteine residue followed by the final carboxyl-terminal 19 amino acids of the corresponding predicted open-reading frames were synthesized. Each of these peptides was coupled via its amino-terminal cysteine residue to Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (Calbiochem) bym-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Pierce) cross-linking and used to immunize rabbits (Murex). For immunoblotting, the anti-Elp4, -Elp5, and -Elp6 antibodies and their respective prebleeds were used at a final dilution of 1:1000. All S. cerevisiae stains used for genetic analysis (Table I) were congenic with strain W303 and grown and manipulated as described previously (8Otero G. Fellows J. Li Y. de Bizemont T. Dirac A.M.G.

To analyze killer toxin sensitivity, yeast strains were transformed with plasmid pNW064 encoding the killer toxin γ-subunit under control of the inducible Gal1-10 promoter (17Tokunaga M. Kawamura A. Hishinuma F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3435-3446Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Dilutions of the indicated yeast strains were spotted onto SD (−ura −trp) medium containing 2% glucose or galactose as indicated. A full-length human Elp4 cDNA clone was obtained from the NEDO sequencing project (clone KAT08960, GenBankTM accession number AK000505). The entire open-reading frame of human Elp4 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers p123 5′-GAAGATCTCCATGGCGGCAGTGGCAACCTG-3′ and p124 5′-GAAGATCTCTAGAAGTCCAGGTGCTTCTTGCC-3′ and radiolabeled with random hexamers. This probe was hybridized to a human multiple tissue Northern blot according to the manufacturer's guidelines (CLONTECH). As a control, the blot was probed with a human β-actin cDNA (CLONTECH). Previously, we purified the Elongator complex from the DNA-free, soluble fraction of a whole cell extract through five to six conventional chromatography steps (8Otero G. Fellows J. Li Y. de Bizemont T. Dirac A.M.G. Gustafsson C.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). To facilitate the purification of Elongator and the subsequent analysis of its composition and enzymatic activities, we constructed a haploid S. cerevisiaestrain expressing a tagged version of the gene encoding the largest subunit of Elongator, ELP1. The endogenous chromosomal copy was replaced with a gene encoding full-length Elp1 fused to a carboxyl-terminal decahistidine stretch and a HA epitope tag (Fig.1A). After verification that the tag did not interfere with Elp1 function in vivo (data not shown), we purified Elongator using an efficient three step procedure including two high affinity chromatography steps (Fig.1 B). First, soluble whole cell extract was loaded onto Bio-Rex 70 cation-exchange resin. Bound proteins were eluted with buffer containing 300 mm, 600 mm, and 1200 mm potassium acetate (KOAc), respectively. Essentially all Elongator was collected in the 600 mm KOAc eluate and subsequently applied onto anti-HA immunoaffinity resin. Analysis by immunoblotting showed that virtually all Elp1-HisHA from the Bio-Rex 70 fraction bound to this column and could be eluted by competition with excess peptide containing the HA epitope (Fig. 1 C). Interestingly, protein silver staining showed that, in addition to Elp1, Elp2, and Elp3, three additional proteins with apparent molecular weights of 50, 35, and 30 kDa eluted from the immunoaffinity column (Fig. 1 D). These three proteins did not bind to the immunoaffinity resin in the absence of tagged Elp1 (data not shown), indicating that they interact specifically with Elp1. Moreover, when the eluates from the anti-HA immunoaffinity resin were subjected to Ni2+-agarose affinity chromatography, the three additional proteins also co-eluted with the previously defined Elongator subunits, providing further evidence that the interaction is specific (Fig.1 D). We designated these putative novel Elongator subunits Elp4, Elp5, and Elp6, respectively. Peptide mass fingerprinting using MALDI-reTOF mass spectrometry (14Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Lacomis L.

Biochem. 1996; 241: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) was used to identify the 50-, 35-, and 30-kDa protein bands. We identified the 50-kDa band as the product of the previously defined open-reading frame YPL101W on chromosome XVI (predicted molecular weight M r 51.2) and named this gene ELP4. The p35/Elp5 protein was identified as the product of open-reading frame YHR187W (chromosome VIII, predicted molecular weight M r 35.2). Interestingly, this gene was previously identified as the insensitive tokiller toxin 1 gene, IKI1, which was identified in the same genetic screen as ELP1/IKI3 and whose inactivation renders yeast cells insensitive to pGKL killer toxin (19Yajima H. Tokunaga M. Nakayama-Murayama A. Hishinuma F. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1997; 61: 704-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Finally, the 30-kDa protein band was found to correspond to the open-reading frame YMR312W on chromosome XIII (predicted molecular weight M r 30.6), which we termedELP6. The predicted molecular weights of the identified open-reading frames correspond well with the apparent molecular masses in all three cases. Analysis of the three amino acid sequences by data base searching did not reveal any obvious domain structure or homology to proteins with known function. To verify the identity of the 50-, 35-, and 30-kDa protein bands, polyclonal rabbit antibodies directed against the carboxyl-terminal 19 amino acids of Elp4, Elp5, and Elp6 were generated and tested for reactivity toward purified Elongator by immunoblotting. These antibodies, but not the corresponding preimmune sera, specifically recognized p50/Elp4, p35/Elp5, and p30/Elp6, respectively, in the Elongator preparation, confirming the identification of these proteins as components of the complex (Fig.2A). To establish that Elp4, Elp5, and Elp6 are bona fidesubunits of Elongator, the purified complex was analyzed by gel filtration chromatography. All six Elongator proteins exactly co-eluted from this resin as judged by protein silver staining and immunoblot analysis using antibodies directed against Elp1, Elp3, Elp4, Elp5, and Elp6 (Fig. 2 B). This experiment shows that Elp4, Elp5, and Elp6 are indeed subunits of Elongator and indicates that Elongator is a stoichiometric complex composed of six subunits. Previously, we identified Elongator as a three-subunit complex (8Otero G. Fellows J. Li Y. de Bizemont T. Dirac A.M.G. Gustafsson C.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Careful analysis of protein fractions obtained from these earlier purifications showed that proteins with apparent molecular weights corresponding to Elp4, Elp5, and Elp6 eluted from Mono Q slightly later than Elp1, Elp2, and Elp3 (data not shown). We reasoned that Elongator complex might be disrupted by anion-exchange chromatography on Mono Q, or by high salt concentration. Indeed, when affinity-purified six subunit Elongator was loaded onto Mono Q and eluted with increasing salt, three different forms of the complex could be identified (Fig.3). First, six subunit holo-Elongator eluted at <1100 mm KOAc. Second, the previously identified form of Elongator composed of Elp1, Elp2, and Elp3 (core Elongator) was detected, and, finally, fractions highly enriched in Elp4, Elp5, and Elp6 were obtained. We also observed that Elongator was disrupted in the presence of 2 m NaCl (data not shown). We conclude that Mono Q chromatography and/or high salt concentration can disrupt the Elongator complex, explaining our failure to previously identify the three smallest subunits. These findings indicate that Elongator is composed of two subcomplexes: one comprising the three largest subunits, and the second composed of the three newly identified proteins, Elp4, Elp5, and Elp6. To analyze the role of ELP4,ELP5, and ELP6 in vivo, we disrupted one copy of the respective entire open-reading frames in diploid yeast cells, which were subsequently induced to sporulate. After dissection of the resulting tetrads, we noted the appearance of small colonies, which occurred in a 2:2 ratio and co-segregated with the marker used (data not shown). This is reminiscent of the phenotype we previously observed in elp1Δ, elp2Δ, and elp3Δ cells (8Otero G. Fellows J. Li Y. de Bizemont T. Dirac A.M.G. Gustafsson C.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P.

The identification of two genes encoding Elongator components,ELP1/IKI3 and ELP5/IKI1, as genes whose inactivation cause insensitivity to pGKL killer toxin (19Yajima H. Tokunaga M. Nakayama-Murayama A. Hishinuma F. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1997; 61: 704-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), prompted us to investigate whether disruption of the remaining fourELP genes also render cells insensitive to the killer toxin derived from the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis. Therefore, we conditionally expressed the γ killer toxin subunit intracellularly using a galactose-inducible promoter (17Tokunaga M. Kawamura A. Hishinuma F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3435-3446Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, all elpΔ mutant strains grew normally on medium containing glucose where the killer toxin was not expressed. However, upon expression of killer toxin on galactose-containing medium, wild type cells were unable to grow, whereas all elpΔ mutants were insensitive to killer toxin. The mechanism of killer toxin depends on the histone acetyltransferase activity of Elongator, as inactivation of the complex in an elp3 strain carrying a point mutation in a residue important for the catalytic activity of Elp3 also resulted in insensitivity to killer toxin. Other phenotypes we observed for elp4Δ, elp5Δ, and elp6Δ cells were an inability to grow at 39 °C (Fig. 4 B) and salt sensitivity (Fig.4 C), which were previously observed for elp1Δ,elp2Δ, and elp3Δ mutants (8Otero G. Fellows J. Li Y. de Bizemont T. Dirac A.M.G. Gustafsson C.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol.

Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 123-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). In addition, elp1Δ elp4Δ double mutants cells displayed phenotypes virtually identical to those of the single mutants, such as growth rate, and sensitivity to elevated temperature and high salt (Fig. 5and data not shown), as previously observed for all combinations ofelp1Δ, elp2Δ, and elp3Δ mutations (9Fellows J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12896-12899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate thatELP1 through ELP6 are all non-essential genes whose products also form a functional entity in vivo. Further data base searching using the predicted amino acid sequence of ELP4 as a query identified significant homology with several open-reading frames from a variety of higher eukaryotes, including human and mouse (Fig.6A). No clear domain structure could be identified on the basis of these homologies. Interestingly, however, the putative human and mouse Elp4 proteins are encoded by the human and mouse PAXNEB gene, respectively, which is localized on human chromosome 11p13 (mouse chromosome 2), a region implicated with human disease (20Miles C. Elgar G. Coles E. Kleinjan D.J. van Heyningen V. Hastie N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13068-13072Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). PAXNEB is expressed in a variety of human tissues as determined by Northern blot analysis (Fig.6 B) and indicated by the presence of multiple expressed sequence tags (ESTs) derived from different tissues in the data base. The ubiquitous expression pattern suggests a general role for Elp4 in higher eukaryotic cells. In addition, the identification of human and other higher eukaryotic homologues of Elp4 further supports the notion that Elongator is structurally conserved from yeast to man. In the present study we isolated Elongator complex by utilizing a rapid purification procedure based largely on affinity chromatography. Our findings can be summarized as follows: Elongator consists of six subunits; the three identified previously, and a novel discrete subcomplex composed of three proteins, termed Elp4, Elp5, and Elp6. We have named the novel factor holo-Elongator, to distinguish it from the core-factor (Elp1, Elp2, and Elp3) that we isolated previously. holo-Elongator is a labile complex that can be dissociated into its two three-subunit subcomplexes by treatment with high salt or by anionic chromatography. We have identified the genes encoding the three new subunits and shown by genetic analysis that strains lacking any one of these genes have phenotypes that are indistinguishable from those of the previously characterized elp strains. Finally, we have cloned the human homologue of yeast ELP4 and shown that it is ubiquitously transcribed. In vivo, two of the proteins in the Elp4/Elp5/Elp6 module, Elp5 and Elp6 have been shown to interact in a large scale two-hybrid screen (21Uetz P. Giot L. Cagney G. Mansfield T.A. Judson R.S. Knight J.R. Lockshon D. Narayan V. Srinivasan M. Pochart P. Qureshi-Emili A. Li Y. Godwin B. Conover D. Kalbfleisch T. Vijayadamodar G. Yang M. Johnston M. Fields S. Rothberg J.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (3879) Google Scholar). We found that deletion of any gene encoding a component of holo-Elongator results in similar phenotypes and that concomitant deletion of moreELP genes fails to confer a new phenotype. In this respect, Elongator seems fundamentally different from other transcription-related multisubunit complexes, such as Mediator, Swi/Snf, Rsc, ADA, and SAGA. Mutation of genes encoding subunits of these complexes often confer very different phenotypes, indicating that these factors are at least partly composed of subcomplexes or components with different specialized (gene-specific) functions. Additionally, some of the components of these factors, such as Gcn5 (a component of both ADA and SAGA) and Arp7/9 (components of both Swi/Snf and Rsc) perform functions in more than one factor, which likely contributes to diversified phenotypes (12Grant P.A. Duggan L. Cote J. Roberts S.M. Brownell J.E. Candau R. Ohba R. Owen-Hughes T. Allis C.D. Winston F. Berger S.L. Workman J.L.

Cell. 1998; 2: 639-651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Based on these observations and the above-mentioned fundamental difference between Elongator and other multisubunit factors, it may be argued that the products of the ELP genes are likely to only exert their function together, in the context of Elongator. In agreement with this, we have failed to observe other proteins than the six holo-Elongator subunits after affinity purification from a strain expressing epitope-tagged Elp4 (TP and JQS, data not shown). It may also be significant that a point mutation resulting in loss of Elp3 HAT activity also confers the full elp phenotype. This indicates that the most important function of holo-Elongator lies in its capacity as a HAT. ELP1 is identical to IKI3, and the newly identified ELP5 gene is identical to IKI1.We found that the interesting and intriguing insensitivity to expression of the K. lactis killer γ-toxin is a phenotype shared by all the elp strains. While this work was in progress, Frohloff et al.(23) reported the identification of mutants from a killer toxin screen virtually identical to theIKI screen and named their isolated mutants TOT(for toxin target). From this screen,TOT1, 2, and 3 were found to be identical to ELP1, ELP2, and ELP3, respectively. The authors also found that the protein product ofIKI1/TOT5, as well as the product of a gene isolated in another killer toxin screen, KTI12/TOT4 (killer toxin insensitive 12), could be co-immunoprecipitated with Elongator proteins, indicating that all the gene products isolated so far as intracellular effectors of the killer toxin interact. Our identification of Iki1/Tot5 as a component of holo-Elongator (Elp5) provides an explanation for the Iki1/Tot5-Elongator interaction observed by Frohloff et al. (23Frohloff F. Fichtner L. Jablonowski D. Breunig K.D. Schaffrath R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1993-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). By contrast, extensive analysis by mass spectrometry did not provide any evidence for the presence of Kti12 in highly purified Elongator preparations. Because the kti12/tot4 mutant was shown to have phenotypes strikingly similar to those of elp mutants (23Frohloff F. Fichtner L. Jablonowski D. Breunig K.D. Schaffrath R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1993-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), however, it is likely that this protein plays a role in Elongator function. Importantly, expression of KTI12/TOT4 from multicopy plasmids, but not similar overexpression of ELP1/TOT1,ELP2/TOT2, ELP3/TOT3, or ELP5/TOT5,confers γ-toxin resistance (23Frohloff F. Fichtner L. Jablonowski D. Breunig K.D. Schaffrath R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1993-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings thus suggest that Kti12/Tot4 is not a component of Elongator, but rather influences its activity. This possibility is presently under investigation. Human homologues ofELP1 and ELP3 have been identified by searching the data bases (8Otero G. Fellows J. Li Y. de Bizemont T. Dirac A.M.G. Gustafsson C.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q.

In support of the notion that the structure and function of holo-Elongator is highly conserved among eukaryotes, we identified a human homologue of the yeast ELP4 gene, which has previously been submitted to the data bases and namedPAXNEB. This gene is ubiquitously expressed, and is located in a region on chromosome 11 that has been implicated in human disease. Heterozygous deletion of the 11p13 region gives rise to WAGRsyndrome: Wilm's tumor, Aniridia,Genitourinary abnormalities, and mentalRetardation. Most of these abnormalities are due to deletion of the well studied disease genes, PAX6 andWT1, but the cause(s) of the mental retardation remains to be identified. Other disease-related loci, such as those associated with loss of heterozygosity in breast and bladder cancers, also map to this region (Ref. 20Miles C. Elgar G. Coles E.

We are presently isolating human Elongator with the aim to explore the molecular structure and function of Elongator in metazoans.

We examine the relative roles of these receptors in the activation of human CTL using mutations in MHC class I designed to diminish or abrogate the CD8/pMHC interaction. We use surface plasmon resonance to determine that point mutation of the α3 loop of HLA A2 abrogates the CD8/pMHC interaction without affecting the affinity of the T cell receptor/pMHC interaction. Antigen-presenting cells expressing HLA A2 which does not bind to CD8 fail to activate CTL at any peptide concentration. Comparison of CTL activation by targets expressing HLA A2 with normal, abrogated, or diminished CD8/pMHC interaction show that the CD8/pMHC interaction enhances sensitivity to antigen. We determine that the biochemical basis for coreceptor dependence is the activation of the 23-kDa phosphoform of the CD3ζ chain. In addition, we produce mutant MHC class I multimers that specifically stain but do not activate CTL. These reagents may prove useful in circumventing undesirable activation-related perturbation of intracellular processes when pMHC multimers are used to phenotype antigen-specific CD8+ lymphocytes.

The antigen specificity of T lymphocytes is conferred by the T cell receptor (TCR), whose highly variable complementarity-determining regions interact with the α1/α2 domain platform of the MHC and the bound peptide. Engagement of the TCR with peptide-MHC (pMHC) activates an intracellular signal transduction cascade via the TCR-associated chains of the CD3-ζ2 complex. The signal from the TCR ultimately leads to activation of the various T cell effector functions. In addition to its role in presenting antigen to the TCR, pMHC also interacts with the T cell coreceptors CD4 and CD8, which bind to invariable regions of MHC class II and MHC class I molecules, respectively. These coreceptors are critical for the development and activation of most T cells. Three possible roles for the coreceptor in T cell activation can be envisaged (1Gao G.F. Jakobsen B.K. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 630-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). First, the coreceptors perform a role in TCR signal transduction. After T cells engage pMHC, the earliest intracellular events induce specific phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motifs within the cytoplasmic tails of the TCR-associated CD3 complex. The cytoplasmic tails of CD4 and the CD8 α-chain are associated with the protein tyrosine kinase p56lck. Active p56lck initiates TCR signal transduction by phosphorylating the immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motifs within the CD3 complex. However, functional T cell activation, including p56lck activation, can be achieved without involving coreceptor-MHC contacts, for example with monoclonal antibodies against components of the TCR-CD3 complex (2Kwan-Lim G. Ong T. Aosai F. Stauss H. Zamoyska R. Int. Immunol. 1993; 5: 1219-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 3Yoon S. Dianzani U. Bottomly K. Janeway C.J. Immunity. 1994; 1: 563-569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it remains unclear whether T cell activation by physiological levels of pMHC antigen always requires signaling through the coreceptor or whether this function is dispensable under certain conditions (4Chan I. Limmer A. Louie M. Bullock E. Fung-Leung W. Mak T. Loh D. Science. 1993; 261: 1581-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 5Glaichenhaus N. Shastri N. Littman D. Turner J.

Second, the co-receptor may have a role in assisting cell-cell adhesion, helping to tether the T cell to the APC (7Norment A. Salter R. Parham P. Engelhard V. Littman D. Nature. 1988; 336: 79-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Third, the co-receptor may assist the TCR-MHC interaction by binding cooperatively with the TCR to the same pMHC molecule (8Luescher I. Vivier E. Layer A. Mahiou J. Godeau F. Malissen B. Romero P. Nature. 1995; 373: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). For the murine MHC class I antigen recognition complex, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) suggests that binding of soluble CD8αα and TCRs to immobilized pMHC class I decreases the dissociation-rate of the TCR/pMHC interaction by approximately 7-fold (9Garcia K. Scott C. Brunmark A. Carbone F. Peterson P. Wilson I. Teyton L. Nature. 1996; 384: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). However, it is difficult to envisage how this cooperativity might arise in the human TCR/pMHC interaction. Comparison of the structures of the human TCR-HLA A2 and CD8-HLA A2 complexes (10Gao G.F. Tormo J. Gerth U.C. Wyer J.R. McMichael A.J. Stuart D.I. Bell J.I. Jones E.Y. Jakobsen B.K. Nature. 1997; 387: 630-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) shows that binding of the CD8αα homodimer to HLA A2 does not transmit structural changes to the TCR binding site (10Gao G.F. Tormo J. Gerth U.C. Wyer J.R. McMichael A.J. Stuart D.I. Bell J.I. Jones E.Y. Jakobsen B.K. Nature. 1997; 387: 630-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), suggesting that formation of the human CD8-MHC-TCR complex is not cooperative. SPR measurements confirm this notion and do not indicate an increase in binding of human TCRs to HLA A2 in the presence of human CD8αα (11Wyer J.R. Willcox B.E. Gao G.F. Gerth U.C. Davis S.J.

In this study, we use cell surface expressed and soluble multimeric pMHC complexes mutated to alter the CD8/pMHC interaction to evaluate the role of the CD8 coreceptor in the activation of human CTL. The HLA A2 HIV-1 Gag p17-8 (SLYNTVATL)-specific CTL were cultured from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of HIV-1-infected patients 868 and 003 as previously described (12Sewell A.K. Harcourt G.C. Goulder P.J. Price D.A. Phillips R.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2323-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The melanoma-specific CTL clone 3G10 has been described elsewhere (13Dunbar P. Chen J. Chao D. Rust N. Teisserenc H. Ogg G. Romero P. Weynants P. Cerundolo V. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6959-6962PubMed Google Scholar). B cells were transformed by infecting 5 × 106 peripheral blood mononuclear cells with 1 ml of supernatant from Epstein-Barr virus-infected B95-8 cells (14Walls E.V. Crawford D.H. Klaus G.G.B. Lymphocytes. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 149-162Google Scholar). Cells were pelleted and resuspended vigorously in 20 ml of lysis buffer (10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 140 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, 10 µg/ml leupeptin). Nuclei were pelleted (15 min at 13,000 rpm), and supernatants were boiled for 5 min after the addition of 5 µl of reducing buffer (125 mmTris, pH 6.6, 20% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 4% SDS). Proteins were separated overnight by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 12% acrylamide and subsequently transferred onto Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by semidry Western blotting. Blots were blocked for 2 h at 4 °C with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS-Tween (0.1% Tween 20 in PBS) and probed overnight with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 at 4 °C (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.; 1 µg/ml, 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS-Tween). Peroxidase-linked anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used as secondary antibody and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To control for protein loading, blots were reprobed to detect total cellular ZAP 70. To reprobe blots, membranes were left at 4 °C for at least 48 h to allow peroxidase to inactivate. Membranes were rehydrated in PBS-Tween and incubated with anti-ZAP 70 polyclonal antibody derived from goat (Serotech; 1:1000 in 2.5% milk powder/PBS-Tween) overnight at 4 °C. Blots were washed 3 times for 10 min in PBS-Tween and subsequently incubated with peroxidase-linked anti-goat secondary antibody (Serotech; 1:1000 dilution in 2.5% milk powder/PBS-Tween) for 90 min at 4 °C. Membranes were washed 3 times for 15 min with PBS-Tween, and peroxidase activity was detected by ECL. For activation of CTL by APC, peptide-pulsed Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cell lines (14Walls E.V. Crawford D.H. Klaus G.G.B. Lymphocytes. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 149-162Google Scholar) were presented to CTL at a ratio of 1:10 in a final volume of 50 µl (15Purbhoo M.A. Sewell A.K. Klenerman P. Goulder P.J. Hilyard K.L. Bell J.I. Jakobsen B.K. Phillips R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4527-4532Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Biotinylated peptide-HLA A2 complexes were prepared as previously described (16O'Callaghan C. Byford M. Wyer J. Willcox B. Jakobsen B. McMichael A. Bell J. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 266: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). HLA A2 was multimerized by the addition of PE-conjugated streptavidin. Concentration of pMHC multimers as expressed throughout refers only to the pMHC component. C1R cells (17Storkus W. Howell D. Salter R. Dawson J. Cresswell P. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 1657-1659PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum. C1R cells were transfected by electroporation (Bio-Rad), and transfectants were selected by culturing cells in 1 mg/ml G418 sulfate 48 h after electroporation. Transfectants were stained with conformation-specific anti-HLA A2 antibody BB7.2 (18Ways J. Parham P. J. Immunol. 1983; 131: 856-863PubMed Google Scholar) and sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting to pool the fraction of cells expressing the highest levels of HLA A2. Clones were established and stained with BB7.2 to select clones expressing similar levels of wild type or mutant HLA A2. We have previously examined the binding to MHC of the HLA A2-restricted influenza matrix epitope GILGFVFTL, the HIV-1 Gag-derived epitope SLYNTVATL, and 10 natural variants of this peptide using a conventional stabilization assay (12Sewell A.K. Harcourt G.C. Goulder P.J. Price D.A. Phillips R.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2323-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and cell surface stabilization by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (as in Ref. 19Chen W. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 156: 245-254PubMed Google Scholar). The relative binding efficiencies obtained correlate well with the efficiency of HLA A2 refolding in solution (data not shown). Thus, relative stabilization in solution (refolding) gives similar results to relative stabilization (peptide loading) on the cell surface. Since wild type, A245V, and D227K/T228A HLA A2 stably refold around the YMDGTMSQV melanoma peptide to an identical extent in solution during tetramer production, equal peptide-loading efficiency of these molecules when transfected and expressed on cell surface is implicit. Soluble human TCR and CD8αα were prepared as described before (11Wyer J.R. Willcox B.E. Gao G.F. Gerth U.C. Davis S.J. Bell J.I. van der Merwe P.A. Jakobsen B.K.

Briefly, all proteins were expressed in the form of insoluble inclusion bodies inEscherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS from a plasmid containing the gene encoding the protein under the control of a T7 promoter. Inclusion bodies were released from E. coli by sonication and purified by washing with buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100. Prior to refolding, protein was solubilized in a buffer containing 6 m guanidine HCl and 10 mmdithiothreitol. Refolding was initiated by rapid dilution of protein into refolding buffer containing 0.4 ml-arginine-HCl and a redox couple (3.7 mmcystamine, 6.6 mm β-mercaptoethylamine) to a concentration of 60 mg/liter. In the case of soluble TCR, the refolding buffer also contained 5 m urea, and in the case of pMHC complexes, the refolding buffer also contained 4 mg/liter synthetic peptide. Proteins were purified using standard column chromatography techniques. Human CD8 was first dialyzed against 10 mm MES, pH 6.0, and then purified by cation exchange chromatography on a POROS 50 HS column, followed by gel filtration chromatography on an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Superdex 75 HR column. Human TCR was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris, pH 8.1, and then purified by anion exchange chromatography on a POROS 50 HQ column, followed by gel filtration chromatography on an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Superdex 200 HR column. Mouse CD8 was prepared as for human CD8. Human pMHC complexes were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris, pH 8.1, and then purified by anion exchange on a POROS 50 HQ column. Mouse pMHC complexes were concentrated using 10-kDa cut-off membranes and purified by gel filtration chromatography on an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Superdex 75 HR column. Both human and mouse pMHC complexes were expressed with a biotinylation tag on the C terminus and were biotinylated by incubation with BirA enzyme in the presence of Mg-ATP and biotin according to the method of Ref. 16O'Callaghan C.

Complexes were purified by gel filtration chromatography using an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Superdex 75 HR column. BIAcore biomolecular interaction analysis was performed using a BIAcore 3000™ machine equipped with a CM-5 sensor chip, which was modified with streptavidin using standard amine coupling, as previously described (11Wyer J.R.

Complexes were immobilized on the surface of individual cells to a concentration of ∼11,000 response units. After immobilization of the complexes, protein solutions were flowed over the cells in series at varying concentrations, and data were recorded. The data were analyzed with the BIAeval program, Excel, and Microcal Origin. K Dvalues were calculated, assuming 1:1 Langmuir binding (A +B ↔ AB), using nonlinear curve fitting to the following equation: AB =B*AB max/(K D +B). MHC class I molecules interact with both the TCR and its CD8 coreceptor. To dissect the contribution of the CD8/pMHC interaction to T cell activation from that of the TCR/pMHC interaction, we mutated two residues (D227K and T228A) in the α3 domain of HLA A2 that appear to be important for the interaction with CD8 (10Gao G.F. Tormo J. Gerth U.C. Wyer J.R. McMichael A.J. Stuart D.I. Bell J.I. Jones E.Y. Jakobsen B.K. Nature. 1997; 387: 630-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). SPR analysis showed that TCR binds with equal affinity to wild type HLA A2 and to the D227K/T228A mutant complexes (Fig. 1). Conversely, soluble CD8αα binds only to wild type HLA A2 but not to D227K/T228A HLA A2 (Fig. 1). The D227K/T228A mutations thus inhibit the CD8/pMHC class I interaction without affecting the TCR/pMHC class I interaction. It has been suggested that the coreceptor stabilizes the interaction between pMHC and TCR. Multimeric forms of pMHC stably cohere to the T cell surface in an antigen-specific manner (24Howard M.C.

We have extensively characterized CTL from donors 003 and 868, which are specific for the HLA A2-restricted HIV-1 Gag p17-8 epitope (SLYNTVATL) (12Sewell A.K. Harcourt G.C. Goulder P.J. Price D.A. Phillips R.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2323-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 15Purbhoo M.A. Sewell A.K. Klenerman P. Goulder P.J. Hilyard K.L. Bell J.I. Jakobsen B.K. Phillips R.E.

Giangrande P. Phillips R.E. McMichael A.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1423-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We stained 003 and 868 CTL with multimeric complexes of SLYNTVATL-wild type HLA A2 and SLYNTVATL-D227K/T228A HLA A2 to determine the contribution of CD8 to the extent and rate of pMHC adhesion to antigen-specific T cells (Fig.2). Both wild type and D227K/T228A mutant pMHC multimers stain 868 and 003 CTL with equal efficiency at 37 °C (Fig. 2 A) and at 0 °C (data not shown). Furthermore, both multimers also stained CTL with similar intensity and at the same rate, achieving near maximal binding after only 5 min. Results for 003 CTL are shown in Fig. 2 B. Finally, the staining intensity with wild type and D227K/T228A mutant multimers titrated between 1 µg and 10 ng of multimer (Fig. 2 C), demonstrating a similar intensity of staining with both multimers even when used at low concentration. Since polyclonal cross-linking of the TCR can effect T cell activation, we used SLYNTVATL-wild type HLA A2 and SLYNTVATL-D227K/T228A HLA A2 multimers to investigate the contribution of CD8 to cellular activation (Fig. 3). The earliest biochemical events following TCR engagement with ligand are characterized by a series of protein tyrosine phosphorylation events that can be visualized in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots. We examined whether cross-linking of the TCR by soluble wild type pMHC multimers induced a normal pattern of early tyrosine phosphorylation by comparing this signal to that generated during physiological recognition (peptide presented on APC). Presentation of wild type pMHC class I multimers to 003 or 868 CTL induced tyrosine phosphorylation profiles almost identical to those induced by SLYNTVATL-bearing APC (Fig. 3 A, 003 and 868 panels, lanes 2 and 3). This suggests that multivalent pMHC/TCR engagement results in the correct integration of the multiple cytoplasmic components involved in the early TCR signal transduction cascade. In contrast, multimerizing TCR with the D227K/T228A mutant pMHC multimer failed to induce the wild type profile of protein tyrosine phosphorylation events associated with antigen recognition in both 003 and 868 CTL (Fig. 3 A). Several proteins critical for T cell activation (23-kDa CD3 ζ-chain and LAT) fail to become phosphorylated at all with the D227K/T228A mutant pMHC multimer (Fig. 3 A). Thus, the ability of pMHC multimer to interact with CD8 is essential for induction of the complete TCR signal transduction cascade. The use of mutant pMHC multimer excludes the possibility that activation seen with wild type pMHC multimer is due to free peptide. Further, the <10-kDa fraction of the multimer preparation, separated with a 10-kDa cut-off centricon (Amicon), failed to induce any tyrosine phosphorylation (data not shown). Although CD8 appears critical for induction of the complete TCR-associated signal transduction cascade, we have previously shown that even a partial early signal can be sufficient to activate downstream CTL effector functions (12Sewell A.K. Harcourt G.C. Goulder P.J. Price D.A. Phillips R.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2323-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 15Purbhoo M.A. Sewell A.K. Klenerman P. Goulder P.J. Hilyard K.L. Bell J.I. Jakobsen B.K. Phillips R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4527-4532Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To determine the role of CD8 in induction of CTL effector functions, we compared the ability of wild type and D227K/T228A HLA A2 multimers to effect degranulation of CTL. We gauged degranulation by measuring the release of the CC chemokine RANTES, which is stored within the lytic granules of CTL (Fig. 3 B) (27Wagner L. Yang O. Garcia-Zepeda E. Ge Y. Kalams S. Walker B. Pasternack M. Luster A. Nature. 1998; 391: 908-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 28Price D.A. Sewell A.K. Dong T. Tan R. Goulder P.J. Rowland Jones S.L. Phillips R.E. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 355-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The failure of the D227K/T228A HLA A2 multimer to induce complete TCR signal transduction translates into a failure to induce activation of CTL at low multimer concentration as measured by RANTES release (Fig. 3 B). However, this failure in activation was partially overcome by increasing the mutant multimer concentration by over 2 orders of magnitude (Fig. 3 B). Consequently, activation can be achieved, despite an incomplete intracellular signal, by the cross-linking of TCR alone, provided that there is a substantial amount of antigen. This suggests that the ability of MHC class I to interact with CD8 has a dramatic effect on the sensitivity of CTL to antigen. Although wild type pMHC class I multimers induce a physiological activation profile in CTL (Fig. 3 A), such stimulation is still significantly removed from the in vivosituation, where antigen is presented as a minority species on the surface of an APC. In order to examine the requirement for CD8 in the recognition of APC by CTL, the HLA class I-deficient B cell line C1R (17Storkus W. Howell D. Salter R. Dawson J. Cresswell P. J.

Furthermore, C1R cells were transfected with a second mutant HLA A2 whose α3 domain was mutated at a single residue, A245V, to resemble the α3 domain of HLA A68. HLA A68 binds to CD8 with over 10-fold less affinity than does HLA A2 (23Gao G.F. Willcox B.E. Wyer J.R. Boulter J.M. O'Callaghan C.A. Maenaka K. Stuart D.I. Jones E.Y. Van Der Merwe P.A. Bell J.I.

The use of C1R cells transfected with wild type HLA A2, D227K/T228A A2, and A245V A2 enabled the antigen-specific recognition of targets with a normal, abrogated, and reduced CD8/pMHC interaction to be compared. This allowed us to examine the role of the CD8/pMHC class I interaction in sensitivity to antigen. Cloned C1R transfectants were determined to express similar amounts of HLA A2 on the cell surface by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis using a conformation-specific HLA A2 antibody (data not shown). C1R transfectants were pulsed with the melanoma-derived HLA A2-restricted YMDGTMSQV epitope and presented to melanoma-specific CTL clone 3G10 (13Dunbar P. Chen J. Chao D. Rust N. Teisserenc H. Ogg G. Romero P. Weynants P. Cerundolo V. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6959-6962PubMed Google Scholar) in a lysis assay. C1R cells transfected with HLA A2 were efficient targets for CTL in lysis assays (Fig.4A), whereas the CD8-nonbinding D227K/T228A HLA A2 transfectants were not recognized efficiently at any peptide concentration tested. Additionally, recognition by CTL of C1R cells expressing the A68-like A245V HLA A2 was only achieved when cells were pulsed with peptide at between 1 and 2 orders of magnitude higher concentration than was sufficient for recognition of wild type HLA A2 transfectants. Staining 3G10 CTL with multimers of wild type and mutant HLA A2 presenting the YMDGTMSQV epitope confirmed that neither mutant HLA was deficient in its ability to bind cell surface TCR (Fig. 4 B). We correlated these functional data to biochemical events within the CTL by investigating the differential effects presentation of antigen-pulsed C1R transfectants had on induction of the early TCR signal transduction cascade (Fig. 4 C). We found that antigen recognition related most distinctly to the phosphorylation status of the CD3 ζ-chain, the phosphorylation of which represents the earliest biochemical event of the TCR signal transduction cascade. At high antigen concentration (10−5m), both wild type HLA A2 and A245V HLA A2 transfectants, but not the D227K/T228A HLA A2 transfectant, induce the 23-kDa phosphoform of the CD3 ζ-chain. However, at lower antigen concentration (10−6m), only wild type HLA A2 transfectants, but neither of the mutant HLA A2 transfectants, induces the 23-kDa phosphoform of the CD3 ζ-chain. We investigated the contribution of the CD8 coreceptor to stabilization of the TCR/pMHC interaction and signal transduction during MHC class I-restricted activation of human CTL. Mutations in the α3 domain of MHC class I that fully abrogate binding to CD8 do not affect interaction with the TCR (Fig. 1). Despite this, cells expressing such mutant MHC class I do not activate CTL (Fig. 4). Multimers of a mutant MHC class I molecule (D227K/T228A;227/8KA in Fig. 4) stain the CTL used in this study to a similar extent to wild type MHC class I multimers but fail to induce a normal TCR signal transduction cascade. It therefore appears that the CD8/pMHC interaction is not critical for the stable interaction of human pMHC multimers with cell surface TCR, but that this interaction is critical for physiological activation of human CTL. Furthermore, the CTL response to antigen was greatly reduced upon partial disruption of CD8 binding to pMHC by the A245V mutation (Fig. 4, 245V). These results clearly demonstrate that MHC class I-restricted T cell activation is not only dependent on this coreceptor but that the CD8/pMHC interaction enhances the sensitivity of CTL to antigen. Again we show that this enhanced sensitivity to antigen, mediated by CD8, is dependent on the ability of the coreceptor to effect signal transduction and does not derive from CD8-mediated stabilization of TCR-pMHC complexes. We further investigated the biochemical basis for the observed coreceptor dependence of human CTL activation. The CD8/pMHC class I interaction is essential for induction of the 23-kDa phosphoform (p23) of CD3ζ but is not required for induction of the 21-kDa phosphoform (p21) of CD3ζ (Figs. 3 A and 4 C). Functional antigen recognition is characterized by the induction of both the p21 and p23 forms of CD3ζ. The p23 form of CD3ζ contains completely phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motifs and is thus critical for T cell activation, since it allows propagation of the TCR signal transduction cascade. In contrast, the p21 form of CD3ζ contains only partially phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motifs (29Kersh E. Shaw A. Allen P. Science. 1998; 281: 572-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and so cannot effect T cell activation. The p21 form of the ζ-chain may even inhibit T cell activation (30Kersh E. Kersh G. Allen P. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1627-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Our observations thus indicate that the coreceptor dependence of antigen recognition by human CTL is afforded by the ability and extent of the CD"

To dissect the respective signaling pathways and biological functions mediated by these receptors in primary endothelial cells with two receptors intact, we, recently developed chimeric receptors (EGDR and EGLT) in which the extracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor was fused to the transmembrane domain and intracellular domain of KDR and Flt-1, respectively. With these fusion receptors, we have shown that KDR is solely responsible for VPF/VEGF-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation and migration, whereas Flt-1 showed an inhibitory effect on KDR-mediated proliferation but not migration. To further characterize the VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVEC proliferation and migration here, we have created several EGDR mutants by site-directed mutagenesis. We show that tyrosine residues 1059 and 951 of KDR are essential for VPF/VEGF-induced HUVEC proliferation and migration, respectively. Furthermore, the mutation of tyrosine 1059 to phenylanaline results in the complete loss of KDR/EGDR-mediated intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and MAPK phosphorylation, but the mutation of tyrosine 951 to phenylanaline did not affect these events.

Moreover, a number of other angiogenic cytokines act, at least in part, by up-regulating VPF/VEGF expression (5Dvorak H.F. Nagy J.A. Feng D. Brown L.F. Dvorak A.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol.

In addition, VPF/VEGF is the only angiogenic cytokine identified thus far that renders microvessels hyperpermeable to circulating macromolecules, a characteristic feature of angiogenic blood vessels (8Senger D.R.

Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 5629-5632PubMed Google Scholar). All of the VPF/VEGF activities are thought to be mediated by its interaction with two high affinity receptor tyrosine kinases, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (KDR, in human and Flk-1 in mice) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (Flt-1), which are selectively expressed on the vascular endothelium. A third receptor, neuropilin, has been discovered recently but its function is not clear (17Gagnon M.L. Bielenberg D.R. Gechtman Z. Miao H.Q. Takashima S. Soker S. Klagsbrun M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2048) Google Scholar). Both Flt-1 and KDR are essential for normal vascular development (19Fong G.H. Rossant J. Gertsenstein M. Breitman M.L. Nature. 1995; 376: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (2184) Google Scholar, 20Shalaby F. Ho J. Stanford W.L. Fischer K.D. Schuh A.C. Schwartz L. Bernstein A. Rossant J. Cell. 1997; 89: 981-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Flt-1 null mice do not survive beyond 8.5–9.5 days of gestation because of defective blood vessel formation that may cause increased numbers of endothelial progenitor cells (19Fong G.H. Rossant J. Gertsenstein M. Breitman M.L. Nature. 1995; 376: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (2184) Google Scholar). Homozygous Flk-1/KDR knockout mice have different phenotypes that include impaired hematopoiesis and lack of differentiated endothelial cells (20Shalaby F. Ho J. Stanford W.L. Fischer K.D. Schuh A.C. Schwartz L. Bernstein A. Rossant J. Cell. 1997; 89: 981-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Because both receptors are expressed on vascular endothelium, it has been difficult to define the respective roles of each in mediating the various signaling events and biological activities induced in the endothelium by VPF/VEGF. Current information, therefore, has been gleaned largely from: (a) studies with a cell line, porcine aortic endothelial cells, which do not express either receptor unless engineered to do so (21Joukov V. Sorsa T. Kumar V. Jeltsch M. Claesson-Welsh L. Cao Y. Saksela O. Kalkkinen N. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3898-3911Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 22Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); (b) studies with the placenta growth factor (PlGF), a ligand that binds Flt-1 but not KDR (23Petrova T.V. Makinen T. Alitalo K. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar); (c) the use of a Flt-1-specific antibody (24Kanno S. Oda N. Abe M. Terai Y. Ito M. Shitara K. Tabayashi K. Shibuya M. Sato Y. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2138-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar); (d) studies with antisense oligonucleotides that block Flt-1 expression (25Bernatchez P.N. Soker S. Sirois M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31047-31054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar); and (e) characterization of VPF/VEGF mutants that specifically bind Flt-1. To delineate the respective roles of KDR and Flt-1 in early passage endothelial cells in which both receptors remained intact and functional, we engineered two receptor chimeras (EGDR and EGLT) by fusing the extracellular domain of the EGF receptor (EGFR) with the transmembrane and intracellular domains of either KDR or Flt-1. These two receptor chimeras were overexpressed in early passages of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) with a retroviral vector (27Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). With this chimeric receptor system, we found results similar to others: KDR is responsible for VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVEC proliferation and migration (21Joukov V. Sorsa T. Kumar V. Jeltsch M. Claesson-Welsh L. Cao Y. Saksela O. Kalkkinen N. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3898-3911Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 22Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, our results suggest that the downstream signaling pathway of VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVEC proliferation was different from that of VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVEC migration (27Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In order to further characterize these different signaling pathways, we conducted the site-directed mutational analysis in the KDR chimera, EGDR. KDR possesses tyrosine kinase domains, tentative ATP-binding sites, and a long kinase-insert region. This kinase-insert region is known to contain several phosphorylation sites that show binding sites for different signaling molecules. At present, tyrosine residues 951, 996, 1054, and 1059 have been identified as autophosphorylation sites for KDR in a bacterial expression system (28Dougher-Vermazen M. Hulmes J.D. Bohlen P. Terman B.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 728-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, the importance of these tyrosine residues with respect to endothelial cell signaling is not yet well defined. In the present context, we show that the tyrosine residue 1059 of KDR is responsible for ligand-mediated intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, MAPK activation, and EC proliferation, whereas tyrosine residue 951 is required for EC migration.

HUVEC transduced with EGDR or its mutant were grown in the same medium without hEGF. HUVEC (passages 3 or 4) that were ∼80% confluent were used for most experiments. Cells were serum-starved in 0.1% fetal bovine serum in EBM for 24 h prior to testing. EGDR(Y951F), EGDR(Y1054F), and EGDR(Y1059F) were created by polymerase chain reaction site-directed mutagenesis. Briefly, TAC (Tyr-951), TAT (Tyr-1054), and TAT (Tyr-1059) were mutated to TTC, TTT, and TTT, respectively. All mutants were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis and subcloned into pMMP retroviral vector as described (27Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). To prepare the retrovirus, 293T cells were seeded at a density of 6 × 106 cells per 100-mm plate, 24 h before transfection. DNA transfection was carried out with the EffecteneTM transfection reagent (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). Two micrograms of the target gene (pMMP-EGDR or pMMP-LacZ, etc.), 1.5 µg of pMD.MLVgag.pol, and 0.5 µg of pMD.G DNA, encoding the cDNAs of the proteins that are required for virus packaging (kindly provided by Dr. Mulligan), were mixed in 300 µl of EC buffer (QIAGEN). Thirty-two microliters of enhancer was added to the DNA mixture. After incubation at room temperature for 2 min, 30 µl of effectene was added to the DNA mixture and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The DNA mixture was added dropwise to 293T cells. The medium was changed after 16 h. The retrovirus was isolated 48 h after transfection and used immediately for infection or frozen at −70 °C. Twenty-four hours before infection, HUVEC were seeded at a density of 0.3 × 106 cells per 100-mm plate. One milliliter of retrovirus solution and 5 ml of fresh medium (∼2 × 107 plaque-forming units per milliliter) were added to cells with 10 µg/ml polybrene. Medium was changed after 16 h, and the cells were ready for experiment 48 h after infection. Forty-eight hours after infection, HUVEC were serum-starved for 24 h and stimulated with different concentrations of EGF for various lengths of time as indicated. Stimulation was halted by the addition of ice-cold PBS, and the cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and lysed with cold radioimmune precipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 µg/ml leupeptin, 0.5% aprotinin, and 2 µg/ml pepstatin A). Cell lysates were collected after centrifugation for 15 min at 4 °C. Five-hundred micrograms of lysate protein was incubated with 1 µg of different antibodies (as indicated) for 1 h and protein A-conjugated agarose beads at 4 °C for another hour. Beads were washed with radioimmune precipitation buffer three times, and immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer for Western blot analysis. Serum-starved HUVEC (infected with retrovirus) were washed with PBS twice and incubated with 4 ml of collagenase solution (0.2 µg/ml collagenase, 0.2 µg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 µg/ml BSA, and 2 mm EDTA in PBS) at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were detached by gentle scraping and centrifuged at 1100 rpm for 3 min. Cell pellets were washed two times with cold PBS containing 0.1% BSA and were resuspended in the same buffer at 0.5 × 106 cells/ml. Then aliquots (1 × 105 cells in 200 µl) were added to 96-well plates and were pelleted by centrifugation at 1300 rpm for 3 min. Cells were resuspended in 10 µl of the same buffer containing 1 µg of mouse anti-EGFR-N antibody or mouse IgG and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Cells were centrifuged at 1300 rpm for 3 min. Cell pellets were washed two times with the same buffer, resuspended in 10 µl of the same buffer containing 2.5 µg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody, and incubated at 4 °C for 0.5 h. Cells were then washed two times and resuspended in 400 µl of the same buffer. FACS analysis was carried out in a FACS Calibur instrument (BD Biosciences) with Cellquest software. Forty-eight hours after infection, HUVEC were serum-starved for 24 h, washed with PBS twice, and incubated with 4 ml of collagenase solution (0.2 µg/ml collagenase, 0.2 µg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 µg/ml BSA, and 2 mm EDTA in PBS) at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were detached by gentle scraping and centrifuged at 1100 rpm for 3 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in 2 ml of Ca2+ buffer (5 mm KCl, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, 0.1% BSA, 0.25 mm sulfinpyrazone, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) and centrifuged again at the same speed. Cell pellets were resuspended in 2 ml of Ca2+ buffer containing 1 µg/ml Fura-2 and 0.02% pluronic F-127 and were incubated at 37 °C for 0.5 h. Cells were collected by centrifuging at 1100 rpm for 3 min and were resuspended in 2 ml of Ca2+ buffer for stimulation with EGF. Intracellular Ca2+ concentrations were measured with the DeltaScan Illumination System (Photon Technology International Inc.) using Felix software. Twenty-four hours after cells were seeded in a 24-well plate with 2 × 103 cells per well, HUVEC were infected with 0.2 ml of retrovirus as described above. After 2 days, cells were serum-starved (0.1% serum) for 24 h and then stimulated with 10 ng/ml VPF/VEGF or EGF for 20 h. 1 µCi/ml of [3H]thymidine was added to each well and 4 h later, cells were washed with cold PBS three times, fixed with 100% cold methanol for 15 min at 4 °C, precipitated with 10% cold trichloroacetic acid for 15 min at 4 °C, washed with water three times, and lysed with 200 µl of 0.1 n NaOH for 30 min at room temperature. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was measured in scintillation solution. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of quadruplicate values. Forty-eight hours after infection, HUVEC were serum-starved for 24 h, washed with PBS twice, and incubated with 4 ml of collagenase solution (0.2 µg/ml collagenase, 0.2 µg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 µg/ml BSA, and 2 mm EDTA in PBS) at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were detached by gentle scraping and centrifuged at 1100 rpm for 3 min and washed twice with EBM containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum. Cells were seeded (1 × 105cells per well) into the transwells coated with vitrogen (30 µg/ml), and the transwells were inserted into a 24-well plate containing 1 ml of the same medium. Cells over a range of 3 × 103 to 1 × 105 cells per well were seeded in a 96-well plate for the standard curve. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to allow the cells to attach, and then VPF/VEGF or EGF was added at a final concentration of 10 ng/ml. After incubation for an additional 2 h, cells remaining on the upper surface of the transwell filter membrane were wiped off with a cotton tip. The whole transwell membrane was cut out and placed in an individual well of the 96-well plate, which contained the cells for the standard curve. Two-hundred microliters of Cyquant DNA stain was added to each well containing cells or membrane, and the plate was kept at 4 °C overnight. After warming to room temperature, stained cells were counted in a spectrofluorometer (SpectraFluor; TECAN) with Delta Soft 3 software. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of quadruplicate values. All experiments were repeated at least three times. To further elucidate the different signaling pathways for KDR-mediated endothelial cell proliferation and migration, we created three mutants in the EGFR-KDR chimera (EGDR) by mutating tyrosines 951, 1054, and 1059 to phenylalanine. Tyrosine 951 is located in the receptor's kinase-insert domain, and the others are located in the catalytic domain. These mutants were designated EGDR(Y951F), EGDR(Y1054F), and EGDR(Y1059F), respectively. EGDR and these mutants were introduced into early passage HUVEC with a retroviral system, which we developed recently (27Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). HUVEC transduced with EGDR, EGDR(Y951F), EGDR(Y1054F), or EGDR(Y1059F) were lysed, and equal amounts of total proteins were immunoprecipitated with antibody against the N terminus of EGFR followed by immunoblotting with antibody against the C terminus of KDR. As expected, similar levels of protein were detected (Fig. 1A). Previously, we showed that no EGF receptor could be detected in HUVEC or HUVEC transduced with LacZ as control (27Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In order to confirm that the mutant proteins are expressed on the cell surface as receptors, we subjected the HUVEC transduced with EGDR or different mutants to FACS analysis with antibody against the N terminus of EGFR and normal mouse IgG as control. As shown in Fig. 1 B, about 100% of HUVEC infected with EGDR or mutants expressed the receptors on the cell surface, whereas no EGFR was detected on HUVEC transduced with LacZ. Next, we tested the phosphorylation state of EGDR and these mutants in response to EGF stimulation. HUVEC transduced with LacZ (as control), EGDR, EGDR(Y951F), EGDR(Y1054F), or EGDR(Y1059F) were stimulated with 10 ng/ml EGF for different time intervals as indicated. Cellular lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibody against the N terminus of EGFR followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Fig. 2, panel A shows that, in response to EGF, the EGDR receptor chimera is highly phosphorylated and maximized at 1 min, which is correlated well with the KDR phosphorylation in VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVEC (27Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). As control, no phosphorylation of receptor can be detected in EGF-stimulated HUVEC transduced with LacZ. Interestingly, the phosphorylation level of EGDR(Y951F) is much lower than that of wild-type EGDR, whereas that of EGDR(Y1059F) is almost undetectable. (If exposed for much longer, a weak band can be detected at 1- and 5-min stimulation periods, data not shown.) However, EGDR(Y1054F) shows a similar maximum phosphorylation level as wild-type EGDR, but the phosphorylation level is maximized at 5 min after EGF stimulation. The different phosphorylation states of these mutants were not attributed to lower expression levels of these proteins, because similar protein levels were detected when the blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-KDR C-terminal antibody (Fig. 2,panel B), nor caused by the loss of receptor activity (shown below). The results indicate that tyrosine residues 951 and 1059 of KDR are important for receptor phosphorylation in ligand-stimulated HUVEC. We further examined the effects of these EGDR mutants on HUVEC proliferation. As shown in Fig.3A, in serum-starved HUVEC transduced with either wild-type EGDR, EGDR(Y951F), or EGDR(Y1054F), EGF stimulation produced similar dose responses in trichloroacetic acid precipitable [3H]thymidine incorporation. On the contrary, HUVEC transduced with EGDR(Y1059F) or LacZ did not show any growth response to EGF (up to 100 ng/ml). However, all HUVEC transduced with different mutant receptors or LacZ show a similar response to VPF/VEGF stimulation, indicating that the lack of proliferative response of EGDR(Y1059F) is not due to the defect of the cells. Moreover, the difference of the maximal proliferation response of HUVEC between VPF/VEGF (endogenous) and EGF (receptor chimera) treatment is due to the anti-proliferative effect of Flt-1 on KDR, whereas EGF does not function through Flt-1 as described previously (27Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). These data provide evidence that tyrosine residue 1059 is essential for ligand-induced HUVEC proliferation whereas the other two tyrosine residues do not have a significant effect. This is the first report that indicates that only one tyrosine residue of KDR is necessary for VPF/VEGF-induced EC proliferation. To determine the tyrosine residue(s) responsible for VPF/VEGF-induced HUVEC migration, we have utilized similar strategies to those described previously (27Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 B, EGDR-transduced HUVEC show an equivalent maximum extent of migration with either VPF/VEGF or EGF treatment. Both tyrosine residue 1054 and 1059 mutants did not show any difference in the dose-response migratory activity as compared with that of wild-type receptors. Surprisingly, contrary to the other mutants, the single mutation of tyrosine 951 of KDR completely abolished the EGF-(up to 100 ng/ml) induced migratory activity in HUVEC transduced with EGDR(Y951F) but had no effect on VPF/VEGF-stimulated migration. This is the first evidence that different tyrosine residues are required for KDR-mediated HUVEC proliferation and migration. Next, we further characterized the EGDR-mediated signaling pathways of HUVEC proliferation and migration. As established previously by several groups (29Ito N. Wernstedt C. Engstrom U. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23410-23418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 30Seetharam L. Gotoh N. Maru Y. Neufeld G. Yamaguchi S. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 135-147PubMed Google Scholar), MAPK phosphorylation is detectable 10 min after stimulation of HUVEC by VPF/VEGF. Furthermore, PD98059, the MAPK kinase inhibitor, inhibited proliferation but not migration in VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVEC and EGF-stimulated EGDR/HUVEC, suggesting that MAPK phosphorylation is not required for migration (27Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In order to investigate the role of the different tyrosine residues of KDR in MAPK activation, cellular extracts from 10 ng/ml EGF-stimulated HUVEC transduced with LacZ, EGDR, and different receptor mutants were utilized to perform immunoblot analysis using an anti-phospho-MAPK antibody. As expected, we detected MAPK phosphorylation 10 min after stimulation of EGDR-transduced HUVEC cells with EGF. In contrast, mutation of tyrosine residue 1059 of KDR (EGDR(Y1059F)) showed no MAPK activation in response to EGF treatment. The other two mutants, EGDR(Y951F) and EGDR(Y1054F), had a similar response of EGF-stimulated MAPK activation to that of the wild-type receptor (Fig. 4). These data indicate that the tyrosine residue 1059 of KDR is essential for MAPK activation stimulated by VPF/VEGF. These data also confirm our previous finding that MAPK activation is not required for HUVEC migration because EGDR(Y1059F) cannot mediate ligand-induced MAPK activation but still can promote HUVEC migration as that of wild-type receptor. It is well known that VPF/VEGF treatment in EC can promote an increase of [Ca2+]i (31Brock T.A. Dvorak H.F. Senger D.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 213-221PubMed Google Scholar), and we have previously shown that this Ca2+ mobilization is activated through KDR or EGDR in response to VPF/VEGF or EGF, respectively (27Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). To define which tyrosine residue of KDR is responsible for increasing [Ca2+]i, we measured [Ca2+]i following EGF stimulation of HUVEC that express different mutant receptors. Fig.5shows that EGDR(Y1059F) is unable to mediate intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in response to EGF treatment, whereas the other two mutant receptors operate similarly to those of the wild-type receptor. These results indicate that tyrosine residue 1059 of KDR is also essential for increasing [Ca2+]i and suggest that signaling pathways leading to MAPK activation and intracellular Ca2+mobilization may initiate from the same tyrosine residue. Moreover, these data also suggest that, similar to MAPK activation, increasing [Ca2+]i might be essential for VPF/VEGF-induced EC proliferation but not migration. Because KDR has been shown to be specific and crucially important for tumor progression, targeting KDR function is a major goal of current anti-angiogenesis research (32Millauer B. Shawver L.K. Plate K.H. Risau W. Ullrich A. Nature. 1994; 367: 576-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). It is well documented that KDR is responsible for VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVEC proliferation and migration, but the residues responsible for these activities have not been defined. Previously, it was shown that tyrosine 951, 996, 1054, and 1059 of KDR are autophosphorylated in a bacterial system that overexpressed the catalytic domain of KDR (28Dougher-Vermazen M. Hulmes J.D. Bohlen P. Terman B.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 728-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was also demonstrated by Dougher and Terman (33Dougher M. Terman B.I. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1619-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) that tyrosine residues 1054 and 1059 were required for maximum autophosphorylation of KDR in response to VPF/VEGF when the KDR(Y1054F/Y1059F) mutant was overexpressed in 293 cells. However, the physiological role of these residues in endothelial cells was not well described. Furthermore, it was documented that there was no functional response of overexpressed KDR in non-endothelial cells stimulated by the ligand (34Shibuya M. Ito N. Claesson-Welsh L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1999; 237: 59-83PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we created mutants with tyrosines 951, 1054, and 1059 to phenylalanine in the EGFR-KDR chimera (EGDR) and expressed them in HUVEC that expressed endogenous KDR. As shown in Fig. 1 B, almost 100% of HUVEC transduced with EGDR, EGDR(Y951F), EGDR(Y1054F), or EGDR(Y1059F) expressed the receptors on the cell surface. Our data indicate that the level of receptor phosphorylation is greatly reduced in EGF-stimulated HUVEC transduced with EGDR(Y951F), whereas the receptor phosphorylation is almost undetectable in EGF-stimulated HUVEC transduced with EGDR(Y1059F). These results correlate very well with the data obtained from the bacterial overexpression system and from 293 cells expressing these mutants. More importantly, our data also indicate that tyrosines 951 and 1059 are required for EGF-stimulated EGDR/HUVEC migration and proliferation, respectively. Very recently, Dayanir et al. (35Dayanir V. Meyer R. Lashkari K. Rahimi N. J. Bio. Chem. 2001; 276: 17686-17692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) also reported mutational analysis carried out in the CSF-1/KDR fusion receptor. They demonstrated that mutation of tyrosines 799 and 1173 individually resulted in partial loss of proliferative activity, whereas the double mutant of tyrosines 799 and 1173 completely inhibited cell growth. They also reported that these tyrosine residues were docking sites for the p85 subunit of PI-3 kinase, and these mutants had no effect on ligand-stimulated MAPK phosphorylation. Our data clearly show that the EGDR(Y1059F) mutant loses its ability to mediate not only proliferation but also the MAPK phosphorylation in HUVEC stimulated with ligand. The latter correlates well with the finding that MAPK phosphorylation is required for cell proliferation. Taken together, these results may suggest that tyrosines 799, 1059, and 1173 are all involved in mediating proliferative activity. On the other hand, the tyrosine residues 799 and 1173 might be more involved in cell survival rather than cell proliferation, because neither of those tyrosines are related to MAPK activation and, more importantly, phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase was shown to be required for VPF/VEGF-stimulated EC survival (36Gerber H.P. McMurtrey A. Kowalski J. Yan M. Keyt B.A. Dixit V. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30336-30343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1721) Google Scholar). Previously, we also showed that Flt-1/EGLT down-regulates KDR/EGDR-mediated HUVEC proliferation, but not migration, and this inhibitory effect was at or before KDR/EGDR-mediated intracellular Ca2+ mobilization (27Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the MEK inhibitor, PD98059, inhibited VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVEC and EGF-stimulated EGDR/HUVEC proliferation, but not migration (27Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Here, we show that EGDR(Y1059F) inhibits intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and MAPK phosphorylation but not migration. By contrast, EGDR(Y951F), which does not mediate migration, has no effect on ligand-stimulated intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and MAPK phosphorylation. Taken together, these results suggest that intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and MAPK phosphorylation are not essential for KDR/EGDR-mediated HUVEC cell migration. Moreover, VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVEC proliferation and migration are mediated by different downstream signaling pathways. This study thus represents the first site-directed mutagenesis analysis of KDR/EGDR function in early passage primary EC and has identified two tyrosine residues responsible for KDR-mediated proliferation and migration, respectively. However, neither of these two signaling pathways is as yet fully defined, and further work is needed to demonstrate the complete complement of signaling steps and pathway regulators. We thank Dr. Jack Lawler for his comments and criticisms."

The ERs are members of the steroid-thyroid-retinoic acid superfamily of transcription factors (5Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6021) Google Scholar). In the classic model of steroid hormone action, β-estradiol induces homodimerization of ER, which is able to bind specific regulatory sequences in the promoters of ER target genes called estrogen response elements (EREs) (6Gronemeyer H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 89-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). It is through this classic model of steroid hormone action that ERs alter the expression of a set of target genes. Several target genes for ERα in hormone-responsive breast tumors have been described including progesterone receptor (PR) (7Kastner P. Krust A. Turcotte B. Stropp U. Tora L. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1603-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar), pS2 (8Masiakowski P. Breathnach R. Bloch J. Gannon F. Krust A. Chambon P.

These genes are directly activated by ERα, and the induction of gene expression depends on the ability for ERα to bind to the promoters of each target gene.Increasingly, it has been reported that estrogen acting through ERs can have profound effects on cell physiology through mechanisms independent of DNA binding. One mechanism that has been proposed is through the ability of ERα to regulate the activity of other nuclear transcription factors by mechanisms involving direct protein-protein interactions. In many cases the interactions between ERα and other nuclear factors have been shown to be ligand-dependent. One example of this alternate mechanism of gene regulation is the effect of ERα on the expression of AP1-regulated genes (13Paech K. Webb P. Kuiper G.G. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J. Kushner P.J. Scanlan T.S. Science. 1997; 277: 1508-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (2060) Google Scholar). ERα and ERβ have been shown to interact with AP1 but with differential ligand activation. In experiments in HeLa cells, ERα stimulated an AP1 reporter plasmid in the presence of estrogen or antiestrogens. However, ERβ demonstrated activation of AP1-mediated transcription only in the presence of antiestrogens. At the functional level, the classic model of steroid action and this alternate mechanism of ER action are indistinguishable; in both cases estradiol induces alterations in the pattern of gene expression. Through interaction with other nuclear factors, ERs are able to modulate the expression of genes normally controlled by factors that are not thought to be influenced by steroid hormones. More recently there has been an important finding that ERs can regulate the cell cycle and apoptosis through a small fraction of receptors that may be present in the cell membrane (14Kousteni S. Bellido T. Plotkin L.I. O'Brien C.A. Bodenner D.L. Han L. Han K. DiGregorio G.B. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Roberson P.K. Weinstein R.S. Jilka R.L. Manolagas S.C. Cell. 2001; 104: 719-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this model of regulation, the ligand-activated ERα, ERβ, or androgen receptor (AR) was able to attenuate apoptosis through the activation of the Src/Shc/ERK pathway.Understanding the mechanisms that regulate cell physiology in response to hormone is an important step toward developing new therapies for diseases of hormone-responsive tissues. We have identified additional proteins that interact with ligand-activated ERα using a yeast two-hybrid screen. One of these was a ligand-dependent interaction between ERα and the forkhead family transcription factor FKHR. This interaction was specific for ligand-activated ERα; no significant interaction could be detected between FKHR and AR, glucocorticoid receptor (GR), progesterone receptor (PR), or vitamin D receptor (VDR). A ligand-specific interaction between ERα and the related proteins FKHRL1 and AFX was also confirmed. The interaction between ERα and FKHR augmented transactivation through EREs but repressed the ability of FKHR to transactivate through an insulin-response sequence (IRS). Expression of FKHRL1 induced alterations in the cell cycle in MCF7 cells that were reversed with estrogen. These findings establish an important link between ERα and transcriptional regulation of the proapoptotic family of forkhead transcription factors and provide a novel mechanism of estrogen action in hormone-responsive cells.DISCUSSIONThe forkhead or “winged helix” transcription factors have been shown to play important roles in cell differentiation, embryogenesis, and oncogenesis (24Lai E.

Dev. 1996; 57: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). FKHR was first identified as a transcription factor that was involved in a translocation with PAX3 in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (26Shapiro D.N. Sublett J.E. Li B. Downing J.R. Naeve C.W. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5108-5112PubMed Google Scholar, 27Davis R.J. D'Cruz C.M. Lovell M.A. Biegel J.A. Barr F.G. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2869-2872PubMed Google Scholar, 28Fredericks W.J. Galili N.

Based on homology in the forkhead domain, FKHR is most closely related to two other human genes,FKHRL1 (16Anderson M.J. Viars C.S. Czekay S. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C. Genomics. 1998; 47: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) and AFX (29Borkhardt A. Repp R. Haas O.A. Leis T. Harbott J. Kreuder J. Hammermann J. Henn T. Lampert F.

Cytokine stimulation in lymphocytes is mediated through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and down-regulation of p27kip1 is a common pathway leading to cell cycle stimulation. It has been shown in B cells that the inactivation of FKHRL1 by phosphorylation results in decreased p27kip1 expression and reduced apoptosis (22Dijkers P.F. Medema R.H. Pals C. Banerji L.

Similarly in neuronal tissue, FKHRL1 has been shown to induce apoptosis through transcriptional mechanisms that induce a number of genes including Fas ligand (17Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J.

Akt-mediated phosphorylation of FKHRL1 is induced by survival factors and is associated with retention of FKHRL1 in the cytoplasm. In addition, the PTEN tumor suppressor gene is known to antagonize the activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (38Parsons R. Curr. Opin.

In PTEN-deficient cells, FKHR and FKHRL1 are retained in the cytoplasm, whereas restoring PTEN induces the translocation of FKHR to the nucleus and transcriptional activity (23Nakamura N.

In cells that demonstrate PTEN-mediated cell cycle arrest or apoptosis, FKHR activation is able to induce similar changes in cell cycle or apoptosis. AFX has also been shown to induce cell cycle arrest through the activation of p27kip1 (39Medema R.H. Kops G.J. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. Nature. 2000; 404: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar). Finally, these pathways have also been shown to be functional in breast cells. In MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells, epidermal growth factor treatment activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt and has been shown to induce FKHR phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion (40Jackson J.G. Kreisberg J.I. Koterba A.P. Yee D. Brattain M.G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4574-4581Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).Our studies have demonstrated that FKHR, FKHRL1, and AFX bind to ERα in a ligand-dependent fashion. One of the regions of FKHR involved in the interaction corresponds to the transactivation domain in the carboxyl terminus. The interaction of ERα with this region of FKHR was strongly dependent on β-estradiol. The data from reporter assays indicated that ERα repressed FKHR transactivation, and the repression by ERα was dependent on β-estradiol and partially reversed by Tamoxifen. The reporter assay data were supported by data showing that FKHRL1 and FKHRL1-TM induced alterations of the cell cycle in MCF7 cells that were reversed by estrogen. One interpretation is that under the conditions used here, FKHRL1 is inducing a cell cycle block in G2/M that is removed by estrogen. These results are consistent with a recent study showing that FKHR expression reduced the colony formation of MCF7 cells (41Zhao H.H. Herrera R.E. Coronado-Heinsohn E. Yang M.C. Ludes-Meyers J.H.

It has also been reported that estrogen replacement in postmenopausal women is protective for Alzheimer's disease (42Birge, S. J., McEwen, B. S., and Wise, P. M. (2001)Postgrad.

Because FKHRL1 has been shown to induce cell death by apoptosis in neuronal cells (17Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5359) Google Scholar), it is plausible that ERα interaction with forkhead proteins in neuronal tissue may support cell survival.The interaction between ERα and FKHR augmented ERα-dependent transactivation through EREs. This result was in contrast to a recent report by Zhao et al. (41Zhao H.H. Herrera R.E. Coronado-Heinsohn E. Yang M.C. Ludes-Meyers J.H. Seybold-Tilson K.J. Nawaz Z. Yee D. Barr F.G. Diab S.G.

Chem. 2001; 276: 27907-27912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), who reported that FKHR repressed ERα transactivation through EREs. However, those experiments were performed in HepG2 cells that constitutively express high levels of FKHR, which was in contrast to our experiments that were performed in hormone-responsive MCF7 cells that express negligible levels of FKHR. It may be that the differences in the physiologic effects of the ERα-FKHR interaction observed depend on the cell line and the promoter being studied. Nevertheless, the finding that the ERα-FKHR interaction augments ERα transactivation at an ERE while repressing FKHR-mediated transactivation makes physiologic sense in light the role of estrogen as a mitogen. Our data suggest that in cells in which both factors are expressed, the presence of estrogen stimulates expression of ERα-responsive target genes while repressing FKHR target genes, resulting in progression of the cell cycle. Estrogen withdrawal (or treatment with antiestrogens) promotes FKHR activation, expression of FKHR target genes, loss of ERα target genes, and cell cycle arrest.A variety of cofactors have been described for ERα, and the repertoire of cofactors that are expressed will vary from cell to cell and within the same cell type depending on the physiologic conditions. This consideration was also evident in our examination of the effect of ERα on FKHR-mediated transactivation through an IRS element. Repression by ERα was maximal at 60–72 h after β-estradiol treatment but was negligible at 24 h and intermediate at 48 h (data not shown). This means that the physiologic effect of the ERα-FKHR interaction in MCF7 cells is likely to be influenced by factors induced by β-estradiol and may not be present in cells that do not express the receptor.In summary, we have demonstrated a ligand-dependent interaction between ERα and the FKHR family of forkhead transcription factors. These data provide a novel mechanism of estrogen regulation through the modulation of forkhead transcription factors. This finding describes an important link between cell surface signaling mechanisms that act through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway and nuclear hormone receptors. The physiologic consequences of this interaction will likely depend on the cell type and growth state of the cell. However, ERα and the forkhead proteins are found in a plethora of cell types, and this interaction is likely to influence either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in a variety of tissues. The identification of cross-talk between these two signaling mechanisms also provides an important mechanism whereby steroid hormones can influence the action of cell surface receptors and cell surface ligands can influence the actions of steroid hormones. Estrogen and related steroid ligands play a critical role in the normal development and function of numerous cell types. Estrogens induce physiologic effects through an interaction with nuclear steroid receptors. Two human estrogen receptors have been identified, ERα1 and ERβ (1Green S. Walter P. Kumar V. Krust A.

The ERs are members of the steroid-thyroid-retinoic acid superfamily of transcription factors (5Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6021) Google Scholar). In the classic model of steroid hormone action, β-estradiol induces homodimerization of ER, which is able to bind specific regulatory sequences in the promoters of ER target genes called estrogen response elements (EREs) (6Gronemeyer H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 89-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). It is through this classic model of steroid hormone action that ERs alter the expression of a set of target genes. Several target genes for ERα in hormone-responsive breast tumors have been described including progesterone receptor (PR) (7Kastner P. Krust A. Turcotte B. Stropp U. Tora L. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P.

These genes are directly activated by ERα, and the induction of gene expression depends on the ability for ERα to bind to the promoters of each target gene. Increasingly, it has been reported that estrogen acting through ERs can have profound effects on cell physiology through mechanisms independent of DNA binding. One mechanism that has been proposed is through the ability of ERα to regulate the activity of other nuclear transcription factors by mechanisms involving direct protein-protein interactions. In many cases the interactions between ERα and other nuclear factors have been shown to be ligand-dependent. One example of this alternate mechanism of gene regulation is the effect of ERα on the expression of AP1-regulated genes (13Paech K. Webb P. Kuiper G.G. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J. Kushner P.J. Scanlan T.S. Science. 1997; 277: 1508-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (2060) Google Scholar). ERα and ERβ have been shown to interact with AP1 but with differential ligand activation. In experiments in HeLa cells, ERα stimulated an AP1 reporter plasmid in the presence of estrogen or antiestrogens. However, ERβ demonstrated activation of AP1-mediated transcription only in the presence of antiestrogens. At the functional level, the classic model of steroid action and this alternate mechanism of ER action are indistinguishable; in both cases estradiol induces alterations in the pattern of gene expression. Through interaction with other nuclear factors, ERs are able to modulate the expression of genes normally controlled by factors that are not thought to be influenced by steroid hormones. More recently there has been an important finding that ERs can regulate the cell cycle and apoptosis through a small fraction of receptors that may be present in the cell membrane (14Kousteni S. Bellido T. Plotkin L.I. O'Brien C.A. Bodenner D.L. Han L. Han K. DiGregorio G.B. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Roberson P.K. Weinstein R.S. Jilka R.L. Manolagas S.C. Cell. 2001; 104: 719-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this model of regulation, the ligand-activated ERα, ERβ, or androgen receptor (AR) was able to attenuate apoptosis through the activation of the Src/Shc/ERK pathway. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate cell physiology in response to hormone is an important step toward developing new therapies for diseases of hormone-responsive tissues. We have identified additional proteins that interact with ligand-activated ERα using a yeast two-hybrid screen. One of these was a ligand-dependent interaction between ERα and the forkhead family transcription factor FKHR. This interaction was specific for ligand-activated ERα; no significant interaction could be detected between FKHR and AR, glucocorticoid receptor (GR), progesterone receptor (PR), or vitamin D receptor (VDR). A ligand-specific interaction between ERα and the related proteins FKHRL1 and AFX was also confirmed. The interaction between ERα and FKHR augmented transactivation through EREs but repressed the ability of FKHR to transactivate through an insulin-response sequence (IRS). Expression of FKHRL1 induced alterations in the cell cycle in MCF7 cells that were reversed with estrogen. These findings establish an important link between ERα and transcriptional regulation of the proapoptotic family of forkhead transcription factors and provide a novel mechanism of estrogen action in hormone-responsive cells. DISCUSSIONThe forkhead or “winged helix” transcription factors have been shown to play important roles in cell differentiation, embryogenesis, and oncogenesis (24Lai E. Clark K.L. Burley S.K.

Dev. 1996; 57: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). FKHR was first identified as a transcription factor that was involved in a translocation with PAX3 in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (26Shapiro D.N. Sublett J.E. Li B. Downing J.R. Naeve C.W.

Based on homology in the forkhead domain, FKHR is most closely related to two other human genes,FKHRL1 (16Anderson M.J. Viars C.S. Czekay S. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C. Genomics. 1998; 47: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) and AFX (29Borkhardt A. Repp R. Haas O.A. Leis T. Harbott J. Kreuder J. Hammermann J. Henn T. Lampert F.

Studies of the functional regulation and physiologic effect of this gene family have confirmed the similarity initially based on their structural homology.

Estrogen withdrawal (or treatment with antiestrogens) promotes FKHR activation, expression of FKHR target genes, loss of ERα target genes, and cell cycle arrest.A variety of cofactors have been described for ERα, and the repertoire of cofactors that are expressed will vary from cell to cell and within the same cell type depending on the physiologic conditions. This consideration was also evident in our examination of the effect of ERα on FKHR-mediated transactivation through an IRS element. Repression by ERα was maximal at 60–72 h after β-estradiol treatment but was negligible at 24 h and intermediate at 48 h (data not shown). This means that the physiologic effect of the ERα-FKHR interaction in MCF7 cells is likely to be influenced by factors induced by β-estradiol and may not be present in cells that do not express the receptor.In summary, we have demonstrated a ligand-dependent interaction between ERα and the FKHR family of forkhead transcription factors. These data provide a novel mechanism of estrogen regulation through the modulation of forkhead transcription factors. This finding describes an important link between cell surface signaling mechanisms that act through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway and nuclear hormone receptors. The physiologic consequences of this interaction will likely depend on the cell type and growth state of the cell. However, ERα and the forkhead proteins are found in a plethora of cell types, and this interaction is likely to influence either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in a variety of tissues. The identification of cross-talk between these two signaling mechanisms also provides an important mechanism whereby steroid hormones can influence the action of cell surface receptors and cell surface ligands can influence the actions of steroid hormones. The forkhead or “winged helix” transcription factors have been shown to play important roles in cell differentiation, embryogenesis, and oncogenesis (24Lai E. Clark K.L. Burley S.K. Darnell Jr., J.E.

FKHR was first identified as a transcription factor that was involved in a translocation with PAX3 in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (26Shapiro D.N. Sublett J.E. Li B. Downing J.R. Naeve C.W. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5108-5112PubMed Google Scholar, 27Davis R.J. D'Cruz C.M. Lovell M.A. Biegel J.A. Barr F.G. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2869-2872PubMed Google Scholar, 28Fredericks W.J. Galili N.

Based on homology in the forkhead domain, FKHR is most closely related to two other human genes,FKHRL1 (16Anderson M.J. Viars C.S. Czekay S. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C. Genomics. 1998; 47: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) and AFX (29Borkhardt A. Repp R. Haas O.A. Leis T. Harbott J. Kreuder J. Hammermann J. Henn T. Lampert F.

Genetics. 1994; 137: 107-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of the functional regulation and physiologic effect of this gene family have confirmed the similarity initially based on their structural homology. The activity of FKHR and the related proteins are all regulated through phosphorylation by Akt (17Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J.

Insulin inactivation of FKHR is mediated through phosphorylation at three residues of FKHR (31Biggs III, W.H. Meisenhelder J. Hunter T. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Phosphorylated FKHR is retained in the cytoplasm, and its exclusion from the nucleus is associated with a loss of target gene expression (17Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7328-7333Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A number of studies have shown that FKHR and the related proteins can regulate apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Cytokine stimulation in lymphocytes is mediated through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and down-regulation of p27kip1 is a common pathway leading to cell cycle stimulation. It has been shown in B cells that the inactivation of FKHRL1 by phosphorylation results in decreased p27kip1 expression and reduced apoptosis (22Dijkers P.F. Medema R.H. Pals C. Banerji L. Thomas N.S. Lam E.W. Burgering B.M. Raaijmakers J.A. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9138-9148Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Similarly in neuronal tissue, FKHRL1 has been shown to induce apoptosis through transcriptional mechanisms that induce a number of genes including Fas ligand (17Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5359) Google Scholar). Akt-mediated phosphorylation of FKHRL1 is induced by survival factors and is associated with retention of FKHRL1 in the cytoplasm. In addition, the PTEN tumor suppressor gene is known to antagonize the activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (38Parsons R. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1998; 10: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In PTEN-deficient cells, FKHR and FKHRL1 are retained in the cytoplasm, whereas restoring PTEN induces the translocation of FKHR to the nucleus and transcriptional activity (23Nakamura N. Ramaswamy S. Vazquez F. Signoretti S. Loda M. Sellers W.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8969-8982Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). In cells that demonstrate PTEN-mediated cell cycle arrest or apoptosis, FKHR activation is able to induce similar changes in cell cycle or apoptosis. AFX has also been shown to induce cell cycle arrest through the activation of p27kip1 (39Medema R.H. Kops G.J. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. Nature. 2000; 404: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar). Finally, these pathways have also been shown to be functional in breast cells. In MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells, epidermal growth factor treatment activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt and has been shown to induce FKHR phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion (40Jackson J.G. Kreisberg J.I. Koterba A.P. Yee D. Brattain M.G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4574-4581Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Our studies have demonstrated that FKHR, FKHRL1, and AFX bind to ERα in a ligand-dependent fashion. One of the regions of FKHR involved in the interaction corresponds to the transactivation domain in the carboxyl terminus. The interaction of ERα with this region of FKHR was strongly dependent on β-estradiol. The data from reporter assays indicated that ERα repressed FKHR transactivation, and the repression by ERα was dependent on β-estradiol and partially reversed by Tamoxifen. The reporter assay data were supported by data showing that FKHRL1 and FKHRL1-TM induced alterations of the cell cycle in MCF7 cells that were reversed by estrogen. One interpretation is that under the conditions used here, FKHRL1 is inducing a cell cycle block in G2/M that is removed by estrogen. These results are consistent with a recent study showing that FKHR expression reduced the colony formation of MCF7 cells (41Zhao H.H. Herrera R.E. Coronado-Heinsohn E. Yang M.C. Ludes-Meyers J.H. Seybold-Tilson K.J. Nawaz Z. Yee D. Barr F.G. Diab S.G. Brown P.H. Fuqua S.A. Osborne C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27907-27912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Estrogen is known to act as a mitogen in hormone-responsive breast tumors, and the interaction between ERα and forkhead transcription factors may explain the cell cycle arrest induced by estrogen withdrawal or Tamoxifen treatment. It has also been reported that estrogen replacement in postmenopausal women is protective for Alzheimer's disease (42Birge, S. J., McEwen, B. S., and Wise, P. M. (2001)Postgrad. Med. 11–16Google Scholar, 43Kim H. Bang O.Y. Jung M.W. Ha S.D. Hong H.S. Huh K. Kim S.U. Mook-Jung I. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 302: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Because FKHRL1 has been shown to induce cell death by apoptosis in neuronal cells (17Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5359) Google Scholar), it is plausible that ERα interaction with forkhead proteins in neuronal tissue may support cell survival. The interaction between ERα and FKHR augmented ERα-dependent transactivation through EREs. This result was in contrast to a recent report by Zhao et al. (41Zhao H.H. Herrera R.E. Coronado-Heinsohn E. Yang M.C. Ludes-Meyers J.H. Seybold-Tilson K.J. Nawaz Z. Yee D. Barr F.G. Diab S.G. Brown P.H. Fuqua S.A. Osborne C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27907-27912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), who reported that FKHR repressed ERα transactivation through EREs. However, those experiments were performed in HepG2 cells that constitutively express high levels of FKHR, which was in contrast to our experiments that were performed in hormone-responsive MCF7 cells that express negligible levels of FKHR. It may be that the differences in the physiologic effects of the ERα-FKHR interaction observed depend on the cell line and the promoter being studied. Nevertheless, the finding that the ERα-FKHR interaction augments ERα transactivation at an ERE while repressing FKHR-mediated transactivation makes physiologic sense in light the role of estrogen as a mitogen. Our data suggest that in cells in which both factors are expressed, the presence of estrogen stimulates expression of ERα-responsive target genes while repressing FKHR target genes, resulting in progression of the cell cycle.

The protein (T. cruzi farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, TcFPPS) is an attractive target for drug development, since the growth of T. cruzi is inhibited by carbocation transition state/reactive intermediate analogs of its substrates, the nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates currently in use in bone resorption therapy. The protein predicted from the nucleotide sequence of the gene has 362 amino acids and a molecular mass of 41.2 kDa. Several sequence motifs found in other FPPSs are present in TcFPPS. Heterologous expression of TcFPPS in Escherichia coliproduced a functional enzyme that was inhibited by the nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates alendronate, pamidronate, homorisedronate, and risedronate but was less sensitive to the non-nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate etidronate, which, unlike the nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates, does not affect parasite growth.

One possible solution to these problems is to find drugs active against T. cruzi that have already been developed for other uses in humans and have therefore been demonstrated to have low toxicity. An example of this approach is offered by the potential use of bisphosphonates, currently used in bone resorption therapy, as anti-Chagasic drugs (2Urbina J.A. Moreno B. Vierkotter S. Oldfield E.

Bisphosphonates are pyrophosphate analogs in which the oxygen bridge between the two phosphorus atoms has been replaced by a carbon substituted with various side chains. Several bisphosphonates are potent inhibitors of bone resorption and are in clinical use for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis, Paget's disease, hypercalcemia caused by malignancy, tumor metastases in bone, and other ailments (4Rogers M.J.

In the present study, we report the cloning, sequencing, and heterologous expression of a T. cruzi gene, designated TcFPPS, that encodes a functional FPPS. The TcFPPS sequence and enzymatic activity of the expressed protein indicate that it is an authentic member of the family of FPPSs, as found in other organisms (21Koyama T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1999; 63: 1671-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The recombinant enzyme was shown to be potently inhibited by nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates, while a non-nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate (etidronate) was far less inhibitory, as found with the human enzyme (22Dunford J.E. Thompson K. Coxon F.P. Luckman S.P. Hahn F.M. Poulter C.D. Ebetino F.H. Rogers M.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 235-242PubMed Google Scholar). A three-dimensional model of TcFPPS was constructed based on the x-ray structure of avian FPPS (23Tarshis L.C. Yan M. Poulter C.D. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10871-10877Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), and this has provided structural insights into several unique characteristics of the T. cruzienzyme. These results are also of general interest, since they demonstrate, for the first time, the expression and specific inhibition by bisphosphonates of an FPPS enzyme in a human pathogen, opening up the way to the design and synthesis of even more potent and specific FPPS inhibitors. Newborn calf serum, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, protease inhibitor mixture, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP), and isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) were purchased from Sigma. Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, Taq polymerase, the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase, Trizol reagent, and 0.24–9.5-kb RNA ladder were from Life Technologies, Inc. The PolyATract mRNA isolation system was from Promega (Madison, WI). pCR2.1-TOPO cloning kit was from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Hybond-N nylon membrane and [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.[4-14C]IPP (57.5 mCi/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The pET-28a+ expression system, the His.Bind® kit, and the thrombin cleavage kit were from Novagen (Madison, WI). Oligonucleotides FPPS1(5′-CGAGTGGCACATCTG-3′), FPPS2 (5′-CCCGTACGACCTCCG-3′),ATG-FPPS (5′-GTCGCTGCTAGCATGGCGTCCATGGAGCGGTTT-3′), andTAA-FPPS (5′-CGGCCCAAGCTTACTTCTTACGCTTGTGGGTTTT-3′) were synthesized at Sigma. T. cruzi amastigotes and trypomastigotes (Y strain) were obtained from the culture medium of L6E9 myoblasts as described previously (24Furuya T. Kashuba C. Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6428-6438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).T. cruzi epimastigotes (Y strain) were grown at 28 °C in liver infusion tryptose medium (25Bone G.J. Steinert M. Nature. 1956; 178: 308-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum. The hybridization probe for screening a T. cruzi genomic library (26Hill J.E. Scott D.A. Luo S. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) was obtained by using the PCR technique. A fragment of 283 bp of the TcFPPS gene (TcFPPSf) was amplified using the oligonucleotides FPPS1 and FPPS2 derived from aT. cruzi expressed sequence tag (GenBankTMaccession number AI046250) that showed pronounced similarity to FPPSs of other organisms. To amplify the TcFPPS gene, the PCR was performed with 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min for denaturation, 50 °C for 1 min for annealing, and 72 °C for 2 min for extension, using 1.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase with 500 ng ofT. cruzi genomic DNA, 25 pmol of each of the two oligonucleotide primers, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm each deoxynucleoside trisphosphate in a total volume of 50 μl using a PTC-100 Programmable Thermal Controller (MJ Research, Inc., Watertown, MA). The genomic library constructed in λGEM11 was replica-plated onto nylon membranes and screened as described previously (27Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Chapter 6. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). The isolated λGEM11 DNA was digested with restriction endonucleases, and a 3.5-kbBamHI-HindIII fragment that hybridized to the PCR probe was ligated into pBSKS+ and transformed intoEscherichia coli DH5α. TheBamHI-HindIII insert was sequenced in a 373A DNA Automatic Sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Appropriate primers were synthesized by using as a model both DNA strands from the coding region. The predicted amino acid sequence of TcFPPS was aligned with the sequences of other FPPSs using the Biology Workbench 3.2 utility (available on the World Wide Web at workbench.sdsc.edu). Total genomic DNA fromT. cruzi epimastigotes was isolated by phenol extraction (26Hill J.E. Scott D.A. Luo S. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), digested with different restriction enzymes, separated on a 1% agarose gel, and transferred to nylon membranes. The blot was probed with a [α-32P]dCTP-labeled TcFPPS. After hybridization, the blot was washed three times in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C (SSC is 0.15 m NaCl, 0.015 m sodium citrate). For the Northern blot analysis, total RNA was isolated from amastigotes, trypomastigotes, and epimastigotes using Trizol reagent, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Polyadenylated RNA was obtained with the PolyATract mRNA isolation system. RNA samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels containing 1× Mops buffer (20 mm Mops, 0.08 msodium acetate, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA) and 6.29% (v/v) formaldehyde after boiling for 10 min in 50% (v/v) formamide, 1× Mops buffer, and 5.9% (v/v) formaldehyde. The gels were transferred to a Hybond-N filter and hybridized with a probe containing the entire coding sequence of the TcFPPS gene obtained by PCR. All Southern and Northern blots were visualized by autoradiography. TheTcP0 (T. cruzi ribosomal protein 1) fragment used as a control in Northern blots was obtained as described before (24Furuya T. Kashuba C. Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6428-6438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Densitometric analyses of Northern blots were done with an ISI-1000 digital imaging system (Alpha Inotech Corp.). Comparison of levels ofTcFPPS transcription between the different stages was performed by taking as a reference the densitometric values obtained with the TcP0 transcripts and assuming a similar level of expression of this gene in all stages (28Skeiky Y.A.W. Benson D.R. Parsons M. Elkon K.B. Reed S.G. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained when the densitometric values were compared by taking into account the amount of RNA added to each lane. For expression in E. coli, the entire coding sequence of theTcFPPS gene was amplified using the PCR technique. Oligonucleotide primers for amplification of the FPPS coding region,ATG-FPPS and TAA-FPPS, were designed so thatNheI and HindIII restriction sites were introduced at the 5′- and 3′-ends for convenient cloning in the expression vector pET-28a+ to givepETcFPPS, which was cloned and propagated in E. coli DH5α. Double-stranded DNA sequencing was performed to confirm that the correct reading frame was used, with the polyhistidine tail placed in the N-terminal position. Subsequently,pETcFPPS was used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3). Bacterial clones were grown in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin. When induction was performed, bacterial cells transformed with pETcFPPS were first grown to anA600 of 0.6 at 37 °C, and then 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside was added. After 6 h of growth at 37 °C, cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 4 ml of 5 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) buffer and sonicated. The soluble extract was applied to a nickel-chelated agarose affinity column that had been equilibrated with the same buffer. The protein was eluted from the column as described by the kit manufacturer (Novagen). The eluted fraction was transferred into a dialysis cassette (molecular weight 10,000) and dialyzed against 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4). Extracts from E. coli expressing TcFPPS as a fusion protein possessed 40-fold higher activity than extracts prepared from control bacteria. Following affinity purification, the specific activity of TcFPPS was 80-fold higher than the activity in the extracts of the transformed E. coli, indicating that the gene encoded a functional FPPS activity. The polyhistidine tag was removed by thrombin cleavage as described by the kit manufacturer (Novagen). Proteins were determined by the method of Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216377) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The activity of the enzyme was determined by a radiometric assay based on that described before (30Rilling H.C. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 110: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μl of assay buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 47 μm [4-14C]IPP (10 μCi/μmol)), and 55 μm DMAPP or GPP was prewarmed to 37 °C. The assay was initiated by the addition of 10–20 ng of recombinant protein. The assay was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 37 °C and was terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 6m HCl. The reactions were made alkaline with 15 μl of 6m NaOH, diluted in 0.7 ml of water, and extracted with 1 ml of hexane. The hexane solution was washed with water and transferred to a scintillation vial for counting. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the activity required to incorporate 1 nmol of [4-14C]IPP into [4-14C]FPP in 1 min. To identify the reaction products after the enzymatic reaction, the radioactive prenyl products in the mixture were hydrolyzed to the corresponding alcohols with alkaline phosphatase as described before (31Ogura K. Nishino T. Shinka T. Seto S. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 110: 167-170Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The mixture was extracted with hexane and concentrated after the addition of farnesol, geraniol, and geranylgeraniol, as carriers, and the reaction products were separated on silica gel 60 plates (Merck), using a mixture of benzene/acetone (9:1) as solvent. The positions of the prenyl alcohols were visualized by using iodine vapor. The radioactivity was visualized by autoradiography. Sodium salts of the bisphosphonate compounds were synthesized, purified, and characterized as described previously (3Martin M.B. Grimley J.S. Lewis J.C. Heath III, H.T. Bailey B.N. Kendrick H. Yardley V. Caldera A. Lira R. Urbina J.A. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. Croft S.L. Oldfield E. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 909-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The structures of etidronate, homorisedronate, pamidronate, alendronate, and risedronate are shown in Fig.1. The purity of all samples was verified by microchemical analysis (H/C/N/P) and via 13C,31P, and 1H NMR spectroscopy, the1H NMR experiments being performed in triplicate using an internal maleic acid quantitation standard. Absolute compound purities as determined from these experiments were 97.9, 99.2, 98.1, and 98.8%, for homorisedronate, pamidronate, alendronate, and risedronate, respectively. Etidronate was obtained from Gador S.A. (Buenos Aires, Argentina). The structural similarities between the TcFPPS and the avian FPPS were examined by homology modeling theT. cruzi FPP synthase sequence onto the published structure of the avian FPPS in the presence of either GPP or FPP (23Tarshis L.C. Yan M. Poulter C.D. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10871-10877Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional models of TcFPPS were constructed following the sequence alignment (Fig. 2) and the three-dimensional homology using the coordinates of the avian x-ray crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code: 1UBW) (23Tarshis L.C. Yan M. Poulter C.D. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10871-10877Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). All steps of homology model building and refinement were performed within the Homology module of Insight II 2000 (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA). The Search Loops algorithm was used to display a range of possible loop geometries for the unique 11-mer region in the TcFPPS sequence. The entire three-dimensional models were in general subjected to molecular mechanics energy minimization calculations using the CHARMM (Chemistry at Harvard Molecular Mechanics) force field with a convergence criterion of 0.01 kcal/mol, resulting in protein models that are conformationally reasonable. We used ab initio Hartree-Fock methods (6-311G** basis sets) to evaluate the molecular electrostatic potentials, Φ(r), and the charge density, ρ(r), for etidronate and risedronate, basically as described previously (11Martin M.B. Arnold W. Heath H.T. Urbina J.A. Oldfield E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 754-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The results obtained are shown graphically in the docked ligand models described below (Fig. 9). A tBLASTn search of the data base from the Institute for Genome Research using the human FPPS sequence (P14324) indicated that the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by T. cruzi expressed sequence tag clone 18h5 (accession number AI046250) presented an aspartate-rich motif (region VI), which is one of the most conserved and characteristic motifs present in prenyltransferases. A PCR probe was obtained by amplification of the fragment of the putative T. cruzi FPPSgene, using oligonucleotide primers complementary to the expressed sequence tag and genomic T. cruzi DNA as template. The product of the amplification (283 bp) was ligated into vector pCR2.1TOPO for sequence analysis. A genomic DNA library constructed in λGEM11 (26Hill J.E. Scott D.A. Luo S. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) was screened with the specific PCR probe. Thirty positive clones were obtained in the first screening of approximately 3.0 × 105 plaque-forming units. After the third screening, one clone was selected for restriction analysis. The clone contained an insert that possessed the complete coding region of the FPPSgene. A BamHI-HindIII fragment was identified that hybridized strongly with the PCR probe. This 3.5-kb segment was ligated into pBSKS+, resulting in pFPPS3.5, and its complete sequence was determined on both strands. Translation of the open reading frame of 1086 bp yielded a polypeptide of 362 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 41,180 Da. A BLAST search of the protein data base showed that the amino acid sequence from T. cruzi has 35–39% identity and 48–55% similarity with other representative (mammalian, plant, yeast) FPPSs (Fig. 2). The amino acid sequence from the T. cruzi enzyme was aligned with the sequences of avian, human, Arabidopsis thaliana, andSaccharomyces cerevisiae synthases as shown in Fig. 2. All the conserved residues involved in catalysis or binding (regions I–VII) identified in other FPPSs (21Koyama T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1999; 63: 1671-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) are present in the T. cruzi enzyme. Southern blotting was performed with a PCR fragment that encompasses the entire coding region of TcFPPS (Fig.3 A). All restriction enzymes used, except NcoI, BglI, and NaeI, gave single, strong bands, which were distinct from one another. Observation of two bands with NcoI, BglI, andNaeI was due to the presence of unique restriction sites within the coding region of the gene, suggesting the presence of a single TcFPPS gene in the T. cruzi genome. In order to confirm the transcription of the TcFPPS gene, we performed Northern blot analysis using poly(A)+ RNA from different forms of the parasite and the TcFPPS gene as a probe. The presence of a single TcFPPS transcript of ∼1.85 kb after prolonged exposure was detected in each of the three life stages of T. cruzi (Fig. 3 B). Analysis of the 1.85-kb band by densitometry indicated that the TcFPPS gene was expressed at higher levels in trypomastigotes and epimastigotes than in amastigotes, while the amount of transcription of a ribosomal protein gene (TcP0) was at comparable levels in all three stages of the parasite. TcFPPS was expressed in E. coliBL21(DE3) as a fusion protein with an N-terminal polyhistidine tail. Affinity chromatography on a nickel-chelated agarose column permitted a simple one-step protein purification. Enzyme purity was judged by using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 4). The final protein preparation catalyzed the incorporation of [4-14C]IPP into hexane-extractable material when the allylic substrates, DMAPP and GPP, were used (data not shown). The product of the FPPS assay was analyzed by TLC, confirming that the purified protein shown in Fig. 4 catalyzed the synthesis of FPP. [4-14C]IPP incorporation into the organic solvent extractable material was linear with time for at least 60 min. The radioactive assay was performed in the presence of different concentrations of Mg2+ and Mn2+, to determine their effect on the T. cruzi FPPS. Mg2+ and Mn2+ were added to the reaction mixture at concentrations between 0.5 and 20 mm. As shown in TableI, optimal levels of activity were obtained by the addition of Mg2+ (1–5 mm). However, the enzymatic activity was very low when the divalent cation was Mn2+. The addition of 10 mm EDTA abolished FPPS activity. The T. cruzi enzyme activity was also assayed between pH 6 and 10.5 using a Tris-HCl (10 mm), Tris-glycine (10 mm) buffer. Optimum activity was observed between pH 8 and 9 (Fig. 5 A). Since the polyhistidine tag could potentially affect the enzymatic activity of TcFPPS, in two experiments, the polyhistidine tag was removed by thrombin cleavage. However, this treatment resulted in an almost complete loss (99.74 ± 0.07%) of the catalytic activity of the enzyme, presumably due either to misfolding or aggregation. Consequently, all activity and inhibition results reported were obtained with the His-tagged enzyme.Table IEffect of divalent cations on FPPS from T. cruziConcentr"
https://openalex.org/W1964075908,"Ubiquinone (UQ) is an essential cofactor for respiratory metabolism. In yeast, mutation of theCOQ7 gene results in the absence of UQ biosynthesis and demonstrates a role for this gene in the step leading to the hydroxylation of 5-demethoxyubiquinone. Intriguingly, the disruption of the corresponding gene in Caenorhabditis elegans, clk-1, results in a prolonged life span and a slowing of development. Because of the pleiotropic effect of this disruption, the small size of the protein, and the lack of obvious homology to other known hydroxylases, it has been suggested that Coq7 may be a regulatory or structural component in UQ biosynthesis, rather than acting as the hydroxylase per se. Here we identify Coq7 as belonging to a family of a di-iron containing oxidases/hydroxylases based on a conserved sequence motif for the iron ligands, supporting a direct function of Coq7 as a hydroxylase. We have cloned COQ7 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa andThiobacillus ferrooxidans and show that indeed this gene complements an Escherichia coli mutant that lacks an unrelated 5-demethoxyubiquinone hydroxylase. Based on the similarities to other well studied di-iron carboxylate proteins, we propose a structural model for Coq7 as an interfacial integral membrane protein.

Protoplasma. 2000; 213: 134-147Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These later steps utilize precursors that are identical apart from the length of the isoprenoid side chain, which varies according to organism. In yeast, COQ7 has been shown to be required for the hydroxylation of 5-demethoxyubiquinone (DMQ) to 5-hydroxyubiquinone at the penultimate step in the biosynthesis of UQ (3Marbois B.N. Clarke C.F.

Genomics. 1999; 58: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and have been identified in a few prokaryotes including Rickettsia prowazekii (8Andersson S.G. Zomorodipour A. Andersson J.O.

In S. cerevisiae, a point mutation within theCOQ7 gene disrupts UQ synthesis resulting in a petite (non-respiring) phenotype and accumulation of the UQ precursor, DMQ (3Marbois B.N. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2995-3004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In contrast, a deletion in the COQ7 gene causes accumulation of an earlier compound in the biosynthetic pathway, suggesting a possible regulatory or structural role of COQ7in UQ biosynthesis (2Clarke C. Protoplasma. 2000; 213: 134-147Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Disruption of the homologous gene (clk-1) in the more complex organism, C. elegans, results in an extended life span, a slowdown of developmental processes, and a slowing of a number of rhythmic adult behaviors (6Ewbank J.J. Barnes T.M. Lakowski B. Lussier M. Bussey H. Hekimi S. Science. 1997; 275: 980-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar,9Wong A. Boutis P. Hekimi S. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because there is no apparent effect upon mitochondrial respiration, this called into question whether clk-1 is involved in DMQ hydroxylation in C. elegans. Recent studies have addressed the disparity between the respiratory phenotypes in yeast and C. elegans. Jonassen et al. (10Jonassen T. Larsen P.L. Clarke C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) have shown that theC. elegans clk-1 mutant does not synthesize UQ but instead depends upon UQ from a dietary source (10Jonassen T. Larsen P.L. Clarke C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In addition, Miyaderaet al. (11Miyadera H. Amino H. Hiraishi A. Taka H.

These studies show that the striking pleiotropic effect of the clk-1 mutation occurs because of the absence of UQ biosynthesis. However, the question still remains as to whether COQ7/clk-1encodes the hydroxylase itself. The small size of this integral membrane protein (187 amino acids in C. elegans) and the lack of readily identifiable sequence homology to other known hydroxylases has led some workers to propose that COQ7 may instead encode a structural or regulatory component of the hydroxylation process (11Miyadera H.

In this paper we demonstrate that Coq7 does function as a DMQ hydroxylase by utilizing the fact that this step in Escherichia coli UQ biosynthesis is catalyzed by an evolutionarily unrelated protein, UbiF (12Kwon O. Kotsakis A. Meganathan R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 186: 157-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We identify and clone COQ7 fromPseudomonas aeruginosa and Thiobacillus ferrooxidans and show that it restores UQ biosynthesis in theubiF mutant strain, E. coli JF496. In addition, we identify a conserved iron binding motif that places the enzyme within the family of di-iron carboxylate proteins that includes soluble methane monooxygenase hydroxylase, two membrane-bound quinol oxidases, and a number of other enzymes. Structural modeling and comparison to these proteins provides insight into the nature of the active site, as well as the mode of membrane association.

Michaelis S. Wright A. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 142: 221-228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained from CGSC (Yale University, New Haven, CT). E. coli TOP10 and pBAD/ThioE were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). The COQ7 gene was cloned into pUNI-10 by PCR amplification of both the gene and the vector followed by cotransformation of 2.5 μl of each PCR product into 50 μl of CaCl2-competent E. coli BW23474, utilizing the endogenous recombinase activity of E. coli to recombine the fragments (15Yao Z. Jones D.H. Grose C. PCR Methods Appl. 1992; 1: 205-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids, pUNI-PaCOQ (P. aeruginosa COQ7) and pUNI-TfCOQ (T. ferrooxidans COQ7) were isolated and sequenced. The two genes were cloned into pUNI-10 to take advantage of the versatility of the Univector in vitro recombination system for rapid subcloning into a variety of expression plasmids (13Liu Q. Li M.Z. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 530-549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression vector pHB-MALc2M is derived from a low expressing mutant of pMALc2 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), pMALc2M, which was converted into a host expression vector by inserting a Cre-lox recombination site (loxP). Further details on the isolation and characterization of pMALc2M and the construction of pHB-MALc2M will be given elsewhere. 2D. A. Berthold, P. Stenmark, and P. Nordlund, manuscript in preparation. pUNI-PaCOQ and pUNI-TfCOQ were recombined in vitro with the expression host vectors pHB-MALc2M and/or pBAD/ThioE using Cre recombinase (13Liu Q. Li M.Z. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 530-549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and then transformed into E. coli TOP10. For complementation assays, expression plasmids or empty host vectors were freshly transformed into E. coli JF496 and grown at 37 °C to anA600 of 0.5–0.8 in LB with 60 μg/ml ampicillin. The cultures were diluted ∼1 × 105, and 50 μl was plated on M9 agar plates containing 1 mmMgSO4, 20 μm CaCl2, 5 μm FeSO4, 0.5 μg/ml thiamine, 0.12% casamino acids, 40 μg/ml d-l-methionine, 100 μg/ml l-asparagine, 60 μg/ml ampicillin and containing either 0.5% glucose or 0.5% succinate (12Kwon O. Kotsakis A. Meganathan R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 186: 157-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Where expression was to be induced, 0.1 mm IPTG or arabinose was added as indicated. To analyze quinone content, E. coli JF496 with or without expression plasmid was grown at 37 °C in LB with 0.5% glucose and harvested at an A600 of 0.5–1.0. Ampicillin (60 μg/ml) was added to the medium as required. 2 ml of E. colisuspension in 0.15 m NaCl (A600 of 4–6) was extracted with 18 ml of methanol and 12 ml of petroleum ether (b.p. 40–60 °C) (17Åberg F. Appelkvist E.L. Dallner G. Ernster L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 295: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). After phase separation, the upper phase was evaporated under nitrogen, and the lipid residue was dissolved in 400 μl of methanol:ethanol (1:1) and reduced with 4 μl of 0.5m NaBH4 in 0.05 m NaOH. Samples were analyzed by reverse phase HPLC (RESOLVE 5-μ spherical C18 column, 3.9 mm × 15 cm; Waters Associates, Millipore) coupled to an electrochemical detector (+0.70 V, oxidative mode). Solvent A (methanol:water, 9:1) and Solvent B (ethanol:2-propanol, 95:5) both contained 0.2% LiClO4. The system was run at 30% Solvent B for 5 min followed by a linear increase of Solvent B to 50% within 25 min, using a flow rate of 1 ml/min. When UQ8and DMQ8 were collected for analysis by mass spectrometry, LiClO4 was omitted and the absorption of the eluate was monitored at 210 nm. The collected quinones were dried under nitrogen and dissolved in methanol:hexane (19:1) for direct inlet introduction to the mass spectrometer (Quattro Ultima Micromass, Manchester, United Kingdom). The instrument was calibrated with CsI, and the electrospray ionization spectra were detected in negative mode. Bacterioferritin fromE. coli and Coq7 from P. aeruginosa(accession number AAG04044) and a third sequence that is suggested to be a bacterioferritin in P. aeruginosa(accession number AAG08265) were aligned using ClustalW (18Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55744) Google Scholar) and then manually adjusted. The alignment was used to thread the P. aeruginosa Coq7 sequence (residues 46–60, 62–121, and 131–195) upon the coordinates of the bacterioferritin structure (19Frolow F. Kalb A.J. Yariv J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) using Swiss Pdb Viewer (20Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9584) Google Scholar). DMQ was docked to the model manually. A number of databases were searched for the di-iron protein motif EXn1 EXXH Xn2 EXn3 EXXH. This yielded several groups of homologous proteins in addition to the subject of this study, the Coq7 homologues. Besides the annotated proteins, further searches uncovered many examples of sequences encoding protein homologous to Coq7 among the proteobacteria, including P. aeruginosa andT. ferrooxidans. An alignment of six representative Coq7 proteins is shown in Fig. 2. A total of 15 amino acids are completely conserved, including the four Glu and two His that are predicted to be ligands to a di-iron center (marked withstars in Fig. 2). Other members of the di-iron carboxylate protein family (reviewed in Ref. 21Solomon E.I. Brunold T.C. Davis M.I. Kemsley J.N. Lee S.-K. Lehnert N. Neese F. Skulan A.J. Yang Y.-S. Zhou J. Chem. Rev. 2000; 100: 235-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar), which all share this iron binding motif, include the ribonucleotide reductase subunit R2 (RNR), the hydroxylase subunit of methane monooxygenase (MMO), toluene monooxygenase, the acyl carrier protein Δ9 fatty acid desaturase, rubrerythrin, bacterioferritin, the mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX) (22Berthold D.A. Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1460: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and the plastid terminal (plastoquinol) oxidase (PTOX) (23Josse E.M. Simkin A.J. Gaffé J. Labouré A.-M. Kuntz M. Carol P. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). These enzymes catalyze diverse reactions but among them are found hydroxylases (MMO and toluene monooxygenase), as well as membrane-bound proteins with quinol binding sites (AOX and PTOX). Therefore, the presence of this di-iron motif in Coq7 strongly suggested to us that this protein would be a hydroxylase. To demonstrate that Coq7 is capable of the hydroxylation that converts DMQ to 5-hydroxyubiquinone, we cloned the COQ7 gene from the proteobacteria P. aeruginosa and T. ferrooxidans and constructed N-terminal fusions with MBP and/or TRX. These plasmids were introduced into E. coli JF496, which lacks UbiF, a protein unrelated to Coq7, but which catalyzes the conversion of DMQ to 5-hydroxyUQ inE. coli (12Kwon O. Kotsakis A. Meganathan R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 186: 157-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). UbiF has strong homology to E. coli UbiH and yeast Coq6, both of which are involved in a previous hydroxylation step in UQ biosynthesis and are predicted from sequence motifs to be flavin-containing monooxygenases (2Clarke C. Protoplasma. 2000; 213: 134-147Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 12Kwon O. Kotsakis A. Meganathan R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 186: 157-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AsubiF− E. coli contains an anaerobic hydroxylase activity that can bypass the ubiF lesion in UQ biosynthesis (24Alexander K. Young I.G. Biochem. 1978; 17: 4750-4755Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), care was taken to maintain the cultures in an aerobic condition. The results of the complementation assay on agar plates are shown in Table I. As expected, there was growth of all cells on the fermentable carbon source, glucose. When succinate replaced glucose, normal growth occurred only for those cells that contained the Coq7 fusion proteins; the empty host vectors expressing only MBP or TRX yielded barely visible colonies. Growth on succinate requires UQ as a substrate for succinate dehydrogenase; although DMQ is redox-active and can substitute for UQ with NADH dehydrogenase and the bacterial UQ oxidases, it is not a good substrate for succinate dehydrogenase (11Miyadera H. Amino H. Hiraishi A. Taka H. Murayama K. Miyoshi H. Sakamoto K. Ishii N. Hekimi S. Kita K. J. Biol.

Uninduced expression was sufficient to fully rescue aerobic respiration with all three fusions, MBP-Coq7 and TRX-Coq7 (P. aeruginosa) and TRX-Coq7 (T. ferrooxidans).Table IComplementation in E. coli JF496 with Coq7 from P. aeruginosa and T. ferrooxidansPlasmidProtein expressedMediumGlucoseSuccinateSuccinate + inducerpPaCOQ-MALc2MMBP-Coq7+++++++++++++++pPaCOQ-thioETRX-Coq7+++++++++++++++pTfCOQ-thioETRX-Coq7++++++++++++pHB-MALc2MMBP++++00pBAD/thioETRX++00Cells were plated on M9 agar with the following additions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” IPTG (0.1 mm) was used to induce the MBP-containing plasmids, and 0.1 mm arabinose was used to induce the TRX-containing plasmids.

Identification of DMQ8 and UQ8—To verify that the complementation of aerobic respiration occurred because of the synthesis of UQ, liquid cultures of ubiF−E. coli JF496 with and without the Coq7-encoding plasmid pPaCOQ-MALc2M were each harvested and extracted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” HPLC analysis with an electrochemical detector showed that the non-rescued ubiF−E. coli accumulates a large peak at 16.3 min (Fig.3 A). On the other hand,ubiF− E. coli expressing the MBP fusion of P. aeruginosa Coq7 shows a loss of the 16.3-min peak concomitant with the appearance of a peak at 18.2 min (Fig.3 C). Upon mass spectral analysis, the former lipid exhibited a molecular ion peak at m/z 696.4 (Fig.3 B) and could thus be identified as DMQ8(theoretical mass [C48H72O3] = 696.55) as shown previously by Young et al. (26Young I.G. McCann L.M. Stroobant P. Gibson F. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 105: 769-778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The more hydrophobic HPLC peak at 18.2 min showed a molecular ion atm/z 726.4 (Fig. 3 D) that corresponds to the theoretical mass of UQ8([C49H74O4] = 726.56). In accordance with the expectation that the endogenous E. coliUbiG immediately methylates the 5-hydroxyUQ product of Coq7 to UQ, the hydroxyl intermediate is not observed. Although the substrate for theP. aeruginosa Coq7 would normally be DMQ9, Fig.3 shows that this enzyme is able to utilize the DMQ8provided by E. coli. The high degree of structural conservation between the di-iron carboxylate proteins allows the modeling of even weakly homologous di-iron proteins with a reasonable level of confidence. Each of the known structures contains a four-helix bundle with a carboxylate ligand to the di-iron center located on each of the first and third helices and an EXXH motif providing iron ligands from each of the second and fourth helices. We have modeled P. aeruginosa Coq7 on the E. colibacterioferritin structure (19Frolow F. Kalb A.J. Yariv J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) using an alignment of Coq7 with theE. coli bacterioferritin and a probable bacterioferritin from P. aeruginosa that shows some homology to both proteins. In the resulting structural model (Fig.4), 14 of the 15 completely conserved residues in Coq7 cluster in a region surrounding the active site. The insertions in the S. cerevisiae Coq7 sequence (Fig. 2) fall in the loop regions of the model, as would be expected for conservation of the structure of the four-helix bundle. Coq7 has been shown to be an integral membrane protein in the mitochondrial inner membrane (28Jonassen T. Proft M. Randez-Gil F. Schultz J.R. Marbois B.N. Entian K.D. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3351-3357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and, as expected, in our expression of the two bacterial enzymes the protein is associated with the membrane fraction (data not shown). Hydropathy plots have identified a region between helix 2 and 3 that is consistently hydrophobic through Coq7 sequences, and previously it has been suggested that this region forms a transmembrane helix (28Jonassen T. Proft M. Randez-Gil F. Schultz J.R. Marbois B.N. Entian K.D. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3351-3357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, our structural model precludes this possibility, because two helices of the four-helix bundle (and their associated iron ligands) would fall on the opposite side of the membrane. Instead, we propose that Coq7 associates with the membrane as an interfacial integral membrane protein, similar to prostaglandin synthase (29Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar) and squalene cyclase (30Wendt K.U. Lenhart A. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 175-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In these proteins a “plateau” of hydrophobic residues interacts with one leaflet of the membrane bilayer. A rim of positively charged amino acids around this plateau is thought to interact with phospholipid head groups and stabilize the binding. The surface distribution of non-polar and charged amino acids in our model of Coq7 is consistent with this type of membrane association (Fig. 4 B). This mode of membrane binding has also been proposed in the di-iron carboxylate proteins AOX and PTOX (22Berthold D.A. Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1460: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 27Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The active site of the Coq7 model shows a typical di-iron center, with each Fe atom chelated by one histidine and one terminal carboxylate ligand (Fig. 4 C). Two glutamates, Glu94 and Glu178, bridge the Fe atoms. A cavity exists from the proposed membrane binding surface to the active site, which could allow access of DMQ to the Fe center from the lipid phase. This would allow the DMQ substrate to be located in the vicinity of the open coordination sites on the Fe where oxygen is bound and activated, as required for hydroxylation. In this model DMQ is positioned similar to Phe208 in RNR. Mutation of this Phe to a Tyr in RNR results in a suicide reaction in which this residue becomes hydroxylated (31Logan D.T. deMare F. Persson B.O. Slaby A. Sjöberg B.-M. Nordlund P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10798-10807Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Hydroxylation of the native Phe also occurs in RNR in the double mutant Y122F/E238A, where the Tyr122 is the site of the long-lived Tyr radical (31Logan D.T. deMare F. Persson B.O. Slaby A. Sjöberg B.-M. Nordlund P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10798-10807Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Two point mutations have been identified in COQ7 that inhibit UQ biosynthesis in their respective organisms. The point mutation E158K in C. elegans corresponds to Glu178 in P. aeruginosa (6Ewbank J.J. Barnes T.M. Lakowski B. Lussier M. Bussey H. Hekimi S. Science. 1997; 275: 980-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). This Glu is completely conserved and serves to bridge the two iron atoms of the di-iron center. Glu178 is essential for the formation of a stable di-iron site, and it would be expected that changing this position to a positively charged amino acid would disrupt the di-iron site and abolish activity. The S. cerevisiae mutation G104D corresponds to position Cys66 in the P. aeruginosa sequence (4Jonassen T. Marbois B.N. Kim L. Chin A. Xia Y.R. Lusis A.J. Clarke C.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cys66 is located between the iron ligand Glu64 and the completely conserved Ala67 in what we believe to be the DMQ binding pocket. It is not surprising that introducing a larger and negatively charged amino acid in this sensitive area of the protein would affect the activity. We have established that Coq7/clk-1 functions as a hydroxylase in the biosynthesis of ubiquinone. Future studies will now help to elucidate the structure-function relationship of this newly identified di-iron carboxylate protein.

We also acknowledge Gunvor Alvelius (Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden) and Gareth Williams (Micromass AB, Stockholm, Sweden) for the mass spectrometry."
https://openalex.org/W2169841941,"Galectins constitute a family of proteins that bind to β-galactoside residues and have diverse physiological functions. Here we report on the identification of a galectin-like molecule, galectin-12, in a human adipose tissue cDNA library. The protein contained two potential carbohydrate-recognition domains with the second carbohydrate-recognition domain being less conserved compared with other galectins. <i>In vitro</i> translated galectin-12 bound to a lactosyl-agarose column far less efficiently than galectin-8. Galectin-12 mRNA was predominantly expressed in adipose tissue of human and mouse and in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Caloric restriction and treatment of obese animals with troglitazone increased galectin-12 mRNA levels and decreased the average size of the cells in adipose tissue. The induction of galectin-12 expression by the thiazolidinedione, troglitazone, was paralleled by an increase in the number of apoptotic cells in adipose tissue. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that galectin-12 was localized in the nucleus of adipocytes, and transfection with galectin-12 cDNA induced apoptosis of COS-1 cells. These results suggest that galectin-12, an adipose-expressed galectin-like molecule, may participate in the apoptosis of adipocytes."

https://openalex.org/W2086992104,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a secreted, heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycan-binding protein that stimulates mitogenesis, motogenesis, and morphogenesis in a wide array of cellular targets, including hepatocytes and other epithelial cells, melanocytes, endothelial cells, and hematopoietic cells. NK1 is an alternative HGF isoform that consists of the N-terminal (N) and first kringle (K1) domains of full-length HGF and stimulates all major HGF biological activities. Within NK1, the N domain retains the HS binding properties of full-length HGF and mediates HS-stimulated ligand oligomerization but lacks significant mitogenic or motogenic activity. In contrast, K1 does not bind HS, but it stimulates receptor and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, mitogenesis, and motogenesis, demonstrating that structurally distinct and dissociable domains of HGF are the primary mediators of HS binding and receptor activation. Despite the absence of HS-K1 binding, K1 mitogenic activity in HS-negative cells is strictly dependent on added soluble heparin, whereas K1-stimulated motility is not. We also found that, like the receptors for fibroblast growth factors, the HGF receptor c-Met binds tightly to HS. These data suggest that HS can facilitate HGF signaling through interaction with c-Met that is independent of HGF-HS interaction and that the recruitment of specific intracellular effectors that mediate distinct HGF responses such as mitogenesis and motility is regulated by HS-c-Met interaction at the cell surface.

HGF shares several structural motifs and 38% amino acid sequence identity with plasminogen (2Nakamura T. Nishizawa T. Hagiya M. Seki T. Shimonishi M. Sugimura A. Tashiro K. Shimizu S.

Each is synthesized as a single polypeptide chain that is cleaved at a conserved site to generate a biologically active, disulfide-linked heterodimer (4Gak E. Taylor W.G. Chan A.M. Rubin J.S.

Chem. 1992; 267: 20114-20119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The heavy chain of the dimer (∼60 kDa in HGF) is derived from the N terminus of the precursor and contains multiple kringle domains (K) (four in HGF, five in plasminogen). Kringle domains (∼80 amino acids) have a characteristic folding pattern determined by three internal disulfide bonds and additional conserved sequences (7Patthy L. Trexler M. Vali Z. Banyai L. Varadi A. FEBS Lett. 1984; 171: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The HGF light chain (∼34 kDa), like that of plasminogen, has the structure of a serine protease, but two nonconservative substitutions within the catalytic triad render HGF devoid of proteolytic activity (2Nakamura T. Nishizawa T. Hagiya M. Seki T. Shimonishi M. Sugimura A. Tashiro K. Shimizu S. Nature. 1989; 342: 440-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1979) Google Scholar). The HGF gene encodes three distinct proteins: full-length HGF and two truncated HGF isoforms (NK1 and NK2) that consist of the N-terminal domain (N) linked in tandem with the first one (K1) or two (K1+K2) kringle domains, respectively (Fig. 1). NK1 appears to stimulate all of the biological activities of full-length HGF, whereas NK2 retains only motogenic activity (8Montesano R. Soriano J.V. Malinda K.M. Ponce M.L. Bafico A. Kleinman H.K.

All three isoforms bind to the HGF receptor c-Met, and NK2 appears to specifically activate a subset of the c-Met intracellular signaling pathways activated by HGF or NK1 binding (11Day R.M. Cioce V. Breckenridge D. Castagnino P. Bottaro D.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3399-3406Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). HGF, NK1, and NK2, expressed in Escherichia coli, are misfolded and inactive, but controlled refolding of NK1 and NK2 resulted in complete reconstitution of their biological activities (9Stahl S.J. Wingfield P.T. Kaufman J.D. Pannell L.K. Cioce V. Sakata H. Taylor W.G. Rubin J.S. Bottaro D.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Prokaryotic expression and refolding also facilitated the biological characterization of the HGF N domain. N retains the heparin binding properties of full-length HGF, and experiments performed with wild-type and HS-deficient CHO cells revealed that HS was essential for c-Met-NK1 interaction (12Sakata H.

Addition of heparin (a commercially available, commonly used substitute for HS glycosaminoglycans) to HS-deficient CHO cells not only restored ligand binding, but it also increased ligand-dependent c-Met activation and c-fosexpression (12Sakata H.

These studies suggested that HS facilitated ligand oligomerization through interaction with the N domain and thereby enhanced receptor activation. Using prokaryotically expressed and refolded protein, the three-dimensional solution structure of the HGF N domain was solved (13Zhou H. Mazzulla M.J. Kaufman J.D. Stahl S.J. Wingfield P.T.

The topology of the N-domain structure is unusual; the only similar structure found so far is the HS binding domain of vascular endothelial cell growth factor (14Fairbrother W.J.

Analysis of the surface charge distribution of N-domain, and extensive characterization of HS-N domain interaction using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy have led to the identification of the HS binding site (13Zhou H.

Recently, the crystal structure of NK1 was solved, revealing a dimer with only a few contacts between the N and K1 domains of each NK1 monomer; the dimer interface was composed of contacts between the linker peptides joining N and K1 (16Chirgadze D.Y.

This structural arrangement suggests that some degree of flexibility exists between N and K1, as well as some independence in their interactions with HS and c-Met. Recombinant, refolded HGF K1 (residues 123–210) has also been expressed in bacteria, and circular dichroism studies revealed that its overall conformation is indistinguishable from the K1 domain of biologically active, intact NK1 (9Stahl S.J. Wingfield P.T. Kaufman J.D. Pannell L.K. Cioce V. Sakata H. Taylor W.G. Rubin J.S. Bottaro D.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Unlike N domain, K1 was not retained by immobilized heparin and did not self-associate to form cross-linkable oligomers in solution in the absence or presence of heparin (12Sakata H. Stahl S.J.

Here, we report the biological properties of the isolated K1 domain: at concentrations of 30 nm or more, K1 stimulates receptor tyrosine kinase activation, MAP kinase activation, cell scatter, and DNA synthesis in HGF-responsive epithelial cells. Thus, structurally distinct domains of HGF appear to be the primary mediators of heparin binding and receptor activation. We also examined signaling by K1 in 32D/c-Met cells, which lack cell surface HS. In that system, added heparin facilitates HGF signaling (11Day R.M. Cioce V. Breckenridge D. Castagnino P. Bottaro D.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3399-3406Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), through a mechanism that was presumed to involve its demonstrated ability to enhance HGF oligomerization (12Sakata H.

Despite its inability to bind heparin, we found that K1 mitogenic signaling in 32D/c-Met cells was completely heparin-dependent. These results suggested that HS may facilitate HGF signaling through a mechanism other than HGF-HS binding, such as a direct HS-c-Met interaction. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling has been shown to require not only the well characterized FGF-HS binding (20DiGabriele A.D. Lax I. Chen D.I. Svahn C.M. Jaye M. Schlessinger J.

Science. 1993; 259: 1918-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Crystallographic analysis of FGF-FGF receptor interaction also supports a model in which HS binds to both ligand and receptor (24Plotnikov A.N. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Mohammadi M. Cell. 1999; 98: 641-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Interestingly, c-Met shared several properties with other well studied heparin-binding proteins, and a comparison of the HS binding properties of a c-Met-Fc fusion protein and the HGF isoform NK1 confirmed the existence of a HS binding site(s) within the extracellular domain of the receptor. In contrast to K1-stimulated proliferation, K1-stimulated cell motility was completely HS-independent in the same HS-negative cell line. Together, these results suggest that HS facilitates HGF signaling through interactions with both HGF and c-Met and that the recruitment of intracellular effectors that mediate distinct cellular responses is regulated by HS-c-Met interaction at the cell surface. Rabbit polyclonal anti-human and anti-mouse c-Met antibodies (C-28 and C20, respectively) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Mouse monoclonal antibodies to phosphotyrosine (4G10) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Rabbit polyclonal phospho-specific antibodies to MAP kinase were purchased from New England Biolabs. Full-length human recombinant HGF was generously provided by Dr. George Vande Woude. Recombinant EGF, IGF-1, and fibronectin were obtained from Collaborative Research. Heparin and chondroitin sulfate were obtained from Sigma; purified biotinylated and unlabeled HS were obtained from Neoparin; and purified unlabeled HS was also obtained from Calbiochem (molecular mass, 5 kDa) and from Seikagaku. The recombinant human HGF isoforms NK1, N domain, and K1 proteins were generated using a bacterial expression system and then purified and refolded as previously described (9Stahl S.J. Wingfield P.T.

Recombinant c-Met-Fc, consisting of the human c-Met extracellular domain fused in-frame to a human IgG Fc fragment, was prepared as described previously (25Mark M.R. Lokker N.A. Zioncheck T.F.

Murine interleukin 3-dependent 32D/c-Met cells were generated as previously described and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium + 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% WEHI-3B conditioned medium as a source of interleukin 3 (11Day R.M.

Okajima cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium +10% fetal bovine serum. Mitogenic assays were performed using Balb/MK, 184B5, or 32D/c-Met cells as previously described (26Rubin J.S. Osada H. Finch P.W. Taylor W.G. Rudikoff S. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Briefly, cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 24–48 h (Balb/MK and 184B5) or 4 h (32D/c-Met) before the addition of growth factors for 16 h (Balb/MK and 184B5) or 36 h (32D/c-Met). In assays on Balb/MK cells, IGF-1 (100 ng/ml) was added to all wells except the blank; IGF-1 alone has no significant mitogenic activity in this cell line, but it strongly potentiates mitogenic signals from most epithelial cell growth factors (30Falco J.P. Taylor W.G. Di F.P. Weissman B.E. Aaronson S.A. Oncogene. 1988; 2: 573-578PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with [3H]thymidine for 6 h, and acid-insoluble material was extracted. Incorporation of [3H]thymidine was determined by liquid scintillation counting. MDCK cell scatter, observed as the dispersion of single cells from tightly grouped colonies, was assayed as described previously (31Stoker M. Gherardi E. Perryman M. Gray J. Nature. 1987; 327: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). Treatments were made over several serial dilutions, and cell scatter was observed by light microscopy of fixed and stained cells. 32D/c-Met cell migration was assayed using a modified Boyden chamber with 5-µm pore size Nucleopore filters (Corning) as described previously (32Uren A., Yu, J.C. Gholami N.S. Pierce J.H. Heidaran M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 628-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Growth factors were added to the lower chamber, and cells washed in serum-free medium were applied to the upper chamber (final density, 2 × 106 cells/ml) and incubated for 7 h at 37 °C. The number of cells migrating to the lower chamber was counted using a Coulter counter. Values shown are the mean ± S.D. of triplicate samples for each treatment. For anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-Tyr(P)) and anti-active MAP kinase immunoblot experiments, cells were serum-deprived for 16 h (Balb/MK and 184B5) or 4 h (32D/c-Met) prior to growth factor treatment at 37 °C. Anti-phospho-MAP kinase and anti-c-Met immunoblotting were performed on cell lysates after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretic transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Anti-Tyr(P) immunoblotting was performed after lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-c-Met as described previously (11Day R.M. Cioce V. Breckenridge D. Castagnino P. Bottaro D.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3399-3406Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were extracted in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mmNaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 µg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin), and the lysates were cleared by centrifugation. Equal amounts of protein were immunoprecipitated with antiserum and GammaBind Plus Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and detected by primary and secondary antibodies followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL,Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To control for variations in gel loading, identically prepared immunoblots were probed with anti-c-Met followed by chemiluminescence detection. For c-Met affinity immobilization experiments, c-Met was extracted from Okajima cells using ice-cold lysis buffer, and extracts were cleared by brief centrifugation at 4 °C. Affinity immobilization on heparin-Sepharose or unmodified Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was performed as described for immunoprecipitation of c-Met. Heparin-Sepharose-immobilized c-Met was washed five times in 300 volumes of cold lysis buffer before displacement with NaCl, soluble heparin or chondroitin sulfate. The amount of c-Met remaining immobilized throughout this treatment was visualized after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with anti-c-Met as described above. Purified NK1 (10 µg/ml, 50 µl), c-Met-Fc, or K1 (15 µg/ml; 50 µl) were added to a 96-well plate for 2 h (all incubations were at room temperature). Wells were decanted, blocked with carrier solution (4% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline + NaN3) for 1 h, washed five times with TAPS (0.05% Tween 20 + 0.02% NaN3 in phosphate-buffered saline), and then incubated with biotin-HS (Neoparin) for 2 h. The wells were washed, incubated for 1 h with streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (1 µg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline), washed again, and incubated with p-nitrophenyl phosphate (2 mg/ml in 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1m Na2CO3, pH 9.8) before measuring absorbance at 405 nm. For saturation binding experiments, serial dilutions of biotin-HS were added to wells in the presence or absence of 100-fold excess unlabeled HS (Neoparin); for competitive binding experiments, various concentrations of unlabeled HS (Neoparin, Calbiochem, or Seikagaku) was added with a single concentration of HS-biotin. The ability of recombinant, prokaryotically expressed and refolded HGF K1 (residues 123–210) to stimulate DNA synthesis in Balb/MK keratinocytes was compared with that of full-length HGF, NK1, and N domain (Fig.2). K1 mitogenic stimulation was dose-dependent and 100-fold less potent than that observed in response to NK1 (50% maximum at 3 µg/ml versus 30 ng/ml; Fig. 2 A and data not shown). Interestingly, high doses of K1 were capable of stimulating the same maximum level of DNA synthesis as full-length HGF, whereas N-domain was relatively inactive under the same conditions (Fig. 2 B). The effect of treatment of Balb/MK cells with both K1 and N domains simultaneously was similar to the effects of K1 alone, demonstrating that the potency of NK1 or HGF could not be reconstituted by its non-covalently bound components (Fig. 2 B and data not shown). K1 activated the HGF receptor tyrosine kinase, c-Met, in Balb/MK cells, although the kinetics of receptor activation appeared to be modestly delayed relative to activation stimulated by full-length HGF or by NK1 (Fig. 3A). These results are consistent with a direct interaction between K1 and the HGF receptor that is of lower affinity than receptor interaction with HGF or NK1. Under identical conditions, little or no receptor activation was stimulated by N domain (Fig. 3 A). Similarly, K1 stimulated MAP kinase activation, whereas N domain did not (Fig. 3 B). Consistent with their relative abilities to stimulate DNA synthesis and c-Met activation, K1 stimulated MAP kinase activation less potently than NK1 or HGF (Fig. 3 B). N and K1 added together had no greater effect on MAP kinase activation than K1 alone (Fig.3 B). The relative abilities of N and K1 to stimulate cell migration were compared using two different cellular targets and assay systems: MDCK cell scatter (31Stoker M. Gherardi E. Perryman M. Gray J. Nature. 1987; 327: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar) and 32D/c-Met cell migration across a semipermeable barrier (11Day R.M. Cioce V. Breckenridge D. Castagnino P. Bottaro D.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3399-3406Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, high doses of K1 stimulated MDCK cell scatter similar to that observed following NK1 treatment, whereas under the same conditions, N domain had no obvious effect relative to untreated controls. The potency of K1 in the MDCK cell scatter assay was ∼30-fold lower than that of NK1, consistent with the suspected lower affinity of K1-c-Met interaction. The murine interleukin 3-dependent hematopoietic cell line 32D expresses a very low level of c-Met and responds poorly to stimulation with human HGF. Ectopic expression of human c-Met in 32D cells (32D/c-Met) at levels similar to normal human epithelial cells reconstitutes potent human HGF signaling (11Day R.M. Cioce V. Breckenridge D. Castagnino P. Bottaro D.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3399-3406Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Anchorage-independent 32D/c-Met cells traverse semipermeable membranes in response to HGF and NK2 (11Day R.M. Cioce V. Breckenridge D. Castagnino P. Bottaro D.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3399-3406Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and this system was also used to compare cell migration responses to NK1, K1, and N (Fig. 5). In this system, K1 was only marginally less potent than NK1, whereas the effects of N domain were not significant (Fig. 5). The relative potency of K1 and NK1 parallels earlier observations made with this system, where NK2 and HGF showed similar potency in stimulating 32D/c-Met cell migration; in contrast, HGF was 10–30-fold more potent than NK2 in stimulating epithelial cell migration (11Day R.M. Cioce V. Breckenridge D. Castagnino P. Bottaro D.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3399-3406Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Another feature of the 32D/c-Met cell system is that it lacks abundant cell surface HS. Thus, like other HS-deficient cell types, added soluble heparin can enhance signaling by HS-binding ligands (12Sakata H. Stahl S.J. Taylor W.G. Rosenberg J.M. Sakaguchi K. Wingfield P.T. Rubin J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9457-9463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 19Schwall R.H. Chang L.Y. Godowski P.J. Kahn D.W. Hillan K.J. Bauer K.D. Zioncheck T.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 709-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The potency of HGF in stimulating DNA synthesis by 32D-c-Met cells was increased at least 3-fold in the presence of added soluble heparin (11Day R.M. Cioce V. Breckenridge D. Castagnino P. Bottaro D.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3399-3406Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) (Fig.6B). Similar results were obtained using NK1 (data not shown). We examined K1-stimulated mitogenic activity in 32D/c-Met cells with the expectation that it would be HS-independent, in keeping with the lack of heparin binding by isolated K1. However, initial experiments suggested that K1 alone had little activity in this system, so K1 was tested over a wide range of added heparin concentrations (Fig. 6 A). Whereas K1 activity was barely detectable in the absence of heparin, [3H]thymidine incorporation rose dramatically with increasing heparin concentrations (Fig. 6). Heparin alone was not mitogenic at any concentration tested (Fig. 6 A). Heparin concentrations of 30 µg/ml or higher maximally promoted K1 signaling, and this heparin concentration was used to test the dose-responsiveness of K1 mitogenic activity in this system (Fig. 6 B). In the presence of added heparin K1 was ∼10-fold less potent than HGF without heparin and 30-fold less potent than HGF with heparin (Fig. 6 B). At a concentration of 3 µg/ml, K1 reached ∼75% of the maximum level of HGF-stimulated DNA synthesis (Fig.6 B). Heparin is thought to facilitate signaling by heparin-binding ligands during early events such as receptor-ligand interaction and receptor activation. Therefore, we examined the effects of added heparin on the ability of K1 to stimulate c-Met autophosphorylation in intact 32D/c-Met cells. We found that the effect of added heparin was apparent within 5 min of K1 addition (Fig. 7). In the absence of added heparin, K1-stimulated receptor kinase activation was not detected, although it was observed after treatment with full-length HGF or NK1 (Fig. 7). In the presence of added heparin, c-Met activation by K1 was clearly observed, strongly suggesting that heparin acted by facilitating ligand-receptor interaction. N domain did not appear to stimulate receptor activation with or without added heparin, and heparin alone also had no effect (Fig. 7). The role of HS in signaling by heparin-binding growth factors has been extensively characterized for members of the FGF family, particularly FGF-1 and FGF-2. For FGFs, HS has been shown to directly facilitate ligand signaling in at least two ways: 1) ligand-HS interaction, which facilitates ligand dimerization (and in turn promotes receptor dimerization) and transactivation (33Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 84: 49-71PubMed Google Scholar, 34Weiss A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1998; 94: 277-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), and 2) receptor-HS interaction, which facilitates ligand-receptor interaction and consequently receptor activation (23Kan M. Wang F. Xu J. Crabb J.W. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Science. 1993; 259: 1918-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 35Kan M. Wang F. To B. Gabriel J.L. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26143-26148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). As K1 does not bind heparin, we examined whether heparin facilitated K1 signaling through direct and ligand-independent interaction with c-Met. A preliminary analysis of c-Met-heparin interaction was performed using lysates prepared from Okajima cells, a gastric carcinoma cell line characterized by overexpression of the c-Met receptor protein (36Motoyama T.

Although there are a number of biochemical studies of each class of remodeler, there are very little data directly comparing the biochemical activities of remodelers from different classes. We have purified two ATP-hydrolyzing proteins, SNF2H and BRG1, which are members of complexes from two different classes of remodelers. Consistent with previous reports, these two homogeneous proteins can perform remodeling functions. We show significant functional differences between SNF2H and BRG1 in vitro; although both SNF2H and BRG1 hydrolyze ATP and remodel linear arrays of nucleosomes, only BRG1 can remodel mononucleosomes. Also, only BRG1 can alter the topology of nucleosomal plasmids. We propose that these functional differences reflect significant mechanistic differences between the two remodeler classes that will impact their biological roles.

The assembly of eukaryotic DNA into nucleosomes, necessary for packing the DNA into the nucleus, has a generally repressive effect on gene transcription.

These complexes or the genes encoding their constituent proteins have been found in every eukaryote that has been studied, suggesting that they are necessary for normal cell function. Furthermore, genetic analyses have identified a number of promoters in yeast, Drosophila, and human cells that are dependent on specific remodeling complexes or proteins for their normal regulation (11Stern M. Jensen R. Herskowitz I. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 178: 853-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 12Sudarsanam P. Cao Y. Wu L. Laurent B.C. Winston F.

The remodeling complexes identified to date can be roughly grouped into three classes, the SWI·SNF complexes, the ISWI complexes, and the CHD complexes. These three classes differ in size and subunit composition. The three classes of proteins also appear to differ in their biochemical activities; although all three complexes appear to alter chromatin structure to increase the accessibility of regulatory sequences within promoters, the physical changes underlying the increased accessibility appear to differ in each case. In some cases, chromatin remodeling appears to involve the re-positioning of otherwise intact histone octamers (14Nacheva G.A. Guschin D.Y. Preobrazhenskaya O.V. Karpov V.L. Ebrailidse K.K. Mirzabekov A.D. Cell. 1989; 58: 27-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 15Rougvie A.E. Lis J.T. Cell. 1988; 54: 795-804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar); other remodeling events appear to change the conformation of specific nucleosomes without significantly displacing them (16Cosma M.P. Tanaka T. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1999; 97: 299-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 17Krebs J. Kuo M. Allis C. Peterson C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1412-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Importantly, there is very little data directly comparing the biochemical functions of remodelers from different classes. This sort of information is critical in determining the products of each remodeling event, the mechanisms of the different remodeling complexes, and possibly the biological roles of different remodelers. The SWI·SNF complexes contain between 8 and 16 distinct proteins and have molecular masses of ∼2 MDa. Each member of the SWI·SNF complex family contains a member of the SWI2/SNF2 family of ATPase domain-containing genes. The SWI2/SNF2 proteins are all ∼200 kDa in size and are all highly homologous. In addition to their ATPase domains, the SWI2/SNF2 genes contain a bromo-domain: the bromo-domain is found in a variety of chromatin-related genes and can bind acetylated histones (18Jeanmougin F. Wurtz J.M. Le Douarin B. Chambon P. Losson R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 151-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). One member of the SWI2/SNF2 family, the human gene Brahma-related Gene One (BRG1) was expressed and purified as a homogeneous protein; when assayed in vitro, BRG1 could perform all of the functions of the human SWI·SNF complexes, albeit with a lower specific activity (19Phelan M.L. Sif S. Narlikar G.J. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 247-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). These functions include the alteration of nuclease sensitivity on both mononucleosomes and linear arrays of nucleosomes (8Imbalzano A.N. Kwon H. Green M.R. Kingston R.E.

The addition of other SWI·SNF subunits greatly increased the specific activity of BRG1 in vitro; the other subunits are also likely to be involved in the regulation of SWI·SNF activity. The ISWI complexes contain between 2 and 6 proteins and have molecular weights between 200 and 700 kDa. Each ISWI complex contains an ATPase protein from the ISWI gene family (27Eisen J.A. Sweder K.S. Hanawalt P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2715-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). The ISWI proteins (named for the first family member to be characterized, the Drosophilagene Imitation Switch or ISWI (28Elfring L.K. Deuring R. McCallum C.M. Peterson C.L. Tamkun J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2225-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar)) are ∼130 kDa in size. The ISWI family ATPase domains are very similar to the ATPase domains of the SWI2/SNF2 proteins, but the two gene families are not significantly related outside of the ATPase domain. The ISWI gene product was, like BRG1, purified as a homogeneous protein and could perform many of the functions of ISWI-containing complexes in vitro (29Corona D.F. Langst G. Clapier C.R. Bonte E.J. Ferrari S. Tamkun J.W. Becker P.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 239-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). These functions include the assembly of nucleosomes (30Ito T.

Cell. 1999; 97: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), and ATP hydrolysis, stimulated by nucleosomes but not by naked DNA (2Tsukiyama T. Wu C. Cell. 1995; 83: 1011-1020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar,33Georgel P.T. Tsukiyama T. Wu C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4717-4726Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). As with BRG1, the specific activity of ISWI could be significantly increased by adding another subunit of an ISWI complex, theDrosophila protein ACF1 (30Ito T. Levenstein M. Fyodorov D. Kutach A. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1529-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The other subunits are also likely to have regulatory roles. Previous work had hinted at major functional differences between the SWI·SNF complexes and the ISWI complexes. In particular, the ATPase data showed a significant difference in substrate specificity (19Phelan M.L. Sif S. Narlikar G.J. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 247-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 29Corona D.F. Langst G. Clapier C.R. Bonte E.J. Ferrari S. Tamkun J.W. Becker P.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 239-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar,33Georgel P.T. Tsukiyama T. Wu C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4717-4726Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Comparisons between the two complex families were difficult, however, as there was very little data directly comparing the different complexes in the same assay systems. To better compare the biochemical functions of the SWI·SNF and ISWI families, we purified BRG1 and a human ISWI homolog, SNF2 homolog (SNF2H) as homogeneous proteins and showed that both proteins were active in vitro. We then compared the two proteins in a panel of quantifiable remodeling assays. This allowed us to directly compare the specific activity of each protein in these assays. We found that both BRG1 and SNF2H were active in ATP hydrolysis and that both could remodel linear arrays of nucleosomes with similar efficiency. SNF2H, however, was at least an order of magnitude less active than BRG1 when mononucleosomes were tested as a remodeling substrate. SNF2H did not alter the topology of circular plasmids assembled into nucleosomal arrays, whereas BRG1 had high activity. These functional differences between SNF2H and BRG1 are likely to reflect differences in the mechanisms by which each protein alters chromatin structure, and these differences between the two classes of remodelers may help to delineate their biological roles in gene regulation. The SNF2H (SMARCA5) clone (34Aihara T. Miyoshi Y. Koyama K. Suzuki M. Takahashi E. Monden M. Nakamura Y. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1998; 81: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. T. Aihara. The clone was in two pieces, SNF2H-A (nucleotides 188–3088) and SNF2H-B (nucleotides 2420–3606). To introduce a C-terminal FLAG epitope, SNF2H was subcloned into pFastBac1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) in three steps. First, the HindIII site was removed from the pFastBac1 MCS by cutting and digesting with mung bean nuclease. Then, the BamHI/XbaI fragment from SNF2H-A (nucleotides 188–3088) was cloned into theBamHI/XbaI sites of pFastBacI. The C terminus of SNF2H (from pSNF2H-B) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction to introduce the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) immediately before the stop codon; also, an XbaI site was introduced 3′ of the stop codon. The SNF2H-B polymerase chain reaction product was cut withHindIII (within the SNF2H coding region) and XbaI and cloned into pFastBac1::SNF2H-A digested withHindIII and XbaI. BRG1 was detected with the anti-BRG1(unique) antibody, described previously (35Imbalzano A.N. Schnitzler G.R. Kingston R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20726-20733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). SNF2H was detected with the anti-SNF2L antibody raised against amino acids 1–150 of the SNF2H homolog SNF2L (SNF2L amino acids 1–150 are highly conserved in SNF2H (amino acids 75–224); the antiserum recognizes both proteins (51Aalfs J A Biochemical Comparison of the Human ATP-dependent Nucleosome Remodeling Proteins SNF2 Homolog, SNF2-like, and Brahma-related Gene One.Ph.D. thesis. Harvard University, Cambridge, MA2001Google Scholar)). The proteins were immunoprecipitated using M2-agarose (Sigma) and detected using the Oct-A (anti-FLAG) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). BRG1 was purified as described previously (19Phelan M.L. Sif S. Narlikar G.J. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 247-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). SNF2H was purified following the same protocol. Briefly, Sf9 cells were transfected with pFastBac1::SNF2H(FLAG), and the supernatant was collected after 48 h. The supernatant, containing SNF2H-encoding baculovirus, was then used to infect more Sf9 cells to amplify the virus. To express the protein, Sf9 cells were grown in 1L spinner flasks to log phase (1 × 106 cells/ml) and then infected with SNF2H baculovirus at a ratio of ∼10 colony-forming units/cell (multiplicity of infection = 10). Infected cells were incubated for 38 h at 27 °C, then nuclear extracts were made following standard techniques (36Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). After extraction, extracts were dialyzed into BC-100 (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol) with 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 ng/μl pepstatin A, and 0.5 ng/μl leupeptin. SNF2H-containing nuclear extracts were purified by M2-agarose chromatography (37Sif S. Stukenberg P.T. Kirschner M.W. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2842-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Extract and beads were incubated in batches for 12 h at 4 °C then poured onto a column and washed with BC-100, BC-300, BC-500, BC-800, BC-1000, and BC-100. The protein was then eluted by adding BC-100 with 1 mg/ml FLAG peptide and incubating for 30–60 min at 4 °C. Peak fractions were diluted to 50 ng/μl in BC-100 containing 500 ng/μl bovine serum albumin, separated into aliquots, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until use (bovine serum albumin alone had no activity in any remodeling assay). Proteins were identified by Western blots using antibodies against SNF2H, BRG1, and the FLAG epitope and quantitated by Bradford assays (Bio-Rad) and Coomassie staining against standards. As an additional purification step, SNF2H from the M2 column (not diluted with bovine serum albumin) was layered onto a 5–30% glycerol gradient (glycerol gradient buffer: 50 mm Tris pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 5 or 30% glycerol) and spun at 35,000 rpm (150,000 × g) in a SW-55 rotor (Beckman Instruments) for 16 h. Thirty 6-drop fractions were collected, and each fraction was assayed for protein concentration and activity. All mononucleosomes used here were made using the TPT MluI-EcoRI fragment described previously (25Schnitzler G. Sif S. Kingston R.E. Cell. 1998; 94: 17-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). To make end-labeled nucleosomes, the MluI end was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow fragment. Body-labeled TPT was made by polymerase chain reaction containing [α-32P]dCTP. End-labeled and body-labeled mononucleosomes were assembled by serial dilution from 2m to 200 mm NaCl or by octamer transfer. Unlabeled mononucleosomes were assembled by salt gradient dialysis. Unlabeled TPT was produced in a large scale polymerase chain reaction and assembled using a salt gradient dialysis technique. DNA and histones were mixed at a 1:1 ratio, each at a concentration of 0.7 mg/ml in high salt buffer (20 mm Tris pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mKCl). The reaction was transferred into dialysis tubing (molecular mass = 12–14 kDa) and dialyzed at 4 °C against high salt buffer. Dialysis continued for 60 h, with the high salt buffer exchanged for low salt buffer (same as high salt buffer, with 0.25 m KCl) at a rate of 12 to 13 ml/hr. After dialysis, nucleosomes were purified by glycerol gradient centrifugation over a 5–30% gradient, 16 h × 35,000 rpm (150,000 ×g) in a SW-55 rotor (Beckman Instruments). Nucleosomes were quantitated by 5% native acrylamide gel electrophoresis against bare DNA standards of known concentration. The G5E4 array (38Steger D.J. Eberharter A. John S. Grant P.A. Workman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12924-12929Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), a kind gift of Dr. J. L. Workman, was end-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow fill-in. Labeled array and HeLa histones, each at a concentration of ∼100 μg/ml, were used to assemble chromatin arrays in the same salt gradient dialysis procedure used for mononucleosomes (described above). Measurement of ATP hydrolysis activity was carried out in 10-μl reactions under the following conditions: 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 4 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.44 mm EDTA, 60 mm KCl, 4–10% glycerol, 4 mm MgCl2, and 2 μm to 1.5 mm ATP·Mg2+ (23Guyon J.R. Narlikar G.J. Sif S. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2088-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). All components were pre-warmed to 30 °C, and the reactions were started by adding the equimolar ATP·Mg2+ mixture to the rest of the reaction. At the indicated times after addition, 2-μl aliquots were removed from each reaction and quenched in 5 μl of stop buffer (3% SDS, 100 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5). Phosphate and ATP were separated by thin layer chromatography on cellulose plates (J. T. Baker Inc.) that were pre-run with water and dried. TLC was carried out in 1 m formic acid, 0.5 m LiCl. Plates were dried then visualized and quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Reaction rates were determined using least-squares fits to the time points (Kaleidagraph). The restriction enzyme assays were carried out in 25- or 50-μl reactions under the following conditions: 15.6 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm Tris pH 7.5, 0.36 mm EDTA, 60 mm KCl, 6% glycerol, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, and 3.5 mm MgCl2. Where indicated, 0.5 mm ATP was added to reactions. The array was added at concentrations of ∼0.12 nm; the mononucleosomes were added at concentrations of 0.1 nm. In all experiments, the restriction enzymes were added at 0.4–0.8 units/μl. Reactions were pre-warmed to 30 °C and started by adding the substrate to the other components. At specified time points, 6- or 12-μl aliquots were removed and quenched with stop buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 mmEDTA, 25% glycerol, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5). Cut and uncut DNA were separated on 1% agarose gels run in 1× Tris acetate-EDTA buffer. Gels were visualized and quantitated on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Reaction rates were determined by fitting the time points to an exponential function [S] = [S]i e−kt, where [S]i is the initial substrate concentration, and kis the rate of the reaction; the equation was corrected for the endpoint of each reaction. The DNaseI accessibility assay was carried out by incubating nucleosomes containing end-labeled TPT at a concentration of ∼3 nm, with remodelers at the indicated concentrations under the conditions listed in the restriction enzyme accessibility assays. The reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C and then cooled to room temperature for 5 min. DNase I was added to each reaction: 0.4 units/reaction for nucleosomes, 0.04 units/reaction for bare DNA. Digestion proceeded for 2 min at room temperature and was stopped by adding 2 μl of 0.5 m EDTA with 73 μl of water. Samples were phenol-extracted, precipitated, and resuspended in 95% formamide loading buffer. Samples were separated on an 8% acrylamide-urea gel and visualized by autoradiography. Gel shift assays were carried out in the same method as DNase I assays; however, after 30 min at 30 °C, 250 ng of cold DNA was added to compete the remodelers away from the nucleosomes. Samples were incubated for 4 min at 30 °C, then loaded onto a 5% acrylamide, 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA gel. After electrophoresis for 3 h at 100 V, the gel was dried and visualized on a PhosphorImager. PUC19 was linearized, de-phosphorylated, labeled with 32P, and re-ligated as described previously (23Guyon J.R. Narlikar G.J. Sif S. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2088-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Circular, labeled plasmid was assembled with HeLa histones at a mass:mass ratio of ∼4:1 (histones:DNA) using Xenopusheat-treated egg extract for 90 min at 30 °C (39Workman J.L. Taylor I.C. Kingston R.E. Roeder R.G. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 35: 419-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Assembled plasmid was isolated by centrifugation on a 10–40% glycerol gradient, 16 h × 35,000 rpm (150,000 × g) in a SW-55 rotor (Beckman Instruments). The resulting chromatin was used at a concentration of ∼0.1 nm in 25-μl reactions under the same conditions as the restriction enzyme assays, with the exception that topoisomerase I (Promega) was present at 0.08 units/μl. Reactions were incubated for 90 min at 30 °C, then stopped by adding 3 μl of stop buffer (130 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 217 mm EDTA, 4.3% SDS). 20 μg of proteinase K was added to each reaction and digested for 30 min at 55 °C. The reactions were then separated by 1× Tris borate-EDTA electrophoresis on a 1.1% agarose gel and visualized on film. SNF2H has been purified as part of several nucleosome-remodeling complexes (40LeRoy G. Orphanides G. Lane W.S. Reinberg D.

Nature. 1994; 370: 481-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 44Wang W. Xue Y. Zhou S. Kuo A. Cairns B.R. Crabtree G.R.

Tamkun J.W. Development. 1998; 125: 3955-3966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and perhaps to the yeast SWI·SNF complex (45Cairns B.R. Kim Y.-J. Sayre M.H. Laurent B.C. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1950-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to their close sequence similarity to the ISWI and SWI2/SNF2 genes, SNF2H and BRG1 also appear to represent the central ATPases of two functionally distinct families of nucleosome remodeling activities. To begin to understand the mechanisms by which these two classes function, we purified and characterized SNF2H and BRG1. We added a FLAG epitope tag to SNF2H and created a baculovirus to express the FLAG-tagged SNF2H in Sf9 insect cells. Nuclear extracts were made and fractionated by M2 (anti-FLAG antibody) affinity chromatography. This one-step purification yielded highly purified SNF2H (Fig. 1 A) we estimate our protein fractions to be >90% pure. BRG1 was expressed and purified by similar methods, as previously described (Fig.1 B; Phelan et al. (19Phelan M.L. Sif S. Narlikar G.J. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 247-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar)). The BRG1 was also highly purified; we estimate our fractions to be >70% pure, and many of the smaller proteins are breakdown products of the full-length protein as judged by Western analysis (data not shown). Previous work had shown that BRG1 purified in this manner was active in a variety of remodeling assays and that these activities were not impacted by any trace contaminants (20Phelan M.L. Schnitzler G.R. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6380-6389Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We used these fractions throughout this study. Previous work shows that the ATP hydrolysis activity of ISWI was stimulated by nucleosomes but not by naked DNA (33Georgel P.T. Tsukiyama T. Wu C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4717-4726Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), whereas the ATPase activity of BRG1 could be stimulated by either nucleosomes or naked DNA (9Cote J. Quinn J. Workman J.L. Peterson C.L. Science. 1994; 265: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 19Phelan M.L. Sif S. Narlikar G.J. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 247-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Based on the sequence similarity of SNF2H and ISWI, we expected SNF2H ATPase activity to be stimulated by nucleosomes but not by DNA. We incubated SNF2H and BRG1 with ATP while adding the indicated amounts of nucleosomes and measured the rate of each reaction. Both SNF2H and BRG1 demonstrated an ATP-hydrolyzing activity that was stimulated by nucleosomes (Fig. 2 B). The measured Km (ATP) of SNF2H was 37 ± 9 μm, whereas the Km (ATP) of BRG1 was 220 ± 40 μm. The Km (nucleosomes) of SNF2H was 25 ± 8 nm compared with 37 ± 10 nm for BRG1 (Fig. 2 B). We conclude that BRG1, as previously shown (Phelan et al.(19Phelan M.L. Sif S. Narlikar G.J. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 247-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar)), 1G. J. Narlikar, M. L. Phelan, and R. E. Kingston, submitted for publication. and SNF2H have a substrate-stimulated ATPase activity. In agreement with previous results, the BRG1 ATPase activity was also stimulated by naked DNA (Fig. 2 C). TheKm (DNA) of BRG1 was 20 ± 8 nm. As expected, SNF2H ATPase activity was not detectably stimulated by naked DNA. To further examine the interaction of SNF2H with DNA, we mixed naked DNA with nucleosomes to look for inhibition (Fig. 2"

Consequently, several proteins have to be tightly regulated in their expression to allow trypanosomes to adapt rapidly to sudden environmental changes, a process that might be of central importance for parasite survival. However, in contrast to higher eukaryotic cells, trypanosomes do not seem to regulate gene expression through regulation of transcription initiation. These parasites make use of post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms and modification of mRNA half-life is a relevant one. Trans-acting factors binding to cis-elements that affect mRNA stability of mature transcripts have not been identified in these cells. In this work, a novel U-rich RNA-binding protein (TcUBP-1) from Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease, was identified. Its structure includes an RNA recognition motif, a nuclear export signal, and auxiliary domains with glycine- and glutamine-rich regions. TcUBP-1 recognizes the 44-nucleotide AU-rich RNA instability element located in the 3′-untranslated region of mucin SMUG mRNAs (Di Noia, J. M., D'Orso, I., Sanchez, D. O., and Frasch, A. C. (2000)J. Biol. Chem. 275, 10218–10227) as well as GU-rich sequences. Over-expression of TcUBP-1 in trypanosomes decreases the half-life of SMUG mucin mRNAs in vivo but does not affect the stability of other parasite mRNAs. Because TcUBP-1 is developmentally regulated, it might have a relevant role in regulating protein expression during trypanosome differentiation, allowing a correct expression pattern of U-rich-containing mRNAs.

Parker R. Cell. 1995; 81: 179-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). One well characterized cis-element that regulates mRNA stability is an AU-rich element (ARE)1found in the 3′UTR of short-lived mRNAs (2Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3123) Google Scholar, 3Caput D. Beutler B. Hartog K. Thayer R. Brown-Shimer S. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Each ARE represents a combination of functionally and structurally distinct sequence motifs such as the AUUUA pentamer, the UUAUUUA(U/A)(U/A) nonamer, and stretches of uridines and/or U-rich domains that range in size from 50 to 150 bp. It was shown that ARE-directed mRNA decay is linked to cell transformation, cell growth and differentiation, cell adhesion, and immune response regulation (7Chen C.A. Shyu A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar). An effect of the ARE on translation efficiency was also described both positively (8Kontoyiannis D. Pasparakis M. Pizarro T.T. Cominelli F. Kollias G. Immunity. 1999; 10: 387-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar) and negatively (9Sokolowski M. Zhao C. Tan W. Schwartz S. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2303-2319Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). RNA-binding proteins that exhibit affinity for, and interact with, ARE sequences have been identified in higher eukaryotes. Many of these factors contain highly conserved RNA binding domains that place them within RNA recognition motif (RRM) superfamily (10Kim Y.J. Baker B.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 174-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Two kinds of trans-acting factors were described that have opposite functions. The ELAV protein HuR increases stability of ARE-containing mRNAs when over-expressed in transfected fibroblasts (11Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3448-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). Conversely, AUF-1/hnRNP D (12Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7652-7665Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) mediates a destabilizing activity of the mRNAs containing ARE sequences within their 3′UTR (13Loflin P. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1884-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). It was proposed that ELAV proteins may bind the ARE-containing mRNAs in the nucleus and transport them to the cytoplasm, where they either find access to the translational apparatus or are released for rapid degradation (14Gao F.B. Keene J.D. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 579-589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other hnRNPs, such as hnRNP A1 and C (15Hamilton B.J. Nagy E. Malter J.S. Arrick B.A. Rigby W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8881-8887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), hnRNP A0 (16Myer V.E. Steitz J.A. RNA. 1995; 1: 171-182PubMed Google Scholar), and some RNA-binding proteins displaying catalytic activities such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase (17Nagy E. Rigby W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2755-2763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), AUH, an enoyl-CoA hydratase (18Nakagawa J. Waldner H. Meyer-Monard S. Hofsteenge J. Jeno P. Moroni C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2051-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), were also shown to be AU-rich RNA-binding proteins. Trypanosomes, protozoan parasites from the order Kinetoplastida, cause widespread diseases in humans, domestic animals, and wildlife that include infections of medical and veterinary importance. Studies of trypanosomes have revealed a number of unusual mechanisms occurring during transcription and RNA maturation. Among them are the RNA editing in mitochondrial transcripts (19Stuart K. Verh. K. Acad. Geneeskd. Belg. 1998; 60: 63-74PubMed Google Scholar), polycistronic transcription, andtrans-splicing. Polycistronic transcripts are processed to mature mRNAs through trans-splicing on the 5′-end and poly(A) addition on the 3′-end (20Matthews K.R. Tschudi C. Ullu E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). This scenario makes it difficult to consider that trypanosomes regulate protein expression through regulation of transcription initiation, because unrelated mRNAs might be present in the same polycistron (21Teixeira S.M. Kirchhoff L.V. Donelson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22586-22594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In addition, RNA polymerase II promoters have been difficult to detect in trypanosomes. Two putative promoter regions were described as transcriptionally void regions upstream from the highly transcribed actin andHsp70 genes (22Ben Amar M.F. Jefferies D. Pays A. Bakalara N. Kendall G. Pays E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5857-5862Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 23Lee M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1220-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, one example of RNA polymerase II promoter was recently identified in the spliced leader genes of the parasite Leptomonas seymouri (24Gilinger G. Bellofatto V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1556-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus, trypanosomes are interesting organisms in the analysis of post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms affecting mRNA expression patterns (25Roditi I. Furger A. Ruepp S. Schurch N. Butikofer P. Mol Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Cis-regulatory elements altering the half-life of mature mRNAs have been identified, most of them located on the 3′-untranslated regions (3′UTR) (26Hotz H.R. Hartmann C. Huober K. Hug M. Clayton C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3017-3026Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 27Coughlin B.C. Teixeira S.M. Kirchhoff L.V. Donelson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12051-12060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). One example is the 16-mer loop localized in the 3′UTR of procyclic mRNAs ofTrypanosoma brucei that confers mRNA stability and improves translation efficiency (28Furger A. Schurch N. Kurath U. Roditi I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4372-4380Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Also, different 3′UTRs and intergenic regions from trypanosome mRNAs were shown to influenceluciferase expression by changing the steady-state level and/or the translation efficiency of a luc mRNA reporter (29Nozaki T. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 75: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Trypanosoma cruzi transcripts, such as the surface proteins FL-160 (30Weston D. La Flamme A.C. Van Voorhis W.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 102: 53-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), amastin (27Coughlin B.C. Teixeira S.M. Kirchhoff L.V. Donelson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12051-12060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), gp72, and gp85 (29Nozaki T. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 75: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), also contain regulatory sequences that modulate mRNA stability. Although these results suggest the possible importance of cis-acting elements in mRNA stability or instability, thetrans-acting factors involved in these processes have not yet been identified in trypanosomes. T. cruzi is the protozoan parasite agent of Chagas disease. The parasite has two hosts, an insect vector and mammals (including man). The parasite is covered by different highlyO-glycosylated mucins that are regulated developmentally. The stage of the parasite present in the insect vector (epimastigote) expresses members of a small mucin family named TcSMUG whose core proteins are encoded in about 70 different genes (31Di Noia J.M. D'Orso I. Sanchez D.O. Frasch A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10218-10227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The forms of the parasite present in the bloodstream of the mammalian host have larger mucins (60–200 kDa, compare with 35–50 kDa in epimastigotes) encoded by about 500 different genes (32Di Noia J.M. D'Orso I. Aslund L. Sanchez D.O. Frasch A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10843-10850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 33Pollevick G.D. Di Noia J.M. Salto M.L. Lima C.

Developmentally regulated expression of these mucins in the different parasite stages is relevant because they might accomplish different functions in relation to parasite survival (34Frasch A.C. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 282-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In previous work, we have identified an ARE on the 3′UTR of the mRNAs encoding the core protein ofT. cruzi small mucins (TcSMUG), which affect mRNA stability. Transfection experiments, using a cat reporter gene flanked by mucin intergenic regions bearing or not ARE sequences within its 3′UTR, showed that this cis-element destabilizes mucin mRNAs in a stage-specific manner (31Di Noia J.M. D'Orso I. Sanchez D.O. Frasch A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10218-10227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These results suggest that different trans-acting factors might bind mucin transcripts in vivo and selectively regulate the stability in a different manner throughout parasite development (35D'Orso I. Frasch A.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15783-15793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In this work, we have identified a gene encoding a developmentally regulated U-rich RNA-binding protein named TcUBP-1. It specifically recognizes the 44-nucleotide SMUG mucin AU-rich RNA instability element previously described by us (31Di Noia J.M. D'Orso I. Sanchez D.O. Frasch A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10218-10227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), as well as GU-rich sequences. Transfection experiments allowed us to demonstrate that TcUBP-1 is able to selectively destabilize SMUG mucin transcripts in vivobut not mRNAs lacking AU-rich elements within their 3′UTR. These results suggest that TcUBP-1 is involved in the regulation of mRNA expression mediated by U-rich elements. T. cruziCL-Brener cloned stock (36Zingales B. Pereira M.E. Oliveira R.P. Almeida K.A. Umezawa E.S. Souto R.P. Vargas N. Cano M.I. da Silveira J.F. Nehme N.S. Morel C.M. Brener Z. Macedo A. Acta Trop. 1997; 68: 159-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) was used. Different forms of the parasites were obtained as described previously (37Gonzalez Cappa S.M. Bijovsky A.T. Freilij H. Muller L. Katzin A.M. Medicina. 1981; 41: 119-120PubMed Google Scholar). Epimastigote cultures were taken in logarithmic growth phase at a cell density of 3 × 107/ml and treated with actinomycin D (Sigma) at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml, which is known to inhibit transcription in trypanosomatids (28Furger A.

TcUBP-1 open reading frame (GenBankTM accession number AF372519) was cloned in the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites of pRIBOTEX vector (39Martinez-Calvillo S. Lopez I. Hernandez R. Gene. 1997; 199: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. R. Hernandez (Universidad Nacional de Mexico). Transfections were carried out as described previously (31Di Noia J.M. D'Orso I. Sanchez D.O. Frasch A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10218-10227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). RNA was purified using TRIzol reagent following the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.) Northern blots were carried out as described (40Fourney R.M. Miyakoshi J. Day III, R.S. Paterson M. Focus. 1978; 10: 5-9Google Scholar). The SMUG and 24SαrRNA DNA probes were obtained as described previously (31Di Noia J.M. D'Orso I. Sanchez D.O. Frasch A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10218-10227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Ductin DNA probe was obtained from a clone with high homology to mammalian ductin. 2R. Verdún and D. O. Sánchez, unpublished data. Hsp70 probe was obtained from the EST clone number TENG-0042 (GenBankTM accession number AI034982). Genomic DNA of T. cruziCL-Brener clone was digested with the indicated restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs). The DNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis in 0.8% agarose gel, transferred by capillarity (41Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.31-9.57Google Scholar) to Zeta Probe Nylon-N membranes (Bio-Rad), and UV cross-linked using a UVP CL-1000 cross-linker. Filters were hybridized with the probes described below (RRM and AUX) using hybridization solution containing 0.5 m NaH2PO4, 7% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% bovine serum albumin, at 58 °C for low stringency conditions and 65 °C for high stringency conditions. The RRM probe was made from clone TcUBP-1 by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotides NH2-L (5′-CGGGATCCATGAGCCAAATTGTTGTTTC-3′) and RNP-II (5′-CGGAATGTAGTCACCTGGAG-3′). Probe AUX was made using oligonucleotides NES-sec (5′-AACAAGCGGTTGAAGGTAGCG-3′) and COOH-L (5′-CGGAATTCTTACCTTCGAACAGGACGGGC-3′) and was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Reverse transcription was performed on total RNA from the epimastigote stage of the parasite using the Superscript II kit following the manufacturer' instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Primer oligo(dT)18(5′-GCGACTCCGCGGCCGCG(T)18-3′) was used for cDNA synthesis. The first polymerase chain reaction was performed using the oligonucleotides ME (5′-TACAGTTTCTGTACTATATTG-3′) and RNP-I (5′-AAACTTCACAATCCATAGGCC-3′). These products were cloned in pGEMT-Easy vector (Promega) and sequenced. All plasmids for in vitrotranscription were constructed as follows. Complementary DNA oligonucleotides, corresponding to the sense and antisense strands of each RNA, were annealed and cloned into the EcoRI andHindIII sites of the vector pBS(−) (Stratagene). All of the RNA probes had the same flanking region, GGATC, in the 5′-end and one A at the 3′-end. Transcription of sense sequences was performed with 1 μg of HindIII-digested plasmids using T7 RNA-polymerase (Promega) in the presence of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 500 μm ATP, CTP, and GTP. All transcripts were purified on an 8 murea-12% polyacrylamide gel. For total extract preparation, parasites were resuspended in lysis buffer (0.75% CHAPS detergent, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm β-mercapthoethanol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 10% glycerol) and supplemented with protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm, andtrans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido(4)guanidino), 50 μm (Sigma). After 30 min on ice, the extract was centrifuged at 10,000 × g and the supernatant was stored at −70 °C. TcUBP-1 cDNA was cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI restriction endonuclease sites of the pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) generating a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion and transformed in Escherichia coli strain DH5αF′Iq. Cultures were induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. Recombinant proteins were purified using GST-agarose columns (Sigma). Binding reactions were performed with different amounts of TcUBP-1 protein, 10,000 cpm of RNA probe, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 50 ng/μl tRNA (Sigma) in a 20-μl final volume reaction mixture and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. When indicated, heparin was added at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. Each reaction was loaded directly onto a 7% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 38:2) 0.5× TBE (Tris borate-EDTA), to perform an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). For competition assays, TcUBP-1 recombinant protein was incubated simultaneously with the indicated amounts of unlabeled and labeled RNAs. All homoribopolymers were from Sigma. For the determination of the Kd between TcUBP-1 and different RNAs, increasing amounts of protein were incubated with the labeled RNA and resolved as described above. Purified GST-TcUBP-1 was injected into rabbits with Freund's adjuvant two times at 3-week intervals. For Western blot analysis, protein samples fractionated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels were transferred to Hybond C nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), probed with anti GST-TcUBP-1 antibodies, and developed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies and the Supersignal® West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Signals were quantitated using the 1D Image Analysis Software (Kodak Digital Science). The presence of functional AU-rich elements in mucin mRNAs from trypanosomes (31Di Noia J.M. D'Orso I.

During a search for new T. cruzi genes (42Aguero F. Verdun R.E. Frasch A.C. Sanchez D.O. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1996-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we identified ESTs and Genome Sequence Surveys having homologies with eukaryotic RNA-binding proteins. One of these cDNA clones has a deduced amino acid sequence with identities with Sex lethal (SXL) (43Merendino L. Guth S. Bilbao D. Martinez C. Valcarcel J. Nature. 1999; 402: 838-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), Rbp9 (44Kim Y.J. Baker B.S. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1045-1056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and members of the ELAV family (45Good P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4557-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) (Figs.1 and 2). The putative protein encoded by this T. cruzi cDNA clone, for which the complete sequence was obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, was named TcUBP-1 for T. cruzi U-rich RNA-binding protein. This 1017-base pair clone had a 638-base pair coding region.Figure 2The RRM and a putative nuclear export signal of TcUBP-1 resemble those of higher eukaryotes RNA-binding proteins.

The identities are boxed, and the gaps are introduced for best alignment. The arrow indicates the separation of the amino-terminal region and the RRM motif. The RNP-1 and -2 motifs are indicated above each comparison.B, comparison among the NES of TcUBP-1, mPKIα, HIV-1 Rev, MAPK, and cyclin B1. The position of three of four conserved Leu residues is indicated in bold letters and aligned vertically.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) TcUBP-1 presents a short Gln-rich amino-terminal composed of 34 amino acids followed by one RNA recognition motif having the canonical RNP-2 and RNP-1 motifs (46Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar). The RRM motif from the T. cruziprotein (Fig. 1, A and B) highly resembles those present in higher eukaryote RNA-binding proteins, such as Rbp9, HuC, and SXL among others (Fig.2 A). The similarity between them ranges between 40–55%, and the RNP-1 and -2 motifs are the most conserved regions. This degree of conservation might be because of the tertiary structure of the RRM motif required for RNA recognition (47Handa N. Nureki O. Kurimoto K. Kim I. Sakamoto H. Shimura Y. Muto Y. Yokoyama S. Nature. 1999; 398: 579-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). After the RRM motif, a putative NES, or LEU-rich nuclear export signal (48Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar), is present (Fig. 1). This region has three of the four LEU expected to be conserved (49Dreyfuss G. Hentze M. Lamond A.I.

First is a short Gly-rich region that resembles the repeats in hnRNP A1; an ARE-binding protein in which the intracellular localization determinant for targeting it to the nucleus has been identified in the Gly-rich domain of the protein (51Siomi H. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Second, a glutamine-rich carboxyl-terminal region is present. Both Gly- and Gln-rich auxiliary domains, like the ones present in TcUBP-1, were described as being involved in protein-protein interactions in other eukaryotic cells (52Pollard V.W. Michael W.M.

A Southern blot of T. cruzi genomic DNA using the RRM region as a probe (Fig.3 A) revealed a number of bands under low stringency, whereas only a few bands were observed under high stringency conditions (Fig. 3 B, panels I andII, respectively). A probe for the auxiliary region gave similar results, although fewer bands were observed under low stringency conditions (data not shown). These results indicated that TcUPB-1 might be part of a gene family whose members have greater homologies in the RRM motif than in the auxiliary domains. Two clones related in sequence and structure to TcUBP-1, containing the same RRM motif and different auxiliary domains, were recently identified in our laboratory. 3I. D'Orso and A. C. C. Frasch, unpublished data. Searches in the Genome Sequence Survey and EST T. cruzi and T. brucei data bases were conducted using the RRM sequence. Four new sequences were identified (GenBankTM accession numbers AZ050633, AQ638822, AQ637856, and AQ654405). These clones share about 35–50% identity in the RRM motif, and the RNP-1 and RNP-2 motifs are the most conserved region of the proteins. Additionally, a search in the Sanger Center Leishmania majorand T. brucei (www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/) data bases was performed. Two clones highly similar to TcUBP-1 were identified (GenBankTM accession numbers AQ846565 and 0.15543) (see Fig. 3 C). The similarity index between them is about 70%, the RRM motif and the putative NES sequence being the most conserved regions of the proteins. These results suggest that highly similar sequences of TcUBP-1 are conserved in different protozoan parasite species. We have shown that a 44-nt AU-richcis-element localized on the 3′UTR of the TcSMUG mucin family was important in conferring mRNA instability in a stage-specific manner (31Di Noia J.M. D'Orso I. Sanchez D.O. Frasch A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10218-10227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To determine whether TcUBP-1 recognizes this RNA sequence (named SMUG-L-AU), an in vitro binding reaction was performed (Fig.4 A). The in vitrotranscribed SMUG-L-AU RNA was incubated with GST, GST-TcUBP-1, or without protein, and the reactions were resolved in a native EMSA. TcUBP-1 bound to the SMUG-L-AU RNA and the binding was not affected by the addition of heparin, an unspecific competitor. Control experiments using GST protein were negative (Fig. 4 A). The ribonucleoprotein complex formed by TcUBP-1 and the SMUG-L-AU RNA template was efficiently competed with poly(U) but not with poly(A) or poly(C) RNA homopolymers. Poly(G) somewhat reduced the binding of TcUBP-1 to the RNA probe but much less efficiently than poly(U) (Fig.4 B). The binding of TcUBP-1 to the SMUG-L-AU probe seemed to be to a single RNA site, because only one shifted band was obtained within a large range of TcUBP-1 protein amount (Fig. 4 C). We also searched for the minimal sequence requirement for TcUBP-1 to bind the SMUG-L-AU RNA. Three RNAs from SMUG-L-AU were used to performin vitro binding and EMSA (Fig. 4 D). The binding to the 31-nt SMUG-L-AU-1 RNA was reduced as compared with the complete SMUG-L-AU RNA, showing that the two AUUUUA motifs in the boundaries of this RNA are important for an efficient binding of TcUBP-1. The binding to the UUAUUUAUU nonamer (SMUG-L-AU-2 RNA) was detectable only after over-exposing the film. This interaction was slightly improved when the nonamer was present within a short U-rich context, as happens with the SMUG-L-AU-3 RNA, which has two additional uridines outside the nonamer RNA oligonucleotide (Fig. 4 D). Thus, the entire 44-nt SMUG-L-AU RNA seems to be required for an efficient binding, since deletion of some U-rich stretches within this sequence greatly affects TcUBP-1 recognition. Because a number of T. cruzi transcripts have AU-rich sequences within their 3′UTR, we tested whether TcUBP-1 s"

Synthetic transmembrane peptides were used with a general acetyl-GW2(LA)nLW2A-ethanolamine sequence. These peptides were incorporated in large unilamellar vesicles of 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. The vesicles were diluted in buffered deuterium oxide, and the H/D exchange after different incubation times was directly analyzed by means of ESI-MS. First, the influence of the length of the hydrophobic Leu-Ala sequence on exchange behavior was investigated. It was shown that longer peptide analogs are more protected from H/D exchange than expected on the basis of their length with respect to bilayer thickness. This is explained by an increased protection from the bilayer environment, because of stretching of the lipid acyl chains and/or tilting of the longer peptides. Next, the role of the flanking tryptophan residues was investigated. The length of the transmembrane part that shows very slow H/D exchange was found to depend on the exact position of the tryptophans in the peptide sequence, suggesting that tryptophan acts as a strong determinant for positioning of proteins at the membrane/water interface. Finally, the influence of putative helix breakers was studied. It was shown that the presence of Pro in the transmembrane segment results in much higher exchange rates as compared with Gly or Leu, suggesting a destabilization of the α-helix.

Important structural and dynamic features, such as stability of the transmembrane segments or their precise positioning at the lipid/water interface, will be determined not only by intrinsic properties of the transmembrane segments, but also by their interaction with surrounding lipids. A convenient way to gain insight into how the special characteristics of transmembrane segments and their interaction with lipids may influence the behavior of membrane proteins is by studying model systems of artificial transmembrane peptides with desired properties in well defined lipid bilayers. Recently, we have described a new method using nano-ESI-MS1 (1Demmers J.A.A. Haverkamp J. Heck A.J.R. Koeppe R.E., II Killian J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3189-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) to study the properties of transmembrane protein segments in model systems by analyzing the kinetics of hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange. The results showed that various populations of amide hydrogen atoms can be distinguished that are characteristic for different regions of the transmembrane segments. These populations are fast exchanging amide hydrogens located in the peptide termini that are exposed to the aqueous phase, intermediately exchanging hydrogens of the residues located in the bilayer/water interface, and slowly exchanging hydrogens located in the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer. The results suggest that measurement of exchange properties of peptides by ESI-MS is a convenient method to investigate factors that determine interfacial positioning and/or stability of transmembrane protein segments. In the present study, we have investigated the influence of several of such factors. Hereby, special emphasis is given to the length of the α-helical hydrophobic core with respect to the bilayer thickness, the role of potential anchoring residues at the lipid/water interface, and the influence of α-helix breaking residues in the transmembrane segment. As models for protein transmembrane segments, we have used WALP peptides that already have been used successfully to investigate various aspects of peptide/lipid interactions (2de Planque M.R.R.

These peptides have a hydrophobic core of alternating Leu and Ala, which is flanked on both sides by Trp residues (see Table I), and they have been shown to form α-helical transmembrane helices (4Killian J.A.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 401-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). To investigate whether this is related to changes in membrane protein interfacial positioning and/or stability, we first analyzed the effects of increasing the hydrophobic length of WALP peptides on the H/D exchange kinetics of peptides with different lengths of the Leu-Ala core in bilayers of DMPC. This lipid was chosen because it forms well-defined bilayers with all peptides under experimental conditions (2de Planque M.R.R. Greathouse D.V. Koeppe R.E., II Schafer H. Marsh D. Killian J.A.

Their abundance at the lipid/water interface in several membrane proteins (5Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A.L. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. Mackinnon R.

Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1964) Google Scholar) is therefore likely to be functionally important, e.g. for stabilization of transmembrane helices or precise positioning of such helices at the interface. The present mass spectrometric method offers the opportunity to investigate these effects by analyzing the H/D exchange kinetics of peptides of identical total length in which the position of Trp residues along the sequence is varied. Finally, besides the length of the transmembrane helices and their interfacial anchoring behavior, the stability of the transmembrane segment is also important for membrane protein structure and function. In water-soluble proteins, the stability of the backbone of regular α-helices has been found to undergo large changes when potent breakers of both α-helical and β-sheet structures, like Pro and Gly, are inserted (e.g. see Ref. 16Eyles S.J. Gierasch L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the effect on stability of these residues in transmembrane segments. Therefore, H/D exchange kinetics in transmembrane segments containing Pro and Gly residues are compared with those of peptides without these residues. The results of this study show that peptides that are long with respect to the hydrophobic thickness of the bilayer are protected from H/D exchange to a relatively large extent, which is explained in terms of induced adaptation (thickening) of the bilayer and/or a tilting of the peptides. Furthermore, the positions of the Trp residues in the transmembrane sequence are shown to be a critical factor for H/D exchange kinetics. These results suggest that Trp side chains interact strongly with the membrane/water interface at specific sites. Finally, it is shown that peptides containing Pro, but not Gly, show a markedly different H/D exchange pattern than peptides lacking this residue. This suggests a significant effect of Pro on the stability of the transmembrane α-helix. The results are discussed in relation to existing literature data on related peptide/lipid interactions.

Peptide incorporation into phospholipid vesicles was performed essentially as described previously (1Demmers J.A.A. Haverkamp J. Heck A.J.R. Koeppe R.E., II Killian J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3189-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Shortly, peptides were dissolved in a small volume of trifluoroacetic acid (10 μl per mg of peptide) and dried under a nitrogen stream. To remove residual trifluoroacetic acid, the peptides were subsequently dissolved in TFE (1 mg/ml) followed by evaporation of the solvent in a rotavapor. Peptides were then again dissolved in TFE to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. Dry mixed films of peptide and DMPC (peptide to lipid ratio of 1:25) were prepared as follows. Peptide solutions in TFE (1 ml; 0.46 mm) were added to DMPC solutions in methanol (1 ml; 12 mm) and vigorously vortexed. The solvent was removed by evaporation in a rotavapor. The mixed films were then dried for 24 h under vacuum. The films were hydrated at about 40 °C, well above the gel to liquid crystalline phase transition temperature of the phospholipid (24 °C (18Blume A. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5436-5442Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar)) in 0.5 ml of 10 mm ammonium acetate buffer (pH 7.5). Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVETs) were prepared by extrusion through a 400-nm filter at room temperature and kept at 4 °C until use. Before the start of H/D exchange, LUVETs were preincubated at 30 °C for at least 30 min. For accurate comparison of the exchange data, LUVET suspensions with different peptide composition were mixed prior to the start of the exchange. LUVET suspensions were then 50 times diluted in deuterated ammonium acetate buffer at 30 °C (10 mm, pH 7.5), containing ∼1 mm NaI. At selected time points, 2 μl of this diluted suspension was transferred into a gold-coated glass capillary and the measurement was started as quickly as possible, whereby the peptides were analyzed simultaneously. The dead-time between dilution and measurement was at a minimum 1 min. MS measurements were performed on an ESI quadrupole time-of-flight instrument (Q-Tof; Micromass Ltd., Manchester, UK) or an ESI time-of-flight instrument (LCT; Micromass Ltd., Manchester, UK), both operating in positive ion mode and equipped with a Z-spray nano-ESI source. Nano-ESI needles with a relatively large tip opening (several tens of micrometers) were prepared from borosilicate glass capillaries (Kwik-FilTM, World Precision Instruments Inc., Sarasota, Florida) on a P-97 puller (Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA). The needles were coated with a thin gold layer (∼500 Å) using an Edwards Scancoat sputter-coater 501 (at 40 mV, 1 kV, for 200 s). The nano-ESI capillary was positioned ∼5 mm before the orifice of the mass spectrometer. For MS experiments, the quadrupole was set in the RF only mode to act as an ion guide to efficiently link the ES ion source with the reflectron time-of-flight analyzer. The potential between the nano-ESI capillary and the orifice of the mass spectrometer was typically set to 1800 V, the cone voltage was 140 V. The nanospray needle was constantly kept at ∼30 °C. In MS/MS mode on the Q-Tof instrument, the quadrupole was used to select precursor ions, which were fragmented in the hexapole collision cell, generating product ions that were subsequently mass analyzed by the orthogonal time-of-flight mass analyzer. For MS/MS measurements on the Q-Tof instrument, the collision energy was set to 150 V. Argon was used as the collision gas. The quadrupole mass resolution parameters were set to a relatively large mass window to select the entire isotope envelope of the precursor ions. The reflectron time-of-flight parameters were set such that the fragment ions were detected at more than unit mass resolution, as required to obtain isotopically resolved H/D profiles. Increases in deuterium content (in Da) were calculated by using the average mass-to-charge (m/z) values of the isotope clusters of the undeuterated peptide and the (partly) deuterated peptides. To study effects of the hydrophobic length of transmembrane peptides on H/D exchange properties, a series of WALP/DMPC systems with varying peptide lengths (see Table I) were prepared for nano-ESI-MS measurements. To allow accurate detection of small differences in exchange properties of different peptides, all experiments were performed with mixtures of two or more peptide-lipid systems synchronically. Therefore, LUVET suspensions with different peptide composition were mixed prior to the start of the exchange. Because such combination experiments are performed under identical experimental conditions, the deuterium levels can be compared directly. Fig. 1illustrates that this method works. This figure presents, as an example, ESI mass spectra derived from simultaneously incubated and injected LUVETs of WALP21/DMPC and WALP23/DMPC dispersed in buffer, recorded by the direct proteoliposome method. The extremely hydrophobic membrane peptides are almost exclusively detected as [M+Na]+ ions, whereas the monomers, dimers, trimers, and tetramers of DMPC are observed as [M+H]+ as well as [M+Na]+ ions. The zoomed-in spectra in theinset show the isotope envelopes of the [M+Na]+ ions of the non-deuterated reconstituted WALP21 and WALP23 peptides (top), as well as those of the WALP peptides reconstituted in bilayer dispersions that were incubated for 5 min in buffered D2O (bottom). The shift in mass of the peptides indicates uptake of about 8.5–9 deuterium atoms in both cases. Moreover, the spectra indicate that the vesicles are disrupted during the ionization process in such a way that only monomers and small oligomers of phospholipid molecules are observed. The effect of increasing the hydrophobic length of the peptides with respect to the hydrophobic thickness of the bilayer was tested using a series of WALP peptides with varying hydrophobic core lengths (see Table I). Fig. 2 shows the measured deuterium content as a function of incubation time in deuterated buffer. All WALP peptides incorporated in DMPC show a fast initial exchange. Within the experimental dead-time (∼1.5 min) all peptides have taken up about 7–9 deuterium atoms. After this fast exchange the deuterium content continues to increase gradually with time, though at a much smaller exchange rate (defined as intermediate exchange rate, Ref. 1Demmers J.A.A. Haverkamp J. Heck A.J.R. Koeppe R.E., II Killian J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3189-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows that all peptides have similar exchange kinetics curves in the first 20 min after incubation. All curves level off to a deuterium level, which is low as compared with the total number of labile hydrogens present in each peptide, which varies from 22 to 29 (see Table I). Furthermore, the deuterium content increases with increasing peptide length. However, the differences in deuterium levels are relatively small and represent only a fraction of the number of additional hydrogens that become available for exchange when the peptide length is increased. By fitting the kinetic curves using a non-linear squares fitting to multiexponential functions in all peptides, three kinetic regions of exchange rates representing hydrogen populations were distinguished. In the short time range from 0 to 20 min, the fast and intermediate exchangeable hydrogens exchange, whereas the remaining hydrogens exchange only after ∼20 min. The number of hydrogens in specific populations are shown in Table II. As was shown previously (1Demmers J.A.A. Haverkamp J. Heck A.J.R. Koeppe R.E., II Killian J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3189-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and will also be shown later in this work, the fast exchanging hydrogens are predominantly the hydrogens at the N and C termini of the peptides, sticking out of the bilayer, while the hydrogens with intermediate exchange rates are the ones close to the Trp in the interfacial region. The remaining hydrogens, including the ones in the hydrophobic core have rate constants of (much) smaller than 0.10 min−1. These slow exchange rates are a result of both the extremely low partition coefficient of D2O in a lipid bilayer (19Jansen M. Blume A. Biophys.

The amount of fast exchanged hydrogens increases with the length of the peptides but does not increase quantitatively with the numbers of exchangeable hydrogens. For instance, only about one-third of the extra number of hydrogens of WALP23 compared with WALP16 exchanges rapidly and, therefore, the majority of the extra hydrogens of WALP23 are protected against exchange.Table IINumbers of fast, intermediate, and remaining hydrogens in the investigated WALP peptidesPeptideNo. of fast HaStandard errors are below 10%.No. of intermediate HaStandard errors are below 10%.No. of remaining HaStandard errors are below 10%.WALP166.92.412.7WALP198.02.914.1WALP218.52.915.6WALP239.13.516.4The rates of exchange for the fast exchangeable hydrogens are all >1.2 min−1 for the intermediate hydrogens between 0.16 and 0.26 min−1 and for the hydrogens remaining after 20 min, smaller than 0.10 min−1.a Standard errors are below 10%. Open table in a new tab The rates of exchange for the fast exchangeable hydrogens are all >1.2 min−1 for the intermediate hydrogens between 0.16 and 0.26 min−1 and for the hydrogens remaining after 20 min, smaller than 0.10 min−1. These results may be explained by several possible mechanisms. First, the number of protected hydrogens may be higher due to a larger core region of the α-helix in the longer peptides. Second, the longer peptides may be more protected by the bilayer itself, as a result of tilting of the longer helices, or due to adaptation of the lipids to the peptide/lipid mismatch by stretching of the acyl chains (2de Planque M.R.R. Greathouse D.V. Koeppe R.E., II Schafer H. Marsh D. Killian J.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9333-9345Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). These possibilities will be discussed in more detail below (see “Discussion”). In principle, an alternative possible explanation for the protection of part of the peptides against H/D exchange would be the formation of peptide aggregates, which would also hamper access of D2O molecules to the amide hydrogens. However, several observations argue against this. First, no restricted component was observed in electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements in these peptide/lipid systems, suggesting that WALP peptides are most probably present as monomeric transmembrane helices (2de Planque M.R.R. Greathouse D.V. Koeppe R.E., II Schafer H. Marsh D. Killian J.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9333-9345Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Second, nano-flow ESI-MS experiments on the non-soluble WALP23 in buffer showed that when this dispersion was injected, not even a trace amount of WALP23 could be detected after extensive sonication (data not shown). Remarkably, after addition of TFE (1:1; volume ratio), which presumably breaks up the aggregates, the peptide could again be easily detected in the spectrum. It is therefore concluded that it is not possible to measure aggregated peptides directly by ESI-MS, indicating that the WALP peptides of which the mass spectra are analyzed in the present study do not originate from aggregates. It has been proposed that Trp residues have strong interactions with the interface. To gain more insight into the potential anchoring role of the Trp residues, the positions of this aromatic amino acid were varied in peptides of invariable length. Moreover, to make the putative interaction zone less broad, the number of Trp residues was reduced to one at each terminus of the peptide (see Table I). WALP23inner has Trp residues at the 3 and 21 positions, whereas WALP23outer has Trp residues at positions 2 and 22. Fig. 3shows the deuterium incorporation of both peptides reconstituted in DMPC after synchronic dilution in deuterated buffer and subsequent mass spectrometric analysis. Although both peptides have the same number of exchangeable hydrogens, they clearly show different H/D exchange behavior. The deuterium level curve for WALP23inner lies well above the one of WALP23outer, both in the short term region as well as after longer incubation periods. Comparing the averagem/z values of the isotope clusters of the peptides in both undeuterated and deuterated buffer results in a 1.6 (± 0.2) Da higher deuterium content for WALP23inner. This suggests that WALP23inner has a larger population of fast exchangeable hydrogens. Consequently, WALP23inner incorporated in a DMPC bilayer seems to have a shorter protected region that could be due to a shorter inter-Trp distance. The deuteration levels of WALP23inner are also on the long term about 2 Da higher than for WALP23outer. These results suggest that the position of the Trp side chain determines the extent of protection in the bilayer environment, consistent with the idea that Trp forms a strong interfacial anchor (3de Planque M.R.R. Kruijtzer J.A.W. Liskamp R.M.J. Marsh D. Greathouse D.V. Koeppe R.E., II de Kruijff B. Killian J.A. J. Biol.

The time course for exchange of WALP23inner appears to match that of WALP23, when comparing the data in Figs. 2 and 3. However, if one assumes that the tryptophan side chain hydrogens exchange fast, then WALP23inner and WALP23outer would have two fast exchangeable hydrogens less than WALP23, and therefore the data would suggest that it is the backbone exchange of WALP23outer that matches well that of WALP23. Measurements with W′ALP21, which contains methylated Trp residues (see Table I), and thus has no exchangeable hydrogen atom in the indole side chain moiety, suggested that these indole hydrogens indeed exchange rapidly. It was found that the H/D exchange curve of this peptide lies close to 4 Da lower than that of WALP21 after both short and longer incubation times (data not shown). The apparent similarity in backbone exchange kinetics of WALP23 and WALP23outer is consistent with the idea that in the unfavorable case when the peptide is long with respect to the h"

The cDNA for the mammalian AceCS1 has been isolated recently, and the mRNA was shown to be negatively regulated by sterols in cultured cells. In the current study, we describe the molecular mechanisms directing the sterol-regulated expression of murine AceCS1 by cloning and functional studies of the 5′-flanking region of the AceCS1 gene. AnAceCS1 promoter-reporter gene (∼2.1 kilobase pairs) was negatively regulated when sterols were added to the medium of cultured cells, and the promoter was markedly induced by co-transfection of a plasmid that expresses the transcriptionally active nuclear form of either sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1a or -2 in HepG2 cells. Sequence analysis suggested that theAceCS1 promoter contains an E-box, two putative CCAAT-boxes, eight sterol regulatory element (SRE) motifs, and six GC-boxes. Gel shift assays demonstrated that all eight SRE motifs bound purified SREBP-1a in vitro with similar affinity. Luciferase reporter gene assays revealed that sterol regulation was critically dependent on three closely spaced SRE motifs and an adjacent GC-box. However, mutation of two putative upstream CCAAT-boxes did not affect SREBP dependent activation. Electrophoretic mobility “supershift” analyses confirmed that both Sp1 and Sp3 bound to the critical GC-box. In addition, transfection studies inDrosophila SL2 cells demonstrated that SREBP synergistically activated the AceCS1 promoter along with Sp1 or Sp3 but not with nuclear factor-Y.

Previous biochemical studies reported that both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial isoforms of mammalian AceCS are expressed in the liver (1Woodnutt G. Parker D.S. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1986; 85B: 487-490Google Scholar). Recently using an elegant suppression subtractive hybridization method, Luonget al. (2Luong A. Hannah V.C. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26458-26466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) identified a novel cDNA that encodes cytosolic AceCS from Chinese hamster ovary cells that expressed high levels of nuclear forms of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs). Independently, Fujino et al. (3Fujino T. Kondo J. Ishikawa M. Morikawa K. Yamamoto T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11420-11426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) also isolated two cDNAs that encode functionally distinct murine acetyl-CoA synthetases using peptide sequences derived from purified bovine cardiac acetyl-CoA synthetase. One cDNA, designated AceCS1, encodes a cytosolic enzyme identical to the cDNA isolated by Luong et al. (2Luong A. Hannah V.C. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26458-26466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The other cDNA, AceCS 2, encodes a mitochondrial matrix enzyme that contains a putative mitochondrial-targeting signal and it is expressed predominantly in extrahepatic tissues (3Fujino T. Kondo J. Ishikawa M. Morikawa K. Yamamoto T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11420-11426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The predicted amino acid identity between AceCS1 and AceCS2 is 45.8%, and both enzymes exhibit similar affinity for acetate. The activity of AceCS1 is regulated by changes in the nutritional and hormonal status of the animal; i.e. its activity falls upon starvation and it is activated upon refeeding (1Woodnutt G. Parker D.S. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1986; 85B: 487-490Google Scholar). The mRNA level of AceCS1 is also increased by sterol depletion or by forced overexpression of nuclear SREBP-1a in tissue culture experiments (2Luong A. Hannah V.C. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26458-26466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Therefore, AceCS1 is likely to be involved in generating acetyl-CoA for lipid biosynthesis in the liver. On the other hand, the mRNA level of AceCS2 is not regulated by sterols; however, it is increased by starvation. Therefore, AceCS2 is probably more involved in providing acetyl-CoA for oxidation and energy production under ketogenic conditions in the mitochondria of extrahepatic tissues. SREBPs are unique members of the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper family of transcription factors that activate transcription of multiple genes required for cholesterol and unsaturated fatty acid metabolism (4Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3003) Google Scholar, 5Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). SREBPs are synthesized as precursor proteins that are bound to the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, or nuclear envelope, via two transmembrane domains. Upon sterol deprivation, SREBPs are activated to release the transcriptionally active NH2-terminal segment through an elegant mechanism requiring two sequential proteolytic events that must occur in the proper order (6Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). This proteolytic process is regulated by SREBP cleavage-activating protein, which forms complexes with SREBPs and escorts them from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex (7Sakai J.

This releases the NH2-terminal fragment corresponding to the mature SREBPs that translocate to the nucleus, where they bind to sterol regulatory elements (SREs) and, in cooperation with generic transcription factors such as Sp1 and nuclear factor-Y (NF-Y), they activate transcription of a wide array of genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis. When excess cholesterol accumulates in cells, the movement of SREBPs from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi is blocked, proteolysis cannot occur, and transcription of SREBP target genes declines (5Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar, 10Nohturfft A. Yabe D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Three major isoforms of SREBPs have been identified: SREBP-1a, -1c, and -2. SREBP-1a and -1c are transcribed from the single SREBP-1 gene through alternative promoter usage, and SREBP-2 is the product of a distinct gene. Each isoform shows significant differences in their capacity and specificity to activate gene expression. The longer unique amino-terminal region in SREBP-1a, relative to SREBP-1c, contains a high percentage of acidic amino acids that make it a potent transcriptional activator of genes that encode enzymes in the biosynthesis of cholesterol and unsaturated fatty acids as well as the gene encoding low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). SREBP-1c is a much weaker activator of gene expression because it lacks the 29 acidic amino acids present in SREBP-1a and it selectively stimulates the genes for fatty acid synthesis. SREBP-2 has an activation domain similar to SREBP-1a, and it is a strong transcriptional activator of predominantly cholesterol biosynthetic genes (4Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3003) Google Scholar, 13Pai J.T. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5437-5442Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Although SREBP-1a is a strong transcriptional activator, the predominant form in the liver and fat is SREBP-1c (14Shimomura I. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). The nuclear levels of all SREBPs are modulated by the rate of proteolytic cleavage mediated through SREBP cleavage-activating protein and S1P, whereas the level of SREBP-1c is also regulated at the mRNA level in the liver in response to insulin through an unknown mechanism (15Foretz M.

However, a direct role for the SREBPs in activation of the AceCS1 promoter has not been demonstrated. Here we describe the cloning, sequencing, and functional analysis of the murine AceCS1 promoter. Our experiments demonstrate that there are multiple SREBP binding sites that function together with a single site for the Sp1 factor to activate the AceCS1promoter in a sterol-regulated fashion.

Briefly, the first PCR was conducted with a combination of adaptor primer 1 (provided in the kit) and AceCS1 cDNA primer 1 (5′-GCTTCCACTGCCGCTCTTGCGCCG-3′) using a mouse genomic library provided in the kit as a template. Nested PCR was then carried out with a combination of adaptor primer 2 (provided in the kit) and AceCS1 cDNA primer 2 (5′-GCGCCGCTCCTCGGGAAGCCCCA-3′) using the first PCR product as a template.

Chem. 2000; 275: 4726-4733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). pPac-nSREBP-1a encoding the nuclear form of SREBP-1a was generated by directionally inserting the PCR-amplified fragments corresponding to amino acids 1–460 of human SREBP-1a into the BamHI and XhoI sites of the pPac vector. pHMG Syn-luc, the human HMG-CoA synthase promoter-luciferase reporter gene, contains nucleotides −376 to +36 relative to the mRNA start site of the human HMG-CoA synthase promoter, and pHSS-luc, the human squalene synthase promoter-luciferase reporter gene, contains nucleotides −936 to +76 relative to the mRNA start site, respectively. They were constructed by directionally inserting the PCR-amplified fragment of the human genomic DNA containing the corresponding sequences into pGL3 Basic. HepG2 cells are a line of human hepatoma cells; they were maintained in buffer A (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Schneider line 2 (SL2) cells, a continuous Drosophila cell line, were purchased from Invitrogen, maintained in Schneider's medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and grown at 23 °C. DNA transfection for HepG2 cells was carried out using LipofectAMINE PLUS as described previously (11Sakai J. Rawson R.B. Espenshade P.J. Cheng D. Seegmiller A.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Mol.

On day 1, cells were transfected with the indicated amount of reporter plasmid and pCMV-derived expression plasmid as indicated in the individual figure legends. The total amount of DNA was adjusted by adding pcDNA3 plasmid (Invitrogen) such that the total amount of DNA was constant in each sample. 3–4 h after transfection, the cells were switched to 1 ml of buffer B (buffer A containing 10% delipidiated fetal bovine serum, 50 μm compactin, and 50 μm sodium mevalonate), and companion wells were cultured in the absence or presence of sterols (1 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol plus 10 μg/ml cholesterol added in a final concentration of 0.2% ethanol) as indicated in the figure legends. After 20 h, the cells in each well were lysed with 0.2 ml of 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and aliquots were used for measuring luciferase and β-galactosidase activity as described below. DNA transfections for SL2 cells were carried out with the modified bovine serum transfection kit (MBS, Stratagene) as described previously, except that cells were incubated at 23 °C during the transfection (6Sakai J.

Cells were plated at 0.5 × 106cells/22-mm dish on day 0. On day 1, the cells were transfected with 0.5 mg of luciferase reporter plasmid and the indicated amount of pPac-derived expression vectors (see the figure legends). The total amount of DNA was equalized by adding the appropriate amount of pPac vector plasmid. Cells were harvested 20 h after transfection, and assays were performed as described below. The luciferase activities were measured in a Berthold Lumat model LB 9501 luminometer with a luciferin reagent from Promega. β-Galactosidase assays were performed by a standard colorimetric procedure with 2-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate. The normalized luciferase activity was obtained by dividing the luciferase activity in relative light units by the β-galactosidase activity as described previously (8Sakai J. Nohturfft A.

The purity and concentration of the purified protein were assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis performed with a marker protein followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. Complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to nucleotides −596 to −560, −539 to −520, −525 to −508, −516 to −501, −525 to −482, −433 to −397, −413 to −374, −357 to −339, and −347 to −340 (listed in Table I) were end-labeled with [γ-32 P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and annealed. These double-stranded probes were incubated with recombinant SREBP-1a in a solution containing 22.5 mm Hepes-KOH at pH 7.9, 2.6 mmMgCl2, 13.3% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 0.125 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mg/ml poly(dI-dC) for 20 min at room temperature. For competition analysis, the indicated amount of wild type or mutated double-stranded oligonucleotides was added to the binding mixture as indicated in the figure legends. For the supershift experiments with the Sp1 and Sp3 antibodies, nuclear extracts were prepared as follows. HepG2 cells were set up and cultured as described in the legend to Fig. 10. The cells from 2–4 dishes were pooled and allowed to swell in 0.25 ml of buffer A (20 mm Hepes-KOH at pH 7.9, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 15 min on ice followed by the addition of 0.015 ml of Nonidet P-40 and incubation for another 10 min. The suspension was pelleted by centrifugation at top speed at 4 °C for 30 s. The resulting pellets were resuspended in 0.1 ml of buffer B (20 mmHepes-KOH at pH 7.9, 600 mm KCl, 20 mmZnCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.67 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 30 min. The suspension was gently vortexed for 5 s every 5 min and centrifuged for 20 min at top speed in a microcentrifuge. The resulting supernatant (nuclear extract) was subjected to dialysis in buffer C (20 mm Hepes-KOH at pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm sodium EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). 2 μg of nuclear extracts were then mixed with 4 mg of antibodies and incubated on ice for 1 h, and32P-labeled probe was added to the mixture followed by another 30-min incubation on ice. Protein-DNA complexes were then resolved by electrophoresis through 4.5% polyacrylamide gels for 2 h, and the dried gels were subjected to autoradiography.Table IDouble-stranded oligonucleotides used for gel shift analysesProbeSequence−596/−5605′-GTTCGGTGGGAGACTGTGGAGTGTCACCCAGAAGGAA-3′3′-CAAGCCACCCTCTGACACCTCACAGTGGGTCTTCCTT-5′Mutant 15′-GTTCGGTGGGAGACTGGAATTC GTCACCCAGAAGGAA-3′3′-CAAGCCACCCTCTGACCTTAAG CAGTGGGTCTTCCTT-5′−539/−5205′-TAACTCTGGAGTGACAGGGT-3′3′-ATTGAGACCTCACTGTCCCA-5′Mutant 25′-TAACTCGAATTC GACAGGGT-3′3′-ATTGAGCTTAAG CTGTCCCA-5′−525/−5085′-CAGGGTCACGCAATCAGA-3′3′-GTCCCAGTGCGTTAGTCT-5′Mutant 35′-CAGGGTTCTAGA ATCAGA-3′3′-GTCCCAAGATCT TAGTCT-5′−516/−5015′-GCAATCAGACCACGGTAA-3′3′-CGTTAGTCTGGTGCCATT-5′Mutant 45′-GCAATCATCTAGA GGTAA-3′3′-CGTTAGTAGATCT CCATT-5′−433/−3975′-GTAACCCAACCCTTGTCACTCCAAGACCCTAACTTG-3′3′-CATTGGGTTGGGAACAGTGAGGTTCTGGGATTGAAC-5′Mutant 55′-GTAACCCAACCCTTGCTCGAG CAAGACCCTAACTTG-3′3′-CATTGGGTTGGGAACGAGCTC GTTCTGGGATTGAAC-5′−413/−3745′-CCAAGACCCTAACTTGGTCACTCCACAGCCTTGCCTCCTC-3′3′-GGTTCTGGGATTGAACCAGTGAGGTGTCGGAACGGAGGAG-5′Mutant 65′-CCAAGACCCTAACTTGTGATCGAT ACAGCCTTGCCTCCTC-3′3′-GGTTCTGGGATTGAACACTAGCTA TGTCGGAACGGAGGAG-5′−357/−3395′-CGGGCTACACCCCATCACT-3′3′-GCCCGATGTGGGGTAGTGA-5′Mutant 75′-CGGGCTAA AG CTT ATCACT-3′3′-GCCCGATT TC GAA TAGTGA-5′−347/−3405′-CCCATCACTCCACGGGCC-3′3′-GGGTAGTGAGGTGCCCGG-5′Mutant 85′-CCCTGAT CGAT ACGGGCC-3′3′-GGGACTA GCTA TGCCCGG-5′LDLR SRE-15′-GATCCTGATCACCCCACTGAGGAGGATC-3′3′-CTAGGACTAGTGGGGTGACTCCTCCTAG-5′GC-box A5′-CTCCACAGGGCCCGCCTCCTCGCCT-3′3′-GAGGTGTCCCGGGCGGAGGAGCGGA-5′Bold and underlined base pairs represent the specific mutations in each oligonucleotide.

Whereas norepinephrine (NE) is a potent inducer of ET-1 expression in cardiac myocytes, the signaling pathways that link NE to inducible cardiac ET-1 expression are unknown. Adrenergic stimulation results in an increase in intracellular calcium levels, which in turn activates calcineurin. Here, we have shown that stimulation with NE markedly increased the expression of theET-1 gene in primary cardiac myocytes from neonatal rats. This increase was severely attenuated by a β-adrenergic antagonist, metoprolol, but not by an α-adrenergic antagonist, prazosin. Consistent with these data, the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (ISO) activated the rat ET-1 promoter activity to an extent that was similar to NE. The ISO-stimulated increase in promoter activity was significantly inhibited by a Ca2+-antagonist, nifedipine, and an immunosuppressant, cyclosporin A, which blocks calcineurin. Mutation analysis indicated that the GATA4 binding site is required for ISO-responsive ET-1 transcription. Stimulation with ISO enhanced the interaction between NFATc and GATA4 in cardiac myocytes. Consistent with this interaction, overexpression of GATA4 and NFATc synergistically activated the ET-1 promoter. These findings demonstrate that NE-stimulated ET-1 expression in cardiac myocytes is mediated predominantly via a β-adrenergic pathway, and that calcium-activated calcineurin-GATA4 plays a role in this process.

Later work showed that ET-1 acts not only as a vasoconstrictor but also as a potent growth-promoting peptide. For example, ET-1 can induce myocyte hypertrophy (2Shubeita H.E. McDonough P.M.

Left ventricular levels of ET-1 increase markedly in close association with the deterioration of systolic function following myocardial infarction and pressure overload (8Inada T. Fujiwara H.

ET receptor antagonists bosentan or BQ123 prevent the remodeling of the heart and have been shown to improve survival following myocardial infarction and pressure overload (9Sakai S. Miyauchi T.

These findings demonstrate that upregulated expression of ET-1 in cardiac myocytes plays a critical role in the development of heart failure in vivo. However, the precise mechanisms leading to this upregulation in the failing heart are unclear at present. Because a number of neurohormonal factors are activated in congestive heart failure (11Packer M. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1992; 20: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar, 12Francis G.S. Chon J.N. Johnson G. Rector T.S. Goldman S. Simon A. Circulation. 1993; 87 Suppl. 6: VI40-VI48Google Scholar), they may possibly play positive and negative roles in regulating ET-1 expression in cardiac myocytes. Norepinephrine (NE) is one such factor, of which the elevation in plasma closely is correlated with the severity and poor prognosis of heart failure (12Francis G.S. Chon J.N. Johnson G. Rector T.S. Goldman S. Simon A. Circulation. 1993; 87 Suppl. 6: VI40-VI48Google Scholar). It was shown that NE is a potent inducer of ET-1 expression in cardiac myocytes both in vitro and in vivo (7Yamazaki T.

However, the signaling pathways that link activation of α- and β-adrenergic receptors to inducible cardiac ET-1 expression are unknown. Adrenergic stimulation results in an increase in intracellular calcium levels. The calcium-activated phosphatase calcineurin is necessary for the nuclear import of nuclear factor of activated T lymphocytes (NFAT) transcription factors, which mediate changes in gene expression in response to calcium signaling from the T-cell receptor (reviewed in Ref. 13Rao A.

Abundance of mRNAs were quantified by phosphorimager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Values of prepro-ET-1 mRNA were normalized to those of GAPDH mRNA. The plasmid construct pwtET-CAT was the transcription start site-proximal 204-bp wild-type rat ET-1promoter fused to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene (19Kawana M. Lee M.E.

The cells were then fixed with 3% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min at room temperature.

Aliquots of the extracts containing 100 μg of protein were immunoprecipitated using anti-mouse GATA4 polyclonal antiserum (catalog number SC 1237, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or normal goat IgG in low-stringency buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 16 h at 4 °C and incubated with protein G (Sigma Chemicals) beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The precipitate was washed four times in the same buffer, resuspended in 50 μl of SDS lysis buffer (20 mm Tris pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS, 1 mm dithiothreitol), heated to 95 °C for 2 min, electrophoresed on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (6%), transferred to an immobilon membrane, and reacted with a monoclonal antibody against murine NFATc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), which was subsequently detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Signals were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To confirm the specificity of Western blotting for GATA4, a 5-fold excess of the blocking peptide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was combined with the primary antibody and incubated for 2 h in a small volume of phosphate-buffered saline. Then, antibody/peptide mixture was diluted and reacted with a blotting membrane in a similar protocol. Data are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were performed using unpaired two-tailed Student's t tests or analysis of variance with Scheffe's test when appropriate, with a probability value of less than 0.05 taken to indicate significance. To determine whether stimulation of both α- and β-adrenergic receptors by NE would induce the expression of theET-1 gene in cardiac myocytes, primary cardiac myocytes from neonatal rats were stimulated with saline or 10−6m NE for 24 h. Then, we examined the expression of theET-1 gene by Northern blot using a cDNA probe for the prepro-ET-1 mRNA. We performed these experiments using three independent preparations of cardiac myocytes. As shown in Fig.1, stimulation with NE markedly increased the expression of the ET-1 gene in cardiac myocytes (lane 2) compared with the saline-stimulated state (lane 1). To determine whether the NE-stimulated increase in the ET-1 gene expression is mediated through an α- or β-adrenergic receptor, cardiac myocytes were stimulated with NE in the presence of an α-adrenergic receptor antagonist, prazosin (10−6m), or a β-adrenergic receptor antagonist, metoprolol (10−6m), for 24 h. Administration of prozosin in addition to NE only slightly reducedET-1 gene expression (lane 3). In contrast, administration of metoprolol in addition to NE severely attenuated the expression (lane 4). NE, prazosin, or metoprolol did not alter the expression of the ubiquitously and constitutively expressedGAPDH gene. We confirmed that in our preparation, more than 90% of the NE-stimulated cells were positive for staining with HHF35, which recognizes the α-actin of cardiac muscle cells but not that of fibroblasts. These data indicate that NE, an important neurohormonal factor activated in congestive heart failure, is a potent inducer ofET-1 gene expression in cardiac myocytes and that NE-responsive ET-1 expression is mediated predominantly through a β-adrenergic receptor-dependent pathway. To determine if transcriptional activation could account for the stimulation of ET-1 expression by NE in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes, these myocytes were transfected with a CAT reporter construct driven by the 204-bp rat ET-1 upstream sequence (pwtET-CAT). To control for transfection efficiency, the cells were cotransfected with a small quantity of pRSVluc. After 24 h of stimulation with 10−6m NE or saline as a control, cardiomyocytes were harvested for luciferase and CAT assays. The 204-bp ET-1 promoter fragment conferred NE-inducible expression on the CAT reporter gene (Fig.2). In contrast, NE stimulation did not induce the activity of a promoter derived from the ubiquitously expressed β-actin gene (data not shown). The increase in the activity of the ET-1 promoter suggests that NE stimulation ofET-1 expression in cardiac myocytes is mediated, at least in part, through a transcriptional mechanism and that the 204-bp promoter sequence of the ET-1 gene contains important elements that mediate NE-responsive transcription. NE can activate α- and β-adrenergic receptors in cardiac myocytes. To determine whether the NE-stimulated increase in the ET-1promoter activity is mediated through these receptors, cardiac myocytes were transfected with pwtET-CAT/pRSVluc and then stimulated with NE in the presence of an α-adrenergic receptor antagonist, prazosin (10−6m), or a β-adrenergic receptor antagonist, metoprolol (10−6m) for 24 h. NE-stimulated ET-1 promoter activity was severely attenuated by metoprolol (Fig. 2, lane 3) but not by prazosin (Fig. 2,lane 4). Consistent with these data, the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (ISO, 10−6m) activated the ET-1 promoter to an extent similar to that of activation by NE (Fig. 3, lane 4). These findings indicate that NE-responsive ET-1 transcription in cardiac myocytes is mediated predominantly through a β-adrenergic receptor-dependent pathway. Stimulation with β-adrenergic agonists results in an increase in intracellular calcium levels. To determine whether the calcium-activated phosphatase calcineurin is involved in ISO-responsiveET-1 transcription in cardiac myocytes, these myocytes were transfected with pwtET-CAT and a small quantity of pRSVluc and then exposed to saline or ISO in the presence and absence of a Ca2+ antagonist, nifedipine or an immunosuppressant, cyclosporin A (Cys A), which blocks the activation of calcineurin. Twenty-four hours later, luciferase and CAT activities were assessed in lysates from these cells. As shown in Fig. 3, the ISO-stimulated increase in the ET-1 promoter activity was significantly inhibited by nifedipine (lane 5) and Cys A (lane 6). However, neither nifedipine nor Cys A affected the basal level of the ET-1 promoter activity (lanes 2 and3), indicating that these agents specifically blocked the ISO-mediated pathway. These findings demonstrate that the calcium-activated calcineurin pathway is, in part, involved in β-adrenergic agonist-responsive ET-1 transcription in cardiac myocytes. To examine whether the reduction of ET-1 transcriptional activity results in the change of ET-1 production in cardiac myocytes, we performed immunocytochemistry for ET-1. ISO stimulation was not sufficient to induce an increase in cell size in our experimental system. However, as shown in Fig. 4, brown positive signals indicating ET-1 was stronger in ISO-stimulated cardiac myocytes (B) than in saline-stimulated cells (A). The specificity of the staining was confirmed by its disappearance with addition of an excess of synthetic ET-1 (C). Treatment with nifedipine (D) and Cys A (E) significantly reduced the staining intensity. These findings demonstrate that the calcium-activated calcineurin pathway is, in part, involved in the β-adrenergic agonist-stimulated increase in ET-1 synthesis in cardiac myocytes as well as ET-1 transcription in these cells. Activated calcineurin dephosphorylates NF-AT transcription factors, which then translocate to the nucleus and interact with the cardiac zinc finger protein GATA4 (14Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar). Because the 204-bp ratET-1 promoter sequence contains a binding site for GATA4, we investigated the role of this site in ISO-responsive ET-1 transcription. Neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were transfected with aCAT gene driven by the 204-bp ET-1 promoter containing a mutation in the GATA site (pmutGATA-ET-CAT), which abolishes the binding of cardiac GATA4 (23Wilson D.B. Dorfman D.M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4854-4862Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5, the mutation of the GATA element within the 204-bp ET-1 promoter caused a modest decrease in the basal transcriptional activity and abolished ISO-responsive transcription. Thus, GATA4 plays a critical role for ISO-responsive ET-1 transcription in cardiac myocytes. To examine nuclear translocation of endogenous NFATc in response to ISO treatment in cardiac myocytes, we performed immunofluorescence. As shown in Fig.6, NFATc was detected in cytoplasm of nearly all saline-stimulated cardiac myocytes (A). However, the stimulation of cardiac myocytes with ISO markedly changed this localization and caused the nuclear translocation of NFATc (B). ISO-mediated translocation was reversed by Cys A (C), suggesting that calcineurin activation is required for this translocation. To determine whether NFATc in cardiac myocytes is dephosphorylated by β-adrenergic stimulation, we performed Western blotting. Neonatal cardiac myocytes were stimulated with ISO or saline as a control for 45 min, and then whole cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting using the anti-NFATc antibody and anti-GATA4 antibody. As shown in Fig.7, the expression level of NFATc and GATA4 in whole cell lysates did not differ between saline- and ISO-stimulated cardiac myocytes and was not altered by Cys A. However, NFATc in cardiac myocytes was converted to the high-mobility form following ISO stimulation. This conversion was reversed by the administration of Cys A, which blocks calcineurin. Because dephosphorylated NFATc migrates faster than phosphorylated NFATc (24Ruff V.A. Leach K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22602-22607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), the conversion of NFATc to the high mobility form might indicate dephosphorylation of NFATc by ISO stimulation. To determine whether the interaction between NFATc and GATA4 in cardiac myocytes is modulated by β-adrenergic stimulation, we performed immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting. Neonatal cardiac myocytes were stimulated with ISO or saline as a control for 3 h, and then nuclear extracts derived from these cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-NFATc antibody as a positive control (Fig. 8, lane 4), IgG as a negative control (Fig. 8, lane 1) or an anti-GATA4 antibody (Fig. 8, lanes 2 and 3). Western blotting using the anti-NFATc antibody showed that the anti-GATA4 antibody (Fig. 8,lanes 2 and 3), but not IgG (Fig. 8, lane 1) coprecipitated NFATc protein in nuclear extracts from cardiac myocytes stimulated with ISO, even after extensive washing. However, the anti-GATA-4 antibody coprecipitated a smaller amount of NFATc in nuclear extracts from saline-stimulated myocytes (Fig. 8, lane 2) than in extracts from ISO-stimulated cells (Fig. 8, lane 3). The expression level of GATA4 did not differ between saline- and ISO-stimulated cells. Addition of the blocking peptide eliminated the band, confirming the specificity of anti-GATA4 antibody. Thus, stimulation with ISO increased the complex of NFATc/GATA4 in cardiac myocytes. The fact that NFATc can bind to GATA4 suggests that these two proteins might co-activate the transcriptional activity of the ET-1 gene. To test this hypothesis, we performed transient transfection assays in COS7 cells, which express neither NFATc nor GATA4. We cotransfected the ET-1 reporter plasmid together with GATA4 or NFATc expression vector alone, or in combination with both vectors. Total amounts of transfected DNA were kept constant by cotransfecting the β-galactosidase expression vector. Then these cells were incubated in a serum-free condition in the presence of ISO. Forty-eight hours later, we measured the ET-1 reporter activity. The transfection of the GATA4-expressing vector or the NFATc-expressing vector alone produced only a minimal stimulation of transcription in these cells (Fig. 9,lanes 2 and 3, respectively). The coexpression of NFATc and GATA4 induced a significant stimulation of the reporter (Fig.9, lane 4) compared with the level observed with GATA4 or NFATc alone. To check the expression level of NFATc and GATA4 in COS7 cells transfected with expression vectors encoding these proteins, we performed Western blotting in these cells. As shown in Fig. 9, GATA4 and NFATc were abundantly expressed in COS7 cells transfected with each corresponding expression vector, but absent in cells transfected with the β-galactosidase expression vector instead of the GATA4- or NFATc expression vector. In addition, cotransfection of both GATA4 and NFATc expression vectors did not alter the respective levels of expression compared with that after transfection of either expression vector alone. Therefore, the effect of co-expression of NFATc and GATA4 on enhanced ET-1 transcriptional activity cannot be explained by an artificial mechanism. Taken together with the fact that NFATc can bind to GATA4, these results suggest that these two proteins co-operatively work in the transcriptional activation of theET-1 gene. Although ET-1 was initially identified as an endothelial cell-derived vasoconstrictor, it is now recognized as a growth-promoting peptide produced by a variety of cell types. Expression of ET-1 in cardiac myocytes is markedly increased in failing hearts (8Inada T. Fujiwara H. Hasegawa K. Araki M. Yamauchi-Kohno R. Yabana H. Fujiwara T. Tanaka M. Sasayama S. J. Am. Coll.

Circulation. 1998; 98: 2065-2073Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In addition, the administration of ET receptor antagonists prevents remodeling of the heart following myocardial infarction and pressure overload independent of hemodynamic effects (9Sakai S. Miyauchi T. Kobayashi M. Yamaguchi I. Goto K. Sugishita K. Nature. 1996; 384: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar,10Iwanaga Y. Kihara Y. Hasegawa K. Inagaki K. Kaburagi S. Araki M. Sasayama S. Circulation. 1998; 98: 2065-2073Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the local synthesis of ET-1 is involved in the development of heart failure in vivo. However, the precise mechanisms that mediate the up-regulation of ET-1 expression in the failing heart are unknown. NE is an important neurohormonal factor activated in congestive heart failure and a potent inducer of ET-1 expression in cardiac myocytes (7Yamazaki T. Komuro I. Kudoh S. Zou Y. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Mizuno T. Maemura K. Kurihara H. Aikawa R. Takano T. Yazaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3221-3228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The major conclusions of the present study are: 1) stimulation of ET-1 expression by NE in cardiac myocytes is mediated predominantly via a β-adrenergic pathway, and 2) calcium-activated calcineurin-GATA4 plays a role in β-adrenergic agonist-stimulated ET-1transcription in cardiac myocytes. NE exerts its effects on cardiac myocytes via both α- and β-adrenergic receptor pathways. Using primary neonatal rat cardiac myocytes, we showed that NE markedly stimulated the rat ET-1promoter activity and that this stimulation was severely attenuated by the β-adrenergic receptor blocker metoprolol but not by the α-adrenergic receptor blocker prazosin. In addition, ET-1promoter activity was activated by the β-adrenergic agonist ISO to an extent similar to the activation by NE. These findings indicate that NE-inducible expression of ET-1 in cardiac myocytes is controlled, at least in part, at the level of transcription and that NE stimulation of ET-1 transcription is mediated predominantly via a β-adrenergic pathway. β-adrenergic stimulation results in an increase in the intracellular calcium level. The present study demonstrated that β-adrenergic agonist-stimulated ET-1 transcription was significantly inhibited by the calcium antagonist nifedipine. This finding suggests that calcium signaling may be involved in this process. However, the inhibition by nifedipine was not complete. Nifedipine blocks the entry of extracellular calcium into the cytosol but does not block the release of calcium from the sarcoplastic reticulum. Therefore, the partial effect of nifedipine on β-adrenergic agonist-stimulated ET-1 transcription might be attributable to incomplete blockage of the increase in the intracellular calcium level. To clarify the precise role of calcium signaling, measurement of the intracellular calcium level, and complete blockage of the increase of the calcium level are needed. A sufficient increase of the calcium level activates calcineurin, a ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine phosphatase, by binding the 19-kDa regulatory subunit of calcineurin (25Stemmer P.M. Klee C.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6859-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Calcineurin dephosphorylates NFAT transcription factors, which enables them to translocate to the nucleus (13Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2209) Google Scholar, 14Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N.

Cys A binds the immunophilin cyclophilin and forms a complex that binds the calcineurin catalytic subunit, thereby inhibiting calcineurin's ability to activate NFAT transcription factors (26Shaw K.T.Y. Ho A.M. Raghavan A. Kim J. Jian J. Park J. Sharma S. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11205-11209Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 27Lee J.P. Palfrey H.C.

The present study demonstrated that Cys A significantly but not completely inhibited β-adrenergic agonist-stimulated ET-1 transcription in cardiac myocytes. We used a physiological concentration of Cys A, which has been shown to specifically block calcineurin activation. Use of a higher dose of Cys A did not augment its ability to inhibit ET-1 transcription (data not shown). These results demonstrate that calcineurin activation is, in part, involved in β-adrenergic-stimulated ET-1transcription, while the results also suggest the existence of alternative pathways. GATA4 is a cardiac-restricted zinc finger protein that plays an important role in cardiac-specific transcription (28Ip H.S. Wilson D.B. Heikinheimo M. Tang Z. Ting C. Simon M.C. Leiden J.M.

In addition, GATA4 is required for transcriptional activation of the genes for β-myosin heavy chain and angiotensin II type 1a receptor during hemodynamic overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy in vivo(20Hasegawa K. Lee S.J. Jobe S.M. Markham B.E. Kitsis R.N. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3943-3953Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 32Herzig, T. C., Jobe, S. M., Aoki, H., Molkentin, J. D., Cowley, A. W., Izumo, S., and Markham, B. E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 94, 7543–7548Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that mutating the GATA4 binding site abolished β-adrenergic agonist-responsiveET-1 transcription, suggesting a critical role for GATA4 in this process. Downstream of calcineurin, GATA4 interacts with high affinity and specificity with NFAT transcription factors (14Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar). Consistent with this interaction, we showed that NFATc and GATA4 co-activated the ET-1 promoter. In addition, β-adrenergic stimulation increased NFATc/GATA4 complex in cardiac myocytes. All of these data suggest that a calcineurin-GATA4 pathway controls transcription of the ET-1 gene in cardiac myocytes and is involved in β-adrenergic agonist-responsive ET-1transcription in these cells. The rat ET-1 promoter we have used does not contain NFATc consensus sequences. NFATc alone was not able to activate theET-1 promoter (see Fig. 9, lane 3). However, NFATc further activated GATA4-dependent ET-1transcription. It is unclear at present how NFATc activates theET-1 transcription without directly binding to the promoter DNA. Because NFATc can interact with GATA4, one possibility might be that the interaction modifies GATA4 post-translationally. For example, we reported that a phosphorylated form of GATA4 increases its DNA binding ability (16Morimoto T Hasegawa K Kaburagi S Kakita T Wada H Yanazume T Sasayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13721-13726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Further studies are needed to clarify precise mechanisms by which NFATc activates GATA4-mediated ET-1transcription. Although ET-1 was initially identified as an endothelial cell-derived vasoconstrictor, it is now recognized as a growth-promoting peptide produced by a variety of cell types. A recent study suggested a role of ET-1 produced by cardiac fibroblasts in myocardial cell hypertrophy (33Harada M. Itoh H. Nakagawa O. Ogawa Y. Miyamoto Y. Kuwahara K. Ogawa E. Igaki T. Yamashita J. Masuda I. Yoshimasa T. Tanaka I. Saito Y. Nakao K. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3737-3744Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In our preparation, more than 90% of cells consist of cardiac myocytes as identified by immunostaining with HHF35, which recognizes α-actin of cardiac myocytes but not that of other cell types. Although GATA4 is specifically expressed in the heart and endodermal derivatives (21Arceci R.J. King A.A.J. Simon M.C. Orkin S.H. Wilson D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2235-2246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Ip H.S. Wilson D.B. Heikinheimo M. Tang Z. Ting C. Simon M.C. Leiden J.M. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7517-7526Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), it should be further investigated whether a calcineurin-GATA4 pathway represents a common or cell type-specific mechanism for the induction of ET-1 expression. Calcineurin-GATA4 is involved in the transcriptional pathways that modulate cardiac hypertrophy (14Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar). Inhibition of calcineurin by Cys A is sufficient to block cardiac hypertrophy in a transgenic animal model of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (34Sussman M.A. Lim H.W. Gude N. Taigen T. Olson E.N. Robbins J. Colbert M.C. Gualberto A. Wieczorek D.F. Molkentin J.D. Science. 1998; 281: 1690-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). A calcineurin pathway appears to be involved in the development of heart failure in some animal models, whereas it is still being debated whether calcineurin plays a critical role in this process (35Walsh R.A. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 741-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrated that calcineurin-GATA4 is involved in the activation of ET-1transcription in cardiac myocytes. Because ET-1 is one of the local factors that play important roles in the development of heart failure, our findings provide further insights into the role of calcineurin in heart failure in vivo. However, several limitations should be taken into account when the data of this study are applied to thein vivo setting in the adult. First, as myocardial development is not complete at birth, differences may exist between neonatal and adult cardiac myocytes. Second, the biological properties of disassociated myocytes in culture and myocytes in the organized heart in vivo may differ. Therefore, it would be of particular interest to clarify the role of calcineurin in the activation of the myocardial ET-1 pathway during the development of heart failure in vivo. We thank N. Sowa for his excellent technical assistance."

Theets transcription factor, TEL, undergoes translocations with several distinct tyrosine kinases including JAK2. TEL-JAK2 transforms cell lines to factor independence, and constitutive tyrosine kinase activity results in the phosphorylation of several substrates including STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5. In this study we have shown that TEL-JAK2 can constitutively activate the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI 3′-kinase) signaling pathway. The regulatory subunit of PI 3′-kinase, p85, associates with TEL-JAK2 in immunoprecipitations, and this was shown to be mediated by the amino-terminal SH2 domain of p85 but independent of a putative p85-binding motif within TEL-JAK2. The scaffolding protein Gab2 can also mediate the association of p85. TEL-JAK2 constitutively phosphorylates the downstream substrate protein kinase B/AKT. Importantly, the pharmacologic PI 3′-kinase inhibitor, LY294002, blocked TEL-JAK2 factor-independent growth and phosphorylation of protein kinase B. However, LY294002 did not alter STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation, indicating that STAT5 and protein kinase B activation mediated by TEL-JAK2 are independent signaling pathways.

The scaffolding protein Gab2 can also mediate the association of p85. TEL-JAK2 constitutively phosphorylates the downstream substrate protein kinase B/AKT. Importantly, the pharmacologic PI 3′-kinase inhibitor, LY294002, blocked TEL-JAK2 factor-independent growth and phosphorylation of protein kinase B. However, LY294002 did not alter STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation, indicating that STAT5 and protein kinase B activation mediated by TEL-JAK2 are independent signaling pathways. Therefore, activation of the PI 3′-kinase signaling pathway is an important event mediated by TEL-JAK2 chromosomal translocations. interleukin-3 phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase protein kinase B nucleotide sodium 3,3′-{1-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-3,4-tetrazolium)bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro)benzene sulfonic acid hydrate} glutathione S-transferase horseradish peroxidase polyvinylidene difluoride bovine serum albumin polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis LY249002 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one phosphatidylinositol 7-aminoactinomycin D nucleotide Chromosomal translocations play a central role in the development of leukemia. The participating genes generally fall into three groups involving tyrosine kinases, transcription factors, or factors that modify transcriptional activation (1Gilliland D.G.

TEL-JAK2 translocations have been described in three patients to date. Two patients, each harboring primary translocations, were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. One patient expressed a fusion of TEL exon 4 to JAK2 exon 17 (t(9;12)(p24;p13); TEL-JAK2-(4–17)) (9Peeters P. Raynaud S.D. Cools J. Wlodarska I. Grosgeorge J. Philip P. Monpoux F. Van Rompaey L.

The third isolated TEL-JAK2 product arose from a compound t(9;12;15)(p24;q15;p13) translocation in which one allele of TEL was fused to JAK2 (TEL-JAK2-(5–12)) (9Peeters P. Raynaud S.D. Cools J.

BCR-ABL also has been shown to participate in pathways that are involved in the prevention of apoptosis. For example, BCR-ABL activates the PI 3′-kinase signaling pathway (31Skorski T. Kanakaraj P.

Recent studies have shown that the PI 3′-kinase inhibitor, LY294002, blocks growth of BCR-ABL-expressing hematopoietic cells (32Neshat M.S. Raitano A.B. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Sawyers C.L. Mol. Cell.

PI 3′-kinases are important modulators of cell survival, mitogenesis, cytoskeletal remodeling, metabolic control, and vesicular trafficking (reviewed in Ref. 33Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). There are three classes of these enzymes. Class I PI 3′-kinases are heterodimers consisting of a 110-kDa catalytic subunit and a 85-kDa regulatory subunit. Binding of the p85 subunit to phosphotyrosines stimulates activity of the associated p110 subunit (34Backer J.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Shoelson S.E. Chin D.J. Sun X.J. Miralpeix M. Hu P. Margolis B.

The two SH2 domains of p85 can interact with phosphorylated tyrosines on activated receptor tyrosine kinases or on adaptor proteins such as Gab2 (37Gu H. Pratt J.C. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Mol.

The activation of PI 3′-kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) lipids on the D3-hydroxy group generating products such as PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. These lipids can modulate the subcellular localization and activation of a number of proteins. The serine/threonine kinase, Akt/PKB, is one well studied target of PI 3′-kinase activation implicated in mediating signals for cell survival and growth (reviewed in Ref. 39Coffer P.J. Jin J.

In summation, these elegant studies have shown that signaling pathways distinct from STAT5a/b activation play a role in leukemogenesis mediated by TEL-JAK2. The goal of this study is to characterize PI 3′-kinase-dependent signaling mitigated by TEL-JAK2. Constructs were generated as described. 2J. M.-Y. Ho, M. H.-H. Nguyen, B. K. Beattie, and D. L.

G418-resistant populations were selected, and subclones were isolated by limiting dilution. The expression of TEL-JAK2 and BCR-ABL was confirmed by immunoblotting, and the IL-3-dependent growth characteristics of each subclone was confirmed by performing an XTT assay. XTT assays were performed as described (40Ho J.M. Beattie B.K. Squire J.A. Frank D.A. Barber D.L. Blood. 1999; 93: 4354-4364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Barber D.L. DeMartino J.C. Showers M.O.

Cytokine-depleted cells (2000/well) were added to a 96-well plate in a final volume of 100 µl containing complete media with varying concentrations of LY294002 and a constant concentration of IL-3. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h prior to addition of sodium 3,3′-{1-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-3,4-tetrazolium)bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro)benzene sulfonic acid hydrate} (XTT) (2 mg/ml) (Diagnostic Chemicals) and phenazine methosulfate (3 µm) (Sigma) (final volume of 125 µl). Cells were incubated for an additional 4 h at 37 °C prior to measuring the absorption of the soluble formazan reduction product at 450 nm. Cells were depleted of cytokine by washing three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) and incubating at 37 °C for 18 h in complete media. Cells were then stimulated in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml IL-3 in complete media for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed once in cold Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mmsodium fluoride, 10 mm EDTA, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Lysates were prepared in ice-cold lysis buffer, containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mmNaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 µm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 µmaprotinin, 1 µm leupeptin, and 2 µmpepstatin A, incubated for 10 min on ice, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Lysate concentrations were quantified by the Bradford colorimetric method (Bio-Rad). For immunoblot analyses of lysates, 100 µg of lysate was boiled for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer with 100 µm dithiothreitol (DTT). Samples were then resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to PVDF transfer membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). 2-(4-Morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one (LY249002) (Calbiochem) was resuspended in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) (Fisher) to a final concentration of 65.06 mm. Preparation of cellular protein lysates for inhibitor studies is exactly as described for the preparation of cellular protein lysates with an additional incubation step; prior to murine IL-3 stimulation, cells were incubated with 10 or 20 µmLY294002 or carrier alone for 30 min.

Phospho-STAT5 antibody was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA, and anti-STAT5 antibody was generously provided by Dr. James Ihle, St. Jude's Childrens Hospital, Memphis, TN. A peptide-specific anti-TEL antibody was generated using a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled peptide corresponding to amino acids 138–154 of TEL. Immunoblotting secondary reagents used were horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated protein A or HRP-conjugated sheep anti-mouse immunoglobulin obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Immunoprecipitations were performed with 1.5 mg of protein lysates. Primary antibody was added for 1 h, followed by 1-h incubation with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Alternatively, primary antibody and protein A-Sepharose was added together, and incubations were performed overnight. Bead-bound immune complexes were washed 3 times with ice-cold lysis buffer, eluted by boiling for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 µm DTT, and separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF transfer membrane for immunoblotting. GST fusion proteins (2.5 µg) expressing the amino, carboxyl, or both amino- and carboxyl-terminal SH2 domains of p85 (generously provided by Dr. Ben Margolis, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI) or GST alone immobilized to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were incubated with 1.5 mg of protein lysates. After a 1-h incubation at 4 °C, the precipitate was washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer with 100 µm DTT to elute proteins before separation on SDS-PAGE gels and transfer to PVDF transfer membrane. For most immunoblotting experiments, membranes were blocked at room temperature with 2.5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl) for 1 h. Following two washes in TBST (TBS, 0.1% Tween 20), membranes were incubated with the appropriate dilution of primary antibody solution for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then washed four times in TBST and incubated with the relevant HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution in TBST) for 30 min. Following four washes in TBST, reactive proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with autoradiographic film (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). PVDF membranes for phospho-PKB and PKB immunoblots were blocked in 5% skim milk in TBST for 1 h at room temperature, washed once in primary antibody dilution buffer, and incubated with primary antibody (1:1000 dilution in 1% BSA in TBST) overnight at 4 °C. After six washes in TBST, the membrane was incubated with HRP-protein A (1:2000 dilution in 2.5% skim milk in TBST) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed 6 times in TBST and visualized by ECL. Membranes for phospho-STAT5 immunoblots were blocked in 5% milk in TBST for 1 h at room temperature, washed 2 times in TBST, and incubated with primary antibody (1:1000 dilution in 3% BSA in TBST) for 3 h at room temperature. After 4 washes in TBST, the membrane was incubated with HRP-protein A (1:5000 dilution in 2.5% BSA in TBST) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed 4 times in TBST prior to visualization by ECL. For reprobing, membranes were stripped in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, and 0.1m β-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50 °C and rinsed twice in TBST. Annexin V, 7AAD, and 10× binding buffer were purchased from PharMingen. Briefly, at distinct time points, untreated and treated cells were washed in 1× binding buffer (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2). 1 × 106 cells were then resuspended in 50 µl of 1× binding buffer and incubated with 2 µl of annexin V antibody conjugated to PE for 10 min at room temperature. Samples were adjusted to a final phycoerythrin volume of 1 ml prior to fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (Becton Dickinson). Acquisition and analysis were performed using the CellQuest software. TEL-JAK2 isoforms have been constructed with breakpoints as described from patient samples (9Peeters P. Raynaud S.D. Cools J.

These constructs were introduced into the murine IL-3-dependent myeloid cell line Ba/F3 via electroporation. TEL-JAK2-(4–17), TEL-JAK2-(5–19), and TEL-JAK2-(5–12) subclones were isolated by limiting dilution, and those displaying similar expression were selected for further characterization. Expression of TEL-JAK2 in Ba/F3 cells resulted in factor-independent proliferation and constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of each fusion protein in all subclones, consistent with previous reports (10Lacronique V.

In addition, oncogenic tyrosine kinase fusions have been shown to activate PI 3′-kinase. The transforming ability of BCR-ABL has been shown to require the PI 3′-kinase signaling pathway and activation of the serine-threonine kinase PKB (45Skorski T. Bellacosa A. Nieborowska-Skorska M. Majewski M. Martinez R. Choi J.K. Trotta R. Wlodarski P. Perrotti D. Chan T.O. Wasik M.A. Tsichlis P.N. Calabretta B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6151-6161Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). PKB is one downstream component of the PI 3′-kinase signaling pathway important in influencing cell survival. We were interested in determining whether TEL-JAK2 mediated PKB activation (Fig.2). Since the phosphorylation of PKB is associated with its activation (46Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar), activation-specific antibodies have been developed that detect PKB phosphorylated at Ser-473. IL-3 stimulation of Ba/F3 cells led to a strong activation of PKB phosphorylation (lane 2). TEL-JAK2-(4–17) stimulated a level of PKB phosphorylation in the absence of IL-3 stimulation (lane 3) that was higher than that in unstimulated Ba/F3 cells (lane 1). Expression of TEL-JAK2-(5–12) and TEL-JAK2-(5–19) in Ba/F3 cells resulted in higher levels of constitutive PKB phosphorylation (lanes 5 and 7, respectively). Ba/F3 cells expressing BCR-ABL also stimulated PKB phosphorylation in the absence of IL-3 (lane 9). Upon IL-3 stimulation, all cell lines exhibited comparable levels of PKB phosphorylation (even lanes). Equal loading was confirmed by reprobing the blot with a total PKB antibody (lower panel). This experiment demonstrated that TEL-JAK2 expression constitutively activates PKB phosphorylation. To determine whether TEL-JAK2-mediated factor-independent growth was dependent on PI 3′-kinase, we performed XTT assays in the absence or presence of IL-3 (100 pg/ml) and increasing concentrations of the PI 3′-kinase inhibitor, LY294002 (47Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). A reduction in the number of Ba/F3 and all TEL-JAK2-expressing Ba/F3 cells was observed with increasing LY294002 concentrations (upper panel), even in the presence of IL-3 (lower panel). Subclones of Ba/F3 cells expressing vector alone had identical kinetics as untransfected Ba/F3 cells (data not shown). Moreover, this decrease in cell number was not seen in the presence of the carrier, Me2SO (data not shown). These results suggest that TEL-JAK2, and IL-3 (48Craddock B.L. Orchiston E.A. Hinton H.J.

In this study we tested whether Gqα- and/or G13α-induced PYK2 activation contributes to GPCR-mediated NF-κB activation.

G-protein-coupled receptor nuclear factor phosphoinositide 3-kinase muscarinic receptor type 1 Bruton's tyrosine kinase Many hormones, sensory stimuli, neurotransmitters, and chemokines stimulate heptahelical receptors, which through their activation of heterotrimeric G-proteins modify the activities of intracellular enzymes and ion channels (reviewed in Ref. 1Kehrl J.H. Immunity. 1998; 8: 1-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Some of the known direct effectors of heterotrimeric G-proteins include adenylyl cyclases, phospholipase Cβ, guanine nucleotide exchange factors, and several tyrosine kinases. The direct effectors of G-protein activation in turn activate additional molecules including the protein kinase cascades that activate mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1 and ERK2, p38, and stress-activated protein kinases (also referred to as Jun kinases). Through these signaling pathways G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 connect extracellular stimuli to alterations in gene transcription. For example, signaling through several GPCRs activates the transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-κB, thereby modulating the transcription of those genes with NF-κB-binding sites within their regulatory regions. Among the GPCR agonists that induce NF-κB activation are chemoattractants, endothelins, lysophosphatidic acid, and bradykinin (2Kravchenko V.V. Pan Z. Han J. Herbert J.M. Ulevitch R.J. Ye R.D. J.

A dimeric sequence-specific transcription factor NF-κB activates a large number of inflammatory and stress-related genes (reviewed in Ref.7Karin M. Delhase M. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Sequestered in the cytoplasm in an inactive form bound to IκB, NF-κB awaits inflammatory stimuli that lead to the phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and proteolytic degradation of IκB, thereby freeing NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus to transactivate target genes. The multisubunit IκB kinase complex responsible for phosphorylating IκB is a focal point for most of the stimuli that activate NFκB. For example, bradykinin-mediated NF-κB activation proceeds from the receptor through Gq, which leads to phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt activation, and ultimately to the IκB kinase complex (6Xie P. Browning D.D. Hay N. Mackman N. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24907-24914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The first appreciation that a PI3K- and Akt-dependent pathway can lead to NF-κB activation arose from studies of Akt in lymphocytes, of platelet-derived growth factor anti-apoptotic signaling in fibroblasts, and tumor necrosis factor signaling in HEK 293 cells (8Shapiro P. V.S. Stokoe D. Weiss A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 601-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar, 9Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S.

Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar). Akt-induced NF-κB activation occurs at least in part at the level of degradation of the IκB. Indicating that Akt targets the IκB kinases upon platelet-derived growth factor stimulation Akt transiently associates with IκB kinases and induces their activation. In the absence of one of the NF-κB subunits, p50, a subset of B lymphocytes termed marginal zone B cells fail to develop (11Cariappa A. Liou H.C. Horwitz B.H. Pillai S. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1175-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These cells reside at the margin between the white and red pulp in the spleen and have a critical role in the humoral response to bacterial pathogens. Marginal zone B cells are also lacking in mice deficient for the tyrosine kinase PYK2 (12Guinamard R. Okigaki M. Schlessinger J. Ravetch J.V. Nat. Immun. 2000; 1: 31-36Crossref Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Because some GPCR agonists including certain chemokines can trigger increased PYK2 kinase activity (13Dikic I. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14301-14308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 14Avraham H. Park S.Y. Schinkmann K. Avraham S. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), PYK2 signaling to NF-κB could provide a unifying hypothesis to explain the requirement for PYK2 and NF-κB in the generation of marginal zone B cells or in recruitment to their microenvironment. Therefore we sought to examine whether PYK2 activation can lead to NF-κB activation and to determine the importance of PYK2 in G-protein-mediated NF-κB activation. Expression vectors for the Giα2Q204L (QL), GsαQ227L (QL), GqαQ209L (QL), G12αQ229L (QL), G13αQ226L (QL), RhoA QL, RhoA T19N (N19), Gβ1, Gγ2, and M1R were kindly provided by Dr. S. Gutkind (National Institutes of Health). The Myc-PYK2 expression vector was kindly provided by Dr. S. Earp (University of North Carolina). The pCMV5 hemagglutinin Akt wild type and pCMV5 hemagglutinin Akt kinase-dead form were kindly provided by Dr P. N. Tsichlis (Kimmel Cancer Institute, Thomas Jefferson University). The NF-κB-luciferase reporter gene plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Ulrich Siebenlist (National Institutes of Health). The following antibodies were purchased: PYK2 (Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA); hemagglutinin and Myc (Babco, Richmond, CA); FLAG (Sigma); G13, Gqα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); and pAkt (S473) (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). HeLa cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected using SuperFect (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) in six-well plates. The collected cells were lysed in 200 µl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) for 20 min on ice. After centrifugation, 20 µl of the supernatant was tested for β-galactosidase activity using galactan chemiluminescent substrate (Tropix, Bedford, MA) or luciferase activity using a luciferase substrate (Promega). Data from all the transfection assays were normalized using the activity of Rous sarcoma virus β-galactosidase (0.1 µg). Each reporter gene assay was performed in duplicate. HeLa cell lysates were prepared using Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega) for 20 min on ice. The detergent-insoluble material was removed by micro-centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts of protein from each sample were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to pure nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked with 10% milk in TTBS (Tween 20, Tris, base, salt) for 1 h and then incubated with an appropriate dilution of the primary antibody in 5% milk and 0.05% sodium azide in TTBS overnight. The blots were washed twice with TTBS before the addition of a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) diluted 1:5000 in TTBS containing 3% albumin bovine. Following a 1-h incubation, the blot was washed twice with TTBS and then incubated with streptavidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (DAKO) diluted 1:10,000 in TTBS containing 3% albumin bovine. The signal was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) following the recommendations of the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HeLa cells (2 × 105/well) were seeded in six-well (35 mm) plates. After overnight, the cells were transfected as described above with different plasmids as indicated. Before harvesting, the cells were starved with 0.5% serum medium for 24 h. The cells lysates were prepared using a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmNa3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 1 µm microcystin, and 1% Triton X-100 with a mixture of protease inhibitors on ice for 30 min. Equal amounts of protein from each sample were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to pure nitrocellulose. The membranes were analyzed by blotting with the pAkt (S473) antibody. Because HeLa cells express PYK2 (15Shi C.S. Sinnarajah S. Cho H. Kozasa T. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24470-24476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and can be easily transfected, we used them to examine the PYK2 involvement in G-protein signaling to NF-κB activation. First we determined which G-proteins stimulate NF-κB-dependent transcription in these cells. We found that an NF-κB-dependent reporter responded well to constructs that direct the expression of G13αQL or GqαQL, but minimally to constructs that express G12αQL, Giα2QL, or GsαQL (Fig. 1A). The expression of the Gβγ subunits Gβ1 and Gγ2 also induced the reporter gene. We tested a range of plasmid concentrations, and the GTPase-deficient forms of Gqα and G13α consistently outperformed the other G-protein constructs. To directly test whether PYK2 activates the NF-κB-dependent reporter we transfected HeLa cells with increasing concentration of a PYK2 expression vector. PYK2 caused a significant increase in reporter gene activity although less that what we had observed with either GTPase-deficient G13α or Gqα (Fig. 1 A). Since the same GTPase-deficient Gα subunits that enhanced the NF-κB-dependent reporter also potently activate PYK2 (15Shi C.S. Sinnarajah S. Cho H. Kozasa T. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24470-24476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), we tested the combinations of PYK2 with G13αQL and of PYK2 with GqαQL on induction of NF-κB reporter gene activity. We found that the combination of G13αQL with PYK2 potently activated the reporter gene while the combination of GqαQL with PYK2 was less effective although still a good activator (Fig.1 B). Because the activation of NF-κB by the bradykinin receptor involves both PI3K and Akt (6Xie P. Browning D.D. Hay N. Mackman N. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24907-24914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), we tested whether PYK2 could activate Akt and whether PYK2-induced NF-κB activation required Akt and PI3K activation. To assess Akt activation we used an Akt phosphoserine-specific antibody that recognizes phosphoserine 473. Akt is activated by phospholipid binding and activation loop phosphorylation at Thr-308 and also within the C terminus at Ser-473 (16Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3711) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of both residues is critical to generate a high level of Akt activity. We found that increasing the concentration of PYK2 resulted in an increasing amount of pAkt (S473) (Fig.2A). Furthermore the addition of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 blocked the appearance of pAkt (S473) indicating the Akt activation by PYK2 required PI3K activity. To investigate whether Akt and PI3K participate in PYK2-induced NF-κB activation we expressed a kinase-defective Akt (Akt KD) or treated the transfected HeLa cells with LY294002 and measured induction of the NF-κB reporter gene. Both Akt KD and the PI3K inhibitor blocked PYK2-induced NF-κB-dependent reporter gene activity indicating that PYK2 activated NF-κB through a PI3K- and Akt-dependent pathway (Fig. 2 B). Next we examined whether in HeLa cells PYK2 participated in the induction of the NF-κB reporter by GTPase-deficient Gqα or G13α. We transfected HeLa cells with the expression vectors for either GqαQL or G13αQL along with the NF-κB-dependent reporter gene in the presence or absence of the construct that expresses a kinase-defective form of PYK2 (PYK2 KD). We found that the expression of PYK2 KD significantly inhibited the activation of the reporter by either GqαQL (Fig. 3A) or G13αQL (Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, consistent with previous results both LY294002 and Akt KD blocked the ability of the GTPase-deficient Gα subunits from stimulating the reporter gene. These results indicate that receptors, which couple to Gqα and G13α, can use a pathway that involves PYK2, PI3K, and Akt to induce NF-κB-dependent transcription. However, the inhibition of G13αQL-induced NF-κB activation by the co-expression of Akt KD or by treatment with LY294002 was less complete than what we observed following GqαQL stimulation suggesting that G13αQL stimulated another pathway that led to NF-κB activation. A likely possibility is G13α signaling to RhoA exchange factors and subsequent RhoA activation, which can lead to the stimulation of NF-κB (17Perona R. Montaner S. Saniger L. Sanchez-Perez I. Bravo R. Lacal J.C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). We tested the ability of RhoA to activate NF-κB in HeLa cells by expressing a constitutively active form of RhoA and measuring NF-κB-dependent reporter gene activity. We found that RhoAQL potently induced the reporter gene and that concomitant expression of the kinase-dead form of Akt or treatment with LY294002 only modestly inhibited the induction. Implicating RhoA activation in the induction of the NF-κB reporter gene by G13α signaling a dominant negative form of RhoA significantly inhibited the induction of the reporter gene by G13αQL but not by GqαQL (Fig. 4). These results suggest that G13α-mediated RhoA activation contributes to its ability to stimulate NF-κB-dependent transcription whereas RhoA activation is not involved in the ability of Gqα to stimulate NF-κB. We used a similar approach to ascertain that a well studied GPCR such as the muscarinic type 1 receptor (M1R) used a similar pathway to activate an NF-κB-dependent reporter gene. We transfected HeLa cells with a construct that expresses the M1R along with the NF-κB-dependent reporter gene in the presence or absence of PYK2 KD or Akt KD. Treatment of the M1 receptor-transfected cells with carbachol dramatically enhanced the activity of the reporter gene. However, the addition of either a construct that expresses PYK2 KD or Akt KD potently inhibited the response (Fig.5A). As expected the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 also blocked the induction. Finally, we examined whether signals generated by the stimulation of the M1R or via the expression of GTPase-deficient G-proteins, which leads to Akt activation, utilized PYK2. To assess Akt activation we again used the pAkt (S473)-specific antibody. The expression of PYK2 KD efficiently blocked Akt activation induced by M1R signaling or by the expression of the GTPase-deficient Gα subunits (Fig. 5 B). This result further underscores the importance of PYK2 for Akt activation by the M1R receptor, Gqα or G13α. GPCR signaling can induce PYK2 activation, and GPCR signaling can trigger NF-κB activation. This study provided evidence that links these two sets of observations. First, PYK2 expression in HeLa cells caused NF-κB-dependent transcription. In addition, concomitant expression of PYK2 along with a GTPase-deficient form of Gqα or more dramatically of G13α further enhanced the transcription of an NF-κB-dependent reporter. Both GTPase-deficient Gα subunits augment PYK2 kinase activity. Second, a kinase inactive version of PYK2 inhibited NF-κB activation by either the GTPase-deficient Gα subunits or by signaling through a GPCR, the M1R. Third, PYK2 used a known signaling pathway to activate NF-κB. Several studies demonstrate PI3K and Akt involvement in TNF-α, platelet-derived growth factor, and bradykinin-induced NF-κB activation (6Xie P. Browning D.D. Hay N. Mackman N. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24907-24914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 8Shapiro P. V.S. Stokoe D. Weiss A. Curr.

Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar). Bradykinin via its cognate receptor stimulates Akt activity, and LY294002 blocks it (6Xie P. Browning D.D. Hay N. Mackman N. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24907-24914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In this study, PYK2 expression activated Akt, and the same PI3K inhibitor blocked it. Furthermore, both a kinase inactive form of Akt and a PI3K inhibitor blocked PYK2-induced NF-κB activation. Finally, a kinase inactive version of PYK2 significantly reduced G-protein- and GPCR-mediated Akt activation. The only partial inhibition of G13αQL induced NF-κB activation by the PI3K inhibitor suggested that an additional pathway led from G13α to NF-κB activation. Consistent with that possibility we found that co-expression of a dominant negative form of RhoA inhibited G13αQL-induced but not GqαQL-induced NF-κB reporter gene activity. Therefore, G13α may use a PYK2/Akt/PI3K or a RhoA-dependent pathway to stimulate NF-κB-dependent transcription. However, cross-talk between these two pathways likely occurs because G13α-induced PYK2 activation may assist in RhoA activation. Supporting that possibility, over-expression of PYK2 in HeLa cells increased the amount of RhoA that is GTP-bound and associated with the cell membrane (15Shi C.S. Sinnarajah S. Cho H. Kozasa T. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24470-24476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although the pathway by which RhoA activation stimulates NF-κB remains incompletely understood, a major involvement of Akt and PI3K in HeLa cells seems unlikely. Also, because RhoAQL does not efficiently activate PYK2 (15Shi C.S. Sinnarajah S. Cho H. Kozasa T. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24470-24476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and because kinase-dead PYK2 does not block RhoAQL-induced NF-κB activation 2C.-S. Shi, unpublished observation. it is unlikely that PYK2 acts downstream in RhoA-mediated NF-κB activation. M1R signaling, GqαQL, G13αQL, and PYK2 all activated Akt apparently through a PI3K-dependent pathway. Several mechanisms exist by which GPCR signaling can lead to PI3K activation (18Walker E.H.

However, this is unlikely to account for PYK2- or GTPase-deficient Gα subunit-mediated PI3K activation. More likely, activated Ras, a consequence of GPCR and PYK2 signaling, directly stimulated the p110 subunit of class IA PI3K. The catalytic activity of PYK2 could also either directly or indirectly modify p85 and p110 subunit interactions, thereby modifying PI3K activity. Several recent studies demonstrate PYK2 and PI3K activation following GPCR signaling and show an association between PYK2 and PI3K (20Murasawa S. Mori Y. Nozawa Y. Masaki H. Maruyama K. Tsutsumi Y. Moriguchi Y. Shibasaki Y. Tanaka Y. Iwasaka T. Inada M. Matsubara H. Hypertension. 1998; 32: 667-668Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 21Sayed M.R. Sheid M.P. Stevens C.M. Duronio V. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 314-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In platelets PYK2 constitutively associates with PI3K, and platelet activation with thrombin induces PYK2 tyrosine phosphorylation, enhances PYK2 catalytic activity, increases the PYK2/PI3K interaction, and augments PI3K activity (21Sayed M.R. Sheid M.P. Stevens C.M. Duronio V. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 314-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These results along with those observed here argue that GPCR-mediated PYK2 activation can increase PI3K activity, thereby activating Akt. However, other signaling pathways enhance PI3K activity independently of PYK2. For example, Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) by its phosphorylation of an adaptor protein termed BCAP results in PI3K activation (22Okada T. Maeda A. Iwamatsu A. Gotoh K. Kurosaki T. Immunity. 2000; 13: 813-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (227) Google Scholar). BTK-deficient mice and mice from RAG2-deficient blastocysts complemented with p85 PI3K-deficient embryonic stem cells have a similar B cell phenotype (23Fruman D.A. Snapper S.B. Yballe C.M. Davidson L., Yu, J.Y. Alt F.W. Cantley L.C. Science. 1999; 283: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). One much more severe result that was observed in PYK2-deficient mice, however, was that the Btk-deficient mice have marginal zone B cells, whereas the PYK2-deficient mice do not. Bone marrow reconstitution studies into Rag-deficient mice showed that the lack of marginal zone B cells in either the PYK2- or NF-κB-deficient mice results from an intrinsic B cell defect rather than a microenvironmental problem (11Cariappa A. Liou H.C. Horwitz B.H. Pillai S. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1175-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 12Guinamard R. Okigaki M. Schlessinger J. Ravetch J.V. Nat. Immun. 2000; 1: 31-36Crossref Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Analysis of PYK2 levels in highly purified follicular and marginal zone B cells revealed that the follicular B cells express as much if not more PYK2 than do marginal zone B cells. Thus, the simple explanation of a quantitative difference in expression cannot explain the marginal zone B cell loss in PYK2-deficient mice. 3C. Moratz and C.-S. Shi, unpublished observation. The results reported here connecting PYK2 signaling to NF-κB activation argues that the absence of marginal zone B cells in these gene-targeted mice arises from a common signaling defect. That marginal zone B cells use unique signaling pathways can be inferred from their precise tissue topography, distinctive cell surface phenotype, and altered physiologic responses (24Martin F. Kearney J.F. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 175: 70-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although signals generated through chemokine receptors, antigen receptors, and/or various tumor necrosis factor family member receptors have been suggested as important for the development, recruitment, and/or retention of marginal zone B cells, the precise signaling pathways preferentially or uniquely used by these cells are unknown. A careful analysis of PYK2 and NF-κB activation following the stimulation of marginal and follicular B cells with different chemokines, tumor necrosis factor family members, lipopolysaccharide, and antigen may help delineate some of the differences between these two B cell subsets. In conclusion this study links PYK2 to NF-κB activation through a signaling pathway that depends upon PI3K and Akt. PYK2 provides a mechanistic link between GPCR signaling and NF-κB activation. This study focused on GPCR and G-protein signaling to NF-κB in HeLa cells, a cell type that expresses PYK2; other cell types which lack PYK2 likely employ other mechanisms to link G-protein activation to NF-κB activation. The absence of marginal zone B cells in PYK2- and p50 NF-κB-deficient mice argues for a causal relationship, which this study supports.

This implies that, if the NR photocycle is associated with proton transport, it has a low efficiency, similar to that of haloarchaeal sensory rhodopsin II.

Yang C. Jung K. Spudich E.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 365-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). In these proteins, thermal relaxation of the photoinduced changes drives the “photocycle,” and the stored energy of a photon is utilized to perform ion transport (protons for BR, chloride for HR) or signaling for phototaxis (positive or negative, depending on light stimulus color for SRI, negative for SRII). Until very recently, these archaeal rhodopsins were thought to constitute an isolated family. In 1999, a protein with high homology to BR was revealed by partial sequencing of the Neurospora crassa genome (2Bieszke J.A. Braun E.L. Bean L.E. Kang S. Natvig D.O. Borkovich K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8034-8039Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This protein, named NOP-1, was heterologously expressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris, and, upon binding of retinal, formed a pigment (NR) with photochemical properties similar to those of SRII (3Bieszke J.A. Spudich E.N. Scott K.L. Borkovich K.A. Spudich J.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14138-14145Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). At least two distinct intermediates, similar to the M and O states of BR, were described for the NR photocycle (3Bieszke J.A. Spudich E.N. Scott K.L. Borkovich K.A. Spudich J.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14138-14145Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Since then, several similar opsins have been found in other fungi (reviewed in Ref. 1Spudich J.L. Yang C. Jung K. Spudich E.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 365-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) as well as in eubacteria (4Beja O. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Suzuki M.T. Hadd A. Nguyen L.P. Jovanovich S.B. Gates C.M. Feldman R.A. Spudich J.L. Spudich E.N. DeLong E.F. Science. 2000; 289: 1902-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). These findings extended the family of archaeal opsins to two more superkingdoms, Bacteria and Eucarya, suggesting that BR-like pigments could serve as energy sources or photoreceptors of ancient origin among species of various taxa. The physiological role of the fungal opsins is not yet known. They are more likely to be involved in photosensory signaling by light-modulated interaction with signal-transducing proteins, as SRI and SRII (1Spudich J.L. Yang C. Jung K. Spudich E.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 365-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), than proton pumping as the homologous archaeal (BR) and eubacterial (proteorhodopsin) pigments (5Oesterhelt D. Stoeckenius W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 2853-2857Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar, 4Beja O. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Suzuki M.T. Hadd A. Nguyen L.P. Jovanovich S.B.

The photocycle turnover of the transport rhodopsins is typically fast (<50 ms), whereas sensory rhodopsins generate long-living intermediates that serve as signaling states and persist for hundreds of milliseconds. Because Pichia-expressed NR exhibits a slow photocycle similar to sensory rhodopsins, in particular to that of SRII, it was argued (3Bieszke J.A. Spudich E.N. Scott K.L. Borkovich K.A. Spudich J.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14138-14145Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) that NR would be a very ineffective proton pump. On the other hand, if NR had a photosensory function, a slow photocycle would be beneficial, because the long-lived intermediates are the signaling states in SR proteins (6Spudich J.L. Lanyi J.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 452-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, the properties of the NR photocycle in its natural host are not known. The location of NR inNeurospora and its putative transducer and signaling cascade are likewise not known. Deletion of the nop-1 gene does not lead to any significant abnormalities in the Neurospora life cycle (2Bieszke J.A. Braun E.L. Bean L.E. Kang S. Natvig D.O. Borkovich K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8034-8039Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), making the role of NR even more enigmatic. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of NOP-1 (2Bieszke J.A. Braun E.L. Bean L.E. Kang S. Natvig D.O. Borkovich K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8034-8039Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and bacterio-opsin (7Dunn R. McCoy J. Simsek M. Majumdar A.

A. 1981; 78: 6744-6748Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) indicates that many residues important for proton transport are preserved in the fungal protein, and from this one would expect at least some proton pumping activity. The conserved residues include the complex counter-ion to the retinal Schiff base (i.e. Asp-85, Asp-212, Tyr-57, Tyr-185, and Arg-82, numbering for BR), and the important components of the retinal-binding pocket such as Trp-182, Trp-86, Tyr-83, and Thr-89 (see Ref. 8Luecke H. Schobert B. Cartailler J.-P. Richter H.-T. Rosengarth A. Needleman R. Lanyi J.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1237-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar for the structural details of BR). The primary proton donor Asp-96 (9Otto H. Marti T. Holz M. Mogi T. Lindau M. Khorana H.G. Heyn M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9228-9232Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 10Butt H.J. Fendler K. Bamberg E. Tittor J. Oesterhelt D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1657-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) is preserved as Glu, as are its hydrophobic environment and hydrogen-bonding partner, Thr-46 (11Luecke H. Richter H.-T. Lanyi J.K. Science. 1998; 280: 1934-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Some of the residues in contact with the retinal (e.g.Ser-141 on helix E) are changed, which may partially account for the large blue shift of the absorption maximum of NR relative to BR (534versus 568 nm), similar to the shift observed for SRII (12Shimono K. Iwamoto M. Sumi M. Kamo N. Photochem. Photobiol. 2000; 72: 141-145PubMed Google Scholar). The most striking differences in the two structures are in the extracellular region. The F-G interhelical loop is quite different from that of BR, and Glu-194, although not Glu-204, is absent. Indeed, the photocycle of NR is reminiscent of the E194Q mutant of BR (13Dioumaev A.K. Richter H.-T. Brown L.S. Tanio M. Tuzi S. Saito H. Kimura Y. Needleman R. Lanyi J.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2496-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), where a substantial amount of slowly decaying O intermediate accumulates. An interesting question raised by the overall similarity of the NR photocycle (3Bieszke J.A. Spudich E.N. Scott K.L. Borkovich K.A. Spudich J.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14138-14145Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) to both SRII and E194Q BR is whether the NR photocycle transports protons. The archaeal sensory rhodopsins do not pump ions when in a tight molecular complex with their cognate transducers, but in some cases light-driven vectorial transport of protons does occur in the absence of transducer. HtrI-free SRI was shown to exhibit single-photon-induced proton pumping out of Halobacterium salinarum cell envelope vesicles at pH ≥ 7 (14Bogomolni R.A. Stoeckenius W. Szundi I. Perozo E. Olson K.D. Spudich J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10188-10192Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Although in cell envelope vesicles H. salinarum SRII exhibits only electroneutral light-induced circulation of protons to and from the extracellular medium (15Sasaki J. Spudich J.L. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2145-2152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the related pigment fromNatronobacterium pharaonis was found to have some proton transport activity in such vesicles (16Sudo Y. Iwamoto M. Shimono K. Sumi M. Kamo N. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 916-922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) as well as in black lipid films (17Schmies G. Luttenberg B. Chizhov I. Engelhard M. Becker A. Bamberg E. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 959-966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The proton transport by N. pharaonis SRII was enhanced by factors that favor secondary photoreactions of late photocycle intermediates (presence of sodium azide, low pH, and the F86D mutation) (17Schmies G. Luttenberg B. Chizhov I. Engelhard M. Becker A. Bamberg E. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 959-966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This leaves open a possibility that SRII can transport only by a double-photon mechanism (16Sudo Y. Iwamoto M. Shimono K. Sumi M. Kamo N. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 916-922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 17Schmies G. Luttenberg B. Chizhov I. Engelhard M. Becker A. Bamberg E. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 959-966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the wild-type N. pharaonis SRII did not show any stationary photocurrent, whereas salinarum SRII exhibited weak, although significant, vectorial proton transport (18Schmies G. Engelhard M. Wood P.G. Nagel G. Bamberg E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1555-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A suggested explanation for pumping by archaeal sensory rhodopsins and the effects of mutations on SR signaling is that the same conformational changes in BR that contribute to the reprotonation switch in proton transport are responsible for communication of the photoactivation signal to the transducer in the signaling states of SR receptors (6Spudich J.L. Lanyi J.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 452-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 19Spudich J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 1051-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This unified model is supported by the observation that the opening of the cytoplasmic channel in SRI is blocked by interaction with its transducer HtrI (20Spudich J.L. Cell. 1994; 79: 747-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and the weaker proton pumping by SRII is also blocked by interaction with its transducer HtrII (16Sudo Y. Iwamoto M. Shimono K. Sumi M. Kamo N. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 916-922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 18Schmies G. Engelhard M. Wood P.G. Nagel G. Bamberg E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1555-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), very possibly by the same mechanism. A consequence of this view is that under some conditions reprotonation of the Schiff base in the photocycles of sensory rhodopsins may be more rapid from the cytoplasmic side than from the extracellular side, and protons are transported as in BR (21Brown L.S. Dioumaev A.K. Needleman R. Lanyi J.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3982-3993Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), although with lower efficiency. Thus, to understand the various physiological and non-physiological transport modes, the description of proton acceptors and donors in these photocycles is necessary. One significant difference between SRII and BR is that SRII lacks the proton donor, Asp-96, on the cytoplasmic side (22Zhang W. Brooun A. Mueller M.M. Alam M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8230-8235Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For this reason, the retinal Schiff base of SRII is not reprotonated rapidly from the cytoplasmic direction as in BR but obtains a proton mostly from the extracellular side, in a pH-dependent manner (15Sasaki J. Spudich J.L. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2145-2152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). On the other hand, introduction of an aspartic acid, at the position appropriate for a proton donor, into N. pharaonis SRII did not significantly alter the photocycle kinetics (17Schmies G. Luttenberg B. Chizhov I. Engelhard M. Becker A. Bamberg E. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 959-966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and the D96N and D96A mutants of BR lack a donor and have changed kinetics but transport protons (9Otto H. Marti T. Holz M. Mogi T. Lindau M. Khorana H.G. Heyn M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9228-9232Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). It appears that the directionality of Schiff base reprotonation is decided by factors additional to the presence or absence of a cytoplasmic proton donor. Unlike the other sensory rhodopsins, NR does have a cytoplasmic proton donor, Glu-142. Is the reprotonation of its Schiff base similar to the wild-type BR (9Otto H. Marti T. Holz M. Mogi T. Lindau M. Khorana H.G. Heyn M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9228-9232Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) and its D96E mutant (23Marinetti T. Subramaniam S. Mogi T. Marti T. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), or to SRII? In this paper we report a study of the photocycle of NR by means of visible and infrared spectroscopy, aimed at gaining information about proton transfers in the protein. The measurements were at different pH values, to evaluate if there are any pH-dependent steps associated with proton transfers. Proton release and uptake were followed with a pH-sensitive dye. Results with the E142Q mutant of NR demonstrated that, unlike in BR, the homologue of Asp-96 (Glu-142) does not serve as a proton donor for the retinal Schiff base, and its replacement does not alter the photocycle. It is possible therefore that the reprotonation of the Schiff base is mostly from the extracellular side, decreasing the efficiency of any proton transport, as found for SRII (15Sasaki J. Spudich J.L. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2145-2152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 18Schmies G. Engelhard M. Wood P.G. Nagel G. Bamberg E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1555-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Wild-type His-tagged NOP-1 with a truncated N terminus was expressed in P. pastoris as described before (3Bieszke J.A. Spudich E.N. Scott K.L. Borkovich K.A. Spudich J.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14138-14145Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding the E142Q and D131E mutants of NR were constructed by a two-step polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis by a modification of the megaprimer method (24Chen B. Przybyla A.E. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 657-659PubMed Google Scholar) using as template the NoppHIL-S1 plasmid described previously (3Bieszke J.A. Spudich E.N. Scott K.L. Borkovich K.A. Spudich J.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14138-14145Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In the first step the following mutagenic primers were used: 5′-CAAGGCCCACTCGACGTAGC-3′ for the D131E mutation and 5′-AGGCACAGCTGCAGCAGC-3′ for the E142Q mutation, in combination with the forward primer 5′-TTCGCTCGAGAATTCGAAACA-3′ constructed to the beginning of the gene and including anXhoI site immediately upstream of the nop-1gene. The product of this first reaction was then extended in a second polymerase chain reaction amplification using the reverse primer 5′-ATAGCCTCGAGACACCACG-3′ that includes the XhoI site present within the gene. The final 530-base pair product was digested with XhoI and replaced in the NoppHIL-S1 plasmid. The orientation of the replaced fragment and presence of the mutation were confirmed by sequencing. Mutants of NR were expressed analogously to the wild-type. Membranes containing wild-type or mutant NOP-1 were isolated as described elsewhere (3Bieszke J.A. Spudich E.N. Scott K.L. Borkovich K.A. Spudich J.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14138-14145Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. WashedPichia cells were resuspended in about 100 ml of 1m sorbitol, 0.5 mm PMSF. Retinal (3 mm stock in ethanol) was added to a final concentration of about 50 µm, and the initially near-white cells were left at room temperature for 1–2 h until the full development of a dark orange color. About 50 mg of lyticase (crude, from Arthrobacter luteus, Sigma Chemical Co.) was added, and the cells were slowly shaken at 30 °C for 3–4 h to digest cell walls. After that, the cells were vortexed several times with 25–30% volume of glass beads (420–600 µm, acid-washed) and centrifuged at low speed (300 ×g). The colored supernatant was withdrawn and stored, while the remaining cells and debris were resuspended in a few milliliters of buffer A (7 mm NaH2PO4, pH 6.5, 7 mm EDTA, 7 mm DTT, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and vortexing followed by centrifugation was repeated several times until the breakage of the cells was complete. The supernatants were combined and put into several centrifuge tubes on top of 25 ml of 60% sucrose and centrifuged for 90 min at 105,000 × g in a fixed-angle rotor. The colored material on top of the sucrose cushion was collected and washed by centrifugation in buffer A (15 min, 23,000 × g). When further purification was needed, the membranes were treated with 10% DM in buffer A for 30 min and washed several times by centrifugation (15 min, 23,000 × g). The purple membrane of H. salinarum containing BR was isolated according to the standard procedure (25Oesterhelt D. Stoeckenius W. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar). Samples for the FTIR measurements were prepared by drying the protein in 1 mm BTP, pH 7.0, on a CaF2 window under mild vacuum. After drying, the films were soaked for 60–120 min in 20 mm BTP and succinate buffers, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT at the specified pH. A 6-µm Teflon spacer (Spectra-Tech Inc., Shelton, CT) was used to fix the sample thickness. This procedure for preparing wet (50–70% water, w/w) films with defined pH was described previously (26Dioumaev A.K. Brown L.S. Needleman R. Lanyi J.K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10070-10078Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). All measurements were done at 25 °C, using a temperature-controlled sample holder (Harrick, Ossining, NY) connected to a water bath (RTE-111, Neslab, Portsmouth, NH). The FTIR time-resolved measurements were performed on an IFS-66s instrument (Bruker, Germany), at 2-cm−1 resolution. Interferograms were collected in the rapid-scan mode with 85-ms time resolution. The IR detector was equipped with a 2000 cm−1cut-off filter (Optical Coating Laboratory, Inc., Santa Rosa, CA). Excitation was provided by the second harmonics of the Nd:YAG laser (Minilite II, Continuum, Santa Clara, CA) at 532 nm, with ∼7-ns pulse width, and ∼2-mJ/cm2 pulse energy. The laser pulses were spaced at times greater than 5× the slowest decay time constant. A custom built program provided the triggering of the spectrometer, allowing one full scan before the arrival of the excitation flash from which the baseline was calculated. Kinetic analysis of data was done as described before (13Dioumaev A.K. Richter H.-T. Brown L.S. Tanio M. Tuzi S. Saito H. Kimura Y. Needleman R. Lanyi J.K.

The data were globally fitted by exponentials using the program FITEXP, and the number of statistically valid transient states was determined by F-test (for details see Ref.27Dioumaev A.K. Biophys. Chem. 1997; 67: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar and references therein). FT-Raman measurements were performed as before (28Brown L.S. Kamikubo H. Zimanyi L. Kataoka M. Tokunaga F. Verdegem P. Lugtenburg J. Lanyi J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5040-5044Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), with a spectral resolution of 2 cm−1. We used a concentrated suspension ofPichia membranes (OD > 10) in the same buffer as for the FTIR measurements. The Raman spectrum of the buffer was subtracted. Low temperature spectroscopy was performed using a Shimadzu UV-1601 spectrophotometer equipped with an Oxford cryostat with ITC-4 temperature controller (29Zimanyi L. Ormos P. Lanyi J.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1656-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Illumination was provided by a 175-watt Cermax xenon lamp (ILC Technology, Sunnyvale, CA) through a 5-mm diameter, 6-ft liquid light guide. Kinetic measurements in the visible range were done as described earlier (30Brown L.S. Dioumaev A.K. Needleman R. Lanyi J.K. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1455-1465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), using membranes encased in polyacrylamide gels equilibrated with the same buffer as for the infrared measurements. Amplitudes of kinetic traces taken at different wavelength were corrected for progressive photobleaching (less than 20%). Measurements of proton kinetics with pyranine (31Grzesiek S. Dencher N.A. FEBS Lett. 1986; 208: 337-342Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar) were performed in unbuffered membrane suspensions as before (32Brown L.S. Sasaki J. Kandori H. Maeda A. Needleman R. Lanyi J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27122-27126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) but at low ionic strength (few millimolar of NaCl) to avoid membrane aggregation. The kinetic analyses were performed as for the FTIR data. Fig. 1shows time courses of light-induced absorption changes in polyacrylamide gels loaded with membranes of P. pastoris containing NR. These measurements were at four pH values between 5 and 8, to reveal any pH-dependent photocycle steps. Absorption change was followed at 420 nm to monitor the deprotonated retinal Schiff base (the M intermediate), at 500 nm to monitor the depletion of the initial state, and at 600 nm to monitor the appearance of red-shifted states (e.g. the O intermediate). Fig. 1 shows that the photocycle turnover is slow (a few seconds, TableI). In general, it is characterized by intermediates similar to the M and O states of BR and SRII, as noted before at pH 6.5 (3Bieszke J.A. Spudich E.N. Scott K.L. Borkovich K.A. Spudich J.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14138-14145Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The improved time resolution allowed us to observe the deprotonation of the Schiff base (rise of the M state), which is somewhat slower (Table I) than the analogous process in BR. A comparison of kinetic traces at different pH values (Fig.1 A–D, Table I) shows that the proton concentration does not greatly affect the Schiff base deprotonation, which is to be expected if this process is an internal proton transfer to a homologue of Asp-85 (Asp-131 for NR) (33Bergo V. Scott K. Spudich E. Spudich J.L. Rothschild K.J. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 477AGoogle Scholar), the same way as in BR (34Braiman M.S. Mogi T. Marti T. Stern L.J. Khorana H.G. Rothschild K.J.

Open table in a new tab Unlike its deprotonation, the reprotonation of the retinal Schiff base shows marked pH dependence in the pH range between 5 and 8 (Fig.1 A–D). At pH below 5 the protein was unstable. At higher pH, the slow components of the M decay are larger in amplitude and their time constants are somewhat longer (Table I). The increases in the amplitudes are largely responsible for the drastic lengthening of the lifetime of the M state that is evident in Fig. 1. Effectively, the overall decay of M (as determined by a single exponential approximation) is thereby slowed by approximately 300-fold as the pH is increased from 5 to 8. This is accompanied by a dramatic decrease in the amplitude of the red-shifted O-like intermediate(s). Such pH-dependent behavior can be explained as a shift in the equilibrium between the M and N/O intermediates, which should be pH-dependent, because it involves a proton uptake step (see below). pH independence of the M decay is regarded as evidence for an internal proton donor (i.e. Asp-96 in BR) to the Schiff base (9Otto H. Marti T. Holz M. Mogi T. Lindau M. Khorana H.G. Heyn M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9228-9232Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Strong pH dependence of the M decay in the pH range between 5 and 8 (in Fig. 1 A–D) is not a property of the wild-type BR, but it is similar to what was reported for the D96N mutant of BR (35Holz M.

To investigate the means by which suppression of the amber codon within these genes occurs, MtmB, a methyltransferase initiating metabolism of monomethylamine, was examined. The C-terminal sequence of MtmB indicated that synthesis of this mtmB1 gene product did not cease at the internal amber codon, but at the following ochre codon.

Sequencing of peptide fragments from MtmB by Edman degradation and mass spectrometry revealed no change in the reading frame during mtmB1 expression.

Kandler O. Wheelis M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4576-4579Crossref PubMed Scopus (4459) Google Scholar). Three branches of methanogens make methane primarily from carbon dioxide, but the fourth branch of methanogens contains species such as Methanosarcina barkerithat are also capable of methanogenesis from substrates such as trimethylamine (TMA),1dimethylamine (DMA), and monomethylamine (MMA) as well as acetate and methanol (2Boone D.R.

The methylamines are significant precursors for methane formation in marine and brackish environments (5King G.M. Geomicrobiol. J. 1984; 3: 276-301Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that a considerable number of proteins and genes inMethanosarcina species are dedicated to the utilization of methylamines. Methanogenesis from methylamines requires methylation of coenzyme M (CoM) prior to reduction of the methyl group to methane.In vitro reconstitution with purified proteins has shown that CoM methylation is initiated with one of three different methylamine methyltransferases that methylate a cognate corrinoid protein (Fig. 1 A). The TMA methyltransferase (MttB) and cognate corrinoid protein (MttC) are specific for TMA (6Ferguson Jr., D.J. Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 846-852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); the DMA methyltransferase (MtbB) and cognate corrinoid protein (MtbC) are specific for DMA (7Ferguson Jr., D.J. Gorlatova N. Grahame D.A. Krzycki J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29053-29060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar); and the MMA methyltransferase (MtmB) and cognate corrinoid protein (MtmC) are specific for MMA (8Burke S.A. Krzycki J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16570-16577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Each of the methylated cognate corrinoid proteins can be demethylated by the methylamine-CoM methylase (MtbA), yielding methyl-CoM. The genes encoding TMA, DMA, and MMA methyltransferases were identified by the N-terminal sequences of the isolated methyltransferases (9Paul L. Ferguson D.J. Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2520-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 10Burke S.A. Lo S.L. Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3432-3440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). The gene sequences reveal that the TMA, DMA, and MMA methyltransferases are not homologous proteins. However, the genes encoding each of the methylamine methyltransferases share the common feature of a single internal amber codon. The amber codons, if read as stop codons, would result in truncated proteins of 23 kDa (MtmB), 38 kDa (MtbB), and 32 kDa (MttB). For each gene, a downstream ochre or opal stop codon follows the in-frame amber codon. If translation stopped at this second canonical stop codon, each gene would produce protein products of ∼50 kDa, the approximate molecular mass of the isolated and characterized TMA, DMA, or MMA methyltransferase polypeptide. These data indicate that the internal amber codons of the methylamine methyltransferase genes do not cease translation when the 50-kDa methyltransferases are produced. Isolation of the TMA, DMA, and MMA methyltransferases resulted in the purification of a single protein for each activity (6Ferguson Jr., D.J. Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 846-852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ferguson Jr., D.J. Gorlatova N. Grahame D.A. Krzycki J.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 16570-16577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, multiple and nearly identical copies of the genes encoding the DMA and MMA methyltransferases have been found in the genome of M. barkeri strain MS (Fig. 1 B). The three mtbBgenes are predicted to encode proteins with an average of 95% identity at the deduced amino acid level (9Paul L. Ferguson D.J. Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2520-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Two MMA methyltransferase gene copies are present in M. barkeri MS. These have been designated mtmB1 (formerly designated mtmB (10Burke S.A. Lo S.L. Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3432-3440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), GenBankTM/EBI accession number AF013713) andmtmB2 (GenBankTM/EBI accession numberAF230870) 2G. Srinivasan, L. Paul, S. A. Burke, and J. A. Krzycki, manuscript in preparation.2G. Srinivasan, L. Paul, S. A. Burke, and J. A. Krzycki, manuscript in preparation. and share 98% identity at the deduced amino acid level. Both genes have an in-frame amber codon at codon 202 and a downstream TAA stop codon at position 458. Termination at the second stop codon would result in a 50-kDa gene product, the mass of the isolated MMA methyltransferase (MtmB). The internal amber codons of these genes were first found by directed sequencing of the methylamine methyltransferase genes of M. barkeri strains MS and NIH and Methanosarcina thermophila (9Paul L. Ferguson D.J. Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2520-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 10Burke S.A. Lo S.L. Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3432-3440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, genomic sequencing ofMethanosarcina mazei at the Göttingen Genomic Institute 3T. Lienard and G. Gottschalk, personal communication.3T. Lienard and G. Gottschalk, personal communication. and M. barkeri Fusaro at the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute confirmed that all TMA, DMA, and MMA methyltransferase genes within these organisms also contain a single in-frame amber codon. Such genus-level re-coding events, in which the termination function of a naturally occurring canonical stop codon is suppressed, remain relatively rare, but have been now documented in a variety of different organisms (11Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 741-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In the most extreme examples, such asMycoplasma species, some protists, and mitochondria of many species, a canonical stop codon serves as a general sense codon (12Osawa S. Jukes T.H. Watanabe K. Muto A. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 229-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in the ∼200 sequenced genes of Methanosarcinaspecies in the GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank, no gene other than the methylamine methyltransferase genes has been observed to utilize internal amber codons as sense codons. The methylamine methyltransferase genes themselves possess only a single internal amber codon in each gene (Fig. 1 B). Several means by which a naturally occurring internal stop codon is suppressed have been identified. In some cases, the stop codon is avoided by frameshifting (13Alam S.L. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14177-14179Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 14Farabaugh P.J. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 103-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) such as observed for the retroviralgag-pol genes (15Jacks T. Madhani H.D. Masiarz F.R. Varmus H.E. Cell. 1988; 55: 447-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), the gene encodingEscherichia coli release factor II (16Craigen W.J. Caskey C.T. Nature. 1986; 322: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), and the genes encoding ornithine decarboxylase antienzymes in eucaryal species (17Ivanov I.P. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3185-3196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Frameshifts can also occur in which the sequence containing a stop codon is completely bypassed, effectively translating noncontiguous sequences, such as with T4 gene 60 (18Herr A.J. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 343-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Of course, a naturally occurring stop codon can also be suppressed with a tRNA whose anticodon can base pair with the stop codon. Some eucaryotic tRNA species that suppress naturally occurring stop codons also decode normal sense codons (19Geller A.I. Rich A. Nature. 1980; 283: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 20Feng Y.X. Copeland T.D. Oroszlan S. Rein A. Levin J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8860-8863Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In contrast, dedicated tRNA species are involved in decoding UGA as selenocysteine in all three domains (21Commans S. Bock A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 23: 335-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aside from the UGA encoding of selenocysteine (22Rother M. Wilting R. Commans S. Bock A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), the suppression of a naturally occurring in-frame canonical stop codon had not been previously observed in genes of any member of the methanogens or, indeed, any other Archaea. Thus, the manner in which the in-frame amber codons of the methylamine methyltransferase are suppressed has been unknown. The single in-frame amber codons of the methylamine methyltransferase genes are given added interest by occurring in non-homologous genes with analogous roles in initiating metabolism of a methylamine. The relative abundance of methanogen catabolic proteins such as the methyltransferases (6Ferguson Jr., D.J. Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 846-852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ferguson Jr., D.J. Gorlatova N. Grahame D.A. Krzycki J.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 16570-16577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) encoded by these genes suggests that an efficient amber codon readthrough mechanism would be needed to facilitate expression. To examine the extent and manner of readthrough of the internal amber codon of the methylamine methyltransferase genes, the mtmB1gene product (MtmB) was examined. The results indicate that the internal amber codon of the gene encoding this protein is not suppressed by frameshifting, but that the amber codon position in the gene corresponds to lysine in the protein product. M. barkeri MS cells were grown on 80 mm MMA or sodium acetate in a phosphate-buffered medium (23Krzycki J.A. Mortenson L.E. Prince R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7217-7221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and harvested 7 days after inoculation. Cell extracts were prepared by lysis with a French pressure cell as described previously and frozen at −70 °C prior to use (24Cao X. Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5439-5448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MtmB protein used throughout this study was purified as described by Burke and Krzycki (8Burke S.A. Krzycki J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16570-16577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) from cells grown on MMA. Protein was assayed using the bicinchoninic acid assay (25Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18501) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Protein purity was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) following the method of Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206597) Google Scholar), followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The protein was carboxymethylated after reduction of 86 μm MtmB with 14.2 mmdithiothreitol in 7.1 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0) for 20 min at 50 °C under N2. After cooling to room temperature, iodoacetate (53.8 mm) was added. If radiolabeled peptides were desired, [14C]iodoacetate (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Costa Mesa, CA) was used at a specific radioactivity of 13.4 mCi/mmol. After overnight incubation, the mixture was adjusted to a final concentration of 6.6 m urea, 0.33 m ammonium bicarbonate, and 17.6 mm dithiothreitol. The mixture was then incubated at 50 °C for 20 min prior to addition of 29 mm fresh iodoacetate. After a final 45-min incubation at 37 °C, the carboxymethylated protein was exchanged into 0.4m ammonium bicarbonate buffer containing 2 murea and digested with 33% (w/w) trypsin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 20 h at 37 °C. The digest was analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC analysis using a 25 × 0.46-cm C18column (Rainin Instrument Co. Inc., Woburn, MA). The column was eluted with a 52.5-ml gradient beginning with 0.06% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and 1.2% (v/v) acetonitrile and ending with 0.052% trifluoroacetic acid and 80% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and monitored at 210 nm. Radiolabeled fragments were identified using the on-line radioactivity detector described previously (24Cao X. Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5439-5448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The intact MtmB protein or HPLC-purified tryptic fragments of MtmB were sequenced by automated Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems Model 473A sequencer. For C-terminal sequencing, protein was loaded onto an Applied Biosystems ProSorb cartridge. The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane from the cartridge was then analyzed using an Applied Biosystems Model 494C sequencer. Purified MtmB was electrophoresed through an SDS-15% polyacrylamide gel, and the excised MtmB was used to raise rabbit antibodies by Harlan Bioproducts Inc. (Cincinnati, OH). The polyclonal antibodies were purified with an affinity column. Purified MtmB was bound to anN-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacturer's protocol. Immune antiserum was applied to the column, which was equilibrated with 75 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0), and the antibody was eluted with 100 mm glycine buffer (pH 3.0) and 500 mm NaCl and collected in 1-ml fractions neutralized with 0.4 ml of 1m Tris buffer (pH 8.0). Immunoblots of SDS-polyacrylamide gels were prepared as described previously (27Ferguson Jr., D.J. Krzycki J.A. Grahame D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5189-5194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) using 4-chloro-1-naphthol as substrate for the horseradish peroxidase-linked sheep anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Sigma). Oligonucleotide primers were designed that added NdeI and EcoRI restriction sites to the 5′- and 3′-coding sequences of mtmB1. These primers were used to amplify, from a subclone of λ-SAB (10Burke S.A. Lo S.L. Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3432-3440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a fragment comprising the entire coding region of mtmB1 extending from the ATG start codon through the internal amber codon to the following TAA codon (nucleotide +1377 relative to the starting nucleotide). The polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into pGEM-T (Promega, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer's protocol. The completemtmB1 gene was then excised with NdeI andEcoRI and ligated into similarly digested pET-17b (Novagen, Madison, WI) to create pCJ09. The DNA sequence of each mtmBclone was unchanged as confirmed using an ABI Prism Model 310 automated sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Expression of mtmB1 was induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside in E. coliBL21(DE3) pLysS transformed with pCJ09. The cells were lysed by sonication, solubilized with 1.2% SDS, and separated by SDS-PAGE on a 12.5% acrylamide gel prior to immunoblotting. A tryptic fragment of MtmB that spanned the domain encoded by the region of mtmB1 containing the UAG residue was further digested with endoproteinase Glu-C (28Taylor J.M. Mitchell W.M. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2188-2194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC, and the masses of individual peptides were determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry with a Perceptive Biosystems Voyager-DE STR instrument. Samples were applied to the target using 4-hydroxy-α-cinnamic acid as the matrix. The sequence of a peptide fragment from a trypsin/Glu-C digest of MtmB encoded by the region surrounding the internal amber codon ofmtmB1 was determined using electrospray ionization spectra taken with a Thermoquest LCQ Decca mass spectrometer. Cells of M. barkeri grown on MMA were harvested shortly after the onset of stationary phase, and the MMA methyltransferase (MtmB) was isolated according to an established protocol (8Burke S.A. Krzycki J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16570-16577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This yielded a homogeneous preparation of the 50-kDa enzyme (Fig. 2 A) as judged by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel. ThemtmB1 and mtmB2 gene products are predicted to have the N-terminal sequences MTFRKSF and MTFRKYF, respectively. The N terminus of purified MtmB was determined to be TFRKSF. The fifth cycle of the Edman degradation revealed no tyrosyl residue, and only a seryl residue was detected. The C terminus of MtmB was sequenced and found to be DLGLVF. This is the sequence predicted for both the mtmB1 andmtmB2 gene products if translation ends at the stop codon (TAA, codon 459) following the in-frame amber codon encountered at codon 202. Termination at the TAA codon during expression ofmtmB1 should produce a protein of 50 kDa. These results indicate that the isolated 50-kDa MtmB protein is produced frommtmB1 with the internal amber codon not serving as a translation stop and that, instead, translation termination occurs at the following TAA codon. The M. barkeri mtmB1 gene, including the internal amber codon and the following TAA stop codon, was cloned into an expression vector, yielding pCJ09. E. coli transformed with pCJ09 produced a 27-kDa polypeptide that increased upon isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction (Fig.2 A). This protein was not observed in the same host strain that had been transformed with pET-17b lacking the mtmB1insert. The predicted size of the amber codon termination product ofmtmB1 is 23 kDa. To confirm that the recombinant product was the mtmB1 amber termination product, cell extracts ofE. coli carrying pCJ09 were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with polyclonal antibody raised against the 50-kDa MtmB protein (Fig. 2 B). The inducible 27-kDa protein was readily detectable with anti-MtmB antibody. Following induction of mtmB1, the predominant 27-kDa polypeptide was excised from the gel following SDS-PAGE of theE. coli extract, and the C terminus was determined to be GV. This corresponds to the C-terminal sequence predicted for the amber codon termination product of mtmB1. The antibody raised against 50-kDa MtmB was used to examine cell extracts of M. barkeri following growth on either MMA or acetate to determine the relative abundance of the 50-kDa MtmB protein and any putative amber termination products produced from mtmB genes. By far the most intense band detectable on immunoblots of extracts of M. barkerigrown on either acetate or MMA was 50-kDa MtmB, as evidenced by comigration with the purified MtmB protein (Fig. 2 B). Minor bands corresponding to proteins smaller than 50 kDa were also detectable on immunoblots of extracts of M. barkeri grown on MMA, but not acetate. Some of these same bands were also visible on immunoblots with higher amounts of MtmB, although they were undetectable on Coomassie Blue-stained gels of MtmB (Fig.2 A), indicating that they were relatively minor proteins compared with the 50-kDa MtmB protein. A 42-kDa protein was detectable with anti-MtmB antibodies in purified MtmB preparations as well as in extracts of M. barkeri. The intensity of the 42-kDa protein band was noted to increased in extracts that were repeatedly frozen and thawed (data not shown). This behavior, along with the 42-kDa mass, indicated that this band is a degradation product of the 50-kDa MtmB protein, rather than the amber termination product of themtmB genes. Three minor bands of 26, 28, and 30 kDa were also detected in extracts of M. barkeri grown on MMA probed with anti-MtmB antibodies. Since these proteins migrated roughly the same distance as the E. coli mtmB1 amber termination product, they may represent amber termination products of the mtmB genes. Immunoblots of serial dilutions of the extract demonstrated that the intensity of the immunoblot signal corresponding to the 50-kDa MtmB protein began to saturate before the three putative mtmB amber termination products were even detectable (Fig. 2 C), making estimates of relative amounts difficult. With the lowest amount of cell extract in which the putative amber termination products were seen (20 μg of total protein), image analysis indicated that the total intensity of these three protein bands represented ∼3.5% of the total signal from 50-kDa MtmB. Although this overestimates the signal intensity of the putative amber termination products relative to the intensity of the 50-kDa MtmB signal, this result does indicate that relatively small amounts of any potential mtmB amber termination products were present in the M. barkeri cells. In the absence of any frameshift events, the tryptic fragment of MtmB corresponding to the region of mtmB1 surrounding the amber codon is predicted to possess three cysteine residues. To identify this peptide for sequencing by Edman degradation, MtmB was carboxymethylated with [14C]iodoacetate. The trypsin-digested14C-carboxymethylated protein was then separated by reverse-phase HPLC (Fig. 3). One of the major peaks of radioactivity, eluting at 66 minutes, contained a peptide with the N-terminal sequence NACAMAGRPGMGVKGPETSLSAQGN. This sequence is identical to that predicted for the tryptic fragment encoded by the region ofmtmB1 surrounding the internal amber codon. The boldface amino residue corresponds to the position of the amber codon; this residue eluted from the column of the amino acid sequencer with a retention time identical to that of the phenylthiohydantoin-derivative of lysine (Figs. 4 and 5).Figure 4Three cycles of Edman degradation of the peptide spanning the amber-encoded residue identified as described in the legend to Fig. 3.

These results confirmed that no frameshifting or translational bypassing event was required to express MtmB from mtmB1. Internal sequencing of the MtmB protein also provided further evidence that the isolated MtmB protein was produced from mtmB1 rather than mtmB2. Two internal peptides were identified (CTQDDWD and LVSL) whose sequences were identical to the N termini of predicted tryptic fragments of the mtmB1 gene product, whereas the boldface residues are replaced by Leu and Ala, respectively, in the predicted product of the mtmB2 gene. In addition, one tryptic fragment of MtmB had the N-terminal sequence GNSDI, which would be predicted to derive only from themtmB1 gene product since, immediately preceding this sequence, a Thr residue rather than Lys is predicted for themtmB2 gene product. The MtmB tryptic fragment identified above spanned the corresponding amber codon region of mtmB1, but was too large for sequence analysis by mass spectrometry and was also14C-labeled. To produce a smaller nonradioactive fragment, the tryptic digest was repeated with [12C]iodoacetate-treated protein and separated by HPLC. With this digest, the tryptic fragment beginning with NACAM could not be identified, but eluting at almost the same position from the reverse-phase column was a peptide generated by trypsin cleavage following Arg196, rather than Lys188, whose N terminus began with PGMGV (see Fig. 5). Edman degradation of this peptide confirmed the sequence predicted from mtmB1 before and after the amber-encoded residue at position 202 in MtmB, which again was identified as lysine. The HPLC fraction containing this peptide was then further digested with endoproteinase Glu-C, which cleaves following either Asp or Glu. The digest was further purified by reverse-phase HPLC. The masses of the eluting peptides were screened by MALDI-TOF, and a peptide with a mass/charge ratio of 2017.62 was detected (Fig.6 A). This mass matches that predicted for the peptide PGMGVKGPETSLSAQGNISAD. This sequence corresponds to a peptide fragment predicted by the mtmB1sequence if the reading frame surrounding the UAG codon is maintained and the amber codon itself encodes lysine. The peptide was further analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (Fig. 6 B). The sequence inferred from the peptide mass was confirmed by the masses determined for the individual residues. The residue corresponding to the position encoded by the UAG codon in the peptide had a mass of 128.1 Da. This corresponds to the mass expected if the amber codon of mtmB1 directs incorporation of lysine into MtmB. An internal amber codon had not been found to be a common feature of a class of genes from any archaeal species until the genes encoding the TMA, DMA, and MMA methyltransferases were described. Here, the purified MMA methyltransferase MtmB was examined as the product of a representative methylamine methyltransferase gene. The residues directly N- and C-terminal to the UAG-encoded position are those predicted by the reading frame of mtmB1. The amino acid residue found at the position corresponding to the UAG codon was identified as a lysyl residue by both Edman degradation and mass spectrometry. The correspondence of UAG to lysine in proteolytic fragments of the MMA methyltransferase is surprising given that otherwise normal use of AAA and AAG codons in almost equal proportion is observed in the genes fromMethanosarcina species deposited in the GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank. This assignment is also notable in that no peptides were identified from MtmB digests in which this lysine codon served as a trypsin cleavage site. However, digestion with trypsin did not proceed to completion in these digests, as evidenced by a sequenced peptide in which trypsin cleavage after an Arg residue did not occur. In addition, the Gly and Pro residues following the UAG-encoded lysine could negatively influence trypsin cleavage. The sequencing of isolated tryptic fragments also cannot exclude a labile modification of the amber-encoded lysine in the intact protein. In any case, these results indicate that, during translation ofmtmB1 resulting in synthesis of 50-kDa MtmB, the internal amber codon encodes an amino acid residue. This eliminates other potential mechanisms by which the amber codon might have been circumvented during expression of full-length MtmB, such as frameshifting with or without the translation of noncontiguous sequences. A potential complication in this analysis existed. Two nearly identical genes (mtmB1 and mtmB2) that could encode the characterized MtmB protein and that contain an internal amber codon at corresponding positions2 are found in the genome ofM. barkeri MS. However, sequencing of the isolated MtmB protein provided no indication of the presence of the mtmB2gene product and was entirely as predicted for the mtmB1gene product. This result was consistent with recent results from our laboratory indicating that the mtmB1 transcript is abundant relative to the mtmB2 transcript.2 However, even in the event that the isolated MtmB product was a mixture of both gene products, the conclusion that the amber codon corresponds with lysine in proteolytic fragments of the MMA methyltransferase would remain valid. The mtmB genes have identical sequence surrounding and including the in-frame amber codon, and the following ochre codon is also at the same position in both genes. An alternative explanation for the apparent readthrough of an amber codon during synthesis of MtmB is that a gene nearly identical tomtmB1 in the genome has a lysine codon replacing the internal amber codon, but otherwise exactly matches the sequenced portions of MtmB (Fig. 5). However, no evidence has been found for such a gene. Extensive probing of restricted genomic DNA has revealed only DNA fragments corresponding to mtmB1 and mtmB2 in the genome of M. barkeri MS.2 Genomic sequencing of M. mazei has revealed two copies ofmtmB genes.3 BLAST searches of the preliminary sequence data for the M. barkeri Fusaro genome on the server of the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (www.jgi.doe.gov/) revealed three mtmB1 homologs. AllmtmB homologs found in both genomes possess the in-frame amber codon at the position noted in M. barkeri MSmtmB1 and are predicted to encode 50-kDa MMA methyltransferases if their internal amber codons are translated. E. coli transformed with mtmB1 produced an inducible 27-kDa product with the C terminus predicted for themtmB1 amber termination product and that reacted with anti-MtmB antibody. This served as a control for detection of themtmB1 amber termination product within M. barkeri, but only trace amounts of M. barkeri proteins near the size of the mtmB1 amber termination product produced in E. coli were found. The identification of these products as actual mtmB amber termination products is by no means certain. However, their low relative abundance clearly indicates that relatively little of even potential amber termination products exist in the cell relative to the amber readthrough product. Again, the presence of the nearly identical mtmB1 andmtmB2 genes in the genome is a potentially complicating factor, but since the two gene products are 98% identical, the polyclonal antibody raised against MtmB should detect both full-length and amber termination products from either gene. These results are thus consistent with suppression of the amber codon within themtmB genes occurring at high efficiency in M. barkeri. It remains possible that high amounts of amber codon termination products of the mtmB genes are produced, but are degraded by the cell. However, high efficiency readthrough of the amber codon would be consistent with the abundance of MtmB, which is >2% of soluble protein in M. barkeri (8Burke S.A. Krzycki J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16570-16577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A markedly lower efficiency readthrough of the amber codon, such as the 5% readthrough of amber codons reported for the retroviral Gag-Pol protein (29Wills N.M. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6991-6995Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), would result in production of a large amount of cellular protein as the mtmB amber codon termination products. Thus far, internal amber codons have been found only in the genes encoding the TMA, DMA, and MMA methyltransferases in methanogenic Archaea. Twenty-one examples of these methylamine methyltransferase genes have now been sequenced, and all maintain the single in-frame amber codon. Assuming that the in-frame amber codon encodes lysine in these methyltransferases, this argues for a powerful selection against the simple point mutation required to convert the amber UAG codon to a lysine codon (AAG or AAA). What this selective pressure might be is as yet unknown, but it is reasonable to postulate a regulatory or catalytic function related to the common role of the encoded proteins in initiating the assimilation and catabolism of methylamines. Scenarios can be envisioned in which the amber codon is required for synthesis of catalytically active MtmB. For example, pausing at the amber codon during translation may allow proper folding of MtmB, or the amber codon could be involved in a modification of a residue needed for full catalytic activity. It must be stressed that the current results do not eliminate the possibility of a labile modification near or even on the amber-encoded lysine residue, which might be lost during the acidic conditions employed for purification of the peptides sequenced here. Alternatively, the in-frame amber codon of the methylamine genes may represent a regulatory device in which the encoding of the diamino acid lysine by an amber codon acts in an as yet unelucidated manner to control metabolism of methylamine substrates by controlling methylamine methyltransferase gene expression. Regulatory functions have been demonstrated for the in-frame stop codons in the genes encoding ornithine decarboxylase antienzymes (17Ivanov I.P. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F.

https://openalex.org/W1980746627,"Tax, the human T cell leukemia virus type I oncoprotein, plays a crucial role in viral transformation and the development of the virally associated disease adult T cell leukemia. Because oncogenesis involves alterations in cell growth, it is important to examine the effects of Tax on cell cycle progression. Using a synchronized cell system, we have found that Tax expression accelerates G<sub>1</sub> phase progression and S phase entry with concomitant DNA replication. This accelerated progression is accompanied by an earlier onset of cdk2 kinase activity. In contrast to the shortening of G<sub>1</sub> phase, the length of S phase is unaffected by Tax expression. As a result of a more rapid cell cycle progression, cells expressing Tax exhibit faster growth kinetics and display an altered cell cycle distribution. Additionally, the decreased time allowed for growth in the presence of Tax results in a decreased cell size. Tax-associated acceleration of cell cycle progression may play a role in the ability of this viral oncoprotein to mediate cellular transformation and promote the development of human T cell leukemia virus type I-associated diseases."

It is now well established that EBNA1 is poorly recognized by the CD8+ CTL-mediated surveillance that prevents the uncontrolled proliferation of EBV-infected B cellsin vivo (1Khanna R. Burrows S.R.

Furthermore, mammary carcinoma cells transfected with EBNA1 are poorly immunogenic in mice, whereas strong immunogenicity was induced by expression of other EBV proteins that are highly immunogenic in humans, suggesting that CTL evasion occurs across species (5Trivedi P. Masucci M.G. Winberg G. Klein G. Int. J. Cancer. 1991; 48: 794-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Studies by Levitskaya et al. (6Levitskaya J. Coram M. Levitsky V. Imreh S. Steigerwald Mullen P.M. Klein G. Kurilla M.G. Masucci M.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 685-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar) showed that an internal glycine-alanine repeat (GAr) domain of EBNA1 acts as a cis-inhibitor of MHC class I-restricted presentation. They proposed that the sequence within the EBNA1 GAr domain may influence the folding pattern of this antigen and affect its capacity to associate with various components of the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway, including ubiquitin conjugation enzymes and/or regulatory subunits of the proteasome. More recent studies by Sharipo et al. (7Sharipo A. Imreh M. Leonchiks A. Imreh S. Masucci M.G. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 939-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) have shown that although the GAr sequence allows ubiquitination when inserted into the IκB protein sequence, the polyubiquitinated protein is unable to form stable complexes with the proteasome. Based on these observations, it was argued that the GAr domain forms β-sheets that are resistant to unfolding and that block entry into the proteasomal complex. Prompted by these observations, we constructed a series of EBNA1 expression vectors to determine whether any strategies could be devised to override this GAr-mediated inhibition of MHC class I-restricted presentation of EBNA1. Based on our understanding of proteasomal targeting of cellular and viral proteins (8Rock K.L. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 739-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar, 9Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar), these expression vectors were specifically designed to target EBNA1 through the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway to enhance its intracellular degradation. Here, we report that covalent linking of EBNA1 with ubiquitin and targeting to the N-end rule pathway dramatically enhances its intracellular degradation and restores CD8+ T cell recognition. Full-length EBNA1 was cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) to generate EBNA1 (Fig. 1 A), which encodes nonubiquitinated EBNA1 protein. To generate noncleavable ubiquitin conjugates of EBNA1 in pcDNA3.1, a vector was constructed expressing the EBNA1 coding sequence, EBNA1, fused in-frame to the C terminus of the human ubiquitin-coding sequence. The C-terminal glycine residue (Gly76) of human ubiquitin was mutated to an alanine residue (Ala76), which diminishes cleavage of the fusion protein (8Rock K.L. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 739-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar), generating Ub-Ala/Met-EBNA1 (Fig. 1 B). In addition, we constructed an expression vector, Ub-Ala/Arg-EBNA1 (Fig. 1 C) in which the ubiquitin-Ala76 conjugate of EBNA1 was expressed in such a way that the N-terminal residue of EBNA1 was modified from Met1 to Arg1. The latter substitution applies the principles of N-end rule targeting and has been shown to decrease the in vivo half-life of a protein from greater than 10 h to 3 min (10Varshavsky A. Cell. 1992; 69: 725-735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). For comparison, Arg1-EBNA1 was also fused in-frame to the C terminus of unmodified ubiquitin-Gly76 to generate the expression vector Ub-Gly/Arg-EBNA1 (Fig. 1 D). Similarly, Met1-EBNA1 was also fused in-frame to the C terminus of unmodified ubiquitin-Gly76 to generate the expression vector Ub-Gly/Met-EBNA1 (Fig. 1 F). In addition, we constructed an EBNA1 construct in which the GAr domain was deleted, EBNA1-GAr-del (Fig. 1 J). The above constructs included insertion of a well defined HLA-B8-restricted, EBNA-3 CTL epitope, FLRGRAYGL (referred to as FLR) (21Burrows S.R. Rodda S.J. Suhrbier A. Geysen H.M. Moss D.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) into the SacII site at nucleotide position 1853 of EBNA1, to allow evaluation of endogenous processing of EBNA1 by using specific CTL clones. To assess expression of EBNA1, EBNA1-GAr-del, and Ub-EBNA1, each of the inserts from the above pcDNA3.1 constructs was subcloned in-frame with a sequence coding for green fluorescent protein (pEGFP-N1,CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA); EBNA1-GFP (Fig.1 E), Ub-Gly/Met-EBNA1-GFP (Fig. 1 F), Ub-Ala/Met-EBNA1-GFP (Fig. 1 G), Ub-Ala/Arg-EBNA1-GFP (Fig.1 H), Ub-Gly/Arg-EBNA1-GFP (Fig. 1 I), and EBNA1-GAr-del-GFP (Fig. 1 J). Recombinant EBNA1 and Ub-EBNA1 constructs were transiently transfected into either an EBV-negative Burkitt's lymphoma B-cell line (DG75), an EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL-KK/B95.8), or an EBV-negative keratinocyte cell line (SVMR6). Exponentially growing DG75 or KK/B95.8-LCL cells (5 × 106) were transfected in growth medium with 10 μg of DNA using the Bio-Rad Gene Pulser (960 μF, 250 V, 0.4 cm gap electrode, 300 μl assay volume; 25EC). SVMR6 keratinocytes were also transfected with the pcDNA3.1 expression constructs (Fig. 1, A–D) using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two proteasome inhibitors, Cbz-leu-leu-leucinal (Cbz-L3) andN-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal, were added to the cells at a final concentration of 10 and 2 μg/ml, respectively, 24 h after the commencement of transfection. The efficiency of transfection and the effect of proteasome inhibitors on the transfected cells were assessed by FACScan (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) set to measure GFP fluorescence and analyzed with the Cellquest software (Becton Dickinson). DG75 cells were transiently transfected with EBNA1-GFP, Ub-Gly/Met-EBNA1-GFP, Ub-Ala/Met-EBNA1-GFP, Ub-Ala/Arg-EBNA1-GFP, Ub-Gly/Arg-EBNA1-GFP, EBNA1-GFP-GAr-del, and pEGFP-N1 expression vectors as described above. At 30 h posttransfection, cycloheximide (25 μg/ml) was added to 8 × 106cells. Equal aliquots of cells were removed at time points 0 min, 30 min, 1 h, and 2 h; lysed in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample dye; and resolved under reducing conditions on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Cell lysates were prepared by homogenizing 1 × 107 cells suspended in 0.2 ml of 1% SDS/phosphate-buffered saline with a 27 gauge needle. The samples were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, (Hybond C, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and incubated with anti-GFP serum (1:2000) or anti-actin antibody (1:1000). DNA was purified using the Qiagen endotoxin-free maxi-prep kit. 6–8-week-old female BALB/c (H-2d) mice were immunized intramuscularly three times, at 14-day intervals, with 50 μg of plasmid DNA. This was dissolved in endotoxin free phosphate-buffered saline at a concentration of 1 μg/ml, and 50 μl was injected into the rear quadriceps muscle using a 28 gauge needle. For the constructs EBNA1, Ub-Ala/Met-EBNA1, and Ub-Ala/Arg-EBNA1, five mice were used in each treatment group. For the pcDNA3.1 vector control and Ub-Gly/Arg-EBNA1, three mice per group were used. Five weeks after the final DNA immunization, mice were killed by cervical dislocation, and spleens were removed for in vitrorestimulation of CTLs. Splenocytes (16 × 106) from each mouse were seeded into four wells of a 24-well plate and mixed with peptide-coated (10 μg/ml) -irradiated (2000 rads) LPS blasts (derived from naive Balb/c splenocytes) at a responder to stimulator ratio of 3:1. The H-2Kd-restricted, EBNA1 peptide epitope is VYGGSKTSL (12Mukherjee S. Trivedi P. Dorfman D.M. Klein G. Townsend A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). After 5 days, the responder cells were harvested, and viable cells were counted. 51Cr-labeled P815 target cells (a H-2d-positive mastocytoma cell line) were incubated in the presence or absence of the EBNA1 peptide epitope and used as targets in a standard cytotoxicity assay (11Khanna R. Burrows S.R. Thomson S.A. Moss D.J. Cresswell P. Poulsen P. Cooper L. J. Immunol. 1997; 157: 3619-3625Google Scholar). There is now convincing evidence that proteasomal degradation of intracellular proteins is critically dependent on the covalent linkage of ubiquitin via its C-terminal glycine residue (Gly76) to μ-amino groups on lysine residues on the protein substrate, followed by rapid polyubiquitination through the attachment of additional ubiquitin molecules (13Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. Nature. 1992; 357: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 14Hochstrasser M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar, 15Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). Because previous studies have suggested that inefficient targeting of EBNA1 through the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway may be responsible for poor endogenous processing, we reasoned that covalent linkage of EBNA1 to ubiquitin may allow efficient targeting of this protein to the proteasomal complex. To further enhance the proteasomal targeting of our ubiquitinated EBNA1 constructs, we have mutated the Gly76 residue of ubiquitin to Ala76, which is known to diminish the cleavage of the fusion protein by greater than 90% (16Ecker D.J. Stadel J.M. Butt T.R. Marsh J.A. Monia B.P. Powers D.A. Gorman J.A. Clark P.E. Warren F. Shatzman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7715-7719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) while still permitting the fused ubiquitin to act as a substrate for polyubiquitination. In addition to the above modification, we have constructed expression vectors in which ubiquitin conjugates of EBNA1 are expressed in such a way as to generate proteins with N-terminal amino acids other than methionine. Previous studies showed that changing the N-terminal amino acid of a protein (N-end rule targeting) (17Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12142-12149Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar) can result in a markedly altered stability of that protein (10Varshavsky A.

Fig. 1 shows a schematic representation of the EBNA1 constructs used in this study. To determine the intracellular kinetics of ubiquitinated EBNA1, an EBV-negative B cell line (DG75) was transiently transfected with expression vectors pEGFP-N1, EBNA1-GFP, Ub-Gly/Met-EBNA1-GFP, Ub-Ala/Arg-EBNA1-GFP, Ub-Gly/Arg-EBNA1-GFP, Ub-Ala/Met-EBNA1-GFP, or EBNA-GAr-del-GFP, and protein expression was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis following incubation with cycloheximide. The intensity of EBNA1-GFP band was measured by densitometric analysis. Representative data from this analysis are shown in Fig.2. Full-length EBNA1-GFP and GFP were highly stable in these cells, and even after a 120-min chase, >90% of the protein was detectable (Fig. 2, A andG). In contrast, cells transfected with the expression vectors Ub-Ala/Arg-EBNA1-GFP, Ub-Gly/Arg-EBNA1-GFP, Ub-Ala/Met-EBNA1-GFP, or EBNA-GAr-del-GFP showed a dramatic reduction in the stability of EBNA1, with almost 50% of the protein being degraded within the first 60 min (Fig. 2, C–F, and Fig.3). By 120 min, 60–80% of the protein was degraded. EBNA1-GFP protein in cells transfected with the Ub-Gly/Met-EBNA1-GFP construct was relatively stable, with only 20% degradation within the first 60 min (Figs. 2 B and 3). Densitometric analysis indicated that the half-life for the native form of the EBNA1 was >120 min, whereas the half-life for the ubiquitinated forms with strong degradation signals and also the GAr-deleted form of EBNA1 was between 60 and 120 min (Fig. 3). To demonstrate that the expression of the Ub-EBNA1-GFP protein does not effect cell viability, the immunoblots were also probed with a specific antibody to demonstrate the stability of actin over the time course of the experiment. Representative data from the EBNA1-GAr-del cycloheximide-treated transfectants are shown in Fig. 2 H. A similar pattern of stable actin expression was also observed for the other transfectants (data not shown). Notably, the cells transfected with Ub-Ala/Met-EBNA1-GFP construct showed two distinct species, whereas other ubiquitinated forms of EBNA1 showed a single species (Fig. 2). Both of these species showed an identical pattern of degradation. It is possible that the low molecular weight polypeptide may be derived from a distinct cleavage event.Figure 3Densitometric analysis of EBNA1-GFP expression. Band intensities were quantified by analysis of the imaging data and plotted as a relative percentage of the signal at time 0 for EBNA1-GFP, Ub-Gly/Met-EBNA1-GFP, Ub-Ala/Met-EBNA1-GFP, Ub-Ala/Arg-EBNA1-GFP, Ub-Gly/Arg-EBNA1-GFP, and EBNA1-GAr-del-GFP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm these results, each of the transfectants were incubated with the proteasome inhibitor Cbz-L3. As shown in Fig.4, full-length EBNA1 fusion proteins were readily detected in DG75 cells transfected with the EBNA1-GFP and Ub-Gly/Met-EBNA1-GFP expression constructs, and their expression remained unaffected following treatment of the transfected cells with the proteasome inhibitor Cbz-L3. In contrast, cells transfected with the Ub-Ala/Met-EBNA1-GFP, Ub-Ala/Arg-EBNA1-GFP, or Ub-Gly/Arg-EBNA1-GFP constructs displayed low levels of full-length EBNA1-GFP fusion proteins, indicating that specific targeting of EBNA1 through the proteasomal pathway dramatically reduced the stability of this protein. Incubation of these transfected cells with Cbz-L3 led to the detection of significantly enhanced levels of EBNA1-GFP (Fig. 4). Thus, Cbz-L3 prevents intracellular degradation of the ubiquitinated EBNA1-GFP fusion proteins targeted through the proteasomal pathway. Consistent with the immunoblot assays, GFP fluorescence analysis by FACScan of DG75 cells transfected with the expression vectors encoding EBNA1-GFP, Ub-Ala/Met-EBNA1-GFP, Ub-Ala/Arg-EBNA1-GFP, or Ub-Gly/Arg-EBNA1 also showed a similar pattern of expression in the presence or absence of the Cbz-L3 inhibitor. Representative data from this analysis are shown in Fig. 5. The number of GFP-positive cells following transfection with the EBNA1-GFP construct remained constant over the 48-h period and increased slightly following treatment with proteasome inhibitor Cbz-L3. In contrast, a reduction in the number of GFP-positive cells was seen over the 48 h period when DG75 cells were transfected with Ub-Ala/Met-EBNA1, Ub-Ala/Arg-EBNA1, or Ub-Gly/Arg-EBNA1, whereas the number of GFP-positive cells increased significantly in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 5). It is important to point out that the number of GFP-positive cells following transfection with ubiquitin-conjugated EBNA1 constructs was consistently lower compared with cells transfected with the EBNA1-GFP construct. This was presumably due to the enhanced degradation of EBNA1 through the proteasome pathway. To ensure that these results were not influenced by the transfection efficiency of the individual constructs, we conducted a longitudinal analysis (at the indicated time points) of GFP expression for each construct in the presence or absence of Cbz-L3. Data from this analysis are presented as the relative percentage of GFP-positive cells (Fig. 6). It is clear from this analysis that the number of GFP-positive cells following transfection with the EBNA1-GFP construct remained almost constant from 24 h posttransfection (PT) to 48 h PT. On the other hand, a gradual reduction in relative GFP-positive cells was observed for Ub-Ala/Met-EBNA1, Ub-Ala/Arg-EBNA1, and Ub-Gly/Arg-EBNA1 transfectants. This reduction was more pronounced in DG75 cells transfected with the Ub-Gly/Arg-EBNA1 construct. A reversal in this reduction of GFP-positive cells was seen following treatment of these transfectants with Cbz-L3 (Fig. 6). Although some increase in relative GFP-positive cells was seen for EBNA1-GFP transfectants in the presence of Cbz-L3, this increment was clearly more enhanced in ubiquitin-conjugated EBNA1 constructs. A similar effect on GFP expression was also observed in the presence of another proteasome inhibitorN-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (data not shown). These data clearly demonstrate that covalent linkage to ubiquitin and N-end rule targeting of EBNA1 overrides the GAr-mediated inhibitory effect on the proteasome-mediated intracellular degradation and thus may enhance endogenous presentation of CTL epitopes from EBNA1.Figure 6Longitudinal analysis of GFP-fluorescence in DG75 cells transfected with expression vectors encoding EBNA1-GFP, Ub-Ala/Met-EBNA1-GFP, Ub-Ala/Arg-EBNA1-GFP, or Ub-Gly/Arg-EBNA1-GFP. GFP-positive cells were assessed at 24, 28, 32, 36, and 48 h PT in the absence or presence of the proteasome inhibitor Cbz-L3 (10 μm). Results are expressed as the percentage of GFP-positive cells relative to the number of fluorescing cells at 24 h PT for each transfectant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test the hypothesis that the rapid degradation of EBNA1 through the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway may enhance de novo CTL responses in vivo, five different groups of BALB/c mice were immunized with plasmid DNA vectors encoding either EBNA1, Ub-Ala/Met-EBNA1, Ub-Ala/Arg-EBNA1, Ub-Gly/Arg-EBNA1, or pcDNA3.1 vector alone. Following immunization, the CTL response against an H-2Kd-restricted EBNA1 CTL epitope (VYGGSKTSL) (12Mukherjee S. Trivedi P. Dorfman D.M. Klein G. Townsend A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) was assessed. As shown in Fig. 7, mice immunized with the EBNA1 plasmid consistently showed low to undetectable levels of CTL activity against the VYGGSKTSL epitope (Fig.7 A). Detection of low levels of EBNA1-specific responses in mice immunized with native forms of EBNA1 is consistent with the earlier observation in humans, in which occasional EBNA1-specific responses have also been detected in healthy virus carriers (22Blake N. Lee S. Redchenko I. Thomas W. Steven N. Leese A. Steigerwald-Mullen P. Kurilla M.G. Frappier L. Rickinson A. Immunity. 1997; 7: 791-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In contrast, a significantly enhanced EBNA1-specific CTL response was observed following immunization with expression vectors encoding ubiquitinated EBNA1 (Ub-Ala/Met-EBNA1, Ub-Ala/Arg-EBNA1, and Ub-Gly/Arg-EBNA1) (Fig. 7, B–D, respectively). No EBNA1-specific CTL response was detected in mice immunized with the pcDNA3.1 vector alone (data not shown). Epitope-specific lysis by CTLs recovered from the ubiquitinated EBNA1 mice was, on average, 2–3-fold higher than that of CTLs recovered from mice immunized with EBNA1. These results support the conclusions drawn from the data shown in Figs. 2 and 5, as well as demonstrating that ubiquitination of EBNA1 enhances the presentation of CTL epitopes within EBNA1, which in turn results in the induction of strong epitope-specific CTL responsesin vivo. Although data presented in Fig. 7 clearly showed that rapid degradation of EBNA1 can enhance in vivo CTL responses in a murine model, it was important to further confirm these observations by using human class I-restricted EBV-specific CTLs. As shown in Fig. 1, each of the EBNA1 constructs included an HLA bib8-restricted CTL epitope, FLR, within the EBNA1 C-terminal sequence, which allowed the study of endogenous processing of EBNA1 using FLR-specific human CTL clones. An EBV-negative, HLA bib8-positive human keratinocyte line (SVMR6) was transfected with expression vectors encoding EBNA1, Ub-Ala/Met-EBNA1, and Ub-Ala/Arg-EBNA1 or transfected with the vector control pcDNA3.1. These transfectants were maintained in RPMI 1640/10% fetal calf serum medium supplemented with G418. Following G418 selection for 2–4 weeks, EBNA1 expression in transfectants was confirmed and tested for endogenous processing of CTL epitopes in a standard 51Cr-release cytotoxicity assay using a panel of three FLR-specific CTL clones. Representative data from several different experiments are shown in Fig.8 A. Consistent with previous studies (22Blake N. Lee S. Redchenko I. Thomas W. Steven N. Leese A. Steigerwald-Mullen P. Kurilla M.G. Frappier L. Rickinson A. Immunity. 1997; 7: 791-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), SVMR6 cells transfected with the expression vector encoding EBNA1 were poorly recognized by FLR-specific CTL clones, as were SVMR6 cells transfected with the pcDNA3.1 expression vector. This lack of immune recognition of EBNA1 transfectants by FLR-specific CTL clones was not due to inadequate antigen expression, as immunoblot analysis clearly showed strong protein expression in these transfectants (data not shown). In contrast, significantly higher lysis of SVMR6 transfectants expressing ubiquitinated forms of EBNA1 (Ub-Ala/Met-EBNA1 or Ub-Ala/Arg-EBNA1) was observed following exposure to FLR-specific CTL clones LC13, DD1, and GA18 (Fig. 8 A). It is important to point out that this increased lysis is in accordance with the decreased stability of ubiquitinated forms of EBNA1 (as shown in Figs. 2, 5, and 6), which results in lower levels of EBNA1 expression in SVMR6 cells transfected with the Ub-Ala/Arg-EBNA1 construct. Similar results were also obtained with a B cell line transfected with these expression vectors (data not shown). The FLR-specificity of this CTL lysis was confirmed by the lack of immune recognition by another HLA bib8-restricted CTL clone, LC7, which is specific for the QAKWRLQTL epitope (3Rickinson, A. B., and Moss, D. J. (1997) Annu. Rev. Immunol. 15Google Scholar) from EBV (Fig. 8 A). CTL lysis of transfectants expressing ubiquitinated EBNA1 (Ub-Ala/Arg-EBNA1) was blocked following addition of the proteasome inhibitor, Cbz-L3 (Fig. 8 B). Similarly, inhibition of epitope specific lysis of transfectants expressing ubiquitinated EBNA1 (Ub-Ala/Arg-EBNA1) protein was demonstrated following incubation with an anti-class I antibody (W6/32) (Fig. 8 B). To exclude the possibility that the observed FLR-specific CTL recognition was due to exogenously transferred EBNA1 protein or peptides, coculture experiments were conducted. SVMR6 transfectants were mixed with a 51Cr-labeled, EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell line (HLA bib8-positive LC/B95.8, which expresses a mutated form of FLR epitope) to test for transfer of EBNA1 protein or FLR epitope from the transfected SVMR6. The FLR-specific CTL clone LC13 was then added, and lysis of 51Cr-labeled LC/B95.8 cells was assessed. No lysis of LC/B95.8 cells was observed under these conditions. Under identical conditions 51Cr-labeled SVMR6 transfectants or peptide sensitized LC/B95.8 cells were efficiently recognized (data not shown). Collectively, these observations demonstrate that the GAr-mediated inhibitory effect on intracellular degradation of EBNA1 can be reversed by specifically targeting this protein through the ubiquitin/proteasome degradation pathway. Adaptation of a successful latent infection by lymphocryptoviruses, such as EBV, within the cells of the immune system has been achieved by evolving unique mechanisms to negate the hostile effects of the host immune system (2Khanna R. Burrows S.R. Moss D.J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 387-405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Rickinson, A. B., and Moss, D. J. (1997) Annu. Rev. Immunol. 15Google Scholar, 5Trivedi P. Masucci M.G. Winberg G. Klein G. Int. J. Cancer. 1991; 48: 794-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). One classic example is the ability of the EBNA1 protein to inhibit endogenous presentation of CTL epitopes derived from this protein (6Levitskaya J. Coram M. Levitsky V. Imreh S.

A. 1997; 94: 12616-12621Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). This inhibitory effect is mediated by a repeat sequence of glycine and alanine residues included within the EBNA1 sequence (6Levitskaya J. Coram M. Levitsky V. Imreh S. Steigerwald Mullen P.M. Klein G. Kurilla M.G. Masucci M.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 685-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Recent studies have suggested that the GAr forms β-sheets that are resistant to unfolding and thus block the entry of EBNA1 protein into the proteasome complex (7Sharipo A. Imreh M. Leonchiks A. Imreh S. Masucci M.G. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 939-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Because EBNA1 plays a crucial role in the maintenance of the EBV episome in latently infected normal and malignant cells, protection from CTL-mediated immune control may allow the reservoir of latently infected cells to seed other cellular compartments, where EBV can replicate and be transmitted. More importantly, the evasion of CTL-mediated immune control may also explain how EBV-positive BL cells, which express only EBNA1, can survive in immunocompetent hosts (reviewed in Refs. 2Khanna R. Burrows S.R. Moss D.J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 387-405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 4Rickinson, A. B., and Kieff, E. (1996) in Epstein-Barr Virus (Fields, B. N., Knipe, D. M., and Howley, P. M., eds) 3rd Edition, pp. 2397–2446Google Scholar). Thus, any strategies that are capable of overriding the GAr-mediated inhibitory effect on the intracellular degradation of EBNA1 may have important implications for developing therapeutic protocols for the treatment of EBV-associated malignancies. In the present study, we have targeted EBNA1 through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway to enhance its intracellular degradation. This approach was primarily designed on the earlier insights into proteasomal targeting of cellular and other viral proteins (8Rock K.L. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 739-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Considering the importance of stable ubiquitination on intracellular degradation of cellular proteins, we reasoned that covalent linkage of ubiquitin combined with N-end rule targeting may allow efficient unfolding of EBNA1 and subsequent degradation by the proteasomal complex. This hypothesis was also supported by the previous studies of Levitskaya et al. (23Levitskaya J. Sharipo A. Leonchiks A. Ciechanover A. Masucci M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12616-12621Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), who showed that the EBNA1 polypeptide is poorly ubiquitinated in vitro. Indeed, we show here that this approach is extremely effective in overriding the GAr-mediated inhibitory effect on EBNA1 degradation in human cells. Due to effective proteasomal degradation, covalently linked ubiquitinated forms of EBNA1 are rapidly degraded in transfected cells, but this low expression is completely reversed in the presence of a ubiquitin-proteasome inhibitor Cbz-L3. Kinetic analysis indicated that covalent linking of ubiquitin in combination with N-end rule targeting dramatically reduces the intracellular half-life of EBNA1. These results provided a first indication that EBNA1 may not be completely resistant to proteasomal degradation as previously proposed. More importantly, the data also suggested that rapid turnover may lead to the presentation of class I-restricted CTL epitopes within EBNA1. To explore this possibility, we first tested the efficacy of ubiquitinated EBNA1 to induce epitope-specific CTL responses in vivo in a murine model. Expression vectors for three different forms of ubiquitinated EBNA1 and a native EBNA1 were used to immunize different groups of mice. Distinct forms of ubiquitinated EBNA1 allowed us to test whether the covalent linkage and/or N-end rule targeting of EBNA1 was essential to enhance the priming of the EBNA1-specific CTL response in vivo. As expected, immunization with expression vectors encoding native forms of EBNA1 failed to generate any significant CTL response, whereas all three expression vectors encoding different forms of ubiquitinated EBNA1 induced dramatically enhanced CTL responses to the EBNA1 epitope. Although overall, CTL induction with the three different forms of ubiquitinated EBNA1 was quite comparable, it is important to mention here that animals immunized with Ub-Ala/Arg-EBNA1 and Ub-Gly/Arg-EBNA1 (the two EBNA1 constructs with an unstable N-terminal residue) consistently induced slightly higher CTL responses. These results are consistent with our earlier conclusions that rapid intracellular degradation enhances CTL epitope presentation from EBNA1 and thus overrides the GAr-mediated inhibitory effect. The only limitation of these results is that one may argue that this CTL priming may involve exogenous loading by myocytes of intact EBNA1 antigen to professional antigen presenting cells through cross priming. Indeed, Blake et al. (22Blake N. Lee S. Redchenko I. Thomas W. Steven N. Leese A. Steigerwald-Mullen P. Kurilla M.G. Frappier L. Rickinson A. Immunity. 1997; 7: 791-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) have previously shown that the exogenous presentation of class I-restricted epitopes within EBNA1 is not inhibited by GAr sequences. However, it is unlikely that the CTL responses in our study were induced by the uptake of intact ubiquitinated protein released by myocytes because, as stated above, ubiquitinated EBNA1 is rapidly degraded and is barely detectable in cells expressing this protein. This argument is supported by previous studies that have shown only high levels of antigen can efficiently cross-prime CD8+ T cells, whereas low dose antigens are ignored (24Carbone F.R. Kurts C. Bennett S.R. Miller J.F. Heath W.R. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 368-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We therefore favor the hypothesis that the mechanism underlying the CTL priming of EBNA1 involves uptake of DNA, rather than intact soluble protein by the antigen presenting cells in the draining lymph nodes, and that when this DNA encodes a ubiquitinated protein, an enhanced CTL response is observed. This argument is also supported by earlier studies on CTL priming with DNA immunization (25Manickan E. Kanangat S. Rouse R.J., Yu, Z. Rouse B.T. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 26Rodriguez F. Zhang J. Whitton J.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8497-8503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further support our conclusions drawn from the murine model, we also tested endogenous presentation of CTL epitopes within EBNA1 using human EBV-specific CTL assays. This in vitro testing was based on the endogenous presentation of a well defined HLA bib8-restricted CTL epitope (referred to as FLR) that was inserted into the EBNA1 sequence near the C terminus. Consistent with our data from the murine model, human keratinocyte and B cell lines transfected with ubiquitinated forms of EBNA1 showed higher levels of CTL-mediated lysis compared with lysis of cells transfected with native EBNA1 alone. This lysis was almost entirely blocked by incubation with the proteasome inhibitor, Cbz-L3, suggesting that specific targeting of EBNA1 through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an important role in overriding the GAr-mediated inhibitory effect. Based on the results presented in this study, we speculate that the GAr prevents not only proteasomal degradation but also ubiquitination of native EBNA1 in virus-infected cells. It is likely that the GAr-containing EBNA1 sequence folds in such a way that a stable association with ubiquitin is not possible and that this prevents polyubiquitination and hence results in inadequate targeting of this protein to the proteasomal complex. The covalent linkage of ubiquitin, combined with N-end rule targeting, overrides this blockage and allows efficient presentation of CTL epitopes from EBNA1. These observations are also supported by recent results based on the degradation studies using GAr-fused GFP reporter substrates (27Dantuma N.P. Heessen S. Lindsten K. Jellne M. Masucci M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8381-8385Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Overall, the data presented here have important implications for the development of strategies designed to control EBV-associated diseases. It is now well established that not only is EBNA1 expression critical for the long term persistence of EBV, but it also acts as a fundamental factor in the pathogenesis of many EBV-associated malignancies. Targeting this antigen through immunological or biochemical intervention(s) could provide a unique opportunity to manage the pathological consequences of many EBV-associated diseases. Indeed, data presented here provide, for the first time, encouraging evidence that it may be possible to develop therapeutic strategies to modulate the stability of EBNA1 in normal and malignant cells. These strategies may involve treatment of virus-infected cells with synthetic or biological mediators capable of enhancing stable ubiquitination and rapid intracellular degradation of EBNA1 in vivo. One such strategy recently proposed by Zhouet al. (28Zhou P. Bogacki R. McReynolds L. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 751-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) may involve manipulation of the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic machinery by targeting specific E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases to direct the degradation of otherwise stable cellular proteins, such as EBNA1, in mammalian cells. Potentially, this engineered proteolysis system could be used as a therapeutic method to counteract the proteasomal block conferred on EBNA1 through the cis-acting inhibitory GAr domain.

The PC1 inhibitory sequence is mostly confined within a 10–12-amino acid segment near the C terminus of the conserved human proSAAS and contains the critical KR244 dibasic motif. Our results show that the decapeptide proSAAS-(235–244)235VLGALLRVKR244 is the most potent reversible competitive PC1-inhibitor (K i ∼9 nm). The C-terminally extended proSAAS-(235–246) exhibits a 5–6-fold higher K i (∼51 nm). The additional LE sequence at P1′-P2′, resulted in a competitive substrate cleaved by PC1 at KR244↓LE246. Systematic alanine scanning and in some cases lysine scanning tested the contribution of each residue within proSAAS-(235–246) toward the PC1-inhibition's specificity and potency. The amino acids P1 Arg, P2 Lys, and P4 Arg are all critical for inhibition. Moreover, the aliphatic P3 Val and P5, P6, and P1′ Leu significantly affect the degree of enzyme inactivation and PC1 specificity. Interestingly, a much longer N- and C-terminally extended endogenous rat proSAAS-(221–254) called little PenLen, was found to be a 3-fold less potent PC1 inhibitor with reduced selectivity but a much better substrate than proSAAS-(235–246).

These sites are generally composed of a pair of basic amino acids within the consensus sequence of R/K/H-X n-R↓, wheren = 0, 2, 4, or 6 and X represents any amino acid except cysteine. Numerous potential substrates have so far been identified for PCs. These include hormonal peptides and growth factors, their receptors, cell surface proteins, bacterial toxins, envelope viral glycoproteins, enzymes, transcription factors, and others (1Seidah N.G.

All PCs are initially synthesized as inactive zymogens that must be proteolytically activated through the autocatalytic cleavage of their inhibitory N-terminal prosegment. A number of studies have already revealed this unique property of prodomains in the regulation of enzymatic activity (6Leduc R. Molloy S.S. Thorne B.A. Thomas G. J. Biol.

However, at least for the neuroendocrine convertases PC1 and PC2, their cellular activity is controlled by endogenous inhibitors. Thus, co-localization, in situhybridization, and other biochemical studies revealed that the production of enzymatically active PC2 requires the presence of a binding protein 7B2 (10Seidah N.G.

J. 357,329–342 Subsequent deletion and alanine-scanning studies identified the inhibitor segment as a 16-aa fragment of the 31-aa C-terminal domain of 7B2 (13Apletalina E.V. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Lindberg I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 940-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Recently, a granin-like 26-kDa (258–260-aa) neuroendocrine secretory protein, called proSAAS, was identified as a specific PC1 inhibitor (14Fricker L.D. McKinzie A.A. Sun J. Curran E. Qian Y. Yan L. Patterson S.D. Courchesne P.L. Richards B. Levin N. Mzhavia N. Devi L.A. Douglass J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 639-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that while proSAAS and 7B2 are not homologous, they are of similar size, with an N-terminal proline-rich region; both contain several pairs of basic amino acids and are broadly expressed in neural and endocrine tissues. Very recently, proSAAS was shown to specifically inhibit PC1 and not furin, PC2, PC5, or PC7 (15Qian Y. Devi L.A. Mzhavia N. Munzer S. Seidah N.G. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23596-23601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The processing profile of proSAAS was recently reported and revealed that it is cleaved in a tissue-specific fashion at its C terminus into smaller inhibitory peptides (15Qian Y. Devi L.A. Mzhavia N.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The inhibitory segment was mapped to a short 6–12-aa sequence near its C terminus that contains a critical Arg244 (human proSAAS nomenclature) located at the processing site235VLGALLRVKR↓LE246 (15Qian Y.

Lindberg I. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the peptide LLRVKR was previously identified from a combinatorial peptide library screen aimed at identifying specific PC1 inhibitors (18Apletalina E. Appel J. Lamango N.S. Houghten R.A. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26589-26595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The in vitro inhibition of PC1 by these short peptides was at least 17-fold better than with the full-length proSAAS (15Qian Y. Devi L.A. Mzhavia N. Munzer S. Seidah N.G. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23596-23601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was reported that the 66-kDa processed form of PC1 is better inhibited by proSAAS than is its 87-kDa precursor (15Qian Y. Devi L.A. Mzhavia N. Munzer S. Seidah N.G. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23596-23601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). In this article, we present detailed kinetic studies on the specificity and potency of PC1 inhibition by the above 12-mer proSAAS peptide and its mutants. Data obtained for the wild type sequence as well as from alanine and lysine scans allowed the identification of the critical aa within this sequence. The specificity and potency of these peptides was also tested against other PCs such as the mammalian furin, PACE4, PC5, PC7, and yeast kexin. The 12-mer proSAAS peptides were compared with that of rat proSAAS-(221–254), also known as little PenLen, which is one of the major processing forms of proSAAS in AtT20 cells (14Fricker L.D. McKinzie A.A. Sun J. Curran E. Qian Y. Yan L. Patterson S.D. Courchesne P.L. Richards B. Levin N. Mzhavia N. Devi L.A. Douglass J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 639-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, circular dichroism and molecular modeling studies were used to correlate the secondary structure of the inhibitory peptides to their potency of PC1 inhibition. All Fmoc protected amino acids (l-configuration), the coupling reagents, and the solvents were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Calbiochem-Novabiochem, and Chem Impex International, (Wood Dale, IL). The peptides, prepared with carboxyl terminus in the amide form (CONH2) are listed in Table I. The synthesis was accomplished on a solid phase automated peptide synthesizer instrument (Pioneer; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), following theO-hexafluorophospho-[7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl]-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium/diisopropyl ethyl amine-mediated Fmoc chemistry (19Basak A. Zhong M. Munzer J.S. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The peptides were purified by RP-HPLC on C18 semipreparative (0.94 × 25 cm) and analytical columns (0.46 × 25 cm, Jupitor; Phenomenex) using conditions previously described (19Basak A. Zhong M.

The identities of all peptides and their digests were confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry using a Voyageur DE-Pro instrument (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with α-cyano-4-hydroxycynnamic acid and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (Aldrich) as matrices (7Zhong M.

All of the recombinant forms of PCs were produced by using the vaccinia virus constructs of soluble human furin-BTMD (before transmembrane domain): human PACE4, mouse PC1, mouse PC5A, rat PC7-BTMD, and yeast kexin-BTMD. The enzymes were recovered from serum-free culture media as reported previously (15Qian Y. Devi L.A. Mzhavia N. Munzer S. Seidah N.G. Fricker L.D. J. Biol.

The recombinant mPC1 used in the present study is obtained from expression of its full-length cDNA, but it contains mostly the C-terminal truncated and enzymatically more active 66-kDa form and some 74- and 87-kDa form as well. All enzyme assays were performed with the fluorogenic substrate pyroglutamyl-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide (Peptides International, Louisville, KY) at pH of either 7.4 (furin) or 6.5 (for other PCs). The assay buffer in all cases was composed of 25 mm Tris, 25 mm Mes, 2.5 mmCaCl2. The concentration of the substrate was maintained at 100 µm unless otherwise mentioned. The amounts of enzymes used were adjusted so as to give approximately the same hydrolytic activity (3.9–4.5 nmol of AMC released/h of incubation) in an aliquot of 5 µl. The release of fluorescence was monitored for 6 h using a spectrofluorometer (Gemini, Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 370 and 460 nm, respectively). Enzymatic activities were measured either from raw fluorescence readings in end time assay or from the progress curves. The fluorescence of released AMC was measured on-line with a spectrofluorometer every 60 s up to 60 min, and the slope of each curve was assessed with the computer-generated highest point fit. For K i determination, various peptide concentrations (0.12 nm to 700 µm) were incubated at 37 °C with respective enzyme (5 µl) in the above described buffer (100 µl) in the presence of at least two different concentrations of fluorogenic substrate, pERTKR-MCA (100, 50, 25 or 12.5 µm) (7Zhong M. Munzer J.S. Basak A. Benjannet S. Mowla S.J. Decroly E. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33913-33920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 15Qian Y.

The precise concentration range was selected so as to produce an inhibition of 20–80% of initial activity. For all kinetic measurements, the peptides were preincubated with enzyme for 15 min prior to the addition of the substrate. All assays were performed in duplicate for two independent experiments on a 96-well microplates (flat bottom, black; Dynatec).K i was estimated from Dixon plots, while for IC50 value, a double reciprocal Lineweaver-Burk plot was used (15Qian Y.

J. 2001; 353: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Both initial rate and end time assays were used, and the values obtained for the measured parameter were averaged. Each proSAAS peptide including the little PenLen (20 µm) was incubated for 6 h or overnight at 37 °C with PC1, furin, PACE4, kexin, PC5, or PC7 (5 µl) in buffer (100 µl) as described. The enzyme digests were separated by RP-HPLC using a C18 analytical column with a diode ray detector (Varian, Prostar, CA), and the peaks were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Each proSAAS peptide (750 nm or 25 µm) was preincubated with enzyme (5 µl) for 15 min in buffer (100 µl) before the addition of fluorogenic substrate, pERTKR-MCA (100 µm). Fluorescence readings were measured following overnight incubation and compared with the control experiment run in parallel without the peptide. For this study, a representative peptide (proSAAS-(235–244), Table I) (20 µm) was preincubated with PC1 (5 µl) for 0, 5, 10, 15, and 30 min in buffer (100 µl) before the addition of substrate pERTKR-MCA (100 µm). Control experiments were run in parallel without the peptide, and the fluorescence readings were measured after 6 h of reaction. All CD measurements were carried out with a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter instrument (Easton, MD) using a 100-µl solution of each peptide in distilled water (concentration 0.2–0.5 mg/ml) in a quartz cell (1-mm path length) as described (20Seebach D Sifferien T. Mathieu P.A. Hane A.M. Krell C.M. Bierbaum D.J. Abele S. Helv. Chim. Acta. 2000; 83: 2849-2864Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The final corrected CD spectra were obtained by subtracting the spectrum obtained with control water from those of crude samples. Three-dimensional theoretical structures of proSAAS peptides and their mutants were generated by computer software hyperchem (version 5.0; Hypercube) with Robek-Polard energy minimization carried out at ambient temperature. Based on earlier studies (15Qian Y. Devi L.A. Mzhavia N. Munzer S. Seidah N.G. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23596-23601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we selected the 12-mer human/rat proSAAS 235VLGALLRVKRLE246 (same as in proSAAS-(233–242) in mouse sequence) as a model peptide for detailed kinetic analysis and positional scanning. As shown in Fig.1, the N-terminal 10 aa of this inhibitory peptide represent the C terminus of the natural processing product obtained by PC1 cleavages at PRRLRR220 and LLRVKR244 and contain the critical Arg244 (15Qian Y.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Table I lists all of the 19 peptides synthesized, including little PenLen, and analyzed in this work. These include the wild type sequence and its 11 Ala derivatives; three Lys mutants at P1, P4, and P1 + P4; and a P3 + P5 double Ala mutant. Finally, in order to compare the effects of P′ residues on inhibition, we also synthesized the wild type proSAAS-(235–244)235VLGALLRVKR244 as well as its all-dextro derivative. The measured K i of all of the above proSAAS peptides against PC1 and in some cases against furin, PC5, and PC7 are presented in Table II. The competitive nature of inhibition of PC1 by both wild type proSAAS-(235–246) (Fig.2A) and its mutants (not shown) as well as proSAAS-(235–244) (Fig. 2 B) was demonstrated by Dixon plots conducted at four different concentrations of the fluorogenic substrate pERTKR-MCA. The near linear regression and the presence of a single point of intersection are evident. However, a close examination of the graphs revealed a slight hyperbolic nature. This may perhaps be due to some artifact, to the presence of multiple PC1 forms in the enzyme preparation, or alternatively to the adsorption of the peptide or enzyme to the sample tubes. The competitive nature of this inhibition was further confirmed by an observed linear increase of IC50 with substrate concentration (not shown) (21Williams J.W. Morrison J.F.

The lowest Ki value is indicated by an underline. Open table in a new tab K i values were determined using the linear regression of Dixon plot and Graphit software as described under “Experimental Procedures.” NI, no inhibition, all data were acquired in duplicate and then averaged. The lowest Ki value is indicated by an underline. Overall, the data indicated that the 10-mer235VLGALLRVKR244 lacking any P′ residues was the most powerful PC1 inhibitor (K i ∼9 nm). This value is 5.7-fold lower than the ∼50.5 nm calculated for the K i of the C-terminally extended 12-mer 235VLGALLRVKRLE246 (Table II). Although both peptides are selective PC1 inhibitors, the C-terminal Leu-Glu extension resulted in an enhancement of selectivity for PC1 inhibition by 27- and 57-fold as compared with furin and PC5, respectively. Interestingly, the ∼100-fold lower inhibitory potency toward PC7 was not affected by the dipeptide insertion. Noticeably, Ala mutation of either the P1′ Leu or the P2′ Glu resulted in a drastic loss of potency and selectivity toward PC1 inhibition. This means that the nature of these residues is critical for the observed high PC1-selective inhibitory property of proSAAS-(235–246). Finally, it is worth mentioning that the Ala mutation of P1′ Leu resulted in a complete loss of PC1 selectivity as compared with furin, whereas the P2′ Glu to Ala mutation had a 14-fold lesser effect (Table II). This is reminiscent of the observed critical importance of P1′ Leu for the processing of prorenin that is cleaved by PC1 but not at all by furin (24Benjannet S. Reudelhuber T. Mercure C. Rondeau N. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11417-11423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, we note that the loss of selectivity toward PC1 versus PC5 and PC7 is somewhat similar for either Ala mutants but not as drastic as the P1′ mutation for furin. As indicated in Table II, PenLen or rat proSAAS-(221–254) inhibits PC1 with K i ∼120 nm, nearly 3- and 13-fold less efficiently than proSAAS-(235–246) and proSAAS-(235–244), respectively. It also displayed a reduced level of selectivity toward PC1 inhibition as compared with furin, PC7, and especially PC5 (TableII). In order to extend those data and include other convertases such as human PACE4 and yeast kexin, in Fig. 3we present in a bar graph format the extent of enzyme inhibition by 750 nm proSAAS peptides and their selected mutants. For this purpose, we used a 4-h stop time assay in which the level of each enzyme used was adjusted so as to give similar initial pERTKR-MCA activity. In agreement with the K i data (Table II), the shorter 10-mer is more potent than the 12-mer proSAAS peptide on PC1, furin, PC5, and PC7 (Fig. 3, first row). In contrast, PACE4 is not inhibited by either peptide even at this high concentration, whereas kexin is ∼50% inhibited by the 12-mer peptide and not at all by the 10-mer one. The chirality of inhibition is evident by the fact that the all-dextro derivative of the 10-mer peptide does not significantly affect the activity of any enzyme tested. Although not shown, Ala mutations at P1′ and P2′ follow the expected pattern from Table II (i.e. they are both important for the selective inhibition of PC1). The critical importance of the three basic residues at P1, P2, and P4 is also evident, since their Ala mutants lost most of their inhibitory properties against all enzymes (Table II, Fig. 3, second row). Furthermore, Arg to Lys mutations at either P1, P4, or P1 + P4 resulted in a drastic loss of PC1 inhibition, especially for the P4 or P1 + P4 mutations (Table II). These data attest to the critical importance of Arg at the P1 and P4 positions and a basic residue at P2. In addition, the aliphatic residues Val at P3 and P10, and Leu at P5, P6, and P9 also contribute to the inhibitory potency and selectivity of proSAAS-(235–246) toward PC1, with the P9 Leu and P3 Val positions being the most critical (Table II, Fig. 3, third andfourth rows). We also tested whether double P3 Val and P5 Leu to Ala mutations could further influence the inhibitory selectivity of proSAAS-(235–246) toward PC1 versus other convertases. Interestingly, the double mutant is a better inhibitor of furin (K i ∼127 nm) as compared with PC1, PC5, and PC7 (Table II). 246) and Its Ala Mutants by PCs—Previously, it was demonstrated that radioiodinated Tyr + mouse SAAS219–258 was internally cleaved by PC1 (17Cameron A. Fortenberry Y. Lindberg I. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), suggesting that PC1 is inhibited by proSAAS by a mechanism similar to that of PC2 by 7B2 (13Apletalina E.V. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Lindberg I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 940-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 25Lindberg I. Van den Herk W.H. Bui C. Batie C.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5486-5493Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, the exact cleavage site of the PenLen peptide was not determined in this previous study (17Cameron A. Fortenberry Y. Lindberg I. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To determine this cleavage site as well as to examine whether human proSAAS-(235–246) behaves as a competitive substrate, it was incubated for 18 h with PC1 in the presence of the fluorogenic substrate pERTKR-MCA. The RP-HPLC of the crude digest and the mass spectral data of the isolated peaks are shown in Fig.4. Unlike the fluorogenic peptide, which was partially cleaved by PC1, the peptide proSAAS-(235–246) (R t = 33.7 min; (M + H)+ = 1,369) was completely digested, giving the expected decapeptide VLGALLRVKR244↓ (R t = 21.7 min; (M + H)+ = 1,123). The C-terminal dipeptide LE product eluted with the injection peak and was not analyzed. The two other peaks atR t = 23.1 and 15.1 min were characterized by mass spectrometry as the unreacted fluorogenic substrate pERTKR-MCA ((M + H)+ = 830) and its N-terminal product pERTKR-OH ((M + H)+ = 668).

https://openalex.org/W2061695878,"Calcium has been implicated in regulating vesicle fusion reactions, but its potential role in regulating other aspects of protein transport, such as vesicle assembly, is largely unexplored. We find that treating cells with the membrane-permeable calcium chelator, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester) (BAPTA-AM), leads to a dramatic redistribution of the vesicle coat protein, coatomer, in the cell. We have used the cell-free reconstitution of coat-protomer I (COPI) vesicle assembly to characterize the mechanisms of this redistribution. We find that the recovery of COPI-coated Golgi vesicles is inhibited by the addition of BAPTA to the cell-free vesicle budding assay. When coatomer-coated membranes are incubated in the presence of calcium chelators, the membranes “uncoat,” indicating that calcium is necessary for maintaining the integrity of the coat. This uncoating is reversed by the addition of calcium. Interestingly, BAPTA, a calcium chelator with fast binding kinetics, is more potent at uncoating the coatomer-coated membrane than EGTA, suggesting that a calcium transient or a calcium gradient is important for stabilizing COPI vesicle coat. The primary target for the effects of calcium on coatomer recruitment is a step that occurs after ADP-ribosylation factor binding to the membrane.

One particularly well characterized role for calcium is in signaling via G protein-coupled receptors that activate phospholipase C to produce IP31 and diacylglycerol (1Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2261) Google Scholar). This signaling pathway utilizes calcium stores that are maintained in the ER by the action of a sarco-/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) (1Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2261) Google Scholar, 2Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Volpe P. Meldolesi J. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 595-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Increased IP3levels cause the IP3-receptor calcium channels on the ER to open, generating a transient rise in cytosolic calcium. Increased calcium levels act through a number of different effectors, such as calmodulin, to regulate downstream processes. Calcium also plays a well characterized role in regulating membrane fusion reactions. During calcium-regulated exocytosis, the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels on the plasma membrane results in an increase in cytosolic calcium levels that triggers vesicle fusion at the cell surface and the release of cargo. This process has been best characterized for synaptic transmission (3Lin R.C. Scheller R.H. Ann. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 19-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Besides regulated exocytosis, calcium may play a more widely utilized role in membrane fusion reactions. Studies on ER to Golgi transport in yeast and in semi-intact (perforated) cells have indicated a clear role for calcium in this trafficking step (4Beckers C.J.M. Balch W.E. J.

More recent studies have implicated calcium in homotypic vacuolar fusion (8Peters C. Mayer A. Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), in late endosome-lysosome heterotypic fusion and the reformation of lysosomes from hybrid organelles (9Pryor P.R. Mullock B.M. Bright N.A. Gray S.R. Luzio J.P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), in fusion between endosomal compartments (10Mayorga L.S. Beron W. Sarrouf M.N.

Calmodulin has been shown to mediate the effects of calcium in fusion reactions (8Peters C. Mayer A. Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 12Colombo M.I. Beron W. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7707-7712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Although many studies have focused on the role of calcium in the late secretory pathway, an emerging body of literature is implicating calcium in the regulation of protein trafficking thorough the Golgi apparatus. For instance, it is now appreciated that the Golgi apparatus is an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca2+ store (13Pinton P. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5298-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) and that proteins involved in sequestering and releasing calcium are localized to the Golgi apparatus (14Scherer P.E. Lederkremer G.Z. Williams S. Fogliano M. Baldini G. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 15Lin P. Le-Niculescu H. Hofmeister R. McCaffery J.M.

Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These proteins include a SERCA-like ATPase and IP3 receptor channels (13Pinton P. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5298-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 17Taylor R.S. Jones S.M. Dahl R.H. Nordeen M.H. Howell K.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1911-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). One very interesting protein in this regard is CALNUC (nucleobindin), a calcium-binding protein found in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus (15Lin P. Le-Niculescu H. Hofmeister R. McCaffery J.M. Jin M. Hennemann H. McQuistan T. De Vries L. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1515-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). CALNUC, an EF-hand protein, has been shown to be the major calcium-binding protein in the Golgi and to be involved in maintaining SERCA-sensitive and IP3-sensitive calcium stores (16Lin P. Yong Y. Hofmeister R. Tsien R.Y. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The clearest evidence for the role of calcium in regulating protein trafficking in the Golgi has come from a study using the cell-free reconstitution of intra-Golgi trafficking (18Porat A. Elazar Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29233-29237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In that study, the calcium chelator BAPTA and reagents that disrupt cellular calcium stores were found to be potent inhibitors of Golgi transport. Interestingly, the regulation of Golgi transport by calcium was also found to involve calmodulin, as has been noted for the effects of calcium on endosomal fusion (12Colombo M.I. Beron W. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7707-7712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Endosome fusion, vacuolar fusion, and Golgi trafficking are inhibited to a greater extent by BAPTA than EGTA (8Peters C. Mayer A. Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 9Pryor P.R. Mullock B.M. Bright N.A. Gray S.R. Luzio J.P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 10Mayorga L.S. Beron W. Sarrouf M.N. Colombo M.I. Creutz C. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30927-30934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Porat A. Elazar Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29233-29237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Because BAPTA has considerably faster association and dissociation kinetics for calcium than EGTA (19Tsien R.Y. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2396-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar), these findings are often interpreted to indicate that a calcium transient or a calcium gradient is required (18Porat A. Elazar Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29233-29237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). BAPTA has a faster on-rate for calcium and therefore would be able to buffer a calcium transient or gradient that would not be affected by a chelator with a slower on-rate, such as EGTA. The studies described above indicate that calcium plays a fundamental role in regulating protein trafficking through membrane fusion reactions. In this study, we have examined whether calcium plays a more general role in regulating vesicular transport using the formation of COPI-coated transport vesicles at the Golgi apparatus as a model system. The following antibodies were used in this study: monoclonal anti-ARF antibody MA3–060 (Affinity BioReagents Inc., Golden, CO), monoclonal antibodies to β-COP, M3A5 and maD (Sigma), monoclonal anti ε-COP (20Hara-Kuge S. Kuge O. Orci L. Amherdt M. Ravazzola M. Wieland F.T. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), monoclonal anti-rat mannosidase II (Berkeley Antibody Co., Richmond, CA), and anti-syntaxin 6 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). Rat and rabbit liver Golgi membranes and bovine-brain cytosol were prepared as described previously (21Malhotra V. Serafini T. Orci L. Shepherd J.C. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1989; 58: 329-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). BAPTA, EGTA, and TPEN were from Sigma, and BAPTA-AM was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other materials were reagent grade and were purchased from commercial sources. Golgi binding assays were carried out by sedimentation or by flotation as described previously (22Fucini R.V.

For the two-step experiments involving separate incubations with ARF1 and a coatomer source, Golgi membranes were incubated as described except that the cytosol was replaced with the constitutively active mutant human ARF1(Q71L) that had been expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by DEAE chromatography (23Vasudevan C. Han W. Tan Y. Nie Y. Li D. Shome K. Watkins S.C. Levitan E.S. Romero G. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1277-1285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,24Helms J.B. Palmer D.J. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). After 20 min at 37 °C, Golgi membranes were sedimented through a 15% sucrose cushion, and the pellets were incubated in a second reaction with cytosol. GTP (20 μm) and calcium chelators were included in the incubations as indicated. Following the second incubation, the membranes were reisolated by centrifugation and processed for Western blotting. Vesicle budding assays were carried out as described previously (22Fucini R.V. Navarette A. Vadakkan C. Lacomis L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Stamnes M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18824-18829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The vesicles were stripped from the membrane by incubating in HSSB (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 250 mm potassium chloride, 0.2 m sucrose) for 10 min on ice. Following the incubation, the membranes were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a 35% (w/w) sucrose cushion (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 250 mm potassium chloride, 35% (w/w) sucrose) and centrifuged at 350,000 ×g for 30 min. The 35% sucrose pellets were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. A two-stage assay was used for the uncoating experiments. The coatomer-bound Golgi membranes were isolated as described above (stage 1) and then reincubated at 37 °C for varying lengths of time in the presence or absence of chelators in a reaction mixture identical to the one used for coatomer binding (stage 2). The reaction mixture was then subjected to centrifugation at 15,000 × gav for 20 min at 4 °C. Both the pellet and the supernatant were processed for Western blotting as described above. The effect of BAPTA on COPI vesicles was assessed by incubating the 250 mm KCl supernatant from budding reactions (see above) with BAPTA for 10 min at 37 °C prior to isolating the vesicles over the 35% sucrose cushion. For the recoating experiments, the coatomer-bound Golgi membranes were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min, following which CaCl2(final concentration, 5 mm) or an equivalent volume of water was added to the reaction mixture, and the incubation was continued for another 20 min at 37 °C. The reaction mixtures were then centrifuged and the pellets prepared as described above for the “float-up” binding assay. Proteins were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using the standard protocol for the Bio-Rad minigel and blotting apparatuses. Following the transfer, the membranes were dried and incubated with appropriate dilutions of the indicated primary antibodies. The signal was visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad) and ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Where indicated, the signals were quantified by densitometry using Scan Analysis software (Biosoft, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and NRK cells were grown on coverslips for 20–24 h in α-minimum Eagle's medium (α-MEM) with 5% fetal bovine serum, washed with serum-free medium, and then treated with or without 50 μmBAPTA-AM dissolved in anhydrous Me2SO (final concentration, 0.1%) or 0.1% anhydrous Me2SO in serum-free medium for varying lengths of time. For the expression of the ARF1-GFP fusion protein, human ARF1 was cloned usingEcoRI and BamHI sites into the pEGFP vector. NRK cells were transfected with this ARF1-GFP construct using Lipofectin® as per the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Following the treatment, the cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 3–4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. After the cells were rinsed with PBS, the aldehyde groups were quenched with 50 mm ammonium chloride in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were washed with PBS and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 4 min at room temperature. After 1–3 washes with PBS containing 0.2% normal donkey serum and 0.2% Tween-20 (PBS-DT), the nonspecific binding sites were blocked with PBS-2.5% donkey serum for 20 min, and the cells were incubated simultaneously with ε-COP (20Hara-Kuge S. Kuge O. Orci L. Amherdt M. Ravazzola M. Wieland F.T. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and either anti-syntaxin 6 or anti-mannosidase II antibodies diluted in PBS-DT for 20–60 min at room temperature. The cells were washed three times with PBS-DT and incubated simultaneously with fluorescein isothiocyanate- and/or Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in PBS-DT for 30–45 min at room temperature. The cells were washed three times with PBS-DT, rinsed with water, mounted in 50% PBS/50% glycerol/10 mg/ml n-propyl gallate, and examined by confocal (Bio-Rad) microscopy. Calcium plays an important role in regulating vesicle fusion reactions within the cell. Although it has been suggested that calcium or calcium gradients may regulate vesicle formation or targeting (25Sambrook J.F. Cell. 1990; 61: 197-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), this possibility has remained largely unexplored. We have studied whether calcium regulates vesicular transport at the Golgi apparatus by examining the effects of calcium chelators on COPI vesicle assembly in whole cells and in vitro. We initially investigated whether intracellular calcium levels regulate Golgi structure and function by assessing the distribution of coatomer and the structure of the Golgi in cultured cells after treatment with agents that alter calcium homeostasis. In this regard, NRK or CHO cells were treated with BAPTA-AM, a membrane-permeable analog of the fast-acting calcium chelator BAPTA. Incubating NRK cells with BAPTA-AM caused a complete redistribution of the coatomer in comparison with untreated cells (Fig.1, compare E andB). Despite the redistribution of coatomer, the juxtanuclear α-mannosidase II-positive Golgi structures remained largely unaffected (Fig. 1, A and D). Merged images show a good overlap of coatomer and α-mannosidase II labeling in untreated cells (Fig. 1 C) that was lost after treatment with the chelator (Fig. 1 F). Similar results were obtained using CHO cells by comparing the localization of coatomer and the late Golgi marker syntaxin 6 (data not shown). Analysis of the distribution of coatomer at various times following the addition of 50 μmBAPTA-AM showed a gradual redistribution of coatomer, with a progressive diminution in the extent of Golgi localization occurring over 30–90 min (data not shown). The redistribution of coatomer observed upon incubation with BAPTA-AM is reminiscent of the redistribution of coatomer that occurs upon treating cells with brefeldin A (26Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Brefeldin A also causes resident cis/medial-Golgi enzymes, such as α-mannosidase II, to relocate to the ER (27Tang B.L. Low S.H. Hong W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 68: 199-205PubMed Google Scholar). Although treatment with BAPTA-AM caused coatomer to redistribute in the cell, the results clearly showed a lack of redistribution of α-mannosidase II and syntaxin 6. This indicates that the effects of chelation of intracellular calcium are distinct and do not lead to a brefeldin A-like redistribution of resident Golgi enzymes. The redistribution of coatomer that occurs upon treating cells with BAPTA-AM could result from a relocalization of COPI vesicles or from a defect in the assembly or disassembly of the vesicles. In order to address these possibilities, we utilized the cell-free reconstitution of COPI vesicle assembly. Activation of the ARF family of small GTP-binding proteins is a critical step in the recruitment of coat proteins during vesicle assembly, and COPI vesicles are formedin vitro when isolated Golgi membranes are incubated with a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, GTPγS, and a source of coatomer and ARF1 (28Orci L. Palmer D.J. Amherdt M. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 364: 732-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 29Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T. Science. 1996; 272: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). COPI-coated vesicles can be extracted from the Golgi membrane with a high salt (250 mm KCl) wash and then isolated by sedimentation (22Fucini R.V. Navarette A. Vadakkan C. Lacomis L.

Dirac-Svejstrup B. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). We carried out vesicle-budding reactions in the presence of BAPTA and EGTA. Following the incubations, we quantitated the recovery of COPI-coated vesicles. As shown in Fig.2, the appearance of coatomer in the pellet fraction was completely dependent upon the addition of GTPγS to activate ARF (lanes 1 and 2). The addition of 5 mm BAPTA to the binding reaction completely blocked the appearance of COPI-coated vesicles in the pellet fraction (Fig. 2,lane 3). However, EGTA addition had little or no effect (Fig. 2, lane 4). The inhibition of COPI-coated vesicle assembly by BAPTA, but not EGTA, is similar to the effects of these chelators on calcium-regulated membrane fusion events and intra-Golgi membrane transport (9Pryor P.R.

Cell. 1993; 73: 1411-1422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In order to confirm that the effects of BAPTA on vesicle production and on coatomer binding were due to the chelation of calcium, we examined whether these effects could be reversed by the addition of calcium to the reactions. As shown in Fig.3 A, in the presence of calcium, BAPTA was no longer effective at inhibiting coatomer binding to the Golgi membranes (lane 4). The pH of the reactions was buffered and monitored before and after the incubations to ensure that the effects of calcium and BAPTA were not the result of pH changes (data not shown). A previous study has indicated that the effect of BAPTA on endosome fusion results from the chelation of zinc (32Aballay A. Sarrouf M.N. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Mayorga L.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 919-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether zinc was the limiting ion in our incubations with BAPTA by examining the effects of a high affinity zinc chelator, TPEN, on coatomer binding (Fig. 3 B). TPEN did not have an appreciable effect on coatomer assembly, whereas comparable concentrations of BAPTA significantly decreased coatomer binding to the Golgi membranes (Fig.3 B, compare lanes 2–5 to lanes 7–10). Magnesium was also found not to be the limiting ion in the presence of BAPTA (data not shown). The ability of calcium, but not other divalent cations, to prevent the inhibition of coat binding by BAPTA, together with the lack of inhibition by TPEN, indicates that BAPTA exerts its effects by chelating calcium. The effects of BAPTA on vesicle recovery in vitro suggested that the redistribution of coatomer observed when whole cells were treated with BAPTA-AM resulted from its effects on vesicle assembly rather than a redistribution of the vesicles themselves. The inability to recover coatomer-coated vesicles in the cell-free system, as shown in Fig. 2, could result either from an inhibition of coatomer binding to the membranes or from an increase in the rate at which coatomer dissociates from the membrane. In order to help resolve this issue, we performed binding assays in which BAPTA was added to the reactions at various times after initiation of the incubation at 37 °C. As shown in Fig.4, BAPTA reduced the levels of bound coatomer even when it was added 15 min after starting the reaction. Assessment of the kinetics of coatomer binding to the Golgi membranes showed that near maximal recruitment of coatomer to the membranes had already occurred after 5 min (Fig. 4, inset). The finding that BAPTA addition reduced coatomer levels, even after maximal recruitment of coatomer on the membranes, suggested that BAPTA was causing the preassembled coatomer to dissociate. We tested directly whether chelation of calcium affects the stability of coatomer preassembled on the membrane using two-stage binding reactions (Fig. 5 A). In the first stage, Golgi membranes were incubated with cytosol and GTPγS to load coatomer onto the membrane. The coatomer-bound membranes were reisolated and then incubated in the second stage with or without BAPTA. In the absence of BAPTA, the coatomer remained associated with the Golgi and was recovered with the membrane pellets by centrifugation after the second-stage incubation (Fig. 5 A, lanes 1 and2). In contrast, inclusion of BAPTA in the second stage caused the dissociation of a large fraction of the Golgi-bound coatomer such that upon centrifugation, it was recovered in the supernatant fraction and not in the Golgi membrane pellet (Fig. 5 A, lanes 3 and 4). This result indicated that the addition of BAPTA does not necessarily block the recruitment of coatomer to the Golgi membranes, but it leads to the uncoating of previously assembled coat from the Golgi membranes and vesicles. It is striking that the differential effects of BAPTA and EGTA are observed in both membrane fusion assays and in stabilization of coatomer on Golgi membranes. This difference in the effects of these two chelators is often attributed to the faster exchange rate of BAPTA for calcium (∼100 times) than that of EGTA, and it is interpreted to suggest that a localized calcium transient or a calcium gradient that is more sensitive to the fast binding kinetics of BAPTA is involved (18Porat A. Elazar Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29233-29237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 31Sullivan K.M. Busa W.B. Wilson K.L.

J. 1999; 76: 1693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Chelation should be a function of both the association rate and the concentration of the chelator. If the difference in calcium binding kinetics between BAPTA and EGTA is responsible for the differential inhibition of coatomer binding to the membranes in the presence of these agents, one would predict that higher EGTA concentrations would produce effects similar to those observed with BAPTA. With this in mind, we reexamined whether EGTA has an effect on coatomer association using the two-stage uncoating assay. Measuring coatomer dissociation from the Golgi allows smaller effects on coat stability to be observed, because it is much easier to detect a small change in the amount of coatomer released into the supernatant than it is to detect a similar change in the amount of total coatomer bound to the Golgi membrane. Hence, Golgi membranes were preloaded with coatomer, reisolated, and then incubated with 5 mm BAPTA or 20 mm EGTA for varying lengths of time (Fig.5 B). The amount of free coatomer in the supernatant was assessed by immunoblotting. The addition of 5 mm BAPTA led to a rapid uncoating of the membrane, with a t12 of ∼2 min. As expected from the results of single-stage Golgi binding assays (see Figs. 2 and 3 A), the BAPTA-induced uncoating was largely inhibited by the presence of calcium. The addition of 20 mm EGTA to the coatomer-loaded Golgi membranes also led to a release of a significant amount of the coatomer from the Golgi membranes, albeit at a much slower rate (t12 > 60 min) than with BAPTA. Although EGTA was much less effective at uncoating the membranes than BAPTA, its effect was also mediated by chelation of calcium because it could be reversed by the inclusion of calcium in the second-stage incubation. Chelation of zinc by TPEN did not cause coatomer release from the Golgi membranes in this more sensitive assay, confirming that zinc does not play a role in maintaining the integrity of the coat on the membranes (data not shown). If the calcium-sensitive uncoating of the assembled coat plays a role in the regulation of membrane traffic, one would expect the integrity of the coat on the coated vesicles to be sensitive to calcium chelation. To determine whether vesicles themselves were uncoating as opposed to the dissociation of a non-vesicle-associated coatomer pool from the Golgi membranes, we examined the effects of BAPTA on isolated COPI-coated vesicles. Golgi membranes were incubated with GTPγS and cytosol to cause budding, and the vesicles were stripped off the Golgi membranes with a high salt wash. The vesicle-enriched supernatant was then incubated in the p"

Previous studies have identified a 68-nucleotide destabilizing element at the junction of the coding region and 3′ untranslated region of the light NF subunit (NF-L) mRNA. The present study has used the destabilizing element (probe A) to screen a rat brain cDNA library for interactive proteins. A cDNA clone encoding 1068 nucleotides in the C-terminal domain of p190RhoGEF (clone 39) was found to bind strongly and specifically to the RNA probe. The interaction was confirmed using a glutathione S-transferase/clone 39 fusion protein in Northwestern, gel-shift, and cross-linkage studies. The glutathione S-transferase/clone 39 fusion protein also enhanced the cross-linkage of a major 43-kDa protein in brain extract to the destabilizing element. Functional studies on stably transfected neuronal cells showed that p190RhoGEF expression increased the half-life of a wild-type NF-L mRNA but did not alter the half-life of a mutant NF-L mRNA lacking the destabilizing element. The findings reveal a novel interactive feature of p190RhoGEF that links the exchange factor with NF mRNA stability and regulation of the axonal cytoskeleton.

Their relationship to the axonal cytoskeleton becomes apparent during postnatal development by parallel increases in NF expression and in NF content of enlarging axons (2Schlaepfer W.W. Bruce J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 25: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), to an extent that is determined by the nature of target cell innervation (3Voyvodic V.T. Nature. 1989; 342: 430-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). NF expression is then maintained at a level commensurate with axonal size but can be down-regulated by nerve transection (4Goldstein M.E. Weiss S.R. Lazzarini R.A. Shneidman P.S. Lees J.F. Schlaepfer W.W. Mol. Brain Res. 1988; 3: 287-292Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This responsiveness of NF expression to disruptions of axonal integrity develops pari passu with the postnatal up-regulation in NF expression (5Schwartz M.L. Shneidman P.S. Bruce J. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 27: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Hence, a major NF function resides in the level of NF expression and relates to the establishment and preservation of the axonal cytoskeleton in differentiated neurons. NF expression is regulated by transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Whereas the restriction of NF expression to neurons is determined at the level of transcription, the amounts of NF gene products expressed in different neurons are regulated post-transcriptionally (6Schwartz M.L. Bruce J. Shneidman P.S. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25364-25369Google Scholar). Although there is also evidence of translation control (7Beaudet L. Cote F. Houle D. Julien J.-P. Mol. Brain. Res. 1993; 18: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 8Antic D. Lu N. Keene J.D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), a major component of post-transcriptional regulation occurs at the level of the mRNA stability (9Schwartz M.L. Shneidman P.S. Bruce J. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 257: 24596-24600Google Scholar). The latter phenomenon is exemplified by the simultaneous increase in NF subunit expression during postnatal development (2Schlaepfer W.W. Bruce J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 25: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), mediated by stabilization of their respective transcripts (10Schwartz M.L. Shneidman P.S. Bruce J. Schlaepfer W.W. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 27: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Stabilization of NF mRNAs remains an active process in differentiated neurons as evidenced by the sudden and coordinated destabilization of NF transcripts following nerve transection (10Schwartz M.L. Shneidman P.S. Bruce J. Schlaepfer W.W. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 27: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, mRNA stability serves as a means for regulating NF expression and maintaining levels of NF expression commensurate with the size and extent of the axonal conduit. Insights into the localization of cis-acting elements regulating the stabilities of NF transcripts were obtained from patterns of transgene expression in mice bearing wild-type and mutant NF light subunit (NF-L) transgenes (6Schwartz M.L. Bruce J. Shneidman P.S. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25364-25369Google Scholar). These studies showed that the postnatal up-regulation and axotomy-induced down-regulation of NF-L mRNA are regulated by elements in the 3′ UTR of the NF-L transcript. Functional studies of mRNA stability then identified a 68-nucleotide (nt) element at the junction of the coding region and 3′ UTR whose deletion leads to a marked stabilization of the NF-L transcript (11Cañete-Soler R. Schwartz M.L. Hua Y. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12550-12554Google Scholar). The 68-nt destabilizing element (probe A) is highly interactive with proteins in brain extract and neuronal cell lines using gel-shift and cross-linking methods (12Cañete-Soler R. Schwartz M.L. Hua Y. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12555-12561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, there is still no information as to the identity of these trans-acting factors or their effects on NF-L mRNA stability. The present study has begun to identify the regulatory factors that bind to the destabilizing element and to assess their potential role in regulating NF-L mRNA stability. For this purpose, the 68-nt destabilizing element (probe A) was used as an RNA probe to screen for interactive proteins in a rat brain cDNA library (see Ref. 13Smith C.W.J. RNA:Protein Interactions. A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998: 183-193Google Scholar). To our surprise, we identified the C-terminal domain of p190RhoGEF as a binding partner to the destabilizing element. We then confirmed the interactions by biochemical methods and showed that p190RhoGEF alters the stability of NF-L mRNA in vivo. The identification of p190RhoGEF in post-transcriptional control of NF-L expression provides a starting point for probing specific interactions among RNA-protein components on the NF-L transcript and their possible connections to other regulatory pathways in the neuron. A rat brain λ ZapII cDNA library (Stratagene) was screened with an RNA probe to sequence between +1712 and +1779 of mouse NF-L mRNA (11Cañete-Soler R. Schwartz M.L. Hua Y. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12550-12554Google Scholar). This sequence was transcribed in SK+ vector by T7 polymerase to generate probe A (108cpm/ml). Approximately 2 × 106 plaques were screened with the radioactive probe (5 × 105 cpm/ml). Four plasmids with 1.2-kb inserts were isolated by in vivoexcision, and their cDNAs were sequenced in both directions using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method. The largest cDNA (clone 39) was subcloned into the EcoRI sites of pGEX-6P (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST protein and GST-clone 39 fusion protein were expressed in BL21 bacteria and purified according to standard protocols (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A full-length p190RhoGEF cDNA was provided by Dr. Wouter Moolenaar (14Gebbink M.F.B.G. Kranenburg O. Poland M. vanHorck F.P.G. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Clone 39 and p190RhoGEF cDNAs were inserted in-frame into pEGFP-C1 or pEGFP-C2 expression vectors (CLONTECH), and pEGFP-C1, pEGFP/clone 39, and pEGFP/p190RhoGEF expression vectors were transfected into Neuro2a cells. 20 µg of total rat brain RNA were hybridized with cDNA probes to a KpnI/EcoRI fragment from the 5′ end of p190RhoGEF (14Gebbink M.F.B.G. Kranenburg O. Poland M. vanHorck F.P.G. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and to aBamHI/XhoI fragment from clone 39. Radioactive probes were prepared using 32P-αdCTP (109cpm/µg) and a random prime labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Purified GST and GST-clone 39 fusion proteins (5 µg), lysates (50 µg) of Neuro2a cell transfected with pEGFP-C1, pEGFP/clone 39, or pEGFP/p190RhoGEF, and brain extract (100 µg) were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and reacted with probe A (106 cpm/ml) as described (15Cañete-Soler R. Schlaepfer W.W. Brain Res. 2000; 867: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Parallel samples of transfected Neuro2a cell lysates were also transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and immunoblotted with anti-green fluorescent protein Living Colors antibody (CLONTECH), and immunoreactivity was detected using a chemiluminescence kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Expression of EGFP, EGFP/p190RhoGEF, and EGFP/clone 39 fluorescence was observed in vivo and estimated to occur in 20–40% of cells. Brain extracts were obtained by centrifugation (100,000 × g for 1 h) of rat brain homogenates (12Cañete-Soler R. Schwartz M.L. Hua Y. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12555-12561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Gel shift and UV cross-linking were performed as described (12Cañete-Soler R. Schwartz M.L. Hua Y. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12555-12561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In brief, binding reactions (10 µl) contained 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 4–10 fmol of labeled RNA, and GST-clone 39 fusion protein, GST protein, or brain extract. Homoribopolymers (1 µg) or unlabeled RNA (10- to 50-fold excess) were added as competitors. RNA-protein complexes were digested with RNase T1, dissociated with heparin, and resolved on 5% acrylamide gels. Parallel incubations were cross-linked by UV light (4 × 106J/cm2), further digested with RNase T1, solubilized in Laemmli buffer, and electrophoresed in 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels. Radioactive bands were detected by autoradiography and quantitated by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). NF-L mRNA stability was assessed using Neuro2a cells containing the tTA transactivator cDNA and either wild-type (NF-L/++++) or mutant (L/++/del/++) NF-L cDNA under the control of a Tn-10 tetracycline-inducible promoter (11Cañete-Soler R. Schwartz M.L. Hua Y. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12550-12554Google Scholar). These cells were stably transfected with a full-length p190RhoGEF cDNA in a pcDNA3.1 vector or with the vector alone, selected with hygromycin, and pooled (>100 clones). The presence and expression of p190RhoGEF cDNA in the modified cells were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction and protection assay. Cells were grown in the absence of tetracycline, split into replicate plates, and harvested in triplicate for assessment of NF-L mRNA at varying time points after readdition of tetracycline. Levels of mRNA from wild-type and mutant NF-L transgenes were normalized to levels of β-actin mRNA. mRNAs were assessed by ribonuclease protection assay (11Cañete-Soler R. Schwartz M.L. Hua Y. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12550-12554Google Scholar). Protection assay were quantitated by PhosphorImager, and data were averaged from three experiments. To identify RNA-binding proteins that participate in regulating the stability of NF-L mRNA, a rat brain cDNA library was probed with the 68-nt sequence to the stability determinant of NF-L mRNA (probe A). Four clones encoding the same cDNA insert were identified. The largest (clone 39) encoded a 1068-nt open reading frame that is 92% identical to the C terminus of mouse p190RhoGEF (14Gebbink M.F.B.G. Kranenburg O. Poland M. vanHorck F.P.G. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) (Fig.1, A and B). Although the sequence does not contain known RNA binding motifs, there are several regions enriched in arginine residues with predicted α-helical structures that may have RNA binding activity (16Weiss M.A. Narayana N. Biopolymers. 1998; 48: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 17Cusack S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 66-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 18Patel D.J. Curr. Opin.

Biol. 2000; 20: 8198-8208Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To determine whether clone 39 might be a truncated isoform of p190RhoGEF, Northern blots of rat brain mRNA were probed with cDNA probes to the 5′ and 3′ ends of p190RhoGEF. Both probes hybridized to 5.5- and 7.0-kb mRNAs (Fig. 1 C), similar to the sizes of p190RhoGEF transcripts described previously in mouse brain (14Gebbink M.F.B.G. Kranenburg O. Poland M. vanHorck F.P.G. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To confirm the RNA binding properties of the C-terminal domain of p190RhoGEF, purified extracts of bacteria expressing a GST-clone 39 fusion protein were reacted with probe A by Northwestern blot (Fig.1 D). Binding to a 68-kDa protein occurred in extracts containing the fusion protein but not in extracts containing the GST vector alone or in extracts from uninduced bacteria. The 68-kDa protein is the expected size of a GST-clone 39 fusion protein. p190RhoGEF C-terminal domain (clone 39) enhances the binding of 43-kDa protein in brain extracts to the NF-L mRNA stability determinant. The RNA binding properties of the GST-clone 39 fusion protein were further tested by gel retardation assay and by cross-linkage of RNA-protein complexes (Fig. 2). Additions of fusion protein (5–50 nm) led to a dose-dependent formation of a retarded radioactive band when binding reactions were electrophoresed on non-denaturing gels (Fig. 2 A). The formation of the retarded band did not occur using a nonspecific RNA probe or upon addition of 500 nm of unfused GST protein. Radioactivity from probe A was cross-linked to a 68-kDa GST-clone 39 fusion protein (Fig. 2 B). Cross-linkage was competed with unlabeled probe A but not by a nonspecific RNA probe. Cross-linkage of probe A to the 68-kDa GST-clone 39 fusion protein was then compared with cross-linkage of probe A to a 43-kDa protein in brain extracts (Fig. 2 C). The 43-kDa protein is the major RNA-binding protein in the poly(C)-sensitive complexes that bind to and regulate the stabilities of the NF-L (12Cañete-Soler R. Schwartz M.L. Hua Y. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12555-12561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and NF-H (15Cañete-Soler R. Schlaepfer W.W. Brain Res. 2000; 867: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) mRNAs. Cross-linkage to the 43-kDa protein was competed with poly(C) but not by poly(U), whereas cross-linkage to the 68-kDa GST-clone 39 fusion protein was competed by both homoribopolymers. Whereas cross-linkage to the 68-kDa protein decreased when the GST-clone 39 fusion protein was supplemented with brain extract, cross-linkage to the 43-kDa protein was markedly increased in the presence of GST-clone 39 fusion protein. Addition of fusion protein caused at least a 10-fold increase in binding of 43-kDa protein at low concentrations of brain extract (Fig.2 D). The lack of cross-linkage of probe A to endogenous p190RhoGEF in brain extract could be because of the large size of the native protein or because of the relatively small amounts of the protein in high speed supernatants of brain extract. Binding of probe A to clone 39 and full-length p190RhoGEF was therefore tested using lysates of Neuro2a cells expressing clone 39 or p190RhoGEF as EGFP fusion proteins. Parallel samples of lysates were separated by SDS electrophoresis, transferred to membranes, and either immunoblotted with an EGFP antibody (Fig. 2 E) or reacted with probe A (Fig.2 F). Both clone 39 and full-length p190RhoGEF fusion proteins, but not the unfused EGFP protein, bound to the radioactive probe. Together, the findings demonstrate binding of the C-terminal domain, as well as the full-length p190RhoGEF, to RNA sequence in the mRNA stability determinant of NF-L. Moreover, binding to the C-terminal domain alters the binding of a 43-kDa RNA-binding protein in brain extracts to the same sequence. Because the latter protein is implicated in regulating NF mRNA stability (11Cañete-Soler R. Schwartz M.L. Hua Y. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12550-12554Google Scholar, 12Cañete-Soler R. Schwartz M.L. Hua Y. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12555-12561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 15Cañete-Soler R. Schlaepfer W.W. Brain Res. 2000; 867: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), the C-terminal domain of p190RhoGEF may effect or be affected by alterations in NF mRNA stability. Expression of p190RhoGEF alters the stability of a wild-type NF-L mRNA but not the stability of a mutant NF-L mRNA lacking the destabilizing element. A functional role of p190RhoGEF in altering NF-L mRNA stability was tested by examining the effects of p190RhoGEF expression on levels of wild-type NF-L mRNA or levels of mutant NF-L mRNA lacking the destabilizing element in transcript (11Cañete-Soler R. Schwartz M.L. Hua Y. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12550-12554Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant NF-L cDNAs were placed as transgenes in a tetracycline-inducible system so that high levels of transgenic mRNAs could be induced, and rates of mRNA decay could be assessed following addition of the tetracycline ligand to turn off further transcription of the transgenes. p190RhoGEF expression was brought about by stably transfecting a pcDNA expression vector containing the full-length p190RhoGEF cDNA. High levels of wild-type NF-L mRNA (NF-L in Fig.3A) or an NF-L mRNA lacking a destabilizing element (NF-L (del) in Fig.3 B) were obtained by withdrawal of tetracycline from the medium. Rates of mRNA decay were determined by assessing NF mRNA levels at 0 (lanes 1 and 5), 24 (lanes 2 and 6), 48 (lanes 3 and7), and 72 (lanes 4 and 8) h after the readdition of tetracycline to inhibit transcription. The effects of p190RhoGEF expression were determined by comparing rates of mRNA decay in cells expressing p190RhoGEF (lanes 5–8) or an empty pcDNA expression vector (lanes 1–4). A representative experiment is shown in Fig. 3, A andB, and quantitation of four separate experiments is presented in Fig. 3, C and D. p190RhoGEF expression stabilized the wild-type NF-L transcript (Fig.3 C) but not the mutant NF-L mRNA lacking a destabilizing element (Fig. 3 D). Hence, deletion of the destabilizing element increases mRNA stability but renders the transcript insensitive to the effects of p190RhoGEF expression. A nearly 2-fold increase of NF-L mRNA stability was achieved either by deleting the destabilizing element or by expression of p190RhoGEF. Similar results were observed in an initial series of studies using transient transfections of target NF-L constructs and EGFP marker protein fused to the C-terminal domain of p190RhoGEF (clone 39) or to the full-length p190RhoGEF protein (data not shown). Variability in the extent of transient transfections and their expressions over time precluded an accurate assessment of change. This study has identified and characterized interactive properties of p190RhoGEF that implicate the exchange factor in post-transcriptional regulation of neuronal gene products. The C-terminal domain of the exchange factor binds to an RNA sequence in the 3′ UTR of NF-L transcript and links a component of the Rho kinase pathway with the RNA-protein complex regulating NF-L mRNA stability. Binding of the C-terminal domain of p190RhoGEF (clone 39) to the NF-L stability determinant (probe A), initially detected in a cDNA library screen, was confirmed by Northwestern blot, gel-shift, and cross-linkage studies. The latter findings solidify the RNA binding features of the exchange factor, because Northwestern, gel-shift, and cross-linkage studies measure different, albeit complementary, aspects of RNA-protein interactions. Neither the interactions among components of RNA-protein complexes nor their roles in regulating NF-L mRNA stability are presently understood. It is, therefore, unclear to what extent the p190RhoGEF-dependent alterations in NF-L mRNA stability may relate to the ability of the C-terminal domain of p190RhoGEF to enhance the binding of a 43-kDa protein in brain extracts to the NF-L mRNA stability determinant. The 43-kDa protein is the principal cross-linked component of RNA-protein complexes that assemble on destabilizing elements in the 3′ UTRs of the NF-L and NF-H mRNAs (15Cañete-Soler R. Schlaepfer W.W. Brain Res. 2000; 867: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It is possible that allosteric alterations from protein-protein or protein-RNA interactions could facilitate binding of the 43-kDa protein to the destabilizing element. On the other hand, the role of the 43-kDa protein in regulating RNA stability is completely unknown. Recent studies have just begun to unravel the complex mechanisms whereby RNA-protein complexes increase or decrease the stabilities of specific mRNAs (21Ford L.P. Watson J. Keene J.D. Wilusz J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 188-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 22Gao M. Wilusz C.J. Peltz S.W. Wilusz J. EMBO J. 2001; 5: 1134-1143Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 23Wilusz J. Wormington M. Peltz S.W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). The introduction of a tetracycline-inducible system to test RNA stability enables transcription of specific target genes to be manipulated and avoids the pleiotropic effects from using transcription inhibitors (11Cañete-Soler R. Schwartz M.L. Hua Y. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12550-12554Google Scholar). This system was used to identify the 68-nt destabilizing element at the junction of the coding region and 3′ UTR of NF-L (11Cañete-Soler R. Schwartz M.L. Hua Y. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12550-12554Google Scholar). The system was herein applied to examine the effects of p190RhoGEF expression on the stability of the NF-L transcript. The results showed that expression of p190RhoGEF alters the stability of the NF-L transcript and that alteration of NF-L mRNA stability was dependent on the presence of the destabilizing element in target transcript. The findings also demonstrate that the interactive properties of p190RhoGEF could be conveyed in the context of a full-length p190RhoGEF protein. The ability to bind and alter the stability of NF-L mRNA represents a novel and unexpected feature of p190RhoGEF. p190RhoGEF was initially identified in a two-hybrid screen as a brain-enriched, Rho-specific GDP/GTP exchange factor with the ability to mimic Rho-like cytoskeletal changes when transfected in a neuronal cell line (14Gebbink M.F.B.G. Kranenburg O. Poland M. vanHorck F.P.G. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We confirmed the presence of 4.0- and 7.2-kb p190RhoGEF mRNAs species in rat brain, as initially reported in mouse brain (14Gebbink M.F.B.G. Kranenburg O. Poland M. vanHorck F.P.G. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We also showed that each mRNA hybridized to cDNA probes to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the p190RhoGEF coding region, indicating the N- and C termini of p190RhoGEF are not excluded from either isoform. Although the nature and derivation of the different p190RhoGEF isoforms remain unclear, it is unlikely that the RNA binding properties of the C-terminal domain have evolved in a separate isoform. Furthermore, the functional effects of p190RhoGEF as an exchange factor and of altering NF-L mRNA stability were demonstrated using the same p190RhoGEF cDNA (14Gebbink M.F.B.G. Kranenburg O. Poland M. vanHorck F.P.G. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). More recently, p190RhoGEF has been shown to require an unknown binding partner to unmask its GDP/GTP exchange activity in vivo(24Van Horck F.P.G. Ahmadian M.R. Haeusler L.C. Moolenaar W.H. Kranenburg O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4948-4956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Binding of p190RhoGEF to the NF-L mRNA stability may be a component of this activation. It is noteworthy that the prospective roles of p190RhoGEF in activation of Rho GTPase and in post-transcriptional modulation of NF-L expression would involve the functioning of p190RhoGEF during differing time frames of neuronal development. Although Rho GTPases are highly instrumental in mediating cytoskeletal changes during early neuronal differentiation (25Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar), their role in differentiated neurons is less clear. On the other hand, post-transcriptional regulation of NF-L expression becomes operational during late neuronal development and remains active in the fully differentiated state. Hence, the preferential expression in differentiated neurons (26Meyer D. Liu A. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 49: 35113-35118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and especially the prominent expression of p190RhoGEF mRNA in fully mature murine brain (14Gebbink M.F.B.G. Kranenburg O. Poland M. vanHorck F.P.G. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), is consistent with a role of p190RhoGEF in the post-transcriptional regulation of NF-L expression. Moreover, in situ hybridization reveals high levels of p190RhoGEF mRNA in large motor neurons commensurate with the high levels of NF metabolism in these cells. 2R. Cañete-Soler, unpublished data. Interactions of p190RhoGEF with the destabilizing element in the NF-L mRNA could serve to modulate mRNA stability or, alternatively, could reflect changes in stabilities of the transcripts. In either case, the potential role of p190RhoGEF in neuronal homeostasis is intriguing in view of the strategic role that stabilization of NF transcripts serves in maintaining corresponding levels of NF expression and axonal size of individual neurons. Indeed, a possible involvement of p190RhoGEF in regulating the homeostasis of motor neurons derives from the unexpected neuropathic effects brought about by mutating the destabilizing element in an NF-L transgene (27Cañete-Soler R. Silberg D.G. Gershon M.D. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1273-1283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The latter finding implicates the interactions of trans-acting factors with the destabilizing element in mediating the neuropathic effects of the transgene. The identification of p190RhoGEF as a possible modulator of motor neuron homeostasis warrants further study. We thank Dr. Wouter Moolenaar for providing the full-length p190RhoGEF cDNA."

To better understand these regulatory processes, we studied HOXA7expression and its regulation of differentiation-specific keratinocyte genes. We isolated the homeobox transcription factor HOXA7 from keratinocytes through binding to a differentiation-dependent viral enhancer and analyzed its effect on endogenous differentiation-dependent genes, primarily transglutaminase 1. HOXA7 overexpression repressed transglutaminase 1-reporter activity. HOXA7 message markedly decreased, and transglutaminase RNA increased, upon phorbol ester-induced differentiation, in a protein kinase C-dependent manner. Overexpression of HOXA7 attenuated thetransglutaminase 1 induction by phorbol ester, demonstrating that HOXA7 expression is inversely related to keratinocyte differentiation, and to transglutaminase 1expression. Antisense HOXA7 expression activated transglutaminase 1, involucrin, and keratin 10 message and protein levels, demonstrating that endogenous HOXA7 down-regulates multiple differentiation-specific keratinocyte genes. In keeping with these observations, epidermal growth factor receptor activation stimulated HOXA7expression. HOX genes function in groups, and we found thatHOXA5 and HOXB7 were also down-regulated by phorbol ester. These results provide the first example of protein kinase C-mediated homeobox gene regulation in keratinocytes, and new evidence that HOXA7, potentially in conjunction with HOXA5 and HOXAB7, silences differentiation-specific genes during keratinocyte proliferation, that are then released from inhibition in response to differentiation signals.

Merville M.-P. Bours V. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4007-4014Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Another mechanism underlying specificity of function is the combined action of unique sets of Hox genes. In development,Hox genes act in groups comprising paralogous genes (corresponding genes from different clusters), as well as nearby genes within clusters, to bring about target regulation. This mechanism may also underlie the expression of predominantly HOXA4, HOXA5, HOXA7, but also HOXB6 and HOXB7, in a similar differential manner in human skin (32Stelnicki E.J. Komuves L.G. Kwong A.O. Holmes D. Klein P. Rozenfeld S. Lawrence H.J. Adzick N.S. Harrison M. Largman C. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1998; 110: 110-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In this study we isolated and sequenced the HOXA7cDNA from keratinocytes through binding to a differentiation-dependent HPV-16 E6/E7 enhancer fragment. HOXA7 also bound to a regulatory fragment of the differentiation-specific transglutaminase 1 gene and repressed transglutaminase 1-reporter activity. HOXA7, HOXA5, and HOXB7 were down-regulated in keratinocytes induced to differentiate with TPA, and overexpressed HOXA7 inhibited transglutaminase 1 expression during TPA-induced differentiation. Antisense HOXA7 expression up-regulated keratinocyte differentiation markers and slowed growth, and HOXA7 message was up-regulated in growth-activated keratinocytes. These results indicate that HOXA7, potentially in conjunction with related family members, functions in silencing differentiation-specific genes, prior to its own PKC-mediated down-regulation during differentiation. A transient increase in HOXA7 expression observed as cultured cells reach confluence may act as a brake initially to limit the rate at which differentiation progresses, as cells become exposed to differentiation signals. An epidermal cDNA expression library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), prepared in λgt11 from human keratinocyte messenger RNA, was screened for expressed proteins that recognize a 232-bp HPV-16E6/E7 enhancer DraI fragment (bp 7524–7756) by a standard method (38Kalionis B. O'Farrell P.H. Mech. Dev. 1993; 43: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, phage plaques on cultures of infectedEscherichia coli were overlaid with nitrocellulose filters pretreated with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and dried. Expressed, adsorbed proteins were denatured with 6 mguanidine HCl in Tris-buffered saline and renatured with washes in six decrements to zero denaturing agent. Filters were blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk and 100 µg/ml salmon sperm DNA in Tris-buffered saline with 0.5% Triton X-100, and expressed proteins were probed with a 32P-labeled 232-bp DraI fragment (bp 7524–7756), containing the CK element, a small cytokeratin homology motif, from the HPV-16 E6/E7 enhancer, or a neighboring 209-bp DraI control fragment (bp 7286–7495). Bound probe was visualized by autoradiography. Positive plaques underwent two further cycles of E. coli infection, plating, induction of protein expression, and probing. Clone 124, containing the full-lengthHOXA7 cDNA, was subcloned into pCDNAI and sequenced. Neonatal human keratinocytes (NHK) were obtained from human foreskin by overnight dispase digestion, followed by trypsinization of the separated epidermis, and plating in keratinocyte serum-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), containing recombinant human EGF and bovine pituitary extract. ME180 epidermoid carcinoma cells were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC) and grown in RPMI 1640 (Biowhitaker, Walkersville, MD) with 8% fetal calf serum (Sigma). HaCaT spontaneously immortalized keratinocytes were a generous gift from Dr. N. E. Fusenig and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 8% fetal calf serum. The full-length HOXA7 cDNA (forward primer 5′-GTCGCCATGGGTTCTTCGTATTATGTG-3′, generating a Kozak translation start sequence, and vector reverse primer) and a 5′ fragment from the translation start to just 5′ of the hexapeptide domain (Fig. 1) (5′-ATACTCGAGTAGATGCGGAAATTGG-3′ reverse primer) were PCR amplified by pwo polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), subcloned into the vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), then moved to the eukaryotic expression vectors pCS2 (pCS2-HOXA7), pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) (p3-HOXA7, p3-HOXA7frag), and pEF3 (pEF3–124fragRev) in the forward and reverse orientation and sequenced. The expression vector pEF3 was constructed by subcloning the EF-1α promoter, released from the vector pEF6/HisA (Invitrogen) by partial digestion with HindIII/BglII, into the pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) backbone in place of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The 1.7-kilobase pair transglutaminase 1upstream regulatory region K3, isolated previously (39Polakowska R.R. Eikbush T. Falciano V. Razvi F. Goldsmith L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochem. 1999; 73: 355-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), was subcloned into the enhancerless and promoterless reporter vectors pCAT-Basic (pCAT-K3), and pGL3-B (pGL3-K3) (Promega), for transient transfection. The control reporter pHβA-LacZ was constructed by inserting the lacZ cDNA from pCH110 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) into the human β-actin promoter-driven expression vector pHβAPr-1 (41Gunning P. Leavitt J. Muscat G. Ng S.-Y. Kedes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 84: 4831-4835Crossref Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Third passage NHK, and ME180, were transfected with Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and HaCaT keratinocytes were transfected with Exgen 500 (Fermentas, Hanover, MD) under the recommended conditions. Cells were transiently cotransfected with expression and reporter vectors (either HOXA7 or K3-containing, respectively, or empty vector) and with the pHβA-LacZcontrol vector. Lysates obtained 2 days after transfection were assayed for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity using [14C]chloramphenicol and acetyl-CoA by thin layer chromatography and autoradiography, and by xylene extraction and scintillation counting, presented as counts/min acetyl-[14C]chloramphenicol per milligram of lysate protein. Determinations of luciferase activity (Promega luciferase substrate), β-galactosidase activity (Tropix, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and total protein concentration (BCA, Pierce) were made according to the reagent supplier's instructions. Results are expressed as relative light units per milligram of protein. Cotransfection of expression vectors with empty reporters resulted in low background level reporter signals in all cases (data not shown). Transfection efficiency was determined as the relative number of β-galactosidase-stained cells. Cells were fixed for 5 min with an ice-cold equivolume mixture of acetone and methanol, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and stained for 16 h at 37 °C with 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside in 40 mm citrate phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, with 5 mm ferro- and ferricyanide, 2 mmMgCl2, and 150 mm NaCl. Stably transfected HaCaT were selected starting 48 h after transfection with 500 µg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and maintained in 300 µg/ml Geneticin. For analysis of growth rate, 1.5 × 105 antisense HOXA7, or vector control-transfected HaCaT, were plated in 35-mm dishes. Triplicate samples of unattached cells, and attached cells released by trypsinization, were counted at 24-h intervals. Data are reported as cells per well × 10−4 ± S.D. Statistical differences were determined by analysis of variance and ttest. To verify binding to the HPV-16 E6/E7 enhancer, HOXA7 was expressed inλgt11-transformed 1090 E. coli by induction with 2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h, followed by sonication in the presence of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and centrifugation. For electrophoretic mobility shift assay, 232-bp (bp 7524–7756) and 209-bp (bp 7286–7495) DraI fragments of HPV-16 were released by restriction digestion, purified, and 32P-labeled. Binding reactions containing 4 × 105 cpm probe (about 1 ng of DNA) and 5 µg of HOXA7 bacterial phage expression lysate or nontransformed bacterial lysate and 2 µg of poly(dI-dC) in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm potassium chloride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 6% glycerol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were incubated at room temperature for 20 min, separated on 5% polyacrylamide gels with 0.5× Tris/borate/EDTA at 4 °C for 4 h, dried, and autoradiographed. To investigate HOXA7 binding to the TGM1 upstream regulatory region (K3), recombinant HOXA7 was expressed by in vitrotranscription/translation using the ATNT-coupled Reticulocyte System® from Promega according to the included protocol, using 1 µg of template DNA per reaction. In control synthesis reactions, [35S]methionine was added, and expression was monitored by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For electrophoretic mobility shift assay, a 264-bp K3 fragment (5′ end at −710), containing a CK element similar to that found in the 232-bp DraI HPV-16 fragment, and a 212-bp neighboring K3 fragment (5′ end at −444), were prepared by PCR (bp −709 to +90), digested with BamHI andHpaII, purified, 32P-end-labeled, and shifted with 5 µg of the HOXA7 in vitro translation lysate as described above. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) from third passage neonatal human keratinocytes treated with 50 ng/ml TPA (Calbiochem).32P-UTP-labeled RNA probes were synthesized using T7 polymerase (Ambion, Austin, TX) from the linearized plasmid DNA template pCDNA3-HOXA7fragRev, containing a nonhomologous 5′ fragment of the HOXA7 cDNA (Fig. 1), and pBSII-GAPDH (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), containing a 360-bp humanglyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA fragment, both in the reverse orientation. Following DNase I digestion for 15 min at 37 °C, the probes were electrophoretically purified in a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 1× TBS and 8 m urea (Sequagel, National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA), eluted (60 min, 37 °C in 0.5 m ammonium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 50 µg/ml yeast RNA (Ambion)), precipitated (1 m ammonium acetate and 3 volumes of 2-propanol), dissolved in H2O, and scintillation counted. For RNase protection, labeled probe was ethanol/ammonium acetate-precipitated together with 12 µg of normal human keratinocyte or yeast RNA, redissolved in hybridization buffer (Ambion), denatured (90 °C, 4 min), and hybridized overnight at 42 °C. Single-stranded RNA was digested using 1 part in 100 RNase A1/RNase T1 in digestion buffer (Ambion) for 30 min at 37 °C. Protected RNA was separated by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described for probe purification and visualized by autoradiography. For detection of antisense HOXA7 RNA in stably transfected HaCaT, total RNA was hybridized as above, without the addition of probe, digested with RNase A/T for various times, and phenol-chloroform-extracted and precipitated, before detection of 5′ HOXA7 RNA by RT-PCR. The PCR product, spanning bases 291–451 (Fig. 1), was produced using the HOXA7 forward primer described below under “RT-PCR” and the reverse primer 5′-CTCGTCCGTCTTGTCGCAGG-3′. To determine the range of target DNA concentrations giving rise to a linear relationship between target concentration and product concentration, restriction fragments of HOXA7,TGM1, and β-actin cDNA were purified, and 100–100,000 molecules were PCR amplified usingTaq DNA polymerase (Promega) and PCR buffer (Sigma), in the presence of 1.8 mm MgCl2, 400 nmprimers, 400 µm each dNTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 5 µCi of [32P]dCTP. Samples were removed after 30 cycles of 94 °C, 20 s; 57 °C, 20 s; 72 °C, 30 s, electrophoresed in 6% acrylamide, 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA-buffered gels, and autoradiographed. Quantification of product bands, using Scion Image (www.scioncorp.com), indicated a linear relationship between the amount of target cDNA and the amount of PCR product formed across the range of target concentrations tested. Total RNA (0.75 µg) from control, or 50 ng/ml TPA-treated NHK, denatured at 68 °C for 10 min in the presence of 2 µmoligo(dT) primer (Invitrogen) and 1.25 mm each dNTP served as the template for cDNA synthesis by Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in the supplied buffer, supplemented with 0.5 unit/µl RNase inhibitor (Promega) and 10 mm dithiothreitol, at 42 °C for 60 min. The reaction was stopped with EDTA and heating for 15 min at 70 °C. cDNA diluted 1:10 with H2O and added at 0.10 volume to a 30-cycle PCR reaction under the above conditions gave rise to a signal intensity corresponding to a target concentration for HOXA7 and TGM1 within the linear range of the PCR assay. PCR using β-actin primers generated a signal equivalent to standards in the linear range of PCR after 18 cycles. HOXA5 and HOXB7 were also amplified for 30 PCR cycles, and involucrin, K5, and K10 were amplified for 25 cycles. Sham reactions in which no reverse transcriptase was added produced no PCR bands. The HOXA7 and transglutaminase 1 PCR primer sequences span intron splice sites to distinguish products arising from amplification of cDNA. Treatment of RNA samples with 2 units of DNase I (Ambion) followed by heat inactivation before cDNA synthesis had no affect on the PCR products formed. Primers of the following sequence (5′ to 3′) were used: HOXA7 forward (CTTATACAATGTCAACAGCC) and reverse (TCCTTATGCTCTTTCTTCC and TCTTCTTCATCATCGTCCTCCTCG), TGM1 forward (TCTGTGGGTCCTGTCCCATCCATCCTGACC) and reverse (CCCCAACGGCCCACATCGGAACGTGGCCCATCCATCATGC), human β-actin forward (CAGGCTGTGCTATCCCTGTAC) and reverse (CACGCACGATTTCCCGCTCGG), human cytokeratin K10 forward (GGCTCTGGAAGAATCAAACTATGAGC) and reverse (GGATGTTGGCATTATCAGTTGTTAGG), involucrin forward (TGTTCCTCCTCCAGTCAATACCC) and reverse (ATTCCTCATGCTGTTCCCAGTGC), keratin K5 forward (CTGTCTCCCGCACCAGCTTCACCTCC) and reverse (CTCCACAAGCACCCGCAAGGCTGACC), HOXA4 forward (GGCGCTGACATGGATCTTCTTCATCC) and reverse (CAACTACATCGAGCCCAAGTTCCCTCC), HOXA5 forward (CCTCTCTGCTGCTGATGTGGGTGC) and reverse (ACGGCTACGGCTACAATGGCATGG), HOXB7 forward (AAGTTCGGTTTTCGCTACCGGAGCC and CGCGCAGTGCATGTTGAAGG). HaCaT keratinocytes stably transfected with pCDNA3 (control) or pCDNA3-HOXA7fragRev (HOXA7 antisense), carrying a 5′ HOXA7 cDNA fragment (Fig. 1) insert in the reverse orientation, grown to 75% confluence in 100-mm dishes, were washed in 10 ml and then scraped up in 0.3 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 mm EDTA, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), microfuged 30 s at 4 °C, forming the cell supernatant, and resuspended in the same buffer with 20 mm EDTA. Cells were lysed by sonication, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C, forming the cytosolic supernatant and transglutaminase 1-containing particulate pellet (42Thacher S.M. Rice R.H. Cell. 1985; 40: 677-683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). TGase I activity was extracted from the disrupted pellet for 30 min on ice in the lysis buffer supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C, with the supernatant designated the particulate fraction. The cell supernatant and cytosolic fractions were made 1% in Triton X-100 corresponding to the detergent level in the particulate fraction. Transglutaminase activity of cellular fractions relative to total protein content was determined essentially as described previously (42Thacher S.M. Rice R.H.

This family of nuclear receptors consists of three members encoded by distinct genes, leading to the expression of PPAR-α, PPAR-δ, PPAR-γ1, and PPAR-γ2, with the latter two isoforms resulting from the presence of alternative promoters in the 5′-flanking region of the gene (3Glass C.K.

Diabetes. 1998; 47: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar, 7Marx N. Sukhova G. Murphy C. Libby P. Plutzky J. Am. J.

Both PPAR-α and PPAR-γ have been identified as important regulators of the immune response. In macrophages, activated PPAR-γ acts as a transrepressor inhibiting the expression of genes requiring the binding of NF-κB, activator protein-1, and signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 to their promoter regions (15Ricote M. Huang J.T. Welch J.S. Glass C.K. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 66: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 16Li M. Pascual G. Glass C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4699-4707Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) . In addition to this, a role for PPAR-α in inflammation was deduced from animals lacking this receptor because they exhibited prolonged responses to pro-inflammatory cytokines (1Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vazquez M. Gonzalez F.J. Wahli W. Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). Moreover, activation of PPAR-α and PPAR-γ has been shown to induce apoptosis in human macrophages and monocytes, suggesting a role for these PPARs in the resolution of inflammation (17Chinetti G. Griglio S. Antonucci M. Torra I.P. Delerive P. Majd Z. Fruchart J.C. Chapman J. Najib J. Staels B. J. Biol.

Most of the natural ligands of PPARs are derived from arachidonic acid metabolism through the action of cyclooxygenase or lipooxygenase and influence several inflammatory signaling pathways independently of PPAR ligation. In particular, cyclopentenone PGs have been reported to be lipids with the ability to react with key cysteine residues in proteins via the formation of Michael adducts (18Chen Y. Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10863-10868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), which might result in the modification of their biological activity (19Rossi A.

Indeed, most of the effects observed with potential physiological PPAR agonists (i.e. PGs) cannot be obtained with pharmacological synthetic ligands, such as the TZDs. In view of the preceding results, we decided to investigate whether synthetic ligands of PPARs with a chemical structure distinct from that of TZDs might exert actions independently of the recruitment of these transcription factors. The macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 is a likely candidate to carry out these studies because these cells express very low levels of PPAR-γ, and the action of cyclopentenone PGs has been well established in these cells (19Rossi A.

Compound G exhibits a high affinity for PPAR-γ and PPAR-δ (apparent Kd = 2 and 20 nm, respectively), and rosiglitazone has a high affinity for PPAR-γ (Kd ≅ 100 nm), whereas compound P is a poor agonist of both receptors (apparent Kd = 10 and 1 μm, respectively) (23Berger J.

Our data show that compound G, but not rosiglitazone, inhibits the early steps of LPS signaling leading to NF-κB activation well above the Kd for PPAR binding and enhances the synthesis of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates promoting apoptotic cell death. Reagents were from Sigma, Roche, and Merck. The PPAR ligands compound G (L-796,449) and compound P (L-165,041) were from Merck Research Laboratories (Rahway, NJ; Fig. 1 A). Antibodies and GST fusion proteins were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). PGs were from Calbiochem. Anti-(P)S32IκBα Ab was from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). LPS was from Salmonella typhimurium (Sigma). Serum and media were from Biowhittaker (Walkersville, MD). RAW 264.7 cells were seeded at 6–8 × 104 cells/cm2 in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 mm glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, and 50 μg/ml penicillin, streptomycin, and gentamicin. After 2 days in culture, the medium was replaced by phenol-red free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 0.5 mm arginine and 1% fetal calf serum, followed by the addition of the indicated stimuli. PGs, compound G and P ligands, and rosiglitazone were added 5 min before activation with LPS and IFN-γ (21Castrillo A. Diaz-Guerra M.J. Hortelano S. Martin-Sanz P. Bosca L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1692-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The following plasmids were used: a 1-kilobase fragment corresponding to the 5′-flanking region of the NOS-2 gene and containing two κB motifs was fused to a CAT reporter (pNOS-2(+,+).CAT vector). The pNOS-2(−,−).CAT vector contained mutated κB sequences corresponding to nucleotides −971 to −961 and −85 to −75. The (κB)3ConA.CAT plasmid, which contains three copies of the κB motif from the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat enhancer linked to the minimal conalbumin A promoter, was used to measure κB activity (21Castrillo A.

The ConA.CAT vector lacking the κB tandem was used as a control and was not modulated by the ligands tested. The kSV2.CAT plasmid was used as a reference for the efficiency of transfection. Plasmids were purified using EndoFree Qiagen columns (Hilden, Germany). Subconfluent cell cultures were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and maintained with 1.5 ml of RPMI 1640 medium and 1% fetal calf serum in 6-cm-diameter dishes. Cells were transfected for 6 h with FuGENE following the instructions of the supplier (Roche) and incubated overnight with 2 ml of RPMI 1640 medium plus 1% fetal calf serum before stimulation. Equal amounts of DNA were used for the transfection experiments. CAT activity was determined after 18 h of stimulation with the indicated factors, following a previous protocol based on TLC separation of acetylated [14C]chloramphenicol. The amount of acetylated substrate was quantified in a FUJI BAS1000 radioactivity detection system. GST-IκBα-(1–54) wild type and the corresponding protein mutated in Ser32/36 to Ala32/36 were expressed in DH5αF′ Escherichia coli and purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Alternatively, purified GST-IκBα-(1–317) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Total RNA (2–4 × 106 cells) was extracted using the guanidinium thiocyanate method, followed by electrophoresis in a 0.9% agarose gel containing 2% formaldehyde (28Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63088) Google Scholar). The RNA was transferred to a Nytran membrane (NY 13-N; Schleicher & Schuell), and the levels of NOS-2 mRNA were determined using the EcoRI-HindII fragment from the NOS-2 cDNA, which was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Rediprime labeling kit; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were exposed to x-ray films (Hyperfilm,Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the intensity of the bands was measured by laser densitometry (Molecular Dynamics). The lane charge was normalized by hybridization with a ribosomal 18 S probe. Cells (3 × 106) were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped off the dishes, and collected by centrifugation. Cell pellets were homogenized with 100 μl of buffer A (10 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml TLCK, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO4, and 10 mmNa2MoO4). After 10 min at 4 °C, Nonidet P-40 was added (0.5%, v/v), and the tubes were vortexed (15 s) and centrifuged at 8000 × g for 15 min. The supernatants were stored at −80 °C (soluble extracts), and the pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of buffer A supplemented with 20% glycerol and 0.4 m KCl and shaken for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation for 15 min at 13,000 × g, the supernatants (nuclear protein extracts) were stored at −80 °C (29Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3912) Google Scholar). Protein was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Fractionation steps were carried out at 4 °C. The oligonucleotide sequence 5′-TGCTAGGGGG ATTTTCCCTCTCTCTGT-3′ corresponding to the consensus κB site (nucleotides −978 to −952) of the murine NOS-2 promoter was annealed with the complementary DNA and end-labeled with Klenow enzyme in the presence of 50 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (30Xie Q.W. Whisnant R. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1779-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 31Xie Q.W. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA probe (5 × 104 dpm) was incubated for 15 min at 4 °C with nuclear protein extracts (3 μg) and 2 μg of polydeoxyguanylic-polydeoxy cytidylic acid, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, in a final volume of 20 μl. The DNA-protein complexes were separated on native 6% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5% Tris borate-EDTA buffer. Supershift assays were carried out after incubation for 1 h at 4 °C of the nuclear extracts with 2 μg of Ab (anti-p50, anti-c-Rel, and anti-p65), followed by EMSA (data not shown). Normalization for lane charge was accomplished using PPAR-α as probe (21Castrillo A. Diaz-Guerra M.J. Hortelano S. Martin-Sanz P. Bosca L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1692-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). When the effect of 15dPGJ2, compound G, compound P, and rosiglitazone on the binding of Rel proteins to the κB motif was assayed in vitro, nuclear extracts from LPS/IFN-γ-activated cells were treated for 5 min with these ligands before the addition of the probe. Cytosolic protein extracts were size-separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gels were blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and incubated with anti-NOS-2, anti-IκBα, anti-IκBβ, and anti-IKK2 Abs (Santa Cruz Laboratories, Santa Cruz, CA). In experiments using anti-(P)S32IκBα Ab, the blot incubation solution contained 50 ng/ml GST-IκBα-(1–317) treated previously with alkaline phosphatase-agarose (21Castrillo A. Diaz-Guerra M.J. Hortelano S. Martin-Sanz P. Bosca L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1692-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The blots were submitted to sequential reprobing with Abs after treatment with 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol and 2% SDS in Tris-buffered saline and heated at 60 °C for 30 min. The blots were revealed by ECL following the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Different exposure times of the films were used to ensure that bands were not saturated. Quantification of the films was performed by laser densitometry (Molecular Dynamics). NO release was determined spectrophotometrically by the accumulation of nitrite in the medium (phenol red-free). Nitrite was determined with Griess reagent by adding 1 mm sulfanilic acid, 100 mm HCl, and 1 mm naphthylenediamine (final concentrations). The absorbance at 548 nm was compared with a standard of NaNO2. Results were expressed as the amount of nitrite released per milligram of cell protein. RAW 264.7 cells were grown on coverslips and incubated for 45 min with the indicated stimuli. After washing the covers twice with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were fixed for 2 min with methanol at −20 °C, blocked for 20 min with 3% bovine serum albumin at room temperature, and incubated for 30 min with 1:100 anti-IκBα or anti-IκBβ Abs. After three washes with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, the level of IκB proteins was determined using a secondary Ab (1:300) against rabbit IgG conjugated with Cy3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were visualized on a MRC-1024 confocal microscope (Bio-Rad), and the fluorescence was measured and electronically evaluated. Laser sharp software (Bio-Rad) was used to determine the relative intensity of the fluorescence per pixel and the percentage of cytosolic and nuclear localization. Cells (107) were homogenized in buffer A and centrifuged for 10 min in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant (1 ml) was precleared, and IKK2 was immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of anti-IKK2 Ab (New England Biolabs). After extensive washing of the immunoprecipitate with buffer A, the pellet was resuspended in kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml TLCK, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO4, 10 mm Na2MoO4, and 10 nmokadaic acid). The kinase activity was assayed in 100 μl of kinase buffer containing 100 ng of immunoprecipitation protein and 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (0.5 μCi), using as substrate 100 ng of GST-IκBα-(1–317) or GST-IκBα-(1–54) and the corresponding Ala32/36 mutated protein. Aliquots of reaction were stopped at various times in 1 ml of ice-cold buffer A supplemented with 5 mm EDTA. The same protocol was used when the activity of IKK2 was followed by Western blot using anti-(P)S32IκBα Ab, except that 1 mm MgATP was used instead of [γ-32P]ATP. GST-IκBα was purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B chromatography and analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The linearity of the kinase reaction was confirmed over a period of 30 min (21Castrillo A. Diaz-Guerra M.J. Hortelano S. Martin-Sanz P. Bosca L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1692-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in the presence of the potential-sensitive probe CMXRos (40 nm), followed by analysis in a FACScan flow cytometer. The fluorescence in the presence of uncoupling agent m-chlorophenylhydrazone carbonylcyanide (10 μm) was considered to be 100%, and values were calculated as a percentage of the change of fluorochrome fluorescence (32Hortelano S.

FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2311-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Cells challenged for 8 h with different stimuli were incubated for 15 min with 10 μm DCFH or HE, and the fluorescence corresponding to the oxidized probes was followed by analysis in a flow cytometer as described previously (32Hortelano S. Dallaporta B. Zamzami N. Hirsch T. Susin S.A. Marzo I. Bosca L. Kroemer G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 34Kroemer G. Dallaporta B. Resche-Rigon M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 619-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). Incubation of cells with 50 μm t-butyl hydroperoxide and 20 μmperoxynitrite was used as positive control of ROI and reactive nitrogen intermediate release. Flow cytometric measurement of propidium iodide staining was performed after incubation of the cells with 0.005% propidium iodide, following a previous protocol (35Hortelano S. López-Collazo A. Boscá L. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 126: 1139-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 36Genaro A.M. Hortelano S. Alvarez A. Martinez C. Bosca L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1884-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Cells were analyzed in a FACScan cytometer (Becton & Dickinson, San Jose, CA) equipped with a 25-mW argon laser. The quantification of the percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated using a dot plot of the forward scatter against the propidium iodide fluorescence. Cell sorting and analysis of viable and apoptotic populations was performed to confirm the criteria of gating (37Hortelano S. Castrillo A. Alvarez A.M. Boscá L. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6525-6531Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Activation of caspase 3 (and caspase 7) was determined measuring the DEVDase activity in the cytosolic extracts, following the appearance of fluorescence fromN-acetyl-DEVD-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin as substrate. The corresponding peptide aldehyde and Z-VAD.fmk were used to inhibit caspase activity and to ensure the specificity of the reaction. The linearity of the caspase assay was determined over a 20-min reaction period. The number of experiments analyzed is indicated in each figure. Statistical differences (p < 0.05) between mean values were determined by one-way analysis of the variance followed by Student's t test. In experiments using x-ray films (Hyperfilm), different exposure times were used to avoid saturation of the bands. Incubation of RAW 264.7 cells with the PPAR ligands compound G, compound P, 15dPGJ2, and rosiglitazone did not promote the synthesis of NO. However, when cells were activated with LPS and IFN-γ, the presence of compound G, compound P, and 15dPGJ2, but not rosiglitazone, significantly inhibited the accumulation of NO in the culture medium through a mechanism that involved a reduction in the levels of NOS-2 mRNA and protein (Fig.1, B and C). The apparent Ki values for NO synthesis were 1.1, 6, and 0.6 μm for compound G, compound P, and 15dPGJ2, respectively. The low level of NOS-2 mRNA measured in cells treated for 4 h with compound G suggests that this molecule interferes with the stimulatory signaling elicited after LPS/IFN-γ challenge. Because NF-κB activation has been reported as a necessary event for NOS-2 expression (31Xie Q.W. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Nathan C. Xie Q.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13725-13728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the binding of NF-κB proteins to the κB motif of the NOS-2 promoter was assayed by EMSA. As Fig.2 shows, the binding of the dimers p50.p50 and p50.p65 to the κB sequence was impaired in cells incubated with 15dPGJ2 and compound G. However, treatment with compound P or rosiglitazone did not affect NF-κB binding. When the protein levels of cytosolic IκBα were determined after 30 min of challenge, an inverse correlation was observed with respect to the corresponding κB activity. The subcellular distribution of IκBα and IκBβ in activated RAW 264.7 cells was further analyzed by confocal microscopy, revealing an impaired degradation after incubation with 15dPGJ2 and compound G (Fig.3). These results suggest that compound G inhibits early signaling after LPS and IFN-γ challenge (in particular, the activation of NF-κB). To investigate whether these PPAR ligands can affect the transcription of genes requiring NF-κB activity, RAW 264.7 cells were transfected with CAT reporter plasmids containing the κB sites of the murine NOS-2 promoter or a 3× tandem of κB motifs linked to the minimal promoter of the conalbumin A gene. After stimulation with LPS/IFN-γ for 18 h, CAT activity was measured. As Fig. 4 shows, 15dPGJ2 and compound G inhibited CAT expression, whereas this effect was not observed in cells treated with rosiglitazone. The moderate inhibitory effect of compound P was more important on the pNOS.CAT reporter than on the (κB)3ConA.CAT counterpart, suggesting an action on NOS-2 transcription distinct from NF-κB activation.Figure 3Immunocytochemical analysis of IκB levels in RAW 264.7 cells treated with PPAR agonists. Cells were treated for 45 min with the indicated stimuli as described in the Fig. 2 legend. After fixation, the cells were incubated with anti-IκBα and anti-IκBβ Abs and stained with Cy3-labeled anti-rabbit IgG Ab (red).

https://openalex.org/W2079407969,"The spin trap α-phenyl-N-tert-butylnitron (PBN) is widely used for studies of the biological effects of free radicals. We previously reported the protective effects of PBN against ischemia-reperfusion injury in gerbil hippocampus by its activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and suppression of both stress-activated protein kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. In the present study, we found that PBN induced neurite outgrowth accompanied by ERK activation in PC12 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The induction of neurite outgrowth was inhibited significantly not only by transient transfection of PC12 cells with dominant negative Ras, but also by treatment with mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase inhibitor PD98059. The activation of receptor tyrosine kinase TrkA was not involved in PBN-induced neurite outgrowth. A protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, GF109203X, was found to inhibit neurite outgrowth. The activation of PKCe was observed after PBN stimulation. PBN-induced neurite outgrowth and ERK activation were counteracted by the thiol-based antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. From these results, it was concluded that PBN induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells through activation of the Ras-ERK pathway and PKC."

Originally these proteins were identified by their ability to catalyze the transfer of lipids between membranes in vitro(1Kader J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 380: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The suggestion that they would act as intracellular transporters of lipids between organelles was later questioned because of the fact that ns-LTPs are extracellular proteins. Other functions have been ascribed to ns-LTPs, including transport of cutin monomers (2Sterk P. Booij H. Schellekens G.A. Van Kammen A. De Vries S.C. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 907-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) and involvement in flowering (3Park S.Y. Jauh G.Y. Mollet J.C. Eckard K.J. Nothnagel E.A. Walling L.L. Lord E.M. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 151-164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also ns-LTPs have been suggested to be important in several types of plant stress response. These include responses to pathogens (4Molina A. Segura A. Garcı́a-Olmedo F. FEBS Lett. 1993; 316: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), drought (5Treviño M.B. O'Connell M.A. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 1461-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and temperature changes (6Dunn M.A. Hughes M.A. Zhang L. Pearce R.S. Quigley A.S. Jack P.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 229: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar,7Torres-Schumann S. Godoy J.A. Pintor-Toro J.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 18: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Despite their implication in these diverse aspects of plant biology, it is not clear which specific role ns-LTPs play here (8Kader J.C. Trends Plant Sci. 1997; 2: 66-70Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (218) Google Scholar,9Douliez J.P. Michon T. Elmorjani K. Marion D. J. Cereal Sci. 2000; 32: 1-20Crossref Scopus (304) Google Scholar). ns-LTPs are small proteins of about 90 residues with high values of pI (>9). The three-dimensional structures of ns-LTPs from several plant species are known, and they all consist of four α helices held together by four conserved disulfide bonds (10Heinemann B. Andersen K.V. Nielsen P.R. Bech L.M. Poulsen F.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A hydrophobic central cavity is found between the four helices. In vitro studies have shown that ns-LTPs can bind a variety of fatty acids (11Zachowski A. Guerbette F. Grosbois M. Jolliot-Croquin A. Kader J.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and lipids (12Douliez J.P. Michon T. Marion D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1467: 65-72Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). High-resolution structures of ns-LTPs in complex with fatty acids are available from barley (13Lerche M.H. Poulsen F.M. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2490-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and maize (14Han G.W. Lee J.Y. Song H.K. Chang C. Min K. Moon J. Shin D.H. Kopka M.L. Sawaya M.R. Yuan H.S. Kim T.D. Choe J. Lim D. Moon H.J. Suh S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 263-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In these structures the fatty acid occupies the central hydrophobic cavity. However, it has been difficult to draw any conclusions about thein vivo activity of ns-LTPs from their lipid binding properties because it is unknown which ligands, if any, are bound to ns-LTPs in vivo. ns-LTPs are encoded by multigene families (15Arondel V. Vergnolle C. Cantrel C. Kader J.C. Plant Sci. (Shannon). 2000; 157: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In a given plant, several ns-LTP genes can be found, and they are often specifically expressed in both time and tissue. Also individual ns-LTP genes are induced under a variety of conditions. It is not clear whether the various ns-LTPs have functional overlap. If this is the case, it may prove difficult to use genetic approaches in determining the function of ns-LTPs. This paper describes experiments on an aleurone-specific barley ns-LTP, LTP1 (16Mundy J. Rogers J.C. Planta. 1986; 169: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 17Svensson B. Asano K. Jonassen I. Poulsen F.M. Mundy J. Svendsen I. Carlsberg Res. Commun. 1986; 51: 493-500Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The LTP1 protein is abundant in the barley grain, from which it can be purified. The results show that most of this LTP1 is modified post-translationally by a new type of modification. As the modification is lipid-like in nature, this is the first direct demonstration that an ns-LTP binds lipids in vivo. Barley grains (cv optic) were purchased from Dansk Landbrugs Grovvareselskab. Trypsin (TPCK-treated, sequencing grade) was from Promega. 2-vinylpyridine was from Aldrich. Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine was from Sigma. Approximately 0.5 kg of barley grains was ground, and the resulting flour was extracted in water overnight at 4 °C at pH 6.5. After centrifugation, (NH4)2SO4 was added to 40% saturation, and the pellet was discarded. Subsequently (NH4)2SO4 was added to the supernatant to 75% saturation. Following precipitation, the pellet was resuspended in water and dialyzed overnight against water. The dialyzed solution was centrifuged, and the pH in the supernatant was adjusted to 6.5. This solution was loaded onto a large CM-52 carboxymethyl cellulose column (2.6-cm internal diameter, 30 cm long) equilibrated with 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5 (Buffer A). After a stable baseline was obtained, proteins were eluted with a linear gradient using 0.25 liters of Buffer A and 0.25 liters of Buffer B (Buffer A + 0.25 m KCl). Relevant fractions were identified by the presence of a strong band at 10 kDa on SDS-PAGE gels. These fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight against water. Then the pH was adjusted to 7.0, and the sample was loaded onto an SP-Sepharose column (1.6- cm internal diameter, 15 cm long) equilibrated with 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0 (Buffer C). After loading the sample, the column was washed with Buffer C, and the run-through was fractionated. Relevant fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE and pooled, the pH was adjusted to 6.0, and the sample was loaded onto a smaller CM-52 column (1.6-internal diameter, 20 cm long) equilibrated with Buffer A. Proteins were eluted using a linear gradient of 70 ml of Buffer A and 70 ml of Buffer B. LTP1-containing fractions were then pooled and applied, 8 ml at a time, to an S200 Sephacryl gel-filtration column (2.6-cm internal diameter, 60 cm long) equilibrated with 0.2 m(NH4)HCO3 (Buffer D). After elution with Buffer D, this results in >95% pure LTP1 as judged by SDS-PAGE. LTP1 was concentrated by lyophilizing the eluate. The LTP1 concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using ε280 = 4.6 mm−1 cm−1 (18Lerche M.H. Kragelund B.B. Bech L.M. Poulsen F.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 291-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Separation of unmodified LTP1 (um-LTP1) and post-translationally modified LTP1 (ptm-LTP1) was achieved by HPLC on a Hewlett-Packard system equipped with a Vydac C18 reverse-phase (RP) column. After application of the sample, a gradient from 15 to 35% acetonitrile (0.1% v/v trifluoroacetic acid) over 60 min (1 ml/min) separated the two forms of LTP1. Protein was detected using online absorption (280 nm) and fluorescence (λex = 275 nm, λem = 303 nm) measurements. Peak integration allowed determination of the relative amounts of the two forms because the UV absorbance spectra of um-LTP1 and ptm-LTP1 superimpose. The phenol-sulfuric acid test for carbohydrates was carried out as described earlier (19Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (41170) Google Scholar). Glucose was used as a standard. LTP1 was incubated in 150 μl at 2 mg/ml in 0.1m buffer (potassium citrate, pH 3.1, potassium acetate, pH 4.8, potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and Tris-HCl, pH 8.2 and pH 9.0, or CAPS, pH 10.0) in sealed glass vials in the autosampler of the HPLC system at 37 °C. At various time points, 20 μl was withdrawn and analyzed for amounts of ptm-LTP1 and um-LTP1 as described above. Progress curves were fitted to pseudo first-order kinetics. LTP1 was reduced and pyridine-ethylated by dissolving 75 nmol of LTP1 and 52 μmol of the disulfide reductant Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine in 100 μl of 6m guanidine hydrochloride and 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 6.5. After incubation for 30 min at 42 °C, 10 μl of neat 2-vinylpyridine was added, and the mixture was incubated for further 90 min in the dark. After desalting on a NAP-5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 20% (v/v) acetic acid, pyridine-ethylated LTP1 was further purified by RP HPLC using a gradient from 0 to 65% acetonitrile (0.1% v/v trifluoroacetic acid). Tryptic digestions were carried out by incubating pyridine-ethylated LTP1 with trypsin (10:1 by weight) in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 5 min at 37 °C. Peptide mapping and purification of the N-terminal tryptic peptide was carried out by separating tryptic peptides by RP HPLC using a 0–70% acetonitrile (0.1% v/v trifluoroacetic acid) gradient and detection using UV absorbance at either 220 nm (peptide bonds) or 254 nm (pyridyl-ethyl cysteine residues) as well as fluorescence detection (λex = 275 nm, λem = 303 nm). Tryptic peptides were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and automatic Edman sequencing. Acid-catalyzed release of the modification from the tryptic peptide was carried out by incubation in 3 m HCl for 1 h at 65 °C. ptm-LTP1 was dissolved in 600 μl of 90/10% H2O/D2O to a concentration of 3 mm. All spectra on this sample were recorded on a Bruker AMX600 spectrometer at 14.1 tesla with a 5-mm triple-resonance probe. The sample temperature was 310 K, and the pH was 7.2. A series of standard two-dimensional homonuclear spectra were recorded on this sample, including DQF-COSY (20Piantini U. Sørensen O.W. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 6800-6801Crossref Scopus (1887) Google Scholar), TOCSY (21Braunschweiler L. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 53: 521-528Crossref Scopus (3111) Google Scholar), and NOESY (22Kumar A. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wütrich K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1981; 103: 3654-3658Crossref Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Also a heteronuclear natural abundance 13C-HSQC spectrum was collected (23Bodenhausen G. Ruben D.J. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1980; 69: 185-189Crossref Scopus (2434) Google Scholar). The N-terminal tryptic peptide from ptm-LTP1 was purified as described above and dissolved in 40 μl of Me2SO-d6 to an approximate concentration of 8 mm. All spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity spectrometer at 11.7 tesla with a 4-mm1H NMR nanoprobe. The sample temperature was 298 K, and the spinning rate was ∼2 kHz at the magic angle (θ = 54.7°) with respect to the B0 field. Standard homonuclear experiments were recorded, including DQF-COSY, TOCSY (24Kupce E. Keifer P.A. Delepierre M. J. Magn. Reson. 2001; 148: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), NOESY, and ROESY (25Bothner-By A.A. Stephens R.L. Lee J. Warren C.D. Jeanloz R.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 811-813Crossref Scopus (1970) Google Scholar). Additionally, natural abundance 13C-HSQC and13C-HMBC (26Bax A. Summers M.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 2093-2094Crossref Scopus (3274) Google Scholar) spectra were collected. Low resolution MALDI MS (mass spectrometry) was carried out on a Finnigan Lasermat 2000 time-of-flight spectrometer using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as matrix. Nano-electrospray ionization mass spectra were acquired on a Q-TOF mass spectrometer (Micromass). The cone voltage was adjusted to the lowest possible at which complete declustering of the analyte was obtained, typically 30–35 V. The peptides were desalted on a nanoscale C18 column prior to analysis. Appropriate ions were selected in the first quadrupole and fragmented in the hexapole collision cell with a collision energy of ∼40 eV. Argon was used as collision gas at a pressure of 6 × 10−5 millibar. The fragment ions were detected in the TOF-reflector analyzer at a mass resolution of ∼5000. Spectra in negative ion mode were obtained under the same conditions as those in positive mode by switching all voltage polarities. Barley LTP1 was purified by a method similar to that published previously (27Sørensen S.B. Bech L.M. Muldbjerg M. Beenfeldt T. Breddam K. MBAA Tech. Quart. 1993; 30: 136-145Google Scholar). Initial MS studies of the purified protein revealed two peaks, one centered at the mass expected from the LTP1 sequence (9687 Da, taking the four disulfide bonds into account) and one peak corresponding to a mass ∼300 Da higher (Fig.1). This was a surprise because neither sequencing of the protein (17Svensson B. Asano K. Jonassen I. Poulsen F.M. Mundy J. Svendsen I. Carlsberg Res. Commun. 1986; 51: 493-500Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar) nor NMR studies (10Heinemann B. Andersen K.V. Nielsen P.R. Bech L.M. Poulsen F.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) had suggested the presence of a post-translational modification or co-purification of a ligand. The two forms were separated by RP HPLC, and subsequent N-terminal sequencing and amino acid analysis verified that the high mass form was LTP1. Because the extra mass persisted after extensive dialysis under strongly denaturing conditions (6 mguanidine hydrochloride, data not shown), it was concluded that it is bound covalently to LTP1 and thus is not a ligand. Henceforth the two forms are termed um-LTP1 and ptm-LTP1. Initially it was examined whether the modification could simply be a glycosylation. A simple and general analysis for the presence of carbohydrates is the phenol sulfuric acid method (19Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (41170) Google Scholar). When compared with a standard curve, the analysis indicated less than one glucose equivalent per 10 LTP1 molecules,i.e. the modification does not react positively in a phenol sulfuric acid test. To examine the nature of the protein-modification bond, we decided to study the conditions under which this bond would be hydrolyzed. After incubating solutions of ptm-LTP1 at various values of pH between 3.1 and 10.0, the time course of the conversion from ptm-LTP1 to um-LTP1 was analyzed by HPLC (Fig.2 A). Progress curves could be fitted well to pseudo first-order expressions (Fig. 2 B). From these experiments the pH profile for the observed rate constant,kobs, of the conversion reaction was generated (Fig. 2 C). The reaction is clearly base-catalyzed. However, for a simple hydroxide-catalyzed reaction, one would expect a straight line with slope of 1 in a log (kobs) versus pH plot (28Bell R.P. Acid-base Catalysis. Clarendon Press, Oxford1941: 1-10Google Scholar). However, in Fig. 2 C, the slope is around 0.4, indicating that the reaction is not a simple hydroxide-catalyzed hydrolysis. Nevertheless, this type of pH profile is indicative of an ester or an amide bond, the first being the more base-labile. The next step in the analysis was to localize to which amino acid in the LTP1 sequence the modification is bound. To narrow down the number of possibilities, tryptic peptides were generated by the digestion of denatured, reduced, and vinylpyridine-treated ptm-LTP1. The reduction and alkylation of LTP1 were carried out near neutral pH to minimize base-catalyzed hydrolysis of the protein-modification bond. The isolation of individual tryptic peptides by RP HPLC and analysis by MS and sequencing showed that the modification was bound to the N-terminal tryptic peptide constituted by residues 1–9: Leu-Asn-Cys-Gly-Gln-Val-Asp-Ser-Lys. This modified peptide eluted much later than and well separated from the other tryptic peptides, suggesting that the modification is hydrophobic in nature. The high-resolution electrospray mass spectrum of the fraction containing the modified peptide showed doubly and triply charged ionsm/z 681.93 and 454.97, respectively, corresponding to a peptide with a molecular mass of 1361.9. In addition, a very minor doubly charged peak at m/z 534.8 indicated the presence of the unmodified peptide (molecular mass of 1067.6, calculated mass of 1067.52). The presence of small amounts of unmodified peptide in the sample was presumably caused by the hydrolysis of the peptide-modification bond during sample handling. These results show that the additional mass attributable to the modification is 294.3 ± 0.1. Full-length Edman sequencing of the peptide showed the presence of all nine amino acids except the cysteine in position 3. However, because the cysteine thiol in ptm-LTP1 is accessible to modification with 2-vinylpyridine, this residue is very unlikely to be the site of modification. The data in Fig. 2 show that the hydrolysis of the protein-modification bond is base-catalyzed. Presumably the alkaline conditions of the coupling reaction in the Edman degradation caused at least partial hydrolysis of the protein-modification bond, thereby making it impossible to determine the modified amino acid by Edman sequencing. It was therefore decided to attempt sequencing by tandem mass spectrometry because this technique is well established for the site-specific assignment of post-translational modifications in peptides and proteins (29Roepstorff P. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The selection and collision-induced dissociation of the doubly charged ions at m/z 681.9 and 534.8 showed a nearly complete series of y and b ions (30Roepstorff P. Fohlman J. Biomed. Mass Spectrom. 1984; 11: 601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2389) Google Scholar) for the modified as well as for the unmodified peptide (Fig.3 and Table I). Based on abundant y2 and y3 ions in the MS/MS spectra of both compounds, the modified amino acid residue is unambiguously identified to be aspartic acid 7. The selection and dissociation of the triply charged ion atm/z 455, although resulting in a slightly more complex spectrum because of additional charge state fragment ions, confirm that Asp-7 is the modified amino acid residue (data not shown).Table IExpected and observed sequence ions for the peptide LNCGQVD*SKb ionAmino acid residuey“ ionModifiedUnmodifiedModifiedUnmodified114.0114.01LEU228.2228.22ASN81249.8*955.4436.3436.33CYS71135.8*841.4493.3493.34GLY6927.7*633.3621.4621.45GLN5870.6*576.3720.5720.46VAL4742.6*448.21129.8*835.57ASP3643.4*349.21216.8*922.58SER2234.1234.1LYS1147.1147.1The observed ions are indicated in bold. The asterix indicates sequence ions containing the modified amino acid residue. Open table in a new tab The observed ions are indicated in bold. The asterix indicates sequence ions containing the modified amino acid residue. An obvious next step was to determine the chemical structure of the modification. Negative results in the phenol sulfuric acid test ruled out most types of glycosylation. Furthermore, UV absorbance spectra of ptm-LTP1 and um-LTP1 could be superimposed, excluding strong chromophores in the modification. A comparison of two-dimensional homonuclear spectra of um-LTP1 and ptm-LTP1 revealed signals that could only arise from the modification (data not shown). Because LTP1 is an all-helix protein, the chemical shifts from a carbon carbon double bond could easily be distinguished from protein-derived signals. By measurement of the H–H coupling constant, the double bond was found to be in a cis configuration. Most other signals originating from the modification were found in the crowded aliphatic region of the spectra. Thus, it was not possible to determine the chemical structure of the modification from these spectra. Because the protein-modification bond is more base-labile than peptide bonds (Fig. 2) and Asp-7 is the modified residue (Fig. 3), it is likely that an ester bond connects the modification to the protein. We have been able to cleave this bond at least partially by both hydroxylaminolysis (31Bizzozero O.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 361-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and methanolysis (32Sattler W. Puhl H. Hayn M. Kostner G.M. Esterbauer H. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, difficulties with detection of the free modification have hampered this approach. It was therefore decided to use the N-terminal tryptic peptide as a ”handle“ for studying the modification further. Using nanoprobe two-dimensional 1H NMR, it was possible to assign all protein-derived protons in the peptide. This allowed for the identification of signals originating from protons in the modification. The intensities of these signals were comparable with those originating from the peptide. Fig. 4 shows part of a two-dimensional TOCSY spectrum together with a plausible assignment. The high field shifted signal is indicative of an omega methyl group in an aliphatic carbon chain. Noteworthy is the carbonyl in the suggested structure which terminates the spin system. On the basis of DQF-COSY and TOCSY spectra, several spin systems were observed, and it was possible at least partially to assign all of these (Fig.5). Fig. 5 also shows a structure which is compliant with all our NMR and MS data. To confirm the suggested structure, we unsuccessfully collected spectra that rely on through-space transfer of magnetization (NOESY and ROESY). However, further information was obtained by the collection of natural abundance13C-HSQC and 13C-HMBC spectra. These spectra verified the structures suggested from the homonuclear experiments. The HSQC spectrum shows one-bond hydrogen carbon correlations, giving a fingerprint of each hydrogen-bound carbon in the structure. In contrast the HMBC spectrum, which arises from two- and three-bond hydrogen carbon correlations, was helpful in assigning nonprotonated carbon nuclei. As an example Fig.6 shows the NMR evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid in the modification using a combination of homo- and heteronuclear experiments.Figure 5Assignments of spin systems originating from protons in the modification.

However, acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the peptide-modification bond allowed for analysis of the free modification by MS. Fig. 7 shows electrospray ionization spectra in both positive and negative ion mode of a sample obtained by incubating modified peptide in 3 m HCl at 65 °C. Desalting was omitted prior to mass spectrometric analysis of this sample because passage over the C18 column might cause loss of the liberated modifying group. In positive ion mode, we observed a peak at m/z 335.2 corresponding to a sodium adduct of the free modification. Attempts to obtain further information about the structure of this ion by MS/MS did not result in any fragmentation. In negative ion mode, a peak corresponding to the deprotonated form of the modification was observed at m/z311.5. In addition, this spectrum contains a series of peaks caused by sodium chloride clusters, (NaCl)n Cl−,n = 3–8. These account for the groups of peaks centered around m/z 211, 269, 329, 387, 445, and 503 and are easily recognized because of the multiple chlorine isotope patterns. The selection and collision-induced dissociation of the ion atm/z 311.5 gives rise to the spectrum shown in Fig.7 C. This spectrum is dominated by successive losses of water and carbon dioxide as reported to be characteristic for low energy collision-induced dissociation of monohydroxylated unsaturated fatty acid anions (33Wheelan P. Zirrolli J.A. Murphy R.C. Biol. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 22: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition, numerous low abundance fragment ions derived from the cleavage of the hydrocarbon backbone are observed, many of which are not visible in Fig. 7 C. Nearly all fragment ions can be rationalized based on the proposed structure, assuming that hydrogen rearrangement reactions take place as observed in extensive studies of low energy negative ion collision-induced dissociation of isotopically labeled hydroxylated-oxo-unsaturated fatty acids (34Wheelan P. Zirrolli J.A. Murphy R.C. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 7: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, determination of the structure based solely on the mass spectrum would not be possible. An unequivocal structure determination of the modification presumably requires labeling of the modification either with 13C for further NMR studies or with a radioactive isotope for easier detection and purification of the free modification. However, the practical problems with this approach should not be underestimated. The function of plant ns-LTPs has for a long time been puzzling. The original suggestion that these proteins would act as intracellular lipid transporters was inconsistent with the observation that ns-LTPs are extracellularly located secretory proteins. Since then, most suggestions for their involvement in various aspects of plant physiology have been supported only by indirect evidence. Biochemically it has been found that ns-LTPs are able to bind lipids and catalyze their transfer in vitro, and it has been suggested that this may be an important part of the in vivo function. However, because ns-LTPs bind a large variety of lipids, it has been unclear which ligands, if any, are relevant for a physiological function. The work presented here is the first demonstration that an ns-LTP is bound to a lipid-like compound in planta. We originally purified the LTP1 protein for other purposes. Initial mass spectrometric experiments revealed the presence of two peaks, one corresponding to um-LTP1 and a much larger peak corresponding to a hitherto undescribed modified form, ptm-LTP1. Presently we have no good explanation as to why this modification has escaped attention in earlier work. The samples used for the previous NMR structure determinations of LTP1 have been examined and found devoid of ptm-LTP1. However, other in-house samples contain ptm-LTP1. One explanation for this variance could be that earlier purification procedures were in a much larger scale. Therefore, several of the initial steps in the purification procedure would have taken much longer. It is possible that esterases, which could catalyze the hydrolysis of the protein-modification bond, are present in the barley flour extract. This could give large variations in the yield of um-LTP1versus ptm-LTP1. Because there presently is no good method of quantifying the relative amounts of the two forms in a crude extract (several types of gel electrophoresis have been tested), we have not searched for such enzyme activities. We see no way that ptm-LTP1 could be an experimental artifact. Other authors have noticed the presence of a modified form of LTP1 with a mass just below 10.0 kDa (35Lusk L.T. Goldstein H. Ryder D. J. Am. Soc. Brew. Chem. 1995; 53: 93-103Google Scholar, 36Evans D.E. Hejgaard J. J. Inst. Brew. 1999; 105: 159-169Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 37Jégou S. Douliez J.P. Mollé D. Boivin P. Marion D. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2000; 48: 5023-5029Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Additionally, a wheat homologue of barley LTP1 has been shown to exist in a post-translationally modified form having an excess mass of 294 Da (38Douliez J.P. Jégou S. Pato C. Larré C. Mollé D. Marion D. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2001; 49: 1805-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, in none of these studies has the modifying entity been characterized in any detail nor has the modified amino acid been identified. Post-translational modifications can be involved in many aspects of protein function, ranging from stability and dynamics to localization, regulation, and enzymatic activity. Also modifications of proteins by lipids are well known (39Casey P.J. Buss J.E. Methods in Enzymology: Lipid Modifications of Proteins. Academic Press, San Diego, California1995Google Scholar). However, none of these standard modifications can explain our observations. Furthermore, we have not been able to find any other instances of post-translational modifications in which lipid-like structures are bound through an oxygen ester bond to an acidic side chain of a protein. Thus, here we do not only describe the discovery of a modified form of LTP1 but also the finding of a new type of post-translational modification. First we attempted to isolate the modification by cleaving the linkage to the protein and extracting the modification into an organic phase (not shown). Analysis of such an extract by MS yielded a peak, which may have originated from the modification. However, both NMR and mass spectra of this sample show that it is heterogeneous, presumably because of side reactions during the cleavage and/or isolation procedure. However, by tryptic digestion a modified peptide, which can be detected by UV absorbance, was produced under mild conditions. By tandem MS sequencing of this peptide, we were able to localize aspartic acid 7 in the LTP1 sequence as the site of modification. Fig.8 shows the structure of LTP1. As seen, Asp-7 is solvent-exposed with the carboxylate pointing toward the solvent. However, it should be remembered that this structure has been determined using um-LTP1. NOESY spectra of ptm-LTP1 indicate that the modification is localized inside the hydrophobic cavity (data not shown). This is not in contradiction to the structure in Fig. 8 because it can easily be envisaged that the energy gain of transferring the modification to the cavity may overcome the energy cost of turning helix 1 to make Asp-7 point more inward. In fact, it is reasonable that Asp-7 is solvent-exposed in um-LTP1 because it then becomes accessible for whatever machinery that may be necessary for attaching the modification to the protein. By means of two-dimensional NMR, it was possible to obtain much information about the chemical nature of the modification. The structure shown in Fig. 5 fits all our experimental data including the observed mass difference between ptm-LTP1 and um-LTP1 (294.3 ± 0.1 Da) . It is surprising that this compound contains an odd number of carbons (C17H28O5). Although C17 lipids are known to occur naturally, they are much less common than even-numbered carbon chains. However, we have not been able to find any C2N structures that can explain all our observations. The suggested structure of the modification is a substituted form of cis-7-heptadecenoic acid. This is highly interesting because cis-9-heptadecenoic acid (CHDA) and substituted forms thereof are known to possess antimicrobial activity toward fungi (40Choudhury S.R. Traquair J.A. Jarvis W.R. J. Nat. Prod. (Lloydia). 1994; 57: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 41Benyagoub M. Rhlid R.B. Bélanger R.R. J. Chem.

Plant ns-LTPs have been classified as pathogenesis-related proteins (43Van Loon L.C. Van Strien E.A. Physiol. Mol. Plant.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 316: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) are known to inhibit the growth of pathogens in vitro. It is therefore relevant to note that CHDA and derivatives thereof have been isolated as the active compounds from the biocontrol agent Pseudozyma flocculosa(syn.: Sporothrix flocculosa), a yeast-like fungus with antagonistic activity against powdery mildew (40Choudhury S.R. Traquair J.A. Jarvis W.R. J. Nat. Prod. (Lloydia). 1994; 57: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 41Benyagoub M. Rhlid R.B. Bélanger R.R. J. Chem. Ecol. 1996; 22: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The mode of action of the biocontrol agent seems to be through the secretion of CHDA, which then interferes with the membranes in the attacked fungi, thereby causing rapid collapse of conidial chains (44Avis T.J. Bélanger R.R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 956-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Although speculative, it is possible that the biological role of ns-LTPs may include antibiotic activity mediated through either protein-bound lipids or release of lipids as response to pathogens.

Its expression in T cells leads to CD4 and major histocompatibility complex class I modulation and either enhancement or suppression of T cell activation. How this viral protein achieves multiple and at times opposing activities has been unclear. Through direct measurements of Nef and the Nef-GFP fusion protein, we find that these events are mediated by different Nef concentrations. Relative to the intracellular concentration that down-modulates surface CD4, an order of magnitude increase in Nef-GFP expression is required for a comparable modulation of major histocompatibility complex class I, and a further 3-fold increase is necessary to suppress T cell activation.

Immunol. 1996; 156: 360-370PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that Nef expression leads to suppression of T cell activation. In part, these differences may be due to either the use of stable cellular clones, which may not be representative of the entire cell population, or the use of promoters with varied activity. One study that used non-clonal cells examined T cell receptor stimulation-induced expression of the activation marker CD69 and convincingly found that all Nef-expressing cells (defined by CD4 down-modulation) also suppressed activation-induced CD69 expression (15Iafrate A.J. Bronson S. Skowronski J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 673-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). CD69 is one of several surface markers that identify activation of the biochemical pathways leading from the T cell receptor (16Ziegler S.F. Ramsdell F. Alderson M.R. Stem Cells. 1994; 12: 456-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Other Nef-mediated cellular phenotypes include down-modulation of CD4 and MHC I from the cell surface (17Guy B. Kieny M.P. Riviere Y. Le Peuch C. Dott K. Girard M. Montagnier L. Lecocq J.P. Nature. 1987; 330: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 18Garcia J.V. Miller A.D.

Our own studies have made use of T cell populations, continuous lines as well as primary CD4 T cells, that have been transduced with a retroviral vector. Nef expressed in these non-clonal populations resulted in enhanced T cell activation, as defined by IL-2 secretion, and down-modulation of surface CD4 (8Rhee S.S. Marsh J.W. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5128-5134PubMed Google Scholar, 10Schrager J.A. Marsh J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8167-8172Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 20Rhee S.S. Marsh J.W. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5156-5163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A Nef-mediated suppression (or enhancement) of CD69 induction or down-modulation of MHC I in transduced cells had not been noted in our experimentation with Nef. In this report we have chosen to study the effect of one variable, the concentration of intracellular Nef, on the biological activity of this HIV protein. The development of a quantitative chemiluminescent Western assay for Nef permitted an estimation of Nef concentrations in cell lysates, either transduced with thenef gene or infected with HIV. In order to define Nef concentrations at the cellular level, we have made use of a Nef-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein. By flow cytometry, we correlated the level of cellular Nef-GFP directly to measurements of Nef-modulated cell surface markers of cell function. We found that T cell activation enhancement and CD4 modulation, decreased MHC I surface expression, and suppression of CD69 induction were dependent, respectively, on increasing concentrations of Nef. These findings imply that the numerous Nef-mediated cellular phenotypes are possible within the same cell but are differentially expressed as a function of Nef concentrations. For flow cytometry, (R)-phycoerythrin (RPE)-conjugated antibodies to CD4 and CD69 were purchased from Caltag (South San Francisco, CA). The RPE conjugate antibody to HLA-ABC antigen (clone W6/32) was purchased from Dako A/S (Denmark). Standard beads with known molecular equivalents of soluble fluorochromes (MESF) of fluorescein were from Sigma. pQBI25 (green fluorescence protein (GFP) under CMV promoter) was purchased from Quantum (Canada), and pNA7GFP (NefGFP under CMV promoter) was kindly provided by Drs. Michael E. Greenberg and Jacek Skowronski (21Greenberg M.E. Bronson S. Lock M. Neumann M. Pavlakis G.N. Skowronski J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6964-6976Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The pNA7GFP plasmid encodes a fusion product of HIV Nef NA7 and genetically modified green fluorescent protein GFPsg25 (22Palm G.J. Zdanov A. Gaitanaris G.A. Stauber R. Pavlakis G.N. Wlodawer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). To construct the retroviral expression plasmids pLGFPSN and pLNefGFPSN, primers were first synthesized (Midland Certified Reagent Co.) as follows: gf5, 5′-ATATGAATTCATGGCTAGCAAAGGAGAAGAACTCTTCACTGG-3′; gf3, 5′-TTAAGGATCCTCAATCGATGTTGTACAGTTCATCCATG-3′. By using gf5 and gf3 as primers and pQBI25 as the template, a polymerase chain reaction fragment was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and then inserted into the EcoRI-BamHI site of pLXSN. The recombinant is the retroviral expression vector pLGFPSN. Plasmid pNA7GFP was digested with XbaI and blunted with T4 DNA polymerase and then digested with BamHI. The small fragment was inserted into the HpaI and BamHI site of pLXSN, resulting in pLNefGFPSN. Recombinant retrovirus containing LGFPSN and LNefGFPSN were derived from the packaging line GP293 (CLONTECH) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Briefly, pLGFPSN and pLNefGFPSN were cotransfected with pVSV (encoding the vesicular stomatitis virus envelope) into GP293 cells, and virus was collected 3 days later. Retroviral vectors LXSN, LNL43SN, and LG2ASN packaged by PA317 and used to transduce T cells were described previously (10Schrager J.A. Marsh J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8167-8172Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). VB (23Lifson J.D. Reyes G.R. McGrath M.S. Stein B.S. Engleman E.G. Science. 1986; 232: 1123-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) and Jurkat E6-1 (24Weiss A. Wiskocil R.L. Stobo J.D. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 123-128PubMed Google Scholar) T cells were obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health. Cells were grown in complete growth medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 1 mm non-essential amino acids, 10 mm sodium pyruvate, 4 µl/liter β-mercaptoethanol, and 50 µg/ml gentamicin, adjusted to pH 7.4). E6-1 T cells were transfected with pQBI25 or pNA7GFP using GenePORTER Transfection Reagent (Gene Therapy Systems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. VB T cells were transfected with pQBI25 or pNA7GFP by electroporation (T820; BTX Electronic Genetics, CA) set at 200 V, 65 ms, and 1 pulse. Cells (5 × 106/ml) were electroporated in RPMI 1640 (without fetal calf serum) with DNA at 30 µg/ml at room temperature. For transduction, cells were incubated with recombinant retroviruses carrying the expression vectors LXSN, LG2ASN, LNL43SN, LGFPSN, or LNefGFPSN and treated the next day with 2 mg/ml geneticin for E6-1 cells and 1 mg/ml for VB T cells. After 7 days in selection, cells were returned to complete medium, and whole populations of geneticin-resistant cells were used in subsequent studies. The peripheral lymphocyte fraction from healthy donors was obtained by leukapheresis and countercurrent centrifugal elutriation by the Department of Transfusion Medicine at the National Institutes of Health (25Czerniecki B.J.

A. 1999; 96: 8167-8172Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Proliferation of purified CD4 T cells was achieved by addition of CD3/CD28 beads (10Schrager J.A. Marsh J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8167-8172Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). CD4 T cells were infected with either wild type HIV-1 strain NL4-3 or a mutant NL4-3 virus containing a double single-point mutation in thenef gene (DS) (26Chowers M.Y. Spina C.A. Kwoh T.J. Fitch N.J. Richman D.D. Guatelli J.C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2906-2914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or mock-infected with complete media. After a 2-h incubation period at 37 °C, the cells were washed in 20 ml of RPMI 1640 to remove unadsorbed virions. Cell pellets were resuspended in complete media at 2 × 106 cells/ml and returned to 37 °C. Cells were then stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 beads. Viral replication was followed by determination of secreted HIV core antigen p24 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Coulter, Miami, FL). At peak p24 secretion (1–2 weeks), cells were pelleted, lysed, and examined for Nef protein as described below. Analysis of Nef and green fluorescent protein on Western blots was performed essentially as reported previously (10Schrager J.A. Marsh J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8167-8172Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Prior to lysis, cell count and volume were determined on a Coulter Z2 particle analyzer. Defined numbers of cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 in 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 2.0 mm EDTA and supplemented with 1.0 µg/ml leupeptin, 1.0 µg ml aprotinin, 1 µg/ml pepstatin A, and 250 µg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, followed by protein determination by BCA microassay (Pierce). Nef was then precipitated by rabbit polyclonal anti-Nef (27Shugars D.C. Smith M.S. Glueck D.H. Nantermet P.V. Seillier-Moiseiwitsch F. Swanstrom R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4639-4650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, NIAID, National Institutes of Health) and run on SDS-gel electrophoresis, blotted onto a cellulose nitrate membrane. This was probed with an anti-C-terminal Nef monoclonal antibody (Advanced Biotechnologies, Inc., Columbia, MD, catalog number 13-160-100), followed by a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD), and then developed with a chemiluminescence substrate (SuperSignal West, Pierce). Quantitation of chemiluminescence was achieved with a cooled charge coupled device camera system (ChemiImager, Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). For detection of GFP and Nef-GFP, the blots were probed with rabbit anti-sera against GFP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). To make each experimental Western blot of unknowns quantitative, recombinant protein standards were included. T cells were activated and IL-2 was assayed, as described previously (10Schrager J.A. Marsh J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8167-8172Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). For CD69 induction, cells (106/ml) were incubated with 3 µg/ml anti-CD3 mAb (clone HIT3a, PharMingen) for 18 h. Data were acquired on a Becton Dickinson FACScan with CELLQuest software. Histogram subtraction was accomplished with the same software on two populations of cells of equivalent cell number and involved subtraction of cellular events of one histogram from events of another at each increment of fluorescence intensity. Only positive values are plotted in the resultant differential histogram. Because some of the analyses that we required were not available in the proprietary software, files were converted to Microsoft Excel format with FCS Assistant shareware (www.fscpress.com) and then to text suitable for input to programs written in the Mathematica programming language and executed under the Mathematica system (Wolfram Research, Inc., Champaign, IL). The data consisted of pairs of numbers for each of the cells (n = 300,000–700,000). The first of these was proportional to the log of the fluorescence due to GFP or Nef-GFP and the second was proportional to the log of the fluorescence of a surface marker for T cell activation CD69, CD4, or HLA-A. A two-dimensional 80 × 80 bin histogram was formed, smoothed with a 3 × 3 running average, and viewed as a contour plot with GFP or Nef-GFP displayed along thex axis and the T cell antigens along the y axis. Because the individual cell measurements were independent, each of the 80 columns in the unsmoothed histograms was considered to be an independent distribution. The means of these distributions were plotted against the x scale value of fluorescence of GFP or Nef-GFP. The 95% confidence bands were also calculated. These bands broadened at higher GFP levels because the distributions broaden and the numbers of cells diminish. For comparison purposes, the y values for all bins were adjusted so that the mean value of the left-hand no/low GFP region was identical for both plots. Jurkat E6-1 cells were transduced with either Nef from HIV NL4-3 or a mutant, non-myristoylated NL4-3 Nef, generated by a glycine to alanine switch at residue position 2 (G2A). This mutant Nef is known to lack the numerous bioactivities of the native Nef protein (10Schrager J.A. Marsh J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8167-8172Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 15Iafrate A.J. Bronson S. Skowronski J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 673-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 28Guy B. Riviere Y.

Virol. 1995; 69: 4112-4121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were transduced with these nef genes in the Moloney LTR-based LXSN vector (18Garcia J.V. Miller A.D. Nature. 1991; 350: 508-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). The cellular concentration of Nef was determined by a chemiluminescence-based Western blot, where quantitation of emitted light was achieved with a cooled charge coupled device camera system (see “Experimental Procedures”). This analysis of cell lysates demonstrated the specific expression of the Nef proteins in cells transduced with either the wild type Nef or the G2A mutant Nef (Fig. 1A). Recombinant Nef at various levels is shown in lanes 1–4 of Fig. 1 A. The band intensities in this particular Western indicated that the NL4-3 (Fig. 1 A, lane 6) and the G2A (Fig.1 A, lane 7) Nef transduction of the Jurkat cell resulted in an expressed 2.0 ng of Nef per 7 × 106 cells for both transductants. Thus, each transductant contained ∼0.3 fg of Nef per cell. The VB T cell line used in this report is characterized in Fig.1 B, with recombinant Nef in lanes 1–4. The wild type Nef (Fig. 1 B, lane 5) is expressed at 0.3 fg per cell, and the G2A mutant Nef (Fig. 1 B, lane 6) is at 0.4 fg per cell. These results are representative of multiple T cell transductions using this retroviral expression system. Typically, geneticin-selected T cell populations expressed between 0.3 and 1.0 fg per cell. We also applied this Nef assay system to HIV-infected primary CD4 T cells. Purified and activated CD4 T cells were infected with either wild type NL4-3 HIV or a Nef-negative HIV mutant NL4-3 DS (26Chowers M.Y. Spina C.A. Kwoh T.J. Fitch N.J. Richman D.D. Guatelli J.C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2906-2914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The HIV-infected cells were harvested following the peak of HIV core antigen p24 secretion for maximal Nef generation (31Page K.A. Liegler T. Feinberg M.B. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1997; 13: 1077-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). At this time a minimum of 50% of the cells displayed signs of infection by microscopic examination. The lysate was applied to Western analysis for Nef content. HIV infection of CD4 T cells yielded 1 ng per 106 cells or 1 fg Nef per cell (Fig. 1 C, lane 3). Although all cells stained positive for intracellular p24 (data not shown), this measured level of Nef has to be taken as a conservative estimate with a minimum of 50% of the cells displaying infection by microscopic examination. Lysate from cells infected with the Nef-negative DS mutant HIV lacked detectable protein (lane 4). These findings suggest that retroviral transduction as performed here results in cellular Nef concentrations that approximate those seen in HIV infection. Retroviral transduction of T cells with Nef has been demonstrated previously by this laboratory (10Schrager J.A. Marsh J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8167-8172Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 20Rhee S.S. Marsh J.W. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5156-5163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to enhance T cell activation and to modulate surface CD4. Accordingly, activation of the Nef-expressing Jurkat T cell resulted in an enhanced secretion of IL-2 (Fig. 2). Stimulation of the Jurkat cell can also be evaluated through measurement of CD69 induction, which occurs to a majority of stimulated cells and is easily measured by flow cytometry. In contrast, IL-2 synthesis in these cells following CD3/CD28 stimulation is confined to only a few percent of the cell population, and thus, a signal generated by intracellular staining of IL-2 is difficult to discriminate from the noise levels of flow cytometry. The CD69 induction pathway from the T cell receptor is essential for IL-2 production but is not sufficient for T cell activation and IL-2 secretion (32Testi R. D'Ambrosio D. De Maria R. Santoni A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 479-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 33Kane L.P. Lin J. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3A, T cell receptor-mediated CD69 induction was unaffected by Nef expression from the retroviral vector. This suggests that the T cell receptor-mediated activation pathway involved in the Nef-mediated enhancement of IL-2 may be distinguishable from the pathway leading to CD69 expression. This is reasonable, since there are numerous pathways leading to IL-2 expression (33Kane L.P. Lin J. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In all panels of Fig. 3 antigen measurements (CD4 or MHC I) in Nef-expressing cells are depicted by a solid line, whereas staining of non-transduced control cells is represented by thedashed line. The E6-1 Jurkat cells express high levels of HLA-A (MHC I); down-modulation of MHC I in Nef-transduced Jurkat cells (Fig. 3 B) was absent. Thus, Nef expression from the retroviral vector did not significantly alter either surface MHC I or CD69.Figure 3Surface expression of CD69, MHC I, and CD4 in transduced Nef-expressing cells. Flow cytometry of Jurkat E6-1 cells (A and B) and VB cells (Cand D) transduced with NL4-3 Nef retroviral expression vector. A, Nef-expressing Jurkat cells were stained with anti-CD69 antibody following T cell receptor stimulation with anti-CD3 antibody (solid line). Activated non-Nef control cells are represented by the dashed line, whereas CD69 levels for the non-activated cells are represented by the dotted line. B, Nef-expressing Jurkat cells were stained with anti-MHC I antibody (solid line) and are compared with non-Nef controls (dashed line).

Control cell staining for MHC I is represented by the dashed line.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also examined Nef transduction of VB T cells which, like the E6-1 line, possess high surface expression of MHC I (in the form of HLA-A). Additionally, VB cells express a high level of CD4. The cells were stained for either CD4 (Fig. 3 C) or MHC I (Fig.3 D). Nef expression from the retroviral vector resulted in CD4 down-modulation (Fig. 3 C), but in the identical population there was no modulation of MHC I (Fig. 3 D). CD4 modulation does not occur to all cells in the transduced population (see Fig. 3 C and discussion below), but there is a 70% reduction in the mean fluorescence intensity for CD4 by an estimated 0.3 fg of native Nef per VB cell (Fig. 1 B). To permit a simultaneous measurement of surface antigen modulation with Nef concentration, we then constructed a Moloney LTR-based (LNefGFPSN) retrovirus for transduction of Nef-GFP. The Nef-GFP fusion protein had been shown previously (21Greenberg M.E. Bronson S. Lock M. Neumann M. Pavlakis G.N. Skowronski J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6964-6976Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) to possess a biologically active Nef, the expressed levels of which correlated proportionally with CD4 modulation. Transduction of VB cells with either the Nef-GFP or a control (non-Nef) GFP vector yielded a bimodal distribution of cells either negative or positive for GFP (or for Nef-GFP) expression (Fig.4). Each of the positive populations represented ∼40% of the total population (see Fig. 4 legend). Instrumental measurements of fluorescence are in relative units and can fluctuate from day to day. To quantitate the generated fluorescence and permit comparisons of data, all flow cytometry experiments that measured GFP and the Nef-GFP fusion protein were co-run with standard beads with known MESF of fluorescein. As shown in Fig. 4, Aand B, the expression of GFP did not affect expressed levels either of CD4 or MHC I (defined by fluorescence on y axis). Cells positive for Nef-GFP expression displayed a 77% down-modulation of surface CD4 (Fig. 4 C), whereas with the identical cells stained for MHC I, there was no measurable modulation (Fig.4 D). The mode fluorescence of the Nef-GFP-positive population in Fig. 4 was 67 relative fluorescent units (xaxis), which in this run was equivalent to 4.4 × 104MESF (fluorescein equivalents). With the VB cell we have seen that transduction with either native Nef (Fig. 3 C) or Nef-GFP (Fig. 4 C) has resulted in CD4 modulation. However, in order to permit a direct comparison of the two transductants, we need to compare only Nef-expressing cells. Although a mechanism has not been defined, the lack of full expression of Nef from an integrated LnefSN (LTR-Nef-SV40-Neo) retroviral vector has been documented previously (18Garcia J.V. Miller A.D. Nature. 1991; 350: 508-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). That is, cells that have been selected for geneticin resistance (Neo; neomycin phosphotransferase) do not always coexpress Nef. The Nef-GFP-positive cells in the transduced population displayed in Fig.4 C are 38% of the total geneticin-resistant population, and our measurement of CD4 modulation only included the Nef-GFP-expressing cells. Estimation of CD4 modulation in cells transduced by the native Nef, for example in Fig. 3, is not so straightforward. Indeed, our calculation for percent modulation, which comes from mean fluorescence, included all geneticin-resistant cells and thus included cells that could be negative for Nef expression. Corrections can be achieved, however, by only including cells that functionally display the presence of Nef. The modulation of CD4 in the Nef-transduced VB population of Fig. 3 C occurred to 65% of the selected cells (histogram subtraction, see “Experimental Procedures”). A comparison of the mode fluorescence between the CD4-modulated population (peak ofsolid line plot of Fig. 3 C; 179 relative fluorescent units on x axis) and the mode of the control CD4 levels (dashed line; 991 relative fluorescent units) yielded an 82% decrease in surface CD4. Additionally, if Nef expression is limited to 65% of the cells, one can deduce that the native Nef-transduced cells possessed a Nef concentration of 0.5 fg per cell (up from 0.3 fg in the total population). Thus, transduction of VB cells with either native Nef or Nef-GFP resulted in ∼80% modulation of surface CD4 but with no measurable change in MHC I. Also, transduction of the Jurkat E6-1 cell did not lead to MHC I modulation or loss of CD69 induction. Previous works have demonstrated that Nef can affect these latter functions, but there remains the need to define the mechanism by which the varied outcomes are possible. With the ability to measure Nef-GFP at the cellular level with flow cytometry, we then characterized T cell surface CD4, MHC I, and CD69 as a function of Nef-GFP concentration. In order to correlate MESH values from flow cytometry with protein concentration of cellular GFP, we first established a stable Jurkat clone expressing a high uniform level of GFP (Fig. 5A). Attempts to generate a stable highly fluorescent Nef-GFP clone were non-productive. The GFP clone yielded a mean fluorescence intensity of 95.1 relative units, which from standard beads yielded 1.22 × 105MESF. To correlate these values with cellular GFP, the lysate equivalent of 105 cells was applied to an SDS gel along with varied levels of recombinant GFP (Fig. 5 B). This permitted an estimate of 1.7 ng of GFP from the cell aliquot or 17 fg per cell. An additional two independent determinations yielded similar estimates (data not shown). We can use the relationship of 17 fg of GFP per cell yielding a fluorescence intensity equal to 1.22 × 105 MESF units per cell to estimate expressed GFP levels in cells from the cytometry-derived MESF values. The GFP VB population of Fig.4 B, the cells of which possess a fluorescence intensity of 1.45 × 105 MESF units, would thus be predicted to contain 20 fg of GFP per cell. If the GFP moiety of the Nef-GFP fusion product possessed fluorescence equivalent to the non-fusion GFP molecule, then the 4.4 × 104 MESF units of Nef-GFP population of VB cells (Fig. 4) multiplied by the same factor (17 fg of GFP"

Cytohesin-1 is an integrin-binding protein and guanine nucleotide exchange factor that activates binding of the leukocyte integrin leukocyte function antigen-1 to its ligand, intercellular adhesion molecule 1. Cytohesin-1 bears a carboxyl-terminal pleckstrin homology domain that aids in reversible membrane recruitment and functional regulation of the protein. Although phosphoinositide-dependent membrane attachment of cytohesin-1 is mediated primarily by the pleckstrin homology domain, this function is further strengthened by a short carboxyl-terminal polybasic amino acid sequence. We show here that a serine/threonine motif within the short polybasic stretch of cytohesin-1 is phosphorylated by purified protein kinase Cδ in vitro. Furthermore, the respective residues are also found to be phosphorylated after phorbol ester stimulation in vivo. Biochemical and functional analyses show that phosphorylated cytohesin-1 is able to tightly associate with the actin cytoskeleton, and we further demonstrate that phosphorylation of the protein is required for maximal leukocyte function antigen-1-mediated adhesion of Jurkat cells to intercellular adhesion molecule 1. These data suggest that both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase C-dependent intracellular pathways that stimulate β2-integrin-mediated adhesion of T lymphocytes converge on cytohesin-1 as functional integrator.

They are known to play important roles in either development or somatic functions such as wound healing and the regulation of complex cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions within the immune system (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9011) Google Scholar). The avidity of integrins for their ligands is dependent on the activation state of the cell they are expressed on (1Hynes R.O.

This type of regulation of cell adhesion has been termed inside-out signaling because intracellular signaling pathways triggered by protein tyrosine kinase or G-protein-coupled receptors have been shown to contribute to integrin-mediated adhesiveness. The mechanisms by which cytoplasmic signals are transmitted across the plasma membrane through integrin receptors are just emerging, but compelling evidence suggests that the intracellular domains of both α and β chains participate in this process (4Lub M. van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.F. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 479-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 5Kolanus W. Seed B. Curr. Opin.

Previous studies have attempted to elucidate these signaling pathways. Recently, candidate cytoplasmic regulatory factors of integrin activation have been identified, either by biochemical methods or with the help of the two-hybrid system (7Hemler M.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). One of them, cytohesin-1, is a 47-kDa intracellular protein that interacts specifically in several systems with the cytoplasmic domain of the leukocyte integrin αLβ2 (CD11a/18, LFA-1) (9Kolanus W. Nagel W. Schiller B. Zeitlmann L. Godar S. Stockinger H. Seed B. Cell. 1996; 86: 233-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Cytohesin-1 bears a short amino-terminal domain that may aid in oligomerization, an extended central homology region that is similar to that of the yeast Sec7 protein, and a carboxyl-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH)1 domain as well as a short polybasic region. Overexpression of cytohesin-1 or subdomain constructs in the Jurkat T-cell line was shown to have pronouncedin vitro effects on the binding of αLβ2 to its ligand, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1). Whereas the overexpression of full-length cytohesin-1 resulted in a constitutive adhesion of αLβ2, expression of the PH domain construct specifically inhibited the activation of LFA-1 in a dominant negative fashion (9Kolanus W. Nagel W. Schiller B. Zeitlmann L. Godar S. Stockinger H. Seed B. Cell. 1996; 86: 233-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). PH domains are structural modules present in more than a hundred proteins that play known or postulated roles in signal transduction. It is commonly found that PH domains aid in membrane recruitment of proteins through their interactions with phosphorylated ligands present at the inner leaflet of cellular membranes (10Pawson T.

A number of PH domains, including the PH domain of cytohesin-1, were shown to bind phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) in vitro with high affinity (12Lemmon M.A. Falasca M. Ferguson K.M.

These findings implicated the involvement of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in the LFA-1 activation pathway, and we have subsequently shown that a constitutively active version of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase suffices to activate the αLβ2 adhesion pathway in a T-cell line (17Nagel W.

Functional, biochemical, and cell biological evidence furthermore suggested that cytohesin-1 is located downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and that it is regulated by the recruitment of its PH domain to the plasma membrane (17Nagel W.

The PH domain was supported in this function by the carboxyl-terminal polybasic region of the protein, which proved to be necessary for membrane association and stabilized PIP3 binding in vitro (22Nagel W. Schilcher P. Zeitlmann L. Kolanus W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1981-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These data supported a model in which membrane recruitment of a regulatory molecule provided an effective means for activating β2 integrin function. Cytohesin-1 belongs to a family of molecules that bear specific guanine nucleotide exchange activity for so-called ARF-GTPases (23Jackson T.R. Kearns B.G. Theibert A.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 489-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 24Donaldson J.G. Jackson C.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar); these molecular switches belong to the Ras superfamily. ARFs are involved in intracellular vesicle budding and have also been implicated in remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. We have very recently shown that a mutation in the Sec7 domain of cytohesin-1 that blocks GTP binding to ARF proteins in vitro also interferes with cell spreading and adhesion in Jurkat cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (25Geiger C. Nagel W. Boehm T. van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Kremmer E. Hogg N. Zeitlmann L. Dierks H. Weber K.S. Kolanus W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2525-2536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we show that the regulatory molecule cytohesin-1 is a likely target for other important elements of the signaling machinery that regulates β2 integrin-mediated cell adhesion (4Lub M. van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.F. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 479-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). We found that phorbol ester stimulation of Jurkat cells results in phosphorylation of cytohesin-1. The protein is specifically modified at a site within the carboxyl-terminal polybasic region, the presence of which had been shown to play a crucial role in membrane recruitment of the protein; mutational and functional analysis showed that phosphorylated cytohesin-1 is able to associate with the actin cytoskeleton. Expression of amino-terminal cytoplasmic immunoglobulin fusion proteins has been described previously (9Kolanus W. Nagel W. Schiller B. Zeitlmann L. Godar S. Stockinger H. Seed B.

For some of the constructs, a so-called FLAG tag was used, which replaced the Ig portion as the amino-terminal fusion sequence in the respective chimeras. The following sequence for the FLAG tag was employed: 5′-AAG-CTT-GCC-ACC-ATG-GAT-TAC-AAG-GAT-GAC-GAC-GAT- AAG-ACG-CGT-3′; the respective double-stranded adaptor was inserted into theHindIII and MluI sites of the vector. Mutants of cytohesin-1 (S151A, E157K, S238A, T277A, T297V, S311A, S318A, S394A, S394D, T395A, T395E, S394A/T395G, and S394D/T395E) were generated by polymerase chain reaction-based site-directed mutagenesis (27Ausubel, F.

Amino-terminal GST fusion proteins were generated by insertion of the respective cytohesin-1 cDNA fragments into pGEX-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All constructs were confirmed by double-strand sequencing. The cytohesin-1-specific monoclonal antibody mAb7H2 was described previously (25Geiger C. Nagel W. Boehm T. van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G.

Anti-FLAG antibody, ANTI-FLAG-M5, was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich; peroxidase-conjugated affinity-purified antibodies, rabbit anti-mouse IgG (H+L) fragment, rabbit anti-rat IgG (H+L) fragment, goat anti-human IgG (H+L) fragment, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated affinity-purified goat anti-human IgG, and Texas Red sulfonyl chloride-conjugated affinity-purified donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) fragment were all purchased from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). The rabbit anti-actin antibody ANTI-ACTIN was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Jurkat E6 cells (1.6 × 107) were infected with recombinant vaccinia viruses as described previously (28Romeo C. Seed B. Cell. 1991; 64: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar,29Kolanus W. Romeo C. Seed B. Cell. 1993; 74: 171-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). 1 h after infection, cells were washed with PBS, resuspended in phosphate-free RPMI 1640 medium, and incubated with 1000 μCi [32P]orthophosphate/ml for 5 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Subsequently, 40 ng/ml PMA was added. After an incubation period of 30 min, the cells were collected and lysed with lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Samples were centrifuged, and the resulting supernatants were incubated with protein A-Sepharose 6MB beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Beads were washed multiple times with lysis buffer, and the resulting samples were loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Immunoblots from these gels were exposed to x-ray films. Jurkat E6 cells or transfected COS-7 cells were stimulated for 1 h with 40 ng/ml PMA. Cells were collected and processed as described under “Cellular Fractionation.” Subsequently, the cytosolic fractions were subjected to nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. COS-7 cells were treated as described under “PMA-induced in Vivo Phosphorylation.” 5 units of alkaline phosphatase were added to 50-μl aliquots of cell extract where indicated. Samples were incubated at 37 °C and subjected to nondenaturing PAGE. Cytohesin-1 protein was expressed in COS-7 cells by DEAE-dextran transfection. Cells that had been transfected with cDNA coding for cytohesin-1 were collected by centrifugation and resuspended on ice in 0.5 ml of ice-cold hypotonic solution (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) containing 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm benzamidine, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were then sheared mechanically and centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 15 min to remove nuclei and the insoluble fraction, and the resulting supernatant cytosol was collected. This cytosolic fraction containing cytohesin-1 was used for in vitro phosphorylation under the following reaction conditions: 50 mmK2HPO4/KH2PO4, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 200 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 20 μg/ml PMA, 2 mm ATP, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 20 μg/ml PKCδ at pH 7.4 and 30 °C for 120 min. Nondenaturing gel electrophoresis was essentially performed as described previously (30Forchhammer K. Tandeau de Marsac N. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The following, slightly modified buffers and solutions were used in the present study: (a) separation gel, 3 ml of 1 mTris-Cl (pH 9.0), 1.5 ml of acrylamide/bisacrylamide (30%/0.8% aqueous solution), 1.45 ml of H2O, 60 μl of Nonidet P-40 (5% aqueous solution), 30 μl of ammoniumperoxodisulfate (10% aqueous solution), and 6 μl ofN,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylendiamine; (b) stacking gel, 1.35 ml of H2O, 625 μl of 0.5 m Tris-Cl (pH 7.1), 0.5 ml of acrylamide/bisacrylamide (30%/0.8% aqueous solution), 12.5 μl of ammoniumperoxodisulfate (10% aqueous solution), 25 μl of Nonidet P-40 (5% aqueous solution), and 2.5 μl of N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylendiamine; (c) running buffer, 1000 ml of H2O, 3 g of Tris base, and 15 g of glycine; and (d) 5× sample buffer, 4 ml of 0.5m Tris-Cl (pH 7.1), 6 ml of glycerol, and 10 mg of bromphenol blue. Electrophoresis was performed at 800 mV/mm. Reaction conditions were 10 mm HEPES, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 200 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 20 μg/ml PMA, 200 μm ATP, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 100 μg protein/ml respective protein substrate, and 1 μg/ml PKCδ at pH 7.5 and 30 °C for 60 min. Jurkat E6 cells were pretreated with cytochalasin D (50 μm, 60 min) where indicated to disrupt actin filaments or with nocodazole (2.5 μg/ml, 60 min) to disrupt microtubules. These concentrations of cytochalasin D or nocodazole were maintained throughout the whole fractionation procedure. Cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended on ice in 0.5 ml of ice-cold hypotonic solution (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) containing 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Fractionation of cells was performed as described previously (31Meller N. Liu Y.C. Collins T.L. Bonnefoyberard N. Baier G. Isakov N. Altman A.R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5782-5791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were sheared, nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant cytosol was collected. The cytosolic fraction was brought to a final concentration of 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 and 150 mm NaCl and centrifuged at 15,000 × g, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in hypotonic buffer. A typical sample, containing mainly cytoskeletal components from ∼2 × 107 cells was incubated with 50 ng of GST-cytohesin-1 for 10 min, as indicated. The samples were centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 15 min, and the pellet (insoluble fraction containing cytoskeletal components) and supernatant (soluble fraction) were subjected to gel electrophoresis. Jurkat E6 cells were infected with recombinant vaccinia viruses. 6 h after infection, cells were labeled with 12 μg/ml bisbenzimide H33342 fluorochrome trihydrochloride (Calbiochem) for 30 min at 37 °C, collected by centrifugation, resuspended in Hank's buffered saline solution, and delivered to 96-well plates (NUNC; Maxisorp) at 1.5 × 105 cells/well. Before adhesion, plates were coated with goat anti-human IgG (Fcγ-specific) antibody at 0.85 μg/well for 90 min at 25 °C, blocked with 1% (w/v) BSA in PBS, incubated with culture supernatants from COS-7 cells expressing ICAM-1-Ig fusion protein, and subsequently used in the assay. Where indicated in the figures, cells were incubated with 40 ng/ml PMA or 10 μg/ml cytochalasin D for 0.5 h before the adhesion assay. Cells were then allowed to adhere for 1 h at 37 °C, and unbound cells were carefully washed off with 3 × 300 μl of Hank's buffered saline solution. Bound cells were assayed in 100 μl of 2% (v/v) formaldehyde in PBS using a fluorescence plate reader (Cytofluor II; PerSeptive). The signal of 1.5 × 105 cells/well at 490 nm corresponds to 100% adhesion. 6 h after infection of Jurkat E6 cells with recombinant vaccinia viruses and pretreatment for 1 h with 20 ng/ml PMA or 10 μg/ml cytochalasin D, where indicated, cells were placed on poly-l-lysine-covered microscope slides for 1 h in a humidified chamber at 37 °C. The nonadherent cells were then washed off with Hank's buffered saline solution, and adherent cells were fixed and immobilized with freshly prepared 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, cells were permeabilized for 15 min with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS, blocked with 2% (w/v) glycine in PBS, and incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-human IgG (Fcγ-specific) antibody (Dianova) in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. For the actin stain, slides were incubated with an anti-actin antibody for 1 h. Slides were subsequently washed with PBS and incubated with Texas Red-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody. After the final wash with PBS, slides were mounted on a 9:1 mixture of glycerol and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, containingn-propyl-gallate (20 mg/ml) as an anti-fading reagent. The samples were then examined on a confocal laser scanning apparatus (Leica TCS-NT system; Leica) attached to a Leica DM IRB inverted microscope with a PLAPO 63 × 1.32 oil immersion objective. PH domains of cytohesin-1 were expressed as GST fusion proteins as described previously (17Nagel W. Zeitlmann L. Schilcher P. Geiger C. Kolanus J. Kolanus W. J. Biol.

An optical evanescence resonant mirror cuvette system (IAsys; Affinity Sensors) was used to measure interaction of GST fusion proteins with PIP3. A lipid monolayer containing 70% (w/w) β-palmitoyl-γ-oleoyl-l-α-phosphatidylcholine and 30% (w/w) dioleoyl-l-α-phosphatidyl-dl-glycerol or a lipid mixture of 60% (w/w) β-palmitoyl-γ-oleoyl-l-α-phosphatidylcholine and 30% (w/w) and 10% (w/w) PIP3 (Matreya, Inc.) was mounted on a hydrophobic sensor surface (FCH-0601) at 0.1 mg/ml lipid. The cuvette was subsequently washed with 0.1 m HCl, PBS, and 10 mm NaOH. After the final wash with PBS, the cuvette was equilibrated in PDI binding buffer (PBS, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.001% (v/v) Igepal CA-630), and affinity-purified GST fusion proteins dissolved in binding buffer were added to a final concentration of 150 nm each. The binding of the GST fusion proteins was monitored for 500 s. Dissociation was initiated by adding PDI binding buffer to the cuvette. Determination of the association equilibrium constant was done by equilibrium titration. The interaction profiles for each protein were analyzed using FASTfit kinetics analysis software supplied with the instrument. With the help of in vivo labeling experiments, we discovered that a cytoplasmic Ig (cIg) fusion protein of cytohesin-1 was strongly phosphorylated in Jurkat cells after incubation of the cells with PMA. COS-7 cells were transfected with a cDNA coding for cIg-cytohesin-1 fusion protein or control protein (Fig. 1); the cells were then labeled with 2 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate and subsequently activated for 1 h with PMA. After this treatment, cells were lysed, and the fusion proteins from the samples were immunoprecipitated on protein A and subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Fig. 1 shows that the 32P content of the cIg-cytohesin-1 fusion protein increases dramatically and specifically after PMA activation, whereas background labeling of the control protein remained constant. Loading of the fusion proteins was identical, as detected by anti-cytohesin-1 or anti-Ig immunoblotting (Fig. 1; data not shown). We then discovered that the phosphorylated form of endogenous cytohesin-1 in Jurkat cells could be visualized as a fast-migrating species in nondenaturing Tris-glycine gels. Because no difference in the migratory behavior of endogenous or overexpressed cytohesin-1 from unstimulated or PMA-induced cells was observed when SDS-PAGE was employed (Fig. 1; data not shown), we subsequently used nondenaturing Tris-glycine gels as well as an adapted immunotransfer protocol. Using this methodology, we found that PMA stimulation of the cells resulted in a second fast-migrating band that also reacted specifically with an anti-cytohesin-1 monoclonal antibody (Fig.2; data not shown). This band was hypothesized to be the phosphorylated form of the protein because in nondenaturing gels, modification of a protein with charged compounds should normally lead to an increase in its electrophoretic mobility (30Forchhammer K. Tandeau de Marsac N. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This was confirmed by adding alkaline phosphatase to the samples before electrophoresis, transfer, and detection: calf intestine phosphatase treatment was found to remove the lower band quantitatively from the samples. This was consistent with the notion that the lower band corresponded to in vivo phosphorylated cytohesin-1 and not to the PMA-dependent induction of a different isoform of the cytohesin family or to an unknown modification (Fig. 2). Using the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 as a detecting agent, we found that cytohesin-1 was likely not tyrosine-phosphorylated after PMA treatment (data not shown). It was therefore assumed that the modification occurred on serine(s) or threonine(s). Because cytohesin-1 belongs to a family of at least four extremely conserved proteins in mammals, we tested whether other family members became phosphorylated under the conditions used. Previously, we had produced a rat antibody that reacted exclusively with cytohesin-1 (25Geiger C. Nagel W. Boehm T. van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Kremmer E. Hogg N. Zeitlmann L. Dierks H. Weber K.S. Kolanus W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2525-2536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but there are no reagents available to specifically detect other isoforms (e.g. cytohesin-2/ARNO or cytohesin-3/GRP1). We therefore employed expression of the respective proteins containing amino-terminally fused small FLAG tags because larger fusion elements were found to obscure the differences in migratory behavior of the phosphorylated versus the unphosphorylated forms (data not shown). Fig. 3 shows FLAG-tagged cytohesin-1, ARNO, and GRP1, which were expressed in Jurkat cells, subjected to Tris-glycine electrophoresis, and detected on immunoblots with the help of an anti-FLAG antibody. Comparing the samples, we observed that phosphorylation of cytohesin-1 was most robust and reproducible. Usually about 40–50% of the protein was phosphorylated after 1 h of PMA treatment. In the ARNO sample, a fast-migrating but normally somewhat weaker band was detected in the majority of the experiments performed. However, we never found any indication for phosphorylated GRP1 in this system. An important clue to the mapping of the phosphorylation site was therefore obtained by comparison of the peptide sequences of cytohesin-1, ARNO, and GRP1. There are several PKC consensus phosphorylation sites in these proteins, but most of these are conserved among them. However, the carboxyl-terminal polybasic stretch is an exception, inasmuch as this portion has among the most divergent sequence elements in the otherwise highly conserved primary peptide structures of the protein family. Furthermore, the polybasic stretch was shown to be important for the function of cytohesin-1 because it collaborated with the PH domain in membrane recruitment and phospholipid binding. A close look revealed that cytohesin-1 contained two potential phosphorylation sites in this region, namely, serine 394 and threonine 395. Only one of these sites was conserved in ARNO (serine 392), whereas GRP1 did not contain a potential phosphorylation site in the homologous carboxyl-terminal sequence stretch at all. Assuming that the phosphorylation site may be located in the carboxyl-terminal polybasic stretch (Fig.4A), site-directed mutagenesis was used to specifically map the phosphorylated residues in cytohesin-1. Using the nondenaturing gel assay, we found that mutagenesis of both serine 394 and threonine 395 affected the phosphorylation status of cytohesin-1 (Fig. 4B). However, complete inhibition of phosphorylation was observed when both residues were simultaneously replaced by alanines or glycines, respectively. This result led us to conclude that serine 394 and threonine 395 are the phosphorylated residues in cytohesin-1. Because it was formally possible that by mutagenesis we had obtained an indirect effect,e.g. by targeting regulatory sites that remained unphosphorylated themselves, we mutated all consensus PKC phosphorylation sites in the protein and consistently found that none of t"

Gurakar A. Fielding C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7066-7072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LCAT plays a key role in cholesterol homeostasis by mediating the production of most of the cholesteryl esters in human plasma. It has been suggested (2Glomset J.A. J. Lipid Res. 1968; 9: 155-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Fielding C.J. Feilding P.E. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 211-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that LCAT plays an important role in reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) by creating a concentration gradient for the efflux of free cholesterol from peripheral cells to HDL particles and its conversion to cholesteryl esters. The cholesteryl esters are internalized within the lipoprotein core for ultimate transport to the liver for clearance or recycling. Thus, factors affecting the structure, activity, or concentration of LCAT are likely to affect the homeostasis of plasma cholesterol and the RCT process, one of several proposed mechanisms (4Tall A.R. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1255-1274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by which HDL may protect against atherosclerosis. Recent investigations (5Vohl M.C. Neville T.A. Kumarathasan R. Braschi S. Sparks D.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5976-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) suggest that LCAT can act as an antioxidant and prevent the accumulation of oxidized lipid in plasma lipoproteins. In human plasma, LCAT is almost entirely associated with lipoproteins containing apoA-I, its principal physiological activator (6Cheung M.C. Wolf A.C. Lum K.R. Tollefson J.H. Albers J.J. J. Lipid Res. 1986; 27: 1135-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Franconeet al. (1Francone O.L. Gurakar A. Fielding C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7066-7072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown the presence of LCAT, cholesteryl ester transfer protein, apoD, and a small amount of apoA-I in a complex termed pre-β3-LpA-I that is involved in the esterification and transfer of cell-derived cholesterol. We have recently found (7Krimbou L. Tremblay M. Davignon J. Cohn J.S. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 38: 2373-2386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar) an association between apoE and α2-macroglobulin (α2M) in human plasma, when we observed that LCAT and apoE migrate to the same position in two-dimensional electrophoretic gels together with α2M, in particles 18.5 nm in diameter. This raises the possibility that LCAT circulates in plasma in association with α2M. Human α2M, the largest known proteinase inhibitor (M r = 720,000), is found at high concentrations (2–5 µm) in plasma and in extravascular spaces (8Sottrup-Jensen L. Putnam F.W. The Plasma Proteins.

It plays a pivotal role in the clearance of proteinases from the circulation and in regulating their activity in fibrinolysis, coagulation, and complement activation (10Starkey P.M. Barrett A.J.

Atherosclerosis. 1985; 55: 35-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). α2M is also a carrier of specific cytokines and various non-proteolytic proteins that include the transforming growth factor TGF-β, the platelet-derived growth factor-BB (12Crookston K.P. Webb D.J. Wolf B.B. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the β-amyloid peptide (13Du Y. Ni B. Glinn M. Dodel R.C. Bales K.R. Zhang Z.

Lipid Res. 1998; 38: 2373-2386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The binding affinities of α2M for different non-proteolytic proteins depend on its conformation, but α2M in plasma is present almost entirely in the native conformation. This form of α2M is fully functional as a proteinase inhibitor but is not recognized by the cell surface receptor, which is an α2M receptor/low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) (8Sottrup-Jensen L. Putnam F.W. The Plasma Proteins. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1987: 192-291Google Scholar, 14Jensen P.H. Moestrup S.K. Gliemann J. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This receptor is responsible for the rapid plasma clearance of conformationally transformed α2M following its reaction with proteinases or small primary amines that modify the α2M thiol ester bonds. Gonias and co-workers have documented that the binding of TGF-β isoforms to α2M neutralizes the activity of TGF-β toward various cells (12Crookston K.P. Webb D.J. Wolf B.B. Gonias S.L. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5101-5105PubMed Google Scholar), the immune system, and atherogenesis (18Roberts A. Sporn M. Sporn M. Roberts A. Peptide Growth Factors and Their Receptors.

Structural and functional evidence for several binding domains in different α2M forms led us to hypothesize that α2M modulates LCAT activity and concentration in plasma and may be involved in LCAT clearance via an LRP-mediated endocytic process. The physical association of LCAT and α2M has not been previously reported. The present study aims at providing evidence for the association of LCAT with α2M and to examine how these interactions could be affected by native and activated forms of α2M and by apolipoproteins known to bind LCAT. Cellular binding, internalization and degradation assays were used to evaluate the role of activated α2M and LRP receptor in mediating the clearance of LCAT by cells. Anti-human α2M monoclonal antibody, affinity-purified rabbit anti-goat IgG and affinity-purified goat anti-mouse IgG antibody were purchased from Biodesign International (Kennebunk, ME). Methylamine hydrochloride, phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C and sphingomyelinase were purchased from Sigma. Partially purified, anti-human α2M polyclonal antibody and anti-human IgG polyclonal antibody were purchased from ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Aurora, OH). HepG2 cells (HB-8065) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Anti-LCAT goat polyclonal antibody and purified human recombinant LCAT (rLCAT) were a gift from Dr. Henry Pownall, Baylor College of Medecine,s Houston, TX. C-terminal histidine-tagged human recombinant lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (hrLCATH6) was a gift from Dr John S. Parks, Wake Forest University School of Medecine, Winston-Salem, NC. Anti-LCAT monoclonal antibody 2H11 was generously provided by Dr. Ross Milne, University of Ottawa Heart Institute. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF1) that express LRP, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts genetically deficient in LRP (MEF2) were generously provided by Dr. Joachim Herz, Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. Blood samples were obtained after an overnight fast from male subjects with an apoE3/3 phenotype. Blood was drawn from an arm vein into evacuated tubes containing ethylenediamine-tetraacetate (EDTA, final concentration 1.5 mg/ml). Blood collection tubes were immediately placed in ice. Plasma was obtained by centrifugation (3,000 rpm, 15 min) and was kept in ice until electrophoretic separation, which was routinely carried out within 30 min of plasma isolation, or was frozen at −70 °C until analysis of lipids and apolipoproteins. Plasma samples were separated by two-dimensional, non-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis as described previously (20Krimbou L. Tremblay M. Jacques H. Davignon J. Cohn J.S. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Krimbou L. Tremblay M. Davignon J. Cohn J.S. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 35-48Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, only the α2M-containing pre-β2-migrating segment (∼2 cm) of agarose gels was separated in the second dimension. LCAT associated with α2M was isolated from human plasma by immunoprecipitation. Plasma (120–500 µl) was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 50–200 µl of anti-human α2M antibody or with control anti-human IgG antibody. The immunoprecipitates were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 6 min and washed three times with buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton, and 10% glycerol). They were analyzed by 4–22.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, together with molecular weight standards (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The presence of LCAT and α2M in immunoprecipitates was detected by immunoblotting. The efficiency of α2M immunoprecipitation was assessed as >95%, based on the absence of α2M in the supernatant. α2M-MA and LPL were iodinated using IODO-GEN® iodination reagent (1,3,4,6-tetrachloro-3α-6α-diphenylglycouracil, Pierce) (22Salacinski P.R. McLean C. Sykes J.E. Clement-Jones V.V. Lowry P.J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). rLCAT and hrLCATH6 were iodinated as described by Bolin and Jonas (23Bolin J. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7429-7434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Free iodine was removed by PD10 column chromatography. Iodinated proteins were dialyzed extensively at 4 °C against phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. These 125I-rLCAT preparations retained ∼85% of control acyltransferase activity with rHDL substrates. LCAT activity decreased slightly over time. No difference in the binding of125I-rLCAT to α2M was observed between125I-rLCAT preparations that retained 85% or 30% of control acyltransferase activity with rHDL substrates. Preparation of α2M-MA, α2M, and binding experiments were performed as previously described (7Krimbou L. Tremblay M. Davignon J. Cohn J.S. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 38: 2373-2386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The effect of various apolipoproteins and reconstituted HDL particles on the binding of rLCAT to α2M was determined by adding these substances (as specified for each experiment) to reaction tubes prior to the addition of 125I-rLCAT. In certain experiments, samples were treated with phospholipases or trypsin before addition of125I-rLCAT. Bound and unbound 125I-rLCAT was separated by non-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 2.5–18% at 60 V (16 h, 15 °C). No dissociation of 125I-rLCAT bound to α2M was detected with this electrophoretic system as assessed by reseparating electroeluted 125I-labeled rLCAT·α2M or 125I-labeled rLCAT·α2M-MA complexes. In experiments using125I-rLCAT, gels were dried and exposed at −70 °C to XAR-2 Kodak film for 4–72 h. Exposed films were used as a template to identify the position of appropriate bands for excision and counting. LCAT activity was measured as relative cholesterol esterification achieved during a 5-h incubation of plasma at 37 °C as described previously (21Krimbou L. Tremblay M. Davignon J. Cohn J.S. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 35-48Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The LCAT activity of the LCAT·α2M complex was assayed as described previously (24Marcil M. Boucher B. Krimbou L. Solymoss B.C. Davignon J. Frohlich J. Genest Jr., J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) but with minor modifications. The [3H]cholesterol-labeled r(LpA-I) substrate was prepared as previously described (25Matz C.E. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4535-4540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was diluted in buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaN3, and 0.01% EDTA) to give final apoA-I concentrations ranging from 10−7 to 10−6m. Each reaction mixture contained 50 µl of 30 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 50 µl of 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol in a final volume of 300 µl. Incubation was for 3 h at 37 °C. LCAT activity was determined as the amount of esterified cholesterol that was incorporated into apoA-I-containing proteoliposomes. LCAT mass was measured by the method of Qu et al. (26Qu S.J. Fan Z. Blanco-Vaca F. Pownall H.J. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 967-974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with purified LCAT as standard. 125I-rLCAT was incubated with α2M-MA at 2:1 molar ratio for 24 h at 37 °C. Radiolabeled rLCAT·α2M-MA complex was then separated from free 125I-rLCAT by 500-kDa exclusion filters and isolated from preparative non-denaturing gradient gels by electroelution. The integrity of the complex was evaluated by electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions on 3–15% gradient gels followed by autoradiography. HepG2 cells were cultured under standard conditions. Briefly, HepG2 cells (ATCC HB 8065) were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium with nonessential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, and 10% fetal bovine serum. After a 24-hour incubation, serum-free medium from HepG2 (3 ml) were collected in the presence of 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, concentrated by using Centricon filters (Amicon) to a final volume of 200 µl and separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF1) that express LRP and mouse embryonic fibroblasts genetically deficient in LRP (MEF2) were used. Cells were incubated with 125I-α2M-MA, 125I-rLCAT,125I-LPL and 125I-rLCAT·α2M-MA complex at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends. Cell-specific binding, association, and degradation were measured after 5-h incubations at 4 °C or 37 °C. Aliquots of culture medium were taken for degradation of radiolabeled ligand by measurement of non-iodide 125I (soluble in 10% trichloroacetic acid) as previously described (27Goldstein J.L. Basu S.B. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). Cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were determined enzymatically on an autoanalyzer (Cobas Mira, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). HDL-cholesterol concentration was determined by measuring cholesterol in the supernatant after heparin-manganese precipitation of apoB-containing lipoproteins in thed > 1.006 g/ml fraction of plasma prepared by ultracentrifugation where d is density. Plasma apoB and apoA-I concentrations were measured by nephelometry (Behring Nephelometer 100 Analyzer). ApoE phenotypes were determined by immunoblotting of plasma separated by minigel electrophoresis (28Hill J.S. Pritchard P.H. Clin. Chem. 1990; 36: 1871-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Low density lipoprotein (LDL) (1.019 < d < 1.063) and HDL3 (1.125 < d < 1.21 g/ml) were isolated from normolipidemic plasma by sequential ultracentrifugation using a Beckman ultracentrifuge. The total HDL fraction was isolated from plasma by automated gel filtration chromatography (FPLC). We used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to separate plasma apolipoprotein complexes in the HDL size range (Fig.1A). LCAT protein co-migrated in approximately equal proportions with α-HDL and α2M plasma protein. LCAT was consistently found to co-migrate with plasma α2M protein, having a molecular diameter of 18.5 nm. (Fig. 1 A, right panel), detected with125I-labeled anti-α2M monoclonal antibody. LCAT migrated in the same position as α2M (Fig.1 A, left panel). LCAT associated with α2M was also detected in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in the medium of cultured HepG2 (Fig. 1 B). Most of the LCAT in CSF and secreted by HepG2 cells was associated with α2M and had an apparent diameter of 18.5 nm, as was the case for LCAT·α2M in the plasma. α-LCAT species present in CSF and the medium of cultured HepG2 were smaller than α-LCAT in human plasma. The control sample in this experiment (Fig.1 B, right panel) was purified plasma α2M, which contained bound LCAT. To provide evidence for a direct association of LCAT with α2M, we used a purified anti-α2M IgG fraction to immunoprecipitate α2M from the plasma of three normolipidemic subjects. The amount of LCAT associated with α2M immunoprecipitate was assessed by immunodetection of LCAT and α2M (Fig.2A, upper panel) after separation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Inlane a the nonspecific IgG immunoprecipitation revealed one IgG band detected by the second antibody used in the LCAT detection.Lanes b, c, and d demonstrate, in addition, an LCAT band with molecular mass of ∼66 kDA. The absence and presence of α2M in respective samples are shown in the (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). Removal of α2M from plasma by affinity chromatography reduced most of the LCAT associated with α2M but not α-migrating LCAT (data not shown). The amount of plasma LCAT associated with α2M was estimated to be ∼40% of total plasma LCAT in the HDL size range (see later, Fig. 6A).Figure 6Distribution of plasma LCAT within the HDL size range (A), cholesterol esterification between lipoproteins in vitro in the presence and absence of LCAT·α2M complex (B), and measurement of LCAT activity in purified LCAT·α2M complex (C). A, after two-dimensional electrophoresis and transfer of proteins to a nitrocellulose membrane as in Fig. 1, LCAT was detected by anti-LCAT monoclonal antibody. Individually labeled membrane areas were excised and identified using the autoradiograph as template and their radioactivity were determined in a γ-radiation spectrometer. Values given are means ± S.D. of five different experiments. Radioactivity in the α-migrating HDL region is the sum of that in the multiple punctate reaction areas.B, α2M-depleted plasma or IgG-depleted plasma (200 µl) were tested for their capacity to esterify cholesterol. Cholesterol esterification was expressed as the difference in esterified form before and after incubation of plasma. C,LCAT activity of purified native commercial α2M(C), α2M-MA(C), purified α2M(P) from fresh plasma, and IgG-depleted plasma HDL fraction isolated by FPLC (1 µg LCAT protein) was measured.

Lane a of theleft panel of Fig. 2 B shows that a significant amount of LCAT was immunodetectable in commercial α2M separated, in this case, by non-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis; the complex had an apparent diameter of 18.5 nm. The specificity of anti-LCAT antibody was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions followed by immunodetection of LCAT in commercial preparations of α2M. LCAT was present with molecular masses of 66 kDa, as shown inlanes a and b of Fig. 2 C. In this experiment purified rLCAT was used as control, lane c. The difference in apparent molecular mass between plasma LCAT dissociated from native purified α2M and rLCAT (Fig. 2 C) was because of different degrees of glycosylation as previously reported (29Chisholm J.W. Gebre A.K. Parks J.S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1512-1519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Methylamine activation of commercial α2M did not dissociate LCAT from α2M, as shown by the similar amount of LCAT associated with α2M under non-denaturing conditions (Fig. 2 B, lanes a and b,respectively). Under non-reducing conditions, SDS gel electrophoresis caused a part of LCAT to dissociate from commercial α2M, as shown in lane a of Fig. 2 C. LCAT·α2M complex was resistant to boiling in the presence of SDS. In addition, the in vitro formation of125I-rLCAT·α2M was not inhibited by iodoacetic acid, indicating that free sulfhydryl groups are not required for complex formation, providing evidence for the non-covalent association of LCAT with α2M (data not shown). The binding of LCAT to activated (α2M-MA) and native α2M was investigated in vitro by incubation of125I-rLCAT at 37 °C with different concentrations of α2M for various times. Bound and unbound125I-rLCAT were separated by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis, and 125I-rLCAT was quantified by direct scintillation counting. LCAT binding was found to occur in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Maximum binding was reached after 6 h for both α2M and α2M-MA and remained constant for the remaining 18 h of the experiment (data not shown). α2M-MA had a 2-fold greater capacity to bind LCAT relative to α2M (Fig.3, upper and left panels). The affinity of LCAT binding to both forms of α2M was assessed from a double-reciprocal plot of the concentration-dependent binding data (right panel). Dissociation constants (K D) calculated from the slope of the regression lines were 3.93 and 1.9 µm for the nonactivated and activated forms of α2M, respectively, indicating that LCAT had a greater affinity to bind to α2M-MA than to α2M. We have previously reported that phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC) activate native α2M (7Krimbou L. Tremblay M. Davignon J. Cohn J.S. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 38: 2373-2386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). To verify that LCAT does not bind to α2M through its well characterized proteinase-trapping mechanism, we determined whether the conformation of native α2M could be affected by LCAT treatment. Native α2M isolated by metal chelate chromatography (having detectable quantities of bound LCAT (Fig.2 B, lane a)) was incubated for 12 h at 37 °C with sphingomyelinase (SM-ase), PC-PLC, or rLCAT. α2M-MA and trypsin-α2M (α2M-T) were used as activated forms of α2M in this experiment. PC-PLC (but not SM-ase or rLCAT) caused α2M to become “activated” (as evidenced by the smaller size and increased mobility of α2M separated by nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) as shown (Fig.4). To verify that the association of LCAT does not depend on the presence of lipid, we investigated whether the binding of 125I-rLCAT could be prevented by prior treatment of α2M with phospholipases (sphingomyelinase and phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C) or delipidating solvents. No decrease was observed in the binding of 125I-rLCAT to native α2M (data not shown). We next investigated whether HDL particles would affect the association of LCAT with native α2M. Native α2M (50 µg) was incubated with increasing amounts of reconstituted HDL, r(LpA-I), or native HDL3 (Fig.5). 50 µg of r(LpA-I) or HDL3 inhibited the association of LCAT with native α2M by 50 and 30% respectively. At all concentrations used in this experiment, r(LpA-I) particles were more efficient inhibitors than native HDL3. We measured the ability of LCAT·α2M complex to esterify cholesterol in vitro by examining the effect of removing the LCAT·α2M complex from plasma by immunoprecipitation of α2M using a purified anti-α2M IgG fraction and nonspecific anti-human IgG. The fractional esterification rate of cholesterol in plasma was the same in α2M-depleted plasma samples as in IgG-depleted plasma samples (Fig.6 B). As ∼40% of the plasma LCAT was associated with α2M (Fig. 6 A), this result shows that LCAT associated with α2M in plasma is inactive in the esterification of cholesterol. To investigate this observation further, we assayed for LCAT activity using a proteoliposome substrate. The same amount of LCAT (1 µg) present in commercial α2M preparation (native α2M and α2M-MA), purified plasma α2M (isolated by ultracentrifugation (d > 1.25) and separated from others plasma proteins by FPLC, thus reducing the possibility of inactivating LCAT by the purification process) and the IgG-depleted HDL fraction (isolated by FPLC) was tested for LCAT activity. Under these conditions, there was no significant LCAT activity in either conformation of commercial and purified plasma α2M in contrast to the activity associated to HDL fraction (Fig.6 C). To evaluate the ability of 125I-rLCAT·α2M complex to interact with the LRP receptor, we combined125I-rLCAT with unlabeled α2M-MA, and the resulting complex was purified. The inset of Fig. 8, shows gel electrophoretic separation of free 125I-rLCAT (lane a) and 125I-rLCAT·α2M-MA complex (lane b). Equivalent amounts of125I-α2M-MA,125I-rLCAT·α2M-MA, 125I-rLCAT, and 125I-LPL were incubated with LRP-expressing cells LRP (+/+) and control cells that did not express LRP (−/−) at 4 °C for 5 h, and the levels of specific binding were measured. As shown in Fig. 7B, incubation with cells expressing the LRP receptor resulted in the binding of125I-rLCAT·α2M-MA complex, but cells deficient in this receptor (MEF2, LRP −/−) were unable to bind significant amounts of 125I-rLCAT·α2M-MA complex. In separate experiments (Fig. 7 A) we have confirmed the absence of LRP from MEF2 (LRP −/−) cells by measuring the specific binding of 125I-α2M-MA.Figure 7Cells expressing LRP receptor bind125I-rLCAT·α2M-MA complex.MEF1 (LRP+/+) or MEF2 (LRP −/−) cells were incubated for 5 h at 4 °C with either 125I-α2M-MA (2 µg/ml, 6000–7000 cpm/ng) as shown in A, purified125I-rLCAT·α2M-MA complex (4 µg/ml, 4500–5000 cpm/ng) as shown in B, purified125I-rLCAT (1 µg/ml, 14000 cpm/ng) as shown inC, and purified 125I-LPL (0.5 µg/ml, 5000 cpm/ng) as shown in D. To determine the specific binding, the following unlabeled competitors concentration were used: α2M-MA, 150 µg; rLCAT, 50 µg; and LPL, 20 µg. Plotted values are means ± S.D. of triplicate values. One experiment, representative of three, is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether 125I-rLCAT alone might interact with LRP-receptor, we added equivalents amount of 125I-rLCAT to cultured MEF1 (LRP+/+) and control MEF2 (LRP−/−), and the level of specific binding was measured. As shown in Fig. 7 C, minimal LCAT binding to LRP +/+ and LRP −/− cells is observed. The control protein in this experiments was purified LPL, which bind to LRP +/+ but not significantly to LRP −/− (Fig. 7 D). To evaluate the ability of125I-rLCAT·α2M-MA complex to interact with the LRP receptor, equivalent amounts of125I-rLCAT·α2M-MA were incubated with LRP (+/+) and control LRP (−/−) cells, and the level of cell association and degradation of this complex was measured. As shown in Fig.8, incubation with cells expressing the LRP receptor resulted in the internalization and degradation of the complex, but cells deficient in this receptor (LRP −/−) were unable to internalize or degrade significant amounts of125I-rLCAT· α2M-MA complex. We have shown that LCAT, co-migrates with α2M in human plasma in an intermediate-sized complex (18.5 nm in diameter) between LDL and HDL lipoproteins (Fig. 1 A). Plasma LCAT associated with α2M could be specifically immunoprecipitated using antibodies directed against α2M. Another experiment demonstrated that purified native α2M (isolated by metal-chelate chromatography) consistently contained detectable amounts of LCAT (Fig. 2 B). LCAT became bound to α2M in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.3). Such binding does not depend on the presence of lipid molecules and, for LCAT, is apparently noncovalent (Fig. 2 C,right panel, lane a). LCAT may be recognizing a protein motif, such as an amphipathic α-helix, that is common to apolipoproteins and α2M and is independent of lipid content. The association of LCAT with apolipoprotein complexes may thus be due to direct protein-protein interaction, suggesting that LCAT binding and activation by apolipoprotein are independent events. It was documented that the association of LCAT to lipoprotein surfaces essentially was independent of their composition (31Jin L. Shieh J.J. Grabbe E. Adimmolam S. Durbin D. Jonas A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15659-15665Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We have previously shown (7Krimbou L. Tremblay M. Davignon J. Cohn J.S. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 38: 2373-2386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar) that the binding of apoE to α2M depends on the apoE phenotype. Charge or conformational differences in LCAT mutants might similarly affect their binding to α2M species in plasma. Adimoolam etal. (32Adimoolam S. Jin L. Grabbe E. Shieh J.J. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32561-32567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) have shown that two naturally occurring mutants of human LCAT, T123I and N228K, expressed in COS-1 cells, bind to a lipoprotein particle (rHDL) with about half the affinity of wild-type LCAT. Again, activated α2M-MA binds two times as much LCAT as native α2M (Fig. 3), and various cytokines and growth factors (e.g. TGF-β1, NGF-β, PDGF, bFGF, and TNF-α) also bind to α2M-MA with greater affinity than to native α2M (12Crookston K.P. Webb D.J. Wolf B.B. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LCAT shares several sequence regions with other lipases (33McLean J. Fielding C.J. Drayna D. Dieplinger H. Baer B. Kohr W. Henzel W. Lawn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2335-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C activates α2M (7Krimbou L. Tremblay M. Davignon J. Cohn J.S. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 38: 2373-2386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar), but rLCAT does not (Fig. 4). This suggests that LCAT does not bind to α2M through its well characterized proteinase-trapping mechanism (34Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11539-11542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding studies shown in Fig. 3 predict that LCAT bound with low affinity to native α2M may dissociate from the complex in the presence of LpA-I particles. We postulate that native discoidal HDL particles affect the availability of active LCAT, which is crucial for their maturation, by modulating its dynamic distribution between α-migrating HDL and α2M. When 125I-labeled rLCAT was incubated with α2M in the presence of a 4-fold excess of r(LpA-I) over α2M, the association of rLCAT with α2M was almost completely inhibited. Actually, r(LpA-I) inhibited the binding of 125I-rLCAT with α2M more efficiently than did native HDL3(Fig. 5). Studies by Adimoolam et al. have documented that normal LCAT dissociates from rHDL after one catalytic cycle (32Adimoolam S. Jin L. Grabbe E. Shieh J.J. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32561-32567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It is possible that the fraction of LCAT bound preferentially to α2M reflects a catabolic compartment. We may say that an important proportion of HDL-sized LCAT (40%) is sequestered into in an inactive pool by α2M, which does not react with cholesterol of lipoprotein origin (Fig. 6) and leads to the concept that plasma α2M inhibits the enzymatic activity of LCAT. It is not possible to use a water-soluble substrate such asp-nitrophenylvalerate to provide evidence that the LCAT associated with α2M is catalytically active; the latter being a substrate for serine proteases and esterases, it might also interact with chymotrypsine (30Bonelli F.S. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264 (,): 14723-14728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which binds to native purified α2M. LCAT with low activity has been demonstrated in CSF (35Illingworth D.R. Glover J. Biochim..Biophys. Acta. 1970; 220: 610-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). LCAT may be synthesized in the brain (36Smith K.M. Lawn R.M. Wilcox J.N. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 995-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Collet et al. (37Collet X. Francone O. Besnard F. Fielding C.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) reported that cultured nerve cells secreted a functional LCAT protein. The present study shows that most of the LCAT in CSF was associated with α2M (Fig. 1 B). Although the functional significance of LCAT binding to α2M in CSF remains to be determined, this complex may be involved in mediating the clearance of LCAT by the LRP receptor in the brain. One can also speculate that native α2M could be involved in the stabilization, the decreased plasma clearance, and the resistance of plasma LCAT to proteinase cleavage. Indeed, we have observed that significant amounts of rLCAT resisted trypsin digestion when bound to α2M, whereas unbound rLCAT was readily degraded (data not shown). The results presented in this study provide direct evidence that LRP is a receptor for the LCAT·α2M-MA complex (Figs. 7 and 8), thus indicating that it could mediate LCAT·α2M-MA binding, endocytosis, and degradation in any tissue that expresses LRP. This work provides evidence for the first time that the LRP receptor may play an important role in the catabolism of LCAT. Further study of the interaction between LCAT and α2M may provide new insights into plasma factors affecting HDL particles remodeling, the mechanism of reverse cholesterol transport, and the clearance of LCAT via an α2M/LRP receptor that is dependent on the conformation of α2M in vivo.

Thus, alternative use of exon 2 is a mechanism for regulating ligand interactions with L1. base pair(s) wild type fluorescence-activated cell sorter Neural cell adhesion molecule L1 is one member of a subfamily of immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily proteins that acts as a cellular and axonal guidance cue and receptor during nervous system development. L1 is expressed primarily on the surface of axons and growth cones of developing neurons and is thought to have a role in neuronal cell migration, fasciculation, axon growth, and guidance (1Brümmendorf T. Kenwrick S. Rathjen F.G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Mutations in the L1 gene are responsible for a congenital neurological disorder in humans (X-linked hydrocephalus, mental retardation, aphasia, shuffling gait, and adducted thumbs (MASA) syndrome, or spastic paraplegia type I). Clinical signs of this disease include hydrocephalus, mental retardation, adducted thumbs, and lower limb spasticity. Abnormalities of corpus callosum and corticospinal tract development in patients and L1 knockout mice indicate a pivotal role for L1 in the growth or guidance of these particular axon tracts. L1-deficient mice also show reduced interaction between Schwann cells and the axons of unmyelinated sensory nerves, resulting in degeneration of axons and impaired sensory function. Thus L1 may also be a neuronal receptor for survival cues provided by glial cells. Outside the nervous system L1 is expressed on subsets of cells including B-lymphocytes, cells of the intestinal crypt, and kidney epithelial cells. L1 is clearly required for normal kidney morphogenesis, but specific roles in the intestine and immune system have not yet been defined (reviewed in Ref. 2Kenwrick S. Watkins A. De Angelis E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 879-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The L1 glycoprotein comprises six Ig-like domains and five fibronectin type III repeats in the extracellular region, a single pass transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail. Through its extracellular domains L1 can interact with a variety of ligands. Determining which interactions are important for the development or function of the nervous system or other tissues is fundamental to understanding the complex biology of L1. Homophilic interaction is likely to be an important mediator of neurite outgrowth in nervous system development, because explanted neurons will extend neurites on an L1 substrate only if L1 is present as a receptor. However, interactions with other proteins on the same membrane or in trans are likely to be involved in L1 function. For example, when dorsal root ganglion cells extend neurites on an NgCAM substrate (the chick homologue of L1), cell surface NgCAM recruits axonin-1, another Ig superfamily member, in a receptor complex (3Buchstaller A. Kunz S. Berger P. Kunz B. Ziegler U. Rader C. Sonderegger P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1593-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Thus L1 is likely to be a dynamic receptor with multiple binding mechanisms and functions. The factors that regulate L1 interactions in different cell types are not understood. A major difference between L1 present in neurons and in most other cell types is dictated by alternative splicing of L1 pre-mRNA (4Reid R.A. Hemperly J.J. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1992; 3: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 5Jouet M. Rosenthal A. Kenwrick S. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 30: 378-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). L1 has 29 exons, 28 of which are coding (here designated 1b-28) and one that contains an 5′-untranslated sequence (exon 1a). Neurons utilize the entire 28-exon coding sequence (6Takeda Y. Asou H. Murakami Y. Miura M. Kobayashi M. Uyemura K. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 2338-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In contrast, mRNA that lacks exons 2 and 27 is exclusive to nonneuronal cells, although oligodendrocytes have been found to express both isoforms in a maturation-dependent manner (7Itoh K. Sakurai Y. Asou H. Umeda M. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 60: 579-586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Exon 2 nonsense or frameshift mutations have been found in patients with X-linked hydrocephalus, in keeping with the observation that all neuronal transcripts are of this form. Differential use of exons 2 and 27 in neuronal versus nonneuronal cells is conserved for L1 orthologues in rodents (5Jouet M. Rosenthal A. Kenwrick S. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 30: 378-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 8Miura M. Kobayashi M. Asou H. Uyemura K.

Rosenthal A. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 208: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), suggesting that it has functional importance. Exon 27 encodes a 4-amino acid peptide, RSLE, that is part of a cytoplasmic tyrosine-based sorting motif, YRSL. Studies by Kamiguchiet al. (10Kamiguchi H. Long K.E. Pendergast M. Schaefer A.W. Rapoport I. Kirchhausen T. Lemmon V. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5311-5321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kamiguchi H. Lemmon V. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3749-3756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that indeed this motif is required for the recycling of L1 by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The inclusion of exon 2 in L1 mRNA provides a 6-amino acid motif (YEGHHV) in place of a single leucine residue prior to the first Ig domain (Fig. 1). The function of this motif is, however, largely unexplored. We have examined the influence of the exon 2 motif on L1 trafficking in neuronal cells and on the ability of L1 to bind to itself and two other Ig superfamily ligands found primarily in the nervous system, TAX-1 (rodent TAG-1/chick axonin-1) and contactin (rodent F3/chick F11). We find that inclusion of the exon 2-encoded motif is not required for the correct trafficking of L1 in neuronal cells but is required for efficient binding to all three ligands. Similarly reduced binding has been found for patient mutations that cause X-linked hydrocephalus (12De Angelis E. MacFarlane J. Du J.S. Yeo G. Hicks R. Rathjen F.G. Kenwrick S. Brümmendorf T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4744-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), indicating that exon 2-encoded residues are required for the neuronal function of L1. Furthermore, this suggests that distinct functions of L1 in neuronal and nonneuronal tissues could be mediated by differences in binding preferences. L1 cDNA without the 15-bp1 sequence encoded by exon 2 was created by polymerase chain reaction-directed mutagenesis (12De Angelis E. MacFarlane J. Du J.S. Yeo G. Hicks R. Rathjen F.G. Kenwrick S. Brümmendorf T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4744-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and BIO-X-ACT™ (Bioline) proofreading polymerase. In a first-round reaction, an antisense primer containing the junction sequence of exon 2-minus cDNA (5′-TGACAGGTGGCTCCATCA/ATTCCTCGGGGATCTGGA-3′) was used with a primer designed from pBluescript (V1, 5′-CATCAAAGGGAACAAAAGCTGGAG-3′) to amplify L1 sequences from a pBluescript clone containing the full 3.9-kilobase L1 cDNA (pBS-L1, a gift from John Hemperly). The 189-bp product was used as a megaprimer in a second-round reaction with a downstream antisense primer (5′-ATGGCTCTGGGGCTTGTGCAG-3′). The 1111-bp product was digested with EcoRI andSphI, and the resultant 980-bp fragment was substituted for the wild-type EcoRI/SphI section of L1 cDNA. The mutated cassette was sequenced using the Prism™ dye terminator kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and an ABI 373 semi-automated DNA sequencer. The individual amino acid residues of exon 2 were sequentially substituted with an alanine residue using a similar method. First-round reactions utilized a sense mutagenic primer containing the altered bases with antisense primer L9 (5′-CCGTTCTGGCCCATCGTCAC-3′) to produce a 490–505-bp megaprimer from wild-type pBS-L1 template. An aliquot of megaprimer was then used with a sense-flanking primer ER1 (5′-CCGAATTCCGGCGCCGGGAAAGAT-3′) in a second-round polymerase chain reaction producing a 596-bp L1 fragment containing the mutation. This was digested with EcoRI and BglII restriction enzymes and substituted for the equivalent region in pBS-L1. The clones were sequenced across the mutated cassettes. The mutagenic primers (with the mutations highlighted in bold) were: Y26Amp (CCCGAGGAAGCCGAAGGACAC), E27Amp (GAGGAATATGCCGGACACCAT), G28Amp (GAATATGAAGCCCACCATGTG), H29Amp (TATGAAGGAGCCCATGTGATG), H30Amp (GAAGGACACGCCGTGATGGAG), and V31Amp (GGACACCATGCCATGGAGCCA). Constructs containing sequences encoding the extracellular portions of human L1, mouse F3 (the mouse orthologue of chick F11 and human contactin), or human TAX-1 (the orthologue of chick axonin-1 and mouse TAG-1) in conjunction with sequences encoding human IgG Fc domains were used to produce soluble chimeric proteins. The L1-Fc construct was described by De Angelis et al. (12De Angelis E. MacFarlane J. Du J.S. Yeo G. Hicks R. Rathjen F.G. Kenwrick S. Brümmendorf T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4744-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The F3-Fc construct was a gift from C. Faivre-Sarrailh and G. Rougon (CNRS, France). The TAX-Fc clone was constructed by engineering the extracellular portion of human TAX-1 cDNA into pIgplus (Invitrogen). The primers TH3F (5′-CTGGACTTTCTCAAGCTCTAGTC-3′) and THXE (5′-GCCATGATATCCACCATCATTCTAGAGCCTCCATTCCT-3′) were used to amplify a 252-bp polymerase chain reaction product from a human full-length TAX-1 clone (a gift from P. Sonderegger, Switzerland). This introduced an XbaI restriction enzyme site immediately prior to the glycophosphatidylinositol-linkage sequence. This fragment was cut with BstB1 andXbaI and used in a three-way ligation with a 2.8-kilobaseHindIII/BstBI fragment of TAX-1 cDNA corresponding to the upstream coding sequence andHindIII/XbaI-cut pIgplus. TheBstBI/XbaI cassette and cloning sites were sequenced. Soluble L1-Fc (mutated and wild type), TAX-Fc, and F3-Fc chimeric proteins were produced by transiently transfecting COS-7 cells with 10 µg of DNA/150-mm culture dish. The soluble Fc chimeric protein was allowed to accumulate in the medium for 6 days and was recovered and purified by Protein A-Sepharose affinity chromatography as described by De Angelis et al. (12De Angelis E. MacFarlane J. Du J.S. Yeo G. Hicks R. Rathjen F.G. Kenwrick S. Brümmendorf T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4744-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The homophilic binding assay was conducted according to the method described by De Angelis et al. (12De Angelis E. MacFarlane J. Du J.S. Yeo G. Hicks R. Rathjen F.G. Kenwrick S. Brümmendorf T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4744-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Bioclean fluorescent microsphere beads (Red, 0.6 µm, Duke Scientific Corp.) were precoated with anti-human IgG antibody (Fc-specific, Sigma, I-2136). Briefly, 250 µl of fluorescent beads were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 50 µl of antibody and 700 µl of PBS. The beads were then washed with PBS/5% fetal calf serum, incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and stored in 250 µl of PBS/0.02% azide. The same batch of antibody-coated beads was used throughout the study. 2.5 µg of L1 mutant or wild-type Fc protein was conjugated to 10 µl of antibody-coated beads by incubating for 2 h at 37 °C. Excess unbound protein was removed by washing with PBS/5% fetal calf serum, and the beads were resuspended in 60 µl of PBS/5% fetal calf serum. For the homophilic binding assay, L1-Fc-coated beads were disaggregated to a single bead suspension by trituration followed by a 30-min incubation in an iced water bath sonicator. Homophilic aggregation was allowed to occur by incubating the single bead suspension at 37 °C with samples removed in duplicate over a 30-min time course. Samples were diluted 1:5000 times in ice-cold PBS and analyzed using a Becton Dickinson FACSort. 10,000 particles were sampled for each time point, and the number of particles with single bead fluorescence levels was measured in comparison to the number of particles with multiple bead fluorescence levels (clustered particles). Each Fc protein was assayed at least three times in parallel with WT to control for variation between experiments and standardized to a WT binding curve. As a control to ensure that equivalent concentrations of the Fc chimeric proteins were captured by the antibody-coated beads, 30-µl samples of coated beads were denatured at 95 °C in sample buffer, and the released Fc chimeric proteins were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and shown to be present in equal proportions (12De Angelis E. MacFarlane J. Du J.S. Yeo G. Hicks R. Rathjen F.G. Kenwrick S. Brümmendorf T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4744-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). No unbound Fc protein was detected under assay conditions as assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A two-color aggregation assay was developed using red and green fluorescent microsphere beads. Microspheres were coated with anti-human IgG antibody and conjugated with either L1 or exon 2-minus L1 as described above. The protein-conjugated microspheres were disaggregated to produce single bead suspensions by trituration. A 1:1 mixture of red (WT-L1) and green (exon 2-minus L1) protein-conjugated beads was then prepared and further disaggregated by sonicating in an iced bath for 30 min. To allow mixed bead aggregation to occur, the beads were incubated at 37 °C with samples removed over a 30-min time course and diluted 1:5000 times in ice-cold PBS. 10,000 particles/sample were analyzed by FACS analysis. The number of two-color aggregates was quantified and compared with the number of mixed aggregates obtained when wild-type L1 was coated onto both red and green beads or when exon 2-minus L1 was coated onto both red and green beads. Bioclean fluorescent microspheres were coated with anti-human IgG as described above and saturated with TAX-Fc or F3-Fc fusion proteins. Binding of the protein-conjugated beads to L1-transfected COS cells was conducted as described by Brümmendorf et al. (13Brümmendorf T. Hubert M. Treubert U. Leuschner R. Tarnok A. Rathjen F.G. Neuron. 1993; 10: 711-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) with the exception that cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/1% fetal calf serum before bead incubation and fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature before staining with polyclonal antibodies. COS cells are heterogeneous with respect to size, form, surface properties, and expression levels of heterologously expressed proteins; therefore, large numbers of cells have to be evaluated to quantify bead binding. An image analysis system described in detail previously (14Treubert U. Brümmendorf T. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1795-1805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was adapted to quantify bead binding. Cells forming uninterrupted confluent monolayers were selected, and the integrity of the cells was monitored with monoclonal antibody 412, which is specific for the intracellular large T antigen, expressed by COS cells (15Deppert W. Gurney E.G. Harrison R.O. J. Virol. 1981; 37: 478-482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After bead incubation, the cell monolayer was washed and fixed; L1-expressing cells (representing 10–50% of cells in the confluent monolayer) were identified by immunofluorescence analysis using L1-specific polyclonal antibodies (16Wolff J.M. Frank R. Mujoo K. Spiro R.C. Reisfeld R.A. Rathjen F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11943-11947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Images were captured separately for L1-expressing cells (Cy3-fluorochrome, red fluorescence) and beads (yellow fluorescence). L1-expressing cells were identified automatically and distinguished from untransfected cells by a fluorescence intensity threshold. Fluorescent beads were identified using size-exclusion criteria and intensity threshold. An automated comparison of each cell image with its corresponding bead image allowed the calculation of bead density on L1-expressing cells and background density on untransfected cells. Background binding, which was below 5% of WT L1 binding, was subtracted. Five independent analyses were performed for each combination of ligand and L1 variant, and in each analysis at least 200 transfected cells were evaluated. The data sets were compared with the Mann-Whitney U test implemented in the Statview program (Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkeley, CA). For transfection of cerebellar granule cells, 10 µg of DNA diluted in 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was added to 30 µl of TransFast transfection reagent (1 mg/ml) (Promega) and incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. Meanwhile, the cerebellum was dissected from P8 mice, dissociated in trypsin, and triturated in DNase solution. Dissociated cells were centrifuged and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium to a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml. 1 ml of cell suspension was added to the TransFast/DNA mix, plated onto poly-l-lysine and laminin-coated coverslips, and incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. They were washed and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mmglutamine, and 5 mm KCl at 37 °C for 3 days prior to immunofluorescent labeling. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and labeled with rabbit anti-human L1 polyclonal antibody (1:1000) for 1 h and goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody (1:300) for 1 h. The coverslips were mounted onto slides with the Slowfade Antifade kit (Molecular Probes). Because the exon 2-minus L1 mRNA is not found in neurons, we investigated the possibility that inclusion of the exon 2-encoded motif is required to ensure correct trafficking of L1 along neuronal processes. Exon 2-minus L1 was transfected into mouse cerebellar granule cells, and the expression pattern was compared with that of full-length protein (Fig. 2). Exon 2-minus L1 was expressed on the cell body and along neurites of the cerebellar granule cells in an identical pattern to full-length L1. The transfection efficiency of cerebellar granule cells was ∼5%, and the experiment was repeated three times with similar results obtained. Similar results were also obtained using chick dorsal root ganglion cells. 2L. Cheng, unpublished data. To investigate whether the alternative splicing of exon 2 has an influence on cell surface interactions, binding assays were conducted for three ligands, L1 and glycophosphatidylinositol-linked Ig superfamily members TAX-1 and F3, for the following reasons. Homophilic binding by L1 is essential for promoting neurite outgrowth in response to immobilized or soluble L1 for several different types of neuron inin vitro assays (reviewed in Ref. 17Kamiguchi H. Lemmon V. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and is therefore likely to be an important mediator of axon growth in vivo. Studies using chick neurons indicate that this may depend on cooperation between L1 and TAX-1 on the neuronal surface (3Buchstaller A. Kunz S. Berger P. Kunz B. Ziegler U. Rader C. Sonderegger P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1593-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). F3 was included, because it is a paralog of TAX-1 and may therefore function in a similar fashion. Moreover, several pathogenic missense mutations reduce binding to one or more of these ligands (12De Angelis E. MacFarlane J. Du J.S. Yeo G. Hicks R. Rathjen F.G. Kenwrick S. Brümmendorf T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4744-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To compare homophilic binding of the peripheral (exon 2-minus) and neuronal (WT)-encoded forms of L1, fluorescent bead aggregation assays were used. WT-L1 or exon 2-minus L1-Fc was coated onto antibody-conjugated fluorescent beads and allowed to aggregate with samples removed between 0 and 30 min. The level of fluorescence associated with single particles compared with clustered particles was quantified by FACS analysis, in which the percentage of clustering reflects the percentage of homophilic binding. A time course of aggregation is shown in Fig.3A. The exon 2-minus isoform of L1 has significantly reduced binding (63% of WT after 30 min), suggesting that the YEGHHV motif may be involved directly or indirectly in homophilic adhesion (Fig. 3, A and B). Binding of anti-Fc-coated beads only is ∼4% of WT; therefore the antibody does not contribute to binding (12De Angelis E. MacFarlane J. Du J.S. Yeo G. Hicks R. Rathjen F.G. Kenwrick S. Brümmendorf T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4744-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A two-color fluorescent bead aggregation assay was used to investigate the interaction of WT-L1 with exon 2-minus L1. To examine this interaction, a two-channel FACS detection system was used to quantify the proportion of beads that formed mixed aggregates of L1 and exon 2-minus L1. The binding of WT-L1 to exon 2-minus L1 (81% of WT after 30 min) was greater than the binding of exon 2-minus L1 only (60% of WT after 30 min), suggesting WT-L1 partially rescued the loss of homophilic binding shown by exon 2-minus L1 (Fig. 3 D). To investigate whether the YEGHHV motif as a whole or individual amino acids are required for homophilic binding, single residues of this segment were replaced by alanine (Y26A, E27A, G28A, H29A, H30A, and V31A). Chimeric L1-Fc proteins were produced for each individual alanine substitution, and homophilic binding was assessed. All six mutated proteins exhibited wild-type levels of binding. Therefore, it is unlikely that an individual residue within the motif is required as part of a homophilic binding site (Fig. 3 C) For analysis of heterophilic interactions, we compared the binding of TAX-Fc and F3-Fc to full-length (WT) L1 with binding to L1 lacking the exon 2-encoded protein sequence. L1 protein was expressed at the surface of transiently transfected COS cells, and the binding of fluorescent microspheres coated with TAX-Fc or F3-Fc was quantified. To achieve this, digital image analysis procedures were used to evaluate more than 1000 transfected cells for each experimental condition. These analyses demonstrate that the absence of exon 2 compromises binding of heterophilic ligands by 40 or 60% for F3-Fc (p < 0.05) and TAX-1-Fc (p < 0.05), respectively. Thus, the YEGHHV motif may also be directly or indirectly involved in heterophilic interactions (Fig. 4,A and B). Quantification of bead binding to L1 mutant proteins revealed no significant effects of the alanine substitutions E27A, G28A, H29A, H30A, and V31A on both heterophilic interactions. However, substitution Y26A led to a reduced binding of TAX-Fc (p < 0.05) but did not interfere with F3-Fc binding. This suggests that Y26A may have a more direct role in the binding of TAX-1 by L1 and argues for a difference in binding requirements for the two closely related ligands. Neural cell adhesion molecule L1 exists as two isoforms that have distinct tissue distributions. Neuronal L1 is full-length, whereas other cell types express L1 that lacks residues encoded by alternatively spliced exons 2 and 27. Here we show that exon 2-encoded sequences influence the ability of L1 to bind biologically important ligands in vitro. Exon 2-encoded sequences are not required for the movement of L1 along neuronal processes in culture. This is not surprising, because apart from the signal peptide, sorting signals usually reside in cytoplasmic regions. However, YEGHHV exclusion significantly reduces binding of L1 to itself and two heterophilic ligands, namely TAX-1/TAG-1/axonin-1 and contactin/F3/F11. The involvement of individual L1 (or NgCAM) domains in homophilic binding or interaction with orthologues of TAX-1 and F3 has been examined using domain-deletion studies and by examining the effects of patient mutations (12De Angelis E. MacFarlane J. Du J.S. Yeo G. Hicks R. Rathjen F.G. Kenwrick S. Brümmendorf T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4744-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 18Kunz S. Spirig M. Ginsburg C. Buchstaller A. Berger P. Lanz R. Rader C. Vogt L. Kunz B. Sonderegger P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1673-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 19Haspel J. Friedlander D.R. Ivgy-May N. Chickramane S. Roonprapunt C. Chen S. Schachner M. Grumet M. J. Neurobiol. 2000; 42: 287-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that at least the first four Ig domains are required for all three types of interaction. In light of our results, a model for L1 interaction with these ligands must now incorporate the sequences encoded by exon 2, immediately upstream of Ig domain 1. There are two possibilities: either the YEGHHV sequence is part of a contact site between L1 and all three interacting proteins or the sequence provides an indirect structural function. If the region is part of an intermolecular contact site, we would expect that mutation of one or more individual residues would also affect binding. Sequential mutation of each residue to an alanine, however, had no effect on binding of L1 to either itself or F3. It is more likely therefore that the YEGHHV motif has an indirect effect on binding to these two ligands. Comparison of the first four domains of L1 with the resolved structures of those of axonin-1 and the insect protein hemolin strongly suggests that they adopt a horseshoe structure dependent on a short-hinge sequence located between Ig domains 2 and 3 (20Su X.D. Gastinel L.N. Vaughn D.E. Faye I. Poon P. Bjorkman P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 991-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 21Freigang J. Proba K. Leder L. Diederichs K. Sonderegger P. Welte W. Cell. 2000; 101: 425-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The region prior to Ig domain 1 containing the YEGHHV motif would lie in the vicinity of the junction between Ig domains 4 and 5. A function of the motif could be to stabilize the horseshoe by direct interaction with these domains, or it may provide a ‘spacer,‘ allowing NH2-terminal residues to undertake this role. Oleszewski et al. (22Oleszewski M. Gutwein P. von Der Lieth W. Rauch U. Altevogt P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34478-34485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) have shown that binding of L1 to neurocan, an extracellular matrix proteoglycan expressed primarily in the nervous system, depends on the presence of the Ig domain 1 of L1. They also demonstrated that YEGHHV is not required, indicating that the exon 2 motif does not affect the geometry of neighboring Ig domain 1. This is in keeping with an effect on tertiary structure or domain presentation rather than secondary structure. Alanine substitution revealed a difference in the binding characteristics of TAX-1 compared with F3. Mutation Y26A significantly reduced binding to TAX-1, suggesting that binding may directly involve this residue. Interestingly, this tyrosine is the only residue within the motif that is identical in L1 orthologues from human (GenBankTM accession number M77640), rodent (GenBankTM accession numbers X12875 and X59149), chick (GenBankTM accession number Z75013), and fugu (GenBankTM accession number Z71926). This is in contrast to the cytoplasmic RSLE motif that is absolutely conserved between L1-like molecules from these species as well as in other members of the L1 subfamily such as neurofascin (reviewed in Ref. 1Brümmendorf T. Kenwrick S. Rathjen F.G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The result that binding activities for L1 can be modulated at the RNA splicing level is paralleled by studies on isoforms of neurofascin. This protein has the same overall domain structure as L1 but many different isoforms produced through alternative splicing of exons. Interaction of neurofascin with four ligands including F11 and axonin-1 is modulated in a complex fashion by the combinatorial inclusion of different stretches of the protein (23Volkmer H. Zacharias U. Norenberg U. Rathjen F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1083-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The most NH2-terminal exon that is subject to alternative splicing encodes a peptide immediately upstream of Ig domain 1,i.e. in an equivalent position to YEGHHV in L1. The differential use of this exon modulates binding to several ligands in the context of some domain combinations but not others. Thus, for neurofascin, this region is also more likely to influence the tertiary structure of the protein than belong to a binding domain. Our results show for the first time that the choice or strength of L1 interactions could be in part determined by differential exon usage. It follows that L1 on neurons has a different interactive potential compared with L1 on most peripheral cells. This has implications for understanding the function of L1 in different cell types. Oligodendrocytes, for example, express different levels of the two potential isoforms depending on their state of maturation (7Itoh K. Sakurai Y. Asou H. Umeda M. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 60: 579-586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As we have shown that binding of wild-type L1 to exon 2-minus L1 is also reduced in vitro, developmental regulation of isoform expression may be accompanied by an in vivo change in affinity for L1 as well as TAX-1 and F3 on neighboring neurons. Do these data suggest that exon 2-encoded sequences are important for normal development of the nervous system? With respect to this question, we have reported previously that similar levels of reduction in homophilic or heterophilic binding to F3 and/or TAX-1 were observed for mutations in L1 that are pathogenic in man (12De Angelis E. MacFarlane J. Du J.S. Yeo G. Hicks R. Rathjen F.G. Kenwrick S. Brümmendorf T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4744-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This would suggest that wild-type levels of binding are required for correct nervous system development. In summary we have shown that the omission of sequences encoded by exon 2 reduced binding in vitro to several L1 ligands that are important to the development of the nervous system. Differential utilization of this sequence may therefore be a way of spatially and temporally regulating the type of interaction L1 undertakes. We would like to thank F. G. Rathjen for helpful discussions and D. Jobsky for technical assistance."

Class 2 acetylated H3 and H4 are rapidly acetylated to mono- and di-acetylated isoforms and slowly deacetylated. Our previous studies suggested that class 1 acetylated histones were primarily associated with transcriptionally active DNA (βA-globin) but not competent DNA (ε-globin). Chromatin salt solubility (chromatin fiber oligomerization) is directly influenced by hyperacetylation. In this study we investigated the association of class 1 histones with βA- and ε-globin DNA by measuring their loss of solubility rates in 150 mmNaCl and 3 mm MgCl2 as a function of hyperacetylated histone deacetylation. Expressed and competent chromatin was associated with class 1 acetylated histones. As most active chromatin and hyperacetylated histones are associated with the low salt-insoluble residual nuclear material containing the nuclear matrix, we investigated whether hyperacetylated histones are bound to the βA- and ε-globin DNA in this fraction. In chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we found that the βA- and ε-globin coding regions are bound to hyperacetylated H3 and H4. Our observations are consistent with a model in which nuclear matrix-associated histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases mediate a dynamic attachment between active and competent chromatin and the nuclear matrix.

Our observations are consistent with a model in which nuclear matrix-associated histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases mediate a dynamic attachment between active and competent chromatin and the nuclear matrix. phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride supernatant low salt-insoluble nuclear fraction chromatin immunoprecipitation Histone acetylation is a dynamic process catalyzed by histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases. Transcriptionally active chromatin is thought to be associated with histones that are rapidly acetylated and deacetylated, whereas histones situated along transcriptionally inactive DNA are either unacetylated or statically mono- or di-acetylated (1Hebbes T.R. Clayton A.L. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1823-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). In chicken immature erythrocytes, 4% of the modifiable lysine residues located within the N-terminal tails of core histones become dynamically acetylated and deacetylated (2Zhang D.-E. Nelson D.A. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The core histones within these cells display a similar rate of acetylation (t½ = 12 min for mono-acetylated H4) (3Zhang D.-E. Nelson D.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, these histones can be divided into two classes based on the extent of dynamic acetylation along their N-terminal tails and the rate at which the N-terminal acetylated lysine residues become deacetylated. Class 1 acetylated histones become tri- or tetra-acetylated when exposed to sodium butyrate, a histone deacetylase inhibitor. When the inhibitor is removed, these hyperacetylated histones are rapidly deacetylated (t½ = 5 min for tetra-acetylated H4) (4Zhang D.-E. Nelson D.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 5Hendzel M.J. Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21936-21942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Class 2 acetylated H3 and H4 histones become mono- or di-acetylated in the presence of sodium butyrate at the same rate as class 1 histones and then are slowly deacetylated (t½ = 90 min for H4 when mono-acetylated) once this inhibitor is removed. Chromatin fractionation studies have shown that chicken immature erythrocyte chromatin fragments soluble in 3 mmMgCl2 or 0.15 m NaCl are enriched in transcriptionally active DNA sequences and class 1, dynamically hyperacetylated histones (5Hendzel M.J. Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21936-21942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ferenz C.R. Nelson D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1977-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In reconstitution experiments, chromatin fragments containing transcriptionally active/competent DNA sequences are more resistant to 0.15 m NaCl precipitation caused by the addition of exogenously added H1 histones (7Ridsdale J.A. Hendzel M.J. Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5150-5156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (Transcriptionally competent chromatin is sensitive to DNase I digestion but transcriptionally silent.) Further, the degree of salt solubility of the chromatin fragments containing the transcriptionally active/competent DNA sequences in 150 mm NaCl correlates with the level of histone hyperacetylation (7Ridsdale J.A. Hendzel M.J. Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5150-5156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, the level of histone acetylation was shown to be the primary determinant for the resistance of transcriptionally active/competent DNA fragments to H1-induced salt precipitation. In support of these findings, the treatment of mouse fibroblast cells with trichostatin A, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, induces histone hyperacetylation and increases the rate of exchange of a mobile fraction of H1 (8Misteli T. Gunjan A. Hock R. Bustin M. Brown D.T. Nature. 2000; 408: 877-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Histone acetylation also has a profound effect on higher order compaction of chromatin. Acetylating core histones past a threshold level of 12 acetates/octamer disrupts higher order folding and oligomerization of chromatin fibers (9Tse C. Sera T. Wolffe A.P. Hansen J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4629-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to interfering with chromatin fiber-fiber interactions (9Tse C. Sera T. Wolffe A.P. Hansen J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4629-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 10Davie J.R. Spencer V.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; S32–33: 141-148Crossref Google Scholar), histone acetylation enhances the 0.15m NaCl solubility of chromatin fragments by altering H1-mediated condensation of transcriptionally active/competent DNA. In addition to being salt-soluble, transcriptionally active/competent DNA fractionates with the insoluble nuclear material that remains following low ionic extraction of chromatin fragments from micrococcal nuclease-digested nuclei (11Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Approximately 76% of the transcriptionally active histone H5 and βA-globin DNA sequences and 30.5% of the transcriptionally competent ε-globin DNA sequences are located with the low salt-insoluble nuclear material, which includes chromatin fragments associated with the nuclear matrix of chicken immature erythrocytes (5Hendzel M.J. Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21936-21942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The low salt-insoluble nuclear material of butyrate-treated immature erythrocytes contains 74% of class 1, tetra-acetylated H4 and 26.5% of class 2, mono- and di-acetylated H4 along with 75–80% of the nuclear histone deacetylase and acetyltransferase activities (12Hendzel M.J. Sun J.-M. Chen H.Y. Rattner J.B. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22894-22901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The co-enrichment of transcriptionally active DNA sequences and class 1 tetra-acetylated H4 in the low salt-insoluble nuclear material suggests that the histones associated with transcriptionally active DNA sequences bound to the nuclear matrix are class 1 dynamically and rapidly acetylated and deacetylated. Crane-Robinson and co-workers mapped the distribution of proteins containing acetylated lysine residues along the entire β-globin chromatin domain and in regions adjacent to this domain (1Hebbes T.R.

Their study showed that the core histones situated along the entire β-globin chromatin domain are acetylated, whereas the histones located in the DNase I-insensitive regions outside the domain are hypoacetylated. However, this study analyzed only the steady state levels of acetylated core histones along β-globin domain DNA sequences in soluble chromatin fragments; low salt-insoluble chromatin fragments, which contain most of the dynamically acetylated histones and transcriptionally active β-globin DNA sequences, were excluded from analysis. Further, the antibody used to map the distribution of acetylated histones recognized acetylated histone and acetylated non-histone chromosomal proteins (13Sterner D.E. Berger S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 435-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar). Whether the dynamics of histone acetylation varies between transcriptionally active and competent DNA sequences within the β-globin domain remains to be determined. In addition, little is known about the distribution of acetylated histones along the sections of the β-globin domain that are associated with the nuclear matrix. In this study we determined whether class 1, dynamically acetylated histones are associated with the transcriptionally active adult βA globin and transcriptionally competent ε-globin DNA sequences of salt-soluble chromatin fragments (chromatin fibers unable to oligomerize at the ionic conditions tested) and low salt-insoluble chromatin fragments. Immature erythrocytes were isolated from anemic, young adult White Leghorn chickens as previously described (7Ridsdale J.A. Hendzel M.J. Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5150-5156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immature erythrocytes were collected in an ice-cold buffer containing 75 mm NaCl, 25 mm EDTA, and 25 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5). Cells were resuspended in an equal volume of Swims S-77 medium (Sigma) and then incubated in the presence or absence of 10 mm sodium butyrate for 60 min at 37 °C. The erythrocytes were then washed three times in ice-cold Swim's media, resuspended in fresh Swims media prewarmed to 37 °C, and incubated for 0, 5, 10, 15, and 30 min at 37 °C. Following treatment, the erythrocytes were immediately resuspended in ice-cold Swim's media, collected by centrifugation, and stored at −80 °C. Three different preparations were analyzed in this study. Chromatin fragments soluble in 150 mmNaCl because of their inability to oligomerize were isolated from chicken immature erythrocytes as previously described (7Ridsdale J.A. Hendzel M.J. Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5150-5156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All buffers contained 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF).1 In brief, nuclei from immature erythrocytes were suspended to 50A260 units/ml in W & S buffer (1 mhexylene glycol, 10 mm Pipes, pH 7.0, 1% thiodiglycol, 30 mm sodium butyrate) containing 2 mmMgCl2 and 1 mm CaCl2, digested with 15 units of micrococcal nuclease (Worthington Biochemical Corporation, Freehold, NJ)/mg of total DNA for 5 min at 37 °C and then collected by centrifugation (9000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). The addition of EGTA to 10 mm stopped the reaction. The nuclei were then resuspended in 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and incubated on ice for 30 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 9000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, yielding the supernatant (SE) and the pellet (PE, low salt-insoluble nuclear fraction). SE fraction was made to 150 mm NaCl. The salt-soluble fraction (S150) was separated from the salt-insoluble fraction (P150) by centrifugation. Chromatin fragments soluble in 3 mm MgCl2 were isolated from chicken immature erythrocytes as previously described (6Ferenz C.R. Nelson D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1977-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). All buffers contained 1 mm PMSF. In brief, immature erythrocyte nuclei were suspended to 70 A260units/ml in a digestion buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium butyrate, 15 mm PIPES, pH 6.6) containing 3 mmMgCl2 and 1 mm CaCl2. The nuclei were then digested with 1 unit of micrococcal nuclease/50 μg of total DNA for 5 min at 37 °C and centrifuged at 9000 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C. The addition of EGTA to 20 mmterminated the reaction. The supernatant containing the salt-soluble chromatin fragments was isolated. DNA from S150, MgCl2-soluble and MgCl2-insoluble chromatin fractions was extracted with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). The resulting DNA fragments were precipitated with sodium acetate and ethanol, resuspended in Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 8), quantified by UV spectrophotometry, and then either slot blotted using a Schleicher and Schuell slot blotting manifold or Southern blotted onto Hybond N+-charged nylon membrane as previously described (11Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For the slot blot analysis, an amount of DNA was applied to each slot such that the relation between the signal and the amount of DNA slotted was linear. Thus, the signal intensity from each slot was directly proportional to the amount of hybridizable DNA sequence. The slot or Southern blot was then hybridized overnight at 42 °C to 6 × 106 cpm of 32P-labeled DNA with a specific activity of ∼1 × 108 cpm/μg DNA. Following hybridization, the slot or Southern blot was washed to remove nonspecifically bound probe. In the Slot blot analysis, the amount of probe hybridized to each slot was quantified by a phosphorimager (Bio-Rad, CA). DNA probes recognizing the βA-globin, ε-globin and vitellogenin genes were used (11Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The βA-globin and ε-globin DNA probes recognize the second intronic sequence of the βA- and ε-globin genes, respectively. Both probes were 500 base pairs in length, with the βA- and ε-globin introns being ∼800 and 600 base pairs, respectively, from the transcription start site (14Dodgson J.B. Stadt S.J. Choi O.R. Dolan M. Fischer H.D. Engel J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12685-12692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Dolan M. Dodgson J.B. Engel J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3983-3990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The vitellogenin DNA probe is 3.6 kilobase pairs in length and recognizes the 5′ region of the vitellogenin gene. Histones were isolated from nuclei and chromatin preparations by extraction with 0.4 N H2SO4 as previously described (5Hendzel M.J. Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21936-21942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein microassay. Acid-Urea-Triton 15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transfer of the proteins to nitrocellulose were performed as previously described (11Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Acetylated isoforms of H3 and H4 were detected by immunostaining the membrane with polyclonal antibodies to di-acetylated H3 and penta-acetylated H4 (Upstate Biotech). PE was isolated as previously described (7Ridsdale J.A. Hendzel M.J. Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5150-5156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the exception that the nuclei were digested with 15 units of micrococcal nuclease/mg of total DNA for 10 min at 37 °C. The PE fraction was resuspended in CSK buffer (10 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 300 mm sucrose, 100 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% thiodiglycol) to ∼10A260 units/ml. Formaldehyde was added to the PE suspension to a final concentration of 1% for 10 min on ice, and the cross-linking reaction was quenched by the addition of Tris-HCl (pH 8) to a final concentration of 125 mm. The suspension was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against double-distilled water and 0.5 mm PMSF and then concentrated to ∼4–5 ml using PEG 6000–8000 Carbowax. Added to the suspension was NaCl, Tris-HCl, EDTA, Triton X-100, and SDS to 250 mm, 25 mm (pH 7.5), 5 mm, 1%, and 0.1%, respectively (SB250 buffer). The DNA within the suspension was reduced to 500 base pair fragments by sonication on ice for a total time of 4 min at 30% output (Sonifier Cell Disrupter 350, Branson Sonic Power Company). The 4-min period of sonication was divided up into 16 15-s pulses with 15-s waiting intervals on ice in between each pulse. The sonicated PE suspension was then diluted to ∼9 A260 units/ml and centrifuged for 10 min at 9000 × g to remove insoluble material. The resulting suspension was made up to 1 mm PMSF and 50 μg/ml leupeptin. A volume of 2.5 μl of antibody to di-acetylated H3 or penta-acetylated H4 was added to 500 μl of the suspension, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C. The suspension was then incubated for 3 h at 4 °C on an orbitron with 20 μl of a 50:50 protein A-Sepharose slurry (Zymed Laboratories Inc., Ontario, Canada) that had been pretreated overnight at 4 °C with 0.1 μg/μl of sonicated salmon sperm DNA and 1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin. To control for nonspecific binding of DNA to protein A-Sepharose, 500 μl of the suspension was incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with 20 μl of the 50:50 protein A-Sepharose slurry in the absence of primary antibody. The protein A-Sepharose of both samples was then centrifuged at 2200 × g for 30 s and washed sequentially with 1 ml of 1× RIPA (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1.0% Nonidet P-40), 1 ml of high salt buffer (500 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA), 1 ml of LiCl wash buffer (250 mmLiCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mmEDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and two times with 1 ml of TE buffer (pH 8.0). A volume of 100 μl of TE buffer (pH 8.0) was added to the protein A-Sepharose along with 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K, 0.5% SDS, and 100 mm NaCl. The mixture was incubated overnight at 37 °C, and then at 68 °C for 6 h. The mixture was centrifuged at 2200 × g for 30 s, and the supernatant was extracted once with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl (25:24:1). The DNA in the supernatant was precipitated with 20 μg/ml of glycogen carrier, one-tenth the volume of 3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.3, and 3 volumes of absolute ethanol. The DNA was then resuspended in double-distilled water, quantified by fluorometry, slotted on to a Hybond N+-charged nylon membrane, and hybridized to the previously mentioned βA-globin, ε-globin, and vitellogenin gene probes. Immature erythrocytes were incubated with 10 mm sodium butyrate for 60 min to induce a state of histone hyperacetylation. The erythrocytes were then incubated in the absence of sodium butyrate for 0–30 min to deacetylate the hyperacetylated histones. Histones were extracted from the nuclei of cells collected at various time points following butyrate removal and subjected to acid/urea/Triton X-100 gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. The resulting membrane was immunostained with antibodies to highly acetylated H3 and H4 (Fig.1). Western blot analysis of the total nuclear histone extracts showed a large drop in the levels of penta-acetylated H3 within the first 5 min of incubation in the absence of sodium butyrate. At 10 min the levels of penta-acetylated H3 dropped further, becoming barely detectable at 30 min. A rapid decline in the levels of tetra-acetylated H3 was also observed at 5 min. At 10 min the level of tetra-acetylated H3 declined further, plateauing at a very low level. Levels of tri-acetylated H3 did not change initially, but at 10 min a decrease in the levels of this acetylated H3 isoform was observed. At 5, 10, and 15 min following butyrate removal, the levels of mono- and di-acetylated H3 decreased but at a much slower rate than the highly acetylated H3 isoforms. Immunostaining the blots with anti-penta-acetylated H4 antibodies revealed that the levels of tetra-acetylated H4 rapidly declined at 10 min (Fig. 1). These levels declined further over the next 20 min. Similarly, the levels of tri-acetylated H4 also decreased at 10 min, although this decrease was not as pronounced as that observed for the tetra-acetylated H4 isoform. The mono- and di-acetylated H4 isoforms accumulated at 15 and 30 min post-butyrate removal. In summary the immunoblot analyses show that class 1 highly acetylated H3 and H4 isoforms declined to low levels by 10 min following incubation of cells in media lacking butyrate. Our previous studies showed that the solubility of active/competent gene chromatin fragments in 0.15 m NaCl is dependent on the level of acetylated histone species (7Ridsdale J.A. Hendzel M.J. Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5150-5156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, histone hyperacetylation interferes with the ability of chromatin fibers to form high molecular weight oligomers (9Tse C. Sera T. Wolffe A.P. Hansen J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4629-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Because the inability of chromatin fragments to oligomerize in 0.15 m NaCl is dependent upon histone acetylation status, the rate of deacetylation of histones associated with transcriptionally active and competent chromatin fragments can be determined by studying their rate of loss of 0.15 m NaCl solubility and gain of ability to oligomerize. Soluble chromatin fragments (fraction S.E.) were isolated from nuclei of cells incubated for various times (0, 5, 10, 15, and 30 min) following the removal of butyrate. Typically 60% of theA260 absorbing material was released into this fraction. The SE chromatin fraction was made 0.15 m in NaCl, and the salt-soluble chromatin fragments (fraction S150) were isolated. The DNA fragments were analyzed by slot blot hybridization with probes to the βA-globin, ε-globin, and vitellogenin DNA sequences. Fig. 2 shows that incubation of cells in the absence of butyrate results in a decline in the content of βA-globin and ε-globin DNA sequences in the 0.15 m NaCl-soluble chromatin fragments. The content of vitellogenin DNA sequences in the salt-soluble chromatin fraction was not altered throughout the 30-min incubation. The parallel drop in salt solubility and gain in ability of the βA-globin and ε-globin chromatin fragments to oligomerize suggests that the deacetylation rates of the histones associated with these chromatin fragments are similar. Mononucleosomes released from micrococcal nuclease-digested erythrocyte nuclei into buffers containing 3 mm MgCl2 are enriched in the transcriptionally active βA-globin DNA sequences and largely depleted in inactive DNA sequences. Inhibiting histone deacetylation increases the enrichment of active mononucleosomes released from the nuclease-digested nuclei (6Ferenz C.R. Nelson D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1977-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, enhanced solubility of transcriptionally active mononucleosomes from nuclease-digested nuclei is a direct consequence of induced histone acetylation (16Alonso W.R. Ferris R.C. Zhang D.E. Nelson D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 9325-9337Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To test whether the status of dynamically acetylated histones affected the release of competent ε-globin mononucleosomes from nuclease-digested nuclei, nuclei isolated from cells incubated in the absence or presence of butyrate for 60 min were digested with micrococcal nuclease, and the chromatin fragments released during digestion and those remaining with the nuclei were collected. The percentage of chromatin released from the nuclease-digested nuclei was similar for each preparation (4.4 to 5%). βA-globin DNA sequences were enriched in the mononucleosomal fraction released from the nuclease-digested nuclei of butyrate-treated immature erythrocytes. However, this enrichment was not observed with mononucleosomes isolated from cells incubated in the absence of butyrate (data not shown). These observations are identical to the results of Zhang and Nelson (4Zhang D.-E. Nelson D.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The content of ε-globin DNA sequences in the mononucleosome fraction was greater from nuclei isolated from cells incubated from butyrate compared with that from nuclei of cells incubated in the absence of butyrate (Fig. 3). The enrichment of ε-globin DNA sequences in the 3 mmMgCl2-soluble mononucleosome fraction, however, was less than that attained by the β-globin DNA sequences. In summary, the results show that histone hyperacetylation increases the release of ε-globin mononucleosomes from nuclease-digested nuclei. Because hyperacetylation directly influences the MgCl2solubility of transcriptionally active and competent mononucleosomes, we monitored the content of these sequences in the mononucleosome fraction as a function of time during which hyperacetylated histones were becoming deacetylated. As with the previous studies, cells were incubated with butyrate to maximize the acetylation state of class 1 histones followed by incubation of the cells for various times in the absence of butyrate to initiate the deacetylation of the hyperacetylated class 1 histones. The DNA from the 3 mmMgCl2-soluble mononucleosomes was slotted onto nylon membrane and hybridized to DNA probes recognizing βA-globin and ε-globin intronic regions and the 5′ region of the vitellogenin gene. A plot of the hybridization signal intensity versus time following removal of butyrate showed that the release of βA-globin and ε-globin mononucleosomes was markedly reduced by 5 min followed by a more gradual decline (Fig. 4). In contrast to the βA-globin and ε-globin mononucleosomes, the deacetylation of hyperacetylated histones did not alter the release of vitellogenin mononucleosomes from the nuclease-digested nuclei. The sudden decrease in the release of βA-globin and ε-globin mononucleosomes within the first 5 min of incubation in the absence of butyrate closely follows the timing of class 1 hyperacetylated histone deacetylation, particularly that of H3 (see Fig. 1). In summary the rapid decline in the release of βA-globin and ε-globin mononucleosomes from nuclease-digested nuclei parallels the rapid deacetylation of the hyperacetylated class 1 histones. Previous studies have demonstrated directly that acetylated histones are associated with the transcriptionally active βA-globin and transcriptionally competent ε-globin genes in avian erythrocytes. However, these ChIP assays used soluble chromatin fragments. Most highly acetylated histones and transcriptionally active βA-globin DNA sequences are associated with fraction PE, the low salt-insoluble residual nuclear material harboring chromatin associated with the nuclear matrix (5Hendzel M.J. Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21936-21942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To date, no studies have determined if transcriptionally active chromatin bound to the nuclear matrix is associated with highly acetylated histones. To address this question, chromatin fragments associated with the low salt-insoluble nuclear material of butyrate-treated immature chicken erythrocytes were briefly incubated with formaldehyde. In addition to cross-linking histones to DNA, formaldehyde incubation releases chromatin fragments from the nuclear matrix (17Nickerson J.A. Krockmalnic G. Wan K.M. Penman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4446-4450Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The chromatin fragments bound to hyperacetylated H3 and H4 were isolated by ChIPs. Previously in immunoblot experiments we showed that the antibodies used in the ChIP assays preferentially recognized highly acetylated isoforms of H3 or H4 (18Walia H. Chen H.Y. Sun J.-M. Holth L.T. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14516-24522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, the anti-di-acetylated H3 antibody (acetylated Lys-9 and Lys-14) was more discriminating for the highly acetylated H3 isoforms than was the anti-acetylated H4 antibody for the highly acetylated H4 isoforms. The DNA sequences bound to hyperacetylated H3 and H4 were isolated and analyzed by slot blot analysis using DNA probes to the intronic regions of the βA-globin and ε-globin genes and to the 5′ region of the vitellogenin gene (Fig.5). A comparison of the hybridization signal intensities of the three probes in the input and acetylated H3-immunoprecipitated DNA fractions showed that hyperacetylated H3 was bound to βA-globin and ε-globin DNA but not to vitellogenin DNA. Fig. 5 shows that acetylated H4 was bound to βA-globin and ε-globin intronic DNA sequences. Vitellogenin DNA was also bound to acetylated H4, which we assume is the mono- and di-acetylated isoforms. In summary, our results show that hyperacetylated H3 and H4 are bound to the βA-globin and ε-globin DNA sequences associated with the insoluble residual nuclear material. Rates of histone acetylation and deacetylation are determined in pulse-chase experiments in which protein synthesis is inhibited with cycloheximide (4Zhang D.-E. Nelson D.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Our immunoblot analyses with anti-acetylated H3 and anti-acetylated H4 antibodies demonstrated that the rates of deacetylation of hyperacetylated H3 and H4 were comparable with those obtained in pulse-chase studies. We conclude that cycloheximide does not significantly disturb the balance between histone acetyltransferase and histone deacetylase activity in chicken immature erythrocytes. Our results show that class 1 histones, which are rapidly highly acetylated and deacetylated, are bound to transcriptionally active βA-globin and transcriptionally competent ε-globin genes. In parallel βA-globin and ε-globin chromatin fragments gained the ability to oligomerize in 150 mm NaCl as deacetylation of the hyperacetylated H3 and H4 isoforms progressed. Further, the rapid deacetylation of hyperacetylated H3 isoforms corresponded to a rapidly reduced solubility in 3 mmMgCl2 of βA-globin and ε-globin mononucleosomes from nuclease-digested nuclei. The loss of the hyperacetylated H3 histones may reverse the disruption of higher order globin chromatin structure, obstructing the release of mononucleosomes from the globin chromatin domain (9Tse C. Sera T. Wolffe A.P. Hansen J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4629-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 19Wang X. He C. Moore S.C. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12764-12768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, the extent of MgCl2 solubility loss of the βA-globin mononucleosomes was more acute than that of the ε-globin chromatin fragments. These and other studies show that a greater percentage of βA-globin compared with ε-globin chromatin is soluble in 150 mm NaCl or 3 mm MgCl2 (11Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We interpret these studies to demonstrate that active coding regions of the βA-globin gene are extensively associated with class 1 acetylated histones, whereas the competent ε-globin gene is a mosaic of class 1 and class 2 acetylated histones. This would explain why in our previous study the partitioning of βA-globin DNA sequences precisely matched that of the hyperacetylated H4 isoforms, whereas competent ε-globin DNA sequences did not (5Hendzel M.J. Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21936-21942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Crane-Robinson and co-workers have shown that the entire β-globin loop domain is associated with acetylated histones in soluble chromatin fragments (1Hebbes T.R. Clayton A.L. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1823-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The low salt-insoluble chromatin fraction, which contains the bulk of the highly acetylated histones and transcriptionally active DNA, was excluded from their analyses. Our ChIP assays show for the first time that βA- and ε-globin intron DNA sequences associated with the residual insoluble nuclear material are bound to highly acetylated H3 and H4. Fraction PE harbors most of the histone acetyltransferase and deacetylase activities. Further, histone acetyltransferase and histone deacetylase activities are associated with the nuclear matrix (12Hendzel M.J. Sun J.-M. Chen H.Y. Rattner J.B. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22894-22901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our observations are consistent with a model in which nuclear matrix-associated histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases mediate a dynamic attachment between transcriptionally active chromatin domains and the nuclear matrix. In the case of the β-globin domain, these dynamic interactions are not confined to the promoter region but also include the coding regions of expressed and competent genes. Our studies provide evidence that both βA- and ε-globin intron DNA sequences are associated with class 1 dynamically acetylated histones, with βA-globin intron DNA sequences having a higher concentration of this class of acetylated histones than that associated with the ε-globin intron DNA sequences. The rapid acetylation and deacetylation of the class 1 histones bound to the βA-globin intron DNA sequences suggests that the core histone tails bound to the βA-globin gene will be in frequent contact with nuclear matrix-bound histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases. The contacts between these enzymes and the competent ε-globin chromatin will be less frequent. Hence, these multiple dynamic interactions with the transcribed βA-globin gene selectively retain this gene at nuclear matrix sites that are engaged in transcription."

Sequencing of the purified peptides revealed the presence of a Cys876-Cys888 disulfide bond on the luminal loop connecting the 7th and 8th transmembrane helices (loop 7–8) of the Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA1a). We substituted either or both of these cysteine residues with alanine and made three mutants (C876A, C888A, C876A/C888A), in which the disulfide bond is disrupted. The mutants and the wild type were expressed in COS-1 cells, and functional analysis was performed with the microsomes isolated from the cells. Electrophoresis performed under reducing and non-reducing conditions confirmed the presence of Cys876-Cys888 disulfide bond in the expressed wild type. All the three mutants possessed high Ca2+-ATPase activity. In contrast, no Ca2+ transport activity was detected with these mutants. These mutants formed almost the same amount of phosphoenzyme intermediate as the wild type from ATP and from Pi. Detailed kinetic analysis showed that the three mutants hydrolyze ATP in the mechanism well accepted for the Ca2+-ATPase; activation of the catalytic site upon high affinity Ca2+ binding, formation of ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme, subsequent rate-limiting transition to ADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme, and hydrolysis of the latter phosphoenzyme. It is likely that the pathway for delivery of Ca2+ from the binding sites into the lumen of vesicles is disrupted by disruption of the Cys876-Cys888 disulfide bond, and therefore that the loop 7–8 having the disulfide bond is important for formation of the proper structure of the Ca2+ pathway.

In the catalytic cycle, the enzyme is activated by binding of two Ca2+ ions to the transport sites from the cytoplasmic side, and then γ-phosphoryl group of ATP is transferred to Asp351 (5Degani C.

Biochem. (Tokyo). 1970; 68: 593-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Upon formation of this EP, the two Ca2+ ions are occluded. A subsequent rate-limiting transition of ADP-sensitiveEP to ADP-insensitive EP, which cannot react with ADP, results in release of the Ca2+ ions into the lumen. Finally, ADP-insensitive EP is hydrolyzed to form Pi and the dephosphoenzyme. This EP can also be formed from Pi in the absence of Ca2+ by reversal of its hydrolysis (11Kanazawa T. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3163-3172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Masuda H. de Meis L. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4581-4585Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-ATPase contains ten transmembrane-helices (M1 to M10), and the bound two Ca2+ ions are shown to be located side by side near the center of four helices, M4, M5, M6, and M8 in the crystal structure (13Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). The ATP binding site and phosphorylation site are located on the large cytoplasmic loop between M4 and M5 (13Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar, 14MacLennan D.H. Rice W.J. Green N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28815-28818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Luminal loops are short except for the one connecting M7 and M8, the loop 7–8 (approximately Ala853-Glu892), which protrudes into the luminal space in the crystal structure (13Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). Possible roles of this loop have not yet been well understood. This loop contains two cysteine residues, Cys876 and Cys888. These residues have been predicted to participate in disulfide bonds (15Green N.M. Toms E.J. Biochem. J. 1985; 231: 425-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), although the exact disulfide structure has yet to be identified. Because mutations of these residues were reported to cause partial loss of function (14MacLennan D.H. Rice W.J. Green N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28815-28818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), the possible disulfide bonds formed with Cys876 and with Cys888 likely to be important for structure and function of the enzyme. Previous studies demonstrated (15Green N.M. Toms E.J. Biochem. J. 1985; 231: 425-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 16Daiho T. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11060-11064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Thorley-Lawson D.A. Green N.M. Biochem. J. 1977; 167: 739-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) that totally 3 or 4 disulfide bonds are present in the Ca2+-ATPase. We showed (16Daiho T. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11060-11064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that all of the disulfide bonds in the enzyme of the SR vesicles were not readily reduced with dithiothreitol even at high concentrations but can be readily reduced if both Ca2+ and a purine nucleotide are present. We further revealed that the reduction time courses of the disulfide bonds were not well separated from each other and thus that selective reduction of the disulfide bonds in the enzyme is impossible (16Daiho T. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11060-11064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The functional roles of the disulfide bonds can be explored, therefore, only by the site-directed mutagenesis of the cysteine residues identified as to form the disulfide bond of interest. In the present study, we have explored first the exact disulfide structure of Cys876 and Cys888 on the loop 7–8, and then to identify the possible role of the disulfide bond. Sequencing of the disulfide-containing peptides purified from the pepsin digest of SR vesicles showed that a disulfide bond is formed between Cys876 and Cys888 of the Ca2+-ATPase. We have then substituted either or both of these residues with alanine and made three SERCA1a mutants (C876A, C888A, and C876A/C888A), in which the disulfide bond is disrupted. All the three mutants hydrolyzed ATP at high rates in the mechanism well accepted for the Ca2+-ATPase. In contrast, none of the mutants could transport Ca2+ at a detectable rate. Results indicate that the loop 7–8 having the disulfide bond is important for formation of the proper structure of the Ca2+-release pathway. SR vesicles were prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle as described previously (18Nakamura S. Suzuki H. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16015-16019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The content of phosphorylation site determined with [γ-32P]ATP according to Barrabin et al. (19Barrabin H. Scofano H.M. Inesi G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) was 4.1 ± 0.1 nmol/mg of SR protein (n = 6). The number of disulfide bonds in the Ca2+-ATPase of SR vesicles estimated with ABD-F and TBP according to Kirley (20Kirley T.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) was 2.4 ± 0.4 disulfide bonds (n = 4), and agreed closely with the number determined by Thorley-Lawson and Green (three disulfide bonds) (17Thorley-Lawson D.A. Green N.M. Biochem. J. 1977; 167: 739-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). SR vesicles (1 mg/ml) in 12 mm HCl (pH 2.0) were degassed and flushed with nitrogen, and then digested with pepsin (0.1 mg/ml) under nitrogen at 37 °C for 1 h under acidic conditions that were previously shown to prevent possible disulfide interchanges (21Spackman D.H. Stein W.H. Moore S. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 648-659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and oxidation of cysteine residues (22Benesch R.E. Benesch R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1955; 77: 5877-5881Crossref Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 23Dixon M. Tunnicliffe H.E. Proc. Roy. Soc. (London). 1923; B94: 266-297Google Scholar). After centrifugation, the supernatant was subjected to reversed phase HPLC performed as previously described (24Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Saino T. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30627-30636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). All the elution buffers used were acidic (pH below 4) and degassed with an on-line degasser to prevent the possible oxidation and disulfide interchanges (21Spackman D.H. Stein W.H. Moore S. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 648-659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Benesch R.E. Benesch R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1955; 77: 5877-5881Crossref Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 23Dixon M. Tunnicliffe H.E. Proc. Roy. Soc. (London). 1923; B94: 266-297Google Scholar). Aliquots of each fraction were assayed for disulfides by simultaneous reduction and labeling of disulfides with a fluorogenic thiol-specific reagent ABD-F and a reductant TBP. ABD-F reacts with neither disulfides (25Toyo'oka T. Imai K. Anal. Chem. 1984; 56: 2461-2464Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar) nor TBP (26Rüegg U.T. Rudinger J. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Samples were labeled maximally with 0.2 mm ABD-F for 30 min at 60 °C in the presence and absence of 0.5 mm TBP in 125 mmNa2B4O7 (pH 8.0), 2 mmEDTA, and 2% SDS. Fluorescence intensity of bound ABD (excitation, 382 nm; emission, 504 nm) was measured in 50 mm ammonium acetate (pH 4.0) and 50% (v/v) ethanol. Sequencing of purified peptides was performed with an Applied Biosystems 477/120A sequencer. Overlap extension PCR (27Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar) was utilized for the substitution of Cys888 with alanine in the rabbit SERCA1a cDNA. The ApaLI-SalI restriction fragments were excised from the PCR products and ligated back into the corresponding region in the full-length SERCA1a cDNA in the pMT2 expression vector (28Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Pathak V.K. Hershey J.W.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 946-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The alanine substitution of Cys876 in the SERCA1a cDNA was generated by the oligodeoxyribonucleotide-directed dual amber method (29Hashimoto-Gotoh T. Mizuno T. Ogasahara Y. Nakagawa M. Gene. 1995; 152: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). TheKpnI-SalI fragments from the SERCA1a cDNA were cloned into pKF19c vector (29Hashimoto-Gotoh T. Mizuno T. Ogasahara Y. Nakagawa M. Gene. 1995; 152: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and hybridized with an oligonucleotide containing the desired mutation. The resulting mutantKpnI-SalI fragments were excised and ligated back into the SERCA1a cDNA in the pMT2 vector. DNA sequence was confirmed by the dideoxy method. The pMT2 DNA was transfected into COS-1 cells by the liposome-mediated transfection method. Microsomes were prepared from the cells in the presence of 3 mm2-mercaptoethanol as described (30Maruyama K. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The “control microsomes” were prepared from COS-1 cells transfected with the pMT2 vector containing no SERCA1a cDNA. The amount of the expressed SERCA1a was quantified by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described (31Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Suzuki H. Saino T. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23910-23915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The expression levels of the mutants C876A, C888A, and C876A/C888A in the microsomes were 11 ± 1.7, 18 ± 1.5, and 17 ± 1.9% (n = 4) of that of the wild type, respectively. The reduced expression of SERCA1a due to substitutions of Cys876 and of Cys888 was also previously observed in HEK-293 cells (32Rice W.J. Green N.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31412-31419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). SR vesicles or microsomes from COS-1 cells (0.6 mg/ml) were digested with trypsin (Sigma) (0.9 µg/ml) at 21 °C for 10 min in 5 mmCaCl2, 0.5 m sucrose, and 50 mmMOPS/NaOH (pH 7.0). The samples were treated with a modified Laemmli sample buffer with or without 0.7 m 2-mercaptoethanol and separated by SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Proteins on the gels were blotted onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane and incubated with VE121G9 or IIH11 monoclonal antibody to the rabbit SERCA1a (Affinity Bioreagents). After incubation with secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated), the bound proteins were probed using an enhanced chemiluminescence-linked detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Ca2+transport activity was assayed as described previously (31Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Suzuki H. Saino T. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23910-23915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) at 25 °C in the presence and absence of 0.5 µm thapsigargin in a mixture containing 10 µg/ml microsomal protein, 1 mm ATP, 7 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m KCl, 20 mm MOPS/NaOH (pH 7.0), 5 mm potassium oxalate, 0.5 mm EGTA, and various concentrations of45CaCl2. The specific transport rate/mg of SERCA1a protein was calculated from the amount of the expressed SERCA1a and the Ca2+ transport activity of the expressed SERCA1a, which was obtained by subtracting the thapsigargin-sensitive transport activity of the control microsomes from that of the microsomes expressing SERCA1a. The rate of ATP hydrolysis was determined at 25 °C in the presence and absence of 0.5 µmthapsigargin in a mixture containing 10 µg/ml microsomal protein, 1 µmA23187, 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP, 7 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m KCl, 50 mm MOPS/NaOH (pH 7.0), 0.5 mm EGTA, and various concentrations of CaCl2. The specific ATPase activity/mg of expressed SERCA1a protein was calculated from the amount of the expressed SERCA1a and the ATPase activity of the expressed SERCA1a, which was obtained by subtracting the thapsigargin-sensitive ATPase activity of the control microsomes from that of the microsomes expressing SERCA1a. Phosphorylation of SERCA1a in microsomes with [γ-32P]ATP or32Pi, and dephosphorylation of32P-labeled SERCA1a were performed under conditions described in the figure legends. The reactions were quenched with ice-cold trichloroacetic acid containing Pi. The precipitated proteins were separated at pH 6.0 by 5% SDS-PAGE according to Weber and Osborn (34Weber K. Osborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The radioactivity associated with the separated Ca2+-ATPase was quantitated by digital autoradiography as described (35Daiho T. Suzuki H. Yamasaki K. Saino T. Kanazawa T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The amount of EP formed with the expressed SERCA1a was obtained by subtracting the background radioactivity with the control microsomes. This background was less than 5% of the radioactivity of EP formed with the expressed wild type SERCA1a. The amount of EP/mg of SERCA1a protein was calculated from the amount of EP thus obtained and the amount of the expressed SERCA1a. ABD-F was obtained from Dojindo (Kumamoto, Japan). TBP was from Sigma. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (36Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The concentration of free Ca2+ was calculated as described (37Kubota T. Daiho T. Kanazawa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1163: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using the program Origin (Microcal Software, Inc., Northampton, MA). To identify disulfide bonds present in the native Ca2+-ATPase, proteolysis of SR vesicles with pepsin and chromatographic isolation of peptides were performed under acidic conditions (pH below 4), which prevent possible disulfide interchanges or oxidation of cysteine residues (21Spackman D.H. Stein W.H. Moore S. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 648-659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Benesch R.E. Benesch R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1955; 77: 5877-5881Crossref Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 23Dixon M. Tunnicliffe H.E. Proc. Roy. Soc. (London). 1923; B94: 266-297Google Scholar), and in solutions degassed or flushed with nitrogen prior to and during use (see “Experimental Procedures”). When SR vesicles were digested extensively with pepsin, 78% of disulfides in the whole digest was recovered in the supernatant. The supernatant was subjected to the first reversed phase HPLC, and aliquots of each fraction were assayed for disulfides (Fig. 1,A–C). Peptides containing disulfides were present in a major sharp peak, fraction I, and two minor broad peaks,fraction II and fraction III (Fig.1 C). In the second reversed phase HPLC, fraction I gave a single disulfide-containing peak (peak Ia, Fig. 1,D–F). Peptides in this peak were further purified in the third reversed phase HPLC, and then labeled with ABD-F in the presence of TBP. In the fourth reversed phase HPLC, the labeled sample gave one major (peptide Ia′) and one minor (peptide Ia“) fluorescent peaks of bound ABD, which gave the sequences Met874-Glu889 and Met874-Cys888, respectively, of SERCA1a (TableI). These peptides contained only two cysteine residues, Cys876 and Cys888, and both of these residues had been labeled with ABD-F only in the presence of TBP to generate ABD-cysteine (Fig. 1 E). The results show that a disulfide bond(s) is formed with these cysteine residues. Furthermore, we found in SDS-PAGE performed under non-reducing conditions that the observed molecular mass of the Ca2+-ATPase corresponded to its monomeric form but not to a possible dimeric or higher oligomeric form (see also Fig.2), indicating that the enzyme possesses only intramolecular disulfide bonds. Collectively, the results demonstrate that an intramolecular disulfide bond is formed between Cys876 and Cys888 in the SR Ca2+-ATPase.Table ISequences of disulfide-containing peptidesCycle no.Residues determined at the given cyclePeptide Ia′Peptide Ia“Peptide IIaPeptide IIIc1Met (7157)1-aThe numbers in parentheses indicate picomoles of amino acid at the given cycle.Met (964)Leu (937)Met (1985)2Gln (3773)Gln (386)Ser (48)Gln (724)3ABD-Cys (6127)ABD-Cys (14)Gln (261)ABD-Cys (954)4Thr (2786)Thr (13)Gln (345)Thr (229)5Glu (6412)Glu (28)ABD-Cys (365)Glu (486)6Asp (495)Asp (11)Ser (38)Asp (216)7His (1078)His (8)Tyr (239)His (88)8Pro (562)Pro (24)Met (380)Pro (382)9His (1454)His (5)Gly (353)His (61)10Phe (482)Phe (37)Gly (284)Phe (668)11Glu (342)Glu (15)ABD-Cys (138)Glu (331)12Gly (242)Gly (25)Phe (158)Gly (483)13Leu (220)Leu (32)-1-bThe dashes indicate that no phenylthiohydantoin derivatives were detected.Leu (605)14Asp (97)Asp (7)-Asp (118)15ABD-Cys (46)ABD-Cys (15)ABD-Cys (278)16Glu (27)-Glu (201)17--Ile (297)18-Phe (168)19-20-The disulfide-containing peptides purified from the pepsin digest of SR vesicles were labeled with 0.2 mm ABD-F in the presence of 0.5 mm TBP then purified by the fourth reversed phase HPLC and sequenced.1-a The numbers in parentheses indicate picomoles of amino acid at the given cycle.1-b The dashes indicate that no phenylthiohydantoin derivatives were detected. Open table in a new tab The disulfide-containing peptides purified from the pepsin digest of SR vesicles were labeled with 0.2 mm ABD-F in the presence of 0.5 mm TBP then purified by the fourth reversed phase HPLC and sequenced. In the second reversed phase HPLC, fraction II andfraction III gave two (peak IIa and peak IIb) (Fig. 1, G–I) and four (peak IIIa,peak IIIb, peak IIIc, and peak IIId) (Fig. 1, J–L) disulfide-containing peaks, respectively. The disulfide-containing peptides in these peaks were further purified and labeled with ABD-F in the presence of TBP as above. The peptide frompeak IIIc gave a sequence Met874-Phe891 of SERCA1a, in which Cys876 and Cys888 had been labeled with ABD only in the presence of TBP (peptide IIIc, Table I): results again show that a disulfide bond is formed between Cys876and Cys888. The peptide from peak IIa gave a sequence Leu832-Phe843 of a 160-kDa glycoprotein (and its splice variant 53-kDa glycoprotein) of SR (38Leberer E. Charuk J.H.M. Green N.M. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6047-6051Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (Table I), in which a disulfide bond is formed between Cys836 and Cys842. Peak IIb gave no distinct sequence. Peptides from peak IIIa and peak IIIb gave sequences in the 160-kDa glycoprotein, and a peptide from peak IIId gave a sequence in pepsin (data not shown). To explore possible roles of the Cys876-Cys888 disulfide bond, we made three SERCA1a substitution mutants, C876A, C888A, and C876A/C888A, in which the disulfide bond of interest is disrupted, and expressed in COS-1 cells. The microsomes were prepared from the cells in the presence of 3 mm 2-mercaptoethanol to prevent possible formation of non-native disulfide bonds in the wild type and mutants. We first confirmed the presence of the intramolecular Cys876-Cys888 disulfide bond in the expressed wild type SERCA1a as in the SR Ca2+-ATPase. In Fig. 2, the microsomes, SR vesicles, and their tryptic digests were either unreduced or reduced in SDS with 2-mercaptoethanol at a high concentration (0.7 m), and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. When reduced, all the SR Ca2+-ATPase, wild type, and three mutants migrated at 110 kDa (Fig. 2 A, dotted lines), which agrees with the molecular mass (1Brandl C.J. Green N.M. Korczak B. MacLennan D.H. Cell. 1986; 44: 597-607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 2Brandl C.J. deLeon S. Martin D.R. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3768-3774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When unreduced, the SR Ca2+-ATPase migrated at a substantially faster rate (95 kDa) (Fig. 2 A, arrows), but the three mutants migrated only very slightly faster than the reduced 110-kDa ATPase chains. The unreduced wild type SERCA1a migrated at exactly the same rate (95 kDa) as the unreduced SR Ca2+-ATPase. These results together with the above sequencing results show that the expressed wild type SERCA1a as well as the SR Ca2+-ATPase possesses the intramolecular Cys876-Cys888 disulfide bond. This was further confirmed with the tryptic B fragment (Ala506 to C terminus) on which both of the cysteine residues are located. The unreduced B fragment of the SR Ca2+-ATPase and wild type SERCA1a migrated substantially faster (45 kDa) (Fig. 2 B,arrows) than the reduced B fragment (55 kDa) (Fig.2 B, dotted lines), whereas unreduced B fragment of three mutants migrated only very slightly faster than the reduced B fragment. We infer that this slightly faster rate is due to the presence of some other disulfide bonds (16Daiho T. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11060-11064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Thorley-Lawson D.A. Green N.M. Biochem. J. 1977; 167: 739-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), of which reduction would not affect the migration rate substantially. The tryptic A fragment (N terminus to Arg505) of all the samples migrated at ∼55 kDa regardless of whether untreated or treated with the reductant (Fig. 2 C, dotted lines), the results being consistent with the observation (17Thorley-Lawson D.A. Green N.M. Biochem. J. 1977; 167: 739-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) that disulfide bonds of the enzyme are confined to its B fragment. Fig. 3A shows typical examples of the thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+transport catalyzed by microsomes from COS-1 cells at 10 µm Ca2+. Microsomes expressing the mutant C876A or C888A showed no transport activity over the background level determined with the control microsomes, which were prepared from the COS-1 cells transfected with the vector containing no SERCA1a cDNA. This background level was as low as 4% of the activity of microsomes expressing the wild type SECRA1a. The specific transport rate/mg of the wild type SERCA1a increased with increasing Ca2+concentration, and reached the maximal level at 10 µmCa2+ with the half-maximal rate at 0.4 µmCa2+ (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, none of the mutants C876A, C888A, and C876A/C888A was able to transport Ca2+ at a detectable rate at all the Ca2+ concentrations examined. ATP hydrolysis was assayed with 0.1 mm[γ-32P]ATP in the presence of Ca2+ionophore A23187 under conditions otherwise similar to those for the Ca2+ transport assay. In sharp contrast to non-detectable Ca2+ transport activity, fairly high thapsigargin-sensitive ATPase activities were observed with the microsomes expressing the mutants over the background level of the control microsomes at 10 µm Ca2+ (Fig.4A). This background level was 8% of the activity of microsomes expressing the wild type SERCA1a. The specific ATPase activity/mg of SERCA1a protein increased with increasing Ca2+ concentration, and reached the maximal level at 10 µm Ca2+ with the half-maximal activity at 1.0–1.2 µm Ca2+ for the three mutants and 0.4 µm Ca2+ for the wild type (Fig. 4 B). The maximal specific activities of the three mutants agreed closely with each other, and ∼1.5 times higher than that of the wild type. EP was formed from 10 µm ATP at 0 °C under conditions otherwise similar to those for the ATPase assay (Fig.5A). The amounts ofEP formed with the mutant and wild type SERCA1a at steady state increased with increasing Ca2+ concentration and reached the maximal level at 10 µm Ca2+. The half-maximal EP formation was obtained at 0.8–1.0 µm Ca2+ for the three mutants and the wild type. The maximal EP levels of the three mutants were almost the same as that of the wild type. Phosphorylation with Pi was performed in the presence of 35% (v/v) Me2SO, which greatly favors EP formation (39de Meis L. Martins O.B. Alves E.W. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4252-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The three mutants and the wild type formed almost the same maximal amounts of EP at pCa 9–7 (Fig.5 B). The EP formation was almost completely inhibited at 100 µm Ca2+ with the half-maximal inhibition at 2.3–2.9 µmCa2+. EP was formed from ATP in the presence and absence of added K+ at 0 °C and 50 µmCa2+ under conditions otherwise similar to those for the ATPase assay, and the total amount of EP and amount of ADP-insensitive EP were determined at steady state.

https://openalex.org/W2073922822,"Sensory adaptation in bacterial chemotaxis is mediated by covalent modification of chemoreceptors, specifically methylation and demethylation of glutamates catalyzed by methyltransferase CheR and methylesterase CheB. The methylesterase is a two-domain response regulator in which phosphorylation of the regulatory domain enhances activity of the catalytic domain. InEscherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, a crucial determinant of efficient methylation and demethylation is a specific pentapeptide sequence at the chemoreceptor carboxyl terminus, a position distant from sites of enzymatic action. Each enzyme binds pentapeptide, but the site of binding has been located only for CheR. Here we locate the pentapeptide-binding site on CheB by assessing catalytic activity and pentapeptide binding of CheB fragments, protection of CheB from proteolysis by pentapeptide, and interference with pentapeptide-CheB interaction by a CheB segment. The results place the binding site near the hinge between regulatory and catalytic domains, in a segment spanning the carboxyl-terminal end of the regulatory domain and the beginning of the linker that stretches to the catalytic domain. This location is quite different from the catalytic domain location of the pentapeptide-binding site on CheR and is likely to reflect the rather different ways in which pentapeptide binding enhances enzymatic action for the methyltransferase and the methylesterase.

Two of the conserved sites are created by deamidation of glutaminyl residues in a reaction catalyzed by CheB, the same enzyme that catalyzes demethylation (3Kehry M.R. Bond M.W. Hunkapiller M.W.

Thus CheB is both a methylesterase and a deamidase.Central to the chemosensory system are complexes consisting of chemoreceptor, the autophosporylating histidine kinase, CheA, and the SH3-related coupling protein, CheW (12Gegner J.A.

Interaction of kinase with receptor in the complex substantially increases the otherwise low rate of kinase autophosphorylation (14Borkovich K.A. Kaplan N. Hess J.F. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1208-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The phosphoryl group on the phosphohistidine can be transferred to an aspartyl residue on either of two response regulators, the single domain protein CheY and the two-domain enzyme CheB (15Hess J.F. Oosawa K. Kaplan N. Simon M.I. Cell. 1988; 53: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Phospho-CheY binds the flagellar rotary motor, switching rotation from the default counterclockwise direction to clockwise (16Welch M. Oosawa K. Aizawa S. Eisenbach M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8787-8791Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). CheB is phosphorylated on a regulatory domain that is structurally homologous to CheY (17Lupas A. Stock J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17337-17342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This phosphorylation activates the second domain of the enzyme (17Lupas A. Stock J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17337-17342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that catalyzes methyl ester and amide hydrolysis. Binding of chemoattractant to receptor lowers the activity of the associated kinase, reducing levels of the phosphorylated CheY and CheB (14Borkovich K.A. Kaplan N. Hess J.F. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1208-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 18Ninfa E.G. Stock A. Mowbray S. Stock J. J. Biol.

Welch M. Yanovsky A. Oosawa K. Eisenbach M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10099-10107Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, these changes are transient, because attractant binding also sets in motion the feedback loop of sensory adaptation that re-establishes the pre-stimulus rotational bias and swimming pattern. In this process an increase in receptor methylation creates a compensatory change in the receptor-kinase complex that restores CheA activity to its null, receptor-activated state (20Borkovich K.A. Alex L.A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6756-6760Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) even though the increased level of attractant persists.What factors are important for efficient adaptational modification? The side chains that are methylated and demethylated (some of which were glutamines deamidated to create methyl-accepting sites) are spaced seven apart in the receptor sequence (3Kehry M.R. Bond M.W.

This determinant, identified in studies of chemoreceptors in E. coli and S. typhimurium, is the presence at the chemoreceptor carboxyl terminus of a pentapeptide sequence, asparagine-tryptophan-glutamate-threonine-phenylalanine, NWETF in the one letter code (25Wu J.

Chemoreceptors lacking the pentapeptide naturally or as the result of engineered truncations or mutations are inefficiently methylated, demethylated, and deamidated (26Barnakov A.N. Barnakova L.A.

Stock A.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 545-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The binding site for the receptor pentapeptide is a topological insertion in the conserved fold of the catalytic domain, an insertion found specifically in chemotaxis-related methyltransferases (36Djordjevic S. Stock A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This inserted β-subdomain, containing a three-stranded β-sheet, binds the receptor pentapeptide by aligning it as a fourth strand of that β-sheet (36Djordjevic S. Stock A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In species other thanE. coli and S. typhimurium, binding of CheR to chemoreceptors has yet to be investigated, but the sequences of CheR β-subdomains and of receptor carboxyl termini co-vary from the sequences in E. coli in a way that implies a conserved interaction (36Djordjevic S. Stock A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).For the methylesterase CheB, less is known about the interaction of enzyme with the receptor pentapeptide. As a first step in learning more, we investigated the location of the NWETF-binding site. Like CheR, CheB has an amino-terminal regulatory domain and a carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain (see Fig. 1). The catalytic domains of the two enzymes are structurally and presumably evolutionarily related (37Djordjevic S. Goudreau P.N. Xu Q. Stock A.M. West A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1381-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Both are doubly wound α/β structures with a topological insertion. In CheR, this insertion is the β-sheet subdomain that binds the receptor pentapeptide (36Djordjevic S. Stock A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For CheB, the insertion is a β-hairpin positioned on the surface of the catalytic domain in the same relation to the enzyme active site as the pentapeptide-binding β-subdomain of CheR (37Djordjevic S. Goudreau P.N. Xu Q. Stock A.M. West A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1381-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Thus the β-hairpin was a candidate for the pentapeptide-binding site in CheB. We investigated the location of the pentapeptide-binding site by experiments that tested catalytic activity and pentapeptide binding of CheB fragments, protection of CheB from proteolysis by pentapeptide, and interference with NWETF-CheB interaction by short CheB peptides.DISCUSSIONIn this study we used a combination of experimental approaches to locate the site on CheB at which this two-component response regulator and methylesterase/deamidase binds the pentapeptide present at the carboxyl-terminal of chemoreceptors. The results of these different approaches provided a consistent pattern that located the pentapeptide-binding site at the juncture between the carboxyl-terminal end of α-5, the final piece of secondary structure in the regulatory domain, and the linker that connects the regulatory and catalytic domains. This location is consistent with the lack of detectable interaction between pentapeptide and the catalytic domain of CheB, assessed by functional or binding assays. The location explains the binding of a CheB fragment containing α-5, linker and catalytic domain, the lack of binding by a related fragment containing only the linker and catalytic domain, the protection by free NWETF pentapeptide of a specific tryptic site at the boundary of α-5 and linker, and the interference with pentapeptide-CheB binding by an 11-residue segment of CheB that includes the boundary between α-5 and the linker.The experimentally determined location of the pentapeptide-binding site in CheB could not have been predicted by analogy with the structurally related methyltransferase CheR. In CheR, the receptor-binding site is provided by the β-subdomain, a topological insertion in the catalytic domain. In CheB, the analogous structural unit is a β-hairpin insertion in the catalytic domain (36Djordjevic S. Stock A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). If the receptor-binding site were analogously placed on CheR and CheB, then the pentapeptide-binding site in CheB would be on the β-hairpin of the catalytic domain, not at the regulatory domain-linker boundary. Yet none of our experiments implicated the catalytic domain of CheB in receptor binding, but instead all the evidence pointed toward the carboxyl end of the regulatory domain.A difference in location of the receptor-binding site on CheR and CheB parallels other differences between interactions of the two modification enzymes with the receptor pentapeptide. In work to be reported elsewhere, we found that binding of CheB to the NWETF receptor sequence is substantially weaker than binding of CheR and that the interaction is likely to enhance enzyme action through effects on catalysis rather than enzyme recruitment. 2A. Barnakov, L. Barnakova, and G. L. Hazelbauer, manuscript in preparation. It is plausible that a binding site affecting catalysis would involve α-5 and the linker, because these parts of CheB participate in the interface between the regulatory and catalytic domain (37Djordjevic S. Goudreau P.N. Xu Q. Stock A.M. West A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1381-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 43Hughes C.A. Mandell J.G. Anand G.S. Stock A.M. Komives E.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 967-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and interaction of those two domains is likely to limit enzyme action (36Djordjevic S. Stock A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Models of how the regulatory domain controls the activity of the catalytic domain suggest that in the low activity state access of substrate to the catalytic domain is restricted by the position of the regulatory domain (37Djordjevic S. Goudreau P.N. Xu Q. Stock A.M. West A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1381-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 42Anand G.S. Goudreau P.N. Lewis J.K. Stock A.M. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 898-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Yet phosphorylation of the regulatory domain has only subtle effects on the interface between the domains (43Hughes C.A. Mandell J.G. Anand G.S. Stock A.M. Komives E.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 967-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), implying that phosphorylation-mediated enhancement of CheB action is not simply an extensive exposure of an otherwise occluded surface of the catalytic domain. Because pentapeptide-mediated enhancement of CheB action is independent of and additive with enhancement by regulatory domain phosphorylation (26Barnakov A.N. Barnakova L.A. Hazelbauer G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10667-10672Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), it could be that pentapeptide binding near the hinge between the two domains creates a separation of the domains or affects the catalytic site directly in a way not caused by phosphorylation. There is no evidence that pentapeptide binding affects CheR catalysis. Instead all observations about enhancement of CheR action by pentapeptide can be explained by considering NWETF a high affinity docking site that recruits the methyltransferase to the region of its substrate methyl-accepting residues. Thus the difference in placement of the receptor-interaction sites on the two enzymes of adaptational modification parallels a difference in functional effects.The impressive sensitivity of the chemotactic system to very small changes in concentration of attractants indicates that signaling includes a means of creating significant gain, an amplification of small differences in receptor occupancy to produce detectable responses (44Mesibov R. Adler J. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 112: 315-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Jasuja R. Keyoung J. Reid G.P. Trentham D.R. Khan S. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 1706-1719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The mechanism of this amplification is a subject of active research. A recent study implicates the enzymes of adaptational modification as crucial contributors to excitatory gain (46Kim C. Jackson M. Lux R. Khan S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 119-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The authors of this study suggest that response sensitivity could be controlled by differential binding of the modification enzymes to distinct conformations of the chemoreceptors (46Kim C. Jackson M. Lux R. Khan S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 119-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Knowledge of the sites of receptor interaction on CheB, as well as CheR, sets the stage for detailed investigation of this suggestion. The mechanistic basis of sensory adaptation and gradient sensing in bacterial chemotaxis is reversible covalent modification of chemoreceptors (1Springer M.S. Goy M.F. Adler J.

Specific glutamyl residues in the cytoplasmic domain of chemoreceptors are methylated to form carboxyl methylesters and demethylated to reform the carboxyl groups (3Kehry M.R. Bond M.W.

Two of the conserved sites are created by deamidation of glutaminyl residues in a reaction catalyzed by CheB, the same enzyme that catalyzes demethylation (3Kehry M.R. Bond M.W. Hunkapiller M.W. Dahlquist F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3599-3603Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus CheB is both a methylesterase and a deamidase. Central to the chemosensory system are complexes consisting of chemoreceptor, the autophosporylating histidine kinase, CheA, and the SH3-related coupling protein, CheW (12Gegner J.A. Graham D.R.

Nature. 1993; 365: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Interaction of kinase with receptor in the complex substantially increases the otherwise low rate of kinase autophosphorylation (14Borkovich K.A. Kaplan N. Hess J.F. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1208-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The phosphoryl group on the phosphohistidine can be transferred to an aspartyl residue on either of two response regulators, the single domain protein CheY and the two-domain enzyme CheB (15Hess J.F. Oosawa K. Kaplan N. Simon M.I. Cell. 1988; 53: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Phospho-CheY binds the flagellar rotary motor, switching rotation from the default counterclockwise direction to clockwise (16Welch M. Oosawa K. Aizawa S. Eisenbach M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8787-8791Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). CheB is phosphorylated on a regulatory domain that is structurally homologous to CheY (17Lupas A. Stock J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17337-17342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This phosphorylation activates the second domain of the enzyme (17Lupas A. Stock J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17337-17342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that catalyzes methyl ester and amide hydrolysis. Binding of chemoattractant to receptor lowers the activity of the associated kinase, reducing levels of the phosphorylated CheY and CheB (14Borkovich K.A. Kaplan N. Hess J.F. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1208-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 18Ninfa E.G. Stock A. Mowbray S. Stock J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9764-9770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reduced cellular levels of phospho-CheY shift the flagellar rotational bias and alter the pattern of swimming (19Barak R. Welch M. Yanovsky A. Oosawa K. Eisenbach M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10099-10107Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, these changes are transient, because attractant binding also sets in motion the feedback loop of sensory adaptation that re-establishes the pre-stimulus rotational bias and swimming pattern. In this process an increase in receptor methylation creates a compensatory change in the receptor-kinase complex that restores CheA activity to its null, receptor-activated state (20Borkovich K.A. Alex L.A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6756-6760Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) even though the increased level of attractant persists. What factors are important for efficient adaptational modification? The side chains that are methylated and demethylated (some of which were glutamines deamidated to create methyl-accepting sites) are spaced seven apart in the receptor sequence (3Kehry M.R. Bond M.W. Hunkapiller M.W. Dahlquist F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3599-3603Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), are on solvent-exposed surfaces of the helices of the chemoreceptor cytoplasmic domain (21Kim K.K. Yokota H. Kim S.H. Nature. 1999; 400: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), and are bracketed by sequences that share common features and influence kinetic preferences among sites (8Nowlin D.M.

This determinant, identified in studies of chemoreceptors in E. coli and S. typhimurium, is the presence at the chemoreceptor carboxyl terminus of a pentapeptide sequence, asparagine-tryptophan-glutamate-threonine-phenylalanine, NWETF in the one letter code (25Wu J. Li J. Li G. Long D.G. Weis R.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4984-4993Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 26Barnakov A.N. Barnakova L.A. Hazelbauer G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4984-4993Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and the methylesterase (26Barnakov A.N. Barnakova L.A. Hazelbauer G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10667-10672Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) bind to this sequence. Chemoreceptors lacking the pentapeptide naturally or as the result of engineered truncations or mutations are inefficiently methylated, demethylated, and deamidated (26Barnakov A.N. Barnakova L.A.

Schneider B.M. Manson M.D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 914-920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CheR has an amino-terminal regulatory domain and a carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain that exhibit structural features conserved in the family of methyltransferases (35Djordjevic S. Stock A.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 545-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The binding site for the receptor pentapeptide is a topological insertion in the conserved fold of the catalytic domain, an insertion found specifically in chemotaxis-related methyltransferases (36Djordjevic S. Stock A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This inserted β-subdomain, containing a three-stranded β-sheet, binds the receptor pentapeptide by aligning it as a fourth strand of that β-sheet (36Djordjevic S. Stock A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In species other thanE. coli and S. typhimurium, binding of CheR to chemoreceptors has yet to be investigated, but the sequences of CheR β-subdomains and of receptor carboxyl termini co-vary from the sequences in E. coli in a way that implies a conserved interaction (36Djordjevic S. Stock A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For the methylesterase CheB, less is known about the interaction of enzyme with the receptor pentapeptide. As a first step in learning more, we investigated the location of the NWETF-binding site. Like CheR, CheB has an amino-terminal regulatory domain and a carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain (see Fig. 1). The catalytic domains of the two enzymes are structurally and presumably evolutionarily related (37Djordjevic S. Goudreau P.N. Xu Q. Stock A.M. West A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1381-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Both are doubly wound α/β structures with a topological insertion. In CheR, this insertion is the β-sheet subdomain that binds the receptor pentapeptide (36Djordjevic S. Stock A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For CheB, the insertion is a β-hairpin positioned on the surface of the catalytic domain in the same relation to the enzyme active site as the pentapeptide-binding β-subdomain of CheR (37Djordjevic S. Goudreau P.N. Xu Q. Stock A.M. West A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1381-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Thus the β-hairpin was a candidate for the pentapeptide-binding site in CheB. We investigated the location of the pentapeptide-binding site by experiments that tested catalytic activity and pentapeptide binding of CheB fragments, protection of CheB from proteolysis by pentapeptide, and interference with NWETF-CheB interaction by short CheB peptides. DISCUSSIONIn this study we used a combination of experimental approaches to locate the site on CheB at which this two-component response regulator and methylesterase/deamidase binds the pentapeptide present at the carboxyl-terminal of chemoreceptors. The results of these different approaches provided a consistent pattern that located the pentapeptide-binding site at the juncture between the carboxyl-terminal end of α-5, the final piece of secondary structure in the regulatory domain, and the linker that connects the regulatory and catalytic domains. This location is consistent with the lack of detectable interaction between pentapeptide and the catalytic domain of CheB, assessed by functional or binding assays. The location explains the binding of a CheB fragment containing α-5, linker and catalytic domain, the lack of binding by a related fragment containing only the linker and catalytic domain, the protection by free NWETF pentapeptide of a specific tryptic site at the boundary of α-5 and linker, and the interference with pentapeptide-CheB binding by an 11-residue segment of CheB that includes the boundary between α-5 and the linker.The experimentally determined location of the pentapeptide-binding site in CheB could not have been predicted by analogy with the structurally related methyltransferase CheR. In CheR, the receptor-binding site is provided by the β-subdomain, a topological insertion in the catalytic domain. In CheB, the analogous structural unit is a β-hairpin insertion in the catalytic domain (36Djordjevic S. Stock A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). If the receptor-binding site were analogously placed on CheR and CheB, then the pentapeptide-binding site in CheB would be on the β-hairpin of the catalytic domain, not at the regulatory domain-linker boundary. Yet none of our experiments implicated the catalytic domain of CheB in receptor binding, but instead all the evidence pointed toward the carboxyl end of the regulatory domain.A difference in location of the receptor-binding site on CheR and CheB parallels other differences between interactions of the two modification enzymes with the receptor pentapeptide. In work to be reported elsewhere, we found that binding of CheB to the NWETF receptor sequence is substantially weaker than binding of CheR and that the interaction is likely to enhance enzyme action through effects on catalysis rather than enzyme recruitment. 2A. Barnakov, L. Barnakova, and G. L. Hazelbauer, manuscript in preparation. It is plausible that a binding site affecting catalysis would involve α-5 and the linker, because these parts of CheB participate in the interface between the regulatory and catalytic domain (37Djordjevic S. Goudreau P.N. Xu Q. Stock A.M. West A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1381-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 43Hughes C.A. Mandell J.G. Anand G.S. Stock A.M. Komives E.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 967-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and interaction of those two domains is likely to limit enzyme action (36Djordjevic S. Stock A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Models of how the regulatory domain controls the activity of the catalytic domain suggest that in the low activity state access of substrate to the catalytic domain is restricted by the position of the regulatory domain (37Djordjevic S. Goudreau P.N. Xu Q. Stock A.M. West A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1381-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 42Anand G.S. Goudreau P.N. Lewis J.K. Stock A.M. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 898-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Yet phosphorylation of the regulatory domain has only subtle effects on the interface between the domains (43Hughes C.A. Mandell J.G. Anand G.S. Stock A.M. Komives E.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 967-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), implying that phosphorylation-mediated enhancement of CheB action is not simply an extensive exposure of an otherwise occluded surface of the catalytic domain. Because pentapeptide-mediated enhancement of CheB action is independent of and additive with enhancement by regulatory domain phosphorylation (26Barnakov A.N. Barnakova L.A. Hazelbauer G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10667-10672Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), it could be that pentapeptide binding near the hinge between the two domains creates a separation of the domains or affects the catalytic site directly in a way not caused by phosphorylation. There is no evidence that pentapeptide binding affects CheR catalysis. Instead all observations about enhancement of CheR action by pentapeptide can be explained by considering NWETF a high affinity docking site that recruits the methyltransferase to the region of its substrate methyl-accepting residues. Thus the difference in placement of the receptor-interaction sites on the two enzymes of adaptational modification parallels a difference in functional effects.The impressive sensitivity of the chemotactic system to very small changes in concentration of attractants indicates that signaling includes a means of creating significant gain, an amplification of small differences in receptor occupancy to produce detectable responses (44Mesibov R. Adler J. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 112: 315-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Jasuja R. Keyoung J. Reid G.P. Trentham D.R. Khan S. Biophys.

A recent study implicates the enzymes of adaptational modification as crucial contributors to excitatory gain (46Kim C. Jackson M. Lux R. Khan S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 119-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The authors of this study suggest that response sensitivity could be controlled by differential binding of the modification enzymes to distinct conformations of the chemoreceptors (46Kim C. Jackson M. Lux R. Khan S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 119-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).

The high-affinity IL-12 receptor (IL-12R) is a heterodimer of a β1 and a β2 subunit. Expression of the signaling IL-12Rβ2 chain is usually low, as compared with the more abundant β1 chain, and may be rate-limiting for IL-12 sensitivity. Little is known about the mechanisms controllingIL-12Rβ2 gene expression. Reporter gene assays in IL-12Rβ2-expressing Jurkat cells showed that truncation of the region from −151 to −61 abrogated promoter activity. The proximal promoter region does not contain a typical TATA box, suggesting a role for SP-1. Indeed, mutagenesis of the −63 SP-1 consensus site decreased transcription by 50%. Electrophoretic mobility shift experiments confirmed the binding of SP-1 and SP-3 at this site. In contrast, truncation of −252 to −192 increased promoter activity. Likewise, mutagenesis of the consensus nuclear factor of activated T cells site at −206 increased promoter activity by 70%, suggesting silencer activity of this element. Electrophoretic mobility shift experiments with primary Th (T helper) cells showed the formation of a specific, T-cell receptor-inducible complex at this site that is sensitive to cyclosporin A and supershifted with anti-NFATc2 in both Th1 and Th2 cells. Accordingly, cyclosporin A dose-dependently increased IL-12Rβ2 mRNA expression. These first data onIL-12Rβ2 gene regulation indicate a TATA-less promoter, depending on SP-1/SP-3 transcription factors, and a negative regulatory NFAT element at −206.

The differential generation of Th cells expressing Th1 and/or Th2 cytokines is key to the outcome of both protective and pathologic immune responses (1Salgame P. Abrams J.S. Clayberger C.

Th1 cells secrete high levels of IFNγ and favor cellular immunity to intracellular pathogens, whereas Th2 cells secrete IL-4 and favor humoral immunity to extracellular pathogens (3O'Garra A. Immunity. 1998; 8: 275-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar). The polarization process of naive T cells is directed by cytokines that are present during initiation of the naive T-cell response. In this respect, IL-4 promotes Th2 cell development, whereas the antigen-presenting cell-derived cytokine IL-12 is a potent inducer of IFNγ production and of the generation of Th1 cells (4Manetti R. Gerosa F. Giudizi M.G. Biagiotti R. Parronchi P. Piccinni M.P. Sampognaro S. Maggi E. Romagnani S. Trinchieri G. J. Exp.

Immunol. 1992; 148: 2142-2147PubMed Google Scholar). For Th cells to respond to these cytokines, they need functional receptors. A functional high-affinity IL-12R is composed of two protein subunits, the IL-12Rβ1 and IL-12Rβ2 chains. In the human the β1 and β2 subunits contribute equally to IL-12 binding (6Rogge L. Barberis-Maino L. Biffi M. Passini N. Presky D.H. Gubler U. Sinigaglia F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). The β2 chain, however, appears to be rate-limiting for IL-12 responsiveness, as it is crucial for signal transduction (7Chua A.O. Chizzonite R. Desai B.B. Truitt T.P. Nunes P. Minetti L.J. Warrier R.R. Presky D.H. Levine J.F. Gately M.K. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 128-136PubMed Google Scholar) and, in contrast to the more abundant β1 chain, is expressed to a maximum of only a few hundred molecules per cell (6Rogge L. Barberis-Maino L. Biffi M. Passini N. Presky D.H. Gubler U. Sinigaglia F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that allergen-specific Th2 cell clones generated from atopic patients revealed a complete lack of signaling via the IL-12R, as indicated by their inability to phosphorylate STAT4 (8Hilkens C.M. Messer G. Tesselaar K. van Rietschoten A.G. Kapsenberg M.L. Wierenga E.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4316-4321PubMed Google Scholar) and to secrete IFNγ in response to IL-12. Rogge et al. (6Rogge L. Barberis-Maino L. Biffi M. Passini N. Presky D.H. Gubler U. Sinigaglia F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) showed that development of naive T cells into Th2 cells is associated with IL-4-mediated suppression of IL-12Rβ2 mRNA and protein expression leading to the loss of IL-12 responsiveness and, consequently, the inability of IL-12 to promote IFNγ production (9Rogge L. Papi A. Presky D.H. Biffi M. Minetti L.J. Miotto Agostini C. Semenzato G. Fabbri L.M. Sinigaglia F. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3926-3932PubMed Google Scholar). As IL-12 responsiveness is a major parameter in the regulation of specific immunity, we started to unravel the molecular mechanisms that govern the transcriptional regulation of theIL-12Rβ2 gene in human Th cells. To this aim, we cloned 0.6 kilobase of the 5′ flanking region and, by serial truncation, tested for promoter activity applying a reporter gene assay in IL-12Rβ2-expressing Jurkat T cells. In this report we provide the first experimental evidence that SP-1 family members are important for basal and inducible activity of the TATA-less core promoter of the IL-12Rβ2 gene and that the inducible transcription factor NFATc2 binding at −206 has a suppressive role in IL-12Rβ2 expression. This suppressive activity does not underlie the loss of IL-12Rβ2 expression in Th2 cells. Restriction enzymes and T4 ligase were purchased from Promega (Leiden, The Netherlands). All high pressure liquid chromatography-purified oligonucleotides were purchased from BIOSOURCE (Nivelles, Belgium).BstEII-digested λ DNA (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) was used as a molecular weight reference. Clone pAC188 containing IL-12Rβ2-encoding genomic DNA was selected by screening a human genomic pAC library (Genome Technology Center, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands) using IL-12Rβ2 cDNA (+781 to +3229) as a probe. Starting from IL-12Rβ2 exon 1, clone pAC188 was sequenced in the 5′ direction. A fragment spanning −591 to +54 (relative to the start of the reported cDNA sequence (10Presky D.H. Yang H. Minetti L.J. Chua A.O. Nabavi N. Wu C.Y. Gately M.K. Gubler U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Scie. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14002-14007Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar)), designated construct −591, was amplified by PCR using the pAC188 plasmid as a template. For cloning purposes, the 5′-sense primers were designed with an additional SacI restriction site and the 3′-antisense primer with a natural HincII site, resulting in PCR products spanning through +54. Serial deletion fragments, designated −404 (−404 to +54), −252 (−252 to +54), −192 (−192 to +54), −151 (−151 to +54), −61 (−61 to +54), and −36 (−36 to +54), were generated by varying the 5′-sense primer (Table I). The PCR products were subcloned into the pGEM®-T Easy plasmid (Promega) following the directions of the manufacturer. All constructs were checked by DNA sequencing using Thermo Sequenase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) on an ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For transfection studies pGL3-enhancer (pGL3e) vector (Promega) was used, which contains the Firefly luciferase gene. The cloned PCR products and the pGL3e vector (Promega) were digested with SacI and HincII orSacI and SmaI, respectively, agarose gel-purified (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and ligated with T4 DNA ligase (Promega). pGL3e constructs were checked by sequencing. Plasmid DNA was prepared from bacterial cultures using Qiagen Plasmid Midi Kits.Table IOligonucleotides used in this studyDescriptionaS, sense oligonucleotide; AS, anti-sense oligonucleotide.LocationbLocation, represents the location of the oligonucleotide in the IL-12Rβ2 gene relative to the reported start of the mRNA (10). n.a., not applicable for these oligonucleotides.PurposecMut, LC, oligonucleotide used, respectively, for mutagenesis or Light Cycler.Primer sequencesdAppropriate transcription factor core-binding elements are underlined; dinucleotide substitutions in the mutant (Mut) relative to the corresponding wildtype (WT) probes are indicated in italics; bold nucleotides represent 5′ overhang used to fill in by Klenow fragment the double-stranded oligo with [α-32P]dATP and d(C/G/T)TP.−591 −591 to −572Cloning5′ gcgcgagctcgatatctaaataaaatctct 3′−404 −404 to −384Cloning5′ gcgcgagctcggcctgtattccctgcacttt 3′−252 −252 to −231Cloning5′ gcgcgagctcgaatattatgcagagctgccga 3′−192 −192 to −171Cloning5′ gcgcgagctcaacaccacttataacacgga 3′−151 −151 to −133Cloning5′ gcgcgagctcgccatctgttcaagttta 3′−61 −61 to −44Cloning5′ gcgcgagctcggtcttgtgcacagccc 3′−36 −36 to −17Cloning5′ gcgcgagctcaggcctcggcgctcaggtgt 3′AS +34 to +54Cloning5′ gcgcgttgacagccatcagggaact 3′NFAT WT −224 to −184EMSA5′ tgtactctgggcagttttccctcttgcctgagaacaccact 3′NFAT Mut −224 to −184Mut/EMSA5′ tgtactctgggcagttttaa ctcttgcctgagaacaccact 3′SP-1#1 Mut −17 to +9Mut5′ tggtaagagctgttcggtgcagagca 3′SP-1#2 WT −81 to −44EMSA5′ tctgcccgcactccagtgggcggtcttgtgcacagccc 3′SP-1#2 Mut −75 to −50Mut5′ cgcactccagtgttcggtcttgtgca 3′SP-1#2 Mut −81 to −44EMSA5′ tctgcccgcactccagtgttcggtcttgtgcacagccc 3′SP-1 HSVn.a.EMSA5′ ccggccccgcccatccccggccccgcccatcc 3′NF-κBn.a.EMSA5′ agttgaggggactttcccaggc 3′IL-12Rβ1 Sn.a.RT-PCR5′ cctgaaaaccccccacag 3′IL-12Rβ1 ASn.a.RT-PCR5′ taacacttttcctgccccat 3′IL-12Rβ2 S+1146 to +1166RT-PCR; LC5′ ggcagaagcaatgtaaagaca 3′IL-12Rβ2 AS+1466 to +1486RT-PCR; LC5′ ccagcaaatcatgtcttcctt 3′IL-2 Sn.a.LC5′ gtcacaaacagtgcacctac 3′IL-2 ASn.a.LC5′ atggttgctgtctcatcagc 3′β2m Sn.a.RT-PCR; LC5′ ccagcagagaatggaaagtc 3′β2m ASn.a.RT-PCR; LC5′ gatgctgcttacatgtctcg 3′a S, sense oligonucleotide; AS, anti-sense oligonucleotide.b Location, represents the location of the oligonucleotide in the IL-12Rβ2 gene relative to the reported start of the mRNA (10Presky D.H.

Open table in a new tab Site-directed mutagenesis of the IL-12Rβ2 −591 to +54 promoter construct was carried out using the Altered Sites II in vitro mutagenesis system from Promega. All reactions were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. The internal forward primers containing the mutated sites are shown in Table I. Products from this procedure were cloned into pGL3e and sequenced to confirm the introduction of the desired mutations. Jurkat cells (5 × 10) (6Rogge L. Barberis-Maino L. Biffi M. Passini N. Presky D.H. Gubler U. Sinigaglia F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) expressing both IL-12Rβ1 and IL-12Rβ2 were electroporated in the presence of 20 μg of plasmid DNA in 0.5 ml of cytomix, as described previously (11van den Hoff M.J.B. Christoffels V.M. Labruyere W.T. Moorman A.F.M. Lamers W.H Meth. Mol. Biol. 1995; 48: 185-197PubMed Google Scholar), in a 0.4-cm gap electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad) at 310 V, 900 microfarads using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). To monitor transfection efficiency, 250 ng of pRL-CMV, an expression vector containing the Renilla luciferase gene under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter (Promega), was added to each sample. To compensate for size differences of the constructs, empty pGL3e vector was added to obtain an equal amount of DNA in each sample. Immediately after transfection, 9.5 ml of complete culture medium was added (Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium, BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 5% pooled, C-inactivated fetal calf serum (BioWhittaker) and gentamycin (80 μg/ml; Duchafa, Haarlem, The Netherlands). Cells were seeded in 2 wells of a 6-well culture plate (Costar, Cambridge, MA). After 1 day of culture at 37 °C, cells were either left unstimulated or stimulated for 24 h with 1 ng/ml PMA and 1 μg/ml ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) or with mouse mAbs to CD3 (1 μg/ml; CLB-T3/4E) and CD28 (2 μg/ml; CLB-CD28/1), both obtained from the Central Laboratory of the Netherlands Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service (CLB, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection. Using the Dual Luciferase reporter gene assay (Promega), cell lysates were prepared and both Firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase were measured by a dual luminometer (Promega). Luciferase activities were normalized for transfection efficiency using Renilla luciferase activity. Transfections were performed in duplicate, and the results of at least three independent experiments were calculated as the mean ± S.D. values for luciferase activity. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy individuals were isolated by density gradient centrifugation on Lymphoprep (Nycomed, Torshov, Norway). Highly purified CD4+T cells (normally >98% as assessed by flow cytometry) were obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells with anti-CD4-coated Dynabeads (Dynal AS, Oslo, Norway) as described before (12Vieira P.L. Kalinski P. Wierenga E.A. Kapsenberg M.L. de Jong E.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5245-5251PubMed Google Scholar). CD45RA+CD45RO− naive Th cells were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells through one-step high-affinity negative selection columns (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK). Naive Th cells were stimulated under Th1 or Th2 driving conditions in IL-12 and IL-4, respectively, as described before (13Smits H.H. van Rietschoten J.G.I. Hilkens C.M. Sayilir R. Stiekema F.E. Kapsenberg M.L. Wierenga E.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 1055-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) to generate highly polarized Th1 and Th2 cells. To test the effect of CsA on IL-12Rβ2 mRNA expression, naive Th cells were stimulated for 3 days with immobilized CD3 mAb and soluble CD28 mAb (13Smits H.H. van Rietschoten J.G.I. Hilkens C.M. Sayilir R. Stiekema F.E. Kapsenberg M.L. Wierenga E.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 1055-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) in 96-well culture plates (Costar; 10 (5) cells/well) with or without CsA at increasing concentrations (10–1000 ng/ml). All T-cell cultures were grown in complete culture medium with rIL-2 (10 units/ml; Chiron, Emeryville, CA). Proliferative responses were assayed in parallel cultures of 2 × 10 (4) cells/well after 3 days as described before (12Vieira P.L. Kalinski P. Wierenga E.A. Kapsenberg M.L. de Jong E.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5245-5251PubMed Google Scholar). Whole cell protein extracts were prepared from 5 × 106 CD4+ T cells. Nuclear protein extracts were prepared from 5 × 106cells CD4+, Th1, or Th2 cells, which were left unstimulated or were stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 for 30 min in the presence or absence of cyclosporin A (CsA; 1 μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Nuclear and whole cell protein extracts were isolated essentially as described before (8Hilkens C.M. Messer G. Tesselaar K. van Rietschoten A.G. Kapsenberg M.L. Wierenga E.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4316-4321PubMed Google Scholar), and the protein concentrations were determined by a Bradford microassay (Bio-Rad) using a calibrated solution of bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich) as a reference. The samples were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed as described before (8Hilkens C.M. Messer G. Tesselaar K. van Rietschoten A.G. Kapsenberg M.L. Wierenga E.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4316-4321PubMed Google Scholar) with some minor modifications. The double-stranded DNA probe was [α-32P]dATP-labeled using the Prime-a-gene labeling system (Promega) and purified using Bio-Spin 6 chromatography columns (Bio-Rad). The binding reaction was incubated at 4 °C for 45 min. Cold competitor oligonucleotides were added to the reaction mix prior to the protein extract. The SP-1 consensus sequence, binding SP-1 family members, is derived from human herpesvirus. The NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The nomenclature and sequences of the oligonucleotides used in this study are summarized in Table I. For supershift experiments, 4 μg of IgG1 mAb NFATc1 (sc-7294, Santa Cruz), 0.5 μg of IgG1 mAb NFATc2 (BD Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA), 0.4 μg of polyclonal IgG SP-1 antibody (sc-59-G, Santa Cruz), 4 μg of IgG1 mAb SP-3 (sc-644-G, Santa Cruz), or a nonrelevant IgG1 isotype control were added to the binding reaction for an additional 45 min at 4 °C. The whole sample was then loaded onto a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris/borate/EDTA buffer. The gels were prerun for 30 min and then run for 2 h at RT at 150 V. The gels were transferred to Whatman filter paper, dried, and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak XAR5 films, Rochester, NY) at −80 °C. RT-PCR was performed as described before (14van Rietschoten J.G.I. Smits H.H. Westland R. Verweij C.L. den Hartog M.T. Wierenga E.A. Immunogenetics. 2000; 51: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) with IL-12Rβ1-, IL-12Rβ2-, and β2-microglobulin (β2m)-specific primers (Table I). For quantitative analysis of IL-12Rβ2 mRNA expression, naive Th cells were stimulated as described above and lysed for total RNA extraction at day 3 using a Nucleo Spin RNA isolation kit (Macherey-Nagel, Duren, Germany). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using a cDNA synthesis kit (MBI-Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany). Real-time quantitative PCR was performed in a Light-Cycler (Roche Diagnostics, Almere, The Netherlands) based on specific primers and general fluorescence detection with SYBR green. β2m was used as a control. The primer sequences for IL-12Rβ2 (melting temperature 60 °C), IL-2 (melting temperature 58 °C) and β2m (melting temperature 60 °C) are listed in TableI. Measurement of IL-13 levels in culture supernatants were performed using the PeliKine compact human IL-13 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit obtained from the CLB. To characterize the proximal promoter of the human IL-12Rβ2 gene, we analyzed 0.6 kilobase of 5′ flanking sequence obtained from a genomic pAC clone. This fragment, which is depicted in Fig. 1 A, spans the region −591 through +54 relative to the start of the IL-12Rβ2 cDNA (10Presky D.H. Yang H. Minetti L.J. Chua A.O. Nabavi N. Wu C.Y. Gately M.K. Gubler U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Scie. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14002-14007Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). In the immediate 5′ region, no typical TATA box or CCAAT box motif was found. To identify the corepromoter and regulatory elements, the transcriptional activity of the truncated constructs of the IL-12Rβ2 5′ upstream region (Fig.2 A) were assayed. For that purpose, full-length construct −591 and a series of 5′ deletion fragments were subcloned into the pGL3-Enhancer vector, a promoterless luciferase reporter vector with an SV40 enhancer. All constructs were tested for promoter activity in unstimulated and PMA/ionomycin-stimulated conditions in Jurkat T cells, showing constitutive expression of the IL-12Rβ1 chain and low but inducible expression of the IL-12Rβ2 chain (Fig. 2 B). The expression of the IL-12Rβ2 chain in Jurkat cells has been described (15Yokoe T. Suzuki N. Minoguchi K. Adachi M. Sakane T. Cell. Immunol. 2001; 208: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Promoter activity was up-regulated in stimulated cells transfected with constructs −591, −404, −252, −192, and −151. Deletion from −591 to −404 and further to −252 reduced the reporter activity stepwise, suggesting multiple positive cis-acting elements between −591 and −252. Interestingly, deletion from −252 to −192 led to an increase in promoter activity, suggesting the presence of a suppressor element(s) in this region. Promoter activity was abrogated after truncation to −61 and −36, indicating that sequences in close upstream proximity of −61 are crucial for basal and inducible IL-12Rβ2 promoter activity. Similar results were found upon stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (data not shown).Figure 2Reporter gene analysis of the IL-12R β2 proximal promoter. A, the 5′deletion fragments of the IL-12Rβ2 promoter, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” were linked to the Firefly luciferase reporter gene (Luc). The fusion constructs were transiently transfected into Jurkat cells. One day after transfection, cells were either or not stimulated with PMA/ionomycin for 24 h. Luciferase activity values are corrected for transfection efficiency (Renilla luciferase) and DNA amount (empty vector was added to compensate for size differences between constructs), and are expressed as relative luciferase activity units, shown in this and subsequent figures as the mean ± S.D. of at least three independent duplicate experiments. In addition to deletion fragments, pGL3e (empty vector) is shown as a control. B, RT-PCR analysis of IL-12Rβ1, IL-12Rβ2, and β2m mRNA expression in Jurkat T cells.

Gene. 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar)) are located in the proximal promoter region at −3 and −63 (Fig.1 B). As SP-1 is frequently involved in transcription initiation in the absence of a TATA box (16Suske P. Gene. 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar), we analyzed whether these DNA motifs at −3 (SP-1#1) and −63 (SP-1#2) participate in the regulation of IL-12Rβ2 promoter activity. To examine the relative roles of these two SP-1 sites for promoter activity, we mutated the GGGCGG motifs in these elements to GTTCGG in the context of the full-length promoter construct −591. We thus generated two IL-12Rβ2 –591 to +54 promoter-reporter gene constructs with either one of the SP-1 sites mutated. Promoter activity was tested after transient transfection of Jurkat cells and compared with the wild type full-length IL-12Rβ2 promoter activity. As shown in Fig.3, mutation of the SP-1#1 site at −3 does not result in a significant change of activity, whereas mutation of the SP-1#2 site at −63 results in a reduction of promoter activity by almost 50%, suggesting an important role of thiscis-regulatory element. As determined by serial truncation, deletion of the promoter region from −252 to −192 resulted in increased promoter activity. Within this region a reversed NFAT consensus binding site (TTTCC) is located at −206. To examine the functional significance of this NFAT consensus site, we mutated the TTTCC motif into TTTAA in the context of the full-length promoter construct −591. Promoter activity was tested after transient transfection of Jurkat cells and compared with the wild type construct −591. As shown in Fig. 3, a 70% increase of promoter activity was observed with the mutated construct, suggesting that the putative NFAT binding element at −206 has a negative cis-regulatory role in IL-12Rβ2 transcription. To characterize transcription factor binding activities at the SP-1#2 element at −63, we performed EMSAs using whole cell extracts from CD4+ T cells. EMSA with the double-stranded oligonucleotide SP-1#2 WT containing the intact −63 SP-1 element demonstrated the formation of two DNA-protein complexes C1 and C2 (Fig.4, lane 1) not formed in the absence of protein extract (data not shown). The formation of these radioactive complexes was dose-dependently inhibited by competition with a 10-, 30-, or 90-fold molar excess of unlabeled SP-1#2 WT oligonucleotide (lanes 2–4) but was not affected by a 90-fold molar excess of the mutated SP-1#2 Mut oligonucleotide (lane 5). Similar to the SP-1#2 WT oligonucleotide, competition with a 10-, 30-, and 90-fold molar excess of a specific SP-1 consensus oligonucleotide dose-dependently competed the bands away (lane 6–8), whereas a 90-fold molar excess of an oligonucleotide containing a nonrelevant NF-κB consensus binding site had no effect (lane 9). SP-1 and SP-3 are known to bind to identical DNA elements (17Lania L. Majello B. De Luca P. Int. J. Bioch. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1313-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Therefore, binding reactions were performed in the presence of anti-SP-1, anti-SP-3, or both antibodies. The addition of anti-SP-1 antibody resulted in a supershift of most of complex C1 (Fig. 4, lane 11), whereas with anti-SP-3 antibody, a complete supershift was observed of the less abundant complex C2 (lane 12). The combination of both anti-SP-1 and anti-SP-3 antibodies did not result in additional shifts. These results suggest the binding of SP-1 and SP-3 at the −63 element. We next tested whether NFAT could actually interact with the putative binding site at −206 in the IL-12Rβ2 promoter. To this aim, we used the −220 to −180 DNA sequence as a double-stranded probe for EMSA. Nuclear extracts from anti-CD3/anti-CD28-stimulated CD4+ T cells showed the inducible formation of complex A in addition to the increased intensity of a preexisting complex P (Fig.5 A, lanes 3 and4). The formation of complexes A and P was abrogated by mutation of the probe (TTTCC to TTTAA; data not shown). Activation of the CD4+ T cells in the presence of the immunosuppressant drug CsA, known to inhibit the nuclear translocation of NFAT, inhibited the formation of complex A but not P (Fig. 5 B, lane 5). These results indeed suggest the involvement of NFAT in complex formation with the −206 element. Of the growing family of NFAT proteins, NFATc1 (NFATc, NFAT2) and NFATc2 (NFATp, NFAT1) are most prominent in peripheral T cells (18Kuo C.T. Leiden J.M. Ann. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 149-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) and bind to the same DNA motif (19Hoey T. Sun Y.L. Williamson K. Xu W.

To identify whether NFATc1 or NFATc2 is involved in complex A, binding reactions were performed in the presence of antibodies to NFATc1 or NFATc2. A supershifted band (S) was obtained with NFATc2 antibody (Fig. 5 A, lane 7) but not with antibody to NFATc1 (Fig. 5 A, lane 6) or with the IgG1 isotype control antibody (data not shown), indicating the inducible binding of NFATc2 at −206. Because expression of the IL-12Rβ2 gene is suppressed in Th2 cells and NFATc2 plays a role in the suppression of Th2-type cytokines (21Xanthoudakis S. Viola J.P.B. Shaw K.T.Y. Luo C. Wallace L.D.

Immunity. 1996; 4: 397-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), we next tested for differential binding activity of NFATc2 to the −206 element comparing nuclear extracts from Th1 and Th2 cells. However, neither in unstimulated nor in anti-CD3/anti-CD28 stimulated cells any difference was observed between Th1 and Th2 cell extracts (Fig. 5 B). Preexisting complex P showed a similar increased intensity in Th1 and Th2 cells after TCR stimulation. Also, complex A was induced to the same extent in TCR-stimulated Th1 cells (lanes 1 and 2) and Th2 cells (lanes 5 and 6). Both in Th1 and Th2 extracts, complex A was supershifted with anti-NFATc2 (lanes 4 and 5 and 7 and 8). The isotype control is shown in lane 9. The data so far suggested a general suppressive role of NFATc2 in the regulation of IL-12Rβ2 expression, not discriminating between Th1 and Th2 cells. To test the role of NFAT in a more physiological system, naive T cells were stimulated for 3 days with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 in the presence of increasing concentrations of CsA. The mRNA expression of IL-12Rβ2, IL-2, and β2m was measured by real-time PCR. The levels of IL-12Rβ2 and IL-2 mRNA were normalized based on β2m mRNA levels in the same samples. Both IL-2 mRNA expression level, known to be inhibited by CsA (23Manger B. Hardy K.J. Weiss A. Stobo J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1501-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and IL-13 protein secretion, known to be enhanced by CsA (24Van der Pouw Kraan T.C. Kraan T.C. Boeije L.C. Troon J.T. Rutschmann S.K. Wijdenes Aarden L.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1818-1823PubMed Google Scholar), were used as controls. As expected from the EMSA data, CsA dose-dependently increased IL-12Rβ2 mRNA expression (Fig. 6 A), confirming the suppressive role of NFAT herein. Furthermore, the IL-2 mRNA expression was decreased (Fig. 6 A), and the IL-13 protein secretion was increased (Fig. 6 B) in the presence of increasing doses of CsA. In this report, we have described the first data on the transcriptional regulation of the human IL-12Rβ2 gene. The proximal promoter region was cloned and functionally characterized. The data indicate a TATA-less promoter, dependent on SP-1 family protein binding at −63, and a silencer NFAT element at −206, which binds NFATc2 and is involved in suppressing TCR-induced IL-12Rβ2 expression. The pGL3e vector in which the promoter fragments were cloned contains an SV-40 enhancer located upstream of the luciferase gene. The enhancer element normally increases reporter gene expression provided that the promoter is active. Deletion from −151 to −61 resulted in fully abrogated transcription, even in the presence of the enhancer, underlining the critical role of this region in transcription initiation. The core promoter, which drives TCR-induced transcription (construct −151), does not contain a TATA or CAAT box. In the absence of a TATA box, SP-1 binding motifs are frequently involved in alternative initiation of transcription (25Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Pierce A.J. Wade M. Crit. Rev. Eukar. Gene Expr. 1993; 3: 229-254PubMed Google Scholar, 26Dynan W.S. Tjian R. Cell. 1983; 35: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). This seems to apply for theIL-12Rβ2 gene as well, as it contains a functional SP-1/3 binding motif in its core promoter. Genes with TATA-less promoters, including many so-called “housekeeping” and receptor genes, are generally expressed at low levels (27Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). Indeed, even fully IL-12-responsive Th1 cells were shown to express only a few hundred IL-12Rβ2 molecules on their membrane (6Rogge L. Barberis-Maino L. Biffi M. Passini N. Presky D.H. Gubler U. Sinigaglia F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). The IL-12Rβ2gene contains a GC-rich (±75%) 5′ noncoding region (10Presky D.H. Yang H. Minetti L.J. Chua A.O. Nabavi N. Wu C.Y. Gately M.K. Gubler U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Scie. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14002-14007Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), which may, at least in part, explain the low rate of expression of these molecules, as GC-rich 5′ noncoding regions are known to hamper translation (27Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). However, data on the translational regulation of the IL-12Rβ2 mRNA are not available yet. We show here that IL-12Rβ2 expression is inhibited at the transcriptional level. The NFAT element at −206 specifically binds NFATc2 and seems to be important for a general down-regulation of TCR-inducible IL-12Rβ2 gene expression. The availability and suppressive activity of NFATc2 does not discriminate between Th1 and Th2 cells and thus does not explain the loss of expression of the IL-12Rβ2 chain in Th2 cells. The relative importance of the negative regulatory role of this element is underlined by the observation that CsA increases IL-12Rβ2 mRNA expression in stimulated naive Th cells, i.e. in the context of fully intact regulatory regions, instead of the cloned proximal 591 base pairs of the promoter. The absence of further NFAT sites in the region, at least up to −1.2 kilobases (data not shown), further indicates this particular site as the mediator of the CsA-sensitive suppressive effect. Similar negative regulatory effects of NFATc2 have been implicated in the regulation of several Th2 type cytokine genes in the mouse (21Xanthoudakis S. Viola J.P.B. Shaw K.T.Y. Luo C. Wallace L.D. Bozza P.T. Curran T. Rao A. Science. 1996; 272: 892-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 22Hodge M.R. Ranger A.M. de la Brousse F.C. Hoey T. Grusby M.J. Glimcher L.H. Immunity. 1996; 4: 397-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Indirect data on the regulation of the humanIL-13 gene points in the same direction (24Van der Pouw Kraan T.C. Kraan T.C. Boeije L.C. Troon J.T. Rutschmann S.K. Wijdenes Aarden L.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1818-1823PubMed Google Scholar). The present data are the first to suggest a suppressor function of NFATc2 in the regulation of a gene associated with Th1-type responses. Whether or not this site contributes to the polarization process of Th cells under Th1 or Th2 driving conditions is unclear thus far, as sites directly involved in the Th2-specific suppression of the IL-12Rβ2gene have not been identified yet. Our present data give no indication for differential NFATc2 activity at −206 in Th1 and Th2 cells. Instead, NFATc2 may play a role in the general low expression rate (6Rogge L. Barberis-Maino L. Biffi M. Passini N. Presky D.H. Gubler U. Sinigaglia F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) or the kinetics of IL-12Rβ2 gene expression, in particular in the shut-down of expression at later time points after TCR triggering as has been suggested in the regulation of IL-4gene expression (28Ranger A.M. Oukka M. Rengarajan J. Glimcher L.H. Immunity. 1998; 9: 627-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). It is to be expected that several Th1- or Th2-specific transcription factors do play a role in IL-12Rβ2 gene transcription either in a direct or an indirect way. For example, IL-12 strongly up-regulates IL-12Rβ2 expression through phosphorylation of STAT4 (6Rogge L. Barberis-Maino L. Biffi M. Passini N. Presky D.H. Gubler U. Sinigaglia F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Therefore, STAT4 binding sites are expected to be located in the enhancer region further upstream as has been suggested before (29Sinigaglia F. D'Ambrosio D. Panina-Bordignon P. Rogge L. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 170: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Another transcription factor which may be directly involved inIL-12Rβ2 gene regulation is the recently identified, Th1-specific T-box transcription factor, T-bet (30Szabo S.J. Kim S.T. Costa G.L. Zhang X. Fathman C.G. Glimcher L.H. Cell. 2000; 100: 655-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2710) Google Scholar). T-bet is up-regulated by IL-12 and accounts for the Th1-specific expression of IFNγ and repression of the opposing Th2 programs, at least in the mouse. In contrast, GATA-3, a Th2-specific and IL-4-induced transcription factor (31Zheng W.P. Flavell R.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 587-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar), may be involved in the direct suppression of the IL-12Rβ2 gene. Indeed, Ouyang et al. (32Ouyang W. Ranganath S.H. Weindel K. Bhattacharya D. Murphy T.L. Sha W.C. Murphy K.M. Immunity. 1998; 9: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar) demonstrated a decrease in IL-12Rβ2 mRNA expression after ectopic expression of GATA-3 into differentiated murine Th1 cells. We are currently investigating the role of Th1- and Th2-specific transcription factors in human IL-12Rβ2 gene expression. We thank Ing. J. Wormmeester for technical support and Drs. J. L. M.

Natural HLA-B27 ligands derived from polymorphic regions of its own or other class I HLA molecules might be involved in autoimmunity or provide diversity among HLA-B27-bound peptide repertoires from individuals. In particular, an 11-mer spanning HLA-B27 residues 169–179 is a natural HLA-B27 ligand with homology to proteins from Gram-negative bacteria. Proteasomal digestion of synthetic substrates demonstrated direct generation of the B27-(169–179) ligand. Cleavage after residue 181 generated a B27-(169–181) 13-mer that was subsequently found as a natural ligand of B*2705 and B*2704. Its binding to HLA-B27 subtypes in vivo correlated better than B27-(169–179) with association to spondyloarthropathy. Proteasomal cleavage generated also a peptide spanning B*2705 residues 150–158. This region is polymorphic among HLA-B27 subtypes and class I HLA antigens. The peptide was a natural B*2704 ligand. Since this subtype differs from B*2705 at residue 152, it was concluded that the ligand arose from HLA-B*3503, synthesized in the cells used as a source for B*2704-bound peptides. Thus, polymorphic HLA-B27 ligands derived from HLA-B27 or other class I molecules are directly produced by the 20 S proteasome in vitro, and this can be used for identification of such ligands in the constitutive HLA-B27-bound peptide pool.

Peptides are transported into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by means of the TAP (transporter associated with antigen processing) transporter and bind to nascent class I molecules in a process assisted by tapasin and other chaperones (1Cresswell P. Bangia N. Dick T. Diedrich G. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 172: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The class I molecule, composed of the MHC heavy chain, β2m, and peptide, is then exported to the cell surface where it can be recognized by cytolytic T lymphocytes. Proteasomes are multicatalytic complexes located in the nucleus and cytosol. In eukaryotic cells their catalytic core, or 20 S proteasome, consists of 28 subunits organized in heptameric sets to build a four-ring barrel structure. Each of the external rings contains seven noncatalytic α subunits, whereas each of the internal rings contains seven β subunits, three of which, β1, β2 and β5, are catalytic (2Groll M. Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1939) Google Scholar). In vertebrates these subunits can be cooperatively replaced by homologous interferon-γ-induced subunits β1i, β2i, and β5i, to form the immunoproteasome (3Griffin T.A. Nandi D. Cruz M. Fehling H.J.

The 20 S catalytic core, when bound to the PA700 (19 S) activator, results in the 26 S proteasome, which is involved in ATP-dependent digestion of ubiquitinated proteins (4Rechsteiner M. Hoffman L.

Some of these appear to be associated with a single subunit: trypsin-like with β2, chymotrypsin-like with β5, and postglutamyl activity with β1 (12Heinemeyer W. Fischer M. Krimmer T. Stachon U.

It has been suggested that proteasomes tend to generate the exact C-terminal ends of class I ligands, but are less precise at the N terminus, thus generating N-terminally extended precursors (30Mo X.Y.

Another issue is that proteasomes may cleave peptide bonds internal to the sequence of natural ligands, leading to their destruction (18Ossendorp F. Eggers M. Neisig A. Ruppert T. Groettrup M.

The balance between cleavage leading to generation or destruction of a given peptide may determine its presence or influence its amount in the class I-bound pool. HLA-B27 has special interest for its strong association with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and reactive arthritis (ReA) (34Brewerton D.A. Hart F.D. Nicholls A. Caffrey M. James D.C. Sturrock R.D.

A. 1997; 94: 1896-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), and HLA-B27 seems to misfold more than other HLA class I proteins (39Mear J.P. Schreiber K.L. Münz C. Zhu X. Stevanovic S. Rammensee H.G. Rowland-Jones S.L. Colbert R.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6665-6670PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is not known what peptides derived from class I molecules are HLA-B27 ligands, whether these peptides are directly produced by the proteasome, or whether proteasomal cleavage of class I molecules can be used to predict novel natural ligands of HLA-B27. To address these issues we focused on two regions of the α2 domain: around residues 169–179 and around residues 150–158. The first region has homology with protein sequences from Gram-negative bacteria (47Scofield R.H. Kurien B. Gross T. Warren W.L. Harley J.B. Lancet. 1995; 345: 1542-1544Abstract PubMed Google Scholar). It was postulated that molecular mimicry between bacterial proteins and a peptide derived from this region of the HLA-B27 molecule and presented by HLA-B27 could elicit autoreactivity upon bacterial infection and play a role in the pathogenesis of ReA and other spondyloarthropathies. A natural ligand of HLA-B27, spanning residues 169–179 of its own molecule, herein designated as B27-(169–179), was subsequently found in B*2705 and other HLA-B27 subtypes (48Boisgérault F. Tieng V. Stolzenberg M.C. Dulphy N. Khalil I. Tamouza R. Charron D. Toubert A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2764-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 49Garcia F. Marina A. Albar J.P. Lopez de Castro J.A. Tissue Antigens. 1997; 49: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The second region is polymorphic among class I molecules and could provide information about polymorphic HLA-B27 ligands derived from other class I proteins. These peptides would be presented by some, but not all, HLA-B27-positive individuals and could be a source of antigenic diversity of HLA-B27 dependent on the non-B27 HLA class I type of the individual. Synthetic peptides were synthesized using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry and purified by HPLC. The correct molecular mass of purified peptides was established by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS), and their quantification was done by amino acid analysis after hydrolysis in 6 m HCl. In cysteine-containing peptides this residue was incorporated as carboxymethyl-Cys during synthesis. HMy2-C1R (C1R) is a class I-deficient human plasma cell line with low expression of its endogenous HLA-B*3503 and -Cw4 class I antigens (50Zemmour J. Little A.M. Schendel D.J. Parham P. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1941-1948PubMed Google Scholar). Transfectants expressing high levels of B*2705 or other HLA-B27 subtypes were used as the source of HLA-B27-bound peptides. These cells were cultured in DMEM with 7.5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (both from Life Technologies, Paisley, United Kingdom). Isolation of HLA-B27-bound peptides was done as described previously (51Paradela A. Garcia-Peydro M. Vázquez J. Rognan D. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5481-5490PubMed Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, 1–1.5 × 1010 HLA-B27 transfectant cells were lysed at 4 °C in 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40 (pH 7.5) with a mixture of protease inhibitors. After centrifugation, cell lysates were subjected to affinity chromatography using the W6/32 monoclonal antibody (IgG2a, specific for a monomorphic HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C determinant (52Barnstable C.J. Bodmer W.F. Brown G. Galfre G. Milstein C. Williams A.F. Ziegler A. Cell. 1978; 14: 9-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar). HLA-B27-bound peptides were eluted with 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid at room temperature, filtered through Centricon 3 (Amicon, Beverly, MA), and concentrated to 100 µl for HPLC fractionation. This was conducted in a Waters Alliance system (Waters, Milford, MA) using a Vydac C18 (0.21 × 25 cm) 5-µm particle size column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) at a flow rate of 100 µl/min, as follows: isocratic conditions with buffer A (0.08% trifluoroacetic acid in water) for 15 min, followed by a linear gradient of 0–44% buffer B (80% acetonitrile and 0.075% trifluoroacetic acid in water) for 90 min, and a linear gradient of 44–100% buffer B for another 35 min. Peptide fractionation was simultaneously monitored at 210 and 280 nm. Fractions of 50 µl were collected and stored at −20 °C. The 20 S proteasome was purified from B*2705-C1R cell lysates by ion-exchange chromatography and centrifugation in glycerol gradient as described previously (22Paradela A. Alvarez I. Garcia-Peydro M. Sesma L. Ramos M. Vázquez J. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These preparations consisted of a mixture of 20 S proteasome and immunoproteasome, as determined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis (data not shown). Peptide substrates were incubated at 37 °C and 125 µg/ml with purified 20 S proteasome at an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:10 (w/w) in 20 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.6). Digestion was stopped by adding 0.20 volume of 0.4% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. Digestion mixtures were dried down to 100 µl in a SpeedVac and fractionated by HPLC using exactly the same conditions as for HLA-B27-bound peptides. The peptide composition of individual HPLC fractions was determined by MALDI-TOF MS as described previously (22Paradela A. Alvarez I. Garcia-Peydro M. Sesma L. Ramos M. Vázquez J. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Dried fractions were resuspended in 5 µl of methanol/water (1:1) containing 0.1% formic acid, and 0.5 µl was used for analyses. When required, 1 µl of these samples was subjected to peptide sequencing by quadrupole ion trap nanoelectrospray MS/MS, as described previously (53Yague J. Vázquez J. Lopez de Castro J.A. Tissue Antigens. 1998; 52: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 54Marina A. Garcia M.A. Albar J.P. Yague J. Lopez de Castro J.A. Vázquez J. J. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 34: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Alternatively, peptide sequencing was done by post-source decay MALDI-TOF MS. A 0.5-µl aliquot of the sample was deposited onto the stainless steel MALDI probe and allowed to dry at room temperature. Then 0.5 µl of matrix solution (saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 33% aqueous acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) were added and again allowed to dry at room temperature. The post-source decay MALDI spectrum was measured on a Bruker ReflexTM III MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker-Franzen Analytic GmbH, Bremen, Germany) equipped with the SCOUTTMsource in positive ion reflector mode using delayed extraction. The spectrum was recorded in 14 segments, each successive segment representing a 20% reduction in reflector voltage. The precursor ion was selected by FASTTM deflecting pulses. About 200 shots were averaged per segment, and the segments were pasted, calibrated, and smoothed with Bruker XTOF 5.0.3 software. Data analysis was performed using Bruker BioTools 2.0 software. We first addressed the generation of B27-(169–179), RRYLENGKETL, by the 20 S proteasome from a synthetic 30-mer with the sequence of B*2705 residues 158–187, designated as B27-(158–187). The digestion mixture was fractionated by HPLC (Fig.1A), and fractions corresponding to absorbance peaks were analyzed by MALDI-TOF and, sometimes, also by quadrupole ion trap nanoelectrospray MS. The yield of individual digestion products was estimated on the basis of their absorbance at 210 nm, normalized to take into account peptidic length differences. When various peptides co-eluted, the percentage of each peptide in the absorbance peak was estimated on the basis of their respective ion peak signal intensities in the MALDI-TOF spectra. This is only an approximation, because ion peak intensity may not strictly correlate with peptide abundance. About 50% of the B27-(158–187) substrate was digested after 24 h. Of 21 digestion products obtained with >0.1% yield, 13 resulted from cleavage at a single peptide bond, and 8 were internal fragments resulting from dual cleavage (Fig. 1 B). Internal fragments accounted for only 5% of the total digestion products. Thus, the relationship between proteasomal cleavage and HLA-B27 ligands must be established not only from the internal fragments observed, but mainly from the analysis of cleaved bonds in the synthetic substrate (TableI). Cleavage was observed immediately after all four Leu residues: Leu-160, Leu-168, Leu-172, and Leu-179. Cleavages after Leu-168 and Leu-179 are those involved in the generation of the natural B27-(169–179) ligand, although this peptide was not found as a digestion product of B27-(158–187). Cleavage was also observed immediately after all three Arg residues: Arg-169, Arg-170, and Arg-181. The latter peptide bond was the major cleavage point of the B27-(158–187) substrate (Table I). Dual cleavage after Leu-168 and Arg-181 generated an internal 13-mer, B27-(169–181), with a yield of 0.7% of the total digest (Fig. 1 B). This peptide has anchor motifs typical of HLA-B27 ligands (Arg-2, Tyr-3, Arg-13), suggesting that it could exist as a natural ligand of HLA-B27. Cleavage also occurred after Tyr-171, Asn-174, Thr-178, Gln-180, and Asp-183. Overall, cleavage of B27-(158–187) occurred mainly at two clusters of peptide bonds: Leu-168-Glu-173 and Thr-178-Pro-184.Table IProteasomal cleavage of synthetic substrates mimicking the B*2705 sequenceCleavage afterB27-(158–187) yieldB27-(165–194) yieldB27-(154–183) yieldB27-(139–163) Yield1-aOnly cleavage at bonds in the region overlapping with other substrates in this study is shown.

See text for cleavage at other bonds in this substrate. Open table in a new tab Cleavage yield at a peptide bond was estimated as the total percentage of peptides in the digestion mixture resulting from cleavage at that bond. These results indicate that the 20 S proteasome cleaves B27-(158–187) at the precise peptide bonds required for direct generation of the natural B27-(169–179) ligand. In addition, they suggest the existence of a hitherto unknown B27 ligand from the same region: B27-(169–181). Significant cleavage at internal peptide bonds within these sequences was also observed. Synthetic substrates commonly used to analyze proteasomal cleavage and generation of peptide epitopes are frequently designed so that the sequence of interest is located approximately in the middle, as in B27-(158–187). Since neighboring residues can influence proteasome specificity, the register in which the sequence of interest is placed within the precursor might affect cleavage patterns and lead to unreliable assessment of proteasomal peptide products. To address this issue we designed two additional substrates, B27-(165–194) and B27-(154–183), in which the B27-(169–179) sequence was placed near the N-terminal or the C-terminal end, respectively. Both substrates were digested by the 20 S proteasome and the digestion products analyzed as in the previous paragraph. B27-(165–194) was digested almost completely (99%) within 24 h (Fig. 2A). A total of 44 digestion products, including 23 single-cleavage and 21 internal fragments, were obtained with >0.1% yield (Fig. 2 B). Internal fragments accounted for 17% of the total digestion products. Three main observations were made. First, essentially the same peptide bonds as in B27-(158–187) were cleaved in B27-(165–194) in the region in which both substrates overlap (Table I): after Leu-168, Arg-169, Arg-170, Tyr-171, Leu-172, Leu-179, Gln-180, Arg-181, Asp-183. Cleavage at Asn-174 was negligible (0.02%) and at Thr-178 was not observed. Other bonds, in sequences not overlapping with B27-(158–187), were also cleaved: Thr-187, His-188, Val-189, Thr-190, His-191, His-192. Thus, cleavage in and around the sequence of the natural B27-(169–179) ligand was largely unaffected by its register in the precursor substrate. Second, as in B27-(158–187), cleavage occurred at the precise bonds that generate the B27-(169–179) ligand. In B27-(165–194) the B27-(169–179) ligand was found among the digestion products, albeit with low yield (0.1%). Third, again as in B27-(158–187), Arg-181-Ala-182 was one of the most efficiently cleaved peptide bonds in B27-(165–194) and resulted in the production of the B27-(169–181) 13-mer with 0.4% yield. B27-(154–183), in which the B27-(169–179) sequence was displaced toward the C-terminal end, was digested with 75% yield in 24 h (Fig. 3). A major cleavage point, after Ala-158, dominated the digestion. The total yield of peptide fragments resulting from cleavage at this bond was about 74% of the digest. Other neighbor peptide bonds were also cleaved: after Tyr-159, Leu-160, and Gly-162 (Table I). Overall, 22 peptides, including 15 single-cleavage and 7 internal fragments, were produced with >0.1% yield upon digestion of B27-(154–183). Cleavage around the N-terminal end of the B27-(169–179) sequence was similar, as in the other two substrates (Fig. 3 B and Table I), including cleavage after Leu-168, at the precise N terminus of B27-(169–179), and within this sequence: after Arg-169, Arg-170, Tyr-171, Leu-172. In contrast, substantial differences were observed around the C-terminal region of B27-(169–179): cleavage did not occur after Leu-179 or Gln-180, bonds that were significantly cleaved in the other two precursors, and was observed with much lower yield after Arg-181 (Fig. 3 B, TableI). These alterations are presumably explained by the proximity of these bonds to the substrate C terminus, which might impair proteasomal cleavage in its vicinity. In conclusion, proteasomal cleavage in and around the B27-(169–179) sequence was little influenced by its location in the substrate, except near the substrate C terminus. Cleavage at the precise N- and C-terminal ends indicated that B27-(169–179) can be directly produced by the proteasome, as observed with one of the substrates. Cleavage after Arg-181 generated a 13-mer, B27-(169–181), with structural features typical of HLA-B27 ligands. The B*2705-bound peptide pool was isolated from B*2705-C1R transfectant cells and fractionated by HPLC (Fig.4A). Fractions collected around the retention time of B27-(169–181) were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. An ion peak at mass/charge (m/z) 1662.4, compatible with the molecular mass of the 13-mer, was found in HPLC fraction number 132 (Fig. 4 B). The sequence of the corresponding peptide was determined by post-decay MALDI-TOF MS (Fig. 4 C) and shown to be B27-(169–181). Thus, this peptide is a natural B*2705 ligand. In the same experiment, B27-(169–179) eluted as the main peptide component of a major absorbance peak (Fig. 4 A). On the basis of the absorbance and peptide composition of the corresponding HPLC peaks B27-(169–179) and B27-(169–181) accounted for about 6 and 0.4% of the total peptide pool, respectively. Thus, the 13-mer was about 15 times less abundant than the 11-mer in the B*2705-bound pool. The abundance of these two ligands is probably due to the high expression of HLA-B27 in the B*2705-C1R transfectant cells. B27-(169–181) is the longest HLA-B27 ligand of known sequence reported so far. The presence of B27-(169–181) in the peptide pools from other HLA-B27 subtypes was analyzed, l"

In the presence of dithiothreitol in vitro, a 3-repeat tau isoform promotes microtubule nucleation, reduces the tubulin critical concentration for microtubule assembly, and suppresses dynamic instability. Under non-reducing conditions, threshold concentrations of 3-repeat tau and tubulin exist below which this isoform still promotes microtubule nucleation and assembly but fails to reduce the tubulin critical concentration or suppress dynamic instability; above these threshold concentrations, amorphous aggregates of 3-repeat tau and tubulin can be produced at the expense of microtubule formation. A 4-repeat tau isoform is less sensitive to the oxidative potential of the environment, behaving under oxidative conditions similarly to the 3-repeat isoform under reducing conditions. Under conditions of oxidative stress, in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing either 3- or 4-repeat tau, 3-repeat tau disassociates from microtubules more readily than the 4-repeat isoform, and tau-containing high molecular weight aggregates are preferentially observed in lysates from the Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing 3-repeat tau, indicating greater susceptibility of 3-repeat tau to oxidative conditions, compared with 4-repeat tau in vivo.

Many neuronal MAPs have been shown to reduce the critical concentration of tubulin, Cc , required for MT assembly (23Tucker R.P. Brain Res. Rev. 1990; 15: 101-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 24Schoenfeld T.A. Obar R.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1994; 151: 67-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). More recently, distinct differences have begun to emerge in the ability of individual MAPs to regulate MT behavior, and the simplified picture of a general suppression of dynamic instability and promotion of MT growth by MAPs is becoming more complicated (25Vasquez R.J. Gard D.L. Cassimeris L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 26Trinczek B. Biernat J. Baumann K. Mandelkow E.-M. Mandelkow E. Mol. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 38182-38189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). This complex behavior of MAPs extends to the individual isoforms of tau, which, for example, have now been found to have distinct effects on MT behavior as shown by Trinczek et al. (26Trinczek B. Biernat J. Baumann K. Mandelkow E.-M. Mandelkow E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1887-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), Goode et al. (28Goode B.L. Chau M. Denis P.E. Feinstein S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38182-38189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and by us as reported herein. There exist, however, some discrepancies regarding the major effects of tau on MT dynamics. For example, some studies (14Drechsel D.N. Hyman A.A. Cobb M.H. Kirschner M.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1141-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar) have emphasized effects of tau on changes in MT association rates and on the complete suppression of dynamic instability, whereas other studies (15Pryer N.K.

Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1437-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar) have focused on changes in MT dissociation rates and on varying degrees of suppression of dynamic instability. The work reported here was initiated by our previous, somewhat surprising, observation that 3Rτ promoted MT nucleation in PEM assembly buffer (PEM, microtubule assembly buffer containing 100 mm PIPES, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmmagnesium chloride, at pH 6.5) but was found not to have a significant effect on the apparent critical concentration,Cc(app), of tubulin (30Utton M.A. Vandecandelaere A. Wagner U. Reynolds C.H. Gibb G.M. Miller C.C.J. Bayley P.M. Anderton B.H. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This finding was in contradiction to a report by Trinczek et al. (26Trinczek B. Biernat J. Baumann K. Mandelkow E.-M. Mandelkow E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1887-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), in which it was shown that 3Rτ in assembly buffer containing a sulfhydryl-reducing agent does reduce the apparent critical concentration of tubulin, Cc(app). We have therefore characterized the effects of tau isoforms onCc(app) and other parameters of MT dynamics in further detail, including a variation in buffer conditions. Oxidative damage is the earliest cytopathological marker of neuronal dysfunction in AD (31Shigenaga M.K. Hagen T.M. Amos B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10771-10778Crossref PubMed Scopus (1848) Google Scholar, 32Wolvetang E.J. Johnson K.L. Kraver K. Ralph S.J. Linnane A.W.

Med. 1997; 23: 134-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1996) Google Scholar), and the cytoskeleton is a known target for oxidative stress, highlighted by the aggregation of components such as actin (35Bellumo G. Mirabelli F. Varietti M. Iosi F. Malorni W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 143: 118-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Oxidation/dimerization of tau is important because tau dimers enhance tau aggregation into PHF (36Ackmann M. Wiech H. Mandelkow E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30335-30343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 37Guttmann R.P. Erickson A.C. Johnson G.V.W. J.

Brain Res. 1993; 613: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that in conditions where tau may overload microtubule surfaces, due to microtubule decay or overexpression of tau, changes reminiscent of PHF could occur on the microtubule surface. This implicates tubulin, acting as a polyanionic inducer of tau aggregation, in the progression of tau pathology (36Ackmann M. Wiech H. Mandelkow E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30335-30343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We have examined the functional differences of 3- and 4Rτ in vitro, which led to further study to identify whether oxidative stress conditions affected cells expressing tau. We have found that there are differences in isoform behavior in vitro such that under certain conditions 3Rτ can behave disruptively, and thatin vivo 3Rτ and 4Rτ have different susceptibility to oxidative stress. These observations may be of pathological importance in Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies in which the stoichiometry of isoform composition in neurons may change as well as degenerating neurons being subjected to oxidative stress; these two factors may then result in disruption of the cytoskeleton (40Smith C. Anderton B.H. Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 1994; 20: 322-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), potentially aided by abortive aggregation involving the shortest tau isoform. MT protein was isolated from porcine brain (41Clark D.C. Martin S.R. Bayley P.M. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1924-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Tubulin was purified from endogenous MAPs by phosphocellulose chromatography (Whatman P11). No contamination of the tubulin preparation with high molecular weight MAPs or tau was detected using SDS-PAGE (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), staining for total protein, and Western blotting probing with a polyclonal antibody to tau, TP70 (43Brion J.-P. Couck A.-M. Robertson J. Loviny T.L.F. Anderton B.H. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 1372-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). MT fragments for seeded assembly studies (EGS seeds) were prepared by cross-linking MTs with ethylene glycol bis(succinic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester) (EGS) (44Koshland D.E. Mitchison T.J. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1988; 331: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Immediately prior to experiments, tubulin was subjected to an additional cycle of assembly and disassembly. All experiments were carried out in PEM buffer supplemented with 1 mm GTP. For detailed methodology see Ref. 27Vandecandelaere A. Pedrotti B. Utton M.A. Calvert R.A. Bayley P.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 35: 134-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, and for review of in vitro MT dynamic studies see Ref. 45Bayley P.M. Sharma K.K. Martin S.R. Hyams J. Lloyd C. Microtubules. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1994: 111-137Google Scholar. The expression and purification of recombinant tau isoforms, 3Rτ (0N, 3R) and 4Rτ (2N, 4R), was based on previous procedures (30Utton M.A. Vandecandelaere A. Wagner U. Reynolds C.H. Gibb G.M. Miller C.C.J. Bayley P.M. Anderton B.H. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 46Scott C.W. Blowers D.P. Barth P.T. Lo M.M.S. Salama A.I. Caputo C.B. J. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 30: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). 1 mm DTT was included throughout the purification procedure, and final tau stocks were either placed in PEM alone or PEM + DTT (PEM + DTT, PEM buffer containing 1 mm DTT). Tau concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad protein assay). Determining Cc in order to determine the critical concentration for MT assembly,Cc , tubulin (30 μm) was assembled at 37 °C in PEM or PEM + DTT buffer containing 1 mm GTP in the absence or presence of 3 μm tau. MTs were subsequently diluted to indicated concentrations, further incubated at 37 °C, and sedimented by ultracentrifugation at 100,000gav for 15 min at 37 °C (Beckman TLA 100 rotor, Beckman Instruments). The protein concentration in the resulting supernatants (termed Cs) was determined by the method of Bradford, using known concentrations of tubulin as standard. The contribution of the MAP to the total amount of protein was found to be 5%. Cc is determined by plottingCs against the total tubulin concentration,Ct , and extrapolating the plateau toCt = 0 μm, and the slope gives an indication of the fraction of assembly incompetent tubulin (47Weisenberg R.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1986; 466: 543-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In our previous publication (30Utton M.A. Vandecandelaere A. Wagner U. Reynolds C.H. Gibb G.M. Miller C.C.J. Bayley P.M. Anderton B.H. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), tubulin (Ct = 15 μm) was incubated with or without 3Rτ (1.2 μm) in PEM buffer for 60 min at 37 °C. We determined the polymer mass, Cp , by sedimenting the polymeric material by ultracentrifugation at 100,000g and determining the remaining tubulin concentration in solution, Cs .Cp was calculated as Cp =Ct − Cs . Single point measurements of the critical concentration are always referred to as “apparent” critical concentration,Cc(app). The quotedCc(app) values under “Results” are therefore the measured Cs values of Ref. 30Utton M.A. Vandecandelaere A. Wagner U. Reynolds C.H. Gibb G.M. Miller C.C.J. Bayley P.M. Anderton B.H. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar. Samples were taken following incubation of 21 μm tubulin and 2.1 μm tau prior to centrifugation. Samples were fixed in PEM buffer containing 0.25% (v/v) glutaraldehyde and were mounted on Formvar/carbon-coated copper grids (200 mesh) (Ted Pella Inc. Redding, CA), rinsed with cytochrome c (1 mg/ml) and then negatively stained using uranyl acetate (1% w/v). Images were observed using a Jeol 1200 EX at 80 kV. For the EM analysis using colloidal gold labeling, samples were taken following incubation of 21 μm tubulin and 2.1 μm tau for 30 min at 37 °C, mounted onto grids as described above, and the grids incubated in PBS, followed by 0.1m ammonium chloride/PBS and then 0.5% (v/v) cold-water fish skin gelatin/PBS. The grids were then incubated with a polyclonal antibody to tau, TP70 (43Brion J.-P. Couck A.-M. Robertson J. Loviny T.L.F. Anderton B.H. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 1372-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and a monoclonal antibody to α-tubulin (clone DM1A, Sigma) both diluted 1:100 in 0.5% (v/v) fish skin gelatin/PBS, followed by incubation with gold-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (10 nm) and anti-rabbit IgG (5 nm) (British Biocell, Cardiff, UK) both diluted 1:50 into 0.5% (v/v) fish skin gelatin/PBS. After washing, the grids were transferred to fixative (0.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde/PBS) and either positively or negatively stained using uranyl acetate (1% w/v). The effect of 3Rτ and 4Rτ on the growth rate of individual MTs (using EGS cross-linked MT fragments as seeds) was measured by dark-field video microscopy as described previously (27Vandecandelaere A. Pedrotti B. Utton M.A. Calvert R.A. Bayley P.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 35: 134-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Assembly studies of tubulin in the absence or presence of tau were carried out in a Varian Cary 3E-UV-visible spectrophotometer at 37 °C. The turbidity of the solutions was monitored at 350 nm. Aliquots were taken and diluted in 0.25% (v/v) glutaraldehyde/PEM to fix assembled microtubules. The length distribution within each population was determined by dark-field microscopy (27Vandecandelaere A. Pedrotti B. Utton M.A. Calvert R.A. Bayley P.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 35: 134-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The corresponding MT polymer mass, Cp , at steady state of assembly was measured by ultracentrifugation of MT samples assembled under similar conditions, and Cp was calculated asCp = Ct − Cs . The microtubule number concentration, Cn , is calculated as Cn = Cp /<L> × 1625, where <L> is the average MT length and 1625 is the number of tubulin dimers per μm of microtubule (see Ref. 30Utton M.A. Vandecandelaere A.

Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) stably transfected with 3Rτ (0N, 3R) or 4Rτ (0N, 4R) (kindly donated by M. van Slegtenhorst and M. Hutton, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL) were cultured in F-12 nutrient mix with glutamine supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and geneticin (G418) (0.1 mm). The stable 4Rτ-expressing cell line expressed the 0N, 4R form of tau, which is a different isoform to that used in the 4Rτ studies in vitro (2N, 4R). A stable cell line expressing a 2N, 4R form of tau was not available. Cells were treated with menadione (Sigma) for 2 h at 37 °C (0–200 μm (34Markesbery W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 134-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1996) Google Scholar)) or 1-hydroxypyridine-2-thione (HPT, Sigma) for 15 min at 37 °C in the dark, 1 min under UV light, and 15 min in visible light (0–5 mm (48Epe B.

Chem. 1998; 273: 13331-13338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar)). For immunofluorescence microscopy the cells were washed, treated, and stained for tubulin using the monoclonal antibody against α-tubulin (DM1A, Sigma) as has been described previously (50Dayanandan R. Van Slegtenhorst M. Mack T. Ko L. Yen S.-H. Leroy K. Brion J.-P Anderton B.H. Hutton M. Lovestone S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Staining using the monoclonal antibody against acetylated tubulin (611B1, Sigma) and the polyclonal antibody against tau (anti-rabbit tau, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) was carried out at a dilution of 1:200 and 1:1000, respectively, followed by incubation with a secondary fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody and a Texas Red-conjugated horse anti-mouse antibody, both at a dilution of 1:200 (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Cells were viewed by fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss Axioskop), and images were collected via a CCD camera (Princetown Instruments) and displayed using Metamorph image analysis software. Tau immunofluorescence was quantitated by scoring cells in the following ways: 1) normal filamentous tau staining; 2) partial filamentous tau staining; and 3) no filamentous tau staining. Approximately 200 cells/well were scored by an observer who was blind to the treatments, and the data were averaged from 3 to 4 independent experiments. Statistical analyses of the effect of oxidative stress compounds on filamentous tau staining were performed using one-way ANOVA. For assessment of tau aggregation, cells were treated with the oxidative stress agents as described above, lysed in Laemmli sample buffer (without DTT (51Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Manniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18-53Google Scholar)), and analyzed by 7.5% (w/v) SDS-PAGE and Western blotting probing with the polyclonal tau antibody, TP70 (43Brion J.-P.

The behaviors of the smallest recombinant tau isoform containing three C-terminal repeat domains (3Rτ) and an adult four-repeat tau isoform (4Rτ) in regulating MT dynamics in vitro were investigated. These isoforms were chosen in order to extend the observations of our previous study on the effects of phosphorylation of 3Rτ by glycogen synthase kinase-3β (30Utton M.A. Vandecandelaere A. Wagner U.

Chem. 2000; 275: 38182-38189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Anomalous behavior of 3Rτ in PEM was initially observed when tubulin was assembled in the presence of 3Rτ in PEM or when 3Rτ was added to steady-state MTs, giving a subsequent increase in turbidity that did not correspond to an increase in MT polymer mass (data not shown). Independent measurements of the apparent critical concentration, Cc(app), after ultracentrifugation of the MTs did not reveal a reduction inCc(app) in the presence of 3Rτ in PEM (Ct = 15 μm, [3Rτ] = 1.2 μm, see Ref. 30Utton M.A. Vandecandelaere A.

Thus, in the absence of tau, Cc(app) = 7.3 ± 0.6 μm (Cp = 7.7 μm), whereas in the presence of 3Rτ in PEM,Cc(app) = 7.6 ± 1.4 μm (Cp = 7.4 μm). This suggested factors other than MT formation, such as e.g.oligomerization, were leading to an increase in turbidity. Incubation of 3Rτ in the absence of tubulin, either in the presence or absence of DTT, did not give an increase in turbidity, hence any self-aggregation of 3Rτ alone was not sufficient to explain the observed turbidity increase. Thus, measuring turbidity of MTs in the presence of tau highlights the need for a detailed knowledge of the assemb"

We have investigated the bound-state conformation of a model protein substrate of SecB, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) as well as the conformation of SecB itself by using proximity relationships based on site-directed spin-labeling and pyrene fluorescence methods. BPTI is a 58-residue protein and contains three disulfide groups between residues 5 and 55, 14 and 38, as well as 30 and 51. Mutants of BPTI that contained only a single disulfide were reduced, and the free cysteines were labeled with either thiol-specific spin labels or pyrene maleimide. The relative proximity of the labeled residues was studied using either electron spin resonance spectroscopy or fluorescence spectroscopy. The data suggest that SecB binds a collapsed coil of reduced unfolded BPTI, which then undergoes a structural rearrangement to a more extended state upon binding to SecB. Binding occurs at multiple sites on the substrate, and the binding site on each SecB monomer accommodates less than 21 substrate residues. In addition, we have labeled four solvent-accessible cysteine residues in the SecB tetramer and have investigated their relative spatial arrangement in the presence and absence of the substrate protein. The electron spin resonance data suggest that these cysteine residues are in close proximity (15 Å) when no substrate protein is bound but move away to a distance of greater than 20 Å when SecB binds substrate.

Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3130) Google Scholar). The common property shared by most molecular chaperones is the ability to recognize structural elements exposed in unfolded or partially denatured states such as hydrophobic surfaces. They do not bind the native state of proteins and are capable of interacting with a variety of different polypeptide chains, often without apparent sequence preferences (1Hartl F.U.

SecB is a tetrameric chaperone in Escherichia coli that is involved in the translocation of polypeptide chains into the periplasmic space of the cell (3Weiss J.B. Bassford P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3023-3029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo, SecB binds to a subset of precursor proteins and maintains them in an unfolded, translocation-competent state, whereas in vitro it interacts with a variety of proteins in the non-native state (4Lecker S.H. Driessen J.M. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2309-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 5Fekkes P. Blaauwen T. Driessen A.J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10078-10085Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 6Panse V.G. Udgaonkar J.B. Varadarajan R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14477-14483Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 7Hardy S.J. Randall L.L. Science. 1991; 251: 439-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The nature of the translocation-competent state of substrate proteins is unknown, although it is believed to be a flexible molten globule state (8Bychkova V. Krummeck G. Ptitsyn O.B. FEBS Lett. 1988; 238: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). For some proteins the translocation-competent state contains significant secondary and tertiary structure (4Lecker S.H. Driessen J.M. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2309-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Studies on the model protein substrate, barstar, revealed that SecB does not bind the folded or unfolded state but traps a near native-like molten globule state (6Panse V.G. Udgaonkar J.B. Varadarajan R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14477-14483Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). SecB has also been shown to bind partially folded states of lactalbumin (9Panse V.G. Swaminathan C.P. Surolia A. Varadarajan R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2420-2427Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, BPTI,1 has been extensively used as a model protein for folding studies. It consists of 58 residues and is stabilized by three disulfide bonds between the amino acids 5 and 55, 14 and 38, as well as 30 and 51. The stability of BPTI is directly linked to the formation of these three disulfide bonds, and reduction of the disulfides results in unfolding of the protein. Both non-native and native disulfide intermediates formed during the folding of BPTI have been well characterized (10Staley J.P. Kim P.S. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1822-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 11Darby N.J. Morin P.E. Talbo G. Creighton T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 463-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 12Dadlez M. Kim P.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16153-16164Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The structures of single disulfide intermediates and of unfolded BPTI have also been characterized (10Staley J.P. Kim P.S. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1822-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 11Darby N.J. Morin P.E. Talbo G. Creighton T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 463-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 12Dadlez M. Kim P.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16153-16164Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 13Schulman B.A. Kim P.S. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2226-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Various biophysical measurements suggest that reduced BPTI can exist in a compact conformation that is almost devoid of secondary structure elements (14- 20). BPTI is a convenient model substrate to study interactions between SecB and substrate proteins. The kinetics and thermodynamics of the interaction of SecB with reduced, unfolded BPTI has previously been characterized (10Staley J.P. Kim P.S. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1822-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). It was shown that SecB binds to reduced, unfolded BPTI with a stoichiometry of one BPTI molecule per SecB monomer, a Kd in the nanomolar range, and an on-rate that is close to diffusion controlled rates. ESR spectroscopy using site-specific spin labeling of unique cysteine residues has been used successfully in recent years to study protein structures and structural changes in a variety of different proteins and enzymes (21Hubbell W.L. Gross A. Langen R. Lietzow M.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). The approach has been further extended to measure distances between two site-specifically placed spin-labels by calibrating spectral components to the distances derived from well known helical structures of peptides (22Rabenstein M.D. Shin Y.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8239-8243Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). A similar approach has been employed recently to determine the proximity of helices and their relative movement upon photoactivation in bacteriorhodopsin (23Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar,24Altenbach C. Yang K. Farrens D.L. Farahbakhsh Z.T. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12470-12478Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). A second biophysical technique that has been used to study proximity of residues in proteins is pyrene excimer fluorescence (25Lehrer S.S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 278: 286-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Pyrene excimer fluorescence has been extensively used to determine proximity of residues in helices of the membrane protein lac permease (26Zhao M. Zen K.C. Hubbell W.L. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7407-7412Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 27Sun J. Voss J. Hubbell W.L. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3100-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Determination of inter-residue distances provides a strategy to deduce the proximity of selected secondary structural elements and therefore allows insight into the global structure or structural changes of a protein at the level of the backbone fold (21Hubbell W.L. Gross A. Langen R. Lietzow M.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have used unfolded BPTI as a model substrate to gain insights into the bound state conformation of polypeptides interacting with the chaperone SecB. We have investigated the binding of SecB to several BPTI mutants that were labeled at two Cys residues with either pyrenes or spin labels. Single disulfide mutants of BPTI in which alanines had been substituted for the other cysteine residues were used. The mutant proteins were labeled in the reduced state with either the spin labels or pyrene maleimides, and the proximity of the labeled residues was studied using fluorescence methods and ESR spectroscopy. The SecB expression plasmid pJW25 in strain BL21 (DE3) was obtained from B. de Kruijff, Utrecht University. SecB purification was done as reported previously (6Panse V.G. Udgaonkar J.B. Varadarajan R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14477-14483Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The purified protein was estimated to be 99% pure by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as detected by silver staining (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and analytical gel filtration high performance liquid chromatography. The extinction coefficient at 280 nm was taken to be 11,900m−1 cm−1 for monomeric SecB (29Fasman G.D. Park K. Randall L. J. Protein Chem. 1995; 14: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). All the SecB concentrations reported here refer to monomers of SecB unless otherwise stated. Purification of the single disulfide BPTI mutants was performed as described (10Staley J.P. Kim P.S. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1822-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 12Dadlez M. Kim P.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16153-16164Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 20Lumb K.J. Kim P.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 30Staley J.P. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1519-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). 4-(3-Iodo-2-oxypropylidene-1-)-2,2,3,5,5-pentamethyl-imidazolidine-1-oxyl (IOPI) was prepared as described in Volodarsky (31Volodarsky L.B. Imidazoline Nitroxides. 1. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1988Google Scholar).1 mg of the single disulfide mutants of BPTI were reduced in 200 μl of 6 mguanidine hydrochloride in Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, containing 10 mm dithiothreitol. The reaction mixture was desalted on a PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and lyophilized. The reduced proteins were dissolved in 200 μl of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride in potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and 50 μl of a 20 mm solution of IOPI inN,N-dimethylformamide was added. The mixture was then incubated for 1 h in the dark at 25 °C, desalted on a PD-10 column, and lyophilized. For pyrene labeling, reduced protein was dissolved in 200 μl of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride in potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, as described above, and 50 μl of a 20 mm solution of pyrene maleimide inN,N-dimethylformamide was added. The reaction mixture was again incubated for 1 h in the dark at room temperature, desalted on a PD-10 column, and lyophilized. The extent of labeling was assayed according to Creighton (32Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1990: 155-166Google Scholar) and found to be 1.9 Cys residues/BPTI molecule. To label SecB with pyrene maleimide or IOPI-spin label, a similar procedure was carried out as described above except that guanidine hydrochloride was excluded from the reaction mixture to avoid denaturation of the protein. The oligomeric state of the protein after cysteine modification was analyzed by subjecting both labeled and unlabeled SecB to gel filtration on a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) gel filtration column. The column was equilibrated with 50 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mmNaCl. The extent of spin- or pyrene-labeling was assayed by determining the amount of residual, unreacted SH groups as described previously. Both under denaturing and under non-denaturing conditions, three unreacted sulfhydryl groups were found per monomer, suggesting that only one of the four cysteines per monomer was modified by our reagents. Similar results were described earlier (33Panse V.G. Swaminathan C.P. Aloor J.J. Surolia A. Varadarajan R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2362-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the case of the pyrene-labeled SecB, the extent of labeling was also analyzed by mass analysis. Positive ESI-MS of the unlabeled and the pyrene-labeled SecB was recorded on a Hewlett Packard Series 1100 mass selective detector mass spectrometer to confirm the presence of a single pyrene chromophore per SecB monomer. Detection of the uniquely labeled cysteine was done by carrying out CNBr cleavage on the tryptic digest of the unlabeled and the pyrene-labeled SecB as described (34Darbre A. Practical Protein Chemistry: A Handbook. Wiley Interscience, Chichester, Great Britain1986Google Scholar). MALDI of the peptide mixtures was performed on a Kompact SEQ mass spectrometer (Kratos Analytical). 10 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid in acetonitrile/methanol/water, 5:3:2, was used as a matrix solution, and the spectra were obtained in the linear mode. The ESR measurements were carried out using a Bruker ESP 300 E spectrometer operating in the X-band mode. A dielectric cavity TE011 (ER 4118) was used for all experiments. 20-μl aliquots of the spin-labeled proteins in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, were prepared in sealed quartz capillaries. Spectra of the samples at room temperature (298 K) were obtained by averaging 3–5 scans at a scan width of 120 Gauss. The microwave power was set to be 2 mW, and the modulation amplitude was optimized to the line-width of the individual spectra. ESR spectra in the frozen state (183 K) were recorded at a microwave power of 0.05 mW. All fluorescence emission experiments were carried out using a Jasco FP 777 fluorimeter. The fluorescence measurements were carried out in a 1-cm quartz cuvette at 25 °C with an excitation wavelength of 344 nm. To obtain the excitation spectra, the excitation wavelength was varied from 320 to 360 nm, and the fluorescence was monitored at 377 nm and 450 nm for monomer and excimer fluorescence, respectively. A slit width of 1.5 nm was used for measuring both excitation and emission. The binding affinity of the different pyrene-labeled BPTI mutants for SecB was carried out as follows. 25 nm labeled BPTI in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer was taken in the cuvette held at 25 °C. Increasing amounts of SecB from 10 to 500 nmwere added, and the increase in fluorescence intensity at 400 nm was recorded. The data were analyzed as described (5Fekkes P. Blaauwen T. Driessen A.J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10078-10085Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 9Panse V.G. Swaminathan C.P. Surolia A. Varadarajan R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2420-2427Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) to obtain the dissociation constant. Comparative protein structure modeling program MODELLER (35Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar) was used for the model building of the E. coli SecB structure. The program was downloaded from the MODELLER homepage on the Internet. Multiple sequence alignment of eight bacterial SecB proteins using ClustalW shows that the E. coli SecB has 60% sequence identity with the Hemophilus influenzae SecB. Three of the four cysteines, corresponding to the positions 76, 97, and 102, are conserved, whereas leucine is present at the position of the H. influenzae SecB that corresponds to Cys-113 of the E. coli SecB. The crystal structure of the H. influenzae SecB (36Xu Z. Knafles J.D. Yoshino K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1172-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) was then used as the template structure. The crystal structure reveals that SecB is organized as a dimer of dimers. The solvent accessibility of the cysteine residues was determined using the programs DEPTH (37Chakravarty S. Varadarajan R. Structure (Lond.). 1999; 7: 723-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and ACCESS (38Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5360) Google Scholar) and the coordinates of the crystal structure of SecB. The results from these two programs indicated that the cysteines in each monomer are accessible to slightly different extents. Hence, we modeled theE. coli SecB for the four monomers independently, taking the monomers of the H. influenzae SecB as templates. The four modeled monomers were combined to give the modeled structure of the tetrameric protein. The accessibility of the cysteines was then determined by using the programs DEPTH and ACCESS on the modeled structure. The distances between the Sγ of the cysteines was determined using RASMOL. A bound IOPI spin-label at position 97 was also modeled on the modeled structure of E. coli SecB tetramer using the programs Quanta 97 and CharmM 2.3 (Molecular Simulations) for modeling and energy minimization. The nitroxide group of the IOPI spin-label is at a distance of about 7.5 Å from the position of the corresponding cysteine residue. The modeling was done to determine the distance between the nitroxide radicals in the IOPI-labeled cysteines. Reduced, unfolded BPTI has been previously shown to bind to SecB (5Fekkes P. Blaauwen T. Driessen A.J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10078-10085Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 7Hardy S.J. Randall L.L. Science. 1991; 251: 439-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the regions of the substrate that are involved in binding, the conformation of bound substrate, and whether substrate binding is accompanied by a change in SecB conformation. We have used two different approaches to obtain this information. In a first set of experiments, we have incorporated into unfolded BPTI a pair of either spin labels or fluorescent labels at various positions along the primary sequence to investigate the proximity of the labels relative to each other in the free as well as the SecB-bound state. In a second approach, the four solvent-accessible cysteine residues on SecB were labeled to study potential structural changes of the chaperone upon binding the permanently denatured (BPTI)all Ala. The single disulfide mutants of BPTI 5–55, 30–51, and 14–38 were labeled with pyrene maleimide, and the labeling efficiency was checked as described under “Materials and Methods.” The fluorescence emission spectrum of pyrene (excited at 345 nm) is composed of two bands, a structured band with peaks near 385 and 405 nm, which is referred to as the monomer peak, and an unstructured broad peak near 470 nm that is observed when two pyrenyl groups are close to each other at a distance of ∼3.5 Å (excimer band). Upon binding of the labeled mutants of BPTI to SecB, an increase in fluorescence intensity is observed, indicating that the pyrene probes are in a hydrophobic environment upon binding to the chaperone as described previously (39Panse V.G. Vogel P. Trommer W.E. Varadarajan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18698-18703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Fig.1 shows the pyrene emission of labeled BPTI mutants in the presence (dotted lines) and absence (solid lines) of SecB. The addition of SecB to labeled BPTI results in changes in fluorescence intensities of both monomer and excimer peaks. These changes are due in part to decreased quenching of pyrene fluorescence by solvent in the SecB-bound state. Hence, to analyze intensities of the excimer peak in the presence of SecB, the spectra were normalized to have identical intensity at 377 nm both in the presence and absence of SecB. Pyrene modifications at the amino acid positions 5 and 55 or 30 and 51 (Fig. 1, A andB, solid lines) show relatively weak excimer fluorescence, indicating that in both sets of mutants, the chromophores are at distances greater than 3.5 Å. Stronger excimer fluorescence is observed when the labels were in positions 14 and 38 (Fig. 1,C, solid line). Upon binding of the labeled BPTI to SecB, the weak excimer fluorescence of the mutants with the labeled residues (5–55)Py and (30–51)Py decreased even further (Fig. 1, A and B, dotted lines). Also in the case of labeled residues (14–38)Py (Fig. 1 C, dotted line), a large decrease in excimer fluorescence is observed upon the addition of SecB, although some excimer fluorescence remained. We have labeled the four solvent-accessible cysteine residues in SecB (one Cys per monomer) using pyrene maleimide (33Panse V.G. Swaminathan C.P. Aloor J.J. Surolia A. Varadarajan R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2362-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Modification of the cysteine residue in SecB by 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) is reported to cause irreversible dissociation of the tetramer to dimer (40Topping T.B. Woodbury R.L. Diamond D.L. Hardy S.J. Randall L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7437-7441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Hence, both pyrene-labeled and the unlabeled SecB were analyzed by gel chromatography to check for the oligomeric state of the protein after labeling. Pyrene-labeled SecB elutes at the same position as the unlabeled SecB. This indicates that both labeled and unlabeled proteins exist primarily as tetrameric species in solution and that no dimer is present (Fig.2). The shoulder in the gel filtration profile of the pyrene-labeled SecB, appearing in the void volume of the column, could be indicative of the presence of a small fraction of aggregate. However no aggregated species is present for the spin-labeled protein. 5,5′-Dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) labeling as well as the ESI-MS of the pyrene-labeled SecB confirmed pyrene labeling of a single cysteine per SecB monomer (Fig. 3 A). Although there are four cysteines in SecB monomer at the positions 76, 97, 102, and 113 that can be selectively modified by thiol-labeling reagents, MALDI of the proteolysed mixture of the pyrene-labeled SecB showed that only the peptide fragment 95–111 contains a cysteine with a single pyrene (Fig. 3, B and C). Thus either cysteine 97 or cysteine 102 is likely to be the site of labeling. Since the two cysteines are very close to each other in the primary sequence, it was not possible to experimentally determine which of the two was the actual site of labeling using this technique. We therefore modeled the E. coli SecB as described under “Materials and Methods.” Table I summarizes the relative accessibility in both the crystal structure and the modeled structure. The table shows that with the exception of chain A, residue 97 is the most accessible in both the crystal and model structures. For chain A, Cys-102 is most exposed in the model, and Leu-122 (equivalent to Cys-113 in E. coli SecB) is most exposed in the crystal structure. It is possible that Cys-97 is labeled in three chains, and in chain A either no Cys is labeled or either Cys-102 or Cys-113 is labeled. Previous 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) labeling studies showed that four Cys residues are labeled per tetramer (33Panse V.G. Swaminathan C.P. Aloor J.J. Surolia A. Varadarajan R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2362-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometric studies did not show any evidence for labeling of Cys-113. Taken together the data suggest that either Cys-97 is labeled in all chains or that Cys-102 is labeled in chain A, and Cys-97 is labeled in the remaining chains. The pyrene-labeled SecB was further characterized by fluorescence spectroscopy. No excimer formation was observed (data not shown). This indicates that the pyrenes are held rigidly at a distance of more than 3.5 Å and are probably part of a secondary structural element of the protein. The inter-cysteine distances for the two cysteine residues, 97 and 102, that are the most probable sites of labeling, are indeed greater than 3.5 Å in the structure (Table IB). The addition of the unfolded (BPTI)all Ala mutant leads to an increase in fluorescence of the labeled pyrenes of SecB, indicating a change in the environment upon binding of the substrate molecules. This is suggestive of a conformational transition of the chaperone upon binding of the substrate protein. Alternatively the substrate binding may occur close to the site of the pyrene label on SecB. ESR studies described below, however, support the first possibility.Table IA.

Shortest inter-cysteine Sγ distances for the cysteine residues that are the most probable sites of modification in modeled E. coli SecB. The ESR spectra of the different spin-labeled mutants of BPTI show the typical line-broadening that occurs upon covalent binding of the radicals to a protein. As a typical example, the spectra of the labeled mutant (14–38)SL are shown in Fig.4. The fact that the line broadening is mainly observed as reduced signal amplitude of the high field signal (Fig. 4 A) indicates that the bound radicals still have rather high mobility. This is consistent with the spin-labeled BPTI being in an unfolded state. Upon the addition of SecB, additional signals with a 2Azz value of 63 G are apparent in the low and high field region of the ESR spectra (Fig. 4 B,1, 1′), indicating that binding of the labeled BPTI to the chaperone SecB has taken place. The relative area of peaks 1 and 1′ corresponds to ∼50% of the total radicals, whereas the sharp signals of the highly mobile spin labels have decreased by about 50% as compared with Fig. 4 A under normalized conditions. Such observations are indicative of restricted motional freedom of one of the two spin labels covalently bound to BPTI or by binding of ∼50% of the labeled substrate protein. Similar spectra were observed by the authors in the case of lactate dehydrogenase (41Wenzel H.R. Pfleiderer G. Trommer W.E. Paschenda K. Redhardt A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 452: 292-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), where the bound radical component was hardly visible at all but still accounted for 30% of the total spin-labeled substrate. The binding constant of unfolded BPTI for SecB under the conditions of the ESR experiments was determined to be 10 nm using fluorescence spectroscopy, an observation that is in agreement with findings described earlier ("
