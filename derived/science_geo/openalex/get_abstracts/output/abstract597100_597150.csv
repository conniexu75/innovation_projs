https://openalex.org/W2761275051,"Characterization of the molecular function of the human genome and its variation across individuals is essential for identifying the cellular mechanisms that underlie human genetic traits and diseases. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project aims to characterize variation in gene expression levels across individuals and diverse tissues of the human body, many of which are not easily accessible. Here we describe genetic effects on gene expression levels across 44 human tissues. We find that local genetic variation affects gene expression levels for the majority of genes, and we further identify inter-chromosomal genetic effects for 93 genes and 112 loci. On the basis of the identified genetic effects, we characterize patterns of tissue specificity, compare local and distal effects, and evaluate the functional properties of the genetic effects. We also demonstrate that multi-tissue, multi-individual data can be used to identify genes and pathways affected by human disease-associated variation, enabling a mechanistic interpretation of gene regulation and the genetic basis of disease."
https://openalex.org/W2521741120,"Abstract X chromosome inactivation (XCI) silences transcription from one of the two X chromosomes in female mammalian cells to balance expression dosage between XX females and XY males. XCI is, however, incomplete in humans: up to one-third of X-chromosomal genes are expressed from both the active and inactive X chromosomes (Xa and Xi, respectively) in female cells, with the degree of ‘escape’ from inactivation varying between genes and individuals 1,2 . The extent to which XCI is shared between cells and tissues remains poorly characterized 3,4 , as does the degree to which incomplete XCI manifests as detectable sex differences in gene expression 5 and phenotypic traits 6 . Here we describe a systematic survey of XCI, integrating over 5,500 transcriptomes from 449 individuals spanning 29 tissues from GTEx (v6p release) and 940 single-cell transcriptomes, combined with genomic sequence data. We show that XCI at 683 X-chromosomal genes is generally uniform across human tissues, but identify examples of heterogeneity between tissues, individuals and cells. We show that incomplete XCI affects at least 23% of X-chromosomal genes, identify seven genes that escape XCI with support from multiple lines of evidence and demonstrate that escape from XCI results in sex biases in gene expression, establishing incomplete XCI as a mechanism that is likely to introduce phenotypic diversity 6,7 . Overall, this updated catalogue of XCI across human tissues helps to increase our understanding of the extent and impact of the incompleteness in the maintenance of XCI."
https://openalex.org/W2762506271,"Using the GTEx data and others, a comprehensive analysis of adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing in mammals is presented; targets of the various ADAR enzymes are identified, as are several potential regulators of editing, such as AIMP2. The GTEx (Genotype-Tissue Expression) Consortium has established a reference catalogue and associated tissue biobank for gene-expression levels across individuals for diverse tissues of the human body, with a broad sampling of normal, non-diseased human tissues from postmortem donors. The consortium now presents the deepest survey of gene expression across multiple tissues and individuals to date, encompassing 7,051 samples from 449 donors across 44 human tissues. Barbara Engelhardt and colleagues characterize the relationship between genetic variation and gene expression, and find that most genes are regulated by genetic variation near to the affected gene. In accompanying GTEx studies, Alexis Battle, Stephen Montgomery and colleagues examine the effect of rare genetic variation on gene expression across human tissues, Daniel MacArthur and colleagues systematically survey the landscape of X chromosome inactivation in human tissues, and Jin Billy Li and colleagues provide a comprehensive cross-species analysis of adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing in mammals. In an accompanying News & Views, Michelle Ward and Yoav Gilad put the latest results in context and discuss how these findings are helping to crack the regulatory code of the human genome. Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is a conserved post-transcriptional mechanism mediated by ADAR enzymes that diversifies the transcriptome by altering selected nucleotides in RNA molecules1. Although many editing sites have recently been discovered2,3,4,5,6,7, the extent to which most sites are edited and how the editing is regulated in different biological contexts are not fully understood8,9,10. Here we report dynamic spatiotemporal patterns and new regulators of RNA editing, discovered through an extensive profiling of A-to-I RNA editing in 8,551 human samples (representing 53 body sites from 552 individuals) from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and in hundreds of other primate and mouse samples. We show that editing levels in non-repetitive coding regions vary more between tissues than editing levels in repetitive regions. Globally, ADAR1 is the primary editor of repetitive sites and ADAR2 is the primary editor of non-repetitive coding sites, whereas the catalytically inactive ADAR3 predominantly acts as an inhibitor of editing. Cross-species analysis of RNA editing in several tissues revealed that species, rather than tissue type, is the primary determinant of editing levels, suggesting stronger cis-directed regulation of RNA editing for most sites, although the small set of conserved coding sites is under stronger trans-regulation. In addition, we curated an extensive set of ADAR1 and ADAR2 targets and showed that many editing sites display distinct tissue-specific regulation by the ADAR enzymes in vivo. Further analysis of the GTEx data revealed several potential regulators of editing, such as AIMP2, which reduces editing in muscles by enhancing the degradation of the ADAR proteins. Collectively, our work provides insights into the complex cis- and trans-regulation of A-to-I editing."
https://openalex.org/W2521004108,"Abstract Rare genetic variants are abundant in humans and are expected to contribute to individual disease risk 1,2,3,4 . While genetic association studies have successfully identified common genetic variants associated with susceptibility, these studies are not practical for identifying rare variants 1,5 . Efforts to distinguish pathogenic variants from benign rare variants have leveraged the genetic code to identify deleterious protein-coding alleles 1,6,7 , but no analogous code exists for non-coding variants. Therefore, ascertaining which rare variants have phenotypic effects remains a major challenge. Rare non-coding variants have been associated with extreme gene expression in studies using single tissues 8,9,10,11 , but their effects across tissues are unknown. Here we identify gene expression outliers, or individuals showing extreme expression levels for a particular gene, across 44 human tissues by using combined analyses of whole genomes and multi-tissue RNA-sequencing data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project v6p release 12 . We find that 58% of underexpression and 28% of overexpression outliers have nearby conserved rare variants compared to 8% of non-outliers. Additionally, we developed RIVER (RNA-informed variant effect on regulation), a Bayesian statistical model that incorporates expression data to predict a regulatory effect for rare variants with higher accuracy than models using genomic annotations alone. Overall, we demonstrate that rare variants contribute to large gene expression changes across tissues and provide an integrative method for interpretation of rare variants in individual genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2761032135,"Among the four known transneptunian dwarf planets, Haumea is an exotic, very elongated, and fast rotating body. In contrast to the other dwarf planets, its size, shape, albedo, and density are not well constrained. Here we report results of a multi-chord stellar occultation, observed on 2017 January 21. Secondary events observed around the main body are consistent with the presence of a ring of opacity 0.5, width 70 km, and radius 2,287$_{-45}^{+75}$ km. The Centaur Chariklo was the first body other than a giant planet to show a ring system and the Centaur Chiron was later found to possess something similar to Chariklo's rings. Haumea is the first body outside the Centaur population with a ring. The ring is coplanar with both Haumea's equator and the orbit of its satellite Hi'iaka. Its radius places close to the 3:1 mean motion resonance with Haumea's spin period. The occultation by the main body provides an instantaneous elliptical limb with axes 1,704 $\pm$ 4 km x 1,138 $\pm$ 26 km. Combined with rotational light-curves, it constrains Haumea's 3D orientation and its triaxial shape, which is inconsistent with a homogeneous body in hydrostatic equilibrium. Haumea's largest axis is at least 2,322 $\pm$ 60 km, larger than thought before. This implies an upper limit of 1,885 $\pm$ 80 kg m$^{-3}$ for Haumea's density, smaller and less puzzling than previous estimations, and a geometric albedo of 0.51 $\pm$ 0.02, also smaller than previous estimations. No global N$_2$ or CH$_4$ atmosphere with pressures larger than 15 and 50 nbar (3-$\sigma$ limits), respectively, is detected."
https://openalex.org/W2761993083,"Climate change is expected to lead to increases in drought frequency and severity, with deleterious effects on many ecosystems. Stomatal responses to changing environmental conditions form the backbone of all ecosystem models, but are based on empirical relationships and are not well-tested during drought conditions. Here, we use a dataset of 34 woody plant species spanning global forest biomes to examine the effect of leaf water potential on stomatal conductance and test the predictive accuracy of three major stomatal models and a recently proposed model. We find that current leaf-level empirical models have consistent biases of over-prediction of stomatal conductance during dry conditions, particularly at low soil water potentials. Furthermore, the recently proposed stomatal conductance model yields increases in predictive capability compared to current models, and with particular improvement during drought conditions. Our results reveal that including stomatal sensitivity to declining water potential and consequent impairment of plant water transport will improve predictions during drought conditions and show that many biomes contain a diversity of plant stomatal strategies that range from risky to conservative stomatal regulation during water stress. Such improvements in stomatal simulation are greatly needed to help unravel and predict the response of ecosystems to future climate extremes."

https://openalex.org/W2761809679,"Peripheral neurotoxicity is one of the most distressing side effects of oxaliplatin therapy for cancer. Indeed, most patients that received oxaliplatin experience acute and/or chronic severe sensory peripheral neuropathy. However, despite similar co-morbidities, cancer stage, demographics and treatment schedule, patients develop oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neurotoxicity with remarkably different severity. This suggests individual genetic variability, which might be used to glean the mechanistic insights into oxaliplatin neurotoxicity. We characterized the susceptibility of different mice strains to oxaliplatin neurotoxicity investigating the phenotypic features of neuropathy and gene expression profiles in dorsal root ganglia of six genetically different mice strains (Balb-c, C57BL6, DBA/2J, AJ, FVB and CD1) exposed to the same oxaliplatin schedule. Differential gene expression in dorsal root ganglia from each mice strain were assayed using a genome-wide expression analysis and selected genes were validated by RT-PCR analysis. The demonstration of consistent differences in the phenotypic response to oxaliplatin across different strains is interesting to allow the selection of the appropriate strain based on the pre-defined read-out parameters. Further investigation of the correlation between gene expression changes and oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity phenotype in each strain will be useful to deeper investigate the molecular mechanisms of oxaliplatin neurotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2763249451,"Vasculoprotective endothelium glycocalyx (GCX) shedding plays a critical role in vascular disease. Previous work demonstrated that GCX degradation disrupts endothelial cell (EC) gap junction connexin (Cx) proteins, likely blocking interendothelial molecular transport that maintains EC and vascular tissue homeostasis to resist disease. Here, we focused on GCX regeneration and tested the hypothesis that vasculoprotective EC function can be stimulated via replacement of GCX when it is shed. We used EC with [i] intact heparan sulfate (HS), the most abundant GCX component; [ii] degraded HS; or [iii] HS that was restored after enzyme degradation, by cellular self-recovery or artificially. Artificial HS restoration was achieved via treatment with exogenous HS, with or without the GCX regenerator and protector sphingosine 1- phosphate (S1P). In these cells we immunocytochemically examined expression of Cx isotype 43 (Cx43) at EC borders and characterized Cx-containing gap junction activity by measuring interendothelial spread of gap junction permeable Lucifer Yellow dye. With intact HS, 60% of EC borders expressed Cx43 and dye spread to 2.88 ± 0.09 neighboring cells. HS degradation decreased Cx43 expression to 30% and reduced dye spread to 1.87± 0.06 cells. Cellular self-recovery of HS restored baseline levels of Cx43 and dye transfer. Artificial HS recovery with exogenous HS partially restored Cx43 expression to 46% and yielded dye spread to only 1.03 ± 0.07 cells. Treatment with both HS and S1P, recovered HS and restored Cx43 to 56% with significant dye transfer to 3.96 ± 0.23 cells. This is the first evidence of GCX regeneration in a manner that effectively restores vasculoprotective EC communication."

https://openalex.org/W2763263488,"Candida albicans is an inhabitant of mucosal surfaces in healthy individuals but also the most common cause of fungal nosocomial blood stream infections, associated with high morbidity and mortality. As such life-threatening infections often disseminate from superficial mucosal infections we aimed to study the use of probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) in prevention of mucosal C. albicans infections. Here, we demonstrate that LGG protects oral epithelial tissue from damage caused by C. albicans in our in vitro model of oral candidiasis. Furthermore, we provide insights into the mechanisms behind this protection and dissect direct and indirect effects of LGG on C. albicans pathogenicity. C. albicans viability was not affected by LGG. Instead, transcriptional profiling using RNA-Seq indicated dramatic metabolic reprogramming of C. albicans. Additionally, LGG had a significant impact on major virulence attributes, including adhesion, invasion, and hyphal extension, whose reduction, consequently, prevented epithelial damage. This was accompanied by glucose depletion and repression of ergosterol synthesis, caused by LGG, but also due to blocked adhesion sites. Therefore, LGG protects oral epithelia against C. albicans infection by preventing fungal adhesion, invasion and damage, driven, at least in parts, by metabolic reprogramming due to nutrient limitation caused by LGG."
https://openalex.org/W2763329470,"There is a burst of work on human mobility and encounter networks. However, the connection between these two important fields just begun recently. It is clear that both are closely related: Mobility generates encounters, and these encounters might give rise to contagion phenomena or even friendship. We model a set of random walkers that visit locations in space following a strategy akin to Lévy flights. We measure the encounters in space and time and establish a link between walkers after they coincide several times. This generates a temporal network that is characterized by global quantities. We compare this dynamics with real data for two cities: New York City and Tokyo. We use data from the location-based social network Foursquare and obtain the emergent temporal encounter network, for these two cities, that we compare with our model. We found long-range (Lévy-like) distributions for traveled distances and time intervals that characterize the emergent social network due to human mobility. Studying this connection is important for several fields like epidemics, social influence, voting, contagion models, behavioral adoption and diffusion of ideas."
https://openalex.org/W2763810869,"The distribution and survival of trees during the last glacial maximum (LGM) has been of interest to paleoecologists, biogeographers, and geneticists. Ecological niche models that associate species occurrence and abundance with climatic variables are widely used to gain ecological and evolutionary insights and to predict species distributions over space and time. The present study deals with the glacial history of walnut to address questions related to past distributions through genetic analysis and ecological modeling of the present, LGM and Last Interglacial (LIG) periods. A maximum entropy method was used to project the current walnut distribution model on to the LGM (21–18 kyr BP) and LIG (130–116 kyr BP) climatic conditions. Model tuning identified the walnut data set filtered at 10 km spatial resolution as the best for modeling the current distribution and to hindcast past (LGM and LIG) distributions of walnut. The current distribution model predicted southern Caucasus, parts of West and Central Asia extending into South Asia encompassing northern Afghanistan, Pakistan, northwestern Himalayan region, and southwestern Tibet, as the favorable climatic niche matching the modern distribution of walnut. The hindcast of distributions suggested the occurrence of walnut during LGM was somewhat limited to southern latitudes from southern Caucasus, Central and South Asian regions extending into southwestern Tibet, northeastern India, Himalayan region of Sikkim and Bhutan, and southeastern China. Both CCSM and MIROC projections overlapped, except that MIROC projected a significant presence of walnut in the Balkan Peninsula during the LGM. In contrast, genetic analysis of the current walnut distribution suggested a much narrower area in northern Pakistan and the surrounding areas of Afghanistan, northwestern India, and southern Tajikistan as a plausible hotspot of diversity where walnut may have survived glaciations. Overall, the findings suggest that walnut perhaps survived the last glaciations in several refugia across a wide geographic area between 30° and 45° North latitude. However, humans probably played a significant role in the recent history and modern distribution of walnut."
https://openalex.org/W2764020751,"When we hear a new voice we automatically form a ""first impression"" of the voice owner's personality; a single word is sufficient to yield ratings highly consistent across listeners. Past studies have shown correlations between personality ratings and acoustical parameters of voice, suggesting a potential acoustical basis for voice personality impressions, but its nature and extent remain unclear. Here we used data-driven voice computational modelling to investigate the link between acoustics and perceived trustworthiness in the single word ""hello"". Two prototypical voice stimuli were generated based on the acoustical features of voices rated low or high in perceived trustworthiness, respectively, as well as a continuum of stimuli inter- and extrapolated between these two prototypes. Five hundred listeners provided trustworthiness ratings on the stimuli via an online interface. We observed an extremely tight relationship between trustworthiness ratings and position along the trustworthiness continuum (r = 0.99). Not only were trustworthiness ratings higher for the high- than the low-prototypes, but the difference could be modulated quasi-linearly by reducing or exaggerating the acoustical difference between the prototypes, resulting in a strong caricaturing effect. The f0 trajectory, or intonation, appeared a parameter of particular relevance: hellos rated high in trustworthiness were characterized by a high starting f0 then a marked decrease at mid-utterance to finish on a strong rise. These results demonstrate a strong acoustical basis for voice personality impressions, opening the door to multiple potential applications."
https://openalex.org/W2952537251,"In many Lactobacillales species (i.e. lactic acid bacteria), peptidoglycan is decorated by polyrhamnose polysaccharides that are critical for cell envelope integrity and cell shape and also represent key antigenic determinants. Despite the biological importance of these polysaccharides, their biosynthetic pathways have received limited attention. The important human pathogen, Streptococcus pyogenes, synthesizes a key antigenic surface polymer, the Lancefield group A carbohydrate (GAC). GAC is covalently attached to peptidoglycan and consists of a polyrhamnose polymer, with N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) side chains, which is an essential virulence determinant. The molecular details of the mechanism of polyrhamnose modification with GlcNAc are currently unknown. In this report, using molecular genetics, analytical chemistry, and mass spectrometry analysis, we demonstrated that GAC biosynthesis requires two distinct undecaprenol-linked GlcNAc-lipid intermediates: GlcNAc-pyrophosphoryl-undecaprenol (GlcNAc-P-P-Und) produced by the GlcNAc-phosphate transferase GacO and GlcNAc-phosphate-undecaprenol (GlcNAc-P-Und) produced by the glycosyltransferase GacI. Further investigations revealed that the GAC polyrhamnose backbone is assembled on GlcNAc-P-P-Und. Our results also suggested that a GT-C glycosyltransferase, GacL, transfers GlcNAc from GlcNAc-P-Und to polyrhamnose. Moreover, GacJ, a small membrane-associated protein, formed a complex with GacI and significantly stimulated its catalytic activity. Of note, we observed that GacI homologs perform a similar function in Streptococcus agalactiae and Enterococcus faecalis. In conclusion, the elucidation of GAC biosynthesis in S. pyogenes reported here enhances our understanding of how other Gram-positive bacteria produce essential components of their cell wall.

https://openalex.org/W2761492606,"Notch is a major oncogenic driver in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), in part because it binds to an enhancer that increases expression of MYC. Here, we exploit the capacity of activated NOTCH1 and NOTCH3 to induce T-ALL, despite substantial divergence in their intracellular regions, as a means to elucidate a broad, common Notch-dependent oncogenomic program through systematic comparison of the transcriptomes and Notch-bound genomic regulatory elements of NOTCH1- and NOTCH3-dependent T-ALL cells. ChIP-seq studies show a high concordance of functional NOTCH1 and NOTCH3 genomic binding sites that are enriched in binding motifs for RBPJ, the transcription factor that recruits activated Notch to DNA. The interchangeability of NOTCH1 and NOTCH3 was confirmed by rescue of NOTCH1-dependent T-ALL cells with activated NOTCH3 and vice versa. Despite remarkable overall similarity, there are nuanced differences in chromatin landscapes near critical common Notch target genes, most notably at a Notch-dependent enhancer that regulates MYC, which correlates with responsiveness to Notch pathway inhibitors. Overall, a common oncogenomic program driven by binding of either Notch is sufficient to maintain T-ALL cell growth, whereas cell-context specific differences appear to influence the response of T-ALL cells to Notch inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2762392112,"Recently, some studies have evaluated the role of adiposity measures in the prediction of hypertension risk, but the results are conflicting. Thus, the aim of this study was to compare which of the four indicators of adiposity (waist circumference-WC, body mass index-BMI, body adiposity index-BAI, and visceral adiposity index-VAI) were better associated with hypertension in a Brazilian population.For this study, were selected 1627 individuals (both genders, and aged over 18 years) resident in the municipality of Baependi, a city located in the Southeast of Brazil. WC, BMI, BAI and VAI were determined according to a standard protocol. Hypertension was defined as mean systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg, and/or antihypertensive drug use. The indicators of adiposity WC, BMI, BAI, and VAI were higher in hypertensive when compared to non-hypertensive individuals. In addition, WC and BMI were most strongly associated with hypertension in men and women, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) of WC was significantly higher than VAI in men. In women, both AUC of BMI and WC showed higher discriminatory power to predict hypertension than BAI and VAI.The indicators of adiposity WC and BMI were better associated with hypertension than BAI and VAI, in both genders, and it could be a useful tools for the screening of hypertensive patients."

https://openalex.org/W2761298339,"Major histocompatibility complex class I molecules (MHC I) help protect jawed vertebrates by binding and presenting immunogenic peptides to cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Peptides are selected from a large diversity present in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, only a limited number of peptides complement the polymorphic MHC specificity determining pockets in a way that leads to high-affinity peptide binding and efficient antigen presentation. MHC I molecules possess an intrinsic ability to discriminate between peptides, which varies in efficiency between allotypes, but the mechanism of selection is unknown. Elucidation of the selection mechanism is likely to benefit future immune-modulatory therapies. Evidence suggests peptide selection involves transient adoption of alternative, presumably higher energy conformations than native peptide–MHC complexes.

To investigate the dynamic nature of MHC, we refolded MHC proteins with peptides that can be hydrolyzed by UV light and thus released. We compared the resultant peptide-receptive MHC molecules with non-hydrolyzed peptide-loaded MHC complexes by monitoring the exchange of hydrogen for deuterium in solution. We found differences in hydrogen–deuterium exchange between peptide-loaded and peptide-receptive molecules that were negated by the addition of peptide to peptide-receptive MHC molecules.

The intracellular peptide-selecting function of MHC I can be disrupted by introducing point mutations into the MHC I HC that prevent binding to tapasin (12Lewis J.W. Neisig A. Neefjes J. Elliott T.

This can be advantageous because the expression of tapasin can be down-regulated, as has been documented with a variety of tumors and which is generally associated with worse prognosis (21Jiang Q.

The murine gamma-herpesvirus-68 MK3 protein causes TAP degradation independent of MHC class I heavy chain degradation.Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Conversely, other allotypes, like HLA-B*44:02 and BF2*19:01, are inefficient at loading peptide cargo in the absence of tapasin. Tapasin therefore normalizes this variation in intrinsic “peptide selector” function across different allotypes (17Rizvi S.M. Salam N. Geng J. Qi Y. Bream J.H. Duggal P. Hussain S.K. Martinson J. Wolinsky S.M. Carrington M. Raghavan M. Distinct assembly profiles of HLA-B molecules.J. Immunol. 2014; 192: 4967-4976Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 27Bailey A. Dalchau N. Carter R. Emmott S. Phillips A. Werner J.M. Elliott T. Selector function of MHC I molecules is determined by protein plasticity.Sci. Rep. 2015; 5: 14928Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Consequently, MHC I allotypes with low intrinsic selector function are often described as being tapasin-dependent, whereas those allotypes with high intrinsic selector function are considered as being tapasin-independent, despite the fact that all MHC I allotypes benefit from tapasin to some degree (16Williams A.P. Peh C.A. Purcell A.W. McCluskey J. Elliott T. Optimization of the MHC class I peptide cargo is dependent on tapasin.Immunity. 2002; 16: 509-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The mechanism underpinning the intrinsic peptide-selecting function is not known. Molecular dynamic simulations suggest that in the absence of the stabilizing interactions provided by a bound peptide, the MHC I peptide-binding domain becomes disordered and that the adoption of such a non-native state (or states) differs between MHC I allotypes (28van Hateren A. Bailey A. Elliott T.

Immunol. 2017; 8: 65Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). By combining molecular dynamics simulations with computational models describing the in vivo peptide-selecting function of different MHC I allotypes, we have identified that the adoption of such an alternative peptide-receptive conformation (or conformations) is important for MHC I peptide selection (27Bailey A. Dalchau N. Carter R. Emmott S. Phillips A. Werner J.M. Elliott T. Selector function of MHC I molecules is determined by protein plasticity.Sci. Rep. 2015; 5: 14928Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Such a possibility is consistent with earlier findings that observed peptide-binding rates are faster than are predicted from measured dissociation rates and equilibrium constants, suggesting that MHC I molecules may change conformation during peptide binding (31Springer S. Doring K. Skipper J.C. Townsend A.R. Cerundolo V. Fast association rates suggest a conformational change in the MHC class I molecule H-2Db upon peptide binding.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3001-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Furthermore we have suggested that the “allotype-specific” parameter that determines the intrinsic peptide-selecting function of MHC I molecules is the rate at which they change from a peptide-receptive to a peptide-bound state (27Bailey A. Dalchau N. Carter R. Emmott S. Phillips A. Werner J.M. Elliott T. Selector function of MHC I molecules is determined by protein plasticity.Sci. Rep. 2015; 5: 14928Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 32Dalchau N. Phillips A. Goldstein L.D. Howarth M. Cardelli L. Emmott S. Elliott T. Werner J.M. A peptide filtering relation quantifies MHC class I peptide optimization.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2011; 7: e1002144Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, allotypes like HLA-B*44:05 and BF2*15:01, which efficiently assemble with high-affinity peptides in the absence of tapasin, may fluctuate rapidly between conformations, thereby allowing more frequent sampling of potential peptide ligands. Tapasin interacts with MHC I molecules via two sites, one in the MHC I α3 domain and a second in the peptide-binding domain (33Van Hateren A. James E. Bailey A. Phillips A. Dalchau N. Elliott T.

Kuroki K. Yamaguchi Y. Yagi-Utsumi M. Igaki T. Iguchi T. Maenaka K. Kato K. Structural and functional mosaic nature of MHC class I molecules in their peptide-free form.Mol. Immunol. 2013; 55: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). More direct studies have been hindered by the instability of MHC I molecules in the absence of peptides (42Bouvier M. Wiley D.C. Structural characterization of a soluble and partially folded class I major histocompatibility heavy chain/β2m heterodimer.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although this is true for most MHC I molecules, we have observed that two closely related chicken MHC I allotypes, BF2*15:01 and BF2*19:01, are able to adopt and retain a peptide-receptive state, generated via UV-induced hydrolysis of the bound peptide ligand, to allow comparison with their non-hydrolyzed peptide-loaded counterparts. In this report we refolded these two chicken MHC I allotypes with UV labile conditional ligands and compared them in their conditional ligand-loaded (non-hydrolyzed) and peptide-receptive (hydrolyzed) states by hydrogen–deuterium exchange mass-spectrometry (HDX-MS). With the exception of proline, all the protein backbone amide groups can exchange their hydrogen atoms with hydrogen atoms in the solvent or with deuterium atoms if a protein is transferred into a deuterated solution. The propensity of backbone amide hydrogens to exchange depends on the rate of proton exchange with the solvent and, under suitable conditions, may be limited by the opening of hydrogen bonds the nitrogen amide proton may be involved in. The opening rates of hydrogen bonds are measures of local backbone dynamics and may be modulated by a number of factors. Hydrogen–deuterium (H-D) exchange can be defined by mass spectrometry in a stop-flow-type experiment, where a rapid change of solvent, usually achieved by dilution, initiates a period of exchange, which can then be quenched by a change of pH. Digestion of the protein with a protease, such as pepsin, produces polypeptide fragments that can be separated by liquid chromatography and analyzed for proton and deuterium content by mass spectrometry. Our novel combination of HDX-MS with conditional ligand-loaded MHC I molecules enabled us to make direct observations of the differences in conformational plasticity, as measured by HDX-MS, that have until now been predicted, or indirectly inferred, to occur in MHC I molecules in the peptide-loaded and peptide-receptive states. Specifically, we sought experimental evidence for the following: (a) an increase in conformational plasticity and its localization in MHC I molecules following conditional ligand hydrolysis; (b) differences in the dynamics of MHC I allotypes that vary in their intrinsic peptide-selecting functional abilities; and; (c) the range of communication of dynamic events between the peptide-binding domain and the membrane-proximal MHC I α3 domain and the non-covalently associated β2m molecule following conditional ligand hydrolysis. We have previously shown that two closely related chicken MHC I allotypes, BF2*15:01 and BF2*19:01, which differ by eight amino acids (Table 1) but share similar peptide binding specificities (43Wallny H.J.

UV-induced hydrolysis of the conditional ligand synchronously generates peptide-receptive MHC I molecules that bind the fluorescent peptide KRLIGK*RY (where K* denotes TAMRA-labeled lysine) with near identical affinity. However, these allotypes differ in their abilities to load peptide cargo in the absence of tapasin, in their affinities and on-rates with tapasin, and as substrates for tapasin-mediated peptide dissociation (19van Hateren A.

Curli is assembled at the cell surface and consists of CsgA, the major subunit of curli, and a membrane-associated nucleator protein, CsgB. Oligomeric intermediates that accumulate during the lag phase of amyloidogenesis are generally toxic, but the underlying mechanism by which bacterial cells overcome this toxicity during curli assembly at the surface remains elusive. Here, we elucidated the mechanism of curli amyloidogenesis and provide molecular insights into the strategy by which bacteria can potentially bypass the detrimental consequences of toxic amyloid intermediates. Using a diverse range of biochemical and biophysical tools involving circular dichroism, fluorescence, Raman spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy imaging, we characterized the molecular basis of the interaction of CsgB with a membrane-mimetic anionic surfactant as well as with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) constituting the outer leaflet of Gram-negative bacteria. Aggregation studies revealed that the electrostatic interaction of the positively charged C-terminal region of the protein with a negatively charged head group of surfactant/LPS promotes a protein–protein interaction that results in facile amyloid formation without a detectable lag phase. We also show that CsgB, in the presence of surfactant/LPS, accelerates the fibrillation rate of CsgA by circumventing the lag phase during nucleation.

Nielsen P.H. We find them here, we find them there: functional bacterial amyloid.Cell Mol. Life. Sci. 2008; 65: 910-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Understanding functional amyloidogenesis will provide insights into how organisms have evolved to control amyloid propagation and minimize the associated cytotoxicity. Curli is a functional amyloid expressed in the extracellular matrix of enteric bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. (13Römling U. Bian Z. Hammar M. Sierralta W.D. Normark S.

On the cell surface, CsgA, the major subunit of curli is nucleated by membrane-anchored minor subunit CsgB (24Hammar M. Bian Z. Normark S.

The mechanism by which the bacteria bypass the toxic events during curli amyloidogenesis is poorly understood. The mechanistic studies of a variety of disease-associated proteins have revealed that amyloid formation typically follows a nucleation-dependent polymerization with a characteristic lag, elongation, and saturation phases (29Morris A.M.

The transient oligomeric intermediates formed during lag phase are known to be highly toxic compared with the mature fibrils (31Fändrich M.

Nevertheless, how enteric bacteria allow the curli assembly on its cell surface and bypass the toxic events remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that the bacterial membrane surface might be involved in the recruitment of the amyloidogenic precursors and thereby resulting in the formation of amyloid fibrils without accumulation of toxic intermediates. Outer membrane surface of Gram-negative bacteria is composed of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) containing negatively charged glycophospholipids (36Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Lipopolysaccharide endotoxins.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3356) Google Scholar). In this work, we aimed at dissecting the key molecular events of the intermolecular interactions between anionic lipids and curli subunits that allow the sequestration and subsequent polymerization into matured amyloid fibrils. Using a diverse range of tools, we first show that the electrostatic modulation between the protein and a model anionic detergent accelerates the aggregation, markedly leading to the disappearance of the typical lag phase during nucleation. Then we demonstrate that negatively charged LPS plays a pivotal role in promoting the heteronucleation during curli amyloid assembly. A line of evidences suggested that CsgB gets tethered onto the membrane, which nucleates the aggregation of CsgA (24Hammar M. Bian Z. Normark S. Nucleator-dependent intercellular assembly of adhesive curli organelles in Escherichia coli.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 6562-6566Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 26Hammer N.D. McGuffie B.A. Zhou Y. Badtke M.P. Reinke A.A. Brännström K. Gestwicki J.E. Olofsson A. Almqvist F. Chapman M.R. The C-terminal repeating units of CsgB direct bacterial functional amyloid nucleation.J. Mol. Biol. 2012; 422: 376-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Lipid A, a negatively charged glycophospholipid, forms the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria (36Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Lipopolysaccharide endotoxins.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3356) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular basis of CsgB membrane interactions, we began our studies using an anionic detergent namely SDS, which is a well-known anionic lipid mimetic (37Dalal V. Arya S. Bhattacharya M. Mukhopadhyay S. Conformational switching and nanoscale assembly of human prion protein into polymorphic amyloids via structurally labile oligomers.Biochemistry. 2015; 54: 7505-7513Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we carried out our experiments in the presence of LPS. The function of curli nucleator CsgB is directed by its C-terminal. Without R4 and R5 repeats, CsgB is secreted away from the bacterial cell surface. Hence, we speculated that both R4 and R5 might have membrane interaction. To verify whether R4 and R5 interact with membrane, we carried out experiments using CsgBtrunc or CsgBΔR5 (19 amino acids are deleted from C-terminal of CsgB) and CsgB. In this study we refer to CsgBΔR5 as CsgBt. C-terminal His-tagged CsgBt, CsgB, and CsgA were expressed and purified (see “Experimental procedures”). The purity was checked by SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. S1a) and the proteins of interest were confirmed by probing against anti-His antibody (supplemental Fig. S1b). First we monitored the aggregation kinetics of curli subunits using thioflavin T (ThT). CsgA, CsgBt, and CsgB exhibited typical nucleation-dependent polymerization kinetics with lag times of ∼120, ∼100, and ∼30 min, respectively (supplemental Fig. S1c). However, in the presence of preformed CsgBt seeds, a shortening of the lag phase in the CsgA aggregation was observed, which suggested that preformed CsgBt oligomers can nucleate the CsgA polymerization (supplemental Fig. S1c). These results are in good agreement with previous reports (23Hammer N.D. Schmidt J.C. Chapman M.R. The curli nucleator protein, CsgB, contains an amyloidogenic domain that directs CsgA polymerization.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 12494-12499Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 38Wang X. Smith D.R. Jones J.W. Chapman M.R. In vitro polymerization of a functional Escherichia coli amyloid protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3713-3719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Next, we investigated whether SDS at non-denaturing submicellar concentrations can modulate the course of CsgBt aggregation. A shortening in the lag time of CsgBt aggregation was observed with an increase in the SDS concentration ranging from 100 to 500 μm. Interestingly, in the presence of 500 μm SDS, CsgBt bypassed the nucleation phase as indicated by the absence of any apparent lag time (Fig. 1b). A complete elimination in the lag phase was also observed for CsgB in the presence of 500 μm SDS (Fig. 1c). This observation suggests that the aggregation propensity of CsgBt/CsgB is accelerated in the presence of submicellar concentrations of SDS. This aggregation might follow a non-nucleation or an isodesmic polymerization mechanism as there is no strong concentration dependence on half-time (t½), when different protein concentrations were titrated with 500 μm SDS (supplemental Fig. S1, d and e). We next monitored the secondary structural changes by using far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. CsgBt adopts a random-coil structure with minima at 200 nm. As a function of time, CD spectra showed an increase in the β-sheet-rich secondary structure (216 nm) at the expense of random coil (200 nm) and within 3 h there was a complete transition to the β-sheet (Fig. 1d). On the contrary, upon addition of SDS, CsgBt showed a rapid conformational conversion and the attained β-sheet structure within 30 min (Fig. 1e). The CD kinetics monitored at 200 nm validates that SDS induces spontaneous secondary structural changes during the fibrillation of CsgBt (Fig. 1f). We also monitored the backbone conformation of the amyloid state using vibrational Raman spectroscopy. The amide I Raman band at 1670 cm−1 exhibited by both (with and without SDS) fibrils indicated the formation of a cross-β structure, which is a hallmark of an amyloid (Fig. 1f) (39Bhattacharya M. Jain N. Dogra P. Samai S. Mukhopadhyay S. Nanoscopic amyloid pores formed via stepwise protein assembly.J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2013; 4: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Therefore, our ThT fluorescence assays together with the CD and Raman spectroscopic data show that the SDS–CsgBt interaction facilitates the conformational change and accelerates amyloid fibrillation by minimizing or eliminating the lag phase. Next, we embarked upon studies aimed at elucidating the mechanism of CsgBt polymerization in the presence of SDS. To do this we have used 9-(2,2-dicyanovinyl)julolidine (DCVJ), a molecular rotor, which shows an enhanced fluorescence upon binding to the early oligomers of protein aggregates (40Narang D. Singh A. Swasthi H.M. Mukhopadhyay S. Characterization of salt-induced oligomerization of human β2-microglobulin at low pH.J. Phys. Chem. B. 2016; 120: 7815-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). DCVJ is weakly fluorescent in buffer, and as a function of CsgBt aggregation, a slow increase in DCVJ fluorescence was observed that was saturated by ∼4 h (Fig. 2, a and b). Upon addition of SDS to CsgBt, there was a rapid increase in DCVJ fluorescence and reached a plateau within ∼30 min. The DCVJ fluorescence results indicated that SDS facilitates rapid oligomerization of CsgBt. Next, we performed the glutaraldehyde cross-linking assay to monitor the formation of soluble oligomers. We observed that the SDS-treated sample has much a lower content of monomeric protein compared with the untreated sample (supplemental Fig. S2a). The depletion of the monomer/dimer population in the SDS-treated sample provided an additional evidence of early oligomerzation (supplemental Fig. S2a). To gain insights into the nanoscale morphology of the transient intermediates, we next utilized atomic force microscopy (AFM). At early time points, CsgBt forms protofibrils of ∼5 nm height (Fig. 2c). These protofibrils convert into matured fibrils upon prolonged incubation (Fig. 2d). Interestingly, the fibrils exhibited two distinct height distribution, 8–10 and 20–25 nm indicating that the fibrils are laterally associated to form bundles (supplemental Fig. S2b), as described previously for the CsgA fibrils (41Shewmaker F. McGlinchey R.P. Thurber K.R. McPhie P. Dyda F. Tycko R. Wickner R.B. The functional curli amyloid is not based on in-register parallel β-sheet structure.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 25065-25076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The bundle formation might be the possible reason for the high stability of curli and require formic acid to disintegrate these fibrils (14Chapman M.R. Robinson L.S. Pinkner J.S. Roth R. Heuser J. Hammar M. Normark S. Hultgren S.J. Role of Escherichia coli curli operons in directing amyloid fiber formation.Science. 2002; 295: 851-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). In the presence of SDS, CsgBt formed spherical oligomers with an average height of 8–10 nm (Fig. 2e). The oligomers convert into amyloid fibrils upon overnight incubation (Fig. 2f). Therefore, both our AFM and cross-linking results corroborated our DCVJ data, which suggested that the SDS–CsgBt interaction leads to the formation of higher order species. The absence of the lag phase observed in the kinetics of ThT fluorescence, CD, and DCVJ fluorescence indicate that the SDS-CsgBt interaction leads to the rapid formation of β-rich obligatory oligomers and allows the protein to bypass the nucleation phase. We next aimed at delineating the physicochemical basis of the SDS-CsgBt interaction. It was shown previously that the C-terminal region of CsgB containing the R4 and R5 are essential for anchoring and proper localization of the protein onto the membrane and without these repeats CsgB is secreted away from the cell (26Hammer N.D. McGuffie B.A. Zhou Y. Badtke M.P. Reinke A.A. Brännström K. Gestwicki J.E. Olofsson A. Almqvist F. Chapman M.R. The C-terminal repeating units of CsgB direct bacterial functional amyloid nucleation.J. Mol. Biol. 2012; 422: 376-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To monitor whether the C-terminal segment is responsible for the initiation of aggregation, we incorporated a tryptophan (Trp) at the C-terminal end (Y129W). CsgBt is devoid of Trp and therefore we envisioned that the single Trp mutant at R4 will report the early events of the aggregation. This Y129W mutant of CsgBt displayed aggregation kinetics similar to that of CsgBt indicating that the mutation did not alter the aggregation propensity of the protein (supplemental Fig. S3a). We next recorded several fluorescence readouts to monitor the aggregation process. Trp is an environmently-sensitive fluorescent probe (42Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 3 Ed. Springer, New York2006Crossref Scopus (17811) Google Scholar). Before aggregation, Y129W showed an emission maxima at ∼345 nm, which suggested that the Trp is solvent exposed. However, during the course of aggregation, there was a progressive blue shift of ∼8 nm indicating that the C-terminal segment harboring Trp gets buried (supplemental Fig. S3b). Interestingly, in the presence of SDS, Y129W exhibited a blue shift in the emission maxima (∼334 nm) that did not undergo any further shift upon aggregation (supplemental Fig. S3c). This result indicated that the structure formation at the C-terminal segment of CsgBt was very rapid in the presence of SDS during the oligomerization (Fig. 3a). Next, we monitored the fluorescence anisotropy that provides the information about the rotational mobility of the fluorophore (42Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 3 Ed. Springer, New York2006Crossref Scopus (17811) Google Scholar). Without SDS, Y129W exhibited a low fluorescence anisotropy of ∼0.06 (Fig. 3b). The low anisotropy value indicates that Trp resides in a highly flexible region of disordered CsgBt. During the aggregation, the anisotropy showed a typical nucleation-dependent kinetics and increased to ∼0.16. The increase in the fluorescence anisotropy is due to the disorder-to-order transition during aggregation that causes a restriction in the mobility of Trp. In the presence of SDS, the initial Trp fluorescence anisotropy is much higher (∼0.13) and reached a plateau (∼0.18) during the aggregation without a lag phase (Fig. 3b). The initial increase in the Trp anisotropy upon addition of SDS indicates the increase in the rotational hindrance arising due to the rapid oligomerization of CsgBt. Taken together, our Trp fluorescence results show that the C-terminal region of CsgBt harboring the R4 repeat interacts with anionic SDS. This region of CsgBt contains positively charged residues such as lysine (Fig. 1a). Therefore, we conjectured that the interaction between the C-terminal segment of CsgBt and SDS is driven by the electrostatic interaction. To test this, we next carried out aggregation experiments in the presence of salt. The kinetics of aggregation in the presence of salt is much slower than in the absence of salt, indicating that higher ionic strength decelerates the aggregation of CsgBt even in the presence of SDS (Fig. 3c). Interestingly, with the"

Moreover, phospho-deficient OGT (S20A) cells attenuated cellular O-GlcNAcylation levels and also reduced phosphorylation of Ser-71 in the cytoskeletal protein vimentin, a modification critical for severing vimentin filament during cytokinesis. Consequently, elongated vimentin bridges were observed in cells depleted of OGT via an siOGT-based approach. Lastly, expression of plasmids resistant to siOGT efficiently rescued the vimentin bridge phenotype, but the OGT-S20A rescue plasmids did not.

Furthermore, OGT has also been shown to modify vimentin (5Slawson C. Lakshmanan T. Knapp S. Hart G.W.

Vimentin is phosphorylated at G2/M by cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) at Ser-55 (7Tsujimura K. Ogawara M. Takeuchi Y. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Ha M.H. Inagaki M.

Besides, vimentin is also phosphorylated by Aurora B at Ser-72 and Rho kinase at Ser-71, leading to localization of phosphorylated vimentin to the cleavage furrow from anaphase to cytokinesis (9Goto H.

When 12 mitosis-related phosphorylation sites were mutated to Ala and the resultant VIMSA/SA knock-in mice were generated, the mice manifested binucleation and aneuploidy in the lens, age-related cataracts, and skin defects, suggestive of premature aging (12Matsuyama M.

Chk1 orchestrates replication, DNA damage checkpoints, the spindle assembly checkpoint, and cytokinesis (14Peddibhotla S. Lam M.H. Gonzalez-Rimbau M. Rosen J.M.

ATR and a Chk1-Aurora B pathway coordinate postmitotic genome surveillance with cytokinetic abscission.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2015; 26: 2217-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Abrogation of Chk1 induces cytokinetic regression, binucleation, and myriad cytokinetic defects (14Peddibhotla S. Lam M.H. Gonzalez-Rimbau M. Rosen J.M. The DNA-damage effector checkpoint kinase 1 is essential for chromosome segregation and cytokinesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 5159-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The detailed mechanism of Chk1 in cytokinesis remains unresolved. In an effort to identify more potential Chk1 interacting proteins, we performed mass spectrometry (MS) analysis following immunoprecipitation (IP) and found OGT. We show here that Chk1 interacts with and phosphorylates OGT at Ser-20, which is a prerequisite of OGT stability. Attenuation of OGT protein levels by siRNA treatment or the S20A mutation hampers the phosphorylation of vimentin at Ser-71, resulting in a failure of vimentin bridge disassembly. Our results not only exemplified another crosstalk between O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation, but also revealed the molecular underpinning of Chk1's role in cytokinesis. To investigate potential proteins that interact with Chk1, we performed an IP experiment using anti-Chk1 antibodies followed by MS analysis and identified OGT (Fig. 1A). To validate the interaction, HeLa cells were subject to IP experiments using anti-Chk1 and anti-OGT antibodies. OGT was detected in anti-Chk1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1B), suggesting that endogenous Chk1 and OGT co-immunoprecipitate. To exclude the possibility that the endogenous interaction was because of nonspecificity of the antibodies, we transfected HeLa cells with epitope-tagged Chk1 and OGT plasmids and performed co-IP experiments. As shown in Fig. 1, C and D, both HA-tagged and Myc-tagged OGT interacted with FLAG-Chk1. To test whether the interaction between OGT and Chk1 was direct, we transfected HA-OGT into HeLa cells and used recombinant GST-Chk1 to perform pulldown assays (Fig. 1E). GST-Chk1 could pull down HA-OGT (Fig. 1E). Reciprocally, GST-OGT also could pull down FLAG-Chk1 (Fig. 1F). Taken together, these data suggest that Chk1 interacts with OGT. In a previous investigation (16Blasius M. Forment J.V. Thakkar N. Wagner S.A. Choudhary C. Jackson S.P. A phospho-proteomic screen identifies substrates of the checkpoint kinase Chk1.Genome Biol. 2011; 12: R78Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), OGT was identified in a phospho-proteomic screen of Chk1, and Ser-20 of OGT was identified as one of the phosphorylation sites. We constructed OGT(S20A) plasmids accordingly, and verified this possibility by in vitro kinase (IVK) assays. Commercially available GST-Chk1 was incubated with GST-OGT or GST-OGT(S20A) proteins and subject to IVK assays. Chk1 phosphorylated OGT efficiently but not the OGT(S20A) mutant (Fig. 2A). The amino acid residues surrounding Ser-20 were examined for a Chk1 kinase consensus motif, and a minimum consensus for Chk1-dependent phosphorylation was identified (Fig. 2B). We then prepared a phospho-specific antibody toward OGT–pSer-20 as described in “Experimental Procedures” and adopted IVK assays with the pSer-20 antibodies. Chk1 efficiently phosphorylated wild-type (WT) OGT, but not the OGT(S20A) mutant (Fig. 2C). We also tested whether OGT is phosphorylated by Chk1 in vivo. The pSer-20 antibodies specifically detected a band in the HeLa cell extracts, which was significantly attenuated when cells were treated with UCN-01, a specific inhibitor of Chk1 (Fig. 2D). Then HeLa cells were transfected with vectors or HA-OGT-WT plasmids, and synchronized in cytokinesis or left unsynchronized. When treated with UCN-01, the signal of the antibody markedly decreased (Fig. 2E). We sought to determine when the phosphorylation event occurs during the cell cycle. HeLa cell extracts were synchronized by thymidine-nocodazole (Noc) block, and then released. Cell extracts were taken at different time points, prepared, and blotted with the pSer-20 antibodies and subject to flow cytometry analysis. A crisp band was discernable only after the percentage of mitotic cells started to decline (Fig. 2F, lane 2). These results suggest that Chk1 specifically phosphorylates OGT at Ser-20. OGT has been shown to be poly-ubiquitinated and subject to proteasome-mediated degradation (17Dey A. Seshasayee D. Noubade R. French D.M. Liu J. Chaurushiya M.S. Kirkpatrick D.S. Pham V.C. Lill J.R. Bakalarski C.E. Wu J. Phu L. Katavolos P. LaFave L.M. Abdel-Wahab O. et al.Loss of the tumor suppressor BAP1 causes myeloid transformation.Science. 2012; 337: 1541-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether Chk1-dependent phosphorylation of OGT at Ser-20 modulates OGT abundance. HeLa cells were transfected with HA-OGT WT or S20A plasmids, and treated with cycloheximide (CHX), a protein synthesis inhibitor. Cell extracts were collected at different time points, and subject to immunoblotting (IB). OGT(S20A) displayed significantly shorter half-life than WT (Fig. 3, A and B). Moreover, we examined the ubiquitination levels of OGT by transfecting HA-Ub and Myc-OGT WT or S20A plasmids into HeLa cells. We observed elevated ubiquitination levels in OGT(S20A) (Fig. 3C), consistent with more rapid turnover of OGT(S20A). In addition, we examined interplay between Chk1 kinase activity and OGT ubiquitination levels by treating the cells with UCN-01. As shown in Fig. 3D, OGT displayed more robust poly-ubiquitination upon UCN-01 treatment. Taken together, these results suggest that Chk1 plays a pivotal role in stabilizing OGT. We then addressed the question concerning in which intracellular compartments the phosphorylated OGT resides. As shown in Fig. 4A, pSer-20 of OGT localizes to the midbody, suggesting that phosphorylated OGT could take part in cytokinesis. This is also in line with previous findings that OGT localizes to the midbody (5Slawson C. Lakshmanan T. Knapp S. Hart G.W. A mitotic GlcNAcylation/phosphorylation signaling complex alters the posttranslational state of the cytoskeletal protein vimentin.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 4130-4140Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To determine that the localization was not because of fortuitous binding of the phospho-antibody, we adopted two siRNA oligos targeting OGT, both of which efficiently depleted OGT protein levels (Fig. 4B). Upon siOGT, the midbody localization of pSer-20 significantly decreased (Fig. 4, C and D), suggesting that the midbody localization was indeed specific to OGT–pSer-20. Then we assessed whether the midbody localization pattern was dependent on Chk1. When we used siCHK1 to deplete Chk1 (Fig. 4E), the midbody localization of pSer-20 was also attenuated (Fig. 4F). Upon quantitation, the midbody staining was compromised upon siCHK1 (Fig. 4G), suggesting that Chk1-dependent phosphorylation of OGT localizes to the midbody. Previous investigations have implicated interplay of O-GlcNAcylation with phosphorylation in regulating vimentin (5Slawson C. Lakshmanan T. Knapp S. Hart G.W. A mitotic GlcNAcylation/phosphorylation signaling complex alters the posttranslational state of the cytoskeletal protein vimentin.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 4130-4140Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Specifically, both OGT and OGA over-expression boosted vimentin–pSer-71 in mitosis (5Slawson C. Lakshmanan T. Knapp S. Hart G.W. A mitotic GlcNAcylation/phosphorylation signaling complex alters the posttranslational state of the cytoskeletal protein vimentin.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 4130-4140Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We sought to examine whether OGT depletion or OGT(S20A) was also implicated in regulating vimentin phosphorylation during cytokinesis. HeLa cells were transfected with two distinct oligos targeting OGT, and then synchronized in the cytokinetic stage (Fig. 5A). The resultant cell extracts were subject to IB to examine O-GlcNAc together with vimentin pSer-71 levels. Our results indicate that decreased O-GlcNAc readily correlated with curbed vimentin–pSer-71 levels (Fig. 5A). Given that suppressed vimentin–pSer-71 may impede vimentin filament severing and subsequent vimentin bridge formation, we reasoned that decreased O-GlcNAc levels may thus lead to vimentin bridges. We verified our hypothesis by examining vimentin staining in siOGT cells (Fig. 5B). Although vimentin staining was lacking in the midbody area in control cells, vimentin formed conspicuous bridges in the siOGT cells (Fig. 5B). Upon quantitation, cells harboring cytokinetic defects increased markedly in siOGT cells (Fig. 5C). We then sought to examine the cellular defects of OGT(S20A). Rescue plasmids were constructed. They efficiently recovered endogenous OGT levels, but were resistant to siOGT treatment (Fig. 6A). In these cells, vimentin–pSer-71 levels were significantly lower in cells harboring S20A, but higher in S20D (Fig. 6A), suggesting that OGT(S20A) is detrimental to vimentin phosphorylation at Ser-71. Indeed, when examined under the fluorescence microscopy, S20A cells did manifest vimentin bridges, as the cells depleted of OGT did, but not in the S20D counterparts (Fig. 6B). Upon quantitation (Fig. 6C), S20A contained more cytokinetic defective cells, suggesting that S20A causes cytokinetic defects via dampened vimentin–pSer-71 levels. If the Chk1–OGT–vimentin pathway stands true in modulating cytokinesis, then Chk1 should have a direct role in vimentin phosphorylation and polymerization. We utilized siCHK1 in synchronized cytokinetic cells and examined biochemically whether vimentin–pSer-71 was affected (Fig. 7A), and evidently there was a 30% decrease. Cytologically we applied the Chk1 inhibitor UCN-01 in cells, and vimentin bridges were abundant (Fig. 7, B and C). Taken together, the cytokinetic defects observed in Chk1-depleted cells could be attributed to, at least in part, failure of intermediate filaments to disassemble. OGT is the sole enzyme in humans that accounts for all the O-GlcNAcylation reactions. Recently an intricate role of OGT in cytokinesis emerged. Here we show that Chk1 interacts with OGT, and phosphorylates OGT at Ser-20 both in vitro and in vivo. OGT–pSer-20 localizes to the midbody, and underscores the stability of OGT. Vimentin, subject to both phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation, mediates the intermediate filament bridge formation and severing during cytokinesis. We discovered that attenuation of O-GlcNAcylation reduces vimentin–pSer-71 during cytokinesis. Because vimentin–pSer-71 is a prerequisite of vimentin filament disassembly, it is conceivable that vimentin–pSer-71 levels provide the molecular underpinning of cytokinesis defects induced by OGT or Chk1 depletion (Fig. 7D). The modifications of OGT are far from being known. OGT has been shown to be ubiquitinated and deubiquitinated. The E3 ligase of OGT has recently been identified to be the histone demethylase LSD2 (18Yang Y. Yin X. Yang H. Xu Y. Histone demethylase LSD2 acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase and inhibits cancer cell growth through promoting proteasomal degradation of OGT.Mol. Cell. 2015; 58: 47-59Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). LSD2 not only demethylates H3K4me1/me2, but also ubiquitinates OGT and promotes its subsequent proteome-dependent degradation, thus suppressing tumorigenesis (18Yang Y. Yin X. Yang H. Xu Y.

Cell. 2015; 58: 47-59Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The deubiquitination enzyme has been identified to be the tumor suppressor BRCA1-associated protein-1 (BAP1) (17Dey A. Seshasayee D. Noubade R. French D.M. Liu J. Chaurushiya M.S. Kirkpatrick D.S. Pham V.C. Lill J.R. Bakalarski C.E. Wu J. Phu L. Katavolos P. LaFave L.M. Abdel-Wahab O. et al.Loss of the tumor suppressor BAP1 causes myeloid transformation.Science. 2012; 337: 1541-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). BAP1 depletion efficiently decreased OGT levels (17Dey A. Seshasayee D. Noubade R. French D.M. Liu J. Chaurushiya M.S. Kirkpatrick D.S. Pham V.C. Lill J.R. Bakalarski C.E. Wu J. Phu L. Katavolos P. LaFave L.M. Abdel-Wahab O. et al.Loss of the tumor suppressor BAP1 causes myeloid transformation.Science. 2012; 337: 1541-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Besides ubiquitination, OGT is also phosphorylated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) at Thr-444 (19Xu Q. Yang C. Du Y. Chen Y. Liu H. Deng M. Zhang H. Zhang L. Liu T. Liu Q. Wang L. Lou Z. Pei H. AMPK regulates histone H2B O-GlcNAcylation.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 5594-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 20Bullen J.W. Balsbaugh J.L. Chanda D. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F.

AMPK regulates histone H2B O-GlcNAcylation.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 5594-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Our results thus unveil a second phosphorylation site of OGT that occurs specifically at the cytokinetic stage. How and why pSer-20 crosstalks with ubiquitination remains to be clarified, because the ubiquitination residues are yet to be identified. Our results do not preclude the possibility that Chk1 is O-GlcNAcylated by OGT. Indeed, in a proteomic screen for proteins involved in DNA damage response, Chk1 was identified to be O-GlcNAcylated (21Zhong J. Martinez M. Sengupta S. Lee A. Wu X. Chaerkady R. Chatterjee A. O'Meally R.N. Cole R.N. Pandey A. Zachara N.E. Quantitative phosphoproteomics reveals crosstalk between phosphorylation and O-GlcNAc in the DNA damage response pathway.Proteomics. 2015; 15: 591-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Chk1 phosphorylation profiles changed upon OGT deletion (21Zhong J. Martinez M. Sengupta S. Lee A. Wu X. Chaerkady R. Chatterjee A. O'Meally R.N. Cole R.N. Pandey A. Zachara N.E. Quantitative phosphoproteomics reveals crosstalk between phosphorylation and O-GlcNAc in the DNA damage response pathway.Proteomics. 2015; 15: 591-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Specifically, pThr-113 increased 2.2-fold whereas pSer-151 decreased 0.7-fold. Therefore, it is highly unlikely a simple friend or foe relationship exists between O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation, as far as Chk1 is concerned. Perhaps it came as a bit of a surprise that O-GlcNAcylation of vimentin actually promotes phosphorylation at Ser-71. This is not unprecedented, however. Although O-GlcNAcylation vies with phosphorylation in a great many cases, it may enhance phosphorylation at times. Indeed, when active phosphorylation sites were closely monitored in a study where O-GlcNAcylation was elevated, 148 phosphorylation sites were increased and 280 phosphorylation sites were reduced (2Wang Z. Gucek M. Hart G.W. Cross-talk between GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation: Site-specific phosphorylation dynamics in response to globally elevated O-GlcNAc.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 13793-13798Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). As mentioned previously, Chk1 pSer-151 decreased upon OGT depletion (21Zhong J. Martinez M. Sengupta S. Lee A. Wu X. Chaerkady R. Chatterjee A. O'Meally R.N. Cole R.N. Pandey A. Zachara N.E. Quantitative phosphoproteomics reveals crosstalk between phosphorylation and O-GlcNAc in the DNA damage response pathway.Proteomics. 2015; 15: 591-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Hence, it is not a simple relationship of competition between the two modifications. We speculate that O-GlcNAcylation may augment Rho kinase activity, the kinase responsible for pSer-71 of vimentin. Multiple lines of genetic evidence are congruent with the idea. First, in endothelium-denuded rat aortas, OGT inhibition via PUGNAc (OGA inhibitor) stimulated contraction to phenylephrine, which was abolished by the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 (22Lima V.V. Giachini F.R. Carneiro F.S. Carvalho M.H. Fortes Z.B. Webb R.C. Tostes R.C. O-GlcNAcylation contributes to the vascular effects of ET-1 via activation of the RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway.Cardiovasc. Res. 2011; 89: 614-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Second, in the same aorta system, glucosamine was utilized to induce O-GlcNAcylation of proteins by increasing the influx of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway that feeds into the O-GlcNAc pathway. Glucosamine also elevated RhoA activity, which was negated by OGT inhibition (23Kim D.H. Seok Y.M. Kim I.K. Lee I.K. Jeong S.Y. Jeoung N.H. Glucosamine increases vascular contraction through activation of RhoA/Rho kinase pathway in isolated rat aorta.BMB Rep. 2011; 44: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Lastly, in SKOV3 and 59M ovarian cells, siRNA targeting OGT suppressed the cellular migration and invasion, whereas Thiamet-G (OGA inhibitor) bolstered it. More importantly, Thiamet-G boosted RhoA activity and the phosphorylation of Rho kinase substrates, whereas siOGT dampened RhoA activity and subsequent Rho kinase substrate phosphorylation (24Niu Y. Xia Y. Wang J. Shi X. O-GlcNAcylation promotes migration and invasion in human ovarian cancer cells via the RhoA/ROCK/MLC pathway.Mol. Med. Rep. 2017; 15: 2083-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Collectively, O-GlcNAcylation may fuel the RhoA/Rho kinase signaling pathway. Besides cytokinesis, vimentin also plays various roles in various stages of cancer, including tumorigenesis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and ultimately metastasis (25Shi A.M. Tao Z.Q. Li R. Wang Y.Q. Wang X. Zhao J. Vimentin and post-translational modifications in cell motility during cancer[em]a review.Eur. Rev. Med. Pharmacol. Sci. 2016; 20: 2603-2606PubMed Google Scholar), in human hepatocellular carcinoma (26Pan T.L. Wang P.W. Huang C.C. Yeh C.T. Hu T.H. Yu J.S.

Proteomics. 2012; 75: 4676-4692Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), lung cancer (27Kidd M.E. Shumaker D.K. Ridge K.M. The role of vimentin intermediate filaments in the progression of lung cancer.Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2014; 50: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and breast cancer (28Whipple R.A. Balzer E.M. Cho E.H. Matrone M.A. Yoon J.R. Martin S.S. Vimentin filaments support extension of tubulin-based microtentacles in detached breast tumor cells.Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 5678-5688Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), just to name a few. There has been increasing awareness that vimentin expression elevation correlates with more intensive cancer cell migration and invasion, which could be attributed to the interconnection between vimentin and actin (29Jiu Y. Peränen J. Schaible N. Cheng F. Eriksson J.E. Krishnan R. Lappalainen P. Vimentin intermediate filaments control actin stress fiber assembly through GEF-H1 and RhoA.J. Cell Sci. 2017; 130: 892-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), as filamentous vimentin controls actin stress fiber assembly and contractile actomyosin bundles, thus promoting metastasis. Alternatively, vimentin filaments could support extension of microtubule protrusions upon tumor cells detaching from the extracellular matrix (28Whipple R.A. Balzer E.M. Cho E.H. Matrone M.A. Yoon J.R. Martin S.S. Vimentin filaments support extension of tubulin-based microtentacles in detached breast tumor cells.Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 5678-5688Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and in this way assist a successful tumor cell spread. In either case, an intact vimentin filament is indispensable, and decreased vimentin–pSer-71 may well lend a hand to filament formation. We envision that the Chk1–OGT–vimentin pathway may play a role in cell cycle control and beyond. HeLa and HEK293 cells were purchased from ATCC. Anti-OGT antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-32921), anti-O-GlcNAc antibodies (RL2) from Abcam, and anti-vimentin–pSer-71 antibodies from Abcam (ab115189).

Briefly, cell cultures were first blocked by double thymidine, and collected 9 h after releasing from the second thymidine block. HeLa cells were transfected twice with a 24-h interval using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Transfectants were used for further experiments 24 h after the second transfection. All small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotide duplexes were purchased from Dharmacon.

Primers used to construct OGT-rescue plasmids were 5′-CCG AAC TTTGCA GTA GCT TGG AGC AAC CTT GGC TGT GTT-3′. For plasmid transfection, cells were seeded at 50–60% confluence/10 cm2 Petri dish and transfected with 7.5 μg of plasmid DNA using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer’s instructions for immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments. Chk1 in vitro kinase assay was performed as described previously. Briefly, recombinant Chk1 kinase was purchased from R&D Systems (catalog no. 1630-KS), incubated with purified GST-OGT with 1 m HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 m MgCl2, 1 m dithiothreitol, 0.1 m Na3VO4, 0.1 mm ATP or 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After 20 min at 30 °C, reactions were stopped by the sample buffer. Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and phosphate incorporation was determined by phosphorimager.

https://openalex.org/W2760922316,"In response to DNA cross-linking damage, the Fanconi anemia (FA) core complex activates the FA pathway by monoubiquitinating Fanconi anemia complementation group D2 (FANCD2) for the initiation of the nucleolytic processing of the DNA cross-links and stabilization of stalled replication forks. Given that all the classic FA proteins coordinately monoubiquitinate FANCD2, it is unclear why losses of individual classic FA genes yield varying cellular sensitivities to cross-linking damage. To address this question, we generated cellular knock-out models of FA core complex components and FANCD2 and found that FANCD2-null mutants display higher levels of spontaneous chromosomal damage and hypersensitivity to replication-blocking lesions than Fanconi anemia complementation group L (FANCL)-null mutants, suggesting that FANCD2 provides a basal level of DNA protection countering endogenous lesions in the absence of monoubiquitination. FANCD2's ubiquitination-independent function is likely involved in optimized recruitment of nucleolytic activities for the processing and protection of stressed replication forks. Our results reveal that FANCD2 has a ubiquitination-independent role in countering endogenous levels of replication stress, a function that is critical for the maintenance of genomic stability.

https://openalex.org/W2762866660,"In two studies we disentangled and systematically investigated the impact of subtle facial cues to masculinity/femininity and gender category information on first impressions. Participants judged the same unambiguously male and female target persons-either with masculine or feminine facial features slightly enhanced-regarding stereotypically masculine (i.e., competence) and feminine (i.e., warmth) personality traits. Results of both studies showed a strong effect of facial masculinity/femininity: Masculine-looking persons were seen as colder and more competent than feminine-looking persons. This effect of facial masculinity/femininity was not only found for typical (i.e., masculine-looking men and feminine-looking women) and atypical (i.e., masculine-looking women and feminine-looking men) category members; it was even found to be more pronounced for atypical than for typical category members. This finding reveals that comparing atypical members to the group prototype results in pronounced effects of facial masculinity/femininity. These contrast effects for atypical members predominate assimilation effects for typical members. Intriguingly, very subtle facial cues to masculinity/femininity strongly guide first impressions and may have more impact than the gender category."
https://openalex.org/W2763389670,"Background Fishing communities around Lake Victoria in sub-Saharan Africa have been characterised as a population at high risk of HIV-infection. Methods Using data from a cohort of HIV-positive individuals aged 13–49 years, enrolled from 5 fishing communities on Lake Victoria between 2009–2011, we sought to identify factors contributing to the epidemic and to understand the underlying structure of HIV transmission networks. Clinical and socio-demographic data were combined with HIV-1 phylogenetic analyses. HIV-1 gag-p24 and env-gp-41 sub-genomic fragments were amplified and sequenced from 283 HIV-1-infected participants. Phylogenetic clusters with ≥2 highly related sequences were defined as transmission clusters. Logistic regression models were used to determine factors associated with clustering. Results Altogether, 24% (n = 67/283) of HIV positive individuals with sequences fell within 34 phylogenetically distinct clusters in at least one gene region (either gag or env). Of these, 83% occurred either within households or within community; 8/34 (24%) occurred within household partnerships, and 20/34 (59%) within community. 7/12 couples (58%) within households clustered together. Individuals in clusters with potential recent transmission (11/34) were more likely to be younger 71% (15/21) versus 46% (21/46) in un-clustered individuals and had recently become resident in the community 67% (14/21) vs 48% (22/46). Four of 11 (36%) potential transmission clusters included incident-incident transmissions. Independently, clustering was less likely in HIV subtype D (adjusted Odds Ratio, aOR = 0.51 [95% CI 0.26–1.00]) than A and more likely in those living with an HIV-infected individual in the household (aOR = 6.30 [95% CI 3.40–11.68]). Conclusions A large proportion of HIV sexual transmissions occur within house-holds and within communities even in this key mobile population. The findings suggest localized HIV transmissions and hence a potential benefit for the test and treat approach even at a community level, coupled with intensified HIV counselling to identify early infections."
https://openalex.org/W2762928163,"Objectives Cultivation of compassion is a useful way to treat mental problems, but some individuals show resistance. Fears of compassion can be an obstacle for clinicians when providing psychotherapy, and for clients when engaging in interpersonal relationships. Despite its importance, a Japanese version of fears of compassion scales (for others, from others, and for self) has not yet been developed. This study developed a Japanese version of the Fears of Compassion Scales and tested its reliability and validity. Design This study used a cross-sectional design, and a self-report procedure for collecting data. Methods A total of 485 students (121 males and 364 females) answered self-report questionnaires, including the draft Fears of Compassion Scales—Japanese version. Results There were distinctive factor structures for fear of compassion from others, and for self. The fear of compassion from others scale consisted of concern about compassion from others and avoidance of compassion from others. All scales had good internal consistency, test-retest reliability, face validity, and construct validity. Discrimination and difficulty were also calculated. Conclusions These results indicate that the Fears of Compassion Scales—Japanese version is a well-constructed and useful measure to assess fears of compassion and the existence of cultural differences in fears of compassion."

Strikingly, F. nucleatum achieves virulence in the absence of large, multiprotein secretion systems (Types I, II, III, IV, and VI), which are widely used by Gram-negative bacteria for pathogenesis. By contrast, F. nucleatum strains contain genomic expansions of Type V secreted effectors (autotransporters) that are critical for host cell adherence, invasion, and biofilm formation. Here, we present the first characterization of an F. nucleatum Type Vd phospholipase class A1 autotransporter (strain ATCC 25586, gene FN1704) that we hereby rename Fusobacterium phospholipase autotransporter (FplA). Biochemical analysis of multiple Fusobacterium strains revealed that FplA is expressed as a full-length 85-kDa outer membrane–embedded protein or as a truncated phospholipase domain that remains associated with the outer membrane. Whereas the role of Type Vd secretion in bacteria remains unidentified, we show that FplA binds with high affinity to host phosphoinositide-signaling lipids, revealing a potential role for this enzyme in establishing an F. nucleatum intracellular niche. To further analyze the role of FplA, we developed an fplA gene knock-out strain, which will guide future in vivo studies to determine its potential role in F. nucleatum pathogenesis. In summary, using recombinant FplA constructs, we have identified a biochemical toolbox that includes lipid substrates for enzymatic assays, potent inhibitors, and chemical probes to detect, track, and characterize the role of Type Vd secreted phospholipases in Gram-negative bacteria.

In a process that requires multiple chaperones (e.g. BAM complex), the large N-terminal passenger domain is present on the surface or cleaved and secreted after β-barrel translocation. The recent biochemical and structural characterization of the Type Vd autotransporter PlpD from Pseudomonas aeruginosa revealed a secreted N-terminal patatin-like protein (PFAM: PF01734) with an α-β hydrolase fold containing a catalytic dyad (Ser and Asp) conferring phospholipase A1 activity (EC 3.1.1.32) through the hydrolysis of glycerophospholipid moieties at the sn-1 position to release a fatty acid (32Salacha R.

Subversion of phosphoinositide metabolism by intracellular bacterial pathogens.Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1026-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Our analysis revealed that most F. nucleatum genomes each contain one gene (in strain ATCC 25586, gene FN1704, UniProtKB-Q8R6F6; herein renamed fplA) encoding for a previously uncharacterized ∼85-kDa Type Vd autotransporter that is homologous to PlpD. Bioinformatic analysis of F. nucleatum strains reveals that most strains also contain a single gene encoding for an additional small patatin domain–containing protein (∼32 kDa) (FN0508, UniProtKB-Q8R6A1) that is not a Type Vd autotransporter and does not contain a predicted signal sequence for export from the bacterial cytoplasm. Whereas the role of Type Vd secreted phospholipases has not been determined, bacterial phospholipases play critical roles in the virulence of intracellular bacteria by promoting phagosome survival or by aiding in vacuole lysis to achieve liberation into the cytoplasm and subversion of host lysosomal induced death (35Istivan T.S.

Bacterial pathogens, including Helicobacter, Listeria, Salmonella, Shigella, Pseudomonas, and Legionella, rely on phospholipases for virulence, survival, and some for intercellular spread (36Flores-Díaz M.

Listeria monocytogenes secretes two phospholipase C proteins (PI-PLC and PC-PLC) that are critical for late time point evasion of autophagy and establishment of an intracellular niche (39Birmingham C.L.

Here, we present studies that probe the molecular mechanisms of the Type Vd secreted autotransporter phospholipase FplA using a diverse set of chemical and biological tools. These experiments have strengthened our understanding of the Type Vd secretion and will aid in determining the role of FplA in F. nucleatum pathogenesis. Fusobacterium phospholipase autotransporter (FplA, UniProtKB-Q8R6F6) was identified as the gene previously labeled FN1704 in F. nucleatum ATCC 25586. Domain identification was carried out using SignalP version 4.1 to identify a signal sequence (residues 1–19), and the SWISS-MODEL (40Biasini M. Bienert S. Waterhouse A. Arnold K. Studer G. Schmidt T. Kiefer F. Gallo Cassarino T. Bertoni M. Bordoli L. Schwede T.

In addition, we identified a unique 40-amino acid N-terminal extension (residues 20–59) that plays a role in the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme, probably by being critical for proper protein folding and position of the active site residues, and not substrate binding. Structure prediction of this enzyme revealed that the N-terminal patatin domain is highly similar to PlpD from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PDB 2The abbreviations used are: PDBProtein Data BankPLA1phospholipase A14-Mu4-methylumbeliferone4-MuB4-methylumbelliferyl butyrate4-MuH4-methylumbelliferyl heptanoateMAFPmethylarachidonyl fluorophosphonateATFMKarachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketoneIDEFPisopropyl dodec-11-enylfluorophosphonateIDFPisopropyl dodecylfluorophosphonateBOGn-octyl-β-d-glucopyranosidePIphosphoinositidePI(3)Pphosphoinositide 3-phosphatePI(4)Pphosphoinositide 4-phosphatePI(5)Pphosphoinositide 5-phosphatePI(3,4)P2phosphoinositide 3,4-bisphosphatePI(3,5)P2phosphoinositide 3,5-bisphosphatePI(4,5)P2phosphoinositide 4,5-bisphosphatePI(3,4,5)P3phosphoinositide 3,4,5-trisphosphate. entry 5FQU), and an alignment shows an overall fold in residues 60–343 (32% identity corresponding to PlpD residues 22–311), which align well, with a highly conserved active site containing a catalytic dyad (Ser-98 and Asp-243) and an oxyanion hole (Gly-69/70/71) (Fig. 2). In addition, the next closest structural homologs of the FplA catalytic domain (residues 60–343) are predicted to be the non-autotransporter phospholipase A enzymes ExoU (Type III secreted) from P. aeruginosa (19.0% identity to residues 102–472; PDB entries 4AKX and 3TU3) and VipD (Type IV secreted) from Legionella pneumophila (17.3% identity to residues 33–411, PDB entry 4AKF) (Fig. 3).Figure 2A predicted FplA structure is homologous to PlpD.

Multiple FplA constructs were cloned from the F. nucleatum 25586 genome and expressed in E. coli, including variations that lack a signal sequence for cytoplasmic expression (residues 20–431, 20–350, 60–431, and 60–350), and a full-length version in which we replaced the native signal sequence with an E. coli OmpA signal for more robust expression and surface presentation (OmpA(1–27)-FplA(20–760)). Constructs were tested for their phospholipase activity using substrates specific for either A1 or A2 class enzymes, as the homolog PlpD from P. aeruginosa showed specific A1 activity. We showed that FplA has only PLA1 activity (Fig. 4A) using the PLA1-specific substrate PED-A1 and further demonstrated that the general lipase substrates 4-methylumbelliferyl butyrate (4-MuB) and 4-methylumbelliferyl heptanoate (4-MuH) are robust tools for studies of FplA (Fig. 4, B–E). In addition, we determined that this enzyme is not dependent on calcium for activity (supplemental Fig. S1A) and that it is most active at pH 8.5 (supplemental Fig. S1B). The first full Michaelis–Menten kinetics for a Type Vd autotransporter were performed on each FplA construct using 4-MuH as a substrate and indicated that amino acids 20–350, incorporating the N-terminal extension and catalytic PLA1 domain, show the most robust catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km = 3.2 × 106 s−1 m−1) (Fig. 4E and supplemental Fig. S1 (C and D)). Upon removal of the N-terminal extension, constructs had lower substrate turnover rates (kcat), but the relative binding affinities (Km) for 4-MuH were unchanged. We also show that tighter binding was seen with the substrate that most closely mimics a phospholipid (PED-A1, Km = 1.90 μm), and of the single acyl chain substrates, 4-MuH (7-carbon acyl chain) resulted in significantly tighter binding (Km = 19 μm) than with the 4-carbon acyl chain substrate 4-MuB (Km = 500 μm) (Fig. 4C). Mutation of the active site serine (S98A) and aspartate (D243A) residues that make up the catalytic dyad resulted in no detectable enzymatic activity (Fig. 4E). In addition, the glycine-rich stretch that constitutes the oxyanion hole (Gly-69/70/71) was analyzed, but Gly → Ala single mutations or multiple glycine changes (G69A/G70A/G71A) rendered the proteins insoluble 3M.

We present the first characterization of inhibitors for Type Vd autotransporter phospholipases. We show that the classic calcium-dependent PLA2 inhibitor methylarachidonyl fluorophosphonate (MAFP) is the most potent for FplA with an IC50 of 11 nm (41Lio Y.C. Reynolds L.J. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. Irreversible inhibition of Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2 by methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Additional potent inhibitors contained a trifluoromethyl ketone headgroup (arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone; ATFMK), which also covalently binds to active-site serines within enzymes or an enylfluorophosphonate group (Fig. 5, A–C). We observed that isopropyl dodec-11-enylfluorophosphonate (IDEFP) is a much more potent inhibitor than isopropyl dodecylfluorophosphonate (IDFP); these compounds differ by only a double bond at the end of the IDEFP acyl chain. In addition, MAFP is the most potent inhibitor, and the arachidonyl portion of the molecule contains four double bonds, making it and ATFMK the most unsaturated substrates of the inhibitors tested. We therefore hypothesize that FplA binds and docks unsaturated acyl chain substrates and inhibitors with much higher affinity than saturated acyl chains, potentially because of angular changes within the molecule at double bonds. Additional inhibitors were tested that showed no significant activity against FplA (IC50 > 100 μm), and their analys"

The endosome is increasingly recognized as an important crossroad for APP and these secretases, with major implications for APP processing and amyloidogenesis. Among various post-translational modifications affecting APP accumulation, ubiquitination of cytodomain lysines may represent a key signal controlling APP endosomal sorting. Here, we show that substitution of APP C-terminal lysines with arginine disrupts APP ubiquitination and that an increase in the number of substituted lysines tends to increase APP metabolism. An APP mutant lacking all C-terminal lysines underwent the most pronounced increase in processing, leading to accumulation of both secreted and intracellular Aβ40. Artificial APP ubiquitination with rapalog-mediated proximity inducers reduced Aβ40 generation. A lack of APP C-terminal lysines caused APP redistribution from endosomal intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) to the endosomal limiting membrane, with a subsequent decrease in APP C-terminal fragment (CTF) content in secreted exosomes, but had minimal effects on APP lysosomal degradation. Both the increases in secreted and intracellular Aβ40 were abolished by depletion of presenilin 2 (PSEN2), recently shown to be enriched on the endosomal limiting membrane compared with PSEN1. Our findings demonstrate that ubiquitin can act as a signal at five cytodomain-located lysines for endosomal sorting of APP. They further suggest that disruption of APP endosomal sorting reduces its sequestration in ILVs and results in PSEN2-mediated processing of a larger pool of APP-CTF on the endosomal membrane.

Hardy J. The amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease at 25 years.EMBO Mol. Med. 2016; 8: 595-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (3204) Google Scholar). The main component of amyloid plaques is aggregated amyloid β (Aβ), a 4-kDa peptide formed by sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β- and γ-secretases (1Selkoe D.J. Hardy J. The amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease at 25 years.EMBO Mol. Med. 2016; 8: 595-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (3204) Google Scholar). Like many other type 1 transmembrane proteins, APP is initially transported to the plasma membrane via biosynthetic and secretory pathways, where it is processed primarily by α-secretase in the non-amyloidogenic pathway (1Selkoe D.J.

Alternatively, APP is rapidly endocytosed in a clathrin-dependent manner and delivered to endosomes, where amyloidogenic processing by β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) largely occurs, releasing the soluble ectodomain of APP (sAPPβ) luminally and the membrane-bound C-terminal fragment β (CTFβ) (2Rajendran L.

After BACE1 processing, the CTFβ fragment is cleaved within the transmembrane domain by γ-secretase, releasing Aβ and APP intracellular domain (AICD). γ-Secretase cleaves C99 in a sequential fashion, releasing multiple Aβ peptides of different lengths (14Wolfe M.S. Processive proteolysis by γ-secretase and the mechanism of Alzheimer's disease.Biol. Chem. 2012; 393: 899-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Of these, the most abundant is Aβ40, although longer peptides, such as Aβ42, are more prone to aggregation and generally more synapto- and neurotoxic (1Selkoe D.J. Hardy J. The amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease at 25 years.EMBO Mol. Med. 2016; 8: 595-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (3204) Google Scholar). In familial AD (FAD), overall levels of Aβ increase, or there is a shift in Aβ production that increases the ratio of Aβ42/40. However, in the majority of AD cases, which occur sporadically as late-onset AD (LOAD), mechanisms of Aβ accumulation remain poorly understood, although they likely also involve reduced Aβ clearance (15Musiek E.S.

The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) is a series of protein complexes (ESCRT-0 to ESCRT-III) that form ILVs by invagination of the MVE limiting membrane, sequestering specific protein cargo inside. Several studies implicate APP as a protein cargo that can be recognized and sorted by ESCRT (7Morel E. Chamoun Z. Lasiecka Z.M. Chan R.B. Williamson R.L. Vetanovetz C. Dall'Armi C. Simoes S.

In ILVs, cargo can undergo several fates, including lysosomal degradation and extracellular secretion as exosomes. Underscoring the pathophysiological significance of ILV sorting for APP, silencing of CD2-associated protein (CD2AP), an endosomal regulator associated with increased risk for LOAD, has recently been shown to lead to an increase in intracellular Aβ42 in neuronal dendrites by interfering with sorting of APP from the endosomal limiting membrane to the ILVs and thereby preventing APP degradation in lysosomes (34Ubelmann F.

In a screen of interactors for the APP cytodomain, Del Prete et al. (37Del Prete D. Rice R.C. Rajadhyaksha A.M. D'Adamio L.

Thus, it appears that all five C-terminal lysines may be ubiquitinated physiologically. We have previously identified a string of lysine residues in the juxtamembrane region of APP, mutation of which led to a redistribution of APP from ILVs to the limiting membrane and a subsequent alteration of APP processing (7Morel E. Chamoun Z. Lasiecka Z.M. Chan R.B. Williamson R.L. Vetanovetz C. Dall'Armi C. Simoes S. Point Du Jour K.S. McCabe B.D. Small S.A. Di Paolo G. PI3P regulates sorting and processing of amyloid precursor protein through the endosomal system.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, the terminal two APP lysines in the cytodomain were still capable of ubiquitination in that analysis; thus, it did not fully represent a model of lack of APP ubiquitination. Here, we show that loss of APP ubiquitination achieved by systematic substitution of all the cytodomain lysines residues has a profound impact on APP endosomal trafficking and metabolism. Specifically, we found that decreased ubiquitination causes defects in APP sorting into ILVs and exosomal release of APP-CTFs as well as an increase in Aβ production by PSEN2-containing γ-secretase complex, which is localized to the endosomal limiting membrane (43Sannerud R.

Our data thus underscore the importance of ubiquitination as a signal for endosomal sorting of APP and contribute to growing recognition of γ-secretase composition as a significant factor in differential APP processing. To assess whether the five lysines present in the APP C-terminal domain (Fig. 1A) are sites of ubiquitination, we generated a panel of GFP-tagged APP mutants with each lysine mutated to arginine individually and in several combinations. We have previously shown that mutation of three consecutive lysines in the juxtamembrane region, Lys-724– Lys-726, to arginine (termed APP3R) leads to a deficiency of ubiquitination of exogenously expressed APP by endogenous ubiquitin in HeLa cells (7Morel E.

The milk production and body weight gain was monitored. The immunoglobulin concentrations in the serum of gilts and piglets were measured using ELISA. Our study showed that maternal LF supplementation to the gilt (1) significantly increased milk production at different time points (day 1, 3, 7 and 19) of lactation compared to the control (p<0.001); (2) significantly increased body weight gain of their piglets during the first 19 days of life compared to the control group (p<0.05); (3) tended to increase pregnancy rate, litter size and birth weight, number of piglets born alive, and decrease the number of dead and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) piglets; (4) significantly increased the concentration of serum IgA in gilt and serum sIgA in piglet (p<0.05). In summary, maternal Lf intervention in gilts can improve milk production, pig production and serum IgA and sIgA levels, and therefore plays a key role in shaping the performance of their progeny."
https://openalex.org/W2763406506,"Anxiety disorders are the most common mental disorder worldwide. Although anxiety disorders differ in the nature of feared objects or situations, they share a common mechanism by which fear generalizes to related but innocuous objects, eliciting avoidance of objects and situations that pose no objective risk. This overgeneralization appears to be a crucial mechanism in the persistence of anxiety psychopathology. In this study we test whether an intervention that promotes discrimination learning reduces generalization of fear, in particular, harm expectancy and avoidance compared to an irrelevant (control) training. Healthy participants (N = 80) were randomly allocated to a training condition. Using a fear conditioning paradigm, participants first learned visual danger and safety signals (set 1). Baseline level of stimulus generalization was tested with ambiguous stimuli on a spectrum between the danger and safety signals. There were no differences between the training groups. Participants then received the stimulus discrimination training or a control training. After training, participants learned a new set of danger and safety signals (set 2), and the level of harm expectancy generalization and behavioural avoidance of ambiguous stimuli was tested. Although the training groups did not differ in fear generalization on a cognitive level (harm expectancy), the results showed a different pattern of avoidance of ambiguous stimuli, with the discrimination training group showing less avoidance of stimuli that resembled the safety signals. These results support the potential of interventions that promote discrimination learning in the treatment of anxiety disorders."

This population, which is often associated with loss of personal independence due to physical or cognitive decline associated with aging, is also often under-represented in neuroscience research because of a limited means to participate in studies which often take place in large urban or university centers. In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility and initial results using a portable 8-source by 4-detector fNIRS system to measure brain activity from participants within residential care community centers. Using fNIRS, brain signals were recorded during a series of computerized cognitive tests, including a Symbol Digit Coding test (SDC), Stroop Test (ST), and Shifting Attention Test (SAT). The SDC and SAT elicited greater activity in the left middle frontal region of interest. Three components of the ST produced increases in the right middle frontal and superior frontal, and left superior frontal regions. An association between advanced age and increased activation in the right middle frontal region was observed during the incongruent ST. Although none of the participants had clinical dementia based on the short portable mental status questionnaire, the group performance was slightly below age-normed values on these cognitive tests. These results demonstrate the capability for obtaining functional neuroimaging measures in residential settings, which ultimately may aid in prognosis and care related to dementia in older adults."

https://openalex.org/W2762089201,"Iron deficiency anemia in celiac disease is related to impaired duodenal mucosal uptake, due to villous atrophy. Iron enters the enterocytes through an apical divalent metal transporter, DMT1. Different DMT1 transcripts have been identified, depending on the presence of an iron-responsive element that allows DMT1 up-regulation during iron starvation. An intronic DMT1 polymorphism, IVS4+44C>A, has been associated with metal toxicity, and the CC-carriers show high iron levels.This study investigates the association between DMT1 IVS4+44C>A and anemia in a cohort of 387 Italian celiac children, and the functional role of the polymorphism.By association analysis, we found that DMT1 IVS4+44-AA genotype confers a four-fold risk of developing anemia, despite of atrophy degree. By analysis of mRNA from gastroesophageal biopsies, we found that total DMT1 is significantly upregulated in presence of mild, but not severe, atrophy, independently from IVS4+44C>A variant, and in normal but not in atrophic CC-biopsies. Moreover, we found that A-allele is associated to preferential expression of the DMT1 transcripts lacking the iron-responsive element, thus limiting the DMT1 overexpression that normally occurs to respond to iron starvation.Possibly, the IVS4+44-AA-related dysregulation of the iron-induced changes in DMT1 expression is not able to impair iron absorption in physiological condition. However, if exacerbated by the concomitant massive loss of functional absorbing tissue paralleling worsened stages of villus atrophy, it might be ineffective in counteracting iron deficiency, despite of DMT1 overexpression.We suggest, for the first time, that celiac disease may unmask the contribution of the DMT1 IVS4+44C>A polymorphism to the risk of anemia."
https://openalex.org/W2762633367,"In recent years, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been developed as powerful therapeutic and diagnostic agents and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells have emerged as the dominant host for the recombinant expression of these proteins. A critical step in recombinant expression is the utilization of strong promoters, such as the Chinese Hamster Elongation Factor-1α (CHEF-1) promoter. To compare the strengths of CHEF with cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter for mAb expression in CHO cells, four bicistronic vectors bearing either internal ribosome entry site (IRES) or Furin/2A (F2A) sequences were designed. The efficiency of these promoters was evaluated by measuring level of expressed antibody in stable cell pools. Our results indicated that CHEF promoter-based expression of mAbs was 2.5 fold higher than CMV-based expression in F2A-mediated vectors. However, this difference was less significant in IRES-mediated mAb expressing cells. Studying the stability of the F2A expression system in the course of 18 weeks, we observed that the cells having CHEF promoter maintained their antibody expression at higher level than those transfected with CMV promoter. Further analyses showed that both IRES-mediated vectors, expressed mAbs with correct size, whereas in antibodies expressed via F2A system heterogeneity of light chains were detected due to incomplete furin cleavage. Our findings indicated that the CHEF promoter is a viable alternative to CMV promoter-based expression in F2A-mediated vectors by providing both higher expression and level of stability."

To reduce possible xenobiotic contamination from 3T3s, primary human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) were examined as feeder cells to support the expansion of LSCs in vitro. To optimize the ASC-supported culture, freshly isolated limbal epithelial cells in the form of single cells (SC-ASC) or cell clusters (CC-ASC) were cultured using three different methods: LSCs seeded directly on feeder cells, a 3-dimensional (3D) culture system and a 3D culture system with fibrin (fibrin 3D). The expanded LSCs were examined at the end of a 2-week culture. The standard 3T3 culture served as control. Expansion of SC-ASC showed limited proliferation and exhibited differentiated morphology. CC-ASC generated epithelial cells with undifferentiated morphology in all culture methods, among which CC-ASC in 3D culture supported the highest cell doubling (cells doubled 9.0 times compared to cells doubled 4.9 times in control) while maintained the percentage of putative limbal stem/progenitor cells compared to the control. There were few cell-cell contacts between cultured LSCs and ASCs in 3D CC-ASC. In conclusion, ASCs support the growth of LSCs in the form of cell clusters but not in single cells. 3D CC-ASC could serve as a substitute for the standard 3T3 culture to expand LSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2761505882,"Here we examined neural substrates for physically and observationally learning to construct novel objects, and characterized brain regions associated with each kind of learning using fMRI. Each participant was assigned a training partner, and for five consecutive days practiced tying one group of knots (“tied” condition) or watched their partner tie different knots (“watched” condition) while a third set of knots remained untrained. Functional MRI was obtained prior to and immediately following the week of training while participants performed a visual knot-matching task. After training, a portion of left superior parietal lobule demonstrated a training by scan session interaction. This means this parietal region responded selectively to knots that participants had physically learned to tie in the post-training scan session but not the pre-training scan session. A conjunction analysis on the post-training scan data showed right intraparietal sulcus and right dorsal premotor cortex to respond when viewing images of knots from the tied and watched conditions compared to knots that were untrained during the post-training scan session. This suggests that these brain areas track both physical and observational learning. Together, the data provide preliminary evidence of engagement of brain regions associated with hand-object interactions when viewing objects associated with physical experience, and with observational experience without concurrent physical practice."

In addition to many previously uncharacterized pathways responding with elevated transcript levels to polymyxin B exposure, we confirmed the predicted elevated transcript levels of a previously described LPS modification system in response to polymyxin B exposure. Additionally, we identified the V. cholerae homologue of visP (ygiW) as a regulatory target of VC1639. VisP is a conserved periplasmic protein implicated in lipid A modification in Salmonellae. This study provides the first systematic analysis of the transcriptional response of Vibrio cholerae to polymyxin B, raising important questions for further study regarding mechanisms used by V. cholerae to sense and respond to envelope stress."

https://openalex.org/W2763433368,"A long-standing interest in marine science is in the degree to which environmental conditions of flow and irradiance, combined with optical, thermal and morphological characteristics of individual coral colonies, affects their sensitivity of thermal microenvironments and susceptibility to stress-induced bleaching within and/or among colonies. The physiological processes in Scleractinian corals tend to scale allometrically as a result of physical and geometric constraints on body size and shape. There is a direct relationship between scaling to thermal stress, thus, the relationship between allometric scaling and rates of heating and cooling in coral microenvironments is a subject of great interest. The primary aim of this study was to develop an approximation that predicts coral thermal microenvironments as a function of colony morphology (shape and size), light or irradiance, and flow velocity or regime. To do so, we provided intuitive interpretation of their energy budgets for both massive and branching colonies, and then quantified the heat-size exponent (b*) and allometric constant (m) using logarithmic linear regression. The data demonstrated a positive relationship between thermal rates and changes in irradiance, A/V ratio, and flow, with an interaction where turbulent regime had less influence on overall stress which may serve to ameliorate the effects of temperature rise compared to the laminar regime. These findings indicated that smaller corals have disproportionately higher stress, however they can reach thermal equilibrium quicker. Moreover, excellent agreements between the predicted and simulated microscale temperature values with no significant bias were observed for both the massive and branching colonies, indicating that the numerical approximation should be within the accuracy with which they could be measured. This study may assist in estimating the coral microscale temperature under known conditions of water flow and irradiance, in particular when examining the intra- and inter-colony variability found during periods of bleaching conditions."

Macular optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurements (RS 3000, Nidek Co.ltd., Aichi, Japan) were also carried out in all eyes. Thickness measurements were recorded in the outer segment and retinal pigment epithelium (OS+RPE), the nerve fiber layer (NFL), the ganglion cell layer and inner plexiform layer (GCL+IPL), the inner nuclear layer and outer plexiform layer (INL+OPL) and the outer nuclear layer and inner segment (ONL+IS). The relationship between mTH and the thickness of these five different layers was investigated. Additionally, the influence of OS+RPE on mTH was investigated using partial correlation eliminating the effect of other variables of NFL, GCL+IPL, INL+OPL, ONL+IS, age, gender and axial length.The thickness of the OS+RPE layer was significantly decreased with the decrease of mTH (coefficient = 0.63 p <0.001). Partial correlation analysis suggested OS+RPE thickness is significantly (coefficient = 0.31, p <0.001) related to mTH, independent from NFL, GCL+IPL, INL+OPL, ONL+IS, age, gender and axial length.The thickness of the RPE+OS layer appears to be related to visual sensitivity in glaucoma."
https://openalex.org/W2763370253,"Background Cancer is associated with hypercoagulability. However, several data suggest that anticoagulant drugs may have an effect on tumor development and progression mediated by both coagulation dependent processes and non-coagulation dependent processes. Therefore, we investigated the in vitro effects of Apixaban on cell proliferation, mortality, cell migration, gene expression and matrix metalloproteinase in 5 different cancer cell lines. Methods The following cancer cell lines, and 2 normal fibroblast cultures (lung and dermal fibroblasts), were studied: OVCAR3 (ovarian cancer), MDA MB 231 (breast cancer), CaCO-2 (colon cancer), LNCaP (prostate cancer) and U937 (histiocytic lymphoma). Proliferation and cell mortality were assessed in control cells and Apixaban treated cultures (dose from 0.1 to 5 μg/ml, 0 to 96-h). Necrosis/Apoptosis (fluorescence microscopy), cell migration (24-h after scratch test), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity and mRNA expression (RT PCR) of p16, p21, p53 and HAS were also assessed. Results High-dose (5 μg/ml) Apixaban incubation was associated with a significantly reduced proliferation in 3 cancer cell lines (OVCAR3, CaCO-2 and LNCaP) and with increased cancer cell mortality in all, except LNCaP, cancer lines. Apoptosis seems to account for the increased mortality. The migration capacity seems to be impaired after high-dose Apixaban incubation in OVCAR3 and CaCO-2 cells. Data on mRNA expression suggest a consistent increase in tumor suppression gene p16 in all cell lines. Conclusions Our data suggest that high-dose Apixaban may be able to interfere with cancer cell in vitro, reducing proliferation and increasing cancer cell mortality through apoptosis in several cancer cell lines."

https://openalex.org/W2763261395,"Isaria cateniannulata is a very important and virulent entomopathogenic fungus that infects many insect pest species. Although I. cateniannulata is commonly exposed to extreme environmental temperature conditions, little is known about its molecular response mechanism to temperature stress. Here, we sequenced and de novo assembled the transcriptome of I. cateniannulata in response to high and low temperature stresses using Illumina RNA-Seq technology. Our assembly encompassed 17,514 unigenes (mean length = 1,197 bp), in which 11,445 unigenes (65.34%) showed significant similarities to known sequences in NCBI non-redundant protein sequences (Nr) database. Using digital gene expression analysis, 4,483 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified after heat treatment, including 2,905 up-regulated genes and 1,578 down-regulated genes. Under cold stress, 1,927 DEGs were identified, including 1,245 up-regulated genes and 682 down-regulated genes. The expression patterns of 18 randomly selected candidate DEGs resulting from quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) were consistent with their transcriptome analysis results. Although DEGs were involved in many pathways, we focused on the genes that were involved in endocytosis: In heat stress, the pathway of clathrin-dependent endocytosis (CDE) was active; however at low temperature stresses, the pathway of clathrin-independent endocytosis (CIE) was active. Besides, four categories of DEGs acting as temperature sensors were observed, including cell-wall-major-components-metabolism-related (CWMCMR) genes, heat shock protein (Hsp) genes, intracellular-compatible-solutes-metabolism-related (ICSMR) genes and glutathione S-transferase (GST). These results enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of I. cateniannulata in response to temperature stresses and provide a valuable resource for the future investigations."
https://openalex.org/W2520740233,"Nacre is a widely used mineral medicine that has been reported to have beneficial effects in bone remodeling without an increase in inflammation. Water-soluble nacre matrix has been demonstrated to be responsible for the effect, yet core active ingredients are unknown. Pinctada fucata mantle gene 1 (PFMG1) was first discovered in the mantle tissue of Pinctada fucata. The protein has 2 EF-hands, a calcium-binding domain. PFMG1 protein can affect the growth of calcium carbonate crystals in vitro. Here, we demonstrate that PFMG1 affects cell-cycle distribution and promotes preosteoblast proliferation. PFMG1 accelerates preosteoblast differentiation and extracellular matrix mineralization. During the differentiation process, PFMG1 increases the expression level of osteoblastic marker genes and activates the Erk signaling pathway. PFMG1 also accelerates calcium crystal aggregation in culture medium and suppresses osteoclast formation. Moreover, PFMG1 prevents bone loss caused by ovariectomy. RNA sequencing analysis demonstrated that PFMG1 stimulates genes that are associated with tissue development and ossification, which indicated new genes that function in bone remodeling. Our findings demonstrate the therapeutic potential of PFMG1 from nacre as a novel medicine for osteoporosis.—Li, L., Wang, P., Hu, K., Wang, X., Cai, W., Ai, C., Liu, S., Wang, Z.

https://openalex.org/W2761615648,"Background p16 immunohistochemistry is used to evaluate for HPV-associated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. The diagnostic performance of p16 in HIV infection is unclear. Methods Between June-December 2009, HIV-infected women underwent Papanicolaou (Pap) smear, human papillomavirus (HPV) testing, visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), and colposcopy-directed biopsy as the disease gold standard at a HIV clinic in Kenya. Pap smears were evaluated for p16 expression. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of p16 to detect CIN2/3 on histology and the impact of immunosuppression and ART was assessed. Results Of 331 cervical samples with p16 expression, p16 sensitivity and specificity to detect CIN2/3 was 54.1% and 72.4% respectively, which was lower than Pap and HPV in sensitivity, but higher in specificity than Pap, HPV, and VIA. Combining tests and p16 reduced sensitivity and increased specificity of Pap from 90.5% to 48.7% and 51.4% to 81.7%; of VIA from 59.5% to 37.8% and 67.6% to 89.9%; and of HPV from 82.4% to 50.0% and 55.3% to 84.8%. Combination p16 increased the PPV of Pap from 34.9% to 43.4%; of HPV from 34.7% to 48.7%; and VIA from 34.9% to 51.9%. Adjunctive p16 did not change AUC (P>0.05). P16 performance was not altered by immunosuppression or ART use. Combining p16 with HPV and VIA reduced the variation in HPV and VIA performance associated with CD4 and ART. Conclusion As an adjunctive test in HIV-infected women, p16 immunohistochemistry increased specificity and PPV of HPV and VIA for CIN2/3, and was not altered in performance by immunosuppression, ART, or age."
https://openalex.org/W2764143104,"M18 aspartyl aminopeptidases (DAPs) are well characterized in microbes and animals with likely functions in peptide processing and vesicle trafficking. In contrast, there is a dearth of knowledge on plant aminopeptidases with a preference for proteins and peptides with N-terminal acidic residues. During evolution of the Plantae, there was an expansion and diversification of the M18 DAPs. After divergence of the ancestral green algae from red and glaucophyte algae, a duplication yielded the DAP1 and DAP2 lineages. Subsequently DAP1 genes were lost in chlorophyte algae. A duplication of DAP2-related genes occurred early in green plant evolution. DAP2 genes were retained in land plants and picoeukaryotic algae and lost in green algae. In contrast, DAP2-like genes persisted in picoeukaryotic and green algae, while this lineage was lost in land plants. Consistent with this evolutionary path, Arabidopsis thaliana has two DAP gene lineages (AtDAP1 and AtDAP2). Similar to animal and yeast DAPs, AtDAP1 is localized to the cytosol or vacuole; while AtDAP2 harbors an N-terminal transit peptide and is chloroplast localized. His6-DAP1 and His6-DAP2 expressed in Escherichia coli were enzymatically active and dodecameric with masses exceeding 600 kDa. His6-DAP1 and His6-DAP2 preferentially hydrolyzed Asp-p-nitroanilide and Glu-p-nitroanilide. AtDAPs are highly conserved metallopeptidases activated by MnCl2 and inhibited by ZnCl2 and divalent ion chelators. The protease inhibitor PMSF inhibited and DTT stimulated both His6-DAP1 and His6-DAP2 activities suggesting a role for thiols in the AtDAP catalytic mechanism. The enzymes had distinct pH and temperature optima, as well as distinct kinetic parameters. Both enzymes had high catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) exceeding 1.0 x 107 M-1 sec-1. Using established molecular chaperone assays, AtDAP1 and AtDAP2 prevented thermal denaturation. AtDAP1 also prevented protein aggregation and promoted protein refolding. Collectively, these data indicate that plant DAPs have a complex evolutionary history and have evolved new biochemical features that may enable their role in vivo."
