We investigated the combinatorial expression and function of Dlx1&2, Olig2, and Mash1 transcription factors in the ventral telencephalon. We show that Dlx homeobox transcription factors, required for GABAergic interneuron production, repress oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) formation by acting on a common progenitor to determine neuronal versus oligodendroglial cell fate acquisition. We demonstrate that Dlx1&2 negatively regulate Olig2-dependant OPC formation and that Mash1 promotes OPC formation by restricting the number of Dlx+ progenitors. Progenitors transplanted from Dlx1&2 mutant ventral telencephalon into newborn wild-type mice do not produce neurons but differentiate into myelinating oligodendrocytes that survive into adulthood. Our results identify another role for Dlx genes as modulators of neuron versus oligodendrocyte development in the ventral embryonic forebrain.

Our results identify another role for Dlx genes as modulators of neuron versus oligodendrocyte development in the ventral embryonic forebrain. Neural development requires mechanisms for segregating appropriately sized progenitor pools for specialized neuronal and glial subtypes. For example, ventral telencephalic progenitor cells that reside in spatially restricted germinal zones within the lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE), medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), and anterior entopeduncular area (AEP) give rise to GABAergic and cholinergic neurons and oligodendrocytes (Le Bras et al., 2005Le Bras B.

Thus, the ventral telencephalon provides a suitable model system to address whether a common progenitor gives rise to neurons and glia, and what factors might regulate neuron-glial fate decisions. The majority of telencephalic GABAergic interneurons arise from the ganglionic eminences and AEP, and migrate as postmitotic cells to the basal ganglia and cortex (for review, see Marin et al., 2000Marin O.

Anderson S.A. The origin and specification of cortical interneurons.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Transcription factors Nkx2.1 and Gsh2, as well the signaling molecules Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), establish the regional identity of the ganglionic eminences and AEP (Wonders and Anderson, 2006Wonders C.P. Anderson S.A. The origin and specification of cortical interneurons.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). The Dlx family of homeobox transcription factors (Dlx1, Dlx2, Dlx5, and Dlx6) is necessary in order for progenitors within these regions to differentiate into GABAergic neurons (Panganiban and Rubenstein, 2002Panganiban G. Rubenstein J.L. Developmental functions of the Distal-less/Dlx homeobox genes.Development. 2002; 129: 4371-4386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dlx1 and Dlx2 are functionally redundant, since Dlx1−/− and Dlx2−/− mice show only minor deficiencies in GABAergic neuron formation (Anderson et al., 1997bAnderson S.A. Qiu M. Bulfone A. Eisenstat D.D. Meneses J. Pedersen R. Rubenstein J.L.

Oligodendrogenesis within the mouse telencephalon commences in the MGE and AEP around embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5), when multipotent progenitors give rise to precursors that are restricted to the oligodendroglial lineage: oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) (Kessaris et al., 2006Kessaris N.

OPCs are mitotically active cells that have migrated out of the ventricular zone (VZ) and are characterized by a combination of Sox10 and Pdgfra expression. OPCs migrate into the cerebral cortex around E15 and differentiate into myelinating oligodendrocytes postnatally (Kessaris et al., 2006Kessaris N. Fogarty M. Iannarelli P. Grist M. Wegner M. Richardson W.D. Competing waves of oligodendrocytes in the forebrain and postnatal elimination of an embryonic lineage.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). A secondary wave of OPC formation occurs in the LGE around E16, and after birth, cortical progenitors contribute OPCs for ongoing turnover and repair (Kessaris et al., 2006Kessaris N. Fogarty M. Iannarelli P. Grist M. Wegner M. Richardson W.D. Competing waves of oligodendrocytes in the forebrain and postnatal elimination of an embryonic lineage.Nat.

Origin of oligodendrocytes in the subventricular zone of the adult brain.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7907-7918Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Whereas Pdgfra and Sox10 expression in the embryonic forebrain are specific to the oligodendrocyte lineage, Olig1 and Olig2 are also expressed in multipotent progenitors (Rowitch, 2004Rowitch D.H. Glial specification in the vertebrate neural tube.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). As oligodendrocytes continue to differentiate, they express NKX2.2, O4, O1, and CNPase, and eventually, mature oligodendrocytes produce proteolipid protein (PLP) and myelin basic protein (MBP) (Rowitch, 2004Rowitch D.H.

Molecular targets of early Shh signaling include the bHLH proteins Olig1 and Olig2 (Lu et al., 2000Lu Q.R. Yuk D. Alberta J.A. Zhu Z. Pawlitzky I. Chan J. McMahon A.P. Stiles C.D. Rowitch D.H.

In the embryonic ventral spinal cord, motor neurons and oligodendrocytes derive from a common progenitor pool, suggesting that these lineages share intrinsic and extrinsic regulatory mechanisms (Lu et al., 2002Lu Q.R.

Similarly, in the dorsal spinal cord, Mash1+ progenitors become dorsal horn neurons and late-born oligodendrocytes (Battiste et al., 2007Battiste J. Helms A.W. Kim E.J. Savage T.K. Lagace D.C.

Control of the neuron-glial switch in the ventral spinal cord involves downregulation of the proneural protein NGN2 (Zhou et al., 2001Zhou Q. Choi G. Anderson D.J.

Lommes P. Sock E. Chaboissier M.C. Schedl A. Wegner M.

Glial specification in the vertebrate neural tube.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Regulation of the neuron-glial switch in the forebrain is less well understood. Clonal analysis has shown that OPCs and GABAergic neurons likely derive from a common progenitor (He et al., 2001He W. Ingraham C. Rising L. Goderie S. Temple S. Multipotent stem cells from the mouse basal forebrain contribute GABAergic neurons and oligodendrocytes to the cerebral cortex during embryogenesis.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8854-8862PubMed Google Scholar, Yung et al., 2002Yung S.Y. Gokhan S. Jurcsak J. Molero A.E. Abrajano J.J. Mehler M.F. Differential modulation of BMP signaling promotes the elaboration of cerebral cortical GABAergic neurons or oligodendrocytes from a common sonic hedgehog-responsive ventral forebrain progenitor species.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 16273-16278Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Analysis of Dlx2/tauLacZ mice suggests that some OPCs derive from Dlx2+ precursors (Marshall and Goldman, 2002Marshall C.A. Goldman J.E. Subpallial dlx2-expressing cells give rise to astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in the cerebral cortex and white matter.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9821-9830PubMed Google Scholar); however, the role of Dlx genes in oligodendrocyte development is unknown. Mash1 has been implicated in regulating neurogenesis and oligodendrogenesis in the telencephalon (Parras et al., 2007Parras C.M. Hunt C. Sugimori M. Nakafuku M. Rowitch D. Guillemot F. The proneural gene Mash1 specifies an early population of telencephalic oligodendrocytes.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 4233-4242Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and functioning of this gene is necessary for development of neurons and perinatal oligodendrocytes in the olfactory bulb (Casarosa et al., 1999Casarosa S. Fode C. Guillemot F. Mash1 regulates neurogenesis in the ventral telencephalon.Development. 1999; 126: 525-534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Horton et al., 1999Horton S. Meredith A. Richardson J.A.

Guillemot F. Mash1 specifies neurons and oligodendrocytes in the postnatal brain.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4495-4505Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). There is evidence for cross-regulation between Mash1 and the Dlx genes: Mash1 binds to regulatory DNA elements in the intergenic region of Dlx1 and Dlx2 (Parras et al., 2007Parras C.M. Hunt C. Sugimori M. Nakafuku M. Rowitch D. Guillemot F. The proneural gene Mash1 specifies an early population of telencephalic oligodendrocytes.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 4233-4242Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), Dlx1 and Dlx2 expression is expanded in the VZ and subventricular zone (SVZ) in Mash1 mutants (Casarosa et al., 1999Casarosa S.

Modulation of the notch signaling by Mash1 and Dlx1/2 regulates sequential specification and differentiation of progenitor cell types in the subcortical telencephalon.Development. 2002; 129: 5029-5040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Mash1 expression is increased in the VZ and SVZ in Dlx1&2 mutants (Yun et al., 2002Yun K. Fischman S. Johnson J. Hrabe de Angelis M. Weinmaster G. Rubenstein J.L. Modulation of the notch signaling by Mash1 and Dlx1/2 regulates sequential specification and differentiation of progenitor cell types in the subcortical telencephalon.Development. 2002; 129: 5029-5040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we describe the combinatorial expression and function of Dlx1&2, Olig2, and Mash1 in the germinal zones of the MGE and AEP. We show that Dlx1&2 repress OPC formation in the ventral forebrain by negatively regulating Olig2 expression. Furthermore, we show that Mash1 promotes OPC formation by restricting the number of Dlx+ progenitors. We establish that Dlx1&2 can act cell-autonomously to repress OLIG2 expression. Lastly, we show using cell-transplantation experiments that progenitors from Dlx1&2 mutants do not produce neurons, but generate OPCs that are able to migrate and differentiate into myelinating oligodendrocytes that persist in the adult. Thus, our data establish a role for Dlx genes in a hierarchy of transcription factors regulating the balance between neurogenesis and oligodendrogenesis in the forebrain. To determine if neuron versus oligodendrocyte cell fate decisions were being made in identical or nonoverlapping progenitors of the developing telencephalon, we investigated expression of DLX2 and OLIG2 proteins by double immunofluorescence analysis and confocal microscopy. DLX1 and DLX2 are largely coexpressed in the subpallial VZ and SVZ (Eisenstat et al., 1999Eisenstat D.D. Liu J.K. Mione M. Zhong W. Yu G. Anderson S.A. Ghattas I. Puelles L. Rubenstein J.L. DLX-1, DLX-2, and DLX-5 expression define distinct stages of basal forebrain differentiation.J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 414: 217-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Within the LGE and MGE at E12.5, DLX2 is expressed in scattered cells within the VZ, the primary progenitor zone, and in most cells within the SVZ, the secondary progenitor zone, suggesting DLX proteins segregate to differentiating cells (Figure 1A) (Eisenstat et al., 1999Eisenstat D.D. Liu J.K. Mione M. Zhong W. Yu G. Anderson S.A. Ghattas I. Puelles L. Rubenstein J.L. DLX-1, DLX-2, and DLX-5 expression define distinct stages of basal forebrain differentiation.J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 414: 217-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, Yun et al., 2002Yun K. Fischman S. Johnson J. Hrabe de Angelis M. Weinmaster G. Rubenstein J.L. Modulation of the notch signaling by Mash1 and Dlx1/2 regulates sequential specification and differentiation of progenitor cell types in the subcortical telencephalon.Development. 2002; 129: 5029-5040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The SVZ can be subdivided into SVZ1 and SVZ2 based on the density of proliferating cells: the SVZ1 has a higher density of mitotic cells, while the SVZ2 contains relatively more differentiated cells (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). In contrast to DLX2, OLIG2 expression is higher in the MGE than in the LGE. In the MGE, the greatest number of OLIG2+ cells is found in the VZ, where they comprise more than 90% of cells. The proportion of OLIG2+ cells declines to ∼50% in SVZ1 and ∼20% in SVZ2 (Figures 1A′ and 1C). Nearly all cells in the MGE VZ express OLIG2 as early as E10.5, while DLX2 expression is initiated in only a few VZ cells at this time point (Figure S2). By E12.5, DLX2 is expressed in ∼50% of OLIG2+ VZ cells (Figures 1A′ and 1C and Figure S3). In the SVZ, as the number of OLIG2+ cells decreases, an increasing number of cells express DLX2, such that DLX2+/OLIG2− cells make up more than 80% of cells in SVZ2 (Figures 1A′ and 1C). Concurrently, the population of OLIG2+/DLX2+ cells declines to less than 10% in the SVZ2. In the mantle, only rare cells coexpress DLX2 and OLIG2, while the vast majority express either DLX2 or OLIG2. Thus, the reciprocal relationship between OLIG2 and DLX2 expression becomes noticeable as cells born in the MGE migrate through the progenitor zones and begin to differentiate. (The distribution of MASH1 expression within MGE progenitor zones will be described later in this study.) At later embryonic ages (E15.5 and E18.5), the pattern of OLIG2 and DLX2 expression between the VZ, SVZ, and mantle of the MGE is qualitatively similar to that at E12.5 (Figures 2A–2C). However, Dlx2 transcript and protein expression in the VZ/SVZ is reduced at E18.5 compared with E12.5, particularly within the MGE/AEP (Figure S4 and Figure 2C′). VZ cells are mostly OLIG2+/DLX2− in even greater proportions than at earlier embryonic stages, while the SVZ consists of a heterogeneous population comprised of transitional DLX2+/OLIG2+, as well as OLIG2+ and DLX2+, cells. Coexpression of OLIG2 and DLX2 is also evident in other germinal zones, including AEP, LGE, caudal ganglionic eminence (CGE), and septum (Figure 2). Outside of the germinal zones in the E15.5 and E18.5 telencephalon, DLX2 and OLIG2 are expressed in the striatum and cortex, as well as in axon tracts, such as the anterior commissure, corpus callosum, and stria terminalis. However, in these regions, DLX2 and OLIG2 are not coexpressed (Figures 2B and 2C). Segregation of DLX2 and OLIG2 to different cells in the mantle suggested distinct identity of these cells. Indeed, we find that OLIG2+ cells in the telencephalon coexpress PDGFRα, while DLX2+ cells do not (Figures 2D and 2E). This is consistent with previous studies showing that OLIG2+ cells in the mantle are OPCs and DLX+ cells are GABAergic neurons (Anderson et al., 1997bAnderson S.A. Qiu M. Bulfone A. Eisenstat D.D.

Together, these findings indicate that DLX2 and OLIG2 are transiently coexpressed in a subset of cells within subpallial progenitor domains. DLX2 and OLIG2 expression become mutually exclusive as cells mature and migrate into the mantle zones and axon tracts. The finding of transient DLX2 and OLIG2 coexpression raises the possibility of regulatory interactions within common progenitors. DLX1 and DLX2 are functionally redundant in regulating interneuron development (Anderson et al., 1997bAnderson S.A. Qiu M. Bulfone A. Eisenstat D.D. Meneses J. Pedersen R. Rubenstein J.L.

Therefore, to determine whether DLX1, DLX2, or both could play a functional role in regulating Olig2 in the ventral telencephalon, we studied Olig2 expression in Dlx1&2−/− mutants. We first examined Olig2 mRNA expression in coronal sections of Dlx1&2 mutants at E12.5, E15.5, and E18.5. At E12.5 and E15.5, there is an ∼7-fold increase in Olig2+ cells in the SVZ of the AEP and MGE (Figures 3A–3D). The AEP region is where the anterior commissure will cross the midline, and it is a prominent source of telencephalic embryonic OPCs. We also detected a significant increase in the number of Olig2+ cells in the neocortex and the CGE of the Dlx1&2 mutant as compared with wild-type (Figures S5 and S6). At E18.5, increased numbers of Olig2+ cells are present in the Dlx1&2 mutant around the anterior commissure and in the striatum (Figures 3E and 3F). To determine if Olig2 represses Dlx2 expression, we compared Dlx2 expression in Olig2−/− and wild-type E15.5 telencephalic sections. There was no detectable change in Dlx2 expression at this age (Figure S7), which suggests that while Dlx1&2 potently repress Olig2 expression, Olig2 may not regulate Dlx2 expression. Because Olig2 is expressed in progenitors that can give rise to both oligodendrocytes and cortical neurons (Furusho et al., 2006Furusho M. Ono K. Takebayashi H. Masahira N. Kagawa T. Ikeda K.

https://openalex.org/W2135851646,"The principles driving the organization of the ventral object-processing stream remain unknown. Here, we show that stimulus-specific repetition suppression (RS) in one region of the ventral stream is biased according to motor-relevant properties of objects. Quantitative analysis confirmed that this result was not confounded with similarity in visual shape. A similar pattern of biases in RS according to motor-relevant properties of objects was observed in dorsal stream regions in the left hemisphere. These findings suggest that neural specificity for ""tools"" in the ventral stream is driven by similarity metrics computed over motor-relevant information represented in dorsal structures. Support for this view is provided by converging results from functional connectivity analyses of the fMRI data and a separate neuropsychological study. More generally, these data suggest that a basic organizing principle giving rise to ""category specificity"" in the ventral stream may involve similarity metrics computed over information represented elsewhere in the brain."

We report the identification of B cell leukemia (Bcl)-3 as an essential negative regulator of TLR signaling. By blocking ubiquitination of p50, a member of the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB family, Bcl-3 stabilizes a p50 complex that inhibits gene transcription. As a consequence, Bcl-3-deficient mice and cells were found to be hypersensitive to TLR activation and unable to control responses to lipopolysaccharides. Thus, p50 ubiquitination blockade by Bcl-3 limits the strength of TLR responses and maintains innate immune homeostasis. These findings indicate that the p50 ubiquitination pathway can be selectively targeted to control deleterious inflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2038397615,"<h2>Summary</h2> Neurons integrate and encode complex synaptic inputs into action potential outputs through a process termed ""intrinsic excitability."" Here, we report the essential contribution of fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs), a family of voltage-gated sodium channel binding proteins, to this process. <i>Fhf1</i><sup>−/−</sup><i>Fhf4</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice suffer from severe ataxia and other neurological deficits. In mouse cerebellar slice recordings, WT granule neurons can be induced to fire action potentials repetitively (∼60 Hz), whereas <i>Fhf1</i><sup>−/−</sup><i>Fhf4</i><sup>−/−</sup> neurons often fire only once and at an elevated voltage spike threshold. Sodium channels in <i>Fhf1</i><sup>−/−</sup><i>Fhf4</i><sup>−/−</sup> granule neurons inactivate at more negative membrane potential, inactivate more rapidly, and are slower to recover from the inactivated state. Altered sodium channel physiology is sufficient to explain excitation deficits, as tested in a granule cell computer model. These findings offer a physiological mechanism underlying human spinocerebellar ataxia induced by <i>Fhf4</i> mutation and suggest a broad role for FHFs in the control of excitability throughout the CNS."
https://openalex.org/W1991279445,"Previous studies suggest that glia may be required for normal circadian behavior, but glial factors required for rhythmicity have not been identified in any system. We show here that a circadian rhythm in Drosophila Ebony (N-beta-alanyl-biogenic amine synthetase) abundance can be visualized in adult glia and that glial expression of Ebony rescues the altered circadian behavior of ebony mutants. We demonstrate that molecular oscillator function and clock neuron output are normal in ebony mutants, verifying a role for Ebony downstream of the clock. Surprisingly, the ebony oscillation persists in flies lacking PDF neuropeptide, indicating it is regulated by an autonomous glial oscillator or another neuronal factor. The proximity of Ebony-containing glia to aminergic neurons and genetic interaction results suggest a function in dopaminergic signaling. We thus suggest a model for ebony function wherein Ebony glia participate in the clock control of dopaminergic function and the orchestration of circadian activity rhythms."

We describe a previously unknown cell type in the social amoeba, which appears to provide detoxification and immune-like functions and which we term sentinel (S) cells. S cells were observed to engulf bacteria and sequester toxins while circulating within the slug, eventually being sloughed off. A Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain protein, TirA, was also required for some S cell functions and for vegetative amoebae to feed on live bacteria. This apparent innate immune function in social amoebae, and the use of TirA for bacterial feeding, suggest an ancient cellular foraging mechanism that may have been adapted to defense functions well before the diversification of the animals."

A speculative carboxysome structural model is presented. Prokaryotic organisms are distinct from their eukaryotic counterparts by the absence of specialized membrane-bound compartments. Although it is commonly considered that prokaryotic cells do not compartmentalize cellular processes, there is growing evidence that cyanobacteria and some β-proteobacteria have the means to do so when certain enzymes need to be sequestered or protected for maximal catalytic activity (1Kofoid E. Rappleye C. Stojiljkovic I. Roth J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5317-5329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Bobik T.A. Havemann G.D. Busch R.J. Williams D.S. Aldrich H.C. J.

Microbiol. 2003; 46: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Carboxysomes, for example, are polyhedral protein microcompartments found in cyanobacteria and chemoautotrophic bacteria, which contain the majority of a cell's ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) (4Cannon G.C. Bradburne C.E. Aldrich H.C. Baker S.H. Heinhorst S. Shively J.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 5351-5361Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). These microcompartments are essential to the operation of the CO2-concentrating mechanism in cyanobacteria. The CO2-concentrating mechanism utilizes a number of inorganic carbon (Ci, the sum of CO2 and (HCO3−)) transport systems to elevate cellular (HCO3−) concentrations prior to CO2 fixation (for reviews, see Refs. 5Badger M.R. Price G.D. Long B.M. Woodger F.J. J. Exp. Bot. 2006; 57: 249-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar and 6Kaplan A. Reinhold L. Annu. Rev. Plant Phys. 1999; 50: 539-570Crossref Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Rubisco is a hexadecameric enzyme with a core of eight large subunits (L8) made up of four L2 dimers, each containing two catalytic sites. Attached to each end of the L8 core are four small subunits (S8) that are necessary for catalytic competence (7Andrews T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12213-12219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rubisco carries out the CO2 fixation process in the initial step of the Calvin cycle, yet it is characterized by poor carboxylation kinetics, which is compounded by wasteful competing oxygenase activity. Carboxysomes overcome these shortcomings by elevating the CO2 concentration around Rubisco, thus maintaining a relatively high carboxylase activity while minimizing oxygenase activity. Cyanobacteria, as a class, are highly productive organisms on a global scale, and much of this productivity can be attributed to the efficiency of the CO2-concentrating mechanism. Cyanobacterial cells with Form IB Rubisco contain this enzyme within β-carboxysomes (8Badger M.R. Hanson D. Price G.D. Funct. Plant. Biol. 2002; 29: 161-173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The putative shell proteins of these protein microcompartments are coded for primarily by an operon of ccm-type genes (i.e. ccmKLMNO), and this operon is often closely associated with the genes for the large (rbcL) and small (rbcS) subunits of Rubisco (4Cannon G.C. Bradburne C.E. Aldrich H.C. Baker S.H. Heinhorst S. Shively J.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 5351-5361Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In addition, in most β-cyanobacteria (9Tabita F.R. Photosynth.

U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4437-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar)). The required structural organization of the proteins encoded by these genes, in order to form mature carboxysomes, is a matter that has not yet been resolved. Nonetheless, progress is being made into understanding the protein complexes that make up β-carboxysomes. From Synechocystis PCC6803, for example, Kerfeld et al. (12Kerfeld C.A. Sawaya M.R. Tanaka S. Nguyen C.V. Phillips M. Beeby M. Yeates T.O. Science. 2005; 309: 936-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) have provided crystal structures of CcmK homologues and suggested that CcmK hexamers could form sheets that form the outer shell of the carboxysome. Likewise, So et al. (13So A.K.C. Cot S.S.W. Espie G.S. Funct. Plant Biol. 2002; 29: 183-194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have provided evidence that the CcaA (carboxysomal CA) forms dimers via a particular portion of the C-terminal region.

In this study, we have focused on CcmM as an important β-carboxysomal shell protein, consistent with the observation that deletion of ccmM results in an absence of carboxysomes and a high CO2-requiring phenotype (16Emlyn-Jones D. Woodger F.J. Andrews T.J. Price G.D. Whitney S.M. J. Phycol. 2006; 42: 769-777Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 17Woodger F.J. Badger M.R. Price G.D.

Plant Biol. 2005; 7: 342-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we have consistently found CcmM to exist as 58- and 35-kDa protein products (referred to hereafter as M58 and M35, respectively) (19Price G.D. Sültemeyer D. Klughammer B. Ludwig M. Badger M.R. Can. J. Bot. 1998; 76: 973-1002Google Scholar, 20Long B.M. Price G.D. Badger M.R. Can. J.

Bot. 2005; 83: 746-757Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It is therefore probable that both forms are translated from the same gene transcript and that each form has specific functions within the carboxysome shell. Here we present a novel gene complementation approach that utilizes the carboxysomeless Synechococcus PCC7942 mutant ΔccmM (16Emlyn-Jones D. Woodger F.J. Andrews T.J. Price G.D. Whitney S.M. J.

Plasmid DNA constructs containing chimeric forms of ccmM, coding for His6 tags at both the N and C termini of CcmM, were introduced into both WT and ΔccmM cell types. This allowed for unique tagging of both M58 and M35 within intact carboxysomes and the novel identification of Rubisco and CcaA as binding partners. Expression of N- and C-terminally Tagged His6 CcmM Mutants—Tagged or untagged versions of CcmM where expressed from various shuttle vectors (detailed below) and expressed in either WT Synechococcus PCC7942 cells or in the ΔccmM markerless deletion mutant (17Woodger F.J.

Shuttle Plasmid for N-terminal Hexahistidine Tagging of CcmM—The ccmM gene from Synechococcus PCC7942 was PCR-adapted with primers: forward, 5′-ttgggaggtggatccatggcgagcccaac (adding BamHI and NcoI sites at the underlined start codon); reverse, 5′-ggattcccggaattcttacggcttttg (adding an EcoRI site downstream of the underlined stop codon). The resulting 1.6-kb fragment was cloned into the NcoI and EcoRI sites of the Escherichia coli expression plasmid pTrcHisA (Invitrogen) and verified by DNA sequencing. This trc promoter (hybrid lac and trp promoter) in this plasmid is inducible with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and features an expressed 4-kDa, N-terminal hexahistidine (His6) fusion protein region upstream of the NcoI insertion site. This expression plasmid was converted to a shuttle vector capable of replication in E. coli and Synechococcus PCC7942 via an addition of the 5.1-kb BamHI fragment (blunted) from pSK6B (21Price G.D.

A tag designated CH6 was added at the XhoI site to produce a C-terminal 27-kDa fusion tag comprising the structural gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) and a C-terminal His6 affinity tag; the resulting shuttle plasmid was known as pSE4-ccmM-CH6 (Fig. 1B). Briefly, this involved the PCR adaptation of the CAT gene from pSK6B (21Price G.D. Badger M.R.

These cells were co-transformed with pACYCUb-M35, which directs expression of an N-terminally tagged His6-ubiquitin-M35 fusion (H6-Ub-M35). This was made by amplifying the M35 coding region with primers 5′-SacIIccmM1 (5′-ctccgcggtggaatgagcgcttataacggccaaggccgactc) and 3′-HindIIIccmM (5′-aagcttacggcttttgaatcaacagttc) and cloning the SacII-HindIII fragment into plasmid pHue (25Baker R.T.

For carboxysome isolations, cultures were grown in 1-liter flattened Roux bottles and sparged with ∼2% (v/v) CO2 in air. For mutants harboring spectinomycin or chloramphenicol resistance markers, antibiotics were added to liquid cultures at 7 and 5 μg ml-1, respectively. Carboxysome Isolations—Carboxysomes were enriched to the Triton-Percoll pellet stage (TP pellets) using the Percoll/Mg2+ method as described previously (20Long B.M. Price G.D. Badger M.R. Can. J.

TP pellets resulting from 1.0-liter cultures were resuspended with 0.5 ml of buffer (30 mm EPPS-NaOH, pH 8.0, 20 mm MgSO4, 20% (v/v) glycerol), separated into 50-μl aliquots, and snap-frozen in liquid N2 and then stored at -80 °C.

Growth Rates—Cells were pregrown at 2% (v/v) CO2 and then diluted in fresh modified BG11 medium to a final A730 nm of 0.1, and triplicate 50-ml cultures were then grown at 30 °C, 80 μmol of photons m-2 s-1 illumination, and bubbled either with air or air enriched with 2% (v/v) CO2. Growth was monitored by hourly A730 nm measurements. Maximum growth rates were determined from the slope of logarithmic regressions of the data and transformed into doubling times. Rubisco Assays—Rubisco activity in soluble protein extracts and purified complexes was determined using the 14CO2 fixation assay method of Badger and Price (29Badger M.R. Price G.D. Plant Physiol. 1989; 89: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The protein extracts were prepared from overnight cultures (∼80 ml) grown at 2% CO2. Cells were treated with lysozyme and lysed using a cold French pressure cell according to the method described by Satoh et al. (30Satoh R. Himeno M. Wadano A. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 769-775Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Protein and chlorophyll content of extracts was determined by the methods of Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar) and Porra et al. (31Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedemann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4743) Google Scholar), respectively. Synechococcus PCC7942 Rubisco small subunits (RbcS) used in complementation studies were purified using the procedure described previously (25Baker R.T. Catanzariti A.-M. Karunasekara Y. Soboleva T.A. Sharwood R. Whitney S. Board P.G. Ubiquitin and Protein Degradation, Part A. Vol. 398. Academic Press, Inc., New York2005: 540-554Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometric Measurements—Cells were prepared and analyzed in the mass spectrometer as previously described at 700 μmol of photons m-2 s-1 illumination (32Price G.D. Badger M.R. Plant Physiol. 1989; 91: 514-525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Sültemeyer D. Amoroso G. Fock H.

Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 1959-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) Purification of Tagged Complexes—Enriched carboxysomes (TP pellets) containing ∼0.5 mg of protein were collected by centrifugation (16,100 × g, 1 min) and dissolved in 300 μl of IMAC binding buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 1 m urea). Purifications were also carried out under native conditions without urea. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (16,100 × g, 1 min), and the partially dissociated carboxysomes were transferred to ∼0.2 ml (packed bed volume) of prewashed nickel-charged Profinity IMAC resin (Bio-Rad) and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle inversion. The unbound fraction was retained for analysis, and the resin was transferred to a 14-cm column and washed with 20 ml of IMAC binding buffer by gravity flow. Bound proteins were eluted with 1 ml of IMAC elution buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, 1 m urea). The eluate was maintained on ice and analyzed for Rubisco activity, protein content (see above), and SDS-PAGE (see below). Prior to SDS-PAGE analysis, the purified complexes were concentrated ∼20-fold using Biomax Ultrafree 30-kDa molecular mass cut-off membrane centrifuge filters (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and stored at -20 °C in 1% (w/v) SDS until required. IMAC purification, using the same procedure as above under native conditions, was also carried out on whole cell lysates from isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced E. coli cells expressing either Rubisco alone or Rubisco and H6-Ub-M35. Protein Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—For SDS-PAGE, TP pellets or purified complexes were separated on NuPAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions using the MES-based electrophoresis buffer system. For native PAGE, 4-12% Bis-Tricine NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen) were run overnight at 4 °C using Tris-glycine native running buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, pH 8.3) at 80 V. Proteins were visualized using the GelCode Blue (Pierce) Coomassie Blue stain reagent or the PlusOne Silver Staining kit (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Western blots of SDS-PAGE-separated proteins were probed with Rubisco (34Paul K. Morell M.K. Andrews T.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10019-10026Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), CcmM, and CcaA antibodies and detected as described previously (19Price G.D. Sültemeyer D. Klughammer B. Ludwig M. Badger M.R. Can. J. Bot. 1998; 76: 973-1002Google Scholar, 35Price G.D. Yu J.W. von Caemmerer S. Evans J.R. Chow W.S. Anderson J.M. Hurry V. Badger M.R. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1995; 22: 285-297Google Scholar). N-terminal Sequencing of CcmM Short Forms from Synechococcus PCC7942 and Anabaena PCC7120—Carboxysomes enriched from both Synechococcus PCC7942 and the filamentous β-cyanobacterium Anabaena PCC7120, using the Percoll/Mg2+ technique, were separated in duplicate by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane as described above. The short forms of CcmM from each species were first identified on one replicate blot by Western analysis using polyclonal rabbit serum raised against M35 from Synechococcus PCC7942. The remaining polyvinylidene difluoride blots were stained briefly with Coomassie Blue, and the bands corresponding to the short form of CcmM from each species were excised with a clean scalpel blade. The excised bands were destained with methanol and then air-dried before N-terminal sequencing analysis by seven cycles of Edman degradation chemistry (Australian Proteome Analysis Facility, Sydney, Australia). Transmission Electron Microscopy—Cells were prepared for electron microscopy essentially as described by Price and Badger (32Price G.D. Badger M.R. Plant Physiol. 1989; 91: 514-525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stained sections were viewed using a Hitachi H-7100FA transmission electron microscope at 75 kV. The maximum cross-sectional width of WT carboxysomes (n = 42) was determined from digital images of micrographs from sections of fixed cells, and the data were used to determine carboxysome dimensions for modeling purposes. A series of gene complementation strategies in both Synechococcus PCC7942 WT and ΔccmM mutant cells were undertaken to elucidate the binding partner proteins that associate with the putative carboxysome shell protein CcmM. The carboxysomeless, high CO2-requiring ΔccmM mutant has a markerless deletion of the ccmM gene that does not interfere with the functional expression of the remaining ccmKLNO operon, thereby enabling carboxysome production to be restored by complementing the ΔccmM cells with ccmM genes expressed on a shuttle vector (16Emlyn-Jones D. Woodger F.J. Andrews T.J. Price G.D. Whitney S.M. J. Phycol. 2006; 42: 769-777Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 17Woodger F.J. Badger M.R. Price G.D. Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 1959-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). We have previously described that the CcmM protein within enriched carboxysome fractions from WT cells is present as a full-length form (M58) and a short form (M35), the latter comprising the C-terminal region that contains three RbcS-like domains (19Price G.D. Sültemeyer D. Klughammer B. Ludwig M. Badger M.R. Can. J. Bot. 1998; 76: 973-1002Google Scholar, 20Long B.M. Price G.D. Badger M.R. Can. J.

Our novel complementation strategy therefore utilized both N-terminal and C-terminal His6-tagged variants of both the M35 and M58 peptides to identify their binding partner proteins in intact carboxysomes (summarized in Fig. 1B). The 27-kDa CH6 fusion was used as a large spacer intended to extend the His6 tag beyond the surface of CcmM. Cell Growth and Physiology—Growth rate analysis of each cell type showed that doubling times at ambient and elevated CO2 concentrations are similar in all CcmM complementation mutants compared with WT cells (Table 1). Although there was some variation in the doubling times determined for each mutant, it is important to note that the ability for growth in air was recovered in all of the CcmM (both His6-tagged and untagged) complementation mutants of ΔccmM. Measurements of inorganic carbon (Ci)-dependent O2 evolution also showed that although ΔccmM cells have an increased requirement for Ci (12Kerfeld C.A. Sawaya M.R. Tanaka S. Nguyen C.V. Phillips M. Beeby M. Yeates T.O. Science. 2005; 309: 936-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 13So A.K.C. Cot S.S.W. Espie G.S. Funct. Plant Biol. 2002; 29: 183-194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), complementation with both WT and chimeric forms of ccmM reduced the Ci requirement to WT levels, although maximal O2 evolution rates did require higher Ci concentrations than WT, suggesting slightly impaired carboxysome formation (Fig. 2). Typically, rates at 1 mm Ci were around 20% lower than for WT. Rubisco activity, relative to both chlorophyll and protein concentrations, was similar in ΔccmM and its complemented mutant cell types compared with the WT and complemented WT controls, indicating that Rubisco content was not adversely affected by the variant CcmM complementations (Table 1).TABLE 1Doubling times and Rubisco content of WT, ΔccmM, and CcmM complementation mutant cell types Doubling times were determined from triplicate 50-ml cultures grown at 30 °C and 80 μmol of photons m-2 s-1.

https://openalex.org/W2010266246,"The intraparietal cortex is involved in the control of visually guided actions, like reach-to-grasp movements, which require extracting the 3D shape and position of objects from 2D retinal images. Using fMRI in behaving monkeys, we investigated the role of the intraparietal cortex in processing stereoscopic information for recovering the depth structure and the position in depth of objects. We found that while several areas (CIP, LIP, and AIP on the lateral bank; PIP and MIP on the medial bank) are activated by stereoscopic stimuli, AIP and an adjoining portion of LIP are sensitive only to depth structure. Furthermore, only these two regions are sensitive to both the depth structure and the 2D shape of small objects. These results indicate that extracting 3D spatial information from stereo involves several intraparietal areas, among which AIP and anterior LIP are more specifically engaged in extracting the 3D shape of objects."
https://openalex.org/W2128107373,"The real world presents our sensory systems with a continuous stream of undifferentiated information. Segmentation of this stream at event boundaries is necessary for object identification and feature extraction. Here, we investigate the neural dynamics of event segmentation in entire musical symphonies under natural listening conditions. We isolated time-dependent sequences of brain responses in a 10 s window surrounding transitions between movements of symphonic works. A strikingly right-lateralized network of brain regions showed peak response during the movement transitions when, paradoxically, there was no physical stimulus. Model-dependent and model-free analysis techniques provided converging evidence for activity in two distinct functional networks at the movement transition: a ventral fronto-temporal network associated with detecting salient events, followed in time by a dorsal fronto-parietal network associated with maintaining attention and updating working memory. Our study provides direct experimental evidence for dissociable and causally linked ventral and dorsal networks during event segmentation of ecologically valid auditory stimuli."

In this study, we examined the possibility that these molecules interact and cooperate in this function. We show that HCs and PTX3 colocalize in the cumulus matrix and coimmunoprecipitate from cumulus matrix extracts. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments and solid-phase binding assays performed with purified human IαI and recombinant PTX3 demonstrate that their interaction is direct and not mediated by other matrix components. PTX3 does not bind to IαI subcomponent bikunin and, accordingly, bikunin does not compete for the binding of PTX3 to IαI, indicating that PTX3 interacts with IαI subcomponent HC only. Recombinant PTX3-specific N-terminal region, but not the PTX3-pentraxin C-terminal domain, showed the same ability as full-length protein to bind to HCs and to enable HA organization and matrix formation by Ptx3-/- cumulus cell oocyte complexes cultured in vitro. Furthermore, a monoclonal antibody raised against PTX3 N terminus, which inhibits PTX3/IαI interaction, also prevents recombinant full-length PTX3 from restoring a normal phenotype to in vitro-cultured Ptx3-/- cumuli.

Med. 2006; 24: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Ultrastructural analysis suggests that HA is organized in twisted or coiled fibrillar elements interconnected to each other to form a mesh-like network (2Yudin A.I. Cherr G.N. Katz D.F. Cell Tissue Res. 1988; 251: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Swelling of the fibrils and complete disruption of the gel-like matrix produced by a brief treatment with proteases provided the first evidence for a fundamental role of proteins for organizing HA into a such structure (3Cherr G.N. Yudin A.I. Katz D.F. Dev. Growth Differ. 1990; 32: 353-365Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). More recently, three proteins have been identified as essential for proper formation and stability of the cumulus cell oocyte complex (COC) matrix: inter-α-trypsin inhibitor (IαI or ITI), tumor necrosis factor-induced protein-6 (TSG6 or TNFIP-6), and pentraxin 3 (PTX3 or TSG14) (4Zhuo L.

How these proteins influence and integrate their action in assembling the cumulus matrix is, however, not fully understood. Molecules of the IαI family are serum components consisting of one or two homologous proteins, named heavy chains (HCs), covalently linked to the single chondroitin sulfate chain of bikunin proteoglycan (8Salier J.P. Rouet P. Raguenez G. Daveau M. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). When mouse COCs are induced to expand in vitro in the absence of serum or purified IαI, the matrix is not assembled, albeit HA is synthesized at the normal rate, and COCs disaggregate (9Eppig J.J. J.

Mass spectrometric analyses of analogous HC·HA complexes formed in pathological synovial fluids of human arthritis patients indicate that HCs are linked to HA via an ester bond, as they are to the chondroitin sulfate chain in IαI molecules, implying a transesterification reaction in the process (16Zhao M.

Although PTX3 does not bind to HA, Ptx3-deficient mice, as well as bikunin-null and TSG6-null mice, do show cumulus matrix instability and female infertility. Cumuli from Ptx3-/- mice are unable to organize HA into a matrix, albeit HC·HA complexes are normally formed. On this basis, we hypothesized that a direct interaction of PTX3 with TSG6 or HCs or both is required for proper cumulus matrix assembly. This hypothesis found support in the ability of PTX3 to bind to TSG6 (7Salustri A. Garlanda C. Hirsch E. De Acetis M. Maccagno A. Bottazzi B. Doni A. Bastone A. Mantovani G. Beck Peccoz P.

In this study, we have investigated whether PTX3 could interact with HCs. Association between PTX3 and HCs in mouse cumulus matrix is suggested by their colocalization in the ovary, coimmunoprecipitation from cumulus matrix extracts, and binding assays performed with purified molecules. We also show that HCs interact with the N-terminal domain of PTX3 and that this portion of the molecule is required and sufficient for organizing HA and for enabling matrix formation by Ptx3-/- COCs induced to expand in vitro. Relevance of such interaction is additionally supported by the evidence that a PTX3 antibody blocking PTX3 binding to HCs also prevents the ability of full-length recombinant PTX3 to restore a normal phenotype to Ptx3-/- COC stimulated in vitro.

After 44-48 h, the animals were either sacrificed or injected with 5 IU of hCG. Ovulated COCs were collected from oviductal ampullae 14 h after hCG. Immunofluorescence Analysis—Ovaries or oviducts were dissected from wild type mice at different times from hCG injection, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 4 h at room temperature, washed in TBS, and embedded in paraffin. Five-μm sections were blocked in TBS-glycine, 1% BSA for 45 min and then in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 3% BSA for 30 min at room temperature. For localization of PTX3 and IαI, sections were incubated with 20 μg/ml rabbit anti-human PTX3 polyclonal antibody or with rabbit anti-human IαI polyclonal antibody diluted 1:1000 in PBS with 1% BSA for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, sections were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled anti-rabbit IgG diluted 1:500 (Molecular Probes) for 1 h in PBS with 3% BSA at room temperature. For PTX3 and IαI colocalization in ovulated COCs, oviducts were dissected 14 h after hCG injection, and sections prepared as reported above. Sections were incubated with rabbit anti-human IαI and then with Cy3 goat anti-rabbit IgG diluted 1:400 (Chemicon International) in the same conditions indicated above. Sections were then extensively washed and incubated with biotin-labeled rabbit anti-human PTX3 polyclonal antibody and then with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled streptavidin (Molecular Probes) at the final concentration of 2 μg/ml for 20 min. Hoechst 33258 was added during the last 5 min for staining nuclei. Finally, the sections were visualized with an Axioplan 2 fluorescence microscope. Expression and Purification of PTX3 and IαI—Recombinant mouse and human full-length PTX3 and Cterm-PTX3 and Nterm-PTX3 fragments were expressed by stable transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells (23Bottazzi B.

Briefly, a 1311-bp fragment of human PTX3 cDNA, containing the complete coding sequence, a 741-bp fragment coding for Cterm-PTX3, and a 520-bp fragment coding for Nterm-PTX3 were subcloned in pSG5 and transfected in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Recombinant full-length PTX3, Cterm-PTX3, and Nterm-PTX3 fragments were purified from conditioned medium as described previously (23Bottazzi B. Vouret-Craviari V. Bastone A. De Gioia L. Matteucci C.

Purity of the isolated proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. Immunoprecipitation—All coimmunoprecipitations were performed by first binding human IαI antibody to protein A-Sepharose beads. For each coimmunoprecipitation, 10 μg of rabbit anti-human IαI antibody or rabbit preimmune IgG was added to 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose suspended in 100 μl of PBS with Ca2+and Mg2+ (PBS++). The antibodies were allowed to bind to the beads for 1 h at room temperature while rotating and were then washed three times with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS++. For immunoprecipitation studies of proteins from cumulus matrix extracts, 150-200 ovulated COCs were washed in PBS++ and then incubated with 2 IU of Streptomyces hyaluronidase in 200 μl of PBS++ in the presence of protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at 37 °C. After digestion, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant, containing matrix proteins, was collected. Matrix extract was precleaned by incubation at 4 °C for 1 h with BSA-prebound protein A-Sepharose beads and divided in equal aliquots (equivalent to 50 COCs). An aliquot was directly denatured in SDS/β-mercaptoethanol loading buffer, and the others were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with either immune or preimmune IgG bound to protein A-Sepharose. For immunoprecipitation studies of purified proteins, 1 μg of mouse recombinant PTX3 was mixed with 2 μl of mouse serum or 1 μg of human recombinant PTX3 with 1 μg of IαI purified from human serum, and the mixtures were incubated with either immune or preimmune IgG bound to protein A-Sepharose, as reported above. After incubation, the beads were washed five times with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS++, and the bound material was eluted with 20 μl of Laemmli buffer containing 2% SDS and 6% β-mercaptoethanol and stored a -80 °C until use. Samples were boiled at 100 °C for 5 min before gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis. Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5% polyacrylamide gel) and transferred to Hybond ECL membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was blocked in 5% milk powder in TBS, 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS/T) for 2 h and then incubated with primary antibodies in TBS/T, 5% BSA at 4 °C overnight. For native and recombinant murine PTX3 immunoblots, biotinylated hamster anti-mouse PTX3 polyclonal antibody was used at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. For human recombinant full-length PTX3 and Nterm-PTX3 fragment immunoblots, 1 μg/ml purified rabbit anti-human PTX3 polyclonal antibody was used. For IαI immunoblots, rabbit anti-human IαI polyclonal antibody was added at a dilution of 1:2000. Membranes were then washed four times for 10 min in TBS/T followed by incubation with 1:1000 HRP-linked streptavidin or 1:10000 HRP-linked anti-rabbit F(ab′)2 fragment immunoglobulin in TBS/T, 5% BSA for 1 h. Following washing, the signal was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence and autoradiography using Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Solid-phase Binding Assay—Interaction of PTX3 or PTX3 fragments with IαI was measured as follows. Plates were coated by overnight incubation at 4 °C with 100 μl of purified IαI (10 μg/ml) in 20 mm sodium carbonate, pH 9.5. Wells were then washed three times with PBS++, 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS++/T) and blocked for 2 h at 37 °C with PBS++/T containing 1% BSA. Recombinant full-length PTX3 (∼45 kDa) or Nterm-PTX3 fragment (∼17 kDa) or Cterm-PTX3 (∼25 kDa) diluted in PBS++/T 1% BSA was then added at the concentrations specified under “Results” and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Bound PTX3 and PTX3 fragments were revealed by their reaction with biotin-labeled rabbit anti-human PTX3 polyclonal antibody (1 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C followed by incubation with 100 μl of HRP-conjugated streptavidin diluted 1:5000 for 1 h at room temperature. The enzymatic reaction was developed using the substrate ditetra-methylbenzidine (Sigma) for 10 min. Interaction of PTX3 with bikunin proteoglycan was assessed by measuring the binding of 500 ng/well PTX3 to plates coated with 100 μl of 10 μg/ml bikunin (40 kDa) following the procedure reported above. In competition experiments, biotinylated PTX3 (110 nm) was mixed with unlabeled PTX3 or IαIor bikunin (all at 1100 nm) or with different concentrations of rat monoclonal antibodies MNB4 or rat monoclonal 16B5 before addition to IαI-coated plates. Dose response binding of IαI to immobilized PTX3 was performed by coating wells with 100 μl of PTX3 (10 μg/ml) and adding IαI at the concentrations specified under “Results.” The binding was revealed by rabbit polyclonal anti-human IαI antibody (1 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C followed by incubation with HRP-linked anti-rabbit F(ab′)2 fragment immunoglobulin (1:5000). Isolation and Culture of COCs—Mice were sacrificed at 44-48 h from PMSG injection, and their ovaries were dissected. COCs were mechanically isolated by puncturing large follicles in minimum essential medium containing 25 mm HEPES, 0.1% BSA, and 50 ng/ml gentamycin. Five to 20 compact COCs were cultured in 20-μl droplets, under mineral oil, of minimum essential medium supplemented with 3 mm glutamine, 0.3 mm sodium pyruvate, and 50 ng/ml gentamycin, in the presence of 100 ng/ml FSH (highly purified rat-FSH; kindly provided by the NIDDK and the National Hormone and Pituitary Program, National Institutes of Health) and 1% fetal calf serum, or 5% mouse serum where specified, for 16 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. In Ptx3-/- COC cultures, human recombinant PTX3 or PTX3 fragments were added to the medium at the beginning of culture, at the concentrations indicated in the text. Quantitation of HA—The amounts of HA synthesized by COC cultures were determined by metabolic labeling. Cultures were carried out in the presence of [35S]sulfate (60 μCi/ml) and [3H]glucosamine (100 μCi/ml; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After 16 h of culture, medium and cell matrix were collected separately, and the amount of HA in the two compartments was determined as described elsewhere (12Camaioni A. Hascall V.C. Yanagishita M. Salustri A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20473-20481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PTX3 and IαI Colocalize in the COC Extracellular Matrix—The evidence that both PTX3 and IαI are essential for the organization of HA enriched-matrix prompted us to investigate whether the two proteins colocalize during matrix formation. The temporal pattern of accumulation and distribution of PTX3 and IαI in COCs was analyzed by immunological staining of sections of ovaries isolated from mice treated with PMSG, to stimulate the formation of COCs, and from mice treated with PMSG followed by hCG, to stimulate cumulus matrix synthesis and COC expansion. As shown in Fig. 1A, both proteins were absent in COCs before hCG injection, but they became clearly detectable after hCG treatment. At 6 h from hCG, PTX3 was localized in the matrix surrounding cumulus cells, the most intense staining being found between the innermost layer of corona radiata cells and oocyte. At 9 h from hCG, signal of PTX3 was increased between both corona radiata cells and cumulus cells. A slight positive staining could also be detected around parietal granulosa cells closest to the COC and those lining the antrum, in agreement with the ability of these cells to synthesize HA and to become embedded within the cumulus at ovulation (31Salustri A. Yanagishita M. Underhill C.B. Laurent T.C. Hascall V.C. Dev. Biol. 1992; 151: 541-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 32Ochsner S.A. Russell D.L. Day A. Breyer R.M. Richards J.S. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 1008-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). IαI showed a similar localization and temporal pattern of accumulation in the periovulatory follicle, although it appeared more uniformly distributed throughout the cumulus. In mice, ovulation occurs 12-13 h from hCG, and COCs, released from the follicles, rapidly move to the oviduct. Double staining of PTX3 and IαI in sections of oviducts collected at 14 h from hCG showed that both proteins are abundant in the extracellular matrix of ovulated COCs and that they colocalize (Fig. 1B). PTX3 Coprecipitates with IαI-HCs—Previous studies have shown that the HCs, but not the bikunin subcomponent of IαI, are integrated in the cumulus matrix through the formation of a covalent linkage with HA (4Zhuo L.

To investigate whether PTX3 interacts with HCs in native tissue, we immunoprecipitated HCs from hyaluronidase-digested extracellular matrix of ovulated COCs with anti-human IαI antibody and tested for the presence of associated PTX3 by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2A). In agreement with previous reports, immunoblot of matrix extract with IαI antibody revealed a major band of ∼85 kDa, corresponding to the molecular mass of free HCs of IαI molecules, and two minor bands of higher molecular mass most likely representing clusters of HCs on a single HA strand resistant to hyaluronidase digestion (15Chen L. Zhang H. Powers R.W. Russell P.T. Larsen W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19409-19414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The same bands were generated by proteins eluted from Sepharose-bound anti-IαI antibody but not from uncoated or control IgG-coated Sepharose beads, indicating that the HCs of mouse IαI were specifically and successfully immunoprecipitated by anti-human IαI antibody. The diffuse band at about 50 kDa corresponds to the heavy chains of rabbit immunoglobulins linked to Sepharose beads and eluted in the sample buffer. The same blot, probed with the anti-PTX3 antibody after stripping, showed a positive band of ∼45 kDa, corresponding to the molecular mass of PTX3, in both the matrix extract and the material eluted from IαI antibody-Sepharose beads. Reciprocally, HCs were immunoprecipitated from hyaluronidase-digested COC matrix by PTX3 antibody (supplemental Fig. S1). Although these results suggested an association between PTX3 and HCs of IαI in native tissue, we could not exclude the possibility that the interaction was mediated by other matrix proteins synthesized by cumulus cells. Thus, purified recombinant mouse PTX3 was mixed with mouse serum, which is the physiological source of IαI molecules for cumulus matrix formation, and the mixture was immunoprecipitated with IαI antibody. As shown in Fig. 2B, mouse serum contains two forms of IαI family molecules, pre-α-trypsin inhibitor (PαI) (∼125 kDa) and IαI(∼240 kDa), containing one and two HCs, respectively, and both of them were pulled down by the antibody. Western blot analysis with PTX3 antibody revealed that the recombinant PTX3 was coimmunoprecipitated. The primary structure of PTX3 and HCs of IαI is highly conserved between mouse and humans (33Chan P. Risler J.L. Raguenez G. Salier J.P. Biochem.

In yeast, it is generated from lysophosphatidic acid, which is acylated by Slc1p, an sn-2-specific, acyl-coenzyme A-dependent 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase. Deletion of SLC1 is not lethal and does not eliminate all microsomal 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase activity, suggesting that an additional enzyme may exist. Here we show that SLC4 (Yor175c), a gene of hitherto unknown function, encodes a second 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase.

However, the lipid profiles generated by microsomes from slc1Δ and slc4Δ cells are different, and this suggests that Slc1p and Slc4p have a different substrate specificity or have access to different lyso-glycerophospholipid substrates because of a different subcellular location. Indeed, affinity-purified Slc1p displays Mg2+-dependent acyltransferase activity not only toward lysophosphatidic acid but also lyso forms of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol. Thus, Slc1p and Slc4p may not only be active as 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferases but also be involved in fatty acid exchange at the sn-2-position of mature glycerophospholipids.

Both of these lipid classes are made from phosphatidic acid (PA), a central metabolite, which is taken by several key enzymes into various pathways (1Nebauer R. Birner-Grünberger R. Daum G. Top. Curr. Genet. 2004; 6: 125-167Crossref Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, PA can be synthesized de novo through the acylation of l-glycerol-3-phosphate by Gat1p or Gat2p and subsequent acylation of the thus generated lyso-PA by Slc1p, a lyso-PA acyltransferase (LPAAT). Small variations of this general pathway can be found in various organisms; many eukaryotes, including humans, can synthesize 1-alkenyl-2-acylglycerol-3-phosphate used for plasmalogen synthesis or 1-alkyl-2-acylglycerol-3-phosphate as alternatives to 1,2-bisacylglycerol-3-phosphate. Also, the biosynthesis can start from dihydroxyacetone phosphate instead of glycerol 3-phosphate, as depicted in Fig. 1. Furthermore, yeast can also generate PA through the breakdown of phosphatidylcholine (PC) or phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) operated by phospholipase D (PLD) activities (2Rose K. Rudge S.A.

J. 1996; 314: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). PA also acts as a general regulator of lipid biosynthesis in yeast. This regulation is achieved by the ability of PA to bind and inactivate the transcriptional repressor Opi1p, thereby allowing derepression of the transcription of a large variety of lipid biosynthetic enzymes when PA accumulates (6Loewen C.J. Gaspar M.L. Jesch S.A. Delon C. Ktistakis N.T. Henry S.A. Levine T.P. Science. 2004; 304: 1644-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). SLC1 was first recognized as a 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase in a screen for second site suppressor mutations that would allow yeast to grow in the absence of sphingolipids (7Nagiec M.M. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22156-22163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This seminal study showed that a suppressor effect was due to a point mutation in SLC1, that this gene encoded an LPAAT, and that the suppressing gain of function SLC1-1 allele allowed the enzyme to utilize C26:0 fatty acids instead of the normal C18 species (7Nagiec M.M. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22156-22163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that SLC1 was not essential and that its deletion only eliminated about 60% of microsomal LPAAT activity suggested that a second, unrelated sn-2-specific LPAAT may exist (8Athenstaedt K.

Alternatively, the possibility was not excluded that 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate may spontaneously transmute itself into 2-acylglycerol-3-phosphate by acyl migration and that the latter could be acylated in sn-1 by Gat1p/Gat2p, thus forming PA. The two human SLC1 homologues LPAAT-α and LPAAT-β have been demonstrated to convert lyso-PA to PA, and humans also contain a third homologous gene, LPAAT-ζ. Similar to yeast, humans also harbor two PI4, 5P2-dependent, PC-specific PLDs, PLD1 and PLD2, which generate PA and are activated by ARF, Rho GTPases, and some protein kinase Cs (9Jenkins G.M. Frohman M.A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 2305-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). PA functions in multiple pathways; it acts as a cofactor in Akt/mTOR and Ras/Raf/Erk pathways; it activates protein kinases (Raf-1 and PKCϵ), protein phosphatases (PP1 and SHP-1), and lipid kinases, such as sphingosine kinase 1 and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase; it regulates the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Fgr, plays an essential role in exocytosis and endocytosis, and has numerous other signaling functions (9Jenkins G.M.

Importantly, LPAAT-β is overexpressed in some human cancers, and specific inhibitors of LPAAT-β trigger apoptosis or necrosis of tumor cells, indicating that LPAAT-β plays an important role in signaling pathways critical to tumor cell survival (10Coon M.

In plants, PA increases in response to various stresses, either through the activation of PLD or of diacylglycerolkinase. Subsequently, PA acts on a multitude of downstream signaling pathways to elicit the stress response (12Testerink C. Munnik T. Trends Plant Sci. 2005; 10: 368-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Recent work on the lipid remodeling of glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors in yeast showed that Gup1p is required for the addition of a C26 fatty acid in the sn-2-position of glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors (13Bosson R. Jaquenoud M. Conzelmann A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2636-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Gup1p harbors a membrane-bound acyl transferase motif (MBOAT motif) present in a large variety of acyltransferases of bacteria as well as eukaryotes, including humans. Yeast also harbors four other MBOAT proteins, among which Yor175c still has no known function. Here we show that Yor175c, which we here name SLC4, encodes a 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase that is partially redundant with SLC1.

Wu C. Schade B. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. Gene (Amst.). 2005; 344: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The PCR-amplified SLC4 and SLC1 open reading frames were transfected into slc4Δ and slc1Δ cells, together with SalI-digested pGREG505 and pGREG546, respectively, to generate pGAL1UAS-Yor175c and pGAL1UAS-GST-SLC1 as described (16Jansen G. Wu C. Schade B. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. Gene (Amst.). 2005; 344: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In these transfected strains, the remaining chromosomal SLC1 and SLC4 genes were knocked out by transfection of slc1::hphNT1 and slc4::LEU2 deletion cassettes generated through PCR on plasmids pFA6a-hphNT1 (EUROSCARF) and pRS415 as templates, respectively, thus producing strains 2Δ.SLC4 and 2Δ.SLC1.

After 24 h of growth at 30 °C, cells were again diluted to an A600 nm of 0.01. Cells were grown for an additional 24 h at 30 °C to reach an A600 nm of 4-6. Cells (500 A600 nm units of cells) were washed with 50 ml of ice-cold 10 mm NaN3, resuspended in 10 ml of zymolyase buffer (10 mm NaN3, 1.4 m sorbitol, 50 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.5, 40 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.4 mg/ml zymolyase 20T), and incubated for 1 h at 25 °C without shaking. Spheroplasts were collected by centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and washed with one volume of zymolyase buffer lacking β-mercaptoethanol and zymolyase. Spheroplasts were lysed in 10 ml of lysis buffer 1 (0.2 m sorbitol, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.2, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml chymostatin, 2 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml pepstatin) containing 0.2 mg/ml DNase by vortexing for 1 min, incubating on ice for 10 min, and vortexing for an additional 1 min. A centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C was performed to remove intact spheroplasts. The supernatant was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to pellet the microsomes. The supernatant was discarded, microsomes were resuspended in 3 ml of lysis buffer 1, and 0.15-ml aliquots were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at -80 °C. Purification of GST-Slc1p—FBY4142 cells were grown overnight in SGaa to an A600 of 4, and 2000 A600 units of cells were digested with 0.2 mg/ml zymolyase as described above. Washed spheroplasts were solubilized at 4 °C in 40 ml of lysis buffer 2 (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors as in lysis buffer 1) supplemented with 1% Tween 20; lysis was promoted by vortexing and rotation on a wheel for 1 h. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 4 °C (Sorvall SS-34 rotor; 48,000 × g for 15 min). The supernatant was added to 0.5 ml of MagneGST glutathione particles (Promega, Madison, WI) and left on a rotating wheel for 1 h at 4 °C. The particles were then washed three times with lysis buffer 2 containing 0.1% of Tween 20 and eluted twice with 0.75 ml of the same supplemented additionally with 10 mm reduced glutathione. Glycerol was added to 25%, and 10 aliquots of 0.2 ml of eluate were frozen at -20 °C. The eluate contained 0.0125% of the protein loaded onto the affinity column, and the purification increased the specific activity 400-fold. LPAAT Assay (Acyl-coenzyme A: 1-Acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-Acyltransferase Assay)—Stock solutions (1 mm) of 1-palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphate, 1-stearoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphate, lyso-PC, lyso-PE, lyso-PI, or lyso-PS were prepared in lipid buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm K2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 7.5, containing 1% lipid-free albumin). Lyso-PI was generated by treating PI with phospholipase A2 (PLA2). For the standard assay, reagents were added into a 1.5-ml plastic tube on ice to a final volume of 200 μl in the following order: 20 μl of Tris/HCl 200 mm, pH 7.5, water, 10 μl of lyso-PA (1-palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphate) or lyso-GPL or lipid buffer, 2 μl of 2 mm sodium meta-vanadate, sorbitol to a final concentration of 0.2 m, microsomes (corresponding to 20 μg of proteins unless stated otherwise), and, after a preincubation on ice for 10 min, 1 μl (0.02 μCi = 0.4 nmol) of [14C]oleoyl-CoA in 10 mm sodium acetate/ethanol (1:1). Tubes were incubated at 25 °C for the indicated times. The concentration of [14C]oleoyl-CoA in the standard assay amounts to ∼1.2 mol %. To stop the reaction, 520 μl of CHCl3 and 260 μl of methanol were added to the 200-μl reaction mixture. After vigorous shaking and 1-min centrifugation at 12,000 × g, the lower organic phase was extracted three more times with upper phase from an identical mixture of CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (26:13:10). The lower organic phase was evaporated and resuspended in 30 μl of CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3), and 15-μl aliquots were spotted onto a TLC plate or subjected to analytical treatments. Microsomal Assay of PI, PS, and PE Biosynthesis—Frozen microsomes (20 μg of protein/assay), prepared as described above, were incubated in 1.5-ml plastic tubes, in a final volume of 200 μl for 1 h at 25 °C with either [3H]inositol (15 μCi/tube) or [3H]serine (34 μCi/tube), conditions being very similar to the LPAAT assay. The standard assay buffer contained 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm sorbitol, 1 mm CTP, 2 mm Mg2+, 0.1 mm oleoyl-CoA, and 50 μm lyso-PA (1-palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphate) but no vanadate. Lipids were extracted, desalted, and analyzed by TLC in solvent 1 (see below). Assaying Acyltransferase Activity of Purified GST-Slc1p—Unless indicated otherwise, Tris/HCl (200 mm), lyso-PA or lyso-GPLs or only lipid buffer, and vanadate were added into a 1.5-ml plastic tube on ice to a final volume of 200 μl in the same order and quantities as for microsomal assays (see above). Further additions were Tween 20 in water (0.08% final concentration), 10 μl of 100 mm MgCl2, and purified protein corresponding to five A600 units of cells. After 5 min on ice, 2.5 μl (0.05 μCi = 1.0 nmol) of [14C]oleoyl-CoA were added, and tubes were incubated at 25 °C for 120 min. Reactions were stopped as in microsomal assays. Analytical Procedures and Thin Layer Chromatography—Lipid extracts were dried, resuspended, and sonicated for 30 s in 100 μl of NEBuffer 3 supplemented with 0.1% sodium deoxycholate. 20 units of calf intestinal phosphatase were added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Phospholipase A2 treatment was done with 5 units of PLA2 for 2 h as described (18Sipos G. Reggiori F. Vionnet C. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3494-3505Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). GPLs were deacylated in NaOH as described (19Becker G.W. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 142: 747-754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for 1 h at 37 °C and desalted using CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O partitioning as described above. Ascending TLC on silica 60 gel glass plates was performed with the following solvents: solvent 1, CHCl3, CH3OH, 0.25% KCl (55:45:5); solvent 2, CHCl3, CH3OH, acetic acid, 5% sodium bisulfite (67:26:4.4:2.6). Radioactivity was detected and quantified by two-dimensional radioscanning using a Berthold radioscanner or by exposing TLC plates to an image plate, which was developed by the Bio-Rad molecular Imager FX. Smith Waterman scores were calculated using the World Wide Web. Mass Spectroscopy Analysis of Lipid Extracts—Exponentially growing cells were harvested when they reached an A600 of 2.0, and lipids were extracted as described (20Hanson B.A. Lester R.L. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 309-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using procedure IIIB. At this stage, an aliquot of a similar lipid extract from WT cells grown in [13C]glucose, supplemented with [12C]inositol, was added as an internal standard. Samples were dried and resuspended in CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (16:16:5), heated to 65 °C, and stirred with a rotating pistil (30,000 rpm). Aliquots corresponding to 1 A600 unit of cells were immediately injected into a PVA SIL HPLC column (1 × 150 mm; YMC Europe GmbH, D-46514 Scherbeck, Germany), which was eluted at 45 μl/min. For elution, solvents A (hexane-isopropyl alcohol; 98:2), B (CHCl3-isopropyl alcohol; 65:35), C (CH3OH), all solvents containing 0.1% triethylamine (FLUKA 90335), and an equimolar amount of formic acid were changed linearly over time to give ratios A/B/C as follows: 0 min, 70:30:0; 4 min, 12:88:0; 10 min, 9.8:74.2:16; 12 min, 7.6:61.4:31; 14-20 min, 0:0:100; 22 min, 0:100:0; 26-33 min, 70:30:0. Ions in the effluent were ionized by electrospray ionization with an electrode potential of 3500 V, and the masses of negative ions were detected by a Bruker Esquire-LC ion trap mass spectrometer. The spectrometer automatically fragments ions and records secondary ions. This information is not used routinely but has been used to confirm the identity of signals while the method was being set up. The sum of the signals of selected internal 13C standard GPLs in each lipid class (PI, PE, PS, PC, and phosphatidylglycerol (PG)) was utilized to normalize the sum of signals from the corresponding lipid class in the test sample in order to make the ion counts for a given lipid class (e.g. PI) obtained in different cell lines directly comparable. (On the other hand, due to different ionization efficiency, ion counts obtained for different lipid classes (e.g. PI and PC) do not allow us to estimate the relative abundance of the different lipid classes with regard to each other.) Synthetic Effects of yor175cΔ—In an attempt to find new LPAATs, we tried to delete SLC1 in an are1Δ are2Δ gup1Δ gup2Δ yor175cΔ quintuple mutant lacking all five MBOAT proteins of yeast. Although the quintuple mutant grew reasonably well, it was impossible to delete SLC1 in this background. Further investigation showed that gup1Δ gup2Δ slc1Δ cells were perfectly viable but that it was impossible to delete SLC1 in a yor175cΔ mutant. To test this further, we crossed a haploid slc1::KanMX4 with a haploid yor175c::KanMX4 strain, sporulated the resulting diploid, and analyzed the progeny by dissecting tetrads (Fig. S1A). In many tetrads, less than four spores were germinating; in all tetrads producing three colonies, only two of them were kanamycin-resistant; and in all tetrads producing two colonies, none was kanamycin-resistant (Fig. S1A). At no stage did we observe a difference in colony size between WT and slc1Δ or slc4Δ single mutants (not shown). Microscopic inspection of plates showed that spores having failed to produce colonies had germinated and produced either two or four cells but no more. These data are entirely compatible with the view that the simultaneous presence of both deletions in a haploid cell renders the cell nonviable (i.e. that the two deletions are synthetically lethal). Very bad growth of slc1Δ yor175cΔ double mutants (i.e. strong synthetic sickness between these two deletions) has also been found in a recent global genetic interaction study (21Schuldiner M. Collins S.R. Thompson N.J. Denic V. Bhamidipati A. Punna T. Ihmels J. Andrews B. Boone C. Greenblatt J.F. Weissman J.S. Krogan N.J. Cell. 2005; 123: 507-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). In the following, we will therefore use SLC4 to designate Yor175c. To generate viable double mutants, we transfected slc4Δ and slc1Δ strains with centromeric plasmids containing SLC4 and SLC1 under the GAL1 promoter, a promoter that initiates transcription at a high rate when galactose is present in the medium but which is repressed in the presence of glucose. In slc4Δ and slc1Δ strains containing SLC4 and SLC1, we deleted remaining chromosomal SLC1 or SLC4 genes. The resulting slc1Δ slc4Δ (2Δ) strains harboring a plasmid containing either SLC1 or SLC4 (named 2Δ.SLC1 and 2Δ.SLC4) grew well not only in galactose- but also in glucose-containing liquid media (Fig. S1B). The 2Δ.SLC1 strain also grew well on glucose-containing agar plates (Fig. 2). Data suggest that low amounts of either Slc1p or Slc4p made on glucose media are sufficient for a relatively normal cell growth. However, it was impossible to remove the GST-SLC1-containing plasmid by counterselection on 5-fluoroorotic acid, a compound that will kill cells unless they lose the SLC1-bearing plasmid (Fig. 2). This again demonstrates that slc1Δ is synthetically lethal with slc4Δ. The data in Fig. 2 further show that the gain of function allele Slc1-1p can functionally replace Slc1p and allows slc1Δ slc4Δ cells to grow at a normal rate. Microsomes of slc1Δ Cells Efficiently Transfer Oleic Acid to Lysophosphatidic Acid—About 95-98% of the cellular glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, as measured by the generation of lyso-PA from C18:1-CoA and [14C]glycerol-3-phosphate, resides in microsomes, the remainder being present in lipid bodies (8Athenstaedt K. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7611-7616Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and this activity is encoded by GAT1 and GAT2 (22Zheng Z. Zou J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41710-41716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The incubation of microsomes with C18:1-CoA and [14C]glycerol-3-phosphate allows for the production not only of lyso-PA but also of PA, and such an assay thus simultaneously measures glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferases and LPAATs (8Athenstaedt K. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7611-7616Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Using this assay, we found that microsomes from 2Δ.SLC1 and 2Δ.SLC4 grown for 2 days on glucose produced strongly reduced amounts of PA in comparison with WT cells but that lyso-PA was still made (not shown). To be able to measure sn-2-specific acyltranferase independently from Gat1p/Gat2p activity, we incubated microsomes with [14C]C18:1-CoA in the absence or presence of lyso-PA (1-palmitoyl-glycerol-3-phosphate or 1-stearoyl-glycerol-3-phosphate) (23Saulnier-Blache J.S. Girard A. Simon M.F. Lafontan M. Valet P. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1947-1951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of lyso-PA, microsomes incorporated radioactivity into lipids that comigrated either with PE, PI, PC, and PA standards or with free fatty acids and diacylglycerol (DAG) standards (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6). Interestingly, the appearance of PA, PI, and DAG was strong in microsomes containing S"
https://openalex.org/W2106805297,"Thalamic relay cells transmit information from retina to cortex by firing either rapid bursts or tonic trains of spikes. Bursts occur when the membrane voltage is low, as during sleep, because they depend on channels that cannot respond to excitatory input unless they are primed by strong hyperpolarization. Cells fire tonically when depolarized, as during waking. Thus, mode of firing is usually associated with behavioral state. Growing evidence, however, suggests that sensory processing involves both burst and tonic spikes. To ask if visually evoked synaptic responses induce each type of firing, we recorded intracellular responses to natural movies from relay cells and developed methods to map the receptive fields of the excitation and inhibition that the images evoked. In addition to tonic spikes, the movies routinely elicited lasting inhibition from the center of the receptive field that permitted bursts to fire. Therefore, naturally evoked patterns of synaptic input engage dual modes of firing."
https://openalex.org/W2134150758,"In this study, we characterize the adaptation of neurons in the cat lateral geniculate nucleus to changes in stimulus contrast and correlations. By comparing responses to high- and low-contrast natural scene movie and white noise stimuli, we show that an increase in contrast or correlations results in receptive fields with faster temporal dynamics and stronger antagonistic surrounds, as well as decreases in gain and selectivity. We also observe contrast- and correlation-induced changes in the reliability and sparseness of neural responses. We find that reliability is determined primarily by processing in the receptive field (the effective contrast of the stimulus), while sparseness is determined by the interactions between several functional properties. These results reveal a number of adaptive phenomena and suggest that adaptation to stimulus contrast and correlations may play an important role in visual coding in a dynamic natural environment."
https://openalex.org/W2171362910,"Induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression has been associated with adaptive cytoprotection against a wide array of toxic insults, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unresolved. In this study, we investigated the potential role of carbon monoxide (CO), one of the by-products of the HO-1 reaction, in the adaptive survival response to peroxynitrite-induced PC12 cell death. Upon treatment of rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells with the peroxynitrite generator 3-morpholinosydnonimine hydrochloride (SIN-1), the cellular GSH level decreased initially, but was gradually restored to the basal level. This was accompanied by increased expression of the catalytic subunit of glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCLC), the rate-limiting enzyme in GSH biosynthesis. The SIN-1-induced GCLC up-regulation was preceded by induction of HO-1 and subsequent CO production. Inhibition of HO activity by zinc protoporphyrin IX or knockdown of HO-1 gene expression by small interfering RNA abrogated the up-regulation of GCLC expression and the subsequent GSH restoration induced by SIN-1. In contrast, additional exposure to the CO-releasing molecule (CO-RM) restored the GSH level previously reduced by inhibition of CO production using zinc protoporphyrin IX. Furthermore, CO-RM treatment up-regulated GCLC expression through activation of Nrf2. The CO-RM-induced activation of Nrf2 was under the control of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway. In conclusion, CO produced by HO-1 rescues PC12 cells from nitrosative stress through induction of GCLC, which is mediated by activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and subsequently Nrf2 signaling. Induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression has been associated with adaptive cytoprotection against a wide array of toxic insults, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unresolved. In this study, we investigated the potential role of carbon monoxide (CO), one of the by-products of the HO-1 reaction, in the adaptive survival response to peroxynitrite-induced PC12 cell death. Upon treatment of rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells with the peroxynitrite generator 3-morpholinosydnonimine hydrochloride (SIN-1), the cellular GSH level decreased initially, but was gradually restored to the basal level. This was accompanied by increased expression of the catalytic subunit of glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCLC), the rate-limiting enzyme in GSH biosynthesis. The SIN-1-induced GCLC up-regulation was preceded by induction of HO-1 and subsequent CO production. Inhibition of HO activity by zinc protoporphyrin IX or knockdown of HO-1 gene expression by small interfering RNA abrogated the up-regulation of GCLC expression and the subsequent GSH restoration induced by SIN-1. In contrast, additional exposure to the CO-releasing molecule (CO-RM) restored the GSH level previously reduced by inhibition of CO production using zinc protoporphyrin IX. Furthermore, CO-RM treatment up-regulated GCLC expression through activation of Nrf2. The CO-RM-induced activation of Nrf2 was under the control of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway. In conclusion, CO produced by HO-1 rescues PC12 cells from nitrosative stress through induction of GCLC, which is mediated by activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and subsequently Nrf2 signaling.

Of the two known isoforms of HO (i.e. HO-1 and HO-2), the expression of only HO-1 is induced in response to external stresses. Formerly known as the stress response protein HSP32 in rats, HO-1 confers cytoprotection against oxidative and inflammatory injuries caused by a wide array of noxious or pathogenic insults (2Vile G.F.

In a previous study, we observed that up-regulation of HO-1 prevents the rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells from apoptotic death caused by peroxynitrite (5Li M.-H. Cha Y.-N. Surh Y.-J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; 41: 1079-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). CO produced by elevated HO activity has been found to be responsible, at least in part, for the anti-apoptotic function of up-regulated HO-1 (6Li M.-H. Cha Y.-N. Surh Y.-J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 342: 984-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 7Liu X.M. Chapman G.B. Peyton K.J. Schafer A.I. Durante W. Cardiovasc.

CO is reported to increase the production of cGMP and to exert vasodilatory and anti-apoptotic effects (9Foresti R. Hammad J. Clark J.E. Johnson T.R. Mann B.E. Friebe A. Green C.J. Motterlini R. Br.

Res. 2002; 55: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) reported that the anti-apoptotic function of CO is partially dependent on the activation of soluble guanylate cyclase in vascular smooth muscle cells. Furthermore, a recent study has revealed that the anti-apoptotic effect of CO is associated with activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (10Brouard S. Otterbein L.E. Anrather J. Tobiasch E. Bach F.H. Choi A.M. Soares M.P. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1015-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). In the HO-1-deficient cells, exogenous CO is able to suppress the excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, leading to preservation of viability (11Matsumoto H. Ishikawa K. Itabe H. Maruyama Y. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 291: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It is interesting that, as one of the end products of HO-1-catalyzed heme degradation, CO by itself has been shown to induce HO-1 expression via Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor-2) activation in hepatoma cells (12Lee B.S. Heo J. Kim Y.M. Shim S.M. Pae H.O. Kim Y.M. Chung H.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 343: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A ubiquitous cellular non-protein thiol, reduced GSH is an important antioxidant responsible for the maintenance of intracellular redox balance. The rate-limiting enzyme in GSH biosynthesis is glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL; formerly known as γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase), which consists of catalytic (GCLC) and modifier (GCLM) subunits (13Griffith O.W. Mulcahy R.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1999; 73: 209-267PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of both GCL subunits has been shown to elevate intracellular GSH levels and to protect cells from apoptosis (14Botta D. Franklin C.C. White C.C. Krejsa C.M. Dabrowski M.J. Pierce R.H.

As GSH plays a pivotal role in cellular defense against a wide array of toxic insults (17Lim S.Y. Jang J.-H. Na H.-K. Lu S.C. Rahman I. Surh Y.-J. J. Biol.

Diabetes. 1995; 44: 992-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), we attempted to examine whether CO could elevate the GSH level in PC12 cells challenged with peroxynitrite, thereby providing cytoprotection against nitrosative stress. Here we report that the CO produced as a consequence of peroxynitrite-induced up-regulation of HO-1 expression induces the expression of GCLC via activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and subsequently Nrf2/antioxidant-responsive element (ARE) signaling. Materials—Tricarbonyldichlororuthenium(II) dimer ((Ru(CO)3 Cl2)2, a CO-releasing molecule (CO-RM)), buthionine (S, R)-sulfoximine (BSO), poly-d-lysine, N-acetyl-l-cysteine, and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) were purchased from Sigma. The peroxynitrite generator 3-morpholinosydnonimine hydrochloride (SIN-1) was supplied by BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum, horse serum, nutrient mixture F-12, and N-2 supplement were obtained from Invitrogen. Zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP IX) was the product of OXIS International, Inc. (Portland, OR). [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Antiserum against GCLM was a generous gift from Dr. Terrance J. Kavanagh (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). Cell Culture and Viability Measurement—PC12 cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere of 10% CO2 and 90% air. All cells were cultured in poly-d-lysine-coated culture dishes. Cells were plated at an appropriate density according to the scale of each experiment, and the medium was changed at 3-day intervals. After a 24-h subculture, cells were switched to a serum-free N-2 supplement defined medium for treatment with CO-RM and/or other agents. Cell viability was determined by the MTT assay as described previously (19Li M.-H. Jang J.-H. Surh Y.-J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 39: 890-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). GSH Measurement—The intracellular GSH levels in PC12 cells were assessed using a commercially available colorimetric assay kit (BIOXYTECH GSH-400, OXIS International, Inc.). After exposure to SIN-1 and/or other agents, PC12 cells were harvested and homogenized in metaphosphoric working solution. After centrifugation, 50 μl of R1 solution (solution of chromogenic reagent in HCl) was added to 700 μl of supernatant, followed by gentle vortex mixing. Subsequently, following the addition of 50 μl of R2 solution (30% NaOH), the mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. After centrifugation, the absorbance of the clear supernatant was read at 400 nm. The protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Western Blot Analysis—After treatment with SIN-1 or other agents, cells (1 × 107/7 ml in a 100-mm dish) were collected, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and centrifuged. Cell lysis was carried out at 4 °C by vigorous shaking in cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Following centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was collected and stored at -70 °C until used. The protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay kit. After mixing with loading buffer, protein samples were electrophoresed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane at 300 mA for 3 h. To prevent nonspecific protein binding, the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was blocked for 1 h at room temperature using the blocking buffer (0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 5% nonfat dried milk). Dilutions of primary antibodies, including anti-HO-1 (catalog no. SPA-895, Stressgen, Victoria, Canada); anti-GCLC (catalog no. RB-1697, Lab Vision Corp., Freemont, CA); anti-Akt (catalog no. 9272) and anti-phospho-Akt (catalog no. 9271, Cell Signaling Technology); anti-α-tubulin (catalog no. 32-2500) and anti-lamin B1 (catalog no. 33-2000, Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA); and anti-Nrf2 (catalog no. sc-722), anti-p38 (catalog no. sc-535), and anti-phospho-p38 (catalog no. sc-7973, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), were made in PBS containing 3% nonfat dried milk. Following three washes with PBS and 0.1% Tween 20, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature in PBS containing 3% nonfat dried milk. After three additional washes with PBS and 0.1% Tween 20, the blots were incubated for 1 min in ECL substrate solution (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions and visualized by exposure to x-ray film. Measurement of CO Production—Production of CO resulting from degradation of hemin added to the lysed cell suspension was determined by gas chromatography as described by Srisook et al. (20Srisook K. Han S.S. Choi H.S. Li M.-H. Ueda H. Kim C. Cha Y.-N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2005; 71: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Briefly, after counting the number of harvested cells, they were suspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (500 μl) and lysed further by brief sonication. Hemin (20 μm) and NADPH (80 μm) were added to the lysate (0.9-ml total final volume). After capping the reaction vial (5-ml capacity), it was incubated at 37 °C for various times, generally for 30 min. The reaction was stopped at various times by injecting 100 μl of 50 mm 4-hydroxymercury benzoate through the septum. Subsequently, 1.0 ml of headspace gas was withdrawn and injected into a multigas analyzer (Taiyo Instruments Inc., Osaka, Japan) equipped with a semiconductor detector. Areas under the CO peak and the CO production rate were calculated using the software provided by the manufacturer. Measurement of Bilirubin Production—HO activity was measured by determining the rate of bilirubin production according to the previously described method (3Srisook K. Cha Y.-N. Nitric Oxide. 2005; 12: 70-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 21Naughton P. Foresti R. Bains S.K. Hoque M. Green C.J. Motterlini R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40666-40674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Harvested PC12 cells (1 × 107/7 ml in a 100-mm dish) were washed twice with cold PBS, scraped in the presence of cold homogenization buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.25 m sucrose, and 0.15 m NaCl) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), homogenized, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged again at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The microsomal pellets obtained were resuspended in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 2 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The microsomal fraction (200 μl) was added to the reaction mixture (200 μl) containing 0.8 mm NADPH, 2 mm glucose 6-phosphate, 0.2 units of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 20 μm hemin, 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and 2 mg of rat liver cytosol as the source of biliverdin reductase. Mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in the dark, and the samples were left in an ice bath at least for 2 min to terminate the reaction. Bilirubin formed was quantified by calculating the differences in absorbances measured at 464 and 530 nm (extinction coefficient of 40 mm-1 cm-1 for bilirubin). HO activity is expressed as picomoles of bilirubin formed per mg of protein/h. Preparation of HO-1 Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) and Plasmids—An oligonucleotide sequence for HO-1 siRNA was selected to knock down HO-1 expression using siRNA Target Finder software (Invitrogen). The rat HO-1-specific siRNA (5′-CCG UGG CAG UGG GAA UUU AUG CCA U-3′) and nonspecific siRNA (5′-CCG ACG GUG AGG UUA UAU CGU GCA U-3′) were provided by Invitrogen. pEF (control vector); pEF-DN-Nrf2; and the reporter gene fusion constructs for luciferase vector (pTi-luciferase), wild-type ARE, and GC mutant ARE were kindly provided by Dr. Jeffrey A. Johnson (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI) (22Lee J.M. Moehlenkamp J.D. Hanson J.M. Johnson J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Full-length Akt and Akt with the K179M mutation (kinase-dead Akt) were kind gifts from Dr. An-Sik Chung (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology) (24Kim D. Kim S. Koh H. Yoon S.O. Chung A.-S. Cho K.S. Chung J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1953-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The GCLC promoter-luciferase construct was generously provided Dr. Shelly C. Lu (University of Southern California) (25Yang H. Wang J. Huang Z.Z. Ou X. Lu S.C. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Transient Transfection and Luciferase Reporter Assay—PC12 cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 105/well in 6-well plates. For each sample, cells were transfected with 2.5 μg of pGL3 vector (control) or GCLC-luciferase construct using DOTAP liposomal transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 12 h, the medium was changed, and the cells were treated with CO-RM. The treated cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Luciferase activity was measured using a luciferase assay system (Promega Corp.), and the protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay kit. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from PC12 cells using TRIzol® (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR was performed according to standard techniques. The PCR primers used in this study were as follows: GCLC, 5′-AGA CAC GGC ATC CTC CAG TT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTG ACA CGT AGC CTC GGT AA-3′ (antisense); GCLM, 5′-AGA CCG GGA ACC TGC TCA AC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAT CAC CCT GAT GCC TAA GC-3′ (antisense) (26Tian L. Shi M.M. Forman H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 126-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar); and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-AGT GTA GCC CAG GAT GCC CTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCC AAG GTC ATC CAT GAC AAC-3′ (antisense). Amplification products were resolved by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed under ultraviolet light. All primers were purchased from Bionics (Seoul, South Korea). Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—After treatment with CO-RM, the PC12 cells (1 × 107/7 ml in a 100-mm dish) were washed with cold PBS, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in ice-cold isotonic cell membrane lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Following incubation in an ice bath for 10 min, the broken cells were centrifuged again, the supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in ice-cold nuclear lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After incubation at 0 °C for 20 min, the suspension was centrifuged, and the collected supernatant of the nuclear extract was stored at -70 °C for the Nrf2-ARE binding assay. The protein concentration of nuclear extracts was determined by the Bradford method using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay for the Measurement of Nrf2-ARE Binding—A synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the Nrf2-binding domain (ARE) was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase and separated from the free [γ-32P]ATP by gel filtration using a NICK spin column (Amersham Biosciences). The sequences of oligonucleotides in the double strands used in this study were 5′-TTT TCT GCT GAG TCA AGG TCC G-3′ and 3′-AAA AGA CGA CTC AGT TCC AGG C-5′. The oligonucleotide was synthesized by Bionics. Prior to the addition of the radiolabeled oligonucleotide (100,000 cpm), 10 μg of the nuclear extract was kept on ice for 15 min in gel shift binding buffer (4% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 0.1 mg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA). The DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel at 145 V for 2 h and subjected to autoradiography. Measurement of Intracellular ROS Accumulation—The fluorescent probe 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) was used to monitor net intracellular accumulation of ROS. After treatment with CO-RM for 2 h in the presence or absence of N-acetyl-l-cysteine, cells (1 × 104/ml on a 4-well chamber slide) were rinsed with Krebs-Ringer solution and loaded with 10 μm DCF-DA. After a 15-min incubation at 37 °C, cells were examined under a confocal microscope equipped with an argon laser (488 nm, 200 milliwatt). Statistical Analysis—Where necessary, data were expressed as the means ± S.D., and Student's t test was used to perform statistical analysis for a single comparison. The criterion for statistical significance was p < 0.05. Increased GCLC Expression and GSH Synthesis by Peroxynitrite Are Mediated by the Carbon Monoxide Produced from Up-regulated HO-1—PC12 cells were treated with SIN-1 (2.5 mm), a commonly used peroxynitrite generator, and the GSH levels were measured at different intervals. With 2.5 mm SIN-1, the intracellular GSH level decreased initially for up to 7 h (Fig. 1A). After 7 h, however, the GSH level increased gradually, and by 24 h, the intracellular GSH was completely restored to the basal level (Fig. 1A). To determine whether such restoration of GSH following initial depletion in peroxynitrite-treated cells is mediated via induction of GSH biosynthesis, we examined the expression of GCLC, the rate-limiting enzyme in GSH synthesis. No appreciable changes in GCLC expression were noted at 7 h after treatment with 2.5 mm SIN-1. However, GCLC expression was increased markedly at 24 h of exposure to SIN-1 (Fig. 1B). HO-1 is an important stress-responsive antioxidant enzyme known to be induced by oxidative or electrophilic stimuli that can cause depletion of GSH (27Foresti R. Sarathchandra P. Clark J.E. Green C.J. Motterlini R. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 729-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 28Srisook K. Cha Y.-N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 1709-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, the expression of HO-1 protein was increased significantly in PC12 cells as early as 4 h after exposure to SIN-1 (Fig. 1B). However, the expression of the non-inducible HO-2 isoform remained unchanged (Fig. 1B). In parallel with HO-1 up-regulation, the CO production resulting from increased HO activity was elevated in a time-dependent manner, with a maximal increase observed at 12 h following the SIN-1 treatment (Fig. 1C). To clarify whether the peroxynitrite-derived increase in GCLC expression is causally associated with the up-regulation of HO-1, we utilized the HO inhibitor ZnPP IX. ZnPP IX pretreatment completely inhibited not only HO-1 activity (Fig. 2A), but also GCLC expression induced by SIN-1 in PC12 cells (Fig. 2B). To further verify the association of HO-1 induction with the SIN-1-induced up-regulation of GCLC expression, we examined HO-1 expression after siRNA knockdown of the gene (Fig. 2C). The SIN-1-induced up-regulation of GCLC expression was abolished by transfection with HO-1-specific siRNA, whereas transfection of the PC12 cells with the same amount of nonspecific siRNA was not effective (Fig. 2D). Consistent with the suppression of GCLC expression by ZnPP IX treatment (Fig. 2A), the GSH level was reduced (Fig. 2E). It is interesting that the suppression of GSH synthesis as a result of ZnPP IX-mediated inhibition of GCLC up-regulation was negated by the addition of exogenous CO released from CO-RM (Fig. 2E). Cells treated with the same amount of CO-RM alone exhibited elevated GSH levels. These results suggest that CO derived from the elevated HO-1 activity can mediate the induction of GCLC expression and subsequent GSH synthesis in PC12 cells challenged with SIN-1.FIGURE 2Possible involvement of HO-1 in SIN-1-induced up-regulation of GCLC expression and GSH biosynthesis. A, effect of ZnPP IX on the SIN-1-dependent increase in HO activity as measured by bilirubin production. Cells were pretreated for 12 h in the absence and presence of 0.5 μm ZnPP IX and then incubated for an additional 12 h with SIN-1 (2.5 mm). B, effect of ZnPP IX, an inhibitor of HO activity, on SIN-1-induced GCLC expression. PC12 cells were exposed to SIN-1 (2.5 mm) for 24 h with and without ZnPP IX (0.5 μm) pretreatment for 12 h. Blockage of SIN-1-dependent activation of GCLC expression as a consequence of HO-1 inhibition was verified by immunoblotting. C, blockage of SIN-1-dependent activation of HO-1 mRNA expression by siRNA determined by RT-PCR. D, effect of HO-1 siRNA transfection on the SIN-1-induced up-regulation of GCLC protein expression. Bands were quantitated, and values are expressed as the ratio of HO-1 to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). PC12 cells were transfected transiently with 250 nm nonspecific siRNA or with the same amount of HO-1-specific siRNA prior to SIN-1 (2.5 mm) treatment. E, inhibitory effects of ZnPP IX on SIN-1-induced GSH synthesis. Cells were pretreated for 12 h with or without ZnPP IX (0.5 μm) and then incubated with SIN-1 (2.5 mm) for 24 h in the presence or absence of CO-RM (50 μm). The intracellular GSH level was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data represent the means ± S.D. (n = 3). Significant differences between the compared groups are indicated: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Preincubation with CO-RM Increases the GSH Level and Protects against Cell Death Caused by Peroxynitrite—In a previous study, we reported that CO can protect PC12 cells from SIN-1-induced apoptotic death (6Li M.-H. Cha Y.-N. Surh Y.-J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 342: 984-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To elucidate the plausible mechanism by which CO could protect against apoptosis caused by SIN-1, we determined the level of GSH present in cells pretreated with CO-RM. Preincubation of PC12 cells with increasing doses of CO-RM for 1 h prevented the loss of GSH caused by exposure to SIN-1 for 7 h in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). It is interesting that the GSH level in cells pretreated with the highest nontoxic dose of CO-RM (50 μm) was even higher than that in control cells not exposed to SIN-1. To examine whether the increased GSH biosynthesis induced by pre-exposure to CO-RM is responsible for the cytoprotective effect against the cytotoxicity caused by SIN-1, we compared the cytoprotective effects of CO-RM in the presence and absence of BSO, an irreversible and specific inhibitor of GCL. As shown in Fig. 3B, the CO-RM-induced protection of PC12 cells against SIN-1-induced cytotoxicity was negated when GCL-catalyzed GSH synthesis was blocked with BSO. Moreover, the intracellular GSH level in PC12 cells treated with CO-RM ((Ru(CO)3Cl2)2) alone was increased, but the cells treated with the metal carrier alone (RuCl3) failed to enhance the GSH biosynthesis (Fig. 3C). Combined, these results suggest that the anti-apoptotic effect of CO in peroxynitrite-treated PC12 cells is mediated, at least in part, by induced GSH biosynthesis, possibly resulting from up-regulation of GCLC expression. CO-RM Alone Induces GCLC Expression—To further verify the increased GSH biosynthesis following CO-RM exposure, the effect of CO-RM alone on GCL expression was determined. When PC12 cells were treated with CO-RM (50 μm), up-regulation of GCLC and GCLM proteins was evident at 7 h (Fig. 4A). The induction of GCLC and GCLM gene transcription by CO-RM was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, the GCLC promoter activity was transiently elevated upon CO-RM treatment as determined by the luciferase reporter gene assay (Fig. 4C). CO-RM Up-regulates GCLC Expression through Activation of Nrf2—The promoters of both human GCL subunit genes are known to contain consensus ARE sequences that play essential roles in regulating the cellular response to oxidative stress (29Mulcahy R.T.

https://openalex.org/W2049861456,"Nodal activity in the left lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) is required to activate left-sided Nodal signaling in the epithalamic region of the zebrafish forebrain. Epithalamic Nodal signaling subsequently determines the laterality of neuroanatomical asymmetries. We show that overactivation of Wnt/Axin1/beta-catenin signaling during late gastrulation leads to bilateral epithalamic expression of Nodal pathway genes independently of LPM Nodal signaling. This is consistent with a model whereby epithalamic Nodal signaling is normally bilaterally repressed, with Nodal signaling from the LPM unilaterally alleviating repression. We suggest that Wnt signaling regulates the establishment of the bilateral repression. We identify a second role for the Wnt pathway in the left/right regulation of LPM Nodal pathway gene expression, and finally, we show that at later stages Axin1 is required for the elaboration of concordant neuroanatomical asymmetries."
https://openalex.org/W2148063708,"In this study we investigated the commonality and biosynthesis of the O-methyl phosphoramidate (MeOPN) group found on the capsular polysaccharide (CPS) of Campylobacter jejuni. High resolution magic angle spinning NMR spectroscopy was used as a rapid, high throughput means to examine multiple isolates, analyze the cecal contents of colonized chickens, and screen a library of CPS mutants for the presence of MeOPN. Sixty eight percent of C. jejuni strains were found to express the MeOPN with a high prevalence among isolates from enteritis, Guillain Barré, and Miller-Fisher syndrome patients. In contrast, MeOPN was not observed for any of the Campylobacter coli strains examined. The MeOPN was detected on C. jejuni retrieved from cecal contents of colonized chickens demonstrating that the modification is expressed by bacteria inhabiting the avian gastrointestinal tract. In C. jejuni 11168H, the cj1415-cj1418 cluster was shown to be involved in the biosynthesis of MeOPN. Genetic complementation studies and NMR/mass spectrometric analyses of CPS from this strain also revealed that cj1421 and cj1422 encode MeOPN transferases. Cj1421 adds the MeOPN to C-3 of the β-d-GalfNAc residue, whereas Cj1422 transfers the MeOPN to C-4 of d-glycero-α-l-gluco-heptopyranose. CPS produced by the 11168H strain was found to be extensively modified with variable MeOPN, methyl, ethanolamine, and N-glycerol groups. These findings establish the importance of the MeOPN as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for C. jejuni and set the groundwork for future studies aimed at the detailed elucidation of the MeOPN biosynthetic pathway.

Although not every strain has been examined, it is thought that each one produces a CPS having a different structure (11Penner J.L. Aspinall G.O. J. Infect.

Furthermore, there can be extensive phase-variable structural modifications such as the incorporation of methyl, ethanolamine, and aminoglycerol groups on CPS sugars (13Szymanski C.M. St. Michael F.

The most unusual CPS modification is the O-methyl phosphoramidate CH3OP(O)(NH2)(OR) (MeOPN) group, which is a labile phosphorylated structure. Nitrogen-phosphorus bonds are rare in nature, and we reported the first example of such a structure produced by a bacterium in the CPS of C. jejuni NCTC11168 (HS:2) (13Szymanski C.M. St. Michael F.

Since this initial study, the G1 (HS:1), NCTC12517 (HS:19) and 81-176 (HS:23/26) strains of C. jejuni have been shown to produce MeOPN (14McNally D.J. Jarrell H.C. Li J. Khieu N.H. Vinogradov E.

Preliminary structural analyses of CPS from different C. jejuni serotypes suggested the presence of the MeOPN modification on a diverse range of CPS sugars (18Karlyshev A.V. Champion O.L. Churcher C. Brisson J.R. Jarrell H.C. Gilbert M. Brochu D. St. Michael F. Li J. Wakarchuk W.W. Goodhead I. Sanders M. Stevens K. White B. Parkhill J. Wren B.W. Szymanski C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 90-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This observation prompted us to isolate and elucidate the CPS structure from the G1 and NCTC12517 strains. The G1 CPS was subsequently shown to have a [-4)-α-d-Galp-(1-2)-(R)-Gro-(1-P]n repeating unit with two labile β-d-fructofuranose branches at C-2 and C-3 of Gal. Each fructofuranose was further substituted at C-3 with MeOPN groups (14McNally D.J. Jarrell H.C. Li J. Khieu N.H. Vinogradov E. Szymanski C.M. Brisson J.R. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 4407-4422Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Similarly, the NCTC12517 CPS was shown to have a [-4)-β-d-GlcA6NGro-(1-3)-β-d-GlcNAc-(1-]n repeating unit with a labile α-l-sorbofuranose branch at C-2 of GlcA and an MeOPN at C-4 of GlcNAc (15McNally D.J. Jarrell H.C. Khieu N.H. Li J. Vinogradov E. Whitfield D.M. Szymanski C.M. Brisson J.R. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 3975-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For both strains, the keto sugars and MeOPN groups were found to be nonstoichiometric and were hypothesized to contribute to the overall structural heterogeneity of the CPS. Furthermore, the MeOPN was found to be variably methylated in the NCTC12517 strain thereby adding additional variability to an already structurally heterogeneous CPS. Most recently, Kanipes and co-workers (16Kanipes M.I. Papp-Szabo E. Guerry P. Monteiro M.A. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 3273-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the 81-176 strain also has a MeOPN CPS modification and provided evidence to show that it most likely is found at C-2 of the galactose residue. In a recent study, the CPS biosynthetic regions for selected strains of C. jejuni were sequenced, including 176.83 (HS:41), 81-176, ATCC43456 (HS:36), CCUG10954 (HS:23), NCTC12517, and G1 (18Karlyshev A.V. Champion O.L. Churcher C. Brisson J.R. Jarrell H.C. Gilbert M. Brochu D. St. Michael F. Li J. Wakarchuk W.W. Goodhead I. Sanders M. Stevens K. White B. Parkhill J. Wren B.W. Szymanski C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 90-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Comparison of the CPS sequences for the NCTC12517, 176.83, and G1 strains to the genome-sequenced NCTC11168 strain provided evidence for multiple mechanisms of CPS variation, including exchange of capsular genes by horizontal transfer, gene duplication, deletion, fusion, and contingency gene variation. Interestingly, the study uncovered the presence of a highly conserved gene cluster (cj1415-cj1420) within those strains that produce the MeOPN CPS modification (NCTC11168, NCTC12517, G1, 81-176). Because these genes have no apparent role in sugar biosynthesis and because their presence coincides with the presence of MeOPN on CPS sugars, it was hypothesized that they might be involved in MeOPN biosynthesis. Furthermore, in our recent study we demonstrated that 1H and one-dimensional 1H-31P HSQC high resolution magic angle spinning (HR-MAS) NMR can be used to quickly detect MeOPN from microliter amounts of intact bacterial cells (19McNally D.J. Lamoureux M. Li J.J. Kelly J. Brisson J.R. Szymanski C.M. Jarrell H.C. Can. J. Chem. 2006; 84: 676-684Crossref Google Scholar). In this study, we explore the commonality of the MeOPN modification among C. jejuni strains by using HR-MAS NMR as a rapid, high throughput means to directly examine several animal and human isolates from diverse clinical presentations and geographical locations. A chicken model was then developed to evaluate MeOPN expression within the natural avian host. Finally, genes implicated in MeOPN biosynthesis were identified by using HR-MAS NMR to compare a library of CPS mutants for the presence of MeOPN. The identity of two MeOPN transferases was then established using genetic complementation together with high resolution NMR and mass spectrometric studies of purified CPS. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—C. jejuni NCTC11168 (HS:2) and its motile variant, 11168H (HS:2) were routinely grown on Mueller Hinton (MH) agar (Difco) at 37 °C under microaerobic conditions (85% N2, 10% CO2, 5% O2). The NCTC11168 strain was originally isolated from a case of human enteritis (20Ahmed I.H. Manning G. Wassenaar T.M. Cawthraw S. Newell D.G. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 1203-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and later sequenced by Parkhill et al. (21Parkhill J. Wren B.W. Mungall K. Ketley J.M. Churcher C. Basham D. Chillingworth T. Davies R.M. Feltwell T. Holroyd S. Jagels K. Karlyshev A.V. Moule S. Pallen M.J. Penn C.W. Quail M.A. Rajandream M.A. Rutherford K.M. van Vliet A.H. Whitehead S. Barrell B.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). To select for kanamycin (Kan)-resistant mutants, Kan was added to the medium at a final concentration of 30 μg/ml. For large scale extraction of CPS, 6 liters of bacteria were grown in brain heart infusion broth (Difco) under microaerobic conditions at 37 °C for 24 h with agitation at 100 rpm. Bacterial cells were then harvested by centrifugation (9,000 × g for 20 min) and placed in 70% ethanol. Cells were removed from the ethanol solution by centrifugation (9000 × g for 20 min), and the bacterial pellet was refrigerated until extraction. High Resolution Magic Angle Spinning (HR-MAS) NMR Spectroscopy—Bacterial cells were prepared and analyzed by HR-MAS NMR spectroscopy as described previously (13Szymanski C.M. St. Michael F.

Lamoureux M. Li J.J. Kelly J. Brisson J.R. Szymanski C.M. Jarrell H.C. Can. J. Chem. 2006; 84: 676-684Crossref Google Scholar). HR-MAS NMR experiments were performed using a Varian Inova 500-MHz (1H) spectrometer (Varian, Palo Alto, CA) equipped with a Varian 4-mm indirect detection gradient nano-NMR probe with a broadband decoupling coil. Samples were spun at 3 kHz, and spectra were recorded at ambient temperature (23 °C). HR-MAS NMR experiments were generally performed with suppression of the HOD signal using presaturation as described previously (13Szymanski C.M. St. Michael F. Jarrell H.C. Li J. Gilbert M. Larocque S. Vinogradov E. Brisson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24509-24520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). 1H NMR spectra of bacterial cells were acquired using the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill pulse sequence (90-(τ-180-τ)n acquisition) to remove broad signals originating from lipids and solid-like materials (22Meiboom S. Gill D. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1958; 29: 688-691Crossref Scopus (4685) Google Scholar) and were typically obtained using 256 transients (11 min). The total duration of the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill pulse (n × 2τ) was 10 ms with τ set to 1/MAS spin rate. One-dimensional 1H-31P HSQC spectra were acquired using the standard Varian HSQC pulse sequence with one-dimensional spectra representing the first increment of the standard HSQC experiment. All 1H NMR spectra were referenced to an internal 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionic-2,2,3,3-d4 acid sodium salt standard (δH 0.00 ppm). Bacterial Colonization of Specific Pathogen-free Leghorn Chicks—The inoculum for each chick colonization experiment was prepared by harvesting C. jejuni 11168H cells, grown for 18 h into a 0.1 m (pH 7.4) phosphate-buffered saline solution (supplemented with 0.14 m NaCl and 0.002 m KCl). One-day-old specific pathogen-free chicks were orally gavaged with 300 μl of inoculum containing ∼3 × 1010 bacterial cells. Because chicks typically do not consume feed during the first 48 h after hatching (23Moran E.T. Reinhart Jr., B.S. Poult. Sci. 1980; 59: 1521-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), cecal contents were analyzed 48 h post oral gavage to minimize the amount of particulate matter within the cecal contents that could potentially interfere with HR-MAS NMR. Furthermore, only adherent bacteria should be present at 48 h post oral gavage because the rate of passage through the gastrointestinal tract of leghorns is ∼4 h (24Gordon R.W. Roland Sr., D.A. Poult. Sci. 1997; 76: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). All chicks were euthanized by cervical dislocation according to the approved guidelines of the Canadian Council for Animal Care. Cecal contents were then serially plated onto Karmali agar (Oxoid, Ontario, Canada) and examined for the presence of C. jejuni and for MeOPN using HR-MAS NMR spectroscopy. In total, the cecal contents from 39 chicks were examined (13 chicks from three independent experiments). Construction of C. jejuni Site-specific Mutations—Mutants were constructed via insertion of a kanr cassette into unique sites present within appropriate pUC18-based recombinant plasmids from a random genomic library of C. jejuni (strain NCTC11168) that was constructed during the course of the genome sequencing project (21Parkhill J. Wren B.W. Mungall K. Ketley J.M. Churcher C. Basham D. Chillingworth T. Davies R.M. Feltwell T. Holroyd S. Jagels K. Karlyshev A.V. Moule S. Pallen M.J. Penn C.W. Quail M.A. Rajandream M.A. Rutherford K.M. van Vliet A.H. Whitehead S. Barrell B.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar) (supplemental Table 1). The kanr cassette was inserted in a nonpolar orientation, and the derivatives were used for transformation of the C. jejuni 11168H strain via electroporation. Mutants were verified by PCR using gene-specific and kanr-specific primers. The cj1421/cj1422 double mutant was created through spontaneous insertion of the kanr cassette into both genes during construction of the cj1422 mutant because of the presence of identical regions for these genes. Integration of the kanr cassette within both genes was detected by PCR analysis using cj1421 and cj1422-specific primers and was later confirmed by sequencing. Complementation Studies of the cj1421/cj1422 Double Mutant—cj1421 and cj1422 were PCR-amplified using chromosomal DNA obtained from the 11168H strain and high fidelity Taq polymerase (Accuprime Taq HiFi, 95 °C 15 s, 30 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 15 s, and 68 °C for 2 min) (Invitrogen) using the primers listed in supplemental Table 2. PCR fragments containing complete gene copies were then used for complementation studies using the pRED1 integrational expression vector according to Karlyshev and co-workers (25Karlyshev A.V. Wren B.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 4004-4013Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To produce the delivery plasmids pRR1421 and pRR1422, a 0.7-kb gfp-SwaI/XbaI fragment of pRED1 was replaced with a 1.9-kb PCR product that was digested with PmeI/XbaI. As a precaution, pRR1421 and pRR1422 were sequenced because cj1421 and cj1422 contain homopolymeric G tracts that are prone to length variation (18Karlyshev A.V. Champion O.L. Churcher C. Brisson J.R. Jarrell H.C. Gilbert M. Brochu D. St. Michael F. Li J. Wakarchuk W.W. Goodhead I. Sanders M. Stevens K. White B. Parkhill J. Wren B.W. Szymanski C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 90-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Following electroporation of the delivery constructs into the appropriate mutants, complemented strains were selected on blood agar plates and supplemented with Kan (50 μg/μl) and chloramphenicol (15 μg/μl). Integration of the cmr cj1421 and cmr cj1422 gene fusions into the rRNA gene cluster on the 11168H chromosome was confirmed by PCR as described previously (25Karlyshev A.V. Wren B.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 4004-4013Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Isolation and Purification of CPS—For large scale extraction of CPS, 6 liters of the C. jejuni 11168H wild type and the cj1421 mutant were grown in brain heart infusion broth under microaerobic conditions at 37 °C for 24 h with agitation at 100 rpm. Capsular polysaccharide was then isolated and purified using a gentle enzymatic method according to McNally et al. (14McNally D.J. Jarrell H.C. Li J. Khieu N.H. Vinogradov E. Szymanski C.M.

High Resolution NMR Spectroscopy of Purified CPS—For NMR spectroscopy of CPS isolated from the C. jejuni 11168H wild type and the cj1421 mutant, ∼3 mg of pure CPS was suspended in 200 μl of 99% buffered D2O (50 mm NH4HCO3, pD 8.0) and placed in a 3-mm NMR tube. NMR experiments were performed using a Varian Inova 500 MHz (1H) spectrometer equipped with a Varian Z-gradient 3-mm triple resonance (1H, 13C, 31P) probe, or a Varian 600 MHz (1H) spectrometer equipped with a Varian 5-mm, Z-gradient triple resonance cryogenically cooled probe (cold probe). One-dimensional 31P spectra were acquired using a Varian Mercury 200-MHz (1H) spectrometer and a Nalorac 5-mm four nuclei probe. NMR experiments were typically performed at 25 °C with suppression of the HOD resonance at 4.78 ppm. Standard homo- and heteronuclear correlated two-dimensional pulse sequences from Varian were used for general assignments. Selective one-dimensional total correlation spectroscopy and NOESY experiments with a Z-filter were used for complete residue assignment as well as for measuring JH,H coupling constants and nuclear Overhauser enhancements (26Brisson J.R.

Proton and carbon resonances were referenced to an internal acetone standard (δH 2.225 ppm, δC 31.07 ppm), whereas phosphorus signals were referenced to an external 85% phosphoric acid standard (δP 0.00 ppm). Mass Spectrometric Analyses of Purified CPS—CPS isolated from the C. jejuni 11168H wild type and the cj1421 mutant were mass-analyzed using in-source collision-induced dissociation CE-ESI/MS according to Li et al. (28Li J. Wang Z. Altman E. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2005; 19: 1305-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) with a Prince system capillary electrophoresis instrument (Prince Technologies, Emmen, The Netherlands) coupled to a 4000 Qtrap spectrometer (Applied Biosystems/Sciex, Foster City, CA) via a microIon spray interface. A sheath solution (isopropyl alcohol/methanol, 2:1) was delivered at a flow rate of 1 μl/min. Separations were achieved on ∼90 cm of bare-fused silica capillary (360 μm outside diameter × 50 μm inner diameter, Polymicro Technologies, Phoenix, AZ) using 15 mm ammonium acetate/ammonium hydroxide in deionized water, pH 9.0, containing 5% MeOH as the separation buffer. A voltage of 20 kV was typically applied during CE separation, and +5 kV was used as electrospray voltage. Mass spectra were acquired with dwell times of 3.0 ms per step of 0.1 m/z-1 unit in full mass scan mode using an orifice voltage of +400 V. Fragment ions formed by collision activation of selected precursor ions with nitrogen in the RF-only quadrupole collision cell were then mass-analyzed by scanning the third quadrupole. Commonality and Specificity of the MeOPN CPS Modification in Campylobacter—Assessing the commonality and specificity of MeOPN expression among Campylobacter isolates is important to determine the abundance of this CPS modification and its potential as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target. Previous studies have shown that the MeOPN is readily detected on the surface of intact C. jejuni cells using HR-MAS 1H NMR spectroscopy (13Szymanski C.M. St. Michael F. Jarrell H.C. Li J. Gilbert M.

The MeOPN can be considered as a unique NMR tag because signals arising from its -OCH3 protons are intense compared with other CPS signals and have a unique chemical shift and phosphorus scalar coupling. To assess MeOPN prevalence, intact cells from 63 C. jejuni strains and 18 Campylobacter coli strains were screened using HR-MAS 1H NMR, as well as 31P decoupled, 1H-31P HSQC HR-MAS NMR experiments. The C. jejuni strains were comprised of human and animal isolates; originated from a range of geographical locations that included Canada, the United States, Japan, the Netherlands, Brazil, and the United Kingdom; and are responsible for a variety of clinical presentations, including asymptomatic, enteritis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, Miller-Fisher syndrome, and septicemia (Table 1). Overall, 43 of 63 or 68% of the C. jejuni strains were found to express the MeOPN CPS modification. Interestingly, the MeOPN was observed for 82% of enteritis strains, 80% of Guillain Barré syndrome strains, and 100% of Miller-Fisher syndrome strains. In contrast, MeOPN was not detected for any of the 18 C. coli strains examined.TABLE 1Presence (+) or absence (-) of the O-methyl phosphosphoramidate (MeOPN) capsular polysaccharide modification for C. jejuni and C. coli strains as determined using HR-MAS 1H NMR and 31P decoupled, 1H-31P HSQC HR-MAS NMR experiments to screen for the presence of the MeOPNSource/disease stateMeOPN+MeOPN-C. jejuni AsymptomaticCj31481,aSee Ref. 30 Cj31485,aSee Ref. 30 Cj32787,aSee Ref. 30 Cj32799,aSee Ref. 30 Cj33106aSee Ref. 30Cj31467,aSee Ref. 30 Cj33084aSee Ref. 30 Enteritis81-176,bSee Ref. 34 ATCC43429, ATCC43446, ATCC43456, Cj60, Cura235, NCTC11168,cSee Ref. 21 NCTC12517, RM1244dSee Ref. 35176.83, CCUG10954 Guillain-Barré syndromeCura276,dSee Ref. 35 G1,bSee Ref. 34 GB2,eSee Ref. 36 GB11eSee Ref. 36OH4384fSee Ref. 5 Miller-Fisher syndromeMF6,eSee Ref. 36 MF7,eSee Ref. 36 MF20eSee Ref. 36 SepticemiaCj43983,aSee Ref. 30 Cj46979, Cj47886,aSee Ref. 30 Cj52472Cj34007,aSee Ref. 30 Cj4411a,bSee Ref. 34 Cj47439, Cj53250aSee Ref. 30 Animal and animal productsCj198, Cj207, Cj11848,aSee Ref. 30 Cj11919,aSee Ref. 30 Cj11974,aSee Ref. 30 Cj12241,aSee Ref. 30 Cj12567,aSee Ref. 30 NCTC12658, NCTC12659, NCTC12660, NCTC12661, NCTC12664, NCTC1 2665, RM1184, RM1285, RM1850,dSee Ref. 35 RM3668Cj120, Cj150, Cj160, Cj178, Cj206, Cj212, Cj220, Cj230, NCTC12663, RM1216, RM1221gSee Ref. 37C. coliCc"
https://openalex.org/W2130269001,"Galectins are widely expressed in epithelial tissues and have been implicated in a variety of cellular processes, including adhesion and polarization. Here we studied the contributions of galectins in cell adhesion and cyst formation of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Quantitative single cell force spectroscopy and standard adhesion assays were employed to study both early (<2 min) and long term (90 min) adhesion of cells to different extracellular matrix components. Inhibitors were used to examine the contribution of integrins and galectins in general and RNA interference to specifically address the role of two abundantly expressed galectins, galectin-3 and -9. We found that both galectin-3 and -9 were required for optimal long term cell adhesion to both collagen I and laminin-111. Early adhesion to laminin was found to be integrin-independent and was instead mediated by carbohydrate interactions and galectin-3 and -9. The opposite was observed for early adhesion to collagen. Although similar, the contributions of galectin-3 and -9 to adhesion appeared to be by distinct processes. These defects in adhesion of the two galectin knockdown cell lines may underlie the epithelial phenotypes observed in the cyst assays. Our findings emphasize the complex regulation of epithelial cell functions by galectins.

Therefore, the characterization of interactions between ECM components and receptors at the cell surface is essential to understand the formation and maintenance of the epithelium.Galectins constitute a family of structurally related proteins that bind to β-galactoside residues and interact with a broad spectrum of ligands (5Cooper D.N.

Most if not all galectins are di- or multivalent and are therefore able to function as versatile cross-linkers of glycosylated cell surface molecules (7Leffler H. Carlsson S. Hedlund M. Qian Y. Poirier F. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 19: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar).

A quantitative analysis of early events of cell-substratum adhesion was performed using single cell force spectroscopy (SCFS).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Transfection—MDCK strain II cells were maintained in Earle's MEM (EMEM; PAA Laboratories) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) and with 5% FCS (PAA Laboratories; 10% for Transwell filter (Corning Costar) and cyst cultures). MDCK cells expressing the Myc-tagged galectin-9 were generated by retroviral transduction followed by hygromycin B (800 μg/ml; BD Biosciences) selection for 3 days. The resulting cells were grown for up to 20 passages. The Phoenix gag-pol retroviral packaging cell line (obtained from the ATCC with authorization by Garry Nolan, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA) was kept in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing l-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% FCS.For three-dimensional cell cultures, subconfluent MDCK cells were trypsinized and suspended to 5 × 106 cells/ml in PBS. Cells were pipetted into growth factor-reduced Matrigel™ (BD Biosciences) solution at 2 × 105 cells/ml and onto 24-well plates. After 30–45 min at 37 °C, medium was added, and the incubation was continued for 2–8 days. Medium was replaced every 2–3 days.For transient transfections, 2 × 106 MDCK cells/condition were trypsinized, washed with PBS, and resuspended in 100 μl of Nucleofector solution T (Amaxa Biosystems). DNA (4 μg) was added, and electroporation was performed using program G-16 on an Amaxa Nucleofector (Amaxa Biosystems).Antibodies and Constructs—The mouse monoclonal anti-Myc (9E10) antibody was provided by D. Drechsel (Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, Dresden, Germany). The gp135/podocalyxin antibody cell line, 3F2 (16Meder D. Shevchenko A. Simons K. Fullekrug J. J.

Rat monoclonal galectin-3 (Mac-2; Cedarlane Laboratories Ltd.), RGD peptide (Sigma), mouse monoclonal integrin α-6 antibody (BD Biosciences), and fluorescein isothiocyanate- and Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Europe Ltd.) were purchased.Hamster galectin-3 cDNA was a gift of Dr. R. C. Hughes (National Institute for Medical Research, London, UK). Canine galectin-9 cDNA was PCR-amplified from our MDCK expressed sequence tag (EST) library. We obtained two variants (972 and 1068 bp; the latter, having a 96-bp insertion in its linker domain, was used). For the Gal9-6×Myc construct, an XbaI site was added between N-terminal lectin and linker domains. Six Myc tags where inserted into this site, and the Gal9-6×Myc fragment between BglII and XhoI restriction sites was subcloned into a BamHI/SalI-digested retroviral pBABE-hygro vector.Retrovirus-mediated RNAi—Target sequences (Gal3-KD-528, GCT GAT AAC AAT TCT GGG CAC; Gal9-KD-298, GAG CTC TGC TTC ATG GTG AAC; Gal9-KD-867, GGA TGG TGA GCA CCT GTT TGA) corresponding to the canine galectin-3 (residues 528–548) and galectin-9 (residues 298–318 and 867–887) coding sequences were selected. Sequences were obtained from the MDCK EST library. Annealed oligonucleotides (supplemental Table S1) were cloned into an RVH-1-puro retroviral vector, and recombinant knockdown (KD) viruses were generated as described previously (18Schuck S. Manninen A. Honsho M. Fullekrug J. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4912-4917Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Subconfluent MDCK strain II cells were trypsinized, and 5 × 105 cells in 3 ml of complete EMEM (5% FCS) supplemented with 4 μg/ml of hexadimethrine bromide (Polybrene; Sigma) were seeded onto a 3.5-cm diameter culture dish (Corning Costar). The following day, medium was aspirated, and 1 ml of virus-containing precleared supernatant from Phoenix cells was added. Hexadimethrine bromide (4 μg/ml) was added to virus preparations. One hour later, 1 ml of fresh complete EMEM (5% FCS) was added, and the incubation was continued for 8–12 h. Infection was repeated 1–2 times before cells were trypsinized and reseeded in EMEM containing 4 μg/ml puromycin (BD Biosciences). Maximum knockdown efficiencies were obtained after 2–3 days of puromycin selection, and the KD cells were used for up to 2 weeks without a significant drop in knockdown efficiency. Knockdown efficiency was analyzed by RT-PCR as described previously (18Schuck S. Manninen A. Honsho M. Fullekrug J. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Filters were incubated for 45 min in serum-free medium containing β1-integrin (AIIB2; 1:10) or α6-integrin (1:100) antibodies on both apical and basolateral sides. Cells were washed twice with EMEM and twice with PBS containing 0.9 mm Ca2+ and 0.5 mm Mg2+ (PBS+), followed by MeOH fixation. For intracellular and extracellular staining of integrins, cells on filters were washed once with PBS and fixed with MeOH prior to the addition of primary antibodies. Filters were cut out of their supports and washed in PBS-. Nonspecific binding was blocked in PBS- containing 0.1% fish skin gelatin (Sigma) and 0.5% BSA (Sigma) for 30 min. Filter pieces were incubated with secondary antibodies (1:500 in blocking solution) containing DAPI (0.6 μm; Sigma) for 45 min, washed extensively in PBS-, and mounted onto slides with Mowiol™.MDCK cysts in three-dimensional gels were washed with PBS+ and incubated for 20 min in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma). After a PBS wash, residual aldehyde was quenched for 20 min in PBS- containing 200 mm glycine (Sigma). Cells were permeabilized for 20 min in PBS- with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma), incubated in blocking solution for 30 min. Primary antibodies (1:200 anti-Myc and anti-Pcx, 1:400 anti-galectin-3; dilutions in blocking solution) were added and incubated overnight at 4 °C, washed extensively in PBS followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with 1:500 dilutions of fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies. When indicated, DAPI and TRITC-phalloidin (0.1 μm; Sigma) were added with the secondary antibodies. Gels were washed in PBS, removed from the plates, and mounted onto slides with Mowiol™. Images were acquired with an OLYMPUS FluoView-1000 (Olympus; using a 60× PlanApo oil objective, numerical aperture 1.1) laser-scanning confocal microscope.Galectin-9 Secretion—MDCK-Gal9myc cells grown for 3–4 days on 12-mm Transwell filters were washed twice with starvation medium (EMEM lacking methionine and cysteine (PAA Laboratories), containing l-glutamine and antibiotics) before a 15-min incubation in starvation medium at 37 °C. Cells were labeled by placing the filter onto a 20-μl drop of labeling medium (starvation medium containing 30 μCi of [35S]methionine) for 20 min. Filters were washed twice with chase medium (complete EMEM containing 5% FCS and 150 μg/ml unlabeled methionine) prior to incubation in chase medium at 37 °C. Apical and basolateral medium and cells were harvested at the indicated times. Galectin-9 was immunoprecipitated using an anti-Myc antibody (9E10) and Protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma). Precipitated proteins were separated and visualized by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.Standard Cell Adhesion Assay—Cell adhesion was determined as described previously (19Matlin K.S. Haus B. Zuk A. Methods. 2003; 30: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, subconfluent MDCK cells were detached in PBS- containing 2 mm EDTA and 0.5 mm EGTA at 37 °C. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in serum-free medium at 2 × 106 cells/ml. Fifty microliters of cell suspension was pipetted into 96-well plate wells coated with laminin-111 (20Aumailley M.

When indicated, cells were resuspended and incubated in ice-cold serum-free medium containing 50 mm d-lactose (Sigma), 100 μg/ml RGD peptide (Sigma), or a 1:10 dilution of AIIB2 for 30 min prior to plating. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 90 min followed by four washes with PBS+ to remove nonadherent cells. Adherent cells were fixed in methanol, stained with crystal violet (0.1% w/v; Sigma), lysed in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, and quantified using a spectrophotometer (absorbance at 540 nm from which the background at 405 nm was subtracted).Single Cell Force Spectroscopy Instrumentation—Force spectroscopy was conducted using a NanoWizard (JPK Instruments), mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M microscope (Carl Zeiss). The NanoWizard atomic force microscope (AFM) was equipped with the CellHesion module (JPK Instruments) that extended the vertical movement range to 100 μm. A BioCell stage incubator (JPK Instruments) allowed measurements to be conducted at 37 °C. Cantilevers used were 200-μm-long V-shaped silicium nitride tipless cantilevers with nominal spring constants of 0.06 N/m (NP-0, Veeco). Cantilever spring constants were calibrated prior to use by routines included in the AFM software (21Hutter J.L. Bechhoefer J. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1993; 64: 1868-1873Crossref Scopus (3364) Google Scholar).Surface Coating of AFM Cantilever and Coverslips—Cantilevers were cleaned in 2% Hellmanex (Hellma GmbH), residual air plasma-cleaned for 1 min and incubated at 4 °C in 2 mg/ml concavalin A (from Canavalia ensiformis; Sigma) in PBS overnight. Before use, cantilevers were extensively washed in PBS.Glass coverslips (Ø24 mm) were cleaned by sequential washes in 1m HCl, water, and EtOH and air-dried. Thereafter, coverslips were incubated with 5 μg/ml laminin-111 in PBS for 2 h at 37 °C. For collagen coating, mica discs (Ø6.5 mm) were glued (OP-29; Dymax Europe GmbH) onto the center of glass coverslips (Ø24 mm). Then solubilized bovine dermal collagen (3 mg/ml; Cohesion) was diluted to 30 μg/ml in coating buffer (200 mm KCl, 50 mm glycine, pH 9.2) and was then added to the freshly cleaved mica discs and incubated overnight at room temperature (22Jiang F. Khairy K. Poole K. Howard J. Muller D.J. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2004; 64: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Prior to use, unbound protein was removed by washing, first with PBS then with fresh measurement medium (see below).Cell Capture, Force Measurement, and Data Processing—Approximately 12 h prior to adhesion experiments, the MDCK cell growth medium was replaced by CO2-independent medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with l-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% FCS. Prior to measurements, cells were washed once with PBS-, trypsinized, pelleted, and resuspended into serum-free CO2-independent medium (measurement medium) and allowed to recover for 15 min. When indicated, medium was supplemented with 50 mm lactose or 5 mm EDTA. Integrin-blocking antibodies (1:10 dilution of the hybridoma supernatant) and RGD peptides (100 μg/ml) were incubated together with cells on ice for 30 min prior to analysis.Thereafter, cell suspensions were pipetted into the BioCell containing a coated coverslip and allowed to settle for 5 min. The apex of a calibrated concanavalin A-coated cantilever was positioned above a cell before it was lowered (speed, 5 μm/s) until an absolute force of 0.75 nN was applied to the cells. After 5 s, the cantilever-bound cells were retracted (50 μm) and allowed to adhere for at least 5 min. For force curve measurements, the approach and retract rates were set to 5 μm/s, and the contact force was set to 0.75 nN. Depending on the contact time (2–90 s), the pulling range was adjusted between 15 and 60 μm. For short contact times (2–20 s), 5–10 force curves were recorded with resting periods of 10 s between approach/retract cycles. Cells were allowed to recover for ∼5 min, before a new set of force curves was acquired. A maximum of 30 curves were acquired per cell. At 90 s contact time, force curves were recorded at 3-min intervals, never exceeding five force curves per cell. Loss of adhesion strength with force curve cycle was not observed.Detachment forces and step size and step number were extracted using in-house algorithms in Igor Pro 5.04 (Wavemetrics). InStat3 (GraphPad) was used to perform statistical tests on data sets.RESULTSExpression of Galectins in MDCK Cells—The relative expression levels of selected galectins, known to be expressed in the kidney (galectins 1, 3, 8, and 9) and/or containing tandem carbohydrate recognition domains (galectins 4, 6, 8, 9, and 12), were analyzed using quantitative real time PCR (Fig. 1A). Galectin-3 was expressed at very high levels. Galectin-9, -8, and -1 were relatively abundant, whereas only low levels of galectin-6 and -12 mRNAs were found. Galectin-4 mRNA was not detected. Hereafter, we limited our studies to galectin-3 and -9, the two most abundantly expressed galectins.Retroviral RNAi was employed to specifically and efficiently inhibit (>90%) the expression levels of galectin-3 or -9 mRNAs (Fig. 1B) (18Schuck S. Manninen A. Honsho M. Fullekrug J. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4912-4917Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). MDCK cells infected with retroviruses lacking a target sequence in their short hairpin RNA expression cassette were used as a control in all experiments. Protein levels in galectin-3 knockdown (Gal3-KD) and Gal9-KD cells were analyzed by Western blotting. Endogenous galectin-3 was detected using galectin-3 antibodies. Due to the lack of a suitable antibody against canine galectin-9, MDCK cells expressing Myc epitope-tagged canine galectin-9 (MDCK-Gal9myc) were generated by retroviral transduction. The efficiency of the Gal9-KD construct at protein level was analyzed in MDCK-Gal9myc cells using antibodies against the Myc epitope. The observed reduction (∼90%) in galectin-3 and -9 protein levels in KD cells correlated well with the reduction seen in mRNA levels (Fig. 1B).Galectin-3 and -9 Contribute to Cell Adhesion—To assess the role of the two galectins in epithelial long term adhesion, tissue culture plates were coated with laminin-111, the major component of the basement membranes; Matrigel™ (23Grant D.S. Kleinman H.K. Leblond C.P. Inoue S. Chung A.E. Martin G.R. Am. J. Anat. 1985; 174: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), a solubilized basement membrane-like matrix; or collagen I. Single cell suspensions were seeded onto the coated plates and allowed to adhere for 90 min before nonadhering cells were washed off. When integrin-mediated adhesion was blocked by chelating free calcium and magnesium, cells did not adhere to any of the coatings, demonstrating the involvement of integrins in cell adhesion in this assay (data not shown). Preincubation of cells with competitive inhibitors of galectin sugar-binding activity, d-lactose or galactose, slightly reduced the adhesion, suggesting that carbohydrate-dependent interactions may play a role (Fig. 2A). The contribution of integrins was more specifically confirmed using function-blocking β1-integrin antibodies (AIIB2) and competitive inhibitory RGD peptides. Although β1-integrins were found to be essential for adhesion to all of the matrices studied, RGD peptide, an inhibitor of integrin receptors for fibronectin matrix (19Matlin K.S. Haus B. Zuk A. Methods. 2003; 30: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), did not affect adhesion (Fig. 2A). The specific roles of galectin-3 and -9 were addressed by studying the adhesion of galectin-depleted cells. Compared with control cells, both Gal3- and Gal9-KD cells adhered less efficiently to laminin-111, collagen I (Fig. 2B), and Matrigel™ (Fig. S1).FIGURE 2Galectin-3 and galectin-9 contribute to cellular adhesion. A, single cell suspensions of MDCK cells were allowed to settle for 90 min on laminin-111-, Matrigel™-, or collagen I-coated tissue culture wells. When indicated, cell suspensions were incubated for 30 min on ice in medium supplemented with 50 mm d-lactose, 50 mm d-galactose, a 1:10 dilution of β1-integrin function blocking antibody, or 100 μg/ml RGD-peptide prior to plating. Nonadherent cells were washed away, and remaining adherent cells were fixed, stained, and quantified (n = 3). Adhesion of untreated cells to each coating was set to 100%, and adhesion of treated cells is shown relative to this. B, adhesion of control, Gal3-KD, and Gal9-KD MDCK cells on BSA-, poly-d-lysine-, laminin-111-, or collagen I-coated plates was assayed as described in A (n = 5). BSA and poly-d-lysine coatings served as a negative and positive control, respectively. C, adhesion of control, Gal3-KD, and Gal9-KD cells to laminin-111 (left) and collagen I (right) in the absence and the presence of 50 mm lactose (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The possibility of RNAi off target effects (24Jackson A.L. Bartz S.R. Schelter J. Kobayashi S.V. Burchard J. Mao M. Li B. Cavet G. Linsley P.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 635-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar) was examined. To this end, galectin-3 expression was rescued by transiently transfecting Gal3-KD cells with a hamster galectin-3-encoding expression vector. This galectin-3 ortholog differs from the canine galectin-3 at the RNAi target region, making it resistant to silencing by the short hairpin RNA with the canine sequence. Hamster galectin-3 expression in Gal3-KD MDCK cells led to a robust increase in adhesion, indicating that the observed adhesion defect in Gal3-KD cells was specifically due to lack of galectin-3 expression (Fig. S1A). With galectin-9, we used an alternative approach to confirm the specificity. A second target sequence (nucleotides 867–887) for canine galectin-9 from a different region of the galectin-9 mRNA was selected. This retroviral Gal9-KD2-construct resulted in efficient depletion of galectin-9 mRNA (90 ± 3% as measured by quantitative real time PCR) and protein levels (data not shown) in MDCK cells. Furthermore, we found that adhesion to Matrigel™ was reduced to a similar extent in both Gal9-KD cell populations (Fig. S1B). The probability that the two distinct RNAi targets in the galectin-9 sequence would lead to same off-target effects is negligible. Thus, we concluded that the effects of galectin-3 and -9 depletion on adhesion were specific.Interestingly, the already reduced adhesion of cells by 50 mm lactose was further reduced in Gal3- and Gal9-KD cells (Fig. 2C). This suggests that the galectins have functions that are not mediated by their sugar-binding domain at the cell surface. These could be indirect mechanisms, such as regulating integrin function or localization. In conclusion, the long term stable adhesion to laminin and collagen was β1-integrin-dependent, but both galectin-3 and -9 were required for maximal adhesion efficiency.To get a more quantitative insight into the early cell-substrate adhesion events, SCFS was applied (25Puech P.H. Taubenberger A. Ulrich F. Krieg M. Muller D.J. Heisenberg C.P. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4199-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) (Fig. S2). In this approach, single cells were attached to a concavalin A-coated AFM cantilever and lowered onto laminin-111- or collagen I-coated substrates. Upon retraction, the maximum detachment force was determined. Surprisingly, in contrast to long term cell adhesion, early adhesion to laminin-111 was found to be integrin-independent, since chelation of divalent ions by EDTA or the addition of β1-integrin function blocking antibodies had no significant effect (Fig. 3, B and C). Instead, carbohydrate-mediated interactions were important, as evidenced by the ability of lactose to inhibit cell adhesion to laminin-111 (Fig. 3B). The opposite was observed for early adhesion to collagen I, which was found to be entirely dependent on functional β1-integrin (Fig. 4, B and C). In both cases, RGD-binding integrins were dispensable for adhesion (Figs. 3C and 4C). In agreement with lactose insensitivity, adhesion to collagen I was not affected in Gal3- and Gal9-KD cells (Fig. 4A). On the contrary, a clear reduction was evident in the adhesion to laminin-111 of Gal3- and Gal9-KD cells, compared with control cells, suggesting that galectins, via their sugar-binding domains, play an important role in the early adhesion to laminin-111 (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3SCFS analysis of adhesion to laminin-111. A, single control (2 s, n = 53; 90 s, n = 21), Gal3-KD (2 s, n = 24; 90 s, n = 23), or Gal9-KD (2 s, n = 26; 90 s, n = 20) MDCK cells were captured onto concavalin A-coated AFM cantilevers and pressed onto laminin-111-coated substrates. After the indicated contact times, cells were lifted from the substrate, and the maximum detachment force was recorded as described under “Experimental Procedures.” ns, no significance (p > 0.05); *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.001. B, the maximum detachment force between MDCK cells and laminin-111 was measured in the absence and presence of 50 mm lactose or 5 mm EDTA. At least 20 cells were analyzed for each condition. C, the maximum detachment force between MDCK cells and laminin-111 was measured in the absence and presence of β1-integrin function blocking antibody (AIIB2; diluted 1:10) or 100 μg/ml RGD peptide. At least 15 cells were analyzed for each condition.View Large"

By employing gene targeting, we have recently described a nonredundant and essential role of TACC3 in regulating cell proliferation. In this study, we used an inducible RNA interference approach to characterize the molecular function of TACC3 and its role in mitotic progression and cell survival. Our data demonstrate that a TACC3 knockdown arrests G1 checkpoint-compromised HeLa cells prior to anaphase with aberrant spindle morphology and severely misaligned chromosomes. Interestingly, TACC3-depleted cells fail to accumulate the mitotic kinase Aurora B and the checkpoint protein BubR1 to normal levels at kinetochores. Moreover, localization of the structural protein Ndc80 at outer kinetochores is reduced, indicating a defective kinetochore-microtubule attachment in TACC3-deficient cells. As a consequence of prolonged TACC3 depletion, cells undergo caspase-dependent cell death that relies on a spindle checkpoint-dependent mitotic arrest. TACC3 knockdown cells that escape from this arrest by mitotic slippage become highly polyploid and accumulate supernumerary centrosomes. Similarly, deficiency of the post-mitotic cell cycle inhibitor p21WAF exacerbates the effects of TACC3 depletion. Our findings therefore point to an essential role of TACC3 in spindle assembly and cellular survival and identify TACC3 as a potential therapeutic target in cancer cells.

The centrosome organizes the bipolar mitotic spindle to ensure faithful separation of chromosomes during mitosis (1Nigg E.A. Int. J. Cancer. 2006; 119: 2717-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Spindle poles, kinetochores, and various microtubule-associated proteins are involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics (2Compton D.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 95-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The assembly of the mitotic spindle is a highly dynamic process and tightly controlled by the cell cycle. On the other hand, alterations in centrosome and mitotic spindle architecture have profound consequences for cell cycle progression and lead to chromosomal instability, aneuploidy, and cell death (1Nigg E.A.

TACC proteins are evolutionarily conserved and share a 200-amino acid coiled coil motif at their C terminus but have only limited homology outside this domain (8Still I.H. Vettaikkorumakankauv A.K. DiMatteo A. Liang P. BMC Evol. Biol. 2004; 4: 16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TACC proteins interact with the microtubule-stabilizing protein ch-TOG/Msps/XMAP215 (9Lee M.J. Gergely F. Jeffers K. Peak-Chew S.Y. Raff J.W. Nat.

Although there is only one TACC gene in Drosophila and Xenopus, the mammalian TACC family consists of three genes. Interestingly, in humans all TACC homologues map closely to chromosomal translocation breakpoints that are associated with certain cancers, including mammary tumors and multiple myeloma (14Still I.H. Hamilton M. Vince P. Wolfman A. Cowell J.K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4032-4038Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 15Still I.H. Vince P. Cowell J.K.

Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In contrast, the putative role of TACC2 as a tumor suppressor (17Chen H.M. Schmeichel K.L. Mian I.S. Lelievre S. Petersen O.W. Bissell M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1357-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) could not be confirmed so far, because TACC2-deficient mice show neither increased tumor formation nor signs of genomic instability nor any other obvious phenotype (18Schuendeln M.M. Piekorz R.P. Wichmann C. Lee Y. McKinnon P.J. Boyd K. Takahashi Y. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6403-6409Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Finally, several recent reports link TACC3, the third member of the mammalian TACC family, to human cancer. This includes its identification as a novel prognostic marker in non-small cell lung cancer (19Jung C.K. Jung J.H. Park G.S. Lee A. Kang C.S. Lee K.Y. Pathol. Int. 2006; 56: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and the association of TACC3 aberrations with ovarian cancer (20Lauffart B. Vaughan M.M. Eddy R. Chervinsky D. DiCioccio R.A. Black J.D. Still I.H. BMC Womens Health. 2005; 5: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We have knocked out the TACC3 gene in mice resulting in embryonic lethality at mid to late gestation (21Piekorz R.P. Hoffmeyer A. Duntsch C.D. McKay C. Nakajima H. Sexl V. Snyder L. Rehg J. Ihle J.N. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). TACC3-deficient mice showed chromosomal instability, greatly reduced cell numbers, and widespread apoptotic cell death. In particular, we found that TACC3 is required for progenitor cell expansion and hematopoiesis, suggesting an essential and nonredundant role of TACC3 for embryonic development especially in highly proliferating cells. The critical and gene dosage-dependent function of TACC3 in development is further underlined by the impaired chondrocyte differentiation and skeletal malformations in homozygous mutant mice carrying a hypomorphic TACC3 allele (22Yao R. Natsume Y. Noda T. Cancer Sci. 2007; 98: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Moreover, in the absence of TACC3, murine NIH3T3 fibroblasts enter a G1 and G2 cell cycle arrest (23Schneider L. Essmann F. Kletke A. Rio P. Hanenberg H. Schulze-Osthoff K. Nurnberg B. Piekorz R.P. Oncogene. 2007; 10.1038/sj.onc1210628Google Scholar). The impaired proliferation and increased apoptosis in the absence of TACC3 presumably results from improper kinetochore attachment and chromosome alignment. In the presence of unattached chromosomes cells activate the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) to prevent aneuploidy. During metaphase, the SAC senses misaligned chromosomes and stabilizes cyclin B, whose degradation by the anaphase-promoting complex is necessary for mitotic progression (24Clute P. Pines J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 25Pines J. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 55-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Essential components of the SAC are Mad2 and BubR1, whose initial localization to kinetochores is dependent on the chromosomal passenger complex protein Aurora B (26Vigneron S. Prieto S. Bernis C. Labbe J.C. Castro A. Lorca T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4584-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 27Ditchfield C. Johnson V.L. Tighe A. Ellston R. Haworth C. Johnson T. Mortlock A. Keen N. Taylor S.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 267-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). Although activation of the SAC arrests cells in metaphase by preventing the anaphase transition, like all checkpoints the SAC does not arrest cells permanently. Cells rather gradually degrade cyclin B1 and escape from this block by mitotic slippage and potentially exit mitosis without cytokinesis (28Brito D.A. Rieder C.L. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1194-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 29Weaver B.A. Cleveland D.W. Cancer Cell. 2005; 8: 7-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). These cells will then arrest in a tetraploid G1-like state through a post-mitotic checkpoint, which is p53- and p21WAF-dependent (30Blagosklonny M.V. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 971-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 31Giannakakou P. Robey R. Fojo T. Blagosklonny M.V. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3806-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 32Margolis R.L. Lohez O.D. Andreassen P.R. J. Cell Biochem. 2003; 88: 673-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), or through an additional checkpoint in the next G2 phase (33Vogel C. Kienitz A. Hofmann I. Muller R. Bastians H. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 6845-6853Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). It is well established that activation of p53 results not only in p21WAF-dependent cell cycle arrest but also in apoptosis, depending on the cellular context and stress stimulus (34Weber J.D. Zambetti G.P. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the embryonic lethality caused by TACC3 deficiency was partially rescued in mice with a complete loss or reduced levels of p53 (21Piekorz R.P. Hoffmeyer A. Duntsch C.D. McKay C. Nakajima H. Sexl V. Snyder L. Rehg J. Ihle J.N. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This observation indicates that TACC3 deficiency leads to cellular defects that are sensed post-mitotically by the p53/p21WAF-dependent pathway. In contrast, cell death that directly originates from mitosis is presumably p53-independent and mediated through caspase-dependent pathways (35Castedo M. Perfettini J.L. Roumier T. Andreau K. Medema R. Kroemer G. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2825-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). It is unknown to what extent mitotic cell death contributes to the phenotype observed upon TACC3 deficiency. Unlike in TACC3-deficient cells from gene-targeted mice, it was previously shown that down-regulation of TACC3 in HeLa cells using a transient oligonucleotide-based RNAi approach did not result in dramatic damage of mitotic spindles during the first round of cell division, where cells performed a relatively normal although delayed mitosis (10Gergely F. Draviam V.M. Raff J.W. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 336-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In that study, TACC3-knockdown cells revealed mostly well organized spindles with only partial defects in microtubule stability and chromosome attachment. In contrast, depletion of ch-TOG, the binding partner of TACC3, had much stronger effects and resulted in increased multinucleation, disorganized spindles, and multipolar spindle formation, indicating that ch-TOG but not TACC3 plays a major role in spindle pole organization. Down-regulation of neither TACC3 nor ch-TOG, however, was reported to induce cell death (10Gergely F. Draviam V.M. Raff J.W. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 336-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In this study, we used a stable drug-controllable RNA interference approach to elucidate the cellular effects of a persistent TACC3 gene silencing. Our results clearly demonstrate that long term TACC3 depletion disturbs chromosomal alignment and a proper spindle and kinetochore architecture. We also demonstrate that an impaired post-mitotic G1 checkpoint that often occurs in tumor cells strongly accelerates mitotic defects and results in increased apoptotic cell death. Thus, our data indicate an essential role of TACC3 in spindle assembly and mitotic cell survival. Cloning of Lentiviral Constructs for Conditional Gene Suppression of TACC3—The original lentiviral vectors for siRNA expression (pLVTH) and the method for generation of tTR-KRAB transrepressor-positive target cells lines (pLV-tTRKRAB-dsRed) have been published (36Wiznerowicz M. Trono D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 8957-8961Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Several siRNA sequences of 19 nucleotides targeting human TACC3 were selected by a siRNA prediction software (Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Boston). Complementary synthetic short hairpin RNA oligonucleotides consisting of sense-loop-antisense sequences (Operon, Cologne, Germany) were cloned into the pLVTH vector downstream of the H1 promoter (36Wiznerowicz M. Trono D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 8957-8961Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). The cDNAs and RNAi sequences used are indicated in the supplemental Table 1S. Cell Culture, Lentiviral Transductions, and Isolation of Stably Transduced Subclones—293T and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. HCT116 cell lines were cultured under the same conditions using McCoy's medium (Genaxxon, Biberach, Germany). Recombinant lenti-viruses were produced, and target cells were transduced essentially as described (37Leurs C. Jansen M. Pollok K.E. Heinkelein M. Schmidt M. Wissler M. Lindemann D. Von Kalle C. Rethwilm A. Williams D.A. Hanenberg H. Hum. Gene Ther. 2003; 14: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In brief, lentiviruses were generated by transient transfection of 293T cells plated at a density of 4.5 × 106 cells per 10-cm dish. The following day, cells were co-transfected with 10 μg each of lentivector pLVTH, pCMV-dR8.74psPAX2, and pCR-VSVG using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Lentivirus production was enhanced by the addition of 10 mm sodium butyrate to the culture medium for 6 h. Virus-containing supernatants were supplied 24 h later with 7 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma) and directly used to transduce target cells at a density of 3.5 × 104 cells per 3.5-cm plate for a period of 24 h. Puromycin-selected HeLa cell lines stably expressing the tTR-KRAB transrepressor were used to generate lines expressing the different siRNAs upon treatment with doxycycline (DOX, 5 μg/ml; MP Biomedicals, Eschwege, Germany). These cell lines were further subcloned by single cell cloning, and for each siRNA various subclones were analyzed throughout this study. Cell Synchronization—For arresting cells in prometaphase, cells were seeded at a density of 8 × 103/cm2 and kept continuously under DOX treatment. Two days later cells were exposed to 100 nm nocodazole for 16 h. Mitotic cells were harvested by mechanical shake off. Cells were then washed three times with PBS, released into nocodazole-free medium, and analyzed at given time points. When stated, cells were supplied upon release with 20 μm of the pan-caspase inhibitor N-(2-quinolyl)valyl-aspartyl-(2,6-difluorophenoxy)-methyl-ketone (Q-VD-OPH; MP Biomedicals). Flow Cytometry—Cell cycle analysis was performed on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) using CellQuest software. For determination of cell cycle distribution, cells were stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml in 0.1% sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100) and treated with 40 μg/ml RNase on ice. DNA content and the percentage of cells in different cell cycle phases (G1/S/G2M) were quantified in a linear mode (FL2-A) using winMDI software. The percentage of cells undergoing apoptotic DNA fragmentation (DNA content < 2N, sub-G1) or polyploidization (DNA content > 4N) was determined in a logarithmic mode (FL3-H). Alternatively, apoptosis was assessed with the apoptosis detection kit I (BD Biosciences) using phycoerythrin-coupled annexin V and 7-aminoactinomycin D. For cyclin B1 staining, cells were fixed in 70% ethanol for 1 h on ice. Thereafter, cells were incubated with anti-cyclin B1 (1:50; Ab3; Labvision, Freemont, CA) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:40; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). DNA was counterstained with propidium iodide (20 μg/ml in 0.5% bovine serum albumin/PBS containing 40 μg/ml RNase). Cyclin B1-positive cells were assessed in a logarithmic mode (FL1-H). Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy—HeLa cells were seeded at densities of 8 × 103 cells/cm2 on coverslips and grown in media containing 5 μg/ml DOX. For the analysis of microtubule stability after cold treatment, cells were placed at 4 °C for 2 h and re-transferred to 37 °C for 25 min (10Gergely F. Draviam V.M. Raff J.W. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 336-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). After the indicated time, cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol/acetone (1:1) for 20 min at –20 °C and subsequently incubated in IF buffer (4% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% saponin in PBS) for 1 h. Cells were stained in IF buffer with the following primary antibodies at the indicated dilutions: anti-α-tubulin (DM1a, 1:500, Sigma, or YOL1/34, Acris Antibodies, Hiddenhausen, Germany); anti-TACC3 (H300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-γ-tubulin (GTU-88, 1:100, Sigma); anti-pericentrin and anti-Ndc80 (9G3, 1:500, Abcam, Cambridge, UK); anti-centromere serum (CREST serum, 1:500, Immunovision, Springdale, AR); anti-cyclin B1 (H-433, 1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany); anti-phosphohistone 3 (Ser-10; 1:100; Beckman Coulter, Krefeld, Germany); anti-Aurora B (1:100; BD Biosciences); anti-BubR1 (1:1000; kindly provided by Stephen S. Taylor, University of Manchester, UK). Thereafter, cells were washed and labeled with secondary antibodies (Alexa488-, Alexa568-, Alexa594-, or Alexa633-coupled anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, anti-rat, or anti-human antibodies; Molecular Probes, 1:400). DNA was detected using 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1 μg/ml; Sigma). Analyses were performed with a Leica TCS SP2/AOBS microscope equipped with a HCX PL APO ×63 immersion objective and excitation wavelengths of 405, 488, 594, and 633 nm. Confocal pictures shown in Figs. 3 and 4 and in supplemental Figs. 3S and 4S are projections of recorded z-stacks of various dimensions. Alternatively, cells were analyzed on an LSM510-Meta confocal microscope (Zeiss) equipped with ×40/1.3 or ×63/1.4 immersion objectives and excitation wavelengths of 364, 488, 543, and 633 nm. Confocal pictures shown in Fig. 1 and the supplemental Fig. 4C are single optical slices of 0.9–1.3 μm thickness. For live cell imaging analysis, cells were grown in CO2-independent medium (Invitrogen) and maintained in a heating chamber at 37 °C. Images were collected at a single focal plane at 3-min intervals on an LSM510-Meta confocal microscope with a ×40/1.3 immersion objective.FIGURE 4Reduced mitotic localization of structural and checkpoint proteins at kinetochores of TACC3-depleted HeLa cells.

First strand cDNAs were generated from 2 μg of RNA in a total volume of 20 μl by oligo(dT) priming using Omniscript reverse transcriptase (Qiagen). Primer sets and PCR conditions used to amplify fragments of individual human TACC isoforms have been published previously for TACC1 (38Conte N. Charafe-Jauffret E. Delaval B. Adelaide J. Ginestier C.

Immunoblotting—Total cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA. Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond C, GE Healthcare). Blots were probed with the following primary antibodies at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml or according to the manufacturer's instructions: anti-β-actin (C4; MP Biomedicals), anti-TACC3 (H300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-caspase 3 (R & D Systems, Bad Nauheim, Germany), anti-PARP (Ab3; Labvision); anti-Ndc80, anti-Aurora B (BD Biosciences), and anti-BubR1. Specific signals were visualized with the ECL detection system (GE Healthcare) following incubation with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (Cell Systems, St. Katharinen, Germany). Statistical Analysis—To evaluate statistical significance, we have performed Student's t tests. Results are given as means ± S.D. p values below 0.05 were considered significant. Efficient Down-regulation of Endogenous TACC3 Expression Using Drug-inducible Production of siRNAs—Recent studies indicate an important function of TACC3 in mouse development and centrosome-dependent microtubule assembly (21Piekorz R.P.

To further study the cellular role of TACC3, we developed a controllable siRNA-based method for the down-regulation of TACC3 expression. We took advantage of a lentivirus-based transduction system followed by stable siRNA expression under the control of the doxycycline (DOX)-responsive tTR-KRAB transrepressor (36Wiznerowicz M. Trono D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 8957-8961Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 1S, A). In HeLa cells stably transduced with tTR-KRAB, expression of a siRNA directed against TACC3 (siRNA2h) led to an almost complete depletion of TACC3 protein levels by day 2 of continuous DOX treatment (Fig. 1A). In contrast, TACC3 protein levels did not change in cells transduced with a nonfunctional TACC3 siRNA (siRNA2m) that was used as a control throughout this study. Importantly, there was no significant influence of any of the siRNAs on the mRNA expression of the other two mammalian TACC family members, TACC1 and TACC2 (supplemental Fig. 1S, B). Thus, we established an effective lentivirus-based method permitting the specific and conditional down-regulation of TACC3 expression. HeLa Cells Progressively Arrest Prior to Anaphase upon Prolonged TACC3 Depletion—Genetic inactivation of the mitotically expressed TACC3 gene in mice leads to embryonic lethality, hypocellularity, and cellular apoptosis (21Piekorz R.P.

In this report we quantify the import-export balance in the vacuole because of the import of iron by Ccc1p and to export by the combined activity of Smf3p and the ferroxidase, permease pair of proteins, Fet5p and Fth1p. Our data indicate that the two efflux pathways are equally efficient in trafficking iron out of the vacuole. A major focus of this work was to identify the ferrireductase(s) that supplies the FeII for efflux whether by Smf3p or the Fet5p-Fth1p complex. Using a combination of flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometry to quantify vacuolar and whole cell iron content and a reporter assay for cytoplasmic iron we demonstrate that Fre6p supplies FeII to both efflux systems, while Fre7p plays no role in Fe-efflux from the vacuole. Enzymatic assay shows the two fusions to have similar reductase activity, however. Confocal fluorescence microscopy demonstrates that Fre6:GFP localizes to the vacuolar membrane; in contrast, Fre7:GFP fusions exhibit a variable and diffuse cellular distribution.

Demonstrating a role for a vacuolar metalloreductase in Fe-efflux supports the model that iron is stored in the vacuole in the ferric state. Across all superkingdoms, transition metal ion homeostasis is strongly dependent on the regulation of nutrient accumulation rather than on excess nutrient excretion (1Finney L.A. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 2003; 300: 931-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar, 2Aisen P. Enns C. Wessling-Resnick M. Int. J. Biochem.

Chem. 2003; 8: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Metal ion storage appears to be a complement of this regulatory pattern, storage that is illustrated by ferritin, the metallothioneins, and compartmentalization into cell organelles such as the mitochondria and vacuole. Although in some cases, this storage provides a detoxification mechanism (e.g. of heavy metals by the thioneins), it is as likely to play a dynamic role in cell and/or organismal metal ion homeostasis. This is certainly the case with ferritin in regards to vertebrate cell iron handling (2Aisen P. Enns C. Wessling-Resnick M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 940-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar), and is very likely to be the case with the vacuoles found in the cells of many diverse eukaryotic genera; the vacuole in fungi and plants is a dynamic organelle that plays a significant role in the overall nutritional status of the organism (3Curie C. Briat J.F. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2003; 54: 183-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 4De Freitas J. Wintz H. Kim J.H. Poynton H. Fox T. Vulpe C.

Vacuoles provide a storage depot for newly arrived nutrients as well as being the site of macromolecular degradation and nutrient recycling (6Kucharczyk R. Rytka J. Acta Biochim. Pol. 2001; 48: 1025-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 7Herman E.M. Larkins B.A. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 601-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In regards to metal metabolism the vacuoles in plants and fungi have been associated with the handling of copper, iron, manganese, and zinc, in addition to magnesium and calcium; the yeast vacuole is essential for the detoxification of several first row transition metals (8Ramsay L.M. Gadd G.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 152: 293-298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Szczypka M.S. Zhu Z. Silar P. Thiele D.J. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1423-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Iron metabolism in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has served as a paradigm for iron handling in many other fungi, plants and even humans (1Finney L.A. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 2003; 300: 931-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar, 4De Freitas J. Wintz H. Kim J.H. Poynton H. Fox T. Vulpe C.

Under normal nutrient conditions ([Fe]environmental ≤ 1 μm) iron uptake is mediated by the high affinity iron uptake complex consisting of the multicopper ferroxidase Fet3p and iron permease Ftr1p. Homologous iron uptake complexes are likely to be found in most fungi and plants (10Kaplan J. Cell. 2002; 111: 603-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 11Kosman D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1185-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 12Hell R. Stephan U.W. Planta. 2003; 216: 541-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Uptake by yeast of environmental FeIII is preceded by ferric iron reduction to FeII by plasma membrane reductase activity supplied principally by Fre1p; reduction of environmental FeIII (and CuII) is paradigmatic of the uptake of these metal ions by all aerobic organisms (3Curie C. Briat J.F. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2003; 54: 183-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 11Kosman D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1185-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 13Andrews N.C. Fleming M.D. Gunshin H. Nutr. Rev. 1999; 57: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 14Schroder I. Johnson E. de Vries S. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 427-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Given the reduction potential of the cytoplasm, iron is undoubtedly present there as FeII; based on the GSH/GSSG ratio quantified in a wild-type yeast cell, this potential can be as low as -300 mV (15Muller E.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1805-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 16Grant C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 17Schafer F.Q. Buettner G.R. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1191-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (3676) Google Scholar). This is likely to be the case in the cytoplasm where a major fraction of this GSH/GSSG is localized; in contrast, because of the overall non-equilibrium distribution of GSH in the cell, the reduction potential for the endoplasmic reticulum has been estimated at around -200 mV (17Schafer F.Q. Buettner G.R. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1191-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (3676) Google Scholar). Also, the GSH/GSSG reduction potential is strongly pH-dependent: ΔE/ΔpH is +60 mV for a decrease in pH = 1.0 (17Schafer F.Q. Buettner G.R. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1191-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (3676) Google Scholar). Thus, relatively acidic compartments like endosomes and the vacuole will be oxidizing in comparison to the cytoplasm; the presence of iron in the yeast vacuole as a ferric (poly)phosphate is consistent with this electrochemical condition (18Raguzzi F. Lesuisee E. Crichton R.R. FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). One hallmark of iron metabolism in yeast is, therefore, redox cycling between FeIII (exocytoplasmic, vesicular) and FeII (substrate for uptake, cytoplasmic) (1Finney L.A. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 2003; 300: 931-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar, 6Kucharczyk R. Rytka J. Acta Biochim. Pol. 2001; 48: 1025-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 11Kosman D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1185-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). As noted, Fre1p supports this cycling at the plasma membrane where exocytoplasmic ferric iron needs to be reduced prior to ferroxidation and uptake by the Fet3p, Ftr1p complex. The FeII/FeIII ratio within the cell is likely determined by the overall reduction potential which, as noted, is strongly dependent on the [glutathione]total and pH. In addition, the GSH/GSSG ratio will be sensitive to the level of dioxygen; indeed, this ratio is a measure of cellular oxidative stress (17Schafer F.Q. Buettner G.R. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1191-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (3676) Google Scholar, 19Wheeler G.L. Grant C.M. Physiol. Plant. 2004; 120: 12-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The differential redox speciation of iron in the cytoplasm and vacuole provides the context for the mechanism of the cycling of iron between these two compartments. Some of the proteins involved in this cycling in S. cerevisiae have been identified. Ccc1p is localized to the vacuolar membrane and appears to function as a divalent metal ion transporter; Ccc1p has been associated with calcium, manganese, and iron homeostasis in yeast (20Lapinskas P.J. Lin S.J. Culotta V.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 21Li L. Chen O.S. McVey Ward D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29515-29519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 22Fu D. Beeler T. Dunn T. Yeast. 1994; 10: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Smf3p is a member of the Nramp divalent metal ion transporter family; Smf3p also exhibits relatively little selectivity among first row transition ions (23Nelson N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4361-4371Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 24Portnoy M.E. Liu X.F. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7893-7902Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Smf3p localizes to the vacuolar membrane (24Portnoy M.E. Liu X.F. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7893-7902Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Both transporters are thought to support vectorial iron flux with Ccc1p supporting import (21Li L. Chen O.S. McVey Ward D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29515-29519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) and Smf3p supporting export of iron from the vacuolar lumen (24Portnoy M.E. Liu X.F. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7893-7902Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) although neither activity has been directly demonstrated. A complex of Fet5p and Fth1p is likely to support export of vacuolar iron also; this complex is localized to the vacuolar membrane with an orientation that is identical to that of its homologues, Fet3p and Ftr1p (25Urbanowski J.L. Piper R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38061-38070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In other words, both complexes transport iron into the cytoplasmic compartment: Fet3p, Ftr1p from the exocytoplasmic space, and Fet5p, Fth1p from the vacuolar one. As is the case for Fet3p, Ftr1p permeation, the substrate for Fet5p, Fth1p transport is most reasonably FeII. However, as noted above, the valence state of vacuolar iron is likely FeIII. In parallel with plasma membrane iron import that starts with ferrireduction, so, too, does Fet5p, Fth1p export begin with the same reduction step. Of the seven yeast genes that encode reductase proteins, FRE6 is one of those up-regulated via the activity of the iron-responsive transcription factor, Aft1p (26Martins L.J. Jensen L.T. Simon J.R. Keller G.L. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23716-23721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Transcription from the CCC1, FET5, FTH1, and SMF3 loci is also activated under conditions of iron deprivation (27De Freitas J.M. Kim J.H. Poynton H. Su T. Wintz H. Fox T. Holman P. Loguinov A. Keles S. van der Laan M. Vulpe C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4450-4458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although the expression of the latter gene is under control of the paralogous Aft2p transcription factor (28Rutherford J.C. Jaron S. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27636-27643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), the fact that all five loci are members of what has been referred to as the iron or Aft regulon suggests that together they could be part of the iron trafficking pathway that links cytoplasmic and vacuolar iron metabolism. In this pathway, we propose that Fre6p supplies the luminal reductase activity required to mobilize FeII from vacuolar ferric (poly)phosphate stores. The data presented here support this proposition. Strain Construction—The yeast strains employed in this study were derived from DEY1457(MAT ade6 can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3) and are listed in Table 1. The fet5Δ strain was a kind gift from D. Eide. The smf3Δ strain was generated by using the HindIII-linearized smf3Δ::LEU2 plasmid pJS409, a kind gift from V. Culotta. Transformation of yeast with this linear plasmid resulted in deletion of the chromosomal SMF3 sequence from +116 to +1313, which was verified by PCR. The ccc1Δ strain was generated by using the SacI-digested ccc1Δ::HIS3 plasmid (also a kind gift from V. Culotta) to transform DEY1457. The fre6Δ strain was constructed by amplifying the KANMX4 sequence from the plasmid pFAKanMX4 (29Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar); primers were used that contained sequences from the 5′- and 3′-flanking regions from the FRE6 locus. The resulting PCR fragment was transformed into DEY1457. Genomic DNA was analyzed by PCR for the gene disruptions using a primer flanking the FRE6 ORF and a primer in the integrated KAN gene. The strains for quantification of FET3 promoter activity (for Aft1p activation) were generated by transforming DEY1457 and various deletion strains derived from it, with the ApaI-digested FET3:lacZ plasmid (kindly provided by A. Dancis), which was integrated at the URA3 locus.TABLE 1Strains constructed in this work1457Δfet5MATα ade6 can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 fet5::TRP11457Δccc1MATα ade6 can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 ccc1::LEU21457Δsmf3::LEU2 (L)MATα ade6 can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 smf3::LEU21457Δsmf3::HIS3 (H)MATα ade6 can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 smf3::HIS31457Δfre6MATα ade6 can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 fre6::KanMX41457Δfre7MATα ade6 can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 fre7::TRP11457Δfre6Δfre7MATα ade6 can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 fre6::KanMX4 fre7::TRP11457Δfet5-pFET3::lacZMATα ade6 can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 fet5::TRP1 pFET3::lacZ(URA3)1457Δccc1-pFET3::lacZMATα ade6 can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 ccc1::LEU2 pFET3::lacZ(URA3)1457Δsmf3L-pFET3::lacZMATα ade6 can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 smf3::LEU2 pFET3::lacZ(URA3)1457Δsmf3H-pFET3::lacZMATα ade6 can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 smf3::HIS3 pFET3::lacZ(URA3)1457Δfre6-pFET3::lacZMATα ade6 can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 fre6::KanMX4 pFET3::lacZ(URA3)1457Δfre7-pFET3::lacZMATα ade6 can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 fre7::TRP1 pFET3::lacZ(URA3)1457Δfre6Δfre7-pFET3::lacZMATα ade6 can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 fre6::KanMX4 fre7::TRP1 pFET3::lacZ(URA3) Open table in a new tab Growth Media—Stocks of yeast were maintained on standard yeast extract-peptone-dextrose media. The cultures for experimental analysis were grown in a synthetic minimal media (6.67 g/liter yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose, and appropriate mix of amino acids).

Plasmid Construction—The methionine promoter plasmids were constructed by amplifying the 450-bp MET3 promoter inserting ApaI/SalI sites and cloning this fragment into pRS423, pRS424, pRS425, and pR426 (30Sikorski R.S. Heiter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The open reading frames of SMF3, CCC1, FTH1, and FRE6 including 400 base pairs of 3′-UTR were amplified from yeast chromosomal DNA while the FET5 ORF and 3′-UTR was amplified from the YIp-FET5HA plasmid, a kind gift from D. Eide. These amplified genes were cloned into SalI/NotI sites in the MET3 promoter pRS series plasmids. The FRE6-GFP plasmid was constructed by amplifying FRE6 from chromosomal DNA and cloning it into the pMET3-424 plasmid at the SalI/NotI sites. The GFP ORF was inserted following amino acid residue 236 in the pMET3-FRE6 plasmid modified to include XbaI/AatII sites for this purpose. This placed the GFP in a loop predicted topologically to be in the cytoplasm. In the case of pMET3-FET7, the GFP ORF was inserted at four locations: in three predicted loop regions after residues 101, 150, and 227, respectively, and just prior to the FET7 termination codon to generate a C-terminal GFP fusion. Vacuole Isolation—Vacuoles were prepared from 600 ml of cells (OD660 ≅ 1-1.5) grown in SC media. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 1800 × g for 5 min, resuspended in 30 ml of 0.1 m Tris-SO4 (pH 9.3) and 10 mm dithiothreitol and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. The cells were washed once with spheroplasting buffer (1.2 m sorbitol, 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4) and incubated with 20 μg/ml lyticase for 45 min at 30 °C. Spheroplasts were collected by centrifugation at 3500 × g for 5 min and resuspended in 3.5 ml of 15% Ficoll buffer (15% Ficoll in 0.2 m sorbitol, 10 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 6.8). DEAE-Dextran (50 μg/ml) was added to the spheroplasts, and the sample incubated for 3 min on ice and for 5 min at 30 °C. The lysate (3.5 ml) was transferred to two SW41 tubes (Beckman Instruments) and overlaid sequentially with 3 ml of 8% Ficoll, 4 ml of 4% Ficoll, and 1 ml of buffer (0.2 m sorbitol, 10 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 6.8). The tubes were centrifuged at 110,000 × g for 90 min. The vacuolar fraction was collected from the 0-4% interface. Microscopic examination (see below) showed this fraction to contain >90% intact, sealed vacuoles with little contamination with other vesicular bodies or membrane fragments. The iron content of acid digested vacuoles was quantified by flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometry (fAAS) on a Perkin Elmer graphite furnace instrument. All analyses were performed in triplicate on samples from two independent experiments. The means ± S.D. indicated in the figures were calculated from these combined data. β-Galactosidase and INT Reductase Assays—Strains carrying the pFET3::lacZ reporter were grown in SC medium. Midlog phase cells (1 ml) were resuspended in 650 μl of Z buffer (0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4) containing 100 μl of Y-PER reagent (Pierce) and 2 μl of β-mercaptoethanol. The mixture was vortexed for 5 min at room temperature and 150 μl of ONPG (4 mg/ml) was added. The reaction was stopped by addition of 400 μl of 1 m Na2CO3. The reaction mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at high speed at 4 °C. The absorbance of the supernatants was read at 420 nm and β-galactosidase activity was calculated in Miller units (31Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar). Each condition was measured in triplicate using three separate cultures derived from separate transformants for each plasmid. The reductase activity of GFP-tagged fusions of Fre1p, Fre6p, or Fre7p in membrane fractions was determined as described by Shatwell et al. (32Shatwell K.P. Dancis A. Cross A.R. Klausner R.D. Segal A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14240-14244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). These proteins were expressed as above under pMET3 control in a fre1Δ strain. Transformants were grown in the presence of 10 μm copper and 100 μm iron to repress endogenous reductase expression. A membrane fraction was isolated using differential centrifugation. The membrane was solubilized in the presence of 1% Triton X-100 and 8 μg of total protein was incubated with 43 μm 2-(4-iodophenyl-3(4-nitrophenyl)-5-phenyltetrazo-lium chloride (INT), 180 units/ml superoxide dismutase, 333 nm FAD, and 160 μm NADPH in relaxation buffer (100 mm KCl, 3 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm PIPES, 1 mm ATP, pH 7.3) in a total volume of 0.35 ml. The absorbance was measured at 490 nm in a Bio-Rad microtiter plate reader. Duplicate assays were carried out in the absence of added FAD or added NADPH; the reductase activities quantified were dependent on FAD cofactor and NADPH substrate in all cases. Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—FM4-64, DCFDA, and concanavalin A-Alexa 633 were purchased from Molecular Probes. For FM4-64 labeling, the yeast cells were grown in SC media followed by incubation with a 30 μm final concentration of FM4-64 for 2 h. DCFDA labeling was used to confirm the integrity of the isolated vacuoles. For this, vacuoles were incubated with 10 μm reagent for 30 min and then washed prior to microscopic examination. For concanavalin A-Alexa 633 staining, the cells were grown in SC medium and incubated with 100 μm of stain for 1 h. The cells were then washed and resuspended in PBS. For double staining with FM4-64 and ConA-Alexa 633, the yeast cells were grown in SC medium to OD660 ≅ 0.4, 10 μm of FM4-64 was added to the growing cells and allowed to grow to OD ≅ 1.0. The cells were then collected and suspended in PBS with 100 μm ConA-Alexa 633 and incubated for 30 min. The unbound dyes were then removed by washing two times in PBS. For GFP fusions, the yeast cells were grown in SC media to a density of ∼2 × 107 cells/ml. The pellet from ∼1 ml cells was washed once with PBS and resuspended in 0.1 ml of PBS. The images were captured using a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal imaging system attached to a Nikon Optiphot microscope using a ×60 objective. Images were recorded by excitation at 488 nm using a krypton:argon source. Iron Accumulates in Fre6p-deficient Vacuoles—Vacuoles lacking the Fe-importer, Ccc1p, contain less iron in the steady state than wild type (21Li L. Chen O.S. McVey Ward D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29515-29519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In contrast, vacuoles lacking the Fe-exporter, Smf3p, more strongly sequester iron from the cytoplasm (24Portnoy M.E. Liu X.F. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7893-7902Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This pattern of vacuolar iron content is illustrated by the first three bars in Fig. 1. In addition, vacuoles lacking Fre6p accumulate even more iron in the steady state than vacuoles from the smf3Δ strain (Fig. 1, last bar). One interpretation of this difference is that Fre6p supplies FeII for both Smf3p and the alternative vacuolar Fe-export system comprised of the Fet5p ferroxidase and Fth1p iron permease (25Urbanowski J.L. Piper R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38061-38070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The steady-state relationship between import, ferrireduction and export was examined in more detail by use of the regulated overproduction of Ccc1p and Smf3p in wild type and fre6Δ cells. Using pMET3 as the promoter in the presence (repressing) and absence of methionine (activating), we examined the role of Fre6p in the balance between import and export of iron in the vacuole. Overproduction of Ccc1p in wild-type cells resulted in a 4-fold increase in steady-state vacuolar iron accumulation whereas overproduction of Smf3p alone reduced this iron accumulation by a factor of two (Fig. 2, open bars, compare with Fig. 1). Overproduction of Smf3p along with Ccc1p reduced by 50% the excess iron accumulation because of Ccc1p alone. In all cases, vacuolar Fe-accumulation in the fre6Δ strain was increased (Fig. 2, shaded bars); the most dramatic increases (>2-fold) were in cells overproducing Smf3p, which in Fre6p wild type had the effect of counteracting the accumulation because of Ccc1p. The data indicate Fre6p is upstream of Smf3p in the Fe-export pathway from the vacuole. As noted, the Fet5p, Fth1p ferroxidase-permease pair offers a second vacuolar Fe-efflux pathway. The role of Fre6p in this pathway was assessed in a similar fashion (Fig. 3). Although overproduction of Fet5p and Fth1p had little effect on iron accumulation in parental, wild-type cells (∼0.2 μg of Fe/mg protein, Figs. 1 and 3), it reduced by 50% the excess iron accumulation because of Ccc1p overproduction (Fig. 3, open bars). This reduction was absent in the fre6Δ strain indicating that Fre6p was upstream of Fet5p, Fth1p-mediated export as well (Fig. 3, shaded bars). Cytosolic Iron as a Monitor of the Vacuolar Iron Import-Export Cycle—The balance between cytosolic and compartmentalized iron in yeast has commonly been monitored by use of a reporter plasmid in which the lacZ gene is placed under control of the Fe-responsive Aft1p transcription factor (21Li L. Chen O.S. McVey Ward D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29515-29519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 24Portnoy M.E. Liu X.F. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7893-7902Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 25Urbanowski J.L. Piper R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38061-38070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). When cytosolic iron is (relatively) low, Aft1p traffics to the nucleus where it activates transcription of genes in the Aft1p regulon; in (relatively) high cytosolic Fe, Aft1p returns to the cytoplasm (33Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Ueta R. Fukunaka A. Sasaki R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18914-18918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Using this reporter, the dependence of vacuolar iron accumulation on the overproduction of Ccc1p and Smf3p in wild type and fre6Δ could be quantified. These data are shown in Fig. 4. In 4-h post-induction, wild-type cells overproducing Ccc1p exhibit an 8-fold increase in Aft1p activity; this increase is unaffected by the absence of Fre6p (Fig. 4 compare first two sets of open and shaded bars). This parallels the vacuolar iron data shown in Fig. 3. Co-production of Smf3p reduces by 40% the increase in Aft1p transcriptional activity because of vacuolar Fe-accumulation via Ccc1p consistent with the iron data shown in Fig. 3 (fourth open bar). Corresponding to the effect of the deletion of FRE6 on Smf3p-mediated Fe-efflux shown in Fig. 3, the ability of Smf3p to reverse the Aft1p activation due to the Fe-import supported by Ccc1p was absent in the fre6Δ strain (fourth shaded bar). A similar correspondence was observed between the reporter and vacuolar iron assays in regards to the over-expression of the Fet5p, Fth1p ferroxidase, permease Fe-exporter. This export complex reversed the depletion of cytoplasmic iron because of overexpression of Ccc1p in wild type, but this reversal was attenuated by ∼40% in the fre6Δ strain (last two sets of bars). These data support further the inference that Fre6p acts upstream of both of the two Fe-export systems in the yeast vacuolar membrane. Fre7p Does Not Support Vacuolar Fe-efflux—Fre7p differs from Fre6p in that is up-regulated by copper via the Cu-dependent transactivator, Mac1p. Also, Fre7p exhibits the least sequence homology to the other six yeast Fre reductases although it retains all of the sequence motifs involved in cofactor (heme) and substrate (pyridine nucleotide) binding (26Martins L.J. Jensen L.T. Simon J.R. Keller G.L. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23716-23721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, we compared the effect of FRE7 deletion to that because of FRE6 deletion using the Aft1p-reporter assay to determine if it played any role in vacuolar Fe-efflux. The results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 5 in which the lacZ reporter assay was conducted in a fre7Δ strain. Whereas deletion of FRE6 blocked Fe-efflux via Smf3p and the Fet5p, Fth1p ferroxidase, permease pathways (Figs. 2, 3, 4), deletion of FRE7 had no effect on Fe-export via either Smf3p or Fet5p, Fth1p (Fig. 5, compare all bars to open bars in Fig. 4).

Detailed analyses of β-arrestin interactions with both the receptor and β2-adaptin also allowed us to demonstrate that recruitment of β-arrestins to the receptor and the ensuing conformational changes are the leading events preceding AP-2 engagement and subsequent clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

In humans, it is estimated that GPCRs are encoded by ∼800 distinct genes that control a variety of important physiological responses (1Foord S.M. Bonner T.I. Neubig R.R. Rosser E.M. Pin J.P. Davenport A.P. Spedding M. Harmar A.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 2005; 57: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Following agonist binding, GPCRs undergo conformational changes that regulate the activity of downstream effector systems to mediate various cellular responses. The extent and duration of GPCR signaling is tightly regulated by mechanisms that terminate the initial signaling and later re-establish the capacity of the receptors to respond to new agonist exposure. The removal of GPCRs from the cell surface, also known as internalization or endocytosis, plays an important role in these processes (2Claing A. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 3Marchese A. Chen C. Kim Y.M. Benovic J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 369-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). For most GPCRs, rapid feedback desensitization is initiated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases that phosphorylate agonist-occupied GPCRs to create high affinity binding sites for β-arrestins, which in turn uncouple the receptor from its cognate G protein (reviewed in Ref. 4Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. Science. 2005; 308: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar). β-Arrestins also target receptors for endocytosis by linking them to the endocytic machinery, including clathrin and the clathrin adaptor AP-2 (5Edeling M.A. Mishra S.K.

By controlling receptor recycling following endocytosis, β-arrestins have also been shown to regulate the rate of receptor resensitization (12Prossnitz E.R. Life Sci. 2004; 75: 893-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Based on their interaction with β-arrestins, GPCRs are divided into two main classes. Class A, which includes receptors such as the β2-adrenergic (β2AR), endothelin A (ETAR), and V1a vasopressin (V1aR), interacts transiently with β-arrestins and can rapidly recycle back from the endosomes to the cell surface (13Oakley R.H.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1548-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Class B receptors, such as vasopressin V2 (V2R), CC-chemokine 5 (CCR5), prostaglandin EP4 (EP4R), and vasoactive intestinal peptide 1 (VIP1R), interact more stably with β-arrestins, leading to a complex that resides for extended periods of time into endosomes. Receptors tightly associated with β-arrestins in endosomes are only poorly recycled to the cell surface and eventually targeted for lysosomal degradation (13Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A.

The two classes of receptors also differ by their binding preference toward β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2. Indeed, whereas class A receptors binds with greater affinity to β-arrestin2, class B receptors do not show preference between the two β-arrestins (13Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17201-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). More recently, it was suggested that some receptors may not be easily classified in class A or B. For example, the bradykinin B2 receptor (B2R) was found to internalize with β-arrestins into endosomes but can then dissociate from β-arrestin and efficiently recycle to the plasma membrane after agonist removal (18Simaan M. Bedard-Goulet S. Fessart D. Gratton J.P. Laporte S.A. Cell Signal. 2005; 17: 1074-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The authors suggested that receptors with such hybrid features could be referred to as class C.Although the roles of β-arrestins and clathrin-coated vesicles in GPCR endocytosis have been well characterized, alternative pathways involving non-coated vesicles, such as caveolae, or other non-clathrin and non-caveolae mediated routes, have also been described for several receptors (reviewed in Refs. 2Claing A. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 3Marchese A. Chen C. Kim Y.M. Benovic J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 369-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 19Chini B. Parenti M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 32: 325-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Also, the requirement for β-arrestin does not seem to be universal, and endocytosis of some GPCRs through either clathrin-coated vesicles or caveolae was proposed to be β-arrestin-independent (20Okamoto Y. Ninomiya H. Miwa S. Masaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6439-6446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To characterize the various endocytic routes used by different receptors, several pharmacological and biochemical tools have been used. These include blockers that do not discriminate between clathrin-dependent or caveolae-mediated endocytosis (e.g. hypertonic sucrose, low temperature, concanavalin-A, and dominant negative mutants of dynamin) as well as inhibitors that are believed to selectively inhibit clathrin-coated vesicle (e.g. monodansylcadaverine, chlorpromazine, as well as dominant negative mutants of β-arrestin and Eps-15) or caveolae-mediated endocytosis (e.g. filpin and nystatin) (3Marchese A. Chen C. Kim Y.M. Benovic J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 369-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 19Chini B. Parenti M. J. Mol.

Although these approaches have been useful, the interpretation of their data was sometimes difficult and generated some controversies on the exact mechanism underlying the endocytosis of certain GPCRs. For example, inhibition of endocytosis by dominant negative mutants of β-arrestins (β-arrestin1(V53D), β-arrestin1-(319–418), and β-arrestin2(ΔLIELD/F391A) (7Kim Y.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30760-30768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 23Ferguson S.S. Downey W.E. Colapietro 3rd, A.M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G.

Chem. 1997; 272: 32507-32512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar)) or a dominant negative of the AP-2 interacting protein Eps15 (25Benmerah A. Bayrou M. Cerf-Bensussan N. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1303-1311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has often been used to suggest the involvement of a clathrin-mediated process. However, in the case of the ETAR, endocytosis through caveolae was also inhibited by a dominant negative mutant of β-arrestin (20Okamoto Y. Ninomiya H. Miwa S. Masaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6439-6446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Similarly, inhibiting Eps15 has been recently found to prevent caveolae-mediated endocytosis of the epidermal growth factor receptor (26Sigismund S. Woelk T. Puri C. Maspero E. Tacchetti C. Transidico P. Di Fiore P.P. Polo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2760-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Off-target effects of dominant negative mutants can also complicate interpretation of the results. For instance, whereas it was initially believed that β-arrestins were specific regulators for GPCRs, growing evidences demonstrate its role in the regulation of non-GPCRs membrane proteins endocytosis (27Chen W. Kirkbride K.C. How T. Nelson C.D. Mo J. Frederick J.P. Wang X.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Blobe G.C. Science. 2003; 301: 1394-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Although this may reflect direct interaction of β-arrestins with non-GPCR proteins (28Dalle S. Ricketts W. Imamura T. Vollenweider P. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15688-15695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), it could also result from the interference with components of the endocytic machinery that could be shared by clathrin- and caveolae-mediated routes.The above discussion illustrates the importance of developing new tools that will allow the direct assessment of the molecular steps involved in the endocytosis of specific GPCRs. To generate one such tool, we took advantage of the fact that, for internalization, the β-arrestins binding to the β2-adaptin subunit of the clathrin adaptor AP-2 are needed for the β-arrestin-mediated targeting of GPCRs to clathrin-coated pits (7Kim Y.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30760-30768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 8Laporte S.A. Miller W.E. Kim K.M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9247-9254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 10Laporte S.A. Oakley R.H. Zhang J. Holt J.A. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Specifically, we designed a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based assay that allows real-time monitoring of the interaction between β-arrestins and β2-adaptin as a biosensor for β-arrestin-promoted clathrin-mediated endocytosis. BRET is a non-radiative energy transfer that occurs between the energy donor Renilla luciferase (Rluc) and variants of the green fluorescent proteins (EYFP for BRET1 and GFP, GFP2, or Tsapphire for BRET2) as the energy acceptor only when the two proteins are within 100 Å from one another and situated in favorable orientation, making it an attractive assay for studying both inducible and constitutive protein-protein interactions (30Hamdan F.F. Percherancier Y. Breton B. Bouvier M. Curr. Prot. Neurosci.. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2006Google Scholar, 31Pfleger K.D. Eidne K.A. Biochem. J. 2004; 85: 625-637Google Scholar). Thus, in response to the activation of 12 different GPCRs, previously suggested to internalize via different endocytic routes, BRET1 was assessed between β-arrestin-Rluc and β2-adaptin-EYFP and used as an indicator of clathrin-mediated endocytosis involving β-arrestins. By combining the spectrally resolved BRET1 and BRET2 technologies, we could simultaneously assess the recruitment of β-arrestin to GPCR and β-arrestin/AP-2 interaction, which allowed us to monitor the kinetics of the two events. The data obtained herein show that some of the GPCRs previously suggested to internalize via a clathrin-independent pathway were capable of promoting β-arrestin interaction with AP-2. Thus, contrary to what was deduced from indirect methods, these receptors internalize via a β-arrestin- and clathrin-dependent mechanism. Other receptors, such as ETAR and ETBR, which are capable of recruiting β-arrestins but were shown to internalize via caveolae, did not promote β-arrestin interaction with β2-adaptin, indicating a β-arrestin-dependent but clathrin-independent endocytic process. In addition to providing a new tool to dissect the molecular events involved in GPCR endocytosis, the BRET-based β-arrestin/β2-adaptin interaction assay can also be used to detect constitutive receptor internalization and quantify receptor activation in a pharmacologically relevant manner.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum, Geneticin (G418), l-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin were purchased from Wisent.

Marullo, Institute Cochin, Paris) and the rat β-arrestin1 (a gift from Kathryn DeFea, University of California, Riverside) without their stop codons that were ligated upstream of a humanized Renilla reniformis luciferase (Rluc, originally PCR-amplified from phRluc-N1 from PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in pcDAN3.1zeo+ (Invitrogen); both β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 were fused to Rluc via the same 6-amino acid linker (GSGTAT). Rluc-β-arrestin2-EYFP construct was made as described by Charest et al. (42Charest P.G. Terrillon S. Bouvier M. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). β-Arrestin2-(R393E,R395E)-Rluc DNA was obtained by subcloning the mutant β-arrestin2 into pcDNA3.1. V2R-EYFP construct was generated by amplifying V2R coding sequences by PCR without its stop codon and cloned upstream of EYFP in pRK5. β2-Adaptin-EYFP was generated by subcloning the coding region, minus the stop codon, and coming from a human β2-adaptin plasmid template (10Laporte S.A.

Except for CCR5, EP4R, and C5aR, all GPCRs used in this study contained an N-terminal epitope tag (e.g. Myc, HA, or FLAG) that was previously shown not to compromise the activity of these receptors. For the purpose of brevity, unless stated otherwise, GPCRs used here will be identified by their names only without indicating their N-terminal epitope tag. All GPCRs used herein were from human cDNAs, except for the VIP1R, which was from rat.Cell Culture, Plasmid Transfections, and Stable Cell Line Production—Unless otherwise stated, human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were cultured in high glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine at 37 °C in a humidified chamber at 95% air and 5% CO2. For transient transfections in 6-well plates, 400,000 HEK293T cells were seeded and transfected the next day using Fugene6 according to manufacturer's recommendations. For transfections in 100-mm plates, cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 million cells/plate in DMEM containing 5% fetal bovine serum and transfected the next day using polyethyleneimine (PEI, 25-kDa molecular mass, linear form prepared at 1 mg/ml in sterile distilled H2O) at a DNA:PEI ratio of 1:3. Plasmid DNA and PEI were diluted, each in separate tubes, with 500 μl of NaCl solution (150 mm). The PEI solution was then added onto the DNA solution, vortexed at maximum speed for 5 s, and incubated at room temperature for 20 min prior to addition to the cells. To generate cells stably expressing β2-adaptin-EYFP (HEK293T/β2-adaptin-EYFP), transfected cells were selected with 1 mg/ml G418. Clonal cells expressing β2-adaptin-EYFP were obtained by limited dilution and were tested for expression of β2-adaptin-EYFP by fluorescence measurements and Western blotting. HEK293T cells stably expressing MycV2R (HEK293T/V2R) were generated by selection with 0.45 mg/ml G418, and a clonal cell line (41Charest P.G. Oligny-Longpre G. Bonin H. Azzi M. Bouvier M. Cell Signal. 2006; 19: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) expressing ∼8 pmol/mg of V2R was used for transient cotransfection of β2-adaptin-EYFP and β-arrestin2-Rluc.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out as described previously (65Fessart D. Simaan M. Zimmerman B. Comeau J. Hamdan F.F. Wiseman P.W. Bouvier M. Laporte S.A. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 1723-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on 6% SDS-PAGE, whereas proteins from total cell lysates were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE before transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes. Protein immunodetection on membranes was assessed using either anti-β2-adaptin (0.2 μg/ml), anti-α-adaptin (0.25 μg/ml), anti-clathrin (0.25 μg/ml), or anti-GFP (2 μg/ml) (65Fessart D. Simaan M.

Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 1723-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) antibodies.Total Fluorescence Measurements—To measure total fluorescence, cells were washed once with PBS-Mg (PBS containing 0.5 mm MgCl2), gently detached by pipetting in PBS-Mg, and seeded at a density of ∼100,000 cells/well in 96-well plates (white wall with clear bottom plates). All throughout this study, cell number quantification was based on measuring the A600 of the cell suspension and correlating it to a pre-established standard curve (A600 versus cell number). The fluorescence level was measured using a FlexStation II (Molecular Devices). For measuring fluorescence of V2R-Tsapphire, transfected cells were excited at 400 nm, and the emission was recorded at 511 nm (cut-off at 490 nm), whereas measurements of β2-adaptin-EYFP fluorescence were done at an excitation wavelength of 470 nm and emission wavelength of 535 nm (cut-off at 500 nm).Monitoring Protein-Protein Interaction Using BRET1—Approximately 18 h after transfection, cells were detached by trypsinization and seeded (∼50,000 cells/well) into 96-well (white wall, clear bottom) tissue culture plates previously treated with poly-d-lysine, and re-incubated at 37 °C for another 18 h. On the day of the experiment, the culture medium was replaced by PBS-Mg and incubated with or without various concentrations of the tested agonist for the specified time at room temperature. To measure the BRET1 signal, the transparent bottom of the 96-well plate was covered with a white-backed tape adhesive (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the BRET1 substrate for Rluc, coelenterazine-h, was added to all wells (5 μm final concentration), followed by BRET1 measurement on the Mithras LB940 plate reader, which allows the sequential integration of signals detected in the 480 ± 20 nm and 530 ± 20 nm windows. The BRET1 signal was calculated as a ratio of the light emitted by EYFP (530 ± 20 nm) over the light emitt"
https://openalex.org/W1973005200,"We analyze the effect of the plastoquinone redox state on the regulation of the light-harvesting antenna size at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. This was approached by studying transcription and accumulation of light-harvesting complexes in wild type versus the barley mutant viridis zb63, which is depleted in photosystem I and where plastoquinone is constitutively reduced. We show that the mRNA level of genes encoding antenna proteins is almost unaffected in the mutant; this stability of messenger level is not a peculiarity of antenna-encoding genes, but it extends to all photosynthesis-related genes. In contrast, analysis of protein accumulation by two-dimensional PAGE shows that the mutant undergoes strong reduction of its antenna size, with individual gene products having different levels of accumulation. We conclude that the plastoquinone redox state plays an important role in the long term regulation of chloroplast protein expression. However, its modulation is active at the post-transcriptional rather than transcriptional level.

Sunlight is the only energy source for plants: light is absorbed by chlorophylls and carotenoids bound to the pigment-protein complexes composing photosystems I and II (PSI and -II), 2The abbreviations used are:PSI,-IIphotosystems I and IIα(β)-DMn-dodecyl-α(β)-d-maltosideLhca (b)light-harvesting complex of PSI (II)LHCIantenna complex of PSIPQplastoquinoneROSreactive oxygen speciesWTwild typeRubiscoribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenaseRTreverse transcriptionMSmass spectrometryHPLChigh-performance liquid chromatographySAMsignificance analysis on microarrayEeinstein. and it is converted into chemical energy. Both photosystems are composed by two distinct moieties: (i) a core complex, responsible for charge separation and for the first steps of the electron transport, and (ii) an antenna system that increases light-harvesting capacity. In photosynthetic eukaryotes, the antenna system is composed by the members of a multigenic family called Lhc (light-harvesting complexes) (1Jansson S. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 236-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). To avoid the over-accumulation of excitation energy in photosystems, light-absorption capacity needs to be related to the electron transport rate. To this purpose, the number of antenna proteins associated to photosystems is regulated according to the environmental conditions (2Anderson J.M. Andersson B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 351-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). More recently it was shown that the regulation of antenna size is restricted to PSII, whereas PSI-LHCI stoichiometry remains constant (3Ballottari M. Dall'Osto L. Morosinotto T. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8947-8958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Besides antenna size regulation, other mechanisms, like the state transition, the adjustment of PSI/PSII ratio, and regulation of carotenoid biosynthesis, are also involved in the plant's long term acclimation to different conditions (4Walters R.G. J. Exp. Bot. 2005; 56: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The limiting step of electron transport chain from PSII to PSI is the oxidation of plastoquinol (PQ) by cytochrome b6f (5Joliot P. Joliot A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1102: 53-61Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar); the PQ pool redox state depends on PSII excitation pressure, on the donor side, on the PSI capacity as acceptor, and on the rate of PQ reduction by cyclic electron transport (6Joliot P. Joliot A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10209-10214Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Thus, the ratio between reduced and oxidized plastoquinone is considered a good indicator of the balance between light absorption and electron transport rate: PQ over-reduction, in fact, suggests that electron transport is unable to use all the energy absorbed by PSII, where accumulation of excited states easily leads to the formation of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS) (7Barber J. Andersson B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 61-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Thus, it is not surprising that the PQ pool redox state has been identified as a key signal modulating the expression of photosynthesis-related genes in response to light conditions (8Escoubas J.M. Lomas M. LaRoche J. Falkowski P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10237-10241Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Studies on algae like Dunaliella tertiolecta and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (9Durnford D.G. Price J.A. Mckim S.M. Sarchfield M.L. Physiologia Plantarum. 2003; 118: 193-205Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar) showed that PQ redox state influences dramatically the expression level of photosynthetic genes. In particular, the largest effects were observed in the genes encoding members of the lhc family, whose expression is strongly repressed upon exposure to strong light. Besides plastoquinone, also thioredoxin, glutathione, and ROS were proposed as signals for regulation of gene expression (for a review see Ref. 10Pfannschmidt T. Allen J.F. Oelmuller R. Physiologia Plantarum. 2001; 112: 1-9Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The picture is even more complicated in the case of multicellular organisms like vascular plants, where the redox signal represents, in each cell, the state of 80–100 chloroplasts rather than a single organelle (10Pfannschmidt T. Allen J.F. Oelmuller R. Physiologia Plantarum. 2001; 112: 1-9Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 11Masuda T. Tanaka A. Melis A.

Despite these studies, the role of gene expression regulation in long term acclimation of the photosynthetic apparatus to different light conditions is still unclear. In fact, while the regulation of the polypeptide level was reported by several laboratories (2Anderson J.M. Andersson B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 351-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 12Melis A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1058: 87-106Crossref Scopus (442) Google Scholar), data for mRNA level are still incomplete. This lack of information is probably due to the fact that treatments with electron transport inhibitors, like DCMU (3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea) and DBMIB (2,5-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-p-benzoquinone), widely used to simulate different PQ redox conditions, cannot be prolonged indefinitely. In addition, it was recently shown that the repression of lhc gene transcription induced by strong illumination is reversible after ∼24 h, even if the light treatment is maintained, thus suggesting that regulation mechanisms could be different on the longer term with respect to short term stress (13Chen Y.B. Durnford D.G. Koblizek M. Falkowski P.G. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 3737-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In this work we analyzed the regulation of antenna system in barley mutant viridis zb63, which has a chronically over-reduced PQ pool even if grown at very low light intensities (14Morosinotto T. Bassi R. Frigerio S. Finazzi G. Morris E. Barber J. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 4616-4630Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), to obtain new insights on the role of plastoquinone redox state both on gene and protein long term regulation. The use of this mutant allows the study of a long term PQ over-reduction without the need of inhibitor treatments. Viridis zb63 was recently shown to have a PSII antenna system reduced to its minimum level: a dimeric PSII reaction center core surrounded by one copy of each monomeric Lhcb4, Lhcb5, and the trimeric light-harvesting complex II (14Morosinotto T. Bassi R. Frigerio S. Finazzi G. Morris E. Barber J. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 4616-4630Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We found that, despite these strong effects on Lhc protein accumulation, transcription of corresponding genes was substantially unaltered in the mutant, as compared with WT, whose PQ is oxidized in low light (14Morosinotto T. Bassi R. Frigerio S. Finazzi G. Morris E. Barber J. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 4616-4630Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Stability of transcription level was not restricted to lhc genes, but it was observed for most photosynthesis-related genes. The PQ pool redox state, thus, plays a role in long term regulation of the expression of antenna proteins mainly at the post-transcriptional level, whereas its effect on gene transcription is relevant only a few hours after alteration in light conditions. Genetic Material and Growth Conditions—A spring barley (Hordeum vulgare cv Bonus) and a mutant lacking PSI, viridis zb63, obtained by chemical mutagenesis on the cv Bonus genetic background, were used. Plants were grown for 9 days at 23 °C with 8-h photoperiod and 100 μmol m-2 s-1 of light. For RNA extraction leaves, in the middle of the light period, were harvested and immediately frozen into liquid nitrogen. This experiment was conducted three times to obtain three independent biological replicates. RNA Isolation and Array Hybridization—Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol reagent according to the method published at the Arabidopsis functional genomics consortium website and further cleaned using an RNeasy Minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Disposable RNA chips (Agilent RNA 6000 Nano LabChip kit) were used to determine the concentration and purity/integrity of RNA samples using Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized starting from 5 μg of total RNA using the GeneChip® Expression 3′-amplification reagents-One Cycle cDNA Synthesis Kit (Affymetrix) according to the standard protocol. This double-stranded cDNA was used as template to generate biotin-labeled cRNA from an in vitro transcription reaction (IVT), using the GeneChip® Expression 3′-amplification reagents-For IVT Labeling Kit (Affymetrix) following manufacturer instructions. The resulting biotin-labeled cRNA was fragmented into strands of 35–200 bases in length following Affymetrix protocols, and 15 μg of fragmented target cRNA was hybridized on an Affymetrix Barley Genome Array according to the standard protocol (16 h at 45 °C with rotation in the Affymetrix GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640). The arrays were washed and stained on an Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450 according to the standard protocol, then scanned on a Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000. Data Analysis—Scanned images were analyzed using the Gene Chip Operating Software 1.4 (Affymetrix). Expression analysis was done using default values. Quality control values, present calls, background, noise, scaling factor, spike controls, and the 3′/5′ ratios of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and tubulin showed low variation between samples (15Close T.J. Wanamaker S.I. Caldo R.A. Turner S.M. Ashlock D.A. Dickerson J.A. Wing R.A. Muehlbauer G.J. Kleinhofs A. Wise R.P. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 960-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Raw data files (CEL files) were background-adjusted and normalized, and gene expression values were calculated using Robust Multichip Analysis (RMA) algorithm implemented in the statistical package R 2.3.1 (R foundation) with the dedicated affy library (R foundation). Normalized data were imported into the Genespring GX 7.3.1 (Silicon Genetics) software for analysis. Each gene was normalized to the median of the measurements. We used detection calls (present) as an initial filtering step: a present-absent filter was applied to remove probe sets with less than two present cells. A second filter was applied to eliminate probe sets with normalized signal value between 0.66 and 1.5, to evaluate significant the -fold change. In the comparison (wild type versus viridis zb63) the baseline was set as wild type; genes with at least a 2-fold change value in the comparison were further considered. Lists of differentially expressed genes were analyzed for statistical significant changes by a Welch t test (analysis of variance) with the Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate correction; the false discovery rate-adjusted p value cutoff was set to 0.05. For the functional probe sets annotation BLAST search results were exported from HarvEST 1.50. RT-PCR—RT-PCR was performed both on nuclear and chloroplast genes. For each reaction, first strand synthesis was done on 0.5 μg of total RNA (treated with DNase I) using 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Sigma) and a poly(T) primer, for nuclear genes, or a gene-specific primer, for chloroplast sequences. This synthesis was followed by RNase H treatment. Transcripts were then amplified using the following primers: nuclear genes: lhca3 (Contig1815_at), 5′-GCAGTACTTCCTGGGTCTCGAGAAG-3′ and 5′-GCAATGCACTAATTTTCATAGCACGATA-3′; lhcb1 (Contig422_at), 5′-AGTTGCTTCGAGCAGCCCGTGGTA-3′ and 5′-AGTGGGCCACCGGCAATGCGGTA-3′; lhcb6 (Contig1523_at), 5′-AAGCGATGCCGAGTTCATCAACCCGT-3′ and 5′-TACCCTTGCTCGCCGGTGAAGTTG-3′; psaH (Contig2250_at), 5′-CAGCTCGACCGCAATGGCGTCGCT-3′ and 5′-CGCGGCGAAGGTGTTGAAGAACTTGC-3′; ζ-carotene desaturase (Contig HW04B18_u_s_at), 5′-CTCAAGGTCGCCATCATAGGTGCC-3′ and 5′-GATCAACAAGAGCTTGAACAACTGGGC-3′; glycerophosphoryl diesterase (Contig 8049_at), 5′-TCGACTACGTCGAGTTCGACGTGC-3′ and 5′-AGTTTTCGCATGAGTTGCGCAGCATCG-3′; and copper-binding protein (Contig 17974_at), 5′-CCTTTTCACTTCAGAGCTTCACTGTTC-3′ and 5′-AGCACCTCATAGGGCGTCACGTC-3′. The chloroplastic genes were: psaA (HV_ CEa0013J19f_at), 5′-CTTTATCCTAGTTTTGCCGAAGGAGCA-3′ and 5′-GGTATGGATAGGGAGGCATAGAATACA-3′; psaC (HV_CEb0010M11f_at), 5′-GTCTCTTGGCTCTTTTCACGCTTTCT-3′ and 5′-CATGCTACGGGTTGTTTCAGGCCCT-3′; psbA, 5′-TCCCTATTCAGTGCTATGCATGGTTCC-3′ and 5′-TCAACAGCAGCTAAGTCTAGAGGGAAG-3′; and psbD, 5′-GATGGGAGTTGCCGGAGTATTAGGC-3′ and 5′-CATGAGGCTGATCCTGAGCTGCCAT-3′. The transcripts were amplified from 50 ng of cDNA as template and 2.5 units of TaqDNA polymerase (Sigma) using the followings cycles: 94 °C for 30 s, annealing for 30 s, 72 °C for 40 s, followed by a final extension step at 72 °C for 1 min. To highlight the exponential phase, the amplification was stopped after 24, 26, and 28 cycles, and 5 μl for each gene was collected. RT-PCR reactions were performed with primers designed on gene coding with β-actin used as the standard. Amplification products were separated on 2% agarose gel. Thylakoid Isolation and Quantification—From 9-day-old plants, thylakoids were isolated as in a previous study (16Bassi R. Rigoni F. Barbato R. Giacometti G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 936: 29-38Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). After the isolation, the membranes were further purified through a centrifugation on a sucrose step gradient: thylakoids were resuspended in 1.9 m sucrose, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors then stratified at the bottom of a step gradient made in SW28 tubes with 1.3 m and 1.14 m sucrose solutions. After 1-h centrifugation at 27,000 rpm, the big green band containing purified thylakoids was recovered from the interface of the step gradient. Thylakoids were quantified both through chlorophyll absorption spectra and using a BCA assay (Sigma-Aldrich) for total protein content. Proteomic Analysis—Proteins from thylakoids were prepared for isoelectric focusing as follows: first, proteins were de-phosphorylated by treating with calf intestine phosphatase) for 1 h at 37 °C. Then, after the precipitation with 14 volumes of tributylphosphate:acetone:methanol (1:12:1, v/v), proteins were resuspended using 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 40 mm Tris, 1% amidosulfobetaine-14, 1% carrier ampholyte, pH 3–8, reduced with 5 mm tributyl phosphine, and alkylated with 10 mm acrylamide. Protein solution obtained was then used for passive re-hydration of the immobilized pH gradient strip (pH range 3–8, from Bio-Rad), then focused (3 h with linearly increasing voltage till 5 KV, then 5 KV till VH reach 65,000). The second dimension was performed with a gel system described before (17Ballottari M. Govoni C. Caffarri S. Morosinotto T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 4659-4665Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) with acrylamide gradient 12–18%. Gels were stained with Sypro Ruby (Sigma-Aldrich), and images for quantitative analysis with PDQuest software where acquired with a Versa-Doc detection system (Bio-Rad). Spots where cut from gels for MS analysis: the proteins from punched out spots were destained, alkylated with 55 mm iodoacetamide after reduction with 10 mm dithiothreitol, and digested in gel with trypsin at 37 °C overnight, and the peptides were extracted with 1% formic acid. For desalting, the solution was transferred to a nano-HPLC column and finally eluted from a 75-μm, 70-mm column with reversed-phase C18 material with a gradient of 0–80% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The mass spectrometer was a LTQ-FT (Thermo-Finnigan) with a linear ion trap and an ion cyclotron with a 7-Tesla magnet. Lhcb1 Cloning and Expression—Sequences for different Lhcb1 where obtained from a cDNA library, amplified, and cloned in a pQE50His vector, using BamHI and HindIII as restriction sites (18Caffarri S. Croce R. Cattivelli L. Bassi R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9467-9476Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Transformed Escherichia coli cells (SG13009) where grown for 3 h at 37 °C then induced for 6 h with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; the recombinant proteins where purified as inclusion bodies following the protocol from Nagai and colleagues (19Nagai K. Thøgersen H.C. Methods Enzimol. 1987; 153: 461-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Reconstitution Procedure—The pigment-protein complexes refolding in vitro were performed as described before (20Giuffra E. Cugini D. Croce R. Bassi R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: the 1.1-ml reconstitution mixture contained 420 μg of apoprotein, 240 μg of chlorophylls, and 60 μg of carotenoids. The chlorophyll a/b ratio of the pigment mixture was 2.3. All pigments used were purified from spinach thylakoids. Analysis of Reconstituted Complexes—High performance liquid chromatography analysis was performed as described before (21Gilmore A.M. Yamamoto H.Y. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Chlorophyll to carotenoid ratio and chlorophyll a/b ratio were measured independently by fitting the spectrum of acetone extracts with the spectra of individual purified pigments (22Croce R. Morosinotto T. Castelletti S. Breton J. Bassi R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Bioenerg. 2002; 1556: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The absorption spectra at room temperature were recorded using a SLM-Aminco DK2000 spectrophotometer, in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5 m sucrose, and 0.06% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside. The wavelength sampling step was 0.4 nm, scan rate 100 nm/min, and optical path length 1 cm. Fluorescence emission spectra were measured using a Jasco FP-777 spectrofluorometer and were corrected for instrumental response. For emission spectra, samples were excited at 440, 475, and 500 nm with spectral bandwidths of 5 nm (excitation) and 3 nm (emission). For excitation spectra, emission was recorded at 685 nm, with bandwidths of 3 and 5 nm for excitation and emission, respectively. Chlorophyll concentration was ∼0.02 μg/ml in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 0.03% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside. Western Blot Titration—For protein quantity titration using Western blot assay, thylakoids were loaded on minigels using the system described in a previous study (17Ballottari M. Govoni C. Caffarri S. Morosinotto T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 4659-4665Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), in four different dilutions to achieve a good reproducibility and avoid saturation effects. Different samples were quantified for their protein content using a BCA assay. For viridis zb63, on gels for Lhca3, Lhca4, Lhcb1, Lhcb4, Lhcb5, Lhcb6, PsbB, and PsbC, assays were loaded 11, 22, 33, and 44 μg of total proteins, whereas for Lhcb3, PsaE, and PsaF the protein amount was reduced to 1.2, 2.2, 4.4, and 8.8 μg of proteins. Similarly, for viridis 115 on gels for Lhcb4 and Lhcb6, assays were loaded 4, 8, 12, and 16 μg of proteins, whereas for LHCII the amounts were 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, and 3.2 μg of proteins. One microgram of protein corresponded to 0.10 μg of Chls, 0.04, 0.06 per WT, Viridis Zb63 and 115, respectively. The results of the antibody reaction were acquired with a scanner and analyzed by densitometry using Gel-Pro Analyser 3.1. Non-denaturing Deriphat-PAGE—Non-denaturing Deriphat-PAGE was performed as in a previous study (23Peter G.F. Thornber J.P. Rogers L.J. Methods in Plant Biochemistry. Academic Press, New York1991: 195-210Google Scholar) with the following modifications: the stacking gel had 3.5% (w/v) acrylamide (48:1.5% acrylamide/bisacrylamide). The resolving gel had an acrylamide concentration gradient from 4.5 to 11.5% (w/v) stabilized by a glycerol gradient from 8% to 16% (w/v). 12 mm Tris and 48 mm glycine, pH 8.5, were also included in both gels. Thylakoids, at chlorophyll concentration of 1 mg/ml, were solubilized with an equal volume of 1.6% of α-DM (Anatrace®, Maumee, OH). Solubilized thylakoids were vortexed for 1 min, left for 10 min in ice, and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min for pelletting un-solubilized material. 30 μg of chlorophylls was loaded per each gel lane. Biochemical Determination of Lipid Peroxidation—Lipid peroxidation was assessed indirectly by measuring malondialdehyde using HPLC, as before (24Havaux M. Eymery F. Porfirova S. Rey P. Dormann P. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 3451-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. The samples (each one consists of 3 leaf discs of 5 mm in diameter) were exposed to 100 μE (control) and to 1300 μE light (high light) or incubated in the dark, for 4 h. After incubation, samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen, then ground in 150 μl of 175 mm NaCl and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. A volume of 0.5% w/v thiobarbituric acid in 20% w/v trichloroacetic acid was added, and samples were incubated at 95 °C for 25 min. After 20-min centrifugation, the malondialdehyde(thiobarbituric acid)2 adduct was separated and quantified by HPLC, using 65% 50 mm KH2PO4-KOH, pH 7.0, and 35% methanol as elution buffer. Differences in Transcription Rate between WT and Viridis zb63 Plants Grown in Control Conditions—Viridis zb63 is a barley mutant depleted in PSI but retaining a normal PSII activity (25Simpson D.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 31: 305-314PubMed Google Scholar, 26Nielsen V.S. Scheller H.V. Moller B.L. Physiologia Plantarum. 1996; 98: 637-644Crossref Google Scholar). The mutation is lethal, and it is maintained in a heterozygous state. Homozygous mutant plants grow up to 2 weeks on seed reserves, and they are easily distinguishable from WT because of their paler green color. The mutation causes a block of linear electron transport, which was shown to cause the chronic over-reduction of the PQ pool even in low light (20 μE) conditions (14Morosinotto T. Bassi R. Frigerio S. Finazzi G. Morris E. Barber J. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 4616-4630Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In this work we grew WT and mutant plants in dim light conditions (100 μE) ensuring the complete reduction of the PQ pool in the mutant but not in the WT. Because viridis zb63 is depleted in PSI but still presents a residual 2% PSI activity (26Nielsen V.S. Scheller H.V. Moller B.L. Physiologia Plantarum. 1996; 98: 637-644Crossref Google Scholar), we verified the dependence of PQ redox state on light intensity in WT versus mutant leaves. As shown in Fig. 1, left panel, even very low illumination causes a saturation of PSII reaction centers in the mutant. On the contrary, in the WT saturation is achieved only with far stronger light intensities. This measure, thus, demonstrates that in growing conditions used here PQ pool is completely reduced in the mutant but not in the WT plants. The same light intensity was also chosen, because it did not cause significant oxidative stress in the mutant: as shown in Fig. 1, right panel, the amount of lipid peroxides generated at 100 μeq with respect to dark conditions is similar in WT and viridis zb63, whereas larger accumulation of lipid peroxides is instead observed both in WT and mutant when leaves are exposed to high light (1300 μE), where the plastoquinone pool is reduced in WT plants as well. The redox state of PQ and other electron transporters was proposed to play a key role in regulating the expression of photosynthetic genes (8Escoubas J.M. Lomas M. LaRoche J. Falkowski P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10237-10241Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 27Tullberg A. Alexciev K. Pfannschmidt T. Allen J.F. Plant Cell Physiol. 2000; 41: 1045-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, these studies were all restricted to the effects of few hours of light treatment. In this work we used viridis zb63 as a model to identify genes responding to the PQ redox state on a longer timescale, by comparing the mutant transcriptome to the wild-type one. After 9 days of growth at 100 μE, total RNA was extracted from plants and retro-transcribed using the poly(A) tail. The corresponding biotin-labeled cRNA was hybridized to the 22 k Barley 1 GeneChip (15Close T.J. Wanamaker S.I. Caldo R.A. Turner S.M. Ashlock D.A. Dickerson J.A. Wing R.A. Muehlbauer G.J. Kleinhofs A. Wise R.P. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 960-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) on three biological replicates for each genotype. A 2-fold change cut-off was applied, followed by analysis for statistically significant changes using Welch-t test and SAM (Significance Analysis on Microarray). Leaves used for sampling were maintained under continuous illumination during harvesting; this was an essential precaution in the case of the mutant, because we observed that the PQ redox pool is completely reduced even by very low illumination, but it is re-oxidized, possibly by alternative chloroplastic oxidases, after few minutes of darkness (data not shown). In the described experimental conditions a total of 542 genes of 22,840 (from here forward we will refer to probe sets as genes) were differentially expressed between WT and mutant plants; in particular, 503 genes were up-regulated and 39 down-regulated in viridis zb63 with respect to WT. Their classification is reported in Fig. 2; the complete list of up- and down-regulated genes is reported in the supplemental material. Among them, 168 probe sets were annotated as an “expressed protein” of unknown function or as new genes without correspondence in the databases. 76 of the remaining genes (73 of which up-regulated) were associated to RNA transcription and maturation. 42 genes (36 up-regulated) were instead associated to protein synthesis or protein degradation, like ubiquitin and proteases. In addition, 16 genes related to cell cycle were up-regulated, including senescence-associated factors, apoptosis, and programmed cell death involved proteins. In the mutant, 53 genes involved in signaling were also induced, like kinases and phosphatases as well as 13 factors implicated in hormone biosynthesis or response. As expected, the mutation altered metabolism as well: in particular, 31 enzymes involved in sugar metabolism and translocation as well as 22 enzymes of lipid biosynthesis were up-regulated. Eighteen known stress-related genes were regulated and four are known to be involved in oxidative stress response: two peroxidases, one ferritin (28Arnaud N. Murgia I. Boucherez J. Briat J.F. Cellier F. Gaymard F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23579-23588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and a protein induced by radicals (29Fujibe T. Saji H. Watahiki M.K. Yamamoto K.T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2006; 70: 1827-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This result is consistent with previous data suggesting that mutant plants experience a chronic light excess condition, as confirmed by the large accumulation of zeaxanthin (14Morosinotto T. Bassi R. Frigerio S. Finazzi G. Morris E. Barber J. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 4616-4630Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 30Demmig-Adams B. Adams W.W. Aust. J.

https://openalex.org/W2071103462,"Members of the Pellino family are interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)-interacting proteins that possess RING-like domains. The presence of these domains led to the suggestion that Pellino proteins are ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligases (E3). However, no conclusive data currently exist to prove this proposal. This study provides the first direct evidence that Pellino proteins possess E3 activity. Recombinant forms of Pellino1 and Pellino2 and both spliced variants of Pellino3 are shown in an in vitro ubiquitination assay to be E3 ligases that catalyze Lys(63)-linked polyubiquitination, with Pellino3 exhibiting the greatest ligase activity. Whereas the Pellino proteins cause polyubiquitination of IRAK-1, we also show that kinase-active members of the IRAK family (IRAK-1 and IRAK-4) promote reciprocal polyubiquitination of the Pellino proteins and that this is associated with IRAK-induced degradation of the Pellino family. In contrast, IRAK-2 (which lacks a functional kinase domain) and kinase-dead forms of IRAK-1 and IRAK-4 fail to degrade the Pellino proteins. We show that these kinase-inactive IRAK proteins can associate with Pellino proteins, thus excluding the possibility that their inability to regulate Pellino degradation is due to lack of association with the Pellino proteins. The physiological relevance of IRAK-induced degradation of Pellino proteins is confirmed by the demonstration that lipopolysaccharide causes degradation of endogenous forms of Pellino3 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In summary, this study not only demonstrates Pellino proteins to be E3 ligases that can catalyze Lys(63)-linked polyubiquitination but also shows bidirectional signaling between the IRAK and Pellino families and highlights a novel function for IRAK kinase activity."

The mechanisms of post-endocytic sorting of ubiquitinated receptors are incompletely understood. Here, we investigated the role of hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (HRS), in post-endocytic sorting and signaling of PAR2. In HEK-PAR2 cells, PAR2 activating peptide (PAR2-AP) induced PAR2 trafficking from the cell surface to early endosomes containing endogenous HRS, and then to lysosomes. HRS overexpression or knockdown with small interfering RNA caused formation of enlarged HRS-positive endosomes, where activated PAR2 and c-Cbl accumulated, and PAR2 failed to traffic to lysosomes. Overexpression of HRS prevented PAR2-AP-induced degradation of PAR2, as determined by Western blotting. Overexpression of HRS mutant lacking an ubiquitin-binding motif similarly caused retention of PAR2 in enlarged endosomes. Moreover, HRS overexpression or knockdown caused retention of ubiquitin-resistant PAR2Δ14K/R in enlarged HRS-containing endosomes, preventing recycling and resensitization of PAR2Δ14K/R. HRS overexpression or knockdown similarly prevented lysosomal trafficking and recycling of calcitonin receptor-like receptor, a non-ubiquitinated receptor that traffics to lysosomes after sustained activation and recycles after transient activation. Thus, HRS plays a critically important role in the post-endocytic sorting of single receptors, PAR2 and CLR, to both degradative and recycling pathways. This sorting role for HRS is independent of its ubiquitin-interacting motif, and it can regulate trafficking of both ubiquitinated and non-ubiquitinated PAR2 and non-ubiquitinated CLR.

Our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the critical sorting of GPCRs to these divergent pathways, degradative or recycling, is incomplete and controversial. Ubiquitination of certain receptors, exemplified by protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) and the chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4), serves as a signal for sorting receptors into a lysosomal or proteasomal degradation pathway (4Jacob C.

It is important to elucidate the sorting machinery that diverts a receptor, in an ubiquitin-dependent or independent manner, to lysosomes or the plasma membrane, as this trafficking regulates cellular responses to agonists.

It has an ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM) and can bind directly to ubiquitinated receptors, resulting in their accumulation in internal vesicles of multivesicular bodies and their delivery to lysosomes (21Raiborg C.

Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Non-ubiquitinated proteins are not recognized by HRS and escape sorting to the lysosomal pathway, enabling them to recycle (21Raiborg C. Bache K.G. Gillooly D.J. Madshus I.H. Stang E. Stenmark H.

Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 446-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have identified additional roles of HRS in controlling trafficking on non-ubiquitinated GPCRs to degradative and recycling pathways. Thus, HRS mediates lysosomal trafficking of the non-ubiquitinated δ-opioid receptor, and mediates recycling of the ubiquitinated β2-adrenergic receptor and μ-opioid receptor (14Hislop J.N. Marley A. Von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22522-22531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 17Hanyaloglu A.C. McCullagh E. von Zastrow M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2265-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus, the function of HRS in post-endocytic sorting depends on the GPCR in question and its ubiquitination. We examined the role of HRS in trafficking and signaling of PAR2, a GPCR that is cleaved and activated by several serine proteases that are generated during injury and inflammation (27Nystedt S.

Rev. 2004; 84: 579-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). These proteases cleave PAR2 to expose a tethered ligand domain that binds to and activates the cleaved receptor (27Nystedt S.

Given the irreversible nature of proteolytic activation of PAR2, and its proinflammatory and nociceptive actions (29Ossovskaya V.S. Bunnett N.W. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 579-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar), mechanisms that arrest PAR2 signaling are of considerable interest. Permanent signal arrest requires PAR2 degradation in lysosomes, but the post-endocytic sorting mechanisms that target the receptor to lysosomes are incompletely understood (30Bohm S.K. Khitin L.M.

Bunnett N.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18524-18535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl monoubiquitinates PAR2 at multiple sites, which is necessary for lysosomal trafficking, because a non-ubiquitinated PAR2 mutant, PAR2Δ14K/R, escapes degradation and recycles (4Jacob C. Cottrell G.S. Gehringer D. Schmidlin F. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16076-16087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Investigation of the role of HRS in post-endocytic sorting of PAR2 to lysosomes and PAR2Δ14K/R to the plasma membrane provided a unique opportunity to define the role of HRS in the post-endocytic trafficking of a single receptor with divergent fates after internalization. For comparison, we also examined the role of HRS in the post-endocytic sorting of the receptor for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a heterodimer of calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR), a GPCR, and receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1), a protein with a single transmembrane domain. An understanding of the control of CLR and RAMP1 is important because CGRP is a potent vasodilator and mediator of neurogenic inflammation and pain transmission (32Brain S.D. Grant A.D. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 903-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). CLR and RAMP1 recycle after transient stimulation with CGRP, but during continuous stimulation traffic to lysosomes by processes that do not require receptor ubiquitination (8Cottrell G.S. Padilla B.

These studies enabled us to evaluate the role of HRS in the divergent trafficking of a non-ubiquitinated heterodimeric receptor to lysosomes or the plasma membrane. Antibodies—Antibodies were from the following sources: mouse anti-HRS from Alexis Biochemicals, Switzerland; rabbit anti-FLAG, rabbit anti-HA11, rabbit anti-Myc, mouse anti-β-actin, and rabbit anti-γ-tubulin from Sigma; mouse anti-human transferrin receptor (TfR) from Zymed Laboratories; mouse anti-early endosomal antigen-1 (EEA1) from BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY; rabbit antiearly endosomal antigen-1 (EEA1) from Calbiochem, San Diego, CA; mouse anti-human lysosomal-associated glycomembrane protein-1 (LAMP1) from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA; rat high affinity anti-HA11 from Roche Applied Science; goat anti-mouse, -rat, or -rabbit IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase, fluorescein isothiocyanate, or rhodamine red-X from Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA; goat anti-mouse or rabbit IgG coupled to Alexa Fluor® 680 from Invitrogen, and coupled to IRDye™ 800 from Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA. cDNAs and siRNA—The pcDNA5/FRT plasmid was from Invitrogen. cDNA encoding c-Cbl with N-terminal HA11 was a gift from Dr. C. Thien (University of Western Australia) (33Scaife R.M. Langdon W.Y. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 215-226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Myc-tagged HRS, Myc-tagged HRS lacking the UIM (HRSΔUIM), and Myc-tagged HRSΔVHS (all in pcDNA3) were gifts from Dr. M. von Zastrow, Dr. J. N. Hislop, and Dr. A. C. Hanyaloglu (University of California, San Francisco, CA). cDNAs for PAR2, PAR2Δ14K/R, CLR, and RAMP1 have been described (4Jacob C. Cottrell G.S. Gehringer D. Schmidlin F. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. J.

Knockdown of HRS using siRNA was achieved by transfection of duplex RNA oligonucleotides (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) corresponding to part of the coding region of human HRS (CGACAAGAACCCACACGTC, HRS-siRNA1), as described (14Hislop J.N. Marley A. Von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22522-22531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 34Bache K.G. Raiborg C. Mehlum A. Stenmark H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12513-12521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). To further confirm HRS knockdown specificity, a distinct siRNA directed against a second target sequence in the human HRS transcript (GCACGTCTTTCCAGAATTCAA, HRS-siRNA2) was also used (35Hanyaloglu A.C. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3095-3104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In control experiments, cells were transfected with nonsense duplex RNA oligonucleotide (AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACG). Transfected Cells and Cell Lines—Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK) and Henrietta Lacks (HeLa) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum in 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The generation and maintenance of HEK-FLP cells (Invitrogen) stably expressing PAR2 with an N-terminal FLAG epitope and a C-terminal HA11 or T7 epitope, or the ubiquitin-defective PAR2 mutant (PAR2Δ14K/R) with an N-terminal FLAG epitope and a C-terminal HA11 epitope (HEK-PAR2), or CLR with an N-terminal HA11 epitope and RAMP1 with an N-terminal Myc epitope (HEK-CLR-RAMP1) have been described (4Jacob C.

In some experiments, HEK cells were transiently transfected using Lipo-fectamine™ 2000 according to the manufacturer's guidelines (Invitrogen). Cells were plated 48 h prior to the experiments. Endogenous HRS was knocked-down in HeLa cells using siRNA. Cells were plated in 6-well plates at 80% confluence. After 16 h, cells were transfected with duplex RNA strands (HRS-siRNA1, HRS-siRNA2, or control siRNA) using Lipo-fectamine™ 2000. After 24 h, cells were transfected again with cDNA for PAR2-HA11 or CLR-HA11 and RAMP1). Cells were studied 48 h after the second transfection. Activation of PAR2 or CLR and Drug Treatments—PAR2 activating peptide (corresponding to the tethered ligand of rat/mouse PAR2, SLIGRL-NH2, CPC Scientific, San Jose, CA) and rat α-CGRP (Bachem, Torrance, CA) were used to activate PAR2 and CLR/RAMP1, respectively. HEK-PAR2 or HEK-CLR-RAMP1 cells were washed three times with PBS and placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were stimulated with PAR2-AP (100 μm, various times) or CGRP (100 nm, various times). To inhibit new protein synthesis (during degradation assays and during calcium experiments), cells were incubated with cycloheximide (140 μm). To interfere with Golgi vesicular transport of PAR2 (during calcium experiments), cells were incubated with brefeldin A1 (10 μg/ml) (Sigma). Inhibitors were preincubated with cells 1 h prior to stimulation. Controls included the appropriate vehicle. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—HEK or HeLa cells were plated at ∼3 × 105 per 35-mm dish onto coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine (100 μg/ml). Cells were washed in 100 mm PBS, pH 7.4, and fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde, pH 7.4 (20 min, 4 °C). Cells were washed with PBS containing 0.1% saponin and 1% heat-inactivated normal goat serum for 30 min. Proteins were localized using the primary antibodies: HRS (1:200), HA11 (rabbit, 1:200), HA11 (rat, 1:200), EEA1 (mouse, 1:500), EEA1 (rabbit, 1:1,000), LAMP1 (1:1,000), Myc (1:500), and TfR (1:1,000) (overnight, 4 °C). Cells were washed for 30 min with PBS containing 0.1% saponin and 1% normal goat serum, and incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate or rhodamine red-X (1:200, 2 h at room temperature). To examine trafficking of receptors from the plasma membrane, thereby avoiding confounding effects of receptors present in internal pools, we labeled receptors at the cell surface with antibodies to extracellular epitope tags. Cells expressing FLAG-PAR2 or HA11-CLR-RAMP1 were incubated with rabbit anti-FLAG (to detect PAR2, 1:100) or rabbit anti-HA11 (to detect CLR, 1:100) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed with PBS and stimulated with PAR2-AP or CGRP. Cells were fixed at specified times, washed, and incubated with fluorescent secondary antibodies. These antibody-tagged receptors traffic similarly to non-tagged receptors (4Jacob C. Cottrell G.S. Gehringer D. Schmidlin F. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16076-16087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 8Cottrell G.S. Padilla B. Pikios S. Roosterman D. Steinhoff M. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. J. Biol.

Cells were observed with a Zeiss laser-scanning confocal microscope (LSM Meta 510) using a Plan-Apochromat ×63 oil immersion objective with a 1.4 numerical aperture. Images were collected and simultaneously processed (colored and merged) with the Zeiss (LSM 510) software. Image Analysis—Data were analyzed using Zeiss LSM 510 software. Targeting of recycling receptors to the plasma membrane was analyzed by drawing regions of interest on the outside and the inside of the plasma membrane, which allowed determination of the percentage of total cellular fluorescence at the plasma membrane, as previously described (37O'Callaghan D.W. Hasdemir B. Leighton M. Burgoyne R.D. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4833-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Colocalization of two proteins in organelles was analyzed by drawing regions of interest around the outside of a cell in the merged image and measuring the overlap coefficient, with a coefficient of 0 indicating no colocalization and of 1 indicating complete co-localization. >20 cells were analyzed for each experiment. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Cells were plated at 1 × 106 cells per 35-mm dish coated with poly-d-lysine. Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1% SDS, boiled and centrifuged. Lysates (10 μg of protein) were separated by SDS-PAGE (8% acrylamide gels). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-FL, Millipore, Billerica, MA) and blocked for 1 h at room temperature (Odyssey Blocking Buffer, LiCOR, Lincoln, NE). Membranes were incubated with antibodies to rabbit HA11 (1:5,000), HRS (1:1,000), and β-actin (1:20,000), overnight at 4 °C (Odyssey Blocking Buffer). Membranes were washed for 30 min (1× PBS, 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor® 680 or IRDye™ 800 (1:20,000, 1 h at room temperature), and blots were analyzed with the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LiCOR). To quantify PAR2 degradation, PAR2 signals were compared with β-actin signals. Measurement of [Ca2+]i—PAR2 signaling was evaluated by measuring [Ca2+]i. Cells were plated at 1.2 × 106 cells per 35-mm dish onto coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine. Cells were washed, incubated in Hank's balanced salt solution containing Ca2+ and Mg2+, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with 2.5 μm fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (Invitrogen) for 20 min at 37 °C and washed. Fluorescence was measured at 340 and 380 nm excitation and 510 nm emission in a F-2500 spectrophotometer (Hitachi Instruments, Irvine, CA). The ratio of the fluorescence at the two excitation wavelengths, which is proportional to [Ca2+]i, was calculated. To assess desensitization and resensitization, cells were exposed to PAR2-AP (100 μm) or vehicle (control) for 1 h at 37 °C, washed 3 times, and then challenged a second time with PAR2-AP (100 μm) at 0 or 4 h after washing. The response to the second challenge was measured. Statistics—Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. of n ≥ 3 experiments, and were compared by Student's t test, with p < 0.05 considered to be significant. Immunofluorescence images represent n ≥ 3 experiments. PAR2 Traffics to Early Endosomes Containing HRS—As a first step toward examining the role of HRS in post-endocytic trafficking of PAR2, we localized endogenous HRS and overexpressed Myc-HRS in HEK cells by immunofluorescence, and determined whether these proteins were in endosomes. We found that in cells not overexpressing HRS, endogenous immunoreactive HRS was detected in multiple small vesicles containing EEA1, which are thus early endosomes (Fig. 1A). In cells expressing Myc-HRS, antibodies to HRS and Myc both labeled the same vesicles (Fig. 1B). As previously reported, overexpressed HRS was present in enlarged early endosomes (Fig. 1B) (17Hanyaloglu A.C. McCullagh E. von Zastrow M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2265-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus, the HRS antibody specifically recognizes HRS, and HRS is present in early endosomes. To assess the role of HRS in the trafficking of PAR2, we localized endogenous HRS in HEK-PAR2 cells. We observed that in unstimulated cells, PAR2 was detected at the plasma membrane and in a perinuclear location, which we have previously identified as the Golgi apparatus (30Bohm S.K. Khitin L.M.

Madshus I.H. Stang E. Stenmark H. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2002; 4: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). PAR2-AP (100 μm, 30 min) caused internalization of PAR2 into vesicles containing endogenous HRS (Fig. 1C). Thus, activated PAR2 traffics to early endosomes containing HRS. HRS Overexpression Causes Accumulation of PAR2 and c-Cbl in Enlarged Endosomes—The overexpression of HRS disrupts function similarly to HRS knockdown, inducing formation of enlarged endosomes (14Hislop J.N. Marley A. Von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22522-22531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 17Hanyaloglu A.C. McCullagh E. von Zastrow M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2265-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effects of overexpression of HRS on the trafficking of PAR2. HEK cells stably expressing PAR2 were transiently transfected with HRS, and PAR2 and HRS were localized by immunofluorescence. In unstimulated cells, PAR2 was localized to the plasma membrane and also present in enlarged endosomes containing HRS (Fig. 2A). PAR2-AP (30 and 120 min) caused depletion of PAR2 from the plasma membrane and accumulation in enlarged HRS-containing endosomes (Fig. 2A). The E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl ubiquitinates PAR2, and PAR2 agonists induce trafficking of c-Cbl from the cytosol to endosomes containing PAR2 (4Jacob C. Cottrell G.S. Gehringer D. Schmidlin F. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16076-16087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effect of HRS overexpression on trafficking of c-Cbl. In unstimulated HEK-PAR2 cells transiently expressing c-Cbl and HRS, c-Cbl was cytosolic and HRS was present in enlarged endosomes (Fig. 2B). PAR2-AP caused trafficking of c-Cbl to HRS-containing endosomes (Fig. 2B). Thus, activated PAR2 together with c-Cbl traffic to HRS-containing vesicles. The observation that HRS overexpression causes accumulation of unstimulated PAR2 in endosomes suggests constitutive endocytosis of this receptor. To examine this possibility in more detail, and to investigate the effect of HRS expression on trafficking of PAR2 from the plasma membrane to endosomes, we labeled cell-surface PAR2 using an antibody to an extracellular epitope tag (FLAG), and localized EEA1 and endogenous HRS and overexpressed HRS by immunofluorescence. In unstimulated HEK-PAR2 cells transfected with control vector, PAR2 was present at the plasma membrane and endogenous HRS and EEA1 were present in endosomes (Fig. 2, C and D). PAR2-AP (30 min) induced endocytosis of PAR2 an"

The ERK-MAPK pathway can link neuronal activity and cell surface receptor activation to the regulation of gene transcription, and it is often considered the principal mediator of synapse-to-nucleus communication in late-phase plasticity and learning. However, the mechanisms underlying ERK1/2 trafficking in dendrites and nuclear translocation in neurons remain to be determined leaving it unclear whether ERK1/2 activated at the synapse can contribute to nuclear signaling and transcriptional regulation. Using the photobleachable and photoactivable fluorescent tag Dronpa on ERK1 and ERK2, we show here that ERK1/2 translocation to the nucleus of hippocampal neurons is induced by the stimulation of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors or TrkB stimulation and is apparently mediated by facilitated diffusion. In contrast, ERK1/2 trafficking within dendrites is not signal-regulated and is mediated by passive diffusion. Within dendrites, the reach of a locally activated pool of ERK1/2 is very limited and follows an exponential decay with distance. These results indicate that successful signal propagation to the nucleus by the ERK-MAPK pathway depends on the distance of the nucleus from the site of ERK1/2 activation. ERK1/2 activated within or near the soma may rapidly reach the nucleus to induce gene expression, whereas ERK1/2 activated at distal synapses may only contribute to local signaling.

In the nervous system, ERK1 and ERK2 are activated by trophic factors, such as BDNF (1Nakamura T. Sanokawa R. Sasaki Y. Ayusawa D. Oishi M. Mori N. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1111-1121PubMed Google Scholar) and electrical activity causing calcium influx into neurons through NMDA receptors or voltage-gated calcium channels (2Bading H. Greenberg M.E.

A large body of literature has implicated the ERK-MAP kinase pathway in numerous activity-driven neuronal processes, including neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity and learning (4Thomas G.M.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8701-8709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ERK1/2 can act locally near the site of activation by cell surface receptors or ion channels to control, for example, the trafficking of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (9Zhu J.J. Qin Y. Zhao M. Van Aelst L. Malinow R. Cell. 2002; 110: 443-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Another putative role of ERK1/2 in the nervous system is to propagate signals generated at the synapse along the dendrites toward and into the cell nucleus, where it leads to induction of gene transcription. ERK1/2 can phosphorylate several transcription factors, including the ternary complex factors Elk-1 (10Gille H. Kortenjann M. Thomae O. Moomaw C. Slaughter C. Cobb M.H. Shaw P.E.

The cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) is also a target of the ERK-MAP kinase pathway, although CREB phosphorylation on its activator site serine 133 is catalyzed not by ERK1/2 but by the ERK1/2-regulated kinases ribosomal protein S6 kinase 2 and mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1) (15Xing J.

Despite the evidence for ERK1/2 functions in neuronal signal propagation and gene regulation in the brain, little is known about the mechanisms that mediate trafficking and nuclear translocation of ERK1/2 in neurons. To phosphorylate transcription factors, ERK1/2 have to propagate to the cell nucleus from the site of activation, which in the case of synaptic activity is the submembranous space in the immediate vicinity of synaptic NMDA receptors (19Hardingham G.E. Arnold F.J. Bading H. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 565-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Long distance communication may be accomplished by active transport or a diffusion process, but it could also involve signaling endosomes, similar to what has been described for nerve growth factor-induced retrograde ERK1/2 signaling in axons (20Howe C.L. Mobley W.C. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2005; 15: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 21Delcroix J.D. Valletta J.S. Wu C. Hunt S.J. Kowal A.S. Mobley W.C. Neuron. 2003; 39: 69-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 22Reynolds A.J. Hendry I.A. Bartlett S.E. Neuroscience. 2001; 105: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It is also possible that ERK1/2 activated at the synapse remain spatially confined, acting only locally. In this scenario gene induction only takes place if neuronal activity triggers a burst of action potentials causing global activation of ERK1/2 throughout the neuron, which subsequently enters the nucleus to phosphorylate transcription factors (23Adams J.P. Dudek S.M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 737-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The mechanism of ERK1/2 translocation to the nucleus is also unclear. Evidence for an active nuclear import mechanism came from experiments in which inhibitors of active import such as wheat germ agglutinin or Ran inhibitors were introduced by microinjection or digitonin-mediated permeabilization into non-neuronal cell lines such as HeLa or NIH-3T3 cells (24Costa M.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5347-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Other experiments in HeLa cells or HEK-293 cells are consistent with ERK1/2 diffusing into the nucleus (26Adachi M. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5347-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 27Burack W.R. Shaw A.S. J. Biol.

To investigate trafficking and nuclear translocation of ERK1/2 in neurons is particularly important because of the large distances from the site of ERK1/2 activation at synapses and dendrites to the cell nucleus and the physiological relevance of this process for plasticity and learning. We considered three possible mechanisms through which ERK1/2 can enter the nucleus. The first is passive diffusion, which requires no energy, adaptor molecules, or contact with the nuclear pore and is not blocked at low temperatures (i.e. 4 °C). The second mechanism is facilitated diffusion, which is energy-independent and requires contact of the protein with phenylalanine-glycine-rich protrusions in the nuclear pore. Proteins that exceed a molecular mass of about 50 kDa cannot pass the nuclear pore by passive diffusion within a time range of hours (29Talcott B. Moore M.S. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 312-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 30Paine P.L. Moore L.C. Horowitz S.B. Nature. 1975; 254: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 31Peters R. Lang I. Scholz M. Schulz B. Kayne F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1986; 14: 821-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However, proteins of this size can enter the nucleus within minutes by traversing the nuclear pore via facilitated diffusion (32Kose S. Imamoto N. Tachibana T. Shimamoto T. Yoneda Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 841-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The third mechanism is the RanGDP/GTP-mediated active import, which is dependent upon the presence of a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and requires importins (33Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). The literature on the mechanism of ERK1/2 nuclear translocation in non-neuronal cells is controversial; diffusion processes have been proposed as well as active transport (see above), although the identification of an NLS within ERK1 or ERK2 has not been reported. Here we investigated the dendritic trafficking and nuclear translocation of ERK1/2 in hippocampal neurons using ERK1 and ERK2 labeled with a recently developed photobleachable and photoactivable tag (34Ando R. Mizuno H. Miyawaki A. Science. 2004; 306: 1370-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). ERK1/2 were activated either by treatment of the neurons with BDNF, which stimulates the BDNF receptor, TrkB, or by inducing action potential bursting. The latter stimulation paradigm strongly activates synaptic NMDA receptors and induces a transcription-dependent form of neuronal network plasticity akin to long term potentiation (35Arnold F.J. Hofmann F. Bengtson C.P. Wittmann M. Vanhoutte P. Bading H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 564: 3-19Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The results obtained in this study show that propagation of ERK1/2 within dendrites is not signal-regulated and occurs through passive diffusion; signal-induced ERK1/2 nuclear translocation is not mediated by an active transport mechanism but by facilitated diffusion. Plasmids—The following plasmids were used: ERK2-GFP and RFP-MEK1 plasmids obtained from J. S. Stork, Vollum Institute for Advanced Biomedical Research, L474, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR; plasmids for ERK1-Dronpa or Dronpa obtained from A. Miyawaki, Laboratory for Cell Function and Dynamics, Advanced Technology Development Group, Brain Science Institute, Hirosawa, Japan; MEK1-Dronpa plasmid obtained from M. Matsuda, Department of Signal Transduction, Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University, Yamadaoka, Suita-shi, Osaka, Japan. To generate ERK2-Dronpa, cDNA encoding rat ERK2 was amplified using PCR. At the 5′ end a start codon was introduced as well as a BamHI restriction site, which was located upstream of the ATG sequence. The following primer was designed for the sense direction: 5′-ATAGGATCCTACAAGTCCGGACTCATGTCTCGAGCG-3′. At the 3′ end we removed the stop codon and generated a NotI restriction site using the following antisense primer: 5′-TCATATGCGGCCGCAAGATCTGTATCCTGGCTGGAA-3′. The resulting DNA was digested using BamHI and NotI and subcloned into a pcDNA3.1 vector containing ERK1-Dronpa replacing ERK1. To generate MBP-Dronpa, the same approach as described for ERK2-Dronpa was used. The primer sequences were 5′-CGCGTCGCGGATCCATGAAAATCGAAGAA-3′ (sense direction) and 5′-TAAGTATAGCGGCCGCGGGCTTCATCGACAGT-3′ (antisense). To generate ERK2-Dronpa-NLS, the ERK2-Dronpa construct was amplified using PCR. An NheI restriction site was generated at the 5′ end upstream of the start codon. At the 3′ end we introduced a BspEI site. The following primers were used to generate the new restriction sites: sense direction, 5′-ATATGCTAGCTACAAGTCAGGACTCATGTCTCGAGCG-3′; antisense direction, 5′-ATATTTCCGGACTTGGCCTGCCTCGGCAGCTCAGAAT-3′. The insert was subcloned into a pEYFP-Nuc vector (Clontech). Digesting the vector with NheI and BspEI removed the EYFP-Nuc gene but not the triple NLS segment. ERK2-Dronpa was ligated into the vector N-terminal of the NLS sequence. Cell Culture and DNA Transfection—Primary hippocampal neurons from newborn Long-Evans or Sprague-Dawley rats were dissociated and plated on poly-d-lysine/laminin (BD Biosciences)-coated 12-mm coverslips or 35-mm plastic dishes (Nunc) as described by Bading and Greenberg (2Bading H. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1991; 253: 912-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) except that the growth medium was supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen). The cells were grown for 8 days in growth medium. After 3 days in culture, 2.4 μm cytosine d-arabinofuranoside (Sigma) was added to each dish to prevent proliferation of non-neuronal cells. On day 8 of in vitro culturing, growth medium was replaced with transfection medium, which consisted of a salt/glucose/glycine solution and minimum Eagle's medium (9:1; v/v) plus sodium selenite 10 μg/ml, insulin 15 μg/ml, transferrin 8.25 μg/ml, and penicillin-streptomycin 0.5%. Salt/glucose/glycine solution is as follows (in mm): NaCl 114, NaHCO3 26, KCl 5.3, MgCl2 1, CaCl2 2, HEPES 10, glycine 1, glucose 30, sodium pyruvate 0.5, phenol red 0.2%. DNA transfection was done on day 10 after plating using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) at 5 μl/ml in transfection medium without penicillin-streptomycin. The total DNA concentration was 1.6 μg/μl. The Lipofectamine/DNA mixture was left on the cells for 3 h before it was replaced with transfection medium. Cells were left for an additional 36-48 h before analysis. Confocal Imaging—All live imaging experiments were done at 37 °C unless stated otherwise. We used a confocal laser scanning microscope TCS SP2 (Leica, Mannheim, Germany) equipped with an inverted fluorescence microscope DM IRE2 (Leica) and Leica confocal scan software. In all imaging experiments gray levels were not saturated. Images represented under “Results” were scaled to enhance contrast and artificially colored by adapting the look-up table to the color of the corresponding fluorescent tag for better representation. Coverslips containing cultured neurons were transferred into a custommade metal chamber and mounted on the microscope stage. The chamber was filled with a CO2-independent salt glucose glycine medium which consisted of the following (in mm): NaCl 140, KCl 5.29, MgCl2 1, CaCl2 2, HEPES 10, Glycine 1, Glucose 30, sodium pyruvate 0.5. Drugs were directly applied to the chamber. For experiments done at 37 °C, we used a heater (Life Imaging Services) to warm the air within a box (Life Imaging Services) enclosing the microscope stage. Room temperature was 22 °C. For experiments at 10 °C the perfused medium was chilled in a custom-built heat exchanger immediately before it reached the coverslip. The temperature of the medium on the coverslip was monitored. For all experiments a 40× oil immersion fluorescence objective (Leica HCX PL APO) was used. Stimulations were done either with BDNF (100 ng/ml; Pepro-Tech) or bicuculline methiodide (50 μm; Sigma). Imaging of ERK2-GFP—To visualize nuclear translocation of ERK2-GFP, time-lapse experiments were performed in neurons co-transfected with plasmids encoding ERK2-GFP and RFP-MEK1. Parallel scans of the RFP channel and the GFP channel were performed once per min over a time period of 45 min. Optical sections were 0.2 μm thick. Images were saved as 8-bit TIFF files with a resolution of 512 × 512 pixels, and analysis was done using ImageJ. FRAP Experiments Using Dronpa Probes—The Dronpa signal was fully photoactivated in the whole cell using a 364 nm UV laser. The laser intensity was set to 30%, and the time of exposure was ∼250 ms. A 45 × 22.5 μm area containing the soma was magnified ×8. To analyze nuclear recovery of the Dronpa probes, their fluorescence in the nucleus was fully photobleached within 3 s using the 488-nm laser line at 30% of maximal intensity. Immediately after bleaching, a 10-min time series was acquired taking one image every 30 s. The intensity of the 488 nm laser was at 1-2% of maximum to minimize bleaching of the signal. Dendritic Trafficking of ERK1/2-Dronpa—The Dronpa signal of the whole cell was bleached to a minimum using the 488-nm laser line at 30% of maximal intensity within 10-15 s. Dendritic segments that were imaged were entirely in focus, at least 60 μm distal from the soma and spanned a distance of 90 μm. One 100-ms pulse of the 364-nm laser line at 30% of maximal power was used to reactivate the Dronpa signal in a 10-μm long area at the center of this dendritic segment. Immediately thereafter, images of Dronpa were acquired every 5 s using an excitation laser line of 488 nm at an intensity of 1-2% of maximum. The kinetics were measured at all time points by analyzing the intensities of the average Dronpa fluorescence signal at nine different regions of interest in the dendrite defined as 10-μm segments from the reactivated area. Immunoblotting—Phosphorylation of ERK1/2, ERK2-GFP, and ERK1/2-Dronpa was measured by immunoblotting using antibodies to the phosphorylated form of ERK1/2 (rabbit polyclonal or mouse monoclonal antibody; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) as described previously (19Hardingham G.E. Arnold F.J. Bading H. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 565-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 36Hardingham G.E. Chawla S. Cruzalegui F.H. Bading H. Neuron. 1999; 22: 789-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 37Hardingham G.E. Arnold F.J. Bading H. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). MBP-Dronpa was detected using a mouse monoclonal antibody against MBP (Lab Vision Corp.). Immunoblot analysis of endogenous calmodulin (monoclonal mouse-anti calmodulin antibody, Upstate Biotechnology) or tubulin (Sigma) expression was used to control for protein loading. Immunocytochemistry—Cells were fixed with a paraformaldehyde/sucrose (4%:4%) solution. After fixation, cells were permeabilized with a methanol/acetone mixture (50:50 v/v) or with Triton X-100 (0.3%) in PBS/Tween (0.1%). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 10% normal goat serum. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (rabbit, polyclonal; 1:200; Cell Signaling), anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (mouse, monoclonal; 1:200; Cell Signaling), anti-ERK1/2 (rabbit, polyclonal; 1:50; Cell Signaling), and anti-phospho-MSK1 (rabbit, polyclonal; 1:400; Cell Signaling). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-, Alexa 633-, or Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used for secondary detection. Hoechst 33258 (Serva) was used for nuclear staining. Data Analysis—All data quoted under “Results” and plotted in graphs and histograms represent the means ± S.E. One-way analysis of variance with Tukey's post hoc test was used for all statistical analyses. All fluorescence data were background subtracted. Phosphorylation and Nuclear Translocation of Endogenous ERK1/2—To activate ERK1/2, cultured rat hippocampal neurons were either treated with the neurotrophin BDNF or exposed to the γ-aminobutyric acid, type A, receptor antagonist bicuculline. Bicuculline causes the neurons to periodically fire bursts of action potentials (APs) synchronized with bursts of glutamatergic synaptic activity, which together strongly activate synaptic NMDA receptors and cause robust increases in the intracellular calcium concentration (19Hardingham G.E. Arnold F.J. Bading H. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 565-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 35Arnold F.J. Hofmann F. Bengtson C.P. Wittmann M. Vanhoutte P. Bading H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 564: 3-19Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The induction of AP bursting was verified via electrophysiological recordings from cultured hippocampal neurons in the presence of bicuculline (supplemental Fig. 1A). Bursts of synaptic activity involving NMDA receptor activation are necessary for transcription-dependent hippocampal long term potentiation and memory (35Arnold F.J. Hofmann F. Bengtson C.P. Wittmann M. Vanhoutte P. Bading H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 564: 3-19Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 38Nguyen P.V. Abel T. Kandel E.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1104-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 39Morris R.G. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 3040-3057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the bicuculline protocol in hippocampal cultures induces a form of long lasting network plasticity that is dependent upon gene transcription, mRNA translation, and MAP kinase signaling (35Arnold F.J. Hofmann F. Bengtson C.P. Wittmann M. Vanhoutte P. Bading H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 564: 3-19Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In addition, a whole genome transcriptome analysis revealed that within 2-4 h after bicuculline-induced AP bursting, several hundred genes change their expression levels (40Zhang S.J. Steijaert M.N. Lau D. Schutz G. Delucinge-Vivier C. Descombes P. Bading H. Neuron. 2007; 53: 549-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). We first investigated whether both stimulation paradigms (i.e. BDNF treatment or induction of AP bursting using bicuculline) are suitable to produce physiologically relevant levels of enzymatic active endogenous phospho-ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) in the cytoplasm and, more importantly, in the nucleus. Western blot experiments using a phospho-specific ERK1/2 antibody showed that either stimulation paradigm induced phosphorylation of rat ERK1/2 at both the threonine and tyrosine residue within the conserved TEY motif, which is indicative of stimulation of ERK1/2 enzymatic activities (Fig. 1, A and B, and supplementary Fig. 2). To investigate whether these levels of pERK1/2 are sufficient to yield activated ERK1/2 in the nucleus, we analyzed MSK1, a nuclear protein kinase that is activated upon phosphorylation of Thr-581 and Ser-360. This phosphorylation event is catalyzed by ERK1/2, and the p38 MAP kinase and can be readily detected using a phospho-MSK1-specific antibody. To selectively determine the contribution of ERK1/2 to MSK1 activation, we analyzed MSK1 activation in the presence of the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580. We found that both AP bursting and BDNF treatment generated a robust phospho-MSK1 (pMSK1) signal in the absence of p38 MAP kinase activity, which is blocked in the presence of the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (supplemental Fig. 2). We next used immunocytochemistry to test whether pERK1/2 indeed signals to the nucleus. After 30 min of stimulation with either BDNF or bicuculline, a fraction of pERK1/2 appears in the nucleus. Similar to the results obtained using the Western blot analysis (see supplemental Fig. 2A), the appearance of the nuclear pMSK1 signal was blocked if the stimulation was done in the presence of both SB203580 and PD98059 but not in the presence of SB203580 (supplemental Fig. 2B). These results indicate that both the BDNF and the bicuculline stimulation paradigms used in this study are suitable to generate physiological relevant levels of endogenous nuclear pERK1/2 that are sufficient to activate MSK1, a downstream target of ERK1/2 signaling. We next did immunocytochemical experiments to determine the localization of pERK1/2 and ERK1/2 at various times after stimulation. At early time points (i.e. 2 and 5 min) after stimulation ERK1/2 as well as pERK1/2 are predominantly localized to the cytoplasm. The nuclear fraction of pERK1/2 increased with time after stimulation reaching a maximum after ∼30 min (Fig. 1B). However, a large proportion of pERK1/2 remained cytoplasmic and was distributed throughout the entire neuron, including the distal areas of the dendrites (data not shown). For both stimulation paradigms, the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic pERK1/2 signal (n/c ratio of average absolute 8 bit gray levels from confocal images) reached a plateau of about 1.2 at the 30- and 60-min time points (Fig. 1C, left panel). This indicates that pERK1/2 was slightly enriched in the nucleus following stimulation and may have surpassed concentration equilibrium. We observed that pMSK1 immunoreactivity was only slightly elevated after 2 and 5 min of stimulation and that it reached a maximum after 30 min of either AP bursting or BDNF stimulation (data not shown). The kinetics of MSK1 phosphorylation match those of nuclear enrichment of pERK1/2. In contrast to pERK, the n/c ratio of ERK1/2 did not exceed 1 after stimulus-induced nuclear translocation (Fig. 1C, right panel). The difference in the n/c ratios of pERK and ERK may be due to the presence of dephosphorylated ERK1/2 in the cytoplasm but not the nucleus. This fraction of dephosphorylated ERK1/2 is not seen in the pERK1/2 stainin"
https://openalex.org/W2054469649,"Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), such as trichostatin A (TSA), can regulate gene expression by promoting acetylation of histones and transcription factors. Human tissue factor (TF) expression is partly governed by a unique, NF-κB-related “TF-κB” promoter binding site. We find that TSA and four other HDACi (apicidin, MS-275, sodium butyrate, and valproic acid) all inhibit by ∼90% TF activity and protein level induction in human umbilical vein endothelial cells stimulated by the physiologic agonists tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin-1β, lipopolysaccharide, and HOSCN without affecting expression of the NF-κB-regulated adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and E-selectin. TSA and butyrate also blunt TF induction ∼50% in vitro in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in vivo in thioglycolate-elicited murine peritoneal macrophages. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells, TSA attenuates by ∼70% TNF-α stimulation of TF mRNA transcription without affecting that of ICAM-1. By electrophoretic mobility shift assay analyses, TNF-α and lipopolysaccharide induce strong p65/p50 and p65/c-Rel heterodimer binding to both NF-κB and TF-κB probes. TSA nearly abolishes TF-κB binding without affecting NF-κB binding. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and a promoter-luciferase reporter system confirm that TSA inhibits TF-κB but not NF-κB activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and small interfering RNA inhibitor studies demonstrate that HDAC3 plays a significant role in TNF-α-mediated TF induction. Thus, HDACi transcriptionally inhibit agonist-induced TF expression in endothelial cells and monocytes by a TF-κB- and HDAC3-dependent mechanism. We conclude that histone deacetylases, particularly HDAC3, play a hitherto unsuspected role in regulating TF expression and raise the possibility that HDACi might be a novel therapy for thrombotic disorders.

Circulation. 2006; 113: 722-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). In addition to its pivotal role in hemostasis and thrombosis, TF-dependent signaling also participates in the processes of inflammation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and cell migration (3Mackman N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 1015-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). TF gene expression is regulated mainly at the transcriptional level (4Mackman N. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 747-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Diverse biologic stimuli, such as bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide; LPS), inflammatory cytokines (e.g. tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-1β), growth factors (e.g. vascular endothelial growth factor), oxidized and acetylated low density lipoproteins, hypoxia, shear stress, and oxidants (5Wang J.G. Mahmud S.A. Thompson J.A. Geng J.G. Key N.S. Slungaard A. Blood. 2006; 107: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) induce TF expression in endothelial cells and monocytes. These agonists activate several signal transduction pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and protein kinase C (2Steffel J. Luscher T.F. Tanner F.C. Circulation. 2006; 113: 722-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The human TF gene promoter contains binding sites for activator protein-1 (AP-1), epidermal growth response-1 (Egr-1), and specificity protein-1 (SP-1) transcription factors and has an NF-κB-like “TF-κB” sequence that binds members of the NF-κB family, including p65/p50 and p65/c-Rel (4Mackman N. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 747-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In monocytes, SP-1 sites contribute to the constitutive expression of base-line TF, whereas the AP-1, Egr-1, and TF-κB sites mediate inducible TF expression (6Oeth P. Parry G.C. Mackman N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In endothelial cells, constitutive AP-1 and inducible TF-κB activation mediate TF induction by LPS, TNF-α, IL-1β (7Parry G.C. Mackman N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 612-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), and, as we have recently shown, the principal phagocyte peroxidase-derived oxidant, HOSCN (5Wang J.G. Mahmud S.A. Thompson J.A.

Specific reversible histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), such as trichostatin A (TSA) and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, were originally described to mediate acetylation of chromatin-associated histones and thereby open promoter loci to permit interaction with transcription factors to promote gene expression. However, more recent studies show that HDACi can also promote acetylation of transcription factors, including the p50 and p65 subunits of NF-κB (8Chen L.F. Greene W.C. J. Mol.

These findings led us to hypothesize that inhibition of HDAC activity by HDACi would, through inhibition of TF-κB activation, suppress the expression of tissue factor in agonist-stimulated endothelial cells and monocytes. We tested the effect of five HDACi (TSA, apicidin, MS-275, sodium butyrate, and valproic acid) on TF expression induced by the physiologic agonists LPS, TNF-α, IL-1β, and HOSCN. We find that HDACi potently inhibit agonist-induced TF activity in human endothelial cells and monocytes through specific blockade of TF-κB activation. TSA also suppresses murine macrophage TF activity induction in vitro and decreases peritoneal macrophage TF activity in an in vivo mouse peritonitis model. Our results suggest that HDAC3 plays an unanticipated and pivotal role in regulating TF expression and suggest that HDACi might be a novel therapy for thrombotic diseases. Reagents—Trichostatin A (T8552), lipopolysaccharide (Escherichia coli 055:B5), sodium butyrate (B5887), PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate), and protease inhibitor mixture (P8340) were from Sigma.

Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cell (HUVEC) Culture—HUVEC were isolated from umbilical cords and cultured as previously described (23Balla J. Jacob H.S. Balla G. Nath K. Eaton J.W. Vercellotti G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9285-9289Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). HUVEC were used for experiments at passage 2 or 3. Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell (PBMC) Preparation—Fresh human blood was collected from healthy, adult volunteers after their informed consent into acid-citrate-dextrose (38 mm citric acid, 75 mm trisodium citrate, and 100 mm dextrose; 1:7 acid-citrate-dextrose final concentration). After removal of platelet-rich plasma by centrifugation of the whole blood at 100 × g at 22 °C for 15 min, the cell pellet was diluted with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline to original blood volume and layered onto the same volume of HISTOPAQUE®-1077 (catalog number 1077-1; Sigma) and centrifuged at 400 × g at 22 °C for 30 min (24Wang J.G. Mahmud S.A. Nguyen J. Slungaard A. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 8714-87122Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The supernatant and interface were collected and washed twice by phosphate-buffered saline. The PBMC were resuspended in RPMI medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h before use. One-stage Clotting TF Activity Assay—Confluent HUVEC monolayers or PBMC were pretreated with TSA (0.01–1 μm) for 4 h and then stimulated by either 1 μg/ml LPS, 1 ng/ml TNF-α, 1 ng/ml IL-1β, or 100 μm reagent HOSCN for another 4 h. Tissue factor activity was detected by a one-stage clotting assay standardized against recombinant human TF as described before (5Wang J.G. Mahmud S.A. Thompson J.A. Geng J.G. Key N.S. Slungaard A.

Alternatively, HUVEC were treated with increasing doses of apicidin, MS-275, sodium butyrate, or valporic acid and then stimulated by LPS and TNF-α for another 4 h before assaying TF activity. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) and maximal inhibition were calculated from the inhibition curve. Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Confluent HUVEC monolayers were pretreated with 1 μm TSA for 4 h and then stimulated by 1 ng/ml TNF-α for 1 or 2 h. Total cellular RNA was isolated, and reverse transcription-PCR was performed as previously described (5Wang J.G. Mahmud S.A. Thompson J.A. Geng J.G. Key N.S. Slungaard A.

Specific primers were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA): long tissue factor, sense (5′-GGCACTACAAATACTGTGGCAGCA-3′) and antisense (5′-ACTCTTCCGGTTAACTGTTCGGGA-3′); full-length tissue factor, sense (5′-CGCCGCCAACTGGTAGAC-3′) and antisense (5′-TGCAGTAGCTCCAACAGTGC-3′); ICAM-1, sense (5′-CAGTGACCATCTACAGCTTTCCGG-3′) and antisense (5′-GCTGCTACCACAGTGATGATGACAA-3′). PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis loading 10-μl aliquots on 1.2% agarose gels. Gels were stained with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide and imaged with ultraviolet transillumination. Nuclear Protein Extraction—Monolayers of HUVEC were pretreated 4 h with 0.3 or 1.0 μm TSA and then stimulated by 1 ng/ml TNF-α for 30 min, and nuclear protein was prepared with a nuclear extract kit (Panomics) according to the manufacturer's instructions and stored at -80 °C until use. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—NF-κB consensus (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′) and NF-κB mutant (5′-AGTTGAGGCGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′) and SP-1 consensus (5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′) and SP-1 mutant (5′-ATTCGATCGGTTCGGGGCGAGC-3′) oligonucleotides were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.

(Coralville, IA). Oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Biosciences). Five μg of nuclear extract was loaded per lane (10 μg for the TF-κB probe), and EMSA was carried out as described (5Wang J.G. Mahmud S.A. Thompson J.A. Geng J.G. Key N.S. Slungaard A. Blood. 2006; 107: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis of TF—HUVEC monolayers were pretreated with TSA and stimulated by agonists as described above (see “One-stage Clotting TF Activity Assay”). Whole cell lysates were prepared and analyzed on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and for nuclear extracts on 12% gels. Western blot analysis was performed as described before (5Wang J.G. Mahmud S.A. Thompson J.A. Geng J.G. Key N.S. Slungaard A.

ChIP Assay—HUVEC monolayers were pretreated with Me2SO or TSA (0.3 or 1 μm) for 4 h and then stimulated with 1 ng/ml TNF-α for 0.5 h. HUVEC monolayers were fixed by adding formaldehyde directly to the medium to a final concentration of 1% and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. ChIP assay was performed according to the kit instructions. Immunoprecipitations were carried out at 4 °C overnight with 4 μg of rabbit IgG or rabbit polyclonal antibodies against p65 (sc-372), HDAC1 (sc-7872), HDAC2 (sc-7899), or HDAC3 (sc-11417) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). About one-third of the immunoprecipitated DNA was used in each PCR (25Nandiwada S.L. Li W. Zhang R. Mueller D.L. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 401-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).

HUVEC Transfection and Luciferase Promoter Assay—The human TF wild-type promoter (-227 to +121) and the TF-κB mutant (5′-CGGAGTTTCC-3′ → 5′-CGGAGTTAGA-3′) reporter plasmid in pGL2 basic were provided by Dr. Nigel Mackman (6Oeth P. Parry G.C. Mackman N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). The ICAM-1 wild-type luciferase reporter plasmid (26Rahman A. Anwar K.N. True A.L. Malik A.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5466-5476PubMed Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. Asrar B. Malik (University of Illinois College of Medicine, Chicago, IL). HUVEC were plated into 6-well plates 12–18 h before transfection. Transfections of HUVEC were performed using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, reporter DNA (1 μg) was mixed with 1.5 μl of Lipofectamine in 200 μl of Opti-MEM reduced serum medium. The DNA-Lipofectamine complexes were incubated with HUVEC for 4 h at 37 °C in the 5% CO2 incubator and then replaced with growth medium. After 36 h, cells were pretreated with an Me2SO solvent control or TSA (30, 100, or 300 nm) for 2 h, followed by stimulation with 10 μg/ml LPS, 10 ng/ml TNF-α, or 50 nm PMA for another 6 h. Cell lysates were assayed for luciferase activities using the luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). The pCMVβ vector (BD Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was cotransfected so that the transfection efficiencies could be normalized with the β-galactosidase activities determined using a luminescent β-galactosidase detection kit II (BD Clontech) (27Xia Y.F.

HUVEC Transfection and RNA Interference—siRNA duplexes for human HDAC2 (sc-29345) and HDAC3 (sc-35538) and a scrambled control (sc-37007, causing no specific degradation of any known cellular mRNA) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. siRNA transfection was performed following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, HUVEC were plated at 2 × 105 cells in a 6-well cell culture plate. HUVEC were incubated with 45 nm siRNA/9 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) mixture in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) medium for 5 h at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 incubator and then replaced with growth medium (28Inoue K.

TF activity of HUVEC lysates was assayed by a one-stage clotting assay, and protein levels of HDAC3, HDAC2, TF, and ICAM-1 were detected by Western blot using specific antibodies against human HDAC3, HDAC2, TF, and ICAM-1. Alternatively, cells were stimulated by TNF-α for 0.5 h, and a ChIP assay was conducted as described above using specific antibodies against HDAC2 and HDAC3. Murine Macrophage TF Activity Measurement—Male mice (C57 Bl/6J, 25–30 g body weight) were injected intraperitoneally with 2 ml of 4% thioglycolate medium. Three days later, peritoneal macrophages were harvested by peritoneal lavage using 10 ml of sterile Hanks' balanced salt solution buffer supplemented with 5 mm EDTA. Lavage fluids were pooled and centrifuged at 200 × g for 10 min. The cell pellet was washed once in sterile Hanks' balanced salt solution, and red blood cells were lysed in 10 ml of ice-cold sterile water followed by adding 10 ml of 2× Hanks' balanced salt solution after 30 s (29Brisseau G.F.

This suspension was pelleted, resuspended in RPMI (10% fetal bovine serum), and counted using a hemocytometer. Lavage leukocytes were diluted in RPMI medium (1–2 × 106 cells/ml), aliquoted into 6-well plates, and then incubated (37 °C and 5% CO2) overnight. The next day, nonadherent cells were washed away, and adherent macrophages were overlaid with fresh RPMI medium. Macrophages were pretreated with 0.3 or 1 μm TSA for 4 h before stimulation with 10 μg/ml LPS, 20 ng/ml human TNF-α or IL-1β for 5 h. Macrophage TF activity in whole cell lysates was detected by a one-stage clotting assay, as described before (5Wang J.G. Mahmud S.A. Thompson J.A. Geng J.G. Key N.S. Slungaard A.

In an additional three control animals, saline rather than thiogycolate was injected intraperitoneal without TSA or Me2SO treatment. Mice were given a second intraperitoneal injection of TSA or Me2SO at day 2 and sacrificed at day 3. Peritoneal cavities were lavaged, and total leukocytes were enumerated and identified as described before (24Wang J.G. Mahmud S.A. Nguyen J. Slungaard A. J.

This model generates leukocytes with a cell population that was 65–75% macrophages, the remainder equally split between lymphocytes and neutrophils. Total TF activity in whole cell lysates was detected by a one-stage clotting assay and normalized to macrophage cell number. TSA Inhibits Agonist-induced TF Activity and Protein Expression in Human Endothelial Cells—HDACi induces apoptosis in many cancer cells with little or no toxicity for primary untransformed cells (30Marks P.A.

We found that ≤1 μm TSA has no significant effect on the viability of HUVEC as detected by trypan blue staining after a 24-h treatment (data not shown). For our studies, we chose doses and treatment times similar to those previously used successfully to investigate the influence of TSA on endothelial NO synthase expression and angiogenesis in HUVEC in vitro (15Rossig L.

Nat Med. 2001; 7: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). We first assessed the effect of the TSA on agonist-stimulated TF expression in HUVEC. HUVEC were pretreated with TSA (10 nm to 1 μm) for 4 h and then stimulated by LPS, TNF-α, IL-1β, or HOSCN for another 4 h. HUVEC lysates were then assayed for TF activity by a one-stage clotting assay (Fig. 1), and whole cell detergent lysates were probed for TF protein by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 1, 1 μg/ml LPS (Fig. 1A), 1 ng/ml TNF-α (Fig. 1B), 1 ng/ml IL-1β (Fig. 1C), or 100 μm HOSCN (Fig. 1D) all induced TF activity 25–1000-fold, as expected. TSA treatment inhibited by up to 90% TF induction by all four agonists in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 20–50 nm. In data not shown, TSA had no significant effect upon base-line TF expression in nonstimulated HUVEC. Western blot analysis of TF protein (Fig. 2) confirms the pronounced inhibition by TSA of agonist-induced TF expression. In contrast, as previously reported (28Inoue K. Kobayashi M. Yano K. Miura M.

This phenomenon was reproduced using four other HDACi (apicidin, MS-275, sodium butyrate, and valproic acid) in LPS- and TNF-α-stimulated HUVEC (Table 1). The IC50 of TSA is much less than that of the other four HDACi, reflecting their relative potencies as HDAC inhibitors (35Park J.H. Jung Y. Kim T.Y. Kim S.G. Jong H.S. Lee J.W. Kim D.K. Lee J.S.

We therefore chose TSA as a prototype to investigate HDACi effects on monocyte/macrophage TF expression and elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind HDACi suppression of agonist-driven TF expression.FIGURE 2TSA suppresses TF protein expression of agonist-stimulated HUVEC. HUVEC monolayers were treated with 0.01–1 μm TSA for 4 h and then exposed to 1 μg/ml LPS (A), 1 ng/ml TNF-α (B), 1 ng/ml IL-1β (C), or 100 μm HOSCN (D) for another 4 h.

https://openalex.org/W2023501279,"The vertebrate brain is anatomically and functionally asymmetric; however, the molecular mechanisms that establish left-right brain patterning are largely unknown. In zebrafish, asymmetric left-sided Nodal signaling within the developing dorsal diencephalon is required for determining the direction of epithalamic asymmetries. Here, we show that Six3, a transcription factor essential for forebrain formation and associated with holoprosencephaly in humans, regulates diencephalic Nodal activity during initial establishment of brain asymmetry. Reduction of Six3 function causes brain-specific deregulation of Nodal pathway activity, resulting in epithalamic laterality defects. Based on misexpression and genetic epistasis experiments, we propose that Six3 acts in the neuroectoderm to establish a prepattern of bilateral repression of Nodal activity. Subsequently, Nodal signaling from the left lateral plate mesoderm alleviates this repression ipsilaterally. Our data reveal a Six3-dependent mechanism for establishment of correct brain laterality and provide an entry point to understanding the genetic regulation of Nodal signaling in the brain."

We show that exposure of L6 myotubes overexpressing human insulin receptors to 25 mm glucose for 5 min decreased the intracellular levels of diacylglycerol (DAG). This was paralleled by transient activation of diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) and of insulin receptor signaling. Following 30-min exposure, however, both DAG levels and DGK activity returned close to basal levels. Moreover, the acute effect of glucose on DAG removal was inhibited by >85% by the DGK inhibitor R59949. DGK inhibition was also accompanied by increased protein kinase C-α (PKCα) activity, reduced glucose-induced insulin receptor activation, and GLUT4 translocation. Glucose exposure transiently redistributed DGK isoforms α and δ, from the prevalent cytosolic localization to the plasma membrane fraction. However, antisense silencing of DGKδ, but not of DGKα expression, was sufficient to prevent the effect of high glucose on PKCα activity, insulin receptor signaling, and glucose uptake. Thus, the short term exposure of skeletal muscle cells to glucose causes a rapid induction of DGK, followed by a reduction of PKCα activity and transactivation of the insulin receptor signaling. The latter may mediate, at least in part, glucose induction of its own metabolism.

On the other hand, evidence exists indicating that glucose acutely activates its own utilization, both in vitro and in vivo (11Capaldo B. Kim D. Riccardi G. Pernotti N. Sacca L. J. Clin.

Subsequently, it has been shown that acute hyperglycemia per se may increase muscle membrane content of GLUT4 (12Galante P. Kim L. Kellerer M. Berti L. Tippmer S. Bossenmaier B. Fujiwara T. Okuno A.

Med. 2001; 12: 945-959Crossref Scopus (276) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanisms of the short term autoregulatory effect have been only partially elucidated. In a previous work we have shown that, in a skeletal muscle cell model, acute exposure to increasing glucose concentrations determined a parallel increase in glucose uptake and its intracellular metabolism (13Caruso M. Kim C. Oriente F. Maitan M.A. Bifulco G. Andreozzi F. Condorelli G. Formisano P. Beguinot F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28637-28644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Glucose autoregulation involves PKCα retrotranslocation from the membrane to the cytoplasm and dissociation from the IR. This is followed by the transient trans-activation of the IR tyrosine kinase and a consequent induction of glucose uptake (13Caruso M. Kim C. Oriente F. Maitan M.A. Bifulco G. Andreozzi F. Condorelli G. Formisano P. Beguinot F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28637-28644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, how glucose acutely modulates PKCα remains to be investigated. The regulation of DAG intracellular levels by acute hyperglycemia represents an attractive hypothesis. DAG is a lipid second messenger with important signaling functions (3Shmueli E. Kim K.G. Record C.O. J. Intern. Med. 1993; 234: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 15Nolte L.A. Kim J. Wahlstrom E.O. Craig B.W. Zierath J.R. Wallberg-Henriksson H. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 1345-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Generation and removal of diacylglycerol are indeed critical for different intracellular signaling pathways (16Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1984; 308: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (5760) Google Scholar, 17Hou W. Kim Y. Morisset J. Cell.. Signal. 1996; 8: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 18Bagnato C. Kim R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52203-52211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In response to many extracellular stimuli DAG is generated through the action of phospholipases (mainly PLC and PLD) (17Hou W. Kim Y. Morisset J. Cell.. Signal. 1996; 8: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The removal of DAG is largely operated by specific enzymes of the diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) family. DGK phosphorylates DAG to produce phosphatidic acid (PA) and plays an important role in signal transduction by modulating the balance between these two lipids (17Hou W. Kim Y. Morisset J. Cell.. Signal. 1996; 8: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). By controlling the cellular levels of DAG, DGK can serve as a negative regulator of PKC (16Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1984; 308: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (5760) Google Scholar). To date, ten DGK isozymes have been identified in mammals and divided into five classes based on their primary structure (19Kanoh H. Kim K. Sakane F. J. Biochem. 2002; 131: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 20Imai S. Kim M. Yasuda S. Kanoh H. Sakane F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39870-39881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). DGKs feature a conserved catalytic domain at the C terminus and, within the regulatory domain at the N terminus, possess two or three cysteine-rich regions homologous to the C1A and C1B motifs of PKC (21Van Blitterswijk W.J. Kim B. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Moreover, these enzymes share other conserved motifs that are likely to play a role in lipid-protein and protein-protein interactions in various signaling pathways dependent on DAG and/or PA production (22Topham M.K. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 97: 474-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The differences in the regulatory domains of the various sub-types, together with the differential tissue expression pattern of the different isoforms suggest that the regulation of DGKs varies among cell types and/or in response to different stimuli and that the DGK isoforms serve distinct although related functions (23Kai M. Kim F. Imai S. Wada I. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18492-18498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Ding L. Kim M. Topham M.K. McIntyre Zimmerman T.M. Prescott S.M. G.A. Proc. Natl.

DGK may serve as an off switch controlling PKC activation, thereby mediating the acute glucose regulation of its own metabolism. In the present work we have investigated the mechanism involved in acute regulation of PKCα activity by glucose. We have found that the acute exposure to high glucose concentration leads to a decrease in DAG levels and concomitantly impairs the enzymatic activity and translocation of PKCα. This effect is mediated by glucose action on DGK activity and subcellular localization.

Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 20 min, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred into 0.45-μm Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA).

The membrane pellet was solubilized in Buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100 by bath sonication and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used as the membrane fraction. Cytosolic and membrane fractions were then analyzed by Western blot. Purity (>90%) of the subcellular fractions was assessed by immunoblot with antibody against the β-subunit of the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (as control of membrane fraction) and against β-actin (as control of cytosolic fraction). Determinations of 2-Deoxy-d-glucose Uptake—For 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake studies, cells were rinsed and incubated in glucose-free buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgSO4, 10 mm NaHCO3, 1,3 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 0.25% bovine serum albumin) for 3 h.

The samples were incubated for 20 min at room temperature and rapidly cooled on ice, and 20-μl aliquots were spotted on phosphocellulose disc papers (Invitrogen). Discs were washed twice with 1% H3PO4, followed by two additional washes in water, and the disc-bound radioactivity was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. DGK Antisense silencing—For antisense studies, a phosphorothioate DGKα oligodeoxynucleotide was generated with the following sequence, 5′-TACCGGTTTCTGTTTTCACA-3′ and a phosphorothioate DGKδ oligodeoxynucleotide was generated with the following sequence, 5′-TACCTGGTAAAGAGTCCCTG-3′. For control, scrambled oligodeoxynucleotides (POs) with the sequences 5′-CTTGATATTCCCGTCGGACC-3′ and 5′-GGTCCACGTGCCACTTGGAC-3′ were also obtained. L6hIR cells were grown in 6-well plates. The cells were then rinsed with 3 ml of serum-free Dulbecco’s modified minimum essential medium and 3 ml of medium containing 2 μg/ml N-[1-(2,3-diomeoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride/dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine transfection reagent, and 4 μg/ml antisense were added for 16 h. The cells were washed with serum-free Dulbecco’s modified minimum essential medium and incubated for 18 h in the same medium supplemented with 0.25% bovine serum albumin. Transfected cells were exposed to 25 mm glucose as indicated and assayed for DAG levels and PKCα activation as described above. DGK Enzymatic Assays—DGK activity was assayed in vitro as previously described (31Bregoli L. Kim J.J. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23288-23295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, octylglucoside/DAG-mixed micelles were prepared as follows: a mixture of 0.25 mm DAG, 55 mm octylglucoside, and phosphatidylserine (either 1 mm, resulting in 1.8 mol% in micelles, or 5 mm, resulting in 8.3 mol% in micelles) was resuspended in 1 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, pH 7.4, by vortex-mixing and sonication until the suspension appeared clear. 20 μl of mixed micelles was added to 70 μl of reaction mix (final concentration: 100 μm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, pH 7.4, 50 mm imidazole-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP). 10 μl of total homogenate was added to 90 μl of mixed-micelles reaction mix solution. The reaction was started by vortex-mixing for 3 s and sonication for 5 s. After 30-min incubation at 25 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of chloroform/methanol/1% perchloric acid (1:2:0.75, v/v), then vortex-mixed. 1% perchloric acid and chloroform (1:1, v/v) were added, and the mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at 2,000 rpm in a tabletop Sorval centrifuge at 25 °C. The organic phase was washed twice in 1% perchloric acid, and an aliquot was dried under a stream of nitrogen and spotted onto a silica gel 60 TLC plate. PA was separated by chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (10:4:3:2:1, v/v). The amount of [γ-32P]PA was measured by using a liquid scintillation spectrophotometer. Glucose Effect on DAG Levels in L6 Skeletal Muscle Cells—We investigated whether the intracellular levels of DAG were changed by exposure of L6hIR myotubes to high glucose concentrations. The L6hIR (L6 Cl Wt1 and Wt2) are clones of L6 cells overexpressing human insulin receptors and have been previously generated and characterized (13Caruso M. Kim C. Oriente F. Maitan M.A. Bifulco G. Andreozzi F. Condorelli G. Formisano P. Beguinot F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28637-28644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In both clones of L6hIR myotubes, incubation with 25 mm glucose for 5 min induced a decrease in DAG levels of ∼2-fold as compared with untreated cells (p < 0.001). Prolonging glucose exposure at 30 and 60 min, DAG levels were increased by 1.4- and 1.6-fold over basal levels, respectively (Fig. 1). To evaluate the specificity of glucose effect, DAG levels were measured in the same cells treated with 25 mm xylose. No variation occurred in DAG levels after xylose treatment (Fig. 1). In addition, acute glucose exposure of the cells following preincubation with 25 mm pyruvate in the glucose-free medium elicited similar effects (Fig. 1), indicating that glucose effect was not due to changes in osmolarity or to energy depletion. Glucose Effect on DGK Activity in L6 Myotubes—To investigate the mechanism by which glucose regulates DAG levels, we measured cellular DGK activity in L6hIR (L6 Cl Wt1 and Wt2) myotubes after exposure to 25 mm glucose for 5 and 30 min. After 5 min of glucose stimulation, the levels of PA were increased by 12-fold (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2A). However, PA levels returned close to basal levels by prolonging the incubation with high glucose concentrations for up to 30 min. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of DGK with a well characterized non-isoform specific inhibitor, R59949 (1 mm), prevented the acute glucose-dependent increase in PA levels, suggesting that this increase was due to DGK activation. We next analyzed the effect of R59949 on the glucose-induced decrease in DAG levels (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, in the presence of the DGK inhibitor, DAG levels were slightly increased by glucose stimulation for 5 min, compared with basal levels. Thus, glucose-induced reciprocal changes of PA and DAG were largely prevented by DGK inhibition. Effect of DGK Inhibition on Glucose-induced PKCα Activity and Translocation—To investigate the role of DGK in glucose regulation of the DAG/PKC pathway, we evaluated the effect of DGK inhibition on PKCα activity and translocation to the plasma membrane after exposure to 25 mm glucose. As previously shown (13Caruso M. Kim C. Oriente F. Maitan M.A. Bifulco G. Andreozzi F. Condorelli G. Formisano P. Beguinot F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28637-28644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), incubation of L6hIR myotubes with 25 mm glucose for 5 min induced a 2-fold decrease in PKCα activity (Fig. 3A). Inhibition of DGK activity with R59949 prevented the negative effect of glucose on PKCα activity, which, instead, was increased by 1.5-fold over basal levels after 5 min of high glucose stimulation. Incubation with PA did not affect PKCα activity in in vitro assays, suggesting that its accumulation was not responsible for PKC inhibition (data not shown). Treatment with R59949 also prevented glucose-induced cytosolic retrotranslocation of PKCα (Fig. 3B), indicating that DGK is involved in acute glucose regulation of PKCα activity and translocation. PKC may directly regulate DGK activity and modify intracellular DAG concentration (29Yasuda I. Kim A. Tanaka S. Tominaga M. Sakurai A. Nishizuka Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 166: 1220-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). We therefore measur"

In order to control appropriate gene expression through phosphorylation of transcription factors, the activity of MAPKs must be tightly regulated by the actions coordinated between protein kinases and phosphatases. In this study, we explore the underlying mechanism through which the oxidative stress-activated c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), members of MAPKs, are regulated by dual specificity phosphatases (DUSPs). DUSPs are a group of enzymes that belong to the superfamily of protein-tyrosine phosphatases. They are able to recognize phospho-Ser/Thr and phospho-Tyr residues in substrates. Using quantitative real time PCR, we found that stimulation of human embryonic kidney 293T cells with H2O2 or xanthine/xanthine oxidase led to inducible expression of multiple DUSPs. We used RNA interference to characterize the functional role of these DUSPs and found rapid and transient induction of DUSP1 and DUSP10 to be essential for determining the appropriate magnitude of JNK activation in response to oxidative stress. The transcription factor ATF2, which is phosphorylated and activated by JNK, is a critical mediator for inducible expression of DUSP1 and DUSP10 in this signaling pathway. We further demonstrated that DUSP4 and DUSP16, both showing significant late phase induction, dephosphorylate JNK effectively, causing the down-regulation of the signaling cascade. Thus, this study provides new insights into the role of several DUSPs that coordinate with each other to control the magnitude and duration of JNK activity in response to oxidative stress.

Certain signaling events are necessary for cells to respond appropriately to environmental cues like physiological stimuli and stresses. In doing so, cells employ signaling modules that integrate input from upstream stimuli used to control appropriate cell functions, including proliferation, differentiation, migration, and death. One of the most important signaling modules is composed of a highly conserved cascade of three kinases, in which mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) 3The abbreviations used are: MAPKmitogen-activatedMEKmitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinaseERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseJNKc-Jun N-terminal kinasePTPprotein-tyrosine phosphataseDUSPdual specificity phosphataseMKPMAPK phosphataseROSreactive oxygen speciesXhypoxanthineXOxanthine oxidasesiRNAsmall interfering RNAHMBShydroxymethylbilane synthaseRNAiRNA interference. are the primary component (1Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4420) Google Scholar). The activation of MAPKs requires phosphorylation of both the Thr and Tyr residues located within the TXY signature motif by dual specificity MAPK kinases (MEKs or MKKs) (2Davis R.J.

To date, ∼20 mammalian MAPKs have been identified and characterized (4Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B.E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3564) Google Scholar). These enzymes are classified into two major categories based on their activation in response to different external stimuli. The extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), which are characterized by the TEY consensus sequence in the activation loop (4Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B.E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3564) Google Scholar), are activated by a variety of physiological agonists that trigger cell proliferation and differentiation (4Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B.E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3564) Google Scholar, 5Murphy L.O. Blenis J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 268-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). The second category of MAPKs, namely stress-activated protein kinases, includes the c-Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNKs, with the TPY consensus sequence in the activation loop) and p38 MAPKs (p38s, with the TGY consensus sequence in the activation loop) (4Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B.E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3564) Google Scholar). The stress-activated protein kinases, and members of the JNK family in particular, are effectively activated in response to cellular stresses caused by proinflammatory cytokines, radiation, osmotic stress, and oxidative stress (6Shen H.M. Liu Z.G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; 40: 928-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Despite the heterogeneity of upstream signaling inputs that activate various types of ERKs and stress-activated protein kinases, enzymes in the MAPK family share some common features. These characteristics are critical for the integration of complex signaling pathways that yield appropriate cellular responses. For example, both ERKs and stress-activated protein kinases are translocated to the nucleus after MEK phosphorylation of the Thr and Tyr residues at the TXY motif (4Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B.E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3564) Google Scholar, 5Murphy L.O. Blenis J. Trends Biochem.

Once inside the nucleus, these activated MAPKs are capable of directly phosphorylating a number of transcription factors and cell cycle regulators (4Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B.E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3564) Google Scholar, 5Murphy L.O. Blenis J. Trends Biochem.

Regardless of the subfamilies in which individual enzymes are assigned, it is generally accepted that the key function of all forms of MAPKs is to precisely control the activity of transcription factors in order to regulate the expression of a large number of important genes (4Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B.E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3564) Google Scholar, 5Murphy L.O. Blenis J. Trends Biochem.

Therefore, the duration and magnitude of MAPK activity must be tightly regulated. Research thus far has demonstrated that the activation of MAPKs induced by various stimuli is normally transient (7Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 8Farooq A. Zhou M.M. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), suggesting a mechanism for down-regulation of their enzymatic activity in vivo. It is now clear that protein phosphatases participate in the control of MAPK-mediated signaling through dephosphorylation of upstream kinases or by direct targeting on MAPKs (7Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 8Farooq A. Zhou M.M. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 9Saxena M. Mustelin T. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Although the signaling cascades leading to the activation of MAPKs have been well defined, the underlying mechanism for down-regulation of MAPKs is not. Previous studies have demonstrated that the dephosphorylation of either phosphoamino acid residue at the conserved TXY motif results in the inactivation of MAPKs (7Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 8Farooq A. Zhou M.M. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 9Saxena M. Mustelin T. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been proposed that both Ser/Thr-specific phosphatases, as well as protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), can potentially dephosphorylate MAPKs. Indeed, it has been reported that some Ser/Thr phosphatases, such as PP2A (10Alessi D.R. Gomez N. Moorhead G. Lewis T. Keyse S.M. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 283-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) and PP2Cα (11Hanada M. Kobayashi T. Ohnishi M. Ikeda S. Wang H. Katsura K. Yanagawa Y. Hiraga A. Kanamaru R. Tamura S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 172-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), can inactivate MAPKs through dephosphorylation of the Thr residue. Similarly, tyrosine-specific phosphatases, such as HePTP (12Saxena M. Williams S. Brockdorff J. Gilman J. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11693-11700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) or PTP-SL (13Pulido R. Zuniga A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7337-7350Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), can target MAPKs on the phospho-Tyr residue. Moreover, the recent identification of a subgroup of enzymes within the PTP superfamily termed dual specificity phosphatases (DUSPs; ∼60 genes in the human genome (14Alonso A. Sasin J. Bottini N. Friedberg I. Friedberg I. Osterman A. Godzik A. Hunter T. Dixon J. Mustelin T. Cell. 2004; 117: 699-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1536) Google Scholar, 15Tonks N.K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 833-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar)) has led to significant advancement in our understanding of the regulation of MAPKs. DUSPs, characterized by the presence of a PTP signature motif, HCXXGXXR(S/T), display limited sequence homology to the classical, tyrosine-specific PTPs. Initial studies showed that DUSP1, a prototypical MAPK phosphatase (MKP), is capable of dephosphorylating both the Thr and Tyr residues on the TEY motif in ERKs (16Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F.

Since then, several studies have documented a number of DUSPs that recognize various forms of MAPKs as substrates. To date, 10 typical MKPs (DUSP1/MKP-1/CL100, DUSP2/PAC-1, DUSP4/MKP-2, DUSP5/hVH3, DUSP6/MKP-3/PYST1, DUSP7/MKP-X/PYST2, DUSP8/hVH5, DUSP9/MKP-4/PYST3, DUSP10/MKP-5, and DUSP16/MKP-7) are characterized by the presence of a Cdc25 homology region 2 domain within the N-terminal region and a catalytic domain within the C-terminal region. Two additional DUSPs (DUSP3/VHR and DUSP14/MKP-6) contain only a catalytic domain. These 12 MKPs regulate the activity of MAPKs through the dephosphorylation of Thr and Tyr residues (8Farooq A. Zhou M.M. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Although biochemical data have revealed the distinct substrate specificities of DUSPs toward various types of MAPKs, the exact function of these enzymes in the regulation of signal transduction in vivo needs elucidation. Human DUSP1 has been identified as an immediate early gene whose expression is rapidly induced by oxidative stress, heat shock, and growth factors (17Charles C.H. Sun H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Proc.

More recent research has demonstrated that this characteristic is also shared by other DUSPs, in particular those enzymes functioning as MKPs (19Brondello J.M. Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. McKenzie F.R.

Based on such observations, it has been proposed that these inducibly expressed DUSPs might be key players in the feedback loop mechanism, since they may terminate the signal transduction mediated by MAPKs. In the current study, we examined the signaling pathways activated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). We present evidence that the treatment of human embryonic kidney 293T cells with H2O2 can result in the transient activation of type 1 and type 2 JNKs, concomitant with the inducible expression of DUSPs. Our study demonstrates that several DUSPs play distinct roles in orchestrating a regulatory network that controls the precise magnitude and duration of JNK activation in response to oxidative stress. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection with Small Interfering RNA—Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% glutamine. For direct exposure to H2O2 or stimulation with ROS generated by a mixture of hypoxanthine and xanthine oxidase (X/XO; both from Sigma), cells were plated in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 24 h and then serum-starved for 16 h before treatment. For transient transfection with small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides, cells were plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for 16 h. The siRNA duplexes of DUSPs or the transcription factors p53, c-Jun, and ATF2 (SMARTpool siRNA oligonucleotides; Dharmacon) were introduced using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were continuously incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for 8 h, followed by serum deprivation for an additional 16 h prior to stimulation with H2O2 or X/XO. Immunoblotting—Antibodies used for immunoblotting were purchased from Cell Signaling: anti-phospho-JNK (Thr(P)183/Tyr(P)185), anti-JNK, anti-phospho-p38 (Thr(P)180/Tyr(P)182), anti-p38, anti-phospho-ERK (Thr(P)202/Tyr(P)204), anti-ERK, anti-phospho-p53 (Ser20), anti-p53, anti-phospho-c-Jun (Ser63), anti-c-Jun, anti-phospho-ATF2 (Thr(P)69), and anti-ATF2. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 200 μm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Aliquots of total lysates (20–30 μg of protein/sample, as indicated in the figures) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were then incubated with appropriate primary and secondary antibodies. The specific signals were visualized by an ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Extraction of RNA and cDNA Synthesis—Total RNA was isolated from 293T cells using a Trizol reagent kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA was synthesized from total RNA with Transcriptor reverse transcriptase (Roche Applied Science) using oligo(dT) primers according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative Real Time PCR—The mRNA expression levels were quantified by real time PCR using a LightCycler instrument (Roche Applied Science) with the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Qiagen) in a one-step reaction according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers were designed using the LightCycler Probe Design software 1.0 (Idaho Technology). The sequences for 12 DUSP forward and reverse primers are shown in Table 1. The primer sequences for the transcription factors p53, c-Jun, and ATF2 as well as a housekeeping gene, hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS), were as follows: p53 forward, 5′-ATGTGTAACAGTTCCTGC-3′; p53 reverse, 5′-GCTCGCTTAGTGCTCC-3′; c-Jun forward, 5′-CGACCTTCTATGACGATGC-3′; c-Jun reverse, 5′-GTGGTGGTGATGTGCC-3′; ATF2 forward, 5′-TACAAGTGGTCGTCGG-3′; ATF2 reverse, 5′-CGGTTACAGGGCAATC-3′; HMBS forward, 5′-AGTATTCGGGGAAACCT-3′; HMBS reverse, 5′-AAGCAGAGTCTCGGGA-3′. The melting curves and gel electrophoresis of the end products were obtained to confirm the PCR specificity and the correct size of the PCR band. The mRNA levels of target genes were normalized to the relative amounts of the housekeeping gene HMBS.TABLE 1DUSPs analyzed in this studyNameSynonymsAccession numberSubstrate specificity (Ref. 8Farooq A.

To induce such a response, human embryonic kidney 293T cells were exposed to 200 μm H2O2. This concentration of H2O2 was selected, because physiological stimuli, such as platelet-derived growth factor, can induce a transient increase in the intracellular level of H2O2 that is equivalent to that achieved by stimulating cells with H2O2 at an extracellular concentration ranging between 0.1 and 1.0 mm (25Sundaresan M. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2322) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested at various time points, and the phosphorylation status of MAPKs was analyzed by immunostaining using specific antibodies that recognize the bisphosphorylated forms of JNK, p38, and ERK. As shown in Fig. 1A, the phosphorylation level of type 1 and type 2 JNKs was significantly increased within 60 min after H2O2 treatment, peaking (∼5.5-fold, compared with the no treatment sample) at 2 h. Interestingly, the activated form of JNK was rapidly dephosphorylated, as demonstrated by the fact that phosphorylation of JNK had already returned to the basal level at 6 h after stimulation (Fig. 1A). The p38 and ERK proteins were also phosphorylated and activated in response to oxidative stress but to a substantially lesser than was JNK (Fig. 1B). Immunoblotting analysis further indicated that the protein expression levels for these three MAPKs remained constant after oxidative treatment (Fig. 1, A and B), suggesting that potentially post-translational modifications for the regulation of activation and inactivation of MAPKs may be involved in this signaling pathway. Based on these observations, we focused on the underlying mechanism responsible for the rapid dephosphorylation of JNK in response to H2O2 stimulation. We hypothesized that JNK dephosphorylation might be mediated by the function of DUSPs. Published findings have suggested that DUSPs may be inductively expressed through transcriptional and translational processes in response to oxidative stress (19Brondello J.M. Brunet A. Pouyssegur J.

Thus, we examined JNK dephosphorylation after suppression of de novo mRNA synthesis by actinomycin D or after suppression of protein synthesis by cycloheximide. As previously shown, JNK was rapidly phosphorylated and then completely dephosphorylated following treatment of cells with 200 μm H2O2 (Fig. 1, C and D). However, pretreatment of cells with either actinomycin D or cycloheximide prior to H2O2 stimulation led to considerably sustained levels of JNK phosphorylation at 6 h post-treatment (Fig. 1, C and D). These results suggest that synthesis of de novo mRNA and protein (more specifically, DUSP-inducible expression) may be involved in the negative regulation of JNK activation in response to oxidative stress. mRNA Levels of DUSPs Are Rapidly Increased following H2O2 Stimulation—We tested the hypothesis that the effective dephosphorylation of JNK was due to the rapid expression of DUSPs in response to H2O2 stimulation. To do this, we selected 12 DUSP genes for detailed examination (listed in Table 1). They were the well characterized MKPs 1–7 and five other DUSPs that have been proposed to regulate the activity of MAPKs (8Farooq A. Zhou M.M. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). We used quantitative real time PCR and the SYBR Green I labeling method to compare the levels of mRNA for these 12 DUSPs at various time points following H2O2 treatment. The specific DUSP primers used for real time PCR analysis are shown in Table 1. These 12 DUSPs were assigned to three categories based upon the magnitude and pattern of inducible mRNA expression. Group I phosphatases, including DUSP1, DUSP8, and DUSP10, were rapidly induced in a transient manner once the cells were treated with H2O2 (Fig. 2A). The expression levels for DUSPs in this group peaked at 2–3 h and then rapidly decreased between 4 and 8 h (Fig. 2A). Group II phosphatases were those whose mRNA levels gradually accumulated and remained at high levels for 8 h post-treatment, DUSP4 and DUSP16 (Fig. 2B). The aforementioned DUSPs in Groups I and II showed at least a 3.5-fold induction after treatment and were therefore classified as genes that were significantly up-regulated in response to oxidative stress. In contrast, the mRNA levels for the seven remaining DUSPs, including DUSP2, DUSP3, DUSP5, DUSP6, DUSP7, DUSP9, and DUSP14, did not change or were only marginally increased (≤2.5-fold) after oxidative treatment. These DUSPs were assigned to Group III, phosphatases without significant induction (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, the rapid expression of DUSPs from Groups I and II occurred over the same time period that JNK was inactivated in Group III (Fig. 1A). Thus, our results suggest that five DUSPs, namely DUSP1, DUSP4, DUSP8, DUSP10, and DUSP16, are potential negative regulators of JNK in the oxidative stress-activated signaling pathways. Several DUSPs Participate in Regulating JNK Response to H2O2 Stimulation—In the next phase of the study, we investigated whether DUSPs, which have undergone a significant increase in mRNA expression following oxidative stress, participate in the regulation of JNK phosphorylation. To do this, we used the RNAi technique to suppress the inducible expression of individual DUSPs. siRNA transfectants were exposed to H2O2, and the levels of JNK phosphorylation were monitored over time (Fig. 3). Compared with the control cells transfected with scrambled siRNA, the mRNA levels of DUSPs in cells transfected with phosphatase-specific siRNA were substantially decreased (Fig. 3, A–E, left). The suppression by RNAi of either DUSP1 or DUSP10 led to enhanced phosphorylation of JNK at 2 h after H2O2 stimulation, followed by rapid dephosphorylation of JNK at 4–6 h (Fig. 3, A and C, right). These results suggest that the inducible expression of either DUSP1 or DUSP10 is more important to controlling the appropriate level of JNK phosphorylation at an initial stage than it is for terminating JNK signaling. We also observed that the RNAi-mediated ablation of DUSP8, the other transiently expressed DUSP, did not affect the extent and duration of JNK activation (Fig. 3B, right). To explore the effects of additional phosphatases that may recognize and dephosphorylate JNK at a later stage after H2O2 stimulation, we examined the potential function of DUSP4 and DUSP16, since both had been observed to have sustained expression of oxidative stress-inducible mRNA (Fig. 2). We found that although the level of JNK phosphorylation in siRNA transfectants was not enhanced at 2 h, it was significantly prolonged when the expression of endogenous DUSP4 (Fig. 3D) or DUSP16 (Fig. 3E) was ablated. The regulatory role for DUSPs involved in JNK dephosphorylation was further tested using RNAi. In that experiment, the expressions of the two DUSPs were simultaneously ablated. As shown in Fig. 4A, transfection with a mixture of siRNA oligonucleotides, which caused knockdown of the expression of both DUSP1 and DUSP10, led to a robust activation of JNK at 1–2 h following H2O2 stimulation. This finding suggests that the inducible expression of functional DUSP1 and DUSP10 needed to down-regulate JNK may not take place immediately after ROS stimulation. A short exposure of H2O2 (30 min) in siRNA transfectants, in which both phosphatases were ablated, resulted in a similar degree of JNK phosphorylation compared with the control cells (Fig. S"
https://openalex.org/W2091174168,"We studied whether the acute-phase protein alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) induces rises in [Ca2+]i in neutrophils and sought to identify the corresponding AGP receptor (or receptors). We found that AGP elicited a minimal rise in [Ca2+]i in Fura-2-loaded neutrophils, and this response was markedly enhanced by pretreatment with anti-L-selectin antibodies. (The EC50 value of the AGP-induced Ca2+ response was 9 microg/ml.) Activation of phospholipase-C, Src tyrosine kinases, and PI3 kinases proved to be essential for the AGP-mediated increase in [Ca2+]i, whereas the p38 MAPK and SYK signaling pathways were not involved. Furthermore, antibodies against sialic acid binding, immunoglobulin-like lectin 5 (Siglec-5) and oligosaccharide 3'-sialyl-lactose both antagonized the AGP-induced response and caused an immediate increase in [Ca2+]i in anti-L-selectin-treated neutrophils, which indicates a signaling capacity of Siglec-5. We used modified forms of AGP (treated with mild periodate or neuraminidase) to establish the importance of sialic acid residues. The modified forms of AGP caused a much smaller rise in [Ca2+]i than did unaltered AGP. Affinity chromatography confirmed that unchanged AGP, but not neuraminidase-treated AGP, bound to Siglec-5. Our report provides the first evidence for a signaling capacity by AGP through a defined receptor. Pre-engagement of L-selectin significantly enhanced this signaling capacity."
https://openalex.org/W1969172880,"The availability of inhibitors of cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE 5), such as sildenafil, has revolutionized the treatment of pulmonary hypertension (PH). Sildenafil may exert its protective effects in a mechanism-based fashion by targeting a pathophysiologically attenuated NO-cGMP signaling pathway. To elucidate this, we analyzed changes in the pulmonary expression and activity of key enzymes of NO-cGMP signaling as well as the functional pulmonary responses to sildenafil in the 5 or 21 day hypoxia mouse model of PH. Surprisingly, we found doubled NO synthase (NOS) II and III levels, no evidence for attenuated NO bioavailability as evidenced by the nitrosative/oxidative stress marker protein nitro tyrosine, and no changes in the expression and activity of the NO receptor, soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC). PDE 5 was either unchanged at day 5 or, after 21 days of hypoxia, even significantly decreased along with unchanged activity. Biochemically, these changes were mirrored by increased cGMP spillover into the lung perfusate and cGMP-dependent phosphorylation of the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein, VASP. Sildenafil further augmented cGMP and phospho-VASP levels in lungs of mice exposed for 5 or 21 days and decreased pulmonary arterial pressure in mice after 5 days but not 21 days of hypoxia. In conclusion, NO-cGMP signaling is compensatorily up-regulated in the hypoxic mouse model of PH, and sildenafil further augments this pathway to functionally alleviate pulmonary vasoconstriction."
https://openalex.org/W2072219110,"Pore-forming proteins (PFPs) are water-soluble proteins able to integrate into target membranes to form transmembrane pores. They are common determinants of bacterial pathogenicity and are often found in animal venoms. We recently isolated and characterized Hydralysins (Hlns), paralytic PFPs from the venomous green hydra Chlorohydra viridissima that are not found within the nematocytes, suggesting they are not involved in prey capture. The present study aimed to decipher the biological role of Hlns. Using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, we show that Hlns are expressed by digestive cells surrounding the gastrovascular cavity (GVC) of Chlorohydra and secreted onto the prey during feeding. At biologically relevant concentrations, Hlns bind prey membranes and form pores, lysing the cells and disintegrating the prey tissue. Hlns are unable to bind Chlorohydra membranes, thus protecting the producing animal from the destructive effect of its own cytolytic protein. We suggest that osmotic disintegration of the prey within the GVC by Hlns, followed by phagocytosis and intracellular digestion, allows the soft-bodied green hydra to feed on hard, cuticle-covered prey while lacking the physical means to mechanically disintegrate it. Our results extend the biological significance of PFPs beyond the commonly expected offensive or defensive roles."

In low glucose medium without insulin, amounts of both FVII mRNA and secreted FVII protein were coordinately increased; in the presence of glucose with insulin, both were decreased. Analysis of the FVII promoter showed that these effects could be reproduced in a reporter-gene system, and a small promoter element immediately upstream of the translation start site of the gene, which mediated these effects, was identified. Mutation of this element largely abrogated the glucose/insulin-responsive change in expression of the reporter gene.

Numerous adaptive changes in hepatic gene expression occur in response to fluctuations in the availability of nutrients such as glucose. When glucose is abundant, it is taken up by hepatocytes and metabolized, initially to replenish glycogen stores and subsequently for synthesis of fatty acids, which are primarily converted to triglycerides for transport to and storage in adipose tissue (1Miller G.J. Kim J.K. Ellis L.J. Thompson R.L. Wilkes H.C. Stirling Y. Mitropoulos K.A. Allison J.V. Fox T.E. Walker A.O. Atherosclerosis. 1989; 78: 19-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). When glucose is in short supply, the pattern is reversed; biosynthetic pathways requiring glucose are inhibited, and those producing glucose from glycogen and by de novo synthesis are activated (2Foufelle F. Kim P. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 377-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The expression of many hepatic genes, particularly those encoding glucose transport proteins and enzymes that catalyze the various metabolic reactions, are induced or suppressed in concert with changes in glucose status. Because fluctuations in glucose levels are accompanied by hormonal changes, primarily reciprocal induction and suppression of pancreatic insulin and glucagon, it may be difficult to discern whether a given response is due solely to glucose metabolism, to the hormonal changes, or to a combination of both processes. Most responsive hepatic genes are up-regulated in the presence of elevated glucose and/or insulin and down-regulated in their absence. However, a subset of responsive genes behaves in the converse manner and are down-regulated in the presence of glucose and/or insulin and up-regulated in their absence. The former group is large and includes the genes for proteins involved in glucose uptake and enzymes required for glucose metabolism and for conversion to glycogen and triglycerides, whereas the latter group is small and appears to be primarily composed of genes encoding enzymes involved in hepatic glucose synthesis and in the endoplasmic-reticulum stress response, which is triggered by glucose deprivation (reviewed in Ref. 3O'Brien R.M.

FVII is a vitamin K-dependent hepatic glycoprotease present in the circulation primarily as an inactive zymogen at very low concentration. Nearly all plasma FVII is in zymogen form, but ∼1% has been proteolytically cleaved to the activated form, FVIIa (reviewed in Ref. 4Monroe D.M. Kim N.S. J. Thromb.

Kim N.S. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2007; 5: 1097-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, most cell surface tissue factor is itself in an inactive, or encrypted, form (reviewed in Ref. 10Bach R.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2006; 26: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Encrypted tissue factor binds FVII/FVIIa but does not support its catalytic activity (11Wolberg A.S. Kim D.M. Roberts H.R. Hoffman M.R. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1999; 10: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Decryption of tissue factor is associated with influx of calcium ions (12Bach R. Kim D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6995-6999Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), local loss of membrane asymmetry (13Dietzen D.J. Kim K.L. Tetzloff T.A. Blood. 2004; 103: 3038-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), dissociation of tissue factor dimers (10Bach R.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2006; 26: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), and disulfide exchange at the external Cys186–Cys209 bond of tissue factor (14Chen V.M. Kim J. Versteeg H.H. Berndt M.C. Ruf W.

Interaction of FVIIa with decrypted tissue factor permits activation of the coagulation cascade, leading to the localized generation of thrombin at an injury site (5Osterud B. Kim S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5260-5264Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Tissue factor expression is also inducible, and tissue factor has been found within the circulation, in association with membranes of activated cells or microparticles derived from them (16Broze Jr., G.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1982; 70: 526-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 17Berckmans R.J. Kim R. Boing A.N. Romijn F.P. Hack C.E. Sturk A. Thromb.

Med. 2003; 9: 458-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that this “blood-borne” tissue factor participates in thrombus enlargement and perhaps in triggering of thrombosis under pathological conditions (19Giesen P.L. Kim U. Bohrmann B. Kling D. Roque M. Fallon J.T. Badimon J.J. Himber J. Riederer M.A. Nemerson Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2311-2315Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar, 20Aras O.

Med. 2004; 10: 1155-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). FVIIa activity is essential for coagulation by the extrinsic pathway, (22Fair D.S. Kim E.F. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1983; 101: 372-384PubMed Google Scholar), which is involved in both hemostasis and thrombosis. Elevated plasma FVII levels are associated with polymorphisms in the promoter of the gene (23vant Hooft F.M. Kim A. Tornvall P. Iliadou A. Ehrenborg E. Eriksson P. Hamsten A. Blood. 1999; 93: 3432-3441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas decreased levels are associated with distinct polymorphisms in the promoter, the structural gene, or both (24Green F. Kim C. Wilkes H. Temple A. Meade T. Humphries S. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 11: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 25Hunault M. Kim A.A. Lopaciuk S. Carew J.A. Bauer K.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2825-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Whether carriage of polymorphisms influences the risk of thrombosis is presently unclear, since some studies report increased risk of myocardial infarction (26Meade T.W. Kim S. Brozovic M.

Plasma FVII levels may also be elevated in diabetes, a disease characterized by disordered glucose metabolism and increased risk of thrombotic complications (36Carr M.E. J. Diabetes Complications. 2001; 15: 44-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The mechanism through which FVII levels are modulated in diabetes is not understood. We therefore investigated whether transcription of the FVII gene was influenced by glucose and insulin. The data presented herein indicate that deprivation of glucose and insulin, over a physiologically relevant concentration range, significantly increased expression of both FVII mRNA and FVII protein secreted by HepG2 cells, a human hepatoma cell line. The induction of FVII triggered by withdrawal of glucose and insulin could be prevented, and expression of FVII could be suppressed below basal levels, by reintroduction of insulin to deficient culture medium. These results were recapitulated using a reporter gene system, suggesting that transcriptional effects were involved. A functional region of the FVII minimal promoter capable of interaction with C/EBP isoforms was identified and found to participate in mediating the changes in reporter gene expression attributable to fluctuations in glucose and insulin levels. DNA Isolation, PCR, and Reporter Plasmids—Genomic DNA was purified from leukocytes of healthy donors by standard methods (37Kunkel L.M. Kim K.D. Boyer S.H. Borgaonkar D.S. Wachtel S.S. Miller O.J. Breg W.R. Jones Jr., H.W. Rary J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 1245-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar) under a study protocol approved by the Human Studies Committee of the Brockton-West Roxbury Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Segments of FVII 5′-flanking sequence (nucleotides –1012, –723, –257, and –108 to +1, with nucleotide +1 designated the first base of the initial methionine codon of FVII structural gene) were amplified by PCR with TaqDNA polymerase in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences DNA Thermal Cycler (Norwalk, CT), using primers from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) and subcloned into the promoterless pOGH reporter plasmid containing the human growth hormone (hGH) structural gene (Nichols Diagnostics Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA). The plasmids are referred to as p-1012/1, p-723/1, p-257/1, and p-108/1. Additional reporter plasmids, extending from position –108 but terminating at position +134 relative to the translation initiation codon, within the first intron, and having either native sequence or sequence mutated at positions –6 to –2, identical to that of oligonucleotide TLSS-MT, described below, were also prepared by overlapping PCR methodology. These plasmids are referred to as p-108/134WT and p-108/134MT. All sequences were confirmed on a 373A DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) (38Sanger F. Kim S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52770) Google Scholar) and compared with published sequences. Preparation of FVII Minigenes—A segment of FVII promoter extending from position –728 to +1 was appended to a FVII cDNA segment extending from position +1 to +268 by overlapping PCR and spliced into plasmid pED-FVII using unique restriction enzyme sites present in the PCR primers and the vector to produce an expression vector with native FVII minigene, pED-FVII-MG. pED-FVII is a dicistronic mammalian expression vector carrying the dihydrofolate reductase gene as a selectable marker, in addition to 32 bp of FVII 5′-untranslated region, the complete FVII cDNA, and 1.2 kb of FVII 3′-untranslated region containing the native polyadenylation sites, under the direction of the SV40 promoter. The construction of pED-FVII has been described previously (39Hunault M. Kim A.A. Carew J.A. Peyvandi F. Bauer K.A. Blood. 1999; 93: 1237-1244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During generation of the pED-FVII-MG construct, the SV40 promoter sequence was removed and replaced with the FVII promoter segment, thus placing the FVII cDNA under the direction of a segment of its native promoter. The construct was sequenced to confirm segments obtained by PCR and restriction sites used for cloning. Cell Culture, Treatments, and Transfections—HepG2 cells (ATCC HB-8065) were cultured in minimal essential medium containing 5 mm glucose, supplemented with 10% certified fetal bovine serum containing 0.4 mIU/ml insulin, 4 mm/liter glutamine, 10 mm/liter pyruvate, 10 mm/liter HEPES buffer, pH 7.2, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. For glucose deprivation experiments, 2 × 106 cells were plated in standard medium and allowed to attain confluence. Following a 24-h preincubation in medium with 1% FBS, media were changed to glucose-free medium with 10% dialyzed serum and further supplemented with glucose and/or recombinant human insulin as indicated. Media and sera were obtained from Invitrogen, and recombinant human insulin was from Sigma. For transient transfection of HepG2 cells, 2 × 106 cells were plated per dish and transfected by either the calcium phosphate method or with Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) as noted in the legend to Fig. 3, with growth hormone reporter vector and pSV-β-galactosidase expression plasmid (Promega Corp.) as an internal control to monitor transfection efficiency. Media were applied to transfected cells at the end of the transfection period and maintained for 48 h. At harvest, media and lysates were assayed for hGH (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Webster, TX) and β-galactosidase (Promega). hGH values were corrected for transfection efficiency, and then reporter expression was normalized and averaged, and the S.D. values were calculated. Statistical significance of differences in expression between groups was assessed by the Student's t test. CHO-DUKX-B11 cells (a gift of Dr. B. Furie, Boston, MA), deficient in dihydrofolate reductase, were used for transfection with pED-FVII-MG-WT and pED-FVII. Cells were cultured in α-modified essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mm/liter glutamine, 10 mm/liter pyruvate, 10 mm/liter HEPES buffer, pH 7.2, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 μg/ml adenosine, 10 μg/ml deoxyadenosine, and 10 μg/ml thymidine, at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Transient transfections of 1 × 106 cells with 2 μg of pED-FVII (or pED-FVII-MG) and 0.5 μg of pRSV-βgal were performed as described (39Hunault M. Kim A.A. Carew J.A. Peyvandi F. Bauer K.A. Blood. 1999; 93: 1237-1244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for 16 h using Lipofectamine reagent, with or without co-transfection of expression vectors for C/EBPβ isoforms liver-activating protein (LAP) or liver-inhibiting protein (LIP), both kindly provided by Dr. M. Kilberg (Gainesville, FL). 48 h post-transfection, culture media and cells were harvested for assay of secreted FVII and β-galactosidase, respectively. Preparation of Nuclear or Whole Cell Extracts—HepG2 nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Schreiber (40Schreiber E. Kim W. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1989; 15: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts from male rat liver were obtained from Geneka Corp. (Montreal, Canada). HepG2 cells were transfected with 10 μg of expression plasmids for the rat liver-activating protein (pLAP) or liver-inhibiting protein (pLIP), isoforms of C/EBPβ, and whole cell extracts were prepared 48 h later (41Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kim E. Evagelopoulou C. Zeng S. Cladaras C. Ladias J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 539-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations of extracts were determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). FVII Antigen (FVII:Ag) Assay—FVII:Ag secreted by HepG2 cells under standard and experimental culture conditions or by CHO cells after transfection with pED-FVII-MG-WT was measured by commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of the conditioned media (American Bioproducts, Parsippany, NJ). Serum-containing medium not conditioned by cells gave responses in this assay nearly indistinguishable from diluent buffer alone, which were ∼30-fold lower than those obtained for conditioned media under the standard conditions (not shown). Real Time Reverse Transcriptase PCR—The RNeasy miniprep protocol (Qiagen Inc., Germantown, MD) was used to prepare total RNA from HepG2 cells grown under standard or various experimental growth conditions. 20 ng of total RNA was used for FVII mRNA determination and (as an internal control) for 18 S ribosomal RNA determination in multiple replicates as noted. The values were compared with those obtained for parallel reactions run with total human liver mRNA (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) at concentrations between 0 and 100 ng, which were used to construct standard curves for each. No amplification controls, as well as no input RNA controls, were run with each assay. The PCR primers and fluorescent probe for FVII were as follows: forward primer, 5′-GACCAGTGTGCCTCAAGTCCAT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CCGTTCTCGTTCACACAGATCA-3′; probe, 5′-(6-carboxyfluorescein)-TCATCCTTGTGCGTCTCACAGTTCCGT(tetramethyl-6-carboxyrhodamine). The target region produced a PCR product of the expected size with total RNA template following reverse transcription; no product was obtained with genomic DNA template or in the absence of reverse transcriptase (not shown). Primers and probe for 18 S rRNA detection were from the TaqMan ribosomal RNA control kit. All reagents for real time reverse transcriptase PCR were obtained from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA), and reactions were run on an ABI-7700 detector under standard conditions (30-min reverse transcriptase reaction at 48 °C, 10 min at 95 °C, and 40 cycles of PCR with 15 s at 95 °C/1 min at 60 °C). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—Complementary oligonucleotides were annealed and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). FVII oligonucleotides (upper strand sequence) were as follows: native and mutated translation start site region, residues –20 to +14 or –20 to +25, 5′-AGCACTGCAGAGATTTCATCATGGTCTCCCAGGC-3′ (TLSS-WT1) and 5′-AGCACTGCAGAGATgagcgCATGGTCTCCCAGGC-3′ (TLSS-MT1) or 5′-AGCACTGCAGAGATTTCATCATGGTCTCCCAGGCCCTCAGGCTCC-3′ (TLSS-WT2) and 5′-AGCACTGCAGAGATgagcgCATGGTCTCCCAGGCCCTCAGGCTCC-3′ (TLSS-MT2). The mutated residues are shown in lowercase type. Incubations were done in 15 μl for 30 min at 4 °C, in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 30 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 12% glycerol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), with 3–5 μg of HepG2 nuclear extract or 4.4 μg of rat liver nuclear extract. Reactions were run on 5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels in 1× TBE (90 mm Tris base, 90 mm borate, 0.5 mm EDTA) buffer and autoradiographed. For competition assays, unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides were added to reaction mixtures with the radiolabeled probe. For supershift assays, polyclonal antibodies directed against C/EBP isoforms, which recognize both the homologous human and rodent proteins (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), were added to extracts during a 60-min preincubation at 4 °C prior to the addition of oligonucleotide probe. Effect of Glucose/Insulin on FVII Expression—Culture of human hepatoma (HepG2) cells for 24 h or longer in standard full growth medium produced a level of secreted FVII protein that was easily detectable by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The concentration of glucose in this medium at the onset of the collection period was 5 mm, and bovine insulin was contributed by the serum to a final concentration of ∼0.4 mIU/ml. HepG2 cells possess functional insulin receptors and in the presence of insulin will take up and catabolize glucose. When cells were maintained in glucose-free basal medium supplemented with dialyzed serum, the amount of FVII:Ag secreted by the cells over a 24-h time course was significantly increased. Supplementation of this glucose/insulin-deficient medium with 5 mm glucose and recombinant human insulin at 100 nm suppressed this effect (Fig. 1A). The incremental reduction in FVII:Ag level was similar at 1 and 5 mm and at 48 as well as 24 h, suggesting that the response is due to the presence or absence of insulin rather than of glucose (Fig. 1B). Measurement of FVII mRNA levels by reverse transcription real time PCR under these different growth conditions mirrored the effects seen for FVII protein levels (Fig. 1C). Thus, limitation of glucose/insulin increased expression from the endogenous FVII gene in hepatoma cells at both mRNA and protein levels, and this effect was reversed by reintroduction of these compounds. Identification of a Glucose Response Element in the FVII Promoter—Many changes in hepatic gene expression are transcriptionally mediated, and it has been shown that the transcriptional process is primarily responsible for changes in FVII plasma levels (42Greenberg D. Kim C.H. Ho W.T. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12347-12351Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 43Pollak E.S. Kim H.L. Godin W. Overton G.C. High K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1738-1747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To determine whether the observed effects of glucose and insulin on FVII mRNA and protein levels were due to transcriptional mechanisms, reporter gene assays were performed with vectors having various length fragments of FVII 5′-flanking sequence, placed upstream of the hGH reporter gene in promoterless plasmid pOGH. These vectors were used for transient transfection of HepG2 cells under standard or glucose/insulin depleted conditions, as shown in Fig. 2A. In this promoter deletion analysis, all vectors were responsive and had increased expression when glucose and insulin were restricted, thus recapitulating the effect seen for the endogenous FVII gene in untransfected cells. The presence of a functional promoter element residing within the minimal promoter segment was suggested by the sensitivity of even p-108/1, the smallest promoter construct tested, to glucose/insulin deprivation. Previous characterizations of the FVII 5′-flanking region by DNase I footprinting, EMSA, and mutational analyses indicated that two regions within the minimal promoter, –40 to –70 and –84 to –108, are necessary and sufficient for liver-specific expression of the FVII gene. The former region binds hepatic nuclear factor 4 (HNF4), a transcription factor prominent in liver, and the latter binds the ubiquitously distributed transcription factor Sp1. When either the HNF4 or the Sp1 target area was disrupted by mutagenesis, binding to these nuclear proteins was prevented, and expression of the reporter gene was greatly reduced (42Greenberg D. Kim C.H. Ho W.T. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12347-12351Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 43Pollak E.S. Kim H.L. Godin W. Overton G.C. High K.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22988-22996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Subsequent analyses of the causal molecular defects in several unrelated patients with the hereditary bleeding disorder, FVII deficiency, showed that each carried a single base mutation in the FVII 5′-flanking region, confirming the importance of these promoter regions to in vivo FVII expression. These mutations are C to T at position –55 (45Carew J.A. Kim E.S. Lopaciuk S. Bauer K.A. Blood. 2000; 96: 4370-4372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), T to G at position –59 (46Kavlie A. Kim L. Rasi V. Prydz H. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 90: 194-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), T to C at position –60 (47Tidd T. Kim R. Beaverson K. Dimichele D. High K.A. Pollak E.S. Thromb. Haemost.

Haematol. 2002; 119: 1052-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In vitro analyses indicate that each mutation impairs expression of a reporter gene, whereas EMSA indicates that the four former mutations disturb interaction with HNF4 and the two latter with Sp1. Additional footprinted areas within the minimal promoter of FVII have been also been described, although transcriptional regulators interacting with these regions (–51 to –32 and –13 to +6) are largely unknown (46Kavlie A. Kim L. Rasi V. Prydz H. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 90: 194-205C"
