https://openalex.org/W3035459690,"Countermeasures to prevent and treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are a global health priority. We enrolled a cohort of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-recovered participants, developed neutralization assays to investigate antibody responses, adapted our high-throughput antibody generation pipeline to rapidly screen more than 1800 antibodies, and established an animal model to test protection. We isolated potent neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) to two epitopes on the receptor binding domain (RBD) and to distinct non-RBD epitopes on the spike (S) protein. As indicated by maintained weight and low lung viral titers in treated animals, the passive transfer of a nAb provides protection against disease in high-dose SARS-CoV-2 challenge in Syrian hamsters. The study suggests a role for nAbs in prophylaxis, and potentially therapy, of COVID-19. The nAbs also define protective epitopes to guide vaccine design."
https://openalex.org/W3034548712,"Antibodies targeting the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) present a promising approach to combat the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic; however, concerns remain that mutations can yield antibody resistance. We investigated the development of resistance against four antibodies to the spike protein that potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2, individually as well as when combined into cocktails. These antibodies remain effective against spike variants that have arisen in the human population. However, novel spike mutants rapidly appeared after in vitro passaging in the presence of individual antibodies, resulting in loss of neutralization; such escape also occurred with combinations of antibodies binding diverse but overlapping regions of the spike protein. Escape mutants were not generated after treatment with a noncompeting antibody cocktail."

Recently, two separate approaches yielded successful antibody treatments for Ebola—one from genetically humanized mice and the other from a human survivor. Here, we describe parallel efforts using both humanized mice and convalescent patients to generate antibodies against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein, which yielded a large collection of fully human antibodies that were characterized for binding, neutralization, and three-dimensional structure. On the basis of these criteria, we selected pairs of highly potent individual antibodies that simultaneously bind the receptor binding domain of the spike protein, thereby providing ideal partners for a therapeutic antibody cocktail that aims to decrease the potential for virus escape mutants that might arise in response to selective pressure from a single-antibody treatment."

Brouwer et al. isolated 403 monoclonal antibodies from three convalescent COVID-19 patients. They show that the patients had strong immune responses against the viral spike protein, a complex that binds to receptors on the host cell. A subset of antibodies was able to neutralize the virus. Competition and electron microscopy studies showed that these antibodies target diverse epitopes on the spike, with the two most potent targeting the domain that binds the host receptor.

We combine data on demography, contact patterns, disease severity, and health care capacity and quality to understand its impact and inform strategies for its control. Younger populations in lower-income countries may reduce overall risk, but limited health system capacity coupled with closer intergenerational contact largely negates this benefit. Mitigation strategies that slow but do not interrupt transmission will still lead to COVID-19 epidemics rapidly overwhelming health systems, with substantial excess deaths in lower-income countries resulting from the poorer health care available. Of countries that have undertaken suppression to date, lower-income countries have acted earlier. However, this will need to be maintained or triggered more frequently in these settings to keep below available health capacity, with associated detrimental consequences for the wider health, well-being, and economies of these countries."
https://openalex.org/W3034816694,"Seeking broad protection As scientists develop therapeutic antibodies and vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the risk of emergent coronaviruses makes it important to also identify broadly protective antibodies. Wec et al. isolated and characterized hundreds of antibodies against the viral spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 from the memory B cells of a survivor of the 2003 outbreak caused by the related coronavirus, SARS-CoV. In both of these viruses, the spike protein facilitated viral entry by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on human cells. The antibodies targeted multiple sites on the spike protein, but of nine antibodies that showed strong cross-neutralization, eight targeted the domain that binds to ACE2. These eight antibodies also neutralized a bat SARS-related virus. Illuminating the epitopes on the viral spike protein that bind cross-neutralizing antibodies could guide the design of broadly protective vaccines. Science , this issue p. 731"

https://openalex.org/W3034974614,"Cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein (CIS; encoded by the gene CISH) is a key negative regulator of interleukin-15 (IL-15) signaling in natural killer (NK) cells. Here, we develop human CISH-knockout (CISH-/-) NK cells using an induced pluripotent stem cell-derived NK cell (iPSC-NK cell) platform. CISH-/- iPSC-NK cells demonstrate increased IL-15-mediated JAK-STAT signaling activity. Consequently, CISH-/- iPSC-NK cells exhibit improved expansion and increased cytotoxic activity against multiple tumor cell lines when maintained at low cytokine concentrations. CISH-/- iPSC-NK cells display significantly increased in vivo persistence and inhibition of tumor progression in a leukemia xenograft model. Mechanistically, CISH-/- iPSC-NK cells display improved metabolic fitness characterized by increased basal glycolysis, glycolytic capacity, maximal mitochondrial respiration, ATP-linked respiration, and spare respiration capacity mediated by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling that directly contributes to enhanced NK cell function. Together, these studies demonstrate that CIS plays a key role to regulate human NK cell metabolic activity and thereby modulate anti-tumor activity."

Previously, we and others developed cytosine base editors (CBEs) and adenine base editors (ABEs) (Rees and Liu, 2018Rees H.A. Liu D.R.

To date, these properties have been gleaned by analyzing editing outcomes at a modest number of genomic sites, often chosen to align with previous genome editing studies (Gehrke et al., 2018Gehrke J.M.

The interplay between base editor and target sequence, however, influences editing outcomes in complex and occasionally unintuitive ways. As a result, obtaining a desired genotype with desired efficiencies often requires empirical optimization of base editor and single guide RNA (sgRNA) choice for each target. Some viable targets that do not fit canonical guidelines for base editing use may be overlooked, because simple guidelines for target selection do not fully capture the scope of base editing. A systematic and comprehensive analysis of sequence and deaminase determinants of base editing would enhance our understanding of base editors, facilitate their use in precision editing applications, and guide the development of new base editors. In this study, we developed libraries of 38,538 total pairs of sgRNAs and target sequences and integrated them into the genomes of three mammalian cell types to comprehensively characterize base editing outcomes and sequence-activity relationships for eight popular CBEs and ABEs. We analyzed the roles of deaminases, sequence context, and cell type in determining genotypes that result from base editing and developed a machine learning model that accurately predicts base editing outcomes, including many previously unpredictable features, at any target site of interest. Using the resulting information, we applied a variety of base editors, including newly engineered variants, to precisely correct 3,388 genotypes and 2,399 coding sequences of disease-associated SNVs to wild-type with ≥90% precision, including by non-canonical base editing outcomes. These findings substantially extend our understanding of base editing and reveal new capabilities of both new and previously described base editors. To refine our understanding of sequence features that govern base editing outcomes, we sought to develop a comprehensive and unbiased approach to characterizing base editors. We designed libraries of 4,000 or 12,000 oligonucleotides, each up to 176 nt long, encoding unique 20-nt sgRNA spacers paired with target sequences (Shen et al., 2018Shen M.W. Arbab M. Hsu J.Y.

To detect editing outcomes with high sensitivity, we maintained an average coverage of ≥300× per library cassette and performed high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of the target sites at an average sequencing depth of ≥4,000× per target.

Values are normalized to a maximum of 100. Positions with values ≥ 50% of maximum are outlined and ≥ 30% of maximum are shaded purple. Between biological replicates, the frequency of base editing outcomes among edited reads at library targets was consistent (median Pearson’s R = 0.87 across 33 conditions, Figure S1B) across editors, libraries, and cell types. Editing outcomes at library control sequences taken from the human genome were also consistent with editing outcomes at endogenous loci across five base editors with both narrow and broad editing windows (interquartile range [IQR] of R = 0.79–0.98, Figure S1C). Together, these observations suggest the data are comprehensive, consistent with endogenous editing, and at a scale not previously assessed in base editing. Analysis of base editing characteristics from outcomes at a modest number of endogenous sites is constrained by limited variability among factors that could affect outcomes, including target sequence composition, target sequence context, and locus-dependent differences in DNA-binding proteins and transcriptional state. To assess sequence-activity relationships of ABEs and CBEs in a more comprehensive manner, we investigated base editing outcomes in a genome-integrated library assay with highly diverse sequence compositions. We designed a library to enable the detection of virtually any local editing events at the target site. This library included 8,142 base editor target sequences with all possible 6-mers surrounding a substrate A or C nucleotide at protospacer position 6, and 2,496 sgRNA-target pairs that collectively contain all possible 5-mers included across positions −1 to 13 (counting the position immediately upstream of the protospacer as position 0). We refer to this collection of 10,638 library members as the “comprehensive context library.” We quantified reads containing indels and quantified base editing outcomes among the remaining reads from the observed frequencies of all possible nucleotide substitutions from protospacer positions −10 to 35 at individual sequences. Mutations statistically likely to be from DNA sequencing errors were filtered. We applied robust-rank aggregation to identify editor-specific mutation events that consistently occurred above background frequencies across replicates. These analyses handled all mutation events in an identical manner to minimize bias in the resulting editing profiles (Figures 1B, S1D, and S2; STAR Methods). These profiles revealed variation in editing window positions, distributions of base editing activity, and positional preferences among the eight different base editors tested. BE4 and evoA-BE4 edit at 50% or greater of their maximum frequency at positions 4–8 and 3–8, respectively, consistent with previous reports (Komor et al., 2017Komor A.C. Zhao K.T. Packer M.S. Gaudelli N.M. Waterbury A.L. Koblan L.W. Kim Y.B. Badran A.H. Liu D.R.

We observed a unique bimodal editing profile for eA3A-BE4, with an additional peak in activity at protospacer position 13 to up to 18% relative to the maximum editing frequency, that had not previously been reported (Gehrke et al., 2018Gehrke J.M.

The remaining editing windows detected in our assay are in general agreement with, but refine, previous reports (Supplemental Information). In this study, we define the editing window using a lowered threshold of ≥30% maximum editing frequency to include more positions that can undergo substantial base editing in our analyses. We classify editors with windows of nine or more nucleotides as wide-window editors, including ABE-CP, BE4-CP, AID-BE4, and CDA-BE4, and eight or fewer nucleotides as narrow-window editors, including ABE, BE4, evoA-BE4, and eA3A-BE4 (Figures 1B, S1D, S2A, and S2B).

Logo opacity is proportional to the motif’s Pearson’s R or AUC on held-out sequence contexts. (B) Heatmap representation of sequence motifs for cytosine base editing efficiency from logistic regression models. Rows depict individual experimental replicates across cell-types and base editors. We first calculated sequence motifs for the efficiency of canonical base editing activity in which CBEs convert C⋅G to T⋅A and ABEs convert A⋅T to G⋅C. We obtained motifs for each editor at ≥7,091 unique substrate nucleotides in their editing windows at ≥5,292 target sequences (Figure 2B) that were consistent across cell types and biological replicates (Figure S3B). These findings identify sequence context as an important determinant of editing activity across all editors with the exception of CDA-BE4, for which only 5.3% of the variance in editing efficiency is explained by target motifs in held-out sequences (variance explained = R2) compared to 15%–32% on average across all other base editors. Interestingly, we observed that evoA-BE4, which emerged from laboratory evolution to gain activity at GC motifs, acquired a relative aversion to AC targets. This newly acquired anti-preference was previously undetected from analyses at a smaller number of endogenous loci (Thuronyi et al., 2019Thuronyi B.W. Koblan L.W. Levy J.M. Yeh W.-H. Zheng C. Newby G.A. Wilson C. Bhaumik M. Shubina-Oleinik O. Holt J.R. et al.Continuous evolution of base editors with expanded target compatibility and improved activity.Nat. Biotechnol. 2019; 37: 1070-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Similarly, we find that ABE maintains some preference against AA despite its laboratory evolution that increased activity at sites with adjacent As (Gaudelli et al., 2017Gaudelli N.M. Komor A.C. Rees H.A. Packer M.S. Badran A.H. Bryson D.I. Liu D.R. Programmable base editing of A⋅T to G⋅C in genomic DNA without DNA cleavage.Nature. 2017; 551: 464-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar). These findings demonstrate that characterization of editing outcomes at many diverse sequences can reveal CBE and ABE sequence preferences with much greater sensitivity than before. Our analysis revealed several non-canonical editing outcomes. We observed G⋅C-to-A⋅T editing activity by the wide-window editors BE4-CP and AID-BE4 at PAM-distal positions 0 to −5 with mean frequencies of 1.0% and 1.8% among edited reads, respectively (Figure 1B), in contrast to the narrow-window editors evoA-BE4 and BE4 at 0.32% and 0.43% among edited reads, respectively. These rare outcomes had sequence motifs strongly resembling the reverse complement of each editor’s primary cytosine editing activity (for example GA instead of TC, for BE4 and BE4-CP), suggesting that they occur via opposite-strand cytosine deamination (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.65–0.77, p < 5.9 × 10−3, Mann-Whitney U; Figure 2B). These G⋅C-to-A⋅T edits are likely inhibited by sgRNA:DNA interactions at protospacer positions 1–20, which may explain their lower overall observed frequency in narrow-window CBEs that do not readily access PAM-distal positions. CDA-BE4 was the notable exception among wide-window editors, which actively edited C⋅G-to-T⋅A at positions −1 to 9 but induced little to no observable G⋅C-to-A⋅T editing. Cytosine transversion mutations (C to G or C to A) have previously been observed as a rare CBE outcome (Komor et al., 2016Komor A.C. Kim Y.B. Packer M.S. Zuris J.A. Liu D.R.

Hara K.Y. et al.Targeted nucleotide editing using hybrid prokaryotic and vertebrate adaptive immune systems.Science. 2016; 353: aaf8729Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). We observed a strong dependence of transversion edits on local sequence context that was consistent by editor across cell types and biological replicates (Figure S4). A preferred motif of RCTA explained 17%–37% of the variance among held-out sequences across all CBEs (Figure 2C). We observed particularly high transversion frequencies from the narrow-window editor eA3A-BE4 (Figure 1B), which averaged 12% transversions relative to the maximum C⋅G-to-T⋅A editing frequency, and a skewed ratio of C-to-G over C-to-A transversion outcomes (∼3:1 for eA3A, compared to ∼3:2 for the remaining CBEs). Together, these results reveal that local sequence context and deaminase choice can influence the frequency and specific outcome of rare CBE transversion editing events. We also identified rare editing outcomes from ABEs (Figure 1B). We observed unexpected conversion of C to G, or C to T at protospacer position 6 averaging 0.34% and 0.62% of edited reads for ABE-CP and ABE, respectively. These rare outcomes were accurately predicted by the TCY sequence motif, achieving AUC = 0.75–0.78 on held-out target sequences (p < 6.7 × 10−23, Mann-Whitney U; Figure 2D) that matches the preferred motif for canonical ABE adenine-to-guanine conversion activity (TAY), but is instead centered on a C. The similarity between these motifs, as well as the accompanying rare C⋅G-to-G⋅C and C⋅G-to-T⋅A events, suggests that these rare events occur from direct cytosine deamination by the TadA∗ active site. These observations are consistent with, and extend, a recent report of cytosine editing by ABEs (Kim et al., 2019Kim H.S. Jeong Y.K. Hur J.K. Kim J.-S. Bae S.

https://openalex.org/W3035551042,"Tumour heterogeneity encompasses both the malignant cells and their microenvironment. While heterogeneity between individual patients is known to affect the efficacy of cancer therapy, most personalized treatment approaches do not account for intratumour heterogeneity. We addressed this issue by studying the heterogeneity of nodal B-cell lymphomas by single-cell RNA-sequencing and transcriptome-informed flow cytometry. We identified transcriptionally distinct malignant subpopulations and compared their drug-response and genomic profiles. Malignant subpopulations from the same patient responded strikingly differently to anti-cancer drugs ex vivo, which recapitulated subpopulation-specific drug sensitivity during in vivo treatment. Infiltrating T cells represented the majority of non-malignant cells, whose gene-expression signatures were similar across all donors, whereas the frequencies of T-cell subsets varied significantly between the donors. Our data provide insights into the heterogeneity of nodal B-cell lymphomas and highlight the relevance of intratumour heterogeneity for personalized cancer therapy."

Our results illustrate the limitation of a single human reference and the need for high-quality genomes from diverse populations to fully discover and understand human genetic variation. Despite the progress in sampling many populations, human genomics research is still not fully reflective of the diversity found globally (Sirugo et al., 2019Sirugo G. Williams S.M. Tishkoff S.A. The missing diversity in human genetic studies.Cell. 2019; 177: 26-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Understudied populations limit our knowledge of genetic variation and population history, and their inclusion is needed to ensure that they benefit from future developments in genomic medicine. Whole-genome sequencing projects have provided unprecedented insights into the evolutionary history of our species; however, they have mostly concentrated on substitutions at individual sites, although structural variants (affecting 50 bp or more), which include deletions, duplications, inversions, and insertions, contribute a greater diversity at the nucleotide level than any other class of variation and are important in genome evolution and disease susceptibility (Huddleston and Eichler, 2016Huddleston J. Eichler E.E. An incomplete understanding of human genetic variation.Genetics. 2016; 202: 1251-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Previous studies surveying global population structural variation have examined metropolitan populations at low coverage (Sudmant et al., 2015aSudmant P.H. Rausch T. Gardner E.J. Handsaker R.E. Abyzov A. Huddleston J. Zhang Y. Ye K. Jun G.

Mallick S. Nelson B.J. Hormozdiari F. Krumm N. Huddleston J. Coe B.P. Baker C. Nordenfelt S. Bamshad M. et al.Global diversity, population stratification, and selection of human copy-number variation.Science. 2015; 349: aab3761Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), allowing broad continental comparisons but limiting detailed analysis within each continental group and population. In this study, we present the structural variation analysis of the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP)-Centre d’Etude du Polymorphism CEPH panel (Figure 1A), a dataset composed of 911 samples from 54 populations of linguistic, anthropological, and evolutionary interest (Cann et al., 2002Cann H.M. de Toma C. Cazes L. Legrand M.F. Morel V. Piouffre L. Bodmer J. Bodmer W.F. Bonne-Tamir B. Cambon-Thomsen A. et al.A human genome diversity cell line panel.Science. 2002; 296: 261-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We generate a comprehensive resource of structural variants from these diverse and understudied populations, explore the structure of different classes of structural variation, characterize regional and population-specific variants and expansions, discover putatively introgressed variants, and identify sequences missing from the GRCh38 reference. We generated 911 whole-genome sequences at an average depth of 36× and mapped reads to the GRCh38 reference (Bergström et al., 2020Bergström A. McCarthy S.A. Hui R. Almarri M.A. Ayub Q. Danecek P. Chen Y. Felkel S. Hallast P. Kamm J. et al.Insights into human genetic variation and population history from 929 diverse genomes.Science. 2020; 367: eaay5012Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). As the dataset was generated from lymphoblastoid cell lines, we searched for potential cell line artifacts by analyzing coverage across the genome and excluded samples containing multiple aneuploidies while masking regions that show more limited aberrations. We find many more gains of chromosomes than losses, and, in agreement with a previous cell line based study (Redon et al., 2006Redon R. Ishikawa S. Fitch K.R. Feuk L. Perry G.H. Andrews T.D. Fiegler H. Shapero M.H. Carson A.R. Chen W. et al.Global variation in copy number in the human genome.Nature. 2006; 444: 444-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (3313) Google Scholar), we observe that most trisomies seem to affect chromosomes 9 and 12, suggesting that they contain sequences that enhance proliferation when duplicated in culture. Nevertheless, these cell line artifacts can be readily recognized and are excluded from the results below. We identified 126,018 structural variants relative to the reference (Figure S1). These included 25,588 (∼20% of the total) that are smaller than 100 bp. We compared our dataset with published structural variation catalogs (Sudmant et al., 2015aSudmant P.H. Rausch T. Gardner E.J. Handsaker R.E. Abyzov A. Huddleston J. Zhang Y. Ye K. Jun G. Fritz M.H.Y. et al.1000 Genomes Project ConsortiumAn integrated map of structural variation in 2,504 human genomes.Nature. 2015; 526: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar, Sudmant et al., 2015bSudmant P.H.

Bamshad M. et al.Global diversity, population stratification, and selection of human copy-number variation.Science. 2015; 349: aab3761Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and find that ∼78% of the variants identified in our dataset are not present in the previous studies. Despite having a smaller sample size compared with the 1000 Genomes phase 3 release (Sudmant et al., 2015aSudmant P.H. Rausch T. Gardner E.J. Handsaker R.E. Abyzov A. Huddleston J. Zhang Y. Ye K. Jun G. Fritz M.H.Y. et al.1000 Genomes Project ConsortiumAn integrated map of structural variation in 2,504 human genomes.Nature. 2015; 526: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar), we discover a higher total number of variants across all different classes of variants investigated. These previously unidentified calls are not limited to rare variants, as a considerable number of common and even high-frequency variants are found in regional groups and individual populations (Figure S4). Notably, our resource identifies the abundant but understudied class of small variants (50–100 bp) that were not particularly characterized by the Simons Genome Diversity Project (Sudmant et al., 2015bSudmant P.H. Mallick S. Nelson B.J. Hormozdiari F. Krumm N. Huddleston J. Coe B.P. Baker C. Nordenfelt S. Bamshad M. et al.Global diversity, population stratification, and selection of human copy-number variation.Science. 2015; 349: aab3761Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). At this size range, ∼91% of variants in our dataset are not present in either published catalog. Collectively, this illustrates that a substantial amount of global structural variation was previously undocumented, emphasizing the importance of studying underrepresented human populations. A uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) of deletion genotypes shows clear separation of continental groups, and in many cases, even individual populations are distinguished (Figure 1B). Deeply divergent African populations, such as the Mbuti, Biaka, and San, form their own clusters away from the rest of the African populations. Admixed groups, such as the Hazara and Uygur, cluster separately from the Central and South Asian and East Asian groups, whereas populations that experienced high rates of genetic drift, such as the Kalash, in addition to American and Oceanian populations, are clearly differentiated. For less clearly defined populations projecting into continental clusters, we observe examples of finer structure with samples from individual populations appearing closer to themselves relative to other groups. Insertions, duplications, multiallelic variants, and inversions also show some degree of population structure, although less defined in comparison with deletions (Figures 1C–1E and S2). Strikingly, the Oceanian populations always remain well differentiated. Consequently, we find that all classes of genetic variation show population structure, with the observed differences likely reflecting the varying mutational patterns generating each class of structural variant in addition to the overall number of discovered variants in each class.Figure S2Population Structure, Related to Figure 1 and STAR MethodsShow full captionNo batch effects identified between samples prepared using different library preparations and sequenced in different centers.

We assessed the relationship between average population differentiation and the maximal variant allele frequency difference for each population pair (Figures 2A–2C). Outliers in this relationship (i.e., variants that show a higher allele frequency difference than expected) have been proposed to be under selection (Coop et al., 2009Coop G. Pickrell J.K. Novembre J. Kudaravalli S. Li J. Absher D. Myers R.M. Cavalli-Sforza L.L. Feldman M.W. Pritchard J.K.

Somel M. et al.Altitude adaptation in Tibetans caused by introgression of Denisovan-like DNA.Nature. 2014; 512: 194-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Deletions and insertions show similar distributions, whereas biallelic duplications display lower stratification. We do see some notable outliers; for example, the Lowland/Sepik Papuans are almost fixed (86%) for a deletion in HBA2, which is absent in Papuan highlanders (p < 0.001, population stratification test using 1,000 permutations; STAR Methods). High frequencies of α-globin deletions have been suggested to be protective against malaria, which is not found in the highlands of Papua New Guinea but is present in the lowlands (Yenchitsomanus et al., 1985Yenchitsomanus P.T. Summers K.M. Bhatia K.K. Cattani J. Board P.G. Extremely high frequencies of alpha-globin gene deletion in Madang and on Kar Kar Island, Papua New Guinea.Am. J. Hum.

Boyce A.J. et al.High frequencies of α-thalassaemia are the result of natural selection by malaria.Nature. 1986; 321: 744-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Papuan highlanders have a small insertion (123 bp) near an exon of VGLL4 at 93% frequency, which is markedly less common in Papuan lowlanders (7%, p = 0.001). We also find a deletion within MYO5B that is particularly common (88%) in the Lahu from China (Lahu-Hezhen, p = 0.001), a population shown to have high numbers of private single-nucleotide variants in addition to carrying rare Y chromosome lineages (Bergström et al., 2020Bergström A. McCarthy S.A. Hui R. Almarri M.A. Ayub Q. Danecek P. Chen Y. Felkel S. Hallast P. Kamm J. et al.Insights into human genetic variation and population history from 929 diverse genomes.Science. 2020; 367: eaay5012Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The large number of samples per population allowed us to investigate population-private variants (Figure S3). We searched for functional effects of such variants and found a 14-kb deletion in the South American Karitiana population at 40% frequency. This variant removes the 5′ upstream region of MGAM up to the first exon, potentially inactivating the gene that encodes maltase-glucoamylase, an enzyme highly expressed in the small intestine and involved in digestion of dietary starches (Nichols et al., 2003Nichols B.L. Avery S. Sen P. Swallow D.M. Hahn D. Sterchi E. The maltase-glucoamylase gene: common ancestry to sucrase-isomaltase with complementary starch digestion activities.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 1432-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a recent ancient DNA study of South Americans has suggested that selection acted on this gene in ancient Andean individuals, possibly as a result of their transition to agriculture (Lindo et al., 2018Lindo J. Haas R. Hofman C. Apata M. Moraga M. Verdugo R.A. Watson J.T. Viviano Llave C. Witonsky D. Beall C. et al.The genetic prehistory of the Andean highlands 7000 years BP though European contact.Sci. Adv. 2018; 4: u4921Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This gene has also been proposed to be under selection in dogs due to adaptation to a starch-rich diet during domestication (Axelsson et al., 2013Axelsson E. Ratnakumar A. Arendt M.L. Maqbool K. Webster M.T. Perloski M. Liberg O. Arnemo J.M. Hedhammar A. Lindblad-Toh K. The genomic signature of dog domestication reveals adaptation to a starch-rich diet.Nature. 2013; 495: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The Karitiana are known to have suffered a recent population crash (Bergström et al., 2020Bergström A. McCarthy S.A. Hui R. Almarri M.A. Ayub Q. Danecek P. Chen Y. Felkel S. Hallast P. Kamm J. et al.Insights into human genetic variation and population history from 929 diverse genomes.Science. 2020; 367: eaay5012Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), and this has left a genetic consequence: they have one of the highest levels of runs of homozygosity of any human population studied to date (Ceballos et al., 2018Ceballos F.C. Joshi P.K. Clark D.W. Ramsay M. Wilson J.F. Runs of homozygosity: windows into population history and trait architecture.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2018; 19: 220-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). We detect suggestive but not strong evidence for a departure from neutrality at this locus (STAR Methods). The high frequency and presence of individuals homozygous for this deletion suggests that purifying selection on the ability to digest starch has been relaxed in the history of the Karitiana, possibly due to increased drift caused by the population decrease.Figure S4Population Stratification and Unreported Variants, Related to Figures 2A–2C and STAR MethodsShow full captionTop: Population Stratification: Maximum allele frequency difference as a function of population differentiation.

We discovered a deletion that is private and at 54% frequency in the Central African Mbuti hunter-gatherer population and deletes SIGLEC5 without removing its adjacent paired receptor, SIGLEC14 (Figure 2F). Siglecs, a family of cell-surface receptors that are expressed on immune cells, detect sialylated surface proteins expressed on host cells. Most Siglecs act as inhibitors of leukocyte activation, but SIGLEC14 is an activating member thought to have evolved by gene conversion from SIGLEC5 (Angata et al., 2006Angata T. Hayakawa T. Yamanaka M. Varki A. Nakamura M. Discovery of Siglec-14, a novel sialic acid receptor undergoing concerted evolution with Siglec-5 in primates.FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1964-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This evolution has been proposed to result in a selective advantage of combating pathogens that mimic host cells by expressing sialic acids, providing an additional activation pathway (Akkaya and Barclay, 2013Akkaya M. Barclay A.N. How do pathogens drive the evolution of paired receptors?.Eur. J. Immunol. 2013; 43: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The deletion we identify in the Mbuti, however, seems to remove the function of the inhibitory receptor while keeping the activating receptor intact. This finding is surprising, as paired receptors are thought to have evolved to fine-tune immune responses, and loss of an inhibitory receptor is hypothesized to result in immune hyperactivity and autoimmune disease (Lübbers et al., 2018Lübbers J. Rodríguez E. van Kooyk Y. Modulation of immune tolerance via Siglec-sialic acid interactions.Front. Immunol. 2018; 9: 2807Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This variant shows an extreme population branch statistic (PBS; 99.87% rank), potentially indicative of positive selection We genotyped our calls in the high-coverage Neanderthal and Denisovan archaic genomes (Meyer et al., 2012Meyer M.

We explored the frequency of this variant in our expanded dataset within each Oceanian population, and despite all of the Bougainville Islanders having significant East Asian admixture, which is not found in the Papuan highlanders, we do not find a dilution of this variant in the former population; it is present at a remarkable and similar frequency in all three Oceanian populations (∼82%). These duplications form the most extreme region-specific variants (Figures 2D and S3), and their unusual allele distribution suggests that they may have remained at high frequencies after archaic introgression due to positive selection (Table 1). We characterized this variant in more detail using fluorescent in situ hybridization (Figures 2E, S6, and S7) and found that it consists of a region of the reference sequence that has duplicated and inserted into a gene-rich region ∼7 Mb away in chr16p11.2, confirming a recent study (Hsieh et al., 2019Hsieh P.

The selective pressure acting on this duplication and its target remain unknown and require further study; however, its similar frequency across the Oceanian populations examined contrasts with the differing frequency of the malaria-associated HBA2 deletion across Oceania, suggesting that malaria infection is unlikely to be driving the signal we see at the 16p12.2 duplication.Figure S6Putatively Introgressed Variants, Related to Figure 2E and Table 1Show full captionTop: fiber-FISH of chr16 Oceanian-specific expansion shared with Denisovan genome at ∼82% frequency in all three Oceanian populations.

Here, we perform large-scale multi-electrode array recordings from retinas of treatment-naive patients who underwent enucleation surgery for choroidal malignant melanomas. We identify robust differences in the function of midget and parasol ganglion cells, consistent asymmetries between their ON and OFF types (that signal light increments and decrements, respectively) and divergence in the function of human versus non-human primate retinas. Our computational analyses reveal that the receptive fields of human midget and parasol ganglion cells divide naturalistic movies into adjacent spatiotemporal frequency domains with equal stimulus power, while the asymmetric response functions of their ON and OFF types simultaneously maximize stimulus coverage and information transmission and minimize metabolic cost. Thus, midget and parasol ganglion cells in the human retina efficiently encode our visual environment."

We conduct a unique investigation by using a controlled 3D in vitro cell model to mimic the bone microenvironment in microgravity aboard the SpaceX Dragon cargo ferry to the ISS. Osteoblasts (OBs), osteoclasts (OCs), and endothelial cells (ECs), seeded on Skelite discs, were cultured w/ or w/o rec-Irisin and exposed to 14 days of microgravity in the eOSTEO hardware. Gene expression analysis was assessed, and results were compared to ground controls treated within identical payloads. Our results show that the microgravity-induced downregulation of mRNA levels of genes encoding for OB key transcription factors (Atf4 -75%, P < .01; RunX2 -87%, P < .001, Osterix -95%, P < .05 vs ground) and proteins (Collagen I -84%, P < .05; Osteoprotegerin -94%, P < .05) were prevented by irisin. Despite it was not effective in preventing Trap and Cathepsin K mRNA increase, irisin induced a 2.8-fold increase of Osteoprotegerin (P < .05) that might act for reducing osteoclastogenesis in microgravity. Our results provide evidence that irisin supports OB differentiation and activity in microgravity and it might represent a countermeasure to prevent bone loss in astronauts."
https://openalex.org/W3034246592,"Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) program, which facilitates tumor metastasis, stemness and therapy resistance, is a reversible biological process that is largely orchestrated at the epigenetic level under the regulation of different cell signaling pathways. EMT state is often heterogeneous within individual tumors, though the epigenetic drivers underlying such heterogeneity remain elusive. In colon cancer, hyperactivation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling not only drives tumor initiation, but also promotes metastasis in late stage by promoting EMT program. However, it is unknown whether the intratumorally heterogeneous Wnt activity could directly drive EMT heterogeneity, and, if so, what are the underlying epigenetic driver(s). Here, by analyzing a phenotypically and molecularly heterogeneous colon cancer cell line using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified two distinct cell populations with positively correlated Wnt activity and EMT state. Integrative multi-omics analysis of these two cell populations revealed RUNX2 as a critical transcription factor epigenetically driving the EMT heterogeneity. Both in vitro and in vivo genetic perturbation assays validated the EMT-enhancing effect of RUNX2, which remodeled chromatin landscape and activated a panel of EMT-associated genes through binding to their promoters and/or potential enhancers. Finally, by exploring the clinical data, we showed that RUNX2 expression is positively correlated with metastasis development and poor survival of colon cancer patients, as well as patients afflicted with other types of cancer. Taken together, our work revealed RUNX2 as a new EMT-promoting epigenetic regulator in colon cancer, which may potentially serve as a prognostic marker for tumor metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W3034426389,"Defective DNA damage response (DDR) signaling is a common mechanism that initiates and maintains the cellular senescence phenotype. Dysfunctional telomeres activate DDR signaling, genomic instability, and cellular senescence, but the links among these events remains unclear. Here, using an array of biochemical and imaging techniques, including a highly regulatable CRISPR/Cas9 strategy to induce DNA double strand breaks specifically in the telomeres, ChIP, telomere immunofluorescence, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), micronuclei imaging, and the telomere shortest length assay (TeSLA), we show that chromosome mis-segregation due to imperfect DDR signaling in response to dysfunctional telomeres creates a preponderance of chromatin fragments in the cytosol, which leads to a premature senescence phenotype. We found that this phenomenon is caused not by telomere shortening, but by cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS) recognizing cytosolic chromatin fragments and then activating the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway and downstream interferon signaling. Significantly, genetic and pharmacological manipulation of cGAS not only attenuated immune signaling, but also prevented premature cellular senescence in response to dysfunctional telomeres. The findings of our study uncover a cellular intrinsic mechanism involving the cGAS-mediated cytosolic self-DNA–sensing pathway that initiates premature senescence independently of telomere shortening."

https://openalex.org/W3035413654,"The accurate timing and execution of organelle biogenesis is crucial for cell physiology. Centriole biogenesis is regulated by Polo-like kinase 4 (Plk4) and initiates in S-phase when a daughter centriole grows from the side of a pre-existing mother. Here, we show that a Plk4 oscillation at the base of the growing centriole initiates and times centriole biogenesis to ensure that centrioles grow at the right time and to the right size. The Plk4 oscillation is normally entrained to the cell-cycle oscillator but can run autonomously of it-potentially explaining why centrioles can duplicate independently of cell-cycle progression. Mathematical modeling indicates that the Plk4 oscillation can be generated by a time-delayed negative feedback loop in which Plk4 inactivates the interaction with its centriolar receptor through multiple rounds of phosphorylation. We hypothesize that similar organelle-specific oscillations could regulate the timing and execution of organelle biogenesis more generally."

Structural investigations have demonstrated that peptides are typically presented in an extended linear conformation, held in place by a comprehensive hydrogen-bonding network with the HLA binding groove. Aromatic residues within the HLA molecule, including Trp-167 and Tyr-84, restrict the size of the A and F pockets of HLA that accommodate the peptide N and C termini, respectively. Selectivity for different peptides is primarily driven by the N-terminal (peptide residue 1 or 2) and C-terminal peptide residue side chains, which are anchored by highly polymorphic HLA-binding pockets (22Bjorkman P.J.

Structure of the complex between human T-cell receptor, viral peptide and HLA-A2.Nature. 1996; 384 (8906788): 134-14110.1038/384134a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar). TCRs normally bind to pHLA with a diagonal geometry over the center of the peptide, enabling the TCR complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops to engage solvent-exposed residues on both the peptide and the HLA helices (24Rossjohn J. Gras S. Miles J.J. Turner S.J. Godfrey D.I. McCluskey J. T cell antigen receptor recognition of antigen-presenting molecules.Annu. Rev.

This orientation allows the somatically rearranged CDR3 loops to form the majority of direct peptide contacts, whereas the germline-encoded CDR1 and CDR2 loops generally form interactions with the HLA α1 and α2 helices (25Cole D.K.

In this study, we solved the structure of a newly identified TCR in complex with an HLA-A*02:01 restricted melanoma antigen-A4 (MAGE-A4) peptide (GVYDGREHTV), hereafter referred to as A2-GVY. A2-GVY is a key oncology target because it is expressed by many tumors, including esophageal, head and neck, lung, ovarian, bladder, breast, lymphomas, and melanoma (34Marchand M. van Baren N.

This enabled the TCR to achieve peptide selectivity for A2-GVY via a novel indirect mechanism whereby the TCR sensed the peptide features through an HLA residue, which acted as a tunable gateway or bridge. The altered side-chain conformation of this HLA residue was an antigenic feature for the TCR, correlating with the shifted binding footprint, to provide exquisite selectivity for the MAGE-A4 peptide N-terminal residue. Overall, our molecular characterization of TCR binding to a clinically relevant MAGE-A4 epitope extends our understanding of the general rules that underpin TCR antigen recognition. Following stimulation with peptide, we isolated an A2-GVY–specific TCR (GVY01) from CD8+ T cells from healthy HLA-A*02:01-positive donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The GVY01 TCR was identified from a panel of TCRs sequenced from A2-GVY tetramer-positive CD8+ T cells, and selected based on its ability to be expressed and refolded as a soluble molecule in bacteria and its ability to bind to A2-GVY in biophysical experiments. A structure of the GVY01-A2-GVY TCR-pHLA trimolecular complex was solved to 3 Å resolution (Table 1). The structure was characterized by well-defined observed electron density around the TCR-pHLA interface (Fig. S1). The GVY01 TCR bound to A2-GVY in a position shifted toward the peptide N terminus. Other TCR-pHLA interaction parameters were more typical (24Rossjohn J. Gras S. Miles J.J. Turner S.J. Godfrey D.I. McCluskey J.

However, its N-terminal shift abrogated its ability to make direct contacts with the third HLA restriction triad residue, Gln-155. Aside from these residues, the GVY01 TCR made most contacts with HLA residues Glu-166 and Trp-167, and peptide contacts were focused toward Asp-4, with Arg-6 making the second highest number of contacts with the GVY01 TCR (Table S1 and Fig. 1C). These interactions resulted in a total TCR-pHLA buried surface area of 2018 Å2 and ∼30% of the total contacts with the GVY peptide, which are both within the normal range for TCR-pHLA complexes (24Rossjohn J.

Importantly, the TCR-pHLA contact interface at Asp-4 and Arg-6 did not require major structural remodeling of A2-GVY (Fig. 2B), as has been observed for other TCR-pHLA interactions (31Tynan F.E.

Further inspection of the GVY01-A2-GVY TCR-pHLA trimolecular complex revealed that TCR CDR1α residue Pro-29 stacked closely against HLA residue Trp-167 (estimated ΔG = −1.9 kcal mol), which in turn packed against peptide position Gly-1 (estimated ΔG = −2.5 kcal mol), forming an indirect bridge between the TCR and peptide residue Gly-1 (Fig. 3A). This relatively strong indirect TCR-peptide interaction opened the possibility that the TCR might be able to sense the chemical properties of the peptide residue in this position. Reanalysis of the trimolecular complex structure of another N-terminally shifted TCR, CF34 (26Gras S. Burrows S.R. Kjer-Nielsen L. Clements C.S. Liu Y.C. Sullivan L.C. Bell M.J. Brooks A.G. Purcell A.W. McCluskey J. Rossjohn J. The shaping of T cell receptor recognition by self-tolerance.Immunity. 2009; 30 (19167249): 193-20310.1016/j.immuni.2008.11.011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), demonstrated a similar indirect interaction between the TCR CDR1α residue Pro-30 and peptide residue Phe-1 via HLA residue Trp-167, despite Trp-167 being shifted back toward the HLAα2 helices to accommodate the larger peptide P1 side chain in this structure (Fig. 3B). Thus, this observation is not isolated to the GVY01 TCR and may represent a more general TCR mechanism to sense peptide and achieve pHLA binding specificity. We reanalyzed the structures of several other peptide-HLA-A*02:01 complexes with different amino acids at peptide residue 1 (Fig. 3C and Fig. S2). This analysis revealed that Trp-167 acts as a molecular gateway, altering its angle with respect to the HLAα2 helices, depending on the identity of peptide residue 1. Peptides with Gly-1 formed the first distinct family with respect to the position of Trp-167. For peptides with Ala at position 1, Trp-167 substantially altered its position to accommodate the slightly larger side chain, representing a second family. Ser, Thr, and Cys at peptide position 1 represented a third mechanism of distinct positioning of Trp-167, and three further families were apparent; the fourth with Val, Ile, Leu, and Pro; the fifth with Phe and Tyr; and the sixth with Glu, Asp, Arg, and Lys (Fig. S2). These observations suggested that the GVY01 TCR might be sensitive to peptide alterations at position 1, despite making no direct contact with this peptide residue. The refolded soluble GVY01 TCR extracellular domain bound to A2-GVY with a KD of 160 μm as measured by surface plasmon resonance (Fig. 3D). This is within the binding affinity range of other tumor-specific TCRs (7Bridgeman J.S. Sewell A.K. Miles J.J. Price D.A. Cole D.K.

Binding affinity measurements of the GVY01 TCR to A2-GVY containing a G1A peptide mutation (the most conservative mutation possible) demonstrated a complete loss of binding (Fig. 3E). To explore this finding further, we solved the co-complex structure of A2-AVY at 1.35 Å (Table 1 and Fig. S1). A superposition of A2-GVY in the GVY01-A2-GVY TCR-pHLA trimolecular complex with the A2-AVY co-complex demonstrated that an Ala in position 1 would result in the CH2 of HLA residue Trp-167 shifting 1.6 Å toward TCR CDR1α loop residue Pro-29, disrupting the indirect interaction between the GVY01 TCR and the peptide through steric hindrance (Fig. 3F). A2-GVY is an important therapeutic target for a broad range of tumors. Thus, we used our previously described methods (39Li Y. Moysey R. Molloy P.E. Vuidepot A.-L. Mahon T. Baston E. Dunn S. Liddy N. Jacob J. Jakobsen B.K. Boulter J.M. Directed evolution of human T-cell receptors with picomolar affinities by phage display.Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23 (15723046): 349-35410.1038/nbt1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) to engineer an affinity-enhanced version of the GVY01 TCR, which contained four mutations in the CDR3β loop (Fig. 4, A and B). The selectivity of this affinity-enhanced GVY01 TCR (GVY01_αwtβ1) was determined by measuring its binding affinity to pHLA variants with individual peptide alanine substitutions. As with the GVY01 TCR, the GVY01_αwtβ1 TCR was also highly sensitive to changes at peptide position 1 (Fig. 4B). However, compared with the GVY01 TCR, the GVY01_αwtβ1 TCR bound to all of the peptide alanine mutants, including G1A, with a measurable affinity, thereby enabling a better comparison of the effects of point mutations in the TCR on the bridge between peptide residue 1 and Trp-167. For these analyses, we generated an alternative version of the GVY01_αwtβ1 TCR in which Pro-29 (the main TCR residue contacting HLA residue Trp-167) was mutated to Ala (GVY01_αwtβ1_P29A). For the GVY01_αwtβ1 TCR, a G1A peptide substitution reduced the binding affinity by 115-fold, whereas the GVY01_αwtβ1_P29A mutated TCR bound with only a 7-fold loss in affinity (Fig. 4C). Full analysis of Ala mutations along the peptide also confirmed these differences, in that, for the GVY01_αwtβ1 TCR, a G1A peptide substitution was the most detrimental to binding, whereas for the GVY01_αwtβ1_P29A TCR, G1A substitution made much less of an impact (Fig. 4D and Fig. S3).

Hfq is an RNA-binding protein present in diverse bacterial lineages that contributes to many different aspects of RNA metabolism during gene expression. Using photoactivated localization microscopy and single-molecule tracking, we demonstrate that Hfq forms a distinct and reversible focus-like structure in Escherichia coli specifically experiencing long-term nitrogen starvation. Using the ability of T7 phage to replicate in nitrogen-starved bacteria as a biological probe of E. coli cell function during nitrogen starvation, we demonstrate that Hfq foci have a role in the adaptive response of E. coli to long-term nitrogen starvation. We further show that Hfq foci formation does not depend on gene expression once nitrogen starvation has set in and occurs indepen-dently of the transcription factor N-regulatory protein C, which activates the initial adaptive response to N starvation in E. coli.

These results serve as a paradigm to demonstrate that bacterial adaptation to long-term nutrient starvation can be spatiotemporally coordinated and can occur independently of de novo gene expression during starvation. Bacteria in their natural environments seldom encounter conditions that support continuous growth. Hence, many bacteria spend the majority of their time in a state of little or no growth, because they are starved of essential nutrients including carbon, nitrogen, and transitional metals. To maximize chances of survival during prolonged periods of nutrient starvation and facilitate optimal growth resumption when nutrients become replenished, bacteria have evolved complex adaptive strategies. Bacteria initially respond to nutrient deficiency by remodeling gene expression through the synthesis and degradation of RNA. Nitrogen (N) is an essential element of most macromolecules in a bacterial cell, including proteins, nucleic acids, and cell wall components. Thus, unsurprisingly, when Escherichia coli cells experience N starvation, they attenuate growth and elicit nitrogen stress response (Ntr response). The Ntr response is activated by the transcription factor Nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) concomitantly with N runout. By directly activating the transcription of relA, the gene responsible for the synthesis of the major bacterial stress signaling nucleotide guanosine pentaphosphate, NtrC couples the Ntr response with the stringent response (1Brown D.R. Barton G. Pan Z. Buck M. Wigneshweraraj S. Combinatorial stress responses: direct coupling of two major stress responses in Escherichia coli.Microb.

The Ntr response primarily involves the synthesis of proteins associated with transport and assimilation of nitrogenous compounds into glutamine and glutamate, either catabolically or by reducing the requirement for them in other cellular processes (1Brown D.R.

To form productive interactions with target mRNAs, most sRNAs require an RNA-binding protein. In many bacteria of diverse lineages, the RNA-binding protein Hfq plays a central and integral role in sRNA-mediated regulation of gene expression. Emerging results now reveal that Hfq has diverse gene regulatory functions in bacteria that expand beyond its widely understood role in catalyzing sRNA–mRNA base pairing. These include rRNA processing and assembly of functional ribosomes (12Andrade J.M. dos Santos R.F. Chelysheva I. Ignatova Z. Arraiano C.M.

Recently, Hfq was shown to contribute to the distribution of sRNAs to the poles of E. coli cells experiencing envelope stress, suggesting a role for Hfq in spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression (18Kannaiah S. Livny J. Amster-Choder O. Spatiotemporal organization of the E. coli transcriptome: translation independence and engagement in regulation.Mol. Cell. 2019; 76 (31540875): 574-589.e710.1016/j.molcel.2019.08.013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although previous studies have demonstrated a role for Hfq in the Ntr response in the N2-fixing symbiont Sinorhizobium meliloti (19Robledo M. García-Tomsig N.I. Jiménez-Zurdo J.I. Riboregulation in nitrogen-fixing endosymbiotic bacteria.Microorganisms. 2020; 8 (32164262): 38410.3390/microorganisms8030384Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar), the role of Hfq-mediated riboregulation in the Ntr response of enterobacteria remains unknown. Hence, the initial aim of this study was to investigate the role of Hfq in regulating the flow of genetic information during the Ntr response in E. coli. However, unexpectedly, we uncovered a property of Hfq, which appears to occur independently of changes in gene expression elicited by the NtrC-activated Ntr response, but one that is important for adapting to long-term N starvation. To determine whether Hfq has a role in the adaptive response of E. coli to N starvation, we grew a batch culture of WT and Δhfq E. coli in a highly defined minimal growth medium with a limiting amount (3 mm) of NH4Cl as the sole N source (20Brown D.R. Barton G. Pan Z. Buck M. Wigneshweraraj S. Nitrogen stress response and stringent response are coupled in Escherichia coli.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 (24947454)411510.1038/ncomms5115Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, when NH4Cl (i.e. N) in the growth medium runs out (N−; Fig. 1A), the bacteria enter a state of complete N starvation and subsequent growth attenuation (20Brown D.R. Barton G. Pan Z. Buck M. Wigneshweraraj S. Nitrogen stress response and stringent response are coupled in Escherichia coli.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 (24947454)411510.1038/ncomms5115Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Control experiments revealed that, under our experimental conditions, even 24 h after N had run out (N–24), sufficient glucose still remains available in the growth medium to support growth (12, 10, and 5 mm at N+, N−, and N–24), and consistent with this view, in previous work, we showed that addition of NH4Cl to cultures at N− or 24 h after N starvation (N–24) can restart growth (21Figueira R. Brown D.R. Ferreira D. Eldridge M.J. Burchell L. Pan Z. Helaine S. Wigneshweraraj S. Adaptation to sustained nitrogen starvation by Escherichia coli requires the eukaryote-like serine/threonine kinase YeaG.Sci. Rep. 2015; 5 (26621053)1752410.1038/srep17524Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, the initial growth rate (μ) of WT (μ = 64.0 ± 0.30 min/generation) and Δhfq (μ = 67.3 ± 1.28 min/generation) E. coli at N+ did not differ greatly. However, as the ammonium chloride levels became gradually depleted (ND; Fig. 1A), the growth rate of the Δhfq (μ = 71.3 ± 3.45 min/generation) dropped by ∼8% relative to WT bacteria (μ = 66.1 ± 0.26 min/generation). Both strains attenuated growth at N−, when ammonium chloride levels were depleted (Fig. 1A). We then measured the number of colony-forming units (CFU) in the population of WT and Δhfq bacteria as a function of time under N starvation. As shown in Fig. 1B, the proportion of viable cells in the WT population moderately increased over the initial 24 h under N starvation but gradually declined as N starvation ensued beyond 24 h. This initial moderate increase in the portion of viable cells over the initial 24 h was not observed for Δhfq bacteria (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the portion of viable cells in the Δhfq population rapidly decreased as N starvation ensued. For example, at N–24, only ∼27% of the Δhfq mutant population was viable compared with the WT population (Fig. 1B). After 168 h under N starvation (N-168), the majority (∼99%) of bacteria in the Δhfq population were nonviable relative to bacteria in the WT population (Fig. 1B). The viability defect of Δhfq bacteria was partially reversible to WT levels when hfq was exogenously supplied via a plasmid (Fig. 1B, inset). Because Hfq is a pleiotropic regulator of bacterial stress adaptation that largely manifests its effects via functioning as the positive regulator of expression of rpoS (22Battesti A. Majdalani N. Gottesman S. The RpoS-mediated general stress response in Escherichia coli.Annu. Rev.

To investigate this, we calculated, as above, the number of CFUs in the population of ΔrpoS bacteria as a function of time under N starvation. The results revealed that, following 24–48 h of N starvation, the ΔrpoS bacteria were significantly better at surviving N starvation than Δhfq bacteria (Fig. 1B). For example, at N–24, ∼82% of ΔrpoS were viable relative to WT bacteria. In contrast, at N–24, only ∼27% of the Δhfq bacteria were viable. After 48 h under N starvation, the ΔrpoS bacteria displayed a better ability to survive N starvation than the Δhfq bacteria (Fig. 1B). Overall, the results demonstrate that the absence of Hfq compromises the ability of E. coli to survive N starvation in a manner that is, to a large extent, independent of Hfq's other roles in bacterial stress adaptation, notably regulation of rpoS. Because the T7 phage can infect and replicate in exponentially growing and stationary phase (i.e. nutrient-starved) E. coli cells equally well (26Tabib-Salazar A. Liu B. Barker D. Burchell L. Qimron U. Matthews S.J. Wigneshweraraj S. T7 phage factor required for managing RpoS in Escherichia coli.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In other words, we expected that, because T7 heavily relies on bacterial resources for replication, any perturbations to these resources, caused by a dysfunctional ability of the Δhfq bacteria to adjust to N starvation, could have a negative impact on the efficacy of T7 replication. Because after 24 h under N starvation there is a substantial decrease in the proportion of viable cells in the Δhfq population (Fig. 1B), we initially compared the time it took for T7 to decrease the starting density (A600 nm) of the culture of WT bacteria at the onset of N starvation (N−) and at N–24 by ∼50% (Tlysis) following infection. We did this by resuspending bacteria from N− and N–24 in medium containing ∼3 mm NH4Cl and T7 phage (NH4Cl was added to reactivate cellular processes that might be required for T7 infection but might have become repressed upon N starvation). As shown in Fig. 2A, the Tlysis values of cultures of WT bacteria at N− and N–24 were ∼62 and ∼106 min, respectively. The Tlysis of Δhfq bacteria infected at N− was delayed by ∼17 min compared with WT bacteria, and this resulted in moderate growth of the Δhfq bacterial culture before cell lysis was detectable (Fig. 2A). Strikingly, however, T7 replication was substantially compromised in Δhfq bacteria infected at N–24 (Fig. 2A), and detectable lysis of Δhfq bacteria at N–24 was delayed by ∼83 min compared with WT bacteria. This delay in lysis of Δhfq bacteria at N–24 was partially reversible to that seen in WT bacteria when hfq was exogenously supplied via a plasmid (Fig. 2B). Although we are unable to provide an explanation, we note that the Δhfq bacteria at N–24 containing the plasmid without the hfq gene (Δhfq + pBAD18 in Fig. 2B) displayed a Tlysis that was ∼162 min longer than Δhfq bacteria without the plasmid (Fig. 2A). It is possible that the increase in Tlysis seen with Δhfq bacteria at N–24 was simply due to the reduced proportion of viable cells available for T7 to infect and replicate in the mutant population compared with WT population at this time point. To explore this, we measured both viability and Tlysis as a function time under N starvation over 24 h. The results shown in Fig. 2C revealed that although the viability of the Δhfq population remains relatively stable up until N-18, there is a continual increase in Tlysis after N-9. Hence, we conclude that the observed increase in Tlysis seen with Δhfq bacteria is not simply due to the decreased proportion of viable cells in the population as N starvation ensues. However, we note that a component of the increase in Tlysis at N–24 (i.e. after N-18) could be due to a combination of the decrease in viable cells in the population, as well as the compromised metabolic capability of the N-starved cellular environment to support efficient T7 replication (caused by the absence of Hfq). Hence, we concluded that the N–24 time point is a suitable and practical (for reasons that will become apparent later) time point to use T7 to probe the metabolic capability of the cellular environment of N-starved E. coli. We next investigated whether the observed difference in Tlysis between WT and Δhfq bacteria from N–24 was specific to N starvation. Hence, we measured Tlysis in carbon-starved WT and Δhfq bacteria. This was achieved by growing bacteria in minimal growth medium with a limiting amount of carbon (0.06% (w/v) of glucose instead of 0.4% (w/v) of glucose) and excess NH4Cl (10 mm instead of 3 mm). Under these conditions, the bacteria ran out of carbon and thus became carbon-starved before the source of N is completely consumed. As shown in Fig. 2D, the dynamics of lysis of the bacterial culture immediately following onset of carbon starvation (C−) and N− were indistinguishable. However, interestingly, experiments with 24-h carbon-starved bacteria (C-24) did not produce a difference in Tlysis between WT and Δhfq bacteria (Fig. 2D) as seen with N–24 bacteria (Fig. 2A). Clearly, the compromised ability of T7 to replicate in N–24 bacteria is specific to N starvation. The results also suggest that the compromised ability of T7 to replicate in the Δhfq strain was not simply due to a requirement of T7 for Hfq for replication per se and that the ability of T7 to replicate in N-starved E. coli is a faithful reporter of E. coli cell function during N starvation. Additional experiments with the ΔrpoS strain revealed that the compromised ability of T7 to replicate in Δhfq bacteria at N–24 was not due to an indirect effect of Hfq on the regulation of rpoS (Fig. 2E). This is consis-tent with earlier results showing that the loss of viability of Δhfq bacteria as a function of time under N starvation was not solely due to the loss of rpoS activity (Fig. 1B). Overall, we conclude that the compromised ability of T7 to replicate in long-term N-starved Δhfq bacteria is predominantly due to a dysfunctional ability of mutant bacteria to adapt as N starvation ensues. To explore the molecular basis of the role of Hfq during long-term N starvation in E. coli, we used photoactivated localization microscopy combined with single-molecule tracking to study the intracellular behavior of individual Hfq molecules in live E. coli cells. To do this, we constructed an E. coli strain containing photoactivatable mCherry (PAmCherry) fused C-terminally to hfq at its normal chromosomal location. Control experiments established that the ability of (i) PAmCherry-tagged Hfq bacteria to survive N starvation (Fig. S1) and (ii) T7 phage to replicate in 24-h N-starved bacteria containing PAmCherry-tagged Hfq was indistinguishable from that of WT bacteria (Fig. S2). These results thus indicate that the presence of the PAmCherry tag on Hfq did not compromise its function under our experimental conditions. We used the apparent diffusion coefficient (D*) of individual Hfq–PAmCherry molecules, calculated from the mean squared displacement of trajectories, as a metric for the single-molecule behavior of Hfq. As shown in Fig. 3 (A and B), in bacteria at N+ and N−, the D* values of Hfq molecules were largely similar (although we note that our D* values were ∼6-fold lower than those measured by Persson et al. (28Persson F. Lindén M. Unoson C. Elf J. Extracting intracellular diffusive states and transition rates from single-molecule tracking data.Nat. Methods. 2013; 10 (23396281): 265-26910.1038/nmeth.2367Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) with Dendra2-tagged Hfq in exponentially growing E. coli in lysogeny broth, our measurements are largely consistent with those measured by Park et al. (29Park S. Emily K.P. Heideman M. Carrier M.-C. Reyer M.A. Liu W. Massé E. Dynamic interactions between the RNA chaperone Hfq, small regulatory RNAs and mRNAs in live bacterial cells.bioRxiv. 2020; 10.1101/2020.01.13.903641Google Scholar) with mMaple3-tagged Hfq in E. coli growing in defined in minimal medium). Of note, the graph in Fig. 3 (and in all subsequent figures) has a truncated x axis to emphasize the peaks of interest. In reality, D* values extend to ∼2.0 µm2/s for N+ and N− and ∼1.0 µm2/s for N–24 (Fig. S3A). At N+ and N−, there is a notable portion of Hfq molecules with a diffusion between 0.5 and 2.0 µm2/s that is not shown on the graphs in Fig. 3 and all subsequent figures, whereas at N–24 there are very few molecules with a D* of >0.5. In bacteria from N–24, we detected a large increase in the proportion of molecules with a lower D*. Strikingly, this was due to Hfq forming a single focus-like feature (∼360 nm in diameter), which was present usually, but not exclusively, at a cell pole (Fig. 3C). These features, hereafter referred to as the Hfq foci, were seen in ∼90% of the cells from N–24 that we analyzed. The D* value of the majority (∼75%) Hfq molecules within the Hfq foci was <0.08 (Fig. S3B). We collated the D* values of multiple fields of view (typically containing ∼50–300 bacterial cells/field of view) to maximize our data pool. We then used a D* of <0.08 as a threshold to define the relatively immobile population of Hfq molecules within the bacterial cells within the field of view imaged. We then calculated the proportion of all Hfq molecules within this immobile population as a percentage of total number of tracked Hfq molecules within all the bacterial cells within the same field of view imaged to derive a value (%HIM) to indirectly quantify the efficiency of foci formation by Hfq under different conditions. In other words, cells containing detectable Hfq foci will have an increased %HIM compared with cells without detectable Hfq foci and is a value that is derived from typically ∼100–500 bacterial cells. According to this criteria, the %HIM values were ∼14, ∼16, and ∼44 in bacteria at N+, N−, and N–24, respectively. The Hfq foci, once formed, persisted for at least 168 h under N starvation (Fig. S4). We did not detect any foci under identical experimental conditions in N–24 bacteria in E. coli strains with PAmCherry fused to RNA polymerase, MetJ (the DNA-binding transcriptional repressor of genes associated with methionine biosynthesis, which is similar in size to Hfq), or ProQ (a new class of sRNA-binding protein in bacteria) (30Westermann A.J.

This result suggested that foci formation is a biological property specific to Hfq. Further, we did not detect Hfq foci in bacteria that were starved for carbon for 24 h (Fig. S6). Similarly, we did not detect Hfq foci in 24-h-old stationary phase cultures grown in standard lysogeny broth (Fig. S7). These results suggest that Hfq formation is a phenomenon specific to N starvation. Consistent with this view, we also observed Hfq foci formation in 24-h-old cultures grown in medium containing 3 mm l-glutamine, d-serine, or l-aspartic acid as the sole N source (Fig. S8). Of note, although the %HIM values of the Hfq foci in 24-h N-starved bacteria grown in l-glutamine and d-serine were similar to those grown in ammonium chloride, the Hfq foci in 24-h N-starved bacteria grown in l-aspartic acid has a substantially lower %HIM value than when grown in ammonium chloride. Nevertheless, these results indicate that Hfq foci formation is a response to depletion of N source and not a response restricted to the depletion of NH4Cl. As shown in Fig. S9, the intracellular levels of Hfq did not increase over 24 h under N starvation (when foci have formed). This suggests that the Hfq foci seen in E. coli from N–24 are unlikely to be due to accumulation of Hfq as N starvation ensued. To determine whether the foci represent aberrant aggregates of Hfq molecules, we obtained the fraction of aggregated proteins (i.e. in the insoluble fraction) in bacteria from N+, N−, and N–24 (as described in Ref. 33Tomoyasu T.

As shown in Fig. S9, we did not detect Hfq in any of the fractions containing aggregated proteins. This suggests that the Hfq foci are unlikely to be aberrant aggregates of Hfq molecules.

We employed Ca2+ imaging of colonic ICC-IM in situ, using mice expressing GCaMP6f in ICC to evaluate ICC-IM responses to excitatory neurotransmission. Expression of muscarinic type 2, 3 (M2 , M3 ), and NK1 receptors were enriched in ICC-IM. NK1 receptor agonists had minimal effects on ICC-IM, whereas neostigmine and carbachol increased Ca2+ transients. These effects were reversed by DAU 5884 (M3 receptor antagonist) but not AF-DX 116 (M2 receptor antagonist). Electrical field stimulation (EFS) in the presence of L-NNA and MRS 2500 enhanced ICC-IM Ca2+ transients. Responses were blocked by atropine or DAU 5884, but not AF-DX 116. ICC-IM responses to EFS were ablated by inhibiting Ca2+ stores with cyclopiazonic acid and reduced by inhibiting Ca2+ influx via Orai channels.

To make clear the mechanism of butyrate in regulating P311, microRNAs (miRNAs) of the SV40-MES-13 cells were sequenced. We found that miR-7a-5p was significantly decreased in the HG-induced SV40-MES-13 cells and the kidney of db/db mice, while giving butyrate reversed this change. Besides, miR-7a-5p could specifically target the 3' UTR of P311’s mRNA and suppressed the expression of P311 in the SV40-MES-13 cells. Giving miR-7a-5p inhibitor blocked the inhibition of butyrate on P311 and TGF-β1. Introducing the miR-7a-5p agomir into db/db mice alleviated renal fibrosis and inhibit the expression of P311 and TGF-β1. In conclusion, butyrate alleviated DKD by mediating the miR-7a-5p/P311/TGF-β1 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3034308531,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) functions as two complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2), regulating cell growth and metabolism. Aberrant mTOR signaling occurs frequently in cancers, so mTOR has become an attractive target for cancer therapy. Iron chelators have emerged as promising anticancer agents. However, the mechanisms underlying the anticancer action of iron chelation are not fully understood. Particularly, reports on the effects of iron chelation on mTOR complexes are inconsistent or controversial. Here, we found that iron chelators consistently inhibited mTORC1 signaling, which was blocked by pretreatment with ferrous sulfate. Mechanistically, iron chelation-induced mTORC1 inhibition was not related to ROS induction, copper chelation, or PP2A activation. Instead, activation of AMPK pathway mainly and activation of both HIF-1/REDD1 and Bnip3 pathways partially contribute to iron chelation-induced mTORC1 inhibition. Our findings indicate that iron chelation inhibits mTORC1 via multiple pathways and iron is essential for mTORC1 activation."

Here, we offer first evidence that a myelin degradation product induces mechanical hypersensitivity and global transcriptomics changes in a sex-specific manner. Focusing on downstream signaling events of the functionally active 84-104 myelin basic protein (MBP(84-104)) fragment released after nerve injury, we demonstrate that exposing the sciatic nerve to MBP(84-104) via endoneurial injection produces robust mechanical hypersensitivity in female, but not in male, mice. RNA-seq and systems biology analysis revealed a striking sexual dimorphism in molecular signatures of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and spinal cord response, not observed at the nerve injection site. Mechanistically, intra-sciatic MBP(84-104) induced phospholipase C (PLC)-driven (females) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase-driven (males) phospholipid metabolism (tier 1). PLC/inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) and estrogen receptor co-regulation in spinal cord yielded Ca2+-dependent nociceptive signaling induction in females that was suppressed in males (tier 2). IP3R inactivation by intrathecal xestospongin C attenuated the female-specific hypersensitivity induced by MBP(84-104). According to sustained sensitization in tiers 1 and 2, T cell–related signaling spreads to the DRG and spinal cord in females, but remains localized to the sciatic nerve in males (tier 3). These results are consistent with our previous finding that MBP(84-104)–induced pain is T cell–dependent. In summary, an autoantigenic peptide endogenously released in nerve injury triggers multisite, sex-specific transcriptome changes, leading to neuropathic pain only in female mice.

https://openalex.org/W3034883395,"Abstract The histone chaperone FACT is upregulated during mammary tumorigenesis and necessary for the viability and growth of breast tumor cells. We established that only proliferating tumor cells are sensitive to FACT knockdown, suggesting that FACT functions during DNA replication in tumor cells but not in normal cells. We hypothesized that the basal level of replication stress defines the FACT dependence of cells. Using genetic and chemical tools, we demonstrated that FACT is needed to overcome replication stress. In the absence of FACT during replication stress, the MCM2-7 helicase dissociates from chromatin, resulting in the absence of ssDNA accumulation, RPA binding, and activation of the ATR/CHK1 checkpoint response. Without this response, stalled replication forks are not stabilized, and new origin firing cannot be prevented, leading to the accumulation of DNA damage and cell death. Thus, we propose a novel role for FACT as a factor preventing helicase dissociation from chromatin during replication stress."
https://openalex.org/W3035048302,"Control of gene expression in kinetoplastids such as trypanosomes depends heavily on RNA-binding proteins that influence mRNA decay and translation. We previously showed that the trypanosome protein MKT1 forms a multicomponent protein complex: MKT1 interacts with PBP1, which in turn recruits LSM12 and poly(A)-binding protein. MKT1 is recruited to mRNAs by sequence-specific RNA-binding proteins, resulting in stabilization of the bound mRNA. We here show that PBP1, LSM12, and a 117-residue protein, XAC1 (Tb927.7.2780), are present in complexes that contain either MKT1 or an MKT1-like protein, MKT1L (Tb927.10.1490). All five proteins are present predominantly in the complexes, and we found evidence for a minor subset of complexes containing both MKT1 and MKT1L. XAC1-containing complexes reproducibly contained RNA-binding proteins that were previously found associated with MKT1. Moreover, XAC1- or MKT1-containing complexes specifically recruited one of the two poly(A)-binding proteins, PABP2, and one of the six cap-binding translation initiation complexes, EIF4E6–EIF4G5. Yeast two-hybrid assay results indicated that MKT1 directly interacts with EIF4G5. MKT1–PBP1 complexes can therefore interact with mRNAs via their poly(A) tails and caps, as well as through sequence-specific RNA-binding proteins. Correspondingly, MKT1 is associated with many mRNAs, although not with those encoding ribosomal proteins. Meanwhile, MKT1L resembles MKT1 at the C terminus but additionally features an N-terminal extension with low-complexity regions. Although MKT1L depletion inhibited cell proliferation, we found no evidence that it specifically interacts with RNA-binding proteins or mRNA. We speculate that MKT1L may compete with MKT1 for PBP1 binding and thereby modulate the function of MKT1-containing complexes.

Transcription initiation is a crucial point of gene expression regulation in most eukaryotes. However, in kinetoplastid protists, such as trypanosomes and leishmanias, transcription by RNA polymerase II is polycistronic (1Wedel C. Förstner K. Derr R. Siegel N. GT-rich promoters can drive RNA pol II transcription and deposition of H2A.Z in African trypanosomes.EMBO J. 2017; 36 (28701485): 2581-259410.15252/embj.201695323Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and mRNA precursors are co-transcriptionally processed to mature mRNAs by trans-splicing and polyadenylation (2Michaeli S. Trans-splicing in trypanosomes: machinery and its impact on the parasite transcriptome.Future Microbiol. 2011; 6 (21526946): 459-47410.2217/fmb.11.20Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To overcome the limitations imposed by such a system, the most abundant mRNAs are usually encoded by multicopy genes but may exceptionally be transcribed by RNA polymerase I, as exemplified by trypanosome major surface proteins (3Günzl A. Bruderer T. Laufer G. Schimanski B. Tu L.C. Chung H.M. Lee P.T. Lee M.G.

Translation and decay of mRNAs are also at least partially linked: optimal codon usage correlates positively with mRNA stability, enabling the correct steady-state levels of mRNAs and proteins from constitutively expressed genes to be maintained (4Jeacock L. Faria J. Horn D. Codon usage bias controls mRNA and protein abundance in trypanosomatids.eLife. 2018; 7 (29543155): e3249610.7554/eLife.32496Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 5de Freitas Nascimento J.

However, many genes also require more flexible controls, allowing expression to be modified during differentiation and in response to environmental stimuli. For example, the African trypanosome Trypanosoma brucei alternates between two hosts during its life cycle, living in the blood and tissue fluids of mammals and the digestive system of tsetse flies. Adaptation to various niches within the two hosts is accompanied by changes in levels and translation of several hundred mRNAs (6Siegel T. Hekstra D. Wang X. Dewell S. Cross G.

However, the only ones for which the molecular mechanism is well-understood are the zinc finger proteins ZC3H11 and ZC3H20.

To assess the effects of proteins on bound RNAs in T. brucei, we use a tethering assay (34Coller J. Wickens M. Tethered function assays using 3′ untranslated regions.Methods. 2002; 26 (12054890): 142-15010.1016/S1046-2023(02)00016-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The purpose of this assay is to find out whether any particular protein can affect mRNA behavior when it is bound to that mRNA in vivo, even when an investigator does not know which mRNAs (if any) the protein normally binds to. For this purpose, the protein of interest is tagged with a highly specific RNA-binding domain, such as the N peptide from bacteriophage λ, and co-expressed with a reporter mRNA that includes the cognate binding sequences (for the λN peptide, a sequence called “boxB”). This reliably results in binding or “tethering” of the experimental protein fusion to the reporter mRNA. Effects on reporter expression can then be measured and interpreted with some caveats. First, the activity may be spurious if the protein that is tested normally never binds to mRNAs. Second, for a genuine RNA-binding protein, the activity may be affected by the tag or might be different when the protein interacts with mRNA via its own RNA-binding domain rather than via the artificial tether. For our tethering assays, we use a trypanosome line that constitutively expresses a reporter mRNA bearing five copies of the boxB sequence in the 3′-UTR, and λN-tagged proteins are expressed from a tetracycline-inducible promoter. Expression of λN-PABP, λN-PBP1, λN-LSM12, λN-MKT1, or λN-ZC3H11 all caused increases in reporter expression (18Singh A. Minia I. Droll D. Fadda A. Clayton C. Erben E.

Attachment of PABPs to mRNA 3′-UTRs increases mRNA levels (35Coller J. Gray N.

Pulldown followed by MS, as well as yeast two-hybrid analyses, showed that T. brucei MKT1 interacts with numerous RNA-binding proteins, often (though not always) via the motif (Y/W/V/I)(R/T/Q)H(N/D)PY (18Singh A.

Such RNA-binding proteins can therefore stabilize their target mRNAs and/or promote their translation by recruiting the MKT1–PBP1–LSM12–PABP complex (16Liu B. Marucha K. Clayton C.

We adapted the tethering assay to conduct a genome-wide screen for proteins that could influence mRNA fate (38Erben E. Fadda A. Lueong S. Hoheisel J. Clayton C. Genome-wide discovery of post-transcriptional regulators in Trypanosoma brucei.PLoS Pathog. 2014; 10 (24945722): e100417810.1371/journal.ppat.1004178Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The protein encoded by Tb927.7.2780, eXpression ACtivator 1 (XAC1), was one of the strongest activators of gene expression in this screen (38Erben E. Fadda A. Lueong S. Hoheisel J. Clayton C. Genome-wide discovery of post-transcriptional regulators in Trypanosoma brucei.PLoS Pathog. 2014; 10 (24945722): e100417810.1371/journal.ppat.1004178Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 39Lueong S.

Microbiol. 2016; 100 (26784394): 457-47110.1111/mmi.13328Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this paper, we show that XAC1 is present in two alternative complexes, containing PBP1, LSM12, and either MKT1 or an MKT1-like protein, MKT1L (Tb927.10.1490). We also find that both MKT1 and MKT1L are present mostly in complexes and that MKT1, but not MKT1L, is associated with many mRNAs and with a specific eIF4F-like translation initiation complex. T. brucei XAC1 is 117 residues long and has no annotated functional domains (Fig. 1A). Syntenic homologues are present in all kinetoplastid parasite genomes examined, but not in the free-living Bodo saltans or evolutionarily more distant organisms. A 17-residue region is conserved in all sequences examined (Fig. 1B and black box in Fig. 1A). The sequences from Trypanosoma species have two regions rich in proline, alanine, glutamine, and serine further toward the N terminus (marked in red in Fig. 1). The results of a high-throughput RNAi screen suggested that XAC1 is essential for trypanosome growth (40Alsford S. Turner D. Obado S. Sanchez-Flores A. Glover L. Berriman M. Hertz-Fowler C. Horn D. High throughput phenotyping using parallel sequencing of RNA interference targets in the African trypanosome.Genome Res. 2011; 21 (21363968): 915-92410.1101/gr.115089.110Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). To be able to monitor XAC1 protein levels, we integrated a sequence encoding a V5 tag immediately upstream of, and in frame with, an XAC1 ORF. Stem-loop RNAi induction (Table S1) resulted in a 75% reduction of V5-XAC1 protein within 16 h (Fig. 1C). At this point, protein synthesis was still normal (Fig. S1A), but no subsequent growth was seen (Fig. 1D). To investigate XAC1 interactions, we first made bloodstream-form trypanosomes in which one XAC1 gene included a C-terminal tag for tandem affinity purification (41Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Séraphin B. The tandem affinity purification (TAP) method: a general procedure of protein complex purification.Methods. 2001; 24 (11403571): 218-22910.1006/meth.2001.1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar) (XAC1-TAP), and the other XAC1 gene had been deleted (Table S1). Results from three tandem affinity purifications of XAC1-TAP are shown in Fig. 2A and Table S2. Results for GFP-TAP served as negative controls; some of these have been published previously (42Klein C. Terrao M. Clayton C. The role of the zinc finger protein ZC3H32 in bloodstream-form Trypanosoma brucei.PLoS ONE. 2017; 12 (28545140): e017790110.1371/journal.pone.0177901Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 43Mugo E.

The most strongly enriched proteins were MKT1, LSM12, PBP1, PABP2, and a protein related to MKT1, which we named MKT1L (Tb927.10.1490). Immunoprecipitation of YFP-tagged XAC1 via Myc-tagged LSM12 was confirmed and RNase-insensitive (Fig. S2A). Previously, we had identified proteins associated with MKT1 in bloodstream forms after a single purification of C-terminally TAP-tagged MKT1, followed by nonquantitative MS. We had also found MKT1 interaction partners in a yeast two-hybrid screen (18Singh A. Minia I. Droll D. Fadda A. Clayton C. Erben E. Trypanosome MKT1 and the RNA-binding protein ZC3H11: interactions and potential roles in post-transcriptional regulatory networks.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 (24470144): 4652-466810.1093/nar/gkt1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition to PBP1, LSM12, MKT1L, and MKT1, 24 proteins were significantly enriched with XAC1-TAP. Of these, 10 had previously been identified as direct or indirect partners of MKT1 (18Singh A. Minia I. Droll D. Fadda A. Clayton C. Erben E. Trypanosome MKT1 and the RNA-binding protein ZC3H11: interactions and potential roles in post-transcriptional regulatory networks.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 (24470144): 4652-466810.1093/nar/gkt1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (Table 1). Most of the additional XAC1-associated proteins can also directly bind to mRNA, as judged by their presence in the mRNP proteome (39Lueong S. Merce C. Fischer B. Hoheisel J. Erben E. Gene expression regulatory networks in Trypanosoma brucei: insights into the role of the mRNA-binding proteome.Mol.

Seven of the associated proteins have canonical RNA-binding domains, and nine of the additional associated proteins were shown to activate expression when tethered (38Erben E. Fadda A. Lueong S.

MKT1L is, however, distinguished from MKT1 by an extended N terminus; at the beginning, there are 35 residues consisting almost exclusively of glutamine and histidine, which are predicted to be disordered by mobibd_LITE. Similar low-complexity regions are found in the Trypanosoma cruzi and Trypanosoma congolense homologues, and the region is expanded to 130 residues in Trypanosoma vivax (Fig. S3). In our previous studies of MKT1 interactions, we had used MKT1 with a C-terminal TAP tag. To confirm the interaction of MKT1L with XAC1, we therefore similarly inducibly expressed MKT1L-TAP and purified associated proteins. To our surprise, the only proteins that co-purified were known components of the MKT1 complex: LSM12 and XAC1 were significantly present, and PBP1 was enriched but below the significance cut-off (Fig. 2B and Table S2). No RNA-binding proteins were associated. These results, combined with previous data, suggest that the many additional proteins that were found to be associated with XAC1 were probably attached via MKT1, not MKT1L. We next examined the proteins associated with MKT1 and MKT1L in procyclic forms. To avoid any possible effects of the large C-terminal tag or of inducible (over)expression, we used cell lines in which one of the relevant genes contained a sequence encoding a V5 tag at the 5′-end of the ORF (in situ V5 tag).

https://openalex.org/W3035074449,"Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is a key enzyme involved in energy metabolism. Recently, GAPDH has been suggested to have extraglycolytic functions in DNA repair, but the underlying mechanism for the GAPDH response to DNA damage remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the tyrosine kinase Src is activated under DNA damage stress and phosphorylates GAPDH at Tyr41. This phosphorylation of GAPDH is essential for its nuclear translocation and DNA repair function. Blocking the nuclear import of GAPDH by suppressing Src signaling or through a GAPDH Tyr41 mutation impairs its response to DNA damage. Nuclear GAPDH is recruited to DNA lesions and associates with DNA polymerase β (Pol β) to function in DNA repair. Nuclear GAPDH promotes Pol β polymerase activity and increases base excision repair (BER) efficiency. Furthermore, GAPDH knockdown dramatically decreases BER efficiency and sensitizes cells to DNA damaging agents. Importantly, the knockdown of GAPDH in colon cancer SW480 cells and xenograft models effectively enhances their sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic drug 5-FU. In summary, our findings provide mechanistic insight into the new function of GAPDH in DNA repair and suggest a potential therapeutic target in chemotherapy."

DnaB helicase is loaded onto unwound oriC via interactions with the DnaC loader and the DnaA complex. The DnaB–DnaC complex is recruited to the DnaA complex via stable binding of DnaB to DnaA domain I. The DnaB–DnaC complex is then directed to unwound oriC via a weak interaction between DnaB and DnaA domain III. Previously, we showed that Phe46 in DnaA domain I binds to DnaB. Here, we searched for the DnaA domain I–binding site in DnaB. The DnaB L160A variant was impaired in binding to DnaA complex on oriC but retained its DnaC-binding and helicase activities. DnaC binding moderately stimulated DnaA binding of DnaB L160A, and loading of DnaB L160A onto oriC was consistently and moderately inhibited. In a helicase assay with partly single-stranded DNA bearing a DnaA-binding site, DnaA stimulated DnaB loading, which was strongly inhibited in DnaB L160A even in the presence of DnaC.

https://openalex.org/W3034732115,"Adaptive angiogenesis is necessary for tissue repair, however, it may also be associated with the exacerbation of injury and development of chronic disease. In these studies, we demonstrate that lung mesenchymal vascular progenitor cells (MVPC) modulate adaptive angiogenesis via lineage trace, depletion of MVPC, and modulation of β-catenin expression. Single cell sequencing confirmed MVPC as multipotential vascular progenitors, thus, genetic depletion resulted in alveolar simplification with reduced adaptive angiogenesis. Following vascular endothelial injury, Wnt activation in MVPC was sufficient to elicit an emphysema-like phenotype characterized by increased MLI, fibrosis, and MVPC driven adaptive angiogenesis. Lastly, activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling skewed the profile of human and murine MVPC toward an adaptive phenotype. These data suggest that lung MVPC drive angiogenesis in response to injury and regulate the microvascular niche as well as subsequent distal lung tissue architecture via Wnt signaling."
https://openalex.org/W3035083068,"The single von Willebrand factor C-domain proteins (SVWCs) are mainly found in arthropods. Their expression may be regulated by several environmental stresses, including nutritional status and bacterial and viral infections. However, the underlying regulatory mechanism is unclear. In the present study, we identified a member of the SVWC family from the river prawn Macrobrachium nipponense as a soluble and bacteria-inducible pattern-recognition receptor (designated MnSVWC). In vitro, recombinant MnSVWC exhibited pronounced binding and Ca2+-dependent agglutinating abilities against diverse microbes, including Gram-negative bacteria (i.e. Escherichia coli and Aeromonas victoria), Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis), and yeast (Pichia pastoris). ELISA assays revealed that recombinant MnSVWC recognizes a broad range of various pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and has high affinity to lipopolysaccharide and lysine-type and diaminopimelic acid-type peptidylglycan and d-galactose and low affinity to d-mannan and β-1,3-glucan. Mutant MnSVWCP57A with an impaired Glu-Pro-Asn (EPN) motif displayed reduced affinity to all these PAMPs to varying extent. Moreover, MnSVWC bound to the surface of hemocytes and promoted their phagocytic activity and clearance of invasive bacteria. RNAi-mediated MnSVWC knockdown in prawn reduced the ability to clear invading bacteria, but did not block the activities of the Toll pathway or the arthropod immune deficiency (IMD) pathway, or the expression of antimicrobial peptide genes. These results indicate that MnSVWC functions as an extracellular pattern-recognition receptor in M. nipponense that mediates cellular immune responses by recognizing PAMPs, agglutinating invasive microbes, and promoting phagocytosis in hemocytes."
https://openalex.org/W3034413079,"Coat proteins have a central role in vesicular transport by binding to cargoes for their sorting into intracellular pathways. Cargo recognition is mediated by components of the coat complex known as adaptor proteins1–3. We previously showed that Arf-GAP with coil-coil, ANK repeat and PH domain-containing protein 1 (ACAP1) functions as an adaptor for a clathrin coat complex that has a function in endocytic recycling4–6. Here, we show that the protein kinase Akt acts as a co-adaptor in this complex, and is needed in conjunction with ACAP1 to bind to cargo proteins to promote their recycling. In addition to advancing the understanding of endocytic recycling, we uncover a fundamentally different function in which a kinase acts, as Akt in this case is an effector rather than a regulator in a cellular event. Hsu et al. find that the protein kinase Akt acts as a co-adaptor in the clathrin coat complex and is needed in conjunction with ACAP1 to bind to cargo proteins to promote their recycling."

Protein microsequencing established 3α5α-P inhibitable photolabeling of amino acids near the cytoplasmic end of the β subunit M4 (β3Pro-415, β3Leu-417, and β3Thr-418) and M3 (β3Arg-309) helices located at the base of a pocket in the β+–α− subunit interface that extends to the level of αGln-242, a steroid sensitivity determinant in the αM1 helix. Competition photolabeling established that this site binds with high affinity a structurally diverse group of 3α-OH steroids that act as anesthetics, anti-epileptics, and anti-depressants.

Similarly, for GABAAR PAMs with the C-20 carbonyl of 3α5α-P or pregnanolone reduced to a hydroxyl, binding affinity is reduced by 1,000-fold, whereas binding is retained after deoxygenation at the C-20 position.

Photolabeling of the β3 subunit was inhibited by 30 μm 3α5α-P, but not by PS, etomidate, or R-mTFD-MPAB. To quantify the concentration dependence of inhibition of photolabeling by nonradioactive drugs, receptor aliquots were photolabeled with [3H]21-pTFDBzox-AP in the presence of a range of drug concentrations, with receptor subunits excised from the stained gel after SDS-PAGE and 3H incorporation into the β subunit determined by liquid scintillation counting. In a representative experiment (Fig. 3B), nonradioactive 21-pTFDBzox-AP maximally inhibited [3H]21-pTFDBzox-AP photolabeling of α1β3 and α1β3γ2 GABAARs to the same extent as 30 μm 3α5α-P, with IC50 values of 0.7 and 0.9 μm, respectively. As described under “Experimental procedures,” IC50 values for drugs were determined by combining results from at least four independent experiments using two or more GABAAR purifications, with data from individual experiments combined after normalization to the total specific (i.e. 3α5α-P inhibitable) binding in the absence of competitor.

After SDS-PAGE, covalent incorporation of 3H in the β subunit was determined by liquid scintillation counting. For each independent experiment, nonspecific photolabeling (Bns) was determined in the presence of 30 μm 3α5α-P, and specific binding was normalized to the 3H cpm incorporated specifically in the control condition (B0 − Bns). The plotted data are the averages (± S.D.) from the independent experiments. As described under “Experimental procedures,” the pooled data from the independent experiments were fit to Equation 2. Drug structures, parameters for the fits, and the number of independent experiments are tabulated in Table 1. The curves are plotted for fits to nH =1, which were favored by F-test comparison over fits with variable nH, with the exception of betaxalone (α1β3, nH = 0.5 ± 0.1).

Here, we provide evidence for an essential role of TLR3 in liver regeneration after an acute loss of tissue due to partial hepatectomy. Mice lacking TLR3 had a severe and sustained defect in the restoration of liver tissue with reduced liver-to-body weight ratios even after an extended recovery period of 2 weeks. Hepatocyte cell cycle progression into S phase was impaired in TLR3-deficient mice. Mechanistic analyses revealed that TLR3-deficient mice had markedly reduced systemic levels of active HGF, but had increased amounts of inactive tissue-bound HGF. Importantly, expression of uPA, which orchestrates the processing and release of HGF from the hepatic extracellular matrix, was reduced in regenerating livers of TLR3-deficient mice. In addition, expression of the HGF maturation factor HGFAC was transiently diminished in TLR3-deficient mice. In vitro, engagement of TLR3 directly stimulated expression of uPA by hepatic stellate cells. Thus, TLR3 supports liver regeneration through upregulation of uPA, which promotes the release of preformed HGF from extracellular matrix stores."

In search of molecules that interact with this domain, we performed affinity chromatography with the recombinant intracellular L1 domain and a nuclear extract from mouse brains, and identified potential nuclear L1 binding partners involved in transcriptional regulation, RNA processing and transport, DNA repair, chromatin remodeling, and nucleocytoplasmic transport. By co-immunoprecipitation and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using recombinant proteins, we verified the direct interaction between L1 and the nuclear binding partners non-POU domain containing octamer-binding protein and splicing factor proline/glutamine-rich. The proximity ligation assay confirmed this close interaction in cultures of cerebellar granule cells. Our findings suggest that L1 fragments regulate multiple nuclear functions in the nervous system. We discuss possible physiological and pathological roles of these interactions in regulation of chromatin structure, gene expression, RNA processing, and DNA repair."

In this study, we report that the expression of MED16 is markedly decreased in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) tumors compared with normal thyroid tissues. In vitro, MED16 overexpression in PTC cells significantly inhibited cell migration, enhanced sodium/iodide symporter expression and iodine uptake, and decreased resistance to radioactive 131I (RAI). Conversely, PTC cells in which MED16 had been further knocked down (MED16KD) exhibited enhanced cell migration, epithelial–mesenchymal transition, and RAI resistance, accompanied by decreased sodium/iodide symporter levels. Moreover, cell signaling through transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) was highly activated after the MED16 knockdown. Similar results were obtained in MED12KD PTC cells, and a co-immunoprecipitation experiment verified interactions between MED16 and MED12 and between MED16 and TGF-βR2. Of note, the application of LY2157299, a potent inhibitor of TGF-β signaling, significantly attenuated MED16KD-induced RAI resistance both in vitro and in vivo.

Interestingly, TGF-β signaling seems to have a double-edged effect on tumor progression. Activation of the TGF-β pathway can slow down cell proliferation, arrest the cell cycle (7Grubeck-Loebenstein B. Buchan G. Sadeghi R. Kissonerghis M. Londei M. Turner M. Pirich K. Roka R. Niederle B.

Other studies have demonstrated that the activation of the TGF-β pathway can promote EMT during tumorigenesis and hence lead to local invasion and distant metastasis (10Lamouille S. Connolly E.

Over recent decades, the regulatory effect of TGF-β signaling on NIS expression has drawn attention because of its critical participation in iodine uptake, which potentially affects RAI treatment efficacy in patients with thyroid cancer. In PTC, accumulating studies have shown that TGF-β signaling is significantly activated in the invasive region of the tumor and negatively regulates NIS expression, which closely correlates with radiotherapy sensitivity in PTC (11Riesco-Eizaguirre G.

Thus, the activation of TGF-β may result in the decreased iodine uptake ability of tumor cells and finally lead to the therapeutic tolerance of radioactive iodine. MED16 is a subunit of the mediator complex, a multimeric protein complex serving as a bridge in conveying information from specific transcription factors to RNA polymerase II. Growing evidence has indicated that mediator complex subunits exhibit cancer-specific transcription profiles, suggesting the implication of different subunits in carcinogenesis and development (13Syring I.

To date, studies of MED1, MED12, MED28, CDK8, and cyclins have been well-established, and related disease subtypes display either mutated or changed expression of these molecules (14Schiano C. Casamassimi A. Rienzo M. de Nigris F. Sommese L. Napoli C. Involvement of mediator complex in malignancy.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1845 (24342527): 66-8310.1016/j.bbcan.2013.12.001PubMed Google Scholar). A published study showed that in colon and lung cancer cells, cytoplasmic MED12 negatively regulates TGF-βR2 by physical interaction and therefore suppresses TGF-β signal transduction, whereas TGF-β is highly activated after MED12 loss, leading to an EMT-like phenotype and drug resistance (15Huang S. Hölzel M. Knijnenburg T. Schlicker A. Roepman P. McDermott U. Garnett M. Grernrum W. Sun C. Prahallad A. Groenendijk F.H. Mittempergher L. Nijkamp W. Neefjes J. Salazar R. et al.MED12 controls the response to multiple cancer drugs through regulation of TGF-β receptor signaling.Cell. 2012; 151 (23178117): 937-95010.1016/j.cell.2012.10.035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The expression pattern of MED16, an important subunit of this mediator family, is rarely reported in PTC, so its expression pattern and regulatory role need to be elucidated. In our study, we found that the expression of MED16 was significantly reduced in tumors compared with adjacent normal tissue, indicating a potential anti-oncogenetic property of MED16 in PTC carcinogenesis. In papillary thyroid cancer cells, MED16 overexpression significantly inhibited cell migration, enhanced NIS expression and iodine uptake, and facilitated PTC radioactive iodine treatment. However, shRNA-mediated MED16 depletion significantly facilitated cell migration, reduced NIS expression and 131I uptake, and promoted radioactive iodine treatment failure. All of these effects are mediated by activation of TGF-β signaling, and the blockade of this pathway using a specific TGF-β inhibitor successfully rescued radioiodine resistance both in vivo and in vitro. Not surprisingly, similar results were observed in MED12-knockdown PTC cells, and the co-IP data implied physical interactions between MED16/MED12 and MED16/TGF-βR2, suggesting that MED16 and MED12 cooperate to act as suppressors of TGF-β pathway activation by binding to TGF-βR2. Taken together, this study suggests that MED16KD-mediated TGF-β activation contributes to malignant cell transformation and radioiodine resistance in PTC, enhancing the development of new combination therapies for PTC patients with RAI resistance. We evaluated MED16 expression profiles and clinical relevance in thyroid cancer using the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and the THCA data sets. Of significance, MED16 was underexpressed in PTC samples compared with normal tissues (Fig. 1A). Genetic drivers have distinct signaling consequences; thus, PTC samples were categorized into Braf-like and Ras-like subtypes based on unique gene signatures (16Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network Integrated genomic characterization of papillary thyroid carcinoma.Cell. 2014; 159 (25417114): 676-69010.1016/j.cell.2014.09.050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, MED16 expression did not differ between Braf-like and Ras-like PTCs across the THCA series. However, there was an increase in MED16 expression in Braf-mutant PTC versus non-Braf mutant tumors (Fig. 1C). In addition, the frequency of Braf alterations was lower in PTC with low MED16 expression compared with PTC with high MED16 expression (Fig. 1D). To determine whether these results were clinically pertinent, we examined the expression level of MED16 in 12 paired PTC clinical samples using qPCR. A negative correlation was found between the MED16 expression level and the degree of tissue malignancy (Fig. 1E). These results suggested that MED16 might play an anti-oncogenetic role in the development of thyroid tumors. To investigate the functional role of MED16 in PTC, we constructed stable MED16 overexpression and knockdown PTC cell lines by infecting cells with lentivirus harboring the MED16 CDS region or shMED16 and validated the results at the mRNA and protein levels. The qRT-PCR results showed that the knockdown efficiency of shRNA1 and shRNA2 reached ∼80 and 60% in both PTC cell lines, respectively, and the overexpression vector led to a 136-fold increase in MED16 expression compared with that of the control vector in B-CPAP cells; MED16 expression increased 49-fold in TPC-1 cells (Fig. 2, C and D). Similarly, the protein level of MED16 was validated by Western blotting (Fig. 2, A and B). In subsequent experiments, shRNA1 was chosen because of its high knockdown efficiency. To study the role of MED16 in PTC cell migration, wound-healing analysis was conducted, showing that MED16KD significantly increased the migration rates of TPC-1 and B-CPAP cells and that MED16OE inhibited the migration of PTC cells. (Fig. 2, E–H). Consistently, Transwell assays confirmed that MED16 suppressed the migration ability of PTC cells (Fig. S1). For cell morphology, the spindle length of MED16KD B-CPAP cells was found to be significantly longer than that of pLKO.1 vector-infected cells, and MED16OE cells were significantly more closely connected and grew in a colony-like manner (Fig. 3A), but no significant morphological changes were observed in TPC-1 cells (data not shown). Considering the change in motor ability, we proposed that MED16 could be involved in EMT in PTC cells. To validate this hypothesis, we used Western blotting and qPCR to detect both epithelial markers (E-cadherin) and mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin and vimentin). As shown in Fig. 3 (D and E), the suppression of MED16 occurred in parallel with the down-regulation of E-cadherin and the up-regulation of vimentin in both PTC cell lines. The overexpression of MED16 showed the opposite effect, and similar results were found by qPCR (Fig. 3, B and C). The mRNA levels of EMT-related transcription factors (Snail, Slug, and Twist) (Fig. S2) and MMP families (MMP1, MMP2, MMP9, and MMP13) were also assessed in MED16KD cells and vector cells (Fig. 3, F and G), implying that the suppression of MED16 resulted in elevated transcriptional activity of these migration-related genes. These data indicate that MED16 knockdown promoted cell motility and facilitated EMT in PTC cells.Figure 3Knockdown of MED16 promotes EMT changes in human PTC cells. A, cell morphology changed in MED16KD and MED16OE B-CPAP. The spindle length of MED16KD cells was significantly longer than that of pLKO.1 cells; MED16OE cells grew in a colony-like manner.

The cell viability of the MED16KD groups was significantly higher than that of the control cells, indicating a higher tolerance to 131I, and the MED16OE groups were more sensitive to 131I (Fig. 4B). Subsequently, the I− uptake ability was measured in both TPC-1 and B-CPAP cells. Compared with the control group, the iodine uptake capacity decreased to 73 and 74.5% in MED16KD TPC-1 cells and decreased to 76.6 and 81.5% in MED16KD B-CPAP cells, and the iodine uptake capacity increased in MED16OE PTC cells (Fig. 4C). To determine the possible cause of 131I resistance, NIS expression in control and MED16KD cells was detected by Western blotting. Significant reductions in NIS at the protein level were observed after MED16 knockdown in both PTC cell lines (Fig. 4, D and E). To test this further, TPC-1 and B-CPAP cell lines were transfected with a pNIS-Luc reporter plasmid containing the −2926/−1 core promoter and the −9298/−9244 NIS upstream enhancer. NIS promoter activity was induced in both MED16-overexpressing PTC cell lines. These data implied that MED16 loss decreased radioiodine sensitivity by reducing the I− uptake capacity, which was mediated by NIS suppression in PTC cells. To unravel the mechanism underlying MED16KD-mediated EMT and 131I resistance, the activation of the TGF-β pathway was investigated. In both B-CPAP and TPC-1 cells, MED16 knockdown significantly increased the phosphorylation level of Smad2 and Erk1/2, as well as the expression of TGF-βR2, whereas MED16 overexpression inhibited TGF-β pathway activity (Fig. 5, A–D). Furthermore, marked elevation of TGF-β target genes (ANGPTL4, TAGLN, CRY6,1 and CTGF) was detected by qPCR in both MED16KD PTC cell lines (Fig. 5E), and a predominant translocation of Smad2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus was observed in MED16KD cells; however, the expression of Smad2 in the nucleus was decreased in both MED16OE cell lines compared with control cell lines (Fig. 5, F and G). The mRNA levels of ALK5 and TGF-β family signals (e.g. activin and BMPs) were assessed; however, we did not detect the up-regulation of ALK5 activin and BMPs except the TGF-β target genes (Fig. 5E). We speculated that the activation of the TGF-β pathway was due to the increased ligand reactivity caused by the up-regulation of TGF-βR2. To test this hypothesis, SMAD activity was studied by a luciferase reporter system in MED16 knockdown cells transfected with the pGMSMAD-Lu plasmid, and SMAD activity was significantly increased in MED16KD cells compared with the control cells (Fig. S2). These data indicated potent TGF-β activation induced in PTC cells with MED16KD. MED12 is another subtype of the mediator complex that was reported to inhibit the TGF-β pathway by binding to TGF-βR2 in the cytoplasm of various tumor cells (15Huang S. Hölzel M. Knijnenburg T. Schlicker A. Roepman P. McDermott U. Garnett M. Grernrum W. Sun C. Prahallad A. Groenendijk F.H. Mittempergher L. Nijkamp W. Neefjes J. Salazar R. et al.MED12 controls the response to multiple cancer drugs through regulation of TGF-β receptor signaling.Cell. 2012; 151 (23178117): 937-95010.1016/j.cell.2012.10.035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). To clarify the role of MED12 in thyroid cancer, stable B-CPAP and TPC-1 strains with MED12 knockdown were constructed as well. The knockdown efficiency of shRNA1 and shRNA2 reached 86 and 22%, respectively (data not shown). The Transwell experiment showed that MED12KD reproduced the phenotypes induced by MED16KD and that the cell migration ability was significantly enhanced (Fig. S3). MED12 depletion also led to RAI therapy resistance, which was positively correlated with knockdown efficacy (Fig. 6A). In addition, we discovered that the protein levels of p-Smad2, p-Erk1/2, and TGF-βR2 in MED12KD cells were remarkably increased, indicating high activation of TGF-β signaling after MED12 knockdown (Fig. 6B). To further explore the relationship between MED12 and MED16, we analyzed the tolerance of MED12 and MED16 double-knockdown cells to radioactive iodine. However, compared with MED12KD or MED16KD cells, cell viability was improved in cells with knockdown of both MED16 and MED12, and the expression of NIS was also decreased (Fig. 6, C–E). Therefore, we believe that there is a synergistic effect between MED16 and MED12. To investigate the mechanism underlying MED16-mediated TGF-β activation, the subcellular localization of MED16 was first assessed by immunofluorescence. As shown in Fig. 6H, MED16 was abundantly expressed in the cytoplasm. In addition, the co-IP experiment showed that MED16 coprecipitated with MED12 and TGF-βR2 in PTC cells (Fig. 6F), which suggested that MED16 might physically interact with MED12 and therefore synergistically inhibit the activation of TGF-β by binding to its receptor TGF-βR2. However, MED12 and TGF-βR2 interact in the cytoplasm, so to further clarify the interrelationship between MED12/MED16/TGF-βR2, pLKO.1 and MED12KD TPC-1 cell cytoplasmic fractions were used for co-IP experiments. The results showed that the level of TGF-βR2 was significantly increased in MED12KD cells, but MED12 knockdown did not affect the interaction of MED16 with TGF-βR2 (Fig. 6G). Therefore, MED16 may mediate the interaction of MED12 and TGF-βR2 to play a key role in the regulation of the TGF-β pathway. Considering the critical involvement of the TGF-β pathway in the drug resistance of many tumors, we proposed that the 131I resistance induced by MED16 and MED12 knockdown was also mediated by TGF-β signaling. To verify our hypothesis, LY2157299, a specific inhibitor of TGF-β, was applied to block this pathway. As shown in Fig. 7A, the phosphorylation level of Smad2 in B-CPAP cells was reduced by LY2157299 (5–20 μm) in a dose-dependent manner after a 48-h incubation, and 5 μm was chosen as the optimal dosage with statistical significance in the following experiments. The control, MED16KD, and MED12KD PTC cells were treated with 131I in the presence or absence of LY2157299 at 5 μm. As shown in Fig. 7B, the dampened response to 131I treatment in MED16KD or MED12KD cells was dramatically rescued by LY2157299 in both B-CPAP and TPC-1 cells. To determine the reason that the TGF-β inhibitor attenuated radioiodine resistance, I− uptake in MED12KD and MED16KD cells was assessed. A significant increase in I− uptake was observed after incubation with LY2157299 in both PTC cell lines (Fig. 7C). To investigate MED16 function in vivo, we conducted a subcutaneous tumorigenesis experiment in nude mice, as shown in Fig. 8A, When compared with pLKO.1 tumors treated with 131I, the growth of MED16KD tumors with the same treatment was remarkably faster (Fig. 8B). Interestingly, no difference was detected in the size of pLKO.1 tumors and MED16KD tumors obtained from mice without any treatment, as shown in Fig. 8 (G and I). These results demonstrated that MED16 depletion facilitated radioiodine resistance instead of enhancing tumor growth in vivo. Most importantly, the tumor size of MED16KD tumor-bearing mice treated with both LY2157299 and 131I was dramatically decreased compared with the MED16KD tumor-bearing mice that received 131I alone, indicating that LY2157299 significantly improved the therapeutic effect of 131I in vivo, which is consistent with the results of the cell experiments. In addition, MED16KD tumors treated with LY2157299 + 131I also showed increased 131I sensitivity compared with that in pLKO.1 tumors treated with 131I therapy, indicating that in addition to activation of TGF-β signaling induced by MED16 knockdown, endogenous TGF-β signaling was also suppressed by LY2157299 in MED16KD tumors (Fig. 8, B–D). We evaluated the possible association between MED16 level and patient outcome with or without RAI therapy of THCA data sets. Overall, no significant difference in survival rate was detected between PTC patients with high and low tumoral MED16 expression among the entire cohort (n = 481) (p = 0.5409) (Fig. 8E). However, in the subgroup of PTC patients who received RAI therapy (n = 146), the disease-free survival rate was positively correlated with the expression level of tumoral MED16 in patients, although the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.0896) (Fig. 8F). Importantly, there were no significant differences in clinical staging attributes for RAI or non–RAI treatment groups stratified by MED16 tumoral expression (Tables S1 and S2). Similarly, the proposed mechanism underlying MED16KD-induced 131I resistance was validated in vivo by detecting the expression of several key proteins, including p-smad2/smad2, TGF-βR2, and NIS. The Western blotting data illustrated elevated TGF-βR2 and p-Smad2 levels, as well as decreased expression of NIS in MED16KD tumors compared with pLKO.1 tumors (Fig. 8, H and J). These data indicate that the activation of the TGF-β pathway induced by MED16 knockdown was critical for tumor survival even after 131I treatment, suggesting that combination therapy with RAI and TGF-β inhibitor might be a favorable approach for treating PTC patients with MED16 mutations. Thyroid cancer has been rated as the most frequent endocrine malignancy worldwide, and the number of newly diagnosed cases in China exceeded 190,000 in 2018 (17Ferlay J. Colombet M. Soerjomataram I. Mathers C. Parkin D.M. Piñeros M. Znaor A. Bray F. Estimating the global cancer incidence and mortality in 2018: GLOBOCAN sources and methods.Int. J. Cancer. 2019; 144 (30350310): 1941-195310.1002/ijc.31937Crossref PubMed Scopus (2456) Google Scholar). Papillary thyroid cancer is characterized as a major subtype of differentiated thyroid cancer with a relatively favorable prognosis after surgery and conventional radioactive iodine therapy, which is a mainstay of PTC treatment. However, some PTC patients unfortunately develop local recurrence and distant metastasis because their thyroid tumor cells no longer take up iodine and hence are resistant to RAI treatment. The outcome of patients with RAI-refractory PTC is poor, and the 5-year disease-free survival rate is only 60–70% (18Nixon I.J. Whitcher M.M. Palmer F.L. Tuttle R.M. Shaha A.R. Shah J.P. Patel S.G. Ganly I. The impact of distant metastases at presentation on prognosis in patients with differentiated carcinoma of the thyroid gland.Thyroid. 2012; 22 (22827579): 884-88910.1089/thy.2011.0535Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Given this, exploring the relevant factors influencing RAI therapy efficacy and resensitizing RAI-refractory tumors to 131I would tremendously improve the treatment and survival rate of PTC patients. In thyroid cells, iodine uptake and accumulation are predominantly facilitated by NIS, which is expressed at the highest level in the thyroid compared with other organs (19Dohán O. De la Vieja A. Paroder V. Riedel C. Artani M. Reed M. Ginter C.S. Carrasco N. The sodium/iodide symporter (NIS): characterization, regulation, and medical significance.Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24 (12588808): 48-7710.1210/er.2001-0029Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). PTC cells normally retain similar NIS expression and localization to follicular cells, allowing RAI to enter tumor cells to prevent local recurrence and distant metastasis. Therefore, impairment of NIS function is considered a hallmark of RAI resistance in a subset of PTC patients (20Liu J. Liu Y. Lin Y. Liang J. Radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer and redifferentiation therapy.Endocrinol. Metab. (Seoul). 2019; 34 (31565873): 215-22510.3803/EnM.2019.34.3.215Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this study, we discovered that MED16 was a positive regulator of NIS expression in both PTC cells and tumor tissues, explaining the decreased sensitivity to 131I treatment after MED16 knockdown. Likewise, we found that disease-free survival was positively correlated with MED16 levels in patients who received RAI treatment, also hinting at the relevance between MED16 expression and RAI resistance in the PTC group. Hence, MED16 might be identified as a fe"

https://openalex.org/W3035354493,"The Src homology 2 (SH2) domain has a highly conserved architecture that recognizes linear phosphotyrosine motifs and is present in a wide range of signaling pathways across different evolutionary taxa. A hallmark of SH2 domains is the arginine residue in the conserved FLVR motif that forms a direct salt bridge with bound phosphotyrosine. Here, we solve the X-ray crystal structures of the C-terminal SH2 domain of p120RasGAP (RASA1) in its apo and peptide-bound form. We find that the arginine residue in the FLVR motif does not directly contact pTyr1087 of a bound phosphopeptide derived from p190RhoGAP; rather, it makes an intramolecular salt bridge to an aspartic acid. Unexpectedly, coordination of phosphotyrosine is achieved by a modified binding pocket that appears early in evolution. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we find that substitution of the FLVR arginine R377A does not cause a significant loss of phosphopeptide binding, but rather a tandem substitution of R398A (SH2 position βD4) and K400A (SH2 position βD6) is required to disrupt the binding. These results indicate a hitherto unrecognized diversity in SH2 domain interactions with phosphotyrosine and classify the C-terminal SH2 domain of p120RasGAP as ""FLVR-unique."""
https://openalex.org/W3035536413,"Wnt/FZD signalling activity is required for spinal cord development, including the dorsal-ventral patterning of the neural tube, where it affects proliferation and specification of neurons. Wnt ligands initiate canonical, β -catenin-dependent, signaling by binding to Frizzled receptors. However, in many developmental contexts the cognate FZD receptor for a particular Wnt ligand remains to be identified. Here, we characterized FZD10 expression in the dorsal neural tube where it overlaps with both Wnt1 and Wnt3a, as well as markers of dorsal progenitors and interneurons. We show FZD10 expression is sensitive to Wnt1, but not Wnt3a expression, and FZD10 plays a role in neural tube patterning. Knockdown approaches show that Wnt1 induced ventral expansion of dorsal neural markes, Pax6 and Pax7, requires FZD10. In contrast, Wnt3a induced dorsalization of the neural tube is not affected by FZD10 knockdown. Gain of function experiments show that FZD10 is not sufficient on its own to mediate Wnt1 activity in vivo. Indeed excess FZD10 inhibits the dorsalizing activity of Wnt1. However, addition of the Lrp6 co-receptor dramatically enhances the Wnt1/FZD10 mediated activation of dorsal markers. This suggests that the mechanism by which Wnt1 regulates proliferation and patterning in the neural tube requires both FZD10 and Lrp6."
https://openalex.org/W2998510670,"The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is the most widely studied type of genetic variation. A haplotype is defined as the sequence of alleles at SNP sites on each haploid chromosome. Haplotype information is essential in unravelling the genome-phenotype association. Haplotype assembly is a well-known approach for reconstructing haplotypes, exploiting reads generated by DNA sequencing devices. The Minimum Error Correction (MEC) metric is often used for reconstruction of haplotypes from reads. However, problems with the MEC metric have been reported. Here, we investigate the MEC approach to demonstrate that it may result in incorrectly reconstructed haplotypes for devices that produce error-prone long reads. Specifically, we evaluate this approach for devices developed by Illumina, Pacific BioSciences and Oxford Nanopore Technologies. We show that imprecise haplotypes may be reconstructed with a lower MEC than that of the exact haplotype. The performance of MEC is explored for different coverage levels and error rates of data. Our simulation results reveal that in order to avoid incorrect MEC-based haplotypes, a coverage of 25 is needed for reads generated by Pacific BioSciences RS systems."

The highest numbers of Ki67+ hepatocytes in the liver of splenectomized rats were observed at 24 h after the surgery, simultaneously with the highest index of Ki67-positive hepatocytes. After surgical removal of the spleen, expression of certain genes in the liver tissues increased. A number of genes were upregulated in the liver at a single time point of 24 h, including Ccne1, Egf, Tnfa, Il6, Hgf, Met, Tgfb1r2 and Nos2. The expression of Ccnd1, Tgfb1, Tgfb1r1 and Il10 in the liver was upregulated over the course of 3 days after splenectomy. Monitoring of the liver macrophage populations in splenectomized animals revealed a statistically significant increase in the proportion of CD68-positive cells in the liver (as compared with sham-operated controls) detectable at 24 h and 48 h after the surgery. The difference in the liver content of CD68-positive cells between splenectomized and sham-operated animals evened out by day 3 after the surgery. No alterations in the liver content of CD163-positive cells were observed in the experiments. A decrease in the proportion of CD206-positive liver macrophages was observed at 48 h after splenectomy. The splenectomy-induced hepatocyte proliferation is described by us for the first time. Mechanistically, the effect is apparently induced by the removal of spleen as a major source of Tgfb1 (hepatocyte growth inhibitor) and subsequently supported by activation of proliferation factor-encoding genes in the liver."
https://openalex.org/W3034954372,"AhpC is a bacterial representative of 2-Cys peroxiredoxins (Prxs) with broad substrate specificity and functional plasticity. However, details underpinning these two important attributes of AhpC remain unclear. Here, we studied the functions and mechanisms of regulation of AhpC in the facultative Gram-negative anaerobic bacterium Shewanella oneidensis, in which AhpC's physiological roles can be conveniently assessed through its suppression of a plating defect due to the genetic loss of a major catalase. We show that successful suppression can be achieved only when AhpC is produced in a dose- and time-dependent manner through a complex mechanism involving activation of the transcriptional regulator OxyR, transcription attenuation, and translation reduction. By analyzing AhpC truncation variants, we demonstrate that reactivity with organic peroxides (OPs) rather than H2O2 is resilient to mutagenesis, implying that OP reduction is the core catalytic function of AhpC. Intact AhpC could be recycled only by its cognate reductase AhpF, and AhpC variants lacking the Prx domain or the extreme C-terminal five residues became promiscuous electron acceptors from the thioredoxin reductase TrxR and the GSH reductase Gor in addition to AhpF, implicating an additional dimension to functional plasticity of AhpC. Finally, we show that the activity of S. oneidensis AhpC is less affected by mutations than that of its Escherichia coli counterpart. These findings suggest that the physiological roles of bacterial AhpCs are adapted to different oxidative challenges, depending on the organism, and that its functional plasticity is even more extensive than previously reported.

Peroxiredoxins (Prxs), a ubiquitous group of peroxidases found in all domains of life, carry out efficient reduction of a typically broad range of substrates, including hydrogen peroxide (HOOH, H2O2), organic peroxides (ROOH, OPs), peroxynitrite, and fatty acid hydroperoxides (1Hofmann B. Hecht H.J. Flohé L. Peroxiredoxins.Biol. Chem. 2002; 383 (12033427): 347-36410.1515/BC.2002.040Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). These proteins use an absolutely conserved, activated cysteine residue (peroxidatic Cys, CP) within a highly conserved active-site pocket structure to reduce peroxides with electrons derived from reduced pyridine dinucleotides. The most widely distributed and abundant types of Prxs are the typical 2-Cys Prxs, which constitute an important component of the cellular defense against oxidative stress caused by peroxides in excess (2Dubbs J.M. Mongkolsuk S. Peroxiredoxins in bacterial antioxidant defense.Subcell. Biochem. 2007; 44 (18084893): 143-19310.1007/978-1-4020-6051-9_7Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). AhpC, a bacterial representative of typical 2-Cys Prxs, is the peroxidase component of the alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (AhpR) complex, which has been best-studied in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhi) (3Poole L.B. Bacterial defenses against oxidants: mechanistic features of cysteine-based peroxidases and their flavoprotein reductases.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433 (15581580): 240-25410.1016/j.abb.2004.09.006Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). AhpCs are highly conserved in terms of sequence and structure; for instance, within γ-proteobacteria, they share over 70% amino acid sequence identity (Fig. S1). These proteins are composed of one thioredoxin (Trx)-like superfamily domain or, alternatively, of two functional domains, Trx domain (residues 2–157, within S. Typhi AhpC unless otherwise noted) and Prx domain (residues 156–181) (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1). During peroxide reduction, AhpC is oxidized to form a disulfide bond between CP (Cys-47) and resolving Cys (CR, Cys-166), which is reactivated by its dedicated reductase AhpF using NADH as electron donor to complete the catalytic cycle (3Poole L.B. Bacterial defenses against oxidants: mechanistic features of cysteine-based peroxidases and their flavoprotein reductases.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433 (15581580): 240-25410.1016/j.abb.2004.09.006Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Despite absolute conservation, only CP is essential for the peroxidase activity, whereas AhpC carrying the mutation of CR to serine largely retains activity (4Ellis H.R. Poole L.B. Roles for the two cysteine residues of AhpC in catalysis of peroxide reduction by alkyl hydroperoxide reductase from Salmonella typhimurium.Biochemistry. 1997; 36 (9341227): 13349-1335610.1021/bi9713658Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). AhpF is a dimeric flavoprotein that consists of three domains: an N-terminal domain, an FAD-binding domain, and an NADH-binding domain (5Reynolds C.M. Poole L.B. Attachment of the N-terminal domain of Salmonella typhimurium AhpF to Escherichia coli thioredoxin reductase confers AhpC reductase activity but does not affect thioredoxin reductase activity.Biochemistry. 2000; 39 (10913298): 8859-886910.1021/bi000826dCrossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The oxidized AhpC favors catalytic dimers, whereas the reduced AhpC preferentially assembles as stable doughnut-shaped decamers (6Wood Z.A. Poole L.B. Hantgan R.R. Karplus P.A. Dimers to doughnuts: redox-sensitive oligomerization of 2-cysteine peroxiredoxins.Biochemistry. 2002; 41 (11969410): 5493-550410.1021/bi012173mCrossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The very C terminus of AhpC is important not only in dimer-to-decamer transition but also in AhpC-AhpF assembly (7Dip P.V. Kamariah N. Nartey W. Beushausen C. Kostyuchenko V.A. Ng T.-S. Lok S.-M. Saw W.G. Eisenhaber F. Eisenhaber B. Grüber G. Key roles of the Escherichia coli AhpC C-terminus in assembly and catalysis of alkylhydroperoxide reductase, an enzyme essential for the alleviation of oxidative stress.Biochim. Biophys.

AhpR was initially identified to be primarily associated with the detoxification of OPs in bacteria, such as S. Typhi and Escherichia coli, because the loss of AhpR results in hypersensitivity to killing by OP exposure (8Jacobson F.S. Morgan R. Christman M. Ames B.

These bacteria lack a functional counterpart of organic hydroperoxide resistance protein (Ohr), the primary scavenger of OPs present in some bacteria, such as Xanthomonas campestris and Pseudomonas species (2Dubbs J.M. Mongkolsuk S. Peroxiredoxins in bacterial antioxidant defense.Subcell. Biochem. 2007; 44 (18084893): 143-19310.1007/978-1-4020-6051-9_7Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the presence of Ohr, AhpR functions as an auxiliary enzyme against OPs, and its absence does not significantly affect OP tolerance (2Dubbs J.M. Mongkolsuk S. Peroxiredoxins in bacterial antioxidant defense.Subcell. Biochem. 2007; 44 (18084893): 143-19310.1007/978-1-4020-6051-9_7Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This is also the case for scavenging H2O2 in many bacteria because AhpR is next to catalases in overall contribution to H2O2 decomposition despite a critical role against H2O2 at low concentrations (10Seaver L.C. Imlay J.A. Alkyl hydroperoxide reductase is the primary scavenger of endogenous hydrogen peroxide in Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183 (11717276): 7173-718110.1128/JB.183.24.7173-7181.2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). As a result, the physiological impacts of the AhpR loss on bacterial H2O2 tolerance are generally small, if not negligible, when catalases are present. Subsequent studies have made it clear that substrates of AhpR are diverse, including a wide range of OPs, implying that the active site of AhpC is able to accommodate virtually any ROOH, of course HOOH (Fig. 1C) (11Parsonage D. Karplus P.A. Poole L.B. Substrate specificity and redox potential of AhpC, a bacterial peroxiredoxin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105 (18165315): 8209-821410.1073/pnas.0708308105Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In addition to broad substrate specificity, AhpCs have gained a reputation as enzymes with functional plasticity. AhpC mutants could function as a disulfide reductase to provide several different means of restoring electron transfer to disulfide-reducing pathways, consisting of both Trx and glutaredoxin (Grx) systems (12Ritz D.

A Trx system is often composed of Trx(s) and a Trx reductase (TrxR), whereas a Grx system consists of Grx(s), GSH, and a GSH reductase (Gor) (15Lu J. Holmgren A. The thioredoxin antioxidant system.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2014; 66 (23899494): 75-8710.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2013.07.036Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). Unlike its peroxidase activity, this new reductase function requires CR but not CP for reduction of mixed disulfides between GSH and Grxs (14Yamamoto Y. Ritz D. Planson A.-G. Jönsson T.J.

In most bacteria having AhpR, the ahpC and ahpF genes constitute an operon, whose transcription is directly controlled by OxyR, the predominant regulatory system mediating cellular response to H2O2 (12Ritz D.

In Pseudomonas putida and Vibrio vulnificus, the expression level of ahpF is found to be much lower than that of ahpC, and a stem-and-loop structure located between the ahpC and ahpF genes has been identified to down-regulate transcription of the ahpF gene (20Fukumori F.

Shewanella, a group of facultative Gram-negative anaerobes, thrive in redox-stratified environments prone to reactive oxygen species formation and are renowned for their versatile respiratory abilities mainly owing to a large repertoire of cytochromes c (22Fredrickson J.K.

In the best-studied genus representative, Shewanella oneidensis, the major catalase for H2O2 degradation is encoded by the katB gene; a katB null mutant carries a severe plating defect on lysogeny broth (LB) agar plates because of H2O2 generated abiotically (24Jiang Y. Dong Y. Luo Q. Li N. Wu G. Gao H. Protection from oxidative stress relies mainly on derepression of OxyR-dependent katBdps in Shewanella oneidensis.J.

Jiang Y. Wu G. Gao H. Managing oxidative stresses in Shewanella oneidensis: intertwined roles of the OxyR and OhrR regulons.Environ. Microbiol. 2014; 16 (25009841): 1821-183410.1111/1462-2920.12418Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that activity of AhpC can be conveniently assessed by its suppression of the plating defect of the katB mutant (27Wan F. Yin J. Sun W. Gao H. Oxidized OxyR up-regulates ahpCF expression to suppress plating defects of oxyR- and catalase-deficient strains.Front. Microbiol. 2019; 10 (30899252): 43910.3389/fmicb.2019.00439Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). More importantly, S. oneidensis is also an excellent model for examination of functional plasticity of AhpC because of the signature reddish brown color of colonies/cell pellets conferred by unusually abundant cytochromes c. As cytochrome c biosynthesis absolutely requires electrons through the disulfide-reducing pathways, any significant impact of AhpC on Trx and Grx systems could be caught by changes in colony color (28Feng X. Sun W. Kong L. Gao H. Distinct roles of Shewanella oneidensis thioredoxin in regulation of cellular responses to hydrogen and organic peroxides.Appl. Environ.

With S. oneidensis as the research model, in this study, we set out to address how production levels of AhpC and AhpF are balanced and what the core activity of AhpC is (for H2O2 or OPs), given its reputation as a broad-specificity peroxidase. We then moved on to explore important attributes of AhpC accounting for its functional plasticity. We further investigated the AhpCs of S. oneidensis and E. coli in terms of reactivity and resilience to mutagenesis. The findings presented here provide new insights into the core functions and expression control of bacterial AhpC as well as add an additional dimension to its functional plasticity. It is well-known that ahpC and ahpF are organized in an operon in bacteria (12Ritz D. Lim J. Reynolds C.M. Poole L.B. Beckwith J. Conversion of a peroxiredoxin into a disulfide reductase by a triplet repeat expansion.Science. 2001; 294 (11588261): 158-16010.1126/science.1063143Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 16Tartaglia L.A.

This is also true in S. oneidensis, although its ahpC and ahpF ORFs are spaced apart by a 234-bp intergenic fragment (Fig. 2A and Fig. S2A). To assess production and activity of AhpR, we looked into its suppressing effect on the plating defect of the strain lacking the major catalase KatB. To this end, the ahpCF operon was placed under the control of isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactoside (IPTG)-inducible promoter Ptac within pHGEN-Ptac, dubbed as Ptac-ahpCF, and the resulting vector was introduced into the ΔkatB strain. Unexpectedly, the AhpCF produced, even by the highest induction (0.5 mm IPTG), only slightly compensated for the KatB loss (Fig. 2B and Fig. S2B). SDS-PAGE analysis of cell samples, however, revealed that AhpC was produced at substantially increased levels with 0.5 mm IPTG, whereas AhpF was invisible (Fig. 2C). To solve this mystery, we tested a series of constructs, which included additional fragments (60, 120, and 200 bp) upstream of the ahpCF operon, within pHGEN-Ptac (Fig. 2A). Expectedly, all of these constructs were able to produce AhpC at highly elevated levels in the presence of 0.5 mm IPTG (Fig. 2C). Nevertheless, their suppressing effects differed. When induced, additional 60- and 120-bp fragments did not improve viability at all compared with Ptac-ahpCF, but Ptac-200-ahpCF fully corrected the defect resulting from the KatB loss (Fig. 2B). Moreover, the suppressing effect was also observed from Ptac-200-ahpCF in the absence of IPTG, indicating that the 200-bp fragment contains a functioning promoter. Indeed, the ahpCF operon driven by this 200-bp fragment significantly suppressed the plating defect of the ΔkatB strain (Fig. 2B), although the overall AhpCF production was lower than that from Ptac-ahpCF (Fig. 2C). As the 200-bp fragment differs from other two in that it contains an OxyR-binding motif (24Jiang Y. Dong Y. Luo Q. Li N. Wu G. Gao H. Protection from oxidative stress relies mainly on derepression of OxyR-dependent katBdps in Shewanella oneidensis.J.

To test this, Ptac-200-ahpCF was introduced into an ΔoxyR strain, which carries a more severe plating defect than the ΔkatB strain (25Shi M. Wan F. Mao Y. Gao H. Unraveling the mechanism for the viability deficiency of Shewanella oneidensis oxyR null mutant.J. Bacteriol. 2015; 197 (25897035): 2179-218910.1128/JB.00154-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Expectedly, the plating defect of the ΔoxyR strain was hardly affected (Fig. 2B). Dependence upon OxyR for successful suppression prompted us to hypothesize that the induction by Ptac with 0.5 mm IPTG may not be sufficient for ΔkatB cells to survive through early growing stages, although AhpC could be accumulated to very high levels in the end. When challenged by H2O2, transcription of the ahpCF operon could be elevated more than 30 times (24Jiang Y. Dong Y. Luo Q. Li N. Wu G. Gao H. Protection from oxidative stress relies mainly on derepression of OxyR-dependent katBdps in Shewanella oneidensis.J. Bacteriol. 2014; 196 (24214945): 445-45810.1128/JB.01077-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), implicating a momentary burst for AhpCF production. However, induction of 0.5 mm IPTG results in Ptac activity of ∼900 Miller units, and higher concentrations would not help much (31Meng Q. Liang H. Gao H. Roles of multiple KASIII homologues of Shewanella oneidensis in initiation of fatty acid synthesis and in cerulenin resistance.Biochim. Biophys.

To test the hypothesis, we introduced the trxA promoter (for the gene encoding major Trx), which is extremely robust (28Feng X. Sun W. Kong L. Gao H. Distinct roles of Shewanella oneidensis thioredoxin in regulation of cellular responses to hydrogen and organic peroxides.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2019; 85 (31444207): e01700-e0171910.1128/aem.01700-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), between Ptac and the ahpCF operon within pHGEN-Ptac. Apparently, in the presence of the trxA promoter, AhpCF could largely and completely suppress the plating defect of ΔkatB without and with IPTG, respectively (Fig. 2B). Expectedly, driven by the additional trxA promoter, AhpCF also suppressed the plating defect of the ΔoxyR strain. As this Ptac-trxA double-promoter (Ptt for simplicity) design enables sufficient and IPTG-responsive induction, it was therefore chosen for all subsequent relevant experiments in this study. These data, collectively, indicate that the successful suppression of the plating defect of the katB mutant requires AhpCF to be produced sufficiently and timely. As shown above, AhpC was produced at levels substantially higher than AhpF (Fig. 2C). This is in line with the fact that an enzymatic active AhpR is composed of 10 AhpCs and 2 AhpFs (19Kamariah N. Nartey W. Eisenhaber B. Eisenhaber F. Grüber G. Low resolution solution structure of an enzymatic active AhpC10:AhpF2 ensemble of the Escherichia coli alkyl hydroperoxide reductase.J. Struct. Biol. 2016; 193 (26584540): 13-2210.1016/j.jsb.2015.11.004Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). According to WebGeSTer DB, a transcription terminator database (32Mitra A. Kesarwani A.K. Pal D. Nagaraja V. WebGeSTer DB—a transcription terminator database.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39 (20972211): D129-D13510.1093/nar/gkq971Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), there is a Rho-independent transcription terminator in the intergenic region of ahpC and ahpF (Fig. 3A). This GC-rich fragment contains two pairs of inverted repeats separated by nonrepeating segments, likely forming a stem-loop structure followed by a run of A and T nucleotides (Fig. S3). For confirmation, quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed. Results showed that there was an average 3.3-fold difference in the numbers of ahpC and ahpF transcripts in cells of an ΔahpCF strain carrying Ptac-ahpCF before and after a H2O2 treatment (Fig. 3B). We then removed the stem-and-loop sequence (ahpCFΔTer) and expressed the resulting ahpCF operon by using Ptac in the ΔahpCF strain. Quantification of transcripts revealed that these two genes were transcribed indistinguishably (Fig. 3B), supporting the existence of the transcription terminator. To determine whether the transcription terminator dictates the expression difference at protein levels, we performed Western blotting. GFP was fused to both AhpC and AhpF, and the fusion did not significantly affect the relative abundance of two transcripts (Fig. 3B). Surprisingly, the result demonstrated that AhpC was still more abundant than AhpF (Fig. 3C), implicating that there is an additional factor. As this factor affects translation, we turned to the RBS. Compared with the consensus RBS of γ-proteobacteria (AGGAGG), AhpC has a rather conserved one, TGGAAG, whereas the AhpF RBS (TGATTT) is very low in similarity (Figs. 2A and 3A). To test whether the RBS accounts for the translation difference, we replaced the AhpF RBS with that of AhpC (RBS*), and the effect of the replacement was examined. As shown in Fig. 3C, the difference in abundance of AhpC and AhpF vanished. Altogether, these data suggest that both the terminator and the RBS of AhpF contribute to low expression of the ahpF gene in S. oneidensis. Although AhpF is widely recognized to be its cognate reductase of AhpC in many bacteria, other proteins that could serve as electron donors for AhpC have been reported, such as Trx and Trx reductase (15Lu J. Holmgren A. The thioredoxin antioxidant system.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2014; 66 (23899494): 75-8710.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2013.07.036Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 33Perkins A.

To determine whether this is the case in S. oneidensis, we constructed double mutants ΔkatBΔahpC and ΔkatBΔahpF. As shown in Fig. 4, both ΔkatBΔahpC and ΔkatBΔahpF exhibited comparably severe plating defects on LB agar plates, indicating that both subunits are required for AhpR activity. The defects were confirmed to be due to the loss of either subunit because of the successful genetic complementation (Fig. 4). Moreover, we found that overexpression of the ahpC gene alone corrected the defect of the ΔkatB strain. This finding suggests that AhpF produced from the ahpCF operon on the chromosome is sufficient to support activity of overproduced AhpC for suppression. In contrast, overexpression of the ahpF gene did not show any suppressing effect, but even further deteriorated the defect (Fig. 4). The toxic effect of AhpF overproduction was confirmed with the ΔahpCF strain expressing the mutant version of the ahpCF operon (RBS*-ahpCFΔTer) that lacks the terminator and has the replaced RBS (Fig. 4). These data imply that AhpC has a strong tolerance to AhpF limitation, but excessive AhpF exerts negative impacts on cell physiology. Nevertheless, the recycling of AhpC is exclusively dependent on AhpF in S. oneidensis. In S. oneidensis, the cellular responses to H2O2 and OPs are intertwined, and AhpR is an important player in coping with both types of reactive oxygen species (26Li N. Luo Q. Jiang Y. Wu G. Gao H.

https://openalex.org/W3034572114,"Cytoplasmic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) are organized into multi-tRNA synthetase complexes (MSCs), from Archaea to mammals. An evolutionary conserved role of the MSCs is enhancement of aminoacylation by forming stable associations of the ARSs and tRNAs. In mammals, a single macromolecular MSC exists, which is composed of eight cytoplasmic ARSs, for nine amino acids, and three scaffold proteins. Consequently, nearly half of aminoacyl-tRNA efflux becomes concentrated at the MSC. Stable supply of aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome is, therefore, considered to be a major role of the mammalian MSC. Furthermore, the mammalian MSC also serves as a reservoir for releasable components with noncanonical functions. In this study, a split-luciferase complementation system was applied to investigate the configuration of the MSC in live mammalian cells. Multiplex interconnections between the components were simplified into binary protein-protein interactions, and pairwise comparison of the interactions reconstituted a framework consistent with previous in vitro studies. Reversibility of the split-luciferase reporter binding demonstrated convertible organization of the mammalian MSC, including interferon gamma (IFNγ)-stimulated glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase 1 (EPRS1) release, as well as the cooperation with the ribosome bridged by the tRNAs. The cell-based analysis provided an improved understanding of the flexible framework of the mammalian MSC in physiological conditions."

https://openalex.org/W3034511488,"The maintenance of a high density of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) is the hallmark of the neuromuscular junction. Muscle-specific anchoring protein (αkap) encoded within the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIα (CAMK2A) gene is essential for the maintenance of AChR clusters both in vivo and in cultured muscle cells. The underlying mechanism by which αkap is maintained and regulated remains unknown. Here, using human cell lines, fluorescence microscopy, and pulldown and immunoblotting assays, we show that α-dystrobrevin (α-dbn), an intracellular component of the dystrophin glycoprotein complex, directly and robustly promotes the stability of αkap in a concentration-dependent manner. Mechanistically, we found that the phosphorylatable tyrosine residues of α-dbn are essential for the stability of α-dbn itself and its interaction with αkap, with substitution of three tyrosine residues in the α-dbn C terminus with phenylalanine compromising the αkap–α-dbn interaction and significantly reducing both αkap and α-dbn accumulation. Moreover, the αkap–α-dbn interaction was critical for αkap accumulation and stability. We also found that the absence of either αkap or α-dbn markedly reduces AChRα accumulation and that overexpression of α-dbn or αkap in cultured muscle cells promotes the formation of large agrin-induced AChR clusters. Collectively, these results indicate that the stability of αkap and α-dbn complex plays an important role in the maintenance of high-level expression of AChRs."

However, the functional role of this evolutionarily conserved localization of cone nuclei is unknown. We previously showed that Linkers of the Nucleoskeleton to the Cytoskeleton (LINC complexes) are essential for the apical migration of cone nuclei during development. Here, we developed an efficient genetic strategy to disrupt cone LINC complexes in mice. Experiments with animals from both sexes revealed that disrupting cone LINC complexes resulted in mislocalization of cone nuclei to the basal side of ONL in mouse retina. This, in turn, disrupted cone pedicle morphology, and appeared to reduce the efficiency of synaptic transmission from cones to bipolar cells. Although we did not observe other developmental or phototransduction defects in cones with mislocalized nuclei, their dark adaptation was impaired, consistent with a deficiency in chromophore recycling. These findings demonstrate that the apical localization of cone nuclei in the ONL is required for the timely dark adaptation and efficient synaptic transmission in cone photoreceptors."

Despite the key role for BLIMP1 in plasma cell maturation and antibody secretion, its potential effect on WM cell biology has not yet been explored. Here we provide evidence of a crucial role for BLIMP1 in the survival of cells from WM cell line models and further demonstrate that BLIMP1 is necessary for the expression of the histone methyltransferase EZH2 in both WM and multiple myeloma cell lines. The effect of BLIMP1 on EZH2 levels is post-translational, at least partially through the regulation of proteasomal targeting of EZH2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis and transcriptome profiling suggest that the two factors co-operate in regulating genes involved in cancer cell immune evasion. Co-cultures of natural killer cells and cells from a WM cell line further suggest that both factors participate in immune evasion by promoting escape from natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Together, the interplay of BLIMP1 and EZH2 plays a vital role in promoting the survival of WM cell lines, suggesting a role for the two factors in Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia."

Protein domain interactions with short linear peptides are found in many biochemical processes of the cell and play a central role in cell physiology and communication. For example, SH2 domains are central to pTyr-signaling networks, which control cell development, migration, and apoptosis (1Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Untangling the ErbB signalling network.Nat. Rev.

The 120 human SH2 domains are considered “readers” because they read the presence of tyrosine phosphorylation by binding specifically to certain phosphorylated amino acid sequences. Approximately half of the binding energy of the SH2–pTyr sequence interaction is due to an invariant arginine, which creates a salt bridge with the ligand pTyr. The remainder of the binding energy results from interactions between the SH2 domain–binding pocket and the residues flanking central pTyr residues (2Machida K. Mayer B.J.

For the limited number of interactions for which they agreed, they reported vastly different affinities for interacting pairs. We identified two issues common to all of the data sets that could be responsible for the discrepancies in results: errors affecting protein concentration and improper use of statistical methods affecting modeling results. First, we found potential sources of errors in protein concentration that could affect reported affinity values. Protein was minimally purified (via nickel chromatography), and protein concentration was measured by absorbance. No study used positive controls to determine the degree of protein functionality before measuring affinity. Thus, protein of varying degrees of purity, functionality, and nonmonomeric content was used for affinity measurements. Impure or degraded protein causes overestimation of protein concentration when compared with the amount of active protein in a sample. These protein concentration errors can propagate directly to errors in affinity, because affinity is derived from concentration and activity. Second, we found errors in model fitting and statistical methods used to evaluate model fitting, which could have significant impact on the reported affinities. All of the affinity studies used the receptor occupancy model and the coefficient of determination (r2) as a determination of how well the model fit the data. For linear models, one can interpret the values of r2 between 0 and 1 as the total percentage of variance explained by the fit. However, when applied to nonlinear models (like the receptor occupancy model used in each of these studies to derive affinity), the r2 value cannot be interpreted as the percent of variance and has been conclusively shown to be a poor indicator of fitness (19Spiess A.-N. Neumeyer N. An evaluation of R2 as an inadequate measure for nonlinear models in pharmacological and biochemical research: a Monte Carlo approach.BMC Pharmacol. 2010; 10 (20529254): 610.1186/1471-2210-10-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar).

Board. 2007; 1542: 6-1310.3141/1542-02Crossref Google Scholar), r2 is still commonly used to evaluate nonlinear models in pharmaceutical and biomedical publications despite being an ineffective and misleading metric. In these publications, the use of r2 effectively resulted in a bias for true positive interactions at the expense of making many false-negative calls and removed many replicate measurements from incorporation into the reported affinity values. Therefore, due to both inaccuracies in quantitative results and the significant potential for large numbers of false-negative results, we had serious concerns about using the published affinities in machine learning. To overcome these issues, we decided to retrieve and reanalyze available raw data to systematically improve classification and affinity accuracy for SH2–pTyr interactions. To accomplish this, we 1) refined model fitting techniques, 2) implemented fitting multiple models to each measurement, 3) used a statistically accurate method for model selection, 4) developed methods to identify and remove nonfunctional protein from the results, and 5) introduced a novel method to address the effects of protein concentration errors on reported affinity. Our revised analysis improves affinity accuracy, improves specificity by reducing the false-negative rate, and results in a dramatic increase in useful data due to the addition of thousands of true-negative results. Evaluation of the revised affinities shows improved learning accuracy within an active learning model, suggesting that there is improved coherency in the features of the revised data set. In the process of evaluating published high-throughput data, we found significant disagreement between data sets. We evaluated all publications using HTP methods to measure SH2 domain interactions with specific peptide sequences. The publications containing SH2 affinity data can be grouped into three distinct data groups (Table 1). The first data group consists of the group of studies published by the MacBeath laboratory from 2006 to 2009 (7Jones R.B. Gordus A. Krall J.A. MacBeath G.

The third data group consists of two nonoverlapping sets of FP experiments published in 2012 and 2014 by the Jones laboratory (13Hause R.J. Leung K.K. Barkinge J.L. Ciaccio M.F. Pin Chuu C.

To determine agreement between data sets, we examined both qualitative and quantitative results. First, we examined the correlation between domain–peptide affinity measurements that overlapped between any two data groups (Fig. 1, top row). We found surprisingly low correlation between affinity measurements (with a maximum correlation of r = 0.367). Next we asked whether the different data groups identified the same positive interactions between domain–peptide pairs, even if they did not agree on the affinity measurements. Here, we found significant disagreement over which domain–peptide pairs were found to interact (Fig. 1, bottom row). Of 347 positive domain–peptide interactions identified by one or more groups, fewer than 16% (55 of 347) were found to interact in all three data groups. No two experiments were able to agree on more than 29% of the positive interactions. The differences in interaction identification were spread randomly among SH2 domains and peptides, with no single SH2 domain, peptide, or peptide family being overrepresented (Fig. S1). These findings demonstrate significant quantitative and qualitative differences between published data from different laboratories and even disagreement between publications from the same laboratory Although there are significant differences between the techniques of PM and FP experimental methods, the differences between positive interactors did not group by technique (Fig. 1), and different techniques had similar numbers of common positive interactions. Although very low, the best correlation (r = 0.367) was between a PM experiment and an FP experiment from the same laboratory. All three data groups used similar protein and peptide production and purification methods, absorbance for determination of protein concentration, the receptor occupancy model for determining affinity, and similar methods of evaluating model fits based on r2. We concluded that we would need to look further into the methods and raw data to evaluate the differences between published data sets or even to evaluate the quality of any single set of published data. Acquisition of raw data from published studies was surprisingly difficult. No publication included raw data, only supplemental tables with post-processed values for affinity, which are insufficient for replication of published results. Furthermore, we discovered that most raw data underlying the published analysis has been lost by the original authors and is no longer available from any party (Table 1). Fortunately, we were able to retrieve raw data from the Jones 2012–2014 data group. 2R. Jones, R. Hause, and K. Leung, personal communication. We began by examining the raw data from the Jones 2012–2014 data group to evaluate the quality and completeness of the data and to review the methods used to process the raw data into its published form. Although some raw data were missing compared with the original publication, by limiting our revised analysis to interactions of single SH2 domains with phosphopeptides from the ErbB family (EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB3, and ERBB4), as well as KIT, MET, and GAB1, the available raw data covered ∼99.6% of the reported measurements. The raw data for each measured interaction consisted of fluorescence polarization measurements of an SH2 domain in solution with a phosphopeptide at equilibrium at 12 concentrations. In the original publication, the raw data were then used to derive an equilibrium dissociation rate constant (Kd) by fitting the receptor occupancy model (developed by Clark in 1926 using the law of mass action (29Clark A.J. The reaction between acetyl choline and muscle cells.J. Physiol. 1926; 61 (16993813): 530-54610.1113/jphysiol.1926.sp002314Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar)). As applied to the fluorescence polarization data, the model takes the following form, Fobs=[SH2 domain]FmaxKd+[SH2 domain](Eq. 1) where Fobs is the observed FP signal at each assayed protein concentration of the SH2 domain (measured in millipolarization units (mP)), and Fmax represents the FP at saturation (see also Fig. S2). The affinity (Kd) and saturation limit (Fmax) are fitted parameters of the model. It is important to note that this model depends on several critical assumptions: that the reaction is reversible, that the ligand only exists in a bound and unbound form, that all receptor molecules are equivalent, that the biological response is proportional to occupied receptors, and that the system is at equilibrium. We hypothesized that the specific methods used to implement the receptor occupancy model in the original publications might have affected the accuracy of the originally published results. We examined three aspects of the impl"
https://openalex.org/W3035536614,"The human cytochrome P450 family 11 subfamily B member 2 (hCYP11B2) gene encodes aldosterone synthase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of aldosterone. In some humans, hCYP11B2 undergoes a unique intron conversion whose function is largely unclear. The intron conversion is formed by a replacement of the segment of DNA within intron 2 of hCYP11B2 with the corresponding region of the hCYP11B1 gene. We show here that the intron conversion is located in an open chromatin form and binds more strongly to the transcriptional regulators histone acetyltransferase P300 (p300), NFκB, and CCAAT enhancer–binding protein α (CEBPα). Reporter constructs containing the intron conversion had increased promoter activity on transient transfection in H295R cells compared with WT intron 2. We generated humanized transgenic (TG) mice containing all the introns, exons, and 5′- and 3′-flanking regions of the hCYP11B2 gene containing either the intron conversion or WT intron 2. We found that TG mice containing the intron conversion have (a) increased plasma aldosterone levels, (b) increased hCYP11B2 mRNA and protein levels, and (c) increased blood pressure compared with TG mice containing WT intron 2. Results of a ChIP assay showed that chromatin obtained from the adrenals of TG mice containing the intron conversion binds more strongly to p300, NFκB, and CEBPα than to WT intron 2. These results uncover a functional role of intron conversion in hCYP11B2 and suggest a new paradigm in blood pressure regulation."
