https://openalex.org/W1528919862,"Abstract Precursor molecules of Escherichia coli wild type and mutant tyrosine tRNA's contain at both their 5' and 3' termini extra nucleotides in addition to those of the mature tRNA molecule. The early steps of processing these precursor molecules must involve specific ribonuclease cleavage. We report the isolation from E. coli extracts of the specific endonucleolytic RNase which cleaves only a single phosphodiester bond of the 129 nucleotide tyrosine tRNA precursor molecule. This cleavage removes all extra nucleotides present at the 5' terminus of the precursor as a 41 nucleotide fragment, exposing the 5' end of the mature tRNA. After sufficient purification, this activity has no effect upon the extra nucleotides at the 3' end of the tRNA precursor. Therefore processing of the two ends of this molecule must be carried out by different enzymatic activities. This novel RNase activity, which we have called RNase P, has been purified by washing ribosomes with 0.2 m NH4Cl, followed by ammonium sulfate fractionation and chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex and phosphocellulose. At this stage it shows no evidence of other E. coli RNase activities. RNase P requires both monovalent and divalent cations for optimal activity, and has a pH optimum of 8.0. In the course of purifying RNase P, we have discovered in other subcellular fractions of E. coli RNase activities potentially responsible for additional steps of precursor tRNA processing."

https://openalex.org/W1499964035,"Abstract This paper describes the measurement of free electrophoretic mobility (M0) and retardation coefficient (Kr) for selected soluble proteins, maleylated soluble proteins, and membrane proteins in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gel electrophoresis. For the soluble proteins Kr increases linearly with molecular weight, while M0 is nearly the same. Reaction of soluble proteins with maleic anhydride causes increases in Kr and decreases in M0 which explain the anomalously low mobility of these proteins on SDS gels. Based on the results with maleylated proteins, measurement of M0 and Kr may allow detection of proteins that migrate anomalously on SDS gel without knowledge of their molecular weights. This approach was used as a means of validating molecular weight estimates for several membrane proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1518689773,"DNA polymerase III, an enzyme essential for DNA replication, has been purified more than 10,000-fold from cell-free extracts of Escherichia coli. The enzyme, judged to be 10 to 20% pure, requires all four deoxynucleoside 5′-triphosphates, Mg++, ethanol, and native DNA for maximal activity. It is present in amounts sufficient to account for the in vivo rate of replication. DNA polymerase III activity is inhibited by sulfhydryl inhibitors and by salt; it is not inhibited by antiserum directed against DNA polymerase I. The most active template for DNA polymerase III is DNA degraded partially by exonuclease III. Linear duplex DNA, single-stranded DNA, or DNA with single strand scissions is not used as template. The enzyme requires a primer to initiate synthesis and polymerization proceeds in the 5′ to 3′ direction by covalent extension of the primer."

Two of four chronic paranoid schizophrenic patients who were resistant to phenothiazine treatment became worse with 5-hydroxytryptophan, one improved. It is presumed that these psychological changes were directly or indirectly produced from increases in brain serotonin. Indirect data from animals and humans indicate that there may be an abnormality in serotonin metabolism in some schizophrenics. While our data are consistent with this hypothesis, other explanations for our data must be entertained."
https://openalex.org/W1564834872,"Abstract 2-Keto-4-hydroxyglutarate aldolase has been purified to homogeneity from extracts of Escherichia coli grown on nutrient broth. Values of 62,500 and 64,000, respectively, are obtained for the molecular weight of the enzyme by the procedures of gel filtration and sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The aldolase has a pH optimum of 8.6 and does not appear to require divalent metal ions for activity. p-Mercuriphenylsulfonate, iodoacetate, and N-ethylmaleimide partially inhibit enzymatic activity. The aldolase from this source preferentially cleaves or forms the l isomer of 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate. When the enzyme is tested with a number of compounds as substrate, it catalyzes the cleavage of only 2-keto-4-hydroxybutyrate and oxalacetate besides 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate. A higher degree of specificity is manifested for binding analogs of pyruvate than of glyoxylate, as determined by the extent of enzyme inactivation when the aldolase is incubated with analog compounds in the presence of NaBH4. Extensive loss of aldolase activity occurs when the enzyme is incubated with either pyruvate or glyoxylate in the presence of NaBH4, and 1 mole of 14C-labeled substrate is stably bound per mole of enzyme. Competition studies indicate that pyruvate, glyoxylate, and 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate all bind at the same active site of the aldolase. Incubation of 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate aldolase with glyoxylate in the presence of cyanide also causes irreversible loss of enzymatic activity, suggesting the formation of a stable aminonitrile with this substrate. Under these conditions, approximately 1 mole of [14C]glyoxylate is bound per mole of aldolase. Irreversible inactivation of aldolase activity by cyanide is not observed with pyruvate. The pure aldolase from E. coli has a higher relative level of β-decarboxylase activity toward oxalacetate than does the enzyme obtained from extracts of bovine liver. Both aldolase and β-decarboxylase activities are lost when the E. coli aldolase is treated with glyoxylate or pyruvate in the presence of NaBH4, suggesting that the same active site participates in both reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1539275929,"The mechanism of action of the protein rho (ρ) in DNA-dependent RNA synthesis has been examined. While ρ can interact with DNA to form a protein-DNA complex, detailed studies of this interaction suggest that this is not the mode of action of ρ. ρ appears to interact with Escherichia coli RNA polymerase at specific DNA sites leading to the formation of RNA chains of well defined length. RNA chains synthesized in the presence or absence of ρ predominantly have uridine at their 3′-hydroxyl terminus. ρ does not affect the size of RNA chains synthesized by the T7-induced RNA polymerase. ρ acts catalytically affecting many E. coli RNA polymerase molecules and is not tightly bound in a complex. The effect of ρ can be observed on RNA chains nearly three-quarters complete, further indicating that ρ alters the growth of RNA chains at specific DNA sites. After the release of RNA chains from the RNA polymerase-DNA complex, RNA polymerase remains attached to DNA in a nonactive state. The enzyme can be released from this sequestered form by increasing the ionic strength of the reaction medium."
https://openalex.org/W1574227883,"Abstract Xanthosine 5'-phosphate aminase (xanthosine 5'-phosphate:ammonia ligase (AMP), EC 6.3.4.1) was purified from Escherichia coli B-96. The purity of the enzyme preparation was established by its behavior in disc gel electrophoresis, ultracentrifugation, and gel filtration. The extinction coefficient (E1%280) was determined to be 11.2 cm-1 with the use of the analytical ultracentrifuge as a differential refractometer. The diffusion coefficient (D020,w) of 5.09 x 10-7 cm2 s-1 was obtained by the measurement of free diffusion in the analytical ultracentrifuge. Differential sedimentation equilibrium provided a value of 0.739 ml per g for the partial specific volume (v). The sedimentation coefficient (s020,w) was estimated to be 5.91 x 10-13 s. The molecular weight of the enzyme was determined by sedimentation equilibrium measurements to be 126,000 ± 4,000. Disc gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate, sedimentation equilibrium in guanidine hydrochloride, and NH2-terminal analysis indicated that xanthosine 5'-phosphate aminase is a dimer composed of identical subunits. The molecular weight of the subunit was determined to be 63,000 ± 3,000. Possible molecular dimensions for the enzyme consistent with its hydrodynamic properties are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1560012604,"Abstract Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase was purified from Escherichia coli, strain B (ATCC 11303), and its properties studied. Its amino acid composition and some of its structural properties closely resemble those of the enzyme recently purified by Smith ((1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 4234–4241). Steady state kinetics, studied in the presence of the activators acetyl coenzyme A, fructose diphosphate, guanosine triphosphate, and 2-mercaptoethanol, and the inhibitor, l-aspartate, suggest an allosteric enzyme going through ligand-dependent transitions between two discrete states. This conclusion is supported by measurements of optical rotation which show two extreme values attainable in saturating activator, and inhibitor, respectively. The active (R) state is characterized by a single value for Vmax and by a Km of about 0.6 mm for phosphoenolpyruvate, approached at infinite activator concentration. The alternate (T) state, stabilized by aspartate, is catalytically completely inert. The property which distinguishes this enzyme from other phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylases is that upon addition of substrate, steady state velocity develops after a lag period of variable duration. Substrate and activators shorten, but the inhibitor prolongs this lag period. Analysis of the dependence of the lag period on enzyme concentration suggests that at assay dilutions (7 µg per ml) the enzyme is present as an inactive dimer of two peptide chains (mol wt 100,000) which upon addition of substrate, or activators, associates to the active tetramer. The lag period does not completely vanish even at infinite enzyme, substrate, or activator concentrations. The residual lag period is associated with a modification of the enzyme by the substrate, for once the enzyme has reacted with substrate the residual lag period vanishes for several hours, and then gradually returns. A model, compatible with these observations, is suggested."

Genetic analysis of temperature independent transductants indicated that strain 1113B carries two mutations that cause a decrease in its capacity to grow at elevated temperatures. However, neither of these mutations is responsible for the altered ribonuclease II in this strain. Moreover, strains with this altered RNase II enzyme are capable of growing exponentially at 45°, and growth at that temperature (45°) does not affect their level of ribonuclease II."
https://openalex.org/W1510804865,"Abstract Salmonella paratyphi B SL 877 was shown to be a suitable source of flagellar protein whose amino acid sequence was determined by the H-1 structural gene of Salmonella typhimurium. Isolated flagellin gave one band at a variety of pH levels in acrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of disaggregating agents and contained a small amount of carbohydrate. The amino acid content of this flagellin was determined and the NH2-terminal amino acid was identified as alanine. Analysis of the flagellin by gel filtration on agarose in 6 m guanidine HCl-0.1 m 2-mercaptoethanol and acrylamide gel electrophoresis in 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate both indicated a molecular weight of 49,000 for the protein, a value not in agreement with previous suggestions. Digestion of the flagellin with trypsin was performed in the presence of 2 m urea, and 29 peptides were isolated from the resulting digest by combinations of column and paper chromatography. The combined amino acid content of the purified peptides corresponded to 46% of the total amino acids present in the molecule (based on a mol wt of 49,000). The amino acid sequence was determined for the peptides isolated and four peptides were found to contain adjacent glycine residues."
https://openalex.org/W1543968520,"Abstract The hydrolysis of O-p-phenylazophenylphosphorothioate by Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase was studied by the stopped-flow technique. Burst kinetics is observed at both acid and basic pH, suggesting that a step following thiophosphorylation is rate-limiting at all pH values. At pH 8.5, activation of a second active site on the enzyme dimer is observed in the transient phase as substrate concentration is increased. The rate of the transient phase, however, decreases at high substrate concentration, suggesting that negative cooperativity exists between the two active sites. The implications of these results for the mechanism of hydrolysis of both O-phosphorothioate and phosphate monoesters by alkaline phosphatase are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1550508606,"Abstract β-Hydroxyacyl acyl carrier protein (ACP) dehydrase has been purified 2900-fold from extracts of Escherichia coli. The enzyme catalyzes the reversible dehydration of β-hydroxyacyl-ACP thioesters to yield specifically trans-2-enoyl-ACP products. It is active with trans-2-enoyl-ACP thioesters of chain lengths from 4 through 16 carbon atoms. The enzyme catalyzes the hydration of cis-5-trans-2-dodecadienoyl-ACP, an intermediate in unsaturated fatty acid synthesis, as well as the trans-2-enoyl-ACP substrates that are intermediates in saturated fatty acid synthesis. Thus this enzyme can function in the synthesis of both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. The lowest enzyme activity was noted with trans-2-decenoyl-ACP. The relevance of this finding with respect to the activity of β-hydroxydecanoyl thioester dehydrase, which specifically catalyzes the conversion of β-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP to cis-3-decenoyl-ACP is discussed as a possible factor in control of saturated versus unsaturated fatty acid synthesis. Attempts to separate or to show distinguishing characteristics of β-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydrase activities with short, medium, or long chain substrates were unsuccessful, and these activities are therefore attributed to a single enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1487232549,"Abstract The valyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.9) of Escherichia coli was compared to the modified form of the enzyme which develops during infection by bacteriophage T4. The two forms were found to differ in their stability to heat, stability to urea, ability to charge yeast tRNA, electrophoretic mobility, sedimentation rate in sucrose gradients, and molecular size. Both enzyme activities are easily purified and retain their characteristic properties during and after purification. Spectral properties of the two purified enzymes are similar and are incompatible with the presence of a bound tRNA. Surprisingly, no major differences were detected between the two enzymes in the normal charging reaction, including the relative specificity for different E. coli tRNAval species. Modified enzyme was discovered to contain a phage-directed component that can be dissociated from the core enzyme by treatment with either urea, guanidine hydrochloride, or sodium dodecyl sulfate. This component, called τ factor, could be resolved from the core enzyme by gel electrophoresis or agarose chromatography, and is judged to be a polypeptide on the basis of its size (approximately 10,000 molecular weight), acid precipitability, absorption spectrum, and Pronase susceptibility. Discovery of this factor explains several features of synthetase modification, including its sensitivity to inhibitors of protein synthesis, and its control by a phage gene."
https://openalex.org/W1568299752,"The method of Bruton and Hartley for the isolation of short NH2-terminal sequences of peptides has been applied to β-galactosidase. Maleyl-β-galactosidase was hydrolyzed with thermolysin and the digest was acidified. After passage through Dowex 50, Thr-Met was obtained from the eluate. This procedure has been extended. For the isolation of a larger NH2-terminal peptide, maleyl-protein was treated with trypsin, and the digest was subjected to additional hydrolysis with carboxypeptidase B. The peptide mixture was acidified, centrifuged, and filtered through Dowex 50. From the eluate an octapeptide was purified which corresponded to the NH2-terminal portion of a tridecapeptide isolated previously from another hydrolysate. The sequence was determined to be Thr-Met-Ile-Thr-Asp-Ser-Leu-Ala-Val-Val-Leu-Gln-Arg. Another modification of this method is proposed for the isolation of a COOH-terminal peptide. Following hydrolysis of maleyl-protein with trypsin, the peptide mixture may be maleylated before passage through Dowex 50. The COOH-terminal peptide is normally not expected to be adsorbed to the resin. In the case of β-galactosidase a COOH-terminal decapeptide was obtained from such a mixture in the fraction insoluble at pH 4. Its sequence was found to be Tyr-His-Ser-Gln-Val-Leu-Tyr-Cys-Gln-Lys. These procedures for the isolation of NH2- and COOH-terminal peptides may be useful for other proteins."

The data for kinetics of the exchange of the hydrogen at C-3 of substrate catalyzed by a d-ribulose 5-phosphate 3-epimerase have been examined. The data indicate that the enzyme must contain two hydrogen donors (acceptors) which interact with the hydrogen at carbon 3 of d-ribulose 5-phosphate and d-xylulose 5-phosphate, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1502351920,"Abstract The role of RNA synthesis was investigated in the action of chorionic gonadotropin on ovaries of immature rats. Chorionic gonadotropin accelerates the ovarian incorporation of [3H]uridine in vivo into rapidly labeled nuclear RNA within 10 min after hormone injection. Analysis of the RNA base composition, expressed as base ratio (A + U):(G + C), shows that hormonal stimulation of the rate of [3H]uridine incorporation is accompanied by a relative increase of the A + U content of the rapidly labeled nuclear RNA. Hormonal stimulation of nuclear RNA synthesis in vivo is found to be specific for chorionic gonadotropin and is inhibited by actinomycin D. The extent of ovarian chromatin template available for transcription in the presence of added Escherichia coli RNA polymerase is increased 1 hour to 5 days after injection of a single dose of chorionic gonadotropin. No modification of the ovarian template capacity is observed 10 to 30 min after hormone administration. The effect of chorionic gonadotropin on RNA polymerase (EC2.7.7.6) activity in intact nuclei from ovaries of immature rats was studied in the presence of Mg++ ions at low ionic strength, or in the presence of Mn++ ions and 0.4 m ammonium sulfate. Administration of 200 i.u. of chorionic gonadotropin to rats is followed by a 400 to 500% increase over control values of the Mn++-dependent RNA polymerase activity 2, 3, and 18 hours following hormone injection, but it has no effect when studied during shorter time intervals. Under similar conditions of hormone treatment, the Mg++-dependent RNA polymerase activity in isolated rat ovary nuclei is significantly increased over controls 10 and 15 min and 3 hours following gonadotropin injection. It is concluded that an early stimulation of the Mg++-dependent RNA polymerase activity in ovarian nuclei is an essential feature of the early action of chorionic gonadotropin in the ovary of the immature rat."

https://openalex.org/W1606620808,"Abstract Liver acetyl-CoA carboxylase, a biotin-enzyme which catalyzes the ATP-dependent carboxylation of acetyl-CoA (acceptor) to form malonyl-CoA (carboxylated acceptor), decarboxylates malonyl-CoA by a biotin-dependent, as well as a biotin-independent mechanism. Neither ADP, Pi, nor divalent metal ion are required for either of these abortive decarboxylations. The biotin-dependent reaction is blocked by avidin and is activated synergistically by acetyl-CoA and citrate, an allosteric effector of the carboxylase. However, the biotin-independent process is unaffected by avidin and citrate, and is inhibited slightly by acetyl-CoA. The occurrence of this abortive reaction indicates that the enzyme promotes the labilization of the free carboxyl group of malonyl-CoA and that insertion of a proton in its place is possible without the participation of the biotinyl prosthetic group. This phenomenon appears to be a property of biotin-dependent carboxylases since pig heart propionyl-CoA carboxylase, the biotin-free carboxyltransferase component of Escherichia coli acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and avian liver pyruvate carboxylase catalyze similar biotin-independent decarboxylations of their respective carboxylated acceptor substrates. Liver acetyl-CoA carboxylase also catalyzes carboxyl transfer from [3-14C]malonyl-CoA to free d-biotin, a model for the second half-reaction in the over-all carboxylation process. The acid-labile radioactive carboxylation product was stabilized by methylation with diazomethane, and the ester formed identified as 1'-N-carboxy-d-biotin dimethyl ester by carrier recrystallization with the authentic compound. The model reaction does not involve the covalently bound biotinyl prosthetic group, since the essentially irreversible complex formation of this group with avidin does not block carboxyl transfer. While the reaction is specific in that l-biotin and imidazolidone-2 are inactive, certain closely related biotin derivatives including d-homobiotin and biocytin (e-N-d-biotinyl-l-lysine) are somewhat better acceptor substrates than d-biotin. The fact that citrate blocks carboxyl transfer to free d-biotin and biocytin with both avidin-complexed and native carboxylase without affecting the rate of malonyl-CoA decarboxylation is compatible with earlier evidence implicating the biotinyl prosthetic group as the focal point of citrate-induced conformational changes."
https://openalex.org/W1570781343,"Abstract Synthesis of cis-5-β-hydroxy[2-14C]dodecenoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP), a postulated intermediate in unsaturated fatty acid synthesis in Escherichia coli, was achieved from cis-3-decenoyl-ACP and [2-14C]malonyl-ACP through the combined action of two enzymes, β-ketoacyl-ACP synthetase and β-keto-acyl-ACP reductase. The conversion of cis-5-β-hydroxy[2-14C]dodecenoyl-ACP to cis-5-trans-2-[2-14C]dodecadienoyl-ACP and to cis-5-[2-14C]-dodecenoyl-ACP was shown utilizing a crude fatty acid synthetase preparation of wild type E. coli. Elongation of cis-5-β-hydroxy[2-14C]dodecenoyl-ACP to long chain unsaturated fatty acids was also shown with this fatty acid synthetase preparation. These studies indicate that cis-5-β-hydroxydodecenoyl-ACP, cis-5-trans-2dodecadienoyl-ACP, and cis-5-dodecenoyl-ACP are intermediates in the synthesis of long chain unsaturated fatty acids. Extracts of a class of fatty acid biosynthetic mutants, fab B, which specifically cannot synthesize unsaturated fatty acids although synthesizing saturated fatty acids normally, were examined for all the above activities. No apparent defect was revealed in any step involved in the utilization of cis-5-β-hydroxy[2-14C]dodecenoyl-ACP for long chain unsaturated fatty acid synthesis. Mutant extracts were also found to contain normal amounts of β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase and β-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydrase, which apparently function in both the saturated and unsaturated fatty acid biosynthetic pathways, and of enoyl-ACP reductase. It is concluded that fab B mutants contain a mutation in an enzyme which catalyzes a reaction unique to the unsaturated fatty acid pathway which is yet unknown."

https://openalex.org/W1585617515,"Abstract Reactivity of sulfhydryl groups with 5 ,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) in 4 m urea and fluorescence emission of 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate were used to probe changes in enzyme conformation. The substrate chorismate and the end product inhibitor tryptophan caused conformational alterations in anthranilate synthetase which were related to the mechanism of catalysis and inhibition, respectively. Tryptophan increased the rate of reaction of enzyme sulfhydryl groups while chorismate decreased the rate. Tryptophan and chorismate both decreased the fluorescence emission of enzyme-bound 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate, but to different extents. The concentration dependence for changes in conformation correlated with saturation of catalytic and inhibitory sites with chorismate and tryptophan, respectively. Binding of chorismate and tryptophan was measured by equilibrium dialysis. Sites for 1 to 2 eq of each ligand were detected. Mg2+ reduced the dissociation constant for chorismate binding by 3- to 4-fold but did not change the number of available sites. Binding of tryptophan antagonized binding of chorismate and vice versa. Binding of tryptophan and chorismate appeared to be mutually exclusive although the data were not sufficiently precise to prove this point unequivocally. It is proposed that inhibition of anthranilate synthetase activity results when tryptophan binds to a regulatory site and maintains the enzyme in a conformation having poor affinity for substrates. The chorismate-dependent conformational change which was detected may facilitate binding of the second substrate glutamine."

Under these conditions the inactivation is caused by conformational changes and dissociation of the enzyme into subunits. In 4.0 to 8.0 m urea and 1.2 to 3.0 m guanidine hydrochloride, the inactivation is irreversible due to the aggregation of the partially unfolded polypeptide chains. In 3.0 to 6.0 m guanidine hydrochloride, the enzyme is extensively unfolded and partially (15%) reassociable to the active form by removal of the denaturant.
