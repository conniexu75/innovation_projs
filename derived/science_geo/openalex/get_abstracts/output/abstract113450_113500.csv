https://openalex.org/W1994560336,"Transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) signals through a heteromeric protein kinase receptor that has a limited ability to bind ligand. This limitation is overcome by the action of betaglycan (TGF beta type III receptor), a separate TGF beta-binding membrane protein of previously unknown function. Betaglycan presents TGF beta directly to the kinase subunit of the signaling receptor, forming a high affinity ternary complex. Membrane betaglycan increases TGF beta binding to the signaling receptor, enhances cell responsiveness to TGF beta, and eliminates marked biological differences between TGF beta isoforms. Thus, betaglycan is a direct regulator of TGF beta access to the signaling receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1981772689,"We have used frog egg extracts that assemble mitotic spindles to identify the event that triggers sister chromatid separation. Adding a nondegradable form of cyclin B prevents maturation-promoting factor (MPF) inactivation but does not block sister chromatid separation, showing that MPF inactivation is not needed to initiate anaphase. In contrast, adding an N-terminal fragment of cyclin, which acts as a specific competitor for cyclin degradation, produces a dose-dependent delay in MPF inactivation and sister chromatid separation. Methylated ubiquitin, which inhibits ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, also delays sister chromatid separation, suggesting that ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis is necessary to initiate anaphase. The N-terminal cyclin fragment inhibits chromosome separation even in extracts that contain only nondegradable forms of cyclin, suggesting that proteins other than the known cyclins must be degraded to dissolve the linkage between sister chromatids."

https://openalex.org/W1590066614,"The current paper reports the identification of a protein in rat liver nuclei that binds to the sterol regulatory element (SRE-1) in the promoter of the gene for the low density lipoprotein receptor. The 10-base pair SRE-1 is embedded within a 16-base pair sequence designated Repeat 2 located immediately upstream of a related sequence designated Repeat 3. To confirm that DNA recognition by the SRE-1 binding protein (SREBP) correlates with sterol-regulated transcription, we synthesized an artificial promoter that contains two copies of wild-type or mutant Repeat 2 + 3 sequences immediately upstream of a TATA box from adenovirus. The synthetic promoters were inserted upstream of a reporter gene and tested for transcriptional activity in the absence and presence of sterols after transient transfection into monkey CV-1 cells. The reporter gene with two copies of the wild-type Repeat 2 + 3 sequence was transcribed actively in sterol-deprived cells and was repressed by more than 80% when sterols were present. Binding of SREBP to the SRE-1 sequence, assessed by gel mobility shift assays, correlated precisely on a nucleotide-by-nucleotide basis with the transcriptional activity of each of 16 synthetic promoters with point mutations in Repeat 2. The SREBP bound to the nine mutant promoters that were positive for sterol-regulated transcription, and it did not bind to any of the nine point mutants that abolished transcription. We conclude that SREBP is a DNA binding protein that mediates sterol-regulated transcription of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene."

https://openalex.org/W2012781495,"We have investigated ubiquitinated paired helical filaments, which produce a proteinaceous smear in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. The smear consisted largely of the carboxy-terminal portion of tau and ubiquitin. The ubiquitin-targeted protein was identified as tau in paired helical filaments, and the conjugation sites were localized to the microtubule-binding region. Most ubiquitin in paired helical filaments occurred as a monoubiquitinated form, and only a small proportion of ubiquitin formed multiubiquitin chains. There was a ubiquitin-negative smear, in which tau was much less processed in the amino-terminal portion. This strongly suggests that the amino-terminal processing of tau in paired helical filaments precedes its ubiquitination."
https://openalex.org/W2014702667,"Signal transmission by insulin involves tyrosine phosphorylation of a major insulin receptor substrate (IRS-1) and exchange of Ras-bound guanosine diphosphate for guanosine triphosphate. Proteins containing Src homology 2 and 3 (SH2 and SH3) domains, such as the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2), bind tyrosine phosphate sites on IRS-1 through their SH2 regions. Such complexes in COS cells were found to contain the heterologously expressed putative guanine nucleotide exchange factor encoded by the Drosophila son of sevenless gene (dSos). Thus, GRB2, p85, or other proteins with SH2-SH3 adapter sequences may link Sos proteins to IRS-1 signaling complexes as part of the mechanism by which insulin activates Ras."
https://openalex.org/W1584878126,"DNA damage caused by UV radiation in the presence of riboflavin or hematoporphyrin was characterized by the DNA sequencing technique using 32P-labeled DNA fragments and the analysis of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) formation in calf thymus DNA. Exposure of double-stranded DNA to 365 or 302 nm radiation in the presence of riboflavin induced the sequence-specific DNA cleavage which is different from that caused by 302 or 254 nm irradiation in the absence of a sensitizer. The specific cleavage sites were the guanine residues located 5' to guanine. On the other hand, when denatured single-stranded DNA was irradiated at 365 nm with riboflavin or hematoporphyrin, cleavages occurred at most guanine residues. With D2O, the sequence-specific damage of double-stranded DNA by riboflavin was not enhanced, whereas the damage to single-stranded DNA by hematoporphyrin was greatly enhanced. Photodynamic action of riboflavin caused the formation of 8-OH-dG in double-stranded DNA. The enhancing effect of D2O on 8-OH-dG formation was not observed with riboflavin. By contrast, hematoporphyrin plus 365-nm light induced the 8-OH-dG formation only in denatured single-stranded DNA and the 8-OH-dG yield was increased about 2-fold in D2O. ESR spin destruction experiments suggested that photoexcited riboflavin reacts with dGMP to produce riboflavin anion radical and guanine cation radical, but not with other mononucleotides. The estimated ratio of 8-OH-dG yield to total guanine loss indicates that the photoexcited riboflavin induces 8-OH-dG formation specifically at the guanine residue located 5' to guanine through electron transfer. The mechanism was discussed in relation to UV carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1545475398,"Shortly after activation by either thrombin or the tethered ligand domain peptide SFLLRN, thrombin receptors undergo homologous desensitization, temporarily losing their ability to respond to both agonists. We have examined the role of receptor internalization and recycling in this process using receptor-directed antibodies as probes. The results show within 1 min of activation > 85% of the approximately 200,000 thrombin receptors on megakaryoblastic human erythroleukemia (HEL) and CHRF-288 cells are sequestered into endosomes via coated pits, after which the majority are transferred to lysosomes. This process does not require proteolysis of the receptor and occurs with sufficient speed to play a major role in the regulation of thrombin receptor function. Although most of the internalized receptors are ultimately degraded, approximately 25% return to the cell surface. These recycled receptors are in a state in which they can respond to SFLLRN but not thrombin; nor do they self-activate despite the apparent continued presence of the tethered ligand. In contrast to other G protein-coupled receptors, which are internalized and then recycled in an activatable state, recovery of the thrombin response occurs only after the expression on the cell surface of adequate numbers of newly synthesized receptors."

https://openalex.org/W1558733231,"In vertebrate photoreceptors, light induces hydrolysis of cGMP by activating cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE), which results in closure of the cGMP-activated cation channel. During light adaptation, the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration decreases, and this decrease is one of the underlying mechanisms of light adaptation. Sensitivity-modulating protein (S-modulin) is a Ca(2+)-binding protein involved in light adaptation in frog rods; it regulates both the light sensitivity of PDE and the lifetime of activated PDE by controlling rhodopsin phosphorylation in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. Recoverin has been reported as a Ca(2+)-dependent regulator of guanylate cyclase in bovine rods (Dizhoor, A. M., Ray, S., Kumar, S., Niemi, G., Spencer, M., Brolley, D., Walsh, K. A. Philipov, P. P., Hurley, J. B., and Stryer, L. (1991) Science 251, 915-918). Here, we show that recoverin has similar activity as S-modulin, and the amino acid sequences of both proteins are similar. The results strongly suggest that recoverin is bovine S-modulin and regulates PDE activation."
https://openalex.org/W1996235939,"Histamine is a neuromodulator in the brain, and the hippocampus is one of the regions of the brain that is innervated by histaminergic neurons. When applied to cultured hippocampal neurons, histamine selectively increased by up to tenfold the amplitude of the component of synaptic transmission that was mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Spontaneous miniature synaptic currents and the current elicited by applied NMDA also were enhanced, indicating that the histamine effect was expressed primarily postsynaptically. These results suggest that histamine may modulate processes involving NMDA receptors, such as the induction of long-term potentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1599557787,"Hepatocytes from hypothyroid rats respire more slowly than those from control animals; cells from hyperthyroid rats respire faster. We have identified the blocks of reactions whose kinetics are significantly affected by thyroid hormones and have quantified the contribution of flux through different blocks of energy-dissipating reactions to the altered oxygen consumption. In cells from hypothyroid rats compared with littermate euthyroid controls, there were significant kinetic effects on non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption reactions and on mitochondrial proton leak but not on ATP turnover. Approximately 50% of the decrease in cellular oxygen consumption of hypothyroid cells was accounted for by a decrease in mitochondrial proton leak rate and approximately 50% by decreased non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption. Metabolic control analysis showed that the distribution of control over oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial potential in hepatocytes from hypothyroid animals was broadly similar to its distribution in euthyroid controls. In cells from hyperthyroid rats compared with littermate euthyroid controls, there were significant kinetic effects on mitochondrial proton leak and on the reactions involved in ATP synthesis and consumption but not on non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption. Approximately 50% of the increase in cellular oxygen consumption in hyperthyroid cells was accounted for by an increased mitochondrial proton leak rate and the remainder by increased ATP turnover; there were no changes in non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption."
https://openalex.org/W1521158172,"Agonists for Gi-coupled receptors augment Gs-stimulated cAMP synthesis in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells transiently expressing the type II isozyme of adenylylcyclase (AC-II). This augmentation, mediated by beta gamma subunits released from activated Gi, can be blocked by expression of the alpha subunit (alpha t) of retinal transducin (Gt), which presumably sequesters free beta gamma (Federman, A. D., Conklin, B. R., Schrader, K. A., Reed, R. R., and Bourne, H. R. (1992) Nature 356, 159-161). The alpha subunit of Gq, representing a G protein family distinct from both Gs and Gi, mimicked the inhibitory effect of alpha t, suggesting that hormonal stimulation of endogenous Gq might also release beta gamma subunits and thereby augment AC-II activity. Agonists for either of two Gq-coupled receptors did augment Gs-stimulated cAMP synthesis in HEK-293 cells expressing AC-II, but this effect was not blocked by expression of alpha t. The increased stimulation of AC-II was probably not mediated by the release of beta gamma subunits from Gq but rather by activation of protein kinase C (PKC) because of the following. (a) Phorbol esters, which activate PKC directly, elevated cAMP 2-fold in HEK-293 cells transfected with AC-II; this increase was synergistic with Gs-mediated activation of AC-II. (b) Treatments that partially inhibit or down-regulate PKC also partially prevented stimulation of AC-II by phorbol esters or by agonists for Gq-coupled receptors. Taken together, these results indicate that AC-II can integrate regulatory signals transmitted by at least three classes of G proteins; extracellular signals acting through Gs are enhanced synergistically by simultaneous signals transduced by Gi or Gq and mediated via beta gamma or PKC, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1613040252,"Insulin treatment of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing high levels of the insulin receptor (CHO-IR) was found to markedly activate (10-20-fold) transcription of the luciferase reporter gene (Luc) driven by the serum response element (SRE) of the c-fos promoter. SRE-Luc expression was also strongly activated by co-transfection with expression plasmids encoding for either v-Ras or v-Raf. In contrast, insulin-stimulated SRE-Luc activity was inhibited by expression of a negative-dominant Ras (RasAsn-17)- or a negative-dominant Raf (p301-1)-encoding plasmid. Furthermore, the negative-dominant Raf mutant blocked v-Ras activation whereas the negative-dominant Ras mutant had no significant effect on v-Raf activation. Together, these data demonstrate that insulin utilizes the Ras and Raf signaling pathways and that Ras functions upstream of Raf in terms of transcriptional activation of the serum response element. To assess the role of the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase in this insulin signaling pathway, CHO-IR cells were co-transfected with the p85 regulatory subunit of the PI 3-kinase. Expression of the p85 subunit inhibited the insulin stimulation of SRE-Luc activity without affecting v-Ras or v-Raf activation. Thus, these data demonstrate that the PI 3-kinase is necessary for insulin signaling of transcriptional events and that, in a linear model of intracellular signaling, the PI 3-kinase functions upstream of both Ras and Raf."
https://openalex.org/W2020784937,"We studied the fusion of nuclear vesicles bound to chromatin in Xenopus egg extracts. Fusion was inhibited by 5 mM BAPTA, a Ca2+ buffer that suppresses cytosolic [Ca2+] gradients. The BAPTA-inhibited step in fusion was biochemically distinct from, and occurred later than, the GTP gamma S-sensitive step mediated by the monomeric GTPase, ADP-ribosylation factor. Exogenous inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), which triggers Ca2+ release from lumenal stores via IP3 receptors, stimulated fusion in the presence of BAPTA. This rescue was specific, because inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate had no effect. Heparin, a potent antagonist of IP3 receptors, independently blocked fusion in an IP3-reversible manner. We suggest that phosphoinositide signaling may regulate nuclear vesicle fusion."
https://openalex.org/W1615690166,"Thermococcus litoralis is a strictly anaerobic archaeon (archaebacterium) that grows at temperatures up to 98 degrees C by fermenting peptides. Its growth is stimulated by tungsten, and a tungsten-containing iron-sulfur protein that has formaldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase (FOR) activity has been purified. FOR is a homotetramer with a subunit M(r) of 70,000. It contains approximately four irons, four acid-labile sulfides, and one tungsten atom per subunit. The tungsten appears to be present as a pterin cofactor, and the Fe/S seems to comprise an unusual [4Fe-4S] cluster that in the reduced state exists in a pH-independent S = 3/2 form and a pH-dependent S = 1/2 form. FOR catalyzed the oxidation of C1-C3 aldehydes with a temperature optimum > or = 90 degrees C and used T. litoralis ferredoxin as an electron acceptor. It did not oxidize aldehyde phosphates, utilize CoASH, or reduce NAD(P). The N-terminal sequence of FOR shows homology with the tungsto-iron-sulfur aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase previously purified from the saccharolytic, hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus, in which it is proposed to function in a novel pyroglycolytic pathway (Mukund, S., and Adams, M. W. W. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 14208-14216). We show here that P. furiosus, which will also grow on peptides, albeit poorly, contains a second aldehyde-oxidizing enzyme analogous to FOR. Similarly, T. litoralis, which utilizes saccharides if limited for peptides, contains low concentrations of an enzyme analogous to AOR. It is proposed that formaldehyde (apparent Km, 62 mM) is not the true substrate for FOR; rather, the enzyme has an as yet unknown role in peptide fermentation in hyperthermophilic archaea."
https://openalex.org/W1647423442,"The ion-transporting H,K-ATPase and Na,K-ATPase enzymes are each composed of an alpha and a beta subunit. It is known that assembly of the alpha and beta subunits of the Na,K-ATPase is necessary for the cell-surface delivery of the active enzyme. We have examined the molecular domains involved in the assembly of the H,K-ATPase and Na,K-ATPase alpha and beta subunits by expressing individual subunits and subunit chimeras in transiently transfected COS-1 cells. Our results demonstrate that the H,K-ATPase alpha subunit requires its beta subunit for efficient cell-surface expression, as determined by indirect immunofluorescence. The H,K-ATPase beta protein appears to be able to get to the cell surface unaccompanied by any alpha subunit and appears to localize as well to a population of intracellular vesicles. We find that a transfected chimera encoding the NH2-terminal half of the H,K-ATPase alpha subunit and the COOH-terminal half of the Na,K-ATPase alpha subunit appears to assemble with the endogenous Na,K-ATPase beta subunit and to reach the plasmalemma. Transfection of the complementary alpha chimera requires coexpression with the H,K-ATPase beta subunit in order to attain surface delivery. Thus, it is the COOH-terminal half of the alpha subunit that specifies assembly with a particular beta subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1565803037,"An acidic protein was identified among the insoluble proteins of a growth cone-enriched fraction, and this protein was purified from the Triton- and high NaCl-insoluble fraction of newborn rat brain using several column chromatographies after solubilization at an alkaline condition. The purified protein showed a Ca(2+)-dependent calmodulin binding activity. This protein showed an anomalous behavior in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as that observed in case of GAP-43 (neuromodulin, F1, pp46, p57, B-50) and MARCKS (p87, p80), namely shifts of apparent molecular weights under different acrylamide concentrations. Its physicochemical characteristics, such as heat stability, acidic isoelectric point, and solubility in a 2.5% perchloric acid solution, also resemble the properties of these proteins. cDNA cloning of this protein showed that the NH2-terminal 50-amino acid sequence was almost identical to CAP-23, a previously reported chicken protein of unknown function. Since the COOH-terminal half-regions of these proteins are less similar, the entire sequences of these proteins have 65% homology (52% identity), suggesting that these proteins belong to a family. Immunoblotting of several tissue extracts using a monoclonal antibody against this protein showed its specific expression in brain."
https://openalex.org/W1997105657,"Female spotted hyenas exhibit male-like genitalia and dominance over males. Hyena ovarian tissues incubated in vitro produced large quantities of the steroid hormone precursor androstenedione. The activity of aromatase, which converts androstenedione to estrogen, was one-twentieth as great in hyena versus human placental homogenates. In comparison, the activity of 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, which converts androstenedione to testosterone, was equal in the two homogenates. The limited aromatase activity may allow the hyena placenta to convert high circulating concentrations of androstenedione to testosterone, which results in virilization of the fetal external genitalia and possibly destruction of fetal ovarian follicles. Androstenedione production by residual ovarian stromal cells during reproductive life accounts for the epigenetic transmission of virilization in female spotted hyenas."
https://openalex.org/W1518560879,"Stabilization of crossings of pairs of DNA helices by binding of eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase II was studied by two types of experiments. In one, mixtures of yeast DNA topoisomerase II and supercoiled DNA were incubated with vaccinia virus topoisomerase, and the linking numbers of the DNA products were measured to quantitate supercoils that were constrained by the stoichiometrically bound yeast enzyme molecules; in parallel, the same yeast enzyme-supercoiled DNA mixtures were incubated with a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMPPNP (adenosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imido)triphosphate) instead of the vaccinia enzyme, and DNA linking number changes following the addition of AMPPNP were measured to monitor DNA transport mediated by the yeast enzyme and AMPPNP. In the second type of experiments, formation of knotted DNA rings by the addition of AMPPNP to mixtures of yeast DNA topoisomerase II and different topological forms of DNA rings was studied. These experiments indicate that binding of yeast DNA topoisomerase II to DNA crossings is significant, especially in low salt media containing Mg(II), and that this mode of binding strongly affects DNA knotting. It appears, however, that stabilization of DNA crossovers by the eukaryotic type II enzyme is not directly related to its DNA transport activity."
https://openalex.org/W1552095151,"The hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) generates biological responses via both genomic and nongenomic mechanisms. This article addresses activity differences between the 6-s-trans (extended) and the 6-s-cis (steroid-like) conformation of 1,25-(OH)2D3 to initiate these responses. Because of facile interconversion of the 6-s-trans and 6-s-cis conformers of 1,25-(OH)2D3, kinetically competent amounts of both conformers exist to interact with any potential receptors for 1,25-(OH)2D3. We have chemically synthesized 1,25-(OH)2-9,14,19,19,19-pentadeuterio-pre-D3 (1,25-(OH)2-d5-pre-D3), an analog of the 6-s-cis conformation of 1,25-(OH)2D3. We found that 1,25-(OH)2-d5-pre-D3 and 1,25-(OH)2D3 were equivalently active in two nongenomic systems (transcaltachia as measured in the perfused chick intestine and 45Ca2+ uptake through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in ROS 17/2.8 cells). 1,25-(OH)2-d5-pre-D3 was significantly less active both in binding in vitro to the plasma vitamin D-binding protein (7%) and to the chick (10%) and pig (4%) intestinal nuclear 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptors generating genomic biological responses in vivo (induction of plasma levels of osteocalcin, < 5%) or in cultured cells (inhibition of HL-60 cell differentiation, < 5%; inhibition of MG-63 proliferation, < 2%; and induction of osteocalcin, < 2%). These results suggest that the genomic and nongenomic responses are mediated by separate receptors. Further, the 6-s-cis form (steroid-like conformation) of the natural hormone, 1,25-(OH)2D3, may be selectively responsible for its nongenomic function(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1564333207,"The peptide YFLLRNP antagonizes the aggregation of human platelets when induced by low concentrations of alpha-thrombin or the thrombin receptor agonist peptide (SFLLRNP), demonstrating that it interacts specifically with the thrombin receptor. Platelets exposed to YFLLRNP show immediate shape change (pseudopod formation) and potentiation of the ADP and platelet-activating factor response, but no Ca2+ mobilization, P47 (pleckstrin) phosphorylation, secretion, or aggregation. Thus, YFLLRNP induces a state of partial activation of the platelets. Furthermore, with platelets prestimulated with adrenalin (10 microM), YFLLRNP induces aggregation, but no secretion, and only in the presence of added fibrinogen. We also found that prostacyclin inhibits the YFLLRNP-induced shape change; but EDTA, aspirin, and apyrase (ADP scavenger) do not. Thus, the thrombin receptor in platelets may communicate, independently of Ca2+ mobilization and P47 phosphorylation (protein kinase C activation), with intracellular signaling mechanisms that 1) modulate the cytoskeleton structure, 2) potentiate other platelet responses, and 3) stimulate coupling between the thrombin receptor and fibrinogen binding (the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex). YFLLRNP may be useful for differentiating between several possible activation states of the platelet thrombin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W16550210,"The presence and functional role of the cyclic nucleotide signal transduction system was investigated in platelets from patients with myeloproliferative disorders. Platelets from certain patients with chronic myelocytic leukemia showed decreased expression of cGMP-dependent protein kinase, and platelets from two such patients were studied in some detail. These platelets had very little if any cGMP-dependent protein kinase but a normal level of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. They also contained a normal level of VASP (vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein, a specific substrate of both cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinase), as well as a functionally intact prostaglandin E1-stimulated cAMP-mediated VASP phosphorylation. In contrast, sodium nitroprusside-stimulated VASP phosphorylation was severely impaired in these cGMP-dependent protein kinase-deficient platelets, despite an exaggerated cGMP response to sodium nitroprusside. Furthermore, whereas selective activation of the cGMP-dependent protein kinase by 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cGMP strongly inhibited the ADP- or thrombin-evoked calcium mobilization from intracellular stores in normal platelets, this agonist-evoked calcium response was not inhibited by the cGMP analog in cGMP-dependent protein kinase-deficient platelets. The results demonstrate a defect in the nitrovasodilator-/cGMP-regulated signal transduction system in human platelets from some patients with myeloproliferative disorders, and underscore that a cGMP-dependent protein kinase regulatory system, distinct from that of cAMP-dependent protein kinase or other cGMP-dependent effectors is operative in normal human platelets."
https://openalex.org/W1491582597,"Human plasma or serum from donors of age comprised between 15 and 95 years was analyzed for paramagnetic and total copper content, as well as for immunoreactive ceruloplasmin content and oxidase activity. All parameters were essentially unaltered, except the paramagnetic copper content, which increased 2-fold upon aging. A dramatic change of the electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum due to ceruloplasmin occurred in individuals over 65 years and was associated with both an increase of the type 1 copper signal intensity and the appearance of new resonances of a type 2 copper species. Ceruloplasmin was isolated from either or donors. Spectroscopic analyses of the isolated proteins confirmed the tendency of type 1 copper to stay reduced in the young and oxidized in the old protein. The type 2 copper signal observed in most ceruloplasmin samples was different from the species invariably present in the protein. The magnetic parameters of the latter species were more consistent with a partially reduced trinuclear copper site. In vitro limited proteolysis resulted in identical fragmentation patterns and kinetics in both proteins. However, changes of the net electric charge were detected in the fragments of the protein isolated from aged individuals, which exhibited a carbonyl content of 0.6 mol of carbonyl/mol of protein. The same pattern of modifications, including a higher carbonyl content (0.65 versus 0.2 mol of carbonyl/mol of protein), could be reproduced by exposure of the protein to the metal-catalyzed oxidation system iron/ascorbate. These results suggest that during aging ceruloplasmin is subjected to oxidative modifications which are likely to be the source of conformational changes around the copper sites leading to an intramolecular electron rearrangement among the various copper sites."
https://openalex.org/W1517888291,"We have recently purified two potent and specific inhibitory polypeptides of protein phosphatase-1 from the particulate fraction of bovine thymus nuclei (Beullens, M., Van Eynde, A., Stalmans, W., and Bollen, M. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 16538-16544). Here it is reported that these inhibitors, termed NIPP-1a (18 kDa) and NIPP-1b (16 kDa), are excellent substrates (Km = 0.1 microM) for phosphorylation by protein kinase A on both Ser and Thr residues. Phosphorylation was temporally closely related with an activation of NIPP-1. Maximal phosphorylation by protein kinase A (1.5 mol of phosphate/mol of NIPP-1) caused an 8-fold increase in the concentration of NIPP-1 required for half-complete inhibition of the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase-1, irrespective of the concentration of the phosphatase. Phosphorylation decreased the binding of NIPP-1 to immobilized protein phosphatase-1. NIPP-1 could be efficiently and completely reactivated by incubation with the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase-2A. The type-1 catalytic subunit was much less effective, however, even when present in a molar excess to NIPP-1. Chromatography of a salt extract of the particulate nuclear fraction of Mono Q revealed three species of PP-1. One of these species, termed PP-1N alpha, contained NIPP-1 as a subunit and could be activated 6-fold by incubation with protein kinase A under phosphorylating conditions. This activation of PP-1N alpha is opposite to the known inhibition of cytoplasmic species of protein phosphatase-1 by protein kinase A."
https://openalex.org/W1508862796,"Incubation of the purified F1F0-ATPase of Propionigenium modestum with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) led to inactivation of the enzyme in a strongly pH-dependent manner. Rapid inactivation occurred at pH 5-7, while the increase of the pH from 7 to 9 resulted in a continuous reduction of the inactivation rate. In the presence of Na+ ions, the ATPase was specifically protected from inactivation by DCCD. The protective effect of Na+ was most pronounced at pH 9.0 and less significant at pH 7.0. In addition to Na+, Li+ also protected the ATPase from inactivation by DCCD, but approximately 10 times higher concentrations were required for the same effect. Similarly, the Na+ concentration causing half-maximal stimulation of ATPase activity was about 10 times below the Li+ concentration required for the same activation. It is concluded from these results that a binding site is present for Na+ or Li+ on the enzyme with an about 10 times lower affinity for the latter alkali ion, which when occupied stimulates ATPase activity and protects it from inactivation by DCCD. Inactivation of ATPase activity by DCCD correlated well with a specific labeling of subunit c of the enzyme in the presence of the [14C]DCCD derivative. Like ATPase inactivation, the labeling was promoted by more acidic pH values and inhibited by Na+ ions. We suggest from these data that the DCCD-reactive amino acid residue of subunit c (most likely Glu-65) must be protonated for the reaction with the carbodiimide and provides the Na(+)-binding site in its deprotonated state. Dissociation of the carboxylic acid (at high pH) and binding of Na+ ions to the carboxylate thus abolish the reactivity toward DCCD."
https://openalex.org/W1577153988,"The cDNA encoding the carboxyl-terminal 40-kDa domain of human poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase was inserted into an expression vector. The recombinant protein was overproduced in Escherichia coli, and purified to homogeneity. The 40-kDa domain had the same affinity (Km) for NAD+ as the full-length enzyme, expressed abortive NAD+ glycohydrolase activity, catalyzed the initiation, elongation, and branching of ADP-ribose polymers, but exhibited no DNA dependence. Its specific activity was approximately 500-fold lower than that of the whole enzyme activated by DNA strand breaks. Surprisingly, the carboxyl-terminal 40-kDa domain exhibited the processive mode of polymer attachment typical of full-length poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and was able to modify histones H1 and H2B. Finally, the polymer sizes formed by the 40-kDa domain were influenced by histone H1."
https://openalex.org/W1594838223,"We have examined as a function of pH the fidelity of DNA synthesis catalyzed by the 3'-->5' exonuclease-deficient form of the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. Increasing the pH of in vitro gap-filling reactions from pH 6.2 through 9.8 (37 degrees C increased the frequency of base substitution and minus-one-base frameshift mutations 50- and 40-fold, respectively, as measured by reversion of a nonsense or frameshift mutation within the lacZ alpha gene of bacteriophage M13mp2. To understand the mechanisms of high fidelity at low pH, we have examined the biochemical events associated with DNA synthesis at pH 6.2 that might be responsible for the observed accuracy in vitro. We show that while the steady-state frequency of T.dGTP misinsertion at the lacZ alpha opal codon is 20-fold lower at pH 6.2 than at pH 7.6, pH-dependent changes in the frequencies of G-dATP and A-dCTP base misinsertions at the lacZ alpha nonsense codon are insufficient to explain the fidelity changes observed in the gap-filling assay. However, the efficiency of steady-state extension synthesis from template-primers containing 3'-terminal T.G, G.A, and A.C (template-primer) mispairs was reduced up to 160-fold at pH 6.2 relative to pH 7.6. Analyses of the processivity of DNA polymerization versus pH demonstrated that at low pH the termination probability was decreased at specific template positions. Concomitantly, at sites where the termination probability was lower at pH 6.2, a decreased error rate was observed for base substitution mutations at three template positions and for minus-one-base frameshift mutations at two homopolymeric sequences relative to pH 7.6. We suggest that the observed increase in error discrimination by the exonuclease-deficient Klenow polymerase results from altered template binding properties of the enzyme at pH 6.2."
https://openalex.org/W1500142317,"Protein substrates for protein kinase C (PKC) have phosphorylation domains that are typically rich in the basic amino acids arginine and lysine. However, arginine-rich proteins may interact with PKC differently than lysine-rich proteins, i.e. lysine-rich histone requires phospholipid and Ca2+ to be phosphorylated, whereas the arginine-rich protein, protamine, can bypass these effector requirements. We have studied the interaction of PKC with protamine, histone, poly-L-arginine, and poly-L-lysine to better understand the role of basic protein domains in PKC activation, effector dependence, and substrate specificity. Using a microtiter binding assay, PKC was found to bind tightly to protamine and poly-L-arginine, but not to histone or poly-L-lysine, in the absence of phospholipid, Ca2+, and MgATP. Furthermore, poly-L-arginine was much more potent than poly-L-lysine at inhibiting protamine phosphorylation; i.e. 1-2 nM poly-L-arginine was sufficient to cause 50% inhibition of protamine phosphorylation, whereas over 300 microM poly-L-lysine was needed to reach 50% inhibition. Autophosphorylation of PKC in the absence of activators was potently stimulated by protamine and poly-L-arginine, but not by histone or poly-L-lysine, suggesting selective stimulation of PKC by arginine-rich polypeptides. Double-reciprocal plots of protamine phosphorylation using either a mixture of isozymes (alpha/beta/gamma) or isolated PKC-beta were parabolic, and analysis of the kinetic data on velocity/[protamine] versus velocity plots indicated positive cooperativity with respect to protamine. These findings are consistent with those from autophosphorylation experiments in that PKC appears to be selectively stimulated by arginine-rich polypeptides. These results suggest that PKC can preferentially bind arginine-rich proteins in the absence of phospholipid and Ca2+. This interaction appears to be distal to the catalytic site and thus binding of arginine-rich proteins may allosterically activate PKC. Selective stimulation of PKC by arginine-rich proteins may be a mechanism by which protamine can bypass activator requirements. Furthermore, control of PKC activity by activator-independent binding of arginine-rich polypeptides suggests that altering access to certain cellular proteins may be a mechanism for PKC regulation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1524137609,"Bulgarein, a fungal metabolite, induced mammalian topoisomerase I-mediated DNA cleavage in vitro. The cleavage activity of bulgarein was comparable to that of camptothecin at a drug concentration range of 0.025-approximately 5 microM. The DNA cleavage induced by bulgarein was suppressed at concentrations above 12.5 microM. Treatment of a reaction mixture containing bulgarein and topoisomerase I with elevated temperature (65 degrees C) resulted in a substantial reduction in DNA cleavage, suggesting that the topoisomerase I-mediated DNA cleavage induced by bulgarein is through the mechanism of stabilizing the reversible enzyme-DNA complex. Intensity of cleaved DNA fragments induced by bulgarein with topoisomerase I was different from that induced by camptothecin. Bulgarein inhibited catalytic activities of both topoisomerase I and topoisomerase II. The changes in absorption spectra of bulgarein in the visible region observed upon addition of increasing amounts of calf thymus DNA indicate that bulgarein interacts with DNA. DNA (un)winding assay by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that bulgarein induced the winding of DNA in the opposite direction to that of an intercalator so that positively supercoiled molecules are produced. Thus, bulgarein represents a new class of drugs which stabilizes the cleavable complex of topoisomerase I and alters the structure of DNA in a manner leading to a tightening of the helical twist."
https://openalex.org/W1980875222,"Individual dissociated supralateral radular tensor (SLT) muscle fibers were manipulated into contact with fura-2-filled neurites of presynaptic buccal motoneuron 19 from Helisoma in cell culture. Within 30 min of contact, action potential-evoked calcium accumulation was reversibly augmented from 228 ± 82 nM to 803 ± 212 nM, an action that was blocked by H-7 (40–100 KM). Calcium accumulation was not augmented when buccal motoneuron 19 contacted muscle or neuronal targets with which it does not form chemical synapses. Addition of pCPTcAMP (500 μM) to cultures reversibly enhanced calcium accumulation. Injection of IP20, a peptide inhibitor of CAMP-dependent protein kinase, prevented pCPT-cAMP and SILT muscle from enhancing calcium accumulation. These data demonstrate that SILT muscle target retrogradely regulates calcium accumulation in presynaptic nerve terminals by locally activating presynaptic cAMP-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2121002851,"To fully understand the mechanism of action of topoisomerase II-targeted agents, the effects of these drugs on the catalytic cycle of the enzyme must be well characterized. The present study utilized a nonturnover DNA catenation assay to determine the effects of several drugs (etoposide, genistein, CP-115,953, amsacrine, and novobiocin) on the DNA strand passage event mediated by topoisomerase II. With the exception of etoposide, all of the drugs inhibited the DNA strand passage step of the topoisomerase II catalytic cycle. A series of drug competition experiments that exploited this mechanistic difference was used to determine relationships between drug interaction domains on the enzyme. While the inclusion of etoposide in nonturnover DNA catenation assays reversed the inhibition of strand passage induced by genistein, CP-115,953, and amsacrine, it had no effect on the inhibition induced by novobiocin. These results strongly suggest that etoposide can displace other DNA cleavage-enhancing agents from the enzyme.DNA complex. Therefore, it is concluded that the interaction domain of etoposide overlaps those of several DNA cleavage-enhancing drugs but, consistent with previous observations (Robinson, M. J., Corbett, A. H., and Osheroff, N. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 3638-3643), is distinct from that of novobiocin."

https://openalex.org/W1573917099,"Abstract The two bombesin receptor subtypes, neuromedin B (NMB-R) and gastrin releasing peptide (GRP-R) receptors, bind their respective ligands with high affinity. To identify molecular components mediating high affinity NMB binding, four mutant receptors were constructed, in which different parts of the NMB-R were replaced with the corresponding regions of the GRP-R. When stably expressed in Balb 3T3 fibroblasts, all four NMB-R/GRP-R chimeras were functional and showed NMB-induced stimulation of inositol phosphate (IP) formation. Results of 125I-[D-Tyr0]NMB displacement assays using unlabeled NMB for competition indicated that high affinity NMB binding was determined by amino acid sequences in transmembrane domain V (TM-V) of the NMB-R. To identify which amino acid(s) in TM-V of NMB-R contributed to high affinity NMB binding, four additional NMB-R mutants were constructed where non-conserved amino acids in TM-V of NMB-R were replaced by the corresponding GRP-R amino acids. Three of the mutations, TyrPheLeu220-222-->PheTyrVal, Ile230-->Val, and His234-->Phe, did not affect high affinity NMB binding. The Ile216-->Ser substitution, however, abolished high affinity NMB binding and severely impaired the ability of the mutant receptor to stimulate NMB-dependent inositol phosphate formation. These results suggest that ILe216 in TM-V of NMB-R may be critical for high affinity NMB binding."
https://openalex.org/W1998651839,"The phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase promoter directs the expression of the SV40 T antigen to subsets of amacrine and horizontal neurons of the retina in a line of transgenic mice. T antigen expression begins in these cells during the first postnatal week. The horizontal cells appear to develop normally for another week but then begin to die. Subsequently, most of the horizontal cells disappear from the central and mid retina, resulting in loss of the outer plexiform layer and absence of ribbon synapses between the photoreceptors and bipolar cells. Neuronal transformation occurs only in the peripheral retina. These experiments indicate that horizontal neurons are heterogeneous with respect to susceptibility to transformation and that T antigen expression in a subset of horizontal neurons can be a direct cause of neuronal cell death. Furthermore, critical interdependencies exist between horizontal neurons after retinal neurogenesis is complete."
https://openalex.org/W1624615196,"We examined how 5-hydroxyicosatetraenoate (5-HETE) activates human neutrophils (PMN). 5-HETE stimulates PMN to mobilize Ca2+ but has little effect on degranulation or superoxide anion production. It nonetheless stereospecifically induced these responses in cells primed with tumor necrosis factor-alpha and likewise induced PMN plasma membranes to bind 35S-labeled guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) and phosphohydrolyze [gamma-32P]GTP. Pertussis toxin blocked GTP gamma S binding responses. Scatchard analyses of GTP gamma S binding data indicated that 5-HETE raised the Ka of high affinity GTP gamma S binding sites without altering these sites' numbers or the parameters of low affinity GTP gamma S binding. Since N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe, platelet-activating factor, and leukotriene (LT) B4 have these same bioactions, receptors for the latter agents might mediate responses to 5-HETE. However, 5-HETE desensitized degranulation responses to itself but not to the receptor agonists, the receptor agonists desensitized to themselves but not 5-HETE, and a LTB4 antagonist inhibited LTB4 but not 5-HETE in all assays. Finally, PMN and their membranes took up [3H] 5-HETE at 4 or 37 degrees C but, at both temperatures, also acylated the radiolabel into glycerolipids. Acylation nullified assessment of 5-HETE binding and questions reports that measure the cell binding, but not metabolism, of various HETEs. Our studies thus indicate 5-HETE acts by a down-regulatable, G protein-linked mechanism and represent the best available evidence that 5-HETE does not operate through, for example, LTB4 receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1577119171,"The rate of reaction and the stoichiometry of binding between gelsolin and actin monomers depends on adenine nucleotides. In the presence of Ca2+ but not Mg2+, gelsolin retains the ability to sever actin filaments when incubated for more than 20 min with an excess of G-actin in the presence of ATP but loses severing activity within seconds when mixed with G-actin in ADP. Immunoprecipitation of gelsolin removes more actin from ADP than from ATP solutions. Monomeric ATP-actin in 2 mM MgCl2 and 150 mM KCl slowly destroys the filament-severing activity of gelsolin with kinetics that are first order in actin concentration and with an apparent bimolecular rate constant of 0.021 +/- 0.007 microM-1 s-1. Coincident with the slow complex formation in MgCl2, the actin bound to the calcium-sensitive actin binding domain of gelsolin hydrolyzes its ATP to ADP. These results suggest a further level of gelsolin regulation and a functional similarity between actin and GTP-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1588742331,"D1 dopamine receptors stimulate cAMP accumulation in opossum kidney (OK) cells, but this response is attenuated by pretreatment with dopamine. Dopamine pretreatment also causes a reduction in D1 dopamine receptor number. We transfected OK cells with a rat cAMP phosphodiesterase cDNA (rPDE3) in order to determine the contribution of elevations of cAMP to those two phenomena. Wild-type (WT) OK cells were compared to three clones (C, H, and N) which demonstrated stable expression of the rPDE3 phenotype and genotype, rPDE3 RNA expression was confirmed in clones C, H, and N (but not in WT-OK cells) by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. A functional rPDE3 phenotype was demonstrated in that dopamine-responsive cAMP accumulation was absent in clones C, H, and N in intact cells, but could be restored by preincubation with cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitors, or by using washed membranes from those clones. All three clones had increased cAMP phosphodiesterase activity when compared to WT-OK cells (approximately 100% increase), and blunted or absent dopamine (1 microM)-induced protein kinase A activation. After pretreatment with dopamine (1 microM) for 1 h, clones C, H, and N desensitized equally well as WT-OK cells (approximately 40-50% reduction in maximal increase in cAMP). In contrast, down-regulation of D1 dopamine receptors was blunted for clone C (20% receptor loss) and absent for clones H and N, when compared to a 45% loss of receptors for WT-OK cells. These findings suggest that in OK cells pretreated with 1 microM dopamine (i) cAMP accumulation is not necessary for dopamine-induced desensitization, but (ii) is necessary for down-regulation of D1 dopamine receptors, and (iii) that the down-regulation and desensitization processes may be differentially regulated."

Assay of CAT expression dependent on restriction fragments isolated from genomic clones indicated that the fragments located on introns 7 and 9 enhanced the expression. Methylation interference experiments showed that the guanine residues in a consensus sequence of an estrogen response element in the intron 7 fragment interacted with a nuclear factor. Gel retardation analysis indicated that this interaction of the intron 7 fragment with the nuclear factor was specifically inhibited by an oligodeoxynucleotide containing the 21-base pair (bp) estrogen response element. DNase I footprint analysis revealed that a 36-bp-specific sequence of the intron 9 fragment was protected from DNase I by nuclear extracts. This sequence contained a palindromic sequence consisting of the conserved half-motif of an estrogen response element with 5-bp spacing. The interaction of the intron 9 fragment with the nuclear extracts was specifically inhibited by an oligodeoxynucleotide of the 36-bp sequence. Furthermore, the 21- and 36-bp oligodeoxynucleotides in the constructs enhanced CAT expression in the cells. These results suggest that these elements in introns 7 and 9 are involved in expression of the myeloperoxidase gene."

https://openalex.org/W1671692014,"A mutant of Escherichia coli F1-ATPase (ECF1) in which the serine residue in position 8 of the gamma subunit has been replaced by a cysteine residue (gamma S8C) has been used to study nucleotide-dependent cross-linking of the gamma subunit to a beta subunit. When examined in the presence of ADP+Mg2+, either supplied directly or as produced during catalytic turnover of ATP+Mg2+, the main cross-linked product generated using the heterobifunctional, photoactivatable, cross-linker tetrafluorophenylazide maleimide-6 had a M(r)(app) of 108,000. When ATP hydrolysis was inhibited, either by cold or by reaction with sodium azide, or when ATP hydrolysis was prevented by the use of adenyl-5'-yl beta,gamma-imidodiphosphate, the main cross-linked products were species with M(r)(app) of 102,000 and 84,000. The nucleotide-dependent switching from one cross-linking pattern to another could only be observed when the epsilon subunit was bound to ECF1; it was not seen in ECF1*, an enzyme preparation missing delta and epsilon subunits, but was observed in preparations selectively depleted of the delta subunit. We conclude that the changes detected in these cross-linking experiments are occurring during the hydrolysis of ATP when the beta-gamma phosphate bond is cleaved and that they are related to the coupling of ATP hydrolysis to proton translocation."
https://openalex.org/W1501401597,"Alterations in the amino acid composition, phosphorylation pattern, or intracellular levels of topoisomerase II have been associated with resistance to antineoplastic agents whose effects are mediated through interactions with this enzyme. To develop a model system with which to investigate the determinants of topoisomerase II sensitivity or resistance to antineoplastic agents that target this enzyme, a cDNA encoding the wild-type Drosophila melanogaster topoisomerase II was ligated into a mammalian expression vector containing a glucocorticoid-inducible mouse mammary tumor virus promoter and transfected into an epipodophyllotoxin-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cell line (VPM(r)-5). In two transfectants carrying an intact, full-length Drosophila topoisomerase II cDNA, exposure to the inducing agent, dexamethasone (10 microM), resulted in complementation of the endogenous mutant topoisomerase II and phenotypic reversion to etoposide sensitivity. In the presence of glucocorticoid, etoposide-induced cytotoxicity increased 20-fold, despite the fact that Drosophila topoisomerase II mRNA expression was only 0.1% of that of the endogenous mammalian topoisomerase II. Induced cells demonstrated a marked increase in DNA single strand breaks compared with uninduced resistant cells, thereby providing biochemical evidence supporting increased DNA strand cleavage due to activation of the Drosophila enzyme. These observations demonstrate the ability of a wild-type Drosophila topoisomerase II to complement a mutant mammalian enzyme and suggest that transfectants capable of conditional topoisomerase II expression represent a useful model for studies of the biochemical pharmacology and structure-function relationships of normal and mutant enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1507418244,"The fourth calcium-binding domain (domain IV) of the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) calmodulin is unable to bind Ca2+ (Matsuura, I., Ishihara, K., Nakai, Y., Yazawa, M., Toda, H., and Yagi, K. (1991) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 109, 190-197). The functional significance of Ca2+ binding to domain IV was investigated by site-directed mutagenesis or recombinant DNA techniques. A recognition site for the restriction enzyme ClaI was introduced at the homologous position of Ile130 in the nucleotide sequence of chicken and yeast calmodulin cDNA, and chimeric proteins of the yeast and the vertebrate calmodulin were prepared. One of the resulting mutants named C4Y consisted of Ala1-Ile130 of chicken calmodulin and Asp131-Lys148 of yeast calmodulin. The mutant C4Y showed the yeast-type feature, and its enzyme activation profiles were similar to those of yeast calmodulin. A single substitution of Glu for Gln140 was carried out in the mutant C4Y. The resulting mutant (C4Y140E) bound 4 mol of Ca2+ and showed the vertebrate-type enzyme activation. Therefore, the alterations of 3 residues in the Ca(2+)-binding loop of the yeast-type domain IV, Ser129–>Asp, insertion of Ile130, and Gln140–>Glu, were enough for the recovery of Ca2+ binding and enzyme activation. Ca2+ binding to domain IV may induce the active conformation of the C-terminal half-molecular domain."
https://openalex.org/W1510156235,"Abstract By high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis, the occurrence of radiolabeled 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides has been well documented in several cell systems, including agonist-stimulated platelets. The actual mass amounts and fatty acid composition of these unique lipids, however, have not been reported to date. In the present study, we report the mass and fatty acid composition of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3,4-P2 from U46619-stimulated platelets using a thin-layer chromatographic system for the separation of PI 3,4-P2 from PI 4,5-P2. The mass of PI 3,4-P2 in the stimulated platelet was 180 +/- 9.7 pmol/1 x 10(9) platelets (mean +/- S.E., n = 4), representing 9.3% of total phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2). Based on HPLC analysis, PI 3,4-P2 in unstimulated platelets represented < 0.5% of total PIP2 (which corresponds to < 7.0 pmol/1 x 10(9) platelets). Fatty acid analysis of this lipid revealed a composition very similar to the conventional polyphosphoinositides (stearic and arachidonic acids accounting for 44.2 and 40.4 mol %, respectively, of the fatty acids). Since PI 3,4-P2 also did not appear to be distinct from the other polyphosphoinositides, in regard to radiolabeling properties, it was concluded that this lipid is unlikely to originate from a unique precursor pool. This conclusion validates the use of HPLC analysis of radiolabeled phosphoinositides for the estimation of PI 3,4-P2 mass in agonist-stimulated platelets. The chromatographic procedure described should prove useful for the mass and fatty acid analysis of PI 3,4-P2 from other cell systems."
https://openalex.org/W1561476831,"DnaA5 protein, inactive in replication systems dependent on purified enzymes, was activated by addition of a crude enzyme fraction. Based on this assay, two proteins in the crude enzyme fraction were identified that confer replication activity upon DnaA5 protein in a purified enzyme system. That one is DnaK protein was suggested initially from studies in which DnaK protein stimulated another mutant form of DnaA protein in replication assays dependent on a crude enzyme fraction (Hwang, D. S., and Kaguni, J. M. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 7537-7555). The identification of DnaK protein as a required protein for activation of DnaA5 protein, and its inclusion in a reconstituted enzyme system of purified replication proteins, allowed for the partial purification of the second activating protein. GrpE protein was deduced to be the second activating protein based on three criteria. First, activity in partially purified fractions correlated with a protein similar in size to GrpE protein on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel. Second, activity in partially purified fractions correlated with a protein that reacted with anti-GrpE antibody. Third, purified GrpE protein functionally replaced the second protein in activation of DnaA5 protein."
