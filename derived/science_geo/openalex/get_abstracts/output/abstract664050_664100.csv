https://openalex.org/W3108244190,"Objective The COVID-19 pandemic is more than a public health crisis. Lockdown measures have substantial societal effects, including a significant impact on parents with (young) children. Given the existence of persistent gender inequality prior to the pandemic, particularly among parents, it is crucial to study the societal impact of COVID-19 from a gender perspective. The objective of this paper is to use representative survey data gathered among Dutch parents in April 2020 to explore differences between mothers and fathers in three areas: paid work, the division of childcare and household tasks, and three dimensions of quality of life (leisure, work-life balance, relationship dynamics). Additionally, we explore whether changes take place in these dimensions by comparing the situation prior to the lockdown with the situation during the lockdown. Method We use descriptive methods (crosstabulations) supported by multivariate modelling (linear regression modelling for continuous outcomes; linear probability modelling (LPM) for binary outcomes (0/1 outcomes); and multinomial logits for multinomial outcomes) in a cross-sectional survey design. Results Results show that the way in which parents were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic reflects a complex gendered reality. Mothers work in essential occupations more often than fathers, report more adjustments of the times at which they work, and experience both more and less work pressure in comparison to before the lockdown. Moreover, mothers continue to do more childcare and household work than fathers, but some fathers report taking on greater shares of childcare and housework during the lockdown in comparison to before. Mothers also report a larger decline in leisure time than fathers. We find no gender differences in the propensity to work from home, in perceived work-life balance, or in relationship dynamics. Conclusion In conclusion, we find that gender inequality in paid work, the division of childcare and household work, and the quality of life are evident during the first lockdown period. Specifically, we find evidence of an increase in gender inequality in relation to paid work and quality of life when comparing the situation prior to and during the lockdown, as well as a decrease in gender inequality in the division of childcare and household work. We conclude that the unique situation created by restrictive lockdown measures magnifies some gender inequalities while lessening others. Discussion The insights we provide offer key comparative evidence based on a representative, probability-based sample for understanding the broader impact of lockdown measures as we move forward in the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the limitations in this study is the cross-sectional design. Further study, in the form of a longitudinal design, will be crucial in investigating the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on gender inequality."
https://openalex.org/W3109904938,"The current global threat brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic has led to widespread social isolation, posing new challenges in dealing with metal suffering related to social distancing, and in quickly learning new social habits intended to prevent contagion. Neuroscience and psychology agree that dreaming helps people to cope with negative emotions and to learn from experience, but can dreaming effectively reveal mental suffering and changes in social behavior? To address this question, we applied natural language processing tools to study 239 dream reports by 67 individuals, made either before the Covid-19 outbreak or during the months of March and April, 2020, when lockdown was imposed in Brazil following the WHO’s declaration of the pandemic. Pandemic dreams showed a higher proportion of anger and sadness words, and higher average semantic similarities to the terms “contamination” and “cleanness”. These features seem to be associated with mental suffering linked to social isolation, as they explained 40% of the variance in the PANSS negative subscale related to socialization (p = 0.0088). These results corroborate the hypothesis that pandemic dreams reflect mental suffering, fear of contagion, and important changes in daily habits that directly impact socialization."
https://openalex.org/W3109099192,"We examined how the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of 6,957 students from Germany, assessed between March 16 and April 21, 2020, when COVID-19 became a serious health concern in Germany, varied by personality. The Big Five personality traits—openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and emotional stability—were assessed with the International Personality Item Pool. Students were asked whether they kept up with the COVID-19 news, followed specific governmental rules and recommendations (washing hands more, using public transport less, avoiding larger crowds, and restricting meetings with family/friends), hoarded supplies, felt less secure in public places, or expected financial losses due to the crisis. Logistic regressions adjusted for sociodemographic factors and cognitive abilities revealed that more conscientious (odds ratio (OR) = 1.133) and more agreeable (OR = 1.285) students kept up with the news more. More agreeable students were also more likely to wash their hands more often/intensively (OR = 1.262), use public transport less (OR = 1.182), avoid crowds (OR = 1.320), and restrict meetings with family/friends (OR = 1.410). Other Big Five traits were not associated with these behaviors, except that less emotionally stable individuals tended to use public transport less often (OR = 1.162). Additionally, less emotionally stable students, in particular, more often bought more supplies than usual (OR = 1.322), felt insecure in public spaces (OR = 1.597), and expected financial losses (OR = 1.270). Moreover, less open (OR = 0.876) and more conscientious (OR = 1.235) students more often felt insecure in public spaces, and more extraverted individuals more often expected financial losses (OR = 1.180). Taken together, our findings suggest that more agreeable individuals, in particular, tend to comply with governmental rules and recommendations to fight COVID-19, whereas less emotionally stable individuals, in particular, tend to hoard supplies, feel insecure, and fear financial losses due to the crisis."
https://openalex.org/W3108863824,"Background The endeavor to tackle the spread of COVID-19 effectively remains futile without the right grasp of perceptions and beliefs presiding in the community. Therefore, this study aimed to assess myths, beliefs, perceptions, and information gaps about COVID-19 in Ethiopia. Methods An internet-based survey was conducted in Ethiopia from April 22 to May 04, 2020. The survey link was promoted through emails, social media, and the Jimma University website. Perceptions about COVID-19 have considered the World Health Organization (WHO) resources and local beliefs. The data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software version 20.0. Classifications and lists of factors for each thematic perception of facilitators, inhibitors, and information needs were generated. Explanatory factor analysis (EFA) was executed to assist categorizations. Standardized mean scores of the categories were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and t-tests. A significant difference was claimed at p-value &lt;0.05. Results A total of 929 responses were gathered during the study period. The EFA generated two main categories of perceived facilitators of COVID-19 spread: behavioral non-adherence (55.9%) and lack of enablers (86.5%). Behavioral non-adherence was illustrated by fear of stigma (62.9%), not seeking care (59.3%), and hugging and shaking (44.8%). Perceived lack of enablers of precautionary measures includes staying home impossible due to economic challenges (92.4%), overcrowding (87.6%), and inaccessible face masks (81.6%) and hand sanitizers (79.1%). Perceived inhibitors were categorized into three factors: two misperceived, myths (31.6%) and false assurances (32.9%), and one correctly identified; engagement in standard precautions (17.1%). Myths about protection from the virus involve perceived religiosity and effectiveness of selected food items, hot weather, traditional medicine, and alcohol drinking, ranging from 15.1% to 54.7%. False assurances include people’s perception that they were living far away from areas where COVID-19 was rampant (36.9%), and no locally reported cases were present (29.5%). There were tremendous information needs reported about COVID-19 concerning protection methods (62.6%), illness behavior and treatment (59.5%), and quality information, including responses to key unanswered questions such as the origin of the virus (2.4%). Health workers were perceived as the most at-risk group (83.3%). The children, adolescents, youths were marked at low to moderate (45.1%-62.2%) risk of COVID-19. Regional, township, and access to communication showed significant variations in myths, false assurances, and information needs (p &lt;0.05). Conclusions Considering young population as being at low risk of COVID-19 would be challenging to the control efforts, and needs special attention. Risk communication and community engagement efforts should consider regional and township variations of myths and false assurances. It should also need to satisfy information needs, design local initiatives that enhance community ownership of the control of the virus, and thereby support engagement in standard precautionary measures. All forms of media should be properly used and regulated to disseminate credible information while filtering out myths and falsehoods."
https://openalex.org/W3106809855,"Objectives To evaluate the progression of the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the pregnant population of the south of Madrid during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondarily we aimed to evaluate maternal and perinatal outcomes. Study design Retrospective cohort study conducted at Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre during weeks 10 to 19 of 2020, coinciding with the Spanish lockdown. We tested 769 serum samples obtained from routine serological testing during the first and third trimesters of pregnancy for specific IgG anti SARS-CoV-2 RBD and S proteins. RT-PCR tests were performed in suspected cases according to clinical practice. We compared maternal and perinatal outcomes in those with delivered pregnancies (n = 578) according to the presence or absence of specific IgG antibodies. Those with positive IgG were subdivided by the presence or absence of Covid-19 related symptoms at any time and the results of RT-PCR testing if performed. Therefore, we had 4 study groups: G1 (IgG negative), G2 (IgG positive, asymptomatic, RT-PCR testing negative or not done), G3 (IgG positive, symptomatic, RT-PCR testing negative or not done), and G4 (IgG positive, symptomatic, RT-PCR positive). Results Seropositivity increased from 0% to 21.4% (95% CI 11.8–31.0) during the study period, of which 27.9% had an asymptomatic course. Overall outcomes were favorable with a significant increased rate of preterm birth in G4 vs G1 (21.4% vs 6.7%) and cesarean/operative delivery (50% vs 26.9%). Asymptomatic and mild cases did not have differences regarding pregnancy course when compared to seronegative women. There were no documented cases of vertical or horizontal transmission. Conclusion Seroprevalence in pregnant women in southern Madrid went up to 21.4% of which 27.9% had an asymptomatic course. Overall perinatal results were favorable, especially in those asymptomatic."
https://openalex.org/W3110621799,"Objectives Forecasting epidemics like COVID-19 is of crucial importance, it will not only help the governments but also, the medical practitioners to know the future trajectory of the spread, which might help them with the best possible treatments, precautionary measures and protections. In this study, the popular autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) will be used to forecast the cumulative number of confirmed, recovered cases, and the number of deaths in Pakistan from COVID-19 spanning June 25, 2020 to July 04, 2020 (10 days ahead forecast). Methods To meet the desire objectives, data for this study have been taken from the Ministry of National Health Service of Pakistan’s website from February 27, 2020 to June 24, 2020. Two different ARIMA models will be used to obtain the next 10 days ahead point and 95% interval forecast of the cumulative confirmed cases, recovered cases, and deaths. Statistical software, RStudio, with “forecast”, “ggplot2”, “tseries”, and “seasonal” packages have been used for data analysis. Results The forecasted cumulative confirmed cases, recovered, and the number of deaths up to July 04, 2020 are 231239 with a 95% prediction interval of (219648, 242832), 111616 with a prediction interval of (101063, 122168), and 5043 with a 95% prediction interval of (4791, 5295) respectively. Statistical measures i.e. root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are used for model accuracy. It is evident from the analysis results that the ARIMA and seasonal ARIMA model is better than the other time series models in terms of forecasting accuracy and hence recommended to be used for forecasting epidemics like COVID-19. Conclusion It is concluded from this study that the forecasting accuracy of ARIMA models in terms of RMSE, and MAE are better than the other time series models, and therefore could be considered a good forecasting tool in forecasting the spread, recoveries, and deaths from the current outbreak of COVID-19. Besides, this study can also help the decision-makers in developing short-term strategies with regards to the current number of disease occurrences until an appropriate medication is developed."
https://openalex.org/W3106587211,"Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most commonly diagnosed psychological disorder of childhood. Medication and cognitive behavioral therapy are effective treatments for many children; however, adherence to medication and therapy regimens is low. Thus, identifying effective adjunct treatments is imperative. Previous studies exploring computerized training programs as supplementary treatments have targeted working memory or attention. However, many lines of research suggest inhibitory control (IC) plays a central role in ADHD pathophysiology, which makes IC a potential intervention target. In this randomized control trial (NCT03363568), we target IC using a modified stop-signal task (SST) training designed by NeuroScouting, LLC in 40 children with ADHD, aged 8 to 11 years. Children were randomly assigned to adaptive treatment (n = 20) or non-adaptive control (n = 20) with identical stimuli and task goals. Children trained at home for at least 5 days a week (about 15m/day) for 4-weeks. Relative to the control group, the treatment group showed decreased relative theta power in resting EEG and trending improvements in parent ratings of attention (i.e. decreases in inattentive behaviors). Both groups showed improved SST performance. There was not evidence for treatment effects on hyperactivity or teacher ratings of symptoms. Results suggest training IC alone has potential to positively impact symptoms of ADHD and provide evidence for neural underpinnings of this impact (change in theta power; change in N200 latency). This shows promising initial results for the use of computerized training of IC in children with ADHD as a potential adjunct treatment option for children with ADHD."
https://openalex.org/W3107192860,"The Western corn rootworm (WCR) Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte is one of the most economically important insect pests in North America. Since 2003, transgenic maize expressing WCR-active proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis ( Bt ) have been widely adopted as the main approach to controlling WCR in the U.S. However, the emergence of field resistance to the Bt proteins in current commercial products has been documented in recent years, highlighting the need to develop additional tools for controlling this devasting pest. Here we report the discovery of Vpb4Da2 (initially assigned as Vip4Da2), a new insecticidal protein highly selective against WCR, through high-throughput genome sequencing of a Bt strain sourced from grain dust samples collected in the eastern and central regions of the US. Vpb4Da2 contains a sequence and domain signature distinct from families of other WCR-active proteins. Under field conditions, transgenic maize expressing Vpb4Da2 demonstrates commercial-level (at or below NIS 0.25) root protection against WCR, and reduces WCR beetle emergence by ≥ 97%. Our studies also conclude that Vpb4Da2 controls WCR populations that are resistant to WCR-active transgenic maize expressing Cry3Bb1, Cry34Ab1/Cry35Ab1 (reassigned as Gpp34Ab1/Tpp35Ab1), or DvSnf7 RNA. Based on these findings, Vpb4Da2 represents a valuable new tool for protecting maize against WCR."
https://openalex.org/W3107349343,"Objective Eating self-efficacy behavior is an important predictor of successful lifestyle intervention. This secondary analysis evaluated the changes in eating self-efficacy behavior in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and overweight/obesity following structured lifestyle intervention based on the Malaysian customized transcultural Diabetes Nutrition Algorithm (tDNA). Methods Patients with T2D and overweight/obesity (n = 230) were randomized either into the tDNA group which included a structured low-calorie meal plan using normal foods, incorporation of diabetes-specific meal replacements, and an exercise prescription or usual T2D care (UC) for 6 months. Patients in the tDNA group also received either counseling with motivational interviewing (tDNA-MI) or conventional counseling (tDNA-CC). The UC group received standard dietary and exercise advice using conventional counseling. Eating self-efficacy was assessed using a locally validated Weight Efficacy Lifestyle (WEL) questionnaire. All patients were followed up for additional 6 months’ post-intervention. Results There was a significant change in WEL scores with intervention over one-year [Group X Time effect: F = 51.4, df = (3.4, 318.7), p&lt;0.001]. Compared to baseline, WEL scores improved in both the tDNA groups with significantly higher improvement in the tDNA-MI group compared to the tDNA-CC and UC groups at 6 months (tDNA-MI: 25.4±2.1 vs. tDNA-CC: 12.9±2.8 vs. UC: -6.9±1.9, p&lt;0.001). At 12 months’ follow-up, both the tDNA groups maintained improvement in the WEL scores, with significantly higher scores in the tDNA-MI group than tDNA-CC group, and the UC group had decreased WEL scores (tDNA-MI: 28.9±3.1 vs. tDNA-CC: 11.6±3.6 vs. UC: -13.2±2.1, p&lt;0.001). Patients in the tDNA-MI group with greater weight loss and hemoglobin A1C reduction also had a higher eating self-efficacy, with a similar trend observed in comparative groups. Conclusion Eating self-efficacy improved in patients with T2D and overweight/obesity who maintained their weight loss and glycemic control following a structured lifestyle intervention based on the Malaysian customized tDNA and the improvement was further enhanced with motivational interviewing.

https://openalex.org/W3108427840,"Objectives The study examined the prevalence, sociodemographic, and clinical correlates of chronic pain among primary care patients in the state of Kerala, India. It also examined the patterns and relationships of chronic physical and mental health conditions with chronic pain. Methods This study is a cross-sectional survey conducted among 7165 adult patients selected randomly by a multi-stage stratified design from 71 primary health centers. The questionnaires administered included Chronic pain screening questionnaire, self-reported Chronic physical health condition checklist, Patient Health Questionnaire-SADS, The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence, WHO Disability Assessment Schedule and WHOQOL- BREF for Quality/Satisfaction with Life. The prevalence and comorbid patterns of chronic pain were determined. Logistic regression analysis and generalized linear mixed-effects model was employed to examine the relationship of chronic pain to socio-demographic variables and examined physical and mental health conditions. Results A total of 1831 (27%) patients reported chronic pain. Among those with chronic pain, 28.3% reported no co-occurring chronic mental or physical illness, 35.3% reported one, and 36.3% reported multi-morbidity. In the multivariate analysis, patients with chronic pain when compared to those without had higher odds of being older, female, having lower education, not living with their family, greater disability, and poor satisfaction with life. Chronic pain was independently associated with both medical (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tuberculosis, arthritis, and other medical illnesses) and mental health conditions (depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and tobacco dependence). It showed a varying strength of association and additive effect with increasing number of co-occurring physical and mental illnesses. Conclusions Chronic pain is a common condition among primary care attendees associated with significant burden of medical and mental health comorbidity. The findings highlight the need to incorporate treatment models that will ensure appropriate management to improve outcomes within the resource constraints."
https://openalex.org/W3109272883,"Candidiasis causes high morbidity and mortality among immunocompromised patients. Antifungal drug resistance and cytotoxicity highlight the need of effective antifungal therapeutics. In this study, we found that kalopanaxsaponin A (KPA), a triterpenoid saponin natural product, could inhibit the proliferation of various Candida species, and exerted a fungicidal effect against C . albicans . To further explore its antifungal action mode, spectrofluorophotometer, fluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy were performed, showing that KPA treatment induced the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction. Meanwhile, KPA treatment also broke down the membrane barrier of C . albicans causing the leakage of intracellular trehalose, the entrance of extracellular impermeable substance and the decrease of ergosterol content. Both ROS accumulation and membrane destruction contributed to the death of C . albicans cells. Our work preliminarily elucidated the potential mechanisms of KPA against C . albicans on a cellular level, and might provide a potential option for the treatment of clinical candidiasis."
https://openalex.org/W3107031816,"Objective To assess the improvement in the management of diabetes and its complications based on the evolution of hospitalisation rates for diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) and lower extremity amputation (LEA) in individuals with diabetes in France. Methods Data were provided by the French national health insurance general scheme from 2008 to 2014. Hospitalisations for DFU and LEA were extracted from the SNIIRAM/SNDS French medical and administrative database. Results In 2014, 22,347 hospitalisations for DFU and 8,342 hospitalisations for LEA in patients with diabetes were recorded. Between 2008 and 2014, the standardised rate of hospitalisation for DFU raised from 508 to 701/100,000 patients with diabetes. In the same period, the standardised rate of LEA decreased from 301 to 262/100,000 patients with diabetes. The level of amputation tended to become more distal. The proportion of men (69% versus 73%) and the frequency of revascularization procedures (39% versus 46%) increased. In 2013, the one-year mortality rate was 23% after hospitalisation for DFU and 26% after hospitalisation for LEA. Conclusions For the first time in France, the incidence of a serious complication of diabetes, i.e. amputations, has decreased in relation with a marked improvement in hospital management."
https://openalex.org/W3108330898,"3D printing is a rapidly evolving field for biological (bioprinting) and non-biological applications. Due to a high degree of freedom for geometrical parameters in 3D printing, prototype printing of bioreactors is a promising approach in the field of Tissue Engineering. The variety of printers, materials, printing parameters and device settings is difficult to overview both for beginners as well as for most professionals. In order to address this problem, we designed a guidance including test bodies to elucidate the real printing performance for a given printer system. Therefore, performance parameters such as accuracy or mechanical stability of the test bodies are systematically analysed. Moreover, post processing steps such as sterilisation or cleaning are considered in the test procedure. The guidance presented here is also applicable to optimise the printer settings for a given printer device. As proof of concept, we compared fused filament fabrication, stereolithography and selective laser sintering as the three most used printing methods. We determined fused filament fabrication printing as the most economical solution, while stereolithography is most accurate and features the highest surface quality. Finally, we tested the applicability of our guidance by identifying a printer solution to manufacture a complex bioreactor for a perfused tissue construct. Due to its design, the manufacture via subtractive mechanical methods would be 21-fold more expensive than additive manufacturing and therefore, would result in three times the number of parts to be assembled subsequently. Using this bioreactor we showed a successful 14-day-culture of a biofabricated collagen-based tissue construct containing human dermal fibroblasts as the stromal part and a perfusable central channel with human microvascular endothelial cells. Our study indicates how the full potential of biofabrication can be exploited, as most printed tissues exhibit individual shapes and require storage under physiological conditions, after the bioprinting process."
https://openalex.org/W3109259326,"Acute gastroenteritis is one of the major health problems in children aged &lt;5 years around the world. Rotavirus A (RVA) is an important pathogen of acute gastroenteritis. The burden of rotavirus disease in the pediatric population is still high in Bangladesh. This study investigated the prevalence of group A, B, and C rotavirus (RAV, RBV, RCV), norovirus, adenovirus (AdV) and human bocavirus (HBoV) infections in children with acute gastroenteritis in Bangladesh from February 2014 to January 2019. A total of 574 fecal specimens collected from children with diarrhea in Bangladesh during the period of February 2014-January 2019 were examined for RAV, RBV and RCV by reverse transcriptase- multiplex polymerase chain reaction (RT- multiplex PCR). RAV was further characterized to G-typing and P-typing by RT-multiplex PCR and sequencing method. It was found that 24.4% (140 of 574) fecal specimens were positive for RVA followed by AdV of 4.5%. RBV and RCV could not be detected in this study. Genotype G1P[8] was the most prevalent (43%), followed by G2P[4] (18%), and G9P[8] (3%). Among other genotypes, G9P[4] was most frequent (12%), followed by G1P[6] (11%), G9P[6] (3%), and G11P[25] (3%). We found that 7% RVA were nontypeable. Mutations at antigenic regions of the VP7 gene were detected in G1P[8] and G2P[4] strains. Incidence of rotavirus infection had the highest peak (58.6%) during November to February with diarrhea (90.7%) as the most common symptom. Children aged 4–11 months had the highest rotavirus infection percentage (37.9%). By providing baseline data, this study helps to assess efficacy of currently available RVA vaccine. This study revealed a high RVA detection rate, supporting health authorities in planning strategies such as introduction of RVA vaccine in national immunization program to reduce the disease burden."
https://openalex.org/W3107169682,"Although venous invasion (VI) is a poor prognostic factor for patients with pancreatobiliary tract cancers, its histopathologic characteristics have not been well described. We evaluated the patterns of VI and the added benefit provided by CD31, desmin, and dual CD31‒desmin immunolabeling for identification of VI. We included 120 surgically resected pancreatobiliary tract cancer cases—59 cases as a test set with known VI and 61 cases as a validation set without information of VI. VI was classified into three patterns: intraepithelial neoplasia-like (IN-like), conventional, and destructive. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining and CD31, desmin, and dual CD31‒desmin immunolabeling were performed. Foci number and patterns of VI were compared with the test and validation sets. More foci of VI were detected by single CD31 ( P = 0.022) than H&amp;E staining in the test set. CD31 immunolabeling detected more foci of the conventional pattern of VI, and desmin immunolabeling detected more foci of the destructive pattern (all, P &lt; 0.001). Dual CD31‒desmin immunolabeling identified more foci of VI ( P = 0.012) and specifically detected more foci of IN-like ( P = 0.045) and destructive patterns ( P &lt; 0.001) than H&amp;E staining in the validation set. However, dual CD31‒desmin immunolabeling was not helpful for detecting the conventional pattern of VI in the validation set. Patients with VI detected by dual CD31‒desmin immunolabeling had shorter disease-free survival ( P &lt;0.001) than those without VI. VI detected by dual CD31‒desmin immunolabeling was a worse prognostic indicator ( P = 0.009). More foci of VI could be detected with additional single CD31 or dual CD31‒desmin immunolabeling. The precise evaluation of VI with dual CD31‒desmin immunolabeling can provide additional prognostic information for patients with surgically resected pancreatobiliary tract cancers."
https://openalex.org/W3108486944,"Acute exacerbation of ILD (AE-ILD) is a common reason for hospitalization; it is also associated with significant mortality. Less is known about the prognostic significance of other events causing acute, non-elective hospitalizations in ILD patients. ILD patients hospitalized due to acute respiratory worsening were collected from medical records. Reasons for respiratory deterioration were classified into AE-ILDs and other causes. Clinical features and survival data of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and other types of ILDs were evaluated and compared. In all, 237 patients (138 with IPF and 99 with other ILD) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Of the non-IPF ILD types, the most prevalent subgroups were connective tissue disease-associated ILD (n = 33) and asbestosis (n = 22). The most common cause for hospitalization was AE-ILD explaining 41% of hospitalizations. Lower respiratory tract infection (22%), subacute progression of ILD (12%) and cardiovascular causes (7.2%) were other common reasons for hospital treatment. Patients with a lower respiratory tract infection had a more favorable prognosis compared with patients with AE-ILD. AE-ILDs were less fatal than cardiovascular or concurrent non-ILD-related causes for hospitalizations in non-IPF patients. High Gender-Age-Physiology (GAP) index was a marker for shortened survival and earlier AE-ILDs in all patients. IPF patients had a significantly shorter overall and post-hospitalization survival time compared with other ILDs. Most respiratory hospitalizations in ILD patients were related to causes other than AE-ILD, which highlights the importance of accurate differential diagnosis in order to target the appropriate treatment for each ILD patient."
https://openalex.org/W3108952891,"With over one million cases worldwide annually and a high fatality in symptomatic forms, human leptospirosis is a growing public health concern for the most vulnerable populations, especially in the context of global warming and unplanned urbanization. Although the Asia-Pacific region is particularly affected, accurate epidemiological data are often lacking. We conducted an eleven-year retrospective laboratory-based epidemiological survey of human leptospirosis in New Caledonia. From 2006 to 2016, 904 cases were laboratory-confirmed, including 29 fatalities, corresponding to an average annual incidence of 30.6/100,000 and a case fatality rate of 3.2%. Over the period, there was a major shift from indirect serological diagnosis by MAT to direct diagnosis by real-time PCR, a more specific and sensitive test when performed early in the course of the disease. The systematic implementation of genotyping informed on the variety of the infective strains involved, with a predominance of serogroups Icterohaemorrhagiae and Pyrogenes. The epidemiological pattern showed a marked seasonality with an annual peak in March-April. Interestingly, the seasonal peak in children of school age was significantly earlier and corresponded to school holidays, suggesting that attending school from February on could protect children from environment-borne leptospirosis."

This study aimed to validate and compare models using clinical, endoscopic, and/or pathology findings to differentiate CD from ITB. Methods Data from newly diagnosed ITB and CD patients were retrospectively collected from 5 centers located in Thailand or Hong Kong. The data was applied to Lee, et al ., Makharia, et al ., Jung, et al ., and Limsrivilai, et al . model. Results Five hundred and thirty patients (383 CD, 147 ITB) with clinical and endoscopic data were included. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of Limsrivilai’s clinical-endoscopy (CE) model was 0.853, which was comparable to the value of 0.862 in Jung’s model (p = 0.52). Both models performed significantly better than Lee’s endoscopy model (AUROC: 0.713, p&lt;0.01). Pathology was available for review in 199 patients (116 CD, 83 ITB). When 3 modalities were combined, Limsrivilai’s clinical-endoscopy-pathology (CEP) model performed significantly better (AUROC: 0.887) than Limsrivilai’s CE model (AUROC: 0.824, p = 0.01), Jung’s model (AUROC: 0.798, p = 0.005) and Makharia’s model (AUROC: 0.637, p &lt;0.01). In 83 ITB patients, the rate of misdiagnosis with CD when used the proposed cutoff values in each original study was 9.6% for Limsrivilai’s CEP, 15.7% for Jung’s, and 66.3% for Makharia’s model. Conclusions Scoring systems with more parameters and diagnostic modalities performed better; however, application to clinical practice is still limited owing to high rate of misdiagnosis of ITB as CD. Models integrating more modalities such as imaging and serological tests are needed."
https://openalex.org/W3106763330,"Today’s office chairs are not known to promote active sitting or to activate the lumbar trunk muscles, both of which functions are ergonomically recommended. This study investigated a newly developed dynamic office chair with a moveable seat, specifically designed to promote trunk muscle controlled active sitting. The study aimed to determine the means by which the seat movement was controlled during active sitting. This was accomplished by quantifying trunk and thigh muscular activity and body kinematics. Additionally, the effect of increased spinal motion on muscular activity and body kinematics was analysed. Ten subjects were equipped with reflective body markers and surface electromyography on three lumbar back muscles (multifidus, iliocostalis, longissimus) and two thigh muscles (vastus lateralis and medialis). Subjects performed a reading task during static and active sitting in spontaneous and maximum ranges of motion in a simulated office laboratory setting. The temporal muscle activation pattern, average muscle activity and body segment kinematics were analysed and compared using Friedman and post-hoc Wilcoxon tests (p≤0.05). Active sitting on the new chair significantly affected the lumbar trunk muscles, with characteristic cyclic unloading/loading in response to the seat movement. Neither thigh muscle activity nor lateral body weight shift were substantially affected by active sitting. When participants increased their range of motion, the lumbar back muscles were activated for longer and relaxation times were shorter. The characteristic activity pattern of the lumbar trunk muscles was shown to be the most likely dominant factor in controlling seat movement during active sitting. Consequently, the new chair may have a potential positive impact on back health during prolonged sitting. Further studies are necessary to analyse the frequency and intensity of active sitting during daily office work."
https://openalex.org/W3107494456,"Mucin-type O -glycans are involved in cancer initiation and progression, although details of their biological and clinicopathological roles remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinicopathological significance of β1,3- N -acetylglucosaminyltransferase 6 (β3Gn-T6), an essential enzyme for the synthesis of core 3 O -glycan and several other O -glycans in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We performed immunohistochemical and lectin-histochemical analyses to detect the expression of β3Gn-T6 and several O -glycans in 156 cases of PDAC with pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs) and corresponding normal tissue samples. The T antigen, Tn antigen, sialyl Lewis X (sLeX) antigen, and sLeX on core 2 O -glycan were more highly expressed in PDAC cells than in normal pancreatic duct epithelial cells (NPDEs). Conversely, the expression of 6-sulfo N -acetyllactosamine on extended core 1 O -glycan was found in NPDEs and was low in PDAC cells. These glycan expression levels were not associated with patient outcomes. β3Gn-T6 was expressed in ~20% of PDAC cases and 30–40% of PanINs but not in NPDEs. Higher expression of β3Gn-T6 was found in PDAC cells in more differentiated adenocarcinoma cases showing significantly longer disease-free survival in both univariate and multivariate analyses. In addition, the expression of β3Gn-T6 in PDAC cells and PanINs significantly correlated with the expression of MUC5AC in these cells, suggesting that β3Gn-T6 expression is related to cellular differentiation status of the gastric foveolar phenotype. Thus, it is likely that β3Gn-T6 expression in PDAC cells is a favorable prognostic factor in PDAC patients, and that the expression of β3Gn-T6 correlates with the gastric foveolar phenotype in pancreatic carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3108909913,"Chronic conditions requiring long-term rehabilitation therapies, such as hypertension, stroke, or cancer, involve complex interactions between various systems/organs of the body and mutual influences, thus implicating a multiorgan approach. The dual-flow IVTech LiveBox2 bioreactor is a recently developed inter-connected dynamic cell culture model able to mimic organ crosstalk, since cells belonging to different organs can be connected and grown under flow conditions in a more physiological environment. This study aims to setup for the first time a 2-way connected culture of human neuroblastoma cells, SH-SY5Y, and Human Coronary Artery Smooth Muscle Cells, HCASMC through a dual-flow IVTech LiveBox2 bioreactor, in order to represent a simplified model of nervous-cardiovascular systems crosstalk, possibly relevant for the above-mentioned diseases. The system was tested by treating the cells with 10nM angiotensin II (AngII) inducing PKCβII/HuR/VEGF pathway activation, since AngII and PKCβII/HuR/VEGF pathway are relevant in cardiovascular and neuroscience research. Three different conditions were applied: 1- HCASMC and SH-SY5Y separately seeded in petri dishes (static condition); 2- the two cell lines separately seeded under flow (dynamic condition); 3- the two lines, seeded in dynamic conditions, connected, each maintaining its own medium, with a membrane as interface for biohumoral changes between the two mediums, and then treated. We detected that only in condition 3 there was a synergic AngII-dependent VEGF production in SH-SY5Y cells coupled to an AngII-dependent PKCβII/HuR/VEGF pathway activation in HCASMC, consistent with the observed physiological response in vivo . HCASMC response to AngII seems therefore to be generated by/derived from the reciprocal cell crosstalk under the dynamic inter-connection ensured by the dual flow LiveBox 2 bioreactor. This system can represent a useful tool for studying the crosstalk between organs, helpful for instance in rehabilitation research or when investigating chronic diseases; further, it offers the advantageous opportunity of cultivating each cell line in its own medium, thus mimicking, at least in part, distinct tissue milieu ."
https://openalex.org/W3110337247,"Computed tomography (CT) scans represent the gold standard in the planning of functional endoscopic sinus surgeries (FESS). Yet, radiologists and otolaryngologists have different perspectives on these scans. In general, residents often struggle with aspects involved in both reporting and operation planning. The aim of this study was to compare the completeness of structured reports (SR) of preoperative CT images and structured operation planning (SOP) to conventional reports (CR) and conventional operation planning (COP) to potentially improve future treatment decisions on an individual level. In total, 30 preoperative CT scans obtained for surgical planning of patients scheduled for FESS were evaluated using SR and CR by radiology residents. Subsequently, otolaryngology residents performed a COP using free texts and a SOP using a specific template. All radiology reports and operation plannings were evaluated by two experienced FESS surgeons regarding their completeness for surgical planning. User satisfaction of otolaryngology residents was assessed by using visual analogue scales. Overall radiology report completeness was significantly higher using SRs regarding surgically important structures compared to CRs (84.4 vs. 22.0%, p&lt;0.001). SOPs produced significantly higher completeness ratings (97% vs. 39.4%, p&lt;0.001) regarding pathologies and anatomical variances. Moreover, time efficiency was not significantly impaired by implementation of SR (148 s vs. 160 s, p = 0.61) and user satisfaction was significantly higher for SOP (VAS 8.1 vs. 4.1, p&lt;0.001). Implementation of SR and SOP results in a significantly increased completeness of radiology reports and operation planning for FESS. Consequently, the combination of both facilitates surgical planning and may decrease potential risks during FESS."
https://openalex.org/W3107070892,"Essential gene prediction helps to find minimal genes indispensable for the survival of any organism. Machine learning (ML) algorithms have been useful for the prediction of gene essentiality. However, currently available ML pipelines perform poorly for organisms with limited experimental data. The objective is the development of a new ML pipeline to help in the annotation of essential genes of less explored disease-causing organisms for which minimal experimental data is available. The proposed strategy combines unsupervised feature selection technique, dimension reduction using the Kamada-Kawai algorithm, and semi-supervised ML algorithm employing Laplacian Support Vector Machine (LapSVM) for prediction of essential and non-essential genes from genome-scale metabolic networks using very limited labeled dataset. A novel scoring technique, Semi-Supervised Model Selection Score, equivalent to area under the ROC curve (auROC), has been proposed for the selection of the best model when supervised performance metrics calculation is difficult due to lack of data. The unsupervised feature selection followed by dimension reduction helped to observe a distinct circular pattern in the clustering of essential and non-essential genes. LapSVM then created a curve that dissected this circle for the classification and prediction of essential genes with high accuracy (auROC &gt; 0.85) even with 1% labeled data for model training. After successful validation of this ML pipeline on both Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes that show high accuracy even when the labeled dataset is very limited, this strategy is used for the prediction of essential genes of organisms with inadequate experimentally known data, such as Leishmania sp . Using a graph-based semi-supervised machine learning scheme, a novel integrative approach has been proposed for essential gene prediction that shows universality in application to both Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes with limited labeled data. The essential genes predicted using the pipeline provide an important lead for the prediction of gene essentiality and identification of novel therapeutic targets for antibiotic and vaccine development against disease-causing parasites."
https://openalex.org/W3108460904,"Accurate identification of named accessions in germplasm collections is extremely important, especially for vegetatively propagated crops which are expensive to maintain. Thus, an inexpensive, reliable, and rapid genotyping method is essential because it avoids the need for laborious and time-consuming morphological comparisons. Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) marker panels containing large numbers of SNPs have been developed for many crop species, but such panels are much too large for basic cultivar identification. Here, we have identified a minimum set of SNP markers sufficient to distinguish apple cultivars held in the English and Welsh national collections providing a cheaper and automatable alternative to the markers currently used by the community. We show that SNP genotyping with a small set of well selected markers is equally efficient as microsatellites for the identification of apple cultivars and has the added advantage of automation and reduced cost when screening large numbers of samples."
https://openalex.org/W3109410006,"Dermatopontin (DPT) is an extracellular matrix (ECM) protein with diversified pharmaceutical applications. It plays important role in cell adhesion/migration, angiogenesis and ECM maintenance. The recombinant production of this protein will enable further exploration of its multifaceted functions. In this study, DPT protein has been expressed in Escherichia coli (E . coli) aiming at cost effective recombinant production. The E . coli GJ1158 expression system was transformed with constructed recombinant vector (pRSETA-DPT) and protein was expressed as inclusion bodies on induction with NaCl. The inclusion bodies were solubilised in urea and renaturation of protein was done by on-column refolding procedure in Nickel activated Sepharose column. The refolded Histidine-tagged DPT protein was purified and eluted from column using imidazole and its purity was confirmed by analytical techniques. The biological activity of the protein was confirmed by collagen fibril assay, wound healing assay and Chorioallantoic Membrane (CAM) angiogenesis assay on comparison with standard DPT. The purified DPT was found to enhance the collagen fibrillogenesis process and improved the migration of human endothelial cells. About 73% enhanced wound closure was observed in purified DPT treated endothelial cells as compared to control. The purified DPT also could induce neovascularisation in the CAM model. At this stage, scaling up the production process for DPT with appropriate purity and reproducibility will have a promising commercial edge."
https://openalex.org/W3109460102,"Migrant workers may experience higher burdens of occupational injury and illness compared to native-born workers, which may be due to the differential exposure to occupational hazards, differential vulnerability to exposure-associated health impacts, or both. This study aims to assess if the relationships between psychosocial job characteristics and mental health vary by migrant status in Australia (differential vulnerability). A total of 8969 persons from wave 14 (2014–2015) of the Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey were included in the analysis. Psychosocial job characteristics included skill discretion, decision authority and job insecurity. Mental health was assessed via a Mental Health Inventory-5 score (MHI-5), with a higher score indicating better mental health. Migrant status was defined by (i) country of birth (COB), (ii) the combination of COB and English/Non-English dominant language of COB and (iii) the combination of COB and years since arrival in Australia. Data were analysed using linear regression, adjusting for gender, age and educational attainment. Migrant status was analysed as an effect modifier of the relationships between psychosocial job characteristics and mental health. Skill discretion and decision authority were positively associated with the MHI-5 score while job insecurity was negatively associated with the MHI-5 score. We found no statistical evidence of migrant status acting as an effect modifier of the psychosocial job characteristic―MHI-5 relationships. With respect to psychosocial job characteristic―mental health relationships, these results suggest that differential exposure to job stressors is a more important mechanism than differential vulnerability for generating occupational health inequities between migrants and native-born workers in Australia."
https://openalex.org/W3109965948,"More and more genome-wide association studies are being designed to uncover the full genetic basis of common diseases. Nonetheless, the resulting loci are often insufficient to fully recover the observed heritability. Epistasis, or gene-gene interaction, is one of many hypotheses put forward to explain this missing heritability. In the present work, we propose epiGWAS, a new approach for epistasis detection that identifies interactions between a target SNP and the rest of the genome. This contrasts with the classical strategy of epistasis detection through exhaustive pairwise SNP testing. We draw inspiration from causal inference in randomized clinical trials, which allows us to take into account linkage disequilibrium. EpiGWAS encompasses several methods, which we compare to state-of-the-art techniques for epistasis detection on simulated and real data. The promising results demonstrate empirically the benefits of EpiGWAS to identify pairwise interactions."
https://openalex.org/W3110124128,"Cardiovascular diseases are estimated to cause 46% of all mortalities in Kuwait. The aim of evidence-based clinical practice has led to an increased interest in the design of medication assessment tools (MATs) to identify deviations from evidence-based practice, and eventually provide the basis of consistent standardized prescribing. This study was designed to develop and validate MATs using quality standards extracted from international guidelines to evaluate prescribing practices in secondary prevention of coronary heart disease in patients with post-acute coronary syndrome (STEMI or NSTEACS]. International guidelines were reviewed to develop two MATs (MAT STEMI and MAT NSTEACS ). Face and content validity of the developed tools was performed with three MAT experts and thirteen cardiologists. Two quantitative approaches were used to determine content validity: (i) Content Validity Ratio (CVR) and the average of CVR values; and (ii) Content validity index at item level (I-CVI) and scale-level of the tool (S-CVI/Ave) with the average approach. Criteria with a CVR&lt;0.54 and I-CVI &lt;70% were eliminated. Ultimately, feasibility testing of both MATs was performed on 66 patients’ records as a pilot study. The initial developed MAT STEMI and MAT NSTEACS consisted of eighteen and twelve medication-related criteria, respectively. Face validity resulted in dividing each MAT into five dimensions. In the MAT STEMI , three criteria had CVR values &lt; 0.54 and I-CVIs &lt; 70%. Two criteria were eliminated and one was retained. This resulted in sixteen criteria with average CVR 0.85 and S-CVI/Ave 92.3%. In the MAT NSTEACS , one criterion was eliminated. This resulted in eleven criteria with average CVR 0.93 and S-CVI/Ave 96.5%. The overall adherence scores to the MAT STEMI and MAT NSTEACS were 64.1% (95% CI: 57.8–69.9%) and 62.0% (95% CI: 53.4–69.9%), respectively. It was judged as intermediate adherence for both MATs. MAT STEMI and MAT NSTEACS were developed and validated to be utilized for optimizing medication therapy management and improving therapeutic interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3108622636,"Most agricultural soils are expected to be contaminated with agricultural chemicals. As the exposure to pesticides can have adverse effects on non-target organisms, avoiding contaminated areas would be advantageous on an individual level, but could lead to a chemical landscape fragmentation with disadvantages on the metapopulation level. We investigated the avoidance behavior of juvenile common toads (Bufo bufo ) in response to seven pesticide formulations commonly used in German vineyards. We used test arenas filled with silica sand and oversprayed half of each with different pesticide formulations. We placed a toad in the middle of an arena, filmed its behavior over 24 hours, calculated the proportion of time a toad spent on the contaminated side and compared it to a random side choice. We found evidence for the avoidance of the folpet formulation Folpan® 500 SC, the metrafenone formulation Vivando® and the glyphosate formulation Taifun® forte at maximum recommended field rates for vine and a trend for avoidance of Wettable Sulphur Stulln (sulphur). No avoidance was observed when testing Folpan® 80 WDG (folpet), Funguran® progress (copper hydroxide), SpinTor TM (spinosad), or 10% of the maximum field rate of any formulation tested. In the choice-tests in which we observed an avoidance, toads also showed higher activity on the contaminated side of the arena. As video analysis with tracking software is not always feasible, we further tested the effect of reducing the sampling interval for manual data analyses. We showed that one data point every 15 or 60 minutes results in a risk of overlooking a weak avoidance behavior, but still allows to verify the absence/presence of an avoidance for six out of seven formulations. Our findings are important for an upcoming pesticide risk assessment for amphibians and could be a template for future standardized tests."
https://openalex.org/W3110048478,"High body mass index is a known barrier to access to kidney transplantation in patients with end-stage kidney disease. The extent to which weight and weight changes affect access to transplantation among obese candidates differentially by race/ethnicity has received little attention. We included 10 221 obese patients waitlisted for kidney transplantation prior to end-stage kidney disease onset between 1995–2015. We used multinomial logistic regression models to examine the association between race/ethnicity and annualized change in body mass index (defined as stable [-2 to 2 kg/m 2 /year], loss [&gt;2 kg/m 2 /year] or gain [&gt;2 kg/m 2 /year]). We then used Fine-Gray models to examine the association between weight changes and access to living or deceased donor transplantation by race/ethnicity, accounting for the competing risk of death. Overall, 29% of the cohort lost weight and 7% gained weight; 46% received a transplant. Non-Hispanic blacks had a 24% (95% CI 1.12–1.38) higher odds of weight loss and 22% lower odds of weight gain (95% CI 0.64–0.95) compared with non-Hispanic whites. Hispanics did not differ from whites in their odds of weight loss or weight gain. Overall, weight gain was associated with lower access to transplantation (HR 0.88 [95% CI 0.79–0.99]) compared with maintenance of stable weight, but weight loss was not associated with better access to transplantation (HR 0.96 [95% CI 0.90–1.02]), although this relation differed by baseline body mass index and for recipients of living versus deceased donor organs. For example, weight loss was associated with improved access to living donor transplantation (HR 1.24 [95% CI 1.07–1.44]) in whites but not in blacks or Hispanics. In a cohort of obese patients waitlisted before dialysis, blacks were more likely to lose weight and less likely to gain weight compared with whites. Weight loss was only associated with improved access to living donor transplantation among whites. Further studies are needed to understand the reasons for the observed associations."
https://openalex.org/W3107757431,"With the rise in physical inactivity and its related diseases, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms involved in physical activity regulation. Biological factors regulating physical activity are studied to establish a possible target for improving the physical activity level. However, little is known about the role metabolism plays in physical activity regulation. Therefore, we studied protein fractional synthesis rate (FSR) of multiple organ tissues of 12-week-old male mice that were previously established as inherently low-active (n = 15, C3H/HeJ strain) and high-active (n = 15, C57L/J strain). Total body water of each mouse was enriched to 5% deuterium oxide (D 2 O) via intraperitoneal injection and maintained with D 2 O enriched drinking water for about 24 h. Blood samples from the jugular vein and tissues (kidney, heart, lung, muscle, fat, jejunum, ileum, liver, brain, skin, and bone) were collected for enrichment analysis of alanine by LC-MS/MS. Protein FSR was calculated as -ln(1-enrichment). Data are mean±SE as fraction/day (unpaired t-test). Kidney protein FSR in the low-active mice was 7.82% higher than in high-active mice (low-active: 0.1863±0.0018, high-active: 0.1754±0.0028, p = 0.0030). No differences were found in any of the other measured organ tissues. However, all tissues resulted in a generally higher protein FSR in the low-activity mice compared to the high-activity mice (e.g. lung LA: 0.0711±0.0015, HA: 0.0643±0.0020, heart LA: 0.0649± 0.0013 HA: 0.0712±0.0073). Our observations suggest that high-active mice in most organ tissues are no more inherently equipped for metabolic adaptation than low-active mice, but there may be a connection between protein metabolism of kidney tissue and physical activity level. In addition, low-active mice have higher organ-specific baseline protein FSR possibly contributing to the inability to achieve higher physical activity levels."
https://openalex.org/W3108888010,"This paper aims to further increase the reliability of optimal results by setting the simulation conditions to be as close as possible to the real or actual operation to create a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) view for the installation of the Fractional-Order PID (FOPID) controller. For this purpose, we consider two different sources of variability in such a CPS control model. The first source refers to the changeability of a target of the control model (multiple setpoints) because of environmental noise factors and the second source refers to an anomaly in sensors that is raised in a feedback loop. We develop a new approach to optimize two objective functions under uncertainty including signal energy control and response error control while obtaining the robustness among the source of variability with the lowest computational cost. A new hybrid surrogate-metaheuristic approach is developed using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to update the Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate for a sequential improvement of the robust optimal result. The application of efficient global optimization is extended to estimate surrogate prediction error with less computational cost using a jackknife leave-one-out estimator. This paper examines the challenges of such a robust multi-objective optimization for FOPID control of a five-bar linkage robot manipulator. The results show the applicability and effectiveness of our proposed method in obtaining robustness and reliability in a CPS control system by tackling required computational efforts."

In this study, we address the diagnostic efficacies of an anti-GPL-core ELISA kit in disseminated lymphadenopathy patients positive for NTM culture and anti-IFN-γ autoantibodies. The study was conducted in a tertiary referral center in northeastern Thailand and patients with NTM, tuberculosis, melioidosis, and control subjects were enrolled. Plasma immunoglobulin A (IgA) and G (IgG) antibodies against GPL-core were detected in the subjects and the specificity and sensitivity of the assay was assessed. Anti-GPL-core IgA and IgG levels were significantly higher in NTM patients than other groups (p &lt; 0.0001). Diagnostic efficacy for NTM patients using anti-GPL-core IgA cut-off value of 0.352 U/ml showed good sensitivity (91.18%) and intermediate specificity (70.15%). Using a cut-off value of 4.140 AU/ml for anti-GPL-core IgG showed the same sensitivity (91.18%) with increased specificity (89.55%) and an 81.58% positive predictive value. Most patients with moderate levels (4.140–7.955 AU/ml) of anti-GPL-core IgG had rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) infection. Taken together, the detection of anti-GPL-core antibodies could provide a novel option for the diagnosis and management of disseminated NTM infected patients."
https://openalex.org/W3109796473,"The activity of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) has significant bacterial species bias, the mechanisms of which are not fully understood. We employed single-molecule tracking to measure the affinity of three different AMPs to hybrid supported bilayers composed of lipid A extracted from four different Gram negative bacteria and observed a strong empirical anticorrelation between the affinity of a particular AMP to a given lipid A layer and the activity of that AMP towards the bacterium from which that lipid A was extracted. This suggested that the species bias of AMP activity is directly related to AMP interactions with bacterial outer membranes, despite the fact that the mechanism of antimicrobial activity occurs at the inner membrane. The trend also suggested that the interactions between AMPs and the outer membrane lipid A (even in the absence of other components, such as lipopolysaccharides) capture effects that are relevant to the minimum inhibitory concentration."
https://openalex.org/W3110039276,"Joint constraint could limit the available degrees of freedom in a kinematic chain for maintaining postural stability. This study investigated adaptive changes in postural synergy due to bracing of bilateral knee joints, usually thought to have a trifling impact on upright stance. Twenty-four young adults were requested to maintain balance on a stabilometer plate as steadily as possible while wearing a pair of knee orthoses, either unlocked (the non-constraint (NC) condition) or locked to restrict knee motion (the knee constraint (KC) condition). Knee constraint led to a significant increase in the regularity of the stabilometer angular velocity. More than 95% of the variance properties of the joint angular velocities in the lower limb were explained by the first and second principal components (PC1 and PC2), which represented the ankle strategy and the combined knee and hip strategy, respectively. In addition to the increase trend in PC1 regularity, knee constraint enhanced the mutual information of the stabilometer angular velocity and PC1 (MI STBV-PC1 ) but reduced the mutual information of the stabilometer angular velocity and PC2 (MI STBV-PC2 ). The MI STBV-PC1 was also positively correlated to stance steadiness on the stabilometer in the KC condition. In summary, in the knee constraint condition, postural synergy on the stabilometer was reorganized to increase reliance on ankle strategies to maintain equilibrium. In particular, a stable stabilometer stance under knee constraint is associated with a high level of coherent ankle–stabilometer interaction."
https://openalex.org/W3110289350,"Path testing is the basic approach of white box testing and the main approach to solve it by discovering the particular input data of the searching space to encompass the paths in the software under test. Due to the increasing software complexity, exhaustive testing is impossible and computationally not feasible. The ultimate challenge is to generate suitable test data that maximize the coverage; many approaches have been developed by researchers to accomplish path coverage. The paper suggested a hybrid method (NSA-GA) based on Negative Selection Algorithm (NSA) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) to generate an optimal test data avoiding replication to cover all possible paths. The proposed method modifies the generation of detectors in the generation phase of NSA using GA, as well as, develops a fitness function based on the paths’ prioritization. Different benchmark programs with different data types have been used. The results show that the hybrid method improved the coverage percentage of the programs’ paths, even for complicated paths and its ability to minimize the generated number of test data and enhance the efficiency even with the increased input range of different data types used. This method improves the effectiveness and efficiency of test data generation and maximizes search space area, increasing percentage of path coverage while preventing redundant data."

This is concordant with the Hispanic Paradox, which posits that Hispanics have good health and lower mortality than White Americans despite their relative socioeconomic disadvantages. However, the research is limited in relation to the effects of race on health, independent of ethnicity, among this population. In this study, the author disaggregated Mexican Americans, foreign-born and U.S.-born into two categories, White and Black Mexicans, in order to assess their likelihood of having an asthma diagnosis, compared to White Americans and to each other. This study used harmonized data from the National Health Interview Survey from 2000–2018 with a final analytic sample of N = 1,094,516. The analysis was conducted using binary logistic regression, controlling for acculturation and health behavior-related variables, as well as sociodemographic characteristics. In the results, Black Mexicans had a significant disadvantage in relation to their White counterparts and White Americans. The findings suggest there is an intra-ethnic racial disparity in asthma and the Hispanic paradox is not applicable across racial lines for Mexican Americans. These findings also suggest Black Mexicans’ poor asthma outcomes are the byproduct of various mechanisms of racial inequality."
https://openalex.org/W3106794751,"Posttranscriptional modification of tRNA is critical for efficient protein translation and proper cell growth, and defects in tRNA modifications are often associated with human disease. Although most of the enzymes required for eukaryotic tRNA modifications are known, many of these enzymes have not been identified and characterized in several model multicellular eukaryotes. Here, we present two related approaches to identify the genes required for tRNA modifications in multicellular organisms using primer extension assays with fluorescent oligonucleotides. To demonstrate the utility of these approaches we first use expression of exogenous genes in yeast to experimentally identify two TRM1 orthologs capable of forming N2 , N2 -dimethylguanosine (m 2,2 G) on residue 26 of cytosolic tRNA in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana . We also show that a predicted catalytic aspartate residue is required for function in each of the proteins. We next use RNA interference in cultured Drosophila melanogaster cells to identify the gene required for m 2,2 G 26 formation on cytosolic tRNA. Additionally, using these approaches we experimentally identify D . melanogaster gene CG10050 as the corresponding ortholog of human DTWD2 , which encodes the protein required for formation of 3-amino-3-propylcarboxyuridine (acp 3 U) on residue 20a of cytosolic tRNA. We further show that A . thaliana gene AT2G41750 can form acp 3 U 20b on an A . thaliana tRNA expressed in yeast cells, and that the aspartate and tryptophan residues in the DXTW motif of this protein are required for modification activity. These results demonstrate that these approaches can be used to study tRNA modification enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W3107170374,"Background With an increasing rate of caesarean sections as well as rising numbers of multiple pregnancies, valid classifications for benchmarking are needed. The Robson classification provides a method to group cases with caesarean section in order to assess differences in outcome across regions and sites. In this study we set up a novel method of classification by using routinely collected health data. We hypothesize i that routinely collected health data can be used to apply complex medical classifications and ii that the Robson classification is capable of classifying mothers and their corresponding newborn into meaningful groups with regard to outcome. Methods and findings The study was conducted at the coding department and the department of obstetrics and gynecology Inselspital, University Hospital of Bern, Switzerland. The study population contained inpatient cases from 2014 until 2017. Administrative and health data were extracted from the Data Warehouse. Cases were classified by a Structured Query Language code according to the Robson criteria using data from the administrative system, the electronic health record and from the laboratory system. An automated query to classify the cases according to Robson could be implemented and successfully validated. A linkage of the mother’s class to the corresponding newborn could be established. The distribution of clinical indicators was described. It could be shown that the Robson classes are associated to outcome parameters and case related costs. Conclusions With this study it could be demonstrated, that a complex query on routinely collected health data would serve for medical classification and monitoring of quality and outcome. Risk-stratification might be conducted using this data set and should be the next step in order to evaluate the Robson criteria and outcome. This study will enhance the discussion to adopt an automated classification on routinely collected health data for quality assurance purposes."
https://openalex.org/W3108303224,"Background The opioid epidemic and subsequent mortality is a national concern in the U.S. The burden of this problem is disproportionately high among low-income and uninsured populations who are more likely to experience unmet need for substance use services. We assessed the impact of two Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) substance use disorder (SUD) service capacity grants on SUD staffing and service use in HRSA -funded health centers (HCs). Methods and findings We conducted cross-sectional analyses of the Uniform Data System (UDS) from 2010 to 2017 to assess HC (n = 1,341) trends in capacity measured by supply of SUD and medication-assisted treatment (MAT) providers, utilization of SUD and MAT services, and panel size and visit ratio measured by the number of patients seen and visits delivered by SUD and MAT providers. We merged mortality and national survey data to incorporate SUD mortality and SUD treatment services availability, respectively. From 2010 to 2015, 20% of HC organizations had any SUD staff, had an average of one full-time equivalent SUD employee, and did not report an increase in SUD patients or SUD services. SUD capacity grew significantly in 2016 (43%) and 2017 (22%). MAT capacity growth was measured only in 2016 and 2017 and grew by 29% between those years. Receipt of both supplementary grants increased the probability of any SUD capacity by 35% (95% CI: 26%, 44%) and service use, but decreased the probability of SUD visit ratio by 680 visits (95% CI: -1,013, -347), compared to not receiving grants. Conclusions The significant growth in HC specialized SUD capacity is likely due to supplemental SUD-specific HRSA grants and may vary by structure of grants. Expanding SUD capacity in HCs is an important step in increasing SUD access for low income and uninsured populations broadly and for patients of these organizations."
https://openalex.org/W3108511715,"Cardiovascular disease (CDV) risk factors are highly prevalent among adults with low social class in Spain. However, little is known on how these factors are distributed in the immigrant population, a socio-economic disadvantaged population. Thus, this study aims to examine inequalities in CVD risk factors among immigrant and native populations. We conducted a cross-sectional study using data from the Spanish National Health Survey 2017 and used log-binomial regression to quantify the association of immigrant status on CVD risk factors among adults aged 25–64 years. The probabilities of having at least three CVD risk factors were higher for immigrants from Eastern Europe (PR: 1.25; 95% CI: 1.15–1.35) and lower for immigrants from Africa (PR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.69–0.89) when compared with natives. The association of immigrant status and CVD risk factors varies with educational attainment (p-interaction = 0.001). Immigrants from Eastern Europe with low educational attainment have a higher probability of having at least three CVD risk factors compared with their native counterparts. In contrast, immigrants from Africa and Latin America with low educational attainment had a protective effect against having at least three CVD risk relative to natives. Health prevention and promotion strategies to reduce the burden of CVD taking should account for educational attainment given its differential effect among the immigrant population in Spain."
https://openalex.org/W3110175488,"There is considerable speculation that prisons are a breeding ground for radicalization. These concerns take on added significance in the era of mass incarceration in the United States, where 1.5 million people are held in state or federal prisons and around 600,000 people are released from prison annually. Prior research relies primarily on the speculation of prison officials, media representations, and/or cross-sectional designs to understand the imprisonment-extremism nexus. We develop a tripartite theoretical model to examine continuity and change in activism and radicalism intentions upon leaving prison. We test these models using data from a large probability sample of prisoners ( N = 802) in Texas interviewed in the week preceding their release from prison and then reinterviewed 10 months later using a validated scale of activism and radicalism intentions. We arrive at three primary conclusions. First, levels of activism decline upon reentry to the community ( d = -0.30, p &lt; .01), while levels of radicalism largely remain unchanged ( d = -0.08, p = .28). What is learned and practiced in prison appears to quickly lose its vitality on the street. Second, salient groups and organizations fell in importance after leaving prison, including country, race/ethnicity, and religion, suggesting former prisoners are occupied by other endeavors. Finally, while we identify few correlates of changes in extremist intentions, higher levels of legal cynicism in prison were associated with increases in both activism and radicalism intentions after release from prison. Efforts designed to improve legal orientations could lessen intentions to support non-violent and violent extremist actions. These results point to an imprisonment-extremism nexus that is diminished largely by the realities of prisoner reentry."
https://openalex.org/W3106626104,"All 4 dengue viruses (DENV) cause sporadic outbreaks of human disease in the Rio Grande Valley along the US-Mexico border. In addition, West Nile virus (WNV) is enzootic in most border communities, and is the only arbovirus known to cause human disease in the El Paso, Texas community. In an effort to determine if DENV were also endemic in the El Paso community, a serosurvey was conducted among mothers at the time of delivery of their babies in selected hospitals. Cord-blood plasma samples obtained from mothers were tested for DENV antibody by an enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA), plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) and a multiplex microsphere immunoassay. All DENV antibody positive plasma samples were also tested for WNV antibody by the same assays to consider the possibility that DENV antibody positive samples reflected WNV cross reactive antibody. The results indicated that 0.74% (11/1,472) of the mothers had a previous DENV infection and that 3.3% (48/1,472) had a previous WNV infection. Of these mothers, 0.20% (3/1,472) had antibody to both DENV and WNV as evidence of infection by both viruses. The results indicated that 0.2% (3/1472) of the mothers were positive for antibody to only WNV envelope, thus suggesting an undetermined flavivirus infection. Although 6 of the 11 DENV antibody positive mothers did not have a history of travel to a DENV endemic country, the findings of this survey provided further evidence of local transmission of WNV and suggested the possibility of focal autochthonous transmission of DENV in the El Paso community."
https://openalex.org/W3107513619,"The Novel-coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-2019) outbreak was declared a national emergency on March 13, 2020. To reduce the spread of the virus, Americans were asked to physically distance and to increase disinfecting behaviors such as hand washing. Previous research indicates that one’s mindset about health, or the degree to which they view health as fixed or modifiable, influences health behaviors. Current data indicates that American Indians (AIs) are at greater risk for COVID-19. As such, it is important to understand whether mindsets about health may affect behaviors which could prevent spread of the virus in AIs. In this exploratory investigation, a convenience sample of two hundred AI adults completed a questionnaire one month prior to the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic as a national emergency. They provided demographic information and completed a measure of health mindsets. The second wave of data was collected approximately one month later, where we collected a measure of physical distancing behavior and a measure of disinfecting behaviors. In AI adults, health mindset predicted frequency of physical distancing behaviors and disinfecting behaviors, with individuals who viewed health as less fixed engaging in more physical distancing and disinfecting behaviors, while individuals who viewed health as more fixed reported less physical distancing and less disinfecting behaviors. In AIs, growth health mindsets predicted physical distancing and disinfecting behaviors, both of which are important in reducing the spread of COVID-19. Interventions which are designed to promote growth mindsets of health may promote health-protective behaviors in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3107776236,"Phymorhynchus is a genus of deep-sea snails that are most distributed in hydrothermal vent or cold seep environments. In this study, we presented the complete mitochondrial genome of P . buccinoides , a cold seep snail from the South China Sea. It is the first mitochondrial genome of a cold seep member of the superfamily Conoidea. The mitochondrial genome is 15,764 bp in length, and contains 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 2 rRNA genes, and 22 tRNA genes. These genes are encoded on the positive strand, except for 8 tRNA genes that are encoded on the negative strand. The start codon ATG and 3 types of stop codons, TAA, TAG and the truncated termination codon T, are used in the 13 PCGs. All 13 PCGs in the 26 species of Conoidea share the same gene order, while several tRNA genes have been translocated. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that P . buccinoides clustered with Typhlosyrinx sp., Eubela sp., and Phymorhynchus sp., forming the Raphitomidae clade, with high support values. Positive selection analysis showed that a residue located in atp6 (18 S) was identified as the positively selected site with high posterior probabilities, suggesting potential adaption to the cold seep environment. Overall, our data will provide a useful resource on the evolutionary adaptation of cold seep snails for future studies."
https://openalex.org/W3106842402,"This study assesses the dollar benefit of a neighborhood approach intervention on disaster risk reduction in small-sized, densely populated, and hazard-prone informal settlements across Latin American and Caribbean countries. We use a life satisfaction approach that assigns a dollar value to gains in wellbeing associated with the neighborhood approach intervention. Our primary data was a survey to a sample of 349 beneficiaries from small towns in Haiti, Guatemala, and Jamaica, and in major cities’ surrounded areas of Peru, Colombia, and Honduras. Out of 14 interventions, we found that community empowerment, physical works in public spaces and urban gardens/food approaches produced a gain of USD1,038 to USD1,241 to individual beneficiaries. Our study suggests a large benefit associated with the neighborhood approach intervention. It also shows that the life satisfaction approach is a promising method for the valuation of non-market and public goods, especially for countries where data on hazards and risks is not available to help monetize risk reductions."
https://openalex.org/W3107113155,"Objectives Non-publication and publication bias are topics of considerable importance to the scientific community. These issues may limit progress toward the 3R principle for animal research, promote waste of public resources, and generate biased interpretations of clinical outcomes. To investigate current publishing practices and to gain some understanding of the extent to which research results are reported, we examined publication rates of research projects that were approved within an internal funding program of the Faculty of Medicine at a university medical center in Germany, which is exemplary for comparable research funding programs for the promotion of young researchers in Germany and Europe. Methods We analyzed the complete set (n = 363) of research projects that were supported by an internal funding program between 2004 and 2013. We divided the projects into four different proposal types that included those that required an ethics vote, those that included an animal proposal, those that included both requirements, and those that included neither requirement. Results We found that 65% of the internally funded research projects resulted in at least one peer-reviewed publication; this increased to 73% if other research contributions were considered, including abstracts, book and congress contributions, scientific posters, and presentations. There were no significant differences with respect to publication rates based on (a) the clinic/institute of the applicant, (b) project duration, (c) scope of funding or (d) proposal type. Conclusion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore publication rates associated with early-career medical research funding. As &gt;70% of the projects ultimately generated some form of publication, the program was overall effective toward this goal; however, non-publication of research results is still prevalent. Further research will explore the reasons underlying non-publication. We hope to use these findings to develop strategies that encourage publication of research results."
https://openalex.org/W3108670221,"The absence of comparable epidemiological data challenges the correct estimation of the prevalence of congenital hearing loss (HL) around the world. Sign language (SL) is known as the main type of communication of deaf people. We suggest that the distribution of SL can be interpreted as an indirect indicator of the prevalence of congenital HL. Since a significant part of congenital HL is due to genetic causes, an assessment of the distribution of SL users can reveal regions with an extensive accumulation of hereditary HL. For the first time, we analyzed the data on the distribution of SL users that became available for the total population of Russia by the 2010 census. Seventy-three out of 85 federal regions of Russia were ranked into three groups by the 25 th and 75 th percentiles of the proportion of SL users: 14 regions—“low proportion”; 48 regions—“average proportion”; and 11 regions—“high proportion”. We consider that the observed uneven prevalence of SL users can reflect underlying hereditary forms of congenital HL accumulated in certain populations by specific genetic background and population structure. At least, the data from this study indicate that the highest proportions of SL users detected in some Siberian regions are consistent with the reported accumulation of specific hereditary HL forms in indigenous Yakut, Tuvinian and Altaian populations."
https://openalex.org/W3109310751,"The concept of coherence was proposed for single-agent phase I clinical trials to describe the property that a design never escalates the dose when the most recently treated patient has toxicity and never de-escalates the dose when the most recently treated patient has no toxicity. It provides a useful theoretical tool for investigating the properties of phase I trial designs. In this paper, we generalize the concept of coherence to drug combination trials, which are substantially different and more challenging than single-agent trials. For example, in the dose-combination matrix, each dose has up to 8 neighboring doses as candidates for dose escalation and de-escalation, and the toxicity orders of these doses are only partially known. We derive sufficient conditions for a model-based drug combination trial design to be coherent. Our results are more general and relaxed than the existing results and are applicable to both single-agent and drug combination trials. We illustrate the application of our theoretical results with a number of drug combination dose-finding designs in the literature."
https://openalex.org/W3109977435,"Spissistilus festinus (Say) (Hemiptera: Membracidae) was shown to transmit Grapevine red blotch virus (GRBV) in a greenhouse study. Grapevines infected with GRBV exhibit reduced sugar accumulation, altered secondary metabolite production and delayed berry maturation that negatively impacts wine quality and economics. Augmentative biocontrol may be a useful integrated pest management (IPM) tool for suppressing S . festinus populations in vineyards, but minimal research has been conducted on testing potential predators against the different life stages of S . festinus . The susceptibility of S . festinus adults and nymphs (1 st through 5 th instar) to predation by six commercially available biocontrol agents in petri dish and bell bean plant arenas was determined under greenhouse conditions. No significant mortality of S . festinus nymphs or adults occurred when exposed to Cryptolaemus montrouzieri adults, C . montrouzieri larvae and Sympherobius barberi adults in petri dish or bell bean plant arenas. Significant mortality of 1 st and 2 nd instar nymphs of S . festinus in the presence of Zelus renardii nymphs was observed in petri dish but not in bell bean arenas. Hippodamia convergens adults and Chrysoperla rufilabris larvae both consumed a significant number of S . festinus nymphs in petri dish and bell bean arenas. No significant predation of S . festinus adults was documented in this experiment. Results of this study aid in identifying predators that may be suitable candidates for additional field testing to determine their potential efficacy as biocontrol agents of S . festinus in a vineyard setting."
