https://openalex.org/W2015498249,"A direct-write “dip-pen” nanolithography (DPN) has been developed to deliver collections of molecules in a positive printing mode. An atomic force microscope (AFM) tip is used to write alkanethiols with 30-nanometer linewidth resolution on a gold thin film in a manner analogous to that of a dip pen. Molecules are delivered from the AFM tip to a solid substrate of interest via capillary transport, making DPN a potentially useful tool for creating and functionalizing nanoscale devices."

https://openalex.org/W2151312020,"The Ras-dependent activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways by many receptors coupled to heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins) requires the activation of Src family tyrosine kinases. Stimulation of β 2 adrenergic receptors resulted in the assembly of a protein complex containing activated c-Src and the receptor. Src recruitment was mediated by β-arrestin, which functions as an adapter protein, binding both c-Src and the agonist-occupied receptor. β-Arrestin 1 mutants, impaired either in c-Src binding or in the ability to target receptors to clathrin-coated pits, acted as dominant negative inhibitors of β 2 adrenergic receptor–mediated activation of the MAP kinases Erk1 and Erk2. These data suggest that β-arrestin binding, which terminates receptor–G protein coupling, also initiates a second wave of signal transduction in which the “desensitized” receptor functions as a critical structural component of a mitogenic signaling complex."

CD28 engagement led to the redistribution and clustering of membrane and intracellular kinase-rich raft microdomains at the site of T cell receptor (TCR) engagements. Although not affecting TCR down-regulation, this process led to higher and more stable tyrosine phosphorylation of several substrates and higher consumption of Lck. These results may provide a general mechanism for amplifying receptor signaling by reorganization of membrane microdomains."

Quantum cutting involving the emission of two visible photons for each vacuum ultraviolet photon absorbed is demonstrated in Eu 3+ -doped LiGdF 4 with the concept of downconversion. Upon excitation of Gd 3+ with a high-energy photon, two visible photons can be emitted by Eu 3+ through an efficient two-step energy transfer from Gd 3+ to Eu 3+ , with a quantum efficiency that approaches 200 percent."
https://openalex.org/W1993103503,"Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) is an autosomal recessive human disease associated with multiple deletions of skeletal muscle mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which have been ascribed to a defect in communication between the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Examination of 12 MNGIE probands revealed homozygous or compound-heterozygous mutations in the gene specifying thymidine phosphorylase (TP), located on chromosome 22q13.32-qter. TP activity in leukocytes from MNGIE patients was less than 5 percent of controls, indicating that loss-of-function mutations in TP cause the disease. The pathogenic mechanism may be related to aberrant thymidine metabolism, leading to impaired replication or maintenance of mtDNA, or both."

The carbon is present as 2- to 5-micrometer graphite globules and has an isotopic composition of delta13C that is about -19 per mil (Pee Dee belemnite standard). These data and the mode of occurrence indicate that the reduced carbon represents biogenic detritus, which was perhaps derived from planktonic organisms."

We postulated that proteins with a high affinity for such an ordered lipid environment might be targeted to rafts. Saturated acyl chains should prefer an extended conformation that would fit well in rafts. In contrast, prenyl groups, which are as hydrophobic as acyl chains but have a branched and bulky structure, should be excluded from rafts. Here, we showed that at least half of the proteins in Madin-Darby canine kidney cell DRMs (other than cytoskeletal contaminants) could be labeled with [3H]palmitate. Association of influenza hemagglutinin with DRMs required all three of its palmitoylated Cys residues. Prenylated proteins, detected by [3H]mevalonate labeling or by blotting for Rap1, Rab5, Gβ, or Ras, were excluded from DRMs. Rab5 and H-Ras each contain more than one lipid group, showing that hydrophobicity alone does not target multiply lipid-modified proteins to DRMs. Partitioning of covalently linked saturated acyl chains into liquid-ordered phase domains is likely to be an important mechanism for targeting proteins to DRMs. Sphingolipid and cholesterol-rich Triton X-100-insoluble membrane fragments (detergent-resistant membranes, DRMs) containing lipids in a state similar to the liquid-ordered phase can be isolated from mammalian cells, and probably exist as discrete domains or rafts in intact membranes.

Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2588) Google Scholar). DRM lipids are in a state similar to the liquid-ordered (lo) phase (3Brown D.A. London E. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 164: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 24Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10944-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). The lophase, which requires cholesterol to form, is favored by lipids like sphingolipids, whose long saturated acyl chains give them a high degree of order and a high acyl-chain melting temperature (3Brown D.A. London E. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 164: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Acyl chain order explains the detergent-insolubility of DRMs (3Brown D.A. London E. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 164: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that DRMs are an in vitro correlate of rafts in intact membranes. It is important to note that detergent insolubility can underestimate the association of proteins and lipids with the lo phase; some proteins and lipids that are in rafts can be solubilized (25Schroeder R.J. Ahmed S.N. Zhu Y. London E. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1150-1157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, DRM association provides a powerful tool for identifying molecules that are likely to have a high affinity for rafts. DRMs isolated from cells contain a number of proteins (27Chang W.-J. Ying Y.-s. Rothberg K.G. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Gambliel H.A. De Gunzburg J. Mumby S.M. Gilman A.G. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 28Lisanti M.P. Tang Z. Sargiacomo M. J.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16161-16170Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) which are undoubtedly crucial for the function of the domains in vivo. For this reason, it is important to determine how proteins associate with DRMs. Three DRM targeting signals have been defined. First, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins are targeted to DRMs through acyl chain interactions (23Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2588) Google Scholar, 24Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 25Schroeder R.J. Ahmed S.N. Zhu Y. London E. Brown D.A. J. Biol.

Biol. 1994; 14: 5384-5391Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). An N-terminal Met-Gly-Cys motif that is present in some Src family kinases and heterotrimeric G protein α subunits, in which Gly is myristoylated and Cys is palmitoylated, can also serve as a DRM targeting signal (31Shenoy-Scaria A.M. Dietzen D.J. Kwong J. Link D.C. Lublin D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 32Milligan G. Parenti M. Magee A.I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 181-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Third, dual palmitoylated Cys residues are required for raft association of the T cell adaptor protein LAT (15Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar) and the neuronal protein GAP-43 (33Arni S. Keilbaugh S.A. Ostermeyer A.G. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28478-28485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The finding that DRM lipids are in an lo-like phase suggests a unifying mechanism for targeting of proteins to DRMs. Proteins with a high affinity for the ordered lipid environment of the lo phase might spontaneously partition into the domains. In agreement with this model, all three of the DRM targeting signals listed above contain two closely spaced acyl chains. Myristate and palmitate, as well as most of the acyl chains on GPI-anchored proteins (34McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar) are saturated, and thus should fit well into ordered lipid domains. This suggests that acylation, especially multiple acylation, may be a general DRM targeting signal. Alternatively, however, it might be imagined that lipid modifications could target proteins to DRMs simply through hydrophobic interactions. Both models predict that many DRM proteins would be linked to lipids. The behavior of prenylated proteins should distinguish between the models, because prenyl groups are as hydrophobic as acyl chains, but have a bulky branched structure that should not fit well into the lo phase. Because of the possibility that multiple hydrophobic modifications are required for DRM targeting, the behavior of dually or multiply lipid-modified proteins that are prenylated is especially informative in this regard. To test these models, we examined the lipid modifications of DRM proteins and the DRM association of prenylated proteins. Mouse monoclonal anti-Rab5 antibodies were the gift of A.

Mutants were named by three letters referring to the amino acids at these positions, respectively; e.g. SCC contains Ser at 536 and Cys at 543 and 546. All mutants incorporate less [3H]palmitate than wild type, and SSS incorporates none (35Naim H.Y. Amarneh B. Ktistakis N.T. Roth M.G. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7585-7588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

H-Ras was expressed transiently in COS-1 cells as described (44Adams G.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1985; 41: 1007-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Metabolic labeling of MDCK cell proteins with [35S]methionine (50 μCi/ml) to steady-state was as described (29Melkonian K.A. Chu T. Tortorella L.B. Brown D.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16161-16170Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). CV-1 cells expressing HA mutants were starved in media lacking Met and Cys for 30 min, pulse labeled for 20 min in media containing 0.6 mCi/ml Tran35S-label, and chased for 40 min in complete medium. Lysis in 1% Triton X-100, immunoprecipitation, analysis, and quantitation were as described (45Lin S. Naim H.Y. Rodriguez A.C. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). For labeling with [3H]palmitic acid, MDCK cells were incubated for 2 h in media supplemented with 5% calf serum, 5 mm pyruvic acid, and 1 mCi/ml [3H]palmitic acid. Short labeling periods were used to minimize conversion of the label to other products. Prior to [3H]mevalonate labeling, cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 20 μm de-lactonized compactin, an inhibitor of mevalonate synthesis (42Faust J. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1996-2004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were then incubated with 78.5 μCi/ml (MDCK) or 31.3 μCi/ml (met-18b-2) [3H]mevalonolactone for 3.5 h at 37 °C in the presence of 20 μmcompactin. For total cell membranes, cells were scraped from dishes, washed in phosphate-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) and then in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA), resuspended in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer, and broken by passage through a 25-gauge needle 40 times. Nuclei and debris were removed by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and light membranes were collected from the supernatant by centrifugation at 120,000 × g for 1 h. Membranes were solubilized directly in gel loading buffer for analysis by SDS-PAGE. For DRMs, cells in 1 confluent 10-cm dish were lysed in 1 ml of TNE buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA) containing 1% Triton X-100 (TNE/Triton X-100), and DRMs were isolated by flotation on sucrose gradients as described (40Arreaza G. Melkonian K.A. LaFevre-Bernt M. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19123-19127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, the lysis buffer and all sucrose gradient solutions were adjusted to pH 11 with 0.1m sodium carbonate. In most cases, the floating membrane band was harvested and diluted to about 12 ml with TNE. Membranes were harvested by centrifugation for 1 h at 120,000 ×g. Alternatively, where indicated 1-ml fractions were collected from the bottom of the sucrose gradient with an ISCO (Lincoln, NB) Model 185 density gradient fractionator. All buffers were ice-cold and contained the following protease inhibitors: 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. For identification of GPI-anchored proteins, DRMs recovered from sucrose gradients were solubilized in TNE containing 1% Triton X-114. GPI-anchored proteins were detected as described (46Lisanti M.P. Sargiacomo M. Graeve L. Saltiel A.R. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9557-9561Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Briefly, phase separation was induced by warming lysates to 37 °C (47Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The aqueous phase was removed, and the detergent phase containing hydrophobic proteins was mixed with fresh TNE and incubated with 10 units/ml phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase for 1 h at 37 °C. The phase separation was repeated, and proteins in the aqueous phase were incubated overnight with phenyl-Sepharose and then precipitated with 15% trichloroacetic acid. DRMs harvested from sucrose gradients and collected by centrifugation as described above were incubated with 1 ml of TNE/Triton X-100 at 37 °C for 5 min. Lysates were subjected to centrifugation at top speed in a microcentrifuge for 5 min. Proteins in the supernatant were precipitated with 15% trichloroacetic acid. Precipitates were washed with acetone and diethyl ether to remove all lipids, solubilized in gel loading buffer, and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE; Ref. 48Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar) on 11% acrylamide gels. Where indicated, replicate lanes from the same gel were incubated with either buffer containing 1 mhydroxylamine and 1 m Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), or 1 mTris-Cl (pH 7.5) alone for 4 h with one change of reagent before processing for fluorography. When gradients were fractionated, 75 μl of each 1-ml fraction was mixed with 25 μl of 4 × gel loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described (25Schroeder R.J. Ahmed S.N. Zhu Y. London E. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1150-1157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Quantitation of signals in the linear range of the film was performed using a Bio-Rad GS-670 imaging densitometer as follows: % of protein in DRMs = cpm in DRMs (gradient fractions 9–12))/cpm in lysate (fractions 1–5) + cpm in DRMs. Although only the region of the blot showing the protein of interest is shown, no other bands were present. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, using non-equilibrium pH gradient electrophoresis in the first dimension and SDS-PAGE in the second dimension, was performed according to Jones (49Jones P.P. Mishell B.B. Shiigi S.M. Selected Methods in Cellular Immunology. Freeman, San Francisco, CA1980: 398-439Google Scholar, 50Jones P.P. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 108: 452-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) after precipitation of proteins with acetone. In some cases, radiolabeled proteins on two-dimensional gels were transferred to nitrocellulose. After detection of Yes or caveolin by Western blotting, the ECL signal was quenched with 0.05% sodium azide. Blots were then air dried, sprayed with Amplify, and exposed to film to detect the [35S]methionine signal. To determine how many DRM proteins from MDCK cells were palmitoylated, cells were incubated with [3H]palmitic acid before preparation of DRMs. For comparison, DRMs were also prepared from cells incubated with [35S]methionine to metabolically label all proteins. DRM proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorography (Fig. 1). As previously reported (29Melkonian K.A. Chu T. Tortorella L.B. Brown D.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16161-16170Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), about 20–25 major proteins were observed (lane 1). Many of the proteins were labeled with palmitate (lane 2). The same pattern of [3H]palmitate-labeled proteins was also observed in DRMs prepared without sodium carbonate at pH 7.5 (data not shown). In initial experiments, we also labeled cells with [3H]myristate using a similar protocol, in an attempt to visualize N-myristoylated proteins in DRMs. Many of the proteins that were labeled with [3H]palmitate also incorporated [3H]myristate (not shown). However,S-acylated proteins can be labeled artifactually with [3H]myristate (51Gu X. Trigatti B. Xu S. Acton S. Babitt J. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26338-26348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and we were unable to show that [3H]myristate labeling of DRM proteins was specific. For this reason, these studies were not pursued further. It was important to verify that the [3H]palmitate label was present as thioester-linked fatty acid. Thus, proteins labeled with either [3H]palmitate or [35S]methionine were separated on the same gel and treated with or without hydroxylamine, which cleaves thioester bonds (52Pepperberg D.R. Morrison D.F. O'Brien P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 348-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), as shown in Fig.2. As expected, the [35S]methionine label was resistant to hydroxylamine (compare lanes 1 and 2) while the [3H]palmitate label was removed (compare lanes 3 and 4). We next determined how many of the palmitoylated proteins in the cell were present in DRMs. Cells were incubated with [3H]palmitate and lysed. DRMs were then prepared after saving a small fraction of the whole cell lysate. Both fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography (Fig.3). Very different patterns of labeled proteins were seen in whole cell lysate and DRMs. Thus, only a subset of palmitoylated proteins associated efficiently with DRMs. We extended our analysis of DRM proteins using two-dimensional gels, separating [35S]methionine-labeled proteins in the first dimension by non-equilibrium pH gradient electrophoresis, and in the second by size by conventional SDS-PAGE. We first compared total cell proteins (Fig. 4 A) with DRM proteins prepared from cells with or without carbonate during detergent extraction (Fig. 4, B and C). For orientation, MDCK cells stably expressing the GPI-anchored protein PLAP were used in this experiment. PLAP was prominent among the DRM proteins (Fig. 4,B and C), and could be detected in the whole cell lysate after long exposure (not shown). Ten proteins that were especially abundant in the whole cell lysate (Fig. 4 A, arrows) were detected in DRMs prepared without carbonate (Fig. 4 B, asterisks). These are likely to be cytoskeletal or other structural proteins. Consistent with this possibility, fibrous material could sometimes be observed in DRM preparations by electron microscopy (not shown). Most of these proteins were present in lower abundance in DRMs prepared with carbonate (Fig.4 C, asterisks). Actin, the most abundant cellular protein, was among these proteins. Actin could also be detected in DRMs on one-dimensional gels by Western blotting (not shown). Although these abundant proteins may associate specifically with DRMs, it is likely instead that they adhere nonspecifically during DRM preparation. Finding these 10 abundant proteins in DRMs raised the possibility that most of the spots on our two-dimensional gels were contaminants. Proteins that associated specifically with DRMs, and were enriched there, might be present at such low levels that they could not be seen. To test this idea, as described next, we identified several proteins that are known to associate specifically with DRMs. Our ability to detect these proteins suggested that many of the other spots also corresponded to bona fide DRM proteins. We first examined [35S]methionine-labeled GPI-anchored proteins released from DRMs by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase treatment (Fig.5 B). (No proteins were observed when phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase was omitted from the reaction (not shown).) These were analyzed in parallel with total [35S]methionine-labeled DRM proteins (Fig.5 A). (For orientation, major cell proteins identified in Fig. 4 are labeled with asterisks.) As found by others (53Fiedler K. Kobayashi T. Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6365-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), GPI-anchored proteins of 50 and 80 kDa could be detected in the whole DRM pattern by alignment of the films. These are labeled GPI in Fig. 5,A and C. We next identified two known DRM proteins on two-dimensional gels by Western blotting. DRM proteins from [35S]methionine-labeled MDCK cells were separated on two-dimensional gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. The positions of the Src family non-receptor tyrosine kinase Yes and of caveolin, a marker for caveolae (4Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

Blots were then exposed to film for detection of all [35S]methionine-labeled DRM proteins. Alignment of the films allowed identification of Yes and caveolin in the [35S]methionine-labeled pattern. Spots corresponding to Yes and caveolin (labeled Cav) are labeled in Fig. 5, A andC. (The caveolin spot is faint because much of the caveolin was in a high molecular weight oligomeric form (55Monier S. Parton R.G. Vogel F. Behlke J. Henske A. Kurzchalia T.V. Mol. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2103250872,"The receptive field of a visual neuron is classically defined as the region of space (or retina) where a visual stimulus evokes a change in its firing activity. At the cortical level, a challenging issue concerns the roles of feedforward, local recurrent, intracortical, and cortico-cortical feedback connectivity in receptive field properties. Intracellular recordings in cat area 17 showed that the visually evoked synaptic integration field extends over a much larger area than that established on the basis of spike activity. Synaptic depolarizing responses to stimuli flashed at increasing distances from the center of the receptive field decreased in strength, whereas their onset latency increased. These findings suggest that subthreshold responses in the unresponsive region surrounding the classical discharge field result from the integration of visual activation waves spread by slowly conducting horizontal axons within primary visual cortex."

Down-regulation of the expression of H-ferritin gene was required for cell transformation by c-MYC.

https://openalex.org/W2007604907,"Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) has been shown to play an important role in preventing the development of cancer. MnSOD activity is reduced in many transformed cells and tumor tissues. We previously showed that the reduced level of MnSOD activity in cancer cells was not due to a defect in the primary structure of MnSOD protein, but rather was due to defects in gene expression. To elucidate the cause for the reduced expression of human MnSOD in cancer, we investigated the nucleotide sequence in the regulatory region of the MnSOD gene in a normal human cell line and various human tumor cell lines. A DNA fragment spanning 3.4 kb 5′ flanking region of the MnSOD gene isolated from a normal human genomic DNA library was used to determine the DNA sequence of MnSOD promoter. PCR primers were used for amplification of the 3.4 kb 5′ flanking region of the human MnSOD gene in cancer cells. Sequence analysis identified three heterozygous mutations in the proximal region of the promoter in five human tumor cell lines. These mutations, clustered around the GC-rich region of the human MnSOD promoter, change the binding pattern of AP-2 and lead to a reduction in transcription activity using a luciferase reporter assay system. These results suggest that the reduced level of MnSOD expression in some tumor cells is, at least in part, due to a defect in the DNA sequence of the promoter region."
https://openalex.org/W2090275853,"JCV is a papovavirus which is widespread in the human population. The prototype Mad-1 variant of JCV induces a fatal demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) called Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) in immunosuppressed individuals. The unique tropism of JCV (Mad-1) to the CNS is attributed to the tissue-specific regulation of the viral early promoter which is responsible for the production of the viral regulatory protein, T-antigen. The archetype form of this virus, JCV(CY), which has been repeatedly isolated from the urine of PML and non-PML individuals, is distinct from JCV(Mad-1) in the structural organization of the regulatory sequence. To characterize the tissue specific expression of JCV(CY) and to investigate its potential in inducing disease, transgenic mice containing the early region of JCV(CY) were generated. Some of these mice between 9 – 13 months of age exhibited signs of illness as manifested by paralysis of rear limbs, hunched posture, and poor grooming. Neuropathological examination indicated no sign of hypomyelination of the brain, but surprisingly, revealed the presence of primitive tumors originating from the cerebellum and the surrounding brain stem. The tumor masses also infiltrated the surrounding tissue. Results from RNA and protein studies revealed a high level of T-antigen mRNA expression in hindbrains of clinically normal and affected transgenic mice. However, higher levels of T-antigen RNA and protein were detected in brains of the animals exhibiting severe illness. The close resemblance of JCV(CY) induced tumor in transgenic mice to the human medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNETs) in location, histologic appearance, and expression of marker proteins strongly suggests the utility of this novel animal model for the study of human brain tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2128797396,"Rho family GTPases are known to be involved in cytoskeletal reorganization. We examined the possibility that these functions may be dictated by a balance of Rho family GTPase signaling. Using transient viral expression of RhoA, Rac1, Cdc42 and their mutants, as well as C3 exoenzyme, we altered cytoskeletal organization under normal growth conditions. Overexpression of wild-type or constitutively active forms of the Rho family GTPases led to their respective activation phenotypes. Overexpression of dominant negative forms of given Rho family GTPases led to a phenotype consistent with activation of the other Rho family GTPase. Treatment with C. difficile toxin A, that inactivates all Rho family GTPases, led to the transient appearance of a variety of activation phenotypes. Previously, we reported that inactivation of Rho led to induction of apoptosis, implying that Rho may play an important role in cell survival signaling. This signaling, however, is not affected by expression of any forms of Rac1 or Cdc42, and only inactivation of Rho led to induction of apoptosis. Rho family GTPases appear to coordinate cytoskeletal organization by a balance of signaling, while cell survival is regulated by a distinct Rho-mediated signaling pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1973536070,"Constitutive activation of the ras proto-oncogene is a frequent and early event in colon cancers, but the downstream nuclear targets are not fully understood. The Cdx-1 and Cdx-2 homeobox genes play crucial roles in intestinal cell proliferation and differentiation. In addition, Cdx-2 is a colonic tumour-suppressor gene, whereas Cdx-1 has oncogenic potential. Here, we show that constitutive activation of ras alters Cdx-1 and Cdx-2 expression in human colonic Caco-2 and HT-29 cells that harbour a normal ras proto-oncogene. Oncogenic ras downregulates Cdx-2 through activation of the PKC pathway and a decline in activity of the Cdx-2 promoter AP-1 site. This decline results from a PKC-dependent decrease in the relative expression of c-Jun, an activator of Cdx-2 transcription, compared to c-Fos, an inhibitor of Cdx-2. Unlike Cdx-2, Cdx-1 is upregulated by oncogenic ras and this effect is mediated by activation of the MEK1 pathway. These results indicate that oncogenic ras activation has opposite effects on Cdx-1 and Cdx-2 expression through distinct signalling pathways and they provide the first evidence for a functional link between ras activation and the downregulation of the Cdx-2 tumour-suppressor gene in colon cancer cells."

https://openalex.org/W1996778004,The subcrustal lithosphere underlying the southern Archean Churchill Province (ACP) in western Canada is at least one order of magnitude more electrically conductive than the lithosphere beneath adjacent Paleoproterozoic crust. The measured electrical properties of the lithosphere underlying most of the Paleoproterozoic crust can be explained by the conductivity of olivine. Mantle xenolith and geological mapping evidence indicate that the lithosphere beneath the southern ACP was substantially modified as a result of being trapped between two nearly synchronous Paleoproterozoic subduction zones. Tectonically induced metasomatism thus may have enhanced the subcrustal lithosphere conductivity of the southern ACP.

These mutants were used to define the domains required for transformation of rat embryonal fibroblasts (REF) in cooperation with activated Ha-ras and and to establish correlations with defined biochemical properties of cyclin D1. Protein binding and REF assays showed that the region of the cyclin box required for the interaction with CDK4 as well as C-terminal sequences determining protein stability were crucial for transformation. Surprisingly, however, the N-terminal deletion of 20 amino acids which impaired pRb kinase activity did not affect the transforming ability of cyclin D1. Likewise, no effect on transformation was observed with mutants defective in p21CIP interaction. These observations argue against a crucial role of pRb inactivation or p21CIP squelching in cyclin D1-mediated transformation."

In fact, the C terminus of p53 (amino acids 293–393) was functionally replaceable with a foreign dimerization domain in IDL binding assays.

Cell. 1995; 81: 1013-1020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar); these diverse associations may be critical to p53 signal transduction. The ability of p53 to bind ssDNA is of interest because this form of DNA is an intermediate of both DNA damage and repair. Studies have correlated p53 signaling activation with both the timing and amount of DNA strand breaks. Nelson and Kastan (32Nelson W.G. Kastan M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar) have shown that p53 levels increased after electroporation of enzymatically active restriction endonucleases into cells. Microinjection of single-stranded circular phagemid or circular DNA with a large gap into nuclei of normal human fibroblasts induced a p53-dependent G1 arrest (33Huang L.C. Clarkin K.C. Wahl G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4827-4832Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Jayaraman and Prives (34Jayaraman L. Prives C. Cell. 1995; 81: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) reported stimulation of p53 consensus site binding in vitro in the presence of short ssDNA fragments. Further proof that p53 may directly interact with damaged DNA was provided in a study reporting p53 binding to DNA fragments containing insertion/deletion lesions (31Lee S. Elenbaas B. Levine A. Griffith J. Cell. 1995; 81: 1013-1020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Also, confocal microscopy studies have shown co-localization of p53 protein with sites of damaged DNA in histological sections of human skin exposed to UV light (35Coates P.J. Save V. Ansari B. Hall P.A. J. Pathol. 1995; 176: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Collectively, these reports suggest that p53 may be directly or indirectly regulated by DNA damage intermediates. A direct interaction of p53 with either DNA lesions or with proteins that bind damage intermediates may be a relevant upstream event in the biochemical engagement of the protein.In this study, we analyzed the interaction of p53 with DNA fragments containing insertion/deletion lesions. In contrast to many studies that have shown p53 C-terminal binding to ssDNA or DNA lesions, we demonstrate that an intact central domain and dimerization capability are required for wild-type (wt) human p53 binding to IDLs. The results of our binding analyses demonstrate that the affinity of p53 for DNA fragments containing either an IDL or a consensus site is in the pm range. Competition binding assays revealed that p53-IDL complexes were dissociated with relatively low concentrations of consensus site-containing DNA. However, the number and availability of each DNA site immediately after DNA damage may promote p53 binding to DNA lesions in lieu of sequence-specific DNA binding.RESULTSTo study p53-IDL interactions, we used an in vitroprotein-DNA binding assay developed by McKay (36McKay R.D.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 471-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) that allows for quantitative analysis. The DNA lesions in this study were the same that Lee et al. (31Lee S. Elenbaas B. Levine A. Griffith J. Cell. 1995; 81: 1013-1020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) used to demonstrate p53 binding to IDLs through gel shift and electron microscope analyses. Random sequence, double-stranded DNA fragments with either one (C3) or three (3C3) sets of triplet cytosines in one of the strands were used; the extra bases caused a nucleotide loop in the DNA duplex.Full-Length p53 Binds to DNA Fragments Containing IDLsp53 protein produced in either baculoviral or yeast overexpression systems bound to DNA fragments containing IDLs at a level proportional to the number of triple cytosine loops in the DNA (compare middleand right panels of Fig. 1). Comparable p53 binding activity was also seen using DNA fragments of different sequence context that contained a triple cytosine loop (data not shown). p53 did not bind to a control DNA duplex without triplet cytosines (see the first panelof Fig. 1). There was minimal DNA binding activity detected with control immunoprecipitates from yeast and Sf9 extracts lacking p53 protein (Fig. 1, seeProtein Con lanes). The p53273 tumor-derived mutant form of p53 was also tested in the assay and did not exhibit significant binding to DNA fragments containing IDLs.Tumor-derived Mutant Forms of p53 Lack C3 Binding ActivityThe lack of IDL binding by the p53273protein prompted us to screen other p53 proteins with point mutations in the central domain. Four mutant p53 proteins representative of tumor-derived forms were produced in yeast and immunopurified, and equivalent amounts of protein were analyzed in the binding assay (Fig.2 B). We found that all four mutant p53 proteins had <5% of the wt p53 binding activity to the C3 IDL (Fig. 2 A). These data suggest that full-length p53 requires an intact central domain to bind DNA fragments containing IDLs. However, these results do not rule out the possibility that the p53 C terminus, as a separate entity, can also bind IDLs, as previously reported by Lee et al. (31Lee S. Elenbaas B. Levine A. Griffith J. Cell. 1995; 81: 1013-1020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar).Figure 2Tumor-derived mutant p53 proteins lack C3 binding activity.

Up to 40 amino acids could be deleted from the C terminus of p53 without loss of protein binding to IDLs (Fig. 3 A; see 1–353). In fact, deletion of 20 amino acids from the C terminus increased binding activity by more than 2-fold over wt p53 (Fig. 3 A; see1–373). However, deletions of 50 or 60 amino acids resulted in 90% loss of IDL binding (Fig. 3 A; see 1–343and 1–333).Figure 3Deletion of the C-terminal 40 amino acids of p53 abrogates C3 binding.

Brian R. Addison C. Rudge K. Remm M. Grimaldi M. Keenan E. Jenkins J.R. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1513-1523PubMed Google Scholar), must be intact for this p53 activity. To determine which of these two properties was necessary for p53-IDL binding, we used chimeric proteins containing various C-terminal-truncated p53 fused to the coil-coil (CC) dimerization domain of the yeast transcription factor GCN4 (residues 249–281) (38Ellenberger T.E. Brandl C.J. Struhl K. Harrison S.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 1223-1237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar) for further analyses (Fig.4 A). p53-CC fusion proteins with deletions up to 100 amino acids from the p53 C terminus were able to bind IDLs (Fig. 4 B). In fact, the p53-CC fusion proteins 293CC, 323CC, 333CC, 343CC displayed binding activities ∼2–4-fold greater than wt protein. However, despite the enhanced binding seen with these fusion proteins, a single point mutation in the central domain of the p53 portion of the chimeric protein resulted in 90% loss of IDL binding (Fig. 4 A, compare 343CC to 347CC175). Fusion proteins with p53 C-terminal deletions greater than 100 amino acids (273CC and 283CC) had less than 10% wt binding activity; these p53 deletions disrupted the central DNA binding domain, which is encompassed by residues 100–300 (39Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2130) Google Scholar). Thus, the data suggest that full-length p53 binding to IDLs requires an intact central domain and that the entire C terminus of p53 is functionally replaceable with a foreign dimerization domain in these assaysFigure 4The dimerization domain of p53 can be replaced by the coiled-coil domain of the yeast transcription factor GCN4.

Elenbaas B. Levine A. Griffith J. Cell. 1995; 81: 1013-1020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). To determine the relative binding activities of full-length p53 and the C-terminal fragment, we assayed the C3 binding properties of wt human p53 and three forms of murine p53 produced in Sf9 cells: full-length p53, amino acids 1–360, and amino acids 315–390 (40Wang Y. Schwedes J.F. Parks D. Mann K. Tegtmeyer P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2157-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Binding assays were performed with equimolar amounts of p53 protein incubated with the C3 DNA fragment (Fig. 5). Murine and human wt p53 had equal C3 binding activity. Similar to our results with human p53 C-terminal truncation mutants (Fig. 3 A), partial deletion of the C terminus of murine p53 significantly lowered C3 binding ability. Consistent with the results of Lee et al. (31Lee S. Elenbaas B. Levine A. Griffith J. Cell. 1995; 81: 1013-1020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), we found that the C-terminal fragment of p53 could bind C3, albeit with less than 10% full-length p53 IDL binding activity.Figure 5C3 binding activity of full-length p53 and the C-terminal fragment.

Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar) and the report of nm affinities for p53 binding to derivatives of its consensus site (42Bargonetti J. Reynisdóttir I. Friedman P.N. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1886-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The lack of significant C3 binding by tumor-derived mutant forms of p53 suggests this activity, like the p53 consensus binding, may be biologically relevant. To determine whether IDL binding occurs in a physiologic range, we performed saturation binding assays to compare the affinity of full-length, wt human p53 for its consensus site with that for C3. The p53 binding site in the p21 promoter (nucleotides 2293–2332) was used for consensus binding analyses. Using 0.1 pmol of p53 protein and increasing amounts (0.5 to 750 pm) of labeled DNA, we determined that the K D for p53 binding to its consensus site was 31 pm (Fig.6 A), and theK D for p53 binding to the C3 DNA was 45 pm (Fig. 6 B). Transformation of the saturation binding isotherms into linear Scatchard plots facilitates the comparison of p53 binding to the two DNA fragments (Fig.6 C). Although the binding affinity and capacity of p53 for its consensus site are higher than those for C3, bothK D values represent physiologically significant binding.Figure 6p53 affinity for DNA fragments containing IDLs. Binding assays were performed by incubating 0.1 pmol of p53 with increasing amounts of either A, p53 consensus site representing nucleotides 2293–2332 of the p21 promoter; orB, C3 DNA fragment. K Drepresents the concentration of p53 required to reach half-maximal binding of the DNA. B max is the maximal binding. The equation used to plot the data represents a rectangular hyperbolic function, indicative of binding that follows the mass action law:Y = B max ×X/(K D + X). Scatchard analysis was perfomed on the saturation-binding isotherms, and the linear representation of the data is seen in panel C. Results are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Competition of p53 DNA BindingTo confirm the relative affinities determined using saturation binding curves and to study the DNA binding property of p53 when both a consensus DNA site and IDL DNA site were available, competition binding assays were performed. Under equilibrium conditions, p53 was first bound to the radiolabeled C3 DNA fragment, and increasing concentrations of either unlabeled consensus site, C3, or a random sequence dsDNA fragment were added. p53 was efficiently competed off of C3after addition of consensus site DNA with an EC50 of 0.14 nm (Fig. 7). The EC50 for the C3 DNA fragment competition of prebound C3 DNA was 0.50 nm (Fig.7). In contrast, a random sequence dsDNA fragment was an ineffective competitor for C3 binding. The EC50for this latter competition assay could not be accurately assessed because 50% competition was difficult to attain (Fig. 7). Also, in these assays, ssDNA was not an effective competitor as compared with C3 (data not shown). These data demonstrate that p53 has a higher affinity for its consensus site as compared with an IDL site and will likely bind to the former if both DNA sites are present, with all other variables remaining constant.Figure 7Dissociation of p53-IDL complexes by competitor DNA. Competition assays were performed at equilibrium binding conditions of p53 binding to the C3 fragment. After binding the 32P-end-labeled C3 DNA fragment, increasing concentrations of either unlabeled control, consensus site, or C3 DNA fragments were incubated with the complex. EC50 represents the concentration of competitor that reduced p53-DNA binding by 50%. Competition assays were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software. The equation used to plot the data is indicative of competition of binding to a single site:Y = Bottom + (Top-Bottom)/(1 + 10(X − EC50)).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn this study, we analyzed p53 binding to DNA fragments containing IDLs. We found that full-length p53 requires an intact central domain and dimerization capability to bind IDLs. Tumor-derived mutant forms of p53 lost IDL binding, and C-terminal truncation mutants still bound IDLs if the protein maintained dimerization capability. The pm dissociation constant that we observed for p53 binding to IDLs provides evidence for potential in vivorelevance.Previously, the C terminus of p53 (amino acids 311–393) was shown to bind IDLs (35Coates P.J. Save V. Ansari B. Hall P.A. J. Pathol. 1995; 176: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Reed et al. (43Reed M. Woelker B. Wang P. Wang Y. Anderson M.E. Tegtmeyer P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9455-9459Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) also find that the C terminus of p53 binds nonspecifically to dsDNA (43Reed M. Woelker B. Wang P. Wang Y. Anderson M.E. Tegtmeyer P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9455-9459Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). These data contribute to a model suggesting that the p53 C terminus negatively regulates the sequence-specific binding activity of the protein. When the p53 C-terminal end is deleted, phosphorylated, acetylated, or bound to antibody, peptide, or single-stranded DNA, p53 binding to its consensus site is stimulated (18Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E.

Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Although we demonstrated that the C terminus of murine p53 could bind IDLs, an equimolar amount of murine p53 lacking the C terminus had greater affinity for IDLs than the C-terminal fragment alone.Our finding that the C terminus of p53 is not required for IDL binding is in agreement with the study of Parks et al. (45Parks D. Bolinger R. Mann K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1289-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) demonstrating that p53 binding to IDLs was unaffected by PAb421, a monoclonal antibody that binds the C-terminal amino acids 371–380.

Given the evidence for an interplay between environmental and genetic factors in esophageal squamous carcinogenesis, the aim of this study was to determine the potential cooperation of the nitrosamine compound N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine (NMBA), an esophageal specific carcinogen, in the cyclin D1 transgenic mice. NMBA was first demonstrated to induce dysplasia in two strains of inbred mice, C57BL/6 and FVB/N. Subcutaneous NMBA was then administrated to wild type and transgenic mice beginning at 4 weeks of age. Mice were monitered for the duration of the study for general appearance, activity and weight, and were euthanized at 12 and 15 months. Histopathologic analysis revealed increased severity of dysplasia in cyclin D1 mice treated with NMBA compared with treated age-matched wild-type mice and untreated mice. There was also increased proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression in the esophagi of NMBA treated cyclin D1 mice. Taken together, these findings suggest that a genetic alteration, specifically cyclin D1 overexpression and a chemical carinogen, NMBA, may cooperate to increase the severity of esophageal squamous dysplasia, a prominent precursor to carcinoma."

Aberrant FHIT mRNA transcripts were observed in 14/16 (88%) leukaemia cell lines, 43/55 (78%) primary haematological neoplasms, but also in 17/22 (77%) normal controls. 1/16 (6%) cell lines and 7/55 (13%) neoplasms did not express any FHIT mRNA. cDNA sequencing revealed exonic deletions, small DNA insertions and combinations of both. Analysis of genomic DNA showed gene deletions in two myeloid leukaemia cell lines. In contrast to all normal types of haematopoietic cells, FHIT protein was clearly reduced or absent in 8/18 (44%) neoplastic samples tested. Our data indicate that whilst aberrant FHIT mRNA transcripts are seen both in normal and malignant cells, lack of FHIT protein is restricted to leukaemia. Absent FHIT protein expression might contribute to leukaemogenesis."

To elucidate the possible in vivo function of this distinct short tailed c-myc mRNA population, the polyadenylation inhibitor cordycepin was used. This resulted in a decline in steady state c-myc mRNA levels with the remaining messenger mostly oligoadenylated. However, c-MYC proteins did not follow the reduction of the c-myc mRNA. On the other hand, in cells exposed to physiological agents known to downregulate c-myc expression, the reduction of mRNA steady state levels, was reflected upon c-MYC protein levels. The dissociation between c-myc mRNA and protein levels caused by cordycepin was not due to the stabilization of the c-MYC proteins and was not an indiscriminate effect since in the presence of cordycepin, c-fos mRNA and protein levels concomitantly declined. Our data indicate that under these conditions, a long poly(A) tail is not instrumental for c-myc mRNA translation and furthermore, the discrepancy in the steady state of c-myc mRNA level: c-MYC protein ratio between control cells and cells treated with cordycepin indicates that c-myc mRNA is subjected to translational control."

To identify regions within the 370 amino acid Wnt-1 protein required for these functions we tested eleven chimeric genes that contained variable amounts of Wnt-1 and Wnt-5a sequence. Transformation and β-catenin regulation in C57MG cells is controlled by amino acids that lie within 186 residues of the amino terminus of Wnt-1. Small substitutions between residues 186 and 292 reduced Wnt-1 activity. Replacement of the carboxy terminal 79 amino acids of Wnt-1 by Wnt-5a did not affect function. These results were supported by transient expression asssays in 293 cells wherein β-catenin accumulated in the cytoplasm in response to ectopic Wnt-1 expression. In 293 cells, a larger region of the amino-terminus of Wnt-1 was found to be required for β-catenin regulation. Nonfunctional chimeras that contained at least 99 amino terminal Wnt-1 residues inhibited Wnt-1 stimulation of 293 cells. One of these chimeras inhibited both Wnt-1 and Wnt-3 activity suggesting that Wnt-1 and Wnt-3 interact with a common signaling component."

Europa, a moon farther away and heated less, may support a water ocean larger than those on Earth. In his Perspective, Chapman discusses recent efforts to understand Europa9s surface by studying the impact craters that have been observed there. The appearance of many craters could be explained if the surface ice layer were 10 to 15 kilometers thick, according to recent computer simulations."
https://openalex.org/W1491710710,"If cloning technologies were software releases, you could say that two major versions have been created to date. Version 1.0 would probably include the basic techniques of cloning: using plasmids, restriction enzymes, and so on. Intermediate releases, say 1.1 to 1.5 came about with the improvement of vectors to detect inserts and the conversion of lambda clones. Version 2.0 came into being when the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was developed in the late 1980s. PCR technology provided methods to better refine the DNA molecules to be inserted. It allowed novel molecules to be created in vitro that would be difficult or impossible to produce any other way. What, then, can we expect to find in the next “release” of cloning technology? A group led by Steve Elledge at Baylor College of Medicine ([1][1]) may have just answered this question and, in the process, ushered in a novel set of molecular technologies for the post-genome era.

One of the major tasks for a molecular biologist is moving known pieces of DNA from one cloning vector to another to create various fusions and clones. In the process, a researcher may use PCR to design joining segments, internal mutations, and other elements. All of these version 2.0 tasks rely on careful, custom construction by the genetic engineer. Many common DNA constructs (reporter fusions, GST fusions, myc-tag fusions) could be made more easily if a standard set of plasmids and manipulations were available. However, moving passenger DNA between template plasmids by restriction digests requires detailed knowledge of the passenger DNA, which is not always available. Also, as whole-genome research (for example, the Human Genome Project) progresses, cloning techniques to manipulate entire genomes become necessary.

The method proposed by Q. Liu et al. ([1][1]), the Univector Plasmid-fusion System (UPS), generates a new approach to cloning. Basically, they devised a highly scalable system in which site-specific recombination is used to rapidly generate new fusion proteins. Instead of using restriction enzymes and DNA ligase to cut and paste DNA molecules, they used Cre recombinase, a protein that can catalyze the joining of two sequences that each have a defined 34-base pair (bp) sequence called loxP.

They first intoduced their gene into the Univector (pUNI) in the form loxP-GENE-Kanr-Ori. The gene is placed in-frame with the open reading frame of loxP. Next, they made a collection of pHOST vectors that had a DNA sequence in the form Promoter-Tag-loxP-Ampr-Ori. They then mixed a pUNI clone in vitro with a pHOST plasmid and Cre protein. The result was a highly efficient, 20-min recombination reaction that produced a fusion plasmid joined at the loxP sites. The reading frame of the loxP site on pHOST, pUNI, and the Tag sequences are the same, so that fusion of pUNI and pHOST results in the creation of both a promoter-gene fusion and a protein-protein fusion. Furthermore, through genetic trickery, they devised a selection process through which only fusion plasmids grow upon transformation. The fusion reaction is so efficient that they can transfer a whole library in pUNI into a different vector without loss of representation.

Thus, with a simple, systematic, and easily reproduced in vitro reaction, they were able to generate a large collection of gene fusions with little knowledge of the chosen gene's sequence. Once a gene is inserted properly into pUNI, there is no more need to worry about its sequence, its reading frame, or the recipient vector. There is also no need for more fragment isolations or ligations; only a 20-min reaction is required.

This technique now allows the systematic manipulation of large gene sets or even complete sets of full-length complementary DNAs from a particular species (so-called “Unigene” sets). This capability will become even more important as we progress into the postgenome era of proteomics. The paper also contains a must-read collection of additional molecular biology tips and tricks that no graduate student should be without.
