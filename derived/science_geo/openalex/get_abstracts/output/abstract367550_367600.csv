https://openalex.org/W2008631743,"It is well established that the intestinal microbiota plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Epidemiological studies have provided strong evidence that IBD patients bear increased risk for the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the impact of the microbiota on the development of colitis-associated cancer (CAC) remains largely unknown. In this study, we established a new model of CAC using azoxymethane (AOM)-exposed, conventionalized-Il10(-/-) mice and have explored the contribution of the host intestinal microbiota and MyD88 signaling to the development of CAC. We show that 8/13 (62%) of AOM-Il10(-/-) mice developed colon tumors compared to only 3/15 (20%) of AOM- wild-type (WT) mice. Conventionalized AOM-Il10(-/-) mice developed spontaneous colitis and colorectal carcinomas while AOM-WT mice were colitis-free and developed only rare adenomas. Importantly, tumor multiplicity directly correlated with the presence of colitis. Il10(-/-) mice mono-associated with the mildly colitogenic bacterium Bacteroides vulgatus displayed significantly reduced colitis and colorectal tumor multiplicity compared to Il10(-/-) mice. Germ-free AOM-treated Il10(-/-) mice showed normal colon histology and were devoid of tumors. Il10(-/-); Myd88(-/-) mice treated with AOM displayed reduced expression of Il12p40 and Tnfalpha mRNA and showed no signs of tumor development. We present the first direct demonstration that manipulation of the intestinal microbiota alters the development of CAC. The TLR/MyD88 pathway is essential for microbiota-induced development of CAC. Unlike findings obtained using the AOM/DSS model, we demonstrate that the severity of chronic colitis directly correlates to colorectal tumor development and that bacterial-induced inflammation drives progression from adenoma to invasive carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2035139662,"The mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR) kinase plays a key role in translational control of a subset of mRNAs through regulation of its initiation step. In neurons, mTOR is present at the synaptic region, where it modulates the activity-dependent expression of locally-translated proteins independently of mRNA synthesis. Indeed, mTOR is necessary for different forms of synaptic plasticity and long-term memory (LTM) formation. However, little is known about the time course of mTOR activation and the extracellular signals governing this process or the identity of the proteins whose translation is regulated by this kinase, during mnemonic processing.Here we show that consolidation of inhibitory avoidance (IA) LTM entails mTOR activation in the dorsal hippocampus at the moment of and 3 h after training and is associated with a rapid and rapamycin-sensitive increase in AMPA receptor GluR1 subunit expression, which was also blocked by intra-hippocampal delivery of GluR1 antisense oligonucleotides (ASO). In addition, we found that pre- or post-training administration of function-blocking anti-BDNF antibodies into dorsal CA1 hampered IA LTM retention, abolished the learning-induced biphasic activation of mTOR and its readout, p70S6K and blocked GluR1 expression, indicating that BDNF is an upstream factor controlling mTOR signaling during fear-memory consolidation. Interestingly, BDNF ASO hindered LTM retention only when given into dorsal CA1 1 h after but not 2 h before training, suggesting that BDNF controls the biphasic requirement of mTOR during LTM consolidation through different mechanisms: an early one involving BDNF already available at the moment of training, and a late one, happening around 3 h post-training that needs de novo synthesis of this neurotrophin.IN CONCLUSION, OUR FINDINGS DEMONSTRATE THAT: 1) mTOR-mediated mRNA translation is required for memory consolidation during at least two restricted time windows; 2) this kinase acts downstream BDNF in the hippocampus and; 3) it controls the increase of synaptic GluR1 necessary for memory consolidation."
https://openalex.org/W2056338502,"The communication of stress/anxiety between conspecifics through chemosensory signals has been documented in many vertebrates and invertebrates. Here, we investigate how chemosensory anxiety signals conveyed by the sweat of humans (N = 49) awaiting an academic examination are processed by the human brain, as compared to chemosensory control signals obtained from the same sweat donors in a sport condition. The chemosensory stimuli were pooled according to the donation condition and administered to 28 participants (14 males) synchronously to breathing via an olfactometer. The stimuli were perceived with a low intensity and accordingly only about half of the odor presentations were detected by the participants. The fMRI results (event-related design) show that chemosensory anxiety signals activate brain areas involved in the processing of social emotional stimuli (fusiform gyrus), and in the regulation of empathic feelings (insula, precuneus, cingulate cortex). In addition, neuronal activity within attentional (thalamus, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex) and emotional (cerebellum, vermis) control systems were observed. The chemosensory perception of human anxiety seems to automatically recruit empathy-related resources. Even though the participants could not attentively differentiate the chemosensory stimuli, emotional contagion seems to be effectively mediated by the olfactory system."
https://openalex.org/W2064995753,"In addition to rods and cones, the human retina contains light-sensitive ganglion cells that express melanopsin, a photopigment with signal transduction mechanisms similar to that of invertebrate rhabdomeric photopigments (IRP). Like fly rhodopsins, melanopsin acts as a dual-state photosensitive flip-flop in which light drives both phototransduction responses and chromophore photoregeneration that bestows independence from the retinoid cycle required by rods and cones to regenerate photoresponsiveness following bleaching by light. To explore the hypothesis that melanopsin in humans expresses the properties of a bistable photopigment in vivo we used the pupillary light reflex (PLR) as a tool but with methods designed to study invertebrate photoreceptors. We show that the pupil only attains a fully stabilized state of constriction after several minutes of light exposure, a feature that is consistent with typical IRP photoequilibrium spectra. We further demonstrate that previous exposure to long wavelength light increases, while short wavelength light decreases the amplitude of pupil constriction, a fundamental property of IRP difference spectra. Modelling these responses to invertebrate photopigment templates yields two putative spectra for the underlying R and M photopigment states with peaks at 481 nm and 587 nm respectively. Furthermore, this bistable mechanism may confer a novel form of ""photic memory"" since information of prior light conditions is retained and shapes subsequent responses to light. These results suggest that the human retina exploits fly-like photoreceptive mechanisms that are potentially important for the modulation of non-visual responses to light and highlights the ubiquitous nature of photoswitchable photosensors across living organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2063992197,"Hsp90 is an ATP-dependent molecular chaperone which assists the maturation of a large set of target proteins. Members of the highly conserved Hsp90 family are found from bacteria to higher eukaryotes, with homologues in different organelles. The core architecture of Hsp90 is defined by the N-terminal ATP binding domain followed by the middle domain and the C-terminal dimerization domain. A long, highly charged linker between the N-terminal domain and the middle domain is a feature characteristic for Hsp90s of eukaryotic organisms. We set out to clarify the function of this linker by studying the effects of deletions in this region in vivo and in vitro. Here we show that increasing deletions in the charged linker region lead to defects ranging from mild temperature sensitivity to a lethal phenotype. The lethal deletion variants investigated in this study still exhibit ATPase activity. Deletion of the charged linker ultimately causes a loss of Hsp90 regulation by co-chaperones, as the sensitivity for Aha1-mediated ATPase acceleration declines, and binding of p23/Sba1 is lost in non-viable deletion constructs. In vivo client assays additionally demonstrated that the deletion of the linker had a pronounced effect on the ability of Hsp90 to facilitate client activation. A partial reconstruction of the linker sequence showed that the supplementation by artificial sequences can rescue the functionality of Hsp90 and restore the conformational flexibility of the protein, required for the processing of client proteins.

Recent crystal structures of HtpG from Escherichia coli and Hsp90 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae show that the overall structural organization of the proteins is highly conserved (4Dollins D.E.

Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic Hsp90 proteins consist of an N-terminal ATP binding domain, a middle domain involved in client protein binding, and a C-terminal dimerization domain. During the ATPase cycle, large conformational changes in the Hsp90 dimer lead to the transient dimerization of the N-terminal domains and their association with the middle domains (7Prodromou C. Panaretou B. Chohan S. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Roe S.M. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4383-4392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Weikl T. Muschler P. Richter K. Veit T.

Despite the conservation of the basic molecular architecture and the ATPase mechanism, there are major differences between Hsp90 from prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The most striking difference is the emergence of a large set of co-chaperones in eucaryotes that bind to Hsp90 and seem to modulate and expand its properties (13Wandinger S.K. Richter K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 18473-18477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in contrast to procaryotes, Hsp90 is an essential protein in eucaryotes (14Bardwell J.C. Craig E.A. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2977-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 15Borkovich K.A. Farrelly F.W. Finkelstein D.B. Taulien J. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3919-3930Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) and it had been shown in S. cerevisiae that ATP hydrolysis by Hsp90 is required for sustaining its essential function (16Obermann W.M.

Chem. 2006; 281: 11301-11311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Finally, eukaryotic Hsp90 contains additional structural elements compared with prokaryotic Hsp90; that is, a long charged linker between the N terminus and the middle domain and a conserved motif (MEEVD) at the extended C-terminal end of the eucaryotic protein. Although it has been established that the C-terminal motif is the interaction site for TPR domain containing co-chaperones (19Chen S. Sullivan W.P. Toft D.O. Smith D.F. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 118-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 20Prodromou C. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Woolfson D.N. Regan L. Panaretou B. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H.

Cell. 2000; 101: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar), the function of the charged linker is less than clear. In general terms, it seems to contribute to the flexibility of the protein as the successful crystallization of Hsp90 from S. cerevisiae required the linker to be shortened and modified (6Ali M.M. Roe S.M. Vaughan C.K. Meyer P. Panaretou B. Piper P.W. Prodromou C. Pearl L.H. Nature. 2006; 440: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Hallmarks of this linker region are its low sequence complexity and the high amount of charged amino acids. In yeast Hsp90, the motif (D/E)(D/E)(D/E)KK is repeated five times in the linker region (22Farrelly F.W. Finkelstein D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5745-5751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Various secondary structure prediction programs canonically predict the charged linker region as predominantly in a coiled-coil conformation (23Combet C. Blanchet C. Geourjon C. Deléage G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 147-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar, 24Pollastri G. McLysaght A. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 1719-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). In a previous complementation study, it was shown that the charged linker is dispensable for the essential function of Hsp90 in S. cerevisiae, as a construct lacking residues 211–259 was still able to support cell proliferation (25Louvion J.F. Warth R. Picard D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 13937-13942Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In this study we constructed and analyzed a set of variants of Hsp90 in which the linker region was successively shortened, with a view to determine its contribution to the mechanism of Hsp90 in vivo and in vitro.DISCUSSIONThe molecular chaperone Hsp90 is an ATP-driven machine whose conformational changes are required to perform a complex reaction cycle (31Hessling M. Richter K. Buchner J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Comparing prokaryotic and eukaryotic Hsp90 homologues, two specific regions obviously differ strongly. One is a flexible linker region connecting the N-terminal (ATPase) and middle domains, and the other one is a C-terminal extension, which serves as the primary binding site for TPR domain-containing co-chaperones. Both regions are dispensable in yeast (25Louvion J.F. Warth R. Picard D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 13937-13942Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), which raised questions about their function. Especially, the function of the linker sequence remained enigmatic. We deleted this sequence to a different extent, including one version that did not have any linker sequence and two versions which had artificial amino acid stretches to connect the two domains. Our results highlight a minimal linker length required to retain viability. Interestingly, the full deletion of the linker, although leaving Hsp90 structurally intact and preserving ATP binding, does reduce ATP hydrolysis to values similar to those known from the isolated N-terminal domain/middle domain construct (53Wegele H. Muschler P. Bunck M. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39303-39310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Hsp90 activity can be rescued when an artificial linker is introduced, implying that one function of the linker region is to contribute conformational freedom for connection of the N and M domains. It might well be that conformational changes at the N-M interface require this conformational space to rearrange productively during the ATPase cycle. This alone appears to be not sufficient given the observation that the amino acids 266–272 are required for purposes, which cannot be fully supplemented fully by a Gly-Ser stretch as judged by the lower ATP turnover of 211–272SUP compared with 211–266SUP and differences in Aha1 interaction. Analysis of x-ray structures of HtpG and Grp94 (4Dollins D.E. Warren J.J. Immormino R.M. Gewirth D.T. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 41-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 5Shiau A.K. Harris S.F. Southworth D.R. Agard D.A. Cell. 2006; 127: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) suggests that these amino acid participate in the formation of a β-sheet-like structure with the N-terminal domain. However, this is difficult to decide based on the crystal structures, as both proteins were strongly mutated within the linker region to allow crystallization. Nevertheless, the participation of this sequence in a β-sheet structure could explain the requirement for certain amino acids within this region.The analysis of the co-chaperone interaction with the Hsp90 linker deletion variants allowed us to further scrutinize the function of the linker region. Some co-chaperones can be used as conformational sensors as they associate with specific states of Hsp90 during the ATPase cycle (45Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10328-10333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 46Meyer P. Prodromou C. Liao C. Hu B. Mark R.S. Vaughan C.K. Vlasic I. Panaretou B. Piper P.W.

The interaction with Sti1 was not significantly influenced by the linker deletions. This may be explained with the relative flexibility of the adaptor protein Sti1, which could compensate for a changed domain orientation in the charged linker constructs of Hsp90. The data for the p23/Sba1 interaction on the other hand suggest that the conformational changes leading to the N-terminal-dimerized state of Hsp90 seem to be inhibited by the linker deletion. This conformation is induced upon ATP binding (7Prodromou C. Panaretou B. Chohan S. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Roe S.M. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4383-4392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The conformational changes leading to this state are rate-limiting during the hydrolysis cycle (9Richter K. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44905-44910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Apparently, the deletion of the linker slows the repositioning of the N and the M domain at the N-M interface. Interestingly, also the ability of Aha1 to stimulate the ATP turnover is strongly reduced in the linker variants or even absent in the maximum deletion construct. Our data indicate that the Aha1-induced ATPase stimulation is only possible with unconstrained N-M interactions. It is reasonable to assume that if this interaction is sterically inhibited, Aha1 can no longer exert stimulatory effects even though Aha1 binding itself is not affected.To date, the ability to hydrolyze ATP was believed to be an essential prerequisite for in vivo functionality of Hsp90 wt as ATPase-defective mutants are not able to replace Hsp90 in an Hsp90-deficient background (16Obermann W.M. Sondermann H. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 17Panaretou B. Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4829-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that ATP hydrolysis alone is not sufficient for viability. Also, conformationally restricted but ATPase-active Hsp90 versions are unable to replace Hsp90 wt. The unrestricted motility of the N-M interface seems required for in vivo functions even more than for the ATP turnover. This is true even for the smallest deletions used in this study, which are not affected in their ATP turnover yet, but their chaperone effect on known in vivo clients of Hsp90, like the GR, luciferase, and v-Src kinase, is diminished. The severely compromised yeast strains carrying the Hsp90 linker constructs show a reduced ability to interact with Hsp90 clients, consistent with the view that the charged linker region is involved in Hsp90 chaperone function (54Scheibel T. Siegmund H.I. Jaenicke R. Ganz P. Lilie H. Buchner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 1297-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The recent structure of the kinase Cdk4 in complex with Hsp90-Cdc37 implies client interactions, which span the N-terminal part of Hsp90 and the middle domain (55Vaughan C.K. Gohlke U. Sobott F. Good V.M. Ali M.M. Prodromou C. Robinson C.V. Saibil H.R. Pearl L.H. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 697-707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). It might very well be that the conformational flexibility required at the N-M interface is even more pronounced in the case of client binding as compared with ATP hydrolysis. The strongly extended linker region, which can be found in all eukaryotic Hsp90 proteins, might therefore result from the need of a highly flexible contact surface that is able to integrate various client proteins into the Hsp90 dimer structure.

The most striking difference is the emergence of a large set of co-chaperones in eucaryotes that bind to Hsp90 and seem to modulate and expand its properties (13Wandinger S.K. Richter K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 18473-18477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in contrast to procaryotes, Hsp90 is an essential protein in eucaryotes (14Bardwell J.C. Craig E.A. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2977-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 15Borkovich K.A. Farrelly F.W. Finkelstein D.B. Taulien J. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3919-3930Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) and it had been shown in S. cerevisiae that ATP hydrolysis by Hsp90 is required for sustaining its essential function (16Obermann W.M. Sondermann H. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 17Panaretou B. Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W.

Chem. 2006; 281: 11301-11311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Finally, eukaryotic Hsp90 contains additional structural elements compared with prokaryotic Hsp90; that is, a long charged linker between the N terminus and the middle domain and a conserved motif (MEEVD) at the extended C-terminal end of the eucaryotic protein. Although it has been established that the C-terminal motif is the interaction site for TPR domain containing co-chaperones (19Chen S. Sullivan W.P. Toft D.O. Smith D.F. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 118-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 20Prodromou C. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Woolfson D.N. Regan L. Panaretou B. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H.

Cell. 2000; 101: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar), the function of the charged linker is less than clear. In general terms, it seems to contribute to the flexibility of the protein as the successful crystallization of Hsp90 from S. cerevisiae required the linker to be shortened and modified (6Ali M.M. Roe S.M. Vaughan C.K. Meyer P. Panaretou B. Piper P.W. Prodromou C. Pearl L.H. Nature. 2006; 440: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Hallmarks of this linker region are its low sequence complexity and the high amount of charged amino acids. In yeast Hsp90, the motif (D/E)(D/E)(D/E)KK is repeated five times in the linker region (22Farrelly F.W. Finkelstein D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5745-5751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Various secondary structure prediction programs canonically predict the charged linker region as predominantly in a coiled-coil conformation (23Combet C. Blanchet C. Geourjon C. Deléage G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 147-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar, 24Pollastri G. McLysaght A. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 1719-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). In a previous complementation study, it was shown that the charged linker is dispensable for the essential function of Hsp90 in S. cerevisiae, as a construct lacking residues 211–259 was still able to support cell proliferation (25Louvion J.F. Warth R. Picard D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 13937-13942Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In this study we constructed and analyzed a set of variants of Hsp90 in which the linker region was successively shortened, with a view to determine its contribution to the mechanism of Hsp90 in vivo and in vitro. heat shock protein 90 the S. cerevisiae gene for Hsp90 yeast Hsp90 after deletion of the charged region (amino acids 211–259) Hsp90 from E. coli 5′-fluoroorotic acid fluorescence resonance energy transfer glucocorticoid receptor surface plasmon resonance wild type adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate tetratricopeptide repeat. heat shock protein 90 the S. cerevisiae gene for Hsp90 yeast Hsp90 after deletion of the charged region (amino acids 211–259) Hsp90 from E. coli 5′-fluoroorotic acid fluorescence resonance energy transfer glucocorticoid receptor surface plasmon resonance wild type adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate tetratricopeptide repeat. DISCUSSIONThe molecular chaperone Hsp90 is an ATP-driven machine whose conformational changes are required to perform a complex reaction cycle (31Hessling M. Richter K. Buchner J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Comparing prokaryotic and eukaryotic Hsp90 homologues, two specific regions obviously differ strongly. One is a flexible linker region connecting the N-terminal (ATPase) and middle domains, and the other one is a C-terminal extension, which serves as the primary binding site for TPR domain-containing co-chaperones. Both regions are dispensable in yeast (25Louvion J.F. Warth R. Picard D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 13937-13942Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), which raised questions about their function. Especially, the function of the linker sequence remained enigmatic. We deleted this sequence to a different extent, including one version that did not have any linker sequence and two versions which had artificial amino acid stretches to connect the two domains. Our results highlight a minimal linker length required to retain viability. Interestingly, the full deletion of the linker, although leaving Hsp90 structurally intact and preserving ATP binding, does reduce ATP hydrolysis to values similar to those known from the isolated N-terminal domain/middle domain construct (53Wegele H. Muschler P. Bunck M. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39303-39310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Hsp90 activity can be rescued when an artificial linker is introduced, implying that one function of the linker region is to contribute conformational freedom for connection of the N and M domains. It might well be that conformational changes at the N-M interface require this conformational space to rearrange productively during the ATPase cycle. This alone appears to be not sufficient given the observation that the amino acids 266–272 are required for purposes, which cannot be fully supplemented fully by a Gly-Ser stretch as judged by the lower ATP turnover of 211–272SUP compared with 211–266SUP and differences in Aha1 interaction. Analysis of x-ray structures of HtpG and Grp94 (4Dollins D.E. Warren J.J. Immormino R.M. Gewirth D.T. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 41-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 5Shiau A.K. Harris S.F. Southworth D.R. Agard D.A. Cell. 2006; 127: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) suggests that these amino acid participate in the formation of a β-sheet-like structure with the N-terminal domain. However, this is difficult to decide based on the crystal structures, as both proteins were strongly mutated within the linker region to allow crystallization. Nevertheless, the participation of this sequence in a β-sheet structure could explain the requirement for certain amino acids within this region.The analysis of the co-chaperone interaction with the Hsp90 linker deletion variants allowed us to further scrutinize the function of the linker region. Some co-chaperones can be used as conformational sensors as they associate with specific states of Hsp90 during the ATPase cycle (45Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10328-10333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 46Meyer P. Prodromou C. Liao C. Hu B. Mark R.S. Vaughan C.K. Vlasic I. Panaretou B. Piper P.W.

The interaction with Sti1 was not significantly influenced by the linker deletions. This may be explained with the relative flexibility of the adaptor protein Sti1, which could compensate for a changed domain orientation in the charged linker constructs of Hsp90. The data for the p23/Sba1 interaction on the other hand suggest that the conformational changes leading to the N-terminal-dimerized state of Hsp90 seem to be inhibited by the linker deletion. This conformation is induced upon ATP binding (7Prodromou C. Panaretou B. Chohan S. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Roe S.M. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4383-4392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The conformational changes leading to this state are rate-limiting during the hydrolysis cycle (9Richter K. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44905-44910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Apparently, the deletion of the linker slows the repositioning of the N and the M domain at the N-M interface. Interestingly, also the ability of Aha1 to stimulate the ATP turnover is strongly reduced in the linker variants or even absent in the maximum deletion construct. Our data indicate that the Aha1-induced ATPase stimulation is only possible with unconstrained N-M interactions. It is reasonable to assume that if this interaction is sterically inhibited, Aha1 can no longer exert stimulatory effects even though Aha1 binding itself is not affected.To date, the ability to hydrolyze ATP was believed to be an essential prerequisite for in vivo functionality of Hsp90 wt as ATPase-defective mutants are not able to replace Hsp90 in an Hsp90-deficient background (16Obermann W.M. Sondermann H. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 17Panaretou B. Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4829-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that ATP hydrolysis alone is not sufficient for viability. Also, conformationally restricted but ATPase-active Hsp90 versions are unable to replace Hsp90 wt. The unrestricted motility of the N-M interface seems required for in vivo functions even more than for the ATP turnover. This is true even for the smallest deletions used in this study, which are not affected in their ATP turnover yet, but their chaperone effect on known in vivo clients of Hsp90, like the GR, luciferase, and v-Src kinase, is diminished. The severely compromised yeast strains carrying the Hsp90 linker constructs show a reduced ability to interact with Hsp90 clients, consistent with the view that the charged linker region is involved in Hsp90 chaperone function (54Scheibel T. Siegmund H.I. Jaenicke R. Ganz P. Lilie H. Buchner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 1297-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The recent structure of the kinase Cdk4 in complex with Hsp90-Cdc37 implies client interactions, which span the N-terminal part of Hsp90 and the middle domain (55Vaughan C.K. Gohlke U. Sobott F.

It might very well be that the conformational flexibility required at the N-M interface is even more pronounced in the case of client binding as compared with ATP hydrolysis. The strongly extended linker region, which can be found in all eukaryotic Hsp90 proteins, might therefore result from the need of a highly flexible contact surface that is able to integrate various client proteins into the Hsp90 dimer structure. The molecular chaperone Hsp90 is an ATP-driven machine whose conformational changes are required to perform a complex reaction cycle (31Hessling M. Richter K. Buchner J. Nat. Struct. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2095484082,"The serpinopathies are a family of diseases characterized by the accumulation of ordered polymers of mutant protein within the endoplasmic reticulum. They are a diverse group including alpha(1)-antitrypsin deficiency and the inherited dementia familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies or FENIB. We have used transient transfection of COS7 cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, PC12 cell lines that conditionally express wild type and mutant neuroserpin and fly models of FENIB to assess the cellular handling of wild type and mutant serpins. By using a polymer-specific monoclonal antibody, we show that mutant neuroserpin forms polymers after a delay of at least 30 min and that polymers can be cleared in PC12 cell lines and from the brain in a fly model of FENIB. At steady state, the fractions of intracellular polymerogenic G392E mutant neuroserpin in the monomeric and polymeric states are comparable. Inhibition of the proteasome with MG132 reveals that both mutant neuroserpin and alpha(1)-antitrypsin are degraded predominantly by endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD). Pharmacological and genetic inhibitions demonstrate that autophagy is responsible for bulk turnover of wild type and mutant serpins, but can be stimulated by rapamycin to compensate for proteasome inhibition. The significance of these findings to the treatment of serpinopathies is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2156660543,"Background Metastasis is a process by which cancer cells learn to form satellite tumors in distant organs and represents the principle cause of death of patients with solid tumors. NSCLC is the most lethal human cancer due to its high rate of metastasis. Methodology/Principal Findings Lack of a suitable animal model has so far hampered analysis of metastatic progression. We have examined c-MYC for its ability to induce metastasis in a C-RAF-driven mouse model for non-small-cell lung cancer. c-MYC alone induced frank tumor growth only after long latency at which time secondary mutations in K-Ras or LKB1 were detected reminiscent of human NSCLC. Combination with C-RAF led to immediate acceleration of tumor growth, conversion to papillary epithelial cells and angiogenic switch induction. Moreover, addition of c-MYC was sufficient to induce macrometastasis in liver and lymph nodes with short latency associated with lineage switch events. Thus we have generated the first conditional model for metastasis of NSCLC and identified a gene, c-MYC that is able to orchestrate all steps of this process. Conclusions/Significance Potential markers for detection of metastasis were identified and validated for diagnosis of human biopsies. These markers may represent targets for future therapeutic intervention as they include genes such as Gata4 that are exclusively expressed during lung development."
https://openalex.org/W2052950232,"Cross-talk of BMP and Wnt signaling pathways has been implicated in many aspects of biological events during embryogenesis and in adulthood. A secreted protein Wise and its orthologs (Sostdc1, USAG-1, and Ectodin) have been shown to modulate Wnt signaling and also inhibit BMP signals. Modulation of Wnt signaling activity by Wise is brought about by an interaction with the Wnt co-receptor LRP6, whereas BMP inhibition is by binding to BMP ligands. Here we have investigated the mode of action of Wise on Wnt and BMP signals. It was found that Wise binds LRP6 through one of three loops formed by the cystine knot. The Wise deletion construct lacking the LRP6-interacting loop domain nevertheless binds BMP4 and inhibits BMP signals. Moreover, BMP4 does not interfere with Wise-LRP6 binding, suggesting separate domains for the physical interaction. Functional assays also show that the ability of Wise to block Wnt1 activity through LRP6 is not impeded by BMP4. In contrast, the ability of Wise to inhibit BMP4 is prevented by additional LRP6, implying a preference of Wise in binding LRP6 over BMP4. In addition to the interaction of Wise with BMP4 and LRP6, the molecular characteristics of Wise, such as glycosylation and association with heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the cell surface, are suggested.

Wise is a secreted protein that was isolated from a functional screen of a chick cDNA library of embryonic tissues.

Wise appears to have a dual role in modulating the Wnt pathway. Injection of Wnt8 RNA into a ventral vegetal blastomere of Xenopus embryos at the four-cell stage induces a full secondary axis to form, and this is blocked by the addition of Wise RNA as well as other Wnt inhibitors (1Itasaki N. Jones C.M. Mercurio S. Rowe A. Domingos P.M. Smith J.C. Krumlauf R. Development. 2003; 130: 4295-4305Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in hair follicles triggers regeneration of hair growth, and expression of Wise appears to have a defined role to inhibit this (15Beaudoin 3rd, G.M. Sisk J.M. Coulombe P.A. Thompson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 14653-14658Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In this context, Wise expression is repressed by the nuclear receptor co-repressor, Hairless, which results in activation of the Wnt pathway; thus, a model of periodic regeneration of hair follicles has been proposed (15Beaudoin 3rd, G.M. Sisk J.M. Coulombe P.A. Thompson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 14653-14658Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 16Thompson C.C. Sisk J.M. Beaudoin 3rd, G.M. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 1913-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition, Wise and its homologue USAG-1 have been shown to block Wnt1, Wnt3a, and Wnt10b activities in reporter assays (14Yanagita M. Oka M. Watabe T. Iguchi H. Niida A. Takahashi S. Akiyama T.

Wise was found to bind to the Wnt co-receptor, LRP6, sharing the binding domain with Wnt ligands. Importantly, Wise was found to compete with Wnt8 for binding to LRP6, therefore suggesting a mechanism for inhibition of the Wnt pathway whereby Wise blocks the binding of ligand and receptor (1Itasaki N. Jones C.M. Mercurio S. Rowe A. Domingos P.M. Smith J.C. Krumlauf R. Development. 2003; 130: 4295-4305Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Wise may also be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and inhibit the trafficking of LRP6 to the cell surface (18Guidato S. Itasaki N. Dev. Biol. 2007; 310: 250-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Wise also binds LRP4 (19Ohazama A. Johnson E.B. Ota M.S. Choi H.Y. Choi H.J. Porntaveetus T. Oommen S. Itoh N. Eto K. Gritli-Linde A. Herz J. Sharpe P.T. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e4092Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), a member of the LRP family functioning inhibitory to Wnt signals (20Johnson E.B. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 3523-3538Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that Wise was isolated from a screen designed to detect the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, not inhibition. The exact mechanism of how Wise exerts such a context-dependent modulation on the Wnt pathway is yet to be clarified. Osteoblast differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells, as measured by alkaline phosphatase activity, can be induced by a wide range of BMP molecules. In this assay, Ectodin, the mouse ortholog of Wise, was shown to inhibit differentiation induced by BMP2, -4, -6, or -7 in a dose-dependent manner (3Laurikkala J. Kassai Y. Pakkasjärvi L. Thesleff I. Itoh N. Dev. Biol. 2003; 264: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Similarly, Ectodin (also known as USAG-1) was also found to inhibit the bone differentiation induced by BMP2, -4, or -7 in C2C12 cells (14Yanagita M. Oka M. Watabe T. Iguchi H. Niida A. Takahashi S. Akiyama T. Miyazono K. Yanagisawa M. Sakurai T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 316: 490-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Ectodin also inhibits BMP2- or BMP7-induced Msx2 expression in dissected mouse tooth buds in organ culture (3Laurikkala J. Kassai Y. Pakkasjärvi L. Thesleff I. Itoh N. Dev. Biol. 2003; 264: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In tooth buds, Ectodin expression is detected in the dental ectoderm and mesenchymal cells excluding from the enamel knot (3Laurikkala J. Kassai Y. Pakkasjärvi L. Thesleff I. Itoh N. Dev. Biol. 2003; 264: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Ectodin/USAG-1-deficient mice created by targeted-disruption show altered tooth morphology and extra teeth, indicating that Ectodin and BMP tightly control tooth development and patterning in mammals (8Kassai Y.

Development. 2009; 136: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in mouse adult kidneys, the ability of BMP7 to repair established renal injury is blocked by USAG-1 (13Yanagita M. Okuda T. Endo S. Tanaka M. Takahashi K. Sugiyama F. Kunita S. Takahashi S. Fukatsu A. Yanagisawa M. Kita T. Sakurai T. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 70-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). All of these findings indicate that USAG-1/Wise/Ectodin has a clear antagonistic effect on BMP signaling, where it binds BMP2, -4, -6, and -7 (3Laurikkala J. Kassai Y. Pakkasjärvi L. Thesleff I. Itoh N. Dev. Biol. 2003; 264: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 14Yanagita M. Oka M. Watabe T. Iguchi H. Niida A. Takahashi S. Akiyama T. Miyazono K. Yanagisawa M. Sakurai T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 316: 490-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and presumably prevents BMP binding to its receptors. Analysis of the sequence of Wise reveals that it has the C1XnC2XGXC3XnC4XnC5XC6 motif of a six-membered cystine knot, where C1 forms a disulfide bond with C4, C2 with C5, and C3 with C6 (for a review of the cystine knot, see Refs. 24Yanagita M.

This arrangement results in a globular protein with three loops, “finger 1,” “heel,” and “finger 2,” held together with an eight-membered ring of C2XGXC3C6XC5C2 (Fig. 1). BMP antagonists represent a subfamily in the cystine knot superfamily, and this is further subdivided into three subfamilies based on the size of the cystine knot. These are the CAN family (eight-membered ring), Twisted Gastrulation (nine-membered ring), and Chordin and Noggin (10-membered ring) (27Avsian-Kretchmer O. Hsueh A.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). There is generally little sequence homology between family members in the heel, finger 1, and finger 2 regions, yet Wise does show a moderate homology with Sclerostin (28Kusu N. Laurikkala J.

This paper aims to analyze the dual role of Wise on Wnt and BMP pathways by probing the structural features of the protein and reconciling them to physiological properties. It also aims to reveal the molecular nature of the protein in view of possible glycosylation, secretion, and association with extracellular matrix. Secondary structure prediction was performed on the chick amino acid sequence and closely related sequences from zebrafish, Xenopus, mouse, and human using the program PHD (35Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The secondary structure prediction was used to guide a manual alignment of the five sequences. The result is shown in supplemental Fig. 1. This alignment was processed by the three-dimensional fold recognition server 3DPSSM (36Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). The top fold was that of the cystine knot in human chorionic gonadotropin (37Wu H. Lustbader J.W. Liu Y. Canfield R.E. Hendrickson W.A. Structure. 1994; 2: 545-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) with 90% certainty. A three-dimensional structural model was built of the chick Wise sequence from residue 68 to 186 based on the human chorionic gonadotropin structure (Protein Data Bank code 1HCN) extracted from the Protein Data Bank (38Berman H. Henrick K. Nakamura H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 980Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar). The molecular modeling program QUAFNTA (Accelrys Inc.) was employed on a Silicon Graphics O2 computer running the IRIX operating system. An alignment from the chick, human, rat, and mouse amino acid sequences was made using the program ClustalX (39Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35075) Google Scholar) with default multiple alignment parameters. Secondary structure regions (β-strands) obtained from the structural model of chick Wise is shown in supplemental Fig. 2. HEK293 cells (ATCC) were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with DNA constructs using Polyfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. FLAG-tagged chick Wise was subcloned into pCS2+, and deletions and point mutations were introduced into this clone using PCR with specific primers. All clones containing mutated constructs were sequenced throughout the Wise gene insert before being used in protein production and assays. The BMP4 construct is a fusion of a pro-region from the BMP2 and the mature region of BMP4 tagged with Myc (40Augsburger A. Schuchardt A. Hoskins S. Dodd J. Butler S. Neuron. 1999; 24: 127-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) subcloned into pCS2+. Recombinant BMP4 protein (R&D Systems) and anti-BMP4 antibody (R&D Systems) were also used. A clone containing a fusion of the extracellular domain of LRP6 and Fc domain of IgG (LRP6-IgG) was a gift from Xi He (41Tamai K. Semenov M. Kato Y. Spokony R. Liu C. Katsuyama Y. Hess F. Saint-Jeannet J.P. He X. Nature. 2000; 407: 530-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). LRP6 extracellular domain (LRP6ECD, amino acids 1–1370) was subcloned into pCS2 after attaching a Myc tag and a stop codon. HEK293 cells were grown to 80% confluence in 80-cm2 flasks and transfected with expression plasmids. Aspirated medium was replaced with Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) after 24 h to provide a serum-free environment for protein collection. Condition medium was then collected after 3 and 5 days or after each further 24-h period for the next 4 days. They were clarified to remove debris and then applied to a 10-kDa cut-off centrifugal filter device (Millipore). The supernatant was concentrated 5 or 50 times, respectively, and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. HEK293 cells in T25 flasks were transfected with expression plasmids of FLAG-tagged Wise and Myc-tagged LRP6 extracellular domain (ECD) 3The abbreviations used are: ECDextracellular domainBREBMP response elementPNGase Fpeptide:N-glycosidase FHSPGheparan sulfate proteoglycan. or BMP4. After 24 h, the medium was replaced by OptiMEM (Invitrogen). After a further 24 h, medium was collected, added to anti-FLAG-agarose affinity gel beads (Sigma), and incubated at 4 °C for 6 h. In some experiments, Wise and LRP6ECD-IgG were individually transfected, and the conditioned media were mixed with bovine serum albumin or recombinant BMP4, followed by mixing with protein A beads (GE Healthcare). Beads were then washed five times with wash buffer (150 ml of NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100). Protein was eluted from the beads in modified Laemmli buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) at 100 °C for 5 min before loading onto a denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel. For immunoprecipitation of LRP6ECD, a 4–15% gradient gel (Bio-Rad) was used to detect both Wise and LRP6ECD. For detecting Wise and BMP4, a 15% gel was used. Protein samples run on polyacrylamide gels were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were then blocked in 10% milk protein in phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.1% Tween 20 before exposing to antibodies: anti-FLAG M2-horseradish peroxidase (Sigma), anti-Myc (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), or anti-Fc (Sigma) and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). Detection was by ECL (Amersham Biosciences; SuperSignal West Pico/Femto, Thermo) on x-ray film. extracellular domain BMP response element peptide:N-glycosidase F heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Deglycosylation of Wise protein was carried out by treating concentrated Wise-conditioned medium with peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F; New England Biolabs), O-glycosidase (Roche Applied Science), endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (New England Biolabs), and endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase D (Merck) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Typically, 50 times concentrated protein in conditioned medium was first denatured at 100 °C in 0.5% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol and then digested with the enzyme in manufacturer's buffer in a total of 50 μl at 37 °C for 60 min. For heparan sulfate treatment, HEK293 cells were transfected with Myc-tagged LRP6, and the medium was replaced on the following day with Wise conditioned medium together with 2 μg/ml heparan sulfate (Sigma). The cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C before the immunostaining procedure with anti-Myc and anti-FLAG antibodies. For the sodium chlorate experiment, HEK293 cells were transfected with Wise, split, and incubated with or without 20 nm of sodium chlorate for 2 days, after which the conditioned medium and cell extracts were collected for Western analyses. The Wnt pathway activity was detected by transfecting reporter constructs of 0.08 μg of TOPflash (Upstate Biotechnology) (42Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W.

HEK293 cells were transfected with expression plasmids (Fig. 5C, BMP4 (0.05 μg), Wise (0.1 μg); Fig. 6C, Wnt1 (0.1 μg), Wise (0.1 μg), BMP4 (0.1 or 0.2 μg); Fig. 6D, BMP4 (0.05 μg), Wise (0.3 μg), LRP6 (0.005 or 0.01 μg)), each well receiving a total of 0.5 μg of DNA, using a control vector where necessary. After 24 h, medium was replaced with a serum-free medium, OptiMEM (Invitrogen), and cells were lysed 48 h post-transfection. The normalized luciferase activity was determined using the Stop and Glo Dual Luciferase System (Promega) on a Turner Luminometer. Bar graphs show the average of triplicate samples in one experiment, and the error bars display S.D. values. The same experiments were repeated at least three times.FIGURE 6Function of Wise on LRP6 and BMP4. A, immunoprecipitation (IP) assay. Conditioned media of HEK293 cells separately transfected with Wise or LRP6IgG were mixed together with bovine serum albumin or recombinant BMP4, as indicated (+, 100 ng; ++, 200 ng/700 μl) and immunoprecipitated with LRP6IgG, and the precipitated samples were analyzed on Western blots using anti-FLAG (Wise), anti-BMP4, or anti-Fc antibodies. Inputs of BMP4 and LRP6 indicate the presence of these proteins in the mix of relevant conditioned media and proteins. Input Wise is not shown because it was undetectable after diluting with other conditioned media. Concentrated Wise medium was checked on a separate blot prior to use, and an equal volume of the medium from the same batch was used for each of the immunoprecipitation samples. Immunoprecipitation of Wise (upper panel) is not compromised by the presence of BMP4. *, nonspecific bands. B, immunostaining of HEK293 cells stably expressing Myc-tagged LRP6 (green), treated with conditioned medium of FLAG-tagged Wise (red), without or with recombinant BMP4 (100 ng/ml).

HEK293 cells were transfected with Wnt1 (0.1 μg), Wise (0.1 μg), and/or BMP4 (+, 0.1 μg; ++, 0.2 μg) constructs, as indicated, together with TOPflash and control Renilla reporters. Activation of TOPflash reporter by Wnt1 is suppressed by Wise. The addition of BMP4 does not affect the function of Wise in Wnt1 inhibition. D, BRE reporter assay. HEK293 cells were transfected with BMP4 (0.05 μg), Wise (0.3 μg), and/or LRP6 (+, 0.005 μg; ++, 0.01 μg) constructs, as indicated, together with BRE and control Renilla reporters. Suppression of BMP4 activity by Wise is largely prevented by additional LRP6. BSA, bovine serum albumin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To detect phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 proteins, HEK293 cells were plated in 35-mm dishes 24 h prior to experimentation. Recombinant BMP4 (5 ng/ml) was premixed with 5 times concentrated Wise conditioned medium or similarly concentrated control conditioned medium and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C before applying to the cells. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then collected on ice with 200 μl of modified Laemmli buffer by scraping. The samples were boiled for 5 min and sonicated before loading onto polyacrylamide gels. Anti-phospho-Smad1/5/8 antibody (Cell Signaling) was used on Western blots together with anti-β-tubulin antibody, which serves as a loading control. The signals were detected by the fluorescent Western system for quantification (LI-COR). Cells transfected with Myc-tagged LRP6 were treated with conditioned medium of FLAG-tagged Wise- or Wise(Δheel)-expressing cells overnight. Cells were then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, and immunostaining was carried out with anti-FLAG and anti-Myc antibodies. The predicted three-dimensional structural model of the core part of the Wise protein revealed that Wise is very likely to form a cystine knot (Fig. 1A). In addition, the two other cysteines at positions 89 and 147 are located very close to the tip of two “fingers” and are likely to anchor the fingers by a disulfide bond, analogous to other cystine knot proteins (27Avsian-Kretchmer O. Hsueh A.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The two fingers curve in the same direction in parallel (toward the back of the plane in Fig. 1A). The domain between the C terminus and the 165th cysteine residue turns around and comes close to the first finger. Inspection of the amino acid sequence of chick Wise revealed two putative N-glycosylation sites, at positions 47 and 173. To investigate glycosylation of Wise, concentrated Wise conditioned medium was treated either with PNGase F, which cleaves most N-glycosylations between the innermost GlcNAc and the asparagine residue, or with O-glycosidase, wh"
https://openalex.org/W2004508563,"Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between fluorescent proteins is a powerful tool for visualization of signal transduction in living cells, and recently, some strategies for imaging of dual FRET pairs in a single cell have been reported. However, these necessitate alteration of excitation light between two different wavelengths to avoid the spectral overlap, resulting in sequential detection with a lag time. Thus, to follow fast signal dynamics or signal changes in highly motile cells, a single-excitation dual-FRET method should be required. Here we reported this by using four-color imaging with a single excitation light and subsequent linear unmixing to distinguish fluorescent proteins. We constructed new FRET sensors with Sapphire/RFP to combine with CFP/YFP, and accomplished simultaneous imaging of cAMP and cGMP in single cells. We confirmed that signal amplitude of our dual FRET measurement is comparable to of conventional single FRET measurement. Finally, we demonstrated to monitor both intracellular Ca2+ and cAMP in highly motile cardiac myocytes. To cancel out artifacts caused by the movement of the cell, this method expands the applicability of the combined use of dual FRET sensors for cell samples with high motility."
https://openalex.org/W2037152905,"Increased pain sensitivity after opioid administration (opioid-induced hyperalgesia) and/or repeated painful stimuli is an individually varying and clinically important phenomenon. The functional polymorphism (val158met) of the Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene regulates the metabolism of dopamine/noradrenaline. Individuals homozygous for the met158 allele have been reported to have increased pain sensitivity and there are findings of lower µ-opioid system activation during sustained pain. We hypothesized that met/met individuals would exhibit higher pain sensitization and opioid-induced hyperalgesia in response to repeated pain stimuli and an intravenous injection of an opioid drug. Participants were 43 healthy subjects who went through an experiment where five blocks of pain were induced to the hand using a heat probe. After each stimulus subjects rated the pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0 mm (no pain) to 100 mm (worst possible pain). Before the second stimulus there was an intravenous injection of a rapid and potent opioid drug. At baseline there was no difference in pain ratings between the COMTval158met genotypes, F(2, 39)<1. However, a repeated measures ANOVA for all five stimuli revealed a main effect for COMTval158met genotype, F(2, 36) = 4.17, p = 0.024. Met/met individuals reported significantly more pain compared to val/val, p = 0.010. A pairwise comparison of baseline and the opioid intervention demonstrated that analgesia was induced in all groups (p = 0.042) without a separating effect for genotype (n.s). We suggest that the initial response of the descending pain system is not influenced by the COMTval158met polymorphism but when the system is challenged the difference is revealed. An important clinical implication of this may be that the COMTval158met related differences may be more expressed in individuals where the inhibitory system is already challenged and sensitive, e.g. chronic pain patients. This has to be proven in future studies where the impact of the COMTval158met polymorphism on opioid treatment in patients is addressed."
https://openalex.org/W2000134238,"Recent evidence suggests that interleukin-1β (IL-1β), which was originally identified as a proinflammatory cytokine, is also required in the brain for memory processes. We have previously shown that IL-1β synthesis in the hippocampus is dependent on P2X7 receptor (P2X7R), which is an ionotropic receptor of ATP. To substantiate the role of P2X7R in both brain IL-1β expression and memory processes, we examined the induction of IL-1β mRNA expression in the hippocampus of wild-type (WT) and homozygous P2X7 receptor knockout mice (P2X7R−/−) following a spatial memory task. The spatial recognition task induced both IL-1β mRNA expression and c-Fos protein activation in the hippocampus of WT but not of P2X7R−/− mice. Remarkably, P2X7R−/− mice displayed spatial memory impairment in a hippocampal-dependant task, while their performances in an object recognition task were unaltered. Taken together, our results show that P2X7R plays a critical role in spatial memory processes and the associated hippocampal IL-1β mRNA synthesis and c-Fos activation."
https://openalex.org/W1978597908,"Ischemic stroke stimulates neurogenesis in the adult rodent brain. The molecules underlying stroke-induced neurogenesis have not been fully investigated. Using real-time reverse transcription-PCR, we found that stroke substantially up-regulated angiopoietin 2 (ANG2), a proangiogenic gene, expression in subventricular zone neural progenitor cells. Incubation of neural progenitor cells with recombinant human ANG2 significantly increased the number of β-III tubulin-positive cells, a marker of immature neurons, but did not alter the number of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive cells, a marker of astrocytes, suggesting that ANG2 promotes neuronal differentiation. Blockage of the ANG2 receptor, Tie2, with small interference RNA (siRNA)-Tie2 attenuated recombinant human ANG2 (rhANG2)-increased β-III tubulin mRNA levels compared with levels in the progenitor cells transfected with control siRNA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPβ) up-regulated by rhANG2 bound to β-III tubulin, which is consistent with published data that there are several C/EBPβ binding sites in the promoter of β-III tubulin gene. In addition, rhANG2 enhanced migration of neural progenitor cells measured by single neurosphere assay. Blockage of Tie2 with siRNA-Tie2 and a Tie2-neutralizing antibody did not suppress ANG2-enhanced migration. However, inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases with GM6001 blocked ANG2-enhanced migration. Collectively, our data suggest that interaction of ANG2, a proangiogenic factor, with its receptor Tie2 promotes neural progenitor cell differentiation into neuronal lineage cells, whereas ANG2 regulates neural progenitor cell migration through matrix metalloproteinases, which do not require its receptor Tie2.

In the present study we investigated the effect of ANG2 on differentiation and migration of adult SVZ progenitor cells. There is no single marker to identify SVZ stem cells in the adult rodent brain. Therefore, in the present study the term “neural progenitor cells” was used to describe dividing cells with capacity for differentiation. Adult male mice (C57B/6J, 20–30 g) were employed in this study. Permanent right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) was induced by advancing a 6–0 surgical nylon suture (8.0–9.0 mm, determined by body weight) with an expanded tip from the external carotid artery into the lumen of the internal carotid artery to block the origin of the middle cerebral artery (33Mao Y. Yang G.Y. Zhou L.F. Stern J.D. Betz A.L. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 63: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).

The cells were plated at a density of 2 × 104 cells/ml in growth medium. Growth medium contains Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (Invitrogen), 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and basic fibroblast growth factor (R&D Systems). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium contains l-glutamine (2 mmol/liter), glucose (0.6%), putrescine (9.6 mg/ml), insulin (0.025 mg/ml), progesterone (6.3 ng/ml), apotransferrin (0.1 mg/ml), and sodium selenite (5.2 ng/ml). The generated neurospheres (primary spheres) were passaged by mechanical dissociation and reseeded as single cells at a density of 20 cells/μl. SVZ cells from ischemic brain were extracted 7 days after MCAo, a peak time of increase of neurogenesis (9Zhang R.L. Zhang Z.G. Zhang L. Chopp M. Neuroscience. 2001; 105: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 13Zhang R. Zhang Z. Wang L. Wang Y. Gousev A. Zhang L. Ho K.L. Morshead C. Chopp M. J. Cereb.

Briefly, frozen brain coronal sections stored at −80 °C were immediately immersed in acetone for 2 min of fixation and air-dried for 30 s. After a brief rinse with 0.1% diethylpyrocarbonate-treated phosphate-buffered saline, sections were stained with propidium iodide dye (1:3000 dilution, Sigma) for 5 min, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline twice, and dehydrated in graded alcohols (75, 90, and 100% ethanol, 30 s each) and xylene for clearance for 5 min (26Liu X.S. Zhang Z.G. Zhang R.L. Gregg S. Morris D.C. Wang Y. Chopp M. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2007; 27: 564-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). All reaction steps were performed in RNase-free solutions. Sections were then air-dried under laminar flow for 10 min and immediately used for LCM. Dense SVZ cells on sections stained by propidium iodide were readily distinct from the ependymal cells that have cilia along the lateral wall of the lateral ventricle and from the adjacent striatal cells (35Chiasson B.J. Tropepe V. Morshead C.M. van der Kooy D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4462-4471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the non-ischemic mouse, the dorsal and ventral SVZ of the lateral wall was defined as a 20–30-μm-wide zone approximately of 2–3 cell bodies immediately adjacent to ependymal cells, whereas in the ischemic mouse, the SVZ was expanded to a 60–80-μm-wide zone. Propidium iodide-positive cells within the SVZ were captured onto a thermoplastic film mounted on optically transparent LCM caps using the PixCell II LCM System (Arcturus Bioscience Inc., Mountain View, CA). The following parameters were used during LCM: 7.5-mm laser spot size, 60 milliwatts of power, and 750-ms duration. The transfer film was examined under the microscope to ensure cell lysis. Caps with cells were immediately placed into Eppendorf tubes containing 350 μl of lysis buffer and stored at −80 °C before RNA isolation. Approximately 1000 cells were isolated in the SVZ from each animal. Quantitative PCRs were performed using SYBR Green real-time PCR system. Total RNAs from cultured SVZ cells or LCM cells were extracted using Qiagen Mini kit or Qiagen Micro kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNAs were prepared from total RNA using oligodT20, dNTP mix, first-strand buffer, dithiothreitol, RNaseOUT, and Superscript III (Invitrogen). Real-time RT-PCRs were performed on an ABI 7000 PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Amplicon sizes were confirmed using RT-PCR, as previously described (36Katakowski M. Zhang Z. deCarvalho A.C. Chopp M. Neurosci. Lett. 2005; 385: 204-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Each sample was tested in triplicate, and relative gene expression was determined using the 2−ΔΔCT method (37Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (123392) Google Scholar). Primers to amplify the following transcripts are as follows: β-actin forward primer, 5′-CCATCATGAAGTGTGACGTTG, and reverse primer, 5′-CAATGATCTTGATCTTCATGGTG (150 bp); ANG1 forward primer, 5′-GATCTTACACGGTGCCGATT, and reverse primer, 5′-TTAGATTGGAAGGGCCACAG (118 bp); ANG2 forward primer, 5′-TCCAAGAGCTCGGTTGCTAT, and reverse primer, 5′-AGTTGGGGAAGGTCAGTGTG (114 bp); Tie2 forward primer, 5′-AAGCATGCCCATCTGGTTAC, and reverse primer, 5′-GCCTGCCTTCTTTCTCACAC (138 bp); bone morphogenetic protein 2 (Bmp2) forward primer, 5′- GTCGAAGCTCTCCCACTGAC, and reverse primer 5′-CAGGAAGCTTTGGGAAACAG (150 bp); Bmp4 forward primer, 5′-CGTTACCTCAAGGGAGTGGA, and reverse primer, 5′-ATGCTTGGGACTACGTTTGG (116 bp); β-III tubulin forward primer, 5′-TGAGGCCTCCTCTCACAAGT, and reverse primer, 5′-GGCCTGAATAGGTGTCCAAA (105 bp); Bmp type I receptor B (Bmpr1b), forward primer, 5′-AGCGCTATATGCCTCCAGAA, and reverse primer, 5′-CTCCTTGCAATCTCCCAGAG (114 bp); Smad5 forward primer, 5′-CTCCAGCTCCTCCATAGCAC, and reverse primer, 5′-ATTGTTGGGCTGGAAACAAG (109 bp). The Oligo arrays (SABiosciences, Frederick, MD) were used, and hybridization procedures were performed as described by the manufacturer. The biotin dUTP-labeled cDNA probes were specifically generated in the presence of a designed set of gene-specific primers using total RNA and reverse transcriptase. The array filters were hybridized with biotin-labeled probes at 60 °C for 17 h. The filters were then washed twice with 2× saline sodium citrate buffer, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and twice with 0.1× saline sodium citrate, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 60 °C for 15 min each. Chemiluminescent detection steps were performed by subsequent incubation of the filters with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin and CDPStar substrate (SABiosciences). For quantification, intensity of spots was measured by GEArray Expression Analysis Suite software, and then the average intensities derived from blank spots were subtracted. Four random pictures from the bottom of each insert were acquired. These relative intensities were used to compare gene expression levels between control and ANG2 treatment groups. A ChIP assay was performed using the ChIP kit (Upstate, Charlottesville, VA). SVZ cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde and sonicated to an average length of 200–500 bp. The chromatin solutions were precleared with the addition of Protein G beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The precleared chromatins were incubated with C/EBPβ antibody (2 μg, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Santa Cruz, CA), normal IgG serum, or no antibody as a negative control overnight. The antibody/chromatin mixtures were precipitated with Protein G beads, and the beads were sequentially washed with ChIP wash buffer. Cross-linking was reversed by adding 4 μl of 5 m NaCl and incubating at 65 °C overnight. DNAs were purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The real-time PCR primers: forward primer, 5′-GCACCTGGGGTGAACTAAGA, and reverse primer, 5′-CCAAGGAGGAGGACAAAGAA (127 bp), were used to amplify the β-III tubulin promoter region flanking the C/EBPβ binding. Binding activities were calculated as the percentage of pre-immunoprecipitated input DNA. In situ gelatinolytic activity was performed on a single SVZ neurosphere using an 8-well chamber and DQ gelatin as a substrate (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (38Mook O.R. Van Overbeek C. Ackema E.G. Van Maldegem F. Frederiks W.M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2003; 51: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 39Snoek-van Beurden P.A. Von den Hoff J.W. Biotechniques. 2005; 38: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). DQ-gelatin was dissolved in a concentration of 1 mg/ml in water and then 1:10 diluted in 1% (w/v) low gelling temperature-agarose (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline. The mixture was put on top of the cells and covered with a coverslip. After gelling of the agar at 4 °C, the incubation was performed for 1 h at room temperature. Cleavage of DQ gelatin by MMPs resulted in a green fluorescent product (wavelengths: excitation, 495 nm; emission, 515 nm). Some SVZ neurospheres were incubated with GM601, a nonspecific inhibitor of MMP activity. Images were taken under a 63× objective of 2-photon laser confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc.), and fluorescent density was compared in control and ANG2 treatment groups. siRNA against mouse Tie2 (sequences are provided in supplemental Data I), purchased from Dharmacon (Chicago, IL, catalog #M-045325-01) and siGLO (Dharmacon, catalog #D-001630-02), was used as the negative control. siRNAs were introduced into cells using a NucleofectorTM kit (Amaxa, Germany). Briefly, 200 pmol/well siRNAs were mixed with 100 μl of Nucleofector solution, and cell-DNA mixtures were transferred into a cuvette and electroporated using program A33. Total RNAs or proteins were extracted at 24 or 72 h after nucleofection for the following experiment. To examine the effects of ANG2 on SVZ cell proliferation, single cells at a density of 10 cells/μl were incubated in the growth medium for 7 days, and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd, 30 μg/ml, Sigma) was added 18 h before the termination of incubation (34Wang L. Zhang Z.G. Zhang R.L. Jiao Z.X. Wang Y. Pourabdollah-Nejad D.S. LeTourneau Y. Gregg S.R. Chopp M. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2006; 26: 556-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The percentage of BrdUrd-positive cells was measured. To examine the effects of ANG2 on SVZ cell differentiation, neurospheres were plated directly onto laminin-coated glass coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum, which is referred to as differentiation medium, in the presence of various concentrations of recombinant human ANG2 (rhANG2). Every 4 days, half of the medium was replaced with fresh medium. Incubation was terminated 10 days after plating, and immunostaining for neuronal and astrocyte markers was performed for evaluation of cell differentiation. To assay the migration of ANG2 treated cells, we employed a Matrigel assay that had been used for measurements of neural progenitor cell motility (40Liu X.S. Zhang Z.G. Zhang R.L. Gregg S.R. Wang L. Yier T. Chopp M. J. Neurosci Res. 2007; 85: 2120-2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, a single neurosphere was seeded in the Matrigel of 96-well plates for 48 h. Migration of cells out of the neurosphere was measured at 0 and 48 h after seeding. Single, double, and triple immunofluorescent staining was performed on brain coronal sections and cultured cells, as previously described (9Zhang R.L. Zhang Z.G. Zhang L. Chopp M.

The following primary antibodies were used in the present study: mouse anti-BrdUrd (1:100; Roche Applied Science), mouse anti-β-III tubulin (TuJ-1, 1:500; Covance the Development Services Co.), rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, 1:500; Dako Cytomation California Inc., Carpinteria, CA), rabbit anti-ANG2 (1:500, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), rabbit anti-ANG1 (1:500, Abcam), anti-mouse nestin (1:100, Pharmingen, San Jose, CA), goat anti-sox2 (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc), goat anti-doublecortin (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc). Cultured cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline with 1% bovine serum albumin goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with the primary antibodies listed above and with CY3 or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies. Nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1:10,000, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Measurements of ANG2 immunoreactive cells were performed on five coronal sections per mouse subjected to 7 days after MCAo (34Wang L. Zhang Z.G. Zhang R.L. Jiao Z.X. Wang Y. Pourabdollah-Nejad D.S. LeTourneau Y. Gregg S.R. Chopp M. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2006; 26: 556-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). ANG2-positive areas in the ipsilateral SVZ were digitized under a 20× objective (Olympus BX40) with use of a 3-CCD color video camera (Sony DXC-970MD) interfaced with an MCID image analysis system (Imaging Research, St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada). ANG2 immunoreactive areas within the SVZ were determined by setting a threshold to distinguish signals from the background based on the original images. The data are presented as a percentage of positive immunoreactive area in the SVZ. For cultured cells, eight fields per well were randomly selected. The number of BrdUrd-, TuJ1-, and GFAP-positive cells as well as total 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole nuclei was counted under a 40× objective (IX71; Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan), and the percentage of each cell type was determined. One-way analysis of variance or the Student-Newman-Keuls test was applied for multiple or two group comparisons, respectively. To analyze the effect of GM6001 on gelatinase activity in the absence or the presence of rhANG2, we designed a method. By assuming a treatment factor (T), rhANG2 (absence or presence), and a blocker factor (B), GM6001 (absence or presence) in which each has two levels (0, 1), response variable (changes of fluorescence, yij), and expected value of yij (μij), E(yij) = μij with indexes of rhANG2 treatment (i) and GM6001 (j). We used the complete 2 × 2 factorial design and two-way analysis of variance to analyze the effect of rhANG2 on MMP signals detected by in situ zymography. The analysis began with testing for T by B interaction using PROC MIXED in SAS with a contract statement, L = (μ11 − μ01) − (μ10 − μ00), followed by evaluating additive or sub-additive effects of the two factors of treatment and condition. The sub-additive effects would be identified if L<0 or (μ11 − μ01) − (μ10 − μ00), indicating that the rhANG2 treatment effect is greatly reduced in the presence of GM6001 compared with the rhANG2 treatment effect in the absence of GM6001. The data are presented as means ± S.D. A value of p < 0.05 was taken as significant. To analyze the effects of stroke on ANG expression in neural progenitor cells, SVZ cells from non-ischemic mice or mice subjected to 7 days after MCAo were isolated using LCM. Real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that SVZ cells expressed ANG2 under non-ischemic conditions (Fig. 1A). However, mRNA levels of"

In the present study we examined the effects of timing and routes of administration of bone marrow cells (BMC) post-myocardial infarction (MI) and the efficacy of an injectable biopolymer scaffold to improve cardiac cell retention and function. Methodology/Principal Findings 99mTc-labeled BMC (6×106 cells) were injected by 4 different routes in adult rats: intravenous (IV), left ventricular cavity (LV), left ventricular cavity with temporal aorta occlusion (LV+) to mimic coronary injection, and intramyocardial (IM). The injections were performed 1, 2, 3, or 7 days post-MI and cell retention was estimated by γ-emission counting of the organs excised 24 hs after cell injection. IM injection improved cell retention and attenuated cardiac dysfunction, whereas IV, LV or LV* routes were somewhat inefficient (<1%). Cardiac BMC retention was not influenced by timing except for the IM injection that showed greater cell retention at 7 (16%) vs. 1, 2 or 3 (average of 7%) days post-MI. Cardiac cell retention was further improved by an injectable fibrin scaffold at day 3 post-MI (17 vs. 7%), even though morphometric and function parameters evaluated 4 weeks later displayed similar improvements. Conclusions/Significance These results show that cells injected post-MI display comparable tissue distribution profile regardless of the route of injection and that there is no time effect for cardiac cell accumulation for injections performed 1 to 3 days post-MI. As expected the IM injection is the most efficient for cardiac cell retention, it can be further improved by co-injection with a fibrin scaffold and it significantly attenuates cardiac dysfunction evaluated 4 weeks post myocardial infarction. These pharmacokinetic data obtained under similar experimental conditions are essential for further development of these novel approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2134307466,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative pathogenic bacterium with a high adaptive potential that allows proliferation in a broad range of hosts or niches. It is also the causative agent of both acute and chronic biofilm-related infections in humans. Three cup gene clusters (cupA-C), involved in the assembly of cell surface fimbriae, have been shown to be involved in biofilm formation by the P. aeruginosa strains PAO1 or PAK. In PA14 isolates, a fourth cluster, named cupD, was identified within a pathogenicity island, PAPI-I, and may contribute to the higher virulence of this strain. Expression of the cupA genes is controlled by the HNS-like protein MvaT, whereas the cupB and cupC genes are under the control of the RocS1A1R two-component system. In this study, we show that cupD gene expression is positively controlled by the response regulator RcsB. As a consequence, CupD fimbriae are assembled on the cell surface, which results in a number of phenotypes such as a small colony morphotype, increased biofilm formation and decreased motility. These behaviors are compatible with the sessile bacterial lifestyle. The balance between planktonic and sessile lifestyles is known to be linked to the intracellular levels of c-di-GMP with high levels favoring biofilm formation. We showed that the EAL domain-containing PvrR response regulator counteracts the activity of RcsB on cupD gene expression. The action of PvrR is likely to involve c-di-GMP degradation through phosphodiesterase activity, confirming the key role of this second messenger in the balance between bacterial lifestyles. The regulatory network between RcsB and PvrR remains to be elucidated, but it stands as a potential model system to study how the equilibrium between the two lifestyles could be influenced by therapeutic agents that favor the planktonic lifestyle. This would render the pathogen accessible for the immune system or conventional antibiotic treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1984287060,"Disruption of the postsynaptic density (PSD), a network of scaffold proteins located in dendritic spines, is thought to be responsible for synaptic dysfunction and loss in early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD). Extending our previous demonstration that derangement of the PSD by soluble amyloid-β (Aβ) involves proteasomal degradation of PSD-95, a protein important for ionotropic glutamate receptor trafficking, we now show that Aβ also disrupts two other scaffold proteins, Homer1b and Shank1, that couple PSD-95 with ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors. Treatment of fronto-cortical neurons with soluble Aβ results in rapid (within 1 h) and significant thinning of the PSD, decreased synaptic levels of Homer1b and Shank1, and reduced synaptic mGluR1 levels. We show that de novo protein synthesis is required for the declustering effects of Aβ on Homer1b (but not Shank1) and that, in contrast to PSD-95, Aβ-induced Homer1b and Shank1 cluster disassembly does not depend on proteasome activity. The regulation of Homer1b and Shank1 by Aβ diverges in two other respects: i) whereas the activity of both NMDAR and VDCC is required for Aβ-induced declustering of Homer1b, Aβ-induced declustering of Shank1 only requires NMDAR activity; and ii) whereas the effects of Aβ on Homer1b involve engagement of the PI-3K pathway and calcineurin phosphatase (PP2B) activity, those on Shank1 involve activation of the ERK pathway. In summary, soluble Aβ recruits discrete signalling pathways to rapidly reduce the synaptic localization of major components of the PSD and to regulate the availability of mGluR1 in the synapse."
https://openalex.org/W2027580314,"India is an increasingly influential player in the global pharmaceutical market. Key parts of the drug regulatory system are controlled by the states, each of which applies its own standards for enforcement, not always consistent with others. A pilot study was conducted in two major cities in India, Delhi and Chennai, to explore the question/hypothesis/extent of substandard and counterfeit drugs available in the market and to discuss how the Indian state and federal governments could improve drug regulation and more importantly regulatory enforcement to combat these drugs.Random samples of antimalarial, antibiotic, and antimycobacterial drugs were collected from pharmacies in urban and peri-urban areas of Delhi and Chennai, India. Semi-quantitative thin-layer chromatography and disintegration testing were used to measure the concentration of active ingredients against internationally acceptable standards. 12% of all samples tested from Delhi failed either one or both tests, and were substandard. 5% of all samples tested from Chennai failed either one or both tests, and were substandard. Spatial heterogeneity between pharmacies was observed, with some having more or less substandard drugs (30% and 0% respectively), as was product heterogeneity, with some drugs being more or less frequently substandard (12% and 7% respectively).In a study using basic field-deployable techniques of lesser sensitivity rather than the most advanced laboratory-based techniques, the prevalence of substandard drugs in Delhi and Chennai is confirmed to be roughly in accordance with the Indian government's current estimates. However, important spatial and product heterogeneity exists, which suggests that India's substandard drug problem is not ubiquitous, but driven by a subset of manufacturers and pharmacies which thrive in an inadequately regulated environment. It is likely that the drug regulatory system in India needs to be improved for domestic consumption, and because India is an increasingly important exporter of drugs for both developed and developing countries. Some poor countries with high burdens of disease have weak drug regulatory systems and import many HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria drugs from India."
https://openalex.org/W2163443752,"Alpha-helix based protein networks as they appear in intermediate filaments in the cell's cytoskeleton and the nuclear membrane robustly withstand large deformation of up to several hundred percent strain, despite the presence of structural imperfections or flaws. This performance is not achieved by most synthetic materials, which typically fail at much smaller deformation and show a great sensitivity to the existence of structural flaws. Here we report a series of molecular dynamics simulations with a simple coarse-grained multi-scale model of alpha-helical protein domains, explaining the structural and mechanistic basis for this observed behavior. We find that the characteristic properties of alpha-helix based protein networks are due to the particular nanomechanical properties of their protein constituents, enabling the formation of large dissipative yield regions around structural flaws, effectively protecting the protein network against catastrophic failure. We show that the key for these self protecting properties is a geometric transformation of the crack shape that significantly reduces the stress concentration at corners. Specifically, our analysis demonstrates that the failure strain of alpha-helix based protein networks is insensitive to the presence of structural flaws in the protein network, only marginally affecting their overall strength. Our findings may help to explain the ability of cells to undergo large deformation without catastrophic failure while providing significant mechanical resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1966902878,"Background Intracellular pathogens have developed elaborate strategies for silent infection of preferred host cells. Chlamydia pneumoniae is a common pathogen in acute infections of the respiratory tract (e.g. pneumonia) and associated with chronic lung sequelae in adults and children. Within the lung, alveolar macrophages and polymorph nuclear neutrophils (PMN) are the first line of defense against bacteria, but also preferred host phagocytes of chlamydiae. Methodology/Principal Findings We could show that C. pneumoniae easily infect and hide inside neutrophil granulocytes until these cells become apoptotic and are subsequently taken up by macrophages. C. pneumoniae infection of macrophages via apoptotic PMN results in enhanced replicative activity of chlamydiae when compared to direct infection of macrophages, which results in persistence of the pathogen. Inhibition of the apoptotic recognition of C. pneumoniae infected PMN using PS- masking Annexin A5 significantly lowered the transmission of chlamydial infection to macrophages. Transfer of apoptotic C. pneumoniae infected PMN to macrophages resulted in an increased TGF-ß production, whereas direct infection of macrophages with chlamydiae was characterized by an enhanced TNF-α response. Conclusions/Significance Taken together, our data suggest that C. pneumoniae uses neutrophil granulocytes to be silently taken up by long-lived macrophages, which allows for efficient propagation and immune protection within the human host."
https://openalex.org/W2012355510,"Background Identifying the molecular mechanisms and neural circuits that control learning and memory are major challenges in neuroscience. Mammalian MAGI/S-SCAM is a multi-PDZ domain synaptic scaffolding protein that interacts with a number of postsynaptic signaling proteins and is thereby thought to regulate synaptic plasticity [1], [2], [3]. Principal Findings While investigating the behavioral defects of C. elegans nematodes carrying a mutation in the single MAGI ortholog magi-1, we have identified specific neurons that require MAGI-1 function for different aspects of associative learning and memory. Various sensory stimuli and a food deprivation signal are associated in RIA interneurons during learning, while additional expression of MAGI-1 in glutamatergic AVA, AVD and possibly AVE interneurons is required for efficient memory consolidation, i.e. the ability to retain the conditioned changes in behavior over time. During associative learning, MAGI-1 in RIA neurons controls in a cell non-autonomous fashion the dynamic remodeling of AVA, AVD and AVE synapses containing the ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) GLR-1 [4]. During memory consolidation, however, MAGI-1 controls GLR-1 clustering in AVA and AVD interneurons cell-autonomously and depends on the ability to interact with the β-catenin HMP-2. Significance Together, these results indicate that different aspects of associative learning and memory in C. elegans are likely carried out by distinct subsets of interneurons. The synaptic scaffolding protein MAGI-1 plays a critical role in these processes in part by regulating the clustering of iGluRs at synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2008173040,"Although increased intracellular concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) are associated with inhibition of 26 S proteasomal activity, the mechanisms responsible for such effects have not been well delineated. In the present studies, we found that direct exposure of purified 26 S proteasomes to H2O2 had negligible effects on their activity, whereas incubation with glutathione and H2O2 produced >80% decrease in chymotrypsin-like and trypsin-like activities. Rpn1 and Rpn2, which are subunits of the 19 S regulatory particle, undergo S-glutathionylation after exposure of purified 26 S proteasomes to glutathione and H2O2, as well as in HEK 293 cells and neutrophils incubated with H2O2. Increased oxidation of Rpn1 and Rpn2 cysteine thiols was also found in lung extracts from mice in which catalase was inactivated, a condition associated with augmented intracellular concentrations of H2O2 and diminished 26 S proteasomal activity. Although unoxidized Rpn2 enhanced 20 S proteolytic function in vitro, such potentiation was not found when the 20 S core particle was incubated with oxidized Rpn2. The composition of 26 S proteasomes was not altered after exposure to glutathione and H2O2, with similar amounts of Rpn1 and Rpn2 in control or oxidized 26 S proteasomal complexes. These findings identify S-glutathionylation of Rpn2 as a contributory mechanism for H2O2-induced inhibition of 26 S proteasomal function."
https://openalex.org/W2039512924,"Helicobacter pylori CagA plays a key role in gastric carcinogenesis. Upon delivery into gastric epithelial cells, CagA binds and deregulates SHP-2 phosphatase, a bona fide oncoprotein, thereby causing sustained ERK activation and impaired focal adhesions. CagA also binds and inhibits PAR1b/MARK2, one of the four members of the PAR1 family of kinases, to elicit epithelial polarity defect. In nonpolarized gastric epithelial cells, CagA induces the hummingbird phenotype, an extremely elongated cell shape characterized by a rear retraction defect. This morphological change is dependent on CagA-deregulated SHP-2 and is thus thought to reflect the oncogenic potential of CagA. In this study, we investigated the role of the PAR1 family of kinases in the hummingbird phenotype. We found that CagA binds not only PAR1b but also other PAR1 isoforms, with order of strength as follows: PAR1b > PAR1d >or= PAR1a > PAR1c. Binding of CagA with PAR1 isoforms inhibits the kinase activity. This abolishes the ability of PAR1 to destabilize microtubules and thereby promotes disassembly of focal adhesions, which contributes to the hummingbird phenotype. Consistently, PAR1 knockdown potentiates induction of the hummingbird phenotype by CagA. The morphogenetic activity of CagA was also found to be augmented through inhibition of non-muscle myosin II. Because myosin II is functionally associated with PAR1, perturbation of PAR1-regulated myosin II by CagA may underlie the defect of rear retraction in the hummingbird phenotype. Our findings reveal that CagA systemically inhibits PAR1 family kinases and indicate that malfunctioning of microtubules and myosin II by CagA-mediated PAR1 inhibition cooperates with deregulated SHP-2 in the morphogenetic activity of CagA."
https://openalex.org/W2149656912,"During inflammatory diseases, serum amyloid A (SAA), an acute-phase apolipoprotein of HDL, can assemble into tissue deposits called AA amyloids. The mechanism and physiological factors promoting amyloidosis are largely unknown but likely involve heparan sulfate (HS), a glycosaminoglycan colocalized with all types of amyloids. In this study, we explored HDL-SAA:HS interactions using in vitro and cell culture assays to identify HS-binding domains that promote the conversion of native SAA into AA amyloid. HS causes the remodeling of HDL-SAA at mildly acidic pH, producing SAA-rich aggregates. A sequence motif in SAA responsible for this conversion was identified that contains a pH-sensitive heparin/HS-binding site, functions as a ligand for a cell surface receptor, and acts as a structural focal point for SAAaggregation. Synthetic peptides corresponding to this region promoted the deposition of AA amyloid in a monocyte culture model for AA amyloidogenesis. The effects were peptide sequence specific and reliant on the protonation of H36. We conclude that a highly conserved motif required for SAA binding to macrophages can, under acidic pH conditions and in an HS-dependent manner, also act as a molecular switch, directing SAA misfolding into AA amyloid. Similar histidine-dependent HS-binding sites are also found in other amyloidogenic polypeptides.—Elimova, E., Kisilevsky, R., Ancsin, J. B.

https://openalex.org/W2171342228,"The human immunodeficiency virus, type 1, transactivating protein Tat is a small protein that is strictly required for viral transcription and multiplication within infected cells. The infected cells actively secrete Tat using an unconventional secretion pathway. Extracellular Tat can affect different cell types and induce severe cell dysfunctions ranging from cell activation to cell death. To elicit most cell responses, Tat needs to reach the cell cytosol. To this end, Tat is endocytosed, and low endosomal pH will then trigger Tat translocation to the cytosol. Although this translocation step is critical for Tat cytosolic delivery, how Tat could interact with the endosome membrane is unknown, and the key residues involved in this interaction require identification. We found that, upon acidification below pH 6.0 (i.e. within the endosomal pH range), Tat inserts into model membranes such as monolayers or lipid vesicles. This insertion process relies on Tat single Trp, Trp-11, which is not needed for transactivation and could be replaced by another aromatic residue for membrane insertion. Nevertheless, Trp-11 is strictly required for translocation. Tat conformational changes induced by low pH involve a sensor made of its first acidic residue (Glu/Asp-2) and the end of its basic domain (residues 55-57). Mutation of one of these elements results in membrane insertion above pH 6.5. Tat basic domain is also required for efficient Tat endocytosis and membrane insertion. Together with the strict conservation of Tat Trp among different virus isolates, our results point to an important role for Tat-membrane interaction in the multiplication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1."
https://openalex.org/W2065570876,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease of unknown cause characterized by expansion of autoreactive lymphocytes. Regulatory T cells (T(regs)) are a component of the normal immune system and contribute to the maintenance of peripheral tolerance. T(reg) abnormalities have been associated with several autoimmune diseases and there is interest in the role of T(regs) in SLE. We previously demonstrated that transfer of expanded CD4(+)CD25(+)CD62L(HI) T(regs) slows the development of lupus in (NZBxNZW)F(1) (B/W) mice. However in the absence of T(reg) specific surface antigens, cell purification remains a compromise between the breadth and purity of the population isolated. Importantly, purified populations always contain Foxp3(-) effector T cells (T(effs)) that theoretically could exacerbate autoimmunity in the recipient. Here we explore the impact of transferring the more comprehensive, but less pure T(reg) subset defined by CD4(+)CD25(+) expression on development of murine lupus. All cells were FACS sorted and expanded prior to adoptive transfer. Development of proteinuria and survival were measured. We found that exogenous expansion of CD4(+)CD25(+) cells produced a population containing 70-85% CD4(+)Foxp3(+)T(regs). Expanded T(regs) had higher CTLA-4 and Foxp3 expression, increased in vitro suppression capacity, and prolonged in vivo survival as compared to freshly isolated cells. Adoptive transfer of expanded CD4(+)CD25(+) T(regs) inhibited the onset of glomerulonephritis and prolonged survival in mice. Importantly the population of T(eff) contained within the adoptively transferred cells had reduced survival and proliferation capacity as compared to either co-transferred T(regs) or transferred T(effs) expanded in the absence of T(regs). These studies demonstrate that adoptive transfer of expanded CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+)T(regs) has the capacity to inhibit the onset of murine lupus and that this capacity is significant despite transfer of co-cultured T(eff) cells. These data indicate that when co-expanded with regulatory T cells, exogenously activated T(effs) from autoimmune patients may not pose a significant risk of promoting disease."
https://openalex.org/W2040455679,"Bile acids have been reported to induce epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation and subsequent proliferation of activated hepatic stellate cells (HSC), but the underlying mechanisms and whether quiescent HSC are also a target for bile acid-induced proliferation or apoptosis remained unclear. Therefore, primary rat HSC were cultured for up to 48 h and analyzed for their proliferative/apoptotic responses toward bile acids. Hydrophobic bile acids, i.e. taurolithocholate 3-sulfate, taurochenodeoxycholate, and glycochenodeoxycholate, but not taurocholate or tauroursodeoxycholate, induced Yes-dependent EGFR phosphorylation. Simultaneously, hydrophobic bile acids induced phosphorylation of the NADPH oxidase subunit p47(phox) and formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS production was sensitive to inhibition of acidic sphingomyelinase, protein kinase Czeta, and NADPH oxidases. All maneuvers which prevented bile acid-induced ROS formation also prevented Yes and subsequent EGFR phosphorylation. Taurolithocholate 3-sulfate-induced EGFR activation was followed by extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, but not c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, and stimulated HSC proliferation. When, however, a JNK signal was induced by coadministration of cycloheximide or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), activated EGFR associated with CD95 and triggered EGFR-mediated CD95-tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent formation of the death-inducing signaling complex. In conclusion, hydrophobic bile acids lead to a NADPH oxidase-driven ROS generation followed by a Yes-mediated EGFR activation in quiescent primary rat HSC. This proliferative signal shifts to an apoptotic signal when a JNK signal simultaneously comes into play."
https://openalex.org/W2014115208,"The investigation of rare familial forms of kidney cancer has provided important insights into the biology of sporadic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In particular, the identification of the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) familial cancer syndrome gene (VHL) provided the basis for the discovery that VHL is somatically inactivated in most sporadic clear cell RCC. Many cases of familial RCC do not have mutations in known RCC susceptibility genes and there is evidence that genetic modifiers may influence the risk of RCC in VHL disease patients. Hence we hypothesised that low-penetrance functional genetic variants in pathways related to the VHL protein (pVHL) function might (a) modify the phenotypic expression of VHL disease and/or (b) predispose to sporadic RCC.We tested this hypothesis for functional polymorphisms in CDH1 (rs16260), IGFBP3 (rs2854744), MMP1 (rs1799750), MMP3 (rs679620), STK15 (rs2273535) and VEGF (rs1570360). We observed that variants of MMP1 and MMP3 were significant modifiers of RCC risk (and risks of retinal angioma and cerebellar haemangioblastoma) in VHL disease patients. In addition, higher frequencies of the MMP1 rs1799750 2G allele (p = 0.017, OR 1.49, 95%CI 1.06-2.08) and the MMP1/MMP3 rs1799750/rs679620 2G/G haplotype (OR 1.45, 95%CI 1.01-2.10) were detected in sporadic RCC patients than in controls (n = 295).These findings (a) represent the first example of genetic modifiers of RCC risk in VHL disease, (b) replicate a previous report of an association between MMP1/MMP3 variants and sporadic RCC and (c) further implicate MMP1/MMP3-related pathways in the pathogenesis of familial and sporadic RCC."
https://openalex.org/W2155944192,"The ""four-eyed"" fish Anableps anableps has numerous morphological adaptations that enable above and below-water vision. Here, as the first step in our efforts to identify molecular adaptations for aerial and aquatic vision in this species, we describe the A. anableps visual opsin repertoire. We used PCR, cloning, and sequencing to survey cDNA using unique primers designed to amplify eight sequences from five visual opsin gene subfamilies, SWS1, SWS2, RH1, RH2, and LWS. We also used Southern blotting to count opsin loci in genomic DNA digested with EcoR1 and BamH1. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed the identity of all opsin sequences and allowed us to map gene duplication and divergence events onto a tree of teleost fish. Each of the gene-specific primer sets produced an amplicon from cDNA, indicating that A. anableps possessed and expressed at least eight opsin genes. A second PCR-based survey of genomic and cDNA uncovered two additional LWS genes. Thus, A. anableps has at least ten visual opsins and all but one were expressed in the eyes of the single adult surveyed. Among these ten visual opsins, two have key site haplotypes not found in other fish. Of particular interest is the A. anableps-specific opsin in the LWS subfamily, S180gamma, with a SHYAA five key site haplotype. Although A. anableps has a visual opsin gene repertoire similar to that found in other fishes in the suborder Cyprinodontoidei, the LWS opsin subfamily has two loci not found in close relatives, including one with a key site haplotype not found in any other fish species. A. anableps opsin sequence data will be used to design in situ probes allowing us to test the hypothesis that opsin gene expression differs in the distinct ventral and dorsal retinas found in this species."
https://openalex.org/W1979666164,"Mitosis is an orchestration of dynamic interactions between spindle microtubules and chromosomes, which is mediated by protein structures that include the kinetochores, and other protein complexes present on chromosomes. PinX1 is a potent telomerase inhibitor in interphase; however, its function in mitosis is not well documented. Here we show that PinX1 is essential for faithful chromosome segregation. Deconvolution microscopic analyses show that PinX1 localizes to nucleoli and telomeres in interphase and relocates to the periphery of chromosomes and the outer plate of the kinetochores in mitosis. Our deletion analyses mapped the kinetochore localization domain of PinX1 to the central region and its chromosome periphery localization domain to the C terminus. Interestingly, the kinetochore localization of PinX1 is dependent on Hec1 and CENP-E. Our biochemical characterization revealed that PinX1 is a novel microtubule-binding protein. Our real time imaging analyses show that suppression of PinX1 by small interference RNA abrogates faithful chromosome segregation and results in anaphase chromatid bridges in mitosis and micronuclei in interphase, suggesting an essential role of PinX1 in chromosome stability. Taken together, the results indicate that PinX1 plays an important role in faithful chromosome segregation in mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W1981672797,"Diploid males in hymenopterans are generally either inviable or sterile, thus imposing a severe genetic load on populations. In species with the widespread single locus complementary sex determination (sl-CSD), sex depends on the genotype at one single locus with multiple alleles. Haploid (hemizygous) individuals are always males. Diploid individuals develop into females when heterozygous and into males when homozygous at the sex determining locus. Our comparison of the mating and reproductive success of haploid and diploid males revealed that diploid males of the braconid parasitoid Cotesia glomerata sire viable and fertile diploid daughters. Females mated to diploid males, however, produced fewer daughters than females mated to haploid males. Nevertheless, females did not discriminate against diploid males as mating partners. Diploid males initiated courtship display sooner than haploid males and were larger in body size. Although in most species so far examined diploid males were recognized as genetic dead ends, we present a second example of a species with sl-CSD and commonly occurring functionally reproductive diploid males. Our study suggests that functionally reproductive diploid males might not be as rare as hitherto assumed. We argue that the frequent occurrence of inbreeding in combination with imperfect behavioural adaptations towards its avoidance promote the evolution of diploid male fertility."
https://openalex.org/W1974947279,"Epac2 is a member of the family of exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP (Epac). Our previous studies suggest a model of Epac activation in which cAMP binding to the enzyme induces a localized “hinge” motion that reorients the regulatory lobe relative to the catalytic lobe without inducing large conformational changes within individual lobes. In this study, we identified the location of the major hinge in Epac2 by normal mode motion correlation and structural alignment analyses. Targeted mutagenesis was then performed to test the functional importance of hinge bending for Epac activation. We show that substitution of the conserved residue phenylalanine 435 with glycine (F435G) facilitates the hinge bending and leads to a constitutively active Epac2 capable of stimulating nucleotide exchange in the absence of cAMP. In contrast, substitution of the same residue with a bulkier side chain, tryptophan (F435W), impedes the hinge motion and results in a dramatic decrease in Epac2 catalytic activity. Structural parameters determined by small angle x-ray scattering further reveal that whereas the F435G mutant assumes a more extended conformation in the absence of cAMP, the F435W mutant is incapable of adopting the fully extended and active conformation in the presence of cAMP. These findings demonstrate the importance of hinge motion in Epac activation. Our study also suggests that phenylalanine at position 435 is the optimal size side chain to keep Epac closed and inactive in the absence of cAMP while still allowing the proper hinge motion for full Epac extension and activation in the presence of cAMP.

Unlike the classic eukaryotic cAMP receptor, cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A; PKA), Epac proteins do not function as protein kinases that phosphorylate downstream substrates. Instead, they act as guanine nucleotide exchange factors and exert their functions by activating small GTP-binding proteins, Rap1 and Rap2. At the cellular level, Epac proteins assume distinct subcellular localization (3.Qiao J. Mei F.C. Popov V.L. Vergara L.A. Cheng X. J. Biol.

In depth structural and biophysical analyses of CBDs in several CBD-containing families, including cAMP receptor proteins, PKAs, and cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels, have revealed a conserved structural core as well as functional motifs important for cyclic nucleotide-induced activation (8.Knighton D.R.

The CBD is composed of an eight-strand β-barrel core that forms the base of the nucleotide binding pocket and a lateral α-helical bundle subdomain. Although the β-barrel core remains relatively constant between the ligand-free and nucleotide-bound states, binding of cAMP to a CBD leads to significant conformational changes in the overall arrangement of the α-helical bundle subdomain. A general mechanism of cyclic nucleotide-induced activation of CBD-containing proteins has been recently proposed (12.Rehmann H. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In this model, binding of cAMP leads to the retraction of the phosphate-binding cassette toward the cyclic nucleotide binding pocket and consequently releases the steric hindrance imposed on the α-helix C-terminal to the β-barrel, termed the CBD lid, by a conserved hydrophobic residue within the phosphate-binding cassette. These structural changes result in a hinge motion that allows the lid to move closer to the β-barrel core and to interact with the base of the cyclic nucleotide. The recently solved crystal structure of Epac2 reveals that, unlike other CBD-containing proteins, the corresponding lid region in Epac points away from the cAMP binding pocket as a two-strand β-sheet that forms the first part of the five-strand β-sheet “switchboard” structure (13.Rehmann H. Das J. Knipscheer P. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 2006; 439: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Although this major structural difference suggests that the detailed mechanisms of PKA and Epac activation by cAMP will most likely be different at the atomic level, it is not clear if the aforementioned general mechanism, namely the hinge motion, is conserved during Epac activation. To address this important question, we determined the effects of targeted hinge perturbations on Epac activation using site-directed mutagenesis that specifically targeted a key residue in the hinge region of Epac2. Recombinant full-length Epac2 and C-terminal truncated Rap1-(1–167) were expressed as GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli CK600K cells. Cell growth and protein induction for recombinant Epac2 were performed as described previously (14.Mei F.C. Cheng X.D. Mol. Biosyst. 2005; 1: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), except that 17 g/liter NaCl, 0.6 g/liter betaine, and 2.3 g/liter proline were added to the growth medium when the cell density reached 0.5, as measured by absorption at 600 nm. Recombinant Epac2 and Rap1-(1–167) with the GST tag cleaved were purified essentially as described by Rehmann et al. (15.Rehmann H. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 407: 159-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). All proteins used in this study were at least 95% pure, as judged by SDS-PAGE. F435G and F435W mutants of Epac2 were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All of the fluorescence measurements were performed at 23 °C using a FluoroMax-3 spectrofluorometer equipped with a thermostatic cell holder and a magnetic stirrer. Titration of the fluorescent cAMP analog, 8-NBD-cAMP, with purified Epac2 was carried out as described elsewhere (16.Kraemer A. Rehmann H.R. Cool R.H. Theiss C. de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Wittinghofer A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, an increasing amount of the protein was titrated into a cuvette containing 0.1 μm 8-NBD-cAMP in buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Fluorescence emission spectra between 500 and 600 nm were recorded with the excitation wavelength set at 471 nm. Fluorescence intensity at 540 nm was plotted as a function of protein concentration. A fluorescence-based assay was used to measure the in vitro GEF activity of Epac2 and its mutants using a C-terminal truncated Rap1-(1–167) as previously described (17.van den Berghe N. Cool R.H. Horn G. Wittinghofer A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.2 μm Rap1-(1–167) loaded with the fluorescent GDP analog, Mant-GDP, was incubated with 0.1 μm Epac2 in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled GDP (20 μm) and various concentrations of cAMP between 0 and 700 μm. Exchange of Mant-GDP by GDP was measured as a decrease in fluorescence intensity over time using excitation and emission wavelengths of 366 and 450 nm, respectively. Typically, decay in the fluorescence intensity was recorded over a time course of 6000 s for wild type (WT) and Epac2-F435G proteins or 10,000 s for the Epac2-F435W mutant, with data points taken every 60 s. The reaction rate constant (observed kGEF) was obtained by fitting the experimental data to a single exponential equation (15.Rehmann H. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 407: 159-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The observed kGEF versus cAMP concentration was used to calculate the activation constant, AC50, and turnover rate kmax, as described previously (18.Rehmann H. Rueppel A. Bos J.L. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23508-23514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Effects of Phe435 substitution with glycine or tryptophan on the association of Epac2 with Rap1B were examined by an affinity pull-down assay using purified recombinant proteins. GST-Rap1B affinity resin (4.1 mg of protein per 1 ml of beads) was prepared by incubation of purified GST-Rap1B with glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin in buffer C (40 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 160 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA), followed by an extensive wash with the buffer A. Rap1B affinity resin (15 μl) was incubated for 4 h with an equimolar amount of wild type or mutant Epac2 protein at 4 °C in buffer A in the absence or presence of 300 μm cAMP. At the end of the incubation, the resin was spun down and washed twice with 250 μl of the incubation buffer. Associated proteins were eluted from the beads with 15 mm GSH in 10 mm Tris and 300 mm NaCl (pH 8.0) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Control experiments were performed in parallel using an equal amount of glutathione-Sepharose beads only. SAXS data of Epac2 proteins in buffer A were collected at 12 °C on the University of Utah SAXSess (Anton Paar) instrument using CuKα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å) and an image plate detector. Two-dimensional data collected from the image plate were integrated to one dimension and reduced to I(Q) versus Q (where Q = 4π(sin θ)/λ) using the SAXSquant software package provided by the vendor. The net scattering from the protein was calculated by subtraction of a normalized buffer spectrum. For WT Epac2, different protein concentrations (between 1 and 15 mg/ml) were measured to determine the optimal concentration for SAXS measurements and to ensure that there were no concentration-dependent effects on the scattering due to protein aggregation or interparticle effects. The optimal concentration of WT Epac2, 2–5 mg/ml, was used for analysis of WT and mutant proteins. The probable distribution of vector lengths P(r) as a function of distance between scattering centers, r, was derived from the inverse Fourier transformation of I(Q) using the program GNOM (20.Svergun D.I. Semenyuk A.V. Feigin L.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1988; 44: 244-250Crossref Scopus (277) Google Scholar) over the Q-range 0.013–0.1551 Å−1. The boundary constraints of P(r) = 0 at r = 0 and at the maximum linear dimension, Dmax, were applied to P(r). A smearing correction was applied in GNOM to correct for the slit geometry of the SAXSess instrument. The radius of gyration, Rg, was determined by GNOM and by Guinier analysis. Guinier analysis indicated a linear fit at low Q (i.e. Q·Rg < 1.4), consistent with there being no significant nonspecific aggregation of the sample. Extensive structural analyses by x-ray crystallographic and solution biophysical techniques suggests that activation of Epac proteins by cAMP involves a hinge motion between the regulatory and catalytic lobes of the protein. To identify the precise location of the hinge, we subjected the apo-Epac2 crystal structure to further analysis using the HingeMaster software program that predicts the hinge location in a protein by integrating existing hinge predictors (TLSMD, StoneHinge, FlexOracle, and HingeSeq) with a family of novel hinge predictors based on grouping residues with correlated normal mode motions (21.Flores S.C. Keating K.S. Painter J. Morcos F. Nguyen K. Merritt E.A. Kuhn L.A. Gerstein M.B. Proteins. 2008; 73: 299-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Because each of these methods predicts hinges using very different sources of information (experimental thermal factors, bond constraint networks, energetics, and sequence and normal modes, respectively), HingeMaster improves predictions by integrating these complementary methods into a combined predictor using a weighted voting scheme. Our analysis revealed a major hinge in Epac2 around residues 438–439 (Fig. 1). Initial examination of this predicted hinge suggested that this is an unusual location in the structure for a hinge, since residues 438 and 439 are positioned in the middle of an α-helix in the apo-Epac2 crystal structure. However, careful sequence alignment and structural comparison between Epac and the regulatory subunits of PKA revealed that the predicted hinge region in Epac2 matches exactly with the hinge of the first CBD in PKA (Fig. 1B). To determine the functional importance of the proposed hinge motion in Epac activation, we targeted the conserved Phe435 residue by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 1B). Phe435 is one of the several conserved hydrophobic residues that have been previously identified to be potentially important for anchoring and stabilizing the hinge structure (22.Brock M. Fan F. Mei F.C. Li S. Gessner C. Woods Jr., V.L. Cheng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32256-32263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). If the hinge motion is important for Epac2 activation, loosening or stiffening of the hinge will probably enhance or suppress Epac2 activation, respectively. To test this hypothesis, we substituted the phenylalanine at 435 with either a glycine or a tryptophan to facilitate or interfere with hinge bending, respectively. The effect of these mutations on Epac2 GEF activity was examined using a fluorescence-based assay where Rap1-bound fluorescent Mant-GDP was exchanged against an excess of unlabeled free GDP. Released free Mant-GDP has a decreased fluorescence intensity compared with protein-bound Mant-GDP. Although WT Epac2 is not capable of stimulating Mant-GDP-dissociation in the absence of cAMP, increases in Epac2 GEF activity were observed as a function of cAMP concentration (Fig. 2A). When the observed rate of Mant-GDP release was plotted against the cAMP concentration (Fig. 2B), the maximal GEF rate (kmax) under saturating cAMP concentrations and the half-maximal activation constant (AC50) were calculated to be 0.72 × 10−3 s−1 and 20.2 μm, respectively (Table 1). These measurements are in excellent agreement with the literature values (15.Rehmann H. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 407: 159-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Catalytic parameters for WT and mutant Epac2 proteinsWT Epac2Epac2-F435GEpac2-F435Wk0 (s−1)ak0 and kmax are the apparent guanine nucleotide exchange rate under zero or saturating concentration of cAMP, respectively, whereas AC50 is the half-maximal activation constant.00.43 × 10−30kmax (s−1)ak0 and kmax are the apparent guanine nucleotide exchange rate under zero or saturating concentration of cAMP, respectively, whereas AC50 is the half-maximal activation constant.0.72 × 10−30.72 × 10−30.15 × 10−3AC50 (μm)ak0 and kmax are the apparent guanine nucleotide exchange rate under zero or saturating concentration of cAMP, respectively, whereas AC50 is the half-maximal activation constant.20.225.222.7a k0 and kmax are the apparent guanine nucleotide exchange rate under zero or saturating concentration of cAMP, respectively, whereas AC50 is the half-maximal activation constant. Open table in a new tab Unlike the WT protein, Epac2-F435G was capable of stimulating Mant-GDP dissociation in the absence of cAMP (Fig. 3A), indicating that Epac2-F435G exhibited partial constitutive activity. The addition of cAMP led to a further increase in GEF activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). Although the kmax and AC50 values of Epac2-F435G (0.72 × 10−3 s−1 and 25.2 μm, respectively) were essentially identical to that of the WT, the observed GEF rate (kGEF) of Epac2-F435G in the absence of cAMP was determined to be 0.43 × 10−3 s−1, more than 60% of the kmax. In contrast, substitution of Phe435 with the bulkier tryptophan side chain resulted in a dramatic decrease in the ability of Epac2 to stimulate the GEF activity of Rap1 (Figs. 3, C and D). Similar to the WT, Epac2-F435W was inactive without cAMP, but the kmax value (0.15 × 10−3 s−1) for Epac2-F435W in the presence of saturating cAMP was only 20% of the WT kmax value, whereas its AC50 value (22.7 μm) was no different from that of the WT or the Epac2-F435G mutant (Table 1). To further test whether hinge mutations at phenylalanine 435 affect interactions of Epac2 with Rap1B, we performed direct affinity pull-down experiments using GST-Rap1 and purified Epac2 proteins (WT, F435G, and F435W). These data are shown in Fig. 4. In the absence of cAMP, GST-Rap1 pulled down very little WT or F435W but did pull down significant amounts of F435G. In the presence of saturating cAMP concentrations, GST-Rap1 pulled down comparable amounts of WT and F435G Epac2 but very little F435W. These results are consistent with the enzymatic data obtained by measuring the GEF activity of Epac2 WT and mutant proteins (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3) and support the conclusion that the F435G hinge mutant interacts with Rap1 in the absence of cAMP, whereas the F435W mutant is impaired in its ability to interact with Rap1 even in the presence of saturating cAMP. To ensure that the mutations did not affect the structural integrity of the mutant proteins and their ability to bind cAMP, we measured the overall secondary structure and cAMP-binding affinity of the mutant Epac2 proteins. As shown in Fig. 5A, superimposable CD spectra were obtained using WT and mutant Epac2 proteins, suggesting that Epac2-F435G and Epac2-F435W were folded correctly with overall secondary structures identical to those of the WT protein. In addition, cAMP binding determined using the fluorescently labeled cAMP analog, 8-NBD-cAMP, showed superimposable binding isotherms (Fig. 5B), suggesting that both Epac2-F435G and Epac2-F435W mutants bound to cAMP with an affinity similar to that of the WT protein. These data clearly show that substitution of Phe435 with glycine or tryptophan does not significantly affect overall protein folding or cAMP binding activity. To investigate the corresponding structural perturbations introduced by F435G and F435W mutations, we monitored and compared the global solution structures of WT and mutant Epac2 proteins by SAXS. The SAXS curves (I(Q) versus Q) for the WT and mutant Epac2 are shown in Fig. 6, whereas the vector length distribution P(r) curves of the WT and mutant Epac2 proteins in the presence and absence of cAMP are shown in Fig. 7. The basic scattering parameters, Rg and Dmax, are summarized in Table 2. The P(r) curve for WT Epac2 suggests that it assumes a compact globular conformation with a Dmax value of ∼95 Å. Binding of cAMP to Epac2 led to significant increases in both Rg and Dmax, indicating that Epac2 assumes a much more extended or open conformation in the presence of cAMP (Fig. 7A and Table 2). The F435G mutant is less compact than the WT protein in the absence of cAMP, as reflected by a significant increase in Dmax (∼110 versus ∼95 Å) and Rg (38.0 versus 34.0 Å), and the F435G mutant is slightly more extended than the WT protein in the presence of cAMP (Dmax ∼140 Å versus ∼135 Å; Rg of 45.3 Å versus 44.2 Å; Fig. 7B and Table 2). In contrast, the F435W mutant is similar in overall shape to WT Epac2 in the absence of cAMP but does not become as extended (Dmax ∼125 Å, Rg of 42.4 Å) as WT or the F435G mutant in the presence of cAMP (Fig. 7C). These data are consistent with the notion that the hinge region plays a key role in the domain dynamics of Epac2 and illustrate that the size of a critical amino acid side chain proximal to the hinge region can affect the overall structure and domain dynamics of both the apo- and the cAMP-bound forms of Epac2.FIGURE 7P(r) versus r plots for WT and mutant Epac2 proteins.

They act as GEFs and exert their functions by activating small GTP-binding proteins, Rap1 and Rap2. Unlike PKA, Epac contains both catalytic and regulatory domains in a single polypeptide chain. Our previous studies suggest a model of Epac activation in which cAMP binding to the enzyme induces a localized “hinge” motion that reorients the regulatory domain relative to the catalytic domain without inducing large conformational changes within either of the individual domains (22.Brock M.

Cheng X. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15318-15326Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). If our hypothesis that cAMP-induced hinge motion is essential for Epac activation is correct, stabilization or disruption of the hinge bending will probably enhance or suppress cAMP-induced Epac activation, respectively. Thus, the validity of our hinge bending model of Epac activation can be tested using targeted mutagenesis of critical amino acids proximal to the interdomain hinge region. Sequence analysis using hinge prediction software reveals a potential interdomain hinge in Epac2 around residues 438–439, which corresponds to the interdomain hinge of the first CBD in PKA (Fig. 1). Based on our earlier structural modeling studies, the hinge bending in the cAMP-bound Epac CBD structure is maintained by hydrophobic interactions formed among Leu408, Phe435, and Leu439. All of these residues are conserved between the sole CBD of Epac1 and the second high affinity CBD of Epac2. In this report, we present structural and functional characterizations of two Epac2 mutants in which Phe435 has been substituted with either glycine or tryptophan to facilitate or interfere with the hinge bending, respectively. The GEF activities of the WT Epac2 and F435G mutant are essentially identical in the presence of saturating concentrations of cAMP. However, unlike WT Epac2, the Epac2-F435G mutant is able to partially activate Rap1 in the absence of cAMP. This suggests that the naturally occurring phenylalanine at position 435 restricts hinge motion just enough to fully inhibit GEF activity in the absence of cAMP but allows full hinge motion in the presence of cAMP. In contrast, the Epac2-F435W mutant is significantly less active than the WT enzyme in the presence of saturating concentrations of cAMP. These data are interpreted as being complementary to the effects of the F435G mutation and further support our prediction regarding the location and key role of interdomain “hinge” bending in Epac activation. The fact that Phe435 is highly conserved among Epac proteins is consistent with it being located at a critical position within the “hinge region” to optimally control coupling of cAMP binding to enzyme activation. It has been proposed that in solution Epac can exist in two conformations (active and inactive), which are in dynamic equilibrium (18.Rehmann H. Rueppel A. Bos J.L. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23508-23514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). According to this model, cAMP-free Epac exists predominantly in the inactive state, whereas protein in complex with cAMP adopts mostly an active conformation. Thus, this model describes Epac activation by cAMP as a shift of the preexisting equilibrium to the active state upon cAMP binding. Our results suggest that the hinge motion described in this study represents the major conformational change between the inactive and active states at equilibrium. Replacing phenylalanine with glycine at 435 allows more facile movement of domains on either side of the hinge and shifts the conformational equilibrium to the active conformation state in the absence of cAMP. On the basis of the enzyme activity analysis of the F435G mutant in the absence of cAMP (Fig. 3B), it is estimated that more than 60% of the Epac2-F435G protein can assume a conformational state that resembles the active cAMP-bound conformation of WT Epac2. Our steady-state SAXS results indicate that in solution the Epac2-F435G mutant and WT Epac2 have similar extended structures in the presence of cAMP. In the absence of cAMP, both structures are more compact, but the ensemble average conformation of the F435G mutant is more extended than WT Epac2, which might allow the catalytic domain of F435G mutant to interact with Rap1 in the absence of cAMP. In contrast, the F435W mutant is similar to WT Epac2 in the absence of cAMP, but this mutant does not become as extended as WT in the presence of cAMP. These data are consistent with our model regarding the role of the interdomain hinge region in mediating cAMP-regulated conformational changes and the essential role of Phe435 in regulating Epac2 domain dynamics. Indeed, the dynamic equilibrium between the active/extended and inactive/compact conformations of the protein in solution are reflected in the observed small angle x-ray scattering profile of the protein, which represents the time and ensemble average of these conformational states. The larger Rg and Dmax values of the F435G mutant in the absence of cAMP relative to WT indicate a shift in the conformational equilibrium toward the active/extended state, a state that can more readily interact with Rap1. In contrast, the smaller Rg and Dmax values (relative to WT) of the F435W mutant in the presence of cAMP indicate that this mutant cannot fully shift to the active/extended state due to restricted hinge motion. We have attempted to model our SAXS data using published Epac2 crystal structures. Although the calculated Rg (33 Å) value based on the apo-Epac2 structure is similar to the experimentally determined Rg (34 Å), the predicted SAXS curve calculated using CRYSOL based on the full-length apo-Epac2 crystal structure (2BYV) is significantly different from that of the experimentally measured apo-Epac2 scattering profile at Q values greater than 0.07 Å−1. Rigid body modeling using the program BUNCH led to a significant improvement of the overall fitting of the calculated and measured scattering profiles. However, the calculated and measured scattering profiles still differ significantly at higher Q values (>0.1 Å−1). These analyses suggest that the overall size and shape of Epac2 in solution is similar to that of Epac2 in the crystal structure but that there are differences. The differences are most likely because multiple conformational states of Epac2 exist in solution, all of which contribute to the observed SAXS profile, whereas the crystal structure of apo-Epac2 captures only a single stable conformation of the protein. This conclusion is consistent with the idea presented in this study that in solution Epac2 exists as a dynamic ensemble of multiple conformational states. To adequately model the conformational states contributing to the observed Epac2 SAXS data will require additional experimental data and more sophisticated structural modeling methods. During the preparation of our manuscript, an elegant x-ray crystal structure of a deletion Epac2, Δ(1–305)Epac2, in complex with Sp-cAMPS and Rap1B was published (24.Rehmann H. Arias-Palomo E. Hadders M.A. Schwede F. Llorca O. Bos J.L. Nature. 2008; 455: 124-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This 2.2 Å resolution structure indeed confirms that the major conformational change induced by binding of cAMP during Epac activation is a hinge motion. In fact, as predicted by the HingeMaster program, the pivot of the hinge is located exactly at residues 438 and 439 in the active Epac2 structure (Fig. 8), where the last two turns of the hinge helix “melt” to accommodate the hinge bending and consequently reorient the catalytic domain relative to the CBD domain (24.Rehmann H. Arias-Palomo E. Hadders M.A. Schwede F. Llorca O. Bos J.L. Nature. 2008; 455: 124-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Moreover, the bending of the hinge is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions formed among residues Leu408, Phe435, and Leu439 as well as the stacking of Leu449 to the adenine base of the cAMP, consistent with our earlier predictions based on homology modeling analyses (22.Brock M.

Cheng X. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15318-15326Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, unlike PKA and our earlier hypothesis, the lid of the CBD in cAMP-bound Epac2 structure is not a simple helix but instead consists of the C-terminal β-strands of the CBD and the first helix of the RAS exchange motif domain (24.Rehmann H. Arias-Palomo E. Hadders M.A. Schwede F. Llorca O. Bos J.L. Nature. 2008; 455: 124-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the results of the present study and the recent Epac2 crystal structure support a general activation mechanism, namely an interdomain hinge motion, for all CBD-containing proteins.

Aberrant function of the CCHCR1 gene (Coiled-Coil α-Helical Rod protein 1, HCR) within the PSORS1 locus may contribute to the onset of psoriasis. As CCHCR1 is expressed in certain cancers and regulates keratinocyte (KC) proliferation in a transgenic mouse model, we studied its relation to proliferation in cutaneous squamous cell cancer (SCC) cell lines by expression arrays and quantitative RT-PCR and in skin tumors by immunohistochemistry. CCHCR1 protein was detected in the pushing border of SCC and lining basal cell carcinoma islands. Different from psoriasis, Ki67 had a similar expression pattern as CCHCR1. The most intense CCHCR1 staining occurred in areas positive for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Expression of CCHCR1 mRNA was upregulated 30–80% in SCC lines when compared to normal KCs and correlated positively with Ki67 expression. The most aggressive and invasive tumor cell lines (RT3, FaDu) expressed CCHCR1 mRNA less than non-tumorigenic HaCaT cells. Moreover, the tumor promoters okadaic acid and menadione downregulated CCHCR1 mRNA. We conclude that both in psoriasis and the early stages of KC transformation, CCHCR1 may function as a negative regulator of proliferation, but beyond a certain point in oncogenesis cannot control this phenomenon any longer."

The epithelial and some other types of non-neuronal cells synthesize, degrade, and respond to acetylcholine (ACh) that functions outside the nervous system as an auto/paracrine hormone or a cytotransmitter (for a review, see Ref. 1Wessler I. Kirkpatrick C.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2008; 154: 1558-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). The non-neuronal ACh exhibits rapid and profound effects on gene expression due to activation of the muscarinic and nicotinic classes of cholinergic receptors coupling multiple signal transduction pathways. The muscarinic receptors are classic G protein-coupled transmembrane glycoproteins that mediate a metabolic response to ACh through the interactions of G proteins with signal transducing enzymes, leading to increases or decreases of second messengers, ion concentrations, and modulations of protein kinase activities. The nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs) are classic representatives of the superfamily of ligand-gated ion channel proteins, or ionotropic receptors, mediating the influx of Na+ and Ca2+ and efflux of K+ (2Steinbach J.H. Bock G. Marsh J. The Biology Of Nicotine Dependence (Meeting, London, England, UK, November 7–9, 1989). John Wiley and Sons Ltd., New York1990: 53-61Google Scholar). In neurons, binding of ACh to nAChRs leads to cell membrane depolarization that allows influx of Ca2+ through voltage-sensitive calcium channels. Although a high resolution patch clamping technique recorded single channel currents from outside-out patches excised from cultured human epidermal KCs stimulated with ACh, the KCs grown in the medium containing 0.09 mm Ca2+ only rarely showed ACh-activated currents (3Grando S.A.

There are many potential targets of these signaling cascades, including nuclear processes, metabolic pathways, and structural components of the cytoskeleton, but the receptor-mediated mechanisms of signal induction remain to be identified. It has been demonstrated that keratinocyte α7 nAChR directs chemotaxis of KCs, which is a critical early step in wound epithelialization, and that the downstream signaling from this receptor in KCs involves intracellular free Ca2+, CaMKII, PKC, PI3K, Jak2, and the Ras/Raf-1/MEK/ERK cascade and leads to up-regulation of α2-integrin gene expression (7Chernyavsky A.I.

Noteworthy is that PI3K plays a central role in coordinating Rho-mediated signaling events during cell migration (for a review, see Ref. 19Cain R.J. Ridley A.J. Biol. Cell. 2009; 101: 13-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). It is well known that α7 subunits form a homomeric receptor/channel that has a high relative permeability to Ca2+ (20Séguéla P.

Indeed Ca2+ ions that enter KCs through α7-containing ACh-gated ion channels can raise the concentration of intracellular free Ca2+ in KCs (11Grando S.A. Horton R.M. Mauro T.M. Kist D.A. Lee T.X.

Ther. 2000; 293: 973-981PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that ionic events contribute to the nicotinergic effects on KCs. However, experiments with several types of non-neuronal cells demonstrated that the nicotinergic effects can be elicited in the absence of Na+ or Ca2+ entry (23Tachikawa E. Takahashi S. Mizuma K.

Therefore, the downstream signaling from α7 nAChR expressed in KCs may also proceed via parallel, ionic, and protein kinase signaling pathways. In this study, we tested a hypothesis that the coordinated regulation of α2-integrin expression and reciprocal alterations in the cytoskeleton that mediate ACh control of keratinocyte lateral migration through α7 nAChR involves both ionic events and protein kinase signaling cascades. The results demonstrated the existence of the two-component signaling systems allowing simultaneous up-regulation of α2-integrin expression and ROK activation. The Raf/MEK1/ERK1/2 cascade up-regulating α2-integrin was activated due to both the Ca2+-dependent recruitment of CaMKII and PKC and the Ca2+-independent activation of Ras. Likewise the PI3K-mediated activation of ROK was elicited due to both Ca2+ entry-dependent involvement of CaMKII and Ca2+-independent activation of Jak2.

The cells were washed thrice with oxygenated Krebs-Ringer HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 125 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 25 mm HEPES, 5.6 mm glucose, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin with or without 2.6 mm CaCl2+ and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C with test compound dissolved in Krebs-Ringer HEPES buffer. Then the monolayers were washed with prewarmed keratinocyte growth medium and incubated in this medium for 1 h to recover. After that, the 3-h exposure to test compounds was repeated. Control cells were exposed to Krebs-Ringer HEPES buffer without test compounds. Some experimental cells were incubated in Na+-free sucrose buffer in which NaCl was replaced with an isotonic concentration of sucrose (270 mm) and Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, was used instead of HEPES. The predesigned and tested small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting human CHRNA7 (GenBankTM accession number NM_000746) mRNA sequence 5′-GGACAGAUCACUAUUUACA-3′ and negative control siRNA (siRNA-NC) targeting luciferase gene with the target sequence 5′-CGTACGCGGAATACTTCGA-3′ were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). For transfection with siRNAs, we followed the standard protocol described in detail elsewhere (8Chernyavsky A.I. Arredondo J. Karlsson E. Wessler I. Grando S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39220-39228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly KCs were treated with increasing concentrations of siRNA in the transfection solution with the DharmaFECTTM 1 siRNA Transfection Reagent (Dharmacon) for 16 h at 37 °C in a humid, 5% CO2 incubator. On the next day, the transfection medium was replaced by keratinocyte growth medium, and the cells were incubated for 72 h to determine at which time point maximum inhibition of the receptor protein expression occurs. The siRNA transfection efficiency was also assayed using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled luciferase GL2 duplex (Dharmacon). It was experimentally established that maximal, i.e. >90%, inhibition of α7 expression occurred 48 h after transfection (data not shown) at which point the cells were used in exposure experiments. The same generic protocol of keratinocyte transfection was used to express MEK1 kinase mutants. Total RNA was extracted from KCs at the end of exposure experiments with the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and used in the qPCR assay of α2-integrin gene expression as detailed elsewhere (17Arredondo J. Chernyavsky A.I. Marubio L.M. Beaudet A.L. Jolkovsky D.L. Pinkerton K.E. Grando S.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2005; 166: 597-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The qPCR primers were designed with the assistance of the Primer Express software version 2.0 computer program (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and the service Assays-on-Demand provided by Applied Biosystems. The qPCRs were performed using an ABI Prism 7500 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) and the TaqMan Universal Master Mix reagent (Applied Biosystems) in accordance with the manufacturer舗s protocol as described by us in detail elsewhere (33Arredondo J. Chernyavsky A.I. Jolkovsky D.L. Webber R.J. Grando S.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 208: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To correct for minor variations in mRNA extraction and reverse transcription, the gene expression values were normalized using the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The data from triplicate samples were analyzed with sequence detector software (Applied Biosystems) and expressed as mean ± S.D. of α2-integrin mRNA relative to that of control. The in-cell Western assay was performed as described by us in detail elsewhere (34Arredondo J. Chernyavsky A.I. Webber R.J. Grando S.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2005; 125: 1236-1241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) using the reagents and equipment from LI-COR Biotechnology (Lincoln, NE). After exposure of 3 × 104 KCs/well of a 96-well plate to test agents, the experimental and control cells were fixed in situ, washed, permeabilized with Triton solution, incubated with the LI-COR Odyssey Blocking Buffer for 1.5 h, and then treated overnight at 4 °C with a primary rabbit polyclonal antibody to α2-integrin (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA). After that, the cells were washed and stained for 1 h at room temperature with a secondary LI-COR IRDye 800CW goat anti-rabbit or IRDye 800CW antibody diluted 1:800. Sapphire700 (1:1000) was used to normalize for cell number/well. The protein expression was quantitated using the LI-COR Odyssey Imaging System. All experiments were performed in triplicates, and the results were expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical significance was determined using Student舗s t test. Differences were deemed significant if the calculated p value was <0.05. We have demonstrated previously that activation of α7 nAChR up-regulates expression of α2-integrin in human epidermal keratinocytes and that the downstream signaling involves the Ras/Raf-1/MEK1/ERK1/2 cascade (8Chernyavsky A.I. Arredondo J. Karlsson E. Wessler I. Grando S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39220-39228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To elucidate the relative contribution of the ionic events elicited by influxes of Na+ and Ca2+ through the ACh-gated homomeric ion channel comprising α7 subunits, we measured by qPCR and in-cell Western assay the changes in expression of the α2-integrin gene at the mRNA and protein levels, respectively, in KCs stimulated with the α7 nAChR agonist AR-R17779 in the absence of extracellular Na+ or Ca2+. Under normal culture conditions, AR-R17779 produced multifold increases in the α2-integrin mRNA and protein that could be abolished in the presence of the α7 antagonist MLA as well as due to transfection with siRNA-α7 (Fig. 1), thus confirming the specificity of the observed effect to α7 nAChR activation. Although elimination of Na+ only slightly diminished the AR-R17779 effect (p > 0.05), the AR-R17779-dependent up-regulation of α2-integrin in Ca2+-free medium was inhibited by >50% at three different AR-R17779 concentrations, i.e. 25, 50, and 100 μm (Fig. 1C), suggesting that α7 nAChR-mediated Ca2+ influx, rather then cell membrane depolarization, contributes to the signaling cascade leading to up-regulation of the α2-integrin gene expression. This conjecture was supported by a partial decrease of the AR-R17779-dependent up-regulation of α2-integrin expression due to inhibition of Ca2+ influx through nAChR by Cd2+ or Zn2+ (35Nutter T.J. Adams D.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 701-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 36Palma E. Maggi L. Miledi R. Eusebi F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 10246-10250Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Both in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ and in the presence of Cd2+ or Zn2+, the AR-R17779-dependent elevation of α2-integrin mRNA and protein was completely blocked by inhibiting MEK1 activity (Fig. 1), indicating that MEK signaling downstream from α7 nAChR can be elicited independently from ion influx. The α7 nAChR pathway coupled to up-regulation of α2-integrin also involved PKC whose inhibition with chelerythrine produced a reciprocal decrease of the AR-R17779-induced up-regulation of the α2-integrin gene expression. This putative signaling pathway apparently did not involve Jak2 and PI3K because their inhibition with AG-490 and Ly-294002, respectively, did not alter the AR-R17779-dependent elevation of α2-integrin mRNA and protein (Fig. 1). These results demonstrated the existence of the two-component signaling system mediating up-regulation of the α2-integrin gene expression upon stimulation of α7 nAChR with an agonist. AR-R17779 produced a dose-dependent increase of ERK1/2 activity, which could be inhibited by MLA and siRNA-α7 (Fig. 2), thus substantiating the notion that downstream signaling from α7 nAChR that up-regulates the α2-integring gene expression involves the MEK1/ERK1/2 step. Both elimination of the extracellular Ca2+ and inhibition of its nAChR permeation through nAChR by Cd2+ and Zn2+ partially decreased the AR-R17779-dependent ERK activation, whereas elimination of extracellular Na+ had no effect. Transfection of KCs with CA-MEK eliminated the inhibitory effects of Ca2+ deprivation on both ERK activity (Fig. 2) and α2-integrin gene expression (Fig. 1). Combining the depravation of extracellular Ca2+ with inhibition of MEK in all cases totally blocked AR-R17779-dependent ERK activation. In Ca2+-free medium, Ras and Raf inhibitors also totally abolished the AR-R17779 effect, demonstrating that α7 signaling was initiated due to both Ca2+ influx and activation of Ras/Raf independently from Ca2+ influx. To further identify effectors of the nAChR-coupled signaling pathways upstream of the MEK1/ERK1/2 step, we measured the effects of Jak2, PI3K, and PKC inhibitors on the AR-R17779-dependent ERK activation. Only the PKC inhibitor chelerythrine significantly (p < 0.05) decreased ERK activity (Fig. 2), indicating that PKC is involved upstream of the MEK1/ERK1/2 step. To distinguish between the ionic and protein kinase-mediated mechanisms of PKC engagement in the α7 nAChR signaling up-regulating the α2-integrin gene expression, we measured PKC activity in KCs deprived of extracellular Ca2+ or exposed to kinase inhibitors. The specificity of PKC activation due to agonistic stimulation of α7 nAChR was demonstrated by inhibiting the AR-R17779 effect by MLA and due to transfection with siRNA-α7 but not siRNA-NC (Fig. 3). The AR-R17779-dependent activation of PKC was completely inhibited due to elimination of Ca2+ from the culture medium, blocking the nAChR permeability to Ca2+ with Cd2+ or Zn2+, and treatment with the CaMKII inhibitor KN-62 (Fig. 3). The Ras inhibitor manumycin A produced no significant effect (p > 0.05). These results demonstrated that PKC engagement downstream of α7 nAChR activation occurs predominantly due to Ca2+ influx and proceeds along the pathway involving CaMKII. Because ROK is believed to play a central role in coordinating the cholinergic control of keratinocyte migration through regulation of the integrin gene expression and cytoskeleton rearrangements (5Grando S.A. Pittelkow M.R. Schallreuter K.U. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2006; 126: 1948-1965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), we next determined whether and how the downstream signaling from α7 nAChR engages ROK. Activation of α7 nAChR with AR-R17779 produced a concentration-dependent increase of the ROK activity that could be inhibited by MLA and transfection with siRNA-α7 (Fig. 4). The AR-R17779-induced ROK activation depended upon Ca2+ (Fig. 4B) but not Na+ entry. An inhibitor of PI3K completely decreased the AR-R17779-dependent ROK activation; the CaMKII and Jak2 inhibitors decreased it only partially as it remained significantly elevated (p < 0.05), whereas a PKC inhibitor produced no significant effect (p > 0.05) (Fig. 4"
https://openalex.org/W2094942306,"Raf Kinase Inhibitory Protein (RKIP, also PEBP1), a member of the Phosphatidylethanolamine Binding Protein family, negatively regulates growth factor signaling by the Raf/MAP kinase pathway. Since an organic compound, locostatin, was reported to bind RKIP and inhibit cell migration by a Raf-dependent mechanism, we addressed the role of RKIP in locostatin function.We analyzed locostatin interaction with RKIP and examined the biological consequences of locostatin binding on RKIP function. NMR studies show that a locostatin precursor binds to the conserved phosphatidylethanolamine binding pocket of RKIP. However, drug binding to the pocket does not prevent RKIP association with its inhibitory target, Raf-1, nor affect RKIP phosphorylation by Protein Kinase C at a regulatory site. Similarly, exposure of wild type, RKIP-depleted HeLa cells or RKIP-deficient (RKIP(-/-)) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to locostatin has no effect on MAP kinase activation. Locostatin treatment of wild type MEFs causes inhibition of cell migration following wounding. RKIP deficiency impairs migration further, indicating that RKIP protects cells against locostatin-mediated inhibition of migration. Locostatin treatment of depleted or RKIP(-/-) MEFs reveals cytoskeletal disruption and microtubule abnormalities in the spindle.These results suggest that locostatin's effects on cytoskeletal structure and migration are caused through mechanisms independent of its binding to RKIP and Raf/MAP kinase signaling. The protective effect of RKIP against drug inhibition of migration suggests a new role for RKIP in potentially sequestering toxic compounds that may have deleterious effects on cells."
https://openalex.org/W2171191061,"Progesterone receptor (PR) belongs to the nuclear receptor family of ligand-dependent transcription factors and mediates the major biological effects of progesterone. Transcriptional co-activators that are recruited by PR through the carboxyl-terminal ligand binding domain have been studied extensively. Much less is known about co-activators that interact with other regions of receptors. Jun dimerization protein 2 (JDP2) is a PR co-activator that enhances the transcriptional activity of the amino-terminal domain by increasing the alpha-helical content and stability of the intrinsically disordered amino-terminal domain. To gain insights into the mechanism of JDP2 co-activation of PR, the structural basis of JDP2-PR interaction was analyzed using NMR. The smallest regions of each protein needed for efficient protein interaction were used for NMR and included the basic region plus leucine zipper (bZIP) domain of JDP2 and the core zinc modules of the PR DNA binding domain plus the intrinsically disordered carboxyl-terminal extension (CTE) of the DNA binding domain. Chemical shift changes in PR upon titration with JDP2 revealed that most of the residues involved in binding of JDP2 reside within the CTE. The importance of the CTE for binding JDP2 was confirmed by peptide competition and mutational analyses. Point mutations within CTE sites identified by NMR and a CTE domain swapping experiment also confirmed the functional importance of JDP2 interaction with the CTE for enhancement of PR transcriptional activity. These studies provide insights into the role and functional importance of the CTE for co-activator interactions."

Ran-GDP also interacts with importin-β, but this interaction is 4 orders of magnitude weaker than the Ran-GTP·importin-β interaction. Here we use the yeast complement of nuclear import proteins to show that the interaction between Ran-GDP and importin-β promotes the dissociation of GDP from Ran. The release of GDP from the Ran-GDP-importin-β complex stabilizes the complex, which cannot be dissociated by importin-α. Although Ran has a higher affinity for GDP compared with GTP, Ran in complex with importin-β has a higher affinity for GTP. This feature is responsible for the generation of Ran-GTP from Ran-GDP by importin-β. Ran-binding protein-1 (RanBP1) activates this reaction by forming a trimeric complex with Ran-GDP and importin-β. Importin-α inhibits the GDP exchange reaction by sequestering importin-β, whereas RanBP1 restores the GDP nucleotide exchange by importin-β by forming a tetrameric complex with importin-β, Ran, and importin-α. The exchange is also inhibited by nuclear-transport factor-2 (NTF2). We suggest a mechanism for nuclear import, additional to the established RCC1 (Ran-guanine exchange factor)-dependent pathway that incorporates these results.

The exchange is also inhibited by nuclear-transport factor-2 (NTF2). We suggest a mechanism for nuclear import, additional to the established RCC1 (Ran-guanine exchange factor)-dependent pathway that incorporates these results. Ran (Gsp1p in yeast) is a Ras-like GTPase that regulates diverse cellular processes, including nuclear transport, mitotic spindle assembly, and post-mitotic nuclear assembly (1Dasso M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R502-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 2Joseph J. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3481-3484Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Like other GTPases, Ran can bind GTP and GDP. Ran-GTP is generated in the nucleus by the guanine exchange factor RCC1 (regulator of chromosome condensation 1), which is associated with the chromatin (3Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Nature. 1991; 354: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Ran-GDP is produced in the cytoplasm by the activation of the intrinsic GTPase activity of Ran by RanGAP1 (GTPase-activating protein) (4Bischoff F.R. Klebe C. Kretschmer J. Wittinghofer A. Ponstingl H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) and RanBP1 (Ran-binding protein-1, Yrb1p in yeast). The compartmentalization of RanGAP1 (cytoplasm) and RCC1 (nucleus) gives rise to the asymmetric distribution of Ran-GDP (cytoplasm) and Ran-GTP (nucleus) across the nuclear envelope. This asymmetric distribution of Ran-GDP and Ran-GTP plays a central role in nucleocytoplasmic transport by mediating assembly and disassembly of import and export complexes through interaction with the nuclear import machinery (for reviews, see Refs. 5Melchior F. Gerace L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 6Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Nucleocytoplasmic transport is driven by a series of protein-protein interactions and involves several soluble carriers named β-karyopherins. Import carriers are called importins and export carriers are called exportins. The classical nuclear import pathway involves importin-β (Kap95p in yeast) and the adaptor protein importin-α (Kap60p in yeast). In the cytoplasm importin-β binds to importin-α. Their interaction triggers a conformational change of importin-α that increases its affinity for cargo proteins containing a nuclear localization signal (NLS) (11Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 12Kobe B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The translocation of the resulting complex (importin-β·importin-α·NLS) involves interactions with the NPC proteins (nucleoporins), particularly the FXFG-repeat domains (11Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). The protein cargo is released in the nucleus by the action of Ran-GTP, which induces the dissociation of importin-α from importin-β by forming a stable complex with importin-β. The importins are then recycled to the cytoplasm. Importin-β transfers to the cytoplasm associated with Ran-GTP, and importin-α is exported by CAS (exportin2; Cse1p in yeast) in the form of an importin-α·CAS·Ran-GTP complex (13Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Kostka S. Kraft R. Görlich D. Cell. 1997; 90: 1061-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Importin-β and importin-α are released from their complexes in the cytoplasm by the combined action of RanBP1 and RanGAP1. Importin-β and importin-α are then able to function in a new cycle of transport, whereas Ran-GDP is transported into the nucleus by NTF2 (nuclear-transport factor-2, Ntf2p in yeast) (14Ribbeck K. Lipowsky G. Kent H.M. Stewart M. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6587-6598Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). In the nucleus Ran-GDP is transformed to Ran-GTP by the action of RCC1 (3Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H.

The complexity of the nuclear import mechanism is highlighted by the fact that it involves the active participation of soluble factors other than Ran-GTP, importin-β, and importin-α. Indeed, Ran-GDP, RanBP1, and NTF2 have been shown to be involved in the docking and translocation events of nuclear import. Chi et al. (15Chi N.C. Adam E.J. Visser G.D. Adam S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 559-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that Ran-GDP forms a stable complex with RanBP1 and importin-β; they suggested a role for Ran-GDP in the association of the importin-β·importin-α·NLS complex with the nuclear pore and speculated that the importin-β·importin-α·NLS·Ran-GDP·RanBP1 pentameric complex was the actual translocation complex that moved through the pore. This model has also been adopted by others (16Delphin C. Guan T. Melchior F. Gerace L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2379-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 17Melchior F. Gerace L.

The role of NTF2 as the factor responsible for the translocation of the transport complex through the nuclear envelope has also been proposed by Paschal et al. (19Paschal B.M. Delphin C. Gerace L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 7679-7683Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The role of Ran-GDP and RanBP1 in nuclear import has been demonstrated by a single mutation of a cysteine residue of importin-β; the mutation was required for binding Ran-GDP·RanBP1, but not Ran-GTP·RanBP1, and inhibited the nuclear import in permeabilized cells (20Chi N.C. Adam E.J. Adam S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6818-6822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The active role of RanBP1 in nuclear import has been further demonstrated by Künzler et al. (21Künzler M. Trueheart J. Sette C. Hurt E. Thorner J. Genetics. 2001; 157: 1089-1105PubMed Google Scholar), who showed that mutations in the Yrb1 gene encoding the yeast ortholog of RanBP1 impair nucleocytoplasmic transport. Despite considerable evidence for the involvement of Ran-GDP, RanBP1, and NTF2 in nuclear protein import, the precise mechanism by which these molecules regulate this process has been unknown. Here we characterize the interaction between Kap95p and Gsp1p-GDP. We show that this interaction results in GDP-to-GTP exchange on Gsp1p. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Gsp1p, Kap60p, Kap95p, Yrb1p, and Ntf2p interact to regulate the GDP-to-GTP exchange on Gsp1p. We suggest a mechanism of nuclear import additional to the RCC1-dependent pathway that incorporates our observations. For clarity, the nomenclature of nuclear transport factors in human and yeast relevant to the work here is presented in Table 1. Plasmids expressing Kap95p (importin-β) and Kap60p (importin-α) as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins have been described previously (19Paschal B.M. Delphin C. Gerace L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 7679-7683Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Gsp1p (Ran), Yrb1p (RanBP1), and Ntf2p (NTF2) genes were amplified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA and cloned as glutathione S-transferase-tagged recombinant genes using the following forward and reverse primers (restriction sites are in bold, and the start codon is in italics): Gsp1p (GenBankTM accession number AY558363), 5′-CCGGATCCATGTCAGCACCTGCTCAAAACAATG-3′ and 5′-CCGAATTCTTATAAATCAGCATCGTCTTCATCAGGTAATG-3′; Yrb1p (GenBankTM accession number AY693117), 5′-CCGAATTCCTATGTCTAGCGAAGATAAGAAACCTGTCGTC-3′ and 5′-GGCTCGAGCTAAGCCTTTTTGTTGATTTCTTGAGCTTT-3′; Ntf2p (GenBankTM accession number AY558448) 5′-CCGAATTCCTATGTCTCTCGACTTTAACACTTTGGC-3′ and 5′-GGCTCGAGTTAAGCAGAGTAATTCAAACGGAAGATATC-3′. The Gsp1p PCR product was cleaved by BamHI and EcoRI and ligated into PGEX-KG (Novagen), which was cleaved with BamHI and EcoRI. The Yrb1p and Ntf2p PCR products were cleaved by EcoRI and XhoI and ligated into PGEX-KG (Novagen), which was cleaved with EcoRI and XhoI.TABLE 1Nomenclature of soluble transport factors involved in nuclear import with their corresponding NCBI numbers in human and yeastHumanYeastRan (NP_006316)Gsp1p (NP_013396)Importin-β (NP_002256)Kap95p (NP_013451)Importin-α (NP_002255)Kap60p (NP_014210)RanBP1 (NP_002873)Yrb1p (NP_010285)NTF2 (NP_005787)Ntf2p (NP_010925) Open table in a new tab All constructs were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. The plasmids were introduced into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen) carrying the plasmid pGTf2 (Takara Bio Inc.) coding for a set of chaperones (GroES-GroEL-tig). Cells were grown in 2 liters of terrific broth (TB) medium containing 200 μg/ml ampicillin and 35 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 37 °C to a cell density of 1–2 A600 (absorption at 600 nm) units. Cells were cooled down on ice, and 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 10 μg/ml tetracycline were added to induce expression of recombinant proteins and chaperones, respectively. After incubation (160 rpm) for 16–20 h at 18 °C, cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellets were frozen at −20 °C. All purification steps were carried out at 5 °C. The pellets were thawed and resuspended in 50 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1× FastBreak Cell Lysis (Promega), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 units of DNase. The homogenates were spun down at 25,000 × g for 1 h, and the cleared supernatants were subjected to glutathione affinity chromatography (glutathione-agarose; Scientifix). Fusion tags were cleaved using thrombin and separated by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex S200; GE Healthcare). Fractions containing the purified recombinant protein were passed once more through glutathione-Sepharose beads to remove residual traces of glutathione S-transferase and uncleaved protein. Purified proteins were equilibrated with 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl and concentrated in Amicon Ultra 10k (Millipore). Aliquots of purified proteins were snap-frozen and kept at −80 °C. For production of Ran-GDP and Gsp1p-GDP, purified proteins were incubated with a 50-fold excess of GDP and 5 mm EDTA for 40 min at 25 °C followed by the addition of 10 mm Mg2+. Proteins were then equilibrated with 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, concentrated, and snap-frozen at −80 °C. All such assays were performed in a total volume of 50 μl. For Gsp1p-[3H]GDP or Gsp1p-[3H]GTP exchange assays, Gsp1p-GDP (5 or 8 μm) was incubated for 40 min at 25 °C with 16 μm [3H]GDP (12.1 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) or on ice with 39 μm [3H]GTP (5.1 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) in the incubating buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% bovine serum albumin) in a total volume of 4.5 μl. Loading reactions were stopped by adding 0.5 μl of 100 mm MgCl2. [3H]GDP and [3H]GTP-loaded Gsp1p (5 μl) was then preincubated for 15 min at 25 °C with 45 μl of the reaction mixture. Reaction mixtures contained Kap95p, Yrb1p, Kap60p or Ntf2p, and MgCl2 (or EDTA) in the incubating buffer. Exchange reactions were started by the addition of 2 μl of 100 mm GDP or GTP. At various time points, 8-μl aliquots were filtered through BA85 nitrocellulose and washed with the rinsing buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2). The protein-bound radioactivity retained on the filter was measured by scintillation counting and expressed as cpm units. For Gsp1p-GDP loading assays, 5 μl of Gsp1p-GDP (5 or 8 μm) was preincubated for 15 min at 25 °C with 45 μl of the incubating buffer containing Kap95p, Yrb1p, Kap60p, or Ntf2p, and MgCl2 (or EDTA). Loading reactions were started by the addition of 2 μl of the nucleotide mixture (GDP, [3H]GDP, GTP, or [3H]GTP). At various time points protein-bound radioactivity contained in 8-μl aliquots was measured as mentioned above. Recombinant human Ran (1.5 mg (22Forwood J.K. Lonhienne T.G. Marfori M. Robin G. Meng W. Guncar G. Liu S.M. Stewart M. Carroll B.J. Kobe B. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 383: 772-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)) was incubated at 25 °C for 40 min in the running buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl) supplemented with 5 mm EDTA, 0.89 μm [3H]GDP, and 1 mm GDP in a total volume of 1 ml. The loading reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 1 m MgCl2. The sample was applied to a Superdex S200 column, and gel filtration was performed in the running buffer. Fractions corresponding to purified Ran-[3H]GDP were pooled and concentrated to 0.5 ml. Purified Ran-[3H]GDP was then incubated with 4.2 mg of Kap95p in the running buffer for 30 min at 25 °C in a total volume of 1 ml. The sample was applied to a Superdex S200 column. Fractions corresponding to protein peaks were analyzed for their protein content by SDS-PAGE. The radioactivity corresponding to [3H]GDP contained in the fractions was measured by scintillation counting. The nucleotide-bound state of human Ran and its complex with Kap95p was assessed using isocratic HPLC. In each experiment 0.86 nmol of Ran protein was loaded onto a C18 reverse-phase column (Jupiter, Phenomenex) under ion-pair conditions in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10 mm tetrabutylammonium bromide, and 4% (v/v) acetonitrile. The stoichiometry of nucleotide bound was assessed using GDP and GTP nucleotide standards. To investigate the functional consequences of the Ran-GDP·Kap95p interaction (22Forwood J.K. Lonhienne T.G. Marfori M. Robin G. Meng W. Guncar G. Liu S.M. Stewart M. Carroll B.J. Kobe B. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 383: 772-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of Kap95p on the binding of guanine nucleotides to Gsp1p. First, we examined the effect of Kap95p on the Gsp1p-GDP dissociation by monitoring the loss of Gsp1p-bound [3H]GDP in solution binding assays containing Gsp1p-[3H]GDP and excess Kap95p and GDP (Fig. 1A). In the binding buffer alone containing 1 mm Mg2+, Gsp1p-[3H]GDP was stable over 60 min, whereas it was strongly destabilized in the presence of EDTA, consistent with previous observations (3Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Nature. 1991; 354: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 23Klebe C. Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In 1 mm Mg2+, Kap95p promoted Gsp1p-[3H]GDP dissociation. Because the nucleotide binding of Ran depends on Mg2+ (24Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 10830-10834Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), we examined its effect on the GDP exchange activity of Kap95p. As expected, the release of [3H]GDP from Gsp1p by Kap95p was inhibited by increasing concentrations of Mg2+ (Fig. 1A). We next examined the effect of Kap95p on the loading of nucleotides on Gsp1p by incubating Gsp1p-GDP with equal amounts of [3H]GTP and GDP (Fig. 1B). In the absence of Kap95p in the binding buffer containing 1 mm Mg2+, as expected, no loading of [3H]GTP was observed. Kap95p, when compared with EDTA, caused high [3H]GTP loading on Gsp1p in the presence of 1 mm Mg2+. Ran has a 10-fold higher affinity for GDP compared with GTP (23Klebe C. Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar); therefore, this result suggested that upon formation of the Kap95p·Gsp1p complex, Gsp1p adopted a conformational state that favored the binding of GTP over GDP. Jointly, the results demonstrate that Kap95p promotes the conversion of Gsp1p-GDP to Gsp1p-GTP in vitro. Additional experiments demonstrated that Kap95 also induced the nucleotide exchange of human Ran with equal effectiveness (data not shown), consistent with the high degree of conservation between the human and yeast nuclear import pathways (6Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar). During the GDP nucleotide exchange occurring on the Ran·Gsp1p·Kap95p complex, Ran·Gsp1p must pass through an intermediate free of nucleotide. We analyzed the stability of the nucleotide-free human Ran·Kap95p complex (Fig. 2A). Kap95p was incubated with an excess of Ran preloaded with [3H]GDP, and the sample was resolved by gel filtration. Two protein peaks were observed, one corresponding to a 1:1 complex between Ran and Kap95p and another one corresponding to free Ran. The radioactivity profile showed two peaks, one overlapping the free Ran protein peak the other one corresponding to free GDP. The integration of the radioactivity found in the two peaks corresponded to the initial activity associated with Ran-[3H]GDP before the addition to Kap95p. No radioactivity was detected in the protein peak containing the Ran·Kap95p complex, demonstrating that the addition of Kap95p to Ran-[3H]GDP generated a stable 1:1 complex between Kap95p and nucleotide-free Ran. To confirm the nucleotide free status of the Ran·Kap95p complex, we conducted a similar experiment with Ran preloaded with GDP instead of [3H]GDP. We analyzed the two resultant protein peaks by reverse-phase HPLC (Fig. 2B). The HPLC data confirmed that Ran was associated with GDP in a 1:1 stoichiometry and that GDP was excluded from the Ran·Kap95 complex. To further investigate the stability of the Ran·Kap95p complex, we examined the ability of Kap60p to dissociate the complex (Fig. 3). Excess of Kap60p protein was added to Ran·Kap95p complex in the binding buffer alone or in the presence of excess of Mg2+ and GDP. Kap60p was unable to dissociate the Ran·Kap95p complex in buffer alone, implying that under these conditions the affinity between nucleotide-free Ran and Kap95p was higher than between Kap60p and Kap95p (3 × 10−8m−1 for importin-α·importin-β (25Catimel B. Teh T. Fontes M.R. Jennings I.G. Jans D.A. Howlett G.J. Nice E.C. Kobe B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34189-34198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar)). However, the addition of excess of Mg2+ and GDP allowed Kap60p to dissociate the Ran·Kap95p complex, suggesting that GDP and Mg2+ destabilized the Ran·Kap95p interaction. Together, these results demonstrated that upon binding with Ran-GDP, Kap95p is able to release the nucleotide and thereby increase the affinity between Kap95p and nucleotide-free Ran such that they cannot be dissociated by Kap60p. Ran-GDP has the ability to form a trimeric complex with RanBP1 and importin-β (15Chi N.C. Adam E.J. Visser G.D. Adam S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 559-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It was, therefore, of interest to assess the GDP exchange activity of Gsp1p-GDP in the presence of Yrb1p and Kap95p. Yrb1p promoted Kap95p-mediated dissociation of Gsp1p-[3H]GDP, whereas in the absence of Kap95p, no dissociation was observed with or without Yrb1p (Fig. 4A). We then carried out nucleotide loading assays on Gsp1p in complex with Kap95p and/or Yrb1p and with equal amounts of [3H]GTP and GDP (Fig. 4B). In the presence of Kap95p, Yrb1p significantly promoted the [3H]GTP loading on Gsp1p, exceeding [3H]GTP loading when only Gsp1p-GDP and Kap95p were present. The data showed that virtually 100% of Gsp1p of the Gsp1p-GDP·Yrb1p·Kap95p complex was loaded with [3H]GTP upon GDP nucleotide exchange. Consistent with the data shown above (Fig. 4A), Yrb1p had no effect on the loading of [3H]GTP on Gsp1p in the absence of Kap95p. These results established that the formation of the Gsp1p-GDP·Yrb1p·Kap95p complex induced the release of GDP from Gsp1p and promoted the selective binding of GTP. In the presence of 2 mm Mg2+, the release of [3H]GDP from Gsp1p by Kap95p was strongly inhibited by Kap60p (Fig. 5A). However, the addition of Yrb1p counteracted this inhibition, nearly restoring the rate of dissociation of Gsp1p-GDP obtained in presence of Kap95p alone. We carried out nucleotide loading assays on Gsp1p in the Gsp1p·Yrb1p·Kap95p·Kap60p complex upon GDP release. In loading assays with 1.6 μm [3H]GTP and GDP, the amount of Gsp1p loaded with [3H]GTP in the presence of Kap95p, Kap60p, and Yrb1p (Fig. 5B) was small compared with the amount that underwent GDP dissociation (Fig. 5A). Indeed, after 1 h of incubation, ∼95% of Gsp1p-[3H]GDP dissociated in the presence of Kap95p, Ybp1p, and Kap60p, whereas under the same conditions only 10% of Gsp1p was loaded with [3H]GTP. This provided evidence that Gsp1p-GDP, Kap95p, Kap60p, and Yrb1p formed a tetrameric complex and that the conformation taken by Gsp1p in this complex favored the binding of GDP over GTP at equimolar concentrations of 1.6 μm. For technical reasons it was not possible to study the loading of [3H]GTP at physiological concentrations (1.6 μm GDP, 470 μm GTP (26Riddick G. Macara I.G. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 1027-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar)). We, therefore, instead monitored the loading of [3H]GDP in the presence of a gradient of GTP concentration reaching 470 μm at its maximum (Fig. 5C). The results showed that in the presence of 1.6 μm [3H]GDP and 470 μm GTP, the loading of [3H]GDP was totally inhibited, indicating that Gsp1p was fully loaded with GTP. These results indicated that at physiological concentrations of nucleotides, generation of Gsp1p-GTP from Gsp1p-GDP occurred when Gsp1p was associated with Kap95p, Kap60p, and Yrb1p in a tetrameric complex. We next investigated the status of Kap60p upon loading of Gsp1p with GTP in the Gsp1p·Yrb1p·Kap95p·Kap60p complex. We monitored the effect of Kap60p on the dissociation of Gsp1p-[3H]GTP in the presence of Yrb1p and Kap95p. The absence of Gsp1p-[3H]GTP dissociation in the presence of Kap95p and Yrb1p (Fig. 5D) confirmed our previous results establishing that the conformation of Gsp1p in the Gsp1p·Yrb1p·Kap95p complex favors the selective binding of GTP over GDP (Fig. 3). Only a slight release of [3H]GTP from Gsp1p was observed when Kap60p was added to Yrb1p and Kap95p. This result clearly indicated that Kap60p did not form a stable complex with Gsp1p-[3H]GTP, Kap95p, and Yrb1p. NTF2 is a transport factor that imports Ran-GDP to the nucleus (14Ribbeck K. Lipowsky G. Kent H.M. Stewart M. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6587-6598Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). NTF2 is an inhibitor of Ran-GDP dissociation (27Yamada M. Tachibana T. Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1339-1342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it is involved in the formation of a pentameric complex with Gsp1p-GDP, Kap60p, Kap95p, and Nup36p, a nucleoporin containing an RBH domain (28Nehrbass U. Blobel G. Science. 1996; 272: 120-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We, therefore, investigated the effect of Ntf2p on the GDP nucleotide exchange by Kap95p in presence of Kap60p and Yrb1p. We found that Ntf2p partially inhibited both GDP dissociation and GTP loading on Gsp1p (Fig. 6). The RCC1-dependent nuclear import pathway is the accepted mechanism for nucleocytoplasmic movement of cargo by importin-β and importin-α (2Joseph J. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3481-3484Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 9Stewart M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 195-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 29Madrid A.S. Weis K.

Here, we describe in vitro interactions between the yeast counterparts of these proteins, Kap95p, Kap60p, Gsp1p, Yrb1p, and Ntf2p, and the results suggest the possibility that in addition to the RCC1-dependent pathway, nuclear import could also be facilitated in at least some circumstances by Kap95p (importin-β)-mediated nucleotide exchange.

https://openalex.org/W2062250649,"Activation of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) in response to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) leads to pathophysiology of cells/tissues by overmodulation of gene transcription. PRDX6 plays a rheostat role in regulating gene transcription by controlling cellular ROS in maintaining homeostasis; thus, fine tuning of Prdx6 expression is required to optimize ROS levels. Using Prdx6- and Smad3-depleted cells, we show that Prdx6−/− cells bear active NF-κB and Smad3, and repression of Prdx6 transcription in redox-active cells (Prdx6−/−) is due to ROS-induced dominant Smad3-mediated TGFβ signaling. The Prdx6 promoter (−1139 bp) containing repressive Smad3-binding elements and NF-κB sites showed reduced promoter activity in Prdx6−/− cells, and the activity was restored in Smad3−/− cells. Mutation of repressive Smad3-binding elements eliminated the repression of the Prdx6 promoter. Revival of promoter activity by application of TGFβ1 antibody to Prdx6−/− and Smad3−/− cells with increased Prdx6 mRNA and protein conferred resistance to TGFβ- and H2O2-induced insult, demonstrating that repression of Prdx6 transcription is Smad3-dependent. Promoter activity in Smad3−/− or Prdx6−/− cells was moderately increased by disruption of NF-κB sites, suggesting the role of NF-κB in tuning of Prdx6 expression. Findings revealed a mechanism of repression and regulation of PRDX6 expression in cells facing stress or aging and provided clues for antioxidant(s)-based new approaches in preventing ROS-driven deleterious signaling.

Accumulating evidence indicates that expression levels of PRDX6 contribute to pathophysiology of cells and tissues. Several studies have reported decreases in antioxidant levels and increases in ROS levels, leading to a decline in a number of physiological functions because of overmodulation of ROS-mediated gene expression and activation of such factors as TGFβ and NF-κB, hallmarks of the aging process and age-associated degenerative diseases (28Higuchi M. Shirotani K. Higashi N. Toyoshima S. Osawa T. J. Immunother. 1992; 12: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 29Stadtman E.R.

However, given the role of ROS as a mediator of normal or redox signaling, we believe that optimal regulation of Prdx6 expression may require fine tuning to avoid overshooting the desired beneficial effects to the point of perturbing the delicate redox balance essential to maintenance of normal cellular function. Recently, using targeted inactivation of the Prdx6 gene, we reported activation and expression of TGFβ and TGFβ-mediated suppression of Prdx6 mRNA and protein (1Fatma N. Kubo E. Sharma P. Beier D.R. Singh D.P. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 734-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 4Kubo E. Fatma N. Akagi Y. Beier D.R. Singh S.P. Singh D.P. Am. J. Physiol.

Quantification by staining with H2DCF-DA established a higher prevalence of ROS in these cells. Also, the activation of TGFβ in Prdx6-deficient cells was associated with ROS and inhibited by PRDX6 overexpression or MnTBAP, a superoxide dismutase mimetic and a known ROS inhibitor, in view of our earlier finding(s) that Prdx6-depleted cells bear higher levels of ROS and are thereby more susceptible to oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death (1Fatma N.

TGFβ, a multipotent growth factor, is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, migration, and extracellular matrix formation (32Kurisaki A.

Activation of TGFβ has also been implicated in multiple fibrotic diseases, including those of the eye, such as glaucoma and anterior subcapsular cataract (35de Iongh R.U. Wederell E. Lovicu F.J.

Optom. 2002; 85: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Moreover, several mechanisms of TGFβ activation are known (39Koli K. Saharinen J. Hyytiäinen M. Penttinen C. Keski-Oja J. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2001; 52: 354-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), and a diverse group of activators, including trauma, proteases, TSP-1, integrin, low pH, and ROS, can activate TGFβ1 (20Annes J.P. Munger J.S. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar, 40Barcellos-Hoff M.H. Derynck R. Tsang M.L. Weatherbee J.A. J. Clin.

Using targeted inactivation of the Prdx6 gene, we have also shown that ROS levels are elevated in Prdx6−/− cells, and this is a cause of TGFβ activation. TGFβ initiates its signaling by interaction with the TGFβ type II receptor that proceeds to phosphorylation of type I, forming an activated complex and leading to the activation of TGFβRI kinase activity (42Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2108) Google Scholar), which transmits the signal into cells through Smads-mediated or alternative signaling pathways (43Shi Y. Massagué J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4795) Google Scholar). Growing evidence suggests that the TGFβ-mediated activation of Smads regulates downstream signaling by modulating the transcriptional activity, either by functional cooperation with transcriptional proteins, direct binding to DNA, or direct interaction with DNA-bound transcription factors (18Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M. Nature. 1996; 383: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 44Zhou S. Zawel L. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 121-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The ability of TGFβ to induce or suppress the expression of several genes, including PAI-1, clusterin, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (JE/MCP-1), and type I collagen, depends on specific DNA-binding sites in the promoter regions of these genes (45Chen C.R.

Although the molecular mechanism of TGFβ-induced activation of the gene promoter has been established, less is known about the way in which TGFβ signaling exerts its effect in repression of gene transcription. Earlier studies have documented that TGFβ plays a regulatory role in the modulation of the transcription of various genes via TGFβ-inhibitory elements (TIEs; nnnTTGGnnn) (49Hirschi K.K. Lai L.

(50Kerr L.D. Miller D.B. Matrisian L.M. Cell. 1990; 61: 267-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) have shown that a 10-base pair element in the transin promoter is required for the TGFβ1-inhibitory effects. Recently, Frederick et al. (47Frederick J.P. Liberati N.T. Waddell D.S. Shi Y. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2546-2559Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) discovered a potential consensus repressive Smad3-binding element (RSBE) in the c-myc promoter sequence overlapping the c-myc TIE (5′-TTGGCGGGAA-3′), a site that is notably different from a consensus Smad-binding element (SBE; 5′-GTCT-3′) and responsible for binding of Smad3 and repression of the c-myc gene. Moreover, NF-κB, a redox-active transcriptional protein, is a ubiquitous, multisubunit transcription factor whose activation plays an important role in regulation of genes that function in inflammation, cell proliferation, cell survival, and apoptosis (53Hoffmann A. Leung T.H. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5530-5539Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Such factors are considered to be key regulators of cellular stress response. NF-κB is induced and activated by different stimuli and conditions, such as pathology, oxidative stress, hypoxia, inflammatory mediators, and the internal cellular microenvironment (54Piette J. Piret B. Bonizzi G. Schoonbroodt S. Merville M.P. Legrand-Poels S. Bours V. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 1237-1245PubMed Google Scholar, 55Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3415) Google Scholar). In unstimulated resting cells, NF-κB is inactive; it is induced by internal or external stresses (54Piette J. Piret B. Bonizzi G. Schoonbroodt S. Merville M.P. Legrand-Poels S. Bours V. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 1237-1245PubMed Google Scholar, 56Rupec R.A. Baeuerle P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 632-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). NF-κB is a multisubunit transcription factor, and its activity is regulated by interaction with specific inhibitory proteins, Iκ-Bs. Upon cell stimulation, IκBs become phosphorylated and subsequently ubiquitinylated. Released NF-κB translocates into the nucleus and binds to the target sequences and initiates transcription of “defense genes” involved in inflammatory responses and pathophysiology of cells and tissues. This molecule may sense ROS-induced stress, and its function may be altered in relation to the levels of ROS in cellular microenvironment. Earlier study has shown that proapoptotic and antiapoptotic roles of NF-κB depend on cell type and cell environment (57Uberti D. Carsana T. Francisconi S. Ferrari Toninelli G. Canonico P.L. Memo M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 67: 1743-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Recently, two putative NF-κB sites have been predicted in the Prdx6 gene promoter (31Gallagher B.M. Phelan S.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2007; 42: 1270-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and have been thought to be involved in Prdx6 regulation. However, based on current study using transactivation and mutational analysis of the Prdx6 promoter coupled with Smad3- and Prdx6-deficient lens cells as models as well as biochemical assays, we think the control of NF-κB signaling in tuning of Prdx6 gene expression is attenuated in Prdx6-depleted cells (redox state) or aging cells, due to activation of Smad3-mediated TGFβ-induced repressive signaling. The process attenuates Nrf2 activation of Prdx6 gene transcription (58Chowdhury I. Mo Y. Gao L. Kazi A. Fisher A.B. Feinstein S.I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2009; 46: 146-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) as well. Thus, autoregulation of Prdx6 disrupted in response to internal or external stressors. However, Web-based computer analysis (MatInspector; Genomatix) of the 5′-flanking region of the Prdx6 promoter revealed that it has various putative regulatory elements as follows: SP1, E2F-Myc, Nrf2, HIF1α, PBX1-MEIS1, EREs, GRE, GATA-1, HSF1, LEDGF, c-ETS-1, v-Myb, Oct1/Oct2, etc., including two sites of the NF-κB at −644 to −635 and −948 to −939 as well as two sites of RSBE (TIE) (45Chen C.R. Kang Y. Siegel P.M. Massagué J. Cell. 2002; 110: 19-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 47Frederick J.P. Liberati N.T. Waddell D.S. Shi Y. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2546-2559Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) at −379 to −367 and −482 to −471 from the transcription start site. In the present investigation, using Prdx6−/−- and Smad3−/−-deficient lens epithelial cells (LECs) and a variety of biochemical assays, we examined the regulation of Prdx6 expression by ROS-driven Smad3-mediated TGFβ1-induced adverse signaling in cells facing oxidative stress, and we have shown this as a model to study the ROS-induced TGFβ1-mediated adverse signaling in LECs that may lead to degenerative disorders, including cataractogenesis. We identified two novel NF-κB-binding elements and two RSBE elements in the Prdx6 promoter and demonstrated how Smad3, a protein known to be involved in regulation of TGFβ target genes, may attenuate Prdx6 gene transcription and thereby negatively regulate survival signaling in cells in the redox state. Given the role of ROS as a mediator of normal signaling, we propose a rheostat role for NF-κB in determining optimum regulation of Prdx6 expression to maintain physiological ROS levels. The studies reported here provide insight regarding how the gene network is changed during aging or oxidative stress and should provide clues potentially useful in the development of a transcription- or antioxidant-based therapy. Lens epithelial cell lines from lenses isolated from Prdx6-targeted mutants (Prdx6−/−) and wild-type (Prdx6+/+) mice were generated and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum as described earlier (1Fatma N. Kubo E. Sharma P. Beier D.R. Singh D.P. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 734-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Prdx6−/−129/Sv mice were generated at Harvard Medical School under the supervision of Dr. David R. Beier (59Iakoubova O.A. Pacella L.A. Her H. Beier D.R. Genomics. 1997; 42: 474-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Prdx6−/− mutant mice of pure 129 background were used during the present study. Wild-type 129/Sv inbred mice of the same sex and age were used as control (Prdx6+/+). All animals were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions in the animal house at Harvard Medical School. Smad3−/− knock-out mice were obtained from Dr. Beebe (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). These mice have been generated by Deng and co-workers (34Yang X. Letterio J.J. Lechleider R.J. Chen L. Hayman R. Gu H. Roberts A.B. Deng C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1280-1291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The generation, characterization, and mating of mutant mice and the progeny of Smad3-targeted mice have been described in detail (34Yang X. Letterio J.J. Lechleider R.J. Chen L. Hayman R. Gu H. Roberts A.B. Deng C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1280-1291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting progeny were screened by PCR to identify Smad3−/− and wild-type mice. As mentioned above, lens epithelial cells were isolated from lenses isolated from the mice of identical age, and Western analysis was carried out to confirm the presence of αA-crystallin, a specific marker of LECs, in both Smad3−/− and Smad3+/+ LECs (see Fig. 9B). LECs (passages 3–5) were used for the experiments. Cell lysates were prepared in ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer, as described previously (1Fatma N. Kubo E. Sharma P. Beier D.R.

Equal amounts of protein samples were loaded onto a 10% SDS-gel, blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and immunostained with primary antibodies at the appropriate dilutions (αA-crystallin antibody (a kind gift from Dr. Jack Liang, Harvard Medical School); PRDX6 monoclonal antibody (Lab Frontier, Seoul, Korea); TGFβ1, pIκBα, IκBα, Smad3, and RelA antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); pSmad3 antibody (BIOSOURCE International Inc.). Membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1500 dilution). Specific protein bands were visualized by incubating the membrane with luminal reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and exposing to film (X-Omat; Eastman Kodak Co.) and recorded with a FUJIFILM-LAS-4000 luminescent image analyzer (FUJIFILM Medical Systems Inc.). To ascertain comparative expression and equal loading of the protein samples, the membrane stained earlier was stripped and reprobed with actin antibody (Sigma). The 5′-flanking region (−1139 to +109 bp) (Fig. 1, Construct A) was isolated from mouse genomic DNA and sequenced. A construct of −1139 bp was prepared by ligating it to basic pCAT vector (Promega) using the SacI and XhoI sites. Similarly, constructs of deletion mutants of different sizes (Fig. 2, Constructs B and C) of the Prdx6 promoter with appropriate sense primers bearing SacI and reverse primer with XhoI were made and used in the present study. The plasmid was amplified and used for the CAT assay. Primers were as follows: Construct Afor, 5′-CTGAGAGCTCCTGCCATGTTC-3′; Construct Bfor, 5′-CTTCCTCTGGAGCTCAGAATTTAC-3′; Construct Cfor, 5′-CACAGAGCTCGTTCTTGCCACATC-3′; Constructs A, B, and Crev, 5′-CAGGAACTCGAGGAAGCGGAT-3′.FIGURE 2Transcriptional repression of different deletion mutants of Prdx6 gene promoter linked to CAT in Prdx6+/+ and Prdx6−/− cells.

https://openalex.org/W2146868760,"The unique cytokine interleukin-18 (IL-18) acts synergistically with IL-12 to regulate T-helper 1 and 2 lymphocytes and, as such, seems to underlie the pathogenesis of various autoimmune and allergic diseases. Several anti-IL-18 agents are in clinical development, including the recombinant human antibody ABT-325, which is entering trials for autoimmune diseases. Given competing cytokine/receptor and cytokine/receptor decoy interactions, understanding the structural basis for recognition is critical for effective development of anti-cytokine therapies. Here we report three crystal structures: the murine antibody 125-2H Fab fragment bound to human IL-18, at 1.5 A resolution; the 125-2H Fab (2.3 A); and the ABT-325 Fab (1.5 A). These structures, along with human/mouse IL-18 chimera binding data, allow us to make three key observations relevant to the biology and antigenic recognition of IL-18 and related cytokines. First, several IL-18 residues shift dramatically (> 10 A) upon binding 125-2H, compared with unbound IL-18 (Kato, Z., Jee, J., Shikano, H., Mishima, M., Ohki, I., Ohnishi, H., Li, A., Hashimoto, K., Matsukuma, E., Omoya, K., Yamamoto, Y., Yoneda, T., Hara, T., Kondo, N., and Shirakawa, M. (2003) Nat. Struct. Biol. 10, 966-971). IL-18 thus exhibits plasticity that may be common to its interactions with other receptors. Related cytokines may exhibit similar plasticity. Second, ABT-325 and 125-2H differ significantly in combining site character and architecture, thus explaining their ability to bind IL-18 simultaneously at distinct epitopes. These data allow us to define the likely ABT-325 epitope and thereby explain the distinct neutralizing mechanisms of both antibodies. Third, given the high 125-2H potency, 10 well ordered water molecules are trapped upon complex formation in a cavity between two IL-18 loops and all six 125-2H complementarity-determining regions. Thus, counterintuitively, tight and specific antibody binding may in some cases be water-mediated."

This study was designed to examine myocardial histology, cardiomyocyte shortening, intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and regulatory proteins, electrocardiogram, adrenergic response, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and protein carbonyl formation in C57 wild-type (WT) mice and an APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic (APP/PS1) model for Alzheimer's disease. Methods Cardiomyocyte mechanical properties were evaluated including peak shortening (PS), time-to-PS (TPS), time-to-relengthening (TR), maximal velocity of shortening and relengthening (±dL/dt), intracellular Ca2+ transient rise and decay. Results Little histological changes were observed in APP/PS1 myocardium. Cardiomyocytes from APP/PS1 but not APP or PS1 single mutation mice exhibited depressed PS, reduced±dL/dt, normal TPS and TR compared with WT mice. Rise in intracellular Ca2+ was lower accompanied by unchanged resting/peak intracellular Ca2+ levels and intracellular Ca2+ decay in APP/PS1 mice. Cardiomyocytes from APP/PS1 mice exhibited a steeper decline in PS at high frequencies. The responsiveness to adrenergic agonists was dampened although β1-adrenergic receptor expression was unchanged in APP/PS1 hearts. Expression of the Ca2+ regulatory protein phospholamban and protein carbonyl formation were downregulated and elevated, respectively, associated with unchanged SERCA2a, Na+-Ca2+ exchanger and ER stress markers in APP/PS1 hearts. Our further study revealed that antioxidant N-acetylcysteine attenuated the contractile dysfunction in APP/PS1 mice. Conclusions Our results depicted overt cardiomyocyte mechanical dysfunction in the APP/PS1 Alzheimer's disease model, possibly due to oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2118305800,"Background In brain, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) activation can induce long-lasting changes in synaptic α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) receptor (AMPAR) levels. These changes are believed to underlie the expression of several forms of synaptic plasticity, including long-term potentiation (LTP). Such plasticity is generally believed to reflect the regulated trafficking of AMPARs within dendritic spines. However, recent work suggests that the movement of molecules and organelles between the spine and the adjacent dendritic shaft can critically influence synaptic plasticity. To determine whether such movement is strictly required for plasticity, we have developed a novel system to examine AMPAR trafficking in brain synaptosomes, consisting of isolated and apposed pre- and postsynaptic elements. Methodology/Principal Findings We report here that synaptosomes can undergo LTP-like plasticity in response to stimuli that mimic synaptic NMDAR activation. Indeed, KCl-evoked release of endogenous glutamate from presynaptic terminals, in the presence of the NMDAR co-agonist glycine, leads to a long-lasting increase in surface AMPAR levels, as measured by [3H]-AMPA binding; the increase is prevented by an NMDAR antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5). Importantly, we observe an increase in the levels of GluR1 and GluR2 AMPAR subunits in the postsynaptic density (PSD) fraction, without changes in total AMPAR levels, consistent with the trafficking of AMPARs from internal synaptosomal compartments into synaptic sites. This plasticity is reversible, as the application of AMPA after LTP depotentiates synaptosomes. Moreover, depotentiation requires proteasome-dependent protein degradation. Conclusions/Significance Together, the results indicate that the minimal machinery required for LTP is present and functions locally within isolated dendritic spines."
https://openalex.org/W1996371826,"Facile control of targeted intracellular protein degradation has many potential uses in basic science and biotechnology. One promising approach to this goal is to redesign adaptor proteins, which can regulate proteolytic specificity by tethering substrates to energy-dependent AAA+ proteases. Using the ClpXP protease, we have probed the minimal biochemical functions required for adaptor function by designing and characterizing variant substrates, adaptors, and ClpX enzymes. We find that substrate tethering mediated by heterologous interaction domains and a small bridging molecule mimics substrate delivery by the wild-type system. These results show that simple tethering is sufficient for synthetic adaptor function. In our engineered system, tethering and proteolysis depend on the presence of the macrolide rapamycin, providing a foundation for engineering highly specific degradation of target proteins in cells. Importantly, this degradation is regulated by a small molecule without the need for new adaptor or enzyme biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1981298473,"Humans can easily restore a speech signal that is temporally masked by an interfering sound (e.g., a cough masking parts of a word in a conversation), and listeners have the illusion that the speech continues through the interfering sound. This perceptual restoration for human speech is affected by prior experience. Here we provide evidence for perceptual restoration in complex vocalizations of a songbird that are acquired by vocal learning in a similar way as humans learn their language.European starlings were trained in a same/different paradigm to report salient differences between successive sounds. The birds' response latency for discriminating between a stimulus pair is an indicator for the salience of the difference, and these latencies can be used to evaluate perceptual distances using multi-dimensional scaling. For familiar motifs the birds showed a large perceptual distance if discriminating between song motifs that were muted for brief time periods and complete motifs. If the muted periods were filled with noise, the perceptual distance was reduced. For unfamiliar motifs no such difference was observed.The results suggest that starlings are able to perceptually restore partly masked sounds and, similarly to humans, rely on prior experience. They may be a suitable model to study the mechanism underlying experience-dependent perceptual restoration."
https://openalex.org/W1987525020,"Histamine is a biogenic amine that has been shown to contribute to several pathological conditions, such as allergic conditions, experimental encephalomyelitis, and malaria. In humans, as well as in murine models of malaria, increased plasma levels of histamine are associated with severity of infection. We reported recently that histamine plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of experimental cerebral malaria (CM) in mice infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA. Histamine exerts its biological effects through four different receptors designated H1R, H2R, H3R, and H4R.In the present work, we explored the role of histamine signaling via the histamine H3 receptor (H3R) in the pathogenesis of murine CM. We observed that the lack of H3R expression (H3R(-/-) mice) accelerates the onset of CM and this was correlated with enhanced brain pathology and earlier and more pronounced loss of blood brain barrier integrity than in wild type mice. Additionally tele-methylhistamine, the major histamine metabolite in the brain, that was initially present at a higher level in the brain of H3R(-/-) mice was depleted more quickly post-infection in H3R(-/-) mice as compared to wild-type counterparts.Our data suggest that histamine regulation through the H3R in the brain suppresses the development of CM. Thus modulating histamine signaling in the central nervous system, in combination with standard therapies, may represent a novel strategy to reduce the risk of progression to cerebral malaria."
https://openalex.org/W2086422260,"The majority of human telomere length studies have focused on the overall length of telomeres within a cell. In fact, very few studies have examined telomere length for individual chromosome arms. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between chromosome arm size and the relative length of the associated telomere. Quantitative Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (Q-FISH) was used to measure the relative telomere length of each chromosome arm in metaphases from cultured lymphocytes of 17 individuals. A statistically significant positive correlation (r = 0.6) was found between telomere length and the size of the associated chromosome arm, which was estimated based on megabase pair measurements from http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/mapview/."
https://openalex.org/W2147976241,"Based on theoretical reasoning it has been suggested that the reliability of findings published in the scientific literature decreases with the popularity of a research field. Here we provide empirical support for this prediction. We evaluate published statements on protein interactions with data from high-throughput experiments. We find evidence for two distinctive effects. First, with increasing popularity of the interaction partners, individual statements in the literature become more erroneous. Second, the overall evidence on an interaction becomes increasingly distorted by multiple independent testing. We therefore argue that for increasing the reliability of research it is essential to assess the negative effects of popularity and develop approaches to diminish these effects."
https://openalex.org/W2044012842,"The proton-coupled amino acid transporter 1 (PAT1, SLC36A1) mediates the uptake of small neutral amino acids at the apical membrane of intestinal epithelial cells after protein digestion. The transporter is currently under intense investigation, because it is a possible vehicle for oral drug delivery. Structural features of the protein such as the number of transmembrane domains, the substrate binding site, or essential amino acids are still unknown. In the present study we use mutagenesis experiments and biochemical approaches to determine the role of the three putative extracellular cysteine residues on transport function and their possible involvement in the formation of a disulfide bridge. As treatment with the reducing reagent dithiothreitol impaired transport function of hPAT1 wild type protein, substitution of putative extracellular cysteine residues Cys-180, Cys-329, and Cys-473 by alanine or serine was performed. Replacement of the two highly conserved cysteine residues Cys-180 and Cys-329 abolished the transport function of hPAT1 in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Studies of wild type and mutant transporters expressed in human retinal pigment epithelial (HRPE) cells suggested that the binding of the substrate was inhibited in these mutants. Substitution of the third putative extracellular nonconserved cysteine residue Cys-473 did not affect transport function. All mutants were expressed at the plasma membrane. Biotinylation of free sulfhydryl groups using maleimide-PEG11-biotin and SDS-PAGE analysis under reducing and nonreducing conditions provided direct evidence for the existence of an essential disulfide bond between Cys-180 and Cys-329.

Comprising 384 members, the 46 SLC families include transporters for inorganic ions, amino acids, neurotransmitters, sugars, purines, fatty acids, and other substances (1Fredriksson R. Nordström K.J. Stephansson O. Hägglund M.G. Schiöth H.B. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 3811-3816Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Ten SLC families contain 47 known transporters for amino acids and 48 related orphan transporters. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four main clusters (α, β, γ, and δ). Together with members of the SLC32 and SLC38 families, the proton-coupled amino acid transporter 1 (PAT1) was placed into group β. PAT1 is a member of the SLC36 family (SLC36A1). It was originally identified as the lysosomal amino acid transporter (LYAAT1) in rat brain (2Sagné C. Agulhon C. Ravassard P. Darmon M. Hamon M. El Mestikawy S. Gasnier B. Giros B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 7206-7211Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Subsequently, mouse and human homologs were cloned from mouse intestine (3Boll M. Foltz M. Rubio-Aliaga I. Kottra G. Daniel H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22966-22973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and from Caco-2 cells (4Chen Z. Fei Y.J. Anderson C.M. Wake K.A. Miyauchi S. Huang W. Thwaites D.T. Ganapathy V. J. Physiol. 2003; 546: 349-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), respectively. PAT1 is identical to the H+/amino acid cotransporter that has been functionally described in Caco-2 cells (5Thwaites D.T. McEwan G.T. Cook M.J. Hirst B.H. Simmons N.L. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It is localized mainly to the apical membrane of intestine epithelial cells and is also found in lysosomes in brain neurons (4Chen Z. Fei Y.J. Anderson C.M. Wake K.A. Miyauchi S. Huang W. Thwaites D.T. Ganapathy V. J. Physiol. 2003; 546: 349-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) facilitating the transport of amino acids from luminal protein digestion or lysosomal proteolysis, respectively. The transport of substrates via PAT1 is driven by an inwardly directed H+ gradient. Recently we could identify the conserved His-55 as being responsible for binding and translocation of the proton (6Metzner L. Natho K. Zebisch K. Dorn M. Bosse-Doenecke E. Ganapathy V. Brandsch M.

Recently, PAT1 gained much interest because it transports pharmaceutically relevant compounds such as d-cycloserine, l-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid, 3-amino-1-propanesulfonic acid, 3,4-dehydro-l-proline, vigabatrin, and other GABA analogs (8Metzner L.

Sci. 2008; 35: 86-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) rendering it an interesting target for the pharmaceutical industry. PAT1 seems to be one of the most important drug transporters in the intestine allowing oral availability of GABA-related and other drugs and prodrugs. Furthermore, a recent report shows involvement of this transporter family, namely the PAT2 subtype, in the autosomal dominant inherited disorder iminoglycinuria (12Bröer S. Bailey C.G. Kowalczuk S. Ng C. Vanslambrouck J.M. Rodgers H. Auray-Blais C. Cavanaugh J.A. Bröer A. Rasko J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 3881-3892Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, up to now the exact three-dimensional structure of PAT1, the transmembrane domain topology, and the substrate binding site are unknown. More structural information of PAT1 would allow a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of its function and drug interaction, which is so far being investigated only in classic transport studies. Mutational analysis of putative extracellular regions is a suitable tool to get the first clue into transmembrane organization and relevant amino acid residues (6Metzner L. Natho K. Zebisch K. Dorn M. Bosse-Doenecke E. Ganapathy V. Brandsch M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 1042-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This approach should also elucidate the spatial organization of the extracellular loops. The present study was performed to identify functionally important extracellular cysteine residues and their involvement in disulfide bridges. The relevance of disulfide bonds for membrane protein function is mainly based on the stabilization of a proper three-dimensional structure. The correct conformation in turn is essential for trafficking, surface expression, stability, and transport function. So far, intramolecular disulfide bonds have been identified for only very few SLCs, e.g. the serotonin transporter SERT and the dopamine transporter DAT (13Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 14Sur C. Schloss P. Betz H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cell Biochem. 2007; 298: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Native disulfide bonds are probably required for transporter function of the Na+/glucose cotransporter SGLT1 (16Turner R.J. George J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3565-3570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Gagnon D.G. Bissonnette P. Lapointe J.Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 127: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For the type IIa sodium/phosphate cotransporter, it was shown that cleavage of disulfide bonds results in conformational changes that lead to internalization and subsequent lysosomal degradation of the transport protein (18Lambert G. Traebert M. Biber J. Murer H. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 176: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A similar stabilizing effect of an intramolecular disulfide bridge was also reported for the human ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter ABCG2 (19Wakabayashi K. Nakagawa H. Tamura A. Koshiba S. Hoshijima K. Komada M. Ishikawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27841-27846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Linkage via cysteine residues can also be necessary for transporter oligomerization. For the rat serotonin transporter SERT (20Jess U. Betz H. Schloss P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 44-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and for the human ABC transporter ABCG2 (21Kage K. Fujita T. Sugimoto Y. Cancer Sci. 2005; 96: 866-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), intermolecular disulfide bridges could be identified. For the hexose transporter GLUT1, an intramolecular disulfide bond promotes tetramerization of the transporter (22Hebert D.N. Carruthers A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4654-4658Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 23Zottola R.J. Cloherty E.K. Coderre P.E. Hansen A. Hebert D.N. Carruthers A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9734-9747Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). On the other hand, removal of cysteine residues can also lead to an impaired trafficking and mislocalization of the transporter protein without a disulfide bridge being involved (13Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 24Pajor A.M. Krajewski S.J. Sun N. Gangula R. Biochem.

Chem. 2005; 280: 36926-36934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In those cases, the cysteine residues themselves are assumed to play an important role for the trafficking and targeting of the transporter to the cell surface. Similarly, for several transporters, cysteine residues located in a transmembrane domain play a key role in substrate recognition. Single cysteines have been found to be essential for substrate binding of the rat organic cation transporters rOCT1 and rOCT2 (26Sturm A. Gorboulev V. Gorbunov D. Keller T. Volk C. Schmitt B.M. Schlachtbauer P. Ciarimboli G. Koepsell H. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2007; 293: F767-F779Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and the multidrug and toxin extrusion transporter MATE1 (27Asaka J. Terada T. Tsuda M. Katsura T. Inui K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 1487-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The relevance of conserved cysteines for the integrity of a membrane protein has therefore to be investigated very thoroughly. Several earlier studies reported loss of function in cysteine mutants without testing membrane localization. After assessing a negative influence of the reducing reagent DTT on hPAT1 function, we performed systematic mutagenesis in this study. The three putative extracellular cysteine residues Cys-180, Cys-329, and Cys-473 were individually exchanged to either alanine or serine residues. The resulting mutants were analyzed for substrate binding and transport in human retinal pigment epithelial (HRPE) cells and electrogenic transport in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Biochemical approaches provided direct evidence for an essential disulfide bond between Cys-180 and Cys-329. A triple mutant was constructed and examined to exclude other juxtamembrane cysteine residues as potential partners for disulfide bridges. The data suggest that this disulfide bridge is involved in forming or stabilizing the putative substrate-binding pocket. In addition, our results strongly support the eleven transmembrane domain topology model of hPAT1. This is consistent with our recently published data on glycosylation of hPAT1 (28Dorn M. Jaehme M. Weiwad M. Markwardt F. Rudolph R. Brandsch M. Bosse-Doenecke E. FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 1631-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). l-[3H]Proline (specific radioactivity 49 Ci/mmol) was purchased from GE Healthcare (Little Chalfont, UK). Chemical reagents were from Sigma. Cell culture media and supplements were obtained from Invitrogen (Karlsruhe, Germany). The following antibodies were used: polyclonal rabbit anti-HA tag antibody (Sigma), monoclonal mouse anti-HA tag antibody, goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Heidelberg, Germany) and AlexaFluor® 488 goat anti-rabbit antibody (Invitrogen). The recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara was provided by the GSF-Institute for Molecular Virology (Munich, Germany). Maleimide-PEG11-Biotin was purchased from Pierce. The X. laevis oocyte expression vector pNKS was kindly provided by Prof. G. Schmalzing (RWTH, Aachen, Germany) as pNKS-transducin. This vector contains the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of the X. laevis oocyte β-globin gene and the cDNA of murine transducin. The latter was cut out of the vector using the restriction enzymes AatII and XbaI. To clone the transporter cDNA into pNKS, AatII and XbaI restriction sites were introduced at the 5′- and 3′-end by PCR, respectively. As template, the previously described wild type cDNA of human PAT1 containing an N-terminal HA tag in the pSPORT1 (pSPORT1-HA-hPAT1) vector was used (6Metzner L. Natho K. Zebisch K. Dorn M. Bosse-Doenecke E. Ganapathy V. Brandsch M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 1042-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For the analog construction of pNKS-hPAT1, the pSPORT1-hPAT1 served as template. After restriction enzyme digestion, the PCR product was ligated into the digested pNKS vector. The insertion of the correct cDNA was verified by sequencing. Cysteine residues at positions 180, 329, and 473 were exchanged for alanine and serine residues, respectively, with the QuikChange® II Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). For expression in HRPE cells or X. laevis oocytes the pSPORT1-HA-hPAT1 vector (6Metzner L. Natho K. Zebisch K. Dorn M. Bosse-Doenecke E. Ganapathy V. Brandsch M. Biochim. Biophys.

Primers to introduce the desired mutations into the respective vector were as follows: (C180A) 5′-GGGACCACCAATAACGCCCACAACAATGAGACGG-3′, (C180S) 5′-CCAATGGGACCACCAATAACAGCCACAACAATGAGACG-3′, (C329A) 5′-CCCTCAACCTGCCCAACGCATGGCTGTACCAGTCAGTTAAG-3′, (C329S) 5′-CCCTCAACCTGCCCAATTCATGGCTGTACCAGTCAGTTAAG-3′, (C473A) 5′-CCATCTTCATCAATTCCACCGCTGCCTTCATATAGGG-3′, (C473S) 5′-CCATCTTCATCAATTCCACCAGTGCCTTCATATAGGG-3′. The insertion of the mutation and the correct cDNA sequence were confirmed by DNA sequencing (MWG Biotech AG, Ebersberg, Germany). The wild type and mutant pNKS-HA-hPAT1 and pNKS-hPAT1 constructs served as templates for cRNA synthesis. After linearizing the plasmids with NotI, cRNAs were synthesized using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE® SP6 kit (Ambion, Huntingdon, UK). The cRNAs were purified with the aid of the MEGAclearTM kit (Ambion), and the concentration was determined by UV absorbance at 260 nm. The cRNA was stored at −80 °C.

Biochem. 1991; 194: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and the Nanofectin® technology (PAA Laboratories, Cölbe, Germany) as reported by Metzner et al. (6Metzner L. Natho K. Zebisch K. Dorn M. Bosse-Doenecke E. Ganapathy V. Brandsch M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 1042-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, HRPE cells grown in 24-well plates (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany) were infected 22 h after seeding with the recombinant MVA (50 IU/cell). After 30 min, cells were transfected with wild type and mutant HA-hPAT1 plasmid or the empty vector pSPORT1 as control. 21 h after transfection uptake measurements or immunofluorescence experiments were performed. Transfected cells were rinsed twice with uptake buffer (25 mm MES/Tris pH 6.0, 140 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 5 mm glucose) at room temperature followed by incubation in uptake buffer containing 20 nml-[3H]proline for 10 min. Cells were washed four times with ice cold uptake buffer and solubilized in 500 μl of lysis buffer (0.2 m NaOH, 1% SDS). Scintillation mixture (2.8 ml) was added to each lysate, and the radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry (Tri-Carb 2100TR, Packard Instrument Company, Meriden). To study the effect of DTT (Applichem, Darmstadt, Germany) treatment on l-[3H]proline uptake, transfected cells were incubated for 20 min at room temperature in DTT-containing buffer (25 mm HEPES/Tris, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm DTT). Uptake experiments were carried out as described above except that the uptake buffer also contained 10 mm DTT. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. of three to seven independent experiments. Oocytes were surgically removed from anesthetized X. laevis frogs, dissected, and defolliculated as described by Riedel et al. (30Riedel T. Lozinsky I. Schmalzing G. Markwardt F. Biophys. J. 2007; 92: 2377-2391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In brief, for anesthesia tricaine methane sulfonate (Sigma) was used. The removed oocytes were separated by collagenase treatment (2 mg/ml) for 2 h. Healthy stage V-VI oocytes were manually selected and 25 ng of wild type or mutant cRNA were injected per oocyte. As control, water-injected oocytes were used. Injected oocytes were maintained at 19 °C in modified Barth舗s medium (5 mm HEPES/NaOH pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10,000 units/ml penicillin, and 10 mg/ml streptomycin). 5–6 days after injection electrophysiological measurements or biochemical studies were performed. Two-electrode voltage clamp signals were recorded to assess the electrogenic function of the surface-expressed transport protein. Oocytes were placed in a flow-through chamber and continuously superfused (75 μl/s) with oocyte Ringer (ORi) buffer (10 mm MES/Tris, pH 6.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm KCl) in the absence or presence of amino acids at a concentration of 20 mm. Quick and reproducible solution exchanges were achieved using a small tube-like chamber (0.1 ml) combined with fast superfusion (31Klapperstück M. Büttner C. Böhm T. Schmalzing G. Markwardt F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1467: 444-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 32Bretschneider F. Markwardt F. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 294: 180-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Microelectrodes with resistances between 0.8 and 1.4 mΩ were pulled of borosilicate glass and filled with 3 m KCl. Whole-cell currents were recorded and filtered at 100 Hz using a two-electrode voltage clamp amplifier (OC-725C, Hamden) and sampled at 85 Hz. Oocytes were voltage clamped at a membrane potential of −60 mV. Currents induced by application of amino acids were calculated as the difference of the currents measured in the presence and absence of amino acid. All experiments were performed at room temperature (≈22 °C). To determine the effect of the extracellular pH on hPAT1 function, the currents induced by 20 mm glycine at pH values varying from 5.0 to 8.0 (ORi buffer: 10 mm MES/Tris or HEPES/Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm KCl) were recorded. The Michaelis constants (Kt) were derived from experiments with seven different glycine concentrations (0–100 mm) at pH 6.5 in ORi buffer. Mean values ± S.E. were calculated from measurements of 6–8 oocytes from two batches and the kinetic constants were obtained by nonlinear regression of the Michaelis-Menten plot (SigmaPlot, Systat Software GmbH, Erkrath, Germany). To assess the influence of DTT on transporter function oocytes were exposed to 10 mm DTT in modified Barth舗s medium (5 mm HEPES/NaOH pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2) for 20 min. Two-electrode voltage clamp experiments were performed as described above with the exception that all buffers contained 10 mm DTT. Data were analyzed using the Superpatch 2000 program (Julius-Bernstein-Institute for Physiology, SP-Analyzer by T. Böhm, Halle, Germany). Statistical values are expressed as mean ± S.E. from measurements of 6–8 oocytes from at least two batches of oocyte preparation. Transfected HRPE cells grown on coverslips in 6-well plates were fixed and permeabilized with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.05% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 20 min. After removal of excess of paraformaldehyde by incubation with 0.1 mm NH4Cl, nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. Cells were then incubated for 2 h with the primary antibody (rabbit anti-HA tag) diluted 1:2000 in 5% BSA/PBS, washed, and incubated for 1 h in the dark with the secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit AlexaFluor® 488) diluted 1:500 in 5% BSA/PBS. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride; 1:100 in PBS). Coverslips were mounted on microscope slides using CitiFluor® (Plano, Wetzlar, Germany). All steps were performed at room temperature. Oocytes expressing either wild type or mutant transporter were fixed with ethanol/acetic acid (95:5) for 1.5 h at 4 °C. After washing with 5% BSA/PBS several times, they were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody (rabbit anti-HA tag) diluted 1:1600 in 5% BSA/PBS followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with the secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit AlexaFluor® 488) 1:500 in 5% BSA/PBS. Oocytes were washed with 5% BSA/PBS and then mounted on microscope slides using CitiFluor® (Plano). Images were obtained using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Nikon ECLIPSE TE2000). For biotinylation of free extracellular cysteinyl sulfhydryl groups the membrane-impermeant reagent maleimide-PEG11-biotin was used. In each case, 20 oocytes injected with either wild type or mutant transporter cRNA were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in biotinylation reagent (0.5 mg/ml maleimide-PEG11-biotin) in modified Barth舗s medium (5 mm HEPES/NaOH pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2). After washing with modified Barth舗s medium oocytes were homogenized in 20 μl/oocyte of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1x protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany)). The solubilized oocytes were then centrifuged at 16,000 × g (4 °C) for 15 min. To precipitate biotinylated proteins, 300 μl of the supernatant were added to 50 μl of NeutrAvidin® beads (Pierce) and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer. For elution of bound protein, the lysis buffer was replaced by 30 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (6 m urea, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.02% bromphenol blue, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% SDS, 15% glycerin) and heated to 95 °C for 10 min. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10%, 8 × 10 cm) and immunoblotting. Oocytes expressing either wild type or mutant hPAT1 were homogenized in 20 μl/oocyte of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1× protease inhibitor). After centrifugation of solubilized oocytes (16,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C) the supernatant was supplemented with 50 mm iodoacetamide and divided into two equal aliquots. To one sample, 100 mm DTT was added. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (7.5%, 10 × 10 cm) and immunoblotted in nonreducing sample buffer (8 m urea, 10% SDS, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 0.02% bromphenol blue). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking of membranes in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBT buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween) for 1 h at room temperature, Western blots were probed with the primary antibody (mouse anti-HA tag) diluted 1:1000 in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBT buffer overnight at 4 °C. The secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody) was used in a dilution of 1:2000 in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBT buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Antibody binding was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence with the Super Signal West Pico Substrate (Pierce). X. laevis oocytes were used for heterologous expression of wild type and mutant hPAT1/HA-hPAT1. To determine and characterize their transport function, oocytes were injected with transporter cRNA and the two-electrode voltage clamp technique was applied. As control, water-injected oocytes were used. Application of 20 mm glycine or proline to hPAT1-expressing oocytes at an extracellular pH of 6.5 and a membrane potential of −60 mV induced inward currents of 130 nA and 170 nA, respectively (Fig. 1A). l-Tryptophan, an inhibitor of hPAT1 transport function (33Metzner L. Kottra G. Neubert K. Daniel H. Brandsch M. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1468-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), did not induce detectable inward currents. In water-injected oocytes, glycine and proline were not able to generate inward currents. These results show that glycine and proline are transported by the human PAT1 expressed in oocytes in an electrogenic manner. As shown in Fig. 1B, the electrogenic uptake of glycine by hPAT1 and HA-hPAT1 is strongly pH-dependent. At pH 7.5 and 8.0, electrogenic uptake of glycine (20 mm) at a membrane potential of −60 mV was hardly detectable both at PAT1 and at HA-PAT1. With increasing extracellular H+ concentrations the signals elicited by glycine increased with a maximum at pH 5.5 and 5.0. For determination of the kinetic constants of glycine uptake by hPAT1 and HA-hPAT1, glycine was added at increasing concentrations to hPAT1-expressing oocytes at pH 6.5 under voltage cl"
https://openalex.org/W2058065127,"Dynamical systems like neural networks based on lateral inhibition have a large field of applications in image processing, robotics and morphogenesis modeling. In this paper, we will propose some examples of dynamical flows used in image contrasting and contouring.First we present the physiological basis of the retina function by showing the role of the lateral inhibition in the optical illusions and pathologic processes generation. Then, based on these biological considerations about the real vision mechanisms, we study an enhancement method for contrasting medical images, using either a discrete neural network approach, or its continuous version, i.e. a non-isotropic diffusion reaction partial differential system. Following this, we introduce other continuous operators based on similar biomimetic approaches: a chemotactic contrasting method, a viability contouring algorithm and an attentional focus operator. Then, we introduce the new notion of mixed potential Hamiltonian flows; we compare it with the watershed method and we use it for contouring.We conclude by showing the utility of these biomimetic methods with some examples of application in medical imaging and computed assisted surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2083043936,"Background Postembryonic development, including metamorphosis, of many animals is under control of hormones. In Drosophila and other insects these developmental transitions are regulated by the coordinate action of two principal hormones, the steroid ecdysone and the sesquiterpenoid juvenile hormone (JH). While the mode of ecdysone action is relatively well understood, the molecular mode of JH action remains elusive. Methodology/Principal Findings To gain more insights into the molecular mechanism of JH action, we have tested the biological activity of 86 structurally diverse JH agonists in Drosophila melanogaster. The results were evaluated using 3D QSAR analyses involving CoMFA and CoMSIA procedures. Using this approach we have generated both computer-aided and species-specific pharmacophore fingerprints of JH and its agonists, which revealed that the most active compounds must possess an electronegative atom (oxygen or nitrogen) at both ends of the molecule. When either of these electronegative atoms are replaced by carbon or the distance between them is shorter than 11.5 Å or longer than 13.5 Å, their biological activity is dramatically decreased. The presence of an electron-deficient moiety in the middle of the JH agonist is also essential for high activity. Conclusions/Significance The information from 3D QSAR provides guidelines and mechanistic scope for identification of steric and electrostatic properties as well as donor and acceptor hydrogen-bonding that are important features of the ligand-binding cavity of a JH target protein. In order to refine the pharmacophore analysis and evaluate the outcomes of the CoMFA and CoMSIA study we used pseudoreceptor modeling software PrGen to generate a putative binding site surrogate that is composed of eight amino acid residues corresponding to the defined molecular interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1977832726,"Influenza A viruses are RNA viruses that contain negative-sense, single-stranded’ and segmented RNA genome, which depends on virally encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and cellular DNA-dependent RNA polymerase for replication of viral genome and transcription of viral mRNA, respectively. Hemagglutinin (HA), one of the major surface proteins of the influenza virus is responsible for virus attachment to the receptor of host cells to initiate an infection. Amino acid (AA) substitutions in HA may cause changes in virus antigenicity and even receptor specificity. To detect the AA substitutions within HA at protein level nanoelectrospray-MS/MS was used to analyze tryptic digestion of HA antigen directly purified from virus particles of an avian influenza virus, A/WDK/JX/12416/2005 (H1N1), of which the HA gene was sequenced as a reference. The comparison of the sequences obtained from analysis of viral genome and peptide found seven variations between HA gene and protein, namely E103K R130K T169I, I338V, N387S, S398I/L and I399S in HA. Because influenza virus uses different polymerase machineries for replication and transcription, these substitutions could be introduced in the viral genome through replication process but not in viral mRNA in the transcription. The results, for the first time, provided experimental evidence showing differences in AA sequence obtained from direct analysis of viral protein derived from viral genome.—Liu, N., Wang, G., Lee, K. C., Guan, Y., Chen, H., Cai, Z. Mutations in influenza virus replication and transcription: detection of amino acid substitutions in hemagglutinin of an avian influenza virus (H1N1).

https://openalex.org/W2002716872,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) persists as a life-long latent infection within memory B cells, but how EBV may circumvent the innate immune response within this virus reservoir is unclear. Recent studies suggest that the latency-associated non-coding RNAs of EBV may actually induce type I (antiviral) interferon production, raising the question of how EBV counters the negative consequences this is likely to have on viral persistence. We addressed this by examining the type I interferon response in Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cell lines, the only in vitro model of the restricted program of EBV latency-gene expression in persistently infected B cells in vivo. Importantly, we observed no effect of EBV on interferon alpha-induced signaling or evidence of type I interferon production, suggesting that EBV in this latent state is silent to the cell's innate antiviral surveillance. We did uncover, however, a defect in the negative feedback control of interferon signaling in a subpopulation of BL lines as was revealed by prolonged interferon-stimulated gene transcription consistent with sustained tyrosine phosphorylation on STAT1 and STAT2. This was due to inadequate induction of expression of the ubiquitin-specific protease UBP43, which removes the ubiquitin-like ISG15 polypeptide conjugated to proteins (ISGylation) in response to type I interferons. Results here are consistent with previous findings in genetically engineered Ubp43(-/-) murine cells that UBP43 down-regulates interferon signaling, independent of its ISG15 isopeptidase activity, by precluding the protein kinase JAK1 from the interferon receptor. This natural deficiency in UBP43 expression may therefore provide a useful model to further probe the biological roles of UBP43 and ISGylation."
