https://openalex.org/W1993719557,"Nucleolin is a 92 kd nucleolar protein implicated in regulating polymerase I transcription and binding of preribosomal RNA. Another abundant nucleolar protein of 38 kd (B23/No38) is thought to be involved in intranuclear packaging of preribosomal particles. Although both proteins have previously been detected only in nuclei, we conclude that they shuttle constantly between nucleus and cytoplasm. This conclusion is based on monitoring the equilibration of these proteins between nuclei present in interspecies heterokaryons, and on observing the antigen-mediated nuclear accumulation of cytoplasmically injected antibodies. Our unexpected results suggest a role for these major nucleolar proteins in the nucleocytoplasmic transport of ribosomal components. Moreover, they suggest that transient exposure of shuttling proteins to the cytoplasm may provide a mechanism for cytoplasmic regulation of nuclear activities."
https://openalex.org/W1532411911,Adult rat hepatocytes cultured in a collagen sandwich system maintained normal morphology and a physiological rate of albumin secretion for at least 42 days. Hepatocytes cultured on a single layer of collagen gel essentially ceased albumin secretion within 1 wk but could recover function with the overlay of a second layer of collagen gel. This culture configuration more closely mimics the hepatocytes' in vivo environment and provides a simple method for their long-term maintenance.
https://openalex.org/W1865508414,"The predominant protein in human semen, semenogelin, was characterized by lambda gt11 clones isolated from a seminal vesicular cDNA library. One clone, carrying a cDNA insert of 1606 nucleotides and a polyadenylated tail, coded for the entire semenogelin precursor. An open reading frame of 1386 nucleotides encodes a signal peptide and the mature protein of 439 amino acid residues, in which residues 85-136 are identical with a previously characterized semenogelin fragment. The polypeptide chain displays a most conspicuous region of internal sequence homology where 46 of the 58 amino acid residues at positions 259-316 are repeated at positions 319-376. An abundant seminal vesicular transcript of 1.8 kilobases (kb) codes for semenogelin. Two additional transcripts, one seminal vesicular 2.2-kb species and one epididymal 2.0-kb species, code for related proteins that have a close structural relationship as well as antigenic epitopes in common with semenogelin. Semenogelin and the semenogelin-related proteins are the major proteins involved in the gelatinous entrapment of ejaculated spermatozoa. Antigenic epitopes common to these proteins are localized to the parts of the spermatozoa involved in locomotion. The spermatozoa become progressively motile as the gel-forming proteins are fragmented by the kallikrein-like protease, prostate-specific antigen, and the gel dissolves."
https://openalex.org/W1590116013,"Abstract Oxidative DNA damage has been implicated in diverse biological processes including mutagenesis, carcinogenesis, aging, radiation effects, and chemotherapy. We examined the in vitro effect of low concentrations of Cu(II) or H2O2 alone and in combination on supercoiled plasmid DNA. As much as 10(-2) M Cu(II) or 10(-2) M H2O2 alone did not break the DNA. However, a mixture of 10(-6) M Cu(II) plus 10(-5) M H2O2 produced strand breaks and inactivated transforming ability. Strand breakage was proportional to incubation time, temperature, and Cu(II) and H2O2 concentrations. Abasic sites were not detected. Strand breakage was inhibited by metal chelators, catalase, and by high levels of free radical scavengers implying that Cu(II), Cu(I), H2O2, and .OH were involved in the reaction. The extent of DNA strand breakage was not affected by superoxide dismutase indicating that superoxide was not a major contributor to the DNA damage. DNA sequence analysis demonstrated that hot piperidine-sensitive DNA lesions were produced preferentially at sites of 2 or more adjacent guanosine residues. This sequence specificity was observed with Cu(II) plus H2O2 but not with Cu(I) alone. Polyguanosine sequence specificity for DNA damage induction appears to be unique among simple chemical systems. This reaction may be important in mechanisms of oxidative damage in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1577893399,"The purine nucleoside analog 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) is a selective inhibitor of transcription by RNA polymerase II. Although a wealth of in vivo studies have suggested that DRB inhibits transcription by enhancing the premature termination of elongating polymerase molecules, in vitro studies to date have been interpreted to suggest that DRB acts at the level of transcription initiation. We have analyzed the mechanism of DRB-mediated transcription inhibition in vitro both in HeLa whole cell extracts and in a partially purified transcription system. The results indicate that the extent to which DRB inhibits the synthesis of a RNA transcript is directly proportional to its length. For example, DRB was found to preferentially inhibit transcription in vitro of promoter-distal relative to promoter-proximal portions of the adenovirus major late transcription unit. A factor potentially involved in mediating this inhibitory effect is identified. We conclude that the mechanism of DRB inhibition of transcription in vivo and in vitro are similar."
https://openalex.org/W1538305637,"Abstract The complement anaphylatoxin peptide C5a is well known to activate human polymorphonuclear leukocytes through receptor-mediated processes. C5a has also been reported to activate eosinophils for both chemotaxis and hexose uptake. We characterized the receptor molecule for human C5a on human eosinophils and compared it with the receptor on human neutrophils. At 4 degrees C, uptake of 1 nM 125I-C5a reaches equilibrium within 10 min on both cell types. Binding of 125I-C5a occurs over a concentration range comparable to that which stimulates lysosomal enzyme release and hexose uptake in both cell types. Scatchard analyses of the data indicate the presence of two receptor populations on eosinophils; a high affinity receptor with 15,000-20,000 sites/cell and a Kd of 3.1 +/- 0.6 x 10(-11) M, and a low affinity receptor with approximately 375,000 sites/cell and a Kd of 1 x 10(-7) M. Parallel experiments with neutrophils indicate the presence of a single receptor population with approximately 90,000 sites/cell and a Kd of 4.8 +/- 0.1 x 10(-10)M. The eosinophil receptor molecule was further characterized by covalently cross-linking 125I-C5a to cells followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the solubilized material. Autoradiography indicates the presence of a dominant C5a-eosinophil receptor complex with an apparent mass of 60-65 kDa. The corresponding neutrophil-C5a receptor complex has an apparent mass of 50-52 kDa as observed by others. When the cross-linked 125I-C5a-receptor complex was treated with cyanogen bromide, different patterns were observed on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for neutrophils and eosinophils. Thus, human eosinophils have a receptor for C5a anaphylatoxin which appears to be distinct from the C5a receptor present on human neutrophils."
https://openalex.org/W1590865433,"Serotonin is actively transported into brush-border membrane vesicles isolated from normal human term placentas and an inward-directed NaCl gradient provides the driving force for this process. Uptake is negligible if Na+ is replaced by Li+, K+, Rb+, Cs+ or choline. The presence of Cl- seems necessary for the maximal activity of this Na+-dependent uptake system. Intravesicular K+ (20-40 mM) stimulates serotonin uptake, the stimulation being considerably greater at pH 7.5 than at pH 6.5. But, in the absence of K+, uptake at pH 6.5 was twice the uptake at pH 7.5. Unlabeled serotonin and dopamine inhibit the uptake of radiolabeled serotonin and the IC50 values are 70 nM and 20 microM, respectively. Histamine and 5-hydroxytryptophan do not significantly interact with the system (IC50 greater than 1 mM). Kinetic analysis reveals that serotonin uptake in these vesicles occurs via a single, saturable, high affinity system (Kt = 51 +/- 2 nM; Vmax = 6.4 +/- 0.1 pmol/mg of protein/15 s). The transporter is highly sensitive to inhibition by imipramine (IC50 = 32 nM) and desipramine (IC50 = 160 nM) but relatively insensitive to reserpine and hydralazine."
https://openalex.org/W1523182164,"Interaction of epidermal growth factor (EGF) with its specific receptor (EGFR) was explored in the intact rat small intestine and in highly purified isolated enterocyte membrane preparations. Despite the fact that the EGF ligand is known to be present at physiological concentrations within the intestinal cavity, no significant binding of the ligand to the brush border surface was observed. Instead, binding of EGF to the EGFR was confined to other membrane populations, and correlation of ligand interaction with the laterobasal membranes (LBM) was nearly perfect (p less than 0.001) across a special equilibrium gradient enriched in brush border and LBM but devoid of intracellular membranes. Specific binding to another minor population of intracellular membranes that migrated to a position less dense than typical endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi vesicles on equilibrium gradients was also observed. Immunocytochemical exposure of intestine to EGFR antibody confirmed the localization of the EGFR to LBM and intracellular membranes. As estimated from the intensity of the staining, there may be immunologically active but nonbinding receptor species in the intracellular membrane compartment. Thus, despite the secretion of EGF into the intestinal lumen, the growth and maturational effects of EGF probably result from a specific interaction between EGF and EGFR solely at the laterobasal surface of the enterocyte. The functional role of the intracellular membrane species of EGFR, which remains to be established, may involve a source of inactive receptor that can be rapidly recruited and transferred to the LBM surface under changing environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1484962109,"A membrane-bound neutral B-like enzyme was solubilized from human placental microvilli with 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) and purified to homogeneity by ion-exchange chromatography and affinity chromatography on arginine-Sepharose. It gave a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with an apparent Mr of 62,000 with or without reduction. The enzyme is a glycoprotein as shown by its high affinity for concanavalin A-Sepharose and reduction in mass to 47,600 daltons after chemical deglycosylation. It has a neutral pH optimum, is activated by CoCl2, and inhibited by o-phenanthroline, 2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethylthiopropanoic acid, or cadmium acetate, indicating it is a metallopeptidase. The enzyme cleaves arginine or lysine from the COOH terminus of synthetic peptides (e.g. Bz-Gly-Arg, Bz-Gly-Lys, Bz-Ala-Lys, dansyl-Ala-Arg, where Bz is benzoyl and dansyl is 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl) as well as from several biologically active substrates: dynorphin A(1-13), Met5-Arg6-enkephalin (Km = 46 microM, kcat = 934 min-1), bradykinin (Km = 16 microM, kcat = 147 min-1), Met5-Lys6-enkephalin (Km = 375 microM, kcat = 663 min-1), and Leu5-Arg6-enkephalin (Km = 63 microM, kcat = 106 min-1). Although the enzyme shares some properties with other B-like enzymes, it is structurally, catalytically, and immunologically distinct from pancreatic A or B, human plasma N, and H (enkephalin convertase). To denote that the enzyme is membrane-bound, and to distinguish it from other known carboxypeptidases, we propose the name carboxypeptidase M. Because of its localization on the plasma membrane and optimal activity at neutral pH, M could inactivate or modulate the activity of peptide hormones either before or after their interaction with plasma membrane receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1531103802,"Eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4F, a multiprotein cap binding complex, was isolated by m7 GTP-Sepharose affinity chromatography from rabbit reticulocytes incubated with [32P]orthophosphate. Following treatment of reticulocytes with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for 30 min, stimulation of phosphorylation of both the p25 and p220 subunits was observed (2.5-5-fold). Two variants were observed for p25 in the absence and presence of PMA when analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Only the more acidic of these was phosphorylated, with the level of phosphorylation increased upon PMA treatment. One main variant was observed for p220; following PMA stimulation, in addition to increased labeling of this variant, two more acidic phosphorylated variants were observed. Low levels of eIF-3 and -4B were associated with purified eIF-4F, and PMA treatment stimulated phosphorylation of eIF-3 (p170) by 2-4-fold and eIF-4B by 1.5-2.5 fold. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping of p25 phosphorylated in the absence or presence of PMA generated a single tryptic phosphopeptide, suggesting a single phosphorylation site. A more complex phosphopeptide map was observed with p220 subunit. The maps for both subunits contained the same phosphopeptides as those obtained when eIF-4F was phosphorylated in vitro by the Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase, indicating this protein kinase directly modulated eIF-4F in response to PMA."
https://openalex.org/W1520733676,"While it is well established that acidic pH in endosomes plays a critical role in mediating the orderly traffic of receptors and ligands during endocytosis, little is known about the bioenergetics or regulation of endosome acidification. Using highly enriched fractions of rat liver endosomes prepared by free flow electrophoresis and sucrose density gradient centrifugation, we have analyzed the mechanism of ATP-dependent acidification and ion permeability properties of the endosomal membrane. This procedure permitted the isolation of endosome fractions which were up to 200-fold enriched as indicated by the increased specific activity of ATP-dependent proton transport. Acidification was monitored using hepatocyte and total liver endosomes selectively labeled with pH-sensitive markers of receptor-mediated endocytosis (fluorescein isothiocyanate asialoorosomucoid) or fluid-phase endocytosis (fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran). In addition, changes in membrane potential accompanying ATP-dependent acidification were directly measured using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye Di-S-C3(5). Our results indicate that ATP-dependent acidification of liver endosomes is electrogenic, with proton transport being accompanied by the generation of an interior-positive membrane potential opposing further acidification. The membrane potential can be dissipated by the influx of permeant external anions or efflux of internal alkali cations. Replacement externally of permeable anions with less permeable anions (e.g. replacing Cl- with gluconate) diminished acidification, as did replacement internally of a more permeant cation K+ with less permeant species (such as Na+ or tetramethylammonium). ATP-dependent H+ transport was not coupled to any specific anion or cation, however. The endosomal membrane was found to be extremely permeable to protons, with protons able to leak out almost as fast as they are pumped in. Thus, the internal pH of endosomes is likely to reflect a dynamic equilibrium of protons regulated by the intrinsic ion permeabilities of the endosomal membrane, in addition to the activity of an ATP-driven proton pump."
https://openalex.org/W1480274265,"Abstract We have fractionated rat liver and identified a set of transcription factors that are essential for accurate initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. These factors were resolved into three distinct enzyme fractions. The factors in two of these fractions have been purified to apparent homogeneity. One fraction contains a single, 35-kDa transcription factor, designated alpha (Conaway, J. W., Bond, M. W., and Conaway, R. C. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 8293-8297). Here we show that the other fraction contains a transcription factor, designated beta gamma, with a native molecular mass of approximately 250 kDa. This factor is composed of 67 kDa (beta) and 31 kDa (gamma) polypeptides. Both the beta and gamma polypeptides are required for runoff transcription. Comparison of purified transcription factors alpha and beta gamma reveals that (i) both factors act at initiation and (ii) neither alpha nor beta gamma is required for assembly of an initial complex that commits the template to be transcribed by RNA polymerase II."
https://openalex.org/W1521741592,"Abstract Treatment of human platelets with 162 nM 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) resulted in phosphorylation of a number of peptides, including myosin heavy chain and the 20-kDa myosin light chain. The site phosphorylated on the myosin heavy chain was localized by two-dimensional peptide mapping to a serine residue(s) in a single major tryptic phosphopeptide. This phosphopeptide co-migrated with a tryptic peptide that was produced following in vitro phosphorylation of platelet myosin heavy chain using protein kinase C. The sites phosphorylated in the 20-kDa myosin light chain in intact cells were analyzed by two-dimensional mapping of tryptic peptides and found to correspond to Ser1 and Ser2 in the turkey gizzard myosin light chain. In vitro phosphorylation of purified human platelet myosin by protein kinase C showed that in addition to Ser1 and Ser2, a third site corresponding to Thr9 in turkey gizzard myosin light chain is also phosphorylated. The phosphorylatable myosin light chains from human platelets were found to consist of two major isoforms present in approximately equal amounts, but differing in their molecular weights and isoelectric points. A third, minor isoform was also visualized by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Following treatment with TPA, both the mono- and diphosphorylated forms of each isoform could be visualized, and the sites of phosphorylation were identified. The phosphate content rose from negligible amounts found prior to treatment with TPA to 1.2 mol of phosphate/mol of myosin light chain and 0.7 mol of phosphate/mol of myosin heavy chain following treatment. These results suggest that TPA mediates phosphorylation of both myosin light and heavy chains in intact platelets by activation of protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1599996251,"D-Amino acid aminotransferase was found in several thermophilic Bacillus species and purified to homogeneity from the best producer, Bacillus sp. YM-1, which was newly isolated from a sauna dust. The enzyme has a molecular weight of about 62,000 and consists of two subunits identical in molecular weight (30,000). It catalyzes transamination between various D-amino acids and alpha-keto acids, although the substrate specificity is narrower than the enzyme from the mesophile, Bacillus sphaericus (Yonaha, K., Misono, H., Yamamoto, T., and Soda, K. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 6983-6989). The Bacillus sp. YM-1 enzyme is most active at 60 degrees C and stable at high temperatures. Automated Edman degradation provided the N-terminal sequence of the first 20 amino acids, and carboxypeptidase Y digestion provided the C-terminal sequence of the last 3 amino acids. The amino acid sequence in the vicinity of the lysyl residue, Lys(Pxy), that binds pyridoxal 5'-phosphate was determined as Cys-Asp-Ile-Lys(Pxy)-Ser-Leu-Asn-Leu-Leu-Gly-Ala-Val-Leu-Ala-Lys- from the pyridoxyl peptide obtained by digestion with trypsin. The active site sequence is markedly different from those of L-amino acid aminotransferases and other pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1494806194,"The hepatic acute phase response is accompanied by increased levels of Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc alpha 2,6-sialyltransferase activity in liver and in circulation. Previous studies suggested that cytokines and glucocorticoids mediate the induction of this sialyltransferase activity. In this study the regulation of sialyltransferase expression by dexamethasone in H35 rat hepatoma cells is assessed by Northern hybridization and enzyme activity assays. Exposure of H35 cells to 1 microM dexamethasone for 24 h causes a 3-4-fold enrichment of sialyltransferase mRNA and a corresponding increase in enzymatic activity. The induction of sialyltransferase mRNA begins within 3 h of dexamethasone treatment and reaches a plateau within 24 h. Sialyltransferase mRNA induction is dose dependent; the minimum concentration of dexamethasone necessary for induction is 10(-8) M, and induction was maximal at 10(-6) M. Induction is sensitive to actinomycin D, suggesting that regulation may be exerted by altering the rate of mRNA synthesis. Puromycin and cycloheximide are ineffective in blocking induction, suggesting that de novo protein synthesis is not required for induction. Finally, dexamethasone alone is sufficient for maximum induction of sialyltransferase mRNA. In contrast, maximal induction of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, a well studied hepatic acute phase reactant, requires both dexamethasone and cytokines, implying that different pathways exist for the induction of participants in the acute phase response."
https://openalex.org/W1497894235,"Abstract The reaction of 6-electron reduced chicken liver xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) with molecular oxygen was studied using both stopped flow and steady-state turnover techniques at pH 7.8, 4 degrees C. Oxidation of fully reduced XDH proceeded via four phases, three of which were detected with the stopped flow spectrophotometer. The fastest phase was second order in oxygen (1900 M-1 s-1), resulted in the appearance of flavin semiquinone and yielded no superoxide. The next phase was also second order in oxygen (260 M-1 s-1), involved the loss of flavin semiquinone and yielded, on average, 1 mol of superoxide/mol of XDH oxidized. The last 2 electron equivalents were located in the iron-sulfur centers. They were released one equivalent at a time in the form of superoxide. Steady-state kinetics were found to be critically dependent on temperature and oxygen concentration. When these factors were carefully controlled, both the xanthine-oxygen and NADH-oxygen reductase reactions gave linear Lineweaver-Burk plots. The xanthine-oxygen data yielded a turnover number of 43 min-1, which was 42% of that for xanthine-NAD turnover. During turnover, with xanthine and O2, 40-44% of the electron equivalents introduced by xanthine appeared as superoxide. Reduced pyridine nucleotides, NAD and 3-aminopyridine adenine dinucleotide, dramatically reduced the formation of superoxide at levels which did not seriously inhibit oxygen reactivity."
https://openalex.org/W1513902446,"Profilaggrin consists of multiple filaggrin domains joined by linker segments which are removed during proteolytic conversion to filaggrin. Analysis of tryptic peptides of filaggrin defined a 26-residue linker segment when aligned on the amino acid sequence of one repeat unit of mouse profilaggrin deduced from a cDNA sequence (Rothnagel, J. A., Mehrel, T., Idler, W. W., Roop, D. R., and Steinert, P. M. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 15643–15648). Two types of linker segments were distinguished by their different susceptibility to thermolysin and by the presence of a Phe-Tyr-Pro-Val sequence in only one type. These data led to a model of profilaggrin in which the two types of linker segments alternate along the length of profilaggrin. This model provides a structural basis for the two stages of proteolytic processing seen in vivo. In the first stage intermediates accumulate which have several filaggrin domains still joined by linker segments lacking Phe-Tyr-Pro-Val. In the second stage, the other linker segments are cleaved and mature filaggrin domains are released. Proteolytic activity with specificity consistent with first stage cleavage was partially purified from rat epidermis. Chymostatin inhibited both the in vitro enzymatic activity and the processing of profilaggrin in a cultured rat keratinocyte cell line. The products formed in vitro were 3–5 kDa larger than intermediates produced in vivo, suggesting that the linker segments are cleaved at one end only. This implies the existence of a third protease which completes the removal of the linker segments."
https://openalex.org/W1539518310,"Mechanism-based destruction of cytochrome P-450 (P-450) and P-450 heme is observed during the oxidation of N-cyclopropyl and N-cyclobutyl benzylamines. The slower inactivation by the cyclobutylamines relative to cyclopropylamines is consistent with known relative rates of ring opening of cycloalkyl-substituted aminium radicals. Evidence was found that porphyrin meso adducts of the type reported for horseradish peroxidase and cyclopropanone hydrate (Wiseman, J. S., Nichols, J. S., and Kolpak, M. X. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 6328-6332) were not formed. Radiolabels from cyclopropylamine substrates were covalently attached to protein but essentially only from the cyclopropyl portion and not the benzylic portion. Neither label appeared to be bound to extractable heme; however, during oxidations with cyclopropylamines, labeled P-450 heme became covalently attached to protein. Oxidation of 1-phenylcyclobutylamine by P-450 yielded 2-phenyl-1-pyrroline and 2-phenylpyrrolidine, and the ring expansion is interpreted as evidence for the existence of aminium radicals based on precedents with monoamine oxidase (Silverman, R. B., and Zieske, P. A. (1985) Biochemistry 24, 2128-2138). In addition, purified P-450PB-B oxidized N-(1-phenylcyclobutyl)-benzylamine to N-(1-phenyl)cyclobutyl phenyl nitrone, identified using spectral techniques. This transformation involves two sequential oxidations with either a hydroxylamine or benzylidene intermediate. While P-450 oxidized the amine to both compounds, only the hydroxylamine was rapidly oxidized to give the nitrone. The ring expansion and nitrone products are interpreted in the context of aminium radical intermediates involved in the mechanism of P-450-catalyzed amine oxidation."
https://openalex.org/W1479893041,"Three distinctive heparin-binding sites were observed in type IV collagen by the use of rotary shadowing: in the NC1 domain and at distances 100 and 300 nm from the NC1 domain. Scatchard analysis indicated different affinities for these sites. Electron microscopic analysis of heparin-type IV collagen interaction with increasing salt concentrations showed the different affinities to be NC1 greater than 100 nm greater than 300 nm. The NC1 domain bound specifically to chondroitin/dermatan sulfate side chains as well. This binding was observed at the electron microscope and in solid-phase binding assays (where chondroitin sulfate could compete for the binding of [3H]heparin to NC1-coated substrata). The triple helix-rich, rod-like domain of type IV collagen did not bind to chondroitin/dermatan sulfate side chains. In solid-phase binding assays only heparin could compete for the binding of [3H]heparin to this domain. In order to more precisely map potential heparin-binding sites in type IV collagen, we chemically synthesized 17 arginine- and lysine-containing peptides from the alpha 1(IV) and alpha 2(IV) chains. Three peptides from the known sequence of the alpha 1(IV) and alpha 2(IV) chains were shown to specifically bind heparin: peptide Hep-I (TAGSCLRKFSTM), from the alpha 1(NC1) chain, peptide Hep-II (LAGSCLARFSTM), a peptide corresponding to the same sequence in peptide Hep-I from the alpha 2 (NC1) chain, and peptide Hep-III (GEFYFDLRLKGDK) which contained an interruption of the triple helical sequence of the alpha 1(IV) chain at about 300 nm from the NC1 domain, were demonstrated to bind heparin in solid-phase binding assays and compete for the binding of [3H]heparin to type IV collagen-coated substrata. Therefore, each of these peptides may represent a potential heparin-binding site in type IV collagen. The mapping of the binding of heparin or related structures, such as heparan sulfate proteoglycan, to specific sequences of type IV collagen could help the understanding of several structural and functional properties of this basement membrane protein as well as interactions with other basement membrane and/or cell surface-associated macromolecules."
https://openalex.org/W1577005712,"We report a functional analysis of the human thymidine kinase (tk) gene promoter. We have linked the tk promoter to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene to allow direct measurement of promoter strength by assaying chloramphenicol acetyltransferase enzyme activity after transfection into mouse L cells. Putative transcription elements have been identified by deletion and mutation analysis of this promoter. The promoter relies primarily on two elements and a series of elements found farther upstream. Two-thirds of promoter activity is maintained by a construct containing 139 base pairs of sequence upstream of the initiation of transcription that contains only one GC and one of the CCAAT elements. In addition, an evolutionary comparison identifies two highly conserved promoter elements: the -40 CCAAT element and a TATA element located at -21. We have further characterized both CCAAT elements using a mutational as well as protein binding analysis. From this study we have determined that both the -70 and -40 CCAAT elements bind strongly to the same factor, with a slightly higher affinity for the -40 CCAAT. Competition studies suggest that the CCAAT factor that binds to this promoter is homologous to protein nuclear factor Y, which binds to the major histocompatibility complex class II E alpha gene promoter. In addition, either CCAAT element is capable of supplying almost as much promoter strength as is supplied in the presence of both."
https://openalex.org/W1595234089,"Abstract Genomic clones containing the rat pyruvate kinase M gene, which encodes the M1- and M2-type isozymes, were isolated and their exon sequences were determined. This gene contains 12 exons and 11 introns and is 20 kilobases (kb) long. The sequences specific to the M1- and M2-types exist in exons 9 and 10, respectively (Noguchi, T., Inoue, H., and Tanaka, T. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 13807-13812). The seventh intron begins with the GC dinucleotide instead of the consensus GT dinucleotide, but other exon-intron boundaries are consistent with the GT-AG rule. S1 mapping analysis showed that M1- and M2-type mRNAs had multiple, but the same transcription initiation sites. Thus, the M1- and M2-type isozyme mRNAs are concluded to be produced from the same M gene transcript by alternative RNA splicing. RNA blot hybridization analysis indicated that developmental changes of the isozymes in brain and skeletal muscle were regulated at the level of RNA splicing. The 5'-flanking region of the gene has no TATA box or CAAT box, but contains potential Sp1 binding sites. Bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay revealed that a fragment of about 0.5 kb of the 5'-flanking region of the gene was sufficient for promotor activity in the rat hepatoma cell line, dRLh-84. This activity was not present in adult rat hepatocytes, indicating that the 0.5-kb fragment has tissue-specific promoter activity. A processed-type pseudogene that resembles the M2-type pyruvate kinase cDNA was also characterized."
https://openalex.org/W1517674957,"Abstract We have further distinguished the structures and roles of the two lipoyl-bearing components of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, the dihydrolipoyl transacetylase (E2) component and the component designated as protein X. The amino acid sequences of the NH2-terminal regions of the lipoyl-bearing domain of the E2 component and protein X are different but related. The dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3) component but not the pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) component protected protein X against proteolytic degradation by trypsin and protease Arg C. Protein X-specific polyclonal antibodies inhibit reconstitution of the overall reaction catalyzed by the complex (E2-X subcomplex recombined with the E1 and E3 components). The rate of development of this inhibition was reduced by pretreatment of E2-X subcomplex with the E3 component. These data strongly suggest the E3 component associates with protein X. The E1 component (an alpha 2 beta 2 tetramer), but not the E3 component, reduced trypsin cleavage of E2 subunits at 4 degrees C and altered the patterns of cleavage at 22 degrees C. At 22 degrees C a large (Mr congruent to 49,000) outer domain (E2LB) of the E2 component was produced. E2LB had the same NH2-terminal amino acid sequence as the smaller (Mr congruent to 38,000) lipoyl-bearing domain (E2L). E2LB, in contrast to E2L, interacted with both the E1 component and the beta subunit of the E1 component. Thus the E1 component is bound through an E1-binding domain that is located in E2 subunits between the inner domain and the outer, lipoyl-bearing domain."
https://openalex.org/W1521841005,"Abstract The size of low density lipoproteins (LDL) is strongly correlated with LDL cholesteryl ester (CE) content and coronary artery atherosclerosis in monkeys fed cholesterol and saturated fat. African green monkeys fed 11% (weight) fish oil diets have smaller LDL and less CE per LDL particle than lard-fed animals. We hypothesized that this might be due to a lower plasma lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity in fish oil-fed animals. Using recombinant particles made of egg yolk lecithin-[14C]cholesterol-apoA-I as exogenous substrate, we found no difference in plasma LCAT activity (27 versus 28 nmol CE formed per h/ml) of fish oil- versus lard-fed animals, respectively; furthermore, no diet-induced difference in immunodetectable LCAT was found. However, plasma phospholipids from fish oil-fed animals were over 4-fold enriched in n-3 fatty acids in the sn-2 position compared to those of lard-fed animals. Additionally, the proportion of n-3 fatty acid-containing CE products formed by LCAT, relative to the available n-3 fatty acid in the sn-2 position of phospholipids, was less than one-tenth of that for linoleic acid. The overall rate of LCAT-catalyzed CE formation with phospholipid substrates from fish oil-fed animals was lower (5-50%) than with phospholipid substrates from lard-fed animals. These data show that n-3 fatty acids in phospholipids are not readily utilized by LCAT for formation of CE; rather, LCAT preferentially utilizes linoleic acid for CE formation. The amount of linoleic acid in the sn-2 position of plasma phospholipids is reduced and replaced with n-3 fatty acids in fish oil-fed animals. As a result, LCAT-catalyzed plasma CE formation in vivo is likely reduced in fish oil-fed animals contributing to the decreased cholesteryl ester content and smaller size of LDL particles in the animals of this diet group."
https://openalex.org/W1518599323,"Abstract It has previously been demonstrated that nuclear factor I (NF I) or a related protein binds to a region between -315 and -295 from the start of transcription in the mouse alpha 2(I) collagen gene promoter. In the present work we have purified this factor to homogeneity from rat liver. DNA sequence-specific proteins were isolated from nuclear extracts using heparin-agarose affinity chromatography and two successive chromatographies on a recognition site affinity matrix. Approximately 160 micrograms of the DNA binding proteins was obtained from 100 g of rat liver. More than 1700-fold purification over the nuclear extract and 58% recovery of the DNA binding activity was achieved. The purified preparation contained five to six protein components ranging in molecular weight from 30,000 to 35,000, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It was demonstrated using DNase I footprint analysis that the factor binds to the putative NF I binding site in the mouse alpha 2(I) collagen promoter. It has a dissociation constant of 7 nM for a short DNA fragment containing this binding site, while a constant of 0.45 nM was obtained for a similar-sized fragment containing the nuclear NF I consensus binding sequence. The purified factor is identical to histone H1 in several respects. They share similar amino acid compositions and they give similar V8-protease and N-bromosuccinimide peptides. In addition, antibodies raised to bovine histone H1 recognize the purified factor and interfere with its binding to DNA. Methylation interference and preparative gel shift assay show that histone H1 binds to the specific sequence from the preparation of the alpha 2(I) collagen promoter binding factor. It is thus evident from the present results, that histone H1 binds to the NF I recognition sequence in the mouse alpha 2(I) collagen promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1529318257,"The biosynthesis and processing of the human mannose receptor has been studied in monocyte-derived macrophages. Adherent cells were labeled for 60 min with Trans35S (a mixture of 35S-labeled methionine and cysteine), chased, and subjected to immunoprecipitation by antibody raised against the human placental receptor. The antibody immunoprecipitated a single protein of molecular mass 162 kDa; precipitation of the labeled receptor could be inhibited by placental receptor. The results presented demonstrate that the receptor is synthesized as a 154-kDa precursor which is processed to 162 kDa in 90 min. The precursor is a glycoprotein bearing endoglycosidase H-sensitive oligosaccharides; the 162-kDa form is endoglycosidase H-resistant but peptide:N-glycanase-sensitive. Desialylation of the mannose receptor with neuraminidase generates a protein which is recognized by peanut agglutinin, a lectin that specifically binds desialylated O-linked oligosaccharides. Thus, the human macrophage mannose receptor bears both N- and O-linked oligosaccharide chains. Newly synthesized mannose receptor exhibits a half-life of 33 h as determined by pulse-chase studies. This indicates that on the average, each molecule of receptor recycles between the cell surface and endosomes hundreds of times before degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1529482655,"Calspermin is a heat-stable, acidic calmodulin-binding protein predominantly found in mammalian testis. The cDNA representing the rat form of this protein has been cloned from a rat testis λgt11 library. Sequence analysis of two overlapping clones revealed a 232-nucleotide 5′-nontranslated region, 510 nucleotides of open reading frame, a 148-nucleotide 3′-untranslated region, and a poly(A) tail. Authenticity of the clones was confirmed by comparison of a portion of the deduced amino acid sequence with the sequence of a tryptic peptide obtained from the rat testis protein. The λgt11 fusion protein was recognized by affinity purified antibodies to pig testis calspermin and bound 125I-calmodulin in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Calspermin cDNA encodes a 169-residue protein with a calculated Mr of 18,735. The putative calmodulin-binding domain is very close to the amino terminus of the protein. This region shows 46% identity with the calmodulin-binding region of rat brain Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and 32% identity with the equivalent region of chicken smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase. The 5′-nontranslated region reveals significant homology with a portion of the catalytic region of the calmodulin-dependent protein kinase family. Calspermin contains a stretch of 17 contiguous glutamic acid residues in the central region of the molecule. Computer analysis predicts calspermin to be 81% α-helix and 14% random coil. Analysis of genomic DNA indicates calspermin to be the product of a unique gene. Northern blot analysis of rat testis RNA reveals a 1.1-kilobase mRNA. This RNA is restricted to testis among several rat tissues examined and could not be identified in total RNA isolated from testes of other mammals. Analysis of cells isolated from rat testis reveals calspermin mRNA to be predominantly expressed in postmeiotic cells indicating that it may be specific to haploid cells."
https://openalex.org/W1500332671,"Transcription factor IIIA (TFIIIA) was purified from cytoplasmic extracts of HeLa cells by developing a simple and efficient procedure employing phosphocellulose under widely differing ionic conditions followed by affinity chromatography on immobilized human 5 S genes. This procedure yielded a fraction containing human TFIIIA activity and a protein of 35 kDa as its major component. Moreover, we succeeded in renaturing the activity of human transcription factor IIIA (hTFIIIA) isolated after preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and in identifying a polypeptide of 35 kDa with the transcription activity. This value differs from that reported for Xenopus TFIIIA. It could be demonstrated by footprinting analyses that hTFIIIA specifically binds to the internal control region of the human 5 S rRNA gene. The limits of protection slightly differ at the 3′ border of the internal control region from those imprinted by Xenopus TFIIIA on the same gene. Comparative footprint analyses of hTFIIIA on the human and frog somatic 5 S rRNA gene, measured in titration, competition, and salt-stability experiments, demonstrated a higher affinity of the human factor to the homologous gene. These results, together with the difference in molecular mass of these functionally analogous proteins, reemphasize the importance of homologous systems for the analysis of mechanisms involved in gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1584201247,"Adipsin expression at the protein and mRNA levels is greatly reduced in several distinct syndromes of obesity in the mouse: genetic obesity due to the db/db and ob/ob genes, and a chemically induced model secondary to neonatal exposure to monosodium glutamate. We considered first the possibility that the adipsin gene might be identical to the db or ob locus and the lowered expression of this protein might result from a mutation in this gene. We show here that the adipsin structural gene is located on chromosome 10 and hence is physically distinct from any obesity genes so far identified in the mouse. A major role for the adrenal gland and adrenal glucocorticoids in the aberrant regulation of adipsin in these models of obesity is indicated by several experiments. Adrenalectomy of the ob/ob mouse raises the circulating levels of adipsin protein and the amount of this mRNA in epididymal fat pads (5-fold), although neither is increased to the levels seen in lean controls. Exogenous administration of corticosterone completely blocks the effects of adrenalectomy on adipsin, suggesting that the effect of this endocrine ablation is through reduction of adrenal glucocorticoids. Corticosterone administration also causes suppression in the levels of adipsin mRNA and protein in lean mice, although this decrease is never as severe as that seen in obese mice. The effect of exogenous corticosterone in lean mice occurs within 2 days and hence is not secondary to the obesity which these hormones eventually elicit. These results indicate that glucocorticoids can regulate adipsin expression in vivo and strongly suggest that the hyperglucocorticoid state seen in certain obese models plays a significant role in lowering adipsin mRNA and protein levels. Quantitative analysis of these experiments suggests that other as yet unknown neuroendocrine factors also function to suppress adipsin in obesity."
https://openalex.org/W1575847274,"The purified estrogen receptor (ER) whether in 9 or 5 S molecular form, binds more than one molecule of the monoclonal antibody JS 34/32 (Redeuilh, G., Moncharmont, B., Secco, C., and Baulieu, E.-E. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 6969-6975). We now have investigated the effects of controlled trypsin proteolysis and of a dissociating chaotropic salt (NaSCN) on the structure of the estrogen receptor covalently labeled with radioactive tamoxifen aziridine. When the DNA-binding transformed 5S ER was dialyzed against a buffer containing 0.5 M NaSCN, it was converted into a form sedimenting at 3.7 S +/- 0.1 (n = 3). It reverted to the 5 S molecular form when NaSCN was dialyzed away. Fluorographic analysis of both the 5 and 3.7 S ER following SDS-gel electrophoresis revealed one main band corresponding to Mr congruent to 66,000. After limited trypsin treatment of the 5 S ER, tamoxifen aziridine-binding protein sedimented at 4.3 S +/- 0.1 (n = 5), had a Stokes radius of 3.6 nm (calculated Mr = 65,000), and did not bind DNA. The same form was obtained after limited trypsin digestion of the ER bound to DNA-cellulose or to hsp 90 (the nontransformed 8-9 S ER molecular form). This 4.3 S trypsinized ER was reversibly dissociated by NaSCN into a congruent to 3 S +/- 0.1 (n = 3) molecular form. Fluorographic analysis of both the 4.3 and 3 S ER after SDS-gel electrophoresis showed one main radioactive band of Mr congruent to 30,000. Taken together our results suggest that 1) the 5 S ER is a homodimer of two Mr congruent to 66,000 hormone binding subunits which may be released as such from the nontransformed 8-9 S ER, 2) the trypsin digestion products yield two carboxyl-terminal fragments of Mr congruent to 30,000 that remain in the form of a dimer having lost their DNA-binding region, and 3) the trypsin cleavage would occur within the region located between the hormone-binding domain and the DNA-binding domain. These data indicate that the dimerization of the receptor occurs through hydrophobic interaction of its hormone-binding domain but cannot exclude that other part(s) of the receptor may also contribute to the dimer formation. The dimerization may be critically involved in the mechanism by which estradiol-receptor complexes promote change of gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1546321009,"Abstract Lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) is a plasma enzyme which catalyzes the transacylation of the sn-2-fatty acid of lecithin to cholesterol, forming lysolecithin and cholesteryl ester. We have recently proposed a covalent catalytic mechanism for LCAT in which lecithin cleavage proceeds via the formation of a transition state tetrahedral adduct between the oxygen atom of the catalytic serine residue and the sn-2-carbonyl carbon atom of the substrate (Jauhiainen, M., Ridgway, N.D., and Dolphin, P.J. (1987) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 918, 175-188). This proposal is evaluated here by use of nonhydrolyzable sn-2-difluoroketone phosphatidylcholine analogues, known to inhibit calcium-dependent phospholipase A2. These compounds inhibited the calcium-independent phospholipase A2 activity of LCAT in a time and concentration dependent manner. The most potent analogues had a 100-fold higher affinity for the enzyme than the substrate, lecithin, when present within lecithin/apoA-I proteoliposomes. The inhibition was dependent upon the presence of a difluoromethylene group alpha to the sn-2-carbonyl carbon of the analogues. The inhibition is attributed to the formation of a tetrahedral adduct between the catalytic serine residue of LCAT and the sn-2-carbonyl carbon atom of the analogues which is stabilized by the electronegative fluorine atoms present upon the carbon atom alpha to the carbonyl carbon. This adduct mimics that proposed by us to occur during lecithin cleavage by LCAT, and the data substantiate the existence of this transition state adduct prior to the release of lysolecithin and formation of a fatty acylserine oxyester of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2135997035,"The genesis of the positive bands in the far-ultraviolet circular dichroic spectra of human plasma fibronectin and its 31-kDa NH2-terminal heparin-binding fragment was studied. Spectra of ester derivatives of tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine and of model mixtures of these derivatives in which they are present in the same ratios as in the proteins indicate that all the aromatic side chains make substantial contributions to composite positive bands with maxima several nanometers below those of the proteins. In the presence of solvent perturbants such as polyethylene glycol and ethylene glycol, the bands of the model mixtures are red-shifted to the approximate positions they have in the spectra of the proteins. No additional red shift is seen with solvent perturbation of the proteins, suggesting that the conditions leading to this effect are satisfied within the proteins. A separate effect of solvent perturbation, an increase in amplitude of the positive band, occurs equally in solutions of free aromatic amino acid derivatives and in the proteins. This effect is used to estimate the relative accessibility of the chromophores of fibronectin and its fragment to different perturbants. The possible influence of protein secondary structure on the amplitude of the positive circular dichroic band is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1511451589,"Abstract Modulation of calf uterine progesterone receptor (PR), in relation to its binding to synthetic steroids with known agonist (R5020) and antagonist (RU486) properties, was studied in the presence of iodoacetamide (IA), N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), beta-mercaptoethanol (MER), and dithiothreitol (DTT). Pretreatment of uterine cytosol at 4 degrees C with NEM (4-10 mM) reduced the binding of [3H]RU486 to PR by 40%, but [3H] R5020 binding was completely abolished. Whereas IA (2-10 mM) treatment did not affect [3H]RU486 binding, [3H]R5020 binding was totally eliminated. DTT or MER increased the binding of both steroids slightly (15%). [3H]R5020- or [3H]RU486-receptor complexes (Rc) migrated in the 8 S region and were eliminated upon pretreatment with NEM. At 23 degrees C, DTT increased the amount of 4 S [3H]R5020-Rc, but had no effect on the [3H]RU486-Rc. In the control, [3H]RU486 binding to the 8 S PR could be competed with radioinert R5020 or RU486, but R5020 failed to compete in the presence of IA. The heat-treated [3H]R5020- and [3H]RU486-Rc showed reduced binding to DNA-cellulose in the presence of NEM and IA. The results of our study suggest that SH group modifications differentially influence the properties of mammalian PR complexed with either R5020 or RU486. In the presence of IA, the [3H]RU486-Rc remained in the 8 S form when incubated at 23 degrees C, indicating that RU486 binding causes conformational changes in PR which are distinct from those that result upon R5020 binding."
https://openalex.org/W1621796013,"Abstract The binding of high mobility group (HMG) protein 17 to the nucleosome core particle has been studied in D2O solution using 1H NMR at 500 MHz. Spectra were obtained for purified HMG 17, purified nucleosome core particles, and the reconstituted HMG 17-nucleosome core particle complex at 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 M NaCl. Subtraction of the core particle spectra from spectra of the core particle reconstituted with HMG 17 demonstrated those regions of HMG 17 which interact with the nucleosome at different ionic strengths; the resonance peaks of interacting groups are broadened due to their restricted mobility. At 0.1 M NaCl, the mobility of all the amino acid side chains of HMG 17 was restricted, indicating complete binding of HMG 17 to the much larger nucleosome core particle. At 0.2 M NaCl most of the amino acids were free with the exception of arginine and proline which are confined to or predominant in the basic central region of HMG 17. These amino acids were completely free only at 0.4 M NaCl. We conclude that the entire HMG 17 molecule interacts with the nucleosome core particle at physiological ionic strength. The acidic COOH-terminal region of HMG 17 is released from interaction with the core histones at an NaCl concentration between 0.1 and 0.2 M and so binds weakly at physiological ionic strength. The basic central region binds more strongly to the core particle DNA, being completely released only at much higher ionic strength, between 0.3 and 0.4 M NaCl."
https://openalex.org/W1574665356,"Abstract Two mRNAs for P-450PB-1 and P-450PB-1(ps) are about 2 kilobase pairs long and have identical sequences with each other except for one short region of high variability (Kimura, H., Yoshioka, H., Sogawa, K., Sakai, Y., and Fujii-Kuriyama, Y. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 701-707). To clarify the origin of the short replacement block between the two mRNAs, we isolated several genomic clones containing relevant gene sequences. Sequence analysis of these genomic clones revealed that the two short segments specific for the two mRNAs are tandemly arranged in a genomic sequence and form exonic sequences equipped with AG and GT sequences on their 5' and 3' ends, respectively, and the putative consensus sequences for the lariat formation. The two short sequences lie between the two exonic sequences coding for the common part of the two mRNAs. Taken together with the structure of the related P-450(M-1) gene (Morishima, N., Yoshioka, H., Higashi, Y., Sogawa, K., and Fujii-Kuriyama, Y. (1987) Biochemistry 26, 8279-8285), all these results clearly demonstrate that the two mRNAs are generated from a single gene by alternative splicing at the eighth exons. The synthesis of the two mRNAs is regulated temporally in livers of male and female rats and brains of the female animals. One of the two mRNAs codes for a monooxygenase of P-450PB-1, and the other (P-450PB-1(ps) mRNA) lacks the sequence coding for the heme-binding site conserved among all species of P-450 molecules, and, therefore, it cannot function as a monooxygenase. The immunoblot analysis using an antibody specific for the 15-mer peptide uniquely encoded by P-450PB-1(ps) mRNA shows that the P-450PB-1(ps) peptide is synthesized at least in rat livers of both sexes in temporally regulated manners and is bound to the microsomal membranes. The function of this peptide remains to be seen."
https://openalex.org/W1592652234,"Conjugation of ubiquitin to certain proteins can trigger their degradation in the in vitro reticulocyte system. In order to determine whether ubiquitin conjugation serves as an intermediate step in the turnover of cellular proteins in vivo, it is necessary to isolate proteolytic intermediates, i.e. ubiquitin-protein adducts of specific cellular proteins. While the steady-state level of conjugates of rapidly turning over proteins is relatively high, that of long-lived proteins is presumably extremely low, and therefore undetectable. Therefore, mutant cell lines with conditionally altered function(s) of the ubiquitin system can serve as powerful tools in studying the degradation of stable cellular proteins. We have characterized a temperature sensitive cell cycle arrest mutant cell (ts85) with a thermolabile ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1; Finley, D., Ciechanover, A., and Varshavsky, A. (1984) Cell 37, 43–55). Following incubation at the restrictive temperature (39.5 °C), these cells fail to degrade short-lived proteins (Ciechanover, A., Finley, D., and Varshavsky, A. (1984) Cell 37, 57–66). However, involvement of the ubiquitin system in the turnover of long-lived proteins has not been addressed in these cells. A slow rate of inactivation of E1 in vivo, and significant rate of cell death following long incubation periods at the restrictive temperature, make this question difficult to address experimentally. In the present study we show that incubation of the cells for 1 h at 43 °C leads to rapid inactivation of ubiquitin conjugation in the intact mutant cell. Following heat treatment, the cells can be incubated at 39.5 °C for at least 6 h in order to study the possible involvement of the system in the turnover of long-lived cellular proteins. The viability of the cells is excellent at the end of the incubation. Following extraction, we have shown that inactivation occurs much more rapidly in the cell lysate in vitro than in the intact cell (t½ of 10 min compared to 4 h at 39.5 °C). The enzyme from both the mutant cell and the wild-type cell was purified to homogeneity. The molecular mass of the native enzyme from both cells is approximately 220 kDa with a subunit molecular mass of about 108 kDa. The structure of the enzyme is therefore very similar to that purified from rabbit reticulocytes. At the permissive temperature, the enzymes from both cells catalyze ATP-PPi and ATP-AMP exchange in similar kinetics. However, at the high temperature, the mutated enzyme is at least 7-fold less stable than the wild-type enzyme. Independent assay of the activity of each of the two active sites demonstrates that both sites of the mutated enzyme are similarly affected at the restrictive temperature"

High-to-low spin transitions of the heme iron occur for hemoglobin, myoglobin, and Glycera hemoglobin at 0.35, 0.75, and 0.50 GPa, respectively, for the deoxy species. These interspecies differences result from variations in the composition of the hemepockets and/or their rigidity to pressure-induced volume changes. Heme active sites initially bound to CO or O2 exhibit distinctive behavior at high pressures. For all proteins studied, O2 apparently dissociates from the heme at only moderately high pressure, while CO remains bound to the heme moiety even at extreme pressures. The Raman spectra demonstrate the differences in the ligated and deoxy species at 3.4 GPa in the high frequency region. Discrete changes (i.e. iron spin-state transitions and dissociation of O2) occur that are commensurate with the collapse of the distal pocket, while continuous shifts in the absorption and Raman spectra are observed at pressures above those required for pocket collapse."

EPF was purified six million-fold from the serum of pregnant women between 5 and 12 weeks of gestation. The specific activity of purified EPF was approximately 8 × 108 units/mg. The purification scheme involved sequential DEAE-cellulose chromatography, S-Sepharose chromatography, concanavalin A-Sepharose chromatography, heparin-Sepharose chromatography, Mono S fast protein liquid chromatography, and preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified protein has an apparent molecular weight of 21,500 as analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 28,000 by gel permeation high pressure liquid chromatography. The isoelectric point of purified EPF moiety is 6.5. The biological activity was susceptible to the proteolytic enzyme trypsin, acidic pH conditions, organic solvents, and sodium dodecyl sulfate, but stable to heat treatment at 56 ° C for 30 min and the reducing agent dithiothreitol.

However, its mechanism of action is unknown. We investigated the possibility that danazol affects cell membranes directly. Red cell osmotic fragility was studied in patients receiving danazol. A significant decrease in osmotic fragility was observed. Accompanying the change, peripheral blood smears showed many target cells and electron microscopy revealed extra folds in erythrocyte membranes. Twenty-two patients were studied prospectively before and after danazol. Osmotic fragility decreased significantly (P < 0.001) in 1 month of therapy and progressed with further treatment. A rebound increase (P < 0.01) was observed in 1 month after discontinuation of danazol among 16 patients. Incubation experiments showed that danazol-induced changes are not reversed with normal sera. Patient sera did not induce the changes in normal red cells. Danazol in vitro protected red cells from osmotic lysis at low concentrations but enhanced lysis at high concentrations. We suggest that danazol alters red cell membranes directly to increase their surface area, inducing target cell formation and increasing their resistance to osmotic lysis.—Ahn, Y. S.; Kim, C.

https://openalex.org/W1509380365,"Abstract The purification and partial characterization of epitectin (previously called Ca antigen) from a human cancer cell line is described. This glycoprotein, which is expressed on a wide range of human tumors and certain specialized normal epithelia, can be detected using monoclonal antibodies, Ca1, Ca2, and Ca3. The purified glycoprotein had a high density (1.40 g/ml) on isopycnic centrifugation indicating a high carbohydrate content. The molecular mass of epitectin as determined by size-exclusion chromatography ranged from 1.0 to 1.5 x 10(6) daltons. However, the purified epitectin gave two bands of apparent molecular weight 390,000 and 350,000 on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The isoelectric points of epitectin and asialoepitectin were found to be 5.3-5.4 and 6.8, respectively. The oligosaccharides were isolated from metabolically labeled epitectin by alkaline borohydride treatment and their structures established based on high performance liquid chromatography and paper electrophoretic migration, sugar composition, the results of sequential exoglycosidase treatment, periodate oxidation, and methylation analysis. The structures of the three major fractions, which together account for about 80% of the radioactivity, were assigned as NeuNAc alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----(NeuNAc alpha 2----6)3GalNAc(OH), NeuNAc alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----3GalNAc(OH), and Gal beta 1----3 GalNAc(OH).

https://openalex.org/W1500119933,"The origin of low frequency methyl resonances which appear in the spin-echo 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of incubated blood cell lysates was investigated by several techniques including 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, electrophoresis, high performance liquid chromatography, gel filtration, and amino acid analysis. These resonances were identified as arising from methyl moieties of leucine and valine. Other peaks which also appeared in the spectra of incubated blood cell lysates were assigned to methyl groups of alanine and threonine. The free amino acids are products of neutral proteases located on the leukocyte membrane or able to act on the extracellular medium. Since more than one enzyme appears to be implicated, it is possible that both membrane and granule proteases take part in the hydrolysis. Comparison of rates of product formation in white cell lysates incubated with human serum albumin, and with red cell lysate, suggests that erythrocyte peptidases also contribute to proteolysis in the latter case."
https://openalex.org/W1520496704,"Abstract The differential transcription of the cloned mouse metallothionein-I (MT-I) gene in tissues was studied in unfractionated and fractionated nuclear extracts from rat liver and brain. MT-I gene transcription was 10-fold greater in liver nuclear extract than in brain nuclear extract, whereas the level of transcription of the histone H4 gene was almost identical in both tissue extracts. 5' Deletion analysis of upstream sequences revealed that a 106-base pair (bp) region located between the -148- and -42-bp positions with respect to the transcription start site was responsible for the higher level of expression of the MT-I gene in the liver. Preincubation of the liver extract with the 106-bp fragment resulted in a significant decrease in MT-I gene transcription in the liver extract. In contrast, MT-I gene transcription in the brain nuclear extract was not altered by preincubation with the 106-bp upstream sequence. Mixing liver and brain extract did not diminish MT-I gene transcription normally occurring in liver nuclear extract. Preincubation of brain nuclear extract with the MT-I gene had no inhibitory effect on transcription of MT-I gene in liver nuclear extract. These studies suggest that neither an inhibitor nor a negative trans-acting factor in the brain is responsible for the differential transcription of MT-I gene; rather a positive regulatory factor(s) in the liver which interacts with the 106-bp upstream region contributes to the higher level of MT-I gene expression in this tissue."

Following irradiation, DNA damage products were measured, yielding the following findings: 1) the rate of formation of thymine-thymine and thymine-cytosine cyclobutane dimers and the bipyrimidine photoadduct 6-4'-[pyrimidine-2'-one]thymine were reduced at high intensity by about 2-fold and 2) extensive release of free thymine and thymine decomposition fragments occurred at high intensity, but not at low intensity. The effects of high intensity UV are due to promotion of low-lying excited state(s) by absorption of a second photon, producing higher excited state(s) with consequent ionization and base loss. Possible excited state intermediates in this process are the lowest triplet state of DNA bases and prolonged singlet states associated with excimer formation. The depletion of these excited states via promotion may be the cause of the diminished yield of bimolecular pyrimidine photoproducts, suggesting that these photoproducts are formed at low UV intensity in part from long-lived excited states. Long-lived excited states present at conventional UV intensities may contribute to formation of some photoproducts that occur rarely, but are of potential biologic importance, such as dimers between nonadjacent pyrimidines on the same strand and interstrand dimers forming DNA cross-links."
https://openalex.org/W2136013984,"Abstract Interactions between prealbumin and several thyromimetic compounds have been examined by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. One equivalent of thyroxine (T4) or reverse triiodothyronine (rT3) selectively broadens a number of protein signals, while addition of a second equivalent induces much less widespread changes. One equivalent of triiodothyronine (T3), however, produces much less dramatic changes, and effects comparable with T4 and rT3 are only apparent when a second equivalent binds. The broadening is ascribed to immobilization of flexible residues. The non-halogenated analogue 3,5-dimethyl-3'-isopropylthyronine induces qualitatively different changes suggesting incomplete entry into the thyromimetic binding channel. The fluorinated analogue SK&F 95049 (3,5-bis-thiotrifluoromethyl-3'-isopropylthyronine) induces very similar changes to T3. A fluorine-19 NMR signal with a half-height line width of approximately 150 Hz can be observed from the bound ligand. Finally, a spin-labeled T4 analogue, with a nitroxyl on the alanyl moiety, induces changes identical to those induced by T4 itself, and additionally broadens some signals corresponding to residues at the opening of the ligand binding channel. The natural tryptophan fluorescence of the protein is shown to be a sensitive indicator of binding. The possible influence of the dynamic restrictions induced by binding the first molecule of T4 or rT3 on the protein's affinity for a second hormone is discussed. It is suggested that the first interaction confers rigidity on the second site and reduces its ability to flex open and accommodate a second thyromimetic, which results in the marked negative co-operativity associated with the occupancy of this site."
https://openalex.org/W1568240041,"Abstract Human plasminogen kringle 4 has been crystallized in two different crystal forms: monoclinic, a = 32.78(3), b = 49.17(2), c = 46.27(3) A, beta = 100.67 degrees, space group P2(1), four molecules/unit cell, two molecules/asymmetric unit; orthorhombic, a = 32.09(7), b = 49.14(6), c = 49.47(9) A, space group P2(1)2(1)2, four molecules/unit cell. Both crystal forms have a large protein fraction (66% for monoclinic and 62% for orthorhombic) and diffract x-rays to 2.0 A resolution. A self-rotation function has been calculated with monoclinic data indicating a non-crystallographic 2-fold rotation approximately parallel to a* (peak height of 14.3 x sigma). Cross-rotation function calculations are in progress utilizing the coordinates of the conserved structure of kringle 1 of prothrombin and plasminogen kringle 4."
https://openalex.org/W1565443393,"Drugs of the disulfonic stilbene class, which inhibit anion transport in the cell membrane in many cell types, have been found to inhibit anion transport and cell growth in Drosophila Kc cells. Cell variants selected by a stepwise selection protocol for the ability to grow in the presence of the disulfonic stilbenes are severalfold resistant to growth inhibition by the drugs. Both the resistant populations and a cloned cell line show dramatic overexpression of three polypeptides. The most highly overproduced protein is a 123-kDa plasma membrane protein which binds the reversible anion transport inhibitor, flufenamic acid, in a protection biotinylation experiment. The 123-kDa putative anion transport protein copurifies with, and immunologically cross-reacts with, two detergent-insoluble cytoskeleton proteins of 46- and 62-kDa molecular weight, which are each overexpressed more than 8-fold in the variants. Resistance to growth inhibition by the disulfonic stilbenes and amplified expression of the 123-, 62-, and 46-kDa proteins are simultaneously lost over a period of 30 weeks in the absence of selective conditions, suggesting that the function of the overproduced polypeptides is related to growth control in Drosophila cells."
