https://openalex.org/W3009441391,"Plasma phosphorylated tau181 (P-tau181) might be increased in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but its usefulness for differential diagnosis and prognosis is unclear. We studied plasma P-tau181 in three cohorts, with a total of 589 individuals, including cognitively unimpaired participants and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD dementia and non-AD neurodegenerative diseases. Plasma P-tau181 was increased in preclinical AD and further increased at the MCI and dementia stages. It correlated with CSF P-tau181 and predicted positive Tau positron emission tomography (PET) scans (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.87-0.91 for different brain regions). Plasma P-tau181 differentiated AD dementia from non-AD neurodegenerative diseases with an accuracy similar to that of Tau PET and CSF P-tau181 (AUC = 0.94-0.98), and detected AD neuropathology in an autopsy-confirmed cohort. High plasma P-tau181 was associated with subsequent development of AD dementia in cognitively unimpaired and MCI subjects. In conclusion, plasma P-tau181 is a noninvasive diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of AD, which may be useful in clinical practice and trials."
https://openalex.org/W3009833354,"With the potential development of new disease-modifying Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapies, simple, widely available screening tests are needed to identify which individuals, who are experiencing symptoms of cognitive or behavioral decline, should be further evaluated for initiation of treatment. A blood-based test for AD would be a less invasive and less expensive screening tool than the currently approved cerebrospinal fluid or amyloid β positron emission tomography (PET) diagnostic tests. We examined whether plasma tau phosphorylated at residue 181 (pTau181) could differentiate between clinically diagnosed or autopsy-confirmed AD and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Plasma pTau181 concentrations were increased by 3.5-fold in AD compared to controls and differentiated AD from both clinically diagnosed (receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 0.894) and autopsy-confirmed frontotemporal lobar degeneration (area under the curve of 0.878). Plasma pTau181 identified individuals who were amyloid β-PET-positive regardless of clinical diagnosis and correlated with cortical tau protein deposition measured by 18F-flortaucipir PET. Plasma pTau181 may be useful to screen for tau pathology associated with AD."

However, precise integration of exogenous DNA sequences into human organoids is lacking robust knock-in approaches. Here, we describe CRISPR-Cas9-mediated homology-independent organoid transgenesis (CRISPR-HOT), which enables efficient generation of knock-in human organoids representing different tissues. CRISPR-HOT avoids extensive cloning and outperforms homology directed repair (HDR) in achieving precise integration of exogenous DNA sequences into desired loci, without the necessity to inactivate TP53 in untransformed cells, which was previously used to increase HDR-mediated knock-in. CRISPR-HOT was used to fluorescently tag and visualize subcellular structural molecules and to generate reporter lines for rare intestinal cell types. A double reporter-in which the mitotic spindle was labelled by endogenously tagged tubulin and the cell membrane by endogenously tagged E-cadherin-uncovered modes of human hepatocyte division. Combining tubulin tagging with TP53 knock-out revealed that TP53 is involved in controlling hepatocyte ploidy and mitotic spindle fidelity. CRISPR-HOT simplifies genome editing in human organoids."

Organic redox flow batteries, made from inexpensive and sustainable redox-active materials, are promising storage technologies that are cheaper and less environmentally hazardous than vanadium-based batteries, but they have shorter lifetimes and lower energy density2,3. Thus, fundamental insight at the molecular level is required to improve performance4,5. Here we report two in situ nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods of studying redox flow batteries, which are applied to two redox-active electrolytes: 2,6-dihydroxyanthraquinone (DHAQ) and 4,4'-((9,10-anthraquinone-2,6-diyl)dioxy) dibutyrate (DBEAQ). In the first method, we monitor the changes in the 1H NMR shift of the liquid electrolyte as it flows out of the electrochemical cell. In the second method, we observe the changes that occur simultaneously in the positive and negative electrodes in the full electrochemical cell. Using the bulk magnetization changes (observed via the 1H NMR shift of the water resonance) and the line broadening of the 1H shifts of the quinone resonances as a function of the state of charge, we measure the potential differences of the two single-electron couples, identify and quantify the rate of electron transfer between the reduced and oxidized species, and determine the extent of electron delocalization of the unpaired spins over the radical anions. These NMR techniques enable electrolyte decomposition and battery self-discharge to be explored in real time, and show that DHAQ is decomposed electrochemically via a reaction that can be minimized by limiting the voltage used on charging. We foresee applications of these NMR methods in understanding a wide range of redox processes in flow and other electrochemical systems."
https://openalex.org/W3010134838,"Hyper-reactivity to sensory input is a common and debilitating symptom in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), but the neural basis underlying sensory abnormality is not completely understood. Here we examined the neural representations of sensory perception in the neocortex of a Shank3B−/− mouse model of ASD. Male and female Shank3B−/− mice were more sensitive to relatively weak tactile stimulation in a vibrissa motion detection task. In vivo population calcium imaging in vibrissa primary somatosensory cortex (vS1) revealed increased spontaneous and stimulus-evoked firing in pyramidal neurons but reduced activity in interneurons. Preferential deletion of Shank3 in vS1 inhibitory interneurons led to pyramidal neuron hyperactivity and increased stimulus sensitivity in the vibrissa motion detection task. These findings provide evidence that cortical GABAergic interneuron dysfunction plays a key role in sensory hyper-reactivity in a Shank3 mouse model of ASD and identify a potential cellular target for exploring therapeutic interventions. Chen, Deister et al. show that Shank3B-knockout mice display hypersensitivity to tactile sensory stimulation and that dysfunction of interneurons in somatosensory cortex contributes to the sensory hyper-reactivity in this mouse model of autism."
https://openalex.org/W3009046244,"Chromatin modifications regulate genome function by recruiting proteins to the genome. However, the protein composition at distinct chromatin modifications has yet to be fully characterized. In this study, we used natural protein domains as modular building blocks to develop engineered chromatin readers (eCRs) selective for DNA methylation and histone tri-methylation at H3K4, H3K9 and H3K27 residues. We first demonstrated their utility as selective chromatin binders in living cells by stably expressing eCRs in mouse embryonic stem cells and measuring their subnuclear localization, genomic distribution and histone-modification-binding preference. By fusing eCRs to the biotin ligase BASU, we established ChromID, a method for identifying the chromatin-dependent protein interactome on the basis of proximity biotinylation, and applied it to distinct chromatin modifications in mouse stem cells. Using a synthetic dual-modification reader, we also uncovered the protein composition at bivalently modified promoters marked by H3K4me3 and H3K27me3. These results highlight the ability of ChromID to obtain a detailed view of protein interaction networks on chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W3102171976,"Engineered, highly controllable quantum systems are promising simulators of emergent physics beyond the simulation capabilities of classical computers1. An important problem in many-body physics is itinerant magnetism, which originates purely from long-range interactions of free electrons and whose existence in real systems has been debated for decades2,3. Here we use a quantum simulator consisting of a four-electron-site square plaquette of quantum dots4 to demonstrate Nagaoka ferromagnetism5. This form of itinerant magnetism has been rigorously studied theoretically6-9 but has remained unattainable in experiments. We load the plaquette with three electrons and demonstrate the predicted emergence of spontaneous ferromagnetic correlations through pairwise measurements of spin. We find that the ferromagnetic ground state is remarkably robust to engineered disorder in the on-site potentials and we can induce a transition to the low-spin state by changing the plaquette topology to an open chain. This demonstration of Nagaoka ferromagnetism highlights that quantum simulators can be used to study physical phenomena that have not yet been observed in any experimental system. The work also constitutes an important step towards large-scale quantum dot simulators of correlated electron systems."
https://openalex.org/W3010215023,"The RNA-programmable DNA-endonuclease Cas9 is widely used for genome engineering, where a high degree of specificity is required. To investigate which features of Cas9 determine the sensitivity to mismatches along the target DNA, we performed in vitro biochemical assays and bacterial survival assays in Escherichia coli. We demonstrate that arginines in the Cas9 bridge helix influence guide RNA, and target DNA binding and cleavage. They cluster in two groups that either increase or decrease the Cas9 sensitivity to mismatches. We show that the bridge helix is essential for R-loop formation and that R63 and R66 reduce Cas9 specificity by stabilizing the R-loop in the presence of mismatches. Additionally, we identify Q768 that reduces sensitivity of Cas9 to protospacer adjacent motif-distal mismatches. The Cas9_R63A/Q768A variant showed increased specificity in human cells. Our results provide a firm basis for function- and structure-guided mutagenesis to increase Cas9 specificity for genome engineering."
https://openalex.org/W3009178291,"CWD is an emergent prion disease that now affects cervid species on three continents. CWD is efficiently spread in wild and captive populations, likely through both direct animal contact and environmental contamination. Here, by longitudinally assaying in feces of CWD-exposed white-tailed deer by RT-QuIC, we demonstrate fecal shedding of prion seeding activity months before onset of clinical symptoms and continuing throughout the disease course. We also examine the impact of simulated environmental conditions such as repeated freeze-thaw cycles and desiccation on fecal prion seeding activity. We found that while multiple (n = 7) freeze-thaw cycles substantially decreased fecal seeding activity, desiccation had little to no effect on seeding activity. Finally, we examined whether RT-QuIC testing of landscape fecal deposits could distinguish two premises with substantial known CWD prevalence from one in which no CWD-infected animals had been detected. In the above pilot study, this distinction was possible. We conclude that fecal shedding of CWD prions occurs over much of the disease course, that environmental factors influence prion seeding activity, and that it is feasible to detect fecal prion contamination using RT-QuIC."

https://openalex.org/W3009457198,"This study aims to clarify the relationships between length of overtime work and various stress responses using large-scale cross-sectional data of Japanese workers. This study's participants are 59,021 Japanese workers in 117 companies. Data was collected by self-reporting questionnaire. The Brief Job Stress Questionnaire was used to measure stress responses on six scales (i.e. ""lack of vigor"", ""irritability"", ""fatigue"", ""anxiety"", ""depression"", and ""somatic responses""). Length of overtime work hours were classified as 0-20, 21-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, 61-70, 71-80, and >80 hours/month. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to examine the association of stress responses with overtime while adjusting all possible confounders. In result, workers with longer overtime showed significantly higher ""irritability"", ""fatigue"", ""anxiety"", ""depression"", and ""somatic responses"" for both genders (p-for-trend <0.001), however, length of overtime was negatively associated with ""lack of vigor"" among men (p-for-trend <0.001). Men with 61-80 hours of overtime showed high fatigue with high vigor at the same time. Length of overtime was linearly associated with various stress responses, except for ""lack of vigor"". Length of overtime shows linear associations with various psychosomatic stress responses. However, ""lack of vigor"" was not consistently associated with overtime. Male workers with 61-80 hours of monthly overtime were more likely to feel vigorous than workers with shorter overtime. However, potential longterm effects of such extreme overtime should not be underestimated and must be paid attention to."
https://openalex.org/W3007308368,"In the era of smartphones, route-planning and navigation is supported by freely and globally available web mapping services, such as OpenStreetMap or Google Maps. These services provide digital maps, as well as route planning functions that visually highlight the suggested route in the map. Additionally, such digital maps contain landmark pictograms, i.e. representations of salient objects in the environment. These landmark representations are, amongst other reference points, relevant for orientation, route memory, and the formation of a cognitive map of the environment. The amount of visible landmarks in maps used for navigation and route planning depends on the width of the displayed margin areas around the route. The amount of further reference points is based on the visual complexity of the map. This raises the question how factors like the distance of landmark representations to the route and visual map complexity determine the relevance of specific landmarks for memorizing a route. In order to answer this question, two experiments that investigated the relation between eye fixation patterns on landmark representations, landmark positions, route memory and visual map complexity were carried out. The results indicate that the attentional processing of landmark representations gradually decreases with an increasing distance to the route, decision points and potential decision points. Furthermore, this relation was found to be affected by the visual complexity of the map. In maps with low visual complexity, landmark representations further away from the route are fixated. However, route memory was not found to be affected by visual complexity of the map. We argue that map users might require a certain amount of reference points to form spatial relations as a foundation for a mental representation of space. As maps with low visual complexity offer less reference points, people need to scan a wider area. Therefore, visual complexity of the area displayed in a map should be considered in navigation-oriented map design by increasing displayed margins around the route in maps with a low visual complexity. In order to verify our assumption that the amount of reference points not only affects visual attention processes, but also the formation of a mental representation of space, additional research is required."
https://openalex.org/W3009682973,"The forests of Borneo—the third largest island on the planet—sustain some of the highest biodiversity and carbon storage in the world. The forests also provide vital ecosystem services and livelihood support for millions of people in the region, including many indigenous communities. The Pan-Borneo Highway and several hydroelectric dams are planned or already under construction in Sarawak, a Malaysian state comprising part of the Borneo. This development seeks to enhance economic growth and regional connectivity, support community access to services, and promote industrial development. However, the implications of the development of highway and dams for forest integrity, biodiversity and ecosystem services remained largely unreported. We assessed these development projects using fine-scale biophysical and environmental data and found several environmental and socioeconomic risks associated with the projects. The highway and hydroelectric dam projects will impact 32 protected areas including numerous key habitats of threatened species such as the proboscis monkey (Nasalis larvatus), Sarawak surili (Presbytis chrysomelas), Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) and tufted ground squirrel (Rheithrosciurus macrotis). Under its slated development trajectory, the local and trans-national forest connectivity between Malaysian Borneo and Indonesian Borneo would also be substantially diminished. Nearly ~161 km of the Pan-Borneo Highway in Sarawak will traverse forested landscapes and ~55 km will traverse carbon-rich peatlands. The 13 hydroelectric dam projects will collectively impact ~1.7 million ha of forest in Sarawak. The consequences of planned highway and hydroelectric dams construction will increase the carbon footprint of development in the region. Moreover, many new road segments and hydroelectric dams would be built on steep slopes in high-rainfall zones and forested areas, increasing both construction and ongoing maintenance costs. The projects would also alter livelihood activities of downstream communities, risking their long-term sustainability. Overall, our findings identify major economic, social and environmental risks for several planned road segments in Sarawak—such as those between Telok Melano and Kuching; Sibu and Bintulu; and in the Lambir, Limbang and Lawas regions—and dam projects—such as Tutoh, Limbang, Lawas, Baram, Linau, Ulu Air and Baleh dams. Such projects need to be reviewed to ensure they reflect Borneo’s unique environmental and forest ecosystem values, the aspirations of local communities and long-term sustainability of the projects rather than being assessed solely on their short-term economic returns."
https://openalex.org/W3009524027,"Objective Schizophrenia is associated with a severe impairment in the communicative-pragmatic domain. Recent research has tried to disentangle the relationship between communicative impairment and other domains usually impaired in schizophrenia, i.e. Theory of Mind (ToM) and cognitive functions. However, the results are inconclusive and this relationship is still unclear. Machine learning (ML) provides novel opportunities for studying complex relationships among phenomena and representing causality among multiple variables. The present research explored the potential of applying ML, specifically Bayesian network (BNs) analysis, to characterize the relationship between cognitive, ToM and pragmatic abilities in individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls, and to identify the cognitive and pragmatic abilities that are most informative in discriminating between schizophrenia and controls. Methods We provided a comprehensive assessment of different aspects of pragmatic performance, i.e. linguistic, extralinguistic, paralinguistic, contextual and conversational, ToM and cognitive functions, i.e. Executive Functions (EF)—selective attention, planning, inhibition, cognitive flexibility, working memory and speed processing—and general intelligence, in a sample of 32 individuals with schizophrenia and 35 controls. Results The results showed that the BNs classifier discriminated well between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. The network structure revealed that only pragmatic Linguistic ability directly influenced the classification of patients and controls, while diagnosis determined performance on ToM, Extralinguistic, Paralinguistic, Selective Attention, Planning, Inhibition and Cognitive Flexibility tasks. The model identified pragmatic, ToM and cognitive abilities as three distinct domains independent of one another. Conclusion Taken together, our results confirmed the importance of considering pragmatic linguistic impairment as a core dysfunction in schizophrenia, and demonstrated the potential of applying BNs in investigating the relationship between pragmatic ability and cognition."
https://openalex.org/W3009603148,"General anesthesia causes hypothermia by impairing normal thermoregulatory mechanisms. When using inhalational anesthetic agents, Redistribution of warm blood from the core to the periphery is the primary mechanism in the development of hypothermia and begins following induction of anesthesia. Raising skin temperature before anesthesia reduces the temperature gradient between core and periphery, decreasing the transfer of heat. This prospective, crossover study (n = 17 adult male and female SD rats) compared three treatment groups: PW1% (pre-warming to increase core temperature 1% over baseline), PW40 (pre-warming to increase core temperature to 40°C) and NW (no warming). The PW1% group was completed first to ensure tolerance of pre-warming. Treatment order was then randomized and alternated after a washout period. Once target temperature was achieved, anesthesia was induced and maintained with isoflurane in oxygen without further external temperature support. Pre-warming was effective at delaying the onset of hypothermia, with a significant difference between PW1% (12.4 minutes) and PW40 (19.3 minutes, p = 0.0044 (95%CI -12 to -2.2), PW40 and NW (7.1 minutes, p < 0.0001 (95%CI 8.1 to 16.0) and PW1% and NW (p = 0.003, 95%CI 1.8 to 8.7). The rate of heat loss in the pre-warmed groups exceed that of the NW group: PW1% versus NW (p = 0.005, 95%CI 0.004 to 0.027), PW40 versus NW (p < 0.0001, 95%CI 0.014 to 0.036) and PW1% versus PW40 (p = 0.07, 95%CI -0.021 to 0.00066). Pre-warming alone confers a protective effect against hypothermia during volatile anesthesia; however, longer duration procedures would require additional heating support."
https://openalex.org/W3009809333,"Angiotensin II (Ang II) is a key contributor to glomerular disease by predominantly resulting in podocyte injury, whereas the underlying molecular mechanisms has not been fully understood. This study aimed to investigate if and how ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6), a small GTP-binding protein, involves Ang II-induced cellular injury in cultured human podocytes. Cellular injury was evaluated with caspase 3 activity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and TUNEL assay. Arf6 activity was measured using an Arf6-GTP Pull-Down Assay. Ang II significantly enhanced Arf6 expressions accompanied by increase of Arf6-GTP. The TUNEL-positive cells as well as activated caspase 3, NADPH oxidase 4 protein (Nox4) and ROS levels were dramatically increased in Ang II-treated podocytes, which was prevented by secinH3, an Arf6 activity inhibitor. Induction of ROS by Ang II was inhibited in podocytes with Nox4 knockdown. Ang II-induced elevation of Nox4 and ROS was prevented by Arf6 knockdown. Phpspho-Erk1/2Thr202/Tyr204 levels were upregulated remarkably following Ang II treatment, and Erk inhibitor LY3214996 significantly downregulated Nox4 expression. In addition, Ang II decreased CD2AP expression. Overexpression of CD2AP prevented Ang II-induced upregulation of Arf6-GTP. Our data demonstrated that Ang II promotes ROS production and podocytes injury through activation of Arf6-Erk1/2-Nox4 signaling. We also provided evidence that Ang II activates Arf6 by degradation of CD2AP."
https://openalex.org/W3009840181,"The effects of providing rest on physiological and behavioural indicators of welfare of cattle being transported by road has not been well studied in North America. New revisions to Canada’s Health of Animals Regulations Part XII: Transportation of Animals indicate un-weaned and weaned calves can be transported a maximum of 12 and 36 h, respectively, before an 8 h rest is required. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the effects of rest duration, after 12 and 36 h of transport, on physiological and behavioural indicators of welfare in 7–8 mo-old beef calves. Three hundred and twenty conditioned calves (258 ± 23.9 kg BW) were randomly assigned to a 2 × 4 factorial design where the main factors included transport duration: 12 h (12; n = 160) and 36 h (36; n = 160) and rest stop duration: 0 h (R0; n = 80), 4 h (R4; n = 80), 8 h (R8; n = 80) and 12 h (R12; n = 80). After the resting period, animals were transported for an additional 4 h. Blood and hair samples were taken from 12 animals per treatment prior to and after the first and the 4 h transport; and then 7 h, 2 d and 28 d after the 4 h transport. The concentrations of haptoglobin, creatine kinase, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), lactate, and serum and hair cortisol were determined. Standing and lying behaviour was assessed for 14 d after transport, while feeding behaviour of calves in one pen per treatment were assessed for 28 d after transportation using an electronic feed bunk monitoring system. Body weight (BW), average daily gain (ADG) and shrink (%) was assessed for all calves. The data was modeled using generalized linear mixed methods (SAS PROC GLIMMIX), where transport and time (nested in rest) were considered fixed effects and animal and pen were considered random effects. Statistically significant (p < 0.05) effects of transport were observed on BW and shrink, where 36 h-transported calves had lower (p < 0.01) BW and greater (p < 0.01) shrink than 12 h-transported calves. A transport × time (nested in rest) interaction (p < 0.01) was observed for lying percentage where, 36-R8 calves had greater (p < 0.01) lying percentage than 12-R8 calves on d 1 after transportation. The area under the curve (AUC) for NEFA was greater (p < 0.01) for 36-R0 calves than 12-R0, 36-R4, and 36-R8 calves, and greater (p < 0.01) in 36-R12 calves than 12-R12 calves. Haptoglobin AUC was greater (p = 0.05) in 36-R12 than 12-R12 calves. Overall, physiological indicators of reduced welfare were greater in calves transported for 36 than 12 h, while no clear differences were observed between rest stop groups with the exception of NEFA. Based on these results, conditioned calves benefit from shorter transport durations but there was no clear evidence that calves rested 4, 8, and 12 h following transportation experienced reduced transport related stress compared to those that were not rested (0h)."
https://openalex.org/W3010068847,"Amplification of the MYCN oncogene occurs in ~25% of primary neuroblastomas and is the single most powerful biological marker of poor prognosis in this disease. MYCN transcriptionally regulates a range of biological processes important for cancer, including cell metabolism. The MYCN-regulated metabolic gene SLC16A1, encoding the lactate transporter monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1), is a potential therapeutic target. Treatment of neuroblastoma cells with the MCT1 inhibitor SR13800 increased intracellular lactate levels, disrupted the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH/NAD+) ratio, and decreased intracellular glutathione levels. Metabolite tracing with 13C-glucose and 13C-glutamine following MCT1 inhibitor treatment revealed increased quantities of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates and increased oxygen consumption rate. MCT1 inhibition was highly synergistic with vincristine and LDHA inhibition under cell culture conditions, but this combination was ineffective against neuroblastoma xenografts. Posttreatment xenograft tumors had increased synthesis of the MCT1 homolog MCT4/SLC16A, a known resistance factor to MCT1 inhibition. We found that MCT4 was negatively regulated by MYCN in luciferase reporter assays and its synthesis in neuroblastoma cells was increased under hypoxic conditions and following hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF1) induction, suggesting that MCT4 may contribute to resistance to MCT1 inhibitor treatment in hypoxic neuroblastoma tumors. Co-treatment of neuroblastoma cells with inhibitors of MCT1 and LDHA, the enzyme responsible for lactate production, resulted in a large increase in intracellular pyruvate and was highly synergistic in decreasing neuroblastoma cell viability. These results highlight the potential of targeting MCT1 in neuroblastoma in conjunction with strategies that involve disruption of pyruvate homeostasis and indicate possible resistance mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W3009434884,"Clinical studies have recently demonstrated that autologous transplantation of mobilized dental pulp stem cells is a safe and efficacious potential therapy for pulp regeneration. However, some limitations need to be addressed, such as the high cost of the safety and quality control tests for isolated individual dental pulp cell products before transplantation. Therefore, more efficient in vitro culturing of human dental pulp stem cells might be useful for providing low cost and high reliability testing for pulp regeneration therapy. In this study, we established a novel immortalized dental pulp stem cell line by co-expressing a mutant cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4R24C), Cyclin D1, and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT). The established cell line maintained its original diploid chromosomes and stemness characteristics and exhibited an enhanced proliferation rate. In addition, we showed the immortalized human dental pulp stem cells still keeps their osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation abilities under appropriate culture conditions even though the cell proliferation was accelerated. Taken together, our established cell lines could serve as a useful in vitro tool for pulp regeneration therapy, and can contribute to reproducibility and ease of cell handling, thereby saving time and costs associated with safety and quality control tests."
https://openalex.org/W3007877820,"Objective In view of the current obesity epidemic, studies focusing on the interplay of playing outside (PO), screen time (ST) and anthropometric measures in preschool age are necessary to guide evidence-based public health planning. We therefore investigated the relationship between average time spent PO and ST from the ages 3 to 6 years and anthropometric measures at 6 years of age. Methods PO and ST of 526 children of the European Childhood Obesity Project (CHOP) were annually assessed by questionnaire from 3 until 6 years of age. Body weight, waist circumference and height were measured at 3 and 6 years of age to calculate Body-Mass-Index z-Scores (zBMI) and waist-to-height ratio (WTH). Linear, logistic and quantile regressions were used to test whether average time spent PO and ST in the 4 year period had an effect on anthropometric measures at age 6 years. Results Longer daily ST was associated with a higher zBMI (P = 0.002) and WTH (P = 0.001) at 6 years of age. No significant associations were found for time spent PO. Each additional hour of average ST during the 4 year period resulted in a 66% higher risk of having a zBMI score over 1 (P < 0.001) and almost twice the risk (94% higher risk) of having an zBMI score over 2 (P < 0.001) at 6 years. Conclusions Excessive ST during preschool age is a risk factor for increased zBMI at 6 years, regardless of time spent PO. Reducing high levels of ST during preschool age, for e.g. at least 1h per week, could help preventing childhood obesity."
https://openalex.org/W3009910714,"Despite being the subject of intensive research, tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, remains at present the leading cause of death from an infectious agent. Secreted and cell wall proteins interact with the host and play important roles in pathogenicity. These proteins are explored as candidate diagnostic markers, potential drug targets or vaccine antigens, and more recently special attention is being given to the role of their post-translational modifications. With the purpose of contributing to the proteomic and glycoproteomic characterization of this important pathogen, we performed a shotgun analysis of culture filtrate proteins of M. tuberculosis based on a liquid nano-HPLC tandem mass spectrometry and a label-free spectral counting normalization approach for protein quantification. We identified 1314 M. tuberculosis proteins in culture filtrate and found that the most abundant proteins belong to the extracellular region or cell wall compartment, and that the functional categories with higher protein abundance factor were virulence, detoxification and adaptation, and cell wall and cell processes. We could identify a group of proteins consistently detected in previous studies, most of which were highly abundant proteins. In culture filtrate, 140 proteins were predicted to contain one of the three types of bacterial N-terminal signal peptides. Besides, various proteins belonging to the ESX secretion systems, and to the PE and PPE families, secreted by the type VII secretion system using nonclassical secretion signals, were also identified. O-glycosylation was identified in 46 proteins, many of them lipoproteins and cell wall associated proteins. Finally, we provide proteomic evidence for 33 novel O-glycosylated proteins, aiding to the glycoproteomic characterization of relevant antigenic membrane and exported proteins. These findings are expected to collaborate with the research on pathogen derived biomarkers, virulence factors and vaccine candidates, and to provide clues to the understanding of the pathogenesis and survival strategies adopted by M. tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W3009963987,"This study investigated the association between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptomatology in preschool-aged children who were born very preterm (<33 weeks) and cognitive outcomes, clinical risk and socio-demographic characteristics. 119 very preterm children who participated in the Evaluation of Preterm Imaging Study at term-equivalent age were assessed at a mean age of 4.5 years. Parents completed the ADHD Rating Scale IV, a norm-referenced checklist that evaluates ADHD symptomatology according to diagnostic criteria, and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Preschool version. Children completed the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scales of Intelligence and the Forward Digit Span task. Longitudinal data including perinatal clinical, qualitative MRI classification, socio-demographic variables and neurodevelopmental disabilities were investigated in relation to ADHD symptomatology. All results were corrected for multiple comparisons using false discovery rate. Results showed that although the proportion of very preterm children with clinically significant ADHD did not differ from normative data after excluding those with neurodevelopmental disabilities, 32.7% met criteria for subthreshold ADHD inattentive type and 33.6% for combined type, which was higher than the expected 20% in normative samples. Higher ADHD symptom scores (all) were associated with greater executive dysfunction (inhibitory self-control, flexibility, and emergent metacognition, corrected p<0.001 for all tests). Higher inattentive ADHD symptom scores were associated with lower IQ (ρ = -0.245, p = 0.011) and higher perinatal clinical risk (more days on mechanical ventilation (ρ = 0.196, p = 0.032) and more days on parenteral nutrition (ρ = 0.222, p = 0.015). Higher hyperactive ADHD symptom scores instead were associated with lower socio-economic status (ρ = 0.259, p = 0.004).

A model of the cardiovascular system is proposed, including descriptions of i) cardiac electrical activity, ii) elastance-based cardiac cavities, iii) systemic and pulmonary circulations and iv) heart valves. After a sensitivity analysis of model parameters, an identification strategy was implemented using a Monte-Carlo cross-validation approach. Parameter identification procedure consists in two steps for the estimation of LV pressures: step 1) from invasive, intraventricular measurements and step 2) from non-invasive data. The proposed approach was validated on data obtained from 12 patients with AS. The total relative errors between estimated and measured pressures were on average 11.9% and 12.27% and mean R2 were equal to 0.96 and 0.91, respectively for steps 1 and 2 of parameter identification strategy. Using LV pressures obtained from non-invasive measurements (step 2) and patient-specific simulations, Global Constructive (GCW), Wasted (GWW) myocardial Work and Global Work Efficiency (GWE) parameters were calculated. Correlations between measures and model-based estimations were 0.88, 0.80, 0.91 respectively for GCW, GWW and GWE. The main contributions concern the proposal of the parameter identification procedure, applied on an integrated cardiovascular model, able to reproduce LV pressure specifically to each AS patient, by non-invasive procedures, as well as a new method for the non-invasive estimation of constructive, wasted myocardial work and work efficiency in AS."
https://openalex.org/W3010582582,"With the development of e-commerce, online shopping has become one of the most important consumer channels. However, the lack of government supervision, insufficient review of e-commerce platforms, illegal sales of online sellers and invalid consumer complaints have led to frequent green product quality problems during online shopping. Therefore, this paper considers that the online seller may be driven by interests, colluding with the e-commerce platform and selling low quality green product. At the same time, we introduce consumer feedback, and take the government supervision department, the online seller and the e-commerce platform as actors of the evolutionary game. In this paper, the evolutionary strategy choices of each actor were analyzed, and the influence of different factors on the evolutionary stability results was explored. Research indicates: firstly, consumer complaints play an indirect regulatory role for the online seller; secondly, the enhancement of the loss-sharing relationship between the online seller and the e-commerce platform can promote the legal operation of the two and prevent collusion; thirdly, the impact of consumer complaints on the choice of the e-commerce platform depends on the government supervision department's penalty for the e-commerce platform; finally, the e-commerce platform establishes a reasonable reward system, which can make up for the defects of the online seller using advanced technology to avoid punishment. Our paper uses Matlab 2017 for simulation analysis and provides effective advices on how to urge the government supervision department to effectively supervise, promote the e-commerce platform to enhance review, urge the online seller to legal sale, and encourage consumers to legally defend their rights."
https://openalex.org/W3007852751,"Inclusion body disease (IBD) is caused by reptarenaviruses and constitutes one of the most notorious viral diseases in snakes. Although central nervous system disease and various other clinical signs have been attributed to IBD in boid and pythonid snakes, studies that unambiguously reveal the clinical course of natural IBD and reptarenavirus infection are scarce. In the present study, the prevalence of IBD and reptarenaviruses in captive snake collections and the correlation of IBD and reptarenavirus infection with the clinical status of the sampled snakes were investigated. In three IBD positive collections, long-term follow-up during a three- to seven-year period was performed. A total of 292 snakes (178 boas and 114 pythons) from 40 collections in Belgium were sampled. In each snake, blood and buffy coat smears were evaluated for the presence of IBD inclusion bodies (IB) and whole blood was tested for reptarenavirus RNA by RT-PCR. Of all tested snakes, 16.5% (48/292) were positive for IBD of which all were boa constrictors (34.0%; 48/141) and 17.1% (50/292) were reptarenavirus RT-PCR positive. The presence of IB could not be demonstrated in any of the tested pythons, while 5.3% (6/114) were reptarenavirus positive. In contrast to pythons, the presence of IB in peripheral blood cells in boa constrictors is strongly correlated with reptarenavirus detection by RT-PCR (P<0.0001). Although boa constrictors often show persistent subclinical infection, long-term follow-up indicated that a considerable number (22.2%; 6/27) of IBD/reptarenavirus positive boas eventually develop IBD associated comorbidities."
https://openalex.org/W3009974011,"Disoriented animals and humans use both the environmental geometry and visual landmarks to guide their spatial behavior. Although there is a broad consensus on the use of environmental geometry across various species of vertebrates, the nature of disoriented landmark-use has been greatly debated in the field. In particular, the discrepancy in performance under spontaneous choice conditions (sometimes called ""working memory"" task) and training over time (""reference memory"" task) has raised questions about the task-dependent dissociability of mechanisms underlying the use of landmarks. Until now, this issue has not been directly addressed, due to the inclusion of environmental geometry in most disoriented navigation paradigms. In the present study, therefore, we placed our focus on landmark-based navigation in fish (Xenotoca eiseni), an animal model that has provided fruitful research in spatial reorientation. We began with a test of spontaneous navigation by geometry and landmarks (Experiment 1), showing a preference for the correct corner, even in the absence of reinforced training. We then proceeded to test landmarks without the influence of informative geometry through the use of square environments (Experiment 2-4), varying the numerosity of present landmarks, the distance of landmarks from the target corner, and the type of task (i.e., spontaneous cued memory or reference memory). We found marked differences in landmark-use in the absence of environmental geometry. In the spontaneous memory task, visual landmarks acquired perceptive salience (and attracted the fish) but without serving as a spatial cue to location when they were distal from the target. Across learning in the reference memory task, the fish overcame these effects and gradually improved in their performance, although they were still biased to learn visual landmarks near the target (i.e., as beacons). We discuss these results in relation to the existing literature on dissociable mechanisms of spatial learning."
https://openalex.org/W3009137325,"Mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) become obese and develop osteoarthritis (OA)-like lesions, including chondrocyte apoptosis, in the knee joints. However, the mechanism by which HFD/obesity induces chondrocyte apoptosis is not clearly understood. In the present study, male mice were fed a low-fat diet (LFD, 10% kcal), HFD (45% kcal), or a HFD administered with 0.5 g/kg bodyweight of 4-phenyl butyric acid (PBA, a small chaperone known to ease endoplasmic reticulum [ER] stress), via the drinking water. At the end of the 18-week study, stifle (knee) joints from all animals were collected, fixed, paraffin embedded, and sectioned. Immunostaining of joints from the HFD group showed increased expression of ER stress and apoptotic markers and increased expression of nuclear protein 1 and tribbles related protein-3 compared to the LFD group. Mice on HFD also showed higher percentage of chondrocyte death, lower chondrocyte numbers per cartilage area, and thickening of subchondral bone. Administration of PBA alleviated all of the HFD-induced symptoms. Our study demonstrated that HFD induces ER stress to promote chondrocyte death and subchondral bone thickening, which could be relieved by alleviating ER stress via PBA administration, suggesting that ER stress could play an important role in obesity-linked OA and could be targeted for OA therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W3009578741,"Recent data highlights an imbalance in research grant success among groups underrepresented within the biomedical workforce, including racial/ethnic minorities and women. However, there is no data on grant success for researchers with disabilities. For these analyses, aggregate data on self-reported disability status for National Institute on Health (NIH) research grant applicants and awardees was obtained from 2008 to 2018, including disability category: mobility/orthopedic, hearing, visual disabilities, and other disabilities. The percentage of applications and awards, as well as grant success rates (% of applicants receiving awards), by Principal Investigators (PIs) disability status were calculated. Data was desegregated, and logistic models determined trend of applicants reporting disability over time. The percentage of NIH grant applicants with PIs reporting a disability significantly declined from 1.9% in 2008, to 1.2% in 2018 (p<0.001). Data on grant awardees was similar, 1.9% of awards in 2008, declining to 1.2% in 2018 (p<0.001) had PIs reporting a disability. Across all years, the percentage of applications and awards with PIs reporting visual disabilities was lower than the percentage reporting mobility/orthopedic, or hearing disabilities (16.5%, 34.2%, and 37.8% in 2008, respectively). Overall grant success rates differed by disability status (27.2% for those reporting disability vs 29.7% in those reporting no disability, p<0.001). The lowest overall grant success rate was among PIs reporting unknown disability status or who withheld this status (18.6%). These results underscore the underrepresentation of researchers with disabilities among grant applicants and awardees, and indicate lower grant success rates among PIs reporting disabilities."
https://openalex.org/W3010210724,"To better define the sweetpotato polyploidy, we sought to reconstruct phylogenies of its subgenomes based on hybridization networks that could trace reticulate lineages of differentiated homoeolog triplets of multiple single-copy genes. In search of such homoeolog triplets, we distinguished cDNA variants of 811 single-copy Conserved Ortholog Set II (COSII) genes from two sweetpotato clones into variation partitions specified by corresponding homologs from two I. trifida lines, I. tenuissima and I. littoralis using a phylogenetic partition method, and amplicon variants of the COSII-marker regions from 729 of these genes from two sweetpotato clones into putative homoeoallele groups using haplotype tree and the partition methods referenced by corresponding homologs from I. tenuissima. These analyses revealed partly or completely differentiated expressed-homoeologs and homoeologs from a majority of these genes with three important features. 1. Two variation types: the predominant interspecific variations (homoeoalleles), which are non-randomly clustered, differentially interspecifically conserved or sweetpotato-specific, and the minor intraspecific ones (alleles), which are randomly distributed mostly at non-interspecifically variable sites, and usually sweetpotato-specific. 2. A clear differentiation of cDNA variants of many COSII genes into the variation partition specified by I. tenuissima or I. littoralis from that by I. trifida. 3. Three species-homolog-specified and one sweetpotato-specific variation partitions among 293 different COSII cDNAs, and two or three out of the four partitions among cDNA variants of 306 COSII genes. We then constructed hybridization networks from two concatenations of 16 and 4 alignments of 8 homologous COSII cDNA regions each, which included three taxa of expressed homoeologs in a triple-partition combination from the 16 or 4 sweetpotato COSII genes and 5 taxa each of respective cDNA homologs from the three sweetpotato relatives and I. nil, and inferred a species tree embodying both networks. The species tree predicted close-relative origins of three partly differentiated sweetpotato subgenomes."

The sample included 60 men's (n = 4,475 rallies) and 60 women's (n = 4,490 rallies) matches randomly selected from the 2015 World Badminton Super Series and World Championship (the final sample included long rallies that had an immediate next point played: n = 1,734 and n = 1,644 rallies for male and female players, respectively). The long rallies represented 19.4% (n = 867) and 16.5% (n = 822) of total rallies for male and female players, respectively. Long rallies were established using a two-step cluster model based on rally time and number of strokes for male (13-79s, 14-72 strokes) and female players (11-56s, 11-52 strokes). The variables collected were point outcome (when serving and receiving, winner, forced-error and unforced-error), number of strokes per rally, rally time, rest time, density, and time between strokes. The rallies were classified into different contexts (clusters) according to influencing factors with eight clusters for male players and three clusters for female players identified. Comparisons among clusters were conducted using Kruskal Wallis and one-way ANOVAs. Comparisons between long and immediate next points were conducted using the Wilcoxon tests for most variables and Crosstabs Command for point outcome and rallies (long and immediate next). Statistically significant differences were identified for both sexes among clusters only for time-related variables (i.e., rally time, rest time, density and time between strokes). In addition, a greater number of strokes, longer rally, rest time, and higher density were identified during long rallies compared with the immediate next rally for both men's and women's matches (p<0.05). The time between strokes during long rallies was significantly greater for male players during clusters 3, 5, 6, and 7 (p<0.05) and significantly lower for female players during all clusters (p<0.05). Significant relationships were identified between winning point outcome, and more unforced errors when serving during the immediate next rally (men's cluster 5 and women's cluster 2), and more winners when serving during the immediate next rally (men's cluster 6). The current study identified and characterised long rallies in elite men´s and women´s badminton matches highlighting the importance of sex and contextual factors on time-related and technical demands. Information obtained from these unique sequences of play (i.e., long and immediate next rallies) will assist coaches when modelling and simulating players' performances (i.e., physiologically and cognitively) during athlete preparation/competition."
https://openalex.org/W3010361345,"The tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) enzyme catalyzes the first step of serotonin biosynthesis. Serotonin is known for its role in several homeostatic systems related to sleep, mood, and food intake. As the reaction catalyzed by TPH2 is the rate-limiting step of serotonin biosynthesis, mutations in TPH2 have been associated with several psychiatric disorders (PD). This work undertakes an in silico analysis of the effects of genetic mutations in the human TPH2 protein. Ten algorithms were used to predict the functional and stability effects of the TPH2 mutations. ConSurf was used to estimate the evolutionary conservation of TPH2 amino acids. GROMACS was used to perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of TPH2 WT and P260S, R303W, and R441H, which had already been associated with the development of PD. Forty-six TPH2 variants were compiled from the literature. Among the analyzed variants, those occurring at the catalytic domain were shown to be more damaging to protein structure and function. The ConSurf analysis indicated that the mutations affecting the catalytic domain were also more conserved throughout evolution. The variants S364K and S383F were predicted to be deleterious by all the functional algorithms used and occurred at conserved positions, suggesting that they might be deleterious. The MD analyses indicate that the mutations P206S, R303W, and R441H affect TPH2 flexibility and essential mobility at the catalytic and oligomerization domains. The variants P206S, R303W, and R441H also exhibited alterations in dimer binding affinity and stability throughout the simulations. Thus, these mutations may impair TPH2 functional interactions and, consequently, its function, leading to the development of PD. Furthermore, we developed a database, SNPMOL (http://www.snpmol.org/), containing the results presented in this paper. Understanding the effects of TPH2 mutations on protein structure and function may lead to improvements in existing treatments for PD and facilitate the design of further experiments."

During development, SMAD7 is expressed in the hormone-negative cells in the developing pancreas and then later seems to shut off in hormone-positive endocrine cells (17El-Gohary Y. Tulachan S. Guo P.

A previous study showed that overexpressing SMAD7 in pdx1-positive cells led to severe pancreatic hypoplasia and a >85% reduction in the number of β cells and an associated increase in the number of α cells at birth (21Smart N.G.

On the other hand, SMAD7 knockdown or deletion in endocrine progenitor cells resulted in significant suppression of endocrine development (17El-Gohary Y. Tulachan S. Guo P. Welsh C. Wiersch J. Prasadan K. Paredes J. Shiota C. Xiao X. Wada Y. Diaz M. Gittes G. SMAD signaling pathways regulate pancreatic endocrine development.Dev.

These findings from overexpression and inhibitory studies suggest that SMAD7 function may strike a delicate balance in the regulation of SMAD2/3 signaling to preserve normal pancreatic endocrine development and function, especially β-cell function. Our studies here of overexpression differ substantially from the previous study by Smart et al. (21Smart N.G. Apelqvist A.A. Gu X. Harmon E.B. Topper J.N. MacDonald R.J. Kim S.K. Conditional expression of SMAD7 in pancreatic β cells disrupts TGF-β signaling and induces reversible diabetes mellitus.PLoS Biol. 2006; 4 (16435884): e3910.1371/journal.pbio.0040039Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) in that here the cells are not dependent on active pdx1 expression for SMAD7 overexpression, and the entire insulin+ lineage will be SMAD7 overexpressors upon doxycycline treatment. In addition, the novel ins1-dre knock-in that we use, instead of the pdx1-tTA used previously, does not cause a baseline diabetic phenotype. Last, we use a Tet-On system that allows for tighter initiation of SMAD7 overexpression, without the need for waiting for the pharmacologic clearance of doxycycline that is needed in the tet-off system. In the adult islet, β-cell renewal through proliferation is thought to be important for proper maintenance of β-cell mass and function. Our previous study showed that TGF-β receptor signaling was necessary for inflammation-induced β-cell proliferation, but not for workload-induced β-cell proliferation (22Xiao X. Wiersch J. El-Gohary Y. Guo P. Prasadan K. Paredes J. Welsh C. Shiota C. Gittes G.K. TGFβ receptor signaling is essential for inflammation-induced but not β-cell workload-induced β-cell proliferation.Diabetes. 2013; 62 (23248173): 1217-122610.2337/db12-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, another of our studies used a global pancreatic deletion of SMAD7 to demonstrate that, unlike TGF-β receptors, SMAD7 is a crucial mediator of both workload and inflammation-induced β-cell proliferation (23El-Gohary Y.

Specifically, lack of SMAD7 expression prevented normal β-cell proliferation and recovery either during regeneration after partial pancreatectomy (increased workload) or after pancreatic duct ligation (inflammation-induced), confirming an important role for SMAD7 in promoting β-cell proliferation in both conditions (22Xiao X.

Thus, a better understanding of how SMAD7 regulates both β-cell proliferation and β-cell function seems warranted. Here, we compare the effects of a seemingly more elegant β cell–specific SMAD7 deletion or overexpression system on β-cell mass and function in an adult mouse islet. Our laboratory has previously developed a pancreas-specific novel dual-lineage tracing technology, using a combination of two recombinase systems, Dre/RoxP and Cre/LoxP, to independently trace GFP1-expressing green fluorescent Pdx1-lineage cells and tomato red fluorescent Ptf1a-lineage cells in the developing and adult mouse pancreas (25Chen C.

We also previously reported an important role for SMAD7 in promoting β-cell replication during pancreas development and during regeneration after partial pancreatectomy or after pancreatic duct ligation (17El-Gohary Y.

To explore such a role for SMAD7 in adult β cells, we developed a novel tetracycline-regulatable Dre recombinase–dependent SMAD7-overexpressing knock-in mouse (Fig. 1A). This mouse model resembles the SMAD7 overexpressor published previously by the Kim group (21Smart N.G. Apelqvist A.A. Gu X. Harmon E.B. Topper J.N. MacDonald R.J. Kim S.K. Conditional expression of SMAD7 in pancreatic β cells disrupts TGF-β signaling and induces reversible diabetes mellitus.PLoS Biol. 2006; 4 (16435884): e3910.1371/journal.pbio.0040039Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), but with several important differences. First, Dre recombinase–dependent SMAD7 overexpression in mice allows for the use of Cre recombinase for other purposes, without affecting SMAD7 overexpression. Thus, our model can allow for a tissue-specific, knock-back-in strategy following Cre-mediated SMAD7 knockout. Second, in our mice, the expression of SMAD7 is up-regulated by doxycycline, rather than down-regulated, and is independent of ongoing pdx1 or insulin promoter activity, which may be unpredictable during altered β-cell states. Third, SMAD7 overexpression is in the HPRT locus, which is linked to the X chromosome, and thus allows us to obtain roughly 100% of cells overexpressing SMAD7 in males or homozygous females, but only 50% of cells in heterozygous females, thus potentially facilitating cell-autonomous analyses. Fourth, by crossing SMAD7Hprt mice with our newly created insulin1Dre and Rosa26GFP reporter mice, we were able to label SMAD7-overexpressing β cells with GFP protein for sorting (hereafter called Ins1DreSMAD7Hprt/Rosa26GFP mice). In conclusion, our model may represent a greatly improved approach for studying non-cell-autonomous and cell-autonomous effects of SMAD7 overexpression on β cells. Ins1DreSMAD7Hprt/Rosa26GFP and MIP-GFP control mice were randomized into groups receiving either doxycycline (625 mg) or normal control diet for 3 weeks. We examined SMAD7 expression in flow-sorted GFP-positive β cells from Ins1DreSMAD7Hprt/Rosa26GFP mice by quantitative RT-PCR and found a significant increase in SMAD7 gene transcripts (∼100-fold over MIP-GFP mice) in Ins1DreSMAD7Hprt/Rosa26GFP β cells when continuously exposed to doxycycline diet for 3 weeks (Fig. 1B). We did not see any significant difference in SMAD7/mRNA levels between MIP-GFP and Ins1Dre SMAD7Hprt/Rosa26GFP mice not exposed to doxycycline. Ins1DreSMAD7Hprt/Rosa26GFP mice on a regular diet did not appear to show any “leaky” increase in the expression of SMAD7 in β cells (Fig. 1B). The doxycycline exposure also resulted in increased expression of SMAD7 protein in adult islets confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 1, C and D). Collectively, the data confirm that SMAD7 overexpression is doxycycline-dependent and appears to be β cell–specific, driven by Ins1Dre in Ins1DreSMAD7Hprt/Rosa26GFP mice. TGF-β signaling pathways play an important regulatory role in β-cell proliferation and homeostasis (21Smart N.G. Apelqvist A.A. Gu X. Harmon E.B. Topper J.N. MacDonald R.J. Kim S.K. Conditional expression of SMAD7 in pancreatic β cells disrupts TGF-β signaling and induces reversible diabetes mellitus.PLoS Biol. 2006; 4 (16435884): e3910.1371/journal.pbio.0040039Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 22Xiao X.

SMAD2 and SMAD3 are specific SMADs that act downstream of TGF-βs and seem to prevent β-cell proliferation and to maintain the β-cell phenotype, whereas SMAD7, an inhibitory SMAD, serves as an antagonist of TGF-β receptor signaling pathways (17El-Gohary Y.

Normal adult β cells express both SMAD2 and SMAD3, whereas SMAD7 is barely detectable (23El-Gohary Y. Tulachan S. Wiersch J. Guo P. Welsh C. Prasadan K. Paredes J. Shiota C. Xiao X. Wada Y. Diaz M.

The Ins1DreSMAD7Hprt/Rosa26GFP mice on a regular diet had normal islet levels of phosphorylated SMAD2 (Ser-465/467) (Fig. 2, A, C, and D) and phosphorylated SMAD3 expression (Ser-423/425) (Fig. 2, B–D), as shown by immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting, suggesting normal TGF-β signaling in the absence of doxycycline. Total SMAD2 and SMAD3 mRNA (Fig. 2, E and F) and protein levels (Fig. 2, C and D) were also measured in purified β cells and islets, respectively. With doxycycline-induced SMAD7 overexpression, we observed a significant reduction in phosphorylated SMAD2 (Ser-465/467) (Fig. 2, A, C, and D) and SMAD3 (Ser-423/425)(Fig. 2, B–D) as well as total islet SMAD2 and SMAD3 expression (Fig. 2, C–F). Collectively, the data confirm that β cell–specific doxycycline-dependent SMAD7 overexpression disrupted TGF-β signaling in adult pancreatic islets/β cells. This observation is in line with previous work by Smart et al. (21Smart N.G. Apelqvist A.A. Gu X. Harmon E.B. Topper J.N. MacDonald R.J. Kim S.K. Conditional expression of SMAD7 in pancreatic β cells disrupts TGF-β signaling and induces reversible diabetes mellitus.PLoS Biol. 2006; 4 (16435884): e3910.1371/journal.pbio.0040039Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), who observed reduced phospho-SMAD2 and impaired TGF-β signaling following conditional transgenic expression of SMAD7 in pdx1-positive adult islet cells. SMAD7 is thought to be a regulator of the size of the pancreatic endocrine compartment during development (17El-Gohary Y. Tulachan S. Guo P. Welsh C. Wiersch J. Prasadan K. Paredes J. Shiota C. Xiao X. Wada Y. Diaz M. Gittes G. SMAD signaling pathways regulate pancreatic endocrine development.Dev.

Also, inhibition of SMAD7 expression in β cells led to a loss of proliferation (23El-Gohary Y. Tulachan S. Wiersch J. Guo P. Welsh C. Prasadan K. Paredes J. Shiota C. Xiao X. Wada Y. Diaz M.

In four online studies, we show that the personality trait of SSI, namely the susceptibility to normative influence (SNI), predicts the extent to which Facebook users comply with the behavior of others on Facebook (e.g., buying, voting, or visiting what other OSN users post). In Studies 1a and 1b, we find that SSI correlates with diverse OSN behaviors, which are the typical results of being affected by social influence. In Study 1b, we find that the perceived importance of the topic of OSN behaviors (e.g., fashion or politics) moderates the effect of SNI on OSN behavior, with a higher importance resulting in a stronger effect of SNI on OSN behavior. In Studies 2 and 3, we find that SNI predicts the extent Facebook users hypothetically ""like"" diverse topics on Facebook. We also find partial support for the idea that there are interactions between SNI and the Big Five personality traits (i.e., openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism) on OSN behavior. Specifically, the extent to which the Big Five personality traits of openness, agreeableness, and neuroticism predict OSN behavior depends on Facebook users' SNI. Our studies contribute to research on the personality-based prediction of OSN behavior and help in better understanding the dynamics of social influence in OSNs, underlining the vulnerability of susceptible OSN users."
https://openalex.org/W3010531730,"Chemokines and their receptors play important roles in vascular homeostasis, development, and angiogenesis. Little is known regarding the molecular signaling mechanisms activated by CCL28 chemokine via its primary receptor CCR10 in endothelial cells (ECs). Here, we test the hypothesis that CCL28/CCR10 signaling plays an important role in regulating skin wound angiogenesis through endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)-dependent Src, PI3K, and MAPK signaling. We observed nitric oxide (NO) production in human primary ECs stimulated with exogenous CCL28, which also induced direct binding of CCR10 and eNOS resulting in inhibition of eNOS activity. Knockdown of CCR10 with siRNA lead to reduced eNOS expression and tube formation suggesting the involvement of CCR10 in EC angiogenesis. Based on this interaction, we engineered a myristoylated 7 amino acid CCR10-binding domain (Myr-CBD7) peptide and showed that this can block eNOS interaction with CCR10, but not with calmodulin, resulting in upregulation of eNOS activity. Importantly, topical administration of Myr-CBD7 peptide on mouse dermal wounds not only blocked CCR10-eNOS interaction, but also enhanced expression of eNOS, CD31, and IL-4 with reduction of CCL28 and IL-6 levels associated with improved wound healing. These results point to a potential therapeutic strategy to upregulate NO bioavailability, enhance angiogenesis, and improve wound healing by disrupting CCL28-activated CCR10-eNOS interaction."
https://openalex.org/W3009743998,"Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) is a complex model of host/virus relationship. Disease control measures often includes “acclimatization”, i.e. the exposure of PRRS-naïve gilts and sows to PRRSV-infected pigs and premises before the breeding period. In this respect, we had repeatedly observed an association between PRRSV-specific IgA responses in oral fluids (OF) of gilts and block of PRRSV spread. Therefore, we set out to investigate in vitro the inhibition of PRRSV replication by OF samples with different titers of PRRSV-specific IgA and IgG antibody, using Real-time RT PCR. PRRSV yield reduction in monocyte-derived macrophages was associated with the IgA content in OF samples, whereas the IgG-rich samples were sometimes associated with antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of replication. Accordingly, we could discriminate between ADE-positive and ADE-negative PRRSV strains. Next, we separated Ig isotypes in OF samples of PRRSV-infected pigs by means of protein A and size exclusion chromatography. The above results were confirmed by using separated Ig isotypes. Both dimeric and monomeric IgA were associated with the strongest reduction of PRRSV replication. The treatment of pig macrophages with separated OF antibodies before PRRSV infection was also associated with PRRSV yield reduction, along with clear changes of both CD163 and CD169 surface expression. Our results point at a role of mucosal IgA in the control of PRRSV replication by extra- and/or intracellular interaction with PRRSV, as well as by induction of signals leading to a reduced susceptibility of macrophages to PRRSV infection."
https://openalex.org/W3009627174,"Alpha adrenergic stimulation is known to produce vasoconstriction. We have earlier shown that, in spiral strips of small arteries Phenylephrine (PE) caused vasorelaxation under high nitric oxide (NO) environment. However, on further experimentation it was realized that the PE-induced vasorelaxant response occurred only with longitudinal strips of small arteries even under normal NO environment while circular strips showed contraction with PE even under high NO environment. Such PE-induced vasorelaxation of longitudinal strips was blocked by Phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic receptor blocker. On delineation of specific receptor subtype, PE-induced relaxation was found to be mediated through alpha 1D receptor. However, this phenomenon is specific to small artery, as longitudinal smooth muscle of aorta showed only contractile response to adrenergic stimulation. There is no prior report of longitudinal smooth muscle in small artery up to our knowledge. The results of this study and histological examination of vessel sections suggest the presence of longitudinal smooth muscle in small artery and their relaxant response to alpha adrenergic stimulation is a novel phenomenon."

However, little is known about how removing the outer table may affect the function and structure of the inner table, and how the knowledge of the biomechanics and material properties of cortical bones will help the calvarial graft to better integrate into the biological and mechanical functions of its surrounding native tissues. In this study, it was hypothesized that there were significant differences in both density and material properties between inner and outer cortical plates in cranial bones. Twelve cylindrical specimens, including inner-outer layers, of cortical parietal bone of a female baboon were collected. Cortical thicknesses and densities were measured, and elastic properties were assessed using an ultrasonic technique. Results demonstrated remarkable difference in both thickness (t = 8.248, p ≤0.05) and density (t = 4.926, p≤0.05) between inner and outer cortical paired samples. Orthotropic characteristics of the cortical plates were detected as well, these findings suggest that there are differences in biomechanical properties between two surfaces of cranial bones at both tissue and organ levels. How these differences are linked to the stress environments of the inner and outer cranial cortical layers awaits further studies. Further study will greatly enhance our ability to address questions derived from both morphological and craniofacial medicine fields about the development and biomechanics of craniofacial skeletons."
https://openalex.org/W3009154230,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a virulent pathogen that has become more threatening with the emergence of multidrug resistance. The aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) of this organism is a dodecamer comprised of six 37 kDa catalytic chains and six 45 kDa chains homologous to dihydroorotase (pDHO). The pDHO chain is inactive but is necessary for ATCase activity. A stoichiometric mixture of the subunits associates into a dodecamer with full ATCase activity. Unlike other known ATCases, the P. aeruginosa catalytic chain does not spontaneously assemble into a trimer. Chemical-crosslinking and size-exclusion chromatography showed that P. aeruginosa ATCase is monomeric which accounts for its lack of catalytic activity since the active site is a composite comprised of residues from adjacent monomers in the trimer. Circular dichroism spectroscopy indicated that the ATCase chain adopts a structure that contains secondary structure elements although neither the ATCase nor the pDHO subunits are very stable as determined by a thermal shift assay. Formation of the complex increases the melting temperature by about 30°C. The ATCase is strongly inhibited by all nucleotide di- and triphosphates and exhibits extreme cooperativity. Previous studies suggested that the regulatory site is located in an 11-residue extension of the amino end of the catalytic chain. However, deletion of the extensions did not affect catalytic activity, nucleotide inhibition or the assembly of the dodecamer. Nucleotides destabilized the dodecamer which probably accounts for the inhibition and apparent cooperativity of the substrate saturation curves. Contrary to previous interpretations, these results suggest that P. aeruginosa ATCase is not allosterically regulated by nucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W3009829356,"The core element of machine learning is a flexible, universal function approximator that can be trained and fit into the data. One of the main challenges in modern machine learning is to understand the role of nonlinearity and complexity in these universal function approximators. In this research, we focus on nonlinear complex systems, and show their capability in representation and learning of different functions. Complex nonlinear dynamics and chaos naturally yield an almost infinite diversity of dynamical behaviors and functions. Physical, biological and engineered systems can utilize this diversity to implement adaptive, robust behaviors and operations. A nonlinear dynamical system can be considered as an embodiment of a collection of different possible behaviors or functions, from which different behaviors or functions can be chosen as a response to different conditions or problems. This process of selection can be manual in the sense that one can manually pick and choose the right function through directly setting parameters. Alternatively, we can automate the process and allow the system itself learn how to do it. This creates an approach to machine learning, wherein the nonlinear dynamics represents and embodies different possible functions, and it learns through training how to pick the right function from this function space. We report on how we utilized nonlinear dynamics and chaos to design and fabricate nonlinear dynamics based, morphable hardware in silicon as a physical embodiment for different possible functions. We demonstrate how this flexible, morphable hardware learns through learning and searching algorithms such as genetic algorithm to implement different desired functions. In this approach, we combine two powerful natural and biological phenomenon, Darwinian evolution and nonlinear dynamics and chaos, as a dynamics-oriented approach to designing intelligent, adaptive systems with applications. Nonlinear dynamics embodies different functions at the hardware level, while an evolutionary method is utilized in order to find the parameters to implement the right function."
https://openalex.org/W3009723171,"The voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.5 plays important roles in atrial repolarization and regulation of vascular tone. In the present study, we investigated the effects of mechanical stretch on Kv1.5 channels. We induced mechanical stretch by centrifuging or culturing Kv1.5-expressing HEK 293 cells and neonatal rat ventricular myocytes in low osmolarity (LO) medium and then recorded Kv1.5 current (IKv1.5) in a normal, isotonic solution. We observed that mechanical stretch increased IKv1.5, and this increase required the intact, long, proline-rich extracellular S1–S2 linker of the Kv1.5 channel. The low osmolarity–induced IKv1.5 increase also required an intact intracellular N terminus, which contains the binding motif for endogenous Src tyrosine kinase that constitutively inhibits IKv1.5. Disrupting the Src-binding motif of Kv1.5 through N-terminal truncation or mutagenesis abolished the mechanical stretch-mediated increase in IKv1.5. Our results further showed that the extracellular S1–S2 linker of Kv1.5 communicates with the intracellular N terminus. Although the S1–S2 linker of WT Kv1.5 could be cleaved by extracellularly applied proteinase K (PK), an N-terminal truncation up to amino acid residue 209 altered the conformation of the S1–S2 linker and made it no longer susceptible to proteinase K–mediated cleavage. In summary, the findings of our study indicate that the S1–S2 linker of Kv1.5 represents a mechanosensor that regulates the activity of this channel. By targeting the S1–S2 linker, mechanical stretch may induce a change in the N-terminal conformation of Kv1.5 that relieves Src-mediated tonic channel inhibition and results in an increase in IKv1.5."
https://openalex.org/W3009295847,"Much effort has been invested in the identification of protein-protein interactions using text mining and machine learning methods. The extraction of functional relationships between chemical compounds and proteins from literature has received much less attention, and no ready-to-use open-source software is so far available for this task.We created a new benchmark dataset of 2,613 sentences from abstracts containing annotations of proteins, small molecules, and their relationships. Two kernel methods were applied to classify these relationships as functional or non-functional, named shallow linguistic and all-paths graph kernel. Furthermore, the benefit of interaction verbs in sentences was evaluated.The cross-validation of the all-paths graph kernel (AUC value: 84.6%, F1 score: 79.0%) shows slightly better results than the shallow linguistic kernel (AUC value: 82.5%, F1 score: 77.2%) on our benchmark dataset. Both models achieve state-of-the-art performance in the research area of relation extraction. Furthermore, the combination of shallow linguistic and all-paths graph kernel could further increase the overall performance slightly. We used each of the two kernels to identify functional relationships in all PubMed abstracts (29 million) and provide the results, including recorded processing time.The software for the tested kernels, the benchmark, the processed 29 million PubMed abstracts, all evaluation scripts, as well as the scripts for processing the complete PubMed database are freely available at https://github.com/KerstenDoering/CPI-Pipeline."
https://openalex.org/W3009661454,"In clinical trials and observational studies, the effect of an intervention or exposure can be reported as an absolute or relative comparative measure such as risk difference, odds ratio or risk ratio, or at the group level with the estimated risk of disease in each group. For meta-analysis of results with covariate adjustment, the log of the odds ratio (log odds ratio), with its standard error, is a commonly used measure of effect. However, extracting the adjusted log odds ratio from the reported estimates of disease risk in each group is not straightforward. Here, we propose a method to transform the adjusted probability of the event in each group to the log of the odds ratio and obtain the appropriate (approximate) standard error, which can then be used in a meta-analysis. We also use example data to compare our method with two other methods and show that our method is superior in calculating the standard error of the log odds ratio."
https://openalex.org/W3009731640,"Background Mutations in the human desmin gene (DES) cause autosomal-dominant and -recessive cardiomyopathies, leading to heart failure, arrhythmias, and AV blocks. We analyzed the effects of vascular pressure overload in a patient-mimicking p.R349P desmin knock-in mouse model that harbors the orthologue of the frequent human DES missense mutation p.R350P. Methods and results Transverse aortic constriction (TAC) was performed on heterozygous (HET) DES-p.R349P mice and wild-type (WT) littermates. Echocardiography demonstrated reduced left ventricular ejection fraction in HET-TAC (WT-sham: 69.5 ± 2.9%, HET-sham: 64.5 ± 4.7%, WT-TAC: 63.5 ± 4.9%, HET-TAC: 55.7 ± 5.4%; p<0.01). Cardiac output was significantly reduced in HET-TAC (WT sham: 13088 ± 2385 μl/min, HET sham: 10391 ± 1349μl/min, WT-TAC: 8097 ± 1903μl/min, HET-TAC: 5793 ± 2517μl/min; p<0.01). Incidence and duration of AV blocks as well as the probability to induce ventricular tachycardias was highest in HET-TAC. We observed reduced mtDNA copy numbers in HET-TAC (WT-sham: 12546 ± 406, HET-sham: 13526 ± 781, WT-TAC: 11155 ± 3315, HET-TAC: 8649 ± 1582; p = 0.025), but no mtDNA deletions. The activity of respiratory chain complexes I and IV showed the greatest reductions in HET-TAC. Conclusion Pressure overload in HET mice aggravated the clinical phenotype of cardiomyopathy and resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction. Preventive avoidance of pressure overload/arterial hypertension in desminopathy patients might represent a crucial therapeutic measure."
https://openalex.org/W3009786437,"Labeling substrates or products are paramount in determining enzymatic kinetic parameters. Several options are available; many laboratories use either radioactive or fluorescent labeling because of their high sensitivity. However, those methods have their own drawbacks such as half-life decay, expensive and hazardous. Here, we propose a novel, simple, economical and fast alternative to substrate labeling for studying the kinetics of nucleic acids: post-migration gel staining with SYBR Gold. Cleavage rates similar to the ones reported in the literature for the I-R3 DNA-cleaving DNA enzyme in the presence of zinc chloride are an indication of the quality of the new method. Moreover, the activity of the hammerhead ribozyme was also monitored by our method to illustrate its versatility. This labeling-free method has several advantages such as its ease of use as well as cost effective and versatility with both non-structured and structured RNAs or DNAs."
https://openalex.org/W3010289962,"Understanding demographic parameters such as survival is important for scientifically sound wildlife management. Survival can vary by region, sex, age-class, habitat, and other factors. White-tailed deer fawn survival is highly variable across the species’ range. While recent studies have investigated fawn survival in several Midwestern states, there have been no published estimates from Iowa for 30 years. We radio-collared 48 fawns in central Iowa from 2015–2017 to estimate survival, home range size, and habitat composition and identity causes of mortality. Estimated fawn survival (± SE) was similar to other Midwest studies at 30 (0.78 ± 0.07)) and 60 days (0.69 ± 0.08), but considerably lower at 7 months (0.31 ± 0.02). Survival was positively associated with woodland habitat through 30 and 60 days, but not related to habitat at 7 months. Female fawns avoided agricultural habitat in their home ranges. Fawn 95% kernel density home ranges were smaller than in other studies in the Midwest (21.22 ± 2.74 ha at 30 days, 25.47 ± 2.87 ha at 60 days, and 30.59 ± 2.37 ha at 7 months). The large amount of woodland and grassland (>90%) in our study area meant that fawns did not have to travel far to find suitable cover, which may explain their small home ranges. We recorded 21 mortalities, the leading cause of which was disease (n = 9; 56% epizootic hemorrhagic disease [EHD]) followed by suspected predation (4) and harvest (3). The mortality associated with an outbreak of EHD in 2016, all of which occurred after 60 days post-capture, is the most likely explanation for our low survival estimate at 7 months. While predation, usually early in life, is the leading cause of mortality in most studies, sporadic diseases like EHD can be a major source of mortality in older fawns in some years."
