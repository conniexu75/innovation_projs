https://openalex.org/W1493030029,"Abstract Retinol circulates in rat plasma bound to a specific protein, retinol-binding protein (RBP). A radioimmunoassay for rat RBP was developed with a double antibody precipitation technique. The immunoassay accurately measures RBP in amounts of 0.5 to 3 ng per assay tube. There was no significant difference in the immunoreactivity of apo-RBP as compared to holo-RBP. Using this assay, a study was conducted to examine the effects of vitamin A depletion and deficiency, and of repletion, on the level of serum RBP, in order to explore the role of nutritional vitamin A status in the regulation of RBP metabolism. Weanling rats were divided into five groups, each fed a vitamin A-deficient diet with or without supplements as follows: Group 1, control: supplemented with vitamin A; Group 2, pair-fed control: supplemented with vitamin A but with food intake matched to that of the deficient rats; Group 3, deficient: no vitamin A supplementation; Groups 4 and 5, retinoic acid: supplemented, after the initial depletion period, with a modest daily dose (14 or 28 µg) of retinoic acid. The rats were studied for 75 days. In the deficient group the serum vitamin A levels decreased gradually during the first 25 to 30 days of the study, to levels of about 2 µg/100 ml. Serum RBP levels also declined during the induction of vitamin A deficiency, with a time course similar to that seen for vitamin A, but with a lag of about 3 days (from 50 ± 4 µg per ml on Day 3 to 20 ± 2 µg per ml at Day 27, and then more slowly to 13 ± 2 µg per ml at Day 75). After 3 to 4 weeks most of the circulating RBP was present as the apoprotein, not containing a molecule of bound retinol. The results obtained with the retinoic acid-fed rats, who continued to grow normally, were identical with those of the deficient rats. In contrast both the pair-fed and ad libitum control groups exhibited no major changes in either serum vitamin A or RBP, throughout the entire study. Liver homogenates were immunoreactive, and generated immunoassay curves which were indistinguishable from those obtained with pure rat RBP. The level of immunoreactive RBP in the livers of deficient rats was 4 times (p l 0.001) that in the livers of control rats. When vitamin A was administered orally to deficient rats on Day 53, a very rapid increase in serum RBP level, from a mean of 14 to 56 µg per ml, was seen within 5 hours (the first time interval sampled). These findings suggest that vitamin A deficiency primarily interferes in some way with the secretion, rather than with the synthesis, of RBP by the liver, and that the deficient liver contains a pool of previously formed apo-RBP which can be released rapidly into the serum, as holo-RBP, when vitamin A becomes available."

https://openalex.org/W1560804515,"Abstract Livers from nonfasted rats were perfused in situ with concentrations of valine (plus [1-14C]valine) in the medium ranging from 0.3 to 15 mm. The relationship of total free intracellular valine (y) to external valine (x) was of the form y = a + bx, where the slope was about 1.0 and the intercept nearly 0.4 mm. At low valine concentrations the ratio of intracellular to extracellular valine, after isotopic equilibrium was attained, was less than 0.5; as external valine was increased, the ratio increased and approached unity. These findings suggested that the intracellular valine pool comprised two components, one which readily equilibrated with extracellular valine and another which was independent of external valine. Rates of valine incorporation into liver protein, calculated from the average specific activity of total intracellular valine, were not constant over the concentration range of external valine, as expected, but were 2- to 3-fold greater at the lowest concentrations than at the highest levels. This lack of constancy was explained by assuming that the two valine components represented two separate pools and that precursor sites of protein synthesis were in continuity with the expandable or equilibrating pool. Thus if label transported inward from the medium were restricted to the expandable pool, its specific activity and that of precursor amino acids would be higher than the determined specific activity of total intracellular valine. Recalculation of valine incorporation, based on the presumed specific activity of the expandable pool, gave uniform rates at all external valine concentrations. The second or nonexpandable pool, which apparently failed to equilibrate with label in the medium, was thought to arise from intracellular proteolysis since total intracellular and extracellular specific activities were the same when the only source of free label was the breakdown of protein in perfused livers that had been previously labeled with [1-14C]valine in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1599717497,"Phagocytosis of polystyrene latex beads by mouse peritoneal macrophages results in the interiorization of large amounts of plasma membrane to form the phagolysosomal membrane. The isolated membrane of the phagolysosomes is initially similar to the plasma membrane in cholesterol and phospholipid content, and carries 5′-nucleotidase activity with the characteristics of the plasma membrane marker enzyme. Immediately after ingestion, the amount of the plasma membrane has descreased as judged by a reduction in cell volume, spreading, pinocytosis, and phagocytosis. During the next 6 hours, the phagolysosomal 5′-nucleotidase activity decreases with a half-life of about 2 hours. Total cellular 5′-nucleotidase also decreases to a degree accounted for by the decrease in the phagolysosomal enzyme and in proportion to the amount of latex interiorized. After a lag of about 6 hours, cellular levels of the membrane constituents cholesterol and phospholipid begin to increase. The final net increase is linearly proportional to the amount of latex initially ingested and to the amount of plasma membrane interiorized. Only at this time do the macrophages begin to spread out on the glass surface, resume pinocytosis, and regain the ability to phagocytize a new test particle. The cellular levels of 5′-nucleotidase also begin to increase reaching control levels by 10 to 12 hours after phagocytosis. This activity is not associated with the phagolysosomes. These changes suggest the net synthesis of plasma membrane to replace the membrane interiorized during phagocytosis. This synthesis requires the presence of exogenous cholesterol molecules for use in the membrane. In the absence of cholesterol, plasma membrane functions are not restored and 5′-nucleotidase activity does not return to control levels. The inhibition of protein and RNA synthesis after phagocytosis blocks the net increment in cellular cholesterol, phospholipid, and 5′-nucleotidase activity."

https://openalex.org/W2067184883,"Consideration of the steady-state equations for stable carbon monoxide and for radioactive carbon monoxide in the troposphere leads to the conclusion that carbon monoxide is produced at a rate of 5 × 1015 grams per year, a value some 25 times greater than the rate of carbon monoxide production from combustion. The concomitant residence time for carbon monoxide is 0.1 year, in agreement with a previous estimate of Weinstock. Hydroxyl radicals are shown to account for both the production of this large amount of carbon monoxide by methane oxidation and for its removal by carbon monoxide oxidation. The average concentration of hydroxyl radicals in the troposphere required to achieve this effect is 2.3 × 106 molecules per cubic centimeter, with a daytime concentration of twice that. Levy and McConnell, McElroy, and Wofsy have deduced concentrations of hydroxyl radicals in the troposphere of the same magnitude from purely photochemical considerations, in support of this model."
https://openalex.org/W1586198177,"Abstract Components A and B of the chick oviduct progesterone-binding protein system have been prepared by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. Both components are shown to bind [3H]progesterone in vivo and to accumulate in oviduct nuclei in vitro. Neither component preparation contains detectable enzymatic activity for metabolizing progesterone in vitro. Each component can enter nuclei separately where both are strongly retained bound to nuclear chromatin. In vitro assays for the interaction of the components with DNA and chromatin acidic proteins were used to study binding specificity of the components. Component A binds to DNA from several sources but Component B does not bind to DNA. Conversely, Component B binds to purified oviduct chromatin and retains target organ specificity, but Component A does not bind to purified chromatin. The two types of binding activity characteristic of crude cytosol progesterone receptor, namely, the association with DNA and with target cell chromatin proteins have thus been resolved and shown to reside in receptor Components A and B, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1968451870,Microorganisms from rumen converted L-tryptophan and indoleacetic acid to 3-methylindole in vitro. Oral doses of 3-methylindole caused interstitial pulmonary edema and emphysema in cattle and goats. Intravenous infusion of this metabolite also induced pulmonary disease in cattle. These results demonstrate than an end product of ruminal fermentation of tryptophan can induce acute pulmonary disease in cattle and goats.
https://openalex.org/W1483154502,"The pH dependence of the equilibrium and kinetics of ligand binding to carp hemolysate and the purified hemoglobin components of carp hemolysate with O2 and CO has been studied. The affinity of carp hemoglobin for O2 at alkaline pH is 160 times that at acid pH. A large but significantly different pH effect on the affinity for CO is observed. pH also has different effects on the kinetics of the reactions with the two ligands. The change in the rate of O2 dissociation over the pH range studied is 10 times that found for the rate of CO replacement by NO; and as previously reported, the change in the rate of combination of CO is twice that of O2. The value of n in the Hill equation is pH-dependent for both ligands, being maximal at neutral pH and decreasing as the pH is shifted from neutrality. This decrease in the value of n is shown to be due not to heterogeneity in the carp hemoglobin but to be the result of an apparent decrease in the cooperativity of the ligand-binding reaction. At pH 5.6 and below, the value of n is 1.0 for CO and 0.75 for O2 indicating no cooperativity. Below pH 5.6 and above pH 8.0, all equilibrium and kinetic constants are found to be unaffected by further pH changes. These results and the low, constant values of n are consistent with the hypothesis that at acid pH, carp hemoglobin, whether liganded or not, remains in a single low affinity conformation, perhaps that normally associated with the deoxygenated state. The hemoglobin appears to approach a similar situation at alkaline pH where the molecule has a high affinity similar to that of the ligand-saturated state."

https://openalex.org/W2089049165,"Inhalation of dichloromethane vapor in concentrations of 500 to 1000 parts per million for 1 to 2 hours promptly initiated the formation of significant quantities of carbon monoxide in human subjects. The evidence suggests that carbon monoxide may be a metabolite of dichloromethane and, that exposure to concentrations of dichloromethane below the industrial threshold limit values may result in the formation of carbon monoxide in amounts that exceed the allowable limits."
https://openalex.org/W2084318067,"Concentrations of immunoglobulin M in serum were one-third higher in females than in males in the Black and White populations of Virginia. In family studies, a much closer correlation was shown between boys and their mothers than between boys and their fathers. The immunoglobulin M concentrations in girls were more closely correlated with those of their fathers than with those of their mothers. The higher mean values for IgM in females and the relative magnitudes of the correlation coefficients between parents and offspring support the hypothesis that the X chromosome of man carries genes with an effect on IgM concentration. These patterns were not demonstrated for immunoglobulins A or G."
https://openalex.org/W1541221065,"Abstract Salt-soluble elastin was extracted from the aortas of copper-deficient pigs and purified to homogeneity as judged by ultracentrifugation, disc electrophoresis, and amino acid analysis. Purification took advantage of the differing solubilities of glycoproteins, salt-soluble collagen, and salt-soluble elastin in salt solutions of differing ionic strength, pH, and temperature. The amino acid composition of this protein is like that of insoluble elastin with the exceptions of a higher lysine content and the absence of cross-linking amino acids in the former. Analyses excluded the presence of α-amino adipic δ-semialdehyde, neutral sugars, glucosamine, galactosamine, tryptophan, cysteine, cystine, methionine, and histidine. The protein exhibits cationic behavior during electrophoresis at pH 8.9, consistent with its content of lysine as the predominant polar amino acid. Salt-soluble elastin has a subunit molecular weight of 74,000 as judged by sedimentation equilibrium in 6 m guanidine-mercaptoethanol. It is proposed that this protein is a precursor of insoluble elastin."

https://openalex.org/W1555417301,"Abstract Bovine Factor VIII (antihemophilic factor) has been purified approximately 10,000-fold with an over-all yield of 10 to 15%. The purification procedure involves BaSO4, kaolin, and bentonite adsorption to remove contaminants, ethanol, polyethylene glycol, and β-alanine fractionation, calcium citrate-cellulose chromatography, concanavalin A precipitation, and an Agarose gel filtration step. The final product is homogeneous when examined by gel filtration, density gradient centrifugation, and zone electrophoresis. It also shows a single precipitin line when subjected to immunoelectrophoresis employing a specific rabbit antibody against Factor VIII. However, when examined by sedimentation equilibrium, the preparation is physically heterogeneous, apparently due to substantial aggregation of the protein. In these experiments, the smallest species which could be calculated has a molecular weight of approximately 1.1 million. After reduction in 2-mercaptoethanol, the protein shows one band in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and zone electrophoresis and a reduction in size. The smallest species of the reduced protein has a molecular weight of about 85,000. The protein contains approximately 11% hexose, 2% sialic acid, 7% hexosamine, and no lipid. Other general properties of this protein including its amino acid composition are also reported."

Additional signs include angiokeratoma corporis diffusum and anhydrosis. The skin lesion is due to an accumulation of residual bodies, presumably containing oligosaccharides and glycoproteins, in endothelial cells and fibrocytes. The enzyme activity in blood relatives indicates that the disease is inherited as a simple autosomal recessive trait that segregates according to Mendelian principles. Because the enzyme activity in the heterozygotes was consistently below that of normal controls, the carriers of the trait in this family could be ascertained."
https://openalex.org/W2073784354,"The average steady-state contamination of groundwater by road salt in the suburban area around Boston, on the assumption that current rates of application of salt will continue, is about 160 milligrams of sodium chloride per liter of water (100 milligrams of chloride per liter). This value is compared with values of 50 to 100 milligrams of chloride per liter found rather commonly now in town wells in eastern Massachusetts. These salt concentrations may be of concern to persons on low-sodium diets and to persons who obtain water from wells in the vicinity of major highways where salt concentrations could be several times higher than average."
https://openalex.org/W1483228873,"The principal neurotoxin of the cobra, Naja naja siamensis (Naja naja kaouthis), was purified by chromatography on, successively, phosphocellulose, Sephadex G-50, and carboxymethylcellulose. A 4 3/10-fold increase in specific toxicity was obtained. The product was shown to be homogeneous by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 4.3 and pH 7.0. Antibodies to the toxin were prepared by inoculating rabbits with toxin adsorbed onto bentonite. The neurotoxin was radioactively labeled by reaction with pyridoxal phosphate, followed by reduction of the Schiff's base with tritiated sodium borohydride. Two radioactive toxin derivatives were purified and separated from untreated toxin by phosphocellulose chromatography. A specific activity of 2 Ci per millimole has been obtained by this method. Pyridoxal phosphate-coupled toxin was identified by strong fluorescence emission at 395 nm upon excitation at 331 nm. Labeled toxin retained 50% of its original potency and was shown to block the action of acetylcholine at the motor end plate. In this respect, the pharmacological properties of the toxin remained unchanged by the labeling reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1485571171,"Abstract The regulation of heme biosynthesis has been studied in cultured avian hepatocytes utilizing a specific and sensitive assay for the rate-limiting enzyme in the pathway, δ-aminolevulinic acid synthetase. This enzyme appears to be induced by 2-allyl-2-isopropylacetamide, a drug known to produce experimental porphyria, and by inhibitors of heme synthesis such as lead acetate. However, 2-allyl-2-isopropylacetamide and lead acetate appear to induce δ-aminolevulinic acid synthetase by different mechanisms since inhibitors of protein synthesis at the transcriptional level block induction by 2-allyl-2-isopropylacetamide but not block induction by lead acetate. Furthermore, induction by the two chemicals is synergistic. Addition of the end product of the pathway, heme, and the heme precursor, δ-aminolevulinic acid, prevents induction by 2-allyl-2-isopropylacetamide and lead acetate. These data further support the role of heme as the natural repressor of δ-aminolevulinic acid synthetase. Experiments with inhibitors of protein synthesis are consistent with a translational site for heme repression. A mechanism whereby drugs may induce δ-aminolevulinic acid synthetase by interfering with heme synthesis is demonstrated. The relevance of these observations to the biochemical aberration characterizing the human genetic disease, intermittent acute porphyria, is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1546491005,"Abstract A glycosyl asparagine unit, Asn-(GlcNAc)2(Man)1, was isolated from ovalbumin by proteolytic and glycosidase digestion. The terminal disaccharide d-Man (1 → 4)-GlcNAc, released by an endoglycosidase partially purified from chitinase, was shown by optical rotatory dispersion, infrared analysis, and gas chromatography to possess the characteristics of a β-mannosidic linkage. The chemical data thus confirm the enzyme studies which demonstrated the specific cleavage of this bond by a hen oviduct β-mannosidase (Sukeno, T., Tarentino, A. L., Plummer, T. H., Jr., and Maley, F. (1971) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 45, 219). The endoglycosidase also hydrolyzed the parent ovalbumin glycosyl asparagine unit, Asn-(GlcNAc)4(Man)6, to Asn-GlcNAc and the oligosaccharide (Man)6(GlcNAc)3. Smith degradation verified the presence of N-acetyl-d-glucosamine on the reducing end of the oligosaccharide with the mannosyl units linked to C4, or C3 and C4. These results suggest, in contrast to previous findings, that the polymannosyl unit of the ovalbumin oligosaccharide is associated with the distal and not the proximal end of di-N-acetylchitobiose."
https://openalex.org/W1594724343,"Abstract Plasma membranes of a high degree of purity have been prepared from isolated adipose cells of rat epididymal fat pads. d-[3H]Glucose uptake by the membranes has been measured with a Millipore filtration technique, with l-[14C]glucose serving as a marker for nonspecific uptake or trapping of the sugars. The plasma membrane preparation shows glucose transport as evidenced by the following: (a) d-glucose is both taken up and released more rapidly than l-glucose, (b) countertransport of d-glucose can be shown, (c) with prolonged incubations, d- and l-glucose uptake reach equilibrium at the same level. The uptake of d-glucose is inhibited by a low concentration of phlorizin and higher concentrations of 2-deoxyglucose and 3-O-methyl glucose, but not by l-glucose or fructose. It is greatly inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide. Cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate and its dibutyryl derivative, ATP, AMP, glucose 6-phosphate, glucose 1-phosphate, fructose 1,6-diphosphate have no appreciable effect. Glucose appears to be taken up or transported into a relatively impermeable intravesicular space. Exposure of the membranes to increasing sucrose concentrations leads to osmotic shrinkage and decreased glucose uptake. We conclude that the glucose transport system remains intact in isolated plasma membranes and can be studied in the absence of other cell components."
https://openalex.org/W1534162751,"Abstract A detailed re-examination of the relationship between the value of the Hill constant, n, and the partial pressure necessary for oxygenation of half the hemoglobin, p50, indicates that there is a slight dependence of n on p50 for normal human hemoglobin. The value of n varies between 2.3 and 3.1 over a 50-fold variation in the value of p50 (from 0.5 to 25 mm Hg). Above values of 40 mm Hg for p50, the value of n decreases below 2. However, there is no obvious relationship between oxygen affinity and cooperativity. In fact, the Bohr effect and cooperativity are largely independent phenomena which means that the stabilizing interactions in hemoglobin are not related in any simple fashion to oxygen affinity."
https://openalex.org/W1538364149,"The different peptide groups of a structured protein display a wide range of hydrogen exchange rates covering perhaps 10 orders of magnitude. Consequently it is possible to study different structure changes within a protein by observing the exchange of kinetically distinct, therefore experimentally separable, groups of hydrogens. Two groups of hydrogens that show marked increase in exchange rate upon liganding of deoxyhemoglobin were found. The same effect occurs upon liganding by O2, CO, NO, and on oxidation of heme iron. The effect does not depend upon subunit dissociation. One responsive group involves about 2 hydrogens per subunit, the other something more than 8. The larger group, studied in some detail, represents hydrogen-bonded peptides that change their dynamic breathing behavior on liganding. The ligand-induced increase in kinetic reactivity of particular labile hydrogen sites in hemoglobin is closely analogous to the ligand-induced increase in kinetic reactivity of the heme binding sites associated with the allosteric phenomenon. The exchange of hydrogens between solvent water and masked protein sites is thought to be modulated by transitory, local denaturation or breathing reactions experienced by cooperative segments of protein structure. Accordingly, it is suggested that the movement of ligand between solvent and the apparently inaccessible heme binding sites may also be modulated by the breathing of such a segment, acting as a physical and a kinetic gate for ligand binding and dissociation reactions. Change in ligand binding affinity could then be accomplished simply by arranging to alter gate opening once ligand is bound."

https://openalex.org/W1590627095,"Abstract The subunit structure of tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase from beef pancreas (mol wt 108,000) has been studied by high speed and low speed equilibrium sedimentation, light scattering, gel electrophoresis, and gel filtration. All of these methods give a molecular weight of 58,000 ± 5,000 for the protein after denaturation in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride or in sodium dodecyl sulfate. Gel electrophoresis at different pH levels, after denaturation of the enzyme by 8 m urea or after dissociation by alkylation or oxidation of all of the —SH groups of the protein, shows a single polypeptide component; these data indicate that the subunits have the same molecular weight and the same charge. Hydrolysis of the sodium dodecyl sulfate-denatured protein by carboxypeptidases A and B indicates that the COOH-terminal sequence should be -Leu-Phe-Gln; these amino acids are liberated in a ratio close to 2 eq per molecule of native enzyme. By a tritium labeling method only one type of COOH-terminal residue is detected. No free NH2-terminal amino group can be detected. Gel electrophoresis and NH2-terminal group analysis of the cyanogen bromide digestion products and fingerprints of the tryptic peptides of the enzyme are in agreement with a chemical identity of the polypeptide chains obtained after denaturation. Since it has been shown that tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase can bind 2 molecules of substrate (tryptophan or tryptophanyl adenylate), and since no polypeptide chain of molecular weight smaller than half of that of the native enzyme could be obtained in any denaturing condition, it is concluded that this amino acid activating enzyme in its native state is a dimer made up of 2 identical subunits."

Gd2, prepared in this manner, is an acceptor of galactose from UDP-Gal when incubated with a particulate subcellular fraction from rat brain to form Gd1b. This reaction was studied and compared with an analogous reaction for the synthesis of ceramide-Glc-Gal(NeuAc)-GalNAc-Gal (Gm1) using ceramide-Glc-Gal(NeuAc)-GalNAc (Gm2) as acceptor of galactose. The results obtained in this comparative study suggest that Gd2 is an intermediate in the pathway of synthesis of Gd1b. Furthermore, the transfer of galactose in the two reactions appears to be catalyzed by the same enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1515321158,"Abstract Crystalline bovine or porcine glucagon was fractionated by chromatography on columns of DEAE-cellulose in the presence of buffers containing 7 m urea. About 89% of the recovered protein comprises highly purified glucagon; 10% is monodesamidoglucagon and another 0.8% resembles glucagon in amino acid composition and in electrophoretic mobility. The monodesamidoglucagon was identified and characterized largely by means of amino acid analysis, electrophoretic mobility, circular dichroic spectra, and enzymatic degradations. Deamidation appears to occur randomly on the three glutamines in positions 3, 20, and 24, giving a mixture of three isomers. The penultimate asparagine remained intact. Monodesamidoglucagon had less biological and immunological activity than glucagon and exhibited an altered circular dichroic spectrum; either covalent or conformational changes, or both, may be responsible for the decrease in activity."

https://openalex.org/W1582428756,"Abstract When NaCl concentration was lowered, membrane vesicle-bound menadione reductase of Halobacterium cutirubrum showed 6- to 7-fold increased activity. The enzyme with this increased activity was initially found in a transient, membrane-bound form, followed by release from the membranes. Several detergents caused solubilization and a similar increase in enzyme activity, but sodium dodecyl sulfate, which increased activity, gave only limited solubilization. Unlike mitochondrial DPNH dehydrogenase, the halophilic system showed only minor changes in substrate affinity upon these treatments. Conditions that resulted in highly active, membrane-bound enzyme also released trapped horseradish peroxidase, which had been added as a marker of the interior of these vesicles. These results suggest that menadione reductase is attached to the interior surface of the vesicles and becomes accessible to the substrates upon the breakage of the vesicles during the course of solubilization. Half of the menadione reductase content of the vesicles was released into the supernatant in 1 m NaCl but was still attached to large membrane fragments. As NaCl concentration was further lowered the enzyme in this fraction was detached and could be eluted from an Agarose column in a position corresponding to 36,000 molecular weight. In addition, at NaCl concentrations lower than 1 m, large membrane fragments containing the second portion of the enzyme were released. Tween 80 solubilized half of the total enzyme in the vesicles; the solubilized enzyme was eluted at 48,000 molecular weight, which probably corresponds to a protein-detergent complex. The sequential action of lowered NaCl concentration and Tween 80 resulted in the recovery of all the enzyme in this low molecular weight fraction."
https://openalex.org/W2161242744,"Abstract Human desialylated transcortin was found to be microheterogeneous by isoelectric focusing. All samples tested showed two cortisol-binding components. Liganded with cortisol these components are isoelectric at pH 5.2 and 5.4. In the unliganded form, however, they eluted at pH 5.4 and 5.6, respectively. This cortisol-controlled transition was reversible in both directions. Isolated components containing trace amounts of [3H]cortisol accumulate the steroid in the position of the corresponding liganded form at the anodic side of the unliganded binder. Electrofocusing of desialylated plasma containing [3H]cortisol results in a cortisol accumulation at pH 5.1 at the anodic side of the unliganded binding components. The experiments show that electrofocusing can profitably be used to study ligand-protein interactions and that radioligand detection is not always an adequate method to localize a macromolecular binding agent."

https://openalex.org/W1653499431,"Abstract The particulate enzyme fraction obtained from Micrococcus lysodeikticus catalyzed the incorporation of d-[14C]glucose from uridine diphospho-d-[14C]glucose into a polymer which resembled the d-glucose- and N-acetyl-d-mannosaminuronic acid-containing polysaccharide of the cell walls of this organism. In vitro biosynthesis of the polysaccharide depended upon the presence of the uridine diphospho-N-acetylhexosaminuronic acid fraction isolated from M. lysodeikticus and uridine diphospho-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine and was stimulated by a heat-stable factor obtained from the soluble fraction of cell extracts. The reaction proceeded optimally at pH 8.2 and at 20 mm magnesium ion concentration. The incorporation of d-[14C]glucose proceeded after a lag period of 15 to 20 min. Preincubation of the reaction components with the particulate enzyme fraction before the addition of uridine diphospho-d-glucose eliminated the lag period. [14C]N-Acetylhexosaminuronic acid residues were incorporated into polysaccharide from [14C]uridine diphospho-N-acetylhexosaminuronic acid (labeled throughout the molecule) in an amount approximately equimolar to d-glucose in a reaction dependent upon uridine diphospho-d-glucose. However, when uridine diphospho-N-[14C]acetyl-d-glucosamine was the labeled substrate, N-[14C]acetyl-d-glucosamine was incorporated only to the extent of 1 residue or less for each 15 residues of d-glucose."
https://openalex.org/W1504291756,"Abstract The sulfhydryl titration of hemoglobin - Rainier (α2β2145tyr→cys) suggests that the cysteine residue HC2(145)β forms a disulfide bridge with the cysteine F9(93)β of the same β chain. The oxygen equilibrium of Hb-Rainier compared with that of HbA exhibits diminished heme-heme interaction (n = 1.3–1.5), increased oxygen affinity, and a small Bohr effect. The absorption spectrum and the circular dichroism of the oxygenated form of Hb-Rainier are almost the same as those of HbA in the spectral region between 240 to 650 nm. In the deoxygenated form, however, the absorbance of Hb-Rainier at 430 nm is about 7% smaller than that of HbA, and in circular dichroism the ellipticities of the negative band at 285 nm and the positive extremum at 433 nm are much smaller than those for HbA. The isolated β chains of Hb-Rainier have an absorption spectrum similar to that of the β chains of HbA both in the oxygenated and deoxygenated forms except in the region between 250 and 270 nm. In circular dichroism, however, the oxygenated β chains of Hb-Rainier exhibit no positive band in the Soret region, and in the deoxygenated state, all heme bands are greatly diminished. These differences in oxygen equilibrium and circular dichroism between the hemoglobins, caused by the substitution of 145 tyrosine for cysteine, are discussed in relation to the structure and contact of subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1599650278,"Abstract Uptake of lysine, arginine, and ornithine by Pseudomonas putida P2 involves at least three transport systems. A lysine-inducible, general basic amino acid system (Km = 7.3 x 10-6 m; Vmax = 128 nmoles per min per mg for l-lysine) transports all three amino acids and is inhibited by the d or l isomers of all three amino acids (Miller, D. L., and Rodwell, V. W. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 1765) and by the next higher and lower homologs of l-arginine. Transport of l-arginine by the general system (Km = 4.8 x 10-6 m; Vmax = 67 nmoles per min per mg) is inhibited by the same compounds that inhibit l-lysine transport. A second system transports l-lysine (Km = 4.1 x 10-7 m; Vmax = 25 nmoles per min per mg) and l-ornithine (Km = 1.3 x 10-7 m; Vmax = 100 nmoles per min per mg) and is inhibited by d- or l-lysine, d- or l-ornithine, and by d-arginine, but not by l-arginine nor by other amino acids. l-Lysine and l-ornithine accumulate at ratios of intracellular to extracellular amino acid concentration of 750 and 18,000, respectively, suggesting that transport is an active process. Active transport of l-arginine by cells grown on l-arginine occurs via a low Km, l-arginine-specific system (Km = 5.2 x 10-8 m; Vmax = 11 nmoles per min per mg). Transport, which is not inhibited by any substrate analog tested, is linear for at least 7 min, is abolished by CN- or N3-, and generates ratios of internal to external arginine as high as 3350."
https://openalex.org/W1600380731,"Abstract The Micrococcus luteus DNA polymerase possesses a 5' to 3' exonuclease activity which is an integral part of the polymerase protein. The 5' to 3' exonuclease preferentially degrades double stranded DNA and yields a mixture of mononucleotides, dinucleotides, and trinucleotides as products. This spectrum of products is found for double stranded substrates of the following types: poly(deoxypurine)·poly(deoxypyrimidine); poly(deoxypurine-deoxypyrimidine)·poly(deoxypurine-deoxypyrimidine) as well as native DNA. The relative proportion of these degradation products depends on the base sequence of the DNA substrate and the reaction pH. The M. luteus DNA polymerase also possesses a 3' to 5' exonuclease activity which yields mononucleotides as products and is approximately 10 times more active than the 5' to 3' exonuclease with a single stranded poly(dT) substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1550255456,"Abstract Some properties of the quickly reacting hemoglobin generated by partial photodissociation of human CO hemoglobin have been studied using flash photolysis methods. The absorption spectrum of the rapidly reacting photoproduct is different from that of slowly reacting normal hemoglobin and, similarly to other quickly reacting forms, corresponds to that of isolated deoxyhemoglobin chains. The fraction of the fast reacting material increases linearly with the fraction of nonphotodissociated hemoglobin. On the basis of these results and of other information on hemoglobin kinetics it is suggested that this fast reacting species represents partially saturated intermediate which appears transiently when the ligand is suddenly removed from ligand-bound hemoglobin."

The observed synergistic effect between ethanol and the amino acids is probably not related to an alteration of ethanol metabolism, but rather to an interaction of these compounds in the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2114576584,"Abstract Uridine diphospho-N-acetyl-d-mannosaminuronic acid and uridine diphospho-N-acetyl-d-glucosaminuronic acid were prepared chemically by the platinum-oxygen oxidation of uridine diphospho-N-acetyl-d-mannosamine and uridine diphospho-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, respectively. In vitro incorporation of d-[14C]glucose from uridine diphospho-d-[14C]glucose into cell wall polysaccharide by the particulate enzyme fraction from Micrococcus lysodeikticus was dependent upon uridine diphospho-N-acetyl-d-mannosaminuronic acid. No polysaccharide was formed when uridine diphospho-N-acetyl-d-glucosaminuronic acid was supplied to the incorporation system in place of uridine diphospho-N-acetyl-d-mannosaminuronic acid. The particulate enzyme fraction also synthesized polysaccharide when supplied with the uridine diphospho-N-acetylhexosaminuronic acid preparation isolated from M. lysodeikticus cells. The isolated uridine diphospho-N-acetylhexosaminuronic acid preparations have been shown to be a mixture of two compounds, probably uridine diphospho-N-acetyl-d-mannosaaminuronic acid and uridine diphospho-N-acetyl-d-glucosaminuronic acid."

https://openalex.org/W1579134738,"Abstract 1. Two dyes, bromocresol purple and ethyl red, were tested for their ability to register solution and membrane changes resulting from the illumination of suspensions of isolated chloroplasts. 2. Bromocresol purple can measure the external (suspension) pH both rapidly and accurately if the following precautions are observed: (a) since bromocresol purple stimulates electron flow to oxygen, either low concentrations (≤ 2 µm) of bromocresol purple or conditions for noncyclic electron transport must be used; (b) the absorbance shifts must be converted by formula to yield changes in proton concentration. 3. The disappearance of protons from the medium when the light is turned on is bi-exponential with half-times of about 0.7 s and 8 s. The release of protons into the medium when the light is turned off is exponential with a decay half-time of about 30 s. 4. A brief initial lag (l0.2 s) in the uptake of protons follows the onset of illumination, and there is a lag of up to 1 s in the release of protons at the end of illumination. These data suggest the presence of an intermediate pool between electron flow and proton movement. 5. One of the major components of the ethyl red response in buffered suspensions is a band shift, which is thought to represent a change in the position of ethyl red within the membrane resulting from illumination. These responses seem related to the state of coupling of the photosynthetic membrane and could serve as a sensitive indicator thereof. 6. The time relationship between ethyl red and bromocresol purple responses shows that changes in the membrane (ethyl red response) continue after the establishment of the steady state pH shift in the light. 7. Bromocresol purple and ethyl red offer promise as investigative tools for events linked to energy transduction in thylakoids."
