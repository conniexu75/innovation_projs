https://openalex.org/W2168442336,"Wrapping of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) was found to be sequence-dependent. A systematic search of the ssDNA library selected a sequence d(GT)n, n = 10 to 45 that self-assembles into a helical structure around individual nanotubes in such a way that the electrostatics of the DNA-CNT hybrid depends on tube diameter and electronic properties, enabling nanotube separation by anion exchange chromatography. Optical absorption and Raman spectroscopy show that early fractions are enriched in the smaller diameter and metallic tubes, whereas late fractions are enriched in the larger diameter and semiconducting tubes."
https://openalex.org/W1965696184,"An array of aligned carbon nanotubes (CNTs) was incorporated across a polymer film to form a well-ordered nanoporous membrane structure. This membrane structure was confirmed by electron microscopy, anisotropic electrical conductivity, gas flow, and ionic transport studies. The measured nitrogen permeance was consistent with the flux calculated by Knudsen diffusion through nanometer-scale tubes of the observed microstructure. Data on Ru(NH3)6(3+) transport across the membrane in aqueous solution also indicated transport through aligned CNT cores of the observed microstructure. The lengths of the nanotubes within the polymer film were reduced by selective electrochemical oxidation, allowing for tunable pore lengths. Oxidative trimming processes resulted in carboxylate end groups that were readily functionalized at the entrance to each CNT inner core. Membranes with CNT tips that were functionalized with biotin showed a reduction in Ru(NH3)6(3+) flux by a factor of 15 when bound with streptavidin, thereby demonstrating the ability to gate molecular transport through CNT cores for potential applications in chemical separations and sensing."
https://openalex.org/W2029388127,"The conserved histone variant H2AZ has an important role in the regulation of gene expression and the establishment of a buffer to the spread of silent heterochromatin. How histone variants such as H2AZ are incorporated into nucleosomes has been obscure. We have found that Swr1, a Swi2/Snf2-related adenosine triphosphatase, is the catalytic core of a multisubunit, histone-variant exchanger that efficiently replaces conventional histone H2A with histone H2AZ in nucleosome arrays. Swr1 is required for the deposition of histone H2AZ at specific chromosome locations in vivo, and Swr1 and H2AZ commonly regulate a subset of yeast genes. These findings define a previously unknown role for the adenosine triphosphate-dependent chromatin remodeling machinery."
https://openalex.org/W1983534546,"Twentieth-century water policies relied on the construction of massive infrastructure in the form of dams, aqueducts, pipelines, and complex centralized treatment plants to meet human demands. These facilities brought tremendous benefits to billions of people, but they also had serious and often unanticipated social, economical, and ecological costs. Many unsolved water problems remain, and past approaches no longer seem sufficient. A transition is under way to a ""soft path"" that complements centralized physical infrastructure with lower cost community-scale systems, decentralized and open decision-making, water markets and equitable pricing, application of efficient technology, and environmental protection."
https://openalex.org/W2093355627,"A hallmark of aging is diminished regenerative potential of tissues, but the mechanism of this decline is unknown. Analysis of injured muscle revealed that, with age, resident precursor cells (satellite cells) had a markedly impaired propensity to proliferate and to produce myoblasts necessary for muscle regeneration. This was due to insufficient up-regulation of the Notch ligand Delta and, thus, diminished activation of Notch in aged, regenerating muscle. Inhibition of Notch impaired regeneration of young muscle, whereas forced activation of Notch restored regenerative potential to old muscle. Thus, Notch signaling is a key determinant of muscle regenerative potential that declines with age."
https://openalex.org/W1989797392,"Vancomycin is usually reserved for treatment of serious infections, including those caused by multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. A clinical isolate of S. aureus with high-level resistance to vancomycin (minimal inhibitory concentration = 1024 microg/ml) was isolated in June 2002. This isolate harbored a 57.9-kilobase multiresistance conjugative plasmid within which Tn1546 (vanA) was integrated. Additional elements on the plasmid encoded resistance to trimethoprim (dfrA), beta-lactams (blaZ), aminoglycosides (aacA-aphD), and disinfectants (qacC). Genetic analyses suggest that the long-anticipated transfer of vancomycin resistance to a methicillin-resistant S. aureus occurred in vivo by interspecies transfer of Tn1546 from a co-isolate of Enterococcus faecalis."
https://openalex.org/W2006450841,"In order to address the economic and environmental consequences of our global energy system, we consider the availability and consumption of energy resources. Problems arise from our dependence on combustible fuels, the environmental risks associated with their extraction, and the environmental damage caused by their emissions. Yet no primary energy source, be it renewable or nonrenewable, is free of environmental or economic limitations. As developed and developing economies continue to grow, conversion to and adoption of environmentally benign energy technology will depend on political and economic realities."

 Hungate
 et al .
 argue that these carbon uptake estimates are too high because the models do not take other nutrients such as nitrogen into account appropriately. The authors estimate that there will not be enough nitrogen available to sustain the high carbon uptake scenarios. Nutrients other than nitrogen may also affect carbon uptake in ways not captured by most models."
https://openalex.org/W2111622673,"Subfemtosecond light pulses can be obtained by superposing several high harmonics of an intense laser pulse. Provided that the harmonics are emitted simultaneously, increasing their number should result in shorter pulses. However, we found that the high harmonics were not synchronized on an attosecond time scale, thus setting a lower limit to the achievable x-ray pulse duration. We showed that the synchronization could be improved considerably by controlling the underlying ultrafast electron dynamics, to provide pulses of 130 attoseconds in duration. We discuss the possibility of achieving even shorter pulses, which would allow us to track fast electron processes in matter."
https://openalex.org/W2145429486,"Fishes moving through turbulent flows or in formation are regularly exposed to vortices. Although animals living in fluid environments commonly capture energy from vortices, experimental data on the hydrodynamics and neural control of interactions between fish and vortices are lacking. We used quantitative flow visualization and electromyography to show that trout will adopt a novel mode of locomotion to slalom in between experimentally generated vortices by activating only their anterior axial muscles. Reduced muscle activity during vortex exploitation compared with the activity of fishes engaged in undulatory swimming suggests a decrease in the cost of locomotion and provides a mechanism to understand the patterns of fish distributions in schools and riverine environments."
https://openalex.org/W2152074508,"The net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide was measured by eddy covariance methods for 3 years in two old-growth forest sites near Santarém, Brazil. Carbon was lost in the wet season and gained in the dry season, which was opposite to the seasonal cycles of both tree growth and model predictions. The 3-year average carbon loss was 1.3 (confidence interval: 0.0 to 2.0) megagrams of carbon per hectare per year. Biometric observations confirmed the net loss but imply that it is a transient effect of recent disturbance superimposed on long-term balance. Given that episodic disturbances are characteristic of old-growth forests, it is likely that carbon sequestration is lower than has been inferred from recent eddy covariance studies at undisturbed sites."
https://openalex.org/W2008479246,"If molecular components are to be used as functional elements in place of the semiconductor-based devices present in conventional microcircuitry, they must compete with semiconductors under the extreme conditions required for processing and operating a practical device. Herein, we demonstrate that porphyrin-based molecules bound to Si(100), which exhibit redox behavior useful for information storage, can meet this challenge. These molecular media in an inert atmosphere are stable under extremes of temperature (400°C) for extended periods (approaching 1 hour) and do not degrade under large numbers of read-write cycles (10 12 )."
https://openalex.org/W2039930764,"Cells undergoing apoptosis during development are removed by phagocytes, but the underlying mechanisms of this process are not fully understood. Phagocytes lacking the phosphatidylserine receptor (PSR) were defective in removing apoptotic cells. Consequently, in PSR-deficient mice, dead cells accumulated in the lung and brain, causing abnormal development and leading to neonatal lethality. A fraction of PSR knockout mice manifested a hyperplasic brain phenotype resembling that of mice deficient in the cell death-associated genes encoding Apaf-1, caspase-3, and caspase-9, which suggests that phagocytes may also be involved in promoting apoptosis. These data demonstrate a critical role for PSR in early stages of mammalian organogenesis and suggest that this receptor may be involved in respiratory distress syndromes and congenital brain malformations."
https://openalex.org/W2078255466,"The early genetic pathway(s) triggering the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI) remain largely unknown. Here, we describe an autosomal dominant form of CAD/MI ( adCAD1 ) that is caused by the deletion of seven amino acids in transcription factor MEF2A. The deletion disrupts nuclear localization of MEF2A, reduces MEF2A-mediated transcription activation, and abolishes synergistic activation by MEF2A and by the transcription factor GATA-1 through a dominant-negative mechanism. The MEF2A protein demonstrates strong expression in the endothelium of coronary arteries. These results identify a pathogenic gene for a familial vascular disease with features of CAD and implicate the MEF2A signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of CAD/MI."
https://openalex.org/W2121615969,"Diverse cellular events are regulated by post-translational modification of substrate proteins via covalent attachment of one or a chain of ubiquitin molecules. The outcome of (poly)ubiquitination depends upon the specific lysine residues involved in the formation of polyubiquitin chains. Lys48-linked chains act as a universal signal for proteasomal degradation, whereas Lys63-linked chains act as a specific signal in several non-degradative processes. Although it has been anticipated that functional diversity between alternatively linked polyubiquitin chains relies on linkage-dependent differences in chain conformation/topology, direct structural evidence in support of this model has been lacking. Here we use NMR methods to determine the structure of a Lys63-linked di-ubiquitin chain. The structure is characterized by an extended conformation, with no direct contact between the hydrophobic residues Leu8, Ile44, and Val70 on the ubiquitin units. This structure contrasts with the closed conformation observed for Lys48-linked di-ubiquitin wherein these residues form the interdomain interface (Cook, W. J., Jeffrey, L. C., Carson, M., Zhijian, C., and Pickart, C. M. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 16467-16471; Varadan, R., Walker, O., Pickart, C., and Fushman, D. (2002) J. Mol. Biol. 324, 637-647). Consistent with the open conformation of the Lys63-linked di-ubiquitin, our binding studies show that both ubiquitin domains in this chain can bind a ubiquitin-associated domain from HHR23A independently and in a mode similar to that for mono-ubiquitin. In contrast, Lys48-linked di-ubiquitin binds in a different, higher affinity mode that has yet to be determined. This is the first experimental evidence that alternatively linked polyubiquitin chains adopt distinct conformations.

An increasing number of cellular processes has been found to be regulated by ubiquitin (Ub) 1The abbreviations used are: Ub, ubiquitin; monoUb, mono-ubiquitin; polyUb, polyubiquitin; UBA, ubiquitin-associated domain; PDB, Protein Data Bank; MTSL, 1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-pyrroline-3-methyl methanesulfonate; HSQC, heteronuclear single-quantum coherence; RDC, residual dipolar coupling; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; GST, glutathione S-transferase; E1, ubiquitin activating enzyme; IPAP, in-phase/anti-phase. 1The abbreviations used are: Ub, ubiquitin; monoUb, mono-ubiquitin; polyUb, polyubiquitin; UBA, ubiquitin-associated domain; PDB, Protein Data Bank; MTSL, 1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-pyrroline-3-methyl methanesulfonate; HSQC, heteronuclear single-quantum coherence; RDC, residual dipolar coupling; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; GST, glutathione S-transferase; E1, ubiquitin activating enzyme; IPAP, in-phase/anti-phase.-mediated signaling events (1Hershko A.

Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). In all such events, a specific lysine residue on the surface of the substrate protein is covalently attached to the C terminus of a ubiquitin molecule via tightly regulated enzymatic steps (3Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2887) Google Scholar). Chains of Ub are assembled on the substrate via formation of isopeptide bonds between a lysine on the surface of the first Ub and the C-terminal Gly76 of the next. There are seven different lysine residues in Ub, five of which (Lys6, Lys11, Lys29, Lys48, and Lys63) have been observed to be involved in the formation of polyUb chains in vitro or in vivo (for review, see Ref. 4Pickart C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 11: 544-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (372) Google Scholar). A recent analysis revealed that all seven of the theoretical Ub-Ub linkages are detectable in the yeast proteome (5Peng J. Schwartz D. Elias J.E. Thoreen C.C. Cheng D. Marsischky G. Roelofs J. Finley D. Gygi S.P. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). At least in some cases the lysine site used for Ub-Ub conjugation is preserved throughout the chain (3Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2887) Google Scholar, 6Spence J. Gali R.R. Dittmar G. Sherman F. Karin M. Finley D.

Nature. 2002; 419: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar).Interestingly, the consequence of (poly)ubiquitination has been found to depend upon which lysine residue forms the isopeptide bonds in the polyUb chain. The best characterized of these outcomes is the proteasomal degradation of substrate proteins tagged by Lys48-linked chains (8Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D. Ecker D.J. Gonda D.K.

Biol. 1994; 14: 5501-5509Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). PolyUb chains assembled via Lys29 have been implicated in degradation of certain model proteasome substrates (10Johnson E.S.

Lys63-linked polyUb chains, on the other hand, function in post-replicative DNA repair in the RAD6 pathway (11Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M.

Cell. 2000; 103: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar), translational regulation (6Spence J. Gali R.R. Dittmar G. Sherman F. Karin M. Finley D. Cell. 2000; 102: 67-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), and some instances of endocytosis (14Galan J.M. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5847-5854Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), although their mechanistic role in these processes is still unclear. Mono-Ub, like Lys63-linked polyUb chains, is not involved in proteasome proteolysis and appears to act as a trafficking signal in a host of processes, including endocytosis, endosome internalization, and viral budding (for reviews, see Refs. 15Hicke L. Cell. 2001; 106: 527-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar and 16Katzmann D.J. Odorizzi G. Emr S.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 893-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). It is remarkable that different polyUb chains, assembled from identical Ub units, are able to function as distinct signals in the cell. Because the only obvious chemical difference between the functionally distinct chains is in their linkage via alternative lysine residues, the answer is likely to lie in different topologies/conformations of the alternatively linked polyUb chains, although direct recognition of the isopeptide bond cannot yet be excluded. Elucidation of the conformation of alternatively linked polyUb chains would greatly aid in distinguishing between these models and in understanding the basis of structural diversity in polyUb signaling.The location of Lys48 with respect to the C terminus of the Ub molecule should cause an almost 90° turn in the direction of the Lys48-linked chain with every added Ub unit and could result in a “compact” conformation of the polyUb chain. Given that Lys63 is located on a different face of the ubiquitin molecule compared with Lys48, it is conceivable that Lys63-linked chains adopt a different conformation that could result in a differential display of the hydrophobic residues that have been implicated in several Ub-dependent signaling events (17Beal R. Deveraux Q. Xia G. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 861-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 18Sloper-Mould K.E. Jemc J.C. Pickart C.M. Hicke L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30483-30489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar).Recently we have shown that under physiological conditions Lys48-linked Ub2 adopts a closed conformation in which these functionally important hydrophobic residues (Leu8, Ile44, Val70) are sequestered at the interdomain interface (19Varadan R. Walker O. Pickart C. Fushman D. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). This interface is similar to that formed in Ub2 crystals (20Cook W.J. Jeffrey L.C. Carson M. Zhijian C. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16467-16471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This closed conformation, however, is in dynamic equilibrium with one or more open conformations (19Varadan R. Walker O. Pickart C. Fushman D. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), thus allowing the exposure of these hydrophobic residues to the solvent and, presumably, to specific interacting proteins. The same hydrophobic residues are involved in interdomain contacts in Ub4 (19Varadan R. Walker O. Pickart C. Fushman D. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), although the solution conformation of this chain is yet to be elucidated. Here we present the results of our NMR studies indicating that the solution conformation of Lys63-linked Ub2 differs strongly from the structure of Lys48-linked Ub2.MATERIALS AND METHODSBiochemicals were from Sigma unless otherwise stated. E1 was from BostonBiochem Inc., and ethyleneimine was from Chemservice. Yeast Mms2 and Ubc13 were expressed and purified as in previous studies (21Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27936-27943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 22Raasi S. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8951-8959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Ub (K63C), Ub (K63R), and Ub (Asp77) were expressed and purified as described in Haldeman et al. (23Haldeman M.T. Xia G. Kasperek E.M. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10526-10537Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). 15N-Labeled proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli cells grown in minimal media with 15NH4Cl as the sole source of nitrogen. 1-Oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-pyrroline-3-methyl methanesulfonate (MTSL) was from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc. The UBA construct used in this study contains a full-length UBA2 domain from HHR23A (human isoform A of Rad23), residues 315-363 in the protein sequence (SWS P54725). These residues are numbered here -3 through 45 to bring residues 1-45 in correspondence to those in the PDB structure 1DV0 (24Dieckmann T. Withers-Ward E.S. Jarosinski M.A. Liu C.F. Chen I.S. Feigon J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1042-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In addition, this construct has a 5-residue N-terminal extension (GSAAA) resulting from the fusion junction. As shown in the previous biochemical assays, these extra residues do not detectably affect UBA2 binding properties (22Raasi S. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8951-8959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Pull-down assays with GST-fused UBA2 from Rad23A were conducted with 125I-labeled Ub2 and Ub4 (Lys48- or Lys63-linked) as previously described (22Raasi S. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8951-8959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar).Design and Synthesis of Segmentally Isotope-enriched polyUb Chains—To overcome the expected spectroscopic equivalence of all monomers in a homopolymeric chain we employed chains in which only one Ub unit was isotope-enriched in each NMR sample, as described earlier (19Varadan R. Walker O. Pickart C. Fushman D. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The notations used throughout the text are as follows. Isotope-enriched Ub moieties in Ub2s are labeled P for the proximal (with respect to a possible substrate) or D for the distal location in the chain. Lys63-linked Ub2 molecules were synthesized using E1 and the heterodimeric complex of Ubc13/Mms2 (21Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27936-27943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) in overnight reactions at 37 °C. Proximal 15N-labeled Ub2 (here referred to as Ub2-P) was synthesized by using 15N-labeled Ub (Asp77) and unlabeled Ub (K63C or K63R as required); distal 15N-labeled Ub2 (Ub2-D) was synthesized using monomers of 15N-labeled Ub (K63C or K63R) and unlabeled Ub (Asp77). These mutations blocked the undesired linking of Ub moieties and allowed full control of the direction of the Ub2 assembly. Ub2 was separated from unreacted Ub monomers at the end of the reaction by cation-exchange chromatography, and the Ub2 concentration was determined from UV absorbance (25Piotrowski J. Beal R. Hoffmann L. Wilkinson K.D. Cohen R.E. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23712-23721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar).Site-directed Spin Labeling of Ub2—The spin label MTSL was covalently linked to the side chain of Cys63, a single cysteine residue in the Ub2 (K63C-15N Asp77) construct. In a control experiment, Lys48-linked Ub2 was spin-labeled by attaching MTSL to Cys48 in the distal domain (K48C mutant). MTSL was dissolved at 40 mm concentration in acetonitrile. Spin labeling reactions were performed in 50 mm Tris, pH 8, in a 1.5-3 m excess of MTSL. The reaction tube was flushed with N2 and incubated in the dark for 1 h. Unreacted MTSL was then removed from the protein solution, and the buffer was exchanged into 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 7% D2O and 0.02% NaN3. For the reference measurements the spin-label was reduced with a 3-fold excess of ascorbic acid added in small volumes from a concentrated solution.NMR Spectroscopy—NMR samples of Lys63-linked Ub2 chains (0.5-1 mm) were prepared in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 7% D2O, and 0.02% NaN3. All NMR studies were performed on a Bruker DRX-600 spectrometer at 25 °C. 1H,15N HSQC spectra and two-dimensional planes for 15N relaxation experiments were acquired with 7.2 and 2 kHz in the 1H and 15N dimensions, respectively. For each two-dimensional plane, 128 t1 increments were collected, each consisting of 1024 complex points. Standard pulse sequences were used for the measurement of 15N transverse (R2) and longitudinal (R1) relaxation rates (26Fushman D. Cahill S. Cowburn D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 173-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 27Hall J.B. Fushman D. J. Biomol. NMR. 2003; 27: 261-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).The principal values and axes of the rotational diffusion tensor of Ub2 experienced by each Ub unit were derived from the orientation dependence of the measured ratio of 15N relaxation rates, R2 and R1 (28Fushman D. Xu R. Cowburn D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10225-10230Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), for all observed NH bonds in each Ub domain. The analysis was performed using the in-house computer program ROTDIF (19Varadan R. Walker O. Pickart C. Fushman D. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) for both fully anisotropic and axially symmetric models for the overall tumbling. 55 of 70 (Ub2-D) and 57 of 71 (Ub2-P) observed NH groups were used for the analysis. Residues from flexible regions, 8-11 and 72-76, were excluded from the analysis due to high uncertainty in their amide NH-vector orientations. Amides involved in conformational exchange (Ile23, Asn25) were not included because of the strong effect of this motion on their relaxation data (R2). In addition, the linkage site (Lys63 in Ub2-P) and the site of mutation (Cys63 or Arg63 in Ub2-D) were excluded because of the possible perturbations in Ub structure. Atom coordinates of Ub were taken from the solution structure PDB code 1D3Z (29Cornilescu G. Marquardt J.L. Ottiger M. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 6836-6837Crossref Scopus (777) Google Scholar).Residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) were measured in a weakly aligned liquid crystalline phase. The medium was composed of n-alkylpolyethylene glycol (C12E5) (5% by wt) and n-hexanol (molar ratio 0.85) as described in Ruckert and Otting (30Ruckert M. Otting G. J. Am. Chem.

Reson. 1998; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar) and extracted using the approximation of contour levels as ellipses (32Garrett D.S. Powers R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 95: 214-220Crossref Scopus (800) Google Scholar). Typically, 256 t1 increments were used. The RDCs were obtained from the difference in the 1H,15N couplings observed in the oriented (25 °C) and isotropic phase (35 °C). The alignment tensor was calculated using the in-house program ALTENS (19Varadan R. Walker O. Pickart C. Fushman D. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar); the atom coordinates were from PDB code 1D3Z (29Cornilescu G. Marquardt J.L. Ottiger M. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 6836-6837Crossref Scopus (777) Google Scholar). 59 of the observed 71 NH groups were used for the analysis. Backbone NH groups of residues in loop regions 8-11 and 71-76 were excluded from the analysis due to the uncertainty in their orientations. The quality of the derived alignment tensors was assessed using the quality factor representing the agreement between the experimental and predicted values of the RDCs (33Clore G.M. Garrett D.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 9008-9012Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar).Alignment of Ub Moieties in Ub2 Based on NMR Data—The relative orientation of the two domains in Ub2 was determined by aligning the principal axes of the alignment or rotational diffusion tensor of the whole molecule experienced by each of the domains using the method of Fushman and Cowburn (28Fushman D. Xu R. Cowburn D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10225-10230Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar; also Ref. 34Ghose R. Fushman D. Cowburn D. J. Magn. Reson. 2001; 149: 214-217Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The derived principal axes of these tensors have no directionality, i.e. both -x and +x and -z and +z orientations are possible, which would result in four possible relative orientations of the two domains (34Ghose R. Fushman D. Cowburn D. J. Magn. Reson. 2001; 149: 214-217Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The degeneracy was reduced by applying chemical link requirements (Gly76-Lys63 isopeptide bond). This resulted in two chain conformations (Fig .2, a and b), both consistent with the data and differing in the 180° rotation of one of the Ub domains about the z axis connecting the two Ub units in Ub2.NMR Titration Studies of the Ub2-UBA2 Binding—The Ub2-UBA2 interaction surface was mapped using chemical shift perturbations in a series of NMR titration experiments. 0.6-0.9 mm15N-labeled Ub2 samples (Ub2-D and Ub2-P) were titrated with increasing amounts of an unlabeled UBA2 solution. Binding was monitored through changes in the peak positions in a series of 1H,15N HSQC spectra with increasing relative concentrations of UBA. Titration for the proximal domain continued up to UBA/Ub2 molar ratio of 5:1; the studies for the distal domain were performed twice, with the final UBA/Ub2 ratio of 5:1 and 10:1. The combined amide chemical shift perturbation was calculated as Δδ = [(ΔδH)2+(ΔδN/5)2]1/2, where ΔδH and ΔδN are the chemical shift changes (for 1H and 15N, respectively) observed in Ub2 upon the addition of UBA. The same equation was used to calculate chemical shift perturbations in UBA upon titration of Ub2 as well as the chemical shift difference between monoUb and Ub2. To monitor site-specific changes in NMR signal intensities due to line broadening, the spectra obtained upon titration of UBA (or Ub2) were uniformly scaled to compensate for the higher molecular weight of the complex. The signal attenuation for each residue was then calculated as the ratio of peak intensities in HSQC spectra of the free and bound protein.Titration data were analyzed assuming that the observed chemical shift perturbation Δδ is a weighted average between the two extreme values corresponding to the free (Δδ = 0) and ligand-bound (Δδ = ΔδB) states, so that Δδ = ΔδBpB, where pB is the relative population of the bound state of the molecule under observation. We assumed that a Lys63-linked Ub2 contains two independent UBA-binding sites, one per Ub unit, characterized by identical microscopic dissociation constants, Kd (e.g. Ref. 35Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1980: 850-856Google Scholar). Two possible UBA:Ub2 stoichiometry models are considered here. A 1:1 model allows one UBA molecule bound per Ub2 and assumes (based on the observed chemical shift perturbations, see Fig. 4 and “Results and Discussion”) that one UBA molecule can bind to either of the two Ub domains but not both. A 2:1 model, in addition, allows up to two UBA molecules bound to Ub2, one per Ub unit. For the measurements on the distal or proximal domain in Ub2, the 1:1 model gives pB=([Pt]+[Lt]+12Kd-([Pt]+[Lt]+12Kd)2-4[Pt][Lt])/(4[Pt])Fig. 4Chemical shift mapping of the interactions between Lys63-linked Ub2 and UBA2 domain from Rad23. The top panels depict combined amide chemical shift perturbations (“Materials and Methods”) observed in the distal (a) and proximal (b) domains of Ub2 and in UBA (c). The sites perturbed upon binding were mapped on the surface of Ub2 (d) and UBA domain (e). Panel f shows the amino acid sequence of the UBA2 domain construct, with residue numbers used here (top) and in the Rad23 sequence (bottom). Surface coloring in Ub2 (d) is as follows. The unperturbed sites are shown in blue (distal Ub) and green (proximal Ub); the residues showing chemical shift perturbation and/or signal attenuation are colored orange (distal) and red (proximal). For the UBA surface (e) unperturbed sites are ivory, and those perturbed are violet. Numbers in d and e map surface location of the corresponding perturbed residues. The orientation of Ub2 is the same as in Fig. 2a. UBA atom coordinates are from PDB code 1DV0 (24Dieckmann T. Withers-Ward E.S. Jarosinski M.A. Liu C.F. Chen I.S. Feigon J. Nat. Struct.

Marked with triangles in panels a and b are Ile44 and Val70-Arg72 (distal Ub) and Ile13, Thr14, Lys48, and His68-Arg72 (proximal Ub), exhibiting significant (>30%) signal attenuation due to extensive kinetic broadening of their resonances upon UBA binding. The sites perturbed in Ub2 upon UBA binding comprise Thr7, Leu8, Lys11, Ile13, Thr14, Arg42, Ile44, Lys48, Gln49, and His68-Leu73 in the distal domain and Gln2, Leu8, Lys11-Leu15, Arg42, Lys48, Gln49, Glu64, and His68-Leu73 in the proximal Ub.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Here [Pt] and [Lt] are the total molar concentrations of the protein (Ub2) and ligand (UBA).

The 2:1 binding model gives pB=([Pt]+2[Lt]+Kd-([Pt]+2[Lt]+Kd)2-8[Pt][Lt])/(2[Pt])RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONSegmentally isotope-labeled Lys63-linked Ub2 molecules were synthesized as described under “Materials and Methods.” The correct mass of the purified product was confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass-spectrometry (17,304 Da versus 17,307 Da expected). The correct chain assembly is confirmed by the observed chemical shift perturbations in the C-terminal residues in Ub2-D and in Lys63 and adjacent residues in Ub2-P (Fig. 1).Fig. 1Chemical shift perturbations in the distal (a) and proximal domains (b) in the Lys63-linked Ub2 compared with monoUb. Panels c and d show chemical shift perturbations in the same residues observed in the Lys48-linked Ub2 (19Varadan R. Walker O. Pickart C. Fushman D. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) for comparison. All these data are for pH 6.8. Diagrams on the top of each panel depict the link between the two Ub domains and the location of the isopeptide bond in the two constructs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Search for Interdomain Interactions in Ub2 Using Chemical Shift Mapping—We used the chemical shift mapping approach to search for the interdomain interface in Lys63-linked Ub2. Any difference in chemical shifts observed between monomeric Ub and Ub2 under identical experimental conditions would indicate a change in the microenvironment of the residue as a result (direct or indirect) of the interactions between Ub domains in Ub2. However, under our experimental conditions no significant backbone amide chemical shift perturbations were observed in the Ub2 (Fig. 1) except for the residues involved in the linkage. This suggests that 1) both Ub units remain unperturbed in Ub2 and 2) no specific interaction exists between the two Ub moieties in Lys63-linked Ub2. The latter conclusion contrasts with our results for the Lys48-linked chains where a well defined interface was observed (Fig. 1; Ref. 19Varadan R. Walker O. Pickart C. Fushman D. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Thus, the conformations of the two chains are different.Solution Conformation of Lys63-linked Ub2—We next determined the conformation of the Lys63-linked Ub2. The relative orientation of the two domains in Lys63-linked Ub2 was obtained from the molecular alignment in a dilute liquid crystalline medium (“Materials and Methods”). The characteristics of the alignment tensors for Ub domains in Ub2 derived from residual dipolar coupling measurements are presented in Table I. Both Ub domains exhibited good alignment in the medium, confirmed by the low values of the quality factor (Table I; see also the supplemental material). The Ub2 structure resulting from aligning the principal axes of the alignment tensors is shown in (Fig. 2, a and b). It should be noted that the distance between the two Ub units in this structure is arbitrary, since no direct distance constraints can be derived from the method. Consistent with our chemical shift perturbation data, the conformation of these chains appears to be extended with no clear interface between the two Ub domains.Table ICharacteristics of the alignment tensor for Lys63 linked Ub2 determined from the residual dipolar couplings measured in each of the two Ub unitsUb unitSxxaThe alignment tensor S̲̲ was defined as D=∑ijSijcosϕicosϕj, where D is the measured RDC and cosπj are the direction consines ij = x, y, z) for a given NH vector.

The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major constituent of green tea, on vasorelaxation and on eNOS expression and activity in endothelial cells. EGCG (1-50 μm) induced dose-dependent vasodilation in rat aortic rings. Vasodilation was abolished by pretreatment with NG-nitro l-arginine methyl ester. In bovine aortic endothelial cells, EGCG increased endothelial nitric oxide (eNOS) activity dose-dependently after 15 min. Treatment with EGCG induced a sustained activation of Akt, ERK1/2, and eNOS Ser1179 phosphorylation. Inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 had no influence on eNOS activity or Ser1179 phosphorylation. Simultaneous treatment of cells with selective inhibitors for cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and Akt completely prevented the increase in eNOS activity by EGCG after 15 min, indicating that both kinases act in concert. Specific phosphatidylinositol-3-OH-kinase inhibitors yielded identical results. Akt inhibition prevented eNOS Ser1179 phosphorylation, whereas inhibition of PKA did not influence Akt and eNOS Ser1179 phosphorylation. Pretreatment of endothelial cells with EGCG for 4 h markedly enhanced the increase in eNOS activity stimulated by Ca-ionomycin, suggesting that Akt accounts for prolonged eNOS activation. Treatment of cells for 72 h with EGCG did not change eNOS protein levels. Our results indicate that EGCG-induced endothelium-dependent vasodilation is primarily based on rapid activation of eNOS by a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-, PKA-, and Akt-dependent increase in eNOS activity, independently of an altered eNOS protein content.

Epidemiological evidence suggests that chronic diseases such as coronary heart disease and stroke have a lower incidence in countries with a high intake of tea. Numerous studies have demonstrated that tea drinking lowers the risk of heart disease and reduces cardiovascular mortality (1Nakachi K. Matsuyama S. Miyake S. Suganuma M. Imai K.

Tea flavonoids include catechins, quercetin, kaempferol, and numerous other polyphenols (7Kris-Etherton P.M. Keen C.L. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2002; 13: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Catechins are the major components of tea; in green tea, they represent > 80% of flavonoids, and in black tea, they represent only 20-30% (8Balentine D.A. Wiseman S.A. Bouwens L.C. Crit. Rev.

In addition, there is experimental and clinical evidence that tea extracts also improve endothelial function (10Huang Y. Chan N.W.K. Lau C.W. Yao X.Q. Chan F.L. Chen Z.Y. Biochim. Biophys.

Endothelial-dependent NO is produced by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). This key enzyme in cardiovascular homeostasis is regulated posttranslationally by means of rapid modulation of eNOS activity by increase in intracellular Ca2+ and/or phosphorylation and on the transcriptional level by changes in eNOS gene expression. In the present study, we show the effects of a natural plant-derived catechin, EGCG, on eNOS expression and activity in endothelial cells, and we elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved. Cell Culture—Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were purchased from Clonetics and maintained in microvascular endothelial cell growth medium (EGM-MV), supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 10 pg/ml epidermal growth factor, 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 12 μg/ml bovine brain extract, and 0.1% gentamicin. For experiments, the cells were seeded onto 6-cm dishes and treated with EGCG (dissolved in water), LY294002, wortmannin, Ca-ionomycin from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany), the cell-permeable myristoylated 14-22 amide peptide PKI, H89, and PD98059 from Calbiochem, and SH-5 from Alexis (San Diego, CA) at confluency. Cells were used between passages 4 and 10 for all experiments. For Western blots with phospho-specific antibodies and the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) assays, cells were starved in medium with 1% fetal bovine serum for 20 h. Western Blot Analysis—After treatment, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in extraction buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 154 mm KCl, 5 mm glucose, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% Triton X-100. For Western blots with phospho-specific antibodies, cells were lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4,4 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, 0.1 mm okadaic acid, and 1% Triton X-100. Total protein (50 μg per lane) was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and membranes were probed with anti-phospho-eNOS (Ser1177), anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473), and anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) from Cell Signaling Technology (Frankfurt, Germany), anti-Akt antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), anti-eNOS from BD Transduction Laboratories (Heidelberg, Germany), secondary anti-mouse from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and anti-rabbit from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). Bands were visualized by using either 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium (Sigma) or the ECL detection system (Amersham, Freiburg, Germany). Measurement of eNOS Activity in Intact Cells—eNOS activity was assessed by formation of l-[3H]citrulline from l-[3H]arginine after separation of the amino acids by cation-exchange chromatography. Endothelial cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 30 min in Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, containing 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 10 mm Hepes-Na, 10 mm glucose, and 1 mm CaCl2. Stimulation was initiated by the addition of agonists, 10 μm cold l-arginine, and 3 μCi/ml l-[3H]arginine. Where indicated, protein kinase inhibitors were present 30 min before and during agonist stimulation. After 15 min, the reaction was terminated with ice-cold stop solution containing 5 mml-arginine and 4 mm EDTA. Cells were denatured with 96% ethanol and, after evaporation, the soluble cellular components were extracted with 20 mm Hepes-Na, pH 5.5. l-[3H]citrulline was separated from l-[3H]arginine by Dowex chromatography, and l-[3H]citrulline formation was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. In preincubation experiments of the cells with EGCG for 4 h, no further EGCG was added after replacing the medium with Hepes buffer. PKA Assay—Measurement of PKA activity was performed with a commercial PKA assay kit (PepTag assay kit, Promega, Madison, WI). Cells were serum-starved in medium with 1% fetal bovine serum for 20 h and stimulated for 15 min with 100 μm EGCG, or EGCG and 20 μm PKI, to demonstrate the specificity of the reaction. After stimulation, cells were lysed in extraction buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 1 mm EGTA. We used 5 μg of cell homogenate in the assay. The reactions were performed according to the protocol of the manufacturer. After phosphorylation, the PKA-specific fluorescent peptide substrate kemptide alters the net charge from +1 to -1, and the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms can be separated on agarose gels. Vasorelaxation Studies—Thoracic aortas from male Wistar rats were rapidly excised, cleaned of connective tissue, and cut into rings 2-3 mm in length for organ-chamber experiments. The rings were then mounted on platinum hooks in 10-ml jacketed organ baths containing modified Krebs-Henseleit solution (144 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 1.6 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, and 11.1 mm d-glucose) and 1 μm diclofenac. Tension was gradually adjusted to 2 g over 1 h. The solution in the bath was maintained at 37 °C with a gas mixture of 5% CO2 and 95% O2. After equilibration and submaximal precontraction with 0.05 μm phenylephrine, relaxation to increasing concentrations (0.1 to 50 μm) of EGCG was performed to obtain cumulative concentration-response curves. Selected studies were conducted in rings treated with 1 mml-NAME before phenylephrine exposure and in rings in which the endothelium was removed by gently rubbing with dental floss. Removal of the endothelium was confirmed by the inhibition of acetylcholine-dependent vasodilation after contraction with phenylephrine. Statistical Analysis—All values are expressed as mean ± S.E. compared with controls. Vasorelaxation is expressed as a percentage of precontraction with phenylephrine. Statistical analysis was performed by use of ANOVA, Mann-Whitney, or Student's t test where appropriate. A level of p < 0.05 was considered significant in all statistical tests. To examine whether EGCG could induce vasorelaxation, we exposed phenylephrine-precontracted rat aortic rings to cumulative doses of EGCG. EGCG caused dose-dependent vasorelaxation, starting at 1 μm (Fig. 1A). The original recording of a single experiment is shown that indicates a transient, reversible contraction after each EGCG dose, followed by sustained relaxation. The summary of 7-18 experiments is illustrated in Fig. 1B. EGCG produced vasodilation, which began at 1 μm and reached statistical significance at 10 μm. Pretreatment with 1 mml-NAME abolished the vasodilation induced by 1-25 μm of EGCG, whereas at 50 μm EGCG, l-NAME had no effect (Fig. 1B). Removal of the endothelium yielded identical results (data not shown), indicating that relaxations of rat aortic rings induced by EGCG is predominantly due to generation of nitric oxide. To test this assumption, we incubated BAECs with increasing concentrations of EGCG, and measured eNOS activity in intact cells. EGCG caused a dose-dependent increase in eNOS activity after 15 min (Fig. 1C). At 100 μm EGCG, we observed a 4-fold rise in eNOS activity. To investigate whether EGCG can also influence eNOS protein expression, we incubated BAEC with increasing concentrations of EGCG for 72 h. There was no change in eNOS protein content, regardless of the concentration used, which indicates that EGCG has no effect on the level of eNOS protein (Fig. 1D). It has been shown recently (12Hong J. Lu H. Meng X. Ryu J.H. Hara Y. Yang C.S. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 7241-7246PubMed Google Scholar) that EGCG can produce H2O2, albeit at low concentrations, and that H2O2 can lead to eNOS activation and vasorelaxation in rabbit aortic rings (13Thomas S.R. Chen K. Keaney Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6017-6024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). To exclude a contribution of H2O2 to the observed effects of EGCG, we performed the vasorelaxation studies and eNOS activity assays in the presence of catalase. Preincubation with catalase (1000 units/ml) had no influence on the obtained results, indicating that the effects of EGCG are not due to the production of H2O2 (data not shown). eNOS is posttranslationally activated by phosphorylation. To look for possible kinases involved in the up-regulation of eNOS activity by EGCG, we assessed Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. EGCG (at 100 μm) induced phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473) and ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) after 15-30 min (Fig. 2). Whereas the activation of ERK1/2 was transient and returned to basal levels after 6 h, phosphorylation of Akt remained elevated for at least 6 h. Because Akt can phosphorylate eNOS (14Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3035) Google Scholar), we determined the phosphorylation status for Ser1179 of bovine eNOS. eNOS Ser1179 phosphorylation followed a similar time course as did Akt activation (starting at 15 min) and remained elevated for at least 6 h (Fig. 2). The finding that a prominent increase in eNOS enzyme activity by EGCG is apparent after 15 min, whereas there was only a moderate activation of Akt and eNOS Ser1179 phosphorylation at this time point, suggests that another kinase may be involved in the rapid EGCG-induced eNOS activation. It has recently been shown that PKA can activate eNOS by phosphorylation (15Michell B.J. Harris M.B. Chen Z. Ju H. Venema V.J. Blackstone M.A. Huang W. Venema R.C. Kemp B.E. J. Biol.

Pretreatment of cells with PKI (20 μm), a specific PKA inhibitor, partly eliminated the EGCG-stimulated increase in eNOS activity after 15 min (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained with another specific PKA inhibitor, H89 (data not shown). To further demonstrate the involvement of PKA in the rapid activation of eNOS by EGCG, we measured PKA activity in BAEC after treatment of cells with EGCG. EGCG at 100 μm led to an activation of PKA within 15 min, which was abolished by the PKA inhibitor PKI (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3Effect of kinase inhibitors on eNOS activity and phosphorylation in BAEC.A, cells were pretreated or not with the PKA inhibitor PKI (20 μm) for 30 min and stimulated with 100 μm EGCG for 15 min. eNOS activity in intact cells was measured by conversion of l-[3H]citrulline from l-[3H]arginine. *, p < 0.05.

Data are representative from three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Having shown the involvement of both kinases in rapid and sustained eNOS activation, we investigated whether common upstream signaling pathways are involved. Akt can be activated by means of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH-kinase (PI3K) (14Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3035) Google Scholar); recently, a PI3K-dependent, PKA-dependent pathway for eNOS phosphorylation in BAEC was described (16Boo Y.C. Sorescu G. Boyd N. Shiojima I. Walsh K. Du J. Jo H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3388-3396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). To investigate whether PI3K is involved in rapid EGCG-dependent eNOS activation, BAEC were pretreated with LY294002 (30 μm) before stimulation with EGCG (100 μm) for 15 min. As shown in Fig. 3C, inhibition of PI3K completely prevented EGCG-induced eNOS activation. Wortmannin, another inhibitor of PI3K, yielded identical results (data not shown), demonstrating the requirement of PI3K for eNOS activation by EGCG. To formally exclude a contribution of ERK1/2 to the increase in eNOS activation evoked by the tea catechin, cells were pretreated with PD98059 (10 μm), an inhibitor of ERK1/2. PD98059 had no influence on EGCG-induced increase in eNOS activity after 15 min (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, EGCG-induced eNOS Ser1179 phosphorylation after 1 h was abolished by LY294002, whereas PD98059 was without effect (Fig. 3D), which indicates that the transient ERK1/2 activation does not contribute to either rapid (after 15 min) or sustained (after 1 h) eNOS activation. To examine whether the activation of PKA lies upstream of Akt activation, we measured Akt and eNOS phosphorylation after inhibition of PKA. Pretreatment of BAEC with PKI had no effect on EGCG-induced Akt and eNOS Ser1179 phosphorylation after one hour, suggesting that both kinases act in parallel (Fig. 4A). However, SH-5 (20 μm), an inhibitor of Akt (17Kozikowski A.P. Sun H. Brognard J. Dennis P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1144-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), abolished both Akt and eNOS phosphorylation (Fig. 4A), revealing that Akt is responsible for the sustained eNOS Ser1179 phosphorylation by EGCG. In line with the above results, simultaneous treatment of cells with PKI and SH-5 completely prevented the increase in eNOS activity after 15 min, which indicates that both kinases act in concert. SH-5 on its own led only to partial inhibition (Fig. 4B). To analyze whether prolonged eNOS phosphorylation leads to a more active enzyme, we incubated BAEC with 100 μm EGCG for 4 h and measured basal and stimulated eNOS activity in intact cells. No EGCG was present before and during the assay anymore. Although basal eNOS activity in the EGCG-pretreated cells was slightly augmented compared with untreated cells, the stimulation with Ca-ionomycin yielded an almost 2-fold higher increase in eNOS activity in the EGCG-pretreated cells (Fig. 4C). The present study demonstrates that endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation induced by the tea-derived catechin EGCG occurs in response to a potent, dose-dependent activation of eNOS in endothelial cells. The resulting increase in eNOS activity is observed within a few minutes, suggesting posttranslational regulation of eNOS as an underlying mechanism. Improvement of vascular endothelial function by flavonoids may be an important mechanism by which tea reduces cardiovascular risk (11Duffy S.J. Keaney Jr., J.F. Holbrook M. Gokce N. Swerdloff P.L. Frei B. Vita J.A. Circulation. 2001; 104: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The normal endothelium plays a critical role in regulating vasomotor tone, and it is well established that impaired endothelium-derived nitric oxide activity is associated with the progression of atherosclerosis. Recent evidence has demonstrated that short- and long-term tea consumption reverses endothelial dysfunction in patients with documented coronary heart disease, thereby providing a putative mechanism responsible for the beneficial effect of tea in these patients. Our vasoreactivity studies and previous experiments reinforce this clinical evidence by suggesting that purified epicatechins from tea evoke endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation in precontracted rat aorta by means of NO release from the endothelium (10Huang Y. Chan N.W.K. Lau C.W. Yao X.Q. Chan F.L. Chen Z.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1427: 322-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, experimental data on the vascular effects of catechins are not consistent. Reports have described no effect on vasoreactivity (18Andriambeloson E. Magnier C. Haan-Archipoff G. Lobstein A. Anton R. Beretz A. Stoclet J. Andriantsitohaina R. J. Nutr. 1998; 128: 2324-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) as well as even the opposite action of inhibition of acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent vasodilation (19Sanae F. Miyaichi Y. Kizu H. Hyashi H. Life Sci. 2002; 71: 2553-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Differences in experimental setup (e.g. incubation time, dose, species) may explain these inconsistent data. A recent experimental study (20Shen J.Z. Zheng X.F. Wei E.Q. Kwan C.Y. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2003; 30: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), moreover, has demonstrated that epicatechins exert vasoconstriction on resting arteries. These dual properties may partly explain the biphasic vascular effects observed in our vasoreactivity studies (transient vasoconstriction followed by sustained relaxation) in rat aortic rings after EGCG exposure. In accordance with EGCG-induced endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the rat aorta, which could be up to 25 μm of EGCG blocked by pretreatment with l-NAME, we observed a dose-dependent increase in eNOS activity in BAEC after 15 min. EGCG can generate H2O2 (12Hong J. Lu H. Meng X. Ryu J.H. Hara Y. Yang C.S. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 7241-7246PubMed Google Scholar, 20Shen J.Z. Zheng X.F. Wei E.Q. Kwan C.Y. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2003; 30: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and H2O2 can lead to eNOS activation and vasorelaxation in rabbit aortic rings (13Thomas S.R. Chen K. Keaney Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6017-6024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). However, our experiments in the presence of catalase excluded an involvement of H2O2 to the obtained results. To examine possible mechanisms leading to eNOS activation in BAEC after treatment with EGCG, we investigated the role of potential protein kinases activated by EGCG. Our study demonstrates that ERK1/2, Akt, and PKA are involved in the cellular response after EGCG stimulation. A recent study has shown that MAPK/ERK1/2 can induce eNOS activation (21Mineo C. Yuhanna I.S. Quon M.J. Shaul P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9142-9149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). However, our experiments indicate that ERK1/2 is not involved in either rapid or sustained EGCG-induced eNOS activation in BAEC. Treatment of cells with specific protein kinase inhibitors established a role of PKA and Akt in eNOS activation. Phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473) and eNOS (Ser1179) occurred in parallel and resulted in sustained, long-term activation of eNOS. Inhibition of Akt prevented phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser1179, in accordance with the well established role of Akt in eNOS phosphorylation (14Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3035) Google Scholar). Sustained eNOS Ser1179 phosphorylation leads to augmented enzyme activation, as evidenced by increased Ca-ionomycin stimulation after treatment of cells with EGCG for 4 h. Inhibition of PKA partially attenuated the rise in eNOS activity after 15 min. The following findings substantiate the involvement of PKA in the rapid activation of eNOS enzyme activity by means of phosphorylation: (i) two specific independent inhibitors of PKA (PKI and H89) at least partially inhibited rapid eNOS activation by EGCG after 15 min; (ii) activation of PKA occurred within 15 min after treatment of BAEC with EGCG, as shown in the PKA assay; and (iii) inhibitors of PI3K completely prevented up-regulation of eNOS activity after 15 min, whereas there was only a modest phosphorylation of eNOS Ser1179 at this time point. A recent report (16Boo Y.C. Sorescu G. Boyd N. Shiojima I. Walsh K. Du J. Jo H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3388-3396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that PKA stimulates eNOS Ser1179 phosphorylation in response to shear stress, and, in another study, it was likewise shown that PKA also phosphorylates and activates eNOS at Ser635 (15Michell B.J. Harris M.B. Chen Z. Ju H. Venema V.J. Blackstone M.A. Huang W. Venema R.C. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42344-42351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Inhibition of PKA did not affect Akt and eNOS Ser1179 phosphorylation, which indicates that PKA did not mediate the phosphorylation of this site in our study. It also suggests that these two kinases do not depend on each other, and that there is no cross-talk between these signaling pathways. Simultaneous blocking of both kinases abolished the rise in eNOS activity after 15 min, which evidences a concerted action of PKA and Akt. Furthermore, complete prevention of the rapid increase in eNOS activity and Akt-dependent eNOS phosphorylation by inhibition of PI3K suggests that PI3K lies upstream and is required for activation of both kinases. The PKA-mediated phosphorylation and activation of eNOS by means of an upstream PI3K-dependent pathway in endothelial cells has only recently been described (16Boo Y.C. Sorescu G. Boyd N. Shiojima I. Walsh K. Du J. Jo H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3388-3396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). However, no clear mechanistic insight into the mechanism of PKA activation by PI3K could be provided. One possible mechanism of PKA activation by PI3K could involve the interaction of PKA with different protein kinase A anchoring proteins after phosphorylation. For example, after phosphorylation of the regulatory subunit of PKA by CDK1, the kinase changes its subcellular localization by association with protein kinase A anchoring protein 95 (22Landsverk H.B. Carlson C.R. Steen R.L. Vossebein L. Herberg F.W. Taskén K. Collas P. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3255-3264PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the regulatory subunit of PKA by PI3K or other upstream kinases could likewise alter its cellular localization and bring the PKA in closer proximity to the eNOS target in caveolae. An interaction and regulation of the catalytic subunit of PKA with caveolin-1 in caveolae, the main intracellular compartment for eNOS protein localization, has been demonstrated (23Razani B. Rubin C.S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26353-26360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, at present there is no established mechanism as to how EGCG could activate PKA by means of a PI3K-dependent pathway. Further studies are required to address this question. The results of our study show that EGCG activates eNOS by parallel and additive actions of PI3K/PKA- and Akt-dependent phosphorylation. Treatment of BAEC with increasing concentrations of EGCG for 72 h did not change eNOS protein expression. In the present study, we provide the first experimental evidence that the tea polyphenol EGCG rapidly activates the key enzyme of vascular homeostasis eNOS and induces endothelium-dependent vasodilation. It remains to be elucidated whether these in vitro data may be assigned to the in vivo situation. Plasma catechin concentrations after ingestion of green and black tea in humans lie within the order of magnitude of ∼1 μm (24Yang C.S. Chen L. Lee M.J. Balentine D. Kuo M.C. Schantz S.P. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 1998; 7: 351-354PubMed Google Scholar, 25Umegaki K. Sugisawa A. Yamada K. Higuchi M. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. 2001; 47: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although the concentrations of EGCG in our cell culture model were above this value, we observed a slight NO-dependent vasodilation in rat aortic rings at 1 μm. The effects of catechins in vitro may accordingly be relevant to the improvement of endothelial function and atherosclerosis in vivo. In summary, we postulate that the plant-derived catechin EGCG leads to endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation and acts as a natural activator of eNOS in endothelial cells by increasing its protein phosphorylation. The resulting amelioration of endothelial function may in part explain the protective effects of tea-derived flavonoids on cardiovascular diseases. Our data may prove helpful in the development of new natural drugs to improve endothelial function and thereby prevent cardiovascular diseases. We are grateful to C. Bartsch and N. Wilck for their excellent technical assistance."

https://openalex.org/W2096807498,"During apoptosis, phosphatidylserine, which is normally restricted to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, is exposed on the surface of apoptotic cells and has been suggested to act as an “eat-me” signal to trigger phagocytosis. It is unclear how phagocytes recognize phosphatidylserine. Recently, a putative phosphatidylserine receptor (PSR) was identified and proposed to mediate recognition of phosphatidylserine and phagocytosis. We report that psr-1 , the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog of PSR, is important for cell corpse engulfment. In vitro PSR-1 binds preferentially phosphatidylserine or cells with exposed phosphatidylserine. In C. elegans , PSR-1 acts in the same cell corpse engulfment pathway mediated by intracellular signaling molecules CED-2 (homologous to the human CrkII protein), CED-5 (DOCK180), CED-10 (Rac GTPase), and CED-12 (ELMO), possibly through direct interaction with CED-5 and CED-12. Our findings suggest that PSR-1 is likely an upstream receptor for the signaling pathway containing CED-2, CED-5, CED-10, and CED-12 proteins and plays an important role in recognizing phosphatidylserine during phagocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2051932796,"We have reported previously that Noggin is a heparin-binding protein and associates with the cell surface through heparan sulfate proteoglycans, where it remains functional for the binding of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). Here we report that the binding of Noggin to the cell surface is highly selective for heparan sulfate and that specific structural features are required for the interaction. Noggin binds most efficiently to heparin sequences composed of 10 or more monosaccharides; N-, 6-O-, and 2-O-sulfates contribute to this interaction. In addition, we have shown that the developmentally regulated endosulfatase Qsulf1 selectively removes sulfate groups from the 6-O position of sugars within the most highly sulfated S domains of heparan sulfate, whereas 6-O-sulfates in the NA/NS domains are not substrates for the enzyme. The activity of Qsulf1 in cells in culture results in the release of Noggin from the cell surface and a restoration of BMP responsiveness to the cells. This shows that Noggin binds to the S domains of heparan sulfate and provides evidence that, in addition to modulating Wnt signaling in vivo by the release of heparan sulfate bound Wnt, Qsulf1 also modulates BMP signaling by the release of surface-bound Noggin.

Heparan sulfate proteoglycans are found ubiquitously both on the surface of cells as well as within the extracellular matrix, where they bind and modify the functions of a diverse array of ligands (1Bernfield M.

Loss of function mutations in enzymes of the heparan sulfate biosynthetic pathway have confirmed that this polysaccharide has essential roles during development. Foremost among these is the regulation of cellular responsiveness to a number of growth factors and morphogens that control patterning events (2Perrimon N. Bernfield M.

Although the precise molecular mechanisms by which these specific heparan sulfate proteoglycans regulate cellular responsiveness to BMPs in vivo is not known, recent in vitro data does support the conclusion that heparan sulfate can directly augment signaling of BMPs through their receptors (5Irie A.

Previously we have shown that the BMP antagonist Noggin remains associated with the surface of cells by binding to heparan sulfate, where it remains functional for the inhibition of BMPs (7Paine-Saunders S. Viviano B.L. Economides A.N. Saunders S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2089-2096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We have proposed that the interaction with heparan sulfate in vivo is likely to regulate the range of influence of Noggin by restricting its diffusion, thus providing another mechanism by which cellular responsiveness to BMPs can be regulated by heparan sulfate in vivo (7Paine-Saunders S. Viviano B.L. Economides A.N. Saunders S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2089-2096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This hypothesis supposes that the interaction between Noggin and heparan sulfate is sequence specific and implies that there should be a developmentally regulated mechanism in vivo for the specification of heparan sulfate structures that modulate Noggin binding to the cell surface. Heparan sulfate sequences in vivo are highly variable between tissues, and the molecular mechanisms that regulate the occurrence of this variability is an issue of significant importance in understanding the functions of heparan sulfate proteoglycans in vivo. One recently appreciated mechanism for the developmentally regulated modification of the sulfation of heparan sulfate is the expression of endo-6-O-sulfatases such as Qsulf1, which are capable of post-synthetically removing 6-O-sulfate groups from glucosamine residues in heparan sulfate and in the chemically related heparin (8Dhoot G.K.

Here we report an extension of our previous studies that include a determination that Noggin binds to the cell surface selectively through heparan sulfate (HS) in a structurally specific manner. Using heparin as a chemical analogue of HS, we have found that the HS-binding site in Noggin can accommodate up to 10 monosaccharides, and N-, 2-O-, and 6-O-sulfate residues are needed for optimum interaction. Furthermore, we have identified a mechanism by which the occurrence of Noggin-binding sites can be regulated in vivo by the specific action of Qsulf1 on the S domains of HS. Antibodies—RP57–16 was a gift of Regeneron (Tarrytown, NY). This rat monoclonal antibody was generated by using native human Noggin protein as immunogen. Ascites fluid from SCID mice, affinity-purified by protein G affinity chromatography, was used in Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence as indicated below. PhosphoSMAD 1,5,8 was obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies, Inc.

Cell Culture and Transfection—Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHOK1) stably expressing Noggin have been described previously (7Paine-Saunders S. Viviano B.L. Economides A.N. Saunders S. J. Biol.

Cells were maintained in DMEM/F12 media (BioWhittaker, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone). Liposome-mediated transfection was performed by using Geneporter (Gene Therapy Systems) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Stable cell lines previously transfected with Noggin were transfected with plasmids encoding Qsulf1 or MutQSulf1 and selected in DMEM/F12 media containing 10% fetal bovine serum with 200 μg/ml hygromycin, and individual clones were harvested and subcultured. Western blotting with anti-myc monoclonal antibody (9E10) identified positive clones expressing similar levels of wild-type or mutant Qsulf1 enzyme. Metabolic Labeling, Pulse-chase, and Immunoprecipitation—For metabolic labeling and assessment of Noggin turnover in the cell layer, cells were incubated in methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM (Invitrogen) for 40 min. Trans 35S-Label (MP Biomedicals) was then added to each well at 200 μCi/ml, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Subsequent to this pulse, cells were washed once with DMEM/F12 media containing 10% fetal bovine serum and chased in the same media. For competition experiments, heparin, heparin fragments, or other glycosaminoglycans were added during the chase period at 1 μg/ml. At the specified time intervals, media was recovered and the cell layers lysed using cold 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm magnesium chloride, 0.5 mm calcium chloride in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing protease inhibitors of 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.25 mg/ml N-ethylmaleimide, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Media was brought to similar conditions by the addition of concentrated buffer. Cell debris was removed from both cell layer extracts and media samples by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 1 min. Supernatants were then precleared by the addition of rat IgG (Sigma) at 1 μg/ml, incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by the addition of protein G-Sepharose and incubation overnight at 4 °C. Samples were then centrifuged, and the supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation. RP57–16 (Regeneron) was added to each sample at 1 μg/ml and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose was subsequently added and incubated for an additional 1 h. Beads were washed twice with the original lysis buffer without protease inhibitors and then twice with PBS containing magnesium and calcium chloride. Immunoprecipitated products were recovered from the beads by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by electrophoresis on 10–20% gradient SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad); immunoprecipitated products were detected by autoradiography or PhosphorImager. Western Blot Analysis—Extracts from cells expressing human Noggin and either Qsulf1 or MutQSulf1 were electrophoresed on 10–20% gradient SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore) by electroblotting. Filters were blocked for 1 h at room temperature using 5% non-fat dry milk in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium chloride (TBS), plus 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST). Blocked filters were probed with either RP57–16 at 20 ng/ml or 9E10 at 1:100 dilution of conditioned culture media in 2.5% non-fat dry milk in TBST for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with TBST, incubation with an anti-rat or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in TBST for 1 h and three remaining washes with TBST; protein bands were detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Purification and Analysis of Heparan Sulfate Chains—HS chains were obtained from cultured CHOhNG cells grown in DMEM/F12 media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. These cells were transfected with wild-type QSulf1 or the mutated form of QSulf1. Clones of cells containing differential amounts of QSulf1 were obtained. These cells were metabolically radiolabeled with 20 μCi/ml d-[6-3H]glucosamine hydrochloride (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 20 μCi/ml [35S]Na2SO4 (MP Biomedicals) for 20 h at 37 °C. The culture media was removed and frozen for future use. The cells were washed twice with PBS, then treated with 1 mg/ml trypsin (Sigma) for 10 mins at 37 °C. The trypsin was then neutralized with 2 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). Cells were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 mins at 4 °C. The cell pellet was then extracted with 10 mls 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.15 m NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100. The pellets were then frozen at -20 °C. The supernatants were treated with 100 μg/ml Pronase (Sigma) for 3 h at 37 °C. The Pronase was heat-inactivated at 80 °C for 15 mins. The samples were then applied to a DEAE HiTrap (Amersham Biosciences) column for purification. The column was washed extensively with 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.3 m NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100. The column was eluted with 1 m NaCl in the phosphate Triton buffer. The recovered HS and chondroitin sulfate chains were dialyzed against 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCL, pH 8.0, concentrated 10-fold by reverse osmosis against 20% polyethylene glycol, added 5 mm CaCl2, and then digested with 0.1 unit/ml chondroitinase ABC for 4 h at 37 °C. The intact HS chains were then recovered by reapplication to a DEAE HiTrap column as described above, but without Triton X-100 in the buffers. The samples were then lyophilized. The HS from the cell pellet was also purified in this manner but with the modification that, after Pronase treatment, the pellets were then digested with 6.25 units/ml (RQ1) DNase (Promega) for 30 mins at 37 °C and then heat inactivated at 65 °C for 10 mins. The disaccharide composition of HS was determined after depolymerization with heparinases I, II, and III, and separation on SAX-HPLC disaccharides were identified by comparing elution positions with disaccharide standards as described previously (11Merry C.L.

HS was hydrolyzed at positions of N-sulfation by low pH (1.5) nitrous acid and the depolymerization products were resolved by gel filtration on Bio-Gel P.10 and SAX-HPLC (12Jayson G.C. Lyon M.

Immunofluorescence—For the cellular localization of Noggin, live cells grown on glass coverslips were washed twice with warm serum-free medium, incubated with primary antibodies for Noggin (RP57–16 at 4.4 mg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C, and then washed twice with PBS. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, washed twice with PBS, and then permeabilized in 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for 15 min. The cells were again washed twice with PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies mixed with Oregon Green Phalloidin (Molecular Probes) at 1:200 for 30 min at 22 °C. The cells were washed twice in PBS followed by a water rinse, then mounted in ProLong Antifade (Molecular Probes). Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed with a confocal microscope configured with krypton and UV with the appropriate wavelength filters (568 and 488 nm) for CY3 and Phalloidin excitation. For the assessment of cellular responsiveness to BMP4, live cells grown on glass coverslips were washed twice and then incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in warm serum-free medium. They were then subsequently washed twice with PBS and incubated with BMP4 at 250 ng/ml for 30 mins at 37 °C. Cells were washed two times with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, washed twice more with PBS, and then permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. After three additional washes with PBS, they were quenched with freshly prepared 0.1% sodium borohydride for 5 mins at 22°C and then given one final wash with PBS. Prior to the addition of primary antibody, cells were blocked by incubating with 10% goat serum and 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h at 22°C. Cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a 1:100 dilution of anti-PhosphoSMAD 1,5,8 (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). The cells were then washed three times with PBS and incubated with CY3 donkey anti-rabbit at 1:200 for 45 min at 22°C. After three washes in PBS and a water rinse, the coverslips were then mounted in ProLong Antifade (Molecular Probes) and evaluated by standard immunofluorescence microscopy. Noggin Binds Selectively to Heparan Sulfate at the Cell Surface—Our previous studies established that Noggin binds to heparin in vitro and to heparan sulfate on the surface of cultured cells (7Paine-Saunders S. Viviano B.L. Economides A.N. Saunders S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2089-2096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In support of the selectivity of this interaction, we performed pulse-chase experiments in which we found that Noggin was displaced from the cell surface by heparin, but not by chondroitin sulfate. In the present studies our goal was to further identify the specificity of the Noggin-glycosaminoglycan interaction at the cell surface. Because heparin is more highly sulfated than chondroitin sulfate and, therefore, has a higher net negative charge, we wanted to see if heparan sulfate with its lower net negative charge, but with similar structural features as heparin, had the same activity. CHOK1 cells, stably expressing human Noggin, were pulse-labeled with Trans 35S-Label for 30 min and then chased in unlabeled media in the presence or absence of glycosaminoglycans, as we have described previously (7Paine-Saunders S. Viviano B.L. Economides A.N. Saunders S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2089-2096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Labeled Noggin was detected in the total cell layer at each time point by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. The amount of labeled Noggin was quantified and is shown in Fig. 1; it is plotted as the log Noggin recovered as a function of time. Heparan sulfate derived from porcine mucosa (Fig. 1, HS, open diamonds) had equal activity to heparin (Fig. 1, Heparin, open squares) in the displacement of Noggin from the plasma membrane. By contrast, neither chondroitin sulfate (Fig. 1, CS, open triangles), which has a higher net negative charge than does heparan sulfate, nor dermitan sulfate (Fig. 1, DS, open circles), which contains iduronic acid and is therefore structurally more related to heparan sulfate, had any activity. Similarly, the unsulfated glycosaminoglycan hyaluronic acid (Fig. 1, HA, crossed squares) was unable to displace Noggin from the cell surface. Together, these results imply that Noggin interacts with heparan sulfate in a structurally specific manner and suggested that further experimentation was warranted to elucidate the structural features required for this interaction. Size Dependence of Noggin Glycosaminoglycan Interactions—To establish the minimum size requirement for the interaction between Noggin and heparan sulfate or heparin, we assessed the ability of various sizes of heparin fragments to displace Noggin from the CHO cell surface. As above, CHOK1 cells stably expressing Noggin were pulse-labeled with Trans 35S-Label for 30 min and then chased in unlabeled media in the presence or absence of equivalent amounts of heparin fragments of defined size, previously isolated by gel filtration chromatography. Labeled Noggin was recovered from the cell layer by immunoprecipitation and analyzed by gel electrophoresis as above. As shown in Fig. 2, heparin fragments of 10–12 saccharides in length (Fig. 2, dp 10, dp 12), had equal activity in the displacement of cell-surface Noggin as did intact heparin (Fig. 2, Heparin, open squares). Heparin fragment of either 4 (Fig. 2, dp 4, open diamonds) or 6 (dp 6, open circles) saccharides in length were inactive, whereas heparin fragments 8 saccharides in length (dp 8, open triangles) had intermediate activity. This suggests that the optimum structural requirement for Noggin binding to heparan sulfate requires a sulfated sequence of 10–12 mono-saccharides in binding site length, similar in size to that required for the interaction between heparan sulfate and the extracellular matrix proteins fibronectin and endostatin (13Lyon M.

Hohenester E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6240-6248Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Noggin Binding to Heparan Sulfate Depends upon N-, 6-O-, and 2-O-Sulfation—To determine whether Noggin requires specific structural features of the heparan sulfate chain for binding, we repeated similar pulse-chase immunoprecipitation experiments in which we assessed the ability of chemically modified heparin chains to displace cell surface-bound Noggin. Heparin which has been fully desulfated (Fig. 3, open diamonds) shows no activity in the displacement of cell-surface Noggin, confirming the essential requirement for sulfate groups in the binding of Noggin. Similarly, heparin chains which have been either merely N-desulfated (Fig. 3, crossed squares), or N-desulfated and reacetylated (Fig. 3, crossed diamonds) are also inactive, indicating that specifically N-sulfate residues are essential for Noggin binding. Both 6-O (Fig. 3, open triangles) and 2-O-desulfated heparins (Fig. 3, open circles) show a similar significant but partial loss of activity. Although not forming as strong a structural feature of the Noggin binding site, as is apparently the case for N-sulfation, these results suggest that sulfation at 6-O and 2-O positions are also critical for Noggin binding. Together these results imply that Noggin typically binds to the most highly modified domains along the polymer chain of HS. The Enzyme Qsulf1 Selectively Targets the Catalytic Removal of 6-O-Sulfate Groups within the S Domains of Heparan Sulfate—The enzyme known as Qsulf1 is a developmentally regulated cell-surface protein with strong homology to lysosomal heparan sulfate 6-O-sulfatase. To further evaluate the specificity of this enzyme, stable clones of CHO cells were prepared expressing either the native Qsulf1 or a mutant enzyme bearing conversion of two critical cysteines, which are required for catalytic activity, to alanines (C89A,C90A) (8Dhoot G.K. Gustafsson M.K. Ai X. Sun W. Standiford D.M. Emerson Jr., C.P. Science. 2001; 293: 1663-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The trypsin released heparan sulfate from the surface of CHO cells transfected with either the native or mutant Qsulf 1 enzyme was degraded by heparinases, and the disaccharides were analyzed by SAX-HPLC. The HS from cells harboring the mutated enzyme had a typical HS composition that was composed of near-equal amounts of N-acetylated and N-sulfated units, with 6-O-sulfates present as ΔHexA-GlcNAc,6S, ΔHexA-GlcNS,6S, and ΔHexA,2S-GlcNS,6S. In total, 9% (based on 3H-label) of disaccharides were 6-O-sulfated (Fig. 4). The HS isolated from cells transfected with the native Qsulf1 enzyme had a nearly identical content of N-acetylated and N-sulfated units as that from cells containing the mutant enzyme; however, there was a striking difference in relative amounts of the trisulphated species (ΔHexA,2S-GlcNS,6S), which was reduced by about 80%; this reduction was accompanied by a significant increase in the disulphated component ΔHexA,2S-GlcNS (Fig. 4). The amounts of the other two 6-O-sulfated units were unaffected. To determine the location of action of Qsulf1 along the heparan sulfate chain, we performed nitrous acid cleavage of the same chains. Low pH (1.5) nitrous acid specifically cleaves N-sulfated disaccharides by deaminative scission; N-acetylated units are unaffected. Analysis of scission products by high resolution gel filtration on Bio-Gel P.10 reflects the domain organization of HS in which most of the GlcNS residues are in either contiguous sequences (S domains) or in regions of alternating N-acetylated and N-sulfated units (mixed sequences or NA/NS domains). S domains are degraded to disaccharides by nitrous acid, NA/NS regions yield tetrasaccharides, and larger oligomers (dp6 and above) are derived from sections of the polymer chain composed of sequences of two or more N-acetylated units interrupted by GlcNS residues. The HNO2 profiles from HS produced by cells expressing the native or mutant enzyme were virtually identical, indicating that transfection with the Qsulf1 enzyme did not affect the formation of the domain structure of HS (Fig. 5). Sulfation present in the tetrasaccharide peak is due mainly to 6-O-sulfation of amino sugars (GlcNAc and GlcNSO3). The amounts of 35S-label (evaluated on the basis of the 3H:35S ratio) were similar in the tetrasaccharide fragments, suggesting that the native enzyme was unable to remove 6-O-sulfate groups from the NA/NS domains. The tetrasaccharides were further examined by SAX-HPLC, and the profiles showed similar proportions of non-, mono-, and di-O-sulfated structures (Fig. 6). This finding essentially confirms that the Qsulf1 enzyme does not attack 6-sulfates in the NA/NS regions; its principal target is 6-O-sulfate groups in trisulphated disaccharides (HexA,2SGlcNS,6S) which occur almost exclusively in the S domains of HS.Fig. 6Tetrasaccharide analysis of heparan sulfate from cells expressing Qsulf1 reveals the selective action of this enzyme on S domains. The tetrasaccharide peaks from the nitrous acid-degraded heparan sulfate (Fig. 5) was fractionated on SAX-HPLC as described in the legend to Fig. 4.

This suggested that Noggin might actually bind to the S domains of heparan sulfate where the trisulfated disaccharides (HexA2S-GlcNS,6S) reside. Because Qsulf1 seems to selectively target these regions of the heparan sulfate chain, we reasoned that Qsulf1 might modulate cell-surface binding of Noggin. To assess this possibility, the CHO cells stably expressing Noggin, used in the studies above, were subsequently transfected with either Qsulf1 or the mutant enzyme and selected for stable expression. As described above, pulse-chase analysis of these cells was performed, followed by immunoprecipitation of cell layer-associated Noggin and its quantification after PAGE-gel electrophoresis. Cells expressing active Qsulf1 (Fig. 7, diamonds) had significantly increased clearance of Noggin from the cell layer when compared with control cells (Fig. 7, triangles) not expressing enzyme. Cells expressing MutQSulf1 (Fig. 1, circles) in which the catalytic site of the enzyme has been mutated revealed identical pulse-chase kinetics as control cells. This altered kinetics of Noggin release results in dramatically altered steady-state levels of Noggin on the cell surface, as detected by immunohistochemistry of fixed, non-permeabilized cells. As we have described previously, CHO cells expressing Noggin display abundant punctate localization of this protein at the cell surface, where it is bound by means of heparan sulfate (Fig. 8A). In contrast, cells simultaneously expressing Qsulf1 show a dramatic reduction in cell-surface Noggin (Fig. 8G). A similar reduction in level of cell-surface Noggin was detected (Fig. 8E) even with lower levels of Qsulf1 expression (Fig. 8K). Only at extremely low levels of Qsulf1 expression (Fig. 8K) did cell-surface staining return to near-control levels. As in the case of the pulse-chase analysis, loss of cell-surface localization depended upon intact enzyme activity, as shown by co-expression of mutated Qsulf1 (Fig. 8I). Release of Cell-surface Noggin by Qsulf1 Activity Results in BMP4 Responsiveness—In our previous studies we have shown that Noggin, bound to the cell surface through an interaction with heparan sulfate, remains functional at that location in the binding of BMP4. In our present study we have shown that Qsulf1 catalytic activity results in the release of this Noggin from the plasma membrane. Therefore, we would predict that the activity of Qsulf1 functions to release the localized BMP inhibitory activity of Noggin near the plasma membrane, thus resulting in an increased accessibility of BMP to its signaling receptor at the plasma membrane and an increased BMP responsiveness of the cell. To access this, QS3-NG and QMut-NG cells (Fig. 8) were incubated in serum-free medium and treated with BMP4 in culture. After stimulation with BMP4, cells were permeabilized and their responsiveness was accessed by the detection of phosphoSMAD 1,5,8 using immunofluorescence. QMut-"

AID is known to deaminate cytidines in single-stranded DNA, but the relationship of this step to the class switch or somatic hypermutation processes is not entirely clear. We have studied the activity of a recombinant form of the mouse AID protein that was purified from a baculovirus expression system. We find that the length of the single-stranded DNA target is critical to the action of AID at the Cs positioned anywhere along the length of the DNA. The DNA sequence surrounding a given C influences AID deamination efficiency. AID preferentially deaminates Cs in the WRC motif, and additionally has a small but consistent preference for purine at the position after the WRC, thereby favoring WRCr (the lowercase r corresponds to the smaller impact on activity).

Three genetic modifications occur at immunoglobulin loci. The first is V(D)J recombination, which involves the assembly of the variable domain exon of the heavy and light chains from V, D, and J subexons. The second is class switch recombination (CSR), 1The abbreviations used are: CSR, class switch recombination; AID, activation-induced cytidine deaminase; SHM, somatic hypermutation; GST, glutathione S-transferase; UNG, uracil nucleotide glycosylase; nt, nucleotide. 1The abbreviations used are: CSR, class switch recombination; AID, activation-induced cytidine deaminase; SHM, somatic hypermutation; GST, glutathione S-transferase; UNG, uracil nucleotide glycosylase; nt, nucleotide. which involves changing the heavy chain from Igμ to Igγ, Igα, or Igϵ (1Dunnick W. Hertz G.Z. Scappino L. Gritzmacher C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). This results in a change in the Ig protein from IgM to IgG, IgA, or IgE, respectively. The third genetic modification is the introduction of point mutations in the Ig variable domain exons of the heavy and light chains. This is called somatic hypermutation (SHM) and is responsible for the affinity maturation of antibodies (2Papavasiliou F.N. Schatz D.G. Cell. 2002; 109: S35-S44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The latter two processes are not dependent on each other, although they both occur in the germinal centers of peripheral lymphoid tissues and share some common features. Specifically, they both require transcription through the target region (2Papavasiliou F.N. Schatz D.G.

AID shares sequence homology to a cytidine deaminase, Apobec-1 (6Muramatsu M. Sankaranand V.S. Anant S. Sugai M. Kinoshita K. Davidson N.O. Honjo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18470-18476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar), the catalytic subunit of a large mRNA editing enzyme complex. Because of this sequence homology, AID was initially thought to represent an mRNA editing activity critical for changing the property of the CSR recombinase and/or SHM mutagenesis machinery (10Doi T. Kinoshita K. Ikegawa M. Muramatsu M. Honjo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2634-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, key observations from the Neuberger and co-workers (11Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Harris R.S. Neuberger M.S. Nature. 2002; 418: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar, 12Di Noia J. Neuberger M.S. Nature. 2002; 419: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) indicated that, instead of being an RNA deaminase, AID actually deaminates cytosines in DNA. Therefore, instead of being an RNA modifier, AID actually appeared more likely to be a key component of the CSR recombinase machinery. This hypothesis was further strengthened by biochemical evidence demonstrating that purified recombinant AID deaminates C in single-stranded DNA (13Bransteitter R. Pham P. Scharff M.D. Goodman M.F.

Previous work has shown that RNA:DNA hybrids form upon transcription through class switch regions in vitro (17Reaban M.E. Lebowitz J. Griffin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21850-21857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Daniels G.A. Lieber M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 5006-5011Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 19Tian M. Alt F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24163-24172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that the conformation of these in vitro RNA:DNA hybrids is that of an R-loop (20Yu K. Chedin F. Hsieh C.L. Wilson T.E. Lieber M.R. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). More importantly, we have shown that chromosomal DNA has an R-loop conformation at the in vivo switch regions of stimulated primary B cells (20Yu K. Chedin F. Hsieh C.L. Wilson T.E. Lieber M.R. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Interestingly, single-stranded DNA is an intrinsic property of the R-loop structure found in the switch regions of stimulated B cell chromosomes (20Yu K. Chedin F. Hsieh C.L. Wilson T.E. Lieber M.R. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). The R-loop structure is thought to be a key target element in CSR. It has also been suggested that a transcription bubble provides enough single-strandedness in the VDJ region to allow AID-mediated SHM (21Ramiro A.R. Stavropoulos P. Jankovic M. Nussenzweig M.C. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 5: 452-456Crossref Scopus (359) Google Scholar). All of these findings favor a DNA deaminase model for both CSR and SHM (22Fugmann S.D. Schatz D.G. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 429-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and an R-loop structure for the CSR substrate. Despite a recent series of reports on AID biochemistry, much remains to be learned concerning AID function. Different forms of recombinant AID from various laboratories have shown some contradictory properties. One group has provided data that the AID deamination target is a WRC (W = A or T; R = A or G) hotspot motif (23Pham P. Bransteitter R. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. Nature. 2003; 424: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), which is similar to the RGYW/WRCY hotspot identified from in vivo studies (24Shapiro G.S. Aviszus K. Murphy J. Wysocki L.J. J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2990-2994Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). One group has shown that AID is activated by removal of RNA by RNase A (23Pham P. Bransteitter R. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. Nature. 2003; 424: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), but two other groups reported that RNase A had no effect (15Dickerson S.K. Market E. Besmer E. Papavasiliou F.N. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1291-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 16Sohail A. Klapacz J. Samaranayake M. Ullah A. Bhagwat A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2990-2994Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), leaving the issue of RNase A-activation unclear. Here, we examined the activity of a recombinant form of the mouse AID protein purified using a baculovirus expression system. We find that the length of the single-stranded DNA target is critical to the action of AID at the Cs positioned anywhere along the length of the DNA. Having established the minimum optimal length, we did further analyses on how the DNA sequence context influences AID activity. We have kept the sequence surrounding each C identical so that the sites are fully comparable. We find that AID preferentially deaminates Cs in the WRC motif and additionally has a small but consistent preference for purine at the position after the WRC, thereby favoring WRCr, where the lowercase r designates the smaller impact. Oligonucleotide Substrate—All oligonucleotides were synthesized by Qiagen/Operon Technologies (Richmond, CA). Oligonuleotides used to determine the suitable AID substrate length are as follows: KY333 (5′-TTTTTTTTTACGATTTTTTT-3′, 20mer); KY334 (5′-TTTTTTTTTTTACGATTTTTTTTT-3′, 24mer); KY335 (5′-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTACGATTTTTTTTTTTT-3′, 30mer). Uracil-DNA-glycosylase (UDG) substrates are: KY414 (5′-TTTTTTTAUGATTTTT-3′, 16 mer); KY415 (5′-TTTTTTTTTAUGATTTTTTT-3′, 20 mer); KY416 (5′-TTTTTTTTTTTAUGATTTTTTTTT-3′, 24 mer). All other oligonucleotides used are indicated in the specified figures. Recombination Protein—Mouse AID cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Tasuku Honjo. The glutathione S-transferase (GST) coding sequence was obtained from pAcG2T (Pharmingen). A PCR reaction was used to construct the GST-mAID DNA fragment with an enterokinase recognition site between the GST and mAID. The GST-mAID coding region was fully sequenced. Recombinant baculovirus (vKY9) was made using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system from Invitrogen according to the manufacturer's instructions. SF21 cells (Invitrogen) were infected with vKY9 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 and harvested 3 days after infection. Cells were resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) that contains a mixture of proteinase inhibitors and sonicated. The cell lysate was ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the clear cell extract was mixed with glutathione agarose (Sigma). The glutathione agarose was washed 5 times with 10 volumes (relative to bed volume) of buffer A and GST-mAID recombinant protein was eluted with an equal volume (relative to bed volume) of buffer B (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm reduced glutathione, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The AID protein on a Coomassie stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel is shown in Fig. 1A. Deamination Assay—The AID activity assay is shown schematically in Fig. 1B. Uracil generated by AID can be removed from DNA by UNG, resulting in an abasic (AP) site. DNA cleavage at AP sites can be introduced by alkali treatment at elevated temperatures (95 °C) (26Abner C.W. Lau A.Y. Ellenberger T. Bloom L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13379-13387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Therefore, DNA cleavage can serve as a readout for AID-mediated cytidine deamination. The reaction mixture (10 μl) containing 200 fmol of radioisotope-labeled oligonucleotide substrate, 50 ng (1 pmol) of GST-mAID, 100 ng of RNase A, and 0.1 unit (1 unit catalyzes the release of 1 nmol of uracil in one h at 37 °C) of UNG (Invitrogen) was incubated for 10min at 37 °C in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 μl of 2 m NaOH and heated for 5 min at 95 °C. Eleven microliters of formamide were then added and samples were heated at 100 °C for 5 min and plunged in an ice water bath. Reaction products were separated on 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gels running in 1× Tris borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer. Gels were visualized by autoradiography using a phosphor-imager FX (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) and quantified with Quantity One software (version 4.2). A time course of a typical reaction for two different DNA substrates is shown in Fig. 2. AID Activity Assay—Recombinant mouse AID with an N-terminal GST fusion was expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells and affinity-purified to near homogeneity (Fig. 1A). Purified GST-mAID protein was tested for its ability to deaminate C residues in DNA. Excess uracil glycosylase was added (see “Experimental Procedures”) in the assay to ensure that AID-mediated deamination is the rate-limiting step in the complete reaction. The difference in AID-mediated deamination efficiency is directly reflected in the percentage of cleaved product in each reaction. Consistent with earlier studies (13Bransteitter R. Pham P. Scharff M.D. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4102-4107Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar), our GST-mAID protein is active only on C nucleotides located in the single-stranded DNA region (Fig. 3), but not on double-stranded DNA or on an RNA:DNA hybrid (data not shown). GST-mAID activity requires RNase A treatment (Fig. 3A), consistent with an earlier study (13Bransteitter R. Pham P. Scharff M.D. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4102-4107Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). A time course showed that the deamination reaction plateaus at ∼15-20 min (Fig. 2). Therefore, all deamination assays were carried out for 10 min at which time the reaction is still in the linear range. DNA Length-dependence of the Action of AID at Cytidines—In the course of optimizing the assay, we wondered whether the length of the single-stranded DNA substrate would influence the activity of AID at a single C imbedded in the middle of the DNA. Oligonucleotides with identical sequence surrounding the C nucleotide, but differing only in length, show markedly different deamination efficiencies (Fig. 3). A 20-mer gave a minimal 5.3% conversion; whereas under the same reaction conditions, a 24-mer resulted in 49% conversion. Increasing substrate length to 30 nt further enhanced the efficiency to 62%. Additional studies showed that this length effect plateaus at 26 nt (Fig. 3B). Repositioning of the C residue (AGCA) closer to the 5′- or 3′-end of the single-stranded DNA substrate, without changing the oligonucleotide length, also showed little effect on deamination efficiency (data not shown). The observed substrate length effect was not conferred by UNG, because it cleaves the synthetic uracil-containing oligonucleotides (mimicking the AID deamination products) with the same efficiency, independent of the length of the substrate (Fig. 3C). It is also known that UNG can act on oligonucleotides as short as three nucleotides (27Varshney U. van de Sande J.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4055-4061Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for the AID substrate length effect is not known. However, it is an important factor to be taken into consideration when oligonucleotide substrates are designed and as the mechanism of AID is considered at endogenous substrate sites. Quantitation of the Sequence Preferences of AID on Single-stranded DNA—The simple substrate configuration chosen for our studies permits a characterization of how the immediate sequence surrounding the C influences the activity of AID. We synthesized 27 oligonucleotides to determine AID preferred deamination sites (Fig. 4A). The length of each substrate was 26 nt, sufficient for maximal AID-mediated cytidine deamination. Each substrate had a string of 11 Ts on both sides of the 5′NNCN3′ motif. N can be any of the 3 nucleotides, A, G, or T. This creates a total of 27 possible combinations. C is excluded in creating the combination to avoid the complication of having two AID targets in the same substrate. Within the NNCN sequence, we named the first position -2, the second position -1, the C, 0, and 3′-most position +1. These substrates were tested for AID deamination efficiency. We found that all combinations that fit the WRCN motif (W = A or T, R = A or G) gave more than 50% conversion in our assays, in contrast to the non-WRCN substrates (Fig. 4A). The +1 position of N-2N-1C0N+1 has a minor but consistent impact on AID deamination activity. We found that a T residue at this position confers a consistently lower activity compared with A or G. This is true for all 9 groups of substrates, whose members differ only at that position. Hence, the optimal substrate is WRCr, where the lowercase r indicates that this position has a smaller impact than the WR positions at -2 and -1, respectively. It is important to note that the full range of sequences can be deaminated, despite the preferences noted. Next, we tested substrates with more than one C. Because the +1 position has a small impact on AID activity, we chose not to vary the nucleotide at this position; hence, seven multiple C substrates were tested with an A maintained constant at the +1 position. A caveat concerning the analysis of oligonucleotides with more than one C is that deamination (and therefore, cleavage) of the C closest to the 5′ label will mask the deamination of further downstream Cs. Nevertheless, the WRC rule observed above is largely preserved with these substrates (Fig. 4B). In most of the seven double-C substrates, the C residues do not conform to a WRC motif, and these substrates generally have low deamination efficiency. The first C in substrate 30 (TGCC) fits the WRC motif and deaminates very efficiently. However, the second C in substrate 28 (TACC), which also fits the WRC motif, deaminates only moderately. The other interesting exception is that the second C in substrate 33 (CGCT) gives moderate deamination efficiency, even though it does not conform to the WRC motif (Fig. 4B). Overall, our deamination comparisons clearly show that AID prefers C residues that are in the WRCr context. We determined the AID site preference using a comprehensive set of fully comparable oligonucleotide substrates. Our data and that of others (23Pham P. Bransteitter R. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. Nature. 2003; 424: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) suggest that the 5′RGYW3′/5′WRCY3′ hotspot motif found in somatic hypermutation may be largely due to AID enzyme site preference. Our consensus is WRCr, given a small but consistent preference at the +1 position for purines. RGYW is generally regarded as the hotspot for somatic hypermutation based on the analysis of endogenous genomic immunoglobulin genes (24Shapiro G.S. Aviszus K. Murphy J. Wysocki L.J. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2302-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). G is the most heavily mutated residue within that motif. The complementary strand of the 5′RGYW3′ hotspot is 5′WRCY3′. It is easy to understand the presence of G in the RGYW hotspot because AID deaminates the complementary C in WRCY. However, we did not observe the preference for Y in the WRCY (corresponding to the R in RGYW) motif in our deamination assays. Instead, we found that it is slightly favored to have R at that position. Considering the smaller effect at this position, the hotspot preference determined by our assay is best described as a 5′WRCr3′ motif (and the complementary sequence would be 5′yGYW 3′). We also observed some deviations from the WRC preference. For example, the second C in CGCT, which does not conform to a WRC motif, shows a moderate to high deamination efficiency. This illustrates that although AID activity is influenced by the surrounding sequence, local structural factors probably underlie this in a manner that is not fully described by primary sequence. Although a sequence preference in somatic hypermutation is not surprising given known hotspots, what might be the relevance of a WRC preference in class switch recombination? After completing this study, we realized several interesting sequence features relevant to this point. First, WRC is common in the switch regions of all vertebrates. It is commonly present in the form of 5′-AGCT-3′ or 5′-AGCA-3′ on the G-rich strand (non-template strand). This is the case in vertebrates as distant as Xenopus from human (28Kitao H. Arakawa H. Kuma K. Yamagishi H. Nakamura N. Furusawa S. Matsuda H. Yasuda M. Ekino S. Shimizu A. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Second, AGCT is a palindrome; hence, the anti-parallel strand reads 5′-AGCT-3′ as well, thereby conforming to the WRC motif. Although AGCA is not a palindrome, the anti-parallel strand is TGCT, which also conforms to the WRC motif. AID may act on the WRC motifs on the two strands concurrently, given that the edges of the R-loop may have single-stranded character on the C-rich (template) DNA strand as well (19Tian M. Alt F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24163-24172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). If this were the case, then a double-strand break would result, consistent with the known features of class switch recombination (1Dunnick W. Hertz G.Z. Scappino L. Gritzmacher C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). These aspects may explain the relevance of the WRC motif to class switch recombination. In this regard, it is interesting that recent work has shown that a G-rich region, when substituted for the Sγ1 switch region was able to form R-loops in vitro (29Shinkura R. Tian M. Khuong C. Chua K. Pinaud E. Alt F.W. Nature Immunol. 2003; 4: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). However, its ability to undergo class switch recombination was about 13-fold lower than the normal Sγ1, and the basis for this lower efficiency was unclear (29Shinkura R. Tian M. Khuong C. Chua K. Pinaud E. Alt F.W. Nature Immunol. 2003; 4: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In light of the WRC motif observation noted above, it is noteworthy that the G-rich region used in that study had very few WRC motifs, and the few which were present did not have one nearby on the anti-parallel strand. Hence, WRC motifs close together on the two DNA strands may be quite important for class switch recombination in a manner that has not been previously considered. Unlike class switch regions, V(D)J regions are unlikely to form RNA:DNA hybrids upon transcription, and hence, the required single-strandedness in the V(D)J region could not be generated by an extensively displaced non-template strand. It has been hypothesized that the non-template strand is single-stranded transiently at the transcription bubble, which would then serve as a target for AID. Indeed, recent studies have shown that AID preferentially acts on the non-template strand when transcription is carried out in vitro or in Escherichia coli (16Sohail A. Klapacz J. Samaranayake M. Ullah A. Bhagwat A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2990-2994Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 21Ramiro A.R. Stavropoulos P. Jankovic M. Nussenzweig M.C. Nat.

It is interesting to note, however, that the RGYW motif found at hotspots for SHM is not strand-specific (30Milstein C. Neuberger M.S. Staden R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8791-8794Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 31Michael N. Martin T.E. Nicolae D. Kim N. Padjen K. Zhan P. Nguyen H. Pinkert C. Storb U. Immunity. 2002; 16: 123-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Therefore, both strands of the V(D)J region should be equally accessible to AID. Reconciliation of the substrate specificity of AID with the precise structural features of its endogenous substrates awaits further investigation. A recent study used AID deamination to introduce mutations into a single-stranded LacZα genetic reporter located on an otherwise double-stranded circular substrate (23Pham P. Bransteitter R. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. Nature. 2003; 424: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). That study reached a similar conclusion regarding the sequence preference, namely that AID prefers the WRC motif. The agreement on the sequence preference is stronger given that both a biological readout and a purely biochemical one have yielded similar results. We observed a DNA substrate length dependence for AID action on single-stranded DNA. Given the small size of AID (24 kDa) we anticipated that 16-20 nt would be sufficient. In fact, ≥ 24 nts is necessary to reach full or nearly full activity on single-stranded DNA. This surprising length dependence may reflect a larger than expected footprint size of AID, but multimerization of AID is another possibility (14Chaudhuri J. Tian M. Khuong C. Chua K. Pinaud E. Alt F.W. Nature. 2003; 422: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 32Ta V.T. Nagaoka H. Catalan N. Durandy A. Fischer A. Imai K. Nonoyama S. Tashiro J. Ikegawa M. Ito S. Kinoshita K.

Shikonins, the naphthoquinone pigments present in the root tissues of Lithospermum erythrorhizon Sieb. et Zucc.

In this study, we evaluated the effects of shikonin and its derivatives on the transcriptional activation of human TNF-α promoter in a gene gun-transfected mouse skin system by using a luciferase reporter gene assay. The crude plant extract of L. erythrorhizon as well as derived individual compounds shikonin, isobutyryl shikonin, acetyl shikonin, dimethylacryl shikonin and isovaleryl shikonin showed significant dose-dependent inhibition of TNF-α promoter activation. Among the tested compounds, shikonin and isobutyryl shikonin exhibited the highest inhibition of TNF-α promoter activation and also showed significant suppression of transgenic human TNF-α mRNA expression and protein production. We demonstrated that shikonin-inhibitory response was retained in the core TNF-α promoter region containing the TATA box and a 48-bp downstream sequence relative to the transcription start site. Further our results indicated that shikonin suppressed the basal transcription and activator-regulated transcription of TNF-α by inhibiting the binding of transcription factor IID protein complex (TATA box-binding protein) to TATA box. These in vivo results suggest that shikonins inhibit the transcriptional activation of the human TNF-α promoter through interference with the basal transcription machinery.

Naphthoquinone compounds present in root extracts of a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, Lithospermum erythrorhizon Sieb. et Zucc. (LE), have been reported to confer many medicinal properties such as antibacterial, wound healing, anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, and antitumor effects (12Papageorgiou V.P. Assimopoulou A.N.

Among these, shikonin, one of the active components of the roots of LE, has been shown to inhibit the capillary permeability induced by an intradermal injection of histamine and edema caused by a thermal injury to the skin of rats (13Tanaka S. Tajima M. Tsukada M. Tabata M. J. Nat. Prod. 1986; 49: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Subcutaneous administration of shikonin has been reported to inhibit ear edema induced by croton oil in mice and paw swelling induced by yeast in rats (14Wang W.J. Bai J.Y. Liu D.P. Xue L.M. Zhu X.Y. Yaoxue Xuebao. 1994; 29: 161-165Google Scholar). A derivative of shikonin, MDS-004, has strongly inhibited ear edema in a delayed type hypersensitivity model induced by oxazolone and dinitrofluorobenzene (15Seto Y. Motoyoshi S. Nakamura H. Imuta J.

Recent studies suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects of shikonin derivatives may be attributable to several mechanisms of action, e.g. inhibition of leukotriene B4 biosynthesis (14Wang W.J.

Although the efficacy of shikonin and its derivatives has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo, their precise mode of action and the molecular basis for their anti-inflammatory actions in vivo warrants further investigation. Skin is an immune-competent organ that serves as a first line of defense to various assaults, such as exogenous stress, environmental antigens, or pathogens. The skin immune system has been defined as a cutaneous complex of interacting immune response-related cells (21Bos J.D. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1997; 107: 3-5PubMed Google Scholar). In skin, TNF-α is a prominent cytokine that seems to be important in allergic and irritant contact dermatitis and in other inflammatory conditions (22LaDuca J.R. Gaspari A.A. Dermatol. Clin. 2001; 19: 617-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Modulating TNF-α expression in skin may provide therapeutic benefits for a variety of skin disorders. A simple and direct in vivo transfection method, particle-mediated gene transfer by gene gun, has been used for in vivo characterization of mammalian promoters in skin and liver tissues of rats and mice (23Cheng L. Ziegelhoffer P.R. Yang N.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4455-4459Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In this study, we have used a gene gun-transfected mouse skin system to evaluate the effects of a crude extract and individual compounds, shikonin and its derivatives, isolated from the roots of L. erythrorhizon on the transcriptional activity of a transgenic human TNF-α promoter. The current study on the inhibition of TNF-α promoter activity by shikonins has provided us with an additional insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the anti-inflammatory properties of these phytocompounds. This study also demonstrated an in vivo quantitative molecular screening system for the evaluation of anti-inflammatory agents. Mice—Female BALB/c mice (National Laboratory Animal Breeding and Research Center, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China) were maintained under pathogen-free conditions on standard laboratory chow and water in the animal facilities of the Institute of Biological Chemistry, Academia Sinica. All mice used in our experiments were 7-8 weeks old. Chemicals—Hydrocortisone and betamethasone were purchased from Sigma. Chemical solutions were prepared immediately prior to the use in 70% polyethylene glycol 400 and 30% ethanol solvent. Croton oil was purchased from Fluka Chemie GmbH (Buchs, Switzerland) and diluted in acetone prior to use. Plasmid Constructs—The pGL2 luciferase reporter vector containing the human TNF-α promoter (a generous gift from Dr. Robert L. Danner, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) was used as a template to generate a -1049 to +48 bp TNF-α promoter region flanked by MluI and BglII restriction sites using PCR and cloned into the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The resultant plasmid was designated as pTNFP-Luc. Plasmid pIL2P-Luc was constructed by isolating a -1437 to +50 bp region of human interleukin-2 promoter flanked by MluI and BglII restriction sites from human genomic DNA through PCR and cloning into the pGL3-Basic vector. The promoterless pGL3-Basic vector was used as a negative control plasmid for luciferase assays. The plasmid pCMV-Luc containing a CMV immediate early gene enhancer/promoter has been described elsewhere (24Thompson T.A. Gould M.N. Burkholder J.K. Yang N.S. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1993; 29: 165-170Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Clone PE4 (ATCC) was used as a template to isolate the 720-bp coding region of human TNF-α gene flanked by NcoI and XbaI restriction sites and subcloned into pTNFP-Luc by replacing the luciferase gene and designated as pTNFP-TNFC. All plasmid constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. A series of 5′-deletions of the human TNF-α promoter were created by PCR using pTNFP-Luc (-1049/+48 bp) as template with specific 5′ primers of defined lengths relative to the transcription start site (-924/+48, -745/+48, -495/+48, -285/+48, -124/+48, and -29/+48 bp) flanked by an MluI site and a common 3′ primer flanked by a BglII site. The PCR products were cloned into pGL3-Basic vector and verified by sequencing. All plasmids used in transient transfection assays were isolated using an endotoxin-free megaplasmid purification kit (Qiagen GmbH). In Vivo Particle-mediated Gene Transfer—The Helios gene gun system (Bio-Rad) was used to transfect the plasmid constructs into mouse skin. Plasmid DNA was precipitated onto 2-μm gold particles in the presence of spermidine and CaCl2 and coated onto the inner surface of Tefzel tubing (25Kuo C.F. Wang J.H. Yang N.S. Gene Therapy Protocols. 2nd Ed. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2002: 137-147Google Scholar). The tubing was cut into 0.5-inch-length cartridges, resulting in the delivery of 0.5 mg of gold and 1.25 μg of plasmid DNA/bombardment. Female BALB/c mice were shaved on a restricted area of the abdomen and disinfected with 70% ethanol. No visual damage to epidermal skin tissue was observed. For each treatment, the target skin area was bombarded twice to deliver 2.5 μg of plasmid DNA coated onto 1 mg of gold particles with a 380 p.s.i. helium gas pressure. The bombarded area was marked with an ink stamp containing a circular sign of 2-cm diameter (3.14 cm2). Isolation and Administration of Herbal Compounds—The roots of the LE plants were air-dried, ground into powder, and extracted by n-hexane at room temperature. The solvent was removed under vacuum, and the resultant material was used as crude extract. Individual compounds were separated and purified by semipreparative HPLC (Waters HPLC system equipped with a Waters 600 controller, Waters Delta 600 pump, and 2487 Dual λ absorbance detector). A 5-μm C18 column (250 × 10 mm, Merck) was used with two solvent systems, acetonitrile-water (80:20, v/v) (A) and methanol (B). Elution was performed as follows: 0-8 min, A:B = 95:5 (isocratic); 8-15 min, 95-80% A to B (linear gradient); 15-40 min, 80-50% B (linear gradient) with a flow rate of 3.5 ml/min with the detection wavelength set at 254 nm. Molecular weights of isolated compounds were as follows: shikonin (SH), 288.30; acetyl shikonin (AS), 330.34; isobutyryl shikonin (IBS), 358.39; β,β-dimethylacryl shikonin (DMAS), 370.40; and isovaleryl shikonin (IVS), 372.41, as determined by mass spectrometry. Molecular structures were assigned based on various spectroscopic techniques including electron ionization mass spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and NMR analysis (Fig. 1). Bidens pilosa L. var. radiata Schult. Bip. (BP), a folk herb reputed for anti-inflammatory activities (26Chih H.W. Lin C.C. Tang K.S. Am. J. Chin. Med. 1995; 23: 273-278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was tested in parallel in this study. The dried aerial parts of BP were ground into powder and extracted by 70% ethanol at room temperature. The solvent was removed under vacuum, and the resultant material was used as a crude extract. Crude extracts and pure compounds were dissolved in an organic solvent containing 70% polyethylene glycol (polyethylene glycol 400) and 30% absolute ethanol prior to administration. A final volume of 20 μl of test extract was pipetted onto the skin area immediately after DNA transfection, spread evenly, and allowed to completely air dry. Untreated transfected skin and transfected skin treated with solvent alone, crude extract of BP, or commercial drugs were used as positive or negative controls. Tissue Extraction and Luciferase Assay—Animals were sacrificed 16 h post-transfection, and transfected skins (2-cm-diameter circles), treated or untreated with test agents, were removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Skin samples were prepared in 500 μl of lysis buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 0.1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors) by scissor mincing followed by sonication and centrifugation of cell debris. Samples were analyzed for luciferase activity (Promega) with a Lumat LB9507 luminometer (Berthold). Duplicate analyses of two aliquots from each test skin sample were performed, and the data were averaged. Promoter activities were measured as total relative light units/site/mouse. Induction of promoter activity was expressed as -fold increase over the control, and inhibition was expressed as percentage of the control. RT-PCR Analysis—The expression of endogenous mouse TNF-α and transgenic human TNF-α mRNAs in mouse skin tissues was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Frozen mouse skin samples were homogenized in liquid nitrogen. The total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and resuspended in 25 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. RT-PCRs were carried out by using the AccessQuick RT-PCR system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly 1 μg of total RNA from each sample was added to the reaction mixture containing 1× AccessQuick master mixture (Tfl DNA polymerase, avian myeloblastosis virus/Tfl reaction buffer, 25 mm MgSO4, and 10 mm dNTP mixture), a 10 μm concentration of each of specific sense and antisense primers, 5 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, and nuclease-free water to obtain a final volume of 50 μl. Reactions were incubated at 48 °C for 60 min, and PCR amplification was carried out after denaturing at 95 °C for 2 min. The primers contained the following sequences: mouse TNF-α sense primer, 5′-ATGAGCACAGAAAGCATGATCCGCGACG-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-GACTCCAAAGTAGACCTGCCCGGACTC-3′; mouse GAPDH sense primer, 5′-CATCACTGCCACCCAGAAGACTGTGGA-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-TACTCCTTGGAGGCCATGTAGGCCATG-3′; human TNF-α sense primer, 5′-GAAAGCATGATCCGGGACGTGGA-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-GTTGGATGTTCGTCCTCCTCACA-3′. The PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose gels (Ultrapure, Invitrogen) at 55 V for 75 min along with a molecular weight marker, GeneRuler 100-bp DNA Ladder (MBI Fermentas) and visualized by UV illumination after staining with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide solution. Gels were photographed with type 55 positive/negative film (Polaroid Corp., Cambridge, MA). Images were scanned, and densitometry analysis of the captured image was performed using BIO-1D image analysis software. The signal intensities of the test genes in different samples were normalized to the respective mouse GAPDH signal intensity. ELISA for TNF-α—Endogenous mouse TNF-α and transgenic human TNF-α cytokine concentrations in mouse skin tissues were determined using OptEIA mouse TNF-α and OptEIA human TNF-α ELISA kits, respectively (Pharmingen). The capture and detection antibodies used were specific for mouse and human TNF-α cytokines. Briefly skin samples were prepared in 1 ml of lysis buffer as described for the luciferase assay. 96-well plates were coated with 100 μl/well anti-mouse or anti-human TNF-α capture antibody (1:500) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Wells were washed three times with wash buffer (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20). Plates were blocked with assay diluent (PBS saline with 10% fetal bovine serum, pH 7.0) for 1 h and then washed. 100 μl of each respective standard, samples, and controls were added, and plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C. After five washes, 100 μl of working detector (biotinylated anti-mouse TNF-α polyclonal (1:500) or biotinylated anti-human TNF-α monoclonal antibody (1:500) and avidin-horseradish peroxidase) was added, and plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After a final wash, tetramethylbenzidine and hydrogen peroxide substrate solution was added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Absorbance was read at 450 nm in an ELISA reader after the addition of stop solution. No cross-reactivity was observed between mouse and human TNF-α cytokines. Western Blot Analysis—Mice were bombarded with gold particles alone or pTNFP-Luc DNA-coated gold particles on their shaven abdomens as described above. Transfected skin was untreated, treated with solvent alone, or treated with shikonin, and skin samples were collected at the indicated time points. For isolation of total protein, mouse skin was excised, immediately placed in liquid nitrogen, and pulverized in mortar. The pulverized skin was lysed in 2 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 20 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitor mixture tablets) for 10 min. Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min, and supernatant containing 30 μg of protein was boiled in SDS sample loading buffer for 10 min before electrophoresis on a 12% NuPAGE BisTris gel (Invitrogen). After electrophoresis for 2 h, proteins in the gel were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Novex, San Diego, CA), and the blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk, PBST buffer (PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20) for 60 min at room temperature. The membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a 1:1000 dilution of phospho-p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (extracellular signal regulated-kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2)) and phospho-NF-κB p65 polyclonal antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Beverly, MA). Equal protein loading was assessed using mouse β-actin (Sigma). The blots were rinsed three times with PBST buffer for 5 min each. Washed blots were incubated with a 1:2000 dilution of the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and then washed again three times with PBST buffer. The transferred proteins were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Mice were treated as described for Western blotting, and skin samples were collected after 1 h. For isolation of nuclear protein, mouse skin was excised, immediately placed in liquid nitrogen, and pulverized in mortar. The pulverized skin was lysed in 2 ml of ice-cold hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2,1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 15 min on ice. To the lysates, 125 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 solution was added, and the mixture was centrifuged for 2 min at 14,800 × g. The pelleted nuclei were washed once with 400 μl of buffer A plus 25 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40, centrifuged, and resuspended in 150 μl of nuclear extract buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 50 mm KCl, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol) for 30 min. The mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing nuclear proteins was collected, and protein concentrations were determined. EMSA was performed using a LightShift chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the -30 bp core promoter element of human TNF-α, 5′-GGACATATAAAGGCAGTTGTTGGCACACCC-3′ (-30 to -1) was end-labeled with biotin (Purigo Biotech, Taipei, Taiwan). Binding reactions were carried out in a total volume of 20 μl containing 1× binding buffer (100 mm Tris, 500 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5), 50 ng/μl poly(dI·dC), 2.5% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 μg of nuclear proteins, and 20 fmol of labeled probe. A 200-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide (competitor) was added where necessary. Where direct binding of shikonin with the probe was tested, nuclear protein was replaced by shikonin in binding reactions. After a 20-min incubation at room temperature, 5 μl of loading buffer was added, and samples were electrophoresed through a 6% native polyacrylamide gel at 100 V. Electrophoresed binding reactions were transferred to nylon membrane and detected by following the manufacturer's instructions. Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical differences were assessed with an unpaired, two-tailed Student's t test. Transcriptional Activity of Transgenic Human TNF-α Promoter in Mouse Skin Tissue—To develop an in vivo molecular screening system for the evaluation and identification of anti-inflammatory phytocompounds, we transfected a proinflammatory cytokine human TNF-α promoter (-1049/+48 bp)-luciferase reporter construct (pTNFP-Luc) into mouse skin via particle-mediated gene transfer using a Helios gene gun. Transgenic promoter activity was measured in terms of luciferase activity expressed in relative light units/defined tissue site (3.14 cm2/mouse). We observed a relatively high level of human TNF-α promoter activity, which was 2370-fold higher than the promoterless negative control vector (pGL3-Basic) and was only 8.4-fold lower than that obtained for a constitutively active CMV immediate early gene enhancer/promoter (pCMV-Luc) in mouse skin (Fig. 2), whereas the luciferase activity obtained from skin samples transfected with pIL2P-Luc vector containing the human interleukin-2 cytokine promoter (-1437/+50 bp) was less than 1% of that observed for the human TNF-α promoter (pTNFP-Luc). Induction of Local Inflammatory Response and Endogenous TNF-α Expression in Mouse Skin Tissue by Gene Gun Particle-mediated Physical Injury/Stress—The relatively high level of human TNF-α promoter activity observed in mouse skin tissue led us to suspect that gene gun particle-mediated physical injury/stress may have resulted in its transcriptional activation. To test this hypothesis, mouse skin tissue was bombarded twice to deliver 1 mg of 2-μm gold particles, without any coated DNA, by using the gene gun at 380 p.s.i. helium gas pressure/bombardment. As shown in Fig. 3A, within 1 min of particle bombardment we observed reddening of skin resulting from an acute local inflammatory response (erythema). Skin samples were collected at different time points, and endogenous mouse TNF-α mRNA expression levels were analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR analysis. A time-dependent induction of endogenous TNF-α expression was observed in gold particle-bombarded skin samples (lanes 2-5) as compared with unbombarded control skin (lane 1) (Fig. 3B). As a positive control (lane 6), topical application of 2% croton oil (non-sensitizing contact irritant) also induced clearly detectable endogenous mouse TNF-α mRNA expression. Densitometry analysis showed a 4.6-fold increase in TNF-α mRNA expression level at the 16-h time point (lane 5) after gold particle bombardment as compared with unbombarded control skin (lane 1) (Fig. 3C). We further analyzed the endogenous mouse TNF-α protein production in response to gene gun particle-mediated physical injury/stress by using a mouse-specific ELISA kit. Gold particle-bombarded skin samples showed a 6.0-fold increase in TNF-α protein production as compared with unbombarded control skin (Table I). These results suggested that gene gun particle-mediated physical injury/stress could induce localized inflammatory response, activate TNF-α promoter, and induce its mRNA expression and protein production. Therefore, this indicated that the particle-mediated physical injury/stress-induced human TNF-α promoter a"
https://openalex.org/W2105599853,"We demonstrate that the presentation of LRP and the subsequent uptake of its ligands by malignant cells are both strongly regulated by MT1-MMP. Because LRP is essential for the clearance of multiple ligands, these findings have important implications for many pathophysiological processes including the pericellular proteolysis in neoplastic cells as well as the fate of the soluble matrix-degrading proteases such as MMP-2. MT1-MMP is a key protease in cell invasion and a physiological activator of MMP-2. Cellular LRP consists of a non-covalently associated 515-kDa extracellular α-chain (LRP-515) and an 85-kDa membrane-spanning β-chain, and plays a dual role as a multifunctional endocytic receptor and a signaling molecule. Through the capture and uptake of several soluble proteases, LRP is involved in the regulation of matrix proteolysis. LRP-515 associates with the MT1-MMP catalytic domain and is highly susceptible to MT1-MMP proteolysis <i>in vitro</i>. Similar to MT1-MMP, the metalloproteinases MT2-MMP, MT3-MMP and MT4-MMP also degrade LRP. The N-terminal and C-terminal parts of the LRP-515 subunit are resistant and susceptible, respectively, to MT1-MMP proteolysis. In cells co-expressing LRP and MT1-MMP, the proteolytically competent protease decreases the levels of cellular LRP and releases its N-terminal portion in the extracellular milieu while the catalytically inert protease co-precipitates with LRP. These events implicate MT1-MMP, not only in the activation of MMP-2, but also in the mechanisms that control the subsequent fate of MMP-2 in cells and tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2097895708,"d-3-Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (Phgdh; EC 1.1.1.95) is the first committed enzyme of l-serine biosynthesis in the phosphorylated pathway. To determine the physiological importance of Phgdh-dependent l-serine biosynthesis in vivo, we generated Phgdh-deficient mice using targeted gene disruption in embryonic stem cells. The absence of Phgdh led to a drastic reduction of l-serine metabolites such as phosphatidyl-l-serine and sphingolipids. Phgdh null embryos have small bodies with abnormalities in selected tissues and died after days post-coitum 13.5. Striking abnormalities were evident in the central nervous system in which the Phgdh null mutation culminated in hypoplasia of the telencephalon, diencephalon, and mesencephalon; in particular, the olfactory bulbs, ganglionic eminence, and cerebellum appeared as indistinct structures. These observations demonstrate that the Phgdh-dependent phosphorylated pathway is essential for normal embryonic development, especially for brain morphogenesis. d-3-Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (Phgdh; EC 1.1.1.95) is the first committed enzyme of l-serine biosynthesis in the phosphorylated pathway.

These observations demonstrate that the Phgdh-dependent phosphorylated pathway is essential for normal embryonic development, especially for brain morphogenesis. Despite its classification as a nutritionally non-essential amino acid, l-serine plays a pivotal role in cellular metabolism. l-Serine is incorporated into proteins and is indispensable for the synthesis of specialized biomolecules essential for cell survival, proliferation, and development. These molecules include glycine, cysteine, phosphatidyl-l-serine, sphingolipids, and nucleotides. In mammals, l-serine can be synthesized de novo from glycolytic intermediates via two different metabolic pathways. In a widely distributed cytosolic pathway, referred to as the phosphorylated pathway, 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (Phgdh 1The abbreviations used are: Phgdh3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenaseESembryonic stemd.p.c.days post-coitumGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenasePEphosphatidylethanolaminePSphosphatidyl-l-serinePCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigenVZventricular zone.1The abbreviations used are: Phgdh3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenaseESembryonic stemd.p.c.days post-coitumGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenasePEphosphatidylethanolaminePSphosphatidyl-l-serinePCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigenVZventricular zone.; EC 1.1.1.95) initiates the reaction by oxidating a glycolytic intermediate, 3-phosphoglycerate, to 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate (1Ichihara A. Greenberg D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 224: 331-340Google Scholar, 2Snell K. Adv. Enzyme. Regul. 1984; 22: 325-400Google Scholar), which then undergoes transamination and dephosphorylation to yield l-serine. Another potential de novo pathway, referred to as the non-phosphorylated pathway, starts with a glycolytic intermediate 2-phosphoglycerate (3Walsh D.A. Sallach H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 4068-4076Google Scholar). In liver, the non-phosphorylated pathway is presumed to operate mainly in the reverse direction for gluconeogenesis (4Rowsell E.V. Snell K. Carnie J.A. Al-Tai A.H. Biochem. J. 1969; 115: 1071-1073Google Scholar). Glycine also can be converted directly into l-serine by serine hydroxymethyltransferase, with N5,N10-methylenetetrahydrofolate acting as a carbon donor (5Narkewicz M.R. Thureen P.J. Sauls S.D. Tjoa S. Nikolayevsky N. Fennessey P.V. Pediatr. Res. 1996; 39: 1085-1090Google Scholar). The relative contribution of these pathways to l-serine biosynthesis in vivo, however, remains to be determined. 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase embryonic stem days post-coitum glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidyl-l-serine proliferating cell nuclear antigen ventricular zone. 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase embryonic stem days post-coitum glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidyl-l-serine proliferating cell nuclear antigen ventricular zone. We have recently identified l-serine to be a key mediator of neurotrophic support that is derived from glial cells (6Mitoma J. Furuya S. Hirabayashi Y. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 30: 195-199Google Scholar, 7Furuya S. Tabata T. Mitoma J. Yamada K. Yamasaki M. Makino A. Yamamoto T. Watanabe M. Kano M. Hirabayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11528-11533Google Scholar). l-Serine is released by glial cells and, in cultured neurons, is an essential component for survival, neuritogenesis, and functional voltage responses (6Mitoma J. Furuya S. Hirabayashi Y. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 30: 195-199Google Scholar, 7Furuya S. Tabata T. Mitoma J. Yamada K. Yamasaki M. Makino A. Yamamoto T. Watanabe M. Kano M. Hirabayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11528-11533Google Scholar). Our previous histological studies demonstrated that Phgdh protein is expressed primarily by neuroepithelial stem cells/radial glia in the germinal zone of embryonic brains and later by astrocytes in mature brains; Phgdh protein, on the other hand, is not expressed by post-mitotic neurons (7Furuya S. Tabata T. Mitoma J. Yamada K. Yamasaki M. Makino A. Yamamoto T. Watanabe M. Kano M. Hirabayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11528-11533Google Scholar, 8Yamasaki M. Yamada K. Furuya S. Mitoma J. Hirabayashi Y. Watanabe M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7691-7704Google Scholar). Thus, it seems very likely that diminished capacity to synthesize l-serine due to lack of Phgdh expression may explain why neurons depend strongly on glial cells for their supply of l-serine (9Furuya S. Watanabe M. Arch. Histol. Cytol. 2003; 66: 109-121Google Scholar). This idea is supported by our finding that neurons cannot maintain synthesis of serine-derived lipids without an external supply of l-serine (10Mitoma J. Kasama T. Furuya S. Hirabayashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19363-19366Google Scholar). Severe neurological consequences, such as congenital microcephaly, psychomotor retardation, and convulsions associated with human PHGDH deficiency, also highlight the significance of the phosphorylated pathway in normal brain development and function (11de Koning T.J. Snell K. Duran M. Berger R. Poll-The B.T. Surtees R. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 653-661Google Scholar). To determine the physiological significance of l-serine bio-synthesis via the phosphorylated pathway in vivo, we generated a line of Phgdh-deficient mice by deleting exons 4 and 5 of Phgdh gene. Heterozygous Phgdh (Phgdh+/-) mice appeared normal, even though they displayed decreased levels of l-serine in the brain. Homozygous Phgdh (Phgdh-/-) mice, however, exhibited early embryonic lethality associated with multiple developmental defects. The present study provides the first genetic evidence that Phgdh, which catalyzes the first committed step in the phosphorylated pathway, is an essential enzyme in mouse embryogenesis. Generation of Phgdh-/-Mice—The murine Phgdh gene localizes to chromosome 3 and is encoded by a single gene with 12 exons. The structural characterization of the gene will be reported elsewhere. 2GenBank accession number AB128936. A 7.5-kb EcoRI restriction DNA fragment representing intron 1 to exon 5 and a 13.3-kb HindIII fragment representing intron 3 to intron 9 of the mouse Phgdh gene isolated from a 129/SvJ BAC library were subcloned into pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene). The 1.7-kb neomycin resistance gene (neowt) controlled by the mouse phosphoglycerate kinase gene promoter and flanked by two loxP sites in the pZ(loxP-pGKNeowt)A vector (a kind gift from Prof. J. Takeda) was inserted at the SacI site in intron 3 (Fig. 1A). To facilitate the deletion of exons 4 and 5, a third loxP site and a NheI site were introduced at the SphI site in intron 5 by inserting annealed oligonucleotides (5′-CTAGCATAACTTCGTATAATGTATGCTATACGAAGTTATGCA-3′ and 5′-CATAACTTCGTATAGCATAGATTATACGAAGTTATGCTAGCATG-3′). A 5.3-kb PstI/EcoRV fragment of intron 3 containing neowt flanked by two loxP sites (5′ arm) and a 5.1-kb EcoRV/NsiI fragment representing intron 3, exon 4, intron 4, exon 5, and intron 5 containing a loxP site (3′ arm) were inserted in pBS/MC1DTpA, a vector employed for negative selection using a diphtheria toxin A fragment (DT-A) gene (a kind gift from Prof. J.

The targeting vector was electroporated into E14 embryonic stem (ES) cells. G418-resistant colonies were screened by Southern blot hybridization of NheI-digested genomic DNA with a digoxigenin-labeled 5′ probe (485 bp) derived from the genomic sequence upstream of the targeting vector (Fig. 1A). Chimeric males harboring heterozygous ES cells carrying the targeted homologous recombination at the Phgdh locus were crossed with C57BL/6J females to obtain germ line transmission of the targeted Phgdh allele (Phgdh+/neo). To produce both Phgdh+/- heterozygous and Phgdh-/- homozygous offspring, we carried out Cre-mediated deletion of targeted alleles in the germ line by crossing Phgdh+/neo heterozygous F1 mice with EIIa Cre deleter mice (a kind gift from Prof. J. Takeda); the adenovirus EIIa promoter drives Cre expression in oocytes and early embryos (13Lakso M. Pichel J.G. Gorman J.R. Sauer B. Okamoto Y. Lee E. Alt F.W. Westphal H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5860-5865Google Scholar). The F2 offspring showed a variable degree of mosaicism for partially Cre-recombined floxed Phgdh alleles in various tissues (data not shown). We efficiently obtained F3 mice that bearing a completely excised Phgdh allele (Phgdh+/-) by crossing Cre-expressing female mosaic mice with wild-type males, as reported previously (14Holzenberger M. Lenzner C. Leneuve P. Zaoui R. Hamard G. Vaulont S. Bouc Y.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: E92Google Scholar). Mice with homozygous mutant Phgdh alleles (Phgdh-/-) were obtained by intercrossing heterozygous mice (Phgdh+/-). We genotyped mice bearing heterozygous and homozygous mutant alleles (Phgdh+/- and Phgdh-/-) by PCR (data not shown) and Southern blot hybridization (Fig. 1, A and B). Biochemical Analysis—Whole heads from embryos at days post-coitum (d.p.c.) 13.5 generated by intercrossing heterozygotes (Phgdh+/-) were homogenized individually in 2 volumes of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA, 0.3 m sucrose, and a protease inhibitor mixture. Cytosolic fractions were obtained by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 50 min. Protein samples (20 μg) were fractionated by 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Blotted proteins were probed with anti-Phgdh (rabbit) antibody (7Furuya S. Tabata T. Mitoma J. Yamada K. Yamasaki M. Makino A. Yamamoto T. Watanabe M. Kano M. Hirabayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11528-11533Google Scholar, 8Yamasaki M. Yamada K. Furuya S. Mitoma J. Hirabayashi Y. Watanabe M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7691-7704Google Scholar) and monoclonal anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (mouse monoclonal, Chemicon) antibody and were visualized with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as a substrate. Lipids were extracted via the Bligh-Dyer method (15Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar) from freeze-dried whole heads of the d.p.c. 13.5 embryos generated as above. The aminophospholipids phosphatidyl-l-serine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were visualized with ninhydrin (10Mitoma J. Kasama T. Furuya S. Hirabayashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19363-19366Google Scholar). The ganglioside GD3 was immuno-stained on TLC (16Furuya S. Irie F. Hashikawa T. Nakazawa K. Kozakai A. Hasegawa A. Sudo K. Hirabayashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32418-32425Google Scholar) with a mouse monoclonal anti-GD3 antibody (R24). Brains and livers obtained from neonates at postnatal day 0, generated by intercrossing heterozygous mice (Phgdh+/-) were homogenized individually in 5 volumes of water and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 50 min at 4 °C. Proteins in the supernatant were removed according to a previously reported procedure (6Mitoma J. Furuya S. Hirabayashi Y. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 30: 195-199Google Scholar), and the amino acid composition of the supernatants was determined with a L-8500 amino acid analyzer (Hitachi). Histology—Timed matings between heterozygotes were performed and detection of vaginal plugs in the morning was defined as d.p.c. 0.5. Embryos were culled and dissected at d.p.c. 13.5, fixed overnight in Bouin's fixative, embedded in paraffin wax, then sectioned. Sections (2 μm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. For immunohistochemistry, sections were de-paraffinized and primary antibodies against Phgdh (rabbit), glutamate transporter GLAST (guinea pig), class III β-tubulin (TuJ1, mouse monoclonal, Babco), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (PC10, mouse monoclonal, Chemicon) were used. Immunoreactivity was visualized with the appropriate species-specific antibodies conjugated to either Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 568 (Molecular Probes). In the case of PCNA detection, goat anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibodies conjugated to peroxidase was used. Targeted Disruption of Murine Phgdh Gene Results in Embryonic Lethality—To facilitate inactivation of the murine Phgdh gene, we constructed a targeting vector in which exons 4 and 5 were flanked by two loxP sites (Fig. 1A). This strategy allowed us to inactivate the Phgdh gene completely because the Cre recombinase-mediated deletion of exons 4 and 5 produces a frameshift mutation. The resulting truncated Phgdh protein contains only the 118 N-terminal amino acids encoded by exons 1–3 and lacks both the NAD+ binding and substrate binding domains (17Achouri Y. Rider M.H. Schaftingen E.V. Robbi M. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 365-370Google Scholar). We introduced the targeting vector into E14 ES cells and identified two positive clones that contained the correctly integrated targeted allele (Phgdhneo) (data not shown). Chimeric mice harboring the targeted ES cell clone R31 successfully transmitted the targeted allele to the germ line (Fig. 1B). Mice with the heterozygous mutant Phgdh allele (Phgdh+/-) were obtained by crossing mice heterozygous for the targeted allele (Phgdh+/neo) with EIIa Cre deleter mice, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The heterozygous mutant mice (Phgdh+/-) appeared to be viable and fertile without obvious developmental abnormalities. Crosses between Phgdh+/- mice failed to produce viable Phgdh-/- mice (Fig. 1C). The absence of any Phgdh-/- pups demonstrates that homozygous Phgdh-/- deficiency results in an embryonic lethal phenotype. To determine at which developmental stage during gestation lethality appeared in Phgdh-/- embryos, timed pregnancies of Phgdh+/- matings were examined at d.p.c. 9.5 and 13.5. Genotyping of embryos produced the expected Mendelian heritance (24.2% wild type, 50% heterozygotes, 25.8% homozygotes) (Fig. 1C). However, the onset of degeneration and the remains of resorbed embryos were frequently seen after d.p.c. 13.5, indicating that the homozygous Phgdh-/- embryos died after d.p.c. 13.5. Phgdh Expression in Mutant Embryos—Western blot analysis of cytosolic proteins prepared from whole head extracts of d.p.c. 13.5 embryos demonstrated, as expected, that a single immunoreactive 57-kDa band was absent in the Phgdh-/- embryos, demonstrating that these mutant mice were Phgdh null. (Fig. 2A). Phgdh protein levels in heterozygous mice (Phgdh+/-) decreased by ∼50%. The levels of GAPDH, a cytosolic enzyme involved in glycolysis, remained unaffected in all three genotypes. To examine the consequences of the absence of Phgdh protein in vivo, we performed two sets of experiments. In the first experiment, we analyzed PS and sphingolipids, both of which are actively synthesized in developing neural cells from the required precursor free l-serine (10Mitoma J. Kasama T. Furuya S. Hirabayashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19363-19366Google Scholar). Lipids were extracted from whole heads of d.p.c. 13.5 embryos and subjected to TLC analysis. Among the various sphingolipid species, we examined GD3 ganglioside because it is reported to be the major lipid found in the rodent brain during development (18Hirschberg K. Zisling R. van Echten-Deckert G. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14876-14882Google Scholar). As expected, greatly reduced levels of PS and GD3 ganglioside were observed in Phgdh-/- embryos compared with those in Phgdh+/+ embryos (Fig. 2B). PE, which can be synthesized from PS in the developing brain (19White F.V. Toews A.D. Morell P. J. Neurochem. 1986; 46: 1200-1206Google Scholar), also decreased significantly in the Phgdh-/- embryos. These data indicate that mice with the homozygous Phgdh-/- allele have reduced capacity to synthesize l-serine. We then measured levels of free l-serine in brain and liver of wild type and heterozygote (Phgdh+/-) neonates at postnatal day 0. As shown in Fig. 2C, brains of the heterozygotes had a significantly decreased level of free l-serine (0.46 nmol/mg of tissue) compared with the brains of the wild-type neonates (0.59 nmol/mg of tissue). In contrast, there were no changes in free l-serine levels in the livers of either genotype (1.07 nmol/mg of tissue for Phgdh+/-, 1.08 nmole/mg tissue for Phgdh+/+). These analyses demonstrate that the Phgdh-dependent pathway plays a chief role in l-serine biosynthesis, at least during brain development. Phenotypes of Phgdh-/-Embryos—The effects of abolishing Phgdh expression were evident at d.p.c. 9.5. Phgdh null embryos were markedly smaller than their Phgdh+/+ and Phgdh+/- littermates (Fig. 3, A and B). Despite their reduced size, the null embryos appeared to have differentiating organs, such as brain and somites, and had completed axial rotation by d.p.c. 9.5, suggesting that the Phgdh null mutation does not affect the establishment of the basic body plan during early embryogenesis. At d.p.c. 13.5, the Phgdh null embryos were, in comparison with wild-type littermates, poorly developed, having smaller bodies with apparent brain and limb bud abnormalities. Unlike wild-type littermates, programmed cell death in the interdigital regions of limb buds of the null embryos, which normally begins at d.p.c. 12 (20Chen Y. Zhao X. J. Exp. Zool. 1998; 282: 691-702Google Scholar), appeared to be suppressed (or delayed), and consequently the separation of digits was not obvious at this stage (data not shown). Besides null embryos having smaller brains, they also could be classified into two major types, according to the kind of brain abnormality present. Type I embryos exhibited mild exencephalic phenotypes and had dorsal closure failure (Fig. 3, C and E); Type II embryos had no sign of exencephaly but had swollen lateral ventricles and hypoplasia of the telencephalon, diencephalon, and mesencephalon, most prominently accompanied by the absence of the olfactory bulb, ganglionic eminence, and cerebellum (Fig. 3, D and F). Type I embryos also lacked these structures in the brain. The ratio of Type I to Type II embryos was approximately equal at d.p.c. 13.5. Immunohistochemical examinations of whole embryos also showed that Phgdh expression was completely eliminated in the brains of Phgdh null embryos at d.p.c. 13.5 (Fig. 4, A–C). Immunostaining for the glutamate transporter GLAST, a neuroepithelial stem cell/radial glia-specific marker (21Shibata T. Yamada K. Watanabe M. Ikenaka K. Wada K. Tanaka K. Inoue Y. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9212-9219Google Scholar), demonstrated that these cells localized to the ventricular zone (VZ) of various brain regions of the Phgdh null embryos, as in the wild-type littermates, but the overall size and thickness of the VZ in the Phgdh null embryos were significantly reduced at this stage (data not shown). There were also fewer newly generated post-mitotic neurons immunoreactive for class III β-tubulin (22Menezes J.R. Luskin M.B. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5399-5416Google Scholar) in various regions of their brains (data not shown). In the cerebral cortex, double immunofluorescent labeling for GLAST and class III β-tubulin clearly demonstrated reductions in the mass of both neuroepithelial stem cell/radial glial and neuronal populations located in the VZ and primordial plexiform layer (PPL), respectively (Fig. 4, D and E). We then examined mitotically active cells in the VZ by immunolabeling for PCNA, an essential component of the eukaryotic chromosomal DNA replisome expressed in proliferating cells of the developing brain and other tissues (23Nakamura Y. Sakakibara S. Miyata T. Ogawa M. Shimazaki T. Weiss S. Kageyama R. Okano H. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 283-293Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, F–J, there were greatly reduced numbers of PCNA-positive cells in the VZ of the null embryos. The present study demonstrates for the first time that complete loss of Phgdh leads to embryonic lethality accompanied by overall developmental retardation and striking defects of the brain. Although there are other potential sources of l-serine (i.e. the non-phosphorylated pathway, the condensation of glycine and N5,N10-methylenetetrahydrofolate by means of serine hydroxymethyltransferase, protein degradation, and maternal supply via blood circulation), our data definitely establish that the Phgdh-dependent phosphorylated pathway of l-serine bio-synthesis is essential for embryonic development. In Phgdh null embryos, morphogenesis of the brain is probably the most critically disrupted developmental process. The results of our histological examinations strongly suggest that diminished brain size in Phgdh null embryos is due to a decrease in proliferation of neuroepithelial stem cells/radial glia in the VZ (Fig. 4). Importantly, null embryos had greatly reduced levels of PS and sphingolipids (Fig. 2B). These lipids are essential for cellular proliferation (24Nishijima M. Kuge O. Hanada K. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 324-329Google Scholar). The metabolic role of l-serine as a major source of one-carbon units for de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides and the pyrimidine nucleotide deoxythymidine monophosphate also supports this possibility (25Snell K. Natsumeda Y. Weber G. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 609-612Google Scholar). Finally, the microcephaly evident in the Phgdh null embryos (Figs. 3 and 4) has also been reported to be a major symptom of patients with human Phgdh deficiency (11de Koning T.J. Snell K. Duran M. Berger R. Poll-The B.T. Surtees R. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 653-661Google Scholar). Thus, our mutant mice may serve as a useful animal model for studying how diminished l-serine levels impair development and function of the central nervous system. It will also be intriguing to examine to what extent l-serine is necessary for brain morphogenesis during development and for the maturation of neuronal circuits using brain-specific knockouts of the Phgdh gene.

The global transcriptional regulator FNR (fumarate-nitrate reduction) monitors the availability of oxygen in the environment. Binding as a homodimer to palindromic sequences of DNA, FNR carries a sensory domain, remote from the DNA binding helix-turn-helix motif, which responds to oxygen. The sensing mechanism involves the transformation of a [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster into a [2Fe-2S] form in vitro on reaction with oxygen. Evidence is presented to show that this process proceeds by at least two steps, the first, an oxidative one, being the formation, on reaction with O2, of a [3Fe-4S]1+ cluster as an intermediate accompanied by the production of hydrogen peroxide. This is followed by a slower, non-redox, pseudo-first order step in which the [3Fe-4S]1+ form converts to a [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster. This must be accompanied by a substantial protein conformational change since the four cysteine ligands that bind the two forms of the FeS clusters have different spatial disposition. Hydrogen peroxide is also an oxidant of the [4Fe-4S]2+, causing a similar cluster transformation to a [2Fe-2S] form.

Escherichia coli is a facultative anaerobe that adopts different metabolic modes in response to the availability of oxygen (1Guest J.R. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1995; 350: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A hierarchy of metabolism exists in which aerobic respiration is preferred to anaerobic respiration, which in turn is preferred to fermentation (1Guest J.R. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1995; 350: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In simple terms, the global transcriptional regulator FNR 1The abbreviations used are: FNR, fumarate-nitrate reduction regulator; CAP, catabolite gene activator protein; HRP, horseradish peroxidase.1The abbreviations used are: FNR, fumarate-nitrate reduction regulator; CAP, catabolite gene activator protein; HRP, horseradish peroxidase. (designated due to defects in fumarate-nitrate reduction of the corresponding mutants), along with other transcription factors, ArcBA, NarXL, NarPQ, and FhlA, maintains this hierarchy by monitoring the availability of oxygen in the environment (1Guest J.R. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1995; 350: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). FNR is a member of a large family of transcription factors that modulate physiological changes in response to a variety of metabolic and environmental challenges (2Green J. Scott C. Guest J.R. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2001; 44: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Members of the family are predicted to be structurally related to the catabolite gene activator protein, CAP (also known as the cAMP receptor protein). CAP and FNR proteins bind as homodimers to palindromic sequences of DNA, each monomer binding to one half-site (2Green J. Scott C. Guest J.R. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2001; 44: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). They consist of two functionally distinct domains, a DNA binding helix-turn-helix motif and an N-terminal region of antiparallel β-strands forming the sensory domain (3Schultz S.C. Shields G.C. Steitz T.A. Science. 1991; 253: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). The sensing regions are adapted to respond to different effectors (2Green J. Scott C. Guest J.R. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2001; 44: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus, CAP reversibly binds cAMP to monitor glucose status (4Busby S. Kolb A. Lin E.C.C. Lynch A.S. Regulation and Gene Expression in Escherichia coli. Landes, Austin, TX1996: 255-280Google Scholar), and the sensing domain of the CooA protein of Rhodospirillum rubrum possesses a b-type cytochrome that binds CO (5Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struc. Biol. 2000; 7: 867-880Google Scholar). The sensory region of FNR has four conserved cysteine residues (Cys-20, -23, -29, and -122) that are essential for in vivo activity and capable of ligating an oxygen-sensitive [4Fe-4S] iron-sulfur cluster (6Sharrocks A.

A variety of studies have revealed that the active form of FNR contains one [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster/protein monomer that is converted to a [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster, together with other, less well defined iron species, following exposure to oxygen both in vitro and in vivo (10Lazazzera B.A. Beinert H.

The switch from a cubane [4Fe-4S] cluster, bound to the protein by four cysteine thiol ligands that sit at the vertices of a tetrahedron, to a planar [2Fe-2S] cluster, also thought to possess four cysteine ligands but lying in a plane, suggests that cluster transformation on exposure to oxygen will provide a large conformational change in the N-terminal region of FNR, presumably thereby initiating the switch of the protein from a DNA binding state to one incapable of binding DNA (8Jordan P.A. Thomson A.J. Ralph E.T. Guest J.R. Green J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Initial attempts to characterize the process of cluster conversion revealed that FNR requires at least 2.5 molecules O2 per cluster for complete cluster conversion (8Jordan P.A. Thomson A.J. Ralph E.T. Guest J.R. Green J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Prolonged exposure to O2 can lead to complete loss of cluster and the formation of apo-FNR (17Green J. Trageser M. Six S. Unden G. Guest J.R. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1991; 244: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The overall reaction of FNR with O2 can be written as Reaction 1. The redox states of the individual Fe atoms in the cluster are indicated. [2Fe(III)2Fe(II)-4S]2++xO2→y[2Fe(III)-2S]2++otherproductsREACTION 1 Neither the product(s) of O2 reduction nor the overall stoichiometry of the reaction is known. The chemical state of iron and sulfur released is also unknown. An EPR signal characteristic of a [3Fe(III)-4S]1+ cluster (S = ½) has occasionally been observed in FNR samples following brief exposure to O2 but has never accounted for more than about 5% of the original [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster in the wild type protein (18Green J. Bennett B. Jordan P. Ralph E.T. Thomson A.J. Guest J.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 887-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Here we investigate the transformation of the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster of FNR into the [2Fe-2S] form in vitro by the effect of oxygen. Evidence is presented to show that the process proceeds by at least two steps, the first, the oxidative one, being the formation on reaction with O2 of a [3Fe-4S]1+ cluster as an intermediate accompanied by the production of hydrogen peroxide. This is followed by a slower, non-redox, pseudo-first order, step with the [3Fe-4S]1+ form converting to a [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster presumably accompanied by a substantial protein conformational switch.

Cells with pGS572 were suspended (∼30 ml liter-1 culture) in buffer (25 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaNO3, 10 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5) disrupted by sonication (on ice), and then cellular debris was removed by centrifugation.

Protein purification and handling was carried out under strictly anaerobic conditions in a Faircrest anaerobic cabinet, typically operating at <2.0 ppm O2 by volume, and all buffers were sparged with oxygen-free nitrogen gas for a minimum of 2 h. Bacterial extract (10 ml) was applied to buffer without protease inhibitor equilibrated GSH-agarose affinity columns (2 ml). Bovine thrombin (Sigma), incubated at ambient temperature (∼25 °C) for 16 h, released apo-FNR, which was collected and stored at 4 °C until required.

A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), and an appropriate amount of FeS(2), providing a 10 molar excess of Fe2+/FNR monomer. Samples were transferred to a Hewlett Packard 8453 spectrophotometer fitted with a thermostatic cell holder at 37 °C and stirred magnetically throughout the reconstitution. Spectra were recorded every 20 min, and after completion (∼4 h), samples were transferred back into the anaerobic cabinet. Reconstituted protein was purified on a PD10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with purification buffer. The concentration of FNR was determined assuming ∈420 nm of 13,300 m-1 cm-1/[4Fe-4S]2+ cluster (8Jordan P.A. Thomson A.J. Ralph E.T. Guest J.R. Green J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Spectroscopy and Oxidation of FNR—A Hitachi U3200 spectrophotometer, scanning at 120 nm min-1, or a Jasco J-810 spectrophotometer, scanning at 200 nm min-1, were used to measure absorbance or CD spectra of FNR samples in sealed anaerobic cuvettes (1 cm). Time dependence for a 1-ml sample of FNR, containing catalytic amounts of catalase (370 units ml-1), was determined after the sample was injected with an aliquot (4 μl) of a 15.4 mm H2O2 stock solution, equivalent to 30.7 μm O2, and the decrease in A420 was monitored continuously using a Hewlett Packard 8453 spectrophotometer fitted with a thermostatic cell holder set to 25 °C. The optical spectra of oxidized holo-FNR a 2-ml sample of FNR, containing catalase (176 units ml-1), was injected with 10 μl of a 30.7 mm H2O2 stock solution, giving a final concentration of 72.7 μm O2, and then incubated for 15 min at an ambient temperature prior to measurement. Spin intensities of paramagnetic samples were estimated by integration of EPR spectra using 1 mm Cu(II), 10 mm EDTA as the standard. An X-band Bruker EMX EPR spectrometer was equipped with a TE-102 microwave cavity and an ESR-900 helium flow cryostat (Oxford Instruments). The microwave frequency was monitored using a Marconi Instruments microwave counter, model 2330. Determination of Dissolved Oxygen—Oxygen concentrations were determined in all buffer solutions at 15, 20, and 25 °C by chemical analysis using the method of Winkler (22Vogel A.I. Jeffery G.H. Bassett J. Mendham J. Denney R.C. Vogel’s Textbook of Quantitative Chemical Analysis. 5th Ed. Longman Scientific & Technical, Harlow, UK1989: 395-396Google Scholar). At 15, 20, and 25 °C, aerobic buffer contained 245.8 (±7.5), 228.3 (±7.5), and 212.1 (±0.0) μm O2, whereas aerobic water contained 305.1 (±5.2), 276.4 (±5.2), and 253.6 (±5.2) μm O2, respectively. Anaerobic buffer contained no detectable dissolved O2. Standardization of Hydrogen Peroxide Solution—A stock solution of ∼20 mm H2O2 was prepared from a commercially available 30% (v/v) H2O2 solution, by dilution with purification buffer, and maintained on ice. Oxygen-free nitrogen gas was slowly bubbled through an aliquot (25 ml) of the stock solution, which was then treated with an aliquot (100 ml) of 1 m H2SO4. The addition of 10 ml of 10% (w/v) NaI in 1 m H2SO4 followed by five drops of a 3% (w/v) Mo7O24·4H2O catalyst solution liberated iodine, which was immediately titrated with a 0.1 m solution of Na2S2O3·5H2O, using 1% (w/v) starch solution as indicator (23Vogel A.I. Jeffery G.H. Bassett J. Mendham J. Denney R.C. Vogel’s Textbook of Quantitative Chemical Analysis. 5th Ed. Longman Scientific & Technical, Harlow, UK1989: 394-395Google Scholar). Stock solutions (21.6 ± 2.16 mm H2O2). were made freshly, calibrated, maintained at ≤4 °C, and used on the same day. Stoichiometry of Oxygen Reaction with FNR—The optical spectrum of FNR in the absence of O2 displays absorbance maxima at 320 and 405 nm, with values of ∈320 17,443 m-1 cm-1 and ∈405 13,559 m-1 cm-1, respectively, together with the broad shoulder at 420 nm, giving the sample a characteristic straw brown color (Fig. 1A). Trace amounts of catalase were added to the FNR sample. Molecular O2 was introduced by the addition of 145.5 μm H2O2. Catalase reacts with H2O2 at close to the diffusion-controlled limit with a rate constant of ∼1 × 107 s-1 (24Aebi H. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 105: 121-126Crossref Scopus (17759) Google Scholar). Therefore, added H2O2 is decomposed by catalase to O2 before H2O2 can react with the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster (see “Oxidation of FNR by Hydrogen Peroxide”). An [O2]:[4Fe-4S] ratio of 1.8 yielded absorbance maxima at 310 and 420 nm, with ∈310 16,855 m-1 cm-1 and ∈420 11,040 m-1 cm-1, respectively, together with a broad absorbance shoulder at 430 nm and an increased absorbance in the region 500–600 nm resulting in a solution with a red/brown color. A titration of FNR with O2 was carried out by sequential additions of aerobic purification buffer (229 μm dissolved O2 at 20.0 °C) into an anaerobic sample of protein. This caused a progressive decrease in the absorbance at 420 nm accompanied by an increase in absorbance in the region 500–700 nm (Fig. 1B). A plot of ΔA420 nm against the ratio [O2]:[4Fe-4S] revealed that the reaction was ∼64% complete at a ratio of 0.5, ∼79% complete at a ratio of 1.0, and ∼87% complete at a ratio of 2.0 (Fig. 2). Increasing the [O2]:[4Fe-4S] further caused minimal change in the A420 obtained at an [O2]:[4Fe-4S] > 2.5. The product of the reaction was stable for several hours at room temperature provided no further O2 was introduced. Using values of ∈420 of 11,040 m-1 cm-1 for the oxidized form (see above), 28.2 μm oxidized FNR was formed following the addition of 77.3 μm O2, indicating that 95% of the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster originally present has formed a [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster. Taking the initial slope and the asymptote at high oxygen levels, a binding stoichiometry of 0.58 ± 0.04 O2/[4Fe-4S] cluster is obtained. A complete binding curve cannot validly be fitted since the reaction turns out to be complex (see “Intermediates in the Oxidation of FNR by Oxygen”). However, the initial slope should be a reliable indicator of the stoichiometry at low oxygen levels. The reaction of O2 with FNR was also monitored using CD spectroscopy (Fig. 3A). Iron-sulfur clusters gain optical activity from the fold of a polypeptide chain. In the absence of O2, the FNR CD spectrum displayed weak bands in the region 280–800 nm with three positive features at λmax 330, 380, and 420 nm. The Δ∈ values were of the same order of magnitude as those of other proteins containing [4Fe-4S] cluster types (25Stephens P.J. Jensen G.M. Devlin F.J. Morgan T.V. Stout C.D. Martin A.E. Burgess B.K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3200-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 26Stephens P.J. Thomson A.J. Dunn J.B.R. Keiderling T.A. Rawlings J. Rao K.K. Hall D.O. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4770-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The CD of anaerobic FNR was gradually lost as the ratio of [O2]:[4Fe-4S] was increased and eventually replaced by a broader spectrum with two positive features at λmax 310 and 440 nm and a single negative feature at λmax 370 nm. When the [O2]:[4Fe-4S] ratio exceeds 1.1, only minimal further changes to the CD spectrum occurred. The Δ∈ values and forms of the CD spectra of [2Fe-2S] clusters vary widely. However, the FNR CD spectrum after exposure to O2 is reminiscent of the form of CD spectra obtained for Spirulina maxima 2Fe-ferredoxin and the Pseudomonas putida 2Fe-ferredoxin, putidaredoxin, especially the broad positive band at 440 nm. Although the Δ∈ values for the FNR [2Fe-2S] cluster are considerably lower than those of other proteins (26Stephens P.J. Thomson A.J. Dunn J.B.R. Keiderling T.A. Rawlings J. Rao K.K. Hall D.O. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4770-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), the CD spectrum after O2 treatment can be assigned to the [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster. A plot of the binding isotherm (not shown) showed that the reaction was ∼63% complete at a [O2]:[4Fe-4S] ratio of 0.5 and ∼84% complete at a ratio of 1.0, in agreement with the observations made by optical spectroscopy (see above). The CD spectra of FNR, the first to be reported, provide a useful means of monitoring the status of the FNR iron-sulfur cluster. Product of Oxygen Reduction by FNR—The maximum number of electrons available from complete oxidation of one [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster to two Fe(III) ions is two, suggesting that hydrogen peroxide may be a product. To test this, an anaerobic sample of FNR was titrated with O2 in the presence of Amplex Red (27Zhou M. Diwu Z. Panchuk-Voloshina N. Haugland R.P. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 253: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Peroxide reacts with Amplex Red and HRP to generate the highly fluorescent dye Resorufin (27Zhou M. Diwu Z. Panchuk-Voloshina N. Haugland R.P. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 253: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). The addition of aliquots of O2 caused a progressive increase in fluorescence intensity at 587 nm (Fig. 4A). Control samples of Amplex Red and HRP in the presence of FNR and the absence of O2 did not show any change in fluorescence intensity at 587 nm. A plot of H2O2 formed as a function of the ratio [O2]:[4Fe-4S] (Fig. 4B) reveals that the reaction was ∼65% complete at a ratio of 0.5, ∼78% complete at a ratio of 1.0, and ∼85% at a ratio of 2.0. Increasing [O2]:[4Fe-4S] beyond 2.0 gave no further increase in the fluorescence intensity at 587 nm. These observations are in good agreement with those from optical and CD spectroscopy and clearly demonstrate that H2O2 is a major product when FNR is exposed to O2. A maximum value of 13.1 μmol of H2O2 was formed from 29.2 μmol of a [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster at an [O2]:[4Fe-4S] ratio of 2.0. Thus, ∼45% of the total amount of [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters originally present in the FNR sample-generated H2O2. Oxidation of FNR by Hydrogen Peroxide—Since H2O2 is a strong oxidant, it was important to determine whether H2O2 itself would react with the [4Fe-4S] cluster of FNR. Anaerobic H2O2 was titrated into a sample of anaerobic FNR (Fig. 5A). The optical spectra showed absorbance decreases at 420 nm accompanied by increases in absorbance in the region 460–680 nm and isosbestic points at 450 and 680 nm. A plot of ΔA420, against the ratio of H2O2:[4Fe-4S], saturates at a ratio of >2.5. A reaction stoichiometry of 1.59 ± 0.03 H2O2/[4Fe-4S] is obtained from the asymptotes (Fig. 5B). The reaction with H2O2 has also been followed by CD spectroscopy (Fig. 3B). Increasing the ratio [H2O2]:[4Fe-4S] caused the progressive loss of CD features at λmax 330, 380, and 420 nm, characteristic of the [4Fe-4S] cluster and the generation of a new CD spectrum that becomes stable at a ratio of [H2O2]:[4Fe-4S] > 3.0. This spectrum is not identical to that obtained from the reaction of FNR with O2 but still shows a broad CD band at 440 nm, characteristic of the FNR [2Fe-2S] cluster. Intermediates in the Oxidation of FNR by Oxygen—The time course of the reaction of FNR with O2 (generated by the reaction of catalase with H2O2) was monitored at 420 nm, revealing a 50% decrease in 1 min, 82% decrease after 5 min, and 98% decrease after 10 min (Fig. 6). A semilog plot of the data (not shown) was linear, showing first order kinetics with a rate constant of 5.57 ± 0.09 × 10-3 s-1, giving a half-life of ∼2 min. A rate that is first order in FNR, at equivalent concentrations of FNR and O2, suggests a rate-determining step that does not involve oxygen. Previous EPR studies have shown the presence of only small quantities, <5%, of a [3Fe-4S]1+ cluster during the reaction of FNR with O2 (12Khoroshilova N. Popescu C. Munck E. Beinert H. Kiley P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6087-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). However, the [3Fe-4S]1+ cluster may be an intermediate in the [4Fe-4S]2+ to [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster conversion (18Green J. Bennett B. Jordan P. Ralph E.T. Thomson A.J. Guest J.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 887-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 28Khoroshilova N. Beinert H. Kiley P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2499-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). During the course of an O2 titration, samples of FNR were taken within ∼1 min after O2 addition, placed in an EPR tube, and frozen rapidly to 77 K. The EPR spectra of these samples, measured at 10 K, display a signal centered at g ≈ 2.014, characteristic of a [3Fe-4S]1+ cluster, which decreased rapidly in intensity on increasing the temperature until it was lost at ∼30 K (Fig. 7A). Integration of the signal showed an initial EPR signal intensity, which declined steeply during the course of the titration (Fig. 7B). After the addition of a stoichiometric amount of O2, no [3Fe-4S]1+ cluster was detected by EPR. The maximum intensity accounted for 22.8 μmol of an electron spin, corresponding to 50% of the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster originally present in the FNR sample, showing that the [3Fe-4S]1+ cluster is formed in significant quantities over the course of an O2 titration but is absent when the reaction is driven to completion. This supports the idea that it is an intermediate in the [4Fe-4S]2+ to [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster conversion.Fig. 7EPR spectra of FNR as a function of oxygen concentration. As shown in A, after each addition of air-saturated buffer (232.1 μm O2 at 19 °C) to FNR (45.7 μm [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster), an aliquot was withdrawn and immediately frozen in an EPR tube. The dashed line indicates g = 2.014. Ratios of O2:[4Fe-4S] were (i) 0, (ii) 0.25, (iii) 0.75, (iv) 0.99, (v) 1.50, (vi) 2.00, (vii) 2.50. EPR spectra were recorded at 10 K, with a microwave power of 2.0 milliwatts, a modulation amplitude 9.43 milliteslas, and a microwave frequency of 9.67 GHz, and normalized to the same receiver gain.

Molecular O2 brings about conversion of the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster of FNR to the [2Fe-2S]2+ form, thereby triggering a conformational change in the protein that prevents sequence-specific DNA binding and interaction with the transcriptional machinery (reviewed in Ref. 2Green J. Scott C. Guest J.R. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2001; 44: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The interconversion between a [4Fe-4S]2+ and [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster upon exposure to O2 has been observed in proteins that generate a radical species by reductive cleavage of S-adenosyl methionine such as biotin and lipoate synthase (29Ollagnier-de Choudens S. Sanakis Y. Hewitsen S. Roach P. Baldwin J. Münck E. Fontecave M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4165-4173Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This appears to be a very large family with over 600 members (30Sofia H.J. Chen G. Hetzler B.G. Reyes-Spindola J.F. Miller N.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). However, the reactions between [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters and O2 have not previously been studied quantitatively. Here we have shown that upon exposure to O2, the FNR [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster is converted to the [2Fe-2S]2+ form via a [3Fe-4S]1+ intermediate with the concomitant production of H2O2. H2O2 can also oxidize the FNR [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster, probably to the [2Fe-2S]2+ form. Reaction of FNR with Oxygen—The spectrophotometric titrations reveal a progressive conversion of the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster to a [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster in which FNR displayed higher sensitivity at low ratios of O2:[4Fe-4S]. After exposure to a 3-fold molar excess of O2, >95% of the [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters originally present were converted to an anaerobically stable [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster. Thus, the conversion of the [4Fe-4S] to the [2Fe-2S] form of FNR does not result in an autocatalytic, runaway process. The stoichiometry indicates that ∼0.5 O2 molecule interacts with one [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster. We have demonstrated the generation of H2O2 following reaction of FNR with O2 with the amount of peroxide produced being dependent on the amount of O2 added. However, quantification of H2O2 yielded only ∼45% of that expected for oxidation of one [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster. This suggests either that the reaction with O2 produces products in addition to H2O2, or more likely, that the H2O2 generated can oxidize unreacted [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters. Evidence to support this latter possibility has been obtained. This could account for the observation that more than one iron-sulfur cluster can be disassembled by one O2 (see below). If the overall oxidation process of the FNR by O2 is written as Reaction 2, then the stoichiometry of oxygen to [4Fe-4S] is not as determined.

Although the oncogenic form of ECT2 contains an N-terminal truncation, it is not clear how the structural abnormality of ECT2 causes malignant transformation. Here we show that both the removal of the negative regulatory domain and alteration of subcellular localization are required to induce the oncogenic activity of ECT2. The transforming activity of oncogenic ECT2 was strongly inhibited by dominant negative Rho GTPases, suggesting the involvement of Rho GTPases in ECT2 transformation. Although deletion of the N-terminal cell cycle regulator-related domain (N) of ECT2 did not activate its transforming activity, removal of the small central domain (S), which contains two nuclear localization signals (NLSs), significantly induced the activity. The ECT2 N domain interacted with the catalytic domain and significantly inhibited the focus formation by oncogenic ECT2. Interestingly, the introduction of the NLS mutations in the S domain of N-terminally truncated ECT2 dramatically induced the transforming activity of this otherwise non-oncogenic derivative. Among the known Rho GTPases expressed in NIH 3T3 cells, RhoA was predominantly activated by oncogenic ECT2 in vivo.

Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5218) Google Scholar). Activation of the Rho proteins is promoted by guanine nucleotide exchange factors, which catalyze the replacement of bound GDP by GTP. The GTP-bound form of Rho proteins can specifically interact with their effectors or targets and transmit signals to downstream molecules. Rho proteins are inactivated through the hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP by the intrinsic GTPase activity assisted by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 induce the formation of actin stress fibers, lamellipodia, and filopodia, respectively (9Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). Among the known guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Rho GTPases, ECT2 shows several unique characteristics. ECT2 expression is induced in S phase and reaches the highest level in G2 and M phases in regenerating mouse liver (10Sakata H. Rubin J.S. Taylor W.G. Miki T. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). ECT2 protein is specifically phosphorylated in G2 and M phases (2Tatsumoto T. Xie X. Blumenthal R. Okamoto I. Miki T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). ECT2 exhibits nuclear localization in interphase, disperses throughout the cytoplasm in prometaphase, and is condensed in the midbody during cytokinesis. Expression of a dominant negative ECT2 or microinjection of anti-ECT2 antibody strongly inhibits cytokinesis, indicating that ECT2 is a critical regulator of cytokinesis (2Tatsumoto T. Xie X. Blumenthal R. Okamoto I. Miki T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Drosophila pbl gene, whose mutation results in the inhibition of cytokinesis in mitotic cycle 14 during embryogenesis, was found to encode the fly homologue of human ECT2 (11Prokopenko S.N. Brumby A. O'Keefe L. Prior L. He Y. Saint R. Bellen H.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2301-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Although the transforming activity of several DBL family oncogenes is stimulated by N-terminal alterations (12Horii Y. Beeler J.F. Sakaguchi K. Tachibana M. Miki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4776-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 13Chan A.M. McGovern E.S. Catalano G. Fleming T.P. Miki T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1057-1063PubMed Google Scholar, 14Chan A.M.

Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), the activation mechanisms are still obscure. Because Rho GTPases play a critical role in cell transformation (16Prendergast G.C. Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Kurzawa H. Lebowitz P.F. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2289-2296PubMed Google Scholar, 17Qiu R.G. Chen J. McCormick F. Symons M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar), ECT2 may display its transforming activity through the activation of Rho proteins. However, ECT2 is predominantly expressed in the nucleus where no expression of Rho GTPases is reported. In the present study, we examined the activation mechanism of the transforming activity of ECT2. We identified the small central domain containing two tandem nuclear localization signals as a negative regulator of the transforming activity. We show that elimination of these signals and a negative regulatory domain from ECT2 resulted in the activation of Rho GTPases in the cytoplasm, leading to malignant transformation of the cells. DNA Constructs—Full-length and N-terminally truncated ECT2 cDNAs were amplified by PCR using ECT2 clone 1M (2Tatsumoto T. Xie X. Blumenthal R. Okamoto I. Miki T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 3Saito S. Tatsumoto T. Lorenzi M.V. Chedid M. Kapoor V. Sakata H. Rubin J. Miki T. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 90: 819-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) as template and subcloned between the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the mammalian expression vector pCEV29 or its derivative pCEV29F3, which contains three tandem copies of FLAG sequence (19Lorenzi M.V. Castagnino P. Chen Q. Hori Y. Miki T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4742-4755Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). ECT2 N-terminal derivatives, ECT2-N1 (amino acids 1-421), ECT2-N2 (amino acids 1-378), ECT2-N3 (amino acids 1-360), and ECT2-N4 (amino acids 1-333) have been described previously (3Saito S. Tatsumoto T. Lorenzi M.V. Chedid M. Kapoor V. Sakata H. Rubin J. Miki T. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 90: 819-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). ECT2-ΔS mutant lacking the S domain (amino acids 329-420) was created from two PCR products using the same template and primers I-IV with the following sequences: I, 5′-CTC GGA TCC ATG GCT GAA AAT AGT GTA TTA-3′; II, 5′-CAG ACT CGC GGA GTA TTT GCC TTT TCA TA-3′; III, 5′-TCA CTC CGC GGT GGC AAG TTG CAA AAG AG-3′; and IV, 5′-ACT GAA TTC GGT AAC GCT TCA TAT CAA ATG-3′. The PCR products synthesized using primer pairs I and II were digested with BamHI and BstUI. The PCR products generated by primers III and IV were digested with BstUI and EcoRI. These products were ligated together with the pCEV29 or pCEV29F3 vector, which had been digested with BamHI and EcoRI, to create ECT2-ΔS. Two ECT2 mutants, S1 and S2, containing RRR to AAA and R to A mutations in the NLS sequence of the S domain, respectively, were generated by the similar procedure, but following oligonucleotides were used for PCR to introduce mutations: V, 5′-CAG ACT GCG GCC GCT TTG CGA TTG CTG TTA GGG GT-3′; VI, 5′-TCA CTC GCG GCC GCT TTA AAA GAA ACA CTT GCT CAG-3′; VII, 5′-TTT GGC GCG CCC GGG GTG GAA ATG GTG ACA C-3′; and VIII, 5′-TTT GGC GCG CCC ATC AGC TGA GCA TTC CCT T-3′. NotI and AscI were used to create S1 and S2, respectively, instead of BstUI. S3 was created by the similar procedure, but S1 was used as a PCR template instead of ECT2-F. ECT2-F, S1, S2, S3, ΔS, and ΔN5 were also cloned into pEGFP-C1 (BD Biosciences/Clontech) to express ECT2 as green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins. All constructs generated by the use of PCR were sequenced to ensure that no PCR mutation was generated except the desired mutations. An ECT2-ΔN5 derivative containing PVQR to AAAA mutations (amino acids 564-567) in the DH domain was generated by amplifying two PCR fragments. Primers for the first fragment were as follows: a forward primer with a BamHI restriction site, 5′-CCC GGA TCC GCC ACC ATG GTT CCT TCA AAG CAG TCA GCA-3′, and a reverse primer with SfiI site, 5′-CAG ACT GGC CGC TGC GGC CCG GAT AAG AAG TTC AAC AAG-3′. Primers for the second fragment were: a forward primer with a SfiI site, 5′-TCA CTC GGC CGC AGC GGC CTT ACC CAG TGT TGC ATT ACT-3′, and a reverse primer with an EcoRI site, 5′-ACT GAA TTC GGT AAC GCT TCA TAT CAA ATG-3′. PCR products were then digested with the indicated restriction enzymes and simultaneously ligated with the pCEV29F3 vector digested with BamHI and EcoRI. A new SfiI site was generated as a result of the introduction of PVQR to AAAA mutations. To introduce the SV40 NLS (nuc) into ECT2-ΔN5, ECT2-ΔN5 fragment was subcloned into BamHI site of pECFP-Nuc vector (BD Biosciences/Clontech), and then a DNA fragment containing the triple repeats of SV40 large T antigen NLS sequence (GAT CCA AAA AAG AAG AGA AAG GTA GAT CCA AAA AAG AAG AGA AAG GTA GAT CCA AAA AAG AAG AGA AAG GTA) and ECT2-ΔN5 sequence was excised and then cloned in pEGFP-C1 and pCEV29F3 vectors. Expression of fusion proteins of expected sizes were confirmed by Western blotting. ECT2 NLS sequence (amino acids 336-378) was attached to the 3′ end of EGFP sequence (BD Biosciences/Clontech) by PCR and subcloned between BamHI and EcoRI sites of the mammalian EGFP expression vector pCAGGFP (20Isaacs J.S. Saito S. Neckers L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18497-18506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) to create an EGFP-EGFP-ECT2 NLS fusion protein. The expression of 60-kDa ECT2 NLS-tagged tandem GFP protein was confirmed by Western blotting in U-2 OS cells. Focus Forming Assays—NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with various amounts (0.01-1.0 μg) of the eukaryotic expression vector pCEV29 or pCEV29F3 (19Lorenzi M.V. Castagnino P. Chen Q. Hori Y. Miki T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4742-4755Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) containing ECT2 cDNAs or vector alone by the calcium phosphate transfection method. Focus formation was observed in unselected plates ∼14 days after transfection and quantified after Giemsa staining. FLAG-tagged ECT2 variants (in pCEV29F3) showed slightly lower transforming activity than non-tagged versions (in pCEV29). Transforming activity was expressed as the number of foci per picomoles of DNA (ffu/pmol). Comparative efficiency of transfection was confirmed by G-418-resistant colony formation in duplicated plates. Expression levels of the ECT2 variants were examined using anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and anti-GFP (BD Biosciences/Clontech) 48 h after transfection with 10:1 mixture of FLAG-tagged ECT2 expression vector and pEGFP-C1. Transient Expression Reporter Gene Assays—The construction of SRF-, and AP-1-luciferase reporter plasmids in pGL2Luc containing a minimal c-fos promoter (-56 to +109) has been described previously (21Tolkacheva T. Feuer B. Lorenzi M.V. Saez R. Chan A.M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The SRF binding sequence is derived from the serum response element of the c-fos gene and corresponds to SRE.mutL (22Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). Firefly luciferase reporter and TK-Renilla luciferase control plasmids were cotransfected with each expression vector into COS cells. Total amount of DNA was adjusted by the addition of vector DNA. 36-48 h post-transfection, cells were lysed and luciferase activities were measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, WI) according to the accompanied protocol. Firefly luciferase activity in the lysates was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity and expressed as a relative luciferase activity. No significant increase in luciferase activity was observed following transfection of each expression vector DNA with a reporter plasmid containing only a luciferase cassette and c-fos minimal promoter. In Vitro Invasion Assays—Invasion assays were performed using Biocoat Matrigel invasion chambers (BD Biosciences/Clontech) essentially as described in the manufacturer's protocol. Matrigel invasion chambers (24-well) were rehydrated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at room temperature. NIH 3T3 cells transfected with ECT2 or control vectors were seeded at 5 × 105/0.4 ml of medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin into the inner well of invasion chambers. The outer chambers were filled with 0.4 ml of medium containing 10% calf serum. Cells were allowed to invade Matrigel matrices for 10-12 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. To count cells that migrated onto the membrane at lower surface, the cells on the upper side of the membrane were scraped off with cotton swipe, then the inserts with membrane were stained with Diff-Quick (Dade Diagnostics). Cells on the lower side of membrane were photographed and counted. Activation Assays for Rho GTPases—COS cells were transfected by GFP or GFP-ECT2-ΔN5 expression vectors together with pEF4/Myc-His (Invitrogen, CA) carrying inserts for AU5-tagged Rho GTPases. Lysates were prepared 24 h after transfection, and the GTP-bound forms of Rho GTPases were determined by pull-down assays using GST-Rhotekin (for RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC) or GST-PAK PBD according to the manufacturer's protocol (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO). Subcellular Localization and Cell Morphology—NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with the GFP- or FLAG-tagged ECT2 expression vectors using the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). GFP-expressing cells were identified by green fluorescence. Actin and DNA were stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma) and 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma), respectively, as reported previously (2Tatsumoto T. Xie X. Blumenthal R. Okamoto I. Miki T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 19Lorenzi M.V. Castagnino P. Chen Q. Hori Y. Miki T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4742-4755Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged ECT2 derivatives (0.5 μg each) were transfected into NIH 3T3 cells using the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent. Cells were fixed with a freshly prepared mixture of methanol:acetone (1:1) for 2 min at room temperature 40 h after transfection. Expressed proteins were visualized using anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody-Cy3 conjugate (Sigma) in the presence of 1 μg/ml DAPI. U-2 OS cells were also transiently transfected with the expression vectors for GFP-tagged ECT2 mutants using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) to confirm their subcellular localization. In this case, Hoechst 33342 dye was added to culture medium at a final concentration of 10 μm, and cells were directly observed under the fluorescence microscope. Images were acquired using a Zeiss Axiovert microscope equipped with a Photometrics digital camera and processed with IPLab software (Signal Analytics). Time-lapse Video Microscopy—The RFP-ECT2-ΔN5 expression vector was constructed by inserting ECT2-ΔN5 into pRsRed2-C1 (BO Biosciences/Clontech) at the BglII and EcoRI sites. pEGFP-actin was obtained from Clontech. NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with the equal mixture of both the plasmids using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Cells were cultured on 35-mm plates in an environmental chamber on a stage of Zeiss Axiovert S-100 microscope equipped with motorized X-Y-Z stages. Images were taken at 3-min intervals by using a photometric digital camera controlled by OpenLab software (Improvision, Lexington, MA). Deletion of the N-terminal Half of Human ECT2 Induces Cell Transformation and Invasiveness—The mouse ect2 cDNA, ect2-T, which carries an N-terminal truncation, exhibits a high transforming activity, whereas the full-length clone does not significantly induce transformation (23Miki T. Smith C. Long J. Eva A. Fleming T. Nature. 1993; 362: 462-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). To test if N-terminal truncation can also activate the transforming activity of human ECT2, we generated a FLAG epitope-tagged full-length human ECT2 and its derivative ECT2-ΔN5, which has a similar N-terminal deletion to mouse ect2-T. Like ect2-T, ECT2-ΔN5 exhibited a high transforming activity in NIH 3T3 cells, whereas the full-length ECT2, ECT2-F, did not show any detectable activity (Fig. 1A). Both mouse and human ECT2 similarly induced tiny foci of transforming cells with stellate morphology, which was distinct from ras- or sis-induced foci (Fig. 1, A and B). We previously reported that ect2-T stimulates anchorage-independent growth of NIH 3T3 cells and tumorigenicity in nude mice (23Miki T. Smith C. Long J. Eva A. Fleming T. Nature. 1993; 362: 462-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). To examine additional oncogenic activities of ECT2, we established NIH 3T3 clones expressing FLAG-tagged derivatives of ECT2-F, ECT2-ΔN5, and ECT2-N2. ECT2-N2 carries the region from the N terminus to the S domain (see Fig. 6A). Western blot analysis with anti-FLAG antibody showed that these stable transfectants expressed FLAG-tagged ECT2-F, ECT2-N2, and ECT2-ΔN5 at comparable levels (Fig. 1C). Upon plating, ECT2-ΔN5-expressing cells formed secondary foci with stellate morphology, whereas the morphology of ECT2-F and ECT2-N2 clones was indistinguishable from the vector alone transfectants (Fig. 1B). When cultured in the presence of 10% serum, all of the stable ECT2 clones exhibited similar growth properties (data not shown). However, in medium containing 1% serum, vector alone, ECT2-N2 and ECT2-F transfectants did not grow well and the number of viable cells gradually decreased (Fig. 2A). In contrast, ECT2-ΔN5 transfectants continued to grow for at least 48 h under these conditions, suggesting that these transfectants acquired low serum dependence.Fig. 2Characterization of NIH 3T3 cells transfected with ECT2 variants. A, growth of ECT2 transfectants in low serum conditions. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% serum, and viable cells were scored at the indicated time points. B, induction of cell invasiveness by ECT2. Stable NIH 3T3 transfectants expressing the indicated cDNA were used for Matrigel assays to estimate cell invasiveness in vitro. The cells that invaded the Matrigels were stained and photographed (left half). The number of cells passed through the Matrigel is summarized (right half). ect2-T is a mouse cDNA with an N-terminal deletion similar to human ECT2-ΔN5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test if ECT2 can induce cell invasiveness, NIH 3T3 cells expressing ECT2-F, ECT2-ΔN5, or vector alone were placed on the surface of an artificial basement membrane, Matrigel, and the number of the cells that had migrated through the membrane was counted. Interestingly, ECT2-ΔN5 transfectants exhibited a strong invasion activity, whereas ECT2-F or the vector alone transfectants did not show significant activity (Fig. 2B). Additionally, mouse ect2-T, which corresponds to human ECT2-ΔN5, also exhibited a high activity of cell invasiveness. These results indicate that oncogenic ECT2 is an efficient activator of cell invasiveness. Oncogenic ECT2 Activates Rho Signaling Pathways—Because Rho GTPases are known to regulate the JNK and p38 MAPK pathways (24Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar, 25Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar), we examined whether these pathways are activated in ECT2 transfectants. We first analyzed endogenous JNK activity in these ECT2 transfectants using an antibody specific to the activated form of c-Jun, which is phosphorylated at serine 63. In vector alone transfectants, a very low level of JNK activity was observed (Fig. 3A, top). The activity of JNK in these cells was increased by the stimulation with sorbitol, an activator of the JNK pathway. The activity of JNK was also elevated in cells expressing ECT2-ΔN5. In contrast, ECT2-F or ECT2-N2 expression did not significantly affect the JNK activity. The JNK activity was induced by sorbitol to a similar level in all the transfectants (data not shown), indicating that all of the transfectants maintained the ability to induce JNK activity. In contrast, we did not observe significant activation of p38 or Erk MAPKs by ECT2 and its derivatives (Fig. 3A, middle and bottom). These results indicate that ECT2-ΔN5 preferentially activates the JNK signaling pathway. Rho proteins can stimulate the transcriptional activity regulated by serum response factor (SRF) (22Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). To examine whether ECT2 can stimulate SRF-regulated transcription, a serum response element (SRE)-luciferase plasmid was used as a reporter. Upon coexpression of the reporter plasmid with either the full-length or truncated ECT2 expression vector, luciferase activity was estimated. As shown in Fig. 3B, upper panel, expression of ECT2-ΔN5 potently induced the transcriptional activity of the SRE reporter plasmid. In contrast, expression of ECT2-F exhibited the activity slightly higher than the vector alone control. The SRE-regulated transcriptional activity induced by ECT2-ΔN5 was efficiently inhibited by either of dominant negative RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42. Moreover, either of constitutively active RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42 efficiently enhanced SRE-mediated transcription in this system. These results suggest that ECT2-ΔN5 can stimulate SRE-mediated transcription through the activation of Rho GTPases. We previously showed that Ost, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for RhoA and Cdc42, activates the transcriptional activity regulated by activator protein-1 (AP-1) (19Lorenzi M.V. Castagnino P. Chen Q. Hori Y. Miki T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4742-4755Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To examine whether ECT2 can also stimulate AP-1-regulated transcriptional activity, an AP-1-binding site-luciferase plasmid was utilized as a reporter. As shown in Fig. 3B, lower panel, expression of ECT2-ΔN5 moderately elevated AP-1-regulated transcriptional activity, whereas ECT2-F or ECT2-N2 failed to stimulate the activity. Coexpression of dominant negative RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42 reduced the ECT2-ΔN5-mediated stimulation of AP-1-regulated transcription, albeit at lower levels as compared with their effects on SRE-regulated transcription. We also found that constitutively active RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42 efficiently stimulated AP-1-mediated transcription. Among these GTPases, Rac1 displayed the highest level of stimulation of AP-1-regulated transcriptional activity. All of these results indicate that ECT2 can regulate the transcriptional events mediated by SRE and AP-1 through the activation of Rho GTPases. Oncogenic ECT2 Induces Cell Rounding in NIH 3T3 Fibroblasts—Rho family proteins are involved in the organization of actin-based cytoskeletal structures. In fibroblasts, RhoA activates actin stress fiber formation, whereas Rac1 and Cdc42 induce lamellipodia and filopodia formation, respectively (8Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5218) Google Scholar). To test which actin-based structures ECT2 can induce, we transiently expressed GFP-tagged ECT2-F, ECT2-ΔN5, or GFP vector alone in NIH 3T3 cells. A population (∼20%) of cells expressing GFP-ECT2-ΔN5 showed a flat phenotype with moderately enhanced actin stress fiber formation (Fig. 4A, GFPECT2-ΔN5, left panels), suggesting that Rho was preferentially activated by ECT2-ΔN5 in these cells. However, the majority of NIH 3T3 cells expressing GFP-ECT2-ΔN5 exhibited a compacted structure with saturated F-actin staining"
https://openalex.org/W1998571133,"The receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL), a recently identified member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily, has been shown to induce osteoclastogenesis and dendritic cell survival. Most members of the TNF superfamily suppress cell proliferation and induce apoptosis, but whether RANKL does so is not known. We demonstrate that treatment of monocyte RAW 264.7 cells with RANKL induces dose-dependent growth inhibition (IC50 = 10 ng/ml) as determined by dye uptake and [3H]thymidine incorporation methods. Suppression of RANKL-induced NF-κB activation by dominant-negative IκBα or by the NEMO-peptide had no effect on RANKL-induced cell growth inhibition. Inhibition of RANKL-induced JNK activation, however, abolished the RANKL-induced apoptosis. Suppression of interaction of RANK with TRAF6 by TRAF6-binding peptide abrogated the anti-proliferative effects of RANKL, suggesting the critical role of TRAF6. Flow cytometric analysis of cells treated with RANKL showed accumulation of cells in G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, and this accumulation correlated with a decline in the levels of cyclin D1, cyclin D3, and cyclin E and an increase in cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 (Kip). Flow cytometric analysis showed the presence of annexin V-positive cells in cultures treated with RANKL. RANKL-induced apoptosis was further confirmed using calcein AM/ethidium homodimer-1 dye and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), procaspase 3, and procaspase 9; benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD, the pancaspase inhibitor, suppressed the PARP cleavage. Thus, overall, our studies indicate that RANKL can inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis through a TRAF-6-dependent but NF-κB-independent mechanism.

Whether RANKL can also inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis, as other TNF family members do, is not known. To test this hypothesis, we treated macrophage RAW 264.7 cells with RANKL. In the present report, we provide evidence that RANKL can suppress the proliferation of cells leading to apoptosis and that this process is mediated through a TRAF6-dependent but NF-κB-independent mechanism. Materials—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against cyclin D1, cyclin D2, cyclin D3, cyclinE, p27 (Kip), and PARP and an Annexin V kit were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against caspase 3 and caspase 9 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverley, MA). TRAP staining was performed using a leukocyte acid phosphatase kit (387-A) from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Cell-permeable TRAF6 binding peptide with or without a Kaposi fibroblast growth factor leader sequence (AAVALLPAVLLALLAP-RKIPTEDEYTDRPSQPST; leader sequence in italics), and mutant TRAF6 binding peptide (AAVALLPAVLLALLAP-RKIATADEATDRPSQPST; leader sequence in italics and mutated amino acids underlined), NEMO (NF-κB essential modifier; IKKγ)-binding domain peptide (NBD) with or without an antennapedia homeodomain leader sequence (DRQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK-TALDWSWLQTE; leader sequence in italics) and leader sequences alone, mouse monoclonal anti-RANK antibody were kind gifts from Imgenex (San Diego, CA). Goat anti-rabbit-HRP conjugate was from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hercules, CA), and goat anti-mouse-HRP was from BD Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and anti-β-actin antibody were from Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). z-VAD, a pancaspase inhibitor, and SP600125, an anthrapyrazolone inhibitor of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12, fetal bovine serum, and 100× antibiotic-antimycotic solution were purchased from Invitrogen (Grand Island, NY). [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from ICN Pharmaceuticals (Costa Mesa, CA). A live/dead cell death detection kit was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Recombinant RANKL and RAW264.7 cells stably expressing FLAG-IκBα-DN under tetracycline-repressible promoter were kindly provided by Dr. Bryant G. Darnay (M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX). Cell Culture—Murine monocytic cell line RAW 264.7 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and a 1× antibiotic-antimycotic mixture. Occasionally cells were tested by Hoechst staining and by custom polymerase chain reaction for mycoplasma contamination. Cell Surface Expression of RANK—For analysis of cell surface expression of RANK, cells were harvested and suspended in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% fetal bovine serum and 0.1% sodium azide. The cells were preincubated with 10% goat serum for 20 min and washed, and then monoclonal mouse IgG anti-RANK antibody was added. Following 1-h incubation at 4 °C, the cells were washed and incubated for an additional 1 h in a FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG monoclonal antibodies. The cells were analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer and CellQuest acquisition and analysis programs (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). MTT Assay—The anti-proliferative effects of RANKL on RAW 264.7 cells were determined by the MTT dye uptake method as described earlier (20Bharti A.C. Donato N. Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. Blood. 2003; 101: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells (2000/well) were incubated in triplicate in a 96-well plate in the presence or absence of RANKL in a final volume of 0.1 ml for the indicated time periods at 37 °C. Thereafter, 0.025 ml of MTT solution (5 mg/ml in PBS) was added to each well. After a 2 h incubation at 37 °C, 0.1 ml of the extraction buffer (20% SDS, 50% dimethylformamide) was added, incubation was continued overnight at 37 °C, and then the OD was measured at 570 nm using a 96-well Multiscanner Autoreader (Dynatech MR 5000), with the extraction buffer as blank. The anti-proliferative effect was determined by the formula, anti-proliferative effect = [1 - (OD of the experiment samples/OD of the control)] × 100. Thymidine Incorporation Assay—The anti-proliferative effects of RANKL were also monitored by the thymidine incorporation method (20Bharti A.C. Donato N. Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. Blood. 2003; 101: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). For this, 2000 cells in 100 μl of medium were cultured in triplicate in 96-well plates in the presence or absence of RANKL. Six hours before the completion of the experiment, cells were pulse-treated with 0.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine, and the uptake of [3H]thymidine was monitored using a Matrix-9600 β-counter (Packard Instruments, Downers Grove, IL). The anti-proliferative effect was then determined by the formula, anti-proliferative effect = [1 - (cpm of the experiment samples/cpm of the control)] × 100. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts for NF-κB—Nuclear extracts were prepared according to Schreiber et al. (21Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 106 cells were washed with cold PBS and suspended in 0.4 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors for 30 min. The cells were then lysed with 12.5 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40. The homogenate was centrifuged, and supernatant containing the cytoplasmic extracts was stored frozen at -80 °C. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 25 μl of ice-cold nuclear extraction buffer. After 30 min of intermittent mixing, the extract was centrifuged, and supernatants containing nuclear extracts were secured. The protein content was measured by the Bradford method. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay for NF-κB—NF-κB activation was analyzed by electrophoretic mobility gel shift assay (EMSA) as described previously (22Chaturvedi M.M. LaPushin R. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14575-14583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 8 μg of nuclear extracts prepared from treated or untreated cells were incubated with 32P end-labeled 45-mer double-stranded NF-κB oligonucleotide from human immunodeficiency virus-1 long terminal repeat (5′-TTGTTACAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAG GGAGGCGTGG-3′) for 15 min at 37 °C, and the DNA-protein complex was resolved in a 6.6% native polyacrylamide gel. The radioactive bands from the dried gels were visualized and quantitated by using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) using ImageQuaNT software. c-Jun Kinase Assay—The c-Jun kinase assay was performed by a modified method as described earlier (14Darnay B.G. Haridas V. Ni J. Moore P.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20551-20555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 15Darnay B.G. Ni J. Moore P.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7724-7731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Briefly, 200 μg of whole-cell extract was treated with anti-JNK1 antibodies, and the immunocomplexes so formed were precipitated with protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Pierce Chemical). The kinase assay was performed using washed beads as source of enzyme and GST-Jun-(1-79) as substrate (2 μg/sample) in the presence of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP per sample. The kinase reaction was carried out by incubating the above mixture at 30 °C in the kinase assay buffer for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS sample buffer, then boiling. Finally, protein was resolved on a 10% reducing gel. The radioactive bands of the dried gel were visualized and quantitated by using the PhosphorImager as described above. Western Blot—Whole cell extracts were prepared in the lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.01 mg/ml aprotinin, 0.005 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 4 mm NaVO4). Lysates were then spun at 14,000 rpm for 10 min to remove insoluble material. 30-50 micrograms of extracts were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE gel. After electrophoresis, the proteins were electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, blocked with 5% nonfat milk, and probed with antibodies against cyclin D1, cyclin D2, cyclin D3, cyclin E, p27 (Kip) (1:3,000), caspase 3, caspase 9 (1:1,000), or β-actin (1:10,000). Thereafter, the blot was washed, exposed to HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h, and finally detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences, Arlington Heights, IL). For detection of PARP, lysates were resolved on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel and probed with PARP antibodies (1:3000). Anti-PARP antibody detects both intact PARP of 116-kDa and its 85-kDa cleaved fragment. Live/Dead Assay—Because the presence of growth factors in the serum may antagonize the anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects of RANKL, the cells were serum-starved prior to stimulation with RANKL. Cells were first incubated in absence of serum for 2 days and then treated with 100 ng/ml RANKL for 2 days. Cells were stained with the live/dead assay reagents for 30 min at room temperature. Cell viability were then examined under fluorescence microscope and counted for live/dead (green/red) ratio. Flow Cytometric Analysis of Cellular DNA—To determine the effect of RANKL on the cell cycle, RAW 264.7 cells were treated for different times, washed, and fixed with 70% ethanol. After incubation overnight at -20 °C, cells were washed with PBS, stained with propidium iodide (PI), and then suspended in staining buffer (PI, 10 μg/ml; Tween 20, 0.5%; RNase, 0.1% in PBS). The cells were analyzed using a FACS Vantage flow cytometer that uses the Cell Quest acquisition and analysis program (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Cells were gated to exclude cell debris, cell doublets, and cell clumps. To check the RANKL-induced cell death, cells were first serum-starved for 2 days prior to RANKL treatment, and the cells were fixed and stained with PI as indicated above. The apoptotic cells with hypodiploid DNA content were detected in the sub-G1 region in the FL-2A channel. Annexin V Staining—RANKL-treated cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in 100 μl of binding buffer containing FITC-conjugated Annexin V. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry after the addition of PI. Annexin V binds to those cells that express phosphatidylserine on the outer layer of the cell membrane, and PI stains the cellular DNA of cells with a compromised cell membrane. This allows for live cells (unstained with either fluorochrome), which appear in the left lower quadrant, to be discriminated from early apoptotic cells in right lower quadrant (stained only with Annexin V), late apoptotic cells in the right upper quadrant (stained with both Annexin V and PI), and necrotic/dead cells in left upper quadrant (stained only with PI) (23Vermes I. Haanen C. Steffens-Nakken H. Reutelingsperger C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 184: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (4627) Google Scholar). RANKL-induced Differentiation of RAW 264.7 Cells—For this RAW264.7 cells were cultured in 24-well dishes at a density of 1 × 104 cells per well and were allowed to adhere overnight. Medium was then replaced, and the cells were treated with 100 ng/ml RANKL. Cultures were stained for TRAP expression as described (24Ye H. Arron J.R. Lamothe B. Cirilli M. Kobayashi T. Shevde N.K. Segal D. Dzivenu O.K. Vologodskaia M. Yim M. Du K. Singh S. Pike J.W. Darnay B.G. Choi Y. Wu H. Nature. 2002; 418: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) using an acid phosphatase kit at different days, and photographs were taken using a Nikon Coolpix camera (Nikon, Japan). Statistical Analysis—All experiments were conducted in triplicate for at least three times. The statistical significance of difference between test groups was analyzed by the Student's t test (two-tailed). The difference was considered significant when the p value was <0.05. In the present report we investigated whether RANKL, like other members of the TNF superfamily, modulates the proliferation of monocytic RAW 264.7 cells and if so by what mechanism. This cell line was found to express RANK on its surface as indicated by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A) and FACS analysis (Fig. 1B). These results are in agreement with a previous report (25Bennett B.L. Sasaki D.T. Murray B.W. O'Leary E.C. Sakata S.T. Xu W. Leisten J.C. Motiwala A. Pierce S. Satoh Y. Bhagwat S.S. Manning A.M. Anderson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13681-13686Crossref PubMed Scopus (2244) Google Scholar). RANKL Inhibits the Proliferation of RAW 264.7 Cells—RANKL (100 ng/ml) significantly inhibited the time-dependent proliferation of RAW cells (Fig. 1C). Almost 55% inhibition of cell growth was noted after 5 days of treatment. The growth inhibitory effect of RANKL was dose-dependent (Fig. 1D). Because the MTT method detects cumulative mitochondrial activity in cultures, we confirmed the inhibitory effect of RANKL by the thymidine incorporation method (Fig. 1E). Growth Inhibitory Effects of RANKL Are NF-κB Activation-independent—To determine the role of NF-κB in RANKL-induced growth inhibition, RAW 264.7 cells stably transfected with a dominant negative-IκBα (IκBα-DN) under the control of a tetracycline-repressible promoter were treated with RANKL and TNF (used as a positive control). Both cytokines activated NF-κB in WT cells but not in IκBα-DN-transfected cells (Fig. 2, A and B). We then treated both WT and lκBα-DN-transfected RAW264.7 cells with different concentrations of RANKL and measured mitochondrial activity by the MTT method (Fig. 2C) or DNA synthesis by [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 2D). RANKL inhibited the proliferation of RAW264.7 (lκBα-DN) cells almost to the same extent as observed for RAW 264.7 (WT) cells. The RANKL-induced growth inhibition was slightly lower in cells lacking NF-κB activation than in the control, and this effect was more pronounced at a lower concentration (1 ng/ml) than higher concentration of RANKL (100 ng/ml). To confirm the lack of a role of NF-κB in RANKL-induced growth suppression, we used NBD, which blocks the activation of IKK by preventing the interaction of IKKβ with its regulatory subunit IKKγ (20Bharti A.C. Donato N. Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. Blood. 2003; 101: 1"
https://openalex.org/W2139850349,"Conservation of species threatened with imminent extinction may require drastic measures that can be emotionally charged, politically unsavory, and legally challenging. A complex example relates to the decline of the island fox ( Urocyon littoralis ), endemic to the California Channel Islands, off the coast of the United States.

The island fox exists as six subspecies, each found on a separate island. Serious population crashes recently occurred on three islands after colonization by golden eagles ( Aquila chrysaetos ). Preying mainly on abundant feral pigs ( Sus scrofa ), eagles reached numbers sufficient to drive the unwary fox toward extinction ([ 1 ][1]). Two subspecies are now extinct in the wild, and a third, endemic to Santa Cruz Island, dropped from approximately 1500 to fewer than 100 in less than a decade ([ 2 ][2]). Efforts to protect foxes by translocating golden eagles have been successful (31 eagles have been translocated since 1999, with an associated increase in fox survival), but efforts to remove the last 7 to 10 eagles have failed, preventing fox recovery ([ 3 ][3]).

In the next few months, a plan to eradicate feral pigs will begin ([ 4 ][4]). This action will help restore the island's natural vegetation, and might also help fox recovery by removing the eagles' prey base. To assess this strategy, we investigated the effect of different levels of pig and eagle control on fox persistence ([Fig. 1][5]). Modifying a preexisting model of interacting dynamics ([ 1 ][1], [ 5 ][6]), we simulated fox population sizes after 6 years, the projected time to pig eradication ([ 3 ][3], [ 4 ][4]). Unexpectedly, pig control leads to decline or extinction of the fox population if eagle control is insufficient. This counterintuitive result occurs because eagle predation on foxes increases as pig availability declines. Congruent with this, fox recovery is directly proportional to the intensity of eagle removal.

![ Fig. 1. ][7] Fig. 1. 
Three-dimensional plot showing fox population size after 6 years of controlling pigs and/or eagles. ( A ) Initial conditions (solid circle) taken from ([ 1 ][1]): 25 eagles, 154 foxes, and 7561 pigs. ( B ) Conservative 2003 levels: 10 eagles, 100 foxes, and 1000 pigs. Controlling pigs only (black line) can result in fox extinction [gray area in (A)]. ( C and D ) Change in fox population size over 100 years following eradication of pigs only (red line), of pigs and eagles (blue line), and no control of either species (green line).



Our model suggests that, had the eagle translocations not occurred, pig eradication could trigger deterministic fox extinction ([Fig. 1C][5]). After the translocations, pig eradication might ultimately facilitate fox recovery through eagle disappearance ([Fig. 1D][5]). However, fox numbers may first decline to <30 individuals, at which point population viability analysis predicts a high extinction probability ([ 5 ][6]): Demographic and environmental stochastity, additional sources of food, Allee effects, and disease epizootics all are expected to increase the probability of fox extinction. Our parsimonious model predicts that foxes are highly sensitive to predation by eagles and warns of the potentially disastrous effect of removing pigs while eagles remain. Because eagle eradication is doubtful by translocation alone, other means should be pursued, including lethal removal, if the fox is to be saved.

The advocated removal of a magnificent bird of prey has significant legal challenges. In the United States, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Bald Eagle and Golden Eagle Protection Act both prevent take of golden eagles except under special circumstances granted by the Secretary of the Interior.

This exemplifies how solving conservation problems is often more complex than redressing its primary cause (here, pigs). As often, biodiversity managers are now faced with a difficult dilemma. This time, it is associated with a paradox: the protection of the island fox, an endangered species, depends upon complete removal, by any and all means, of a small population of golden eagles, a protected species.

https://openalex.org/W2040509595,"Suppression of collagen synthesis is a major therapeutic goal in the treatment of fibrotic disorders. We show here that α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), a neuropeptide well known for its pigment-inducing capacity, modulates collagen synthesis and deposition. α-MSH in vitro suppresses the synthesis of collagen types I, III, and V and down-regulates the secretion of procollagen type I C-terminal peptide (PICP) in human dermal fibroblasts treated with the fibrogenic cytokine transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1). α-MSH did not interfere with TGF-β1 signaling, because TGF-β1-induced expression of collagen mRNA was not affected, implying a posttranscriptional mechanism. Human dermal fibroblasts in vitro express a high affinity binding site for MSH, which was identified by reverse transcription PCR and immunofluorescence analysis as the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC-1R). Immunohistochemical studies on normal adult human skin confirmed MC-1R expression in distinct dermal fibroblastic cells. The MC-1R on fibroblasts appears to be functionally relevant because α-MSH increased the amount of intracellular cAMP, and coincubation with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the human Agouti signaling protein abrogated the inhibition of TGF-β1-induced PICP secretion by α-MSH. To assess the in vivo relevance of these findings, a mouse model was used in which dermal fibrosis was induced by repetitive intracutaneous injections with TGF-β1. The inductive activity of TGF-β1 on collagen deposition and the number of dermal cells immunoreactive for vimentin and α-smooth muscle actin was significantly suppressed by injection of α-MSH. Melanocortins such as α-MSH may therefore represent a novel class of modulators with potential usefulness for the treatment of fibrotic disorders.

Melanocortins such as α-MSH may therefore represent a novel class of modulators with potential usefulness for the treatment of fibrotic disorders. Fibrotic and sclerotic diseases comprise a large and heterogeneous group of inflammatory, idiopathic, toxic, hereditary, and pharmacologically induced disorders such as hypertrophic scars, keloids, localized scleroderma, systemic sclerosis, sclerodermic graft versus host disease of the skin, cirrhosis of the liver, idiopathic and bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, or cyclosporine-induced nephropathy. The therapeutic options are limited, and treatment of these disabling disorders is still a challenge. A key feature of fibrotic disorders is excessive production of extracellular matrix, mainly type I collagen, followed by a gradual loss of organ function which, in some cases, can be fatal. In recent years it became apparent that transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), 1The abbreviations used are: TGF-β1, transforming growth factor-β1; α-MSH, α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone; α-SMA, α-smooth muscle actin; ASIP, Agouti signaling protein; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; FCS, fetal calf serum; HDF, human dermal fibroblasts; MC-R, melanocortin receptor; MC-1R, melanocortin-1 receptor; NDP-MSH, [Nle4,d-Phe7]α-MSH; PBS, phosphate buffered saline; PICP, procollagen I C-terminal peptide; POMC, pro-opiomelanocortin; RT, reverse transcription. a multifunctional cytokine, is crucially involved in the pathogenesis of fibrotic disorders (1Kawakami T.

Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (3004) Google Scholar). It enhances the expression of several collagens including types I, III, and V. TGF-β1 decreases the production of matrix-degrading proteases and enhances the synthesis of inhibitors of such proteases. TGF-β1 also increases extracellular cross-linking of collagen by enhancing the expression and the activity of lysyl oxidase (7Feres-Filho E.J. Choi Y.J. Han X. Takala T.E. Trackman P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30797-30803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These multiple activities explain the potent fibrotic effect of TGF-β1. Therefore, strategies aimed at antagonizing the strong profibrotic effect of TGF-β1 are regarded as providing a promising approach to preventing excessive collagen accumulation in fibrotic disorders (8McCormick L.L. Zhang Y. Tootell E. Gilliam A.C. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5693-5699PubMed Google Scholar, 9Yamamoto T. Takagawa S. Katayama I. Nishioka K. Clin.

Endocrinol. 2001; 170: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). α-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) is a tridecapeptide generated from pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) by proteolytic cleavage (reviewed in Ref. 11Slominski A. Wortsman J. Luger T.A. Paus R. Solomon S. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 979-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). It was originally isolated from the pituitary gland and characterized as a pigment-inducing factor regulating the coat color of many vertebrate species, but it turned out to regulate many other biological activities with regard to the skin (reviewed in Refs. 11Slominski A. Wortsman J. Luger T.A. Paus R. Solomon S. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 979-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar and 12Böhm M. Luger T.A. Horm. Res. 2000; 54: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The biological activities of α-MSH are mediated by a family of structurally related receptors that are known as the melanocortin receptors (MC-Rs). They belong to the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors with seven trans-membrane domains, and they activate adenylate cyclase after ligand binding. Five MC-R subtypes have been cloned that differ in their relative affinities to α-MSH and the other melanocortins (13Mountjoy K.G. Robbins L.S. Mortrud M.T. Cone R.D. Science. 1993; 257: 1248-1251Crossref Scopus (1458) Google Scholar, 14Cone R.D. Lu D. Koppula S. Vage D.I. Klungland H. Boston B. Chen W. Orth D.N. Pouton C. Kesterson R.A. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 287-318PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show that, in addition to its multiple biological effects, α-MSH suppresses TGF-β1-induced collagen synthesis by human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) in vitro. This effect is mediated via the MC-1R. α-MSH also exerts its anti-fibrogenic activity in vivo, because injection of α-MSH into mice reduces TGF-β1-induced fibrosis. Our data establish a role for melanocortins in fibroblast biology and point toward a therapeutic potential of α-MSH and its analogues in the treatment of fibrotic and sclerotic diseases. Cells and Culture Conditions—HDF from neonatal foreskin and adult skin as well as normal human melanocytes were purchased from Cell Systems, St. Katharinen, Germany. The human fibrosarcoma cell line HT-1080 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Fibroblasts were routinely cultured in RPMI 1640 (PAA, Cölbe, Germany), 1% glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (both from PAA), and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Normal human melanocytes were cultured in MBM2 medium plus MGM-3 aliquots as indicated by the manufacturer (Clonetics, Walkersville, MD). RNA Extraction, RT-PCR, and Sequencing—Total RNA was isolated from cells using a commercial purification kit (Promega, Madison, WI). After DNA digestion, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed with 15 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). The resulting cDNA was amplified with 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Promega) and MC-R primers under conditions identical to those described previously (15Hartmeyer M. Scholzen T. Becher E. Bhardwaj R.S. Schwarz T. Luger T.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1930-1937PubMed Google Scholar, 16Bhardwaj R. Becher E. Mahnke K. Hartmeyer M. Schwarz T. Scholzen T. Luger T.A. J.

Only RNA samples that did not yield amplification products were reverse transcribed. For some positive controls, genomic DNA from HDF was prepared by routine protocols. Amplicons were separated in 1.5% agarose gels. The resulting MC-1R-related band in HDF was purified using a gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA), cloned into pGEM-T easy vectors (Promega), and sequenced (4base lab GmbH, Reutlingen, Germany).Table IPrimer sets used for RT-PCR analysis of MC-RsGene accession numberGene productPrimer (F, forward; B, backward)aSequences are as deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) data base under the given accession number.SizebSize denotes the number of base pairs of the amplicon.ReferenceMC1R/AF326275MC-1RF: 5′-GCCACCATCGCCAAGAACC-3′B: 5′-ATAGCCAGGAAGAAGACCA-3′41615, 17MC2/Z25470cmRNA sequence for MC-2R is a co-linear but truncated form of the MC-5R.MC-2RF: 5′-CTGCATTTCTTGGATCT-3′B: 5′-AAGCTGCACATGGATGC-3′38015, 17MC3/NM_019888MC-3RF: 5′-CGGTGGCCGACATGCTGGTAAGTG-3′B: 5′-TGAGGAGCATCATGGCGAAGAACA-3′36615, 17MC4/NM_005912MC-4RF: 5′-CAATAGCCAAGAACAAGAATC-3′B: 5′-GACAACAAAGACGCCAATCAG-3′56615, 17MC5/NM_005913cmRNA sequence for MC-2R is a co-linear but truncated form of the MC-5R.MC-5RF: 5′-CATTGCTGTGGAGGTGTTTCT-3′B: 5′-GCCGTCATGATGTGGTGGTAG-3′35715-17a Sequences are as deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) data base under the given accession number.b Size denotes the number of base pairs of the amplicon.c mRNA sequence for MC-2R is a co-linear but truncated form of the MC-5R. Open table in a new tab Quantitative Real Time PCR—Quantification of mRNA levels of the various procollagen chains was carried out by real time fluorescence detection as described previously (18Müller C. Readhead C. Diederichs S. Idos G. Yang R. Tidow N. Serve H. Berdel W.E. Koeffler H.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3316-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). cDNA was prepared amplified by PCR in the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector (PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Primer and probe sequences were designed by the Primer Express software (PE Biosystems) or supplied by PE Biosystems (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) (18Müller C. Readhead C. Diederichs S. Idos G. Yang R. Tidow N. Serve H. Berdel W.E. Koeffler H.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3316-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The primers used were as follows: COL(I)α1 sense, 5′-CAGCCGCTTCACCTACAGC-3′, COL(I)α1 antisense, 5′-AATCACTGTCTTGCCCCAGG-3′, and COL(I)α1 probe, 5′-ACTGTCGATGGCTGCACGAGTCACAC-3′; COL(I)α 2 sense, 5′-GATTGAGACCCTTCTTACTCCTGAA-3′, COL(I)α 2 antisense, 5′-GGGTGGCTGAGTCTCAAGTCA-3′, and COL(I)α 2 probe, 5′-TCTAGAAAGAACCCAGCTCGCACATGC-3′; and COL(III)α 1 sense, 5′-TCCAACTGCTCCTACTCGCC-3′, COL(III)α 1 antisense, 5′-GAGGGCCTGGATCTCCCTT-3′, and COL(III)α 1probe 5′-CCTAATGGTCAAGGACCTCAAGGCCC-3′. Probes were labeled at the 5′-end with the reporter dyes 6-carboxyfluorescein or VIC and at the 3′-end with the quencher dye 6-carboxy-tetramethyl-rhodamine. The 5′-nuclease activity of the Taq polymerase (Applied Biosystems) cleaved the probe and released the fluorescent dyes, which were detected by the laser detector of the sequence detector. After the detection threshold was reached, the fluorescence signal was proportional to the amount of PCR product generated. The initial template concentration could be calculated from the cycle number when the amount of PCR product passed a threshold set in the exponential phase of the PCR. Relative gene expression levels were calculated using standard curves generated by serial dilutions of cDNA from HT1080 cells. The relative amounts of gene expression were calculated by using the expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as an internal standard. Expression of each gene was assessed by three independent PCR analyses and calculation of the mean ± S.E. Data were analyzed by the Student's t test. Binding Studies—[Nle4,d-Phe7]α-MSH (NDP-MSH) (Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland) was radioiodinated by the chloramine T method and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography. Binding studies were performed as described previously (19Schiöth H.B. Muceniece R. Wikberg J.E.S. Chhajlani V. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 288: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In short, cells were washed with binding buffer and distributed into 96-well plates. Cells were then incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 50 μl of binding buffer in each well containing a constant concentration of 0.2 nm125I-NDP-MSH and appropriate concentrations of unlabeled ligand. After incubation, the cells were washed with 0.2 ml of ice-cold binding buffer and detached with 0.2 ml of 0.1 n NaOH, and the radioactivity was counted in each well. The binding assays were performed in duplicate wells. Radioactivity was determined by a gamma counter (Wallac, Wizard Automatic), and data were analyzed with a software package for radioligand binding analyses. Data were analyzed by fitting it to formulas derived from the law of mass action by the method generally referred to as computer modeling. Immunofluorescence—HDF were seeded into chamber slides and fixed with methanol for 30 min at -20 °C or, for surface staining, with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% goat/donkey serum for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then incubated for 1 h with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against the human MC-1R (1 μg/ml). Production and characterization of the anti-human MC-1R is described in detail elsewhere (20Böhm M. Brzoska T. Schulte U. Schiller M. Kubitscheck U. Luger T.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 885: 372-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 21Böhm M. Metze D. Schulte U. Becher E. Luger T.A. Brzoska T. Exp. Dermatol. 1999; 8: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In some experiments, double staining with a monoclonal antibody against protein disulfide isomerase (1:100; Dako, Hamburg, Germany), a cytoplasmic marker (22Vaux D. Tooze J. Fuller S. Nature. 1990; 345: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 23Munro S. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1986; 46: 291-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar), was performed. Bound antibodies were visualized with a donkey anti-rabbit antibody coupled to Texas Red (1:100; Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) and a goat anti-mouse antibody coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:100; Dako). After mounting, specimens were examined with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (TCS E, Leica, Heidelberg, Germany). Determination of cAMP—For intracellular cAMP measurements, 2 × 104 HDF were seeded into 96-well tissue culture plates. The next day, the routine culture medium was changed to RPMI 1640 containing 1% FCS. Cells were cultured for additional 24 h followed by stimulation with α-MSH as indicated for 20 min in the presence of 0.1 mm isobutyl methylxanthine. 0.1-5 μm forskolin was used as a positive control. After incubation, supernatants were removed, and cells were lysed. cAMP levels in the lysates were determined by a specific enzyme immunoassay according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Triplicate wells were used for each individual treatment, and statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test. Collagen Analysis—HDF were seeded into 6-well tissue culture plates (250,000 per well) and allowed to attach and grow for 16 h. Subconfluent cell monolayers were then incubated with minimal essential medium containing 0.5% FCS and 50 μg/ml l-ascorbic acid for 24 h in the presence of TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml), α-MSH (10-6m), or a combination of both substances. HDF were rinsed and depleted for 1 h in methionine/cysteine-free minimal essential medium (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA). Cells were labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine mix (50 μCi/ml) for 16 h in the presence of ascorbate and the above agents. Media were collected, cell cultures rinsed three times with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline, and cells were scraped into 1% Nonidet P-40 in Tris-buffered saline with a rubber policeman. Cell lysates were centrifuged, and aliquots of the supernatant were subjected to liquid scintillation counting to determine cell mass. Media and combined cell lysates/scrapings were treated with pepsin to destroy non-collagenous proteins (24Raghunath M. Bruckner P. Steinmann B. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 940-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Proteins in either fraction were precipitated using methanol/chloroform and processed for SDS-PAGE (5% acrylamide; acryl/bisacryl, 37.5:1). All loaded aliquots were calibrated for cell mass so that all slots contained pepsin-treated collagen derived from the same amount of cells. Slab gels were fixed, and radiolabeled collagens were detected by autoradiography (25Raghunath M. Steinmann B. Delozier-Blanchet C. Extermann P. Superti-Furga A. Pediatr. Res. 1994; 36: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Representative gels were subjected to densitometry using the Biostep Phoretix Grabber (Biostep, Jahnsdorf, Germany) Determination of Procollagen I C-terminal Peptide—The amounts of procollagen I C-terminal peptide used as a marker for procollagen I secretion were determined using a commercially available ELISA (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan). HDF were seeded into 12-well tissue culture plates at a density of 250,000 cells per well. Confluent HDFs were then deprived of FCS for 2 days and subsequently stimulated with α-MSH (10-6-10-10m), TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml), or both agents in the presence of 50 μg/ml ascorbate. In some experiments, cells were coincubated with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the amino acids 87-132 of the human Agouti signaling peptide (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Belmont, CA) at a 10-fold molar excess. Culture supernatant were harvested after 48 h, centrifuged, and frozen at -70 °C until use. Statistical evaluation from triplicate wells was performed using the Student's t test. Mouse Model for Cutaneous Fibrosis—For in vivo evaluation of the anti-fibrogenic effect of α-MSH, a mouse model described previously by Shinozaki et al. (26Shinozaki M. Kawara S. Hayashi N. Kakinuma T. Igarashi A. Takehara K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) was used with slight modifications. Accordingly, cutaneous fibrosis was induced by intracutaneous injections of 800 ng of TGF-β1 into the neck of newborn Balb/c mice on three consecutive days. Treatment groups (four groups of three mice each) consisted of mice injected with TGF-β1, α-MSH (25 μg), TGF-β1 plus α-MSH, and the solvent (0.1% BSA in PBS) in which TGF-β1 had been solubilized. On day 4, mice were sacrificed, and 4-mm punch biopsies were taken from the sites of injection for immunohistochemical analysis. Immunohistochemistry—After fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedment in paraffin, biopsies from mouse skin were processed with the following stains: (i) hematoxylin and eosin; (ii) van Gieson stain, in which collagen appears red; and (iii) resorcin-fuchsin stain, according to Weigert, in which elastic tissue appears black. For collagen staining, the sections were treated with 1 mg/ml pepsin (Sigma) in 0.5 m acetic acid, washed, and incubated with a rabbit antibody against collagen type I (1:100; DPC Biermann, Bad Nauheim, Germany) for 1 h. For the staining of vimentin, sections were microwave-treated to unmask epitopes, followed by incubation with a polyclonal antibody from Abcam (Cambridge, UK) for 30 min at 37 °C. For the staining of α-smooth muscle actin, a monoclonal antibody from Dunn Labortechnik (Asbach, Germany) was incubated for 1 h at 2 μg/ml without prior unmasking. Immunohistochemistry for MC-1R in sections of normal adult human skin (n > 5) was performed exactly as outlined previously (17Böhm M. Schiller M. Li Z. Ständer S. Metze D. Schiöth H.B. Skottner A.

Sections were developed by the indirect immunoperoxidase technique using 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (Sigma) as a chromogen. Negative controls included incubation with control IgG at the same protein concentration as the primary antibody, omission of the first antibody, or pre-incubation with the immunogenic peptide in 10-fold weight excess in the case of MC-1R immunostaining. Vimentin immunostaining and α-smooth muscle actin immunostaining in sections of mouse skin were quantitatively assessed by counting the number of immunoreactive interfollicular dermal cells in three high power fields (×400). Means ± S.D. from 3-4 independent experiments were analyzed by analysis of variance. α-MSH Modulates Collagen Expression by HDF in Vitro—We addressed the question of whether α-MSH can modulate the key function of HDF, namely the expression and secretion of collagen. To this end, cultured, normal HDF from neonatal foreskin were treated with α-MSH, TGF-β1, or both substances. The amounts of collagen present in cell lysates and culture supernatants were separately determined after metabolic labeling, pepsin digestion, and SDS-PAGE. TGF-β1, a well known inducer of collagen synthesis (6Massague J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (3004) Google Scholar), increased the amount of secreted collagens in the culture medium (Fig. 1A). α-MSH alone appeared to reduce the extracellular amount of collagens I, III, and V by 50-70% as determined by densitometry (Fig. 1A, and data not shown). This reduction was not due to intracellular retention, although there was some increase in α1(I) chains that we attribute to a higher synthesis rate. The intracellular bands showed no delayed migration and, thus, excluded significant posttranslational overmodification due to abnormal intra-endoplasmatic retention (Fig. 1A). Most strikingly, α-MSH dramatically reversed the stimulatory effects of TGF-β1 on the extracellular collagen presence with the strongest effects on collagens I and III and somewhat milder effects on collagen V (Fig. 1A). In the conspicuous absence of intracellular retention, these findings implicate either intracellular or extracellular proteolytic degradation or a combination of both. To further substantiate the activity of α-MSH on collagen synthesis and/or secretion, we determined the amount of procollagen I C-terminal peptide (PICP) in the culture media of HDF stimulated with α-MSH, TGF-β1, or both agents. The addition of TGF-β1 led to a dramatic increase of PICP in the culture medium by >500%. In accordance with the modulatory effect of α-MSH on the TGF-β1-induced collagen biosynthesis and subsequent secretion, we found significantly reduced secreted amounts of PICP by HDF (677.9 ± 60.1 pg/ml versus 1313.9 ± 136 pg/ml; p < 0.005) (Fig. 1B). α-MSH alone, in contrast, did not affect the basal amounts of secreted PICP. These findings suggested either an intracellular or an extracellular cause for the reduction of secreted procollagen I. Modulation of Collagen Synthesis by α-MSH Is Not Mediated by Reduced mRNA Expression—We next wondered if the modulatory activity of α-MSH on collagen synthesis is regulated at the transcriptional level. HDF from neonatal foreskin were stimulated with α-MSH, TGF-β1, or both agents for 12 h. The relative mRNA levels for the α1(I) and α2(I) chains of collagen I (alleles COL1A1 and COL1A2, respectively) and for the α1(III) chains for collagen III (allele COL3A1) were subsequently determined by quantitative real-time PCR. TGF-β1 significantly increased the mRNA levels of collagen type I α1 and α2 as well as that of collagen type III α1 as compared with non-treated cells (Table II). The observed rate of increase in the amount of these collagens by TGF-β1 was in accordance with earlier reports (27Raghow R. Postlethwaite A.E. Keski-Oja J. Moses H.L. Kang A.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1987; 79: 1285-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Despite some variation, neither α-MSH alone nor coincubation of α-MSH and TGF-β1 caused a significant reduction in the relative levels of the collagen mRNAs (Table II). Similar results were obtained when HDFs were treated with TGF-β1 and α-MSH for 24 h (data not shown). These findings show that α-MSH does not interfere with TGF-β1 signaling and that α-MSH may affect collagen expression at the posttranscriptional level.Table IIα MSH does not suppress collagen synthesis at the transcriptional level in HDFGene productRelative mRNA expressionaRelative mRNA levels were measured by real-time PCR and normalized for GAPDH.

Open table in a new tab Detection of High Affinity Binding Sites for MSH on HDF—The identified effects of α-MSH on the amount of extracellular collagen suggested the presence of specific binding sites in HDF. Therefore, we examined HDF from neonatal foreskin for competitive radioligand binding using an iodinated synthetic α-MSH analogue, NDP-MSH. Displacement was performed with an unlabeled ligand at varying concentrations, and COS-1 cells were used as a negative control. HDF exhibited a specific and saturable binding kinetic with 125I-NDP-MSH. The affinity of the radioligand was similar to COS-1 cells transfected with the human MC-1R (Fig. 2). The Ki values were 0.058 ± 0.012 nm for the HDF and 0.086 ± 0.033 nm for COS-1 cells transfected with the human MC-1R, the latter value being similar to previous studies (19Schiöth H.B. Muceniece R. Wikberg J.E.S. Chhajlani V. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 288: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). HDF, therefore, exhibited similar affinity but slightly lower expression levels of high affinity MSH binding sites than did COS-1 cells transfected with MC-1R. These data strongly suggested that α-MSH binds to specific surface receptors on the surface of HDF, which appear to mediate its biological action. Expression of MC-1R in HDF in Vitro and in Situ—To investigate in detail the expression of MC-Rs in HDF, we performed RT-PCR analysis using primers against all known MC-Rs (Table I). MC-1R was the only MC-R expressed in HDF derived from neonatal foreskin (Fig. 3A). Similarly, HDF derived from adult human skin expressed MC-1R at the RNA level (data not shown). The MC-1R amplification product of HDF comigrated exactly with that of normal human melanocytes used as a positive control (Fig. 3A). The identity of the amplification product in HDF (416 bp) was determined by DNA sequencing and found to be identical with the mRNA sequence of MC-1R as deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (Table I, and data not shown). In contrast to MC-1R, no other MC-R was expressed in HDF as shown by RT-PCR (Fig. 3A). The amplification products of the positive controls were all of the expe"

Little is known about deleterious mutations in such stages, and consequently there is limited understanding of what evolutionary events occur. In a deleterious mutation accumulation experiment in prolonged stationary phase of Escherichia coli, about 0.03 slightly deleterious mutations were observed per genome per day. This is over an order of magnitude higher than extrapolations from fast-growing cells, but in line with inferences from observations in adaptive stationary phase mutation experiments. These findings may affect understanding of bacterial evolution and the emergence of bacterial pathogenicity."
https://openalex.org/W2030120338,"Recent satellite observations of Rossby waves and chlorophyll anomalies propagating in subtropical gyres have suggested that wave-induced upwelling could stimulate photosynthesis. Instead, we show that chlorophyll maxima are located in abnormally warm water, in Rossby wave–induced convergences. This excludes inputs of nutrients from deeper water. We argue that the sea color anomalies are not caused by chlorophyll but by floating particles evolved from the ecosystem and accumulated by Rossby waves, acting as “marine hay rakes,” in convergence zones. Such processes may be determinant for the distribution of living organisms in oligotrophic areas."

Furthermore, possible biological functions of Hcf101, based on its modular structure, will be discussed in the context of the mutant phenotype. Growth Conditions and Plant Material—Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings were grown in growth chambers under continuous white light with a light intensity of 80 μmol m–2 s–1 at 22 °C. For physiological experiments, seeds were sterilized with 33% (v/v) bleach and 0.08% N-laurylsarcosinate, washed four times with 1 ml of sterile water, and placed on Petri dishes with solidified half-strength Murashige and Skoog (29Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473-493Crossref Scopus (54340) Google Scholar) media supplemented with 1.35% (w/v) sucrose. To ensure synchronized germination, the plates were kept in darkness at 4 °C for the first 48 h. The Arabidopsis mutant hcf101-1 was described (1Meurer J. Meierhoff K. Westhoff P. Planta. 1996; 198: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The T-DNA insertion line 296G02, named hcf101-2, was provided by Dr. B. Weisshaar (Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research, Cologne, Germany). Seeds were germinated on a sulfadiazine-containing medium (15 μg/ml). Seedlings from a segregating population with a hcf phenotype were further analyzed. The T-DNA insertion site in hcf101-2 is located in the 5′-region of the gene (54 bp upstream of the ATG codon), as confirmed by PCR and sequence analyses.

Segregation analyses confirmed that hcf phenotype is caused by a T-DNA insertion in the DNA for the 3′-untranslated leader region (66 bp downstream of the stop codon). For the experiment shown in Fig. 9, 12-day-old etiolated seedlings were illuminated for 4, 24, or 72 h with continuous white light. PAM101/PDA-100 Measurements—In vivo Chl a measurements were performed with 18-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings using the pulse amplitude-modulated fluorometer PAM101 equipped with a PAM data acquisition system (PDA-100, Walz, Effeltrich, Germany). Prior to measurements, the fiber optic of the emitter/detector unit (101-ED) was positioned closely to the upper surface of the plants, which were dark-adapted for 7 min before the minimal fluorescence Fo was recorded. A saturating white light pulse of 6000 μmol m–2 s–1 for 600 ms was used to determine the maximal fluorescence Fm and the Fv/Fm ratio. After 1 min, actinic red light (650 nm, 40 μmol m–2 s–1) emitted from a photodiode (102-L) was turned on, and the fluorescence parameter Fm′ of illuminated leaves was determined by the application of saturating flashes every 30 s until a stable fluorescence level (Ft) was reached. Subsequently, the actinic light was switched off to determine the minimal fluorescence Fo′ in the light adapted state. The fluorescence quenching parameter qP (photochemical quenching) was calculated as qP = (Fm′ – Fs)/(Fm′ – Fo), whereas Fs (steady state fluorescence) was determined as Fs = Ft – Fo′. The quantum yield of PSII (ΦPSII) was calculated as ΦPSII = (Fm′ – Fs)/Fm′. P700 Absorbance Changes—The light-induced in vivo absorbance changes of P700 at 810 nm were measured using the PAM101/PDA-100 fluorometer connected to a dual wavelength emitter/detector unit (ED P700DW). Saturating far-red light (730 nm, 15 watts m–2) emitted by a far-red diode (102-FR) for 1 min was applied to oxidize P700. After 30 s of far-red light, a strong white light pulse of 6000 μmol m–2 s–1 was applied for 400 ms. The maximum signal difference (ΔA810max) between the reduced and the oxidized states of P700 was used to estimate the photochemical capacity of PSI (31Barth C. Krause G.H.

The slurry was filtered through two layers of Mira cloth and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in the same buffer, and the Chl concentration was adjusted to 10 μg/ml. Chl concentrations were determined according to Porra et al. (32Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedelmann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4743) Google Scholar). Photoreduction Measurements—NADP+ photoreduction was measured as absorbance changes of NADPH at 340 nm. The reductase activity was determined in a 450-μl volume containing a thylakoid membrane homogenate (33Machold O. Simpson D.J. Moller B.L. Carlsberg Res.

The primers generated SacII and SalI sites (5′-GTCACCGCGGCCTGAGAGCCGTATATTGG-3′ and 5′-GGCTGTCGACCTAGACTTCGACTGGAGAC-3′) for in-frame cloning of the fragment with the N-terminal His affinity tag of pET15 (40Schneider A.

After 30 min at 4 °C, the bacterial lysate was sonicated 12 times for 10 s (MS72, Bandelin Sonoplus Electronic UW2200, Berlin, Germany). The overexpressed protein in inclusion bodies was pelleted at 20,000 × g for 30 min, and the pellet was solubilized in 100 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 8 m urea. The fusion protein was purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resign matrix (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbit by subcutaneous injection of 150 μg of purified antigen, followed by six boosts every 4 weeks with protein. Blood was collected 10 days after the last immunization. The same hcf101 fragment with SmaI (5′-AGCCCGGGTCCTGAGAGCCGTATATTGG-3′) and SalI (cf. above) sites was PCR-amplified and cloned into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) to generate an in-frame protein fusion with glutathione S transferase (GST). Escherichia coli proteins (cf. above) were separated on 10% SDS/polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The prominent band on the filter was visualized with Ponceau stain and excised. The filter pieces were blocked, and the antibodies raised against the His-tagged protein (cf. above) were purified on the GST fusion (41Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G.

A dilution of 1:200 was used for Western analysis. All other antibodies have been described (42Palomares R. Herrmann R.G. Oelmüller R. Eur. J.

Hippler (Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena; PsaA and PsaD). The specificity of the antibody signals obtained by the Hcf101 antiserum was confirmed by immunoprecipitations of Hcf101 from radiolabeled soluble protein extracts as well as from an E. coli protein extract containing the Hcf101-GST fusion protein. In both instances, only a single polypeptide was precipitated. The Hcf101-GST fusion protein had the expected molecular mass of 63 kDa, whereas the precipitate from the soluble plastid fraction corresponded to ∼51 kDa. Radiolabeling of Proteins—14-day-old mutant and wild type seedlings were incubated in reaction buffer containing 20 mm KH2PO4, pH 6.3, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, and 40 μg/ml cycloheximide at room temperature and ambient light. After 30 min, the medium was replaced by reaction buffer containing 25 μl of [35S]methionine (specific activity >1000 Ci/mmol) and 20 μg/ml cycloheximide. 30 min later, the leaves were harvested, washed twice with distilled water, and frozen at –70 °C. Insoluble membrane proteins were resuspended in 100 mm Na2CO3 and 50 mm dithiothreitol. After trichloroacetic acid precipitation, the radioactivity in the pellet was determined by scintillation counting (Beckman LS6500, Munich, Germany). Immunoprecipitations with protein A-Sepharose were described (41Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience Publishers, New York1989: 4.10.16Google Scholar). Isolation of Chloroplasts and Total Membrane and Soluble Proteins—Chloroplasts for immunolocalization analyses were isolated from 18-day-old plants. The chloroplast-enriched fraction was purified on a Percoll gradient. Intact chloroplasts were washed twice with isolation medium (0.3 M sorbitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm Na2EDTA, 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8, and 10 mm NaHCO3) and disrupted in breaking buffer (50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8, and 10 mm MgCl2). The stromal and membrane fractions were separated by centrifugation (20,000 × g for 20 min). The soluble proteins from the supernatant were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and resuspended in 100 mm Na2CO3, 10% (w/v) sucrose, and 50 mm dithiothreitol. The membrane proteins in the pellet were resuspended in breaking buffer. Positional Cloning of hcf101—A segregating F2 progeny was generated by crosses of male pollen donor plants of heterozygous lines of hcf101-1 in Columbia background with female recipient plants of ecotype Landsberg, followed by selfing of the resulting F1 plants. To assign the mutant locus to one of the Arabidopsis chromosomes, 28 F2 plants homozygous for the wild type hcf101 locus were used to produce non-segregating F3 families for restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses with the pARMS set (44Schäffner A.R. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1996; 14: 11-16Crossref Google Scholar). DNA for RFLP analysis was isolated according to Dellaporta et al. (45Dellaporta S.L. Wood J. Hicks J.B. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1983; 1: 19-21Crossref Scopus (6378) Google Scholar). For high resolution mapping, genomic DNA from single leaves of individual F2 plants was isolated. The simple sequence length polymorphism marker nga126 and the cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers m255, abi3, T32C9, and g4711, which are used for fine mapping procedures, were described previously (46Bell C.J. Ecker J.R. Genomics. 1994; 19: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 47Diener A. Hirschi H.

The newly developed CAPS markers muj8/IV (5′-CGGCGTTATTTAACGACGACG-3′ and 5′-GACTTCATGGGCAACTTTGTCTGG-3′) on the P1 clone MUJ8 (AB028621), K8 (5′-CGATCAGACTAATCGGATCAGC-3′ and 5′-GCCTTCTACTTTCATGGACC-3′) and K7M2/V (5′-CAGAACTTGCTTAGTCTCCTTCGCG-3′ and 5′-ATAACTAGATGACTGCCAACCCGG-3′) on the TAC clone K7M2 (AP000382), and MXP5-X (5′-CGAGTTTCTCTTGTTGAGCC-3′ and 5′-CGTTCGCTCACTCCAATGCC-3′) on the P1 clone MXP5 (AP002048) showed polymorphisms between ecotypes Columbia and Landsberg for the restriction enzymes VspI, XhoI, HpaI, and EcoRI, respectively. RT-PCR and Northern Blot Analyses—Total mRNA from 18-day-old wild type and mutant plants were isolated according to Ref. 1Meurer J. Meierhoff K. Westhoff P. Planta. 1996; 198: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar. RT-PCR was performed with 5′-GCTGATGTCTATGGTCCAAGTCTACC-3′ and 5′-CAATTACCGCTGCTGTCAATGGCGC-3′ and the Titan One Tube RT-PCR system (Roche Diagnostics). PCR fragments were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel. Northern blot analyses were performed as described (41Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience Publishers, New York1989: 4.10.16Google Scholar). Hybridization probes were labeled by random priming. Electron Microscopy—Electron micrographs were performed essentially as described (48Kusnetsov V.V. Oelmüller R. Sarwat M.I. Porfirova S.A. Cherepneva G.N. Herrmann R.G. Kulaeva O.N. Planta. 1994; 194: 318-327Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Characterization of hcf101-1—The recessive hcf101-1 mutant was generated by ethylmethanesulfonate mutagenesis (1Meurer J. Meierhoff K. Westhoff P. Planta. 1996; 198: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). When grown on soil, homozygous mutant seedlings are lethal. After germination, they developed pale green cotyledons but no primary leaves (1Meurer J. Meierhoff K. Westhoff P. Planta. 1996; 198: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). On sucrose-supplemented media, hcf101-1 revealed a wild type-like habitus accompanied by the ability to flower. Furthermore, depending on the light intensity (10–100 μmol m–2 s–1), the Chl content in the mutant was decreased up to 80–90% compared with the wild type (e.g. 100 μmol m–2 s–1, 89.5 ± 0.3 versus 8.6 ± 0.2 μg/100 mg fresh weight). The decreased Chl a/b-ratio of the mutant (e.g. 100 μmol m–2 s–1, 3.26 ± 0.01 wild type versus 2.60 ± 0.01 hcf101-1) indicates a loss of Chl a-associated proteins. The mutant hcf101-1 did not show any detectable absorbance changes of P700 at 810 nm, indicating that PSI is not functional (cf. Table I; Ref. 1Meurer J. Meierhoff K. Westhoff P. Planta. 1996; 198: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). This was confirmed by fluorescence measurements at 77 K (Fig. 1A). The emission band at 733 nm in the wild type, characteristic for a functional PSI, was shifted to 727 nm in the mutant. This blue shift indicates an impaired transfer of excitation energy from Lhca1/Lhca4 to the PSI core. Because all four Lhca proteins are only slightly reduced under our growth conditions (∼80% compared with the wild type; Fig. 1B), the impairment is likely to be caused by lesions in those PSI proteins that are directly involved in electron transfer. In older seedlings or seedlings kept under high light intensities, the overall level of Lhca proteins decreases, with Lhca3 being the most sensitive protein (data not shown). Finally, no NADP+ photoreduction can be detected with thylakoid membranes of hcf101-1 (wild type value 18.9 ± 1.5 μmol NADPH mg–1 Chl h–1).Table IComparison of Chl a fluorescence parameters of wild type and hcf101 seedlings determined by PAM101/PDA-100Fv/Fm1-qPΦPSIIΔA810 max%Wild type0.82 ± 0.010.18 ± 0.010.65 ± 0.01100 ± 5.9hcf101-10.52 ± 0.020.99 ± 00.01 ± 00 ± 0hcf101-20.53 ± 0.040.61 ± 0.070.16 ± 0.023.8 ± 1.2hcf101-30.56 ± 0.060.21 ± 0.030.38 ± 0.0610.3 ± 2.5 Open table in a new tab Measurements of the Chl a fluorescence induction showed a significantly reduced ratio of variable to maximum fluorescence (Fv/Fm), (cf. Table I; Ref. 1Meurer J. Meierhoff K. Westhoff P. Planta. 1996; 198: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). No photochemical quenching (qP) could be measured in hcf101-1, suggesting that the primary electron acceptor QA is reduced and that the electrons released from PSII accumulate in the plastoquinone pool. Taken together, these data clearly indicate that the mutation primarily affects the electron transport through PSI (cf. also Ref. 1Meurer J. Meierhoff K. Westhoff P. Planta. 1996; 198: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Northern analysis with representative genes for nuclear and plastid-encoded PSI subunits demonstrated that the mutation had no effect on the accumulation of transcripts (Fig. 2). Immunoblot analyses uncovered that hcf101-1 contains barely any of the subunits PsaA, PsaC, PsaF, PsaG, and PsaH (Fig. 3). The reaction center core subunit PsaA was reduced by >95%. Representative proteins of the PSII (PsbO) and the cytochrome b6f complex (PetB) were not affected in the mutant (Fig. 3). In contrast, in vivo labeling experiments of wild type and hcf101-1 proteins with [35S]methionine (Fig. 4) and the immunoprecipitation of PsaA (Fig. 4, bottom) demonstrated that photosystem I subunits are synthesized in the mutant. This indicates that accelerated degradation rather than a block in protein synthesis is responsible for the reduced amounts of PSI reaction center polypeptides in hcf101-1.Fig. 3Immunoblot analyses of thylakoid protein extracts from wild type (WT) and hcf101-1 with antisera raised against the polypeptides indicated on the right side. 10 (WT and hcf101-1), 5 (WT/2), 2.5 (WT/4), or 1.25 (WT/8) μg of total membrane protein was loaded per lane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Pattern of [35S] radiolabeled plastome-encoded membrane proteins from 14-day-old wild type (WT) and hcf101 seedlings. 200,000 cpm were loaded per lane.

No stroma lamellae and assimilatory starch can be detected in the mutant. Furthermore, the grana stacks, located in parallel bundles in wild type organelles, appear to be less organized in the mutant, presumably due to the lack of connecting stromal thylakoids.

https://openalex.org/W2051383123,"Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 5 (IGFBP-5) is a secreted protein that binds to insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and modulates IGF actions on cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and motility. IGFBP-5 also regulates these cellular events through IGF-independent mechanisms. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms governing these diverse actions of IGFBP-5, we screened a human cDNA library by a yeast two-hybrid system using IGFBP-5 as bait and identified fibronectin (FN) as a potential IGFBP-5-interacting partner. The complex formation of IGFBP-5 and FN was established by glutathione <i>S</i>-transferase pull-down, solution, and solid phase binding assays using glutathione <i>S</i>-transferase-IGFBP-5 and native IGFBP-5 <i>in vitro</i> and by co-immunoprecipitation <i>in vivo</i>. Binding assay using deletion mutants indicated that the IGFBP-5 C domain binds to the 10<sup>th</sup> and 11<sup>th</sup> type I repeats of FN. IGFBP-5 potentiated IGF-I-induced cell migration in FN-null, but not in wild-type, mouse embryonic cells. When FN was reintroduced either as an adhesive substrate or in solution to the FN-null cells, the potentiating effect of IGFBP-5 on IGF-I-induced cell migration was abolished. Binding of IGFBP-5 to FN had no effect on the ability of IGFBP-5 to bind IGF-I, but it increased the proteolytic degradation of IGFBP-5. Inhibition of IGFBP-5 proteolysis restored the potentiating effect of IGFBP-5. These results suggest that FN and IGFBP-5 bind to each other, and this binding negatively regulates the ligand-dependent action of IGFBP-5 by triggering IGFBP-5 proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2000130784,"The activation of CDK2-cyclin E in late G1 phase has been shown to play a critical role in retinoblastoma protein (pRb) inactivation and G1-S phase progression of the cell cycle. The phosphatidylinositol 3-OH-kinase inhibitor LY294002 has been shown to block cyclin D1 accumulation, CDK4 activity and, thus, G1 progression in α-thrombin-stimulated IIC9 cells (Chinese hamster embryonic fibroblasts). Our previous results show that expression of cyclin E rescues S phase progression in α-thrombin-stimulated IIC9 cells treated with LY294002, arguing that cyclin E renders CDK4 activity dispensable for G1 progression. In this work we investigate the ability of α-thrombin-induced CDK2-cyclin E activity to inactivate pRb in the absence of prior CDK4-cyclin D1 activity. We report that in the absence of CDK4-cyclin D1 activity, CDK2-cyclin E phosphorylates pRb in vivo on at least one residue and abolishes pRb binding to E2F response elements. We also find that expression of cyclin E rescues E2F activation and cyclin A expression in cyclin D kinase-inhibited, α-thrombin-stimulated cells. Furthermore, the rescue of E2F activity, cyclin A expression, and DNA synthesis by expression of E can be blocked by the expression of either CDK2(D145N) or RbΔCDK, a constitutively active mutant of pRb. However, restoring four known cyclin E-CDK2 phosphorylation sites to RbΔCDK renders it susceptible to inactivation in late G1, as assayed by E2F activation, cyclin A expression, and S phase progression. These data indicate that CDK2-cyclin E, without prior CDK4-cyclin D activity, can phosphorylate and inactivate pRb, activate E2F, and induce DNA synthesis.

Progression through the cell cycle is governed by the kinase activities of specific CDKs, which are regulated by association with the regulatory cyclin subunits. The sequential activation of early G1 CDK activity, CDK4 or CDK6 together with cyclin D1, D2, or D3, and the late G1 CDK activity, CDK2 together with cyclin E1 or E2, is believed to be required for progression through G1 and into S phase. Because IIC9 cells contain CDK4, but not CDK6, and cyclin D1, but not D2 or D3, CDK4-cyclin D1 activation in early G1 is required for the expression of cyclin E, CDK2 activity, and G1-S phase progression (3Philips-Mason P.J.

Numerous proteins that are essential for growth, such as the cyclins E and A, and proteins essential for DNA replication, such as DNA polymerase α, thymidine kinase, dihydrofolate reductase, and histone H2A are controlled at least in part by E2F-responsive promoters (28Botz J.

Therefore, the major role of the G1 CDKs, CDK4/6-cyclin D and CDK2-cyclin E in controlling G1-S phase progression, is the inactivation of pRb. Although the role of CDK4-cyclin D in the inactivation of pRb is well established, the role of CDK2-cyclin E in the inactivation of pRb is less clear. CDK2-cyclin E, in the absence of prior phosphorylation by CDK4-cyclin D, is able to phosphorylate pRb in vitro (16Mittnacht S. Lees J.A. Desai D. Harlow E. Morgan D.O. Weinberg R.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 118-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and overexpression of cyclin E or A can overcome pRb-mediated suppression of proliferation (42Hinds P.W. Mittnacht S. Dulic V. Arnold A. Reed S.I. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 993-1006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Ezhevsky et al. (18Ezhevsky S.A. Ho A. Becker-Hapak M. Davis P.K. Dowdy S.F. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 4773-4784Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) show that CDK2-cyclin E activity phosphorylates pRb in vivo. In agreement with these data, Lundberg and Weinberg (43Lundberg A.S. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar) also find that CDK2-cyclin E activity was necessary for phosphorylation-induced inactivation of pRb. However, these authors and others suggest that phosphorylation of pRb by CDK2-cyclin E requires pRb to be hypophosphorylated, and thus, the inactivation of pRb involves sequential phosphorylation by cyclin D-CDK4/6 and cyclin E-CDK2 (24Harbour J.W.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1759-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Conversely, the report of a cyclin E → D1 “knockin” mouse offers an argument against the strict requirement for sequential phosphorylation of pRb by the G1 CDK-cyclin complexes (45Geng Y. Whoriskey W. Park M.Y. Bronson R.T. Medema R.H. Li T. Weinberg R.A. Sicinski P. Cell. 1999; 97: 767-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). These mice, in which the coding sequence of the cyclin D1 gene is replaced with the coding sequence for cyclin E, reveal that cyclin E expression, which results in a 20% change in the phosphorylation state of pRb, rescues the phenotypic deficiencies found in the cyclin D1-ablated mouse (46Sicinski P. Donaher J.L. Parker S.B. Li T. Fazeli A. Gardner H. Haslam S.Z. Bronson R.T. Elledge S.J. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 621-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Although many tissues are unaffected by the loss of cyclin D1 because of compensatory functions of cyclin D2 and D3, several tissues, including retinal and breast tissue are severely deficient in growth, presumably because D2 and D3 are not expressed in these tissues and could not compensate. Implicit in the discovery that cyclin E expression under the cyclin D1 promoter reverses the cyclin D1–/– phenotypes is the understanding that, in the rescued tissues, pRb is inactivated by cyclin E kinase activity without prior hypophosphorylation by cyclin D kinase, with the caveat that the genes for cyclin D2 and D3 are still present in these animals. Previously, we reported that inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase by LY294002 inhibits cyclin D1 accumulation, CDK4-cyclin D1 activity, and passage through G1 into S phase in IIC9 cells (3Philips-Mason P.J. Raben D.M. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18046-18053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, expression of cyclin E in the presence of LY294002 rescues cyclin E-CDK2 activity and G1 progression (47Keenan S.M. Bellone C. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22404-22409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, cyclin D-kinase activation is inhibited, whereas cyclin E-kinase activity is rescued. Therefore, this offers a unique opportunity to question the necessity of prior phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin D-dependent kinases by examining whether CDK2-cyclin E activity alone can phosphorylate and inactivate pRb. Here we show that expression of cyclin E recovers CDK2, but not CDK4 activation in LY294002-treated cells. Under these conditions, in which CDK2 can be activated without prior CDK4 activation, we report that the phosphorylation of pRb on Ser-795, the release of pRb from E2F response elements, the activation of E2F, and G1-S phase progression all occur normally. Furthermore, we report that the cyclin E-mediated rescue of E2F activity can be prevented by co-expression of CDK2(D145N) or RbΔCDK. Finally, we restore four CDK2 phosphorylation sites on RbΔCDK and show that expression of this construct, RbΔ+K2, does not block E2F activation or DNA synthesis. Taken together, these data indicate that, in IIC9 cells, prior phosphorylation of pRb by cyclin D-CDK4/6 is not necessary for the phosphorylation of pRb by cyclin E-CDK2 and the subsequent activation of E2F and entry into S phase of the cell cycle.

Briefly, after transfection and serum starvation cells were stimulated with 1 unit/ml α-thrombin for 8 h (for CDK4) or 17 h (for CDK2). Lysates (100 μg) were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibodies to cyclin D1 or polyclonal antibodies to CDK4 or CDK2, as indicated. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed for the ability to phosphorylate GST-Rb (for CDK4 or cyclin D1) or histone H1 (for CDK2) in vitro, and [32P]phosphate incorporation was quantified using a PhosphorImager™ (Molecular Dynamics). Data are presented as -fold activation over basal level. Western Blot Analysis—Asynchronously growing IIC9 cells or human HL60 cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in cold lysis buffer (52Weber J.D. Hu W. Jefcoat Jr., S.C.

Lysates were sonicated briefly, and insoluble material was pelleted by microcentrifugation at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 2 min. 40 μg of protein lysate was resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Boston, MA) as recommended by the manufacturer. Membranes were probed individually with polyclonal antibodies to CDK6, cyclin D1, cyclin D2, or cyclin D3 (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhancer chemiluminescence (ECL) detection (Amersham Biosciences) as recommended by the manufacturer. Growth-arrested IIC9 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 1 unit/ml α-thrombin for 19 h after pretreatment in the presence or absence of 10 μm LY294002 for 30 min.

Lysates were prepared for Western analysis as described and probed with polyclonal antibodies to phosphorylated Ser-780- or Ser 795-pRb (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) or cyclin A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Luciferase Reporter Assay—IIC9 cells were transiently transfected with 50 ng/ml pGL3-TATA-6xE2F-Luc, 200 ng/ml β-galactosidase, and 1.5–2.0 μg/ml cyclin E, CDK2(D145N), RbΔCDK, or RbΔ+K2 as indicated in figure legends. Basal cells were stimulated with 1 unit/ml α-thrombin where indicated either in the presence or absence of 30 min preincubation with 10 μm LY294002. Lysate protein was prepared for luciferase activity assay as recommended by manufacturer (Promega, Madison, WI), and 10 μl of room temperature lysate was mixed with 90 μl of room temperature luciferase assay buffer reagent (Promega) and placed in an OpticompII luminometer (MCM Instruments, Baltimore, MD). Light produced was measured and normalized to transfection efficiency by dividing relative light units by optical density units obtained from β-galactosidase activity. β-Galactosidase activity was measure as previously described (5Weber J.D.

Northern Blot Analysis—Quiescent IIC9 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 1 unit/ml α-thrombin for indicated lengths of time after preincubation in the presence or absence of 10 μm LY294002. At the indicated times total RNA was isolated using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA (20 μg) was resolved in a 2%(w/v) agarose-formaldehyde gel. After electrophoresis formaldehyde was removed from the gel by washing in 0.5% ammonium acetate. RNA was then transferred to a Hybond N+ nylon membrane. (Amersham Biosciences) using a Turboblotter™ system (Schleicher & Schuell) and cross-linked onto the membrane using an ultraviolet cross-linker (Amersham Biosciences) as recommended by the manufacturer. Randomly labeled [α-32P]dCTP cDNA probes were made using the Random Primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). Membranes were preincubated with rapid hybridization buffer (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 65 °C and then probed simultaneously with cyclin A and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probes for 2 h at 65 °C. After hybridization, the membrane was washed twice with 5× SSPE (20 mm EDTA, 1 m NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4/H2O) with 0.1%(w/v) SDS at room temperature and once with 1× SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. The membrane was developed using a PhosphorImager™. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—EMSA were slightly adapted from established method (12Chellappan S.P. Hiebert S. Mudryj M.

For nuclear fractionation IIC9 cells were quickly scraped in 3 ml/100-mm2 plate of ice-cold 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA (Buffer A). The cells were homogenized 20 times in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer and spun at 500 × g for 7 min. The nuclear pellet was suspended in Buffer A and homogenized 15 times in a Dounce homogenizer with a pestle, layered over 45% sucrose in Buffer A, and centrifuged at 1660 × g for 15 min. The nuclei were washed once and resuspended in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10% sucrose and sonicated to lyse the nuclei. Nuclear proteins (4 μg) were immunoprecipitated by incubating with 1 μg of anti-RB monoclonal antibody (Calbiochem). Immunoprecipitated proteins were recovered on protein G-Sepharose beads and dissociated by treatment with deoxycholate (12Chellappan S.P. Hiebert S. Mudryj M. Horowitz J.M. Nevins J.R.

EMSAs were performed as described previously using pRb immunoprecipitates and an end-radiolabeled double-stranded DNA fragment (1.5–2 × 105 cpm/assay) containing a single E2F consensus binding site derived from the dihydrofolate reductase promoter (sc-2507; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), termed E2FRE (12Chellappan S.P.

For competition studies the DNA binding assays also included 10 ng of unlabeled E2FRE, mutant E2FRE double-stranded oligonucleotide with a CG to AT substitution at the E2F binding motif (E2FREmut, sc-2508) as a nonspecific competitor. To identify proteins in complex with the E2F consensus site extracts were preincubated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies (0.5 μg each) to E2F1 (sc-193 X) and E2F4 (sc-1083 X) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology before EMSA. Thymidine Incorporation Assay—Performed as previously described (53Goel R. Phillips-Mason P.J. Raben D.M. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol.

Expression of Cyclin E Rescues CDK2, but Not CDK4 Activity in LY294002-treated cells—Phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase activity is essential for the accumulation of cyclin D protein and CDK4-cyclin D activity (54Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar). In most cell types, including IIC9 cells (3Philips-Mason P.J. Raben D.M. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18046-18053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), activation of CDK4-cyclin D in early G1 results in expression of cyclin E and the activation of CDK2-cyclin E in late G1. To determine whether ectopic expression of cyclin E rescues CDK2 activity in the absence of CDK4 activity we performed in vitro kinase assays with histone H or recombinant pRb, respectively, as the substrate (Fig. 1). As expected, the activity of CDK4 and CDK2 was negligible in quiescent cells, and α-thrombin stimulated a marked activation of both CDK4 (Fig. 1A) and CDK2 (Fig. 1B). However, pretreatment with LY294002 prevents the activation of both CDK4 and CDK2. These data are consistent with the prevailing notion that CDK4-cyclin D activity is essential for pRb phosphorylation and the subsequent expression of cyclin E and CDK2-cyclin E activation. Interestingly, ectopic expression of cyclin E rescues the α-thrombin-induced activation of CDK2 (Fig. 1B) but not CDK4 (Fig. 1A). Because IIC9 cells do not express CDK6 or cyclins D2 or D3 (Fig. 1C), these conditions represent a G1 cell in which CDK2 is activated without the prior activation of D-type CDK activity. In addition to providing an ideal system for studying the ability of CDK2-cyclin E alone to phosphorylate and inactivate pRb, these data argue that cyclin D-CDK4/6 activity is dispensable for CDK2 activity and G1 progression in the event of unscheduled cyclin E expression (Ref. 47Keenan S.M.

Glucocorticoids are an exception, and increase collagenase 3 mRNA and immunoreactive protease levels in osteoblasts by post-transcriptional mechanisms, leading to the stabilization of collagenase 3 mRNA (16Delany A.M.

This could play a role in the actions of these steroids on bone resorption. Regulation of gene expression by post-transcriptional mechanisms occurs in multiple cellular systems, and cytosolic protein-RNA interactions play an important role in the modulation of RNA stability (17Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regulatory elements in the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (UTR) of mRNAs frequently modulate mRNA stability. One well studied family of RNA stability motifs consists of adenosine-uridine regions (AUUUA) or AU-rich elements (ARE), and cytosolic extracts interacting with AREs are capable of stabilizing or destabilizing mRNA (18Anant S.

The collagenase 3 RNA contains multiple potential AREs that may regulate RNA stability, but the role of these ARE motifs and the factors that determine basal collagenase 3 RNA stability, or changes in stability following glucocorticoid exposure, are unknown. In the present study, we used RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay (REMSA) to identify elements present in the coding region, and 5′- and 3′-UTR of the collagenase 3 RNA forming cortisol-dependent complexes with cytosolic proteins from rat osteoblast-enriched cells (Ob cells). The identification of proteins forming complexes with RNA, and the characterization of RNA sequences responsible for the stabilization of collagenase 3 RNA were pursued. Cell Culture—The culture method used was described in detail previously (29McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. Canalis E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1988; 3: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Timed pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Cambridge, MA), and parietal bones were removed from 22-day fetal rats immediately after the mothers were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation. This project was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center. Cells were obtained by five sequential digestions of parietal bones, using bacterial collagenase (CLS II, Worthington Biochemical, Freehold, NJ). Cell populations harvested from the third to fifth digestions were cultured as a pool at a density of ∼10,000 cells/cm2 and have been shown previously to have osteoblastic characteristics (29McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. Canalis E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1988; 3: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen, Inc.) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Inc., Atlanta, GA). At confluence, cells were rinsed and transferred to serum-free medium for 24 h and then exposed to test or control medium in the absence of serum for 2–24 h. Cortisol and actinomycin D (both from Sigma Chemical Co.) were dissolved in absolute ethanol, and at dilutions < 1:10,000 an equal amount of ethanol was added to control cultures. 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) was dissolved in Me2SO at a concentration of 20 mg/ml, and diluted in culture medium 1:200. Except for protein purification studies, primary cultures of Ob cells were used in all experiments. For protein purification, Ob cells were grown to 75% confluence, trypsinized, and split 1:4, and grown to confluence. Plasmid, Clones, and in Vitro RNA Transcripts—To generate RNA probes for testing in REMSA, 13 plasmids were constructed containing 28–288 base pair (bp) sequences spanning the entire 2.6-kilobase (kb) rat collagenase 3 gene. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of a 2.6-kb collagenase gene template (a gift from C. Quinn, St. Louis, MO) was performed with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), in the presence of 5′- and 3′-collagenase specific primers, and the PCR products were subcloned into the cytomegalic virus (CMV) driven expression vector pcDNA3.1(–) (Invitrogen) (30Quinn C.O. Scott D.K. Brinckerhoff C.E. Matrisian L.M. Jeffrey J.J. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22342-22347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 200-bp murine osteonectin sequence, bp +981 to +1317 (a gift from B. Hogan, Nashville, TN), was similarly constructed (31Mason I.J. Taylor A. Williams J.G. Sage E.H. Hogan B.L.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1465-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). A c-fos triple ARE repeat RNA sequence was produced by annealing the single strand oligonucleotides 5′-CCGCTCGAGGATTTACGATTTTACGATTTTTACGAAGCTTGGG-3′ and 5′-CCCAAGCTTCGTAAAAATCGTAAAATCGTAAATCCTCGAGCGG-3′ to form double stranded DNA prior to subcloning into pcDNA3.1(–). Mutations in ARE sequences were generated by PCR using gene splicing by overlap extension method (32Horton R.M. PCR Protocols, Current Methods and Applications, Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1993: 251-261Google Scholar). The identity of each construct was verified by DNA sequencing prior to use. RNA templates were linearized with HindIII and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase and Maxiscript Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) in the presence of [32P]uridine 5′-triphosphate (UTP) (800 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer, Boston, MA) or unlabeled UTP to produce transcripts with a specific activity of 3.5 × 107 disintegrations per minute (dpm)/μg of RNA or unlabeled RNA to be used in competition reactions. The DNA template was removed with DNase I and unincorporated ribonucleotides removed by ethanol precipitation with 0.5 m ammonium acetate. Biotinylated RNA, used for RNA affinity purification, was generated by incubating unlabeled RNA transcripts with Photoprobe S-S Biotin (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) followed by extraction with 2-butyl alcohol (Malinkrodt, Paris, KY) and ethanol precipitation. Cytosolic Extracts—Confluent Ob cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (Sigma), scraped, and resuspended in HEPES-binding buffer, consisting of 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.1, 3 mm MgCl2,14mm KCl, 5% glycerol (all from Sigma), 1 mm dithiothreitol (Invitrogen), and the freshly added proteinase inhibitors: 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin (all from Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), and immediately frozen at –80 °C. Cell lysis was accomplished by 4 cycles of thawing at 37 °C for 5 min followed by snap-freezing in acetone on dry ice for 5 min. Cellular debris was cleared by centrifugation, and protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. RNA Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—RNA-cytosolic extract binding reactions were performed as described (33Leedman P.J. Stein A.R. Chin W.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 375-387PubMed Google Scholar, 34Liebold E.A. Munro H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2171-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). 20 μg of cytosolic extract were incubated with 5 × 105 dpm [32P]RNA sequence at 25 °C for 30 min in HEPES binding buffer followed by the addition of 1 unit of RNase T1 (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) and heparin (Sigma) at 5 mg/ml for 10 min each. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis (200 volts) on a 4% native acrylamide gel (acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio of 29:1; Sigma) at 4 °C, and radiolabeled complexes were detected by autoradiography on Kodak X-AR film (Kodak, Rochester, NY), and their relative intensity determined by densitometric analysis. In RNA competition assays, unlabeled, homologous or non-homologous RNA sequences were added in excess (300–500-fold) to the binding reactions prior to the addition of radiolabeled RNA probes. Supershift assays were performed by adding a 1:100 dilution of antibodies to far upstream element (FUSE)-binding protein-1 (a gift from D. Levens, Bethesda, MD), FUSE-binding protein 2 (a gift from D. Black, Los Angeles, CA), vinculin (Sigma), gelsolin, enolase, annexin I, and microtubule associated protein-2 (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies were added to the binding reactions simultaneously with the cytosolic extract and radiolabeled RNA sequences or immediately following the binding reaction with analogous results. To estimate the molecular mass (Mr) of cytosolic protein-RNA complexes, RNA-protein binding reactions were carried out using 40 μg of cytosolic extract and 10 × 105 dpm of [32P]RNA-labeled sequences. Following the binding reaction, samples were irradiated with UV light (2500 μJules) (CL-1000, UV Crosslinker, UVP, Inc., San Gabriel, CA) on ice for 15 min prior to incubation with 1 μg RNase A (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) at 37 °C for 15 min. Samples were boiled in SDS sample buffer and RNA-protein complexes resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 12% gels in Tris borate-EDTA buffer (Invitrogen). Gels were dried, exposed to Kodak X-AR film and analyzed by autoradiography. Benchmark molecular weight markers (Invitrogen) were used to estimate the Mr of the complex. Isolation and Identification of RNA-binding Proteins—S100 extracts were prepared from pooled Ob cell cytosolic extracts by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1.5 h (Sorvall Ultra 80; Perkin-Elmer) at 4 °C, and the supernatant stored at –80 °C. Further purification was carried out by ion-exchange and RNA affinity chromatography. For this purpose, the S100 supernatant was applied onto a bed of Accell Plus QMA ion-exchange resin (Waters Inc., Milford, MA), previously equilibrated with HEPES buffer. The flow-through and two additional HEPES buffer washes were pooled and mixed with 5 mg/ml heparin, 5 mm EDTA and 75 μg each of the S-S biotinylated collagenase RNA sequences +1733 to 1933 and +2133 to 2333 at 25 °C for 2 h. Vectrex avidin D (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) slurry was then added and mixed for 2 h at 25 °C (35Ruby S.W. Goelz S.E. Hostomsky Z. Abelson J.N. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 97-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The sample was centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min and the pellet washed and re-suspended in HEPES buffer containing 50 mm dithiothreitol and 500 mm NaCl, and incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. Samples were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant dialyzed in 3,500 molecular weight cut-off dialysis tubing (Spectrum Laboratories, Inc., Rancho Dominguez, CA) against 0.05 or 0.005 m acetic acid, at 4 °C, prior to sample lyophilization. Aliquots from each purification step were stored at –80 °C for subsequent determination of protein content and REMSA. Following the RNA affinity purification step, samples were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in non-denaturing gels followed by Coomassie Blue staining (Bio-Rad). Selected stained gel slices were excised and analyzed by liquid chromatography (LC) (Ultimate LC Packings, Inc., Amsterdam, The Netherlands), electrospray ion-trap mass spectrometry (LCQ Deca from Thermoquest Corp., San Jose, CA), and tandem mass spectrometry (National Center for Biotechnology Information) after in-gel trypsinolysis at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester Foundation Campus (Shrewsbury, MA). Transient Transfections and mRNA Turnover Studies—Transient transfection experiments were carried out with wild type c-fos and wild type and mutant c-fos collagenase chimeric constructs (Fig. 1). For this purpose, the 2.1-kb rat c-fos gene (a gift from T. Curran, Memphis, TN) was EcoRI-digested and subcloned into pcDNA 3.1(–) to create pCMVc-fos (36Curran T. Gordon M.B. Rubino K.L. Sambucetti L.C. Oncogene. 1987; 2: 79-84PubMed Google Scholar). The 1.27-kb 5′-UTR and coding region of c-fos was isolated from pCMVc-fos by restriction digestion and cloned into pcDNA3.1(–), creating pCMV5′+CRc-fos. The 1.2 kb collagenase 3′-UTR sequence was amplified by PCR using the rat collagenase 3 gene template and specific 5′- and 3′-primers; the PCR fragment was ligated to pCMV5′+CRc-fos, creating pCMVc-fos/collagenase 3′-UTR (pCMVc-fos/case 3′-UTR). Mutations in ARE sequences were generated by PCR using gene splicing by overlap extension method, to create pCMVc-fos/case Δ 3′-UTR (32Horton R.M. PCR Protocols, Current Methods and Applications, Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1993: 251-261Google Scholar). The identity of the constructs was verified by DNA sequencing prior to use. Cells were grown to ∼75% confluence and transiently transfected with pCMVc-fos, and pCMVc-fos/case 3′-UTR, wild type and mutants, by calcium phosphate/DNA co-precipitation for 24 h, followed by glycerol shock as described, and allowed to recover in 10% fetal bovine serum for 48 h (16Delany A.M. Jeffrey J.J. Rydziel S. Canalis E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26607-26612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Cells were washed, serum-deprived, and exposed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or 1 μm cortisol for 4 h prior to the addition of 10 μg/ml actinomycin D (Sigma) to arrest transcription. In experiments where mRNA decay was followed longer than 3 h, actinomycin D was pulsed immediately after the 3 h time point to obtain an additional 10 μg/ml concentration. At selected times, cells were removed and total RNA was extracted with an RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and subjected to reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis for the detection of c-fos transcripts. For this purpose, 1 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed in the presence of bovine growth hormone reverse sequence primer (5′-TAGAAGGCACAGTCGAGG-3′) corresponding to a polyadenylation sequence present in the pcDNA3.1(–), and 1 unit of RNasin (Promega, Madison, WI), with 1.0 μl of murine Moloney leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). An aliquot was PCR amplified in the presence of forward primers 5′-CAATTTATTTATTAAGATGGATTC-3′ of c-fos sequence, for pCMVc-fos, or 5′-CTTAGTGACTGACACTTGG-3′ of collagenase sequence, for pCMVc-fos/case, and 2.5 μCi of [32P]deoxycytidine 5′-triphosphate (dCTP) (PerkinElmer), with 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) at 94 °C denaturing, 58 °C annealing, and 72 °C extension temperatures for 26 or 28 cycles respectively. PCR products, 305 bp for c-fos, and 139 bp for c-fos/case 3′-UTR, wild type and mutant, were separated on denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen), dried, exposed to Kodak X-AR film, and visualized by autoradiography. RNA Interference (RNAi) and mRNA Turnover—To downregulate vinculin and FUSE-binding protein 2, 21-mer double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) homologous in sequence to FUSE-binding protein 2 bp 289–310 or vinculin bp 1766–1787 or scrambled 21 bp non-mammalian gene sequence were transcribed in vitro using a silencer siRNA construction kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Ambion) (37Sharp P.A. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 38Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8141) Google Scholar). Briefly, sense and antisense siRNA oligonucleotide templates containing T7 promoter primer sequence at their 3′-ends, were individually hybridized to a T7 promoter primer and extended using Exo-Klenow DNA polymerase. The sense and antisense dsDNA templates formed were combined, and RNA was transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase at 37 °C for 24 h. The 5′ overhanging leader sequences were removed from the dsRNA product by a single-strand specific ribonuclease, and the DNA template was destroyed by DNase digestion. The resulting siRNAs were purified, quantitated by measuring their absorbance at 260 nm and stored at –20 °C. The ability of dsRNA to downregulate FUSE-binding protein 2 and vinculin transcripts was tested by culturing Ob cells to ∼75% confluence in the presence of 10% FBS. Cells were rinsed with phosphate buffered saline and transfected in Optimem (Invitrogen) with FUSE-binding protein 2, vinculin or scrambled dsRNA sequences, all at 75 nm, using gene silencer siRNA transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, Inc., San Diego, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and cultured for an additional 48 h period. Total RNA was extracted and processed for Northern blot analysis using a 922-bp human FUSE-binding protein 2 cDNA (a gift from D. Black) or a 1389 bp mouse vinculin cDNA (a gift from E. Adamson, La Jolla, CA). To determine the impact of FUSE-binding protein 2 and vinculin gene silencing on collagenase mRNA stability, cells were grown to ∼75% confluence and transiently transfected for 48 h with 75 nm FUSE-binding protein 2, and 75 nm vinculin, or 150 nm scrambled dsRNA sequences, as described. Cells were washed, serum-deprived, exposed to DRB to arrest transcription, and at selected times, total RNA was extracted and subjected to Northern blot analysis using a 2.6-kb rat collagenase 3 cDNA. Statistical Analysis—Slopes of RNA decay experiments were analyzed by the method of Sokal and Rohlf (39Sokal R.R. Rohlf F.J. Biometry. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman, San Francisco, CA1981Google Scholar). Examination of the collagenase 3 gene reveals a 28-nucleotide 5′-UTR, a 1.42-kb protein coding region, and a 1.2-kb 3′-UTR (30Quinn C.O. Scott D.K. Brinckerhoff C.E. Matrisian L.M. Jeffrey J.J. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22342-22347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Its 3′-UTR contains seven ATTT(T,T)A and the coding region contains two ATTT(T)A sequences, AREs in the RNA that may bind cytosolic proteins and modulate mRNA stability (17Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Malter J.S. Hong Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3167-3171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Gillis P. Malter J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3172-3177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine which segments of the collagenase 3 RNA could bind Ob cytosolic proteins, 28–288-bp radiolabeled RNA sequences spanning the entire collagenase 3 RNA were incubated with cytosolic lysates prepared from Ob cells cultured in the presence or absence of 1 μm cortisol, and resolved on 4% native polyacrylamide gels. RNA sequences from the 5′-UTR failed to form RNA-protein complexes, and sequences from the coding region formed complexes, but their intensity was not different in cell extracts from control or cortisol-treated cultures (data not shown). Cytosolic extracts from Ob cells formed complexes with three RNA segments present in the collagenase 3′-UTR and containing 2 AREs each (Fig. 2). There was a 2–4-fold increase in the intensity of the complex when extracts from cortisol-treated cells were incubated with +1733 to 1933 and +2133 to 2333 radiolabeled 3′-UTR RNA sequences, and a slight increase when extracts were incubated with +1933 to 2133 3′-UTR RNA sequences. There was no cortisol-dependent complex formation when extracts were incubated with a +1445–1733 segment containing 1 ARE, or with a +2333–2595 segment containing no AREs. Mutations of ARE sequences present in the +1733–1933, +1933–2133, and +2133–2333 3′-UTR regions resulted in a decrease in the intensity of the cytosolic protein-RNA complex from control and cortisol-treated cells, indicating that these elements are important in the formation of the complex (Fig. 2). To confirm the specificity of the binding reaction, competition assays were performed. Incubation of the cytosolic extract with 500-fold excess unlabeled homologous sequence completely prevented the formation of the radiolabeled RNA-protein complex (Fig. 3, left and middle panels). To confirm the protein nature of the cytosolic component binding to the collagenase 3 RNA, cytosolic extracts were incubated with 32P-labeled +1733–1933 RNA sequences and treated with proteinase K prior to electrophoresis. This prevented the visualization of the RNA-cytosolic extr"
https://openalex.org/W2006812263,"It has been proposed that the DNA repair protein O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase increases the mutagenicity of 1,2-dibromoethane by reacting with it at its cysteine acceptor site to form a highly reactive half-mustard, which can then react with DNA (Liu, L., Pegg, A. E., Williams, K. M., and Guengerich, F. P. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 37920-37928). Incubation of Escherichia coli-expressed human alkyltransferase with 1,2-dibromoethane and single-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides led to the formation of covalent transferaseoligo complexes. The order of reaction determined was Gua>Thy>Cyt>Ade. Mass spectrometry analysis of the tryptic digest of the reaction product indicated that some of the adducts led to depurination with the release of the Gly136-Arg147 peptide cross-linked to a Gua at the N7 position, with the site of reaction being the active site Cys145 as established by chromatographic retention time and the fragmentation pattern determined by tandem mass spectrometry of a synthetic peptide adduct. The alkyltransferase-mediated mutations produced by 1,2-dibromoethane were predominantly Gua to Ade transitions but, in the spectrum of such rifampicin-resistant mutations in the RpoB gene, 20% were Gua to Thy transversions. The latter are likely to have arisen from the apurinic site generated from the Gua-N7 adduct. Support exists for an additional adduct/mutagenic pathway because evidence was obtained for DNA adducts other than at the Gua N7 atom and for mutations other than those attributable to depurination. Thus, chemical and biological evidence supports the existence of at least two alkyltransferase-dependent pathways for 1,2-dibromoethane-induced mutagenicity, one involving Gua N7-alkylation by alkyltransferase-S-CH2CH2Br and depurination, plus another as yet uncharacterized system(s). It has been proposed that the DNA repair protein O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase increases the mutagenicity of 1,2-dibromoethane by reacting with it at its cysteine acceptor site to form a highly reactive half-mustard, which can then react with DNA (Liu, L., Pegg, A. E., Williams, K. M., and Guengerich, F. P. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 37920-37928). Incubation of Escherichia coli-expressed human alkyltransferase with 1,2-dibromoethane and single-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides led to the formation of covalent transferaseoligo complexes. The order of reaction determined was Gua>Thy>Cyt>Ade. Mass spectrometry analysis of the tryptic digest of the reaction product indicated that some of the adducts led to depurination with the release of the Gly136-Arg147 peptide cross-linked to a Gua at the N7 position, with the site of reaction being the active site Cys145 as established by chromatographic retention time and the fragmentation pattern determined by tandem mass spectrometry of a synthetic peptide adduct. The alkyltransferase-mediated mutations produced by 1,2-dibromoethane were predominantly Gua to Ade transitions but, in the spectrum of such rifampicin-resistant mutations in the RpoB gene, 20% were Gua to Thy transversions. The latter are likely to have arisen from the apurinic site generated from the Gua-N7 adduct. Support exists for an additional adduct/mutagenic pathway because evidence was obtained for DNA adducts other than at the Gua N7 atom and for mutations other than those attributable to depurination. Thus, chemical and biological evidence supports the existence of at least two alkyltransferase-dependent pathways for 1,2-dibromoethane-induced mutagenicity, one involving Gua N7-alkylation by alkyltransferase-S-CH2CH2Br and depurination, plus another as yet uncharacterized system(s).

AGT repairs O6-alkylguanine adducts that are of major importance in initiating mutations and cytotoxicity. This repair process is mediated by transfer of the alkyl group from the O6 atom of Gua to the active site Cys residue in the AGT protein. AGT is inactivated by the alkyl group transfer, and therefore additional repair requires new protein synthesis. Although an early study reported that the mutagenicity of 1,2-dibromoethane (DBE) was not affected by enzymes that repair alkylation lesions (4Foster P.L. Wilkinson W.G. Miller J.K. Sullivan A.D. Barnes W.M. Mutation Res. 1988; 194: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), there is now convincing data that AGT paradoxically promotes the toxicity of DBE (5Abril N. Luque-Romero L.

Recently, we have shown that this toxicity is due to the interaction of DBE with the Cys acceptor site of AGT (Cys145 in hAGT) (11Liu L. Pegg A.E. Williams K.M. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37920-37928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This Cys145 residue is present in the hAGT protein as part of an extensive hydrogen-bonding network involving a water molecule and His146, Arg147, and Glu172 (12Daniels, D. S., Mol, C. D., Arval, A. S., Kanugula, S., Pegg, A. E., and Tainer, J. A. (2000) 1719, 19, 1719-1730Google Scholar). This environment causes Cys145 to have a high reactivity with model electrophiles unrelated to alkylated DNA substrates and a very low pKa (13Guengerich F.P. Fang Q. Liu L. Hachey D.L. Pegg A.E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10965-10970Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It therefore reacts readily with DBE to generate a reactive intermediate, S-(2-bromoethyl)-Cys145-hAGT (11Liu L. Pegg A.E. Williams K.M. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37920-37928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This half-mustard intermediate is likely to cyclize forming an episulfonium ion that can react to form a covalent AGT-DNA adduct. Formation of DNA adducts is facilitated by the DNA binding properties of AGT. DBE was used widely in gasoline as an anti-knock ingredient, as well as in pesticides and soil fumigants. Its use was drastically reduced due to reports of its toxicity. DBE is carcinogenic in rats, and toxic and mutagenic in microorganisms, plants, insects and humans (14Olson W.A. Habermann R.T.

Assoc. 1984; 252: 2428-2431Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Earlier studies with DBE have indicated that toxicity can be caused by metabolites formed via microsomal metabolism (17van Bladeren P.J. Breimer D.D. Rotteveel-Smijs G.M.T. Mohn G.R. Mutation Res. 1980; 74: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and by the action of glutathione S-transferase (GST) (18van Bladeren P.J. Breimer D.D. Rotteveel-Smijs G.M.T. de Jong R.A.W.

Toxicol. 2001; 14: 1107-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The latter reaction generates S-(2-bromoethyl)glutathione, which undergoes a non-enzymatic dehalogenation and forms an episulfonium ion. This ion then reacts rapidly with cellular nucleophiles such as DNA (21Peterson L.A. Harris T.M. Guengerich F.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 3284-3291Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The structures and mutagenic effects of major DBE-DNA adducts formed in this way have been studied extensively (19Ozawa N. Guengerich F.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5266-5270Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 22Humphreys W.G. Kim D.-H. Cmarik J.L. Shimada T. Guengerich F.P.

Of these, S-[2-(N7-guanyl)ethyl]glutathione accounts for up to 95% of total DNA adducts (24Koga N. Inskeep P.B. Harris T.M. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2192-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and its formation produces G:C to A:T transition mutations (25Cmarik J.L. Humphreys W.G. Bruner K.L. Lloyd R.S. Tibbetts C. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6672-6679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GST was shown to enhance DBE genotoxicity in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and TA1535, where mutations at specific guanines are needed to produce reversions (22Humphreys W.G. Kim D.-H.

The extent to which the various pathways for activation of DBE (activation by microsomes, by GST or by AGT) contribute to its genotoxicity are not yet clear. While previous studies provide a plausible model for the hAGT-mediated mechanism of DBE toxicity, there has been no direct evidence for the formation of hAGT-DNA adducts in vivo, structural characterization of hAGT-DNA adducts, or investigations of the types of mutations caused by these adducts. In the work described in this study, we describe evidence that AGT-DNA covalent cross-links are formed in cells, compare the reactivity of hAGT-DBE intermediates with different DNA bases, identify the mutations produced by DBE in cells lacking and expressing AGT, and characterize one of the hAGT-DNA adducts. Our results show that the predominant reaction is with Gua and that, in the presence of AGT, DBE treatment leads to a large increase in the frequency of G:C to A:T transitions and G:C to T:A transversions in E. coli. This evidence supports the involvement of both depurination and alternate mechanisms (e.g. error-prone DNA synthesis across sites) with hAGT adducts. Materials—DBE, dimethylsulfate (DMS), piperidine, porcine spleen DNase II, white potato acid phosphatase II, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), dithiothreitol (DTT), and bovine intestinal mucosal alkaline phosphatase were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. Adenosine 5′-[γ-35S]thiotriphosphate (triethyl ammonium salt) ([γ-35S]ATPγS) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. DNase I was purchased from Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN. The Phototope™-HRP Detection Kit for immunoblot analysis was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). T4 polynucleotide kinase was obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The peptide GNPVPILIPCHR (which corresponds to positions 136-147 of hAGT and is abbreviated as peptide Gly136-Arg147) was obtained (HPLC-purified) from SynPep (Dublin, CA). Recombinant C-terminal histidine-tagged wild-type hAGT was purified by Co2+-affinity chromatography using a BioCad Sprint Perfusion system (PerSeptive Biosystems) as described previously (28Liu L. Xu-Welliver M. Kanugula S. Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3037-3043PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli TRG8 cells transformed with pIN-hAGT or an empty pIN vector (29Xu-Welliver M. Kanugula S. Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1936-1945PubMed Google Scholar) were grown at 37 °C under the selection of 50 μg/ml ampicillin and kanamycin (11Liu L. Pegg A.E. Williams K.M. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37920-37928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) unless otherwise specified. Most oligodeoxyribonucleotides (oligos) used in this study were synthesized by Invitrogen. The complementary 16-mer oligonucleotides 5′-d(TGCGTGAAGTGAGTGA)-3′and 5′-d(TCACTCACTTCACGCA)-3′ used for MS analysis were purchased from Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX) (GF grade, identity, and purity confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS). These oligonucleotides were dissolved in H2O; equal concentrations of each were mixed, heated to 90 °C, and then allowed to cool to room temperature (4 h time) to form a double-stranded oligomer for cross-linking studies. Analysis of DBE-dependent AGT Binding to DNA in Vitro—Oligodeoxyribonucleotide 16-mers 5′-d(C)16-3′, 5′-d(TG)8-3′, or 5′-d(AG)8-3′ were labeled with [γ-35S]ATPγS at the 5′-end as described previously (11Liu L. Pegg A.E. Williams K.M. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37920-37928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled oligonucleotides (6.5 pmol) were incubated with various unlabeled oligonucleotides (0-1000 pmol) for 60 min at 37 °C. The 15 μl reaction mixtures also contained 20 mm DBE and wild-type hAGT (2 μg) in AGT buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.6) and 0.1 mm EDTA). Reactions were terminated via the addition of 40 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 100 mm DTT, 2% SDS (w/v), 0.1% bromphenol blue (w/v) and 10% glycerol (v/v). The mixtures were then separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS-PAGE) using 12.5% gels and analyzed using a PhosphorImager SI system. The oligonucleotide bands were quantified using ImageQuant software (11Liu L. Pegg A.E. Williams K.M. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37920-37928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The percentage of oligonucleotide in the lower mobility hAGT-oligonucleotide complex forms was determined from these measurements and plotted against the concentrations of unlabeled oligonucleotides used in the reaction. Oligonucleotide 16-mers 5′-d(TGCGTG*AAGGAGTGA)-3′ including a Gua or an O6-methylguanine at the G* position were 5′-end labeled using [γ-35S]ATPγS. Mixtures of 6.5 pmol of [35S]-labeled and 20 pmol of unlabeled oligonucleotides were added at 0-70 min to a mixture of 2 μg of hAGT protein and 20 mm DBE. After the addition of oligonucleotides, the incubation was allowed to proceed for another 60 min. Reaction mixtures were then separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed using the PhosphorImager SI system. Piperidine Cleavage Studies—The hAGT protein (8 μg) was incubated with 100 pmol of 35S-labeled 16-mer oligonucleotide 5′-d(C)7G(C)8-3′ or 5′-d(T)16-3′ in the presence or absence of 20 mm DBE or 1 mm DMS in AGT buffer. The 20-μl incubation mixture was prepared in duplicate and the reactions were allowed to proceed for 1 h at 37 °C. Piperidine (1 m) was then added to one set of the reaction mixtures, and these samples were heated at 90 °C for 10 min. Aliquots of sample buffer (5 μl) containing 0.25% bromphenol blue (w/v) and 40% (w/v) sucrose were then added to all samples. The mixtures were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0 (TAE-PAGE) using 20% gels. Gels were vacuum-dried and analyzed using a PhosphorImager SI system. Identification of DBE-mediated Formation of Covalent DNA-AGT Complexes—E. coli TRG8 cells transformed with an empty pIN vector or wild-type pIN-hAGT were grown in 40 ml of LB at 37 °C to an OD600 of 0.5. The expression of the hAGT protein was induced using 0.2 mm IPTG. After a 1-h induction period, cells were exposed to concentrations of 0.035 or 0.2 mm DBE or vehicle (dimethylsufoxide (Me2SO)) for 90 min under constant shaking. Cells were collected by centrifugation and washed with 20 ml of 1× M9 salt solution (90 mm Na2HPO4, 25 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm NaCl, and 20 mm NH4Cl). The cell pellets were stored at -80 °C until analysis. Genomic DNA from TRG8 cells was prepared using a Qiagen blood and cell culture DNA Maxi kit (Valencia, CA). The manufacturer's protocol for genomic DNA prepared from Gram-negative bacteria was adapted with minor modifications. Heat-inactivated RNase and lysozyme were added to buffer B1 to lyse the cells. Protease K was excluded to preserve the full-length hAGT protein, and NaCl (250 mm) was added to buffers B1 and B2 to reduce the noncovalent binding of proteins to DNA. E. coli genomic DNA was precipitated from the QF (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) elution solution using a mixture (v/v) of 70% isopropyl alcohol and 30% 0.4 m NaCl, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min. The DNA was dissolved in 100-300 μl of deionized water by rotation-mixing at room temperature overnight. Aliquots of E. coli genomic DNA (4 μg) were partially digested with DNase I (0.4 unit/μg DNA) at 37 °C for 30 min. The mixtures were resolved by electrophoresis using 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The presence of hAGT protein was determined using a specific monoclonal antibody (Clone MT 3.1; Lab Vision Corp., Fremont, CA) and visualized using the Phototope™-HRP Detection Kit. Analysis of Mutants Induced by DBE in the hisG Gene of S. typhimurium and the lacI Gene of E. coli—For studies of S. typhimurium, the strain YG7108 (derivative of TA1535, lacking both endogenous AGT genes (30Yamada M. Sedgwick B. Sofuni T. Nohmi T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1511-1519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) was transformed with pIN and pIN-AGT vectors. For studies in E. coli, strain TRG8 (8Liu H. Xu-Welliver M. Pegg A.E. Mutation Res. 2000; 452: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) was transformed with pIBA2-AGT (which produces active AGT) or pIBA2-C145A, which produces an inactive mutant. These plasmids were constructed by PCR amplification from pIN-AGT and pIN-C145A plasmids (31Crone T.M. Goodtzova K. Pegg A.E. Mutation Res. 1996; 363: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) using the upper primer 5′-GCACTGACCGTCTAGATTAAAGAGGAGAAAGG-3′, which introduces a XbaI restriction site just upstream of the ribosome binding site and restores the open reading frame of AGT, containing 5 extra amino acid residues in pIN-AGT, to its wild-type condition, and the lower primer 5′-GTTGCGCAGAAGCTTCCACTCAGTTTCG-3′, which changes a BamHI site to a HindIII site downstream of the stop codon. The amplification reaction generated 680 bp DNA fragments that were cut with XbaI and HindIII. The restricted fragments were ligated to a pASK-IBA2 vector (IBA GmbH, Germany) previously cut with the same enzymes, to produce pIBA2-AGT and pIBA2-C145A. The measurement of cell survival and mutation was according to the protocol described by Liu et al. (8Liu H. Xu-Welliver M. Pegg A.E. Mutation Res. 2000; 452: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) with minor modifications: for TRG8/pIBA2-AGT transformants, anhydrotetracycline (100 ng/ml) was employed for induction of AGT expression. Aliquots of the cell cultures (0.5 ml) were exposed to various concentrations of DBE (0.035-1.2 mm)orto the solvent Me2SO for 30-90 min at 37 °C. For cell survival estimation, the cells were washed with 1× M9 salts, diluted 102 to 105 fold, and plated on a non-restrictive medium (M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.2% glucose (w/v), 50 μg/ml each ampicillin and kanamycin, 40 μg/ml histidine) (32Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 440Google Scholar) and incubated for 2-3 days at 37 °C. The percentage survival was quantified by the number of colonies of bacteria exposed to DBE over that of untreated bacteria. For mutant isolation, after DBE treatment, undiluted cells were plated on M9 minimal medium plates (32Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 440Google Scholar) containing 0.7 mg/ml phenyl-β-d-galactoside as the sole carbon source for selection of mutants that synthesize β-galactosidase constitutively (lacI- or lacOc) or Vogel-Bonner minimal medium (33Vogel H.J. Bonner D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 218: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with excess biotin and trace amounts of l-histidine for isolation of S. typhimurium hisG+ revertants (34Mortelmans K. Zeiger E. Mutation Res. 2000; 455: 29-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 3 days, and the number of colonies on the plates was determined. The mutation frequency was calculated by the number of colonies grown on the selective media over 108 survivors grown on the glucose-containing plates. The colonies that grew on selective plates were purified by streaking on Petri dishes containing the same selective agent. These bacterial colonies were used in a PCR amplification reaction using the cells directly instead of purified DNA as a template. After incubation for 10 min at 95 °C to break the cells and release template DNA, Pfu ultra DNA polymerase was added, and amplification carried out with primers 5′-TGAATGTGAAACCAGTAACG-3′ and 5′-GCTCACTGCCCGCTTTCCA-3′ for the analysis of E. coli lacI gene and 5′-GTTAGACAACACCCGCTTACGC-3′ and 5′-GGAGGTGCGGATATGAGGTAGC-3′ for the S. typhimurium hisG gene. The amplification products were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and both strands sequenced using the same primers employed for amplification in separate reactions at the Vanderbilt Core DNA Sequencing Facility, Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Analysis of Rifampicin-resistant Mutants Induced by DBE—TRG8 cells were grown in 50 ml of LB media containing 0.2 mm IPTG to an OD600 of 0.5. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 2 ml of M9 salts. Aliquots of cells (0.5 ml) were then exposed to various concentrations of DBE (0.035-0.1 mm) or to the solvent Me2SO at 37 °C for 90 min. The cells were washed with M9 salts and resuspended in 0.5 ml of the same solution. In order to derive rpoB gene mutants, cells were plated on LB media plates supplemented with 100 μg/ml rifampicin. Undiluted cell suspensions (100 μl) were plated either immediately after the treatment or following an additional overnight culture in LB media at 37 °C. The cells were grown in a 37 °C incubator for ∼36 h until discrete colonies appeared. In addition, the overnight cultures were diluted 1:1.2 × 107-fold and plated onto LB plates lacking rifampicin to determine the number of viable cells. For cells plated immediately after treatment, a 1:104-106 fold dilution was utilized. The mutation frequency of the rpoB gene in TRG8 cells was expressed as the number of rpoB mutants per 108 survivors. Rifampicin-resistant cell clones from rifampicin-containing plates were suspended in 100 μl of deionized water. Aliquots (2-5 μl) of these suspensions were used as DNA templates in PCR. A section of the rpoB gene was amplified by PCR using 5′-TGGCCTGGTACGTTGAGAG3′ (forward primer) and 5′-AACCAGCGGCTTTACAGC-3′ (reverse primer). The setting for the thermocycler were: 92 °C for 4 min, 35 cycles of 92 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s; 72 °C for 5 min. Sequences of the PCR products were examined by DNA sequencing using the reverse primer carried out at the Macromolecular Core Facility of the Milton Hershey Medical Center, Pennsylvania State University. MALDI-TOF Analysis of DBE-mediated AGT-DNA Adducts—A solution of calf thymus DNA (1 mg/ml) was sonicated using 6 pulses of 10 s each. DNA (45 μgin100 μl of diisopropylethylamine buffer, pH 6.7) was incubated with 300 μg of hAGT and 20 mm DBE (from a 500 mm stock in CH3CN) at 37 °C for 1 h and then digested with trypsin (25 μg) at 37 °C overnight. MALDI-TOF spectra were recorded on a Perseptives Voyager Elite instrument (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA) in the positive reflector mode. The accelerating voltage, grid voltage, and guide wire voltages were 20,000, 74.5%, and 0.05%, respectively. A 10 mg ml-1 solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 60:40 CH3CN:2% aqueous CF3CO2H (v/v) was used as the matrix. Samples used for MALDI analysis were diluted in 0.10% CF3CO2H (v/v) and then desalted with ZipTipC18 pipette tips (Millipore, Milford, MA). Bradykinin and β-endorphin were used as external standards to calibrate the mass spectrometer. Modification of Peptide Gly136-Arg147—The synthetic peptide was reacted with DBE and dGuo to generate modifications of the peptide with -CH2CH2-dGuo and -CH2CH2-(N7)Gua at Cys145 of the peptide, for use as standards for analyzing the tryptic peptides derived from hAGT/DBE/DNA reactions. The peptide (380 nmol, in 0.5 ml of 0.10 m NaHCO3 buffer, pH 8.7) was mixed with dGuo and DBE (10 mm each) and allowed to react at 37 °C for 3 h. Potassium phosphate buffer (100 μlofa1.0 m solution, pH 6.0) was added (final pH 7.0). One reaction was heated at 95-100 °C for 60 min to cleavage the glycosidic bond of any guanyl-N7 adduct. Another sample was analyzed directly for adducts containing dGuo. HPLC/MS was performed using an Agilent 1100A system (Agilent) with a Phenomenex Jupiter octadecylsilane (C18) column (5 μm, 300 Å, 1.0 × 150 mm) (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). The solvents used were A: CH3CN:H2O:HCO2H:CF3CO2H/5-95-0.4-0.05, v-v-v-v and B: CH3CN: H2O:HCO2H:CF3CO2H/95-5-0.4-0.05, v-v-v-v, with the following schedule: 0-2 min, 95% A, 5% B; 2-20 min, 5-70% B, 20-25 min, 70-100% B, with a flow rate of 100 μl min-1. Electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was done with a Finnigan Deca XP+ instrument (Finnigan-MAT, San Jose, CA) and the following conditions: ESI voltage: 4.5 kV; N2 sheath, 30 psi; N2 auxiliary 5; scan time (full scan): 2 s/scan; selected reaction monitoring (SRM): 0.5 s/cycle; tandem MS: 35% relative energy, 3 microscans, ion accumulation time 200 ms. For the peptide-CH2CH2-Gua adduct the [M+2H]2+ ion was monitored at m/z 746.9, and the product ions were m/z 1125.6 (y81+) and 689.2 (y41+). The analysis indicated that the peptide-CH2CH2-Gua product eluted at tR 9.63 min and the peptide-CH2CH2-dGuo product eluted shortly thereafter at tR 9.9 min (separate runs), with the appropriate MH+ ions. The apparent yields (as judged by total ion current) were low (<10%); the most abundant products were peptide(s) cross-linked by Cys dimers (cystine) and by ethylene links. Collision-induced dissociation (CID) of the suspected ions yielded the appropriate b and y fragmentation patterns (see Fig. 5 and Supplementary Data). Cross-linking of hAGT and Double-stranded Oligomer for MS Analysis of Depurinated Products—hAGT (10 nmol, in 0.40-ml total volume) was incubated with 23 nmol of double-stranded 16-mer oligonucleotide (from Midland, see above) and 20 mm DBE at 37 °C for 60 min. The solution was dialyzed at 4 °C over a 3-day period versus 100 volumes of 80 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0) to remove residual DBE (3 changes). The hAGT precipitated and was recovered by centrifugation (103 × g, 5 min). The pellet was suspended in 200 μl of 0.10 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.6) containing 0.9% SDS (w/v) and heated at 90-95 °C for 60 min, to depurinate DNA adducts. A 100-μl aliquot (1/2) was diluted to a volume of 2.0 ml in 0.10 m NaHCO3 (pH 8.0), bringing the SDS concentration to 0.045% (w/v). Trypsin was added at a 1:10 ratio (trypsin: hAGT) by weight and incubated at 37 °C for 14 h, followed by another additio"
https://openalex.org/W2062175667,"Amplification of the MYCN gene, resulting in overexpression of MYCN, distinguishes a subset of neuroblastomas with poor prognosis. We recently identified MYCN as a target gene of the E2F transcription factors. Here we show that Sp1 and Sp3 cooperate with E2F-1 to activate the MYCN promoter. However, in a neuroblastoma cell line that does not express MYCN, overexpression of E2F-1 was not sufficient to activate the MYCN promoter even in the presence of trichostatin A and 5-aza-cytidine. This was because of a failure of E2F-1 to bind to the MYCN promoter in these cells, although access of E2F-1 to the inactive MYCN promoter was not blocked by a nucleosome. Differences in nucleosomal organization of the MYCN promoter in different cell lines did not correlate with gene activation per se but with the switch from basal to activated transcription. Binding of E2F and Sp1/Sp3 to the MYCN promoter in vivo correlated with acetylation of histones H3 and H4 and recruitment of RNA polymerase II and the protein acetyltransferase Tip60 but not with nucleosome remodeling. Our results define distinct chromatin states of the MYCN promoter, indicate that factors in addition to E2F and Sp1/Sp3 are required to activate MYCN in neuroblastomas, and provide evidence for a novel mechanism of controlling access of E2F to selected target genes.

The transcription factors encoded by the MYC genes control diverse tumorigenesis-relevant processes such as cell-cycle progression, growth factor dependence, and response to anti-mitogenic signals (for a review, see Refs. 1Grandori C.

Acta. 2002; 1602: 61-71PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of one of the MYC genes as a result of chromosomal translocation, gene amplification, or loss of negative transcriptional control plays a prominent role in the etiology of many types of tumors (for a review, see Refs. 3Eisenman R.N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2023-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar and 4Henriksson M. Luscher B. Adv. Cancer Res. 1996; 68: 109-182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MYCN gene is found amplified in several tumors of mostly neuroendocrine origin including about 25% of neuroblastomas, the most common solid tumor in childhood (for a review, see Refs. 5Brodeur G.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1696) Google Scholar and 6Savelyeva L. Schwab M. Cancer Lett. 2001; 167: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Whereas many neuroblastomas regress spontaneously or can be cured with minimal therapy, MYCN-amplified tumors have a poor prognosis. The treatment of these patients has not improved significantly in the course of the last two decades. Recently, the comparison of the gene expression profiles of MYCN-expressing versus non-expressing neuroblastoma cells as well as MYCN-amplified versus non-amplified primary tumors have begun to address the functional consequences of the massive overexpression of MYCN resulting from gene amplification (7Berwanger B.

Several mouse models of Myc-induced tumorigenesis suggest that Myc is not only required for the initiation but also for the maintenance of the tumorigenic state supporting the value of the MYC genes as targets of tumor therapy (9Felsher D.W.

In transcriptional regulation, enzymes are involved mainly as components of signal transduction cascades that relay information to the promoter and as transcriptional co-regulators that modulate local chromatin structure either by covalent modification of histones or by an ATPase-dependent remodeling of nucleosomes (for a review, see Ref. 12Narlikar G.J. Fan H.Y. Kingston R.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). The efficacy of histone deacetylase inhibitors against leukemia has proven the principle of treating cancer by the selective pharmacological modulation of the transcription machinery (13Redner R.L. Wang J. Liu J.M. Blood. 1999; 94: 417-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Application of this concept to the MYCN gene requires a detailed knowledge of the molecular basis of the transcriptional activation of MYCN in neuroblastomas. Toward this goal, we have recently identified the activating members of the E2F family of transcription factors (E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3) as regulators of MYCN expression in neuroblastomas (14Strieder V. Lutz W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2983-2989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). E2F proteins are important regulators of cell-cycle progression, and their activity is negatively controlled by the p16/Rb pathway, which is inactivated in the majority of human cancers (for a review, see Refs. 15Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Nat. Cell. Bio. 2000; 2: E65-E67Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar and 16Trimarchi J.M. Lees J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). Although genetic defects of the p16/Rb pathway are rare in neuroblastomas, there is some evidence for a loss of normal control of E2F activity in neuroblastomas by epigenetic means (17Takita J. Hayashi Y. Nakajima T. Adachi J. Tanaka T. Yamaguchi N. Ogawa Y. Hanada R. Yamamoto K. Yokota J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3137-3143Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition to E2F binding sites, the MYCN promoter contains several putative binding sites for Sp1 and related zinc finger transcription factors (18Strieder V. Lutz W. Cancer Lett. 2002; 180: 107-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). One of these, a non-consensus binding site, the CT-box, was previously implicated in MYCN regulation based upon in vivo footprinting data (19Lutz W. Schwab M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 303-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Sp1 and the closely related protein Sp3 are the major GC-box binding activities in nuclear extracts from most mammalian cells (for a review, see Refs. 20Philipsen S. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2991-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar and 21Suske G. Gene. 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). Sp1 can affect promoter activity in a number of different ways. Sp1 can protect CpG islands from methylation (22Brandeis M. Frank D. Keshet I. Siegfried Z. Mendelsohn M. Nemes A. Temper V. Razin A. Cedar H. Nature. 1994; 371: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar), can mediate the constitutive association of the general transcription apparatus with the core promoter to allow rapid induction in response to signals (23Ainbinder E. Revach M. Wolstein O. Moshonov S. Diamant N. Dikstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6354-6362Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and is able to recruit various activating and repressing co-regulators to a target promoter including the protein acetyltransferases p300/CBP (24Suzuki T. Kimura A. Nagai R. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), the CRSP complex (25Ryu S. Zhou S. Ladurner A.G. Tjian R.

However, E2F proteins and Sp1/Sp3 are not sufficient to activate the MYCN gene. We provide evidence that an additional step is required early in the activation process to allow binding of E2F proteins and Sp1/Sp3. Cell Culture, Transfections, and Reporter Assays—The human neuroblastoma cell lines SH-EP, IMR-32, LA-N-5, and Kelly were a gift of Manfred Schwab (Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum Heidelberg). SY5Y cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Neuroblastoma cell lines were cultured as described (19Lutz W. Schwab M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 303-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Drosophila Schneider cells were cultured and transfected as described (29Suske G. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 130: 175-187PubMed Google Scholar). 200 nm 4-OHT, 1The abbreviations used are: 4-OHT4-hydroxy-tamoxifenGC2distal GC-boxCtthreshold cycleChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationTSAtrichostatin A5-aC5-aza-cytidine. 330 nm TSA, and 500 nm 5-aC were added to the cell culture medium. 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen distal GC-box threshold cycle chromatin immunoprecipitation trichostatin A 5-aza-cytidine. For the generation of stable cell clones, SH-EP cells were transfected with pCMVE2F1-ER (kindly provided by Kristian Helin) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium using N,N-bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid-buffered saline-calcium phosphate precipitation and selected with 200 μg/ml of G418. Individual clones were checked for the expression of the fusion protein by Western-blotting with an E2F-1 specific antibody (sc-193, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). SDS-gel electrophoresis, transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and detection were performed according to standard procedures. A Cdk2-specific antibody was used to control for equal loading. Most of the luciferase reporter constructs have been described (19Lutz W. Schwab M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 303-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The mutation in CT-box 1 was introduced into the wild-type reporter construct using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared following the procedure of Schreiber (30Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar). electrophoretic mobility-shift assays were performed by pre-incubating 1–2 μg of nuclear extract with 1.5 μg of unspecific competitor poly(dI-dC) in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N′-2-ethanesulfonic acid, pH 7.9, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 8.5% glycerol for 10 min on ice. Subsequently, 0.1 ng of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide was added to a final volume of 20 μl, and samples were incubated for another 20 min on ice. For competition assays, unlabelled Sp1-specific distal GC-box (GC2) or unspecific HNF3 oligonucleotide was added in access. Sp1 and Sp3 antisera used for supershift assays were described previously (31Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). 1 μl of the appropriate antiserum was added to the binding reaction, and incubation was continued on ice for another 20 min. Samples were analyzed on 4% native polyacrylamide gels in 45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 1.6 mm EDTA. Gels were transferred to Whatman 3MM paper, dried under heat and vacuum, and exposed to x-ray films overnight. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used for band shifts are available upon request. Retroviral Infection—Human SH-EP neuroblastoma cells were transfected with an expression plasmid encoding the ecotropic receptor, and G418-resistant cells were pooled for infection with ecotropic retroviruses containing pBABE-ER-E2F-3 (kindly provided by Kristian Helin). Recombinant retroviruses were generated using the Phoenix E cell line. Infected cells were selected with 2 μg/ml of puromycin and analyzed immediately without further passaging. FACS Analysis—Cells were harvested, washed with PBS, fixed with 70% ethanol for 30 min, incubated with RNase A overnight, and stained with propidium iodide. Fluorescence of 50,000 events was measured on a FACSCalibur™ (BD Biosciences). All measurements were performed in triplicate. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—The protocol for chromatin immunoprecipitation and the primers used have been described (14Strieder V. Lutz W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2983-2989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). PCR products were either visualized on an agarose gel or directly quantified on an ABI7000 using SYBR Green. In the latter case, the number of amplification cycles required to reach a threshold is referred to as the threshold cycle (Ct) value. The differences in Ct values (ΔCt) displayed in the bar charts (Figs. 2, 5) were obtained by running PCRs in duplicate (all results shown had an S.D. ≤ 0.6). The mean of the Ct value for each sample was then subtracted from the corresponding number obtained with the control antibody (α-Gadd-45). In cases where results from different chromatin preparations had to be compared with each other (clone 1A3 with and without 4-OHT; SH-EP versus SY5Y), Ct values were corrected for differences in the Ct values of the input samples. In addition, all samples were checked for unspecific precipitation of chromatin using control primers. The following antibodies were used: anti-Gadd-45 (sc-H165, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-diacetylated histone H3 (06–599, Upstate Biotechnologies), anti-acetylated histone H4 (06–866, Upstate Biotechnologies), anti-Sp3 (sc-644, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-RNA-polymerase II (8WG16, kindly provided by Dirk Eick), anti-Tip60 was a kind gift of Bruno Amati. The rabbit anti-Sp1 is a polyclonal antibody raised against the full-length protein (31Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), and the antibodies specific for E2F family members and pocket proteins have been used for chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments before (32Takahashi Y. Rayman J.B. Dynlacht B.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 804-816PubMed Google Scholar). The IgG fraction was used for ChIP.Fig. 5Positions of nucleosomes in the MYCN promoter.A, location of the amplicons used for the mapping of nucleosomes at the human MYCN promoter (position –550 to +300). Open boxes indicate the two overlapping E2F binding sites; arrows mark the transcription start sites. B, access of micrococcal nuclease to the MYCN promoter. Nuclei were incubated with micrococcal nuclease to digest internucleosomal DNA. Real-time PCRs were performed with 5 ng each of undigested and mononucleosomal DNA using the primer pairs that amplify the fragments depicted in Fig. 5A. The reduction in signal intensity by nuclease treatment for each primer pair is represented as the difference in the Ct values between the reactions with nucleosomal and undigested DNA (mean Ct nucleosomal DNA – mean Ct undigested DNA).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) RT-PCR—Total cytoplasmic RNA was isolated with the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) or TRIzol reagent, and 1 μg was reverse-transcribed using Superscript II and random primers. An aliquot of cDNA first strands corresponding to 50 ng of RNA was used for the PCR amplification. Prior pilot experiments established that the PCR conditions used are within the linear range of amplification. Primers amplifying part of the coding sequence of the small ribosomal subunit protein S14 were used to control for differences in RNA input. Primer sequences are available upon request. Nucleosome Mapping—Nucleosomes were mapped using a published PCR-based procedure (33Morrison A.J. Sardet C. Herrera R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 856-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, isolated nuclei were digested with 375 units of micrococcal nuclease (107921, Roche Applied Science) for 10 min at 37 °C. Mononucleosomal DNA was then gel-purified. 5 ng of mononucleosomal DNA and genomic DNA isolated from undigested nuclei in parallel were used as templates for PCR. Quantitative PCRs were performed on an ABI7000 using SYBR Green. The reactions were run in duplicate (for all data presented, the S.D. was ≤ 0.3 for Ct values). To exclude contamination of the mononucleosomal DNA with longer DNA fragments because of incomplete nuclease digestion, a PCR was performed with primers that amplify a 220-bp fragment from the MYCN promoter. DNA preparations were only used if the difference of Ct values between digested and undigested DNA was at least seven cycles. Primer sequences are available upon request. Sp1 and Sp3 Activate the MYCN Promoter and Synergize with E2F-1—The proximal MYCN promoter contains two GC-boxes at positions –59/–64 and –126/–131 and two CT-boxes at positions –94/–99 and –155/–160. All four sites are putative binding sites for the transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3. To test whether Sp1 and Sp3 are able to activate the human MYCN promoter, expression vectors for Sp1, the long and short isoforms of Sp3, and E2F-1 were co-transfected with a luciferase reporter construct into Drosophila Schneider cells lacking endogenous Sp1 binding activity. The luciferase reporter gene is controlled by 230 bp of the human MYCN promoter including the E2F binding sites, the four putative Sp1/Sp3 binding sites, and multiple transcription start sites (Fig. 1A). Sp1 and the long isoform of Sp3 activated the MYCN promoter in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the short isoform of Sp3 that may function as a transcriptional repressor had no effect (data not shown). In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, Sp1 and Sp3 present in nuclear extracts of IMR-32 neuroblastoma cells that express MYCN bound to all four Sp1/Sp3 binding sites with similar affinity (Fig. 1B; the identity of the proteins producing the various shifts was confirmed with appropriate antibodies; see Fig. 2B). Consistent with this, clustered point mutations in any one binding site impaired promoter activation by co-transfected Sp1 (Fig. 1C). Mutation of the promoter proximal GC-box abolished activation of the promoter by Sp1 almost completely. Mutation of GC2 and the distal CT-box severely reduced promoter activity, whereas mutation of the proximal CT-box had only a mild but reproducible effect. We previously showed that E2F-1 activates the MYCN promoter in neuroblastoma cells (14Strieder V. Lutz W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2983-2989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Co-expression of either Sp1 or the long isoform of Sp3 with limiting amounts of E2F-1 resulted in synergistic activation of the MYCN promoter (Fig. 1D). Transfections with reporter constructs carrying mutations in individual binding sites showed that none of the Sp1/Sp3 binding sites on its own was essential for cooperation with E2F-1 (data not shown). In summary, Sp1 and Sp3 bind to four binding sites in the MYCN proximal promoter and synergize with E2F-1 to activate MYCN. Sp1 and Sp3 Bind to the MYCN Promoter in Vivo—To test whether endogenous Sp1 and Sp3 bind to the MYCN promoter in vivo, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed using antibodies against Sp1 and Sp3 and cross-linked chromatin from several human neuroblastoma cell lines differing in the status of the MYCN gene (Fig. 2A). IMR-32 and LA-N-5 show MYCN amplification and strong MYCN expression; SH-EP cells lack MYCN amplification, and MYCN expression is not detectable by RT-PCR. Precipitated chromatin was used as template for real-time PCR with primers that amplify a 200-bp fragment of the proximal MYCN promoter adjacent to the Sp1 binding sites (Fig. 2B). In IMR-32 and LA-N-5 cells expressing MYCN, both Sp1 and Sp3 were associated with the MYCN promoter. In contrast, in non-expressing SH-EP, neither Sp1 nor Sp3 were bound to the MYCN promoter (Fig. 2C). This was not because of inefficient cross-linking of Sp1/Sp3 to the chromatin in these cells, because interaction of Sp1 and Sp3 with the p107 promoter, which contains a consensus Sp1 binding site, could readily be detected (Fig. 2C). To see whether differences in the amount of Sp1 and/or Sp3 in the nucleus are responsible for the absence of detectable binding to the MYCN promoter in SH-EP cells, electrophoretic mobility-shift assays were performed with nuclear extracts from the different neuroblastoma cell lines using GC2 as a probe. All extracts contained similar amounts of both Sp1 and Sp3 (Fig. 2D). Thus, the inactivity of the MYCN promoter in SH-EP cells does not result from a lack of Sp1 or Sp3 DNA-binding activity. We conclude that Sp1 and Sp3 bind to the MYCN promoter in vivo exclusively in neuroblastoma cells expressing MYCN. We showed previously by ChIP analysis that E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3 bind to the MYCN promoter in neuroblastoma cells with MYCN amplification in vivo (14Strieder V. Lutz W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2983-2989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To analyze whether the regulatory interactions detected at the amplified gene also occur at a transcriptionally active single-copy MYCN gene, the ChIP experiment was performed with chromatin from SY5Y cells that lack MYCN amplification but express MYCN at a low level (34Sadee W. Yu V.C. Richards M.L. Preis P.N. Schwab M.R. Brodsky F.M. Biedler J.L. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 5207-5212PubMed Google Scholar). Based on a quantitation of both MYCN mRNA levels and gene copy number using real-time PCR, we calculated that IMR-32 produces 3- to 4-fold more mRNA per gene copy than SY5Y (data not shown). As in MYCN-amplified cell lines, we detected binding of Sp1, Sp3, E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3 to the MYCN promoter (Fig. 2E). E2F-4 did not interact with the MYCN promoter but was detected at the p107 promoter. Thus, the same factors that regulate MYCN expression in cell lines with MYCN amplification also control expression of a single-copy MYCN. Binding of E2F and Sp1/Sp3 Correlates with Histone Acetylation, Loading of RNA Polymerase II, and Recruitment of the Co-regulator Tip60 —Transcription factors regulate gene expression in part by recruiting co-regulators, some of which change the acetylation status of nearby histones, to target promoters. E2F-1 has been shown to interact with the histone acetyltransferase p300/CBP and with TRRAP, a component of several histone acetyltransferase complexes that contain either Gcn5 or Tip60 as the enzymatically active subunit (35Lang S.E.

However, recruitment of co-factors, histone acetylation, and loading of RNA polymerase can occur prior to the binding of a particular transcription factor (e.g. see Refs. 23Ainbinder E. Revach M. Wolstein O. Moshonov S. Diamant N. Dikstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6354-6362Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar and 38Cosma M.P. Tanaka T. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1999; 97: 299-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether histone acetylation, loading of RNA polymerase, and recruitment of co-factors, exemplified by Tip60, occur at the MYCN promoter prior to the binding of E2F and Sp1/Sp3. ChIP assays showed that, in MYCN-expressing IMR-32 and SY5Y cells, histone H3 and histone H4 were acetylated, whereas in SH-EP cells lacking MYCN expression, they were not (Fig. 2F). Yet, acetylated histones could be detected at the p107 promoter in all cell lines tested, including SH-EP. Likewise, RNA polymerase and Tip60 were detected at the MYCN promoter specifically in cells expressing MYCN but not in SH-EP cells (Fig. 2F). In contrast, the p107 promoter that is bound by E2F in all cell lines analyzed was associated with Tip60 in all cell lines, including SH-EP, thus showing that cross-linking of chromatin had been as efficient in SH-EP cells as in the other cells lines. We conclude that binding of E2F and Sp1/Sp3 to the MYCN promoter correlates with local acetylation of histones and recruitment of RNA polymerase and the co-regulator Tip60. E2F-1 Induces CCNE1 Expression and Apoptosis in Neuroblastoma Cells but Is Not Sufficient to Activate MYCN—Inhibition of E2F activity by overexpression of p16Ink4A reduces MYCN expression in neuroblastoma cells, suggesting that E2F is necessary for full activity of the MYCN promoter (14Strieder V. Lutz W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2983-2989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Is E2F-1 in combination with endogenous Sp1/Sp3 also sufficient to activate the MYCN gene in a non-expressing cell line? To address this question, we overexpressed a 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4-OHT)-regulated E2F-1-ER fusion protein in SH-EP cells that do not express MYCN and in which endogenous E2F proteins cannot be detected by ChIP at the MYCN promoter in vivo (14Strieder V. Lutz W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2983-2989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Treatment of a representative clone expressing high amounts of the fusion protein, SHEP-1A3, with 4-OHT for 12 h did not induce MYCN expression (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 4 and 7). In contrast, expression of CCNE1, another E2F target gene encoding cyclin E, was induced after treatment with 4-OHT (Fig. 3A). In addition, the gene coding for inhibin βA (INHBA), a secreted glycoprotein involved in signaling through transforming growth factor-β superfamily members, which was previously shown to be repressed by E2F-1 in U2OS osteosarcoma cells (39Muller H. Bracken A.P. Vernell R. Moroni M.C. Christians F. Grassilli E. Prosperini E. Vigo E. Oliner J.D. Helin K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 267-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), was down-regulated (Fig. 3A). Moreover, the cells underwent massive cell death after treatment with 4-OHT (Fig. 3B). After 24 h of 4-OHT treatment, almost 20% of the population displayed a sub-diploid DNA content representing cells that undergo apoptosis. At this time, 35% of the 4-OHT-treated cells were in S phase, compared with only 14% in ethanol-treated controls, suggesting that ectopic E2F-1 not only induced cell death but also stimulated entry into S phase (data not shown). After 36 h, roughly 35% of the cells were apoptotic, and after 48 h, virtually all cells had died. From these data, we conclude that the E2F-1-ER fusion protein is functional in SHEP-1A3 cells. In transient assays in neuroblastoma cells, we had observed that treatment with trichostatin A (TSA), an inhibitor of histone deacetylases, increased expression of a MYCN promoterdriven reporter construct. 2C. Kramps and W. Lutz, unpublished observations. Therefore, we treated SHEP-1A3 cells simultaneously with 4-OHT and TSA, and also with 5-azacytidine (5-aC), an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferases. Simultaneous treatment of cells with both drugs can derepress a number of otherwise silent genes by preventing the establishment and maintenance of a repressive chromatin structure (e.g. see Refs. 40El-Osta A.

Methods Enzymol. 2001; 334: 302-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) but not of mesophilic prokaryotes. MG has otherwise only been encountered in the red algae of the order Ceramiales (2Bouveng H. Lindberg B. Wickberg B. Acta Chem. Scand. 1955; 9: 807-809Crossref Google Scholar) where its function remains unclear. The highly preferential distribution of MG among prokaryotes requiring high temperatures for growth led to the hypothesis that it could play a role in the thermoprotection of cell components in vivo. At least in vitro,MG has been shown to be efficient in the protection of some enzymes against thermal inactivation (3Ramos A. Raven N.D.H. Sharp R.J. Bartolucci S. Rossi M. Cannio R. Lebbink J.

Recently, we described a method to synthesize radiolabeled MG of high specific activity from radiolabeled mannose by the use of a genetically engineered strain of Escherichia coli (5Sampaio M.-M. Santos H. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 69: 233-240Google Scholar). This prompted us to use this compound to study the potential uptake of MG in bacteria and archaea. Here, we report that carrier-mediated uptake of MG in E. coli occurs by the P-enolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS) with the HrsA (now renamed MngA) protein as a specific EII complex substrate recognition site. So far, mngA has not been assigned to the uptake of a particular PTS sugar. However, the gene was recognized during a study of temperature regulation of the outer membrane porin OmpC (6Utsumi R.

Another line of investigation that contributed to the present report is the regulation of fatty acid metabolism gene expression in E. coli. The FadR regulator has a dual function in repressing the enzymes of fatty acid β-oxidation and activating the transcription of the fabA and fabB genes of fatty acid biosynthesis (7Campbell J.W. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5982-5990Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 8Henry M.F. Cronan J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). FabR is a repressor that acts downstream of FadR in the transcriptional regulation of the fabA and fabB genes (9Zhang Y.M. Marrakchi H. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15558-15565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The existence of a third fatty acid-responsive transcription regulator was proposed by Quail et al. (10Quail M.A. Dempsey C.E. Guest J.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), who described a transcription factor adjacent to the citric acid gene cluster that was released from its DNA-binding site by either fatty acid or acyl-CoA. This gene was named farR (fatty acyl-responsive regulator). Here, we report that FarR (now renamed MngR) has no role in fatty acid metabolism but rather functions as a repressor for the adjacent and divergently oriented genes mngA and mngB. Transport of 14C-MG—Bacterial strains (Table I) were grown either in NZA medium (10 g of NZ amine (Sheffield Products Inc.) and 5 g of yeast extract/liter) or in minimal medium A (MMA) (11Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 354-432Google Scholar) with 0.4% glycerol as a carbon source in the presence or absence of 0.1% MG. After overnight growth the cultures were washed three times in MMA without carbon source and resuspended to an optical density at 578 nm of 1 corresponding to 7 × 108 cells/ml (11Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 354-432Google Scholar). [14C]2-O-α-Mannosyl-d-glycerate (296 mCi/mmol) (5Sampaio M.-M. Santos H. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 69: 233-240Google Scholar), labeled uniformly in the mannose moiety, was added to a final concentration of 0.1 μm. 0.5-ml samples were withdrawn in a time span of 10 min and filtered, and their radioactivity was determined in a scintillation counter. The initial rate of uptake was extrapolated. The rate of transport in the standard assay (0.1 μm [14C]MG at an optical density of 1.0 of the bacterial culture resuspended in MMA) is given in pmol of MG/min/109 cells taken up at room temperature. To determine the Km and Vmax of uptake, the same concentration of 0.1 μm [14C]MG was mixed with different unlabeled MG concentrations prior to the assay, and the initial rate of uptake of 14C was determined.Table IBacterial strains (E. coli) and plasmids Strains other than E. coli were obtained from the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (Braunschweig, Germany).Strain or plasmidKnown genotypeOrigin or referenceStrains BL21E. coli B F-, ompT hsdS (rB- mB-) gal dcmRef. 32Studier F.W.

The 934-bp fragment upstream of mngR was amplified by PCR with primers PS (5′-CGCGAGCTCCTCCTTGATGGCGACTTCAG, the SacI site is underlined) and PB (5′-CGCGGATCCTTAAGCTCGCCACGCGCAAT, the BamHI site is underlined). The SacI-BamHI-digested 934-bp fragment was cloned into the SacI-BamHI site of pUC19. The 809-bp fragment downstream of mngR was amplified similarly by PCR with primers PP (5′-CGCCTGCAGTTGAATATAGCCGCAACG, the PstI site is underlined) and PH (5′-CCCAAGCTTTCCATTCTGGAAGCCATC, the HindIII site is underlined). Then the PstI-HindIII-digested fragment was inserted into the PstI-HindIII site of the plasmid harboring the 934-bp upstream fragment. The BamHI and PstI double-digested chloramphenicol-resistant gene fragment was cloned into the BamHI-PstI site of the plasmid harboring both the upstream (934 bp) and downstream (809 bp) PCR fragments, yielding plasmid pUCMngRC. This plasmid was digested with AatII and Hin-dIII. The 3.0-kb fragment containing both PCR fragments, the chloramphenicol gene replacing mngR and a 350-bp fragment of pUC19, was purified from a 0.8% agarose gel. The 3.0-kb linear DNA (25 ng) was transformed into strain PDJ1 (recD::Tn10) (9Zhang Y.M. Marrakchi H. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15558-15565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) by electroporation, and chloramphenicol-resistant transformants were isolated. The mngR::cam strain grew with the same doubling time as the wild type on both rich and minimal media. The location of the inserted element and the absence of the mngR gene were confirmed by PCR (Fig. 1B) and Southern blotting (Fig. 1C). PCR experiments were performed with the primer pair P1 (5′-CGGTTGCGTATCTTGCT GTA) and P2 (5′-CTCAGAACAGGCCATTGCAT) to amplify a fragment encompassing 1 kb both upstream and downstream of mngR. The PCR products from both wild type and ΔmngR strains were digested with enzymes ClaI, NcoI, and BamHI individually. Substitution of the chloramphenicol-resistant gene for mngR increased the size of the PCR product from P1 and P2 primers by 300 bp. Thus, the PCR product from the ΔmngR strain with P1 and P2 was 2.9 kb in length (Fig. 1B, lane 2) compared with the 2.6-kb product from wild type cells (Fig. 1B, lane 1). When these two PCR products were digested with three restriction enzymes (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4, ClaI; lanes 5 and 6, NcoI; and lanes 7 and 8, BamHI), the products were of the predicted sizes (Fig. 1B). Southern blots were performed on genomic DNA isolated from both strain PDJ1 and strain LYJ1 (ΔmngR) by the phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction method (12Murray M.G. Thompson W.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 4321-4325Crossref PubMed Scopus (9497) Google Scholar). Two different restriction enzymes, BglI and PvuI, were used to digest 5 μg of genomic DNA. The digested genomic DNA was separated using a 0.8% agarose gel. The probe was the 320-bp NruI-PvuII fragment downstream of mngR (Fig. 1A) and was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. Southern transfer, hybridization, and washing were carried out by standard procedures. The bands were detected with a Molecular Dynamics Storm 860 imager, and their intensity was determined using the ImageQuant 5.1 program. The results from Southern blot analysis with the 320-bp NruI-PvuI fragment corroborated the PCR results, confirming that the chloramphenicol gene replaced the mngR gene in strain LYJ1 in the correct location without compromising the neighboring genes. The probe hybridized with a 2.9-kb fragment of wild type genomic DNA digested with BglI (Fig. 1C, lane 1), whereas the mutant had a 3.2-kb fragment (Fig. 1C, lane 2). The probe also recognized bands of the correct sizes in the PvuI digests (Fig. 1C). In the case of the ΔmngR strain, the fragments were larger by 650 bp because of the loss of the PvuI digestion site upon insertion of the chloramphenicol gene. The mngR deletion in LYJ1 was transduced into MC4100 by P1vir-mediated transduction selecting for chloramphenicol resistance yielding strain RD26. Construction of Strain LYJ2 Δ(mngR-mngB)—The construct was made using the same approach as used for the mngR knockout construct (Fig. 1A). The 846-bp fragment downstream of mngB was amplified by PCR with primers PS2 (5′-CGCGAGCTCATCGCATGAAGACTCCGAGA, the SacI site is underlined) and PB2 (5′-CGCGGATCCTTACCGGCTTGCCTGAATAG, the BamHI site is underlined). The PCR product was ligated to PCR 2.1 vector to generate PCRmngB and sequenced to be right in the Hartwell Center with ABI Prism 3700 DNA analyzer. This plasmid PCRmngB and plasmid pUCMngRC (mngR deletion construct) were double-digested by SacI and BamHI, and the released 846-bp fragment from PCRmngB was cloned into the SacI-BamHI site of pUCMngRC to yield a triple knockout construct (pUC-triC) that replaced mngR, mngA, and mngB with the chloramphenicol resistance gene. This plasmid was digested with AatII and HindIII. The 3.0-kb fragment containing both PCR fragments, the chloramphenicol gene replacing the three genes and a 350-bp fragment of pUC19, was purified from a 0.8% agarose gel. The linear DNA (25 ng) was transformed into strain PDJ1 (recD::Tn10) by electroporation, and chloramphenicol-resistant transformants were isolated. Two pairs of primers, pair P3 and PL and pair P4 and PR, were used to amplify the genomic region of the isolated strain and sent to sequence to confirm that mngR, mngA, and mngB were successfully deleted. Construction of Strain RD25 Δ(mngA)—We used the technique of Datsenko and Wanner (13Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11304) Google Scholar). Plasmid pKD13 harboring a kanamycin-resistant cassette was used as template for creating a PCR product encompassing the kanamycin cassette equipped with the DNA sequence 3′ and 5′ adjacent to the mngA gene. Strain DY330 (14Yu D. Ellis H.M. Lee E.C. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Court D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5978-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar) was transformed with this linear and purified DNA fragment selecting recombinants that were resistant against kanamycin. The successful deletion of mngA was verified by PCR using one primer initiating within the kanamycin cassette and the other from the neighboring mngB gene (Fig. 1A). The deletion was transduced by P1vir transduction (selection for kanamycin resistance) into MC4100, yielding strain RD25. Mini-transposon Mutagenesis—MC4100 (gudP-lacZ) cells were grown at 37 °C overnight in 10 ml of trypton broth (11Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 354-432Google Scholar) containing 0.2% maltose and 10 mm MgSO4. They were washed and resuspended in 1 ml of trypton broth. 100 μl of cells were incubated with phage λNK1324 (harboring a choramphenicol insertion together with the gene for the transposase) for 15 min at room temperature and for a further 15 min at 37 °C (15Way J. Davis M. Morisato M. Roberts E. Kleckner N. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 32: 369-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). λNK1324 can only be multiplied in an amber suppressor strain (XL1 from Stratagene was used). The multiplicity of infection was kept between 0.1 and 1 phage/cell. The cells were washed twice in 5 ml of LB containing 50 mm sodium citrate and were allowed to grow for 1 h at 37 °C. 100-μl samples were plated on LB containing sodium acetate (20 mm), chloramphenicol (15 μg/ml), XGal (40 μg/ml), and MG (0.5 mm) to grow overnight at 39 °C. Approximately 10,000 colonies were screened for light blue color. After one time purification of 40 such colonies, they were tested for the ability to take up [14C]MG. Two were found to exhibit 3-4-fold reduced MG transport in comparison with the parent strain. The mutation was transduced into MC4100 selecting for chloramphenicol resistance yielding ET222 and ET223. Sequencing by Inverse PCR—Chromosomal DNA (1-2 μg) of the mutants was digested by Sau3a (2 units) (New England BioLabs), and DNA fragments were separated on a 1% agarose gel (SeaKem). DNA fragments between 1000 and 2000 base pairs were cut out of the agarose gel and extracted (Qiagen). The DNA concentration was determined by UV spectrophotometry. The fragments (diluted to a concentration of 0.3 μg/ml in ligation buffer) were circularized overnight by T4 ligase (1 unit) (New England BioLabs) at 16 °C. DNA was then treated by an equal volume of phenol/chloroform. The upper phase was removed, and the DNA was precipitated with 1/10 volume of 3 m sodium acetate and 2-fold volume of 100% ethanol and collected by centrifugation. After washing the DNA with 70% ethanol, PCR was performed with 0.2 μg of circularized DNA in the presence of 0.2 mm dNTPs and 5 pmol of each primer, ah1 (5′-GATTTTTACCAAAATCATTAGGGGATTCATC-3′) and ah2 (5′-CATTAAGTTAAGGTGGATACACATCTTG-3′) (16Ochman H. Gerber A.S. Hartl D.L. Genetics. 1988; 120: 621-623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Triglia T. Peterson M.G. Kemp D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 8186Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). These primers are complementary to the 3′ and 5′ ends of the insertion and permit direct elongation into the adjacent chromosomal DNA. We used an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 4 min followed by 35 cycles comprising denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, primer annealing at 56 °C for 1.5 min, and extension by Taq polymerase (Eppendorf) at 72 °C for 2 min. The resulting PCR product was electrophoresed through a 1% agarose gel, cut out, purified (gel purification kit; Qiagen), and sequenced using the primers ah1 and ah2 (GATC Biotech AG) (Fig. 1A). Construction of pACS31 Harboring mngA under lac Promoter Control—Plasmid pACS31 harboring mngA under an IPTG-inducible promoter was cloned using pTK18 (6Utsumi R. Horie T. Katoh A. Kaino Y. Tanabe H. Noda M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1996; 60: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) as template for PCR. mngA was amplified with two flanking primers containing a BamHI cleavage site at the 5′ end (underlined) and a HindIII cleavage site (underlined) at the 3′ end. The first primer was 5′-AAAGGATCCATGGTATTGTTTTATCGGGC-3′, and the second primer was 5′-AAAAAGCTTTTATGGCATTACGCCATCA-3′. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and HindIII and ligated into pTrc99B (18Amann E. Ochs B. Abel K.-J. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 69: 301-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar) that had been opened with the same two restriction endonucleases. Construction of pACS32 Harboring mngR under lac Promoter Control—mngR was amplified by PCR using chromosomal DNA of MC4100 as template and flanking primers containing a BamHI cleavage site (underlined) at the 5′ end and a HindIII cleavage site (underlined) at the 3′ end. The first primer was 5′-AAAGGATCCATGGGACACAAGCCCTT-3′ and the second primer was 5′-AAAAAGCTTTTATCGCGATGATTTTCG-3′. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and Hin-dIII and ligated into pTrc99B that had been opened with the same restriction endonucleases. The resulting plasmid carrying mngR under an IPTG-inducible promotor was named pACS32. Microarray Analysis—An overnight culture of E. coli MC4100 grown in MMA plus 0.4% glycerol was diluted 1:100 into the same medium for the control and in MMA, 0.4% glycerol plus 0.1% MG for the induced culture condition. The cells were harvested at an optical density of 0.49 for the control and 0.53 for the MG medium (6.6 h after inoculation). Extraction of the RNA was conducted following the Gross lab method (www.microarrays.org/protocols.html). Further purification was performed using Qiagen columns (RNeasy Mini protocol for RNA clean up). The quality of the RNAs was assessed by visualization on an agarose gel and the purity by ratios of the absorbance at 260 and 280 nm in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7; these values were found to be 2.1. Reverse transcription of the RNA preparation was conducted using random hexamers (Amersham Biosciences) as primers and Fluoroscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription of RNA (26.5 μg) from the control culture was labeled with cyanine-3 fluorescent dNTPs, whereas that from the MG culture was labeled with cyanine-5 fluorescent dNTPs. The reaction was performed at 50 °C for 90 min. The obtained cDNAs were purified using the fluoroscript kit purifying columns (Invitrogen). The quality of the cDNAs was assessed on agarose gels and quantified by absorbance at 260 nm. Equal quantities of labeled cDNA were mixed, and the solution was concentrated to 1-4 μl by freeze drying. Hybridization was performed on full E. coli K12 genome microarrays (Affymetrix). The concentrated solution of cDNAs was dissolved in 120 μl of hybridization buffer and heated for 3 min at 90 °C. The hybridization solution was placed on the chip using the MWG gene frame and incubated for 16 h at 42 °C under mild agitation and protected from light. The chip was washed by successive incubations at 30 °C, under mild agitation, in the three following washing solutions: washing buffer 1 (2× SSC buffer (SSC buffer: 0.15 m sodium chloride, 0.015 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0) plus 0.1% SDS); washing buffer 2 (1× SSC); and washing buffer 3 (0.1× SSC). Excess water was eliminated by centrifuging the microarray at 2000 rpm for 2 min. Detection of cyanine-3 and cyanine-5 fluorescence of the hybridized microarray was performed using the Affymetrix 428 Array scanner and processing of the data using the image analysis software (Imagene and Genesight software from Biodiscovery). Essentially the same protocol was used for the identifying the gene expression of the ΔmngR strain and to test the response of the cloned mngA gene on pACS31 in comparison with the vector plasmid (control culture). Strain MC4100 gudP-lacZ harboring plasmid pACS31 or the vector pTrc99B was grown on MMA 0.4% glycerol, 0.1 mm tryptophan, and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. β-Galactosidase Activity—The β-galactosidase activity in reporter fusions was tested according to Miller (11Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 354-432Google Scholar) in cells grown overnight in MMA and 0.2% glycerol as a carbon source in the presence or absence of 0.1% glycerate or 0.5 mm MG. Specific β-galactosidase activity is given in μmol of o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside/min/mg of protein hydrolyzed. The protein content was estimated by the optical density of the culture at 578 nm. According to Miller (11Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 354-432Google Scholar) an optical density of 1.4 corresponds to 150 μg/ml. α-Mannosidase Activity—The α-mannosidase activity assay was performed as described previously (19Li Y.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5474-5480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli strains (PDJ1, LYJ1, and LYJ2) were grown overnight in M9 minimal medium (11Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 354-432Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.4% succinate, 0.01% methionine, and 0.0005% thiamin. Then 5 mmp-nitrophenyl-α-d-mannoside or 5 mmp-nitrophenyl-β-d-mannoside was added into each cell suspension, and incubation was continued for 3 h at 37 °C. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the adsorption at 405 nm was measured. In Vitro MG Phosphorylation—Strain MC4100 harboring plasmid pACS31 or no plasmid was grown overnight in LB supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml). No IPTG was added for induction when growing MC4100/pACS31, allowing just basal expression of mngA. The cells were washed three times with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, plus 100 mm NaCl and broken in a French pressure cell at 16,000 p.s.i. The extract was shortly centrifuged to remove unbroken cells. The resulting supernatant was ultracentrifugated (90,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C) to separate membranes from the crude extract. The membranes and crude extract were dialyzed separately overnight at 4 °C against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6. The phosphorylation assay contained 12 μl of an equal mixture of buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 25 mm dithiothreitol, 125 mm NaF) and buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10-100 mm P-enolpyruvate, 50 mm MgCl2), 15 μl of crude extract (30 μg protein), and 3 μl of membrane suspension (3-4 μg of protein). The reaction was started by the addition of 5 μl of [14C]MG (0.025 μCi; 296 mCi/mmol) (5Sampaio M.-M. Santos H. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 69: 233-240Google Scholar). 10-μl samples were removed at different time intervals and spotted on a TLC (silica) plate. Chromatograms were developed with a solvent system composed of n-propanol/25% ammonia (1:1, v/v). TLC plates were autoradiographed for 2-3 days. The control assays were done with membranes from uninduced MC4100 not harboring mngA. When the dependence of P-enolpyruvate was measured, unlabeled MG (100 μm) was added to the complete assay mixture 10 min before the addition of [14C]MG. To ensure that the product formed was MG-P, in one assay before spotting the samples onto the TLC plate, the proteins were precipitated by adding 5 μl of 12% trichloroacetic acid to the 10-μl samples. The mixture was kept on ice for 15 min and centrifuged for 2 min at 20,000 × g. The acidic supernatant was neutralized by adding concentrated KOH. After reaching neutrality, 1 unit of alkaline phosphatase was added, and the samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. After the treatment, the samples were spotted on the TLC plate, and the chromatograms were developed using the same solvent system. Growth Curves—Strain KM522 is defective in the synthesis of internal trehalose and is therefore highly sensitive to salt. It was grown in MMA and 0.4% glycerol as carbon source. It was diluted 1:100 into fresh medium, one with and one without 0.5 mm MG. After 6 h the cultures were split, and 500 mm salt was added to one portion. The optical density at 600 nm was followed.

Here we report the systematic analysis of the atomic composition of proteins encoded by organisms representative of each kingdoms. Protein atomic contents are shown to vary largely among species, the larger variations being observed for the main architectural component of proteins, the carbon atom. These variations apply to the bulk proteins as well as to subsets of ortholog proteins. A pronounced correlation between proteome carbon content and genome base composition is further evidenced, with high G+C genome content being related to low protein carbon content. The generation of random proteomes and the examination of the canonical genetic code provide arguments for the hypothesis that natural selection might have driven genome base composition.

Comparative analyses of complete genome sequences were anticipated to reveal the molecular bases of biodiversity as well as to increase our comprehension of the constraints that shaped protein composition and structure during the natural history of living organisms. However, whereas comparative genomics highlighted genome structure plasticity and strengthened the role of lateral gene transfer during the natural history of living organisms (1Ochman H. Lawrence J.G. Groisman E.A. Nature. 2000; 405: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (2658) Google Scholar, 2Koonin E.V. Aravind L. Kondrashov A.S. Cell. 2000; 101: 573-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), less progress was accomplished in understanding adaptive evolution at a molecular level and how it contributes to changes in proteins. Studies devoted to protein evolution mostly use comparative analyses of protein primary sequences and attempt to identify which rules govern the conservations, substitutions, and deletions of amino acids that are observed between proteins (3Suekoa N. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1961; 26: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 4Singer G.A.C. Hickey D.A. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2000; 17: 1581-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 5Thorne J.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 602-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). By focusing on amino acid composition, such studies do not address the possibility that evolution of proteins, and more generally of biopolymers, might have been shaped at a more intimate level: the atomic level. It is worthwhile to note that, among the constitutive elements of proteins, carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms are subject to geochemical cycles at the surface of the earth (6Brock D. Madigan M.T. Biology of Microorganisms. 6th Ed. Prentice-Hall International, London1991: 634-648Google Scholar). As a consequence, large fluctuations of both form and abundance of elemental components of proteins are occurring in natural habitats. One would thus expect that specific molecular mechanisms might have evolved to allow living organisms to respond to the elemental variations of the environment that they inevitably faced during their natural history. These adaptative processes undoubtedly left traces in the chemical composition of biopolymers, and it could be anticipated that the advent of complete genomic sequences, combined with the use of straightforward statistical methods, would open the way to retrieve such imprints in macromolecule sequences. To approach this question, we previously investigated the atomic composition of protein subsets from both the bacteria Escherichia coli and the eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae (7Baudouin-Cornu P. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Marliere P. Thomas D. Science. 2001; 293: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This study allowed us to discern that, in both organisms, the atomic composition of several protein families has been constrained in response to specific selective pressures. A pronounced correlation between atomic compositions and metabolic roles were deciphered in enzymes involved in essential nutriment assimilation in these microbial organisms. For instance, carbon assimilatory enzymes were found to contain significantly less carbon atoms than the total proteins of E. coli and S. cerevisiae (7Baudouin-Cornu P. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Marliere P. Thomas D. Science. 2001; 293: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Also, sulfur assimilatory enzymes of both organisms were shown to comprise less sulfur atoms that the bulk proteins. Such impoverishments of sulfur and carbon assimilatory enzymes in their respective element were interpreted as an imprint of variations in the nutritional availability of these elements during the natural history of E. coli and S. cerevisiae. These results thus suggested that the evolution of proteins could have been subjected to ecological constraints more than previously thought. In the next step, we wanted to know how broad the fluctuations of elemental protein composition might be, and more specifically, whether the atomic contents of proteins could display substantial variations among different organisms. Here we report the first results of the systematic analysis of the atomic contents of the proteins encoded by organisms whose genome has been entirely sequenced. Complete protein data sets from 46 organisms, representative of the bacteria, archaea, and eukaryote kingdoms were compiled and analyzed using quantile distributions. The results show that the atomic composition of proteins, especially their carbon content, widely differs among species and may differ more between species than within proteomes. A strongly significant correlation between the average carbon content of proteomes and the DNA base composition of the genomes was moreover uncovered. Randomization methods and analysis of the genetic code further demonstrate that the extant genetic code relates DNA G+C usage with the carbon content of proteins. Organisms Used for This Study—Five eukaryotic, ten archaeal, and thirty-one bacterial proteomes were downloaded from the GenBank™ FTP site (ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genbank/genomes/). All of the proteins containing one or more undetermined amino acid (“X”) were discarded, except for Arabidopsis thaliana proteins in which only the X amino acids were discarded. The coding G+C contents were retrieved from Kazusa's Codon Usage Data Base (www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/), which is an extended WWW version of CUTG (Codon Usage Tabulated from GenBank™). The prokaryotic total G+C contents were found in the literature.

Orthologous Proteins—Sequences of proteins comprised within 25 different clusters of orthologous proteins (COGs) 1The abbreviation used is: ! COGcluster of orthologous proteins. spanning 43 genomes were retrieved (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/). The 25 used COGs consist of COGs corresponding to 11 ribosomal proteins (COG0522, COG0099, COG0081, COG0088, COG1841, COG1358, COG2075, COG2147, COG1890, COG1471, and COG2058) and 14 COGs corresponding to other abundant proteins (COG0495, COG0149, COG0126, COG0057, COG0167, COG0469, COG0492, COG0192, COG0191, COG0055, COG0450, COG1155, COG0174, and COG1156). Proteins belonging to these 25 COGs were clustered according to species (bacteria, 16 COGs; archea, 20 COGs) or according to COGs, the corresponding protein carbon usages were calculated, and the resulting quantile distributions were displayed as for whole proteomes. cluster of orthologous proteins. Random Proteomes—Random protein samples were first produced using the natural codon catalog from random DNAs displaying different G+C contents. For each G+C content value, five different protein samples were generated, and their resulting carbon quantile distributions were calculated. Each protein sample is composed of 2000 random proteins, the lengths of which are distributed among nine values ranging from 100 to 600 residues to mimic the distributions of real protein lengths. The codons were sorted out with the unique constraints of having PA = PT and PC = PG, where PX is the probability of sorting the base X out of the set {A, C, T, G}, and PG is chosen to raise the wanted final G+C content. The stop codons were systematically discarded. To analyze random protein samples produced with randomly generated genetic codes, 500 plausible alternative codes were first generated following the criteria of Haig and Hurst (8Haig D. Hurst L.D. J. Mol. Evol. 1991; 33: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), which are: (i) to assign one of the 20 amino acids to each cluster of codons coding for one amino acid in real life and (ii) to keep the stop codons. From each randomly generated code, six randomly generated genomes coding for 2000 proteins of 280 residues were computed as described above and raised final G+C contents of 28.7, 37.5, 44.4, 50.9, 59.6, and 65.6%, respectively. The correlation factors r between those six G+C content values and the resulting carbon mean values were calculated for each code. The quantile distribution of the slope of the corresponding regression lines were plotted for all of the codes leading to a squared correlation factor of >0.9. Computerized DNA Mutations—Randomization essays were performed starting from the DNA sequence of an E. coli gene coding for a protein of length L. Repeatedly, one position of the DNA sequence was randomly chosen, and the corresponding base was proposed to be mutated into one randomly chosen different base. Every position in the DNA sequence had the same probability to be chosen. Similarly, replacement with each of the three remaining base was equiprobable. Only mutations that would strictly decrease the carbon content of the encoded protein were kept. The number of effective mutations, the GC value of the resulting DNA sequence, and the carbon content of the corresponding protein were checked every L fold proposals of mutation. Large Variations of Protein Atomic Contents in Firmicute Species—To analyze the atomic content of proteins encoded by entirely sequenced genomes, we used quantile distribution methods and stochastic ordering concepts (9Karlin S. Blaisdell B.E. Bucher P. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 729-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 10Karlin S. Brendel V. Science. 1992; 257: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). For each organism, the quantile distributions of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur atom frequencies within the residue side chains of the encoded proteins were calculated. The quantile QAS (x) is the fraction of proteins from the specie (S) in which the averaged number of atoms (A) per residue side chain is at most x. The medians (the QA-1 (0.50) point) and the 80% quantile range (corresponding to the 0.10–0.90 quantile levels) are major statistical measurement of atomic contents (10Karlin S. Brendel V. Science. 1992; 257: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). As a first assessment of how the atomic composition of proteins fluctuates on a proteome-wide level, we chose the phylogenetically related group of firmicutes, a bacteria family that comprises the well known model organism B. subtilis and provides a large set of entirely sequenced genomes (11Woese C.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 221-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results of the analysis made with 11 different firmicute bacteria are depicted in Fig. 1. As previously noted for E. coli and S. cerevisiae (7Baudouin-Cornu P. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Marliere P. Thomas D. Science. 2001; 293: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), the quantile distributions indicate that, for each organism, the carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur contents of proteins follow bell-shaped distributions that are nearly Gaussian. Importantly, the results show that, depending on the atom considered, the atomic quantile distributions are differently scattered among species. Indeed, whereas quantile distributions for carbon, and to a lesser extent for sulfur, display substantial variations between species, the nitrogen quantile distributions are largely similar in all of the analyzed bacterial species. The statistical significance of the differences observed between carbon (or sulfur) distributions can be assessed by using normal z tests. A two-sided p value (<10–9) confirms that, for instance, the differences observed between the B. halodurans and S. aureus carbon distributions are significant and likely not to occur by chance. A simple hypothesis accounting for the results reported in Fig. 1 would have been that the scattering of the quantile distributions seen among species reflects the variation of the number of the considered atom within the 20 canonical amino acids. The clustering of the nitrogen, but not of the sulfur quantile distribution, rules out this hypothesis. Indeed, sulfur protein contents broadly vary between firmicute species, whereas amino acids contain at most one sulfur atom. In contrast, nitrogen protein contents are clustered, although either 0, 1, 2, or 3 nitrogen atoms are found in the side chains of canonical amino acids. Altogether, the results displayed in Fig. 1 suggest that, at the atomic level, the composition of the proteins encoded by each genome broadly varies from one organism to another and overemphasize at a proteome-wide level the plasticity of protein atomic contents previously established for cyanobacterial light-harvesting proteins (12Mazel D. Marlière P. Nature. 1989; 341: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and microbial assimilatory enzymes (7Baudouin-Cornu P. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Marliere P. Thomas D.

Cell. 2002; 9: 713-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Protein Carbon Contents Differ More between Species than within Each Proteome—Because the largest variations in protein atomic content were observed for carbon, which is the main architectural component of proteins, we focused our analysis on this atom (sulfur variation analyses will be reported elsewhere). Fig. 2 shows that the variations in protein carbon content observed for the firmicutes also hold for other bacterial species as well as for the archaea and eukaryote kingdoms. Remarkably, the carbon distributions for all kingdoms appear to be strictly ordered, with no (bacteria and archaea) or only few (eukaryotes) crosses between the plots, even at the outliers of the distributions. This indicates that although the mean values of protein carbon contents largely differ between species, the spread of each distribution is equivalent for all of the species analyzed. Because the overall dispersal of the carbon quantile distributions is larger than the spread of each quantile distribution (Fig. 2), the carbon variance of each species is smaller than would be the variance of a species composed of all the proteins of all organisms (data not shown). Therefore, the atomic composition of proteins appears to be more different between species than within each organism. The stochastic ordering of the carbon quantile distributions observed for both archaeal and bacterial species further demonstrates that at each level of protein carbon content, the quantile points are similarly ranked between species. Thus, whatever the origin of the observed variations in protein carbon content was, their cause seems to have changed uniformly the totality of the proteins encoded by each organism. To further assess this point, the carbon contents of several ortholog proteins shared by archaeal and bacterial species were analyzed. Sequences of proteins comprised within different COGs (14Tatusov R.L. Koonin E.V. Lipman D.J. Science. 1997; 278: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (2750) Google Scholar) were retrieved from the COG data base, and the corresponding carbon contents were calculated and analyzed. Calculations made with 27 randomly chosen COGs first showed that the carbon contents of ortholog proteins vary among species as the carbon content of whole proteomes (data not shown). Although only few data are available on the variations of protein abundance at the level of whole organisms, we tried to take into account the possible influence of protein abundance variations in our calculations. We used the recent study of Ghaemmaghami et al. (15Ghaemmaghami S. Huh W.K. Bower K. Howson R.W. Belle A. Dephoure N. O'Shea E.K. Weissman J.S. Nature. 2003; 425: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (2993) Google Scholar), which reported the comprehensive analysis of the abundance of most proteins of S. cerevisiae, and we assumed that orthologs of abundant yeast proteins are probably abundant in their corresponding species. 25 COGs were selected as comprising one of the 75 most abundant proteins of S. cerevisiae and having representative in several bacteria or archea species. The yeast proteins belonging to these COGs account for up to 17% of the expressed proteins in S. cerevisiae. Quantile distributions of carbon usage of proteins belonging to these 25 COGs were calculated for each species. The results (Fig. 3A) show that the carbon quantile distributions of abundant ortholog proteins are dispersed among species as the carbon quantile distributions calculated for all the proteins of each species. In addition, the quantile distributions of ortholog and total proteins are similarly ordered among species. Next, the carbon content of abundant ortholog proteins was calculated as gathered by COGs. Carbon quantile distributions were calculated for each of the 11 COGs having representatives in almost all of the 43 studied species and compared with the quantile distribution of the averaged carbon content of whole proteomes. As depicted in Fig. 3B, the slopes of the quantile distributions of carbon contents of ortholog proteins gathered by COGs are similar to the slope of the quantile distribution of the median carbon values (QC-1 (0.5)) of total proteins. This shows that, within a COG, the carbon content of ortholog proteins varies among species as the averaged carbon content of whole proteomes. Thus, taken together, the results of the analysis of COGs carbon contents establish that carbon content of ortholog proteins vary among species as the bulk proteins, independently of their abundance. These results are further striking because the uncovered biases in protein carbon contents are quantitatively significant. Calculations indeed reveal that the amount of carbon atoms needed for protein synthesis may differ from more than 12% between species. This means that, depending on the organism, from 550 to 660 carbon atoms are, on average, used to build the residue side chains of a protein of 200 residues. We noticed that, according to the compilation of Neidhardt and Umbarger (16Neidhardt F.C. Umbarger H.E. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingramham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhymurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 13-16Google Scholar), such a difference may account for more than 6% of all the carbon atoms fixed to construct a canonical bacterial cell such as E. coli. Proteome Carbon Content Is Related to Genome Base Composition—Taken together, the above results argue that protein carbon content biases result from constraints that were superimposed to those acting on activity, folding, and stability of proteins and that are generally viewed as the primary determinants of protein evolution (17Nei M. Molecular Evolutionary Genetics. Columbia University Press, New York1987Crossref Google Scholar, 18Tourasse N.J. Li W.H. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2000; 17: 656-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We thus searched for a plausible origin for these atomic composition biases. We first tried to establish whether variations of protein carbon contents result from the impoverishment or enrichment of particular amino acids. The amino acid contents of the proteins of organisms displaying various mean protein carbon contents were retrieved and compared. This comparison, made with seven prokaryotes, showed that organisms with high protein carbon contents contain, on average, more asparagine, lysine, and isoleucine residues (Fig. 4). Conversely, organisms with low protein carbon content encode proteins enriched in glycine and alanine residues. The differences are, however, weak, and the overall trend is rather that protein atomic variations result from variations in the usage of a large number of amino acids. Various traits of the analyzed species were next inspected and did not suggest a direct explanation for the origin of the biases. However, we noticed that the ordering of the carbon distributions was somehow related to phylogeny and taxonomy. This pointed us at the guanosine plus cytosine composition of genomic DNAs, which displays both large interspecific and low intraspecific variations as the above reported protein carbon biases. Indeed, DNA G+C content is known to vary from ∼25 to 75% between species, with closely related species generally having similar DNA G+C contents (19Muto A. Osawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 166-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). We thus examined whether the average protein carbon content might be correlated to DNA G+C content. As shown in Fig. 5A, a strong correlation between the genome nucleotide composition and the mean value of protein carbon contents was uncovered. The results are statistically highly significant, with the median of the carbon quantile distributions being correlated with both the G+C content of the coding DNA (p < 10–16, 44 species) and the G+C content of the total DNA (p < 10–15, 40 species). In addition, regressions were calculated for each of the three kingdoms, bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, confirming that this relation applies for every lineages (Fig. 5B). In contrast, there is no correlation between protein sulfur content and genome composition, although protein sulfur distributions widely vary among species (Fig. 5A). To further assess that the correlation observed between the median quantile point of the carbon distributions and the G+C content indeed applies to the whole proteome and was not a result of extreme carbon usage in particular proteins or protein families, we used the 80% quantile ranges. Regressions between both the QC-1 (0.10) and the QC-1 (0.90) and the G+C DNA content were calculated, and as for the mean carbon content, highly significant correlations were found at both values (Fig. 5C). Finally, we compared the carbon content of ortholog proteins belonging to several COGs and their relationship to the G+C content of the genomes that encode them. As shown in Table I, the relationships between low protein carbon content and high DNA G+C content hold as well for ortholog proteins. All of these results therefore provide strong evidence that the carbon content of proteins is strongly related to the base composition of their encoding genome.Table IVariations, among six organisms displaying different DNA G+C contents, of the amount of carbon required for the building of several ortholog proteinsCDG0012001800300051008101490575ProteinPredicted GTPaseArginyl-tRNA synthetaseDimethyladenosine transferaseRibosomal protein S10Ribosomal protein L1Triosephosphate isomeraseCDP-diglyceride synthetaseE. coli genevchFargSksgArpsJrplAtplAcdsAC. crescentus (G + C = 67.42%)residues366600258102229253275average carbon2.782.892.663.042.562.462.95total carbon175229381204514104611301365M. tuberculosis (G + C = 65.79%)residues357550317101235261305average carbon2.742.792.792.992.632.642.81total carbon169526341520504108912131474M. leprae (G + C = 59.53%)residues356550306101235261312average carbon2.762.782.873.002.562.682.83total carbon169626321493505109612231508E. coli (G + C = 51.11%)residues363577273103234255249average carbon2.842.982.972.992.632.653.25total carbon176028741357514108111871307M. pneumoniae (G + C = 41.06%)residues362537263108226244395average carbon3.063.283.203.102.842.993.36total carbon183428341368551109512182121M. genitalium (G + C = 31.74%)residues367537259106226244374average carbon3.103.313.343.132.923.033.33total carbon187128521385544111212281995 Open table in a new tab Proteome Carbon Content and Genome Base Composition Relationship Is Imprinted in the Extant Genetic Code—That proteome atomic composition is so closely entwined with genome base composition also suggests that this relation is imprinted in the structure of the canonical genetic code. To test the hypothesis that the genetic code indeed relates low protein carbon content to high DNA G+C content, we first followed a randomization approach. Using the natural codon sets, random protein samples were produced from random DNAs with different G+C contents (see “Experimental Procedures”), and the resulting protein carbon quantile distributions were calculated. This shows that all the random protein samples produced from random DNAs having the same G+C content display the same carbon quantile distributions (Fig. 6A). Moreover, the random protein carbon distributions are stochastically ordered according to the G+C content of the randomly generated DNAs. As shown in Fig. 6A, we found a strong correlation between nucleotide composition of random genomes and the median quantile value QC-1 (0.5) of carbon contents of the corresponding proteins. On the contrary, protein sulfur content distributions of random proteomes do not correlate with the base composition of random DNAs (data not shown) as observed for real organisms. To further analyze how the extant genetic code relates low proteome carbon content to high G+C genome content, we next examined, within the current codon catalog, all of the single mutations that replace one amino acid with another, and we determined how single mutations that lower or increase amino acid carbon content in turn modify the G+C content of corresponding codons. Calculations (Fig. 6B) demonstrate that among the single mutations that lower amino acid carbon content, 49.05% do increase G+C codon content, 35.22% do not change the G+C codon content, and only 15.72% decrease the G+C codon content (as expected, the exact opposite trend was measured for mutations increasing amino acid carbon content with 49.05% lowering and 15.72% increasing the G+C codon content, respectively). Randomization assays show how the accumulation of mutations lowering the carbon content of a protein in turn increases the G+C content of its encoding gene (Fig. 6C). Finally, we wondered whether the relationship for which we showed evidence above is specific to the extant genetic code. We therefore analyzed random protein samples produced with randomly generated codes. 500 alternative codes were generated according to the criteria of Haig and Hurst (8Haig D. Hurst L.D. J. Mol. Evol. 1991; 33: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). From each randomly generated code, six randomly generated genomes coding for 2000 proteins of 280 residues and raising six different G+C contents were computed. The correlation factors r between those six G+C content values and the resulting carbon mean values were calculated for each code. The quantile distribution of the slopes of the corresponding regression lines were plotted for all of the codes leading to a squared correlation factor of >0.9. As shown in Fig. 6D, the random reassignments of the 20 amino acids to the codon sets observed in the canonical genetic code show that less than 6% of randomly generated codes allow the protein carbon content to be negatively correlated with DNA G+C content and to vary with an amplitude equal or larger than what is observed with the canonical genetic code. Therefore, the ability of relating low protein carbon content to high G+C DNA content appears to be a property shared by only few genetic codes that could be generated from the codon sets found in the canonical code. This study reveals the remarkable plasticity of the elemental composition of proteins, a striking but previously overlooked feature of these biopolymers. Indeed, large and widespread differences between protein atomic compositions are observed among species. This holds mainly for two elements, sulfur and carbon, the larger variations being measured for the later atom. Indeed, protein carbon contents differ more between species than within species. Moreover, these differences are not due to biases found in specific protein subclasses but apply to the entire proteomes. The carbon contents of ortholog proteins vary as the carbon contents of total proteins, and these variations are observed for abundant proteins as well. This indicates that constraints different from those acting on activity, specificity, folding, and stability came into play during the evolution of protein atomic structures. These results generalize at a proteome-wide level the variation of protein atomic contents already established for several subsets of enzymes such as cyanobacterial light-harvesting proteins (12Mazel D. Marlière P. Nature. 1989; 341: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and microbial assimilatory enzymes (7Baudouin-Cornu P. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Marliere P. Thomas D. Science. 2001; 293: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Such a protein evolution feature escaped previous attention because most of the studies devoted to protein evolution focused on amino acid composition. Indeed, protein carbon content differences do not result in biases of one or few amino acids but modify the usage of most of them. It is worthwhile to note that such protein carbon biases are of quantitative significance because they could account for more than 6% of the carbon required to construct a microbial cell, therefore strengthening the hypothesis of nutritional constraints as shaping protein structures. A highly significant correlation between protein carbon content and the base composition of the genomes is moreover evidenced, with low protein carbon content being correlated with high DNA G+C content. This correlation, found in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryote kingdoms, does not arise from extreme carbon usage in peculiar proteins or protein families but applies to entire proteomes. The analysis of several ortholog proteins, belonging to different COGs, shows that the relationships between low protein carbon content and high DNA G+C content hold as well for ortholog proteins. The correlation between DNA G+C and protein carbon contents strongly sustains the possibility that the composition of one class of biopolymers might have been determined by the other through the canonical genetic code. At the same time, this strong relation poses the conundrum of the flow of causality: DNA composition dictating protein atomic composition or the converse? The first mode (DNA composition dictating protein atomic composition) is in line with the neutral theory of evolution (20Kimura M. The Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1983Crossref Google Scholar) and more specifically with the original view of Suekoa (3Suekoa N. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1961; 26: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), according to which genome composition biases are due to differences between the forward and backward mutation rates of the GC and AT pairs (21Sueoka N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1962; 48: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Although the molecular basis of biased AT/GC pressure is unknown, it was suggested to act uniformly on DNA molecules (19Muto A. Osawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 166-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Biased mutation pressure was proposed to result in turn in amino acid composition biases in proteins (4Singer G.A.C. Hickey D.A. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2000; 17: 1581-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 21Sueoka N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1962; 48: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 22Lobry J.R. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 205: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In this model, any modification in DNA base usage will gradually lead, along generations, to either frugal or wasteful carbon fixation. It has been noticed early that the smallest amino acids were indeed encoded by codons comprising the G and C bases only (23Woese C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), yet the close relationship that exists between protein carbon and DNA G+C contents might have been overlooked. The second mode (protein composition dictating DNA composition) fits with a more selectionist view of evolution and with the previous proposals that metabolic flows and geochemical budgets might be constraints that were imprinted on protein evolution (7Baudouin-Cornu P. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Marliere P. Thomas D. Science. 2001; 293: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 24Akashi H. Gojobori T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3695-3700Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). In a simple model, the adaptation to nutritional resources scarce in carbon could result in the fixation of mutations trimming the protein carbon content, which in turn lead to a progressive enrichment of genomes in GC bases. Examination of the structure of the genetic code provides further arguments for such a model. Indeed, calculations and randomization assays show that, given the structure of the canonical codon catalog, the successive accumulation of mutations lowering the carbon content of proteins will in turn lead to a genomic enrichment in GC bases. The fact that compositional constraints might come into play during protein evolution has been previously delineated in the case of highly expressed proteins in cyanobacteria; the sulfur-oligotrophic Calothrix Sp PCC7601 encodes a sulfur-depleted version of its most abundant protein (phycocyanin) that is specifically expressed under sulfur limitation (12Mazel D. Marlière P. Nature. 1989; 341: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Likewise, upon cadmium exposition, yeast cells save sulfur by reducing the expression of sulfur rich-proteins, such as several abundant glycolytic enzymes that are replaced by sulfur-depleted isoenzymes (13Fauchon M. Lagniel G. Aude J.C. Lombardia L. Soularue P. Petat C. Marguerie G. Sentenac A. Werner M. Labarre J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 713-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Taken together, our results suggest that DNA G+C content biases might be a direct consequence of the optimization of protein atomic contents in response to carbon availability in natural habitats. Noteworthy, G+C contents are known to vary only weakly in metazoan species with the vertebrate genomes that show a quite uniform average G+C content, ranging from 40 to 45% (21Sueoka N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1962; 48: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 25Bernardi G. Bernardi G. J. Mol. Evol. 1985; 22: 363-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This could be accounted for by the fact that vertebrates are expected to be subjected to specific elemental nutritional constraints less than micro-organisms. Also, free living bacteria tend to have genomes with significantly higher G+C contents, and thus to express proteins constructed with less carbon atoms, than pathogen or symbiont bacteria, which rely on nutritional resources provided by their hosts and thus are less subjected to environmental carbon limitations (26Rocha E.P. Danchin A. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 291-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Experimental confirmations of the hypothesis that genome base composition is driven by nutritional constraints shaping protein atomic contents would provide a new way to explore the origin of genome composition biases, a question that lies at the heart of current molecular evolutionary debates. We are especially grateful to Bruno Sargueil for fruitful discussions and suggestions."
https://openalex.org/W2020588466,"Abstract In Drosophila, Hedgehog (Hh) signal transduction has been shown to require a multiprotein complex (Hedgehog signaling complex (HSC)), which includes the Kinesin-related protein Costal2 (Cos2), the serine/threonine protein kinase Fused (Fu), and the transcription factor Cubitus interruptus (Ci). We present evidence that a biologically relevant fraction of the HSC is found in association with cellular membranes. We demonstrate that Cos2 is capable of tethering an exogenous protein to vesicular membranes and that Cos2 association with membranes is Hh-sensitive. In addition, we demonstrate that Cos2 associates with membranes in cells that lack the transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo) through a domain of Cos2 distinct from its recently characterized Smo binding domain. We suggest that an Hh-regulated membrane binding activity of Cos2 is part of the mechanism by which Cos2 contributes to Hh signaling. We propose a model in which there are two distinct HSCs with discrete subcellular localizations and activities: one is endosome-associated and facilitates production of a repressor form of Ci (HSC-R), and one is Smo-associated and promotes Ci activation (HSC-A). In response to Hh and through interaction with Cos2, Smo mediates both inhibition of the endosome-associated HSC-R and activation of HSC-A at the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2038107765,"The CCAAT box is a widespread motif in eukaryotic promoters. In this study we demonstrate that the effects of the CCAAT box on γ-globin gene activation are developmentally distinct. Although this promoter element is essential for high level γ gene expression in adult erythropoiesis, it plays little role in embryonic erythroid cells. The CCAAT mutation in the human γ-globin gene promoter impairs recruitment of TATA-binding protein (TBP), TFIIB, and RNA polymerase II in adult splenic erythroblasts but not in embryonic erythroid cells. We also show that the efficiency of γ gene transcription is correlated with recruitment of TBP on the TATA box but that the level of TBP recruitment is not nuclear factor Y (NF-Y)-dependent. Our data also suggest that it is unlikely that transcriptional stimulation by the CCAAT box is exerted through direct protein-protein interaction between NF-Y and TBP."

If the nucleophile is (i) a polyamine (such as spermidine), a mono- or bis-(γ-glutamyl)spermidine linkage is formed; (ii) the ϵ-NH2 group of a protein-bound lysine residue, an isopeptide Nϵ-(γ-glutamyl)lysine cross-link is formed; (iii) water, the net result is deamidation of the glutamine (to glutamic acid); or (iv) the terminal ω-alcohol group of certain long chain epidermal-specific ceramide, a glutamate ester linkage results (14Nemes Z.

To date, six different TGases are expressed in epithelia and are thought to be involved in the assembly of the cell envelope. At least two different TGase enzymes are known to be required for effective barrier formation (4Melino G. De Laurenzi V. Catani M.V. Terrinoni A. Ciani B. Candi E. Marekov L. Steinert P.M.

Patterson Jr., M.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 1370-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 20Im M.J. Riek R.P. Graham R.M. J. Biol.

The GTP-bound TGase 2 appears to activate phospholipase Cδ1 by lowering the calcium requirement of phospholipase C for substrate hydrolysis (22Im M.J. Gray C. Rim A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8887-8894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Das T. Baek K.J. Gray C. Im M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27398-27405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and is therefore a crucial element for signal transduction (24Nakaoka H. Perez D.M. Baek K.J. Das T. Husain A. Misono K. Im M.J. Graham R.M. Science. 1994; 264: 1593-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). GTP binding by TGase 2 inhibits calcium binding resulting in the inhibition of TGase transamidation activity, whereas calcium binding inhibits GTP binding and activates the enzyme (25Achyuthan K.E. Mary A. Bhaerman R. Grenberg C.S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1989; 85: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Despite the availability of the TGase 2 structure bound to GDP (26Liu S. Cerione R.A. Clardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2002; 99: 2743-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), it remains unclear how calcium and GTP binding are able to reciprocally regulate the activity of the enzyme. The TGase 2 structure did not indicate the presence of bound divalent cations because of its inactive state. Here we present an extensive set of biochemical and crystallographic data showing how the TGase 3 enzyme interacts with GTP and with Ca2+/Mg2+. These data indicate for the first time that GTP binding is not restricted to the TGase 2 enzyme. Moreover, we show that TGase 3 is able to hydrolyze GTP to GDP effectively. The crystal structures of TGase 3 in the presence of the non-hydrolyzable GTP analog GTPγS at 2.1 Å and also GDP at 1.9 Å show three regions of switched conformations in comparison to our previous TGase 3 structure in the absence of guanine nucleotide (27Ahvazi B. Kim H.C. Kee S.H. Nemes Z. Steinert P.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2055-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 28Ahvazi B. Boeshans K.M. Idler W. Baxa U. Steinert P.M. J. Biol.

GTP binding is coordinated with a substitution of one of the three Ca2+-binding sites and other subtle changes that cause the closing of a central channel leading to the active site of the enzyme. Hydrolysis of GTP to GDP appears to impart a two-state conformation representing both the GTP-bound enzyme (the GTPγS-inactive state with Mg2+ ion at site 3/closed channel) and the non-nucleotide-bound enzyme (the active state with Ca2+ ion at site 3/open channel). Protein Expression, Purification, and Crystallization—Recombinant human TGase 3 was expressed in the baculovirus system and purified as described (29Kim H.C. Nemes Z. Idler W.W. Hyde C.C. Steinert P.M. Ahvazi B. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 135: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To prepare the active form, a 12-ml solution of zymogen (17 mg/ml in a buffer of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm EDTA and 125 mm NaCl) was treated with 3 mg of dispase (Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C for 30 min. However, the dispase contains significant amounts of Ca2+ ions. The protein was then passed through a MonoQ column, with a linear gradient of 0-500 mm NaCl, and eluted at 150 mm NaCl. The protein was extensively dialyzed against 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm EDTA and 125 mm NaCl. The TGase 3·GTPγS complex was made with 15 mg/ml proteolyzed TGase 3 with 0.575 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm GTPγS (a non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue). The TGase 3·GTP complex was made in similar fashion except the 1 mm GTPγS was replaced with 1 mm GTP salt. The crystallization trial conditions of both TGase 3·GTPγS and TGase 3·GTP complexes were performed using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method by adding the nonionic detergent β-octyl glucoside (0.1 mm) to 100 μl of protein in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, and 125 mm NaCl at a concentration of 15 mg/ml. To a fresh 2 μl of protein, 2 μl of precipitant solution was added and equilibrated over a well solution containing 4-10% (w/v) PEG 6K and 100 mm sodium Hepes (pH 7.0) at 21 °C for TGase 3·GTPγS complex. The TGase 3·GTP crystallization (15 mg/ml) was done using 0.1 mm cymal-6 in 100 μl of protein in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, and 125 mm NaCl. To a fresh 4 μl of protein, 2 μl of reservoir solution was added and equilibrated over a well solution containing 4-12% (w/v) PEG 6K, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) at 21 °C. The thin, plate-like crystals were harvested into mother liquor containing 20% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol as the cryoprotectant and were then flash-frozen at 100 K into liquid nitrogen with a rayon mounting loop (Oxford Cryosystems, Oxford, UK) prior to data collection. All data was collected at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratories, using beamline X9B, the ADSC Quantum 4 detector with a wavelength of 0.92 Å, crystal distance-to-detector of 170 mm, oscillation range of 1.0°, and exposure for 30 s for TGase 3·GTPγS complex; crystal distance-to-detector of 160 mm, oscillation range of 1.0°, and exposure for 40 s for TGase 3·GTP complex. The diffraction data from sets of crystals were indexed, processed, scaled, and merged using the HKL2000 suite of program (30Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The crystal structure of the TGase 3·GTPγS was solved by molecular replacement using AMoRe (31Navaza J. Saludjian P. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 581-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) and a resolution range of 10 to 3.5 Å for the rotation search and between 10 and 3.0 Å for the translation search. There were two solutions to both the rotation and translation searches. These solutions gave rise to two molecules within each asymmetric unit. The model of the TGase 3-activated enzyme (Protein Data Bank entry 1L9M; see Ref. 27Ahvazi B. Kim H.C. Kee S.H. Nemes Z. Steinert P.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2055-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) was used as the initial search model. The initial R factor after correctly orienting and positioning the two molecules was 33.5% for all the data from 10 to 3.0 Å resolution. The rigid body refinement using CNS (32Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar), followed by simulated annealing applying strict 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) constraints (33Kleywegt G.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 842-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) to 3.0 Å resolution, improved the solutions yielding a final R factor of 31.8%. At this stage a clear density for GTPγS was observed in 2|Fo| -|Fc|. Initial phases were further improved using solvent flattening (34Collaborative Computing Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) with 2-fold NCS molecular averaging (35Kleywegt G.J. Read R.J. Structure. 1997; 5: 1557-1569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). For final refinement, the NCS restraints were released. After many cycles of manual model rebuilding into SIGMAA-weighted 3|Fo| - 2|Fc| and|Fo| -|Fc| electron density maps (36Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar), the refinement converged at an R factor of 20.0% which included all low resolution data sets from 20 Å resolution as bulk solvent correction for 2.1 Å (with no σ cut-off) data set. In each cycle of refinement, model bias was avoided by calculating a composite-simulated annealing omit map, which was regularly used to verify, correct, or build the model. In order to avoid over-fitting of the model, each step of the rebuilding procedure was monitored using the free R factor and a residue real space correlation coefficient as a guide. Water molecules were included in the model based on hydrogen bonding and the presence of reproducible peaks in electron density maps based on their effects on the free R value. The two monomers of the preliminary model TGase 3·GTPγS complex without GTPγS nucleotide was used to refine against TGase 3·GTP complex data set. The model was refined in CNS (32Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) and with the simulated annealing, positional, and B factor refinement protocols using a maximum likelihood target (37Brunger A.T. Krukowski A. Erickson J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1990; 46: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Anisotropic scaling and a bulk solvent correction were used, and the individual B factors were refined isotopically. Except for the free R set (a random sampling consisting of 9.6% of the data set), all data between 20 and 1.9 Å (with no σ cut-off) were included in the refinement that was converged at an R factor of 20.50%. The GDP molecule was clearly identified in 2|Fo| -|Fc| map and was guided by simulated annealing omit map. The stereochemistry of both structures was analyzed with the programs PROCHECK (38Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl.

Microcalorimetric Titration Studies of Nucleotide Binding of TGase 3—The thermodynamic properties of nucleotide binding to the activated TGase 3 were measured at 30 °C by isothermal titration calorimetry using a Microcal VP-ITC calorimeter. Prior to measurements, the activated TGase 3 (6.8 μm) was dialyzed three times against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 1 mm standard CaCl2 solution (Fisher) was placed in a 1.38-ml sample cell. Three different nucleotides 0.19 mm GTPγS, 0.275 mm GTP, and 0.37 mm GDP were titrated against the activated TGase 3. The series of automatic injections started with 5 μl each into the protein solution and was followed with 10- and 20-μl aliquots using a 250-μl syringe, respectively. After each injection, a 5-min pause was allowed for reaching the base line. Heat produced due to dilution was measured by injecting the nucleotide solution into the sample cells from which TGase 3 protein was omitted. For each titration step, the heat of dilution was subtracted. Data were fitted to appropriate binding models and thermodynamic parameters were determined from nonlinear least squares fits, using ORIGIN™ software. TGase 3 Activity Assay—TGase activity was measured by incorporation of [14C]putrescine into casein (42Folk J.E. Cole P.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 122: 244-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Assays were done at 37 °C in 0.5-ml portions of 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), containing 1% N,N-dimethylated casein (Sigma), 0.5 μCi of putrescine (118 mCi/mmol), 1 mm DTT, 5 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm EDTA. Reactions blanks contained no added calcium. Reactions were stopped with the addition of ice-cold 7% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, and incorporated radioactivity was collected by filtration through GF/A glass fiber filters (Whatman) wet with ice-cold 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and successively washed three times with 5 ml of ice-cold 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. Filters were dried and solubilized in 5 ml of CytoScint (ICN). Inhibition assays contained 0-500 μm GTP at three different CaCl2 concentrations. TGase 3 Quantitative Metal Analyses—All plastic and glassware were incubated in 5 n HCl for a period of 36 h and rinsed with double distilled water that had been passed over a Chelex 100 column. For buffer and transition metal solutions, Chelex 100-treated water was used throughout. Prior to adjustment of the pH, Chelex 100 resin was added (0.5 g/100 ml), and the solution was stirred for 45 min; after adjustment of the pH, the solution was passed through a 0.2-μm filter and stored in metal-free plastic vials at -20 °C. Prior to measurements, the TGase 3 (10 mg/ml) was treated with dispase (Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C for 30 min and dialyzed five times against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 5 mm EGTA. The EGTA solution was removed by dialysis against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The bound metal ions were detected by use of a PerkinElmer Life Sciences ELAN 6100 inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry dynamic reaction cell (ICPMS-DRC) apparatus. The concentration of zymogen-treated with dispase was 1.5 mg/ml. TGase 3 GTPase Activity Assay—16 pmol of TGase 3 was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in a 150-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 0.375 μCi of [γ-32P]GTP (ATP) (Amersham Biosciences), 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.575 mm CaCl2. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 500 μl of ice-cold 5% (w/v) activated charcoal Norit PN.5 (BDH) in 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 7.5). The reactions were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 6 min at room temperature. The amount of 32Pi released from [γ-32P]GTP (ATP) was estimated by counting the radioactivity of 300 μl of the clear supernatants in 6 ml of CytoScint (ICN). TGase 3 GTP Binding Assay—16 pmol of TGase 3, 0.2 m sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), 2 mm EDTA, 0.005% sodium cholate, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm DTT, and Mg2+ were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. 1 μCi of GTPγ35S was added to the reaction mix and incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. The reaction was then placed on ice for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm MgCl2. Incorporated radioactivity was collected by filtration through nitrocellulose filters (BA85, Schleicher & Schuell) wet with ice-cold 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm MgCl2 and successively washed with three times with 5 ml of ice-cold 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm MgCl2. Filters were dried and solubilized in 5 ml of CytoScint (ICN). TGase 3 Binding and Regulation by Guanine Nucleotides—We reported previously (27Ahvazi B. Kim H.C. Kee S.H. Nemes Z. Steinert P.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2055-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) the crystal structure of zymogen and that of the activated form of TGase 3 enzyme. In the activated form, a β-octyl glucoside molecule used in the crystallization condition was observed in a hydrophobic pocket of the enzyme. The corresponding site in TGase 2 was reported to be involved in the binding to GDP (26Liu S. Cerione R.A. Clardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2002; 99: 2743-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wondered if TGase 3 could also bind directly to GTP and hydrolyze it to GDP. In that way, GTP hydrolysis might act as a molecular switch to regulate the activity of TGase 3. We measured directly the binding of TGase 3 to GTPγS, GTP, and GDP. These interactions were determined using recombinant, purified active TGase 3 enzyme and isothermal calorimetry (ITC) (see Fig. 1). In all cases, these guanine nucleotides bound to TGase 3 at a molar ratio of nearly 1:1. Moreover, the dissociation constants and heat of binding were similar for these different guanine nucleotides. The dissociation constants Kd = 1.6 ± 0.2 μm (ΔH = -10.3 ± 0.2 kcal/mol) for GTPγS, Kd = 1.8 ± 0.3 μm (ΔH = -9.6 ± 0.3 kcal/mol) for GTP, and Kd = 1.7 ± 0.4 μm (ΔH = -10.6 ± 0.2 kcal/mol) for GDP, respectively. We next investigated to what extent guanine nucleotides are able to regulate the activity of TGase 3. In TGase 2, GTP and calcium are known to reciprocally act on the enzyme, with GTP acting to inhibit the transglutaminase activity, whereas calcium stimulates this activity (24Nakaoka H. Perez D.M. Baek K.J. Das T. Husain A. Misono K. Im M.J. Graham R.M. Science. 1994; 264: 1593-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first determined the amount of divalent cation required for guanine nucleotide binding and hydrolysis of TGase 3 based on transamidation activity (Fig. 2, A and B). The data indicate that GTP is a potent inhibitor of the TGase 2 activity (Fig. 2C). In the presence of a lower concentration of Ca2+ ion, the TGase 3 is completely inhibited by micromolar concentrations of GTP (Fig. 2C). An increase in the concentration of Ca2+ in the assay mixture progressively suppresses the inhibition by GTP (Fig. 2C). The binding appears specific for the guanine nucleotide triphosphate. However, the data in Fig. 2D suggest that the relative inhibition of TGase 3 by nucleotide triphosphates is: ATPγS > ATP > GTPγS > GTP. We additionally investigated whether TGase 3 has any intrinsic GTPase activity (Fig. 2E). Interestingly, TGase 2 had been known to hydrolyze both ATP and GTP (21Iismaa S.E. Wu M.J. Nanda N. Church W.B. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18259-18265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested for both the GTPase and ATPase activities of TGase 3 in the presence of 1 mm Mg2+ and 0.575 mm Ca2+ (these divalent cation concentrations were identified to be optimal based on the data in Fig. 2, A and B). The data in Fig. 2E indicate that unlike TGase 2, TGase 3 exhibits very little ATPase activity in comparison to its GTPase activity. Furthermore, GTP hydrolysis appears to be Mg2+-dependent. In the presence of Mg2+, GTPase activity is 10-fold higher than ATPase activity. After the addition of 0.575 mm Ca2+ to the reaction, GTPase activity is 96-fold higher (Fig. 2E). TGase 3 was then assayed for its ability to irreversibly bind GTPγS using [γ-35S]GTPγS. The GTPγS nucleotide binds to TGase 3 at 1:1 ratio (the TGase 3 protein concentration used here was ∼75 μm) in the presence of 1 mm Mg2+ and 0.575 mm Ca2+ concentrations. Overall Architecture of TGase 3·GTPγS/GDP Complexes—We solved crystal structures of TGase 3·GTPγS and TGase 3·GDP complexes at 2.1 and 1.9 Å resolution, respectively. Except for the addition of guanine nucleotides, the crystallization conditions used here were nearly identical to those previously used to crystallize this enzyme in the absence of nucleotide, and these conditions include the presence of 0.575 mm Ca2+ and 1 mm Mg2+ (28Ahvazi B. Boeshans K.M. Idler W. Baxa U. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23834-23841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the overall architectures and binding sites for the GTPγS and GDP molecules. Both the GTPγS and GDP crystals contained two independent subunits of 692 residues within their asymmetric units. The arrangement of the two subunits in these complexes is identical, and the same one was reported earlier for the activated TGase 3 enzyme in the absence of guanine nucleotide (27Ahvazi B. Kim H.C. Kee S.H. Nemes Z. Steinert P.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2055-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 28Ahvazi B. Boeshans K.M. Idler W. Baxa U. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23834-23841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The two subunits in each of the current structures lack density for a flexible loop between residues 462-478 in subunit A and 460-472 in subunit B. This flexible hinge region harbors Ser469-Ser470, the cleavage site used for proteolytic activation of the TGase 3 zymogen.

https://openalex.org/W2045297932,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ectoshedding of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HBEGF), an EGFR ligand, have been linked to the development of cardiac myocyte hypertrophy. However, the precise role that the liganded EGFR plays in the transcriptional activation of the gene program that accompanies hypertrophy remains undefined. Utilizing the human (h) BNP gene as a model of hypertrophy-dependent gene activation, we show that activation of the EGFR plays an important role in mediating mechanical strain-dependent stimulation of the hBNP promoter. Strain promotes endothelin (ET) generation through NAD(P)H oxidase-dependent production of reactive oxygen species. ET in turn induces metalloproteinase-mediated cleavage of pro-HBEGF and ectoshedding of HBEGF, which activates the EGFR and stimulates hBNP promoter activity. HBEGF also stimulates other phenotypic markers of hypertrophy including protein synthesis and sarcomeric assembly. The antioxidant N-acetylcysteine or the NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor, apocynin, inhibited strain-dependent activation of the ET-1 promoter, HBEGF shedding, and hBNP promoter activation. The metalloproteinase inhibitor, GM-6001, prevented the induction of HBEGF ectoshedding and the hBNP promoter response to strain, suggesting a critical role for the metalloproteinase-dependent cleavage event in signaling the strain response. These findings suggest that metalloproteinase activity as an essential step in this pathway may prove to be a relevant therapeutic target in the management of cardiac hypertrophy.

These findings suggest that metalloproteinase activity as an essential step in this pathway may prove to be a relevant therapeutic target in the management of cardiac hypertrophy. In response to increased hemodynamic load, cardiac myocytes undergo hypertrophic growth. Initially, this hypertrophy is compensatory, allowing the heart to maintain pump function and cardiac output in the face of the increased work requirement. However, with time, this process becomes maladaptive, leading to cardiac decompensation and, eventually, heart failure (1Sugden P.H. Clerk A. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 725-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). In fact, ventricular hypertrophy is an independent risk factor for arrhythmias, sudden death, and heart failure (2Ho K.K. Pinsky J.L. Kannel W.B. Levy D. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1993; 22: 6A-13ACrossref PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar, 3Levy D. Garrison R.J. Savage D.D. Kannel W.B. Castelli W.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 322: 1561-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (4876) Google Scholar). At the cellular level, myocyte hypertrophy is characterized by an increase in cell size and protein synthesis, increased sarcomeric assembly, and changes in gene expression (4Chien K.R. Knowlton K.U. Zhu H. Chien S. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). The latter includes sequential activation of immediate early response genes (e.g. protooncogenes such as c-fos and c-jun), a fetal gene program (e.g. atrial natriuretic peptide, skeletal α-actin, and β-myosin heavy chain), and sarcomeric genes (e.g. cardiac α-actin and myosin light chain-2) (4Chien K.R. Knowlton K.U. Zhu H. Chien S. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Activation of the fetal gene program is one of the most consistent markers of cardiac myocyte hypertrophy. Genes within this group are usually expressed in late embryonic and early neonatal life. In the adult, these genes are quiescent under normal conditions but can be activated following exposure to hypertrophic stimuli such as hemodynamic load. Thus, reactivation of these genes represents a reliable marker for induction of the hypertrophic process, either in vitro (5Liang F. Wu J. Garami M. Gardner D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28050-28056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) or in vivo (6Hasegawa K. Fujiwara H. Doyama K. Miyamae M. Fujiwara T. Suga S. Mukoyama M. Nakao K.

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) belongs to the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases (12Olayioye M.A. Neve R.M. Lane H.A. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3159-3167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are four members of the ErbB family: EGFR/ErbB1/HER1, ErbB2/HER2/neu, ErbB3/HER3, and ErbB4/HER4. Ligands of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family bind to the ErbB receptors resulting in homodimerization or heterodimerization and subsequent autophosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domains of the receptors. This leads to the binding of adapter proteins and subsequent activation of downstream signaling pathways that define receptor biological activity. In vertebrates, these ligands exhibit some specificity. Major ligands for the EGFR include EGF, transforming growth factor-α, amphiregulin, and heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HBEGF) (13Tzahar E. Yarden Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1377: M25-M37PubMed Google Scholar). HBEGF has attracted particular interest as a signaling intermediate in G-protein-coupled receptor signal transduction (14Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar, 15Eguchi S. Dempsey P.J. Frank G.D. Motley E.D. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7957-7962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The generation of HBEGF results from metalloproteinase-dependent cleavage of HBEGF from its membrane anchor (ectoshedding). This cleavage event is linked through a mechanism that is only partially understood to G-protein-coupled receptor occupancy (14Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). Soluble HBEGF is then free to associate with EGFR and promote local autocrine/paracrine effects in the same or in neighboring cells. HBEGF transactivates the EGFR in response to G-protein-coupled ligands such as ET-1 (14Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar, 15Eguchi S. Dempsey P.J. Frank G.D. Motley E.D. Inagami T. J. Biol.

HBEGF also plays a critical role in normal heart development. Iwamoto et al. (17Iwamoto R. Yamazaki S. Asakura M. Takashima S. Hasuwa H. Miyado K. Adachi S. Kitakaze M. Hashimoto K. Raab G. Nanba D.

Neonatal rat cardiac myocytes have provided a useful model to investigate myocyte hypertrophy that develops following exposure to pharmacological (e.g. α-adrenergic agonists, endothelin) (18Knowlton K.U.

We have previously reported that applying mechanical strain to neonatal rat cardiac myocytes activates the human BNP gene promoter (5Liang F. Wu J. Garami M. Gardner D.G. J. Biol.

The EGFR has been implicated in the development of myocyte hypertrophy in vitro and the development of load-dependent cardiac hypertrophy in vivo (16Asakura M. Kitakaze M. Takashima S. Liao Y. Ishikura F. Yoshinaka T. Ohmoto H. Node K. Yoshino K. Ishiguro H. Asanuma H. Sanada S. Matsumura Y. Takeda H. Beppu S. Tada M. Hori M. Higashiyama S. Nat.

However, the precise role that the EGFR plays in activation of the hypertrophic gene program remains undefined. We have investigated the involvement of liganded EGFR in the process linking mechanical strain to stimulation of the human (h)BNP gene promoter. We have established that this linkage exists and that it requires the participation of both reactive oxygen species and endothelin at different points in the signaling cascade. Materials—Recombinant human HBEGF was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Recombinant human EGF was obtained from Invitrogen. AG-1296, AG-1478, and apocynin were from Calbiochem. GM-6001 was from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). N-acetylcysteine was from Sigma. ET-1 was from American Peptide Company, Inc. (Sunnyvale, CA). Polyclonal antibodies against the EGFR and HBEGF were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20) antibody was obtained from CRP, Inc. (Denver, PA). Monoclonal anti-sarcomeric α-actinin (EA-53) antibody was from Sigma. Cell Culture and Application of Mechanical Stretch—Ventricular myocytes were prepared from 1-day-old neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats by alternate cycles of 0.05% trypsin digestion and mechanical disruption as described previously (32Wu J. LaPointe M.C. West B.L. Gardner D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6472-6479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured on collagen I-coated Flex plates (Flexcell International Corp., McKeesport, PA) in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (H21) containing 10% enriched calf serum (Gemini Bioproducts, Woodland, CA), 2 mm glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin for 24 h post-isolation. A glass-cloning cylinder (1 cm in diameter) was placed in the center of each well to preclude cell attachment, thereby positioning the majority of adherent cells on the outer 75% of the culture surface where distension is maximal (33Banes A.J. Gilbert J. Taylor D. Monbureau O. J. Cell Sci. 1985; 75: 35-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following intervention (transfection and/or pharmacological treatment), cells were subjected to cyclical stretch (60 Hz) on the FX3000 unit (Flexcell International Corp.) at a level of distension sufficient to promote a calculated increment in surface area of ∼20% at the point of maximal distension on the culture surface (33Banes A.J. Gilbert J. Taylor D. Monbureau O. J. Cell Sci. 1985; 75: 35-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein Synthesis—Protein synthesis was assessed by measuring [3H]leucine incorporation in cultured ventricular myocytes. Freshly isolated cells were cultured in 24-well plates for 24 h and then changed to serum-free medium and subjected to treatment as indicated in Fig. 5A for 48 h. Cells were pulsed with [3H]leucine in leucine-free medium for the final 4 h of the treatment period, washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and extracted with 10% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C for 30 min. Cell residues were rinsed in 95% ethanol, solubilized in 0.25 n NaOH for 2 h, and neutralized with 2.5 mm HCl in 1 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. Immunostaining—Ventricular myocytes were cultured in 4-chamber slides for 24 h, changed to serum-free medium, and then subjected to the indicated treatments for 48 h. Cells were then washed with PBS and fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min followed by PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 2 min. Slides were blocked with PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 0.1 μg/ml normal horse IgG for 1 h and incubated with mouse anti-rat sarcomeric α-actinin antibody (EA-53) in the above blocking solution at room temperature for 1 h. Cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with Texas Red-conjugated horse anti-mouse secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories) at room temperature for 1 h. After three consecutive washes, slides were mounted with VectorShield mounting medium and viewed using fluorescence microscopy. Cell surface areas of individual cells were quantified using OpenLab (Improvision) planimetry software from two-dimensional images. Wild-type and Mutant Plasmids—The construction of -1595 and -904 human hBNP-luciferase has been described previously (34LaPointe M.C. Wu G. Garami M. Yang X.P. Gardner D.G. Hypertension. 1996; 27: 715-722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To generate -1315 rat ET-1-luciferase, oligonucleotide primers with sequences 5′-GTCAATGTGCTTTATGTGTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCACCGGAGCGCAAAGCGTC-3′ (antisense) were used to amplify a genomic fragment extending from -1315 to +100 in the human ET gene (35Paul M. Zintz M. Bocker W. Dyer M. Hypertension. 1995; 25: 683-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). KpnI (sense) and BglII (antisense) restriction sites were added to the respective 5′ borders to facilitate subcloning. PCR products of the expected size were cut with KpnI and BglII and subcloned into KpnI/BglI-cut pGL3, a promoter-less luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI). Transfection and Luciferase Assay—18–24 h following isolation, cardiac myocytes (106) were transiently co-transfected with 0.5 μg of the indicated BNP luciferase reporters and 0.05 μg of actin-β-galactosidase using Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen) under conditions recommended by the manufacturer. 18–24 h post-transfection, cells were changed to serum-free medium and maintained for 24 h prior to experimentation. At the end of the appropriate intervention, cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed with lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured using the luciferase assay system (Promega). β-Galactosidase activity was assayed using the Galactolight Plus chemiluminescence assay (Tropix, Bedford, MA). For each well, luciferase levels were normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Cells were harvested in 1 ml of PBS, centrifuged briefly, lysed under denaturing conditions (50 mm Hepes at pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm glycerophosphate), and centrifuged at 12,800 × g for 10 min. 250 μg of supernatant protein was incubated with 2.5 μg of anti-EGFR antibody and protein A-agarose (Invitrogen) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times, boiled, electrophoresed on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred electrophoretically onto polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Membranes were incubated with monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (1:1000 dilution) in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 (TBST) buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 5% nonfat milk) overnight at 4 °C and then washed with TBST buffer. Membranes were later incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody for 1 h at room temperature and washed with TBST. Blots were immersed for 1 min in ECL detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to film. Signals were quantified using a Kodak Image Station (Model 440CF). Membranes were then immersed in stripping buffer (100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7) for 1 h at 70 °C followed by extensive washing. Stripped membranes were incubated with rabbit anti-EGFR antibody (1:250 dilution) in TBST overnight at 4 °C, washed, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Signals were detected as described above. Measurement of HBEGF—Cultured myocytes were deprived of serum for 24 h and then cultured in phenol red-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium H21. Following the experimental interventions indicated, medium was collected and concentrated using a Centricon centrifugal filter device (YM-3, Millipore). Samples were centrifuged at 6500 × g for at least 3 h until volume was reduced from 4 to 0.5 ml. Concentrates were incubated with 2.5 μg of anti-HBEGF antibody and protein A-agarose overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times, boiled, and electrophoresed on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Using conventional Western immunoblotting techniques as described above, HBEGF levels were assessed using goat polyclonal anti-HBEGF IgG and donkey anti-goat IgG. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA using Student-Newman-Keuls or Bonferroni Multiple Comparison post-hoc tests as applicable. Application of cyclic mechanical strain to cultured neonatal myocytes for 5 min activated the EGFR (Fig. 1). Western blots of EGFR immunoprecipitates demonstrated a strain-dependent increase in the phosphotyrosine content of a 170-kDa protein that co-migrated with the EGFR itself (Fig. 1A). Pooled data from three independent experiments indicated that mechanical strain increased phosphorylation of EGFR by 287 ± 13% compared with static control levels (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1B), whereas there was no change in absolute levels of EGFR protein (Fig. 1C). The ability of the EGFR inhibitor, AG-1478, to abrogate strain-dependent phosphorylation of the EGFR (Fig. 1, A and B) suggests that strain stimulates the intrinsic kinase activity of EGFR, leading to autophosphorylation of the receptor. In some systems, activation of the EGFR has been shown to result from cleavage of HBEGF from its membrane anchor (ectoshedding) and subsequent occupancy of the receptor by this ligand (14Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). We asked whether cyclic strain increased HBEGF ectoshedding in our myocyte cultures. As shown in Fig. 2A, strain effected a time-dependent increase in HBEGF levels in the culture medium. The increase was detectable at 5 min, peaked after 15 min at 477 ± 87% of static control levels (p < 0.01), and began to normalize after 30 min of mechanical strain. A component of the strain effect on the hBNP promoter involves the local generation of the vasoactive peptide ET (28Liang F. Gardner D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14612-14619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 30Liang F. Lu S. Gardner D.G. Hypertension. 2000; 35: 188-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which can account for 50–85% of the strain response. 2H. D. I. Anderson, F. Wang, and D. G. Gardner, unpublished observations. ET-1 has been shown previously to activate the EGFR (16Asakura M. Kitakaze M. Takashima S. Liao Y. Ishikura F. Yoshinaka T. Ohmoto H. Node K. Yoshino K. Ishiguro H. Asanuma H. Sanada S. Matsumura Y. Takeda H. Beppu S. Tada M. Hori M. Higashiyama S. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether ET-1 would promote HBEGF ectoshedding from cardiac myocytes in our cultures. Treating cardiac myocytes with ET-1 did in fact increase HBEGF secretion into the medium to 500 ± 128% of control levels (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2B), raising the possibility that ET plays a role upstream of HBEGF secretion in the strain-dependent signaling pathway. We next asked whether HBEGF can activate the hBNP promoter directly. As shown in Fig. 3, both EGF (Fig. 3A) and HBEGF (Fig. 3B) significantly increased hBNP promoter activity, implying that HBEGF-dependent activation of EGFR plays a role in mediating strain-dependent activation of the hBNP promoter. To address this question more directly, we examined the effect of the EGFR inhibitor AG-1478 on strain-dependent hBNP promoter activation. The strain increased hBNP promoter activity to 369 ± 58% versus the static control (p < 0.001). This increase was completely abolished by AG-1478 (Fig. 4), demonstrating a requirement for activated EGFR in promoter induction. In contrast, strain-dependent hBNP promoter activity remained intact in the presence of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor kinase inhibitor, AG-1296 (Fig. 4), implying specificity in the signaling mechanism linking strain to the BNP transcriptional response.Fig. 4Role of the EGFR in activation of the BNP promoter by mechanical strain. Cardiac myocytes were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of -1595 hBNP-luciferase and 0.05 μg of actin β-galactosidase. 18–24 h post-transfection, cells were deprived of serum for 24 h and then pretreated with the EGFR inhibitor AG-1478 (250 nm) or the platelet-derived growth factor receptor inhibitor AG-1296 (25 μm) for 1 h. Myocytes were then subjected to a static or strain environment for 48 h in the presence of the relevant inhibitor as indicated, processed, and assayed for luciferase activity.

We next explored the role of endogenous ET in signaling the strain-dependent increase in HBEGF in the myocyte cultures. We have reported previously that ∼60% of the BNP promoter response to strain is dependent upon local generation of ET in the myocyte cultures (28Liang F. Gardner D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14612-14619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Our subsequent studies have indicated that the ET contribution to the strain response can be as high as 85% in some cultures.2 The results presented in Fig. 6A indicate a dominant role for ET in generating the response to strain in these cultures. Strain led to an ∼2.3-fold increment in BNP promoter activity. BQ 610, a type A ET receptor antagonist, effected a reduction in basal promoter activity (∼55% inhibition) and nearly completely blocked the response to strain. The strain led to an ∼9-fold increase in HBEGF levels in this series of experiments (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, although BQ 610 had little effect on basal HBEGF levels, it virtually eliminated the induction by mechanical strain. Furthermore, the induction of BNP promoter by ET-1 (∼13-fold in this study) was nearly completely blocked by the EGFR inhibitor AG-1478 (Fig. 6C). Collectively, these data demonstrate that endogenous ET plays a major role in contributing to the strain-dependent induction of the hBNP promoter and that it does so by increasing the generation of HBEGF. If strain-dependent activation of the hBNP promoter requires activation of the EGFR, inhibition of metalloproteinase-mediated cleavage of membrane-bound pro-HBEGF might be predicted to abrogate the promoter induction. Pretreatment of cardiac myocytes with the metalloproteinase inhibitor GM-6001 prevented strain-dependent secretion of HBEGF (Fig. 7A) and attenuated hBNP promoter activation in response to strain (Fig. 7B), suggesting that metalloproteinase activity is required for the latter response.

https://openalex.org/W2082290635,"Volvatoxin A2 (VVA2), a novel pore-forming cardiotoxic protein was isolated from the mushroom Volvariella volvacea. We identified an N-terminal fragment (NTF) (1-127 residues) of VVA2 as a domain for oligomerization by limited tryptic digestion. On preincubation of NTF with VVA2, NTF was found to inhibit VVA2 hemolytic activity by inducing VVA2 oligomerization in the solution in the same manner as liposomes. By site-directed mutagenesis, the amphipathic α-helix B of NTF or VVA2 was shown to be indispensable for its biological functions. Interestingly, at a molar ratio of recombinant NTF (reNTF)/VVA2 as low as 0.01, reNTF was able to inhibit VVA2 hemolytic activity and induce VVA2 oligomerization. This indicates that reNTF can trigger VVA2 oligomerization by a seeding effect. Furthermore, the recombinant C-terminal fragment (128-199 residues) was found to be a functional domain that mediates the membrane binding of VVA2. We found a fragment localized at the C-terminal half of VVA2 containing β6, -7, and -8, which is protected from protease digestion because of its insertion of a membrane. We also identified a putative heparin binding site (HBS) located in the VVA2 C terminus (166-194 residues), which was conserved among 10 kinds of snake venom cardiotoxins. VVA2 or the reHBS fragment was shown to interact with sulfated glycoaminoglycans by affinity column chromatography. The finding of a higher number of glycoaminoglycans in the membrane of cardiac myocytes suggested that they could be the specific membrane target for VVA2. Taken together, these findings indicate that VVA2 contains two functional domains, NTF and CTF. The NTF domain is responsible for VVA2 oligomerization and the CTF domain for membrane binding and insertion. Our results support a model whereby the formation of VVA2 oligomeric pre-pore complexes precedes their membrane insertion.

Slade A.M. Lin J.Y. Nayler W.G. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1976; 8: 501-519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). VVA is composed of VVA1 and VVA2, of which only VVA2 is endowed with hemolytic and cytotoxic activity (1Lin J.Y. Jeng T.W. Chen C.C. Shi G.Y. Tung T.C. Nature. 1973; 246: 524-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Our previous studies showed that VVA2 consists of 199 amino acid residues without cysteine residues, and that it forms pores in response to its oligomer formation in human erythrocyte membranes and liposomes. This toxic protein also permeabilized the cell membrane and allowed the passage of 70-kDa dextran rhodamine B into cultured Xenopus myocytes. Furthermore, conformational changes occurred when VVA2 interacted with liposomes (2Weng, Y. P. (2000) in Proceedings of Taiwan Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, November 3-5, 2000, p. 49, Taipei, TaiwanGoogle Scholar). Naturally occurring hemolytic toxic proteins can be classified into three groups based on their mechanisms of lysis of red blood cells: (a) pore forming, (b) enzymatic degradation of membrane lipids, and (c) solubilizing cell membrane by a detergentlike action (4Rowe G.E. Welch R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Several hemolytic toxic proteins isolated from microorganisms are pore-forming proteins that require oligomerization and specific membrane targets for pore formation such as cholesterol, integrin, and glycophosphatidylinositol (5Shatursky O.

They can be divided into α pore-forming toxins or β pore-forming toxins according to the insertion structure of α-helices or a β-barrel (8Heuck A.P. Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9065-9073Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Two models of pore formation by the toxic protein have been proposed: (a) Palmer et al. (9Palmer M. Harris R. Freytag C. Kehoe M. Tranum-Jensen J. Bhakdi S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1598-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) proposed an assembly model for streptolysin O, a member of the family of cholesterol-dependent cytolysins, in which the pore formation is initiated by insertion of a small oligomeric complex of streptolysin O into the membrane and then enlarged in a progressive manner by the addition of soluble toxin monomers; (b) Hotze et al.

The relationships between structure and function of pore-forming toxins have been studied extensively. The α-hemolysin produced by Staphylococcus aureus is divided into three domains: the rim, cap, and stem responsible for its membrane binding, oligomerization, and insertion, respectively (11Menestrina G. Serra M.D. Prevost G. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Perfringolysin O, another member of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins family, the function of membrane binding is assigned to domain 4, oligomerization to domain 1, and insertion to domain 3 (5Shatursky O.

We demonstrated that VVA2 contains a site involved in heparin binding on the cell membrane (HBS, 166-194 residues), which is conserved among cardiotoxins isolated from snake venoms (14Vyas A.A.

The amphipathic α-helix B (78-86 residues) of the N-terminal fragment (NTF, 1-127 residues), either as an isolated fragment, NTF, or in the intact VVA2 molecule, was shown to be crucial for VVA2 oligomerization. A C-terminal fragment (CTF, 128-199 residues) with a pI value of 9.6 was shown to mediate its membrane binding. Moreover, the insertion domain of VVA2 was identified by its transmembrane β-barrel in CTF. Altogether, our results provide insight supportive of the pre-pore model as the cytolytic mechanism of VVA2. Materials Taq—DNA polymerase and pGEM-T vector were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, pTYB2 vector, and chitin beads were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The Marathon cDNA amplification kit was from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and cholesterol were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL).

The Rapid Translation System RTS 500 Escherichia coli circular template kit and complete protease inhibitor mixture were from Roche Applied Science. VVA2 was isolated from the fruit body of Volvariella volvacea, grass mushrooms, as described previously (1Lin J.Y. Jeng T.W. Chen C.C. Shi G.Y. Tung T.C. Nature. 1973; 246: 524-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Preparation of Lipid Vesicles—To obtain multilamellar vesicles for membrane-bound proteolysis analysis, cholesterol was mixed with 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (1:2, mol/mol) in chloroform, dried under a stream of nitrogen, and evaporated in a rotary evaporator. The dry lipid film was hydrated and dispersed by Hepes-buffered saline (10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl), pH 7.4, to give a final lipid concentration of 10 μmol/ml. Small unilamellar vesicles for BIAcore assay were extruded 15 times through a 50-nm polycarbonate filter, sonicated by a sonifier, centrifuged at 108,000 × g for 25 min at 15 °C, and further spun at 60,000 × g for 3 h to remove large unilamellar vesicles. Liposome was quantitated by the method of Bartlett (16Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteolysis of VVA2 and Liposome-bound VVA2—Limited protease digestion was carried out by treating VVA2 (30 μg) with N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethylketone (TPCK)-trypsin or Nα-p-tosyl-l-ly-sine chloromethylketone chymotrypsin (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature for 1 h, using an enzyme/substrate ratio (w/w) of 0.1. The reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer, and then boiling at 95 °C for 5 min. Finally, the reaction products were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. The proteolytic fragment was isolated from the gel with a gel elutor (model 422 Electro-Elutor, Bio-Rad) and its molecular weight was determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) (Finnigan MAT LCQ). Proteolysis of membrane-bound VVA2 was performed as described by Du et al. (17Du J. Knowles B.H. Li J. Ellar D.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 185-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, VVA2 (50 μg) was preincubated with multilamellar vesicles in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 37 °C for 1 h, and then the VVA2-liposome complex was washed three times with PBS to remove unbound VVA2. For protease K, Pronase, and subtilisin digestion, liposome-bound VVA2 was treated with the proteases at a ratio of 1:5 (w/w, liposome bound VVA2:protease) at 37 °C for 1 h. After washing the digested VVA2-liposome complex three times with PBS, the membrane-bound fragments were analyzed by 16.5% Tricine SDS-PAGE (18Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar). The peptides were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and the amino acid sequence of the peptide was determined with an ABI 476 A sequencer. cDNA Cloning of VVA2 and Construction of Expression Vectors for the Various Mutants of VVA2—The poly(A) mRNA was isolated from the total cellular RNAs on an oligo(dT)-cellulose column (19Lin W.H. Hung C.H. Hsu C.I. Lin J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20044-20048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and poly(A)-rich mRNA was reverse transcribed with the Marathon cDNA amplification kit. The cDNAs were ligated to Marathon cDNA adaptors for 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends, and used as the template for the subsequent PCR amplification. For the first PCR, VVA2 cDNA was amplified with sense adaptor primer-1 (AP-1) and antisense degenerate primer A, corresponding to amino acids 137-143. VVA2 cDNA was then amplified by PCR with sense degenerate primer B corresponding to amino acids 123-129 and antisense primer adaptor primer-1. The DNA sequence of the products obtained from the first and second PCR steps was used to design gene-specific primers 1 and 2, which correspond to the first eight N-terminal and last eight C-terminal amino acids, respectively. The VVA2 cDNA was obtained by PCR amplification with sense gene-specific primer 1 and antisense gene-specific primer 2 (Fig. 1A). NTF and CTF constructs were obtained by PCR using VVA2 cDNA as a template and the 5′ primers were designed in-frame with the NdeI site. NTF α-helix B mutant I82E/L86K (NTF I82E/L86K), and VVA2 I82E/L86K constructs were generated by PCR site-directed mutagenesis (20Liu C.L. Tsai C.C. Lin S.C. Wang L.I. Hsu C.I. Hwang M.J. Lin J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1897-1901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The double cleaved fragments obtained by digestion with NdeI and SmaI were ligated to a pTYB2 vector for expression of NTF or NTF I82E/L86K in E. coli or a pIVEX 2.3 MCS vector for expression of VVA2 I82E/L86K or CTF in the E. coli cell-free system. The VVA2 heparin binding site fragment (HBSF) (165-199 residues) expression vector was constructed as follows. HBSF was first amplified by PCR with the 5′ primer behind a BamHI and the 3′ primer with a stop codon following an EcoRI, and the PCR product was inserted into the BamHI-EcoRI site of the pGEX-2T vector for expression. Expression of Various Mutants of reVVA2—For expression of recombinant NTF (reNTF) and reNTF I82E/L86K, the expression vectors were transformed into E. coli strain ER2566, and grown aerobically in Luria-Bertani medium at 37 °C. When the density of culture reached A600 nm = 0.7, isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.3 mm, and the growth was continued with shaking at 15 °C for 16 h. The cells were lysed by ultrasonication with lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20, and complete protease inhibitor mixture. After centrifugation at 39,191 × g at 4 °C for 30 min, the supernatant was incubated with chitin beads, and the on-column bound proteins were cleaved with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm dithiothreitol at 4 °C for 16 h (21Chong S. Mersha F.B. Comb D.G. Scott M.E. Landry D. Vence L.M. Perler F.B. Benner J. Kucera R.B. Hirvonen C.A. Pelletier J.J. Paulus H. Xu M.Q. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 192: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). The protein fractions were further purified on a Superdex 75 column (1 × 30 cm) equilibrated with PBS using a FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). To avoid cytotoxicity or formation of inclusion bodies of expression proteins, the expression of reVVA2 I82E/L86K or reCTF in vitro was performed with a Rapid Translation System RTS 500, which utilizes an enhanced E. coli lysate for an in vitro transcription/translation reaction (22Martin G.A. Kawaguchi R. Lam Y. DeGiovanni A. Fukushima M. Mutter W. BioTechniques. 2001; 31 (952-953): 948-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out at 28 °C for 24 h and then the reaction mixtures were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was adjusted to 300 mm NaCl and 1 mm imidazole, and then 0.5 ml of a 50% slurry of nickel-nitriloacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Germany) was added to the mixtures, and incubated by rotating at 4 °C for 6 h. The reaction products were loaded onto the column (10 × 5 mm), washed with 10 column volumes of wash buffer containing 15 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl, and 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, and then eluted with elution buffer consisting of 50 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm imidazole, and 300 mm NaCl. To prepare reHBSF, the expression plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain TG1. After growth to the density A600 nm = 0.5, the cells were induced with 0.01 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the culture was further incubated for 3 h. The glutathione S-transferase-HBSF fusion protein was then subjected to affinity purification with glutathione-agarose beads, and the purified fusion protein was digested with thrombin at room temperature for 16 h. The reaction products were purified with a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (10 × 5 mm). The homogeneity of HBSF was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and amino acid sequence analysis. All protein concentrations were measured by the bicinchoninic acid method (23Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J.

Hemolysis Assay—Human red blood cells were diluted to a concentration of 2 × 108 cells/ml in PBS, and 0.2 ml of reaction mixtures containing 0.1 ml of washed red blood cells and 0.1 ml of various concentrations of VVA2, reVVA2 I82E/L86K, reNTF, reNTF I82E/L86K, or reCTF were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min, and hemolytic activity was quantitated using 96-well tissue culture plates and measuring the absorbance of the supernatant at 540 nm (24Sangha N. Kaur S. Sharma V. Krishnasastry M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9193-9199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). 100% hemolysis was defined as the same volume of human red blood cell solution in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100. GAGs Affinity Chromatography—Affinity column chromatography was performed on a column (0.7 × 2.5 cm) containing 1 ml of various sulfated glycoaminoglycan (GAG) gels at 4 °C. VVA2 (100 μg) or reHBSF (200 μg) was applied onto the column pre-equilibrated with 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4, or 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, respectively. The column was washed with the equilibration buffer described above until absorbance at 280 or 212 nm of the eluate returned to baseline, and the column was then eluted with a linear gradient of 0-0.5 m NaCl at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using an ÄKTA purifier system (Amersham Biosciences). Binding Analysis by Biosensor—Real time protein-protein or proteinlipid interactions were examined using a BIAcore X instrument (BIAcoreAB, Uppsala, Sweden). For protein-protein interactions, immobilization of VVA2 on the surface of the CM5 sensor chip was performed following the standard amine coupling procedure with minor modifications. Briefly, the chip surface was first activated by injection of 75 μl of 1:1 mixture of 0.39 m N-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride and 0.1 m N-hydroxysuccinimide. The flow of VVA2, 200 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, over the chip surface occurred at a rate of 5 μl/min. The remaining N-hydroxysuccinimide esters were blocked by injection of 1 m ethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 8.5. Control flow cells were prepared by carrying out the coupling reaction in the presence of coupling buffer alone. Binding assays were performed at 25 °C in 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.005% (v/v) P20 surfactant (HBS-EP buffer, BIAcoreAB) containing various concentrations (1000, 375, 188, 93, and 47 nm) of reNTF or reNTF I82E/L86K at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. The lipid bilayers were formed in a hydrophobic chip L1 that is suitable for the study of hydrophobic interactions (25Erb E.M. Chen X. Allen S. Roberts C.J. Tendler S.J. Davies M.C. Forsen S. Anal.

Then, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin was used to block nonspecific binding at a flow rate of 50 μl/min for 1 min. Various concentrations of reVVA2 I82E/L86K, reNTF, or reCTF over a range of 3 to 0.125 μm in 10 mm Hepes-buffered saline, pH 7.4, were injected for 5 min at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. The sensor chips were regenerated after each cycle of measurement by injecting 50 μl of 20 mm NaOH. Sensorgrams were then subtracted from control sensorgrams obtained with reference surface to yield true binding responses. All sensorgrams were analyzed by using BIAevaluation software, version 3.0. Kinetic constants were obtained from the association and dissociation curves generated from various concentrations of analytes using the 1:1 binding model (A + B = AB) available in the software. Molecular Cloning and Structural Characteristics of VVA2— The cloned cDNA contained the coding region of VVA2 with 651 nucleotides, and the amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA nucleotide sequence was identical to that previously determined by protein sequencing (Fig. 1A) (2Weng, Y. P. (2000) in Proceedings of Taiwan Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, November 3-5, 2000, p. 49, Taipei, TaiwanGoogle Scholar). A BLAST search of the protein data bank revealed that partial homology (48.7%) exists between VVA2 and CytB isolated from Bacillus thuringiensis (26Li J. Koni P.A. Ellar D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 129-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). CytB consists of an outer layer of helix hairpins flanked by several β-strands, which were suggested for membrane insertion (17Du J. Knowles B.H. Li J. Ellar D.J. Biochem.

Heparin Binding Site of VVA2—Interestingly, there is a putative heparin binding sequence in VVA2: -Lys166-Thr-(X3)-Gly(X6)-Lys-(X12)-Val-Lys-Lys-Gly194-, which is similar to that of 10 kinds of cardiotoxin, -Lys12-Thr-(X3)-Gly-(X5)-Lys-(X10)Val-Lys-Arg-Gly37-, in that eight amino acid residues were conserved among them (14Vyas A.A.

The binding of GAGs to VVA2 or reHBSF was assessed by affinity column chromatography, and the results indicated that both VVA2 and reHBSF bound to the HiTrap heparin column. VVA2 was eluted at 0.27 M NaCl and reHBSF at 0.12 M NaCl (Fig. 2B, Table I). Similar results were obtained when chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate-Sepharose columns were used (Table I). In addition, preincubation of VVA2 with heparin abolished VVA2 oligomerization by liposomes, whereas dextran did not (Fig. 2C). Because cardiac myocytes contain a higher amount of GAGs on the cell membrane, it suggests that the HBS located at β-strands 7, 8, and α-helix D of VVA2 plays an important role in its cardiotoxicity (15Patel H.V.

A fragment (Fig. 3A, lane 2) with a molecular mass of 14,236 Da analyzed by ESI-MS was obtained (data not shown), and the cleavage site was found to be at Lys127, which was designated as NTF, whereas the fragment 128-199, was CTF (Fig. 3B). A fragment was also obtained by TLCK-chymotrypsin digestion (Fig. 3A, lane 4) and the cleavage site was found to be at Trp132 (data not shown). These protease accessible sites are located at the loop between β-5 and -6, and β-6 strand, respectively (Fig. 1B), corresponding to their location at the surface of CytB (26Li J. Koni P.A. Ellar D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 129-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that one molecule of reNTF completely inhibits the hemolytic activity of 100 molecules of VVA2 (Fig. 4A). In addition, SDS-PAGE showed that reNTF can induce VVA2 oligomerization at the same level of concentration required to inhibit VVA2 hemolytic activity (Fig. 4, A and B). These results indicate that reNTF triggers VVA2 oligomerization by a seeding mechanism and prevents it from causing hemolysis. Amphipathic α-Helix B Required for VVA2 Oligomerization—To determine which motif in NTF is required for VVA2 oligomerization, the secondary structure of NTF was analyzed. It was revealed that there is an amphipathic α-helix B with a hydrophobic moment calculated to be 0.7 according to the method of Eisenberg et al. (31Eisenberg D. Weiss R.M. Terwilliger T.C.

https://openalex.org/W2026664177,"Protein kinase regulated by RNA (PKR) plays important roles in many cellular processes including virus multiplication and cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. The promoter of the PKR gene possesses a novel 15-bp element designated KCS, positioned upstream of a consensus interferon (IFN)-stimulated response element, that is required for both basal and interferon-inducible transcription. Protein binding to the KCS element is not dependent upon IFN treatment and correlates with transcriptional activity of the PKR promoter. The identity of KCS-binding proteins (KBP) that selectively bind at the KCS element is largely unknown, except for the transcription factor Sp1. We now have purified KBP from HeLa cell nuclear extracts by ion-exchange and DNA-affinity chromatography steps and then identified four constituent proteins of the KBP complex by mass spectrometry and immunochemistry: KBP120 and KBP45 are the damaged DNA-binding protein subunits, p127 DDB1 and p48 DDB2, respectively; KBP100 is the transcription factor Sp1; and KBP35 is the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1. The steady-state levels of these four KCS-binding proteins in human cells are not altered by IFN treatment. Components of the KBP complex bind selectively and constitutively to the KCS element in the absence of IFN treatment, both in vitro as measured by competition electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and DNA pull-down assays and in vivo as measured by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays.

Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 778-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (2168) Google Scholar). PKR plays a central role in the control of protein synthesis in virus-infected and IFN-treated cells. Translation is down-regulated by PKR-catalyzed phosphorylation of protein synthesis initiation factor-2α on serine 51 (2Samuel C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition to the role of PKR in translational control, the kinase is also involved in the modulation of cytokine signal transduction via the NF-κB and STAT transcription factors (5Kumar A.

Because of these varied and fundamental biochemical activities, the PKR protein affects a range of physiologic processes. These include, together with the well established role of PKR in the antiviral actions of IFNs and innate immune responses (1Samuel C.E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 778-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (2168) Google Scholar), roles in the control of cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (7Barber G.N.

Although PKR is inducible by IFN treatment and virus infection, basal expression of PKR is readily demonstrable in many cell lines and most animal tissues even in the absence of IFN treatment or virus infection (9Abraham N.

Human PKR is encoded by a single copy gene that includes 17 exons spanning 50 kb located on human chromosome 2p (11Kuhen K.L. Samuel C.E.

Genomics. 1996; 36: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The increased transcription of the PKR gene in IFN-treated cells above the basal level of expression has been firmly established by Northern blot and nuclear run-on analyses with PKR cDNA probes (13Meurs E.

Virol. 2003; 77: 1227-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Expression of the PKR gene is driven by a TATA-less promoter that directs both basal and IFN-inducible transcription (11Kuhen K.L. Samuel C.E. Virology. 1997; 227: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 15Tanaka H. Samuel C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7995-7999Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Two DNA elements have been identified that are required for optimal promoter activity. One is a consensus 13-bp copy of the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) responsible for the inducibility of many different genes, including PKR, by type I IFNs (21Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar). The trimeric transcription factor ISGF3 (STAT1, STAT2, and IRF-9) binds to the ISRE of the PKR promoter in an inducible manner (17Ward S.V. Samuel C.E. Virology. 2002; 296: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The second element is a novel 15-bp element, positioned upstream of the ISRE, that is required for both basal and interferon-inducible transcription. This element, designated KCS for kinase conserved sequence, is exactly conserved between the human and mouse PKR promoters in sequence and position relative to the ISRE (11Kuhen K.L. Samuel C.E. Virology. 1997; 227: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In contrast to the inducible binding of the ISGF3 factor to ISRE (17Ward S.V. Samuel C.E. Virology. 2002; 296: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 21Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar), the KCS element mediates constitutive protein binding (11Kuhen K.L. Samuel C.E. Virology. 1997; 227: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A major complex, designated KBP for KCS-binding protein complex, is formed at the KCS element with nuclear extracts from untreated as well as from IFN-treated cells. Substitution mutational studies have demonstrated that both the 5′- and the 3′-halves of the 15-bp KCS element are capable of mediating nuclear protein binding. Both basal and IFN-inducible promoter activity are impaired by single substitution mutations within either the 5′- or 3′-halves of the KCS element, mutations that also reduce KBP complex formation (16Kuhen K.L. Vessey J.W. Samuel C.E. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9934-9939Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kuhen K.L. Samuel C.E. Virology. 1999; 254: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Multimerization of the KCS element increases both basal and inducible transcription, whereas insertions between the two elements significantly reduce both basal and inducible promoter activity, suggesting that the KCS and ISRE elements of the PKR promoter may represent a functional unit (17Ward S.V. Samuel C.E. Virology. 2002; 296: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The 5′-half of the KCS element includes an Sp1-binding site, and antibody supershift studies identified the Sp1 transcriptional activator as a component of the KBP complex (22Kuhen K.L. Samuel C.E. Virology. 1999; 254: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, the identity of other proteins binding to the KCS element and their possible roles in constitutive and inducible PKR expression largely remain unknown. The absence of a TATA box in the PKR promoter, together with a requirement of the KCS element for basal PKR promoter activity, raises the possibility that trans-acting KCS-binding proteins mediate, in part, basal transcription of the PKR gene. In this report we describe the purification of the KBP complex from untreated HeLa cells and the identification of four constituent polypeptides of the heteromeric KBP transcriptional activator complex. Mass spectrometry and immunochemical analyses established the identity of three new KCS-binding protein complex components, DDB1, DDB2, and hnRNP A1, and confirmed the previously identified Sp1 protein. DDB1 and DDB2 are the large p127 and small p48 subunits, respectively, of a heterodimeric complex that has multiple roles, including UV-damaged DNA binding activity, and that also functions as a transcriptional partner (23Abramic M. Levine A.S. Protic M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22439-22500Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 24Chu G. Chang E. Science. 1988; 242: 564-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 25Hayes S.

Virology. 2002; 304: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Likewise, the hnRNP A1 protein, a member of the heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein family (27Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Pinol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar), is implicated to play multiple roles in mammalian cells other than a component of spliceosomes. We provide functional evidence from experiments including DNA binding pull-down assays in vitro and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in vivo, as well as EMSA analyses following DDB2 knock-down by antisense strategy, all of which indicate that the DDB1, DDB2, Sp1, and hnRNP A1 proteins are constitutively and selectively bound at the KCS element of the IFN-inducible PKR promoter as components of the KBP protein complex. Cell Maintenance, Interferon Treatment, and Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—Human HeLa S3 cells were grown in suspension culture as described (28Deluca J.G. Newton C.N. Himes R.H.

Virology. 1993; 130: 474-484Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar) were maintained in monolayer culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), penicillin, and streptomycin. Cultures were either left untreated or treated with interferon using 1000 IU per ml of IFN-α following priming with IFN-γ. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (17Ward S.V. Samuel C.E. Virology. 2002; 296: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) unless otherwise noted. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Protein binding activity to the KCS DNA element was measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) as described previously (16Kuhen K.L. Vessey J.W. Samuel C.E. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9934-9939Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kuhen K.L. Samuel C.E. Virology. 1999; 254: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Wild-type double-stranded KCS oligodeoxynucleotide (5′-CTGCAGGGAAGGCGGAGTCCAAGG-3′) was used as the 32P-end-labeled probe (K-probe). Selective binding was verified by competition EMSA, using either the wild-type KCS oligo, the substitution mutant KCS(mt6A), or the mutant KCS(mt9T) as the unlabeled double-stranded DNA competitor at 100-fold excess. The conditions for the protein-DNA binding reaction and electrophoresis using 5% native gels at 4 °C were as described (17Ward S.V. Samuel C.E. Virology. 2002; 296: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 22Kuhen K.L. Samuel C.E. Virology. 1999; 254: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), except that fractions from the purification steps were used in place of the nuclear extract as starting material where indicated. Preparation of KCS Sequence-specific DNA-affinity Columns—Wild-type and mutant KCS oligonucleotides biotinylated on the 5′-ends of their + strands were obtained from Sigma-Genosys. The + sequences of the wild-type and mutant KCS oligonucleotides used as double-stranded multimerized DNAs to prepare the KCS DNA-affinity columns were 5′-AAGGCTGCAGGGAAGGCGGAGTCCAAGGCTGCAGGGAAGGCGGAGTCCAAGG-3′ for the wild-type KCS column, and 5′-AAGGCTGCAGGGAATTCTGAGTCCAAGGCTGCAGGGAATTCTGAGTCCAAGG-3′ for the mutant KCS column, with the three G to T substitution mutations indicated by underlines. The biotinylated + strand oligo was annealed with complementary - strand oligo, and then the biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotides were attached to streptavidin-Sepharose beads according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). The mutated KCS sequence with T substitutions at nucleotides 6, 7, and 9 of the 15-bp KCS element used to prepare the mutant KCS DNA-Sepharose beads was verified to display mutant behavior in a competition EMSA. Unlabeled mutant DNA did not compete with nuclear extract proteins binding to a wild-type 32P-labeled KCS probe, whereas the wild-type DNA did compete, consistent with prior observations (16Kuhen K.L. Vessey J.W. Samuel C.E. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9934-9939Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of KCS DNA-binding Proteins—Nuclei were prepared from S3 HeLa cells grown in suspension culture (28Deluca J.G. Newton C.N. Himes R.H. Jordan M.A. Wilson L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28014-28021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Isolated nuclei were washed four times with 1× KHEM buffer (100 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2), and then nuclear proteins were extracted with high salt buffer (1× KHEM containing 250 mm sucrose and 400 mm KCl) by incubation on ice and vigorously vortexing for 10 s every 2 min over a period of 30 min. Following centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 3 h, the supernatant solution (40 ml, ∼3-5 mg of protein per ml) was used as the crude nuclear extract for purification of the KCS-binding protein complex. Typically ∼150 mg of crude nuclear extract protein was loaded at 4 °C onto a 50-ml DEAE-cellulose (Whatman) column equilibrated in 1× KHEM buffer containing 0.2 m KCl. KCS binding activity did not absorb to the DEAE matrix but rather was recovered in the DEAE flow-through fraction. Fractions with peak KCS binding activity were slowly diluted with an equal volume of 1× HEM buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2) to reduce the final KCl concentration to 0.1 m. The DEAE flow-through then was applied to a 20-ml carboxymethyl (CM)-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated with 1× KHEM buffer. The CM column with adsorbed KCS-binding proteins was washed with 2 column volumes of 1× KHEM buffer containing 0.2 m KCl before stepwise elution of bound proteins with KHEM buffer containing 0.3, 0.35, 0.4, or 0.45 m KCl. CM fractions with peak KCS gel shift activity (the 0.35 and 0.4 m salt eluates) were pooled and diluted to a final KCl concentration of 0.1 m KCl prior to DNA-affinity chromatography. Sequential DNA-affinity chromatography was carried out using Sepharose beads with attached wild-type KCS DNA (1st WT), then with attached mutant KCS DNA, and finally with wild-type KCS DNA (2nd WT). Peak active fractions from the CM column were loaded onto the 1st WT DNA-affinity column, a 1-ml column of Sepharose-DNA equilibrated with 1× KHEM containing 0.1 m KCl and 10% glycerol. The 1st WT KCS-affinity column was washed with 2 ml of 1× KHEM containing 0.2 m KCl and 10% glycerol and then with 1 ml of KHEM containing 0.3 m KCl and 10% glycerol, and finally the KCS binding activity was eluted with 3 ml of 1× KHEM containing 0.6 m KCl and 10% glycerol. 0.5-ml fractions were collected, and the peak KCS binding activity usually was found in fractions 2 and 3. The pooled peak fractions from the 1st WT KCS-affinity column were diluted to 0.45 m KCl concentration and then loaded onto a 0.4-ml mutant KCS-affinity column equilibrated with 1× KHEM containing 0.45 m KCl and 10% glycerol. The column then was washed with 1× KHEM buffer containing 0.45 m KCl. The KCS binding activity was found in the flow-through and first 0.45 m wash. The mutant column flow-through and 0.45 m wash fraction were pooled, diluted to 0.1 m KCl concentration, and then loaded onto the 2nd WT KCS-affinity column equilibrated with 1× KHEM buffer containing 10% glycerol. The adsorbed proteins were eluted following the same procedure as for the 1st WT KCS column, except that the 0.6 m KCl eluates were collected in fractions of 0.2 ml. Ten fractions were collected. Fractions from ion-exchange chromatography and DNA-Sepharose affinity chromatography steps of the purification scheme were monitored for selective KCS DNA binding activity by competition EMSAs. SDS-PAGE using 5-15% gradient acrylamide gels was used to analyze the fractions for their protein composition, with protein detection by silver staining of the gel (Bio-Rad). Mass Spectrometry and Sequence Analysis—The most purified protein fractions containing KCS binding activity obtained after the 2nd WT KCS DNA-affinity column step were fractionated by SDS-PAGE. Five of the protein bands that were consistently enriched during purification in a manner that correlated with KCS binding activity were excised from unfixed gels for analysis by mass spectrometry. Trypsin digestion and sequence analysis of three protein bands were performed by the Harvard Microchemistry and Proteomics Analysis Facility (Cambridge, MA). Sequence analysis of the tryptic peptides was performed by microcapillary reverse-phase HPLC nano-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry on a Finnigan LCQ DECA ion trap mass spectrometer. The tandem mass spectrometry peptide sequence or fragmentation spectra obtained were then correlated with known tryptic peptide sequences identified from the data base by computer analysis (31Eng J.K.

Antibodies and Western Immunoblot Assay—Proteins were fractionated on SDS-10% PAGE gels and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in PBS-Tween typically overnight at 4 °C, washed three times with PBS each for 5 min, and then incubated with primary antibody diluted in 3% (w/v) nonfat milk in PBS for 2 h at room temperature with gentle agitation. Detection was done with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies using an ECL detection kit according to instructions provided by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Rabbit polyclonal antibody against DDB2 protein was generously provided by Dr. C. C.-K. Chao (Chang Gung University, Taiwan). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against hnRNP A1 protein and IRF-9 were generously provided by Dr. G. Dreyfuss (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia) and Dr. N. Reich (State University of New York, Stony Brook), respectively. Rabbit polyclonal antibody against Sp1 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Polyclonal antibody against human DDB1 protein was raised in guinea pigs immunized with bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase human DDB1 fusion protein GST-DDB1. The bacterial expression plasmid pGEX-DDB1 (nucleotides 2024-3001) for human DDB1 was generated by reverse transcriptase-PCR, using total RNA isolated from human U cells that was reverse-transcribed by using random primer and Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The resultant cDNA fragment was used as the template for PCR with the DDB1 forward primer (5′-GCGGATCCCGTTCTCTTTCTACCACCAACGTC-3′) and DDB1 reverse primer (5′-GCGGATTCGCCCCCAGAAAATTGTCATCATCC-3′) to amplify the coding region between nucleotides 2024 and 3001. The PCR fragment was first cloned in the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and then was subcloned into the pGEX-2T expression vector using BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites. KCS Element DNA Pull-down Assay—A double-stranded oligonucleotide containing three copies of the wild-type KCS element 5′-AAGGCTGCA(GGGAAGGCGGAGTCCAAGG)-3′ with the KCS element indicated by underlines was attached to streptavidin-Sepharose beads via a 5′-biotinylated + strand according to the manufacturer's guidelines (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were washed twice with buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol (v/v)) and blocked in the same buffer supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 30 min. Prior to use, the beads were washed three times with buffer A and then incubated with ∼150 μg of nuclear extract protein in 350 μl of buffer A containing 7 μg of poly(dI·dC) at room temperature for 30 min. Sepharose beads with adsorbed proteins were pelleted and washed, and then the bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-10% PAGE and Western immunoblot analysis as described (33Orlando V. Strutt H. Paro R. Methods. 1997; 11: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), using antibodies against DDB1, DDB2, A1, Sp1, and IRF-9 as indicated. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis (33Orlando V. Strutt H. Paro R. Methods. 1997; 11: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 34Toth J. Biggin M.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: i-viiiCrossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar) was carried out as recently described in detail (35Ward S.V. Samuel C.E. Virology. 2003; 313: 553-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent human amnion U cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde, harvested, and then lysed with buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and phosphatase and protease inhibitors (0.1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% protease inhibitor mixture (v/v; Sigma)). Nuclei were isolated by centrifugation and lysed, and the chromatin was sheared by sonication and digestion with HindIII. Chromatin preparations were precleared with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with or without antibody against DDB2, A1, Sp1, or STAT1 as indicated, followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. Cross-links were then reversed, and DNA isolated from immunoprecipitated material was amplified by nested PCR using primers that spanned the KCS and ISRE elements of the human PKR promoter. The first round + primer (primer 1) was 5′-CGCACTCTGGATCCAGCGCCAAT-3′ (20 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 63 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min), resulting in products of 141 bp; the second round + primer (primer 2) was 5′-ATCCAGCGCCAATTTACCCCAATCCCGT-3′ (20 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 65 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min), resulting in products of 131 bp. The same - primer was used in both rounds (primer 3, 5′-AGACCCGCGGCTTCGGGAGA-3′). 1/100 of digested input chromatin was processed and analyzed similarly as a control. Purification of KCS-binding Proteins—The multistep scheme used to enrich for proteins binding the KCS DNA element is shown in Fig. 1A. KCS DNA binding activity was monitored through protein fractionation steps by EMSA using a 32P-labeled wild-type KCS oligonucleotide probe. Nuclear proteins bound the 15-bp KCS element selectively as established by competition EMSA. KCS binding activity measured by EMSA correlated with PKR promoter activity measured by transient transfection reporter assays (see Refs. 16Kuhen K.L. Vessey J.W. Samuel C.E. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9934-9939Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 22Kuhen K.L. Samuel C.E. Virology. 1999; 254: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar and data not shown). Because KCS binding activity is not inducible by IFN treatment (17Ward S.V. Samuel C.E. Virology. 2002; 296: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 22Kuhen K.L. Samuel C.E. Virology. 1999; 254: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), purification of KCS-binding proteins was carried out by using nuclear extracts prepared from HeLa cells that had not been treated with IFN. Approximately 150 mg of nuclear protein obtained from ∼70 liters of suspension-cultured HeLa cells was used as the starting material. KCS DNA binding activity present in nuclear extracts was enriched by sequential ion-exchange column chromatography, first utilizing DEAE-cellulose under conditions in which the KCS binding activity was not retained on the DEAE matrix (0.2 m KCl). The DEAE flow-through was then applied to a column of CM-Sepharose that bound and concentrated KCS binding activity. KCS binding activity was eluted from the CM matrix using a stepwise salt gradient, with maximum activity found in eluent fractions between ∼0.35 and 0.40 m KCl (Fig. 1B). KCS binding activity recovered from the CM-Sepharose step was further fractionated by sequence-specific DNA-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Significant enrichment of KCS binding activity was achieved utilizing sequential DNA-Sepharose affinity steps beginning with wild-type, then mutant, and again wild-type KCS DNA-affinity columns. KCS DNA binding activity bound by the 1st wild-type KCS oligonucleotide affinity column was eluted with 0.6 m KCl following extensive washing with buffer containing 0.3 m KCl. The KCS binding activity recovered from the 1st wild-type affinity column was not bound by a subsequent mutant KCS oligonucleotide affinity column, but the flow-through eluate from the mutant column was bound by a 2nd wild-type KCS oligonucleotide column (Fig. 1, A and C). The enrichment in KCS DNA binding activity obtained by the purification scheme was ∼200-fold from the nuclear extract fraction used as starting material. Identification of KCS DNA-binding Proteins"
https://openalex.org/W1991396814,"Contributions of the C-terminal domain of Kv4.3 to the voltage-dependent gating of A-type K+ current (IA) were examined by (i) making mutations in this region, (ii) heterologous expression in HEK293 cells, and (iii) detailed voltage clamp analyses. Progressive deletions of the C terminus of rat Kv4.3M (to amino acid 429 from the N terminus) did not markedly change the inactivation time course of IA but shifted the voltage dependence of steady state inactivation in the negative direction to a maximum of -17 mV. Further deletions (to amino acid 420) shifted this parameter in the positive direction, suggesting a critical role for the domain 429–420 in the voltage-dependent regulation of IA. There are four positively charged amino acids in this domain: Lys423, Lys424, Arg426, and Arg429. The replacement of the two arginines with alanines (R2A) resulted in -23 and -13 mV shifts of inactivation and activation, respectively. Additional replacement of the two lysines with alanines did not result in further shifts. Single replacements of R426A or R429A induced -15 and -10 mV shifts of inactivation, respectively. R2A did not significantly change the inactivation rate but did markedly change the voltage dependence of recovery from inactivation. These two arginines are conserved in Kv4 subfamily, and alanine replacement of Arg429 and Arg432 in Kv4.2 gave essentially the same results. These effects of R2A were not modulated by co-expression of the K+ channel β subunit, KChIPs. In conclusion, the two arginines in the cytosolic C-terminal domain of α-subunits of Kv4 subfamily strongly regulate the voltage dependence of channel activation, inactivation, and recovery.

A number of the major subgroups of voltage-dependent potassium (Kv) 1The abbreviations used are: Kvvoltage-dependent potassiumKChIPpotassium channel-interacting proteinHEKhuman embryonic kidney cell lineWTwild type.1The abbreviations used are: Kvvoltage-dependent potassiumKChIPpotassium channel-interacting proteinHEKhuman embryonic kidney cell lineWTwild type. channels, Shaker (Kv1), Shab (Kv2), Shaw (Kv3), and Shal (Kv4), share a common structure consisting of tetrameric α-subunits, in which three regions have high homology of amino acid sequences. These include the S4 voltage sensor domain, the H5 pore-forming segment, and the T1 cytosolic domains (1Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A. North R.A. Handbook of Receptors and Channels: Ligand and Voltage-gated Channels. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 1-71Google Scholar). The time- and voltage-dependent gating corresponding to activation is attributable to a well conserved amino acid sequence in S4 transmembrane domains, which include positive charges in every three amino acid residues. This region forms a voltage sensor paddle (2Liman E.R. Hess P. Weaver F. Koren G. Nature. 1991; 353: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 3Papazian D.M. Timpe L.C. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

The H5 domain corresponds to the pore, and its selectivity for potassium ions is determined by the so-called signature sequence, GYG (5Lipkind G.M. Hanck D.A. Fozzard H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9215-9219Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The T1 domain mainly contributes to the stable formation of homo- and/or hetero-tetramers in a gondola-like structure within each subgroup (6Li M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

In contrast to these common molecular features of the Kv1–4 subgroups, the functional characteristics and underlying mechanisms of inactivation vary widely. Rapid inactivation is a defining characteristic for Kv1 and Kv4 channels, in contrast to slow inactivation (or practically no inactivation) in Kv2 and Kv3 channels. The A-type K+ current is the major transient outward K+ current in many cells. It exhibits rapid inactivation in a wide variety of excitable tissues and is generated by the expression of Kv1.4, 3.4, 4.1, 4.2, or 4.3 channels depending upon tissues and species. The two (rapid and slow) inactivation time courses of IA through Kv1.4 channels are mediated by (i) the so-called ball-and-chain inactivation mechanism involving N-terminal polypeptides and (ii) the C-type inactivation mechanism involving the external mouth of the pore, respectively (11Tseng-Crank J. Yao J.A. Berman M.F. Tseng G.N. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 1057-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 12Rasmusson R.L. Morales M.J. Castellino R.C. Zhang Y. Campbell D.L. Strauss H.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 489: 709-721Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying Kv4 channel inactivation have not been well defined. In mouse Kv4.1, the inactivation can be regulated by both the C and the N termini, and they appear to be able to act in concert. In addition, several residues in S4-S5 loop and S6 can be also involved in inactivation gating, and this mechanism is apparently distinctive from N- or C-type inactivation clarified in Kv1 channels (13Jerng H.H. Covarrubias M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 163-174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 14Jerng H.H. Shahidullah M. Covarrubias M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 641-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Recently β-subunits, K+ channel-interacting proteins (KChIPs), have also been shown to modulate the inactivation significantly in Kv4 channels (15An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P.

In the mammalian central nervous system, three members of Kv4 subfamily (Kv4.1, 4.2, and 4.3) are known to the major components of the so-called subthreshold A currents (ISA). These currents are activated at membrane potentials negative to the threshold for spike generation and therefore can significantly modulate the threshold for excitation and spike duration (21Serodio P. Vega-Saenz de Miera E. Rudy B. J. Neurophysiol. 1996; 75: 2174-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). For example, Kv4 channels are highly expressed in quickly spiking interneurons and pyramidal neurons of rat hippocampus and contribute to the action potential waveforms in these neurons (22Hoffman D.A. Magee J.C. Colbert C.M. Johnston D. Nature. 1997; 387: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 23Martina M. Schultz J.H. Ehmke H. Monyer H. Jonas P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8111-8125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activation, inactivation, and recovery kinetics and the steady state voltage dependence of these Kv4 channels are critical determinants of the functional roles of this K+ current in the central nervous system. In a previous study, we have shown that the deletion of 168 amino acids from the C-terminal domain of Kv4.3L (which is predominantly expressed in hippocampus) does not change activation or inactivation kinetics but significantly slows the recovery from inactivation (24Ohya S. Tanaka M. Oku T. Furuyama T. Mori N. Giles W.R. Watanabe M. Imaizumi Y. Life Sci. 2001; 68: 1703-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to elucidate roles of the C-terminal domain in the inactivation mechanisms of Kv4 channels. Selective and specific deletions of C-terminal amino acids to position of 420 from the N terminus of Kv4.3M demonstrate that the domain between 429 and 420 has a very significant role in determining the voltage dependence of inactivation. To identify the molecular mechanism of this effect, the two positively charged amino acids, arginines in this region were replaced with neutral amino acids, alanines, R426A and R429A. This resulted in very significant shifts of both activation and inactivation relations (by ∼15 mV in the negative direction) but did not change the inactivation time course. In summary, our results demonstrated that a small number of amino acids in the cytosolic C terminus of Kv4.x channels play critical roles in the regulation of the voltage dependence of the activation, inactivation, and recovery. Preparation of cDNA—Full-length rat Kv4.3M (WT) and Kv4.2 (24Ohya S. Tanaka M. Oku T. Furuyama T. Mori N. Giles W.R. Watanabe M. Imaizumi Y. Life Sci. 2001; 68: 1703-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and full-length rat KChIP2S (25Ohya S. Morohashi Y. Muraki K. Tomita T. Watanabe M. Iwatsubo T. Imaizumi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) were ligated into pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) and pTracer-CMV2 (Invitrogen) using a TaKaRa ligation kit, version 1 (TaKaRa), respectively. All of the deletion mutant constructs, Kv4.3DC487, DC471, DC469, DC446, DC434, DC429, DC425, DC420, and DC412 (see Fig. 1A), were prepared by the removal of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of Kv4.3M. Antisense primers (contained the Kv4.3M sequence up to each selected position, 487, 471, 469, 446, 434, 429, 425, 420, and 412, the in-frame stop codon) were designed, and then PCR was used to amplify selectively each incomplete fragment of Kv4.3 from Kv4.3M constructs. After PCR, the fragment of each Kv4.3 deletion mutant was subcloned into pBluescript SK(+) (Strategene). All of the constructs were sequenced by the dideoxy method using a Thermo Sequenase cycle sequencing kit, with DSQ-1000L (Shimadzu). Following this, the fragments encoding each deletion mutant were subcloned into a mammalian expression vector, pcDNA3.1(+). To construct the site-directed mutants of Kv4.3, arginine or lysine were substituted for alanine or lysine at targeted sites Lys423, Lys424, Arg426, and Arg429 by a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Strategene): 4A (K423A,K424A,R426A,R429A), R2A (R426A,R429A), R426A, R429A, K2A (K423A,K424A), and R2K (R426K,R429K). The site-directed mutants (4A, R2A, K2A, R426A, R429A, and R2K) were also identified by DNA sequencing. The site-directed mutant of Kv4.2 was also constructed using the similar protocols to replace Arg429 and Arg432 with alanine. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells were maintained as previously described (24Ohya S. Tanaka M. Oku T. Furuyama T. Mori N. Giles W.R. Watanabe M. Imaizumi Y. Life Sci. 2001; 68: 1703-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and transient expression of Kv4.3M (WT), mutant constructs, and KChIP2S was performed using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation technique (25Ohya S. Morohashi Y. Muraki K. Tomita T. Watanabe M. Iwatsubo T. Imaizumi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The cells were maintained on small pieces of coverglass (3 × 3 mm) in culture dishes for 48–72 h after transfection and then used for electrophysiological experiments. Electrophysiology—Whole cell voltage clamp was applied to single HEK293 cells using a CEZ-2400 amplifier (Nihon Kohden). Transfected cells were identified by green fluorescent protein signals that were derived from pTracer-CMV2 and observed with a fluorescence microscopy (Nikon, GFP-LP filter). All of the experiments were performed at room temperature (23 ± 1 °C). The membrane currents were monitored and stored as previously reported (26Imaizumi Y. Muraki K. Watanabe M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1990; 427: 301-324Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For electrical recordings, HEPES-buffered solution having the following composition was used as the external solution: 137 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 14 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The pipette filling solution contained 140 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Na2ATP, 0.05 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. The voltage dependence of IA activation was determined using the conventional double pulse protocol described previously (27Hatano N. Ohya S. Imaizumi Y. Pflugers. Arch. 2002; 444: 80-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The membrane potential was depolarized from -100 mV to selected test potentials for 8 ms to activate IA and then to -60 mV to measure the tail current as indicated in the text. The initial tail current amplitude was normalized to the maximum in each cell, and this value was plotted against the selected depolarizing potential. The data were fitted with the Boltzmann equation, and the voltages required for the half-maximal activation and the slope factor were obtained from the best fitting relationship. In all experiments, these double pulse clamp steps were applied once every 10 s. The steady state voltage dependence of IA inactivation was also determined by the conventional double pulse protocol. IA was activated and inactivated with 1-s step depolarizations from -80 or -100 mV to selected test potentials, and then the remaining channels were activated by a second depolarization to +20 mV. Normalization of current records and fitting of the data to the Boltzmann equation were performed in a similar manner as for the activation. Statistics—The pooled data are expressed as the means ± S.E., and the statistical significance was examined using the unpaired Student's t test or Dunnett's test for two or multiple groups, respectively.

Deletion of C Terminus of Kv4.3—Nine mutant constructs of the K+ channel α-subunit, Kv4.3M, were prepared by deleting the C terminus at selected locations, as shown in Fig. 1A. Whole cell K+ currents through wild type Kv4.3M (WT) expressed in HEK293 cell (see “Materials and Methods”) were activated by depolarization lasting 1 s from a holding potential of -80 mV. These typical A-type K+ currents are shown in Fig. 1B. Kv4.3 mutant constructs, in which the C terminus was deleted up to amino acid positions of 487 (DC487), 434 (DC434), 429 (DC429), 425 (DC425), and 420 (DC420) from the N terminus, also generated A-type K+ currents (Fig. 1B). In our first series of experiments, the peak IA density at +40 mV was measured in HEK293 cells, which had been transfected with the same amount of plasmid DNA encoding wild type or mutated Kv4.3. The results showed that progressively larger deletions of the C terminus resulted in correspondingly smaller IA densities. For this reason, larger amounts of plasmid DNAs were utilized in subsequent experiments for the analysis of mutant constructs. Fig. 1C shows the relationship between the extent of C terminus deletion and the current density/unit amount of each plasmid DNA. For example, the DC487 mutant resulted in only ∼20% of the functional expression of the WT construct. The results obtained with this approach clearly demonstrated that the functional expression of Kv4.3 highly depended on the C terminus amino acid composition beyond amino acid 487. Further deletion, up to amino acid 412 (DC412), resulted in complete loss of channel expression, even when the cDNA used for the transfection was 50 times larger than the amount required for WT. To study the properties of these mutant constructs in more detail, the time- and voltage-dependent gating parameters of IA were recorded from HEK293 cells in which mutated Kv4.3 channels were transiently expressed (Table I). The activation kinetics measured as the time to peak of IA for mutated Kv4.3 channels from DC487 to DC434 at +20 mV were identical to that of WT. The time to peak of DC429 was significantly shorter than that of WT, and the time to peak of DC425 and DC420 were significantly longer than that of DC429. The inactivation time course of IA for these mutated Kv4.3 channels was well fitted by the sum of two exponential components. The faster time constant of inactivation τf values of these currents were in the range of 34 (DC429) and 54 ms (DC420) at +20 mV, and that of DC420 was significantly larger than that of WT. The slower time constant of inactivation τs was not affected significantly by these deletions. The contribution of fast component to total inactivation (Afast/(Afast + Aslow)) was not affected markedly by these deletions.Table ISummary of data describing the time to peak and the inactivation rate of IA in WT4 KV4.3M and selected mutant constructs in the absence or presence of KChIP2S These parameters were obtained from recordings of IA activated by depolarizations from -80 or -100 V to -20 mV. The inactivation time course was fitted by sum of two exponential functions and the amplitude at time 0, and the time constants of fast and slow components (Afast, Aslow, τfast and τslow, respectively) were determined.

Voltage dependence of the steady state inactivation was determined using a conventional two-step pulse protocol. The half-inactivation voltage (V1/2) and slope factors were obtained by fitting of the Boltzmann relationship to each set of data, as summarized in Fig. 2A (right panel) and also in Table II. The V1/2 was shifted to more negative potentials by a maximum of -17 mV by C-terminal deletions to DC429. Interestingly, further deletions resulted in a shift to more depolarized membrane potentials.Table IISummary of the half-inactivation voltages and respective slope factors for IAin WT KV4.3M and selected mutant constructs in the absence or presence of KChIP2S These parameters were obtained using the conventional double pulse protocol (see “Materials and Methods” in detail).

The recovery from inactivation was defined as the relative amplitude of the peak current elicited by the second pulse versus that by the first one and plotted as a function of the interval between these paired pulses (Fig. 2B). The time course of recovery from inactivation was well fitted by single exponential function and is summarized in Fig. 2B (right panel). Note that τrec was increased significantly from ∼200 to ∼600 ms by progressively larger deletions up to DC429. However, further deletions markedly shortened τrec. In Fig. 2C, τrec is plotted on logarithmic scale against the holding potential. The membrane potential values are corrected to account for the deletion-induced shift of V1/2 from that of WT (-52.1 mV in Fig. 2A). For example, the holding potential used to measure τrec of DC429 was originally -80 mV, and it was corrected for the V1/2 shift by -16 to -64 mV, and the log10 τrec was 2.76. These findings demonstrate a clear correlation between corrected holding potentials and log10 τrec values of WT, DC487, DC471, DC434, and DC429. In contrast, the data of DC425 and DC420 did not fit to this correlation. Therefore, the voltage dependence of IA inactivation and its recovery are both strongly regulated by the C-terminal domain of Kv4.3, which is located to a well defined region between DC429 and DC420. Point Mutations of Positively Charged Amino Acids between 429 and 425—Based on these results, the amino acids between 429 and 420 were investigated in detail, based on the working hypothesis that charged amino acids are likely to be responsible for voltage dependence of Kv4.3 channel inactivation. There are four positively charged amino acids in this region; two arginines (Arg426 and Arg429) and two lysines (Lys423 and Lys424). Fig. 3 shows the data obtained following the replacement of these two arginines with the neutral amino acid alanine (R2A). Activation of the R2A-mutated Kv4.3M by depolarization from holding potential of -80 mV elicited typical A-type K+ currents (Fig. 3A). Surprisingly, the voltage dependence of activation (Fig. 3B) and the steady state inactivation (Fig. 3C) were markedly shifted in the negative direction by these two amino acid substitutions. A substantial fraction of R2A channels are inactivated at the holding potential of -80 mV. For this reason, subsequent experiments were also performed at the holding potential of -100 mV. Under these conditions, the V1/2 values of R2A, R426A, and R429A for the activation and inactivation were significantly shifted to negative potentials (Table II). Additional replacement of positively charged amino acids, Lys423 and Lys424, with alanine (4A) did not induce further change in V1/2 for inactivation (-73.3 ± 2.1 mV, n = 5; p > 0.05 versus R2A). Replacement of only Lys423 and Lys424 with alanine (K2A) did not significantly change the pattern of results (K2A: -49.2 ± 1.9 mV, n = 4; p > 0.05 versus WT). Moreover, the replacement of Arg426 and Arg429 with lysine, which also has positive charge (but ∼50% smaller than that of arginine; see Ref. 13Jerng H.H. Covarrubias M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 163-174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), resulted in an intermediate shift (-58.6 ± 2.8 mV, n = 3, p < 0.05 versus WT). These results demonstrate that positive charges of Arg426 and Arg429 are essential for regulating the voltage dependence of Kv4.3 channel inactivation. These two amino acid mutations (R2A) also resulted in a striking change in the time course of recovery from inactivation (Fig. 3D). The τrec of R2A-mutated Kv4.3 channel current was 907.5 ± 56.0 ms (n = 9; p < 0.01 versus WT: 224.3 ± 12.0 ms, n = 13) at a holding potential of -80 mV. The τrec was measured at three different holding potentials: -120, -100, and -80 mV. Fig. 3E illustrates the relationships between holding potentials and τrec on a logarithmic scale. The two sets of data for WT and R2A are both well fitted by straight lines, respectively. The voltage difference between these two lines is ∼20 mV, which is similar to the difference in V1/2 of the steady state inactivation. This suggests that the marked increase in τrec by R2A mutation may be due to the change in voltage dependence of the inactivation. To study the contribution of Arg426 and Arg429 to the regulation of the voltage dependence of inactivation, a single amino acid replacement was performed. This point mutation, R426A shifted V1/2 of the steady state inactivation to -66.0 ± 2.3 mV (n = 7, p < 0.01 versus WT: -51.7 ± 1.5 mV, n = 5) and changed τrec to 167.7 ± 15.6 ms (n = 4, p < 0.01 versus WT: 84.0 ± 8.9 ms, n = 7) at holding potential of -100 mV. On the other hand, R429A shifted the inactivation V1/2 to -61.8 ± 1.3 mV (n = 8, p < 0.01 versus WT) and changed τrec to 108.6 ± 7.2 ms (n = 8, p > 0.05 versus WT). In conclusion, the two arginines Arg426 and Arg429 both contribute substantially to the regulatory mechanisms underlying the voltage dependence of Kv4.3. The amino acid composition in C-terminal domain of Kv4 subfamily is highly conserved in the region consisting of ∼30 amino acids from the downstream of the S6 segments (Fig. 1). Specifically, two arginines corresponding to Arg426 and Arg429 in Kv4.3 are conserved in Kv4.1 and Kv4.2. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider that the regulation of voltage dependence inactivation by the arginines is a common mechanism shared by all Kv4 subfamily members. To examine this possibility, Arg429 and Arg432 in rat Kv4.2 were replaced with"
https://openalex.org/W2029434128,"Activating signal cointegrator-2 (ASC-2), a cancer-amplified transcription coactivator of nuclear receptors and numerous other transcription factors, was previously shown to contain two LXXLL motifs, each of which interacts with a distinct set of nuclear receptors. In this work, we showed that ASC-2 has an indirect, separate binding site for androgen receptor (AR). Interestingly, this region overlapped with the direct interaction interfaces with the tumor suppressor retinoblastoma (Rb). Although ASC-2 alone stimulated AR transactivation in cotransfections of HeLa cells, ectopic expression of Rb effected ASC-2 to act as a transcription coactivator of AR in Rb-null Saos2 cells. These results, along with the previous report in which AR was shown to directly interact with Rb (Yeh, S., Miyamoto, H., Nishimura, K., Kang, H., Ludlow, J., Hsiao, P., Wang, C., Su, C., and Chang C. (1998) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 248, 361-367), suggest that the AR-ASC-2 interactions in vivo may involve Rb. Thus, ASC-2 appears to contain at least three distinct nuclear receptor interaction domains.

Thus, ASC-2 appears to contain at least three distinct nuclear receptor interaction domains. The nuclear receptor superfamily is a group of proteins that regulate, in a ligand-dependent manner, transcriptional initiation of target genes by binding to specific DNA sequences named hormone response elements (reviewed in Ref. 1Mangelsdorf D.J.

Functional analysis of nuclear receptors has shown that there are two major activation domains. The N-terminal domain (i.e. AF-1) contains a ligand-independent activation function, whereas the ligand-binding domain exhibits ligand-dependent transactivation function (i.e. AF-2). The AF-2 core region, located at the extreme C terminus of the receptor ligand-binding domains, is conserved among nuclear receptors and undergoes a major conformational change upon ligand binding (1Mangelsdorf D.J.

This region has been shown to play a critical role in mediating transactivation by serving as a ligand-dependent interaction interface with many different coactivators (reviewed in Ref. 2McKenna N.J.

Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar). A distinctive structural feature of the AF-2-dependent coactivators is the presence of LXXLL signature motifs (i.e. NR box) (3Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar, 4Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). The AF-2 core region (helix 12), upon undergoing a major restructuring upon ligand binding, forms part of a “charged clamp” that accommodates coactivators within a hydrophobic cleft of the receptor ligand-binding domain, through direct contacts with these NR boxes (2McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the N-CoR/SMRT nuclear receptor interaction motifs exhibit a consensus sequence of I/LXXI/HI (i.e. CoRNR box, in which H indicates hydrophobic residues) (5Hu X.

Thus, discrimination of the subtle differences between the coactivator and corepressor interaction helices by the nuclear receptor AF-2 core may provide the molecular basis for the exchange of coactivators for corepressors, with ligand-dependent formation of the charged clamp that stabilizes NR box binding and inhibits interaction with CoRNR box helix.

This region, distinct from two previously characterized LXXLL motifs (13Lee S.-K. Jung S.Y. Kim Y.S. Na S.Y. Lee Y.C. Lee J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), overlapped with the newly defined, direct interaction interfaces with the tumor suppressor retinoblastoma (Rb). In addition, Rb appeared to be required for ASC-2-mediated transactivation of AR in cotransfections. Along with the previous report in which AR was shown to directly interact with Rb (19Yeh S. Miyamoto H. Nishimura K. Kang H. Ludlow J. Hsiao P. Wang C. Su C. Chang C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), these results suggest that the AR-ASC-2 interactions in vivo could be mediated by Rb. Overall, these results suggest that 1) ASC-2 is likely an essential coactivator of AR, and 2) ASC-2 contains at least three distinct nuclear receptor-interacting domains. Plasmids—For glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion vectors, PCR-fragments encoding Rb, Rbm1, Rbm2, and Rbm3 were cloned into EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites of pGEX4T (Amersham Biosciences). For VP16 fusion vectors, PCR-fragments for AR and Rb were cloned into EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites of pCMX-VP16. Similarly, a PCR-fragment encoding ASC2-2b was cloned into EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites of pcDNA3-HA-NLS. The mammalian expression vectors for ASC-2, Gal4/ASC2-2, Gal4/ASC2-1, Gal4/ASC2-2, Gal4/ASC2-3.5, Gal4/ASC2-4, Gal4/ASC2-2a, Gal4/ASC2-2b, Gal4/ASC2-2c, AR, and Rb, along with the transfection indicator construct pRSV-β-gal and reporter constructs MMTV-luciferase and Gal4-luciferase, were as previously described (7Lee S.-K.

GST-Pull Down Assays—The GST-fusions or GST alone were expressed in Escherichia coli, bound to glutathione-Sepahrose-4B beads (Amersham Biosciences), and incubated with labeled proteins expressed by in vitro translation by using the TnT-coupled transcription-translation system, with conditions as described by the manufacturer (Promega, Madison, WI). Specifically bound proteins were eluted from beads with 40 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography as described previously (20Na S.Y. Kim H.J.

Cell Culture, Transfections, Co-immunoprecipitation, and Immunohistochemistry—HeLa and CV-1 cells were grown in 24-well plates with medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum for 24 h and transfected with 100 ng of LacZ expression vector pRSV-β-gal and 100 ng of an indicated reporter gene, along with indicated amount of various mammalian expression vectors. Total amounts of expression vectors were kept constant by adding pcDNA3. Transfections and luciferase assays were done as described (20Na S.Y. Kim H.J. Lee S.K. Choi H.S. Na D.S. Lee M.O. Chung M.

Similar results were obtained in more than two similar experiments. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, 293T cells were cotransfected with mammalian expression vectors for Rb, ASC-2, and AR, as indicated. HL60 cells were also employed. Antibody coupling to protein G agarose and immunoprecipitation were executed as previously described (21Lee Y.C. Kim Y.-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5364-5370Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described (22Zhang H. Liao L. Kuang S.Q. Xu J. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 1435-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, adult mouse testes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.6) overnight. Paraffin sections (5 μm in thickness) were prepared. Deparaffinized and hydrolyzed sections were incubated overnight with ASC-2 antibody as previously described (22Zhang H. Liao L. Kuang S.Q. Xu J. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 1435-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) or AR antibody (mouse anti-AR prediluted antibody, Zymed Labaoratories, Inc., San Francisco, CA), followed by secondary biotinylated antibody (22Zhang H. Liao L. Kuang S.Q. Xu J. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 1435-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Negative control staining was performed with pre-absorbed anti-ASC-2 serum (22Zhang H. Liao L. Kuang S.Q. Xu J. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 1435-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) or non-immune mouse IgG at 1:200 dilutions (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Single-Cell Microinjection Assay—CV-1 fibroblast cells, made quiescent by incubating in serum-free medium for 24 h, were microinjected with either preimmune IgG or the affinity-purified αASC-2 IgG (13Lee S.-K. Jung S.Y. Kim Y.S. Na S.Y. Lee Y.C. Lee J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) along with reporter and indicator constructs (25 μg/ml each). The reporter construct consisted of the MMTV promoter driving the expression of green fluorescence protein (MMTV-GFP), whereas the cytomegalovirus promoter drives the expression of red fluorescence protein in microinjection indicator construct CMV-RFP. About 1 h after injection, cells were stimulated, where indicated, with 0.1 μm of testosterone. After 18 h incubation, cells were examined for GFP and RFP expressions as previously described (23Jhun B.H. Rose D.W. Seely B.L. Rameh L. Cantley L. Saltiel A.R. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7466-7475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—HEK293 cells overexpressing AR were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% charcoal-dextran-stripped fetal bovine serum, and were treated with 0.1 μm of testosterone. ChIP assays were essentially done as described (24Shang Y. Myers M. Brown M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 601-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). The primers used were 5′-TCTGCCTTTGTCCCCTAGAT-3′ and 5′-AACCTTCATTCCCCAGGACT-3′. ASC-2 as an Essential Coactivator of AR—The nuclear receptor coactivator ASC-2 functions with two steroid receptors (i.e. estrogen and glucocorticoid receptors) via its N-terminal NR box (7Lee S.-K.

Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To test whether or not the target steroid receptors of ASC-2 extend to AR, we microinjected IgG or monoclonal antibody against ASC-2 into the nuclei of CV-1 cells, along with AR-expression vector as well as CMV-RFP indicator and MMTV-GFP reporter constructs. Notably, this proviral MMTV promoter contains the well characterized cis-elements that are responsive to glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, progeseterone, and testosterone (25Truss M. Chalepakis G. Beato M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 365-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). With IgG microinjected, the percentage of green cells (i.e. GFP-positive cells indicative of activated AR) over the total number of red cells (i.e. RFP-positive cells indicative of microinjected cells) increased from 0 to almost 75% upon addition of 0.1 μm of testosterone (Fig. 1A). In the presence of microinjected αASC-2 antibody and testosterone, however, it dropped to less than 20%, indicating that the endogenous ASC-2 in CV-1 cells is important for AR transactivation. To confirm these results, we executed transient cotransfection assays by employing a luciferase reporter construct driven by MMTV proviral promoter (i.e. MMTV-luciferase). As shown in Fig. 1B, increasing amounts of ASC-2-expression vector cotransfected into HeLa cells stimulated testosterone-dependent transactivation by AR in a dose-dependent manner. Notably, ASC-2 had no significant effect on the basal level of transactivation. Finally, we have employed ChIP assays to directly examine whether ASC-2 is recruited to endogenous AR target genes. Indeed, ASC-2 was recruited to the androgen response element in the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) gene (24Shang Y. Myers M. Brown M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 601-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) in a testosterone-dependent manner, along with AR itself (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that ASC-2 is an essential transcriptional coactivator protein of AR. Indirect Binding of ASC-2 and AR—To understand the mechanistic basis of this ASC-2 recruitment to AR (Fig. 1C), we tried to localize the putative interaction interfaces between ASC-2 and AR. Surprisingly, the mapped AR-interacting region of ASC-2 (ARID in Fig. 2A) did not coincide with either of the two NR boxes. As demonstrated with the mammalian two hybrid tests (Fig. 2B), AR interacted with ASC2-2b that consists of the ASC-2 residues 622-849 (13Lee S.-K. Jung S.Y. Kim Y.S. Na S.Y. Lee Y.C. Lee J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) in a testosterone-independent manner, whereas it did not interact with other regions of ASC-2 including the N-terminal and C-terminal NR boxes (data not shown). Furthermore, from whole cell lysates of HEK293 cells cotransfected with expression vector for AR, αAR and αASC-2 antibodies co-immunoprecipitated ASC-2 and AR, respectively (Fig. 2C and data not shown). Consistent with the mammalian two hybrid tests, these interactions were also ligand-independent. To further probe the physiological significance of these interactions, we examined whether these two proteins are co-localized within the known target cells of AR in vivo. Indeed, we have found that ASC-2 is co-expressed with AR in the nuclei of Sertoli and Leydig cells, the major target cells of AR in testis (22Zhang H. Liao L. Kuang S.Q. Xu J. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 1435-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2D). However, it is important to note that we failed to detect any direct interaction between radio-labeled ASC-2 or ASC2-2b and GST fusion to AR as well as radio-labeled AR and GST-ASC2-2b (data not shown). These results imply that AR likely binds to ASC-2 via other adaptor protein(s) in vivo; i.e. the AR-ASC-2 interactions are indirect. Rb as a Putative Adaptor between ASC-2 and AR—Rb was previously shown to function as a coactivator of AR via direct protein-protein interactions (19Yeh S. Miyamoto H. Nishimura K. Kang H. Ludlow J. Hsiao P. Wang C. Su C. Chang C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Notably, these interactions were testosterone-independent similar to the indirect interactions of AR and ASC-2 (Fig. 2). Thus, we explored the possibility of Rb being the putative adaptor protein that mediates the AR-ASC-2 interactions in vivo. To test this idea, we transfected 293T cells with expression vectors for ASC-2, AR, and Rb. From the whole cell lysates of these cells, Rb was co-immunoprecipitated by αASC-2 antibody, and αAR antibody readily co-immunoprecipitated Rb in a ligand-independent manner (data not shown), consistent with the reported results (19Yeh S. Miyamoto H. Nishimura K. Kang H. Ludlow J. Hsiao P. Wang C. Su C. Chang C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Similarly, the endogenous Rb and ASC-2 were co-immunoprecipitated from HL60 cells (Fig. 3A). Indicative of direct protein-protein interactions, radio-labeled ASC-2 readily interacted with GST fusion to Rb in the GST-pull down assays, and these interactions were localized to two independent subregions of Rb (Fig. 3B). We further localized the Rb-interacting region of ASC-2 to ASC2-2b in the mammalian two hybrid tests (Fig. 3C). It is important to note that this region of ASC-2 is identical to the indirect, AR-interacting domain we have localized (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these results suggest that Rb may act as an adaptor protein between AR and ASC-2. Rb Effects ASC-2 to Mediate AR Transactivation—In cotransfections of HeLa cells, overexpression of ASC2-2b suppressed the AR transactivation (Fig. 4A), consistent with the importance of the ASC-2-AR/ASC-2-Rb interactions. Similarly, coexpression of Gal4 fusion to ASC2-2b also inhibited the AR transactivation (data not shown). Moreover, ectopic expression of Rb appeared to effect the ability of ASC-2 to mediate the AR transactivation in Saos2 cells that lack Rb (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these results further suggest that Rb is important for ASC-2 to mediate the AR transactivation. It is also possible that the previously described, AR-coactivator function of Rb (19Yeh S. Miyamoto H. Nishimura K. Kang H. Ludlow J. Hsiao P. Wang C. Su C. Chang C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) could have resulted from this indirect recruitment of ASC-2 to AR via Rb. Overall, our results strongly suggest that ASC-2 acts as a specific coactivator of AR in conjunction with Rb. We have recently found that ASC-2 exists as a steady-state complex of ∼2 MDa (26Goo Y.H. Sohn Y.C. Kim D.H. Kim S.W. Kang M.J. Jung D.J. Kwak E. Barlev N.A. Berger S.L. Chow V.Y. Roeder R.G. Azorsa D.O. Meltzer P.S. Suh P.G. Song E.J. Lee K.J. Lee Y.C. Lee J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 140-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). This complex named ASC-2 complex contains ALR-1 and its splicing isoform ALR-2, ALR-like protein HALR, ASH2, the Rb-binding protein RBQ-3, and α/β-tubulins (26Goo Y.H. Sohn Y.C. Kim D.H. Kim S.W. Kang M.J. Jung D.J. Kwak E. Barlev N.A. Berger S.L. Chow V.Y. Roeder R.G. Azorsa D.O. Meltzer P.S. Suh P.G. Song E.J. Lee K.J. Lee Y.C. Lee J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 140-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In particular, ALR-1/ALR-2 and HALR exhibit specific histone methyltransferase (HMT) activity toward histone H3-lysine 4, and thus ASCOM represents the first nuclear receptor coactivator complex associated with this important histone modification function (26Goo Y.H. Sohn Y.C. Kim D.H. Kim S.W. Kang M.J. Jung D.J. Kwak E. Barlev N.A. Berger S.L. Chow V.Y. Roeder R.G. Azorsa D.O. Meltzer P.S. Suh P.G. Song E.J. Lee K.J. Lee Y.C. Lee J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 140-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Therefore, our working model (Fig. 4C) predicts that a ternary interaction of AR, Rb, and ASC-2 effects the recruitment of this ASC-2 complex/ASCOM to AR. Notably, other proteins such as the Rb-binding protein RBQ-3 (27Saijo M. Sakai Y. Kishino T. Niikawa N. Matsuura Y. Morino K. Tamai K. Taya Y. Genomics. 1995; 27: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) may also provide additional interaction interfaces to stabilize this AR/Rb/ASC-2/ASCOM supracomplex. In turn, ASCOM is expected to exert its yet unknown regulatory functions on AR transactivation, which may involve chromatin remodeling of AR target genes via its histone methylation activities. We have recently established mouse genetic models that specifically inactivate the methylation function of ASCOM, 2D. K. Lee and J. W. Lee, unpublished results. and these mice may provide important insights into the exact regulatory functions of ASC-2/ASCOM with AR and other nuclear receptors. Finally, it should be noted that the ASC-2-Rb interactions we defined in this report may also play an important role with other target transcription factors of ASC-2. In summary, we have found that the nuclear receptor coactivator ASC-2 contains at least three distinct receptor-interacting domains; two LXXLL-type NR boxes and an indirect, AR-interacting region that likely involves Rb as a bridging/adaptor protein. Overall, our results attest to the importance of ASC-2 as a major adaptor unit that a series of different nuclear receptors utilize to recruit the ASC-2 complex (26Goo Y.H. Sohn Y.C. Kim D.H. Kim S.W. Kang M.J. Jung D.J. Kwak E. Barlev N.A. Berger S.L. Chow V.Y. Roeder R.G. Azorsa D.O. Meltzer P.S. Suh P.G. Song E.J. Lee K.J. Lee Y.C. Lee J.W. Mol. Cell.

https://openalex.org/W2163997753,"Trypanosomatid small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) genes are clustered in the genome. snoRNAs are transcribed polycistronically and processed into mature RNAs. In this study, we characterized four snoRNA clusters in <i>Leptomonas collosoma</i>. All of the clusters analyzed carry both C/D and H/ACA RNAs. The H/ACA RNAs are composed of a single hairpin, a structure typical to trypanosome and archaea guide RNAs. Using deletion and mutational analysis of a tagged C/D snoRNA situated within the snoRNA cluster, we identified 10-nucleotide flanking sequences that are essential for processing snoRNA from its precursor. Chromosome walk was performed on a snoRNA cluster, and a sequence of 700 bp was identified between the first repeat and the upstream open reading frame. Cloning of this sequence in an episome vector enhanced the expression of a tagged snoRNA gene in an orientation-dependent manner. However, continuous transcript spanning of this region was detected in steady-state RNA, suggesting that snoRNA transcription also originates from an upstream-long polycistronic transcriptional unit. The 700-bp fragment may therefore represent an example of many more elements to be discovered that enhance transcription along the chromosome, especially when transcription from the upstream gene is reduced or when enhanced transcription is needed."
https://openalex.org/W2128915325,"The effects of orthophosphate, nucleotide analogues, ADP, and covalent phosphorylation on the tryptic fragmentation patterns of the E1 and E2 forms of scallop Ca-ATPase were examined. Sites preferentially cleaved by trypsin in the E1 form of the Ca-ATPase were detected in the nucleotide (N) and phosphorylation (P) domains, as well as the actuator (A) domain. These sites were occluded in the E2 (Ca(2+)-free) form of the enzyme, consistent with mutual protection of the A, N, and P domains through their association into a clustered structure. Similar protection of cytoplasmic Ca(2+)-dependent tryptic cleavage sites was observed when the catalytic binding site for substrate on the E1 form of scallop Ca-ATPase was occupied by Pi, AMP-PNP, AMP-PCP, or ADP despite the presence of saturating levels of Ca2+. These results suggest that occupation of the catalytic site on E1 can induce condensation of the cytoplasmic domains to yield a unique structural intermediate that may be related to the form of the enzyme in which the active site is prepared for phosphoryl transfer. The effect of Pi on the E2 form of the scallop Ca-ATPase was also investigated, when it was found that formation of E2-P led to extreme resistance toward secondary cleavage by trypsin and stabilization of enzymatic activity for long periods of time."
