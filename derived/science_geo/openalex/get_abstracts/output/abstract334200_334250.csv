https://openalex.org/W1981365449,"A glass exhibiting structural memory has been produced through the compression of a single crystal of AlPO(4) berlinite to 18 gigapascals at 300 kelvin. The unique and extraordinary characteristic of this glass is that upon decompression below 5 gigapascals it transforms back into a single crystal with the same orientation as the starting crystal. This glass has a ""memory"" of the previous crystallographic orientation of the crystal from which it forms."

Taken by this route, the drug causes an effect similar to that from an intravenous dose, and much more intense than that from ingestion. The detailed mechanism of action differs from that of cocaine, but the overall stimulant effect of methamphetamine is similar. Methamphetamine effects, however, persist for hours, whereas cocaine effects are over in minutes. Ice is, therefore, just another agent for abuse by those seeking psychostimulation and, as with cocaine, compulsive abusers of amphetamines consume the drug repeatedly and continuously. Unlike cocaine, methamphetamine is a synthetic compound and is manufactured in illicit laboratories within the United States."
https://openalex.org/W2026761805,"Microscopic inclusions of aqueous fluids trapped in interstices in quartz and other crystals provide novel systems for the deliberate study of liquids under tension. Liquids under tension should differ in interesting ways from those at ambient pressure or compressed liquids because attractive, rather than repulsive, forces should dominate their behavior. Static tensions in excess of 100 megapascals (~1000 atmospheres) have been obtained reproducibly. Video-recorded observations of the final liquid rupture process, coupled with extrapolations of data at positive pressure, suggest that the homogeneous vapor nucleation point was reached in two of the cases studied. Raman spectra of the fluids at -80 megapascals show that an isothermal volume stretch of -5 percent by volume has only a weak effect on the spectral features and is similar to the effect of isobaric heating."

In a 25 May speech responding to greenhouse warming predictions made by the IPCC science working group, Margaret Thatcher said that Britain would reduce the proposed growth of its CO{sub 2} emissions enough to stabilize them at 1990 levels by 2005 if other countries did their part. Yet the United States, Japan, and other countries that emit substantial quantities of greenhouse gases continue to resist potentially expensive emission-reduction targets or control measures, citing continuing uncertainties about the extent, timing, and distribution of future climate change and its economic consequences. Similarly, developing countries are unlikely to agree to emissions targets or control measures that they perceive as impeding their economic development and will almost certainly condition their participation on a commitment by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries to provide additional development assistance. A central task for a climate convention will be to provide the international community with a permanent mechanism for coordinating its efforts to deal withmore » climate change.« less"
