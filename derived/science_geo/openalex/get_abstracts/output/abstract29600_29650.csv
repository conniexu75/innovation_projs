https://openalex.org/W2047431989,"Priming is a nonconscious form of human memory, which is concerned with perceptual identification of words and objects and which has only recently been recognized as separate from other forms of memory or memory systems. It is currently under intense experimental scrutiny. Evidence is converging for the proposition that priming is an expression of a perceptual representation system that operates at a pre-semantic level; it emerges early in development, and access to it lacks the kind of flexibility characteristic of other cognitive memory systems. Conceptual priming, however, seems to be based on the operations of semantic memory."

https://openalex.org/W2042412060,"The S. pombe nuc2+ gene is required for mitotic chromosome disjunction. Its mutation arrests mitosis at the metaphase. The gene product is present in the nuclear scaffold-like fraction. The nuc2+ protein contains a domain, separated from ten 34 amino acid repeat segments, that is capable of binding AT-rich DNA in vitro. The ts mutation resides in one of the 34 amino acid repeats. Circular dichroism, limited proteolysis of the repeats, and model fitting indicate the presence of helical segments connected by protease-sensitive hinges. We propose that these repeats form a novel secondary structure (snap helix) having ""knob and hole"" helix-associating motifs. The packing of the snap helices would be stabilized by the bonding between the hydrophobic amino acids surrounding the knobs and holes. The nuc2+ protein may in one way bind to DNA and in another way mutually associate to form a part of the chromosome scaffold."
https://openalex.org/W2058145765,"The pea cDNA clone pPsENOD12 represents a gene involved in the infection process during Pisum sativum L.-Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae symbiosis. The ENOD12 protein is composed of pentapeptides containing two hydroxyprolines. The expression of the ENOD12 gene is induced in cells through which the infection thread is migrating, but also in cells that do not yet contain an infection thread. Soluble compounds from Rhizobium are involved in eliciting ENOD12 gene expression. Rhizobium common and host-specific nodulation genes are essential for the production of these compounds. Two ENOD12 genes are expressed in nodules and in stem tissue of uninoculated plants. The gene represented by the cloned ENOD12 mRNA is also expressed in flowers, but a different transcription start may be used."
https://openalex.org/W1490848194,"Chronic exposure to ethanol results in heterologous desensitization of receptors coupled to adenylyl cyclase via Gs, the stimulatory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein. Ethanol-induced accumulation of extracellular adenosine is required for the development of heterologous desensitization (Nagy, L. E., Diamond, I., Collier, K., Lopez, L., Ullman, B., and Gordon, A. S., Mol. Pharmacol., in press). To understand the mechanism underlying ethanol-induced increases in extracellular adenosine, we examined the interaction of ethanol with the adenosine transport system in S49 lymphoma cells. We found that ethanol inhibited nucleoside uptake without affecting deoxyglucose or isoleucine transport. Inhibition of adenosine uptake was due to decreased influx via the nucleoside transporter. Thus, ethanol-induced increases in extracellular adenosine appear to be due to inhibition of adenosine influx. After chronic exposure to ethanol, cells became tolerant to the acute effects of ethanol, i.e. ethanol no longer inhibited uptake. Consequently, ethanol no longer increased extracellular adenosine concentrations. Taken together with our previous studies, these results suggest that ethanol inhibition of adenosine influx leads to an increase in extracellular adenosine which causes an initial increase in intracellular cAMP levels and subsequent development of heterologous desensitization of cAMP signal transduction."

In the present study, a novel isoprenoid-modification was identified by labeling HeLa cells with [3H]mevalonic acid and analyzing proteolytic digests of the total cell protein. Radioactive fragments were purified from these digests and treated with Raney nickel. The released, labeled material was analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry (MS). This approach revealed that an alltrans geranylgeranyl group was a major isoprenoid modification."

https://openalex.org/W1557110838,"Serum mannan-binding protein (S-MBP), a lectin specific for mannose and N-acetylglucosamine, was documented to activate complement through the classical pathway. In this study, we examined the mechanism that initiates this activation. By a passive hemolysis test using sheep erythrocytes coated with yeast mannan, the activation of complement by human S-MBP was shown to proceed in the absence of C1q. The following binding studies using 125I-labeled C1r2s2 and C1s indicated that the activated form of C1r2s2 bound to S-MBP located on the surface of the cells with high affinity. The binding of C1s to the cell-bound S-MBP require the presence of C1r, suggesting that C1r2s2 binds to S-MBP through C1r. The activation of C1s from a proenzyme to a protease was mediated by cell-bound S-MBP in the presence of C1r and the activated protease remained associated with the cells and was not released into the medium. The activation of complement with S-MBP was a solid phase event and did not proceed in a fluid phase. On the basis of these results, it was concluded that S-MBP is responsible for the initiation of carbohydrate-mediated complement activation as C1q does in immune complex-mediated complement activation."

https://openalex.org/W1525441378,"Thrombin-activated porcine factor VIII (fVIIIaIIa) is a stable, active, 160-kDa heterotrimer at concentrations exceeding 2 x 10(-7) M in 0.7 M NaCl, 0.01 M histidine Cl, 5 mM CaCl2, pH 6.0, at 4 degrees C or 20 degrees C. Two of the subunits, fVIIIA1 and fVIIIA2, are derived from the heavy chain of the plasma-derived, heterodimeric fVIII precursor. The third subunit, fVIIIA3-C1-C2, is derived from the fVIII light chain. We now find that fVIIIaIIa undergoes a sharp decline in coagulant activity between pH 7 and 8. At pH 7.5, the activity of fVIIIaIIa at 3 x 10(-7) M decays within a few hours to a stable level that is approximately 70% of the value at pH 6.0, whereas at pH 8.0, greater than 99% of the activity is lost. The activity cannot be restored by readjusting the pH to 6.0. The loss of activity at pH 8.0 coincides with dissociation of the fVIIIA2 subunit since an inactive fVIIIA1/A3-C1-C2 heterodimer can be isolated by Mono S high performance liquid chromatography. After prolonged incubation at pH 8.0, the fVIIIA1 subunit also dissociates. The free fVIIIA2 fragment appears to be poorly soluble which may explain the irreversible loss of activity. Analytical velocity sedimentation of the pH-inactivated fVIIIaIIa preparation also is consistent with dissociation and precipitation of the fVIIIA2 fragment. We propose that denaturation of fVIIIaIIa by pH-dependent subunit dissociation may provide a major mechanism of inactivation of fVIIIaIIa under physiologic conditions."

https://openalex.org/W1569439329,"Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) has been implicated as having a central role in the postinflammatory tissue regeneration and fibrosis. To test its potential involvement in events that follow hepatotoxin-mediated liver regeneration and fibrosis, we quantitated changes in the steady-state levels of TGFβ mRNA in parenchymal and nonparenchymal cells at various times after an acute treatment with CCl4, and also compared TGFβ gene expression in these two cell types from livers subjected to chronic CCl4 treatment. The parenchymal and nonparenchymal cells from normal liver contained undetectable amounts of TGFβ mRNA. In contrast, we could readily detect TGFβ specific transcripts in both the parenchymal and nonparenchymal cells after acute injury. Nonparenchymal cells from acutely injured liver contained fivefold greater amounts of TGFβ mRNA, which peaked at 48 h and declined thereafter. In chronically treated rat livers (1, 2, 3, and 7 wk after the initiation of CCl4 treatment), increased expression of TGFβ mRNA was found only in nonparenchymal cells obtained after 2-3 wk of treatment. Strikingly large elevations in the steady-state levels of β-actin mRNA in CCl4-treated liver were also observed, which may be related to the known regenerative processes associated with acute liver toxicity. Changing dynamics of TGFβ gene expression, therefore, appear to be an important attribute of regenerating liver after acute or chronic CCl4 toxicity.— Armendariz-Borunda, J.; Seyer, J. M.; Kang, A. H.; Raghow, R. Regulation of TGFβ gene expression in rat liver intoxicated with carbon tetrachloride. FASEB J. 4: 215-221; 1990."
https://openalex.org/W1531324966,"Transcription and Northern dot blot analyses were used to determine the relationship between light-induced changes in RNA levels and transcription in barley and maize plastids. Overall plastid transcription activity is near maximum and largely light independent in apical sections of 4.5-day-old dark-grown barley seedings. With continued development in the dark, transcription activity in barley plastids declined precipitously, but transcription could be reactivated if plants were illuminated. Illumination of 8-day-old dark-grown barley seedlings increased the transcription of psbA, rbcL, and 16 S rDNA; however, the stimulation of psbA transcription was 2-4-fold more than rbcL or 16 S rDNA. Differential enhancement of psbA transcription occurred when 4.5- or 8-day-old dark-grown seedlings were illuminated, and the influence persisted in plants illuminated for 72 h. Illumination of 8-day-old dark-grown barley caused an increase in psbA and rbcL mRNA levels, but the increase in psbA mRNA was greater than that of rbcL. Similarly, illumination of 9-day-old dark-grown maize increased plastid transcription activity and the levels of psbA and rbcL mRNA. These results indicate that light can modulate overall plastid transcription activity and differentially stimulate the transcription of genes including psbA."
https://openalex.org/W2066249095,"Monkeys that were trained to perform auditory and visual short-term memory tasks (delayed matching-to-sample) received lesions of the auditory association cortex in the superior temporal gyrus. Although visual memory was completely unaffected by the lesions, auditory memory was severely impaired. Despite this impairment, all monkeys could discriminate sounds closer in frequency than those used in the auditory memory task. This result suggests that the superior temporal cortex plays a role in auditory processing and retention similar to the role the inferior temporal cortex plays in visual processing and retention."
https://openalex.org/W1754692597,"Low concentrations of arsenite, but not arsenate, and Cd2+ blocked steroid binding to the glucocorticoid receptors of HTC cells. Inhibition by arsenite was faster and occurred at lower concentrations than for Cd2+. Half-maximal inhibition of [3H]dexamethasone binding was seen after a 30-min preincubation with approximately 7 microM arsenite. The effect of arsenite and of Cd2+ appears to be mediated by a reaction with vicinal dithiols of the receptor as shown by (a) the reversal of arsenite inhibition by much lower concentrations of dithiothreitol (approximately 0.1 mM) than of beta-mercaptoethanol (approximately 10 mM); (b) the ability of both arsenite and Cd2+ to block [3H]dexamethasone 21-mesylate labeling of receptors but not of other thiol-containing proteins; and (c) the known selectivity of arsenite and of Cd2+ for reactions with vicinal dithiols. Arsenite forms a tight complex with these vicinal dithiols since the removal of loosely associated arsenite by gel exclusion chromatography did not reverse the inhibition of steroid binding. The effect of other ions on steroid binding was also examined. Half-maximal inhibition of binding occurred with approximately 5 microM selenite, whereas up to 300 microM Zn2+ was without effect. Much higher concentrations of arsenite were required for effects on unactivated and activated complexes. Arsenite slowly induced a loss of unactivated complexes but rapidly inhibited a portion of the DNA binding of activated complexes. Any effect on activation occurred at arsenite concentrations equal to or higher than those that inhibited DNA binding. In contrast, Cd2+ concentrations similar to those that block steroid binding caused a biphasic loss of unactivated complexes and a marginal loss of activated complexes. This is the first report of effects of arsenite on glucocorticoid receptors. These results confirm directly our earlier hypothesis that steroid binding to rat glucocorticoid receptors involves a vicinal dithiol (Miller, N. R., and Simons, S. S., Jr. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 15217-15225) and show that arsenite is a potent new reagent for probing receptor structure and function."

The reconstituted vesicles, lacking resident lumenal proteins, translocated in vitro-synthesized preprolactin in a cotranslational, SRP-dependent manner. The translocated precursor was processed to mature prolactin and protected from digestion by exogenous protease. Vesicles were also reconstituted from detergent extracts depleted of glycoproteins by chromatography on concanavalin-Sepharose. The depleted vesicles, containing a full complement of SRP receptor but deficient in the glycoprotein subunit of signal peptidase, the ribophorins, and other glycoprotein components, were functional in the targeting and binding of nascent preprolactin but exhibited a greatly diminished capacity for translocation."
https://openalex.org/W1988901023,"A SINGLE base-pair mutation (βs) in codon 6 of the human β-globin gene, causing a single amino-acid substitution, is the cause of sickle cell anaemia1. The mutant haemoglobin molecule, HbS, polymerizes when deoxygenated and causes deformation of the erythrocytes to a characteristic 'sickled' shape. Sickling of cells in small vessels causes painful crises and other life-threatening complications2,3. Although the molecular basis for sickle cell anaemia has been known for 30 years, no definitive treatment is available4. An animal model of sickle cell anaemia would not only allow a detailed analysis of the factors that initiate erythrocyte sickling in vivo and of the pathophysiology of the disease, but would also permit the development of novel approaches to the treatment of the disease. By using the dominant control region sequences from the human β-globin locus, together with human α and βS-globin genes, we have obtained three transgenic mice with HbS levels ranging from 10 to 80% of total haemoglobin in their red cells. As observed in homozygous and heterozygous Hbspatients, the erythrocytes of this mouse sickle readily on deoxygenation. Irreversibly sickled cells2,3, which are characteristic of sickle-cell patients homozygous for βs, are also observed in the peripheral blood of the mouse with high levels of HbS."
https://openalex.org/W1588013556,"We report a study of the spontaneous formation of ordered arrays of microtubules in solution. Form birefringence and anisotropic light-scattering appear rapidly and spontaneously when tubulin, initially present in homogeneous solution, self-assembles into microtubules. This phenomenon is reversible and occurs at protein concentrations of a few milligrams per ml, in the presence or absence of microtubule-associated proteins. Light and electron microscopic examination reveals that extensive regions of these birefringent solutions consist of nearly parallel microtubules. Measurement of the order parameter, S, yields a value of 0.81 +/- 0.05, indicating a high degree of alignment. Comparison of these observations to qualitative predictions developed from the theory of Onsager ((1949) Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 51, 627-659) leads to the conclusion that microtubules form a nematic liquid crystalline phase in vitro under ordinary conditions. Simultaneous spectrophotometric observation of turbidity (a measure of microtubule assembly) and birefringence shows that the parallel ordering lags only slightly behind assembly, thus demonstrating that much microtubule growth must occur by addition of tubulin to the ends of microtubules that are already aligned. These observations of anisotropy are important to the understanding of microtubule dynamics in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1576383249,"Cathepsin G is a neutral serine protease that is found in the azurophil granules of neutrophils and monocytes. Previous experiments had demonstrated that cathepsin G is actively produced by the promonocytic U937 cell line, and that 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced differentiation of these cells toward macrophages resulted in a reduction of cathepsin G activity. In this study, we have analyzed the mechanism of this TPA-induced down-regulatory event. Using in situ hybridization techniques, we demonstrated that cathepsin G mRNA is detectable only at the promyelocytic stage of myeloid development. Using U937 promonocytic cells as a model, we demonstrated; 1) cathepsin G protein levels decline in TPA-treated cells; 2) this decline was due to a nearly complete loss of cathepsin G mRNA in cells treated with TPA for 24 h; and 3) the rate of cathepsin G mRNA loss with TPA treatment was similar to that with actinomycin D. These results suggested that cathepsin G transcription was down-regulated within several hours of TPA addition. This was directly tested by performing nuclear run-off assays of TPA-treated U937 cells; cathepsin G transcription was shown to be strand-specific, and declined within 4 h of TPA addition. Cathepsin G transcription was essentially undetectable 8 or more hours after TPA treatment, suggesting that down-regulation is predominantly transcriptional. Cycloheximide treatment of U937 cells resulted in a partial block of TPA-mediated cathepsin G down-regulation, indicating that continuous protein synthesis is required for down-regulation to occur. A newly synthesized protein or proteins may therefore be required for the transcriptional down-regulation of cathepsin G during the normal development of promyelocytes or promonocytes."

https://openalex.org/W1606436085,"Activity of lysosomal glucosylceramidase is stimulated by two small glycoproteins, saposin A and C, which are, together with two other similar glycoproteins, derived from a single precursor protein. This enzyme is also stimulated by naturally occurring acidic lipids, such as phosphatidylserine and gangliosides. Using highly purified glucosylceramidase, saposins, and acidic lipids, the mechanism of enzyme stimulation was studied by investigating complex formation between the three components and by examining effects on activity caused by changing amounts of saposins and acidic lipids, individually or in combination. The results indicated that acidic lipids form a water-soluble complex with glucosylceramidase but not with saposins and that saposins and acidic lipids each bind to the enzyme at two different sites for the activation. Based on these observations, the previously proposed three-binding sites model of glucosylceramidase, activator, and substrate was modified to one composed of four binding sites: one for carbohydrate of the substrate, one for aglycon, one for acidic lipids, and one for saposins."
https://openalex.org/W1486200691,"In order to isolate a human gene encoding an alpha-(1,3)fucosyltransferase (alpha-(1,3)Fuc-T), genomic DNA from HL-60 cells was transfected by several methods into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Colonies expressing alpha-(1,3)Fuc-T activity were identified by their ability to bind a monoclonal antibody (anti-SSEA-1) that recognizes the carbohydrate product of alpha-(1,3)Fuc-T action. CHO cells do not express alpha-(1,3)Fuc-T activity but contain at least two, silent alpha-(1,3)Fuc-T genes previously identified by their activation in the rare, dominant mutants LEC11 and LEC12. These CHO enzymes were shown to be distinguishable from the alpha-(1,3)Fuc-T activity of HL-60 cells by the latter's comparative inability to transfer fucose to paragloboside and fetuin. Based on these criteria, only 11 isolates from more than 70 putative transfectants examined were found to stably express an alpha-(1,3)Fuc-T activity typical of HL-60 cells. Genomic DNA from two of these isolates was used to generate five independent secondary transfectants with HL-60-like alpha-(1,3)Fuc-T activity. Southern analysis revealed a common DNA fragment that hybridized to an Alu probe in each secondary, providing evidence that a human alpha-(1,3)Fuc-T gene had been transfected. However, in all transfection experiments, isolates that expressed alpha-(1,3)Fuc-T activities similar to CHO-encoded enzymes were also obtained. Several lines of evidence indicated that these cells arose from activation of endogenous CHO alpha-(1,3)Fuc-T genes as a consequence of DNA transfection. These false positives complicated the identification of transfectants expressing a human alpha-(1,3)Fuc-T gene and represent an important consideration in experiments to transfect other glycosyltransferase genes."
https://openalex.org/W1490962069,"We examined the characteristics of an arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase in bovine tracheal epithelial cells in relation to the enzyme expressed in leukocytes and platelets. Homogenous preparations of intact or disrupted tracheal epithelial cells metabolized arachidonic acid predominantly to (12S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, and subcellular fractionation by differential centrifugation demonstrated that the 12-lipoxygenase activity was localized predominantly to the 100,000 x g supernatant (cytosol fraction). Analysis of cytosolic enzymatic activity for pH dependence (maximum activity at pH 7.4-8.0), divalent cation effects (no dependence on cations), and kinetic characteristics (lag phase elimination by addition of hydroperoxide) exhibited similarity to leukocyte and platelet 12-lipoxygenases. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that the epithelial 12-lipoxygenase reacted with a monoclonal antibody (lox-2) directed against leukocyte 12-lipoxygenase but not with an antibody (HPLO-3) against the platelet enzyme. Immunoaffinity chromatography of the epithelial 100,000 x g supernatant fraction using lox-2 linked to Affi-Prep 10 yielded a single predominant protein band (Mr = 72,000) by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis identical in apparent mass to the bovine leukocyte lipoxygenase. Western blotting using a polyclonal antibody to leukocyte 12-lipoxygenase showed peroxidase staining of the same 72-kDa protein band. Activity assays of the purified enzymes demonstrated that substrate specificity for the epithelial 12-lipoxygenase was similar to that of the leukocyte enzyme, but the epithelial enzyme more efficiently converted 18-carbon fatty acids to the corresponding monohydroxylated conjugated dienes. We conclude that bovine tracheal epithelial cells express a 12-lipoxygenase that has immunological reactivity similar to leukocyte and distinct from platelet 12-lipoxygenase and possesses substrate specificity distinct from both enzymes. We further suggest that lipoxygenase heterogeneity may provide a basis for different functional roles for the enzyme in different cell types."
https://openalex.org/W1654405751,"Previous studies indicated that both plasma-derived and recombinant human factor VIIa specifically interacted with tissue factor on the surface of a human bladder carcinoma cell line (J82). In the presence of calcium ions, factor VIIa interacted with approximately 300,000 binding sites/cell with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 3.25 nM (Sakai, T., Lund-Hansen, T., Paborsky, L., Pedersen, A. H., and Kisiel, W. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 9980-9988). In this study, we compare recombinant human factor VIIa and a preparation of recombinant human factor VIIa lacking the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid domain (GD-rVIIa) with respect to their interaction with J82 cell surface tissue factor. Interaction of GD-rVIIa with J82 monolayers at 37 degrees C was specific, saturable, and exhibited a hyperbolic profile. Scatchard plots of the binding data obtained at 37 degrees C indicated a single class of binding sites for GD-rVIIa with a Kd value of 2.5 nM. GD-rVIIa interacted with about 10,000 binding sites/cell. In contrast to the tissue factor-specific binding observed for intact factor VIIa, specific binding of GD-rVIIa to the J82 cell surface was neither influenced by calcium nor blocked by prior incubation of the cells with polyclonal anti-tissue factor apoprotein IgG. In addition, cell-bound GD-rVIIa failed to activate human factor X. These results indicate that the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid domain of factor VIIa is essential for its interaction with cell surface tissue factor."

https://openalex.org/W1517846338,"Alcohol metabolism via alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and catalase was studied in perfused rat livers by measuring the oxidation of methanol and butanol, selective substrates for catalase and ADH, respectively. In livers from fasted rats, basal rates of methanol uptake of 15 +/- 1 mumol/g/h were decreased significantly to 8 +/- 2 mumol/g/h by addition of butanol. Concomitantly, pyridine nucleotide fluorescence detected from the liver surface was increased by butanol but not methanol. Both effects of butanol were blocked by an inhibitor of ADH, 4-methylpyrazole, consistent with the hypothesis that elevation of the NADH redox state by butanol inhibited H2O2 production via NAD+-requiring peroxisomal beta-oxidation, leading indirectly to diminished rates of catalase-dependent methanol uptake. In support of this idea, both butanol and butyraldehyde inhibited H2O2 generation. The NADH redox state was also elevated by xylitol, causing a 75% decrease in rates of methanol uptake by livers from fasted rats. This effect was not observed in livers from fed rats unless malate-aspartate shuttle activity was reduced by infusion of the transaminase inhibitor aminooxyacetate. Taken together, these data indicate that generation of reducing equivalents from ADH in the cytosol inhibits H2O2 generation leading to significantly diminished rates of peroxidation of alcohols via catalase. This phenomenon may represent an important physiological mechanism of regulation of ethanol oxidation in intact cells."
https://openalex.org/W1509262890,"The Xenopus oocyte is widely used to study the various aspects of eukaryotic cell structure and function. It is also being used increasingly in expression cloning of cDNAs encoding proteins for which there are no structural data. One of the drawbacks of the Xenopus oocyte system is that individual oocytes taken at the same time from the same frog vary considerably in the amount of protein synthesized from the same amount of injected mRNA. In this report we describe the preparation and use of the mRNA for a secreted mutant form of human placental alkaline phosphatase as an internal, coinjected standard to monitor translation in oocytes. Secreted alkaline phosphatase can be readily determined in the medium of cultured oocytes by using a standard colorimetric assay. The amounts of alkaline phosphatase secreted into the medium were shown to parallel the level of expression of two membrane proteins. This permits rapid identification and selection of those oocytes that efficiently express injected mRNAs. The procedure yields more precise data and results in an enormous saving of time and expense, especially in investigations that involve complex measurements on individual oocytes.—Tate, S.

Two peptides located within the N-terminal extracellular domain specifically bound kappa-BGT in a solid phase assay, i.e. peptide N alpha(3)51-70 with a Kd approximately 300 nM and peptide N alpha(3)1-18 with slightly lower affinity (Kd approximately 500 nM). Preincubation of 125I-kappa-BGT with peptides N alpha(3)51-70 or N alpha(3)1-18 resulted in greater than 90% inhibition of kappa-125I-BGT binding to native N-nAChR expressed on the neuronal cell line PC12. Under the same conditions, two additional peptides, N alpha(3)180-199 and N alpha(3)183-201, were found to inhibit kappa-125I-BGT binding to PC12 by approximately 50%. These latter peptides represent sequences that are homologous to those shown previously to bind alpha-bungarotoxin. Peptide N alpha(3)51-70 (400 microM) also reduced by approximately 4-fold the observed rate of association of kappa-BGT to PC12 cells. The results of these experiments identify sequence segments of the alpha 3 subunit which are likely to interact with kappa-BGT and may indicate the relative contribution that these segments make in the formation of the high affinity kappa-BGT-binding site of this N-nAChR subtype."
https://openalex.org/W1562523619,"The human alcohol dehydrogenase gene ADH2 is expressed at high levels in the liver. At least five different complexes between nuclear proteins from mouse liver or rat hepatoma cells and the proximal promoter region extending from nucleotides -188 to +31 are detected by gel retardation assays. Using oligonucleotides to compete for the binding, and also as the probes, allowed localization of sequences within this region that bind nuclear proteins. Mutated oligonucleotides did not bind or compete. Nucleotides which are contacted by the proteins have been localized by methylation interference assays to two regions homologous to the related mouse Adh-1 gene. One maps between nucleotides -94 and -84; the other is from nucleotides -72 through -64. The 5' region of the human ADH2 gene is capable of directing accurate in vitro transcription in extracts from hepatoma cells. Deletion analysis indicates that the smallest portion of the proximal promoter region capable of directing significant transcription extends to nucleotide -93, which just contains both of the identified contact regions. The longer promoter fragments do not work as well, suggesting the presence of negative elements. In vitro transcription assays using oligonucleotides and mutated oligonucleotides as competitors demonstrate that both of the cis-acting sequences identified here are important to efficient initiation of transcription from the ADH2 promoter."

The complete amino acid sequence of a linker subunit (chain AV) has been determined by automated Edman sequencing of the peptides derived by digestions with lysyl endopeptidase and endoproteinase Asp-N. The chain is composed of 224 amino acid residues, and the molecular mass for the protein moiety was calculated to be 24,894 Da. An Asn-X-Thr sequence which is possible as a glycosylation site was suggested at positions 108-110. A computer-assisted homology search showed that the sequence shows no notable homology with any other globins and proteins. However a careful alignment of the linker sequence with a heme-containing chain sequence suggested that there is a slight, but significant homology between the two sequences. The alignment also suggested that the linker resulted from gene duplication of a heme-containing chain with a three exon-two intron structure, and that the first exon of domain 1 and the last exon of domain 2 had been lost during evolution. In our alignment, domain 1 has the heme-binding proximal histidine, but domain 2 does not. This is the first linker subunit to be sequenced completely."
https://openalex.org/W1533884457,"Peroxide-induced state 3 respiratory inhibition and Ca2+ efflux in isolated renal mitochondria exhibited a NADH-linked substrate dependence. ADP-stimulated respiratory rates in the presence of various concentrations of tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBOOH, 0-1000 nmol/mg protein) were determined using glutamate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, or pyruvate as substrates. Pyruvate-driven respiration was most sensitive to inhibition (Ki approximately equal to 75 nmol of tBOOH/mg protein) followed by beta-hydroxybutyrate and glutamate (Ki approximately equal to 150 nmol of tBOOH/mg protein for each). Calcium (5-10 nmol/mg protein) potentiated tBOOH-induced respiratory inhibition using all three substrates. Mitochondrial Ca2+ efflux, induced by tBOOH, was most pronounced with pyruvate as substrate. Glutamate prevented Ca2+ efflux while the efflux rate with beta-hydroxybutyrate was intermediate between glutamate and pyruvate. The substrate-dependent pattern of tBOOH-induced NAD(P)H (NADH plus NADPH) and cytochrome b oxidation was similar to that seen for respiratory inhibition and Ca2+ efflux suggesting that NAD(P)H may be a common factor in both responses. Low tBOOH concentrations inhibited pyruvate dehydrogenase flux while higher concentrations enhanced pyruvate dehydrogenase flux and activation. The results are discussed in relation to currently proposed theories of reactive oxygen-induced respiratory inhibition, Ca2+ efflux, and reperfusion injury."
https://openalex.org/W1953923361,"Lipid A, the toxic principle of endotoxic lipopolysaccharide, and its precursor, Lipid X, interact with human platelets and modulate protein kinase C therein (Grabarek, J., Timmons, S., and Hawiger, J. (1988) J. Clin. Invest. 82, 964-971). We have now purified protein kinase C from human platelets and studied its interaction with endotoxic Lipids A and X. Protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of histone III-S was increased 15 times in the presence of Lipid A and 300 microM Ca2+. The Ca2+ requirement for such activation was lower when 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or 1,2-diolein were added. Lipid A also induced autophosphorylation of protein kinase C, and its activation was enhanced by phosphatidylserine without reducing the Ca2+ requirement. Kinetic analysis of protein kinase C activation induced by Lipid A, in regard to ATP as a substrate, demonstrated that Lipid A increased the rate of the reaction (Vmax) without modifying the affinity of the enzyme (Km) for the substrate. Lipid X inhibited the activation of the enzyme induced by Lipid A. Lipid X also inhibited protein kinase C activation by phosphatidylserine, 1,2-diolein, and PMA. However, 10 times more of Lipid X was required for 50% inhibition (IC50) when PMA was used as an activator of protein kinase C in the presence of phosphatidylserine than when Lipid A and 1,2-diolein were used. These results support the hypothesis that endotoxic Lipid A and Lipid X exert their biological effect in platelets through direct interactions with protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1606465746,"We have investigated the biogenesis and processing of the rat hepatic System A amino acid carrier following induction of its de novo synthesis by the combined action of glucagon and dexamethasone. Golgi subfractions isolated from hormone-treated rat liver form transport competent vesicles and possess characteristic System A activity based on pH sensitivity and 2-(methylamino)isobutyric acid inhibition of Na(+)-dependent 2-aminoisobutyric acid uptake. We have monitored the time course for appearance of the newly synthesized carrier in the Golgi and plasma membrane fractions after the administration of hormones. Our data suggest that it may also be possible to detect processing intermediates of the System A carrier in the Golgi. Perfusion of whole rat liver with 5 mM N-ethylmaleimide followed by isolation of Golgi subfractions and plasma membrane revealed a differential sensitivity such that the plasma membrane or trans Golgi activities were inactivated to a much greater extent than those of the cis or medial Golgi. In vitro N-ethylmaleimide treatment of membrane fractions isolated from an intact rat results in an inactivation of the trans Golgi and plasma membrane System A carrier protein, whereas the cis and medial Golgi fractions retained their transport activity."
https://openalex.org/W1679304285,"It has been previously shown that complexation of Cu2+ is essential for effective uptake of Cu2+ by brain tissues and that 67Cu complexed to His is taken up by a high affinity and a low affinity saturable process (Hartter, D. E., and Barnea, A. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 799-805). Using rat hypothalamic tissue slices, we defined the ligand specificity for these two uptake processes. The effectiveness of stereoisomers or methyl (Me) derivatives of His in facilitating 67Cu uptake by the high affinity process was in this decreasing order: L-His = D-His = Me-3-N-His greater than Me-ester-His greater than Me-alpha-N-His greater than or equal to Me-1-N-His. By the low affinity process it was: L-His = D-His = Me-3-N-His = Me-ester-His = Me-alpha-N-His greater than Me-1-N-His. When facilitation of 67Cu uptake by 14 different amino acids was evaluated using copper:ligand (Cu:L) ratios of 1:2,000 (high affinity process) or 1:2 (low affinity process), His stood out as the most effective. However, when [Cu2+] was 0.1 microM and the Cu:L ratio was increased from 1:2,000 to 1:20,000, Ala, Gly, Lys, Ser, or Thr was each as effective as His; when [Cu2+] was 10 microM and the Cu:L ratio was increased from 1:2 to 1:2,000, Gln, Glu, Gly, Lys, or Ser was each superior to His in facilitating 67Cu uptake. Moreover, by comparison to 67Cu uptake at a Cu:L ratio of 1:2, increasing the ratio attenuated (His) or enhanced (Gln, Glu, Gly, Lys, Ser) 67Cu uptake. These results indicate that 1) coordination of Cu2+ with the 1-N-imidazole and the alpha-amino (but not with the carboxyl) is essential for His facilitation of 67Cu uptake, and 2) the amino acid specificity for uptake of complexed Cu2+ is a function of both [Cu2+] and the molar ratio of copper to amino acid. These results are consistent with coordination of Cu2+ with at least three nitrogens being a primary factor facilitating copper uptake by brain tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1524062932,"The intestinal Na+/glucose cotransporter was isolated from brush border membrane vesicles using a three-step procedure and Na(+)-dependent phlorizin binding as the measure of cotransporter enrichment. The initial step was to treat the Ca2(+)-precipitated brush border membrane vesicles with 0.02% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) followed by sucrose gradient centrifugation which resulted in a 5-fold enrichment of the Na+/glucose cotransporter. The second step was chromatofocusing chromatography over the pH range from pH 7.4 to pH 4.0. This step resulted in an additional 20-fold purification as compared with the SDS-brush border membrane vesicle protein which served as the starting material. The final step was affinity chromatography on con A-Sepharose which resulted in a 5-fold enrichment of the chromatofocused protein. The glycoprotein fraction from the concanavalin A column reconstituted into phosphatidyl choline: cholesterol liposomes demonstrated Na(+)-dependent, phlorizin-sensitive, and osmotic strength-sensitive glucose uptake. This fraction consisted of a single 75-kDa polypeptide on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis upon staining with silver. On the basis of these criteria it appears that a protocol for the isolation of the Na+/glucose cotransporter has been developed."

https://openalex.org/W1524113912,"The binding of Ca2+(4).calmodulin (CaM) to rabbit skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) is required for expression of the enzyme's activity. While both MLCK and CaM were stable at 30 degrees C, their complex was not. The binding of CaM to MLCK resulted in a time- and temperature-dependent inactivation that reflected an intrinsic instability of the complex. Separation of the components of the inactive complex yielded functional CaM, but catalytically inert MLCK, indicating that the site of the inactivating event was confined to MLCK. The behavior of proteolytic fragments further localized this event to the C-terminal 60% of the 603-residue protein. Changes in the tryptophan fluorescence and proteolytic susceptibility of MLCK-CaM indicated that a conformational change accompanied, and thus may have caused, inactivation. Substrates protected against inactivation, as did millimolar concentrations of Mg2+, Mn2+, and Ca2+. These metals appeared to bind to a site on MLCK distinct from that which recognized Mg2+.ATP. A proteolytic fragment of MLCK lacking the ability to bind CaM, C beta 35 (residues 255-584; Edelman, A. M., Takio, K., Blumenthal, D. K., Hansen, R. S., Walsh, K. A., Titani, K., and Krebs, E. G.

K., Hansen, R. S., Walsh, K. A., Titani, K., and Krebs, E. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 11275-11285), was unstable only when CaM was bound."
https://openalex.org/W1533778239,"Collagenase digests of adipose tissue of the 3 to 4-month-old rat contain groups of 20-100 tightly arranged cells (islets) that copurify with the free-floating fat cells. When cultured along with mature adipocytes the islets give rise to cells, initially fibroblast-like, which rapidly proliferate, acquire lipid droplets, and differentiate into small adipocytes within 4-6 days without the addition to the medium of the agents usually required to produce differentiation in stromal-vascular preadipocytes. Differentiation of these cells is independent of confluence and begins as early as day 2 of culture. The proportion of islet-derived cells that differentiate is directly correlated with the number of mature adipocytes simultaneously present in the culture (r = .709; P < 0.001). Culture medium exposed to mature adipocytes demonstrated differentiation-promoting activity, suggesting a paracrine effect of these cells. Islets may in vivo constitute a source for newly formed adipocytes in the adult rat. The differentiation of these potential adipocytes may be regulated, at least in part, by the mature fat cells via a paracrine effect.—Carraro, R.; Lu, Z.; Li, Z.-H.; Johnson, J.

https://openalex.org/W1518075253,"Dampened oscillations of microtubule assembly can accompany polymerization at high tubulin subunit concentrations. This presumably results from a synchronization of dynamic instability behavior, which generates a large population of rapidly disassembling microtubules, that liberate tubulin-GDP oligomers. Subunits in oligomers cannot assemble until they dissociate, to allow GDP-GTP exchange. To determine whether rapidly disassembling microtubules generate oligomers directly, we measured the rate of dilution-induced disassembly of tubulin-GDP microtubules and the rate of dissociation of GDP from the so-formed tubulin-GDP subunits. The rate of GDP dissociation from liberated subunits was found to correspond to that of tubulin-GDP subunits (t1/2 = 5 s), rather than tubulin-GDP oligomers. This indicates that tubulin-GDP subunits are released from microtubules undergoing rapid disassembly. Oligomers apparently form in a side reaction from the high concentration of tubulin-GDP subunits liberated from the synchronously disassembling microtubule population. The rate of subunit dissociation is 0.11 s-1 with oligomers formed by concentrating tubulin-GDP subunits and 0.045 s-1 with oligomers formed by cold-induced microtubule disassembly. This difference provides evidence that the conformation of tubulin-GDP subunits released from rapidly disassembling microtubules differs from tubulin-GDP subunits that were not recently in the microtubule lattice."
https://openalex.org/W1620492393,"We carried out the flash photolysis of oxy complexes of sperm whale myoglobin, cobalt-substituted sperm whale myoglobin, and Aplysia myoglobin. When the optical absorption spectral changes associated with the O2 rebinding were monitored on the nanosecond to millisecond time scale, we found that the transient spectra of the O2 photoproduct of sperm whale myoglobin were significantly different from the static spectra of deoxy form. This was sharply contrasted with the observations that the spectra of the CO photoproduct of sperm whale myoglobin and of the O2 photoproducts of cobalt-substituted sperm whale myoglobin and Aplysia myoglobin are identical to the corresponding spectra of their deoxy forms. These results led us to suggest the presence of a fairly stable transient species in the O2 photodissociation from the oxy complex of sperm whale myoglobin, which has a protein structure different from the deoxy form. We denoted the O2 photo-product to be Mb*. In the time-resolved resonance Raman measurements, the nu Fe-His mode of Mb* gave the same value as that of the deoxy form, indicating that the difference in the optical absorption spectra is possibly due to the structural difference at the heme distal side rather than those of the proximal side. The structure of Mb* is discussed in relation to the dynamic motion of myoglobin in the O2 entry to or exit from the heme pocket. Comparing the structural characteristics of several myoglobins employed, we suggested that the formation of Mb* relates to the following two factors: a hydrogen bonding of O2 with the distal histidine, and the movement of iron upon the ligation of O2."
https://openalex.org/W1579716295,"Conformations of the Na+/glucose cotransporter were examined using tryptophan fluorescence and substrates to induce cotransporter conformational changes. Addition of Na+ but not K+ or TMA+ resulted in a saturable quenching of tryptophan fluorescence with a K0.5 for Na+ of 28 mM. In the presence of saturating Na+ concentrations, d-glucose but not l-glucose, fructose, or phlorizin resulted in a partial return of tryptophan fluorescence to approximately 70% of the substrate-free levels. This return of tryptophan fluorescence was a saturable function of d-glucose concentration with a K0.5 of 43 microM. The three conformations were compared with respect to their sensitivity to tryptophan quench reagents. Acrylamide quenching was unaffected by substrates. In contrast, I- quenching decreased 40% in the presence of Na+, while Cs+ quenching increased 64%. Addition of saturating d-glucose concentrations resulted in the return of I- quenching to 90% of the substrate-free values and reduced Cs+ quenching to substrate-free levels. In contrast, phlorizin did not mimic the effect of d-glucose on tryptophan fluorescence. These results are interpreted in terms of a second substrate-induced cotransporter conformational change which based on similar substrate specificities appears directly related to cotransporter-mediated Na+ and d-glucose transport."
https://openalex.org/W1496136187,"The addition of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) to many types of cells causes a rapid decrease in high affinity binding of 125I-epidermal growth factor (EGF), a process which has been termed transmodulation. Treatment with the tumor promoter, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) also results in the transmodulation of the EGF receptor in many cell types. PDGF can transmodulate EGF binding through a mechanism that is not dependent on protein kinase C activity. A recent report (Wattenberg, E. V., McNeil, P. L., Fujiki, H., and Rosner, M. R. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 213-219) described the requirement for a sodium ion influx in the down-modulation of the EGF receptor stimulated by a non-TPA-type tumor promoter, palytoxin, in Swiss 3T3 cells. We tested for a similar sodium requirement in Balb/c/3T3 and Swiss 3T3 cells stimulated by PDGF or TPA in Balb cells treated with TPA for prolonged periods to down-regulate protein kinase C activity. Our results clearly show that the PDGF- and TPA-stimulated transmodulation of the EGF receptor does not require external sodium nor is the process affected by amiloride. In each of these experiments, the loss of 125I-EGF binding occurred to a similar extent and at a similar rate in the presence or absence of sodium. Intracellular pH also did not appear to have a role in the response. The sodium ionophore, monensin, was previously shown to bring about the down-modulation of 125I-EGF binding in Swiss cells. However, our results indicate that monensin-induced transmodulation of the EGF receptor occurs with or without external sodium, suggesting that the loss of binding is not the result of a sodium ion influx. These findings demonstrate that an increase in intracellular sodium does not cause nor is it required for PDGF- or TPA-stimulated EGF receptor transmodulation."
