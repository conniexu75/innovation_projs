https://openalex.org/W3105176929,"The recent discovery of correlated insulator states and superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene has paved the way to the experimental investigation of electronic correlations in tunable flat band systems realized in twisted van der Waals heterostructures. This novel twist angle degree of freedom and control should be generalizable to other 2D systems, which may exhibit similar correlated physics behavior while at the same time enabling new techniques to tune and control the strength of electron-electron interactions. Here, we report on a new highly tunable correlated system based on small-angle twisted bilayer-bilayer graphene (TBBG), consisting of two rotated sheets of Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene. We find that TBBG exhibits a rich phase diagram, with tunable correlated insulators states that are highly sensitive to both twist angle and to the application of an electric displacement field, the latter reflecting the inherent polarizability of Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene. We find correlated insulator states that can be switched on and off by the displacement field at all integer electron fillings of the moir\'{e} unit cell. The response of these correlated states to magnetic fields points towards evidence of electrically switchable magnetism. Moreover, the strong dependence of the resistance at low temperature and near the correlated insulator states indicates possible proximity to a superconducting phase. Furthermore, in the regime of lower twist angles, TBBG shows multiple sets of flat bands near charge neutrality, resulting in numerous correlated states corresponding to half-filling of each of these flat bands. Our results pave the way to the exploration of novel twist-angle and electric-field controlled correlated phases of matter in novel multi-flat band twisted superlattices."
https://openalex.org/W3025654839,"Distrust in scientific expertise1–14 is dangerous. Opposition to vaccination with a future vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causal agent of COVID-19, for example, could amplify outbreaks2–4, as happened for measles in 20195,6. Homemade remedies7,8 and falsehoods are being shared widely on the Internet, as well as dismissals of expert advice9–11. There is a lack of understanding about how this distrust evolves at the system level13,14. Here we provide a map of the contention surrounding vaccines that has emerged from the global pool of around three billion Facebook users. Its core reveals a multi-sided landscape of unprecedented intricacy that involves nearly 100 million individuals partitioned into highly dynamic, interconnected clusters across cities, countries, continents and languages. Although smaller in overall size, anti-vaccination clusters manage to become highly entangled with undecided clusters in the main online network, whereas pro-vaccination clusters are more peripheral. Our theoretical framework reproduces the recent explosive growth in anti-vaccination views, and predicts that these views will dominate in a decade. Insights provided by this framework can inform new policies and approaches to interrupt this shift to negative views. Our results challenge the conventional thinking about undecided individuals in issues of contention surrounding health, shed light on other issues of contention such as climate change11, and highlight the key role of network cluster dynamics in multi-species ecologies15. Insights into the interactions between pro- and anti-vaccination clusters on Facebook can enable policies and approaches that attempt to interrupt the shift to anti-vaccination views and persuade undecided individuals to adopt a pro-vaccination stance."

Immunotherapies have changed the landscape of cancer treatment by producing durable and long-lasting responses through triggering anti-tumor cell-mediated immunity. In particular, checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) targeting the immune inhibitory molecules CTLA-4 and PD-1 in T lymphocytes have been approved based on responses and improved overall survival in multiple malignancies, particularly those with a high mutational burden (Hodi et al., 2010Hodi F.S.

However, in specific malignancies, such as transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder, CPIs as monotherapies are efficacious in only ∼20% of patients (Powles et al., 2014Powles T. Eder J.P. Fine G.D. Braiteh F.S. Loriot Y. Cruz C. Bellmunt J. Burris H.A. Petrylak D.P.

This could be partly due to the heterogeneity of tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs) and their differential ability to confer a therapeutic benefit upon treatment. Currently, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells are the main focus of efforts to understand how immunotherapy elicits anti-tumor immunity. In melanoma, expression and chromatin state signatures of cytotoxicity and exhaustion (Tirosh et al., 2016Tirosh I. Izar B. Prakadan S.M. Wadsworth 2nd, M.H. Treacy D. Trombetta J.J. Rotem A.

Ciobanu V. et al.PD-1 blockade induces responses by inhibiting adaptive immune resistance.Nature. 2014; 515: 568-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (4365) Google Scholar) are significantly correlated with subsequent responses to PD-1-directed therapy. However, in metastatic bladder TCC, where response rates to PD-1 blockade are ∼15%–20% in platinum chemotherapy-refractory patients and more than 20% in frontline platinum-ineligible patients, predictive biomarkers of response are unclear, including PD-L1 expression (Koshkin and Grivas, 2018Koshkin V.S. Grivas P. Emerging Role of Immunotherapy in Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma.Curr. Oncol. Rep. 2018; 20: 48Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Recently, bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of the pre-treatment tumor microenvironment in TCC found that a higher score of CD8+ gene signature and tumor mutational burden and, conversely, a lower score of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) gene signature, particularly in immune-excluded tumors, were associated with response to the anti-PD-L1 agent atezolizumab (Mariathasan et al., 2018Mariathasan S. Turley S.J. Nickles D. Castiglioni A. Yuen K. Wang Y. Kadel III, E.E. Koeppen H. Astarita J.L. Cubas R. et al.TGFβ attenuates tumour response to PD-L1 blockade by contributing to exclusion of T cells.Nature. 2018; 554: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2183) Google Scholar). However, the importance of heterogeneous subsets of TILs in TCC beyond canonical CD8+ cytotoxic and exhausted phenotypes in response to PD-1 blockade remains unexplored. In particular, the role of CD4+ T cells in controlling or enhancing TCC tumor growth remains largely unknown. Although regulatory CD4+ T cells (Tregs) in the TCC environment have been associated with adverse outcomes (Baras et al., 2016Baras A.S. Drake C. Liu J.J. Gandhi N. Kates M. Hoque M.O. Meeker A. Hahn N. Taube J.M. Schoenberg M.P. et al.The ratio of CD8 to Treg tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes is associated with response to cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.OncoImmunology. 2016; 5: e1134412Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and a CD4+ subset expressing the inducible costimulator (ICOS) that produces interferon-gamma (IFNγ) in response to anti-CTLA-4 therapy has been described in human bladder tumors (Liakou et al., 2008Liakou C.I. Kamat A. Tang D.N. Chen H. Sun J. Troncoso P. Logothetis C. Sharma P. CTLA-4 blockade increases IFNgamma-producing CD4+ICOShi cells to shift the ratio of effector to regulatory T cells in cancer patients.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 14987-14992Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), the presence of other CD4+ T cell subsets that directly promote cell-mediated immunity through other effector mechanisms remains unclear. Detailed characterization of the T lymphocytes in the tumor is critically needed for precisely mapping the cells responsible for tumor recognition and control and defining predictive markers of response to CPI in bladder cancer. To address these points, we interrogated the tumor microenvironment of patients with localized muscle-invasive bladder TCC who received or did not receive neoadjuvant anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy (atezolizumab, Genentech) prior to surgical resection. Droplet single-cell RNA-seq (dscRNA-seq) and paired T cell receptor sequencing (TCR-seq) of more than 30,000 CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from paired tumors and adjacent non-malignant tissues revealed heterogeneity in known CD4+ states, such as regulatory T cells, which were also enriched and clonally expanded in tumors. In addition, several states of cytotoxic CD4+ T cells expressing cytolytic effector proteins were identified, some of which are enriched in tumors. Cytotoxic CD4+ T cells were clonally expanded in tumors and could kill autologous tumors ex vivo. Cytotoxic CD4+ T cells existed in discrete proliferating and non-proliferating states in tumors. A gene signature of cytotoxic CD4+ T cells was predictive of a response to PD-1 blockade in an orthogonal RNA-seq dataset of metastatic bladder cancer patients treated with anti-PD-L1. Overall, these findings highlight the importance of CD4+ T cell heterogeneity and the relative balance between activation of cytotoxic CD4+ effectors and inhibitory regulatory cells for killing autologous tumors. To assess the T cell composition of the tumor environment, we profiled T cells from dissociated bladder tumors and adjacent uninvolved bladder tissues using single-cell RNA and TCR sequencing (see schematic in Figure S1A). We used the 10X Genomics Chromium platform (Zheng et al., 2017bZheng G.X. Terry J.M. Belgrader P. Ryvkin P. Bent Z.W. Wilson R. Ziraldo S.B. Wheeler T.D. McDermott G.P. Zhu J. et al.Massively parallel digital transcriptional profiling of single cells.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 14049Crossref PubMed Scopus (2300) Google Scholar) to sequence 8,833 tumor-derived and 1,929 non-malignant tissue-derived CD8+ T cells from 7 patients (Table S1). All samples were muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) from 2 standard-of-care-untreated patients (“untreated”), 1 chemotherapy-treated patient (gemcitabine + carboplatin, “chemo”), and 4 anti-PD-L1-treated patients (“anti-PD-L1”) with detailed clinical annotations (Table S1). To assess the shared heterogeneity of T cells across samples, we restricted the analysis to highly variable genes and used an empirical Bayes approach (ComBat; Johnson et al., 2007Johnson W.E. Li C. Rabinovic A. Adjusting batch effects in microarray expression data using empirical Bayes methods.Biostatistics. 2007; 8: 118-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar, Büttner et al., 2019Büttner M. Miao Z.

Methods. 2019; 16: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) to account for preparation batch among individual samples. We subsequently used Leiden clustering (Traag et al., 2019Traag V.A. Waltman L. van Eck N.J. From Louvain to Leiden: guaranteeing well-connected communities.Sci. Rep. 2019; 9: 5233Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar) to define clusters that were visualized using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) (McInnes and Healy, 2018McInnes L. Healy J. UMAP: Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction.arXiv. 2018; (arXiv: 1802.03426)https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03426Google Scholar). Tumor- and non-malignant-derived CD8+ T cells form 11 clusters, each populated by cells from all samples suggestive of shared states in TCC regardless of the treatment regimen (Figure 1A; Figure S2A). Differential expression analyses comparing each cluster with all other cells combined identified 1,067 differentially expressed genes in at least one cluster (adjusted P value (Padj) < 0.05, |log2(fold change, FC)| > 0.5) (Table S2). The identified states include known CD8+ subtypes (Figures 1B and 1C): cells expressing HAVCR2 (TIM-3), LAG3, ENTPD1, as well as the chemokine CXCL13 (CD8ENTPD1: log2(FC) = 1.4–3.7), described previously as tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells (Duhen et al., 2018Duhen T.

Commun. 2018; 9: 2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar); effector cells expressing FGFBP2 and GNLY, a granule-associated pore-forming protein known to function in pathogen killing (Krensky and Clayberger, 2009Krensky A.M. Clayberger C. Biology and clinical relevance of granulysin.Tissue Antigens. 2009; 73: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) (CD8FGFBP2: log2(FC) = 3.6–5.3); naive cells expressing CCR7 and GZMK (CD8NAIVE: log2(FC) = 0.9–2.8); central memory cells expressing CCR7 and SELL (L-selectin) (CD8CM: log2(FC) = 1.5–1.7); and mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells expressing KLRB1 (CD8MAIT: log2(FC) = 2.7) that preferentially use the known semi-invariant TCR α chains TRAV1-2 and/or TRAJ33 (Kurioka et al., 2016Kurioka A. Walker L.J. Klenerman P. Willberg C.B. MAIT cells: new guardians of the liver.Clin. Transl. Immunology. 2016; 5: e98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Figure 1D). Of note, we also found MKI67+ proliferating cells (CD8PROLIF: log2(FC) = 6.5) as well as cells expressing the chemokines XCL1/2 (CD8xcl: log2(FC) = 5.2–5.6). Similar states were also identified in the tumor environment of hepatocellular carcinoma based on scRNA-seq (Zheng et al., 2017aZheng C. Zheng L. Yoo J.K. Guo H. Zhang Y. Guo X. Kang B. Hu R.

Populations were arranged based on hierarchical clustering using Euclidean distance metric. Given the lack of tumor enrichment of CD8+ states and the higher frequency of CD4+ over CD8+ T cells in bladder tumors (Figure S1B), we investigated CD4+ T cell heterogeneity in a similar fashion to determine their contribution to anti-tumor responses. We sequenced and analyzed 16,995 tumor- and 2,847 non-malignant tissue-infiltrating CD4+ T cells isolated from the same patients. Tumor-derived and non-malignant tissue-derived CD4+ T cells formed 11 clusters each with representation from all individual patients (Figure 2A; Figure S2B). We identified 1,511 differentially expressed genes in at least one cluster (Padj < 0.05, |log2(FC)| > 0.5; Table S2; Figures 2B and 2C) defining several canonical CD4+ T cell states. These include CCR7+ cells, which demonstrated a central memory phenotype (CD4CM) based on parallel flow cytometry data showing that these were CD45RA− (see below) as well as cells expressing high levels of CXCL13 and IFNG (CD4CXCL13: log2(FC) = 5.9 and 1.4), which were also likely to be exhausted based on overexpression of TOX (log2(FC) = 1.9) (Yao et al., 2019Yao C.

Other states included Th17 cells expressing IL17A (CD4TH17: log2(FC) = 4.7), which represented important anti-tumor effectors (Kryczek et al., 2011Kryczek I. Zhao E. Liu Y. Wang Y. Vatan L.

CD4CXCL13 demonstrated significant enrichment in tumor compared with non-malignant tissue (tumor versus non-malignant: 6.5% versus 3.0%, p = 0.015, exact permutation test), whereas states enriched in non-malignant tissue included CD4CM (tumor versus non-malignant: 30% versus 42%, p = 0.008) and CD4ACTIVATED (tumor versus non-malignant: 7.5% versus 10%, p = 0.02) (density plots in Figure 2D; tumor and non-malignant frequencies in Figure 2E).

With the exception of TIGIT, these immune checkpoints are minimally expressed by other CD4+ states, such as CD4CM (Figure 3A). The two Treg states were distinguished by higher expression of IL2RA, TNFRSF4, TNFRSF9, and TNFRSF18 in CD4IL2RAHI cells (CD4IL2RAHI: log2(FC) = 2.5–3.6; CD4IL2RALO: log2(FC) = 0.4–1.6; Figure 3A; Table S2). Of note, both Treg states were significantly enriched in tumor compared with adjacent non-malignant tissue (CD4IL2RAHI: 14.3% versus 4.6%, p = 0.002; CD4IL2RALO: 11.1% versus 6.7%, p = 0.002; exact permutation test; Figure 2E). We confirmed, by flow cytometry from 7 additional bladder tumors, that multiple tumors contained distinct regulatory states that expressed graded protein levels of IL2RA and co-expressed significantly different levels of immune checkpoints, such as TNFRSF18 (p < 0.05 for TNFRSF18 expression in FOXP3+ CD25low versus CD25hi populations by Wilcoxon signed-ranked test; Figure 3B; gating strategy in Figures S1C–S1D).

To query the TCR sequence in the same single cells for which we obtained whole-transcriptome data, we PCR-amplified and sequenced to saturation the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of the TCR alpha (TRA) and beta (TRB) loci from the barcoded full-length cDNA library (primers in Table S3). After filtering for matching whitelisted cell barcodes (Cell Ranger), this approach yielded 11,081 CD4+ T cells and 5,779 CD8+ T cells with paired TRA and TRB CDR3 sequences (49% and 47% recovery, respectively; summary in Table S3). These results are consistent with expected frequencies based on the average recovery of individual TRA (CD4+, 54%; CD8+, 50%) and TRB (CD4+, 68%; CD8+, 67%) sequences across whitelisted cells. Overall, the TCR repertoire was more restricted in the tumor microenvironment than in adjacent non-malignant tissue based on two analyses.

In rheumatoid arthritis the synovial tissue undergoes marked hyperplasia, becomes inflamed and invasive, and destroys the joint1,2. It has recently been shown that a subset of fibroblasts in the sublining undergoes a major expansion in rheumatoid arthritis that is linked to disease activity3-5; however, the molecular mechanism by which these fibroblasts differentiate and expand is unknown. Here we identify a critical role for NOTCH3 signalling in the differentiation of perivascular and sublining fibroblasts that express CD90 (encoded by THY1). Using single-cell RNA sequencing and synovial tissue organoids, we found that NOTCH3 signalling drives both transcriptional and spatial gradients-emanating from vascular endothelial cells outwards-in fibroblasts. In active rheumatoid arthritis, NOTCH3 and Notch target genes are markedly upregulated in synovial fibroblasts. In mice, the genetic deletion of Notch3 or the blockade of NOTCH3 signalling attenuates inflammation and prevents joint damage in inflammatory arthritis. Our results indicate that synovial fibroblasts exhibit a positional identity that is regulated by endothelium-derived Notch signalling, and that this stromal crosstalk pathway underlies inflammation and pathology in inflammatory arthritis."

Saintilan et al. investigated the likely effects of this increasing rate of rise on coastal mangrove forest, a tropical ecosystem of key importance for coastal protection (see the Perspective by Lovelock). They reviewed data on mangrove accretion 10,000 to 7000 years before present, when the rate of sea level rise was even higher than today as a result of glacial ice melt. Their analysis suggests an upper threshold of 7 millimeters per year as the maximum rate of sea level rise associated with mangrove vertical development, beyond which the ecosystem fails to keep up with the change. Under projected rates of sea level rise, they predict that a deficit between accretion and sea level rise is likely to commence in the next 30 years. Science , this issue p. 1118 ; see also p. 1050"

Of particular concern, no new antibiotic classes have been approved for treating Gram-negative pathogens in decades. Here, we characterize a compound, SCH-79797, that kills both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria through a unique dual-targeting mechanism of action (MoA) with undetectably low resistance frequencies. To characterize its MoA, we combined quantitative imaging, proteomic, genetic, metabolomic, and cell-based assays. This pipeline demonstrates that SCH-79797 has two independent cellular targets, folate metabolism and bacterial membrane integrity, and outperforms combination treatments in killing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) persisters. Building on the molecular core of SCH-79797, we developed a derivative, Irresistin-16, with increased potency and showed its efficacy against Neisseria gonorrhoeae in a mouse vaginal infection model. This promising antibiotic lead suggests that combining multiple MoAs onto a single chemical scaffold may be an underappreciated approach to targeting challenging bacterial pathogens."

For instance, the autoimmune diseases systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sjögren’s syndrome affect nine times more women than men1, whereas schizophrenia affects men with greater frequency and severity relative to women2. All three illnesses have their strongest common genetic associations in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus, an association that in SLE and Sjögren’s syndrome has long been thought to arise from alleles of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes at that locus3–6. Here we show that variation of the complement component 4 (C4) genes C4A and C4B, which are also at the MHC locus and have been linked to increased risk for schizophrenia7, generates 7-fold variation in risk for SLE and 16-fold variation in risk for Sjögren’s syndrome among individuals with common C4 genotypes, with C4A protecting more strongly than C4B in both illnesses. The same alleles that increase risk for schizophrenia greatly reduce risk for SLE and Sjögren’s syndrome. In all three illnesses, C4 alleles act more strongly in men than in women: common combinations of C4A and C4B generated 14-fold variation in risk for SLE, 31-fold variation in risk for Sjögren’s syndrome, and 1.7-fold variation in schizophrenia risk among men (versus 6-fold, 15-fold and 1.26-fold variation in risk among women, respectively). At a protein level, both C4 and its effector C3 were present at higher levels in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma8,9 in men than in women among adults aged between 20 and 50 years, corresponding to the ages of differential disease vulnerability. Sex differences in complement protein levels may help to explain the more potent effects of C4 alleles in men, women’s greater risk of SLE and Sjögren’s syndrome and men’s greater vulnerability to schizophrenia. These results implicate the complement system as a source of sexual dimorphism in vulnerability to diverse illnesses. Sexual dimorphism in genetic vulnerability to schizophrenia, systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjögren’s syndrome is linked to differential protein abundance from alleles of complement component 4."

https://openalex.org/W3018118540,"Primary immunodeficiency (PID) is characterized by recurrent and often life-threatening infections, autoimmunity and cancer, and it poses major diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Although the most severe forms of PID are identified in early childhood, most patients present in adulthood, typically with no apparent family history and a variable clinical phenotype of widespread immune dysregulation: about 25% of patients have autoimmune disease, allergy is prevalent and up to 10% develop lymphoid malignancies1–3. Consequently, in sporadic (or non-familial) PID genetic diagnosis is difficult and the role of genetics is not well defined. Here we address these challenges by performing whole-genome sequencing in a large PID cohort of 1,318 participants. An analysis of the coding regions of the genome in 886 index cases of PID found that disease-causing mutations in known genes that are implicated in monogenic PID occurred in 10.3% of these patients, and a Bayesian approach (BeviMed4) identified multiple new candidate PID-associated genes, including IVNS1ABP. We also examined the noncoding genome, and found deletions in regulatory regions that contribute to disease causation. In addition, we used a genome-wide association study to identify loci that are associated with PID, and found evidence for the colocalization of—and interplay between—novel high-penetrance monogenic variants and common variants (at the PTPN2 and SOCS1 loci). This begins to explain the contribution of common variants to the variable penetrance and phenotypic complexity that are observed in PID. Thus, using a cohort-based whole-genome-sequencing approach in the diagnosis of PID can increase diagnostic yield and further our understanding of the key pathways that influence immune responsiveness in humans. Whole-genome sequencing analysis of individuals with primary immunodeficiency identifies new candidate disease-associated genes and shows how the interplay between genetic variants can explain the variable penetrance and complexity of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W3022994813,"Regulatory T (Treg) cells are required to control immune responses and maintain homeostasis, but are a significant barrier to antitumour immunity1. Conversely, Treg instability, characterized by loss of the master transcription factor Foxp3 and acquisition of proinflammatory properties2, can promote autoimmunity and/or facilitate more effective tumour immunity3,4. A comprehensive understanding of the pathways that regulate Foxp3 could lead to more effective Treg therapies for autoimmune disease and cancer. The availability of new functional genetic tools has enabled the possibility of systematic dissection of the gene regulatory programs that modulate Foxp3 expression. Here we developed a CRISPR-based pooled screening platform for phenotypes in primary mouse Treg cells and applied this technology to perform a targeted loss-of-function screen of around 500 nuclear factors to identify gene regulatory programs that promote or disrupt Foxp3 expression. We identified several modulators of Foxp3 expression, including ubiquitin-specific peptidase 22 (Usp22) and ring finger protein 20 (Rnf20). Usp22, a member of the deubiquitination module of the SAGA chromatin-modifying complex, was revealed to be a positive regulator that stabilized Foxp3 expression; whereas the screen suggested that Rnf20, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, can serve as a negative regulator of Foxp3. Treg-specific ablation of Usp22 in mice reduced Foxp3 protein levels and caused defects in their suppressive function that led to spontaneous autoimmunity but protected against tumour growth in multiple cancer models. Foxp3 destabilization in Usp22-deficient Treg cells could be rescued by ablation of Rnf20, revealing a reciprocal ubiquitin switch in Treg cells. These results reveal previously unknown modulators of Foxp3 and demonstrate a screening method that can be broadly applied to discover new targets for Treg immunotherapies for cancer and autoimmune disease. A CRISPR-based screening platform was used to identify previously uncharacterized genes that regulate the regulatory T cell-specific master transcription factor Foxp3, indicating that this screening method may be broadly applicable for the discovery of other genes involved in autoimmunity and immune responses to cancer."

Nevertheless, we lack a developmental blueprint that integrates the molecular determinants of neuronal and glial diversity along temporal and spatial scales of hypothalamus development3. Here we combine single-cell RNA sequencing of 51,199 mouse cells of ectodermal origin, gene regulatory network (GRN) screens in conjunction with genome-wide association study-based disease phenotyping, and genetic lineage reconstruction to show that nine glial and thirty-three neuronal subtypes are generated by mid-gestation under the control of distinct GRNs. Combinatorial molecular codes that arise from neurotransmitters, neuropeptides and transcription factors are minimally required to decode the taxonomical hierarchy of hypothalamic neurons. The differentiation of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and dopamine neurons, but not glutamate neurons, relies on quasi-stable intermediate states, with a pool of GABA progenitors giving rise to dopamine cells4. We found an unexpected abundance of chemotropic proliferation and guidance cues that are commonly implicated in dorsal (cortical) patterning5 in the hypothalamus. In particular, loss of SLIT-ROBO signalling impaired both the production and positioning of periventricular dopamine neurons. Overall, we identify molecular principles that shape the developmental architecture of the hypothalamus and show how neuronal heterogeneity is transformed into a multimodal neural unit to provide virtually infinite adaptive potential throughout life."

Gold nanorods capable of detecting infrared light were coupled with an antibody to temperature-sensitive ion channels. When the nanorods absorbed light and converted it into heat, the coupled ion channels were gated by infrared light. In a mouse model of retinal degeneration, these ion channels were successfully targeted to cone photoreceptors, and responses to near infrared light could be detected. In the primary visual cortex, more cells responded to near-infrared stimuli in mice expressing these ion channels than in controls.

The atomic model of the 134-kilodalton CTC1 subunit, built almost entirely de novo, reveals the overall architecture of CST and the DNA-binding anchor site. The carboxyl-terminal domain of STN1 interacts with CTC1 at two separate docking sites, allowing allosteric mediation of CST decamer assembly. Furthermore, ssDNA appears to staple two monomers to nucleate decamer assembly. CTC1 has stronger structural similarity to Replication Protein A than the expected similarity to yeast Cdc13. The decameric structure suggests that CST can organize ssDNA analogously to the nucleosome's organization of double-stranded DNA."

https://openalex.org/W3020675770,"A major factor in the progression to heart failure in humans is the inability of the adult heart to repair itself after injury. We recently demonstrated that the early postnatal mammalian heart is capable of regeneration following injury through proliferation of preexisting cardiomyocytes1,2 and that Meis1, a three amino acid loop extension (TALE) family homeodomain transcription factor, translocates to cardiomyocyte nuclei shortly after birth and mediates postnatal cell cycle arrest3. Here we report that Hoxb13 acts as a cofactor of Meis1 in postnatal cardiomyocytes. Cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of Hoxb13 can extend the postnatal window of cardiomyocyte proliferation and reactivate the cardiomyocyte cell cycle in the adult heart. Moreover, adult Meis1–Hoxb13 double-knockout hearts display widespread cardiomyocyte mitosis, sarcomere disassembly and improved left ventricular systolic function following myocardial infarction, as demonstrated by echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging. Chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing demonstrates that Meis1 and Hoxb13 act cooperatively to regulate cardiomyocyte maturation and cell cycle. Finally, we show that the calcium-activated protein phosphatase calcineurin dephosphorylates Hoxb13 at serine-204, resulting in its nuclear localization and cell cycle arrest. These results demonstrate that Meis1 and Hoxb13 act cooperatively to regulate cardiomyocyte maturation and proliferation and provide mechanistic insights into the link between hyperplastic and hypertrophic growth of cardiomyocytes. Hoxb13 acts as a cofactor of Meis1 in regulating cardiomyocyte maturation and cell cycle, and knockout of both proteins enables regeneration of postnatal cardiac tissue in a mouse model of heart injury."

The BCR repertoires of primary B cells are vast owing to mechanisms that create diversity at the junctions of V(D)J gene segments that contribute to complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3), the region that binds antigen1. Primary B cells undergo antigen-driven BCR affinity maturation through somatic hypermutation and cellular selection in germinal centres (GCs)2,3. Although most GCs are transient3, those in intestinal Peyer’s patches (PPs)—which depend on the gut microbiota—are chronic4, and little is known about their BCR repertoires or patterns of somatic hypermutation. Here, using a high-throughput assay that analyses both V(D)J segment usage and somatic hypermutation profiles, we elucidate physiological BCR repertoires in mouse PP GCs. PP GCs from different mice expand public BCR clonotypes (clonotypes that are shared between many mice) that often have canonical CDR3s in the immunoglobulin heavy chain that, owing to junctional biases during V(D)J recombination, appear much more frequently than predicted in naive B cell repertoires. Some public clonotypes are dependent on the gut microbiota and encode antibodies that are reactive to bacterial glycans, whereas others are independent of gut bacteria. Transfer of faeces from specific-pathogen-free mice to germ-free mice restored germ-dependent clonotypes, directly implicating BCR selection. We identified somatic hypermutations that were recurrently selected in such public clonotypes, indicating that affinity maturation occurs in mouse PP GCs under homeostatic conditions. Thus, persistent gut antigens select recurrent BCR clonotypes to seed chronic PP GC responses. An analysis of the immunoglobulin repertoire of B cells in Peyer’s patch germinal centres in mice provides evidence for the selection of B cell receptor clonotypes by gut antigens and antigen-driven affinity maturation."

https://openalex.org/W3021311501,"TWIK-related acid-sensitive potassium (TASK) channels—members of the two pore domain potassium (K2P) channel family—are found in neurons1, cardiomyocytes2–4 and vascular smooth muscle cells5, where they are involved in the regulation of heart rate6, pulmonary artery tone5,7, sleep/wake cycles8 and responses to volatile anaesthetics8–11. K2P channels regulate the resting membrane potential, providing background K+ currents controlled by numerous physiological stimuli12–15. Unlike other K2P channels, TASK channels are able to bind inhibitors with high affinity, exceptional selectivity and very slow compound washout rates. As such, these channels are attractive drug targets, and TASK-1 inhibitors are currently in clinical trials for obstructive sleep apnoea and atrial fibrillation16. In general, potassium channels have an intramembrane vestibule with a selectivity filter situated above and a gate with four parallel helices located below; however, the K2P channels studied so far all lack a lower gate. Here we present the X-ray crystal structure of TASK-1, and show that it contains a lower gate—which we designate as an ‘X-gate’—created by interaction of the two crossed C-terminal M4 transmembrane helices at the vestibule entrance. This structure is formed by six residues (243VLRFMT248) that are essential for responses to volatile anaesthetics10, neurotransmitters13 and G-protein-coupled receptors13. Mutations within the X-gate and the surrounding regions markedly affect both the channel-open probability and the activation of the channel by anaesthetics. Structures of TASK-1 bound to two high-affinity inhibitors show that both compounds bind below the selectivity filter and are trapped in the vestibule by the X-gate, which explains their exceptionally low washout rates. The presence of the X-gate in TASK channels explains many aspects of their physiological and pharmacological behaviour, which will be beneficial for the future development and optimization of TASK modulators for the treatment of heart, lung and sleep disorders. The X-ray crystal structure of the potassium channel TASK-1 reveals the presence of an X-gate, which traps small-molecule inhibitors in the intramembrane vestibule and explains their low washout rates from the channel."

As concentration rises, a narrow peak at ~2 electron volts, corresponding to vertical photodetachment of localized solvated electrons and dielectrons, transforms continuously into a band with a sharp Fermi edge accompanied by a plasmon peak, characteristic of delocalized metallic electrons.

https://openalex.org/W3025200892,"Genetic variations underlying susceptibility to complex autoimmune and allergic diseases are concentrated within noncoding regulatory elements termed enhancers1. The functions of a large majority of disease-associated enhancers are unknown, in part owing to their distance from the genes they regulate, a lack of understanding of the cell types in which they operate, and our inability to recapitulate the biology of immune diseases in vitro. Here, using shared synteny to guide loss-of-function analysis of homologues of human enhancers in mice, we show that the prominent autoimmune and allergic disease risk locus at chromosome 11q13.52–7 contains a distal enhancer that is functional in CD4+ regulatory T (Treg) cells and required for Treg-mediated suppression of colitis. The enhancer recruits the transcription factors STAT5 and NF-κB to mediate signal-driven expression of Lrrc32, which encodes the protein glycoprotein A repetitions predominant (GARP). Whereas disruption of the Lrrc32 gene results in early lethality, mice lacking the enhancer are viable but lack GARP expression in Foxp3+ Treg cells, which are unable to control colitis in a cell-transfer model of the disease. In human Treg cells, the enhancer forms conformational interactions with the promoter of LRRC32 and enhancer risk variants are associated with reduced histone acetylation and GARP expression. Finally, functional fine-mapping of 11q13.5 using CRISPR-activation (CRISPRa) identifies a CRISPRa-responsive element in the vicinity of risk variant rs11236797 capable of driving GARP expression. These findings provide a mechanistic basis for association of the 11q13.5 risk locus with immune-mediated diseases and identify GARP as a potential target in their therapy. Shared synteny guides loss-of-function analysis of human enhancer homologues in mice, identifying a distal enhancer at the autoimmune and allergic disease risk locus at chromosome 11q13.5 whose function in regulatory T cells provides a mechanistic basis for its role in disease."

Long intergenic noncoding RNA 00511 (LINC00511) has been considered as a target gene of drug resistance. A novel theranostic agent loaded with LINC00511-siRNA to deliver siRNA was structured, and the responses of drug sensitivity in TNBC were detected. Next-generation high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed to accurately analyze the differential expression of mRNAs and lncRNA targets after LINC00511-siRNA transfection with low-frequency ultrasound (LFUS). The LINC00511-siRNA conjugated nanobubble complexes showed appropriate characterization, with a mean diameter of 516.1 ± 24.7 nm and a zeta potential of −38.05 ± 0.24 mV. The transfection efficiency of nanobubble complexes was approximately 50% with LFUS. By RNA-Seq, the differential expressions of lncRNA transcripts and mRNA transcripts were identified, and then analyzed. The GO and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed the TNBC drug resistance related target genes and pathways. The combination of LFUS irradiation and nanobubble complexes is regarded as an efficient and safe method for siRNA transfection. The TNBC drug resistance occurs as a result of synergistic reactions between a variety of genes and a variety of pathways."
https://openalex.org/W3033128359,"Development of oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) breeding lines producing oil characterized by high oleic and low linolenic acid content is an important goal of rapeseed breeding programs worldwide. Such kind of oil is ideal for deep frying and can also be used as a raw material for biodiesel production. By performing chemical mutagenesis using ethyl methanesulfonate, we obtained mutant winter rapeseed breeding lines that can produce oil with a high content of oleic acid (C18:1, more than 75%) and a low content of linolenic acid (C18:3, less than 3%). However, the mutant lines revealed low agricultural value as they were characterized by low seed yield, low wintering, and high content of glucosinolates in seed meal. The aim of this work was to improve the mutant lines and develop high-oleic and low-linolenic recombinants exhibiting both good oil quality and high agronomic value. The plant materials used in this study included high-oleic and low-linolenic mutant breeding lines and high-yielding domestic canola-type breeding lines of good agricultural value with high oleic acid content and extremely low glucosinolates content. Field trials were conducted in four environments, in a randomized complete block design. Phenotyping was performed for wintering, yield of seed and oil, and seed quality traits. Genotype × environment interaction was investigated with respect to the content of C18:1 and C18:3 acids in seed oil. Genotyping was done for the selection of homozygous high oleic and low linolenic lines using allele-specific CAPS markers and SNaPshot assay, respectively. Finally, new high oleic and low linolenic winter rapeseed recombinant lines were obtained for use as a starting material for the development of new varieties that may be of high value on the oil crop market."

Qian et al. developed a system in which DNA barcodes are encapsulated inside nongerminating microbial spores and can be dispersed on objects or in the environment (see the Perspective by Nivala). These barcoded spores provide a durable, specific marker that can be read out quickly with simple equipment. When applied to soil, the spores can be transferred to and from objects around them, enabling tracking at meter-scale resolution. On plant leaves, the spores are not readily transferred, and the authors demonstrate a potential use for tracking agricultural products. Science , this issue p. 1135 ; see also p. 1058"
https://openalex.org/W3034126401,"Chronic neuropathic pain (NP) is a growing clinical problem for which effective treatments, aside from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids, are lacking. Cannabinoids are emerging as potentially promising agents to manage neuroimmune effects associated with nociception. In particular, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD), and their combination are being considered as therapeutic alternatives for treatment of NP. This study aimed to examine whether sex affects long-term outcomes on persistent mechanical hypersensitivity 7 weeks after ceasing cannabinoid administration. Clinically relevant low doses of THC, CBD, and a 1:1 combination of THC:CBD extracts, in medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil, were orally gavaged for 14 consecutive days to age-matched groups of male and female sexually mature Sprague Dawley rats. Treatments commenced one day after surgically inducing a pro-nociceptive state using a peripheral sciatic nerve cuff. The analgesic efficacy of each phytocannabinoid was assessed relative to MCT oil using hind paw mechanical behavioural testing once a week for 9 weeks. In vivo intracellular electrophysiology was recorded at endpoint to characterize soma threshold changes in primary afferent sensory neurons within dorsal root ganglia (DRG) innervated by the affected sciatic nerve. The thymus, spleen, and DRG were collected post-sacrifice and analyzed for long-term effects on markers associated with T lymphocytes at the RNA level using qPCR. Administration of cannabinoids, particularly the 1:1 combination of THC, elicited a sustained mechanical anti-hypersensitive effect in males with persistent peripheral NP, which corresponded to beneficial changes in myelinated Aβ mechanoreceptive fibers. Specific immune cell markers associated with T cell differentiation and pro-inflammatory cytokines, previously implicated in repair processes, were differentially up-regulated by cannabinoids in males treated with cannabinoids, but not in females, warranting further investigation into sexual dimorphisms that may underlie treatment outcomes."

Adherence of bacteria to host matrix components is the initial critical event in the pathogenesis of most infections. The extracellular matrix (ECM) essentially consists of macromolecules, such as collagens, proteoglycans, and glycoproteins, that serve as a substrate for the adhesion and migration of tissue cells. These processes involve integrins, a family of heterodimeric cell surface receptors that recognize specific ECM proteins (2Hynes R.O. Naba A.

The NEAT domains adopt a beta sandwich fold that consists of two five-stranded antiparallel beta sheets (39Pilpa R.M. Fadeev E.A. Villareal V.A. Wong M.L. Phillips M. Clubb R.T.

IsdH plays a role in the evasion of phagocytosis as a result of accelerated degradation of C3b (47Visai L. Yanagisawa N. Josefsson E. Tarkowski A. Pezzali I. Rooijakkers S.H.M. Foster T.J. Speziale P.

IsdB binds to platelets via direct interaction with the platelet integrin GPIIb/IIIa and also promotes S. aureus adherence to and internalization by nonphagocytic human cells (48Zapotoczna M.

Iron-regulated surface determinant B (IsdB) promotes Staphylococcus aureus adherence to and internalization by non-phagocytic human cells.Cell Microbiol. 2013; 15 (23279065): 1026-104110.1111/cmi.12097Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The objective of the current study was to investigate in more detail the binding of Vn to S. aureus cells. We show that cells expressing IsdB specifically bind to Vn and analyze the nature and the biological consequences of this interaction. In preliminary experiments, we tested the capture of Vn by S. aureus strain SH1000 grown to stationary phase in rich brain heart infusion (BHI) or iron-restricted Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 (RPMI) medium with or without FeCl3. Bacteria grown in RPMI showed a higher ability to capture Vn than those grown in iron-rich medium or in RPMI supplemented with FeCl3, suggesting that binding of strain SH1000 depends on proteins induced by iron starvation. Interestingly, a protein A-deficient (spa) mutant showed a Vn-binding profile overlapping that of the WT strain, suggesting that Vn binding to the bacterial surface is not related to protein A expression (Fig. 1, A and B). To further analyze the interaction of Vn with S. aureus, SH1000 spa organisms grown in BHI and RPMI medium were immobilized onto microtiter wells and allowed to interact with increasing amounts of soluble Vn (Fig. 1C). Under both conditions, Vn bound to bacteria in a dose-dependent and saturable fashion. RPMI-grown bacteria captured significantly larger amounts of Vn, suggesting that S. aureus cells express a larger number of receptors on their surface or that novel receptors were induced when grown in iron starvation. To compare the Vn binding potential of different S. aureus strains, spa mutants of the S. aureus laboratory strains Newman, SH1000, and 8325-4 and the clinical strain USA300 grown in BHI or RPMI medium to the stationary phase were immobilized in microtiter wells and tested for binding to soluble Vn. All the strains grown in RPMI medium showed a higher ability to bind Vn when grown under iron starvation conditions than in iron-rich medium (Fig. 1D). To identify the surface component(s) involved in Vn binding, SH1000 spa cells grown in BHI or RPMI medium were digested with lysostaphin and the released material subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and far Western blotting. The nitrocellulose membrane was incubated with Vn, and the bound ligand was detected with anti-Vn IgG. A strong signal corresponding to a molecule of 75 kDa was noted in protein from cells grown in RPMI medium, whereas no significant signal was detected in material released from cells grown in BHI medium (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). To further investigate this issue, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and visualized by staining with Coomassie brilliant blue (Fig. 2, lane 3). A candidate protein of 75 kDa was excised from the stained gel, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by MS. The database search unequivocally identified IsdB as the potential Vn-binding protein of S. aureus SH1000 (Fig. S2A). Since S. aureus SH1000 spa cells grown to stationary phase in BHI medium bound Vn significantly less than when grown in RPMI medium (Fig. 1), we analyzed the expression of the isdB gene in cells grown both in BHI or RPMI medium to mid-exponential and stationary phases of growth by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Expression of isdB in cells grown to stationary phase in RPMI medium was about 5-fold higher than that in cells grown in BHI medium or cells grown to mid-exponential phase in either medium (Fig. S2B). This finding was validated by comparing the expression levels of the IsdB protein by bacteria grown to mid-exponential and stationary phases in BHI and RPMI media by Western immunoblotting. While IsdB was virtually undetectable in material released from bacteria grown to both the mid-exponential and stationary phases in BHI medium, the protein was abundant in material released from bacteria grown to the stationary phase in RPMI medium (Fig. S2C). To study IsdB in isolation from other S. aureus CWA proteins, a strain of L. lactis expressing IsdB from a gene cloned into the plasmid vector pNZ8037 was used. To validate the expression of IsdB from the bacterium, L. lactis pNZ8037::isdB and the isogenic strain carrying the empty vector were treated with mutanolysin and lysozyme, and the released material subjected to far Western blotting. A Vn binding protein of 75 kDa was detected (along with an approximately 60-kDa protein, which may be a breakdown product), whereas the material released from L. lactis (pNZ8037) lacked reactivity (Fig. 3A). Moreover, the lactococci were immobilized onto microtiter wells, and binding of soluble Vn was examined by ELISA. Significantly higher binding of Vn to L. lactis (pNZ8037::isdB) was observed compared to that of L. lactis harboring the empty vector (Fig. 3B). To investigate the specificity of Vn binding to IsdB, recombinant IsdB NEAT1-NEAT2 protein was immobilized onto microtiter wells and tested for binding to extracellular matrix proteins, including fibrinogen, fibronectin, collagen, and Vn. Only Vn bound to the surface-coated IsdB, whereas no binding of the other proteins was observed (Fig. 4A). To localize the Vn-binding region within the IsdB protein, the NEAT1 and NEAT2 domains were expressed in E. coli and employed in binding studies. First, the binding of soluble Vn to immobilized recombinant NEAT1 and NEAT2 was determined by ELISA. Vn bound dose dependently and saturably to both NEAT1 and NEAT2 fragments and with a binding profile resembling that exhibited by intact full-length IsdB NEAT1-NEAT2 (Fig. 4B). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments were performed to compare the binding of Vn to those of immobilized IsdB NEAT1-NEAT2 and single NEAT1 and NEAT2 fragments. Vn displayed a high binding activity, as indicated by the high response values and the slow dissociation of the IsdB-Vn complexes upon removal of the ligand. The best fit of the data points was obtained with the Langmuir isotherm equation describing a one-site binding model. From this analysis, we obtained dissociation constant (KD) values of 17.85 ± 3.51 nm, 16.73 ± 3.02 nm, and 16.21 ± 2.79 nm for IsdB NEAT1-NEAT2/Vn, NEAT1/Vn, and NEAT2/Vn, respectively (Fig. 5). All these findings show that full-length IsdB contains two separate binding sites that interact with nearly identical high affinities for Vn. To investigate whether IsdB competes with glycosaminoglycans for binding to Vn, the effect of heparin, heparan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate on Vn binding to immobilized IsdB NEAT1-NEAT2 was studied. In contrast to heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, heparin dose dependently inhibited the IsdB-Vn interaction, suggesting that IsdB interacts with the heparin-binding domain(s) of the protein (Fig. S3A).

Sleep quality refers to a sense of being rested and refreshed after waking up from sleep. People living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) are vulnerable to poor sleep quality as they suffer from social stigma and Anti-Retroviral drug side effects. The study aimed to examine the quality of sleep and its associated factors among people living with HIV/AIDS attending Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) clinic at Hawassa University comprehensive specialized hospital.Institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted among PLWHA attending ART clinic at Hawassa University comprehensive specialized hospital from May 1-30, 2019. A systematic random sampling technique was used to select an estimated 422 study participants and data was collected using interviewer-administered technique. Sleep Quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Data were entered and analyzed using SPSS 22 software. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to identify factors associated with quality of sleep. An adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval was computed to determine the level of significance with P-value less than 0.05.Out of 422 respondents, 389 participated in the study giving a response rate of 92.1%. The prevalence of poor quality of sleep among study participants was found to be 57.6% (95% CI: 54.72, 60.48). 31.9% (124) and 30.6% (119) of study participants had anxiety and depression respectively. Being between the age of 55-64 years (AOR = 5.7, 95% CI (1.9, 17.8), Age ≥ 65 (AOR:6.6, 95% CI (1.2, 36.9), Monthly income <1656 Ethiopian Birr (ETB) (AOR = 2.17, 95% CI (1.06, 4.4), having anxiety (AOR = 4.4, 95% CI (2.12, 9.2), having depression (AOR = 4.97, 95% CI (2.28, 10) and poor social support (AOR = 2.9, 95% CI (1.16, 7.3) were factors associated with poor quality of sleep.The prevalence of poor quality of sleep among PLWHA was significantly high. Average monthly income, age, anxiety, depression, and social support were found to be significantly associated with poor sleep quality. Health care professionals working at the ART clinic need to assess the sleep pattern of ART clients, give psychoeducation on the prevention and management of sleep pattern problems."

Distinct from classic membrane-integrated ion channels and transporters, βγ-CAT provides the first example of an endogenous secreted β-barrel PFP that extracellularly targets cellular endocytotic pathways to modulate the biochemical contents and properties of endolysosomes. This secreted PFP-mediated action represents a hitherto unknown regulatory mechanism of cell endocytosis and exocytosis via endolysosome modulation. This cellular acting pathway should be tightly regulated, and regulatory proteins of βγ-CAT may exist in the toad. In this study, a paralog of the βγ-CAT BmALP1 subunit (named BmALP3) was identified in B. maxima. BmALP3 homodimer linked by a disulfide bond specifically oxidized BmALP1 into its own homodimer via disulfide bond formation, as well as a water-soluble higher molecular weight polymer, which negatively regulated the assembly and biological functions of the βγ-CAT complex. To identify βγ-CAT-associated proteins, skin secretions of B. maxima were prepared and subjected to a pulldown assay using anti-βγ-CAT-Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography. A specific band, in addition to the two subunits of βγ-CAT, was found in the eluted proteins of anti-βγ-CAT columns by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A). The unknown protein band was further digested by trypsin and analyzed by MS; three MS/MS spectra representing the main components of digest products were selected for de novo sequencing, and the sequences of these peptide fragments matched well with the theoretical sequence deduced from the skin transcriptome of B. maxima (Fig. S1A). Subsequent molecular cloning of the unknown protein showed that its full-length cDNA was 601 bp, and the open reading frame was 471 bp, which encoded 156 amino acids (GenBank accession number MN787048). Sequence alignment revealed that the protein shared 27% sequence identity with the βγ-CAT BmALP1 subunit, suggesting that it was homologous to BmALP1, and we termed it BmALP3. Further sequence analysis revealed that BmALP3 contained only the aerolysin domain; this is different from BmALP1, which contained the βγ-crystallin domain and aerolysin domain (Fig. 1B and Fig. S1B). In addition, a specific conserved cysteine in the C-terminal region was found in both BmALP1 and BmALP3 (Fig. 1B and Fig. S1B). Our previous study verified that βγ-CAT was constitutively expressed in different tissues of B. maxima (21Xiang Y. Yan C. Guo X. Zhou K. Li S. Gao Q. Wang X. Zhao F. Liu J. Lee W.-H. Zhang Y. Host-derived, pore-forming toxin–like protein and trefoil factor complex protects the host against microbial infection.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Here, tissue localization analysis of BmALP3 at the mRNA and protein levels revealed that its tissue distribution pattern was consistent with that of βγ-CAT (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1C). Immunofluorescence staining also displayed strong colocalization of BmALP3 with βγ-CAT in different tissues of toad (Fig. 1D). In addition, a coimmunoprecipitation assay was performed and showed a significant interaction between BmALP3 and βγ-CAT in toad skin secretions (Fig. 1E). All of these findings showed that BmALP3 and βγ-CAT existed together, suggesting that the newly identified ALP paralog was involved in the functions of βγ-CAT. As mentioned above, BmALP3 existed mainly in the skin secretions of B. maxima. Thus, in the subsequent study, natural BmALP3 was purified to better understand its molecular characteristics and functions. B. maxima skin secretions were separated by a DEAE Sephadex A-50 column, and seven protein peaks were obtained; βγ-CAT was distributed in peaks I–VII and BmALP3 was distributed in peaks IV–VII (Fig. 2A). The hemolytic activity of skin secretions is mainly induced by βγ-CAT, as confirmed by an anti-βγ-CAT antibody blocking assay (Fig. S2A). Interestingly, the hemolytic activity of βγ-CAT in each fraction was decreased suddenly in association with the appearance of BmALP3 (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the function of βγ-CAT might be negatively regulated by BmALP3. Since free cysteine was easier to oxidize and BmALP3 contained its only cysteine in its C-terminal region, the reducing agent DTT was added in the following purification. DEAE Sephadex A-50 column peak VII was used in subsequent gel filtration and resulted in the separation of two protein peaks. Peak II was highly purified BmALP3, with an apparent weight of 18 kDa in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2B). In the following study, Western blotting revealed that a new 35-kDa band was found in nonreducing SDS-PAGE when purified BmALP3 was exposed to air for different times (Fig. 2C) or treated with H2O2 at different concentrations (Fig. 2D), whereas the 35-kDa band disappeared under reducing conditions (Fig. 2, C and D). A reasonable explanation was that the 35-kDa band was the dimeric form of BmALP3 under oxidative conditions. A point mutation assay also verified that the conserved C-terminal cysteine (Cys141) was responsible for BmALP3 homodimer formation under oxidative conditions (Fig. 2E). To further study whether BmALP3 dimerization was mediated by a disulfide bond, a MS assay was performed and showed that a peptide at m/z 6108.4 in the homodimer was observed after enzyme digestion, whereas this ion disappeared along with the appearance of a new ion with m/z 3055.1, which is close to the theoretical m/z value of the peptide that contains Cys141, when DTT was added (Fig. S2B). This implied that a disulfide bond may exist in the homodimer. Unfortunately, we failed to obtain the MALDI-postsource decay spectra of both ions because the ion intensity was too low for MS/MS analysis. To increase the signal intensity of the enzyme-digested peptide that contained Cys141, Glu150 was mutated to Arg. Similar to BmALP3, rBmALP3E150R could also be oxidized to a homodimer. A disulfide bond-linked peptide was found in the rBmALP3E150R homodimer by MS/MS (Fig. S2C). These results demonstrated that BmALP3 could be oxidized to a disulfide bond-linked homodimer via the conserved C-terminal cysteine under oxidative conditions. Since BmALP3 belongs to the ALP family, its oligomerization and pore-forming capacity were detected in a subsequent study. Given that BmALP3 existed in both the monomeric and dimeric states, we first detected the proportion of prepared BmALP3 monomer and homodimer before the following assay (Fig. S2D). A hemolytic assay on human red blood cells (RBCs) was performed to reflect pore-forming ability and revealed that there was no significant hemolysis when the concentration of BmALP3 was up to 1.28 mg/ml, while high hemolytic activity was observed after treatment with βγ-CAT (Fig. S2E). Oligomerization was the key step for ALP pore formation (14Szczesny P. Iacovache I. Muszewska A. Ginalski K. van der Goot F.G. Grynberg M.

Western blotting showed that there was no oligomer observed after cells (RBCs and toad peritoneal cells) or liposomes were treated with BmALP3, whereas the SDS-stable oligomer was observed in βγ-CAT-treated samples (Fig. S2, F–H). These findings indicated that BmALP3 lacks the typical pore-forming ability, which is different from previously reported ALPs. As a novel ALP that lacks the pore-forming ability, the three-dimensional structure of the BmALP3 monomer at 1.73 Å was next determined by the single-wavelength anomalous diffraction method (Table S1). The whole structure of BmALP3 could be divided into two distinct β-sandwiches; the N-terminal β-sandwich was formed by a twisted antiparallel five-stranded β-sheet together with a long hairpin, whereas the C-terminal β-sandwich comprised a three‐stranded antiparallel β‐sheet packing against a two-stranded β-sheet (Fig. 2F).The structural comparison revealed that it harbored the conserved aerolysin fold, which was similar to typical ALP family members, such as Dln1 (25Jia N. Liu N. Cheng W. Jiang Y.L. Sun H. Chen L.L. Peng J. Zhang Y. Ding Y.H. Zhang Z.H. Wang X. Cai G. Wang J. Dong M.Q.

However, the long hairpin of BmALP3 between strand β2 and strand β3 was enriched in hydrophilic amino acids (Fig. 2G), which was significantly different from the amphipathic pre-stem loop of previously reported ALPs (14Szczesny P. Iacovache I. Muszewska A. Ginalski K. van der Goot F.G. Grynberg M.

Notably, the conserved amphipathic pre-stem loop is pivotal for the pore-forming capacity of ALPs (14Szczesny P. Iacovache I. Muszewska A. Ginalski K. van der Goot F.G. Grynberg M. Extending the aerolysin family: from bacteria to vertebrates.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6 (21687664): e2034910.1371/journal.pone.0020349Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The hydrophilic hairpin may explain the poor pore-forming ability of BmALP3. All of the above findings revealed that, unlike typical ALP members, BmALP3 could be oxidized to a disulfide-linked homodimer but lacked the pore-forming ability, suggesting that it performs some novel functions that are different from those of classic ALPs, such as negative regulation. To probe the direct effects of BmALP3 on βγ-CAT, natural purified BmALP3, recombinant rBmALP3, and mutant rBmALP3C141A were used, and the hemolytic activity and oligomerization of βγ-CAT on RBCs and toad peritoneal cells were detected in vitro. Interestingly, both the hemolytic activity and oligomerization of βγ-CAT were largely attenuated by BmALP3 and rBmALP3 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3, A and B, and Fig. S3, A–C). However, these behaviors were not affected by rBmALP3C141A (Fig. 3A and Fig. S3, D and E). In contrast to natural BmALP3 or recombinant rBmALP3, rBmALP3C141A could not be oxidized to form a homodimer. The above findings suggested that the functions of βγ-CAT could be negatively regulated by oxidized BmALP3 homodimer rather than reduced monomer. To validate this hypothesis, fully reduced BmALP3 was prepared through pretreatment with DTT and applied in the in vitro activity inhibition assay. As expected, similar to rBmALP3C141A, the hemolytic activity and oligomerization of βγ-CAT were not affected by reduced BmALP3 under DTT treatment (Fig. 3, C and D, and Fig. S3F). The above findings indicated that BmALP3 negatively regulated the functions of βγ-CAT under oxidative conditions rather than under reducing conditions. A previous study demonstrated that βγ-CAT could reduce the infectious bacterial load in the toad peritoneum and protect toads against bacterial infection (21Xiang Y. Yan C. Guo X. Zhou K. Li S. Gao Q. Wang X. Zhao F. Liu J. Lee W.-H. Zhang Y. Host-derived, pore-forming toxin–like protein and trefoil factor complex protects the host against microbial infection.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

To further examine whether BmALP3 could inhibit βγ-CAT in vivo and affect the microbial clearance of toads, a toad peritoneal bacterial infection model was used. The results showed that the ability of βγ-CAT to induce rapid bacterial clearance was inhibited by intraperitoneal injection of BmALP3 and βγ-CAT together (Fig. 3E), and BmALP3 alone also attenuated the bacterial clearance ability of toads (Fig. 3F). All of these findings suggested that oxidized BmALP3 negatively regulates the function of βγ-CAT in vivo and in vitro, while reduced BmALP3 has no impact on the function of βγ-CAT. To further study the mechanism by which oxidized BmALP3 negatively regulates βγ-CAT, we first detected the states of two subunits of βγ-CAT under nonreducing conditions after treatment with BmALP3. Western blotting of BmALP1 showed that two new bands appeared in nonreducing SDS-PAGE, one band at ∼70 kDa and another at ∼170 kDa, whereas the two new bands were not found in reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4A). A reasonable explanation was that the two new bands were the dimeric and polymeric forms of BmALP1 that were oxidized by BmALP3. It is worth noting that the BmALP1 high-molecular-weight polymer could be reduced to a monomeric form (Fig. 4A), indicating that the reversible polymer was obviously different from the SDS-resistant oligomer that formed in cells or liposomes, as described above; thus, we termed this form the polymer to distinguish it from the SDS-resistant oligomer. In addition to BmALP1 being oxidized to a homodimer and a polymer, we next observed that the BmALP3 homodimer was reduced to its monomeric form in nonreducing SDS-PAGE after incubation with βγ-CAT (Fig. 4B). Previous studies demonstrated that the BmTFF3 subunit has no free cysteine (18Liu S.B. He Y.Y. Zhang Y. Lee W.H. Qian J.Q. Lai R. Jin Y.

Accordingly, Western blotting of BmTFF3 revealed that there was no obvious band position change in BmTFF3 in reducing or nonreducing SDS-PAGE after treatment with BmALP3 (Fig. S4A). A point mutation assay was used to probe which cysteine was responsible for BmALP1 dimerization and polymerization, and it showed that the formation of the BmALP1 homodimer and polymer were both dependent on the conserved C-terminal cysteine Cys321 (Fig. 4C). Further MS detection also verified that both the BmALP1 dimeric band and the polymeric band were linked by a disulfide bond via Cys321 (Fig. S4B). These results suggested that BmALP1 could be oxidized by the BmALP3 homodimer and form its own homodimer, as well as a polymer, via disulfide bond exchange. A previous study revealed that both the BmALP1 and BmTFF3 subunits were required for the functions of βγ-CAT and the dissociation of the BmALP1 and BmTFF3 subunits would lead to functional loss of βγ-CAT (18Liu S.B.

In this study, we isolated a LEA4 gene from alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) termed MsLEA4-4 via a homology cloning strategy. MsLEA4-4 encodes 166 amino acids, and the structural analysis showed that the gene contained five repeating TAQAAKEKTQQ amino acid motifs. There were a large number of α-helix in MsLEA4-4, and belongs to hydrophilic amino acid. Subcellular localization analysis showed that MsLEA4-4 was localized in the nucleus. The MsLEA4-4 promoter consisted of G-box and A-box elements, abscisic acid-responsive elements (ABREs), photo regulation and photoperiodic-controlling cis-acting elements, and endosperm expression motifs. The MsLEA4-4 overexpressing in Arabidopsis conferred late-germination phenotypes. Resistance of the overexpressed plants to abiotic stress significantly outperformed the wild-type (WT) plants. Under salt stress and abscisic acid treatment, with more lateral roots and higher chlorophyll content, the overexpressed plants has a higher survival rate measured against WT. Compared to those in the WT plants, the levels of soluble sugar and the activity of various antioxidant enzymes were elevated in the overexpressed plants, whereas the levels of proline and malondialdehyde were significantly reduced. The expression levels of several genes such as ABF3, ABI5, NCED5, and NCED9 increased markedly in the overexpressed plants compared to the WT under osmotic stress."

Receptor protein complexes perceive changes in intracellular phytohormone levels and trigger a signaling cascade to effectuate downstream responses. The in planta analysis of elements involved in phytohormone signaling can be achieved through transient expression in mesophyll protoplasts, which are a fast and versatile alternative to generating plant lines that stably express a transgene. While promoter-reporter constructs have been used successfully to identify internal or external factors that change phytohormone signaling, the range of available marker constructs does not meet the potential of the protoplast technique for large scale approaches. The aim of our study was to provide novel markers for phytohormone signaling in the Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplast system. We validated 18 promoter::luciferase constructs towards their phytohormone responsiveness and specificity and suggest an experimental setup for high-throughput analyses. We recommend novel markers for the analysis of auxin, abscisic acid, cytokinin, salicylic acid and jasmonic acid responses that will facilitate future screens for biological elements and environmental stimuli affecting phytohormone signaling."

Standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was computed to compare the incidence rates of the observed cases of SPBC in cancer survivors over the expected cases in the general population. Elevated risk of SPBC was observed in women with previous BC (SIR = 1.74) or thyroid cancer (SIR = 1.17). Women with initial skin melanoma in older age (≥50 years) (SIR = 1.11), or White race (SIR = 1.11) presented an elevated incidence of SPBC than the general female population. Besides, Asian/Pacific Islander (API) women with cancer of corpus uteri, ovary, bladder, or kidney were prone to developing SPBC when compared with the general population, with SIRs of 1.61, 1.35, 1.48, and 1.70, respectively. Male BC patients showed profound risk of developing SPBC (SIR = 34.86). Male leukemia patients also presented elevated risk of developing SPBC (SIR = 2.06). Our study suggests significant increase of SPBC in both sexes in the United States. Elevated risk of SPBC exists in survivors with primary BC, female thyroid cancer, male leukemia, and API female cancer patients with primary genitourinary cancer.

Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy analysis confirmed that three CC-PANI composites displayed longer and more stable polymerization pattern than BC-PANI because of the different polymerization method: bulk polymerization for BC-PANI and emulsion polymerization for CC-PANI, respectively. The electrical conductivity of BC-PANI and CC-PANI were ranging from 0.962 × 10−2 S/cm to 2.840 × 10−2 S/cm. MC-PANI showed the highest electrical conductivity among the four conductive cellulose fabrics. The flexibility and crease recovery results showed that MC-PANI had the highest flexibility compared to BC-PANI, HPMC-PANI, and CMC-PANI.

Previous transcriptome analysis using whole brains and whole striatal samples revealed a large number of dysregulated genes and affected biological pathways in HD (14Seredenina T. Luthi-Carter R. What have we learned from gene expression profiles in Huntington’s disease?.Neurobiol. Dis. 2012; 45 (21820514): 83-9810.1016/j.nbd.2011.07.001Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In the dysregulated genes, more than 80% of down-regulated genes are strongly expressed in striatal MSNs (e.g. D1R, D2R, SCN4B, and PPP1R1B) (15Desplats P.A. Kass K.E. Gilmartin T. Stanwood G.D.

Dis. 2012; 45 (21820514): 83-9810.1016/j.nbd.2011.07.001Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). On the other hand, gene expression alterations in non-MSN cells were also reported. Up-regulation of GFAP expression, an astrocytic inflammatory gene expression, was shown in the brain of HD model mice and HD patients (9Hodges A. Strand A.D. Aragaki A.K. Kuhn A. Sengstag T.

In addition, transcriptional activation of pro-inflammatory genes in microglia occurs in the brain of HD mice and HD patients (16Crotti A. Benner C. Kerman B.E. Gosselin D. Lagier-Tourenne C. Zuccato C. Cattaneo E. Gage F.H. Cleveland D.W. Glass C.K. Mutant Huntingtin promotes autonomous microglia activation via myeloid lineage-determining factors.Nat.

These results suggest that gene expression profiling using whole brains or whole striatal samples is affected by glial cell responses, and that critical genes contributing to MSN degeneration may be masked in common profiling assays. Here, we report comparative analysis of gene expression profiling between purified MSNs and whole striatal samples derived from presymptomatic R6/2 mice, which are the well-characterized and widely used HD model mice (17Mangiarini L. Sathasivam K. Seller M. Cozens B. Harper A. Hetherington C. Lawton M. Trottier Y. Lehrach H. Davies S.W. Bates G.P.

The R6/2 expresses the 5′ end of the human HD gene (HTT) containing an ∼120-CAG repeat expansion. The transgene expression is driven by the human HTT promoter, and the expression levels of transgene are around 75% of the endogenous levels. R6/2 mice display loss of body weight and progressive neurological phenotypes, such as motor deficits and tremor (17Mangiarini L. Sathasivam K. Seller M. Cozens B. Harper A. Hetherington C. Lawton M.

To avoid incorporation of non-MSN cells, striatal MSNs were genetically labeled (18Miyazaki H. Oyama F. Inoue R. Aosaki T. Abe T. Kiyonari H. Kino Y. Kurosawa M. Shimizu J. Ogiwara I. Yamakawa K.

To identify differentially expressed probes/genes (DEPs/DEGs) from purified MSNs and whole striatal samples, we performed microarray analysis using these two samples (FACS-array and STR-array). We identified a number of FACS-enriched DEPs/DEGs showing enhanced detection in FACS-array compared with STR-array. FACS-enriched DEPs/DEGs contained genes that were ubiquitously expressed in the brain rather than specifically expressed in the MSNs. Those FACS-enriched DEPs/DEGs could be masked in a common profiling assay by the changes of their expression in non-MSN cells. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed that FACS-enriched DEPs/DEGs were associated with “transcriptional regulation” and “DNA damage” that were distinct from the results of other gene sets (FACS-nonenriched DEPs/DEGs, STR-enriched DEPs/DEGs, STR-nonenriched DEPs/DEGs). Thus, the novel gene set, generated from contrast analysis between FACS-array and STR-array, provided masked disease cascade in a common profiling assay. We propose that the study of vulnerable cell-specific transcriptome analysis provides information valuable for understanding pathological cascades in neurodegenerative disorders. To label MSNs in R6/2 mice with Venus fluorescence protein genetically, we crossed R6/2 with a Scn4b-Venus mouse expressing Venus in MSNs under the control of a Scn4b-promoter (18Miyazaki H. Oyama F. Inoue R. Aosaki T. Abe T. Kiyonari H. Kino Y. Kurosawa M. Shimizu J. Ogiwara I. Yamakawa K. Koshimizu Y. Fujiyama F. Kaneko T. Shimizu H. et al.Singular localization of sodium channel β4 subunit in unmyelinated fibres and its role in the striatum.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 (25413837): 552510.1038/ncomms6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Double staining using anti-GFP, which recognizes Venus protein, and anti-DARPP-32, an established marker of MSNs, showed colocalization of these two signals (Fig. S1). This result indicates that Venus was definitely expressed in the MSNs of Scn4b-Venus mice. Next, we examined mRNA and protein levels of Venus in R6/2;Scn4b-Venus mice. Because Venus expression is driven by the promoter of Scn4b, which is one of the early down-regulated genes in HD (10Oyama F. Miyazaki H. Sakamoto N. Becquet C. Machida Y. Kaneko K. Uchikawa C. Suzuki T. Kurosawa M. Ikeda T. Tamaoka A. Sakurai T. Nukina N. Sodium channel β4 subunit: down-regulation and possible involvement in neuritic degeneration in Huntington’s disease transgenic mice.J.

The results of in situ hybridization (ISH) showed that, in addition to Scn4b mRNA, mRNA levels of Venus in MSNs of 4-week-old R6/2;Scn4b-Venus mice were already down-regulated to half of control levels (Fig. 1A), suggesting that Venus expression is affected by mHTT through the promoter. Consistent results were obtained by quantitative PCR (qPCR) using whole striatal samples (Fig. 1B). On the other hand, the immunohistochemical analysis showed that protein levels of Venus were mostly preserved in MSNs of 4-week-old R6/2;Scn4b-Venus mice, although the Venus protein expression was clearly reduced in 8- and 12-week-old R6/2;Scn4b-Venus mice compared with control (Fig. 1, C and D). These results indicate that even though Venus mRNA expression was affected by mHTT, protein levels of Venus were preserved in MSNs until 4 weeks in R6/2;Scn4b-Venus. Double staining with anti-GFP and anti-Htt (EM48), generated against the first 256 amino acids of truncated huntingtin protein (22Gutekunst C.A. Li S.H. Yi H. Mulroy J.S. Kuemmerle S. Jones R. Rye D. Ferrante R.J. Hersch S.M. Li X.J. Nuclear and neuropil aggregates in Huntington’s disease: relationship to neuropathology.J.

These diffuse Htt signals are called “nuclear accumulations” (NAs), which are distinct from the neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NIIs) observed in the degenerating neurons of HD mouse models and HD patients (4Nucifora Jr., F.C. Sasaki M. Peters M.F. Huang H. Cooper J.K. Yamada M. Takahashi H. Tsuji S. Troncoso J. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Ross C.A. Interference by huntingtin and atrophin-1 with cbp-mediated transcription leading to cellular toxicity.Science. 2001; 291 (11264541): 2423-242810.1126/science.1056784Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar, 23Meade C.A. Deng Y.P. Fusco F.R. Del Mar N. Hersch S. Goldowitz D. Reiner A. Cellular localization and development of neuronal intranuclear inclusions in striatal and cortical neurons in R6/2 transgenic mice.J. Comp. Neurol. 2002; 449 (12115678): 241-26910.1002/cne.10295Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Indeed, at 4 weeks, EM48- and ubiquitin-positive aggregates are mainly NAs or small-size NIIs in the striatum of R6/2, whereas the NIIs became obvious in association with a decrease in NAs at 8 weeks (Fig. S3). The percentage of NA-positive MSNs was more than 99% (n = 417 NA+Venus+ out of 418 Venus+) at 4 weeks. We thus decided to use the MSNs of 4-week-old R6/2;Scn4b-Venus and its control (WT;Scn4b-Venus) mice for array profiling for the following reasons: 1) mRNA levels of Scn4b, a representative DEG in HD, were already altered at this stage; 2) protein levels of Venus in MSNs of R6/2 mice were similar to those of control mice; and 3) secondary effects of transcriptional disruption would be small at this early stage. To purify MSNs, we dissected striatal regions from the brains of 4-week-old R6/2;Scn4b-Venus and its control mice and dissociated them with papain. After staining with propidium iodide (PI) to detect dead cells, the dissociated cells were sorted with FACS, and finally 5,000–10,000 Venus-positive MSNs were obtained (Fig. 2 (A–C) and Fig. S4). RNA quality of the sorted MSNs was assessed using Agilent Bioanalyzer to confirm no clear degradation (RIN > 7.0) (Fig. S5). Amplified and labeled MSN cDNAs were generated from the total RNA and hybridized to an Agilent SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (FACS-array) (Fig. 2A). To compare DEPs between purified MSNs and whole striatum, we performed microarray analysis using whole striatal samples from 4-week-old R6/2 and control mice (STR-array) (Fig. 2A). No degradation of total RNA of the striatal samples was confirmed by Agilent Bioanalyzer (RIN > 8.0) (Fig. S6). To validate purification of FACS-sorted MSNs, we performed qPCR using cell type–specific markers. The expression levels of cell type–specific markers for oligodendrocyte (Mbp, Mag, Mog, Sox10, and Gjc2), astrocyte (Gfap, Gjb6, Egfr3, Aqp4, and Slc1a2), microglia (Cx3cr1, Itgam, Tmem119, and Fcrl), and striatal interneurons (Calb2, Chat, Sst, Pvalb, Npy, and Htr3a) (24Silberberg G. Bolam J.P. Local and afferent synaptic pathways in the striatal microcircuitry.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2015; 33 (26051382): 182-18710.1016/j.conb.2015.05.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) were very low in the FACS-purified MSNs compared with whole striatal samples (Fig. 2D). Only the expression of Th, a marker of the striatal interneuron subtype, was detected in purified MSNs (Fig. 2D). The result suggests that a subset of Th-expressing interneurons could remain in FACS-purified MSN fractions or detect local expression of TH mRNA in the terminals of nigrostriatal projection fibers (25Gervasi N.M. Scott S.S. Aschrafi A. Gale J. Vohra S.N. MacGibeny M.A. Kar A.N. Gioio A.E. Kaplan B.B.

In contrast, the expression of MSN subtype markers, such as Drd1a and Tac1 (striatonigral MSN markers) and Drd2 and Penk (striatopallidal MSN markers), was detected in the FACS-purified MSNs (Fig. 2D). Comparative analysis between FACS-purified MSNs gene expression data (WT;Scn4b-Venus, raw signal > 3,000, 3,014 probes) (Table S1) and Heiman’s MSN-enriched gene expression data (3,897 genes) (26Heiman M.

Furthermore, well-known striatal-enriched genes, Ppp1r1b, Ptpn5, Arpp19, Arpp21, Gnal, Rasd2, Rgs9, Adcy5, Gng7, Rasgrp2, Pde1b, Pde10a, Gpr88, Rarb, Strn4, Foxp1, and Zfp503 (26Heiman M. Schaefer A.

These results indicate that we obtained an MSN-enriched fraction containing both striatonigral and striatopallidal MSN subtypes by FACS. Microarray data for FACS-purified MSNs and whole striatal samples are available in the GEO database under accession numbers GSE113928, GSE113929, and GSE113930. First, we performed qPCR validation for FACS- and STR-array data. The qPCR results of known dysregulated genes (14Seredenina T. Luthi-Carter R. What have we learned from gene expression profiles in Huntington’s disease?.Neurobiol. Dis. 2012; 45 (21820514): 83-9810.1016/j.nbd.2011.07.001Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) showed consistent results with log2 -fold change (FC) values of the microarray data (Fig. 3, A and B). This result indicates that both FACS- and STR-array data certainly include mHTT-associated differentially expressed genes. Next, to identify differentially expressed probes of FACS-array (FACS-array DEPs), microarray data were statistically analyzed using GeneSpring software. We identified 1,014 probes showing different signals in R6/2 MSNs (absolute (abs) FC > 1.5, p < 0.05, raw signal > 100) (Table S2). To find DEPs showing enrichment in FACS-array compared with STR-array, we examined the ratio of absolute FC of FACS-array DEPs to corresponding probes in STR-array (FACS-FC/STR-FC). The FACS-array DEPs showing FACS-FC/STR-FC > 1.5 were selected as FACS-enriched DEPs. The FACS-enriched DEPs referred to more detectable DEPs by FACS-array than STR-array due to their higher FC. On the other hand, the FACS-array DEPs showing similar FC and the same directional change as STR-array (FACS-FC/STR-FC < 1.5) were selected as FACS-nonenriched DEPs (Fig. S7A). Because FACS-“enriched” DEPs should include “dramatically changed” DEPs compared with STR-array, we included the DEPs showing opposite expression change compared with corresponding STR-probes (up and down or down and up). Those probes were also considered “dramatically changed” DEPs and included in the FACS-enriched DEP set (Fig. S7A). To obtain an overview of the array data, we plotted the log2 FCs of the FACS-array DEPs against those of corresponding probes in STR-array (Fig. 3C and Fig. S8A). DEPs located on the positive direction area of the x axis (from 0 to 5) are up-regulated genes in R6/2 MSNs, and DEPs located on the negative direction area of the x axis (from 0 to −5) are down-regulated genes in R6/2 MSNs. Likewise, DEPs located on the positive direction area of the y axis (from 0 to 5) are up-regulated genes in R6/2 striatum, and DEPs located on the negative direction area of the y axis (from 0 to −5) are down-regulated genes in R6/2 striatum (Fig. 3, C and D). In addition, DEPs located on the opposite direction area (x axis, 0–5; y axis, 0 to −5; x axis, 0 to −5; y axis, 0–5) are the DEPs showing opposite expression regulation between FACS-array and STR-array. We identified 677 FACS-enriched DEPs (pink dots in Fig. 3C) and 337 FACS-nonenriched DEPs (blue dots in Fig. 3C) (Table S2). Notably, known dysregulated genes such as Scn4b (FC = −2.22, p = 0.0068) and Rgs4 (FC = −1.63, p = 0.0076) were mostly found in FACS-nonenriched DEPs (red dots in Fig. 3C). We next identified DEPs strongly detected by STR-array (STR-enriched DEPs) in the same way as the FACS-array DEPs. To extract STR-enriched DEPs, we examined the ratio of absolute FC of STR-array DEPs to corresponding probes in FACS-array (STR-FC/FACS-FC). The STR-array DEPs showing STR-FC/FACS-FC > 1.5 were selected as STR-enriched DEPs, and the STR-array DEPs showing similar FC to FACS-array (FACS-FC/STR-FC < 1.5) were selected as STR-nonenriched DEPs (Fig. S7A). The DEPs showing opposite expression change with corresponding FACS-probes (up and down or down and up) were included as STR-enriched DEPs in the same way as the FACS-enriched DEPs (Fig. S7A). We identified 170 STR-enriched DEPs (purple dots in Fig. 3D) and 326 STR-nonenriched DEPs (green dots in Fig. 3D) (Table S3). Log2 FCs of the STR-array DEPs against those of corresponding probes in FACS-array (Fig. 3D and Fig. S8B) showed that known dysregulated genes, Scn4b (FC = −2.33, p = 0.0003) and Rgs4 (FC = −2.24, p = 0.0031), were contained in STR-nonenriched DEPs (red dots in Fig. 3D). Taken together, we created four probe set from FACS- and STR-array DEPs according to enrichment of the two different arrays: FACS-enriched DEPs, FACS-nonenriched DEPs, STR-enriched DEPs, and STR-nonenriched DEPs. Because known dysregulated genes were enriched in the FACS-nonenriched DEPs, FACS-enriched DEPs could contain DEPs that are masked in commonly used profiling analyses. To explore the biological implications for each probe set, we carried out GO enrichment analysis using DAVID 6.8 (RRID:SCR_001881), which is a web-accessible program to investigate functional associations among differentially expressed genes (27Huang da W. Sherman B.T. Lempicki R.A. Systematic and integrative analysis of large gene lists using DAVID bioinformatics resources.Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4 (19131956): 44-5710.1038/nprot.2008.211Crossref PubMed Scopus (22690) Google Scholar). The top 5 annotation clusters in each probe set produced by a functional annotation clustering tool are presented in Fig. 4 (genes of all clusters are listed in Table S4). Notably, FACS-enriched DEPs were associated with “regulation of transcription,” “DNA damage,” and “DNA repair,” whereas the other three probe sets were associated with neuronal functions and properties such as “ion transport,” “calcium signaling pathway,” and “synapse.” These results suggest that FACS-enriched DEPs may be more relevant to basic cellular function rather than neuronal function. Next, we performed further selection using more stringent criteria, because some of the probes with low signal value (less than 500 in microarray data) were difficult to verify by qPCR (data not shown). To select more verifiable DEPs, we eliminated the probes with raw signal < 500 from the normalized FACS-array data."
https://openalex.org/W3033769695,"Introduction The burden of HIV infection in southern Africa is a public health concern with an increasing number of new infections. This study sought to investigate the predictors of HIV prevalence in Mozambique through a complex samples logistic regression and spatial mapping approach using nationally representative data. Methods We conducted a secondary data analysis using the 2015 Mozambique Demographic and Health Survey and AIDS Indicator Survey. The analysis performed in four stages while incorporating population survey sampling weights did the following: i) created a complex sample plan file in SPSS, ii) performed the weighted estimate of HIV prevalence, iii) performed complex sample chi-square test of independence, and then iv) performed complex sample logistic regression modeling. Results Out of 11,270 participants, 1,469 (13.0%) tested positive for HIV. The prevalence of HIV infection was higher in females (15.1%) than males (10.2%). We found that urban dwellers were more likely to be HIV-positive compared to rural dwellers (AOR: 1.70; CI: 1.27, 2.27). We observed provincial variations in HIV prevalence, with Maputo Cidade (17.4%), Maputo Provincia (22.6%), Gaza (25.2%) recording higher prevalence above the national estimate. Other independent predictors of HIV infection in Mozambique included age, education level, marital status, total lifetime sexual partners, and having had an STI in the last 12 months. Conclusions The study revealed associations between high-risk sexual behavior and HIV infection. Results from our spatial mapping approach can help health policy makers to better allocate resources for cost-effective HIV/AIDS interventions. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) campaigns among high-risk groups should be pursued to lower the reservoir of HIV among high-risk groups."
https://openalex.org/W3032935147,"Shock waves are gaining interests in biological and medical applications. In this work, we investigated the mechanical characteristics of shock waves that affect cell viability. In vitro testing was conducted using the metastatic breast epithelial cell line MDA-MB-231. Shock waves were generated using a high-power pulse laser. Two different coating materials and different laser energy levels were used to vary the peak pressure, decay time, and the strength of subsequent peaks of the shock waves. Within the testing capability of the current study, it is shown that shock waves with a higher impulse led to lower cell viability, a higher detached cell ratio, and a higher cell death ratio, while shock waves with the same peak pressure could lead to different levels of cell damage. The results also showed that the detached cells had a higher cell death ratio compared to the attached cells. Moreover, a critical shock impulse of 5 Pa·s was found to cause the cell death ratio of the detached cells to exceed 50%. This work has demonstrated that, within the testing range shown here, the impulse, rather than the peak pressure, is the governing shock wave parameter for the damage of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. The result suggests that a lower-pressure shock wave with a longer duration, or multiple sequential low amplitude shock waves can be applied over a duration shorter than the fundamental response period of the cells to achieve the same impact as shock waves with a high peak pressure but a short duration. The finding that cell viability is better correlated with shock impulse rather than peak pressure has potential significant implications on how shock waves should be tailored for cancer treatments, enhanced drug delivery, and diagnostic techniques to maximize efficacy while minimizing potential side effects."
https://openalex.org/W3034045454,"The vestibular system is essential to produce adequate postural responses enabling voluntary movement. However, how the vestibular system influences corticospinal output during postural tasks is still unknown. Here, we examined the modulation exerted by the vestibular system on corticospinal output during standing. Healthy subjects (n = 25) maintained quiet standing, head facing forward with eyes closed. Galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) was applied bipolarly and binaurally at different delays prior to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) which triggered motor evoked potentials (MEPs). With the cathode right/anode left configuration, MEPs in right Soleus (SOL) muscle were significantly suppressed when GVS was applied at ISI = 40 and 130ms before TMS. With the anode right/cathode left configuration, no significant changes were observed. Changes in the MEP amplitude were then compared to changes in the ongoing EMG when GVS was applied alone. Only the decrease in MEP amplitude at ISI = 40ms occurred without change in the ongoing EMG, suggesting that modulation occurred at a premotoneuronal level. We further investigated whether vestibular modulation could occur at the motor cortex level by assessing changes in the direct corticospinal pathways using the short-latency facilitation of the SOL Hoffmann reflex (H-reflex) by TMS. None of the observed modulation occurred at the level of motor cortex. Finally, using the long-latency facilitation of the SOL H-reflex, we were able to confirm that the suppression of MEP at ISI = 40ms occurred at a premotoneuronal level. The data indicate that vestibular signals modulate corticospinal output to SOL at both premotoneuronal and motoneuronal levels during standing."
https://openalex.org/W3033070374,"Introduction To mitigate the recent nationwide shortage of intravenous opioids, we developed a standardized perioperative oral opioid guideline anchored with appropriate use of nonopioid analgesia, neuraxial and loco-regional techniques. We hypothesize that adoption of this new guideline was associated with: 1) equivalent patient reported pain scores in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU); and 2) equivalent total opioid use (oral and parenteral) during the perioperative period. Methods Cases performed from July 1, 2017 to May 31, 2019 were screened. All opioids administered were converted to intravenous morphine milligram equivalents. Segmented regression analyses of interrupted time series were performed examining the change in opioid use, PACU pain scores and number of non-opioid analgesic medications used before and after the protocol implementation in April 2018. Results After exclusions, 29, 621 cases were included in the analysis. No significant differences in demographic, ASA status, case length and surgical procedure type were present in the pre and post-intervention period. A significant decrease in total (Estimate: -39.9 mg, SE: 6.9 mg, p < 0.001) and parenteral (Estimate: -51.6 mg, SE: 7.1 mg, p < 0.001) opioid use with a significant increase in oral opioid use (Estimate: 9.4 mg, SE: 1.1 mg, p < 0.001) was noted after the intervention. Pain scores were not significantly different between the pre- and post-intervention period (Estimate: 0.05, SE: 0.13, p = 0.69). Conclusion We report our experience with a primary perioperative oral based opioid regimen that is associated with decreased total opioid consumption and equivalent patient reported pain scores."
https://openalex.org/W3033489314,"Homeostatic scaling of the synapse, such as synaptic down-scaling, has been proposed to offset deleterious effects induced by sustained synaptic strength enhancement. Proper function and subcellular distribution of Src homology 2 domain-containing nonreceptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP2) are required for synaptic plasticity. However, the role of SHP2 in synaptic down-scaling remains largely unknown. Here, using biochemical assays and cell-imaging techniques, we found that synaptic SHP2 levels are temporally regulated during synaptic down-scaling in cultured hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, we observed that a Noonan syndrome-associated mutation of SHP2, resulting in a D61G substitution, prevents synaptic down-scaling. We further show that this effect is due to an inability of the SHP2-D61G variant to properly disassociate from postsynaptic density protein 95, leading to impaired SHP2 dispersion from synaptic sites after synaptic down-scaling. Our findings reveal a molecular mechanism of the Noonan syndrome-associated genetic variant SHP2-D61G that contributes to deficient synaptic down-scaling."
https://openalex.org/W3033621309,"Mutations in the ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR1) gene are associated with several human congenital myopathies, including the dominantly inherited central core disease and exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis, and the more severe recessive phenotypes, including multiminicore disease, centronuclear myopathy, and congenital fiber type disproportion. Within the latter group, those carrying a hypomorphic mutation in one allele and a missense mutation in the other are the most severely affected. Because of nonsense-mediated decay, most hypomorphic alleles are not expressed, resulting in homozygous expression of the missense mutation allele. This should result in 50% reduced expression of the ryanodine receptor in skeletal muscle, but its observed content is even lower. To study in more detail the biochemistry and pathophysiology of recessive RYR1 myopathies, here we investigated a mouse model we recently generated by analyzing the effect of bi-allelic versus mono-allelic expression of the RyR1 p.A4329D mutation. Our results revealed that the expression of two alleles carrying the same mutation or of one allele with the mutation in combination with a hypomorphic allele does not result in functionally equal outcomes and impacts skeletal muscles differently. In particular, the bi-allelic RyR1 p.A4329D mutation caused a milder phenotype than its mono-allelic expression, leading to changes in the biochemical properties and physiological function only of slow-twitch muscles and largely sparing fast-twitch muscles. In summary, bi-allelic expression of the RyR1 p.A4329D mutation phenotypically differs from mono-allelic expression of this mutation in a compound heterozygous carrier.

Muscle contraction is brought about by a massive release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) throughout the entire length of the muscle fiber via a process called excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) (1Melzer W.

Calcium release from the SR via the calcium release channel ryanodine receptor is initiated by a voltage-dependent orthograde signal delivered by the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR), the voltage sensor localized in the transverse tubule membrane (T-tubules). Muscle relaxation is brought about by calcium reuptake into the SR by the sarco(endo)plasmic CaATPase (SERCA). ECC occurs at the contact region between the T-tubules and the SR membrane, within a domain encompassing a macromolecular complex formed by the ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1), DHPR, and the calcium-buffering protein calsequestrin (3Franzini-Armstrong C.

A great deal of data has shown that recessive RYR1 mutations are mostly linked to cases of MmD, CNM, or congenital fiber type disproportion; patients with recessive mutations may carry homozygous mutations (i.e. the same mutation in both alleles) or two different mutations, one inherited from the paternal allele and the other from the maternal allele. In many patients carrying compound heterozygous mutations, one of the mutations causes a premature termination of the RyR1 protomer, leading to the mono-allelic and homozygous expression of a missense mutation. One of the molecular signatures of the mono-allelic expression of a missense mutation is a dramatic decrease of the RyR1 protein content in total muscle homogenates from patients and the overexpression of chromatin-modifying enzymes, such as histone deacetylases (HDACs) and DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) (13Rokach O.

The focus of this study is to determine whether phenotypic differences result from the presence of a homozygous Ryr1 mutation and the mono-allelic expression of the same Ryr1 mutation on the genetic background of a compound heterozygous carrier (with the other allele carrying a null mutation). In particular, in the present report we have examined the phenotype of mice carrying the homozygous mutation in Ryr1 exon 91 (referred to as HO91) compared with that of the mouse model carrying the compound heterozygous mutation in exon 36 and exon 91 (15Elbaz M.

Genet. 2019; 28 (31044239): 2987-299910.1093/hmg/ddz092Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) (referred to as DKI) and that of a mouse heterozygous for the expression of the exon 91 mutation (referred to as Het91). Our results show that at variance with compound heterozygous RyR1Q1970fsX16+A4329D mice, the homozygous expression of the RyR1 p.A4329D mutation (referred to as RyR1A4329D mice) mainly affects slow-twitch muscles, with negligible effects on fast-twitch muscles. In particular, our results show that the homozygous expression of RyR1 p.A4329D causes a decrease of the RyR1 protein content in total muscle homogenates from soleus muscles only. The reduction of RyR1 protein is associated with a decrease of the (i) total running distance, (ii) the peak twitch and tetanic force in soleus muscles, and (iii) the peak twitch and tetanic calcium transient in soleus muscles. The presence of the homozygous missense mutation in Ryr1 Ex91 of the mice used for the experiments was confirmed by diagnostic digestion of PCR-amplified DNA with the restriction enzyme PvuII (Fig. S1). RyR1A4329D homozygous (HO91) mice did not exhibit a postnatal lethal phenotype or defects in embryonic development and were indistinguishable from WT or Het91 Ryr1 mutant carrier littermates. Analysis of the growth curves performed during the observation period of 18 weeks indicates that both male and female HO91 mice exhibit a body weight similar to that of WT littermates (Fig. 1A). The growth curve of Het91 mice was similar to that of their WT littermates. We used the voluntary running wheel setup (16Mosca B. Delbono O. Laura Messi M. Bergamelli L. Wang Z.-M. Vukcevic M. Lopez R. Treves S. Nishi M. Takeshima H. Paolini C. Martini M. Rispoli G. Protasi F. Zorzato F.

Commun. 2013; 4 (23443569): 154110.1038/ncomms2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) to investigate the in vivo skeletal muscle function of RyR1A4329D mutant mice. Mice had free access to the running wheel at any time of day; this experimental approach avoids potential problems linked to the effect of circadian rhythm on animal activity and/or animal compliance in performing nonvoluntary motor activity. The total dark phase running distance of three-month-old HO91 and Het91 mice was compared with that of their WT littermates (Fig. 1B). In the first week, the total running distance of WT and mutant mice was similar. 2 weeks of training improved skeletal muscle performance in all groups. After 3 weeks of training, the total running distance of the WT and Het91 mice was ∼34% longer than that of HO91 mice (Mann-Whitney two-tailed test, calculated over the running period of 21 days; p < 0.05, n = 12 WT, n = 8 heterozygous, and n = 7 homozygous). The shorter running distance was also associated with a lower median cruise speed of the HO91 mutant mice than WT littermates (Fig. 1C; p < 0.05 by Mann-Whitney test, two-tailed test). Interestingly, both HO91 and Het91 mice spent significantly less time on the running wheel than their WT littermates (Fig. 1D). The reduced speed and shorter total running distance of the HO91 mice may result from reduced muscle strength caused by alterations of the macromolecular complexes involved in ECC. We examined such a possibility by investigating the mechanical properties of intact extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and soleus muscles upon delivery of a single action potential or by a train of pulses of 1.0-ms duration delivered at 50, 100, and 150 Hz for 400 ms in EDL muscles and at 50, 100, and 120 Hz for 1100 ms in soleus muscles (Fig. 2) (16Mosca B. Delbono O. Laura Messi M. Bergamelli L. Wang Z.-M. Vukcevic M. Lopez R. Treves S. Nishi M. Takeshima H. Paolini C. Martini M. Rispoli G. Protasi F. Zorzato F.

Commun. 2013; 4 (23443569): 154110.1038/ncomms2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The averaged specific twitch peak force induced by a single action potential in EDL from HO91 mice was similar to that of EDL from WT mice (Fig. 2) (72.07 ± 12.52 mN/mm2, n = 9, versus 86.44 ± 25.05 mN/mm2, n = 11, respectively; values are expressed as mean ± S.D., p < 0.05). Similarly, the specific tetanic force was similar in EDL from WT and HO91 mice (360.34 ± 64.17 mN/mm2, n = 11, versus 337.55 ± 35.09 mN/mm2, n = 9, respectively; values are expressed as mean ± S.D., p < 0.05). On the other hand, soleus muscles from HO91 mice exhibited a 36% decrease of twitch specific peak force compared with that of WT littermates (34.20 ± 15.57 mN/mm2, n = 9, versus 52.75 ± 11.15 mN/mm2, n = 10, respectively; values are expressed as mean ± S.D.; p < 0.05), as well as a 30% decrease in the maximal specific tetanic force (200.72 ± 32.82 mN/mm2, n = 10, versus 143.66 ± 55.96 mN/mm2, n = 8, in WT and HO91, respectively; values are expressed as mean ± S.D., p < 0.05). The specific force (twitch and tetanic) of EDL and soleus muscles from the Het91 mice were not different from those of littermate WT mice (Fig. S2). The decrease in force output cannot be accounted for by fast-to-slow fiber transition, because there were no changes in the expression of myosin heavy-chain (MyHC) isoforms in EDL and soleus muscles (Fig. 3A and B). Similarly, the reduced absolute force developed cannot be attributed to a major loss of contractile proteins, as the wet weight of the EDL and soleus muscles from HO91 and WT mice were similar (muscle wet weight of EDL was 12.79 ± 1.54 mg, n = 11, versus 11.21 ± 1.10 mg, n = 9, in WT and HO91 mice, respectively). Values are expressed as mean ± S.D., p < 0.05. Wet weight of soleus was 12.37 ± 2.06 mg, n = 10, versus 12.16 ± 0.93 mg, n = 9, in WT and HO91, respectively; values are expressed as mean ± S.D., p > 0.05. On the other hand, soleus muscles from HO91 mice show a small decrease of the minimal Feret's fiber diameter, indicating a slight atrophy of the slow-twitch fibers (Fig. 3A, C, and D), which may explain, at least in part, the decrease of muscle strength. No histological changes were present in EDL and soleus muscles from Het91 mice (results not shown). The decreased muscle strength of RyR1A4329D mice was apparently not because of fast-to-slow fiber type transition but rather may be linked to atrophy of slow-twitch muscles, to alterations of the expression of ECC components, or to a combination of both. Thus, we investigated the protein content and transcripts encoding the major protein components of the macromolecular complex involved in skeletal muscle ECC (17Treves S. Vukcevic M. Maj M.

Transcript quantification was assessed by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) comparing WT and HO91 samples. No changes in the expression levels of Cacna1s, Stac3, and Ryr1 transcripts were apparent in EDL and soleus muscles from HO91 mice (Fig. 4A). We also investigated if the levels of histone deacetylases as class II HDACs are elevated in muscles of patients carrying recessive RYR1 mutations (13Rokach O. Sekulic-Jablanovic M. Voermans N.

The expression of Hdac9 (a class IIa deacetylase) was elevated in soleus muscles from HO91 mice, whereas the levels of expression of the other HDACs were similar in WT and HO91 muscles (Fig. 4A). The contents of the main protein components of sarcotubular membranes in total homogenate from EDL and soleus muscles from WT and HO91 mice were determined by quantitative Western blot analysis. Figure S3 shows the specific immunoreactivity of the antibodies that were used for Western blot analysis. No significant changes in Cav1.1, RyR1, Stac3, SERCA1, SERCA2, calsequestrin, calreticulin, and JP45 protein content were observed in EDL total homogenates from HO91 mice (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, however, RyR1 and Cav1.1 protein content was significantly reduced in soleus muscles from HO91 mice compared with that of WT littermates (RyR1 content was 64.0 ± 19.8% of WT [mean ± S.E.], n = 13, p < 0.01, and Cav1.1 content was 44.9 ± 7.9% of WT [mean ± S.E.], n = 7, p < 0.05). The content of the other SR proteins analyzed was unchanged (Fig. 4B). ECC protein content was unaltered in muscles from Het91 mice (results not shown). The decrease of RyR1 and Cav1.1 observed in soleus muscles should affect the amount of calcium released during ECC, and this was directly investigated by measuring calcium transients in single EDL and soleus fibers loaded with the low-affinity calcium indicator MagFluo4. The resting calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) was measured with the ratiometric Ca2+ indicator Fura-2, and there were no differences between EDL and soleus fibers from HO91 and WT mice (Fig. 5A). In line with previous results (18Schulz R.A. Yutzey K.E. Calcineurin signalling and NFAT activation in cardiovascular and skeletal muscle development.Dev. Biol. 2004; 266 (14729474): 1-1610.1016/j.ydbio.2003.10.008Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), the resting [Ca2+]i of soleus fibers was higher than that of EDL fibers. In particular, the mean ± S.E. resting [Ca2+]i in soleus was 86.5 ± 6.3 nM (n = 29) and 82.3 ± 4.5 nM (n = 29), and in EDL it was 71.6 ± 6.6 nM (n = 24) and 68.2 ± 3.5 nM (n = 32) in WT and HO91 mice, respectively (Fig. 5A). In the presence of 1.8 mm Ca2+ in the extracellular solution, the averaged peak Ca2+ transient induced by a single action potential in EDL fibers from WT mice was similar to that of HO91 mice (Fig. 5B). The mean (±S.D.) ΔF/F0 was 1.14 ± 0.52, n = 41, versus 1.17 ± 0.36, n = 50, respectively (Mann-Whitney test, p > 0.05). In contrast, the peak Ca2+ transients elicited in HO91 soleus fibers were decreased by 28% compared with those of the WT (Fig. 5B) (the mean ± S.D. ΔF/F0 was 0.51 ± 0.06, n = 39, versus 0.65 ± 0.09, n = 50, respectively; Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.05). No major changes in the kinetics of the Ca2+ transients were observed (Table S3). The summation of Ca2+ transient peaks evoked by a train of pulses delivered at 100 Hz in the presence of 1.8 mm Ca2+ in the extracellular solution in EDL fibers from HO91 mice was not different from that of WT mice (Fig. 5B) (the mean ± S.D. ΔF/F0 was 1.62 ± 0.38, n = 21, versus 1.64 ± 0.43, n = 23, respectively; Mann-Whitney test, p > 0.05) (Table S3). In soleus fibers from HO91 mice, the peak calcium transients induced by tetanic stimulation (Fig. 5B) was approximately 30% lower than that of WT mice (the mean ± S.D. ΔF/F0 was 1.12 ± 0.13, n = 24, versus 1.60 ± 0.11, respectively; Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.05) (Table S3). Analysis of calcium homeostasis in flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) fibers from Het91 mice revealed no differences (i) in the resting [Ca2+]i, (ii) in the twitch Ca2+ transient, and (iii) in the Ca2+ transient elicited by tetanic stimulation between WT and Het91 mice (Fig. S4). Here, we investigated the skeletal muscle phenotype of a mouse model carrying the p.A4329D missense mutation in ex91 of the Ryr1 gene. This study shows that the bi-allelic expression of the RyR1 p.A4329D mutation is phenotypically different from the mono-allelic expression of the same Ryr1 mutation on the genetic background of a compound heterozygous carrier. In particular, the presence of the bi-allelic expression of the RyR1 p.A4329D mutation causes a mild muscle phenotype affecting mostly slow-twitch muscles, with minor, if any, effects on fast-twitch EDL muscles. Slow-twitch muscles from RyR1A4329D homozygous mice show a 60% reduction of RyR1 and Cav1.1 protein content and no changes in Stac3 content, whereas no changes were apparent in total homogenates of fast-twitch EDL muscles. The reduction of RyR1 content in slow-twitch muscles is accompanied by (i) a small reduction of minimal Ferret's diameter of soleus fibers and a 30% reduction of (ii) peak twitch and tetanic force development and (iii) peak tetanic calcium transients. The basic mechanism of ECC is similar between different fiber types; however, there are functional and structural heterogeneities within the calcium homeostasis toolkit between fast- and slow-twitch muscles controlling the kinetics of the calcium transients leading to muscle contraction (19Baylor S.M. Hollingworth S. Intracellular calcium movements during excitation-contraction coupling in mammalian slow-twitch and fast-twitch muscle fibers.J. Gen. Physiol. 2012; 139 (22450485): 261-27210.1085/jgp.201210773Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The ECC macromolecular complex of slow-twitch muscles shows distinct qualitative and quantitative features compared with those of fast-twitch muscles that might be important and account for the fiber type specificity of the muscle phenotype of the HO91 mice. Indeed, in slow-twitch muscles the membrane density of the DHPR and RyR1 is ∼2- to 3-fold lower than that present in fast-twitch muscles (20Lamb G.D.

As to the cause of the decreased RyR1 content in HO91 soleus muscles, it cannot be because of protein instability, as it would have occurred in all muscle types. In this context, it is interesting that the mechanical properties of extraocular muscles from HO91 mice were similar to those of WT littermates, as was the RyR1 protein level (23Eckhardt J. Bachmann C. Benucci S. Elbaz M. Ruiz A. Zorzato F. Treves S.

Genet. 2020; 29: 1330-133910.1093/hmg/ddaa056Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The reduction in RyR1 and Cav1.1 may be caused at least in part by alterations of transcriptional regulation brought about by epigenetic modifications. Compatibly, in soleus muscles (but not in EDL muscles), HDAC9 levels were increased. HDAC9, like HDAC4, HDAC5, and HDAC7, is a member of the class II HDAC family (24Haberland M. Montgomery R.L. Olson E.N. The many roles of histone de-acetylases in development and physiology: implications for disease and therapy.Nat. Rev.

Furthermore, HDAC4 and HDAC5 levels are increased in the muscles of patients carrying recessive RYR1 mutations (13Rokach O. Sekulic-Jablanovic M. Voermans N. Wilmshurst J. Pillay K. Heytens L.

Additionally, we have shown that the RyR1 p.A4329D mutation decreases the sensitivity of RyR1 to calcium and caffeine (15Elbaz M. Ruiz A. Bachmann C. Eckhardt J. Pelczar P. Venturi E. Lindsay C.

The A4329 residue is distant from the amino acid residues that have been proposed to come from the RyR1 calcium binding sites in the linear RyR1 sequence (28Des Georges A. Clarke O.B. Zalk R. Yuan Q. Condon K.J. Grassucci R.A. Hendrickson W.A. Marks A.R. Frank J. Structural basis for gating and activation of RyR1.Cell. 2016; 167 (27662087): 145-15710.1016/j.cell.2016.08.075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). High-resolution cryo-EM of RyR1 has shown that E3893, E3967, and T5001, plus amino acids H3895 and Q3970, make up the high-affinity calcium binding site, which is likely to be involved in calcium-dependent RyR1 activation. The resolution of the amino acid sequence encompassing residue A4329 of the available RyR1 3D structure is poor, and presently it is still not possible to establish exactly whether A4329 interacts with any of the above-mentioned key residues to destabilize the conformation of the calcium binding site. As to the mechanism by which the low-calcium and caffeine sensitivity of RyR1 p.A4329D channels contribute to the muscle phenotype of the HO91 mice, it may relate to"
https://openalex.org/W3033308002,"The aim of this study was to determine the effect of rotenone stress on Aphis glycines Matsumura (Hemiptera: Aphididae) populations in different habitats of Northeast China. The changes in kinase expression activity of endogenous substances (proteins, total sugars, trehalose, cholesterol, and free amino acids), detoxifying enzymes (cytochrome P450 and glutathione S-transferase), and metabolic enzymes (proteases and phosphofructokinases) in specimens from three populations were compared before and after stress with rotenone at median lethal concentration (LC50) and their response mechanisms were analyzed. Following a 24 h treatment with rotenone, the average LC50 rotenone values in A. glycines specimens from field populations A and B, and a laboratory population were 4.39, 4.61, and 4.03 mg/L, respectively. The degree of changes in the kinase expression activity of endogenous substances also differed, which indicated a difference in the response of A. glycines specimens from varying habitats to LC50 rotenone stress. The content of endogenous substances, detoxifying enzymes, and metabolic enzymes, except for that of free amino acids, changed significantly in all populations treated with rotenone at LC50 compared with that in the control (P < 0.05). The decrease in protein and trehalose content, and the obstruction of cholesterol transportation owing to decreased feeding in stressed individuals were the causes of A. glycines death after rotenone treatment. Aphis glycines resistance to rotenone may be related to cytochrome P450 expression."
https://openalex.org/W3033864969,"Our lives changed tracks the day our daughter was born. My wife and I felt settled in the United Kingdom—we'd even bought a house 6 months earlier—but the arrival of our daughter forced a moment of reflection. We wondered whether we should move back to our native Brazil. I remember looking down at our newborn baby and thinking about how different her life would be there. In our native country, we'd be closer to our family and culture. But in the United Kingdom, I had the funding and lab resources I needed for my costly and highly specialized research program. Would such a move sink my career?



> “I had been away from my extended family and my culture for too long.” 

We had left Brazil 10 years earlier so that I could spend the last year of my Ph.D. program in France. Meanwhile, my wife started a Ph.D. in the United Kingdom. We maintained a long-distance relationship for the first few years. But by the time our daughter was born, we'd settled down in the same location; I had a research assistant position and my wife had a postdoc.

I was in an amazing scientific environment, working next to Nobel laureates. But I had been away from my extended family and my culture for too long. I missed acai, acaraje, pao de queijo, samba, bossa nova, capoeira, Brazilian jujitsu, and sunny skies. I worried that I might never return to Brazil.

My wife missed our homeland as well. As a mathematician, it was also easier for her to imagine doing her work in Brazil; unlike me, she didn't need fancy lab equipment and expensive reagents. So with a newborn baby at home, we started to ask ourselves whether a move was in order.

Several events over the next few months nudged us further in the same direction. We heard that new professor positions had opened up at a university in our hometown, in departments that matched both of our research programs. Then, a few weeks later, I received a call in the wee hours of the morning from my brother, who told me that our father had passed away. The great happiness I had felt about my daughter's birth suddenly gave way to a deep sadness. I felt that I was losing precious time with my loved ones.

After that, we had no doubt it was the right time to return to Brazil. We applied for the professorships and both received offers. It felt like our personal and professional lives were falling into place.

It wasn't easy getting started with my research in Brazil, however. I didn't receive any startup funding for my lab, so I couldn't recruit grad students or hire postdocs. I was able to perform a few experiments myself thanks to reagents I had brought with me from my lab in the United Kingdom, as well as equipment I shared with other professors. Eventually, I secured Brazilian funding, which allowed me to form a team of bright undergraduate and graduate students and buy reagents and lab equipment on my own.

Nine years later, I still haven't been able to perform the kind of experiments that U.K. funding would have allowed. And the antiscience views of the current Brazilian government have added to my worries about my squeezed budget.

But looking back, I'm happy that my wife and I put our personal well-being first and made the decision to move back to our home country. We've been able to have big meals with our extended family on weekends. We had a second child, and our kids are growing up close to their cousins who are around the same age. And I was able to resume Brazilian jujitsu training, which I hadn't been able to do during my years abroad.

We are living the lives we wanted to live—working on rewarding research while staying true to what we feel is best for ourselves and for our family. Any scientist from a developing country who is considering a move home has to weigh the pros and cons, and the situation will be different for everyone. But for us, returning home was worth the costs."
