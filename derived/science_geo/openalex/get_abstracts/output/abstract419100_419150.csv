https://openalex.org/W2003842905,"Switching to a glycolytic metabolism is a rapid adaptation of tumor cells to hypoxia. Although this metabolic conversion may primarily represent a rescue pathway to meet the bioenergetic and biosynthetic demands of proliferating tumor cells, it also creates a gradient of lactate that mirrors the gradient of oxygen in tumors. More than a metabolic waste, the lactate anion is known to participate to cancer aggressiveness, in part through activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) pathway in tumor cells. Whether lactate may also directly favor HIF-1 activation in endothelial cells (ECs) thereby offering a new druggable option to block angiogenesis is however an unanswered question. In this study, we therefore focused on the role in ECs of monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) that we previously identified to be the main facilitator of lactate uptake in cancer cells. We found that blockade of lactate influx into ECs led to inhibition of HIF-1-dependent angiogenesis. Our demonstration is based on the unprecedented characterization of lactate-induced HIF-1 activation in normoxic ECs and the consecutive increase in vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) expression. Furthermore, using a variety of functional assays including endothelial cell migration and tubulogenesis together with in vivo imaging of tumor angiogenesis through intravital microscopy and immunohistochemistry, we documented that MCT1 blockers could act as bona fide HIF-1 inhibitors leading to anti-angiogenic effects. Together with the previous demonstration of MCT1 being a key regulator of lactate exchange between tumor cells, the current study identifies MCT1 inhibition as a therapeutic modality combining antimetabolic and anti-angiogenic activities."
https://openalex.org/W2023447262,"Chytridiomycosis, a disease caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), is driving amphibian declines and extinctions in protected areas globally. The introduction of invasive reservoir species has been implicated in the spread of Bd but does not explain the appearance of the pathogen in remote protected areas. In the high elevation (>1500 m) Sierra Nevada of California, the native Pacific chorus frog, Pseudacris regilla, appears unaffected by chytridiomycosis while sympatric species experience catastrophic declines. We investigated whether P. regilla is a reservoir of Bd by comparing habitat occupancy before and after a major Bd outbreak and measuring infection in P. regilla in the field, monitoring susceptibility of P. regilla to Bd in the laboratory, examining tissues with histology to determine patterns of infection, and using an innovative soak technique to determine individual output of Bd zoospores in water. Pseudacris regilla persists at 100% of sites where a sympatric species has been extirpated from 72% in synchrony with a wave of Bd. In the laboratory, P. regilla carried loads of Bd as much as an order of magnitude higher than loads found lethal to sympatric species. Histology shows heavy Bd infection in patchy areas next to normal skin, a possible mechanism for tolerance. The soak technique was 77.8% effective at detecting Bd in water and showed an average output of 68 zoospores per minute per individual. The results of this study suggest P. regilla should act as a Bd reservoir and provide evidence of a tolerance mechanism in a reservoir species."
https://openalex.org/W2036256897,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), consisting of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (UC), results in substantial morbidity and is difficult to treat. New strategies for adjunct therapies are needed. One candidate is the semi-essential amino acid, L-arginine (L-Arg), a complementary medicine purported to be an enhancer of immunity and vitality in the lay media. Using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) as a murine colonic injury and repair model with similarities to human UC, we assessed the effect of L-Arg, as DSS induced increases in colonic expression of the y(+) cationic amino acid transporter 2 (CAT2) and L-Arg uptake. L-Arg supplementation improved the clinical parameters of survival, body weight loss, and colon weight, and reduced colonic permeability and the number of myeloperoxidase-positive neutrophils in DSS colitis. Luminex-based multi-analyte profiling demonstrated that there was a marked reduction in proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression with L-Arg treatment. Genomic analysis by microarray demonstrated that DSS-treated mice supplemented with L-Arg clustered more closely with mice not exposed to DSS than to those receiving DSS alone, and revealed that multiple genes that were upregulated or downregulated with DSS alone exhibited normalization of expression with L-Arg supplementation. Additionally, L-Arg treatment of mice with DSS colitis resulted in increased ex vivo migration of colonic epithelial cells, suggestive of increased capacity for wound repair. Because CAT2 induction was sustained during L-Arg treatment and inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase (iNOS) requires uptake of L-Arg for generation of NO, we tested the effect of L-Arg in iNOS(-/-) mice and found that its benefits in DSS colitis were eliminated. These preclinical studies indicate that L-Arg supplementation could be a potential therapy for IBD, and that one mechanism of action may be functional enhancement of iNOS activity."
https://openalex.org/W2089041604,"Primary cilia, solitary microtubule-based structures that grow from the centriole and extend into the extracellular space, have increasingly been implicated as sensors of a variety of biochemical and biophysical signals. Mutations in primary cilium-related genes have been linked to a number of rare developmental disorders as well as dysregulation of cell proliferation. We propose that primary cilia are also important in mechanically regulated bone formation in adults and that their malfunction could play a role in complex multi-factorial bone diseases, such as osteoporosis. In this study, we generated mice with an osteoblast- and osteocyte-specific knockout of Kif3a, a subunit of the kinesin II intraflagellar transport (IFT) protein; IFT is required for primary cilia formation, maintenance, and function. These Colα1(I) 2.3-Cre;Kif3a(fl/fl) mice exhibited no obvious morphological skeletal abnormalities. Skeletally mature Colα1(I) 2.3-Cre;Kif3a(fl/fl) and control mice were exposed to 3 consecutive days of cyclic axial ulna loading, which resulted in a significant increase in bone formation in both the conditional knockouts and controls. However, Colα1(I) 2.3-Cre;Kif3a(fl/fl) mice did exhibit decreased formation of new bone in response to mechanical ulnar loading compared to control mice. These results suggest that primary cilia act as cellular mechanosensors in bone and that their function may be critical for the regulation of bone physiology due to mechanical loading in adults."
https://openalex.org/W1980501703,"Background There have been few studies that have examined associations between access to health care and child health outcomes in remote populations most in need of health services. This study assessed the effect of travel time and distance to health facilities on mortality in children under five years in a remote area of rural north-western Ethiopia. Methods and Findings This study involved a randomly selected cross sectional survey of 2,058 households. Data were collected during home visits to all resident women of reproductive age (15–49 years). A geographic information system (GIS) was used to map all households and the only health centre in the district. The analysis was restricted to 2,206 rural children who were under the age of five years during the five years before the survey. Data were analysed using random effects Poisson regression. 90.4% (1,996/2,206) of children lived more than 1.5 hours walk from the health centre. Children who lived ≥1.5 hrs from the health centre had a two to three fold greater risk of death than children who lived <1.5 hours from the health centre (children with travel time 1.5–<2.5 hrs adjusted relative risk [adjRR] 2.3[0.95–5.6], travel time 2.5–<3.5 hrs adjRR 3.1[1.3–7.4] and travel time 3.5–<6.5 hrs adjRR 2.5[1.1–6.2]). Conclusion Distance to a health centre had a marked influence on under five mortality in a poor, rural, remote area of Ethiopia. This study provides important information for policy makers on the likely impact of new health centres and their most effective location in remote areas."
https://openalex.org/W2048630232,"The fungus C. albicans uses adhesins to interact with human epithelial surfaces in the processes of colonization and pathogenesis. The C. albicans ALS (agglutinin-like sequence) gene family encodes eight large cell-surface glycoproteins (Als1-Als7 and Als9) that have adhesive function. This study utilized C. albicans Δals mutant strains to investigate the role of the Als family in oral epithelial cell adhesion and damage, cytokine induction and activation of a MAPK-based (MKP1/c-Fos) signaling pathway that discriminates between yeast and hyphae. Of the eight Δals mutants tested, only the Δals3 strain showed significant reductions in oral epithelial cell adhesion and damage, and cytokine production. High fungal:epithelial cell multiplicities of infection were able to rescue the cell damage and cytokine production phenotypes, demonstrating the importance of fungal burden in mucosal infections. Despite its adhesion, damage and cytokine induction phenotypes, the Δals3 strain induced MKP1 phosphorylation and c-Fos production to a similar extent as control cells. Our data demonstrate that Als3 is involved directly in epithelial adhesion but indirectly in cell damage and cytokine induction, and is not the factor targeted by oral epithelial cells to discriminate between the yeast and hyphal form of C. albicans."
https://openalex.org/W1988450779,"Anti-mitotic agents such as paclitaxel and docetaxel are widely used for the treatment of breast, ovarian and lung cancers. Although paclitaxel induces apoptosis, this drug also modulates autophagy. How autophagy affects paclitaxel activity, is unclear. We discovered that paclitaxel inhibited autophagy through two distinct mechanisms dependent on cell cycle stage. In mitotic cells, paclitaxel blocked activation of the class III phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase, Vps34, a critical initiator of autophagosome formation. In non-mitotic paclitaxel-treated cells, autophagosomes were generated but their movement and maturation was inhibited. Chemically or genetically blocking autophagosome formation diminished paclitaxel-induced cell death suggesting that autophagosome accumulation sensitized cells to paclitaxel toxicity. In line with these observations, we identified that primary breast tumors that expressed diminished levels of autophagy-initiating genes were resistant to taxane therapy, identifying possible mechanisms and prognostic markers of clinical chemotherapeutic resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2030669063,"Rac1b, an alternative splice form of Rac1, has been previously shown to be upregulated in colon and breast cancer cells, suggesting an oncogenic role for Rac1b in these cancers. Our analysis of NSCLC tumor and matched normal tissue samples indicates Rac1b is upregulated in a significant fraction of lung tumors in correlation with mutational status of K-ras. To directly assess the oncogenic potential of Rac1b in vivo, we employed a mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma, in which the expression of Rac1b can be conditionally activated specifically in the lung. Although expression of Rac1b alone is insufficient to drive tumor initiation, the expression of Rac1b synergizes with an oncogenic allele of K-ras resulting in increased cellular proliferation and accelerated tumor growth. Finally, we show that in contrast to our previous findings demonstrating a requirement for Rac1 in K-ras-driven cell proliferation, Rac1b is not required in this context. Given the partially overlapping spectrum of downstream effectors regulated by Rac1 and Rac1b, our findings further delineate the signaling pathways downstream of Rac1 that are required for K-ras driven tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2086882575,"Background To date, only a small portion of the genetic variation for primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), the major type of glaucoma, has been elucidated. Methods and Principal Findings We examined our two data sets of the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) derived from a total of 2,219 Japanese subjects. First, we performed a GWAS by analyzing 653,519 autosomal common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 833 POAG patients and 686 controls. As a result, five variants that passed the Bonferroni correction were identified in CDKN2B-AS1 on chromosome 9p21.3, which was already reported to be a significant locus in the Caucasian population. Moreover, we combined the data set with our previous GWAS data set derived from 411 POAG patients and 289 controls by the Mantel-Haenszel test, and all of the combined variants showed stronger association with POAG (P<5.8×10−10). We then subdivided the case groups into two subtypes based on the value of intraocular pressure (IOP)—POAG with high IOP (high pressure glaucoma, HPG) and that with normal IOP (normal pressure glaucoma, NPG)—and performed the GWAS using the two data sets, as the prevalence of NPG in Japanese is much higher than in Caucasians. The results suggested that the variants from the same CDKN2B-AS1 locus were likely to be significant for NPG patients. Conclusions and Significance In this study, we successfully identified POAG-associated variants in the CDKN2B-AS1 locus using a Japanese population, i.e., variants originally reported as being associated with the Caucasian population. Although we cannot rule out that the significance could be due to the differences in sample size between HPG and NPG, the variants could be associated specifically with the vulnerability of the optic nerve to IOP, which is useful for investigating the etiology of glaucoma."
https://openalex.org/W2025328449,"Both genetic and environmental factors are implicated in type 1 diabetes (T1D). Because environmental factors can trigger epigenetic changes, we hypothesized that variations in histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) at the promoter/enhancer regions of T1D susceptible genes may be associated with T1D. We therefore evaluated histone PTM variations at known T1D susceptible genes in blood cells from T1D patients versus healthy nondiabetic controls, and explored their connections to T1D. We used the chromatin immunoprecipitation-linked to microarray approach to profile key histone PTMs, including H3-lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), H3K27me3, H3K9me3, H3K9 acetylation (H3K9Ac), and H4K16Ac at genes within the T1D susceptible loci in lymphocytes, and H3K4me3, H3K9me2, H3K9Ac, and H4K16Ac at the insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 1 region in monocytes of T1D patients and healthy controls separately. We screened for potential variations in histone PTMs using computational methods to compare datasets from T1D and controls. Interestingly, we observed marked variations in H3K9Ac levels at the upstream regions of HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1 within the insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 1 locus in T1D monocytes relative to controls. Additional experiments with THP-1 monocytes demonstrated increased expression of HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1 in response to interferon-γ and TNF-α treatment that were accompanied by changes in H3K9Ac at the same promoter regions as that seen in the patient monocytes. These results suggest that the H3K9Ac status of HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1, two genes highly associated with T1D, may be relevant to their regulation and transcriptional response toward external stimuli. Thus, the promoter/enhancer architecture and chromatin status of key susceptible loci could be important determinants in their functional association to T1D susceptibility.

Extensive studies have provided a wealth of evidence implicating both genetic and environment factors in the etiology of T1D (4.Todd J.A.

Multiple regions of the genome, known as T1D susceptible gene loci, have been clearly linked to the risk of T1D through extensive linkage and association studies (5.Nerup J. Platz P. Andersen O.O.

Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 1 (IDDM1) in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region in chromosome 6 is the prime susceptibility locus, providing up to 50% of the risk of inheritable incidence (8.Aly T.A.

Hagopian W. Environmental factors in the development of type 1 diabetes.Rev. Endocr. Metab. Dis. 2006; 7: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and disease incidence continues to increase, which suggests a significant contribution from environmental factors. Indeed, many studies have uncovered key links between T1D and environmental factors such as infection, diet, perinatal and prenatal nutrition (10.Peng H. Hagopian W.

Recent clinical trials, such as TEDDY (The Environmental Determinants in Diabetes of the Young), have aimed to identify the specific environmental triggers of T1D. It is plausible that such factors may regulate T1D in a gene-environment interaction or epigenetic manner and, based on our current understanding of the disease, T1D susceptible genes and genes involved in autoimmunity are logically the best candidate genes targeted by environmental factors. type 1 diabetes post-translational modification immunoprecipitation quantitative PCR transcription start site major histocompatibility complex single nucleotide polymorphism human leukocyte antigen insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 1 H3-lysine 4 methylation H3-lysine 9 acetylation genome-wide association study false discovery rate. Epigenetic mechanisms in chromatin are increasingly recognized to be a molecular link between genes and the environment. Notably, in eukaryotic cells, chromatin structure can be affected by environmental factors such as diet, chemicals, and pathogens (14.Jirtle R.L. Skinner M.K. Environmental epigenomics and disease susceptibility.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1867) Google Scholar). Nucleosome, the basic repeat unit of chromatin, consists of two copies each of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 wrapped by 147 bp of DNA (15.Klug A. Rhodes D. Smith J. Finch J.T. Thomas J.O. A low resolution structure for the histone core of the nucleosome.Nature. 1980; 287: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Post-translational modifications (PTMs) at the N-terminal amino acids of histones play an essential role in modifying chromatin structure and, along with DNA methylation, form an epigenetic layer that can modulate gene transcription (16.Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. The language of covalent histone modifications.Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6585) Google Scholar, 17.Zhang Y. Reinberg D.

Genet. 2009; 43: 559-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Epigenetics usually refers to heritable changes, including those conferred mitotically or meiotically, which occur without changes in the DNA sequence. More recently the definition has been refined to include the structural adaptation of chromosomal regions (20.Bird A. Perceptions of epigenetics.Nature. 2007; 447: 396-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (2048) Google Scholar). Thus, both DNA methylation and histone PTMs can work together to control epigenetic transmission (21.Berger S.L. Kouzarides T. Shiekhattar R. Shilatifard A. An operational definition of epigenetics.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 781-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). Importantly, the chromatin status of gene promoters plays a role in determining how the gene responds to various stimuli. Histone PTMs have varying effects on gene expression depending on the position, type of modification (acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, or ubiquitylation), and also the degree of methylation (mono-, di-, or tri-) through recognition by key chromatin modifying proteins (16.Strahl B.D.

In general, histone H3-lysine 4-trimethylation (H3K4me3) and H3K9-acetylation (H3K9Ac) are associated with promoters and active genes, whereas H3K9me2, H3K9me3, and H3K27me3 are generally associated with repressed genes, and H4K16Ac may control chromatin structure through interactions with key proteins (16.Strahl B.D.

The results revealed a significant increase in H3K9me2 in a subset of genes in lymphocytes of the T1D cohort. Pathway analyses showed that these methylated genes were part of key biological networks and canonical pathways relevant to the etiology of T1D and its complications. The study provided evidence of a link between T1D and altered histone methylation of key diabetes-related genes, including those associated with inflammation and autoimmunity. Interestingly, CTLA4, a known T1D susceptibility gene, was found to depict differential H3K9me2 methylation in T1D lymphocytes versus normal (28.Miao F. Smith D.D. Zhang L. Min A. Feng W.

The massive datasets generated by ChIP-array and other high throughput epigenome profiling approaches have posed enormous challenges for subsequent data analyses, bioinformatics, and statistics as well as functional correlations.

A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) confirmed and extended the results from previous linkage and association studies and defined 41 genome loci as T1D susceptible regions (34.Barrett J.C.

We hypothesized that the chromatin near key T1D-susceptible genes might exhibit specific histone PTM variations, and that these PTM variations may be related to the pathogenesis of T1D. Such events could uncover a cross-talk between genetics and epigenetics to significantly enhance our understanding of T1D. Thus, to gain new insights into these T1D susceptible genes (34.Barrett J.C.

Genome-wide association study and meta-analysis find that over 40 loci affect risk of type 1 diabetes.Nat. Genet. 2009; 41: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar), we used the ChIP-array approach to profile and compare histone PTMs at T1D susceptible genes in lymphocyte and monocyte cells obtained from the peripheral blood of T1D individuals versus normal controls. To evaluate the changes in chromatin status at these T1D relevant regions of the genome, we first mapped key histone PTMs, including histone H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H3K9me3, H3K9Ac, and H4K16Ac in lymphocytes, and H3K4me3, H3K9me2, H3K9Ac, and H4K16Ac in monocytes from T1D patients versus healthy controls. We then examined potential variations in these histone PTMs around some 350 genes within these T1D susceptible regions, including the well characterized IDDM1 region. Noticeable, data analyses revealed the presence of significant variations in histone H3K9Ac at the promoter (enhancer) regions of HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1 genes within IDDM1 in monocytes between T1D patients and healthy controls. Furthermore, experiments in THP-1 monocytes demonstrated increases in H3K9Ac at the same promoter regions as that seen in the patient monocytes when HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1 expressions were stimulated by interferon-γ and TNF-α treatment of the THP-1 cells, suggesting that the H3K9Ac variations observed in vivo at these regions might be associated with gene expression. All studies were performed according to a protocol approved by the City of Hope Institutional Review Board. Written informed consents were obtained from all blood donors (T1D (n = 9) and healthy controls (n = 7)). Patient demographics have been previously described (28.Miao F. Smith D.D. Zhang L. Min A. Feng W. Natarajan R. Lymphocytes from patients with type 1 diabetes display a distinct profile of chromatin histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation. An epigenetic study in diabetes.Diabetes. 2008; 57: 3189-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). There were no statistically significant differences in age or gender between the two groups. Blood monocyte and lymphocyte fractions were prepared as described (28.Miao F. Smith D.D. Zhang L. Min A. Feng W. Natarajan R.

Peripheral blood monocytes and lymphocytes were freshly isolated from individual normal and T1D subjects and then cross-linked in 1% formaldehyde, sonicated to shear DNA, and immunoprecipitations (IP) performed with antibodies to histone PTMs. IP with no antibody was used as the input control. DNA precipitates were washed, eluted, and cross-links were reversed. Small aliquots of DNA before IP and the ChIP-enriched DNA were saved for follow-up validations of ChIP-chip data by ChIP-qPCRs. The remaining ChIP-enriched DNA and no antibody input control were amplified and purified. The amplified DNA samples were separately pooled from nine T1D or from seven normal control samples. These two groups were designated as T1D and normals in this study, and used for microarray hybridization as described (25.Miao F. Wu X. Zhang L. Yuan Y.C. Riggs A.D. Natarajan R.

ChIP-array experiments were performed with human 385K RefSeq promoter tiling arrays (for lymphocyte samples) at the Roche NimbleGen Core, and with chromosome 6 tiling arrays (NimbleGen human whole genome array 15 of 38) (for monocyte samples) at our Functional Genomics Core. The following antibodies were used for ChIPs: anti-histone H3K4me3 (Millipore 07-473), H3K9me3 (Abcam ab8898); H3K9me2 (Millipore 07-441), H3K27me3 (Millipore 07-449), H3K9Ac (Millipore 06-942), and H4K16Ac (Millipore 06-762). Human lymphocytes were prepared from four nondiabetic volunteers. RNAs were extracted using Qiagen RNeasy mini kits following the manufacturer's instructions. Biotinylated single strand cDNA was generated and subjected to expression profiling with Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0ST arrays followed by data analyses and conversion into expression measurements using Expression Console version 1.1.1 from Affymetrix. The genes located in T1D susceptible human loci defined by Ensembl version 54 were from www.t1dbase.org. They were subsequently converted to NCBI Accession codes using BioMart. Transcripts not covered by either the Affymetrix GeneChip® Human Gene 1.0 ST Array or whose promoter regions (−2000 to +500 bp relative to TSS) were not covered by the Nimblegen 385K Refseq Promoter Array were filtered out. Redundant transcripts were finally removed by retaining only one transcript among those who shared the same gene symbol and shared the same transcription start site. The gene list is provided in supplemental Table S1. Gene promoter region (−2000 to 500 bp relative to transcript start site, TSS) of genes covered by both gene expression array and tiling array was divided into 25 nonoverlapping 100-bp regions (finest resolution available), each represented by a positional bin. For each mark, median-shifted log2-transformed enrichment ratios of the microarray probes falling in each promoter region of the transcript were retrieved, aligned, and assigned to the represented bin based on their positions relative to TSS. A data matrix with each row representing one transcript and 25 columns corresponding to the 25 bins was created. After removing redundant genes by retaining one transcript among those who share the same gene symbol and same TSS, the rows of the matrix are ordered by their corresponding genes' expression and visualized by Java TreeView version 1.1.3 with each row representing enrichment state of one promoter of the RefSeq gene. For each histone PTM, the log2 ratio data from T1D patients or healthy controls' pooled lymphocytes were quantile normalized. The histone PTM-enriched regions (also called peaks, where log2 ratios of at least 5 continuous probes are ≥1.5 and peak p values are ≤0.05) in T1D patients and healthy individuals were then identified separately using TAMAL software (32.Barski A. Cuddapah S. Cui K. Roh T.Y. Schones D.E. Wang Z. Wei G. Chepelev I. Zhao K. High-resolution profiling of histone methylations in the human genome.Cell. 2007; 129: 823-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar). Hyper peaks (or T1D specific enriched regions) were subsequently selected from the peaks identified in the T1D sample by comparing the median log2 ratio of all the probes located inside the peak regions in the T1D sample with those in the healthy sample. FDR was calculated for each peak based on the difference median log2 ratio in T1D versus healthy samples, and the peaks with FDR < 5% were considered as hyper peaks, namely specific enriched regions that can be identified in T1D lymphocytes but not found at the same genomic location in normal lymphocytes. On the other hand, hypo peak refers to the peaks specific in healthy samples, and identified using similar criteria, with FDR of the difference median log2 ratio in healthy samples versus T1D less than 5%. The identified hyper/hypo peaks were further screened to identify those located on the promoters (−2 kb to +500 bp relative to TSS) of genes in T1D susceptible loci for lymphocyte samples. Monocyte data sets were similarly analyzed. Because different PTMs have different enrichment levels, the tiling-array data distribution for each PTM mark is different. Thus, it is necessary to define different cutoffs of mean log2 r"
https://openalex.org/W2086594627,"Little is known about metastatic pathways that are specific to the lung rather than other organs. We previously showed that antioxidant proteins such as peroxiredoxins were specifically upregulated in lung metastatic breast cancer cells. We hypothesize that cancer cells that live under aerobic conditions, as might be the case in lungs, protect themselves against the damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). To examine this hypothesis, we studied the role of peroxiredoxin-2 (PRDX2) in lung vs bone metastasis formation. A metastatic variant of MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells that specifically metastasize to lungs (435-L3) was transduced with short hairpin RNAs to specifically silence PRDX2. Conversely, a bone metastatic variant of MDA-MB-231 cells (BO2) was stably transfected to overexpress PRDX2. The 435-L3 cells silenced for PRDX2 were significantly more sensitive to H2O2-induced oxidative stress than the parental and scrambled transfected cells. BO2/PRDX2 cells produced less ROS than BO2/green fluorescent protein control cells under oxidative stress. Moreover, PRDX2 knockdown inhibited the growth of 435-L3 cells in the lungs, whereas lymph node metastasis remained unaffected. In contrast, PRDX2 overexpression in bone metastatic BO2 breast cancer cells led to drastic inhibition of the skeletal tumor burden and reduction of bone destruction. Furthermore, PRDX2 expression in breast cancer cells was associated with a glucose-dependent phenotype, different from bone metastatic cells. Overall, our results strongly suggest that PRDX2 is a targetable ‘metabolic adaptor’ driver protein implicated in the selective growth of metastatic cells in the lungs by protecting them against oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W1979099115,"Functional cross talk between insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) system and estrogen signaling has been largely reported, although the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. As GPR30/GPER mediates rapid cell responses to estrogens, we evaluated the potential of IGF-I to regulate GPER expression and function in estrogen receptor (ER)α-positive breast (MCF-7) and endometrial (Ishikawa) cancer cells. We found that IGF-I transactivates the GPER promoter sequence and upregulates GPER mRNA and protein levels in both cells types. Similar data were found, at least in part, in carcinoma-associated fibroblasts. The upregulation of GPER expression by IGF-I involved the IGF-IR/PKCδ/ERK/c-fos/AP1 transduction pathway and required ERα, as ascertained by specific pharmacological inhibitors and gene-silencing. In both MCF-7 and Ishikawa cancer cells, the IGF-I-dependent cell migration required GPER and its main target gene CTGF, whereas the IGF-I-induced proliferation required both GPER and cyclin D1. Our data demonstrate that the IGF-I system regulates GPER expression and function, triggering the activation of a signaling network that leads to the migration and proliferation of cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2008390728,"Musashi1 (MSI1) is an RNA-binding protein that plays critical roles in nervous-system development and stem-cell self-renewal. Here, we examined its role in the progression of glioma. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-based MSI1-knock down (KD) in glioblastoma and medulloblastoma cells resulted in a significantly lower number of self renewing colony on day 30 (a 65% reduction), compared with non-silencing shRNA-treated control cells, indicative of an inhibitory effect of MSI1-KD on tumor cell growth and survival. Immunocytochemical staining of the MSI1-KD glioblastoma cells indicated that they ectopically expressed metaphase markers. In addition, a 2.2-fold increase in the number of MSI1-KD cells in the G2/M phase was observed. Thus, MSI1-KD caused the prolongation of mitosis and reduced the cell survival, although the expression of activated Caspase-3 was unaltered. We further showed that MSI1-KD glioblastoma cells xenografted into the brains of NOD/SCID mice formed tumors that were 96.6% smaller, as measured by a bioluminescence imaging system (BLI), than non-KD cells, and the host survival was longer (49.3±6.1 days vs. 33.6±3.6 days; P<0.01). These findings and other cell biological analyses suggested that the reduction of MSI1 in glioma cells prolonged the cell cycle by inducing the accumulation of Cyclin B1. Furthermore, MSI1-KD reduced the activities of the Notch and PI3 kinase-Akt signaling pathways, through the up-regulation of Numb and PTEN, respectively. Exposure of glioma cells to chemical inhibitors of these pathways reduced the number of spheres and living cells, as did MSI1-KD. These results suggest that MSI1 increases the growth and/or survival of certain types of glioma cells by promoting the activation of both Notch and PI3 kinase/Akt signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2020976545,"Gain-of-function mutations in KRAS and BRAF genes are found in up to 50% of colorectal cancers. These mutations result in the activation of the BRAF/MEK signaling pathway culminating in the stimulation of ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinases. Upon activation, ERK1/2 translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. This process has been shown to be required for the induction of many cellular responses, although the molecular mechanisms regulating ERK nuclear function, especially under oncogenic stimulation, remain to be explored. Herein, we examined the spatiotemporal regulation of ERK1/2 activity upon oncogenic activation of KRAS(G12V) and BRAF(V600E) in normal intestinal epithelial crypt cells (IECs). Results demonstrate that expression of these oncogenes markedly stimulated ERK1/2 activities and morphologically transformed IECs. Importantly however, ERK phosphorylation was not observed in the nucleus, but restricted to the cytoplasm of KRAS(G12V)- and BRAF(V600E)-transformed IECs. The absence of nuclear ERK phosphorylation was due to a vanadate-sensitive phosphatase activity. Nuclear ERK dephosphorylation was found to be tightly correlated with the rapid expression of DUSP4 phosphatase induced in an MEK-dependent manner. In addition, MEK-dependent phosphorylation of T361, T363, S390 and S395 residues highly stabilized DUSP4 protein. Finally, in human colorectal cancer cells, ERK1/2 activities were also confined to the cytoplasm and treatment with pervanadate reactivated ERK1/2 in the nucleus. Accordingly, DUSP4 mRNAs were found to be highly expressed, in an MEK-dependent manner, in all colorectal cancer cells analyzed. These findings indicate that DUSP4 functions as part of a negative feedback mechanism in the control of the duration and magnitude of nuclear ERK activation during intestinal tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2084996794,"Lung cancer is among the most lethal malignancies with a high metastasis and recurrence rate. Recent studies indicate that tumors contain a subset of stem-like cancer cells that possess certain stem cell properties. Herein, we used Hoechst 33342 dye efflux assay and flow cytometry to isolate and characterize the side population (SP) cells from human lung cancer cell line NCI-H460 (H460). We show that the H460 SP cells harbor stem-like cells as they can readily form anchorage-independent floating spheres, possess great proliferative potential, and exhibit enhanced tumorigenicity. Importantly, the H460 SP cells were able to self-renew both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we show that the H460 SP cells preferentially express ABCG2 as well as SMO, a critical mediator of the Hedgehog (HH) signaling, which seems to play an important role in H460 lung cancer cells as its blockage using Cyclopamine greatly inhibits cell-cycle progression. Collectively, our results lend further support to the existence of lung cancer stem cells and also implicate HH signaling in regulating large-cell lung cancer (stem) cells."
https://openalex.org/W1996894304,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a central regulator of tumor progression in human cancers. Cetuximab is an anti-EGFR antibody that has been approved for use in oncology. Previously we investigated mechanisms of resistance to cetuximab using a model derived from the non-small cell lung cancer line NCI-H226. We demonstrated that cetuximab-resistant clones (Ctx(R)) had increased nuclear localization of the EGFR. This process was mediated by Src family kinases (SFKs), and nuclear EGFR had a role in resistance to cetuximab. To better understand SFK-mediated nuclear translocation of EGFR, we investigated which SFK member(s) controlled this process as well as the EGFR tyrosine residues that are involved. Analyses of mRNA and protein expression indicated upregulation of the SFK members Yes (v-Yes-1 yamaguchi sarcoma viral oncogene) and Lyn (v-yes-1 Yamaguchi sarcoma viral-related oncogene homolog) in all Ctx(R) clones. Further, immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that EGFR interacts with Yes and Lyn in Ctx(R) clones, but not in cetuximab-sensitive (Ctx(S)) parental cells. Using RNAi interference, we found that knockdown of either Yes or Lyn led to loss of EGFR translocation to the nucleus. Conversely, overexpression of Yes or Lyn in low nuclear EGFR-expressing Ctx(S) parental cells led to increased nuclear EGFR. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays confirmed nuclear EGFR complexes associated with the promoter of the known EGFR target genes B-Myb and iNOS. Further, all Ctx(R) clones exhibited upregulation of B-Myb and iNOS at the mRNA and protein levels. siRNAs directed at Yes or Lyn led to decreased binding of EGFR complexes to the B-Myb and iNOS promoters based on ChIP analyses. SFKs have been shown to phosphorylate EGFR on tyrosines 845 and 1101 (Y845 and Y1101), and mutation of Y1101, but not Y845, impaired nuclear entry of the EGFR. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that Yes and Lyn phosphorylate EGFR at Y1101, which influences EGFR nuclear translocation in this model of cetuximab resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2052287702,"Cell cycle checkpoints ensure genome integrity and are frequently compromised in human cancers. A therapeutic strategy being explored takes advantage of checkpoint defects in p53-deficient tumors in order to sensitize them to DNA-damaging agents by eliminating Chk1-mediated checkpoint responses. Using mouse models, we demonstrated that p21 is a key determinant of how cells respond to the combination of DNA damage and Chk1 inhibition (combination therapy) in normal cells as well as in tumors. Loss of p21 sensitized normal cells to the combination therapy much more than did p53 loss and the enhanced lethality was partially blocked by CDK inhibition. In addition, basal pools of p21 (p53 independent) provided p53 null cells with protection from the combination therapy. Our results uncover a novel p53-independent function for p21 in protecting cells from the lethal effects of DNA damage followed by Chk1 inhibition. As p21 levels are low in a significant fraction of colorectal tumors, they are predicted to be particularly sensitive to the combination therapy. Results reported in this study support this prediction."

However, its function in relation to key chondrogenic factor Sox9 and onset of chondrogenesis during endochondral ossification is poorly understood. We hypothesized that the early onset of chondrogenic differentiation is initiated by transient NF-κB/p65 signaling.The role of NF-κB/p65 in early chondrogenesis was investigated in different in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo endochondral models: ATDC5 cells, hBMSCs, chicken periosteal explants and growth plates of 6 weeks old mice. NF-κB/p65 activation was manipulated using pharmacological inhibitors, RNAi and activating agents. Gene expression and protein expression analysis, and (immuno)histochemical stainings were employed to determine the role of NF-κB/p65 in the chondrogenic phase of endochondral development. Our data show that chondrogenic differentiation is facilitated by early transient activation of NF-κB/p65. NF-κB/p65-mediated signaling determines early expression of Sox9 and facilitates the subsequent chondrogenic differentiation programming by signaling through key chondrogenic pathways.The presented data demonstrate that NF-κB/p65 signaling, as well as its intensity and timing, represents one of the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of the chondrogenic developmental program of chondroprogenitor cells during endochondral ossification.

https://openalex.org/W2018507911,"α-Mangostin, isolated from the hulls of Garcinia mangostana L., was found to have in vitro cytotoxicity against 3T3-L1 cells as well as inhibiting fatty acid synthase (FAS, EC 2.3.1.85). Our studies showed that the cytotoxicity of α-mangostin with IC50 value of 20 µM was incomplicated in apoptotic events including increase of cell membrane permeability, nuclear chromatin condensation and mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) loss. This cytotoxicity was accompanied by the reduction of FAS activity in cells and could be rescued by 50 µM or 100 µM exogenous palmitic acids, which suggested that the apoptosis of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes induced by α-mangostin was via inhibition of FAS. Futhermore, α-mangostin could suppress intracellular lipid accumulation in the differentiating adipocytes and stimulated lipolysis in mature adipocytes, which was also related to its inhibition of FAS. In addition, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were more susceptible to the cytotoxic effect of α-mangostin than mature adipocytes. Further studies showed that α-mangostin inhibited FAS probably by stronger action on the ketoacyl synthase domain and weaker action on the acetyl/malonyl transferase domain. These findings suggested that α-mangostin might be useful for preventing or treating obesity."

https://openalex.org/W2074671217,"Background Rapamycin is an attractive approach for the treatment and prevention of HCC recurrence after liver transplantation. However, the objective response rates of rapamycin achieved with single-agent therapy were modest, supporting that rapamycin resistance is a frequently observed characteristic of many cancers. Some studies have been devoted to understanding the mechanisms of rapamycin resistance, however, the mechanisms are cell-type-dependent and studies on rapamycin resistance in HCC are extremely limited. Methodology/Principal Findings The anti-tumor sensitivity of rapamycin was modest in vitro and in vivo. In both human and rat HCC cells, rapamycin up-regulated the expression and phosphorylation of PDGFRβ in a time and dose-dependent manner as assessed by RT-PCR and western blot analysis. Using siRNA mediated knockdown of PDGFRβ, we confirmed that subsequent activation of AKT and ERK was PDGFRβ-dependent and compromised the anti-tumor activity of rapamycin. Then, blockade of this PDGFRβ-dependent feedback loop by sorafenib enhanced the anti-tumor sensitivity of rapamycin in vitro and in an immunocompetent orthotopic rat model of HCC. Conclusions Activation of PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathway through a PDGFRβ-dependent feedback loop compromises the anti-tumor activity of rapamycin in HCC, and blockade of this feedback loop by sorafenib is an attractive approach to improve the anti-tumor effect of rapamycin, particularly in preventing or treating HCC recurrence after liver transplantation."

To better understand the metabolic shift in cancer-induced cachexia, we studied the effects of enhanced oxidative capacity on muscle wasting using transgenic mice over-expressing Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma Co-activator-1α (PGC-1α) in skeletal muscle in a Lewis lung carcinoma-implanted model. Increased mitochondrial biogenesis was observed in the skeletal muscle of tumor-implanted mice. However, these increases did not prevent or reverse muscle wasting in mice harboring tumors. Moreover, tumor size was increased in muscle PGC-1α over-expressing mice. We found similar levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines in tumor-implanted animals, which was not affected by increased muscle expression of PGC-1α. Our data indicated that increased mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle is not sufficient to rescue tumor-associated, acute muscle loss, and could promote tumor growth, possibly through the release of myokines."
https://openalex.org/W2118641174,"Although activating mutations of PIK3CA are frequent in urothelial carcinoma (UC), no information is available on their specific effects in urothelial cells or the basis for the observed mutation spectrum, which has a large excess of helical domain mutations. We investigated the phenotypic and signaling consequences of hotspot and UC-specific rare PIK3CA mutations in immortalized normal human urothelial cells (NHUC) and mouse fibroblasts (NIH3T3). Our results indicate that in NHUC, rare mutant forms and all three hotspot mutant forms of PIK3CA can activate the PI3K/AKT pathway. The relative frequency at which helical domain and kinase domain mutations are found in UC is related to their potency in inducing signaling downstream of AKT and to the phenotypic effects induced in this cell type (E545K>E542K>H1047R). Helical domain mutations E542K and E545K conferred a significant proliferative advantage at confluence and under conditions of nutrient depletion, and increased cellular resistance to anoikis. Both helical and kinase domain mutants induced increased NHUC cell motility and migration towards a chemoattractant, though no significant differences were found between the mutant forms. In NIH3T3 cells, the kinase domain mutant H1047R induced high levels of AKT activation, but helical domain mutants were significantly less potent and this was reflected in their relative abilities to confer anchorage-independent growth. Our findings indicate that the effects of mutant PIK3CA are both cell type- and mutation-specific. Helical domain mutations in PIK3CA may confer a selective advantage in the urothelium in vivo by overcoming normal contact-mediated inhibitory signals and allowing proliferation in nutrient-limiting conditions. Mutant forms of PIK3CA may also stimulate intraepithelial cell movement, which could contribute to spread of cells within the urothelium."
https://openalex.org/W1987897013,"Transcriptional regulatory networks (TRN) control the underlying mechanisms behind cellular functions and they are defined by a set of core transcription factors regulating cascades of peripheral genes. Here we report SPI1, CEBPA, MNDA and IRF8 as core transcription factors of monocyte TRN and demonstrate functional inductions of phagocytosis, inflammatory response and chemotaxis activities in human dermal fibroblasts. The Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway analyses also revealed notable representation of genes involved in immune response and endocytosis in fibroblasts. Moreover, monocyte TRN-inducers triggered multiple monocyte-specific genes based on the transcription factor motif response analysis and suggest that complex cellular TRNs are uniquely amenable to elicit cell-specific functions in unrelated cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2095478476,"Fire has become an increasingly important disturbance event in south-western Amazonia. We conducted the first assessment of the ecological impacts of these wildfires in 2008, sampling forest structure and biodiversity along twelve 500 m transects in the Chico Mendes Extractive Reserve, Acre, Brazil. Six transects were placed in unburned forests and six were in forests that burned during a series of forest fires that occurred from August to October 2005. Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) calculations, based on Landsat reflectance data, indicate that all transects were similar prior to the fires. We sampled understorey and canopy vegetation, birds using both mist nets and point counts, coprophagous dung beetles and the leaf-litter ant fauna. Fire had limited influence upon either faunal or floral species richness or community structure responses, and stems <10 cm DBH were the only group to show highly significant (p = 0.001) community turnover in burned forests. Mean aboveground live biomass was statistically indistinguishable in the unburned and burned plots, although there was a significant increase in the total abundance of dead stems in burned plots. Comparisons with previous studies suggest that wildfires had much less effect upon forest structure and biodiversity in these south-western Amazonian forests than in central and eastern Amazonia, where most fire research has been undertaken to date. We discuss potential reasons for the apparent greater resilience of our study plots to wildfire, examining the role of fire intensity, bamboo dominance, background rates of disturbance, landscape and soil conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1982748233,"Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), a CC chemokine (CCL2), has been demonstrated to play important roles in atherosclerosis and becoming an important therapeutic target for atherosclerosis. The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that local RNAi of MCP-1 by site-specific delivery of adenovirus-mediated small hairpin RNA (shRNA) may enhance plaque stability and prevent plaque disruption in ApoE−/− mice. We designed an adenovirus-mediated shRNA against mouse MCP-1 (rAd5-MCP-1-shRNA). Male apolipoprotein E-knockout (ApoE−/−) mice (n = 120) were fed a high-fat diet and vulnerable plaques were induced by perivascular placement of constrictive collars around the carotid artery, intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide and stress stimulation. Mice were randomly divided into RNA interference (Ad-MCP-1i) group receiving local treatment of rAd5-MCP-1-shRNA suspension, Ad-EGFP group receiving treatment of rAd5-mediated negative shRNA and mock group receiving treatment of saline. Two weeks after treatment, plaque disruption rates were significantly lower in the Ad-MCP-1i group than in the Ad-EGFP group (13.3% vs. 60.0%, P = 0.01), and local MCP-1 expression was significantly inhibited in the Ad-MCP-1i group confirmed by immunostaining, qRT-PCR and western blot (P<0.001). Compared with the Ad-EGFP group, carotid plaques in the Ad-MCP-1i group showed increased levels of collagen and smooth muscle cells, and decreased levels of lipid and macrophages. The expression of inflammatory cytokines and activities of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) were lower in the Ad-MCP-1i group than in the Ad-EGFP group. In conclusion, site-specific delivery of adenoviral-mediated shRNA targeting mouse MCP-1 downregulated MCP-1 expression, turned a vulnerable plaque into a more stable plaque phenotype and prevented plaque disruption. A marked suppression of the local inflammatory cytokine expression may be the central mechanism involved."
https://openalex.org/W2041973890,"Many plasma membrane proteins are anchored to the membrane via a C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) moiety. The GPI anchor is attached to the protein in the endoplasmic reticulum by transamidation, a reaction in which a C-terminal GPI-attachment signal is cleaved off concomitantly with addition of the GPI moiety. GPI-attachment signals are poorly conserved on the sequence level but are all composed of a polar segment that includes the GPI-attachment site followed by a hydrophobic segment located at the very C terminus of the protein. Here, we show that efficient GPI modification requires that the hydrophobicity of the C-terminal segment is ""marginal"": less hydrophobic than type II transmembrane anchors and more hydrophobic than the most hydrophobic segments found in secreted proteins. We further show that the GPI-attachment signal can be modified by the transamidase irrespective of whether it is first released into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum or is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2043532984,"Francisella tularensis is a facultative intracellular bacterium and the causative agent of tularemia. Development of novel vaccines and therapeutics for tularemia has been hampered by the lack of understanding of which immune components are required to survive infection. Defining these requirements for protection against virulent F. tularensis, such as strain SchuS4, has been difficult since experimentally infected animals typically die within 5 days after exposure to as few as 10 bacteria. Such a short mean time to death typically precludes development, and therefore assessment, of immune responses directed against virulent F. tularensis. To enable identification of the components of the immune system that are required for survival of virulent F. tularensis, we developed a convalescent model of tularemia in C57Bl/6 mice using low dose antibiotic therapy in which the host immune response is ultimately responsible for clearance of the bacterium. Using this model we demonstrate αβTCR(+) cells, γδTCR(+) cells, and B cells are necessary to survive primary SchuS4 infection. Analysis of mice deficient in specific soluble mediators shows that IL-12p40 and IL-12p35 are essential for survival of SchuS4 infection. We also show that IFN-γ is required for survival of SchuS4 infection since mice lacking IFN-γR succumb to disease during the course of antibiotic therapy. Finally, we found that both CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells are the primary producers of IFN-γand that γδTCR(+) cells and NK cells make a minimal contribution toward production of this cytokine throughout infection. Together these data provide a novel model that identifies key cells and cytokines required for survival or exacerbation of infection with virulent F. tularensis and provides evidence that this model will be a useful tool for better understanding the dynamics of tularemia infection."
https://openalex.org/W1989289838,"Activating BRAF mutations that deregulate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway commonly occur in cancer. BRAFV600E induces centrosome amplification and spindle abnormalities that result in aneuploidy. We find modification of Mps1 is critical for contributing to centrosome amplification and chromosome instability induced by BRAFV600E. Phosphorylation of Mps1 at residue S281 induced by BRAFV600E stabilizes Mps1 protein by preventing its ubiquitination by APC/C and subsequent degradation, allowing the non-degraded protein to accumulate at centrosomes. Cells in which endogenous Mps1 was replaced with a phospho-mimetic Mps1 mutant are viable but amplify centrosomes and missegregate chromosomes frequently. Importantly, analysis of tumor micro arrays revealed that phospho-MAPK and S281-phosphorylated Mps1 were highly correlated in human melanoma tissues, implying that MAPK contributes to defects in the degradation of Mps1 in situ. We propose that continuously activated BRAFV600E signaling may be a possible mechanism for the deregulation of Mps1 stability and kinase activity in human tumors, and that persistent phosphorylation of Mps1 through BRAFV600E signaling is a key event in disrupting the control of centrosome duplication and chromosome stability that may contribute to tumorigenesis. Our findings raise the possibility that targeting the oncogenic BRAF and S281-phosphorylated Mps1, especially when used in combination could potentially provide great therapeutic opportunities for cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2078193496,"The molecular mechanisms for the discrepancy in outcome of initiating estrogen therapy (ET) around peri-menopause or several years after menopause in women are unknown. We hypothesize that the level of expression of a dominant negative estrogen receptor (ER) β variant, ERβ2, may be a key factor determining the effectiveness of ET in post-menopausal women. We tested this hypothesis in ovariectomized nine month-old (an age when irregular estrous cycles occur) female Sprague Dawley rats. Estradiol treatment was initiated either 6 days (Early ET, analogous to 4 months post-menopause in humans), or 180 days (Late ET, analogous to 11 years post-menopause in humans) after ovariectomy. Although ERβ2 expression increased in all OVX rats, neurogenic and neuroprotective responses to estradiol differed in Early and Late ET. Early ET reduced ERβ2 expression in both hippocampus and white blood cells, increased the hippocampal cell proliferation as assessed by Ki-67 expression, and improved mobility in the forced swim test. Late ET resulted in either no or modest effects on these parameters. There was a close correlation between the degree of ERβ2 expression and the preservation of neural effects by ET after OVX in rats, supporting the hypothesis that persistent elevated levels of ERβ2 are a molecular basis for the diminished effectiveness of ET in late post-menopausal women. The correlation between the expression of ERβ2 in circulating white blood cells and brain cells suggests that ERβ2 expression in peripheral blood cells may be an easily accessible marker to predict the effective window for ET in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2090049819,"Adipose tissue is a critical exchange center for complex energy transactions involving triacylglycerol storage and release. It also has an active endocrine role, releasing various adipose-derived cytokines (adipokines) that participate in complex pathways to maintain metabolic and vascular health. Here, we found D-dopachrome tautomerase (DDT) as an adipokine secreted from human adipocytes by a proteomic approach. DDT mRNA levels in human adipocytes were negatively correlated with obesity-related clinical parameters such as BMI, and visceral and subcutaneous fat areas. Experiments using SGBS cells, a human preadipocyte cell line, revealed that DDT mRNA levels were increased in an adipocyte differentiation-dependent manner and DDT was secreted from adipocytes. In DDT knockdown adipocytes differentiated from SGBS cells that were infected with the adenovirus expressing shRNA against the DDT gene, mRNA levels of genes involved in both lipolysis and lipogenesis were slightly but significantly increased. Furthermore, we investigated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, which phosphorylates and inactivates enzymes involved in lipid metabolism, including hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), in DDT knockdown adipocytes. The AMPK phosphorylation of HSL Ser-565 and ACC Ser-79 was inhibited in DDT knockdown cells and recovered in the cells treated with recombinant DDT (rDDT), suggesting that down-regulated DDT in adipocytes brings about a state of active lipid metabolism. Furthermore, administration of rDDT in db/db mice improved glucose intolerance and decreased serum free fatty acids levels. In the adipose tissue from rDDT-treated db/db mice, not only increased levels of HSL phosphorylated by AMPK, but also decreased levels of HSL phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates HSL to promote its activity, were observed. These results suggested that DDT acts on adipocytes to regulate lipid metabolism through AMPK and/or PKA pathway(s) and improves glucose intolerance caused by obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2110897805,"The Escherichia coli NhaA antiporter couples the transport of H(+) and Na(+) (or Li(+)) ions to maintain the proper pH range and Na(+) concentration in cells. A crystal structure of NhaA, solved at pH 4, comprises 12 transmembrane helices (TMs), arranged in two domains, with a large cytoplasm-facing funnel and a smaller periplasm-facing funnel. NhaA undergoes conformational changes, e.g. after pH elevation to alkaline ranges, and we used two computational approaches to explore them. On the basis of pseudo-symmetric features of the crystal structure, we predicted the structural architecture of an alternate, periplasm-facing state. In contrast to the crystal structure, the model presents a closed cytoplasmic funnel, and a periplasmic funnel of greater volume. To examine the transporter functional direction of motion, we conducted elastic network analysis of the crystal structure and detected two main normal modes of motion. Notably, both analyses predicted similar trends of conformational changes, consisting of an overall rotational motion of the two domains around a putative symmetry axis at the funnel centers, perpendicular to the membrane plane. This motion, along with conformational changes within specific helices, resulted in closure at the cytoplasmic end and opening at the periplasmic end. Cross-linking experiments, performed between segments on opposite sides of the cytoplasmic funnel, revealed pH-dependent interactions consistent with the proposed conformational changes. We suggest that the model-structure and predicted motion represent alkaline pH-induced conformational changes, mediated by a cluster of evolutionarily conserved, titratable residues, at the cytoplasmic ends of TMs II, V, and IX."
https://openalex.org/W2033478413,"In the field of herpesvirus research, the exact molecular mechanism by which such viruses reactivate from latency remains elusive. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) primarily exists in a latent state, while only 1-3% of cells support lytic infection at any specific time. KSHV reactivation from latency is an exceedingly intricate process mediated by the integration of viral and cellular factors. Previously, our lab has described early growth response-1 (Egr-1) as an essential component for the KSHV reactivation process via its ability to mediate transcription of KSHV ORF50, the gene encoding for replication and transcription activator (RTA), a viral component known to control the switch from latent to lytic infection. In here, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments revealed that Egr-1 binds KSHV ORF50 promoter (ORF50P) in at least two different GC-rich binding domains. Expression profiles of cellular egr-1 and KSHV-encoded ORF50 follow a similar pattern during de novo KSHV infection. Over-expressing Egr-1, a signaling component downstream of Raf>MEK>ERK1/2, in KSHV-infected cells activates KSHV lytic replication. Through performing more physiologically relevant experiments, we analyzed the effect of a dietary supplement containing resveratrol on KSHV-infected cells. Our results, for the first time, demonstrate resveratrol to act in lowering ERK1/2 activity and expression of Egr-1 in KSHV-infected cells, resulting in the suppression of virus reactivation from latency. Taken together, these findings will undoubtedly contribute to future studies on not only combating KSHV related disease conditions, but also on other herpesviruses-induced pathogenesis."

This study investigates the potential associations of RECK single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) susceptibility and its clinicopathologic characteristics.A total of 135 HCC cancer patients and 501 cancer-free controls were analyzed for four RECK SNPs (rs10814325, rs16932912, rs11788747, and rs10972727) using real-time PCR and PCR-RFLP genotyping analysis. After adjusting for other co-variants, the individuals carrying RECK promoter rs10814325 inheriting at least one C allele had a 1.85-fold [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03-3.36] risk of developing HCC compared to TT wild type carriers. The HCC patients, who carried rs11788747 with at least one G allele, had a higher distant metastasis risk than wild type probands.RECK gene polymorphisms might be a risk factor increasing HCC susceptibility and distant metastasis in Taiwan."
https://openalex.org/W2017389127,"To asses if tennis at prepubertal age elicits the hypertrophy of dominant arm muscles.The volume of the muscles of both arms was determined using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 7 male prepubertal tennis players (TP) and 7 non-active control subjects (CG) (mean age 11.0 ± 0.8 years, Tanner 1-2).TP had 13% greater total muscle volume in the dominant than in the contralateral arm. The magnitude of inter-arm asymmetry was greater in TP than in CG (13 vs 3%, P<0.001). The dominant arm of TP was 16% greater than the dominant arm of CG (P<0.01), whilst non-dominant arms had similar total muscle volumes in both groups (P = 0.25), after accounting for height as covariate. In TP, dominant deltoid (11%), forearm supinator (55%) and forearm flexors (21%) and extensors (25%) were hypertrophied compared to the contralateral arm (P<0.05). In CG, the dominant supinator muscle was bigger than its contralateral homonimous (63%, P<0.05).Tennis at prepubertal age is associated with marked hypertrophy of the dominant arm, leading to a marked level of asymmetry (+13%), much greater than observed in non-active controls (+3%). Therefore, tennis particpation at prepubertal age is associated with increased muscle volumes in dominant compared to the non-dominant arm, likely due to selectively hypertrophy of the loaded muscles."
https://openalex.org/W2052267735,"Several studies have suggested that the main features of preeclampsia (PE) are consequences of endothelial dysfunction related to excess circulating anti-angiogenic factors, most notably, soluble sVEGFR-1 (also known as sFlt-1) and soluble endoglin (sEng), as well as to decreased PlGF. Recently, soluble VEGF type 2 receptor (sVEGFR-2) has emerged as a crucial regulator of lymphangiogenesis. To date, however, there is a paucity of information on the changes of VEGFR-2 that occur during the clinical onset of PE. Therefore, the aim of our study was to characterize the plasma levels of VEGFR-2 in PE patients and to perform VEGFR-2 immunolocalization in placenta.By ELISA, we observed that the VEGFR-2 plasma levels were reduced during PE compared with normal gestational age matched pregnancies, whereas the VEGFR-1 and Eng plasma levels were increased. The dramatic drop in the VEGFR-1 levels shortly after delivery confirmed its placental origin. In contrast, the plasma levels of Eng and VEGFR-2 decreased only moderately during the early postpartum period. An RT-PCR analysis showed that the relative levels of VEGFR-1, sVEGFR-1 and Eng mRNA were increased in the placentas of women with severe PE. The relative levels of VEGFR-2 mRNA as well as expressing cells, were similar in both groups. We also made the novel finding that a recently described alternatively spliced VEGFR-2 mRNA variant was present at lower relative levels in the preeclamptic placentas.Our results indicate that the plasma levels of anti-angiogenic factors, particularly VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, behave in different ways after delivery. The rapid decrease in plasma VEGFR-1 levels appears to be a consequence of the delivery of the placenta. The persistent circulating levels of VEGFR-2 suggest a maternal endothelial origin of this peptide. The decreased VEGFR-2 plasma levels in preeclamptic women may serve as a marker of endothelial dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2072923085,"Background The Siberian salamander (Ranodon sibiricus), distributed in geographically isolated areas of Central Asia, is an ideal alpine species for studies of conservation and phylogeography. However, there are few data regarding the genetic diversity in R. sibiricus populations. Methodology/Principal Findings We used two genetic markers (mtDNA and microsatellites) to survey all six populations of R. sibiricus in China. Both of the markers revealed extreme genetic uniformity among these populations. There were only three haplotypes in the mtDNA, and the overall nucleotide diversity in the mtDNA was 0.00064, ranging from 0.00000 to 0.00091 for the six populations. Although we recovered 70 sequences containing microsatellite repeats, there were only two loci that displayed polymorphism. We used the approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) method to study the demographic history of the populations. This analysis suggested that the extant populations diverged from the ancestral population approximately 120 years ago and that the historical population size was much larger than the present population size; i.e., R. sibiricus has experienced dramatic population declines. Conclusion/Significance Our findings suggest that the genetic diversity in the R. sibiricus populations is the lowest among all investigated amphibians. We conclude that the isolation of R. sibiricus populations occurred recently and was a result of recent human activity and/or climatic changes. The Pleistocene glaciation oscillations may have facilitated intraspecies genetic homogeneity rather than enhanced divergence. A low genomic evolutionary rate and elevated inbreeding frequency may have also contributed to the low genetic variation observed in this species. Our findings indicate the urgency of implementing a protection plan for this endangered species."
https://openalex.org/W2138777766,"Apicomplexan parasites, such as the malaria-causing Plasmodium species, utilize a unique way of locomotion and host cell invasion. This substrate-dependent gliding motility requires rapid cycling of actin between the monomeric state and very short, unbranched filaments. Despite the crucial role of actin polymerization for the survival of the malaria parasite, the majority of Plasmodium cellular actin is present in the monomeric form. Plasmodium lacks most of the canonical actin nucleators, and formins are essentially the only candidates for this function in all Apicomplexa. The malaria parasite has two formins, containing conserved formin homology (FH) 2 and rudimentary FH1 domains. Here, we show that Plasmodium falciparum formin 1 associates with and nucleates both mammalian and Plasmodium actin filaments. Although Plasmodium profilin alone sequesters actin monomers, thus inhibiting polymerization, its monomer-sequestering activity does not compete with the nucleating activity of formin 1 at an equimolar profilin-actin ratio. We have determined solution structures of P. falciparum formin 1 FH2 domain both in the presence and absence of the lasso segment and the FH1 domain, and show that the lasso is required for the assembly of functional dimers."
https://openalex.org/W2087026730,"Here we report a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) based genotyping method for Klebsiella pneumoniae utilising high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis of fragments within the multilocus sequence typing (MLST) loci. The approach is termed mini-MLST or Minim typing and it has previously been applied to Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium. Six SNPs were derived from concatenated MLST sequences on the basis of maximisation of the Simpsons Index of Diversity (D). DNA fragments incorporating these SNPs and predicted to be suitable for HRM analysis were designed. Using the assumption that HRM alleles are defined by G+C content, Minim typing using six fragments was predicted to provide a D = 0.979 against known STs. The method was tested against 202 K. pneumoniae using a blinded approach in which the MLST analyses were performed after the HRM analyses. The HRM-based alleles were indeed in accordance with G+C content, and the Minim typing identified known STs and flagged new STs. The tonB MLST locus was determined to be very diverse, and the two Minim fragments located herein contribute greatly to the resolving power. However these fragments are refractory to amplification in a minority of isolates. Therefore, we assessed the performance of two additional formats: one using only the four fragments located outside the tonB gene (D = 0.929), and the other using HRM data from these four fragments in conjunction with sequencing of the tonB MLST fragment (D = 0.995). The HRM assays were developed on the Rotorgene 6000, and the method was shown to also be robust on the LightCycler 480, allowing a 384-well high through-put format. The assay provides rapid, robust and low-cost typing with fully portable results that can directly be related to current MLST data. Minim typing in combination with molecular screening for antibiotic resistance markers can be a powerful surveillance tool kit."
https://openalex.org/W1970322468,"Drosophila melanogaster experience cold shock injury and die when exposed to low non-freezing temperatures. In this study, we generated transgenic D. melanogaster that express putative Ixodes scapularis antifreeze glycoprotein (IAFGP) and show that the presence of IAFGP increases the ability of flies to survive in the cold. Male and female adult iafgp-expressing D. melanogaster exhibited higher survival rates compared with controls when placed at non-freezing temperatures. Increased hatching rates were evident in embryos expressing IAFGP when exposed to the cold. The TUNEL assay showed that flight muscles from iafgp-expressing female adult flies exhibited less apoptotic damage upon exposure to non-freezing temperatures in comparison to control flies. Collectively, these data suggest that expression of iafgp increases cold tolerance in flies by preventing apoptosis. This study defines a molecular basis for the role of an antifreeze protein in cryoprotection of flies."
https://openalex.org/W2010783122,"Proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members of the Bcl-2 homology (BH)3-only subgroup are critical for the establishment and maintenance of tissue homeostasis and can mediate apoptotic cell death in response to developmental cues or exogenously induced forms of cell stress. On the basis of the biochemical experiments as well as genetic studies in mice, the BH3-only proteins Bad and Bmf have been implicated in different proapoptotic events such as those triggered by glucose- or trophic factor-deprivation, glucocorticoids, or histone deacetylase inhibition, as well as suppression of B-cell lymphomagenesis upon aberrant expression of c-Myc. To address possible redundancies in cell death regulation and tumor suppression, we generated compound mutant mice lacking both genes. Our studies revealed lack of redundancy in most paradigms of lymphocyte apoptosis tested in tissue culture. Only spontaneous cell death of thymocytes kept in low glucose or that of pre-B cells deprived of cytokines was significantly delayed when both genes were lacking. Of note, despite these minor apoptosis defects we observed compromised lymphocyte homeostasis in vivo that affected mainly the B-cell lineage. Long-term follow-up revealed significantly reduced latency to spontaneous tumor formation in aged mice when both genes were lacking. Together our study suggests that Bad and Bmf co-regulate lymphocyte homeostasis and limit spontaneous transformation by mechanisms that may not exclusively be linked to the induction of lymphocyte apoptosis."

This grouping distinguished OG1RF and GelE metalloprotease-expressing isolates from JH2-2 and other GelE-negative isolates. The integrity of the fsrABDC operon was found to determine the exoproteome composition, since an fsrB mutant of strain OG1RF appeared very similar to that of strain JH2-2, and complementation of the latter with the fsrABDC operon produced an OG1RF-like exoproteome. The proteins present in the supernatant fraction of OG1RF were separated using 2D gels and identified by mass spectrometry and comprised many mass and pI variants of the GelE and SprE proteases. In addition cell wall synthesis and cell division proteins were identified. An OG1RF fsrB mutant had a distinct exoprotein fraction with an absence of the Fsr-regulated proteases and was characterised by general stress and glycolytic proteins. The exoproteome of the OG1RF fsrB mutant resembles that of a divIVA mutant of E. faecalis, suggestive of a stress phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2036016307,"Background The Chinese pine caterpillar moth, Dendrolimus tabulaeformis Tsai and Liu (Lepidoptera: Lasiocampidae) is the most important defoliator of coniferous trees in northern China. Outbreaks occur over enormous areas and often lead to the death of forests during 2–3 successive years of defoliation. The sex pheromone of D. tabulaeformis was investigated to define its chemistry and behavioral activity. Methodology/Principal Findings Sex pheromone was collected from calling female D. tabulaeformis by headspace solid phase microextraction (SPME) and by solvent extraction of pheromone glands. Extracts were analyzed by coupled gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and coupled GC-electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD), using antennae from male moths. Five components from the extracts elicited antennal responses. These compounds were identified by a combination of retention indices, electron impact mass spectral matches, and derivatization as (Z)-5-dodecenyl acetate (Z5-12:OAc), (Z)-5-dodecenyl alcohol (Z5-12:OH), (5Z,7E)-5,7-dodecadien-1-yl acetate (Z5,E7-12:OAc), (5Z,7E)-5,7-dodecadien-1-yl propionate (Z5,E7-12:OPr), and (5Z,7E)-5,7-dodecadien-1-ol (Z5,E7-12:OH). Behavioral assays showed that male D. tabulaeformis strongly discriminated against incomplete and aberrant blend ratios. The correct ratio of Z5,E7-12:OAc, Z5,E7-12:OH, and Z5,E7-12:OPr was essential for optimal upwind flight and source contact. The two monoenes, Z5-12:OAc and Z5-12:OH, alone or binary mixtures, had no effect on behavioral responses when added to the optimal three-component blend. Conclusions/Significance The fact that deviations from the optimal ratio of 100∶100∶4.5 of Z5,E7-12:OAc, Z5,EZ7-12:OH, and Z5,E7-12:OPr resulted in marked decreases in male responses suggests that biosynthesis of the pheromone components is precisely controlled. The optimal blend of the sex pheromone components of D. tabulaeformis worked out in this study should find immediate use in monitoring this pest in Chinese forests."
https://openalex.org/W2093990257,"Insight into the normal function of PrP(C), and how it can be subverted to produce neurotoxic effects, is provided by PrP molecules carrying deletions encompassing the conserved central region. The most neurotoxic of these mutants, Δ105-125 (called ΔCR), produces a spontaneous neurodegenerative illness when expressed in transgenic mice, and this phenotype can be dose-dependently suppressed by co-expression of wild-type PrP. Whether the toxic activity of ΔCR PrP and the protective activity or wild-type PrP are cell-autonomous, or can be exerted on neighboring cells, is unknown. To investigate this question, we have utilized co-cultures of differentiated neural stem cells derived from mice expressing ΔCR or wild-type PrP. Cells from the two kinds of mice, which are marked by the presence or absence of GFP, are differentiated together to yield neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. As a surrogate read-out of ΔCR PrP toxicity, we assayed sensitivity of the cells to the cationic antibiotic, Zeocin. In a previous study, we reported that cells expressing ΔCR PrP are hypersensitive to the toxic effects of several cationic antibiotics, an effect that is suppressed by co-expression of wild type PrP, similar to the rescue of the neurodegenerative phenotype observed in transgenic mice. Using this system, we find that while ΔCR-dependent toxicity is cell-autonomous, the rescuing activity of wild-type PrP can be exerted in trans from nearby cells. These results provide important insights into how ΔCR PrP subverts a normal physiological function of PrP(C), and the cellular mechanisms underlying the rescuing process."
https://openalex.org/W1993597787,"Gene knockdown analyses using the in utero electroporation method have helped reveal functional aspects of genes of interest in cortical development. However, the application of this method to analyses in later stages of brain development or in the adult brain is still difficult because the amount of injected plasmids in a cell decreases along with development due to dilution by cell proliferation and the degradation of the plasmids. Furthermore, it is difficult to exclude the influence of earlier knockdown effects.We developed a tightly controlled conditional knockdown system using a newly constructed vector, pT2K-TBI-shRNAmir, based on a Tol2 transposon-mediated gene transfer methodology with the tetracycline-inducible gene expression technique, which allows us to maintain a transgene for a long period of time and induce the knockdown of the gene of interest. We showed that expression of the endogenous amyloid precursor protein (APP) was sharply decreased by our inducible, stably integrated knockdown system in PC12 cells. Moreover, we induced an acute insufficiency of Dab1 with our system and observed that radial migration was impaired in the developing cerebral cortex. Such inhibitory effects on radial migration were not observed without induction, indicating that our system tightly controlled the knockdown, without any expression leakage in vivo.Our system enables us to investigate the brain at any of the later stages of development or in the adult by utilizing a knockdown technique with the aid of the in utero electroporation gene transfer methodology. Furthermore, we can perform knockdown analyses free from the influence of undesired earlier knockdown effects."
https://openalex.org/W1966370608,"While isogenic DT40 cell lines deficient in DNA repair pathways are a great tool to understand the DNA damage response to genotoxic agents by a comparison of cell toxicity in mutants and parental DT40 cells, no convenient mutation assay for mutagens currently exists for this reverse-genetic system. Here we establish a proaerolysin (PA) selection-based mutation assay in DT40 cells to identify glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor deficient cells. Using PA, we detected an increase in the number of PA-resistant DT40 cells exposed to MMS for 24 hours followed by a 5-day period of phenotype expression. GPI anchor synthesis is catalyzed by a series of phosphatidylinositol glycan complementation groups (PIGs). The PIG-O gene is on the sex chromosome (Chromosome Z) in chicken cells and is critical for GPI anchor synthesis at the intermediate step. Among all the mutations detected in the sequence levels observed in DT40 cells exposed to MMS at 100 µM, we identified that ∼55% of the mutations are located at A:T sites with a high frequency of A to T transversion mutations. In contrast, we observed no transition mutations out of 18 mutations. This novel assay for DT40 cells provides a valuable tool to investigate the mode of action of mutations caused by reactive agents using a series of isogenic mutant DT40 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2014366893,"Background Genetic variability in the regulation of the nitric oxide (NO) pathway may influence hemodynamic changes in pediatric sepsis. We sought to determine whether functional polymorphisms in DDAH2, which metabolizes the NO synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), are associated with susceptibility to sepsis, plasma ADMA, distinct hemodynamic states, and vasopressor requirements in pediatric septic shock. Methodology/Principal Findings In a prospective study, blood and buccal swabs were obtained from 82 patients ≤18 years (29 with severe sepsis/septic shock plus 27 febrile and 26 healthy controls). Plasma ADMA was measured using tandem mass spectrometry. DDAH2 gene was partially sequenced to determine the −871 6g/7g insertion/deletion and −449G/C single nucleotide polymorphisms. Shock type (“warm” versus “cold”) was characterized by clinical assessment. The −871 7g allele was more common in septic (17%) then febrile (4%) and healthy (8%) patients, though this was not significant after controlling for sex and race (p = 0.96). ADMA did not differ between −871 6g/7g genotypes. While genotype frequencies also did not vary between groups for the −449G/C SNP (p = 0.75), septic patients with at least one −449G allele had lower ADMA (median, IQR 0.36, 0.30–0.41 µmol/L) than patients with the −449CC genotype (0.55, 0.49–0.64 µmol/L, p = 0.008) and exhibited a higher incidence of “cold” shock (45% versus 0%, p = 0.01). However, after controlling for race, the association with shock type became non-significant (p = 0.32). Neither polymorphism was associated with inotrope score or vasoactive infusion duration. Conclusions/Significance The −449G polymorphism in the DDAH2 gene was associated with both low plasma ADMA and an increased likelihood of presenting with “cold” shock in pediatric sepsis, but not with vasopressor requirement. Race, however, was an important confounder. These results support and justify the need for larger studies in racially homogenous populations to further examine whether genotypic differences in NO metabolism contribute to phenotypic variability in sepsis pathophysiology."
https://openalex.org/W1981109041,"Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are a subset of DCs whose major function relies on their capacity to produce large amount of type I IFN upon stimulation via TLR 7 and 9. This function is evolutionary conserved and place pDC in critical position in the innate immune response to virus. Here we show that rat pDC constitutively express TNF-related activation-induced cytokine (TRANCE) also known as Receptor-activating NF-κB ligand (RANKL). TRANCE/RANKL is a member of the TNF superfamily which plays a central role in osteoclastogenesis through its interaction with its receptor RANK. TRANCE/RANK interaction are also involved in lymphoid organogenesis as well as T cell/DC cross talk. Unlike conventional DC, rat CD4high pDC were shown to constitutively express TRANCE/RANKL both at the mRNA and the surface protein level. TRANCE/RANKL was also induced on the CD4low subsets of pDC following activation by CpG. The secreted form of TRANCE/RANKL was also produced by rat pDC. Of note, levels of mRNA, surface and secreted TRANCE/RANKL expression were similar to that observed for activated T cells. TRANCE/RANKL expression was found on pDC in all lymphoid organs as well blood and BM with a maximum expression in mesenteric lymph nodes. Despite this TRANCE/RANKL expression, we were unable to demonstrate in vitro osteoclastogenesis activity for rat pDC. Taken together, these data identifies pDC as novel source of TRANCE/RANKL in the immune system."
https://openalex.org/W2066557138,"p53 is essential for the cellular responses to DNA damage that help to maintain genomic stability. However, the great majority of human cancers undergo disruption of the p53-network. Identification and characterization of molecular components important in both p53-dependent and -independent apoptosis might be useful in developing novel therapies for cancers. In the complete absence of p53, cells treated with N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate (PALA) continue to synthesize DNA slowly and eventually progress through S-phase, suffering severe DNA damage that in turn triggers apoptosis, whereas cells with functional p53 undergo growth arrest. In this study, we investigated apoptotic signaling in response to PALA and the role of p53 expression in this pathway. We found that treatment of cells lacking p53 with PALA induced TAp73, Noxa and Bim and inactivation of these proteins with dominant-negative plasmids or small interfering RNAs significantly inhibited apoptosis, suggesting that PALA-induced apoptosis was mediated via TAp73-dependent expression of Noxa and Bim. However, PALA treatment inhibited the expression of ΔNp73 only in cells lacking p53 but not in cells expressing p53. In addition, PALA treatment inhibited Bcl-2, and overexpression of Bcl-2 significantly inhibited PALA-induced apoptosis. Moreover, expression of p53 in these cells protected them from PALA-induced apoptosis by activating p21, sustaining the expression of ΔNp73 and inhibiting the induction of Noxa and Bim. Taken together, our study identifies novel but opposing roles for the p53 and TAp73 in the induction of Noxa and Bim and regulation of apoptosis. Our data will help to develop strategies to eliminate cancer cells lacking p53 while protecting normal cells with wild-type p53."
https://openalex.org/W1975588357,"Inflammation caused by chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is associated with the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma; however, the mechanisms by which HBV infection induces inflammation and inflammatory cytokine production remain largely unknown. We analyzed the gene expression patterns of lymphocytes from chronic HBV-infected patients and found that the expression of ZFP36, an AU-rich element (ARE)-binding protein, was dramatically reduced in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes from chronic HBV patients. ZFP36 expression was also reduced in CD14(+) monocytes and in total PBMCs from chronic HBV patients. To investigate the functional consequences of reduced ZFP36 expression, we knocked down ZFP36 in PBMCs from healthy donors using siRNA. siRNA-mediated silencing of ZFP36 resulted in dramatically increased expression of multiple inflammatory cytokines, most of which were also increased in the plasma of chronic HBV patients. Furthermore, we found that IL-8 and RANTES induced ZFP36 downregulation, and this effect was mediated through protein kinase C. Importantly, we found that HBsAg stimulated PBMCs to express IL-8 and RANTES, resulting in decreased ZFP36 expression. Our results suggest that an inflammatory feedback loop involving HBsAg, ZFP36, and inflammatory cytokines may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of chronic HBV and further indicate that ZFP36 may be an important target for anti-inflammatory therapy during chronic HBV infection."
