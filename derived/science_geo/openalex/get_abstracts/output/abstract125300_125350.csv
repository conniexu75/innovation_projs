https://openalex.org/W2096299662,"Leptin is an adipocyte hormone involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis. Generally accepted biological effects of leptin are inhibition of food intake and stimulation of metabolic rate in <i>ob</i>/<i>ob</i>mice that are defective in the leptin gene. In contrast to these centrally mediated effects of leptin, we are reporting here on leptin effects on isolated rat adipocytes. Leptin impairs several metabolic actions of insulin, <i>i.e.</i>stimulation of glucose transport, glycogen synthase, lipogenesis, inhibition of isoproterenol-induced lipolysis, and protein kinase A activation, as well as stimulation of protein synthesis. Insulin effects were reduced by leptin (2 nm) with a half-life of about 8 h. At low leptin concentrations (<1 nm), the insulin sensitivity was reduced leading to a shift to the right in the dose-response curve. At higher concentrations the responsiveness was diminished, resulting in nearly complete inhibition of insulin effects at >30 nm leptin. The IC<sub>50</sub> value of leptin was 3.1 ± 1 nm after 15 h of preincubation of adipocytes in primary culture. The natural splice variant des-Gln<sup>49</sup>-leptin exhibited a significantly lower potency. Adipocytes regained full insulin sensitivity within a few hours after leptin removal. The stimulation of glucose transport by vanadate was not affected by leptin. These data show specific and potent impairment of insulin action by leptin in the physiological concentration range of both leptin and insulin, which may be related to the pathophysiology of insulin resistance in both non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2170560435,"P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a member of the ATP binding cassette superfamily of active transporters and can confer multidrug resistance on cells and tumors by pumping chemotherapeutic drugs from the cytoplasm. P-gp was purified from CHrB30 cells and retained the ability to bind substrates and hydrolyze ATP. Labeling of P-gp with lectin-gold particles suggested it is monomeric. An initial structure of purified P-gp was determined to 2.5 nm resolution by electron microscopy and single particle image analysis of both detergent-solubilized and lipid-reconstituted protein. The structure was further refined by three dimensional reconstructions from single particle images and by Fourier projection maps of small two-dimensional crystalline arrays (unit cell parameters: a, 14.2 nm; b, 18.5 nm; and γ, 91.6°). When viewed from above the membrane plane the protein is toroidal, with 6-fold symmetry and a diameter of about 10 nm. There is a large central pore of about 5 nm in diameter, which is closed at the inner (cytoplasmic) face of the membrane, forming an aqueous chamber within the membrane. An opening from this chamber to the lipid phase is present. The projection of the protein perpendicular to the membrane is roughly rectangular with a maximum depth of 8 nm and two 3-nm lobes exposed at the cytoplasmic face of the membrane, likely to correspond to the nucleotide binding domains.

The multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein (P-gp) 1The abbreviations used are: P-gp, P-glycoprotein; ABC, ATP binding cassette; NBD, nucleotide binding domain. 1The abbreviations used are: P-gp, P-glycoprotein; ABC, ATP binding cassette; NBD, nucleotide binding domain. is an active transporter located in the plasma membranes of many cells and tissues (1Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3557) Google Scholar). P-gp has a relatively broad specificity for hydrophobic compounds. Although its natural substrate(s) is not known, when overexpressed P-gp can confer multidrug resistance on cells and tumors by pumping chemotherapeutic drugs from the cytoplasm. P-gp is a member of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of transporters and channels (2Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3364) Google Scholar). More than 100 ABC transporters have been identified in bacteria, yeasts, plants, and mammals, including the cystic fibrosis and adrenoleukodystrophy gene products, the pfmdr gene product associated with drug resistance of the malarial parasite, and the TAP (transporter associated with antigenpresentation) peptide transporter, which is essential for antigen presentation. ABC transporters share a common domain organization and considerable amino acid sequence identity, implying a common architecture and evolutionary origin. P-gp is a 170-kDa polypeptide that is glycosylated at a single site at the extracellular face of the membrane. From its primary sequence, P-gp is predicted to consist of four domains. Two hydrophobic transmembrane domains each consist of six membrane-spanning segments (putative α-helices) separated by hydrophilic loops (3Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 4Kast C. Canfield V. Levenson R. Gros P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4402-4411Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These transmembrane domains are believed to form the pathway through which solute crosses the membrane and to play a major role in determining substrate specificity. The other two domains, the nucleotide binding domains (NBDs), are located at the cytoplasmic face of the membrane and couple ATP hydrolysis to the transport process (5Hyde S.C. Emsley P. Hartshorn M.J., M.M., M. Gileadi U. Pearce S.R. Gallagher M.P. Gill D.R. Hubbard R.E. Higgins C.F. Nature. 1990; 346: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 6Mimura C.S. Holbrook S.R. Ames G.F.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 88: 84-88Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Although a considerable body of biochemical and genetic data has accrued for many ABC transporters, little is known about the three-dimensional organization of these proteins. Indeed, the absence of any structural data is the principal factor that limits our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of active transport. In this study we present an initial structure for P-gp, determined to 2.5 nm resolution. These data provide the first structural insights for any ABC transporter. Chinese hamster ovary CHrB30 cells were grown and maintained in a medium containing 30 μg/ml colchicine as described previously (7Callaghan R. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16059-16064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasma membranes from these cells were prepared according to the method of Lever (8Lever J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1990-1997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications (7Callaghan R. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16059-16064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were stored at a protein concentration of 5–7 μg/μl at −80 °C for up to 6 months without loss of P-gp activity. Membranes from CHrB30 cells were solubilized in the mild, nonionic detergent dodecyl maltoside and purified by anion exchange and hydroxyapatite chromatography as described in detail elsewhere. 2R. Callaghan, G. Berridge, D. R. Ferry, and C. F. Higgins, submitted for publication. Fractions containing P-gp from the final hydroxyapatite chromatographic step were concentrated to approximately 0.2 μg/μl and stored at −20 °C. Large unilamellar liposomes of asolectin lipids were generated at a lipid concentration of 15 mg/ml in dialysis buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) as described previously (10MacDonald R.C. MacDonald R.I. Menco B. Taleshita K. Subbarao N.K. Hu L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1061: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). The liposomes were solubilized with 40 mmoctyl-β-glucoside and added to purified P-gp at a lipid:protein ratio of 10:1 (w/w) for 30 min at 4 °C. Detergent was subsequently removed, and P-gp was reconstituted into asolectin lipids by Sephadex G-50 gel filtration chromatography (1 × 60 cm) using 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, elution buffer. The void volume fractions were collected, and proteoliposomes were concentrated by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 4 h at 4 °C. The efficiency of reconstitution was assessed by the co-migration of P-gp with tracer [3H]phosphatidylcholine during sucrose density centrifugation (11Rigaud J.-L. Paternostre M.-T. Bluzat A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2677-2688Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar).2 ATP hydrolysis by purified, reconstituted P-gp was determined essentially as described (12Chifflet S. Chiesa U.T.R. Tolosa S. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 13Doige C.A. Yu X. Sharom F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1109: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Each assay was carried out in a total volume of 150 μl of assay buffer (150 mm NH4Cl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3) containing 0.5 μg of protein and 2 mm MgATP for 25 min at 37 °C (during which hydrolysis rates were linear). Following the addition of 150 μl of stop (12% SDS, 1% ammonium molybdate in 1 m HCl) and 150 μl of stabilizing (2% (w/v) each of Na metarsenite, Na citrate, and acetic acid) solutions and a 10-min incubation at 37 °C, the absorbance was measured at 750 nm. Basal ATPase activity was measured as nmol of Pi liberated per min per mg of protein. Assays carried out in the presence of verapamil or orthovanadate were expressed as the percentage change in basal ATPase activity (mean ± S.E.) from at least five independent P-gp preparations. Background phosphate levels were measured by incubating samples in the absence of drug at 4 °C and were subtracted from all measurements. The equilibrium binding of [3H]vinblastine to P-gp was determined using a rapid filtration assay based on published methods (14Ferry D.R. Russell M.A. Cullen M.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 188: 440-445Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Saturation isotherms were obtained by incubating 5–120 nm[3H]vinblastine with 20 μg of CHrB30 membranes or 1 μg of reconstituted P-gp in a total volume of 200 μl at 25 °C for 2 h. Samples were filtered through a combination of Whatman GF/F fiber and 0.1-μm nitrocellulose filters, and radioactivity retained was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Nonspecific binding of [3H]vinblastine binding to membranes and liposomes was determined in the presence of 3 μm unlabeled vinblastine. Data were expressed as pmol of [3H]vinblastine bound per mg of protein. The equationB o= (B max ×F)/(K d + F) was fitted to saturation isotherms by nonlinear regression analysis using Kaleidograph (Abelbeck Software). B o is the amount of [3H]vinblastine bound,B max the density of binding sites,K d the apparent dissociation constant, andF the concentration of free [3H]vinblastine. Photoaffinity labeling of P-gp (1–2 μg of protein) with the 1,4-dihydropyridine [3H]azidopine (45 nm) was determined by fluorography of SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described previously (15Callaghan R. Higgins C.F. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 71: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Vinblastine (1–500 μm, as indicated) was used to inhibit [3H]azidopine labeling. Lentil lectin agglutinin fromLens culinaris (Sigma), specific for α-mannose residues, binds to glycosylated P-gp in the presence of divalent cations (16Sharom F.J. Yu X. Chu J.W.K. Doige C.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Detergent-solubilized P-gp and gold-labeled lectin (5 nm) were mixed and incubated at a molar ratio of 1:1 at 4 °C overnight with constant agitation in buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 25 mm MgSO4). Specimen preparation for electron microscopy was as described below. Copper grids (400 mesh/inch; Agar Scientific Ltd., Stansted, United Kingdom) were coated with a collodion/carbon film. Specimens were adsorbed to freshly glow-discharged grids (to render them hydrophilic) for 30 s, washed with filtered water for 30 s, and negatively stained with uranyl acetate (4% w/v in water; Electron Microscopy Laboratories Ltd., Reading, UK) or sodium phosphotungstate (17Holzenburg A. Bewley M.C. Wilson F.H. Nicholson W.V. Ford R.C. Nature. 1993; 363: 470-472Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar) for 1 min. Electron micrographs were recorded at calibrated magnification using Phillips EM 301, Hitachi H-600, or Phillips CM 10 electron microscopes at 100 kiloelectron volts. Low dose conditions were achieved by focusing on an area of the carbon film adjacent to the area of interest to minimize irradiation damage to the specimen. The micrographs were digitized using a rotating drum microdensitometer (Joyce-Loebl) at 25-μm increments corresponding to pixel sizes in the range of 5–7 Å at the specimen level (depending on the primary magnification). Single particle averaging was undertaken with the SPIDER software package on micro-VAX and Indigo-Silicon Graphics work stations (18Frank J. Shimkin B. Dowse H. Ultramicroscopy. 1981; 6: 343-358Crossref Google Scholar, 19Rosenberg, M. F., Holzenburg, A., Shepherd, F. H., Nicholson, W. V., Flint, T. D., and Ford, R. C. (1996) Biochim. Biophys. Acta., in press.Google Scholar). The images were initially band pass-filtered (20Harauz G. Boekema E. van Heel M. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 35-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Particles were interactively selected using the program WEB padded to 64 × 64 pixels, and the densities were normalized (21van Heel M. Stöffler-Meilicke M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2389-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Padded images were masked with a circular mask, and a Gaussian falloff filter was applied with a half-width of 1.0 pixel. Particles were rotationally aligned by an autocorrelation function-based method (20Harauz G. Boekema E. van Heel M. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 35-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and translationally aligned by cross-correlation using a reference particle (22Saxton W.O. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1977; 2: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Initially, the first 20 particles were aligned with respect to a reference particle, and the best aligned particles were used to calculate a new reference, which was then used to align the rest of the particles. An average image was calculated by summing the aligned particles. The images were then subjected to correspondence analysis (23van Heel M. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1981; 6: 187-194PubMed Google Scholar) and classification (24Frank J. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1990; 23: 281-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and the alignment procedure was repeated using the class averages as references. For resolution assessment, two independently derived averages were compared in Fourier space. The differential phase residual was computed and plotted as a function of the ring radius, and the resolution calculated when the 45° limit was reached. The Fourier ring correlation (25Frank J. Radermacher M. Wagenknecht T. Verschoor A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 64: 3-35Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was also used for resolution estimation. Images were taken in pairs at 100 kiloelectron volts, at an optimized level of defocus and under low dose conditions. The first image was taken with the specimen tilted by 45°, whereas the second was taken without tilt with the distances between the molecules optimized for minimal overlap during tilting. When the specimen is tilted, the particles adsorbing to the grid in a preferred orientation present a conical range of projections from which an averaged particle can be reconstructed in three dimensions. Particle images were selected simultaneously from 0 and 45° micrographs displayed side by side on a Silicon Graphics work station, using an interactive particle selection program that established the geometric relationship (in terms of rotation, translation, direction of tilt axis, and tilt angle) between the two micrographs. 400 particles from two electron micrograph pairs were selected (26Radermacher M. J. Electron Microsc. Tech. 1988; 9: 359-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) using the SPIDER image-processing system (23van Heel M. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1981; 6: 187-194PubMed Google Scholar). The images were contrast-normalized and pretreated by band pass filtering to suppress the very low and high spatial frequencies (noise). The frequency limits were coupled to the size of the molecule (low frequency) and expected resolution (high frequency). A reference-free alignment algorithm was used, enabling a comparison of projection maps derived from reference-based and reference-free alignments (27Penczek P. Radermacher M. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 40: 33-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Untilted particles were classified (24Frank J. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1990; 23: 281-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) by hierarchical ascendant classification with complete linkage as a merging criterion. Construction of a linkage tree or dendrogram allowed partitioning of the data set into appropriate groups, based on group size and the “within-group resolution.” In addition, an eigenvector plot was constructed according to the Diday method of classification (24Frank J. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1990; 23: 281-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This plot shows the variations of the P-gp molecules in factor space, where the axes represent principal components of the variational pattern. Clusters were identified, and homogeneous subsets of images were then isolated. For each group of particles (averages I–III) derived from hierarchical ascendant classification, the corresponding tilt images (after centering) were used for separate reconstructions according to the random conical geometry. Reconstruction was undertaken by an iterative three-dimensional reconstruction method based on a χ2minimization constraint (27Penczek P. Radermacher M. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 40: 33-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). This method reduces the effects of missing angular range on the reconstruction. Phase residual calculations were used for the cross-resolution assessment, and resulting reconstructions were low pass-filtered according to the resolution assessment. For viewing the results, a surface representation was used on a work station using WEB in the SPIDER package. Crystallographic image processing of small, two-dimensional crystalline arrays of P-gp was carried out using the program CRISP and Trimerge (Calidris Ltd., Stockholm, Sweden) (28Hovmöller S. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 41: 121-135Crossref Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Images of micrographs (×86,400 magnification) were digitized at 64 μm/pixel, giving 7.4 Å/pixel at the specimen level. Crystalline arrays were displayed, and the best ordered areas were judged by the sharpness and intensity of the first order reflections in the calculated Fourier transforms. The best areas were then used for lattice refinement, extraction of amplitudes and phases, and plane group assignment. Structure factors from 10 separate crystalline areas were merged after phase origin refinement, and averaged phases and amplitudes were extracted for each spot. Since the plane group contained 1 asymmetric unit, the merging process required the operator to identify which of the two possible orientations of each crystalline area to apply. This decision was made by comparing the interimage phase residuals for the two possible orientations (rotated by 0 or 180° with respect to the first crystalline area used in the merging procedure); in each case the orientation with the lowest interimage phase residual was applied. The final averaged structure factors were used to calculate an averaged projection map of the unit cell. The averaged interimage phase residual was 31° (a residual of 90° would be expected for completely random data). Chinese hamster ovary CHrB30 cells have been selected for high level drug resistance and overexpress P-gp to about 3% of total membrane protein. P-gp was solubilized from CHrB30 membranes using the nonionic detergent dodecyl maltoside and purified to >95% by anion exchange and hydroxyapatite chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 1 A shows a silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel of the starting material (CHrB30 membranes) and purified P-gp. Purified P-gp was reconstituted into liposomes of asolectin by gel filtration chromatography. The efficiency of reconstitution was assessed by co-migration of P-gp with tracer lipids during sucrose density gradient centrifugation. P-gp did not reconstitute efficiently at lipid:protein ratios of <10:1 (w/w). However, efficient reconstitution was obtained at higher lipid:protein ratios. The number of protein molecules reconstituted per unit area of liposome membrane observed by electron microscopy was as expected, given the relative amount of lipid and protein used (see below). P-gp activity was assayed by measuring drug-stimulated ATPase activity and substrate binding (Fig. 1, B and C). The basal ATPase activity of purified, reconstituted P-gp (800 ± 48 nmol/min/mg; n = 4) was significantly greater than that measured for CHrB30 membranes (377 ± 129 nmol/min/mg;n = 9) and compared favorably with the activity reported for P-gp purified from CHrB30 membranes by immunoaffinity chromatography (29Shapiro A.B. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3745-3754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATPase activity was stimulated by verapamil (EC50, 1.9 ± 0.3 μm) and inhibited by orthovanadate (EC50, 2.4 ± 0.7 μm), with half-maximal concentrations indistinguishable from those determined for P-gp in native membranes (Fig.1 B).2 Thus, coupling between substrate binding and ATPase activity was unaltered following purification and reconstitution. Purified, reconstituted P-gp retained high affinity [3H]vinblastine binding (K d, 46 ± 10 nm; n = 4), similar to that measured for P-gp in native membranes (37 ± 5 nm;n = 3) (Table I). The specific binding capacity of purified P-gp for [3H]vinblastine (793 ± 108 pmol/mg) increased during purification (Table I). Azidopine, like other 1,4-dihydropyridines, is believed to bind at an allosteric site on P-gp (14Ferry D.R. Russell M.A. Cullen M.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 188: 440-445Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Concentrations of 1–5 μm vinblastine were required to displace 50% [3H]azidopine photolabeling of purified P-gp (Fig. 1 C), indistinguishable from the concentrations required to displace [3H] azidopine binding from native membranes (15Callaghan R. Higgins C.F. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 71: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus, the binding sites for azidopine and vinblastine remain coupled in a negative allosteric fashion in the purified P-gp. In conclusion, the activities of purified and reconstituted P-gp were not significantly different from those of P-gp in native membranes.Table IEquilibrium binding of [3H]vinblastine by CHrB30 plasma membranes (20 μg) or purified reconstituted P-gp (1 μg)CHrB30 membranesPurified P-gpK d(nm)37 ± 546 ± 10B max (pmol/mg)161 ± 11793 ± 108The affinity (K d) and capacity (B max) of binding were determined from saturation isotherms using nonlinear regression of the equation (B max × [vinblastine])/(K d + [vinblastine]) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 3 μm unlabelled vinblastine.

Electron microscopy and single particle averaging (30Frank J. Verschoor A. Boublik M. Science. 1981; 214: 1353-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) allow multiple images of a macromolecule in a characteristic orientation to be translationally and rotationally aligned using an iterative procedure of cross-correlation and autocorrelation and then averaged to produce a refined image (25Frank J. Radermacher M. Wagenknecht T. Verschoor A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 64: 3-35Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Single particle analysis was initially carried out on reconstituted P-gp because, compared with solubilized protein, the lipid bilayer confines all the particles in the z axis (i.e.the axis perpendicular to the membrane plane) such that they can only exhibit rotational freedom within the x, y plane, limiting the potential orientations that the molecules can adopt. Proteoliposomes were negatively stained with uranyl acetate and examined by electron microscopy. The lipid vesicles were relatively uniform in size, between 50 and 200 nm in diameter (Fig.2 A). Small, uniform, 10-nm-diameter particles with a heavily stained central region were observed in these vesicles (Fig. 2 A). The particles were also observed after staining with sodium phosphotungstate, pH 7.0 (data not shown). The contrast for reconstituted protein was low compared with detergent-solubilized protein (see below), as expected for a membrane-embedded protein protruding only a small distance from the bilayer. A montage of several typical particles at a higher magnification and with contrast maximized is shown in Fig. 2 A. These particles were not observed in lipid vesicles in the absence of reconstituted P-gp. The area occupied by the particles at a 10:1 lipid:protein ratio, as a proportion of total membrane surface area, was 1:23, in good agreement with the expected value calculated from the partial specific volumes of lipid and protein and the greater “depth” of the protein (8 nm; see below) compared with the 4-nm lipid bilayer. Protein molecules reconstituted into lipids normally present a uniform, face-on view because of vesicle flattening on the support film of the grid, and because uranyl acetate preferentially stains the membrane plane most closely associated with the support film (17Holzenburg A. Bewley M.C. Wilson F.H. Nicholson W.V. Ford R.C. Nature. 1993; 363: 470-472Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 31Ford R.C. Rosenberg M.F. Shepherd F.H. McPhie P. Holzenburg A. Micron. 1995; 26: 133-14031Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The signal:noise ratio was enhanced by averaging images of many particles with similar projections relative to the electron beam (30Frank J. Verschoor A. Boublik M. Science. 1981; 214: 1353-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The images of individual particles were first aligned and then classified into groups displaying similar projections by correspondence analysis (21van Heel M. Stöffler-Meilicke M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2389-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar,23van Heel M. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1981; 6: 187-194PubMed Google Scholar). Then, within each class, the particles were translationally and rotationally aligned with respect to a reference particle selected from the group. Such methods have significantly enhanced the structural information obtained for large macromolecules such as the ribosome (25Frank J. Radermacher M. Wagenknecht T. Verschoor A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 64: 3-35Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and chaperonins (32Chen S. Roseman A.M. Hunter A.S. Wood S.P. Burston S.G. Ranson N.A. Clarke A.R. Saibil H.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Classification of the reconstituted P-gp showed that >70% of the molecules represented the same view. This is consistent with previous reports that, following reconstitution, >80% of P-gp is in the same orientation (16Sharom F.J. Yu X. Chu J.W.K. Doige C.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Images of 25 individual particles with a high signal:noise ratio were aligned with respect to reference particles (18Frank J. Shimkin B. Dowse H. Ultramicroscopy. 1981; 6: 343-358Crossref Google Scholar) and then averaged to produce an initial projection map of the protein (Fig. 3 C). Further averaging with 135 particles generated the projection map shown in Fig. 3 F. Since the molecules are fixed in the dimension parallel to the membrane plane (33Holzenburg A. Ashley R. Ion Channels—A Practical Approach. IRL press, Oxford1995: 269-290Google Scholar), it is possible to use a relatively small number of molecules for the final average (25Frank J. Radermacher M. Wagenknecht T. Verschoor A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 64: 3-35Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The general structures of these two projections were very similar, although some detail was lost by averaging 135 particles due to increased variability in staining and imperfect rotational alignment of those particles with poorer signal:noise ratios. In this projection the protein is toroidal, with a ring of protein exhibiting hexagonal symmetry surrounding a 5-nm central pore. The intense staining of the pore with both uranyl acetate and sodium phosphotungstate implies it is aqueous. P-gp has a single glycosylation site at the extracellular face of the membrane, and lectin-gold labeling showed that this view corresponds to the face of the protein exposed extracellularly (see below). To obtain projections of other orientations of P-gp, detergent-solubilized protein was studied. Fig.2 B shows that the detergent-solubilized protein consists of an essentially homogeneous collection of 10–12-nm-diameter particles. The sizes of the solubilized and reconstituted particles were similar, showing that their oligomeric state is the same. As expected, and in contrast to the reconstituted protein, solubilized P-gp showed more than one orientation with respect to the grid support film. However, the particles were not randomly orientated because of differential association of different faces of the protein with the electrostatically charged grid surface (21van Heel M.

In α-toxin-permeabilized rabbit portal vein at pCa 6.5, the particulate hydrophobic fraction ofrhoA (10 ± 1.6% of the total) was significantly increased by phenylephrine to 18 ± 5.5% at 5 min, by AlF4− to 26 ± 8.4% at 20 min, and dose-dependently up to 62 ± 9.5% by guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPγS; 0.3–50 μm). Translocation ofrhoA was selective (Rac1 and Cdc42 were not translocated) and was quantitatively correlated (up to ∼50%; r = 0.91,p < 0.05) with Ca2+ sensitization; high GTPγS concentrations (≥10 μm) further increased translocation without increasing force. The initial recruitment ofrhoA to the membrane paralleled the time course of contraction, but sensitization could be reversed without a decrease in particulate rhoA. High [Ca2+] (pCa 4.5) also increased particulate rhoA to 31 ± 5.8%. Membrane-associated rhoA in unstimulated portal vein was a good substrate for in vitroADP-ribosylation, whereas the large amount translocated by GTPγS was not. We conclude that 1) translocation of rhoA plays a causal role in Ca2+ sensitization, and 2) membrane-boundrhoA can exist in two or more states.

Kobe J. Med. Sci. 1992; 38: 79-92PubMed Google Scholar) did not show significant Ca2+-sensitizing activity and even active (geranylgeranylated) p21rhoA failed to Ca2+-sensitize preparations heavily permeabilized with Triton X-100 (11Gong M.C.

A. 1996; 93: 1340-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), we suggested that association of p21rhoAwith the plasma membrane may be required for its Ca2+-sensitizing effect (11Gong M.C. Iizuka K. Nixon G. Browne J.P. Hall A. Eccleston J.F. Sugai M. Kobayashi S. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1340-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Recruitment of cytosolic proteins to the membrane is an important component of several other signaling systems, such as the Raf-Ras pathway (13Marshall C.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 127-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and protein kinase C cascades (conventional and novel) (14Hug H. Sarre T.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was to determine whether p21rhoA signaling of Ca2+sensitization also involves its translocation to the cell membranein vivo. We now show that GTPγS-induced translocation of p21rhoA is quantitatively and kinetically associated with Ca2+ sensitization of smooth muscle and provide evidence of more than one conformational state of membrane-associated p21rhoA. Small strips (200 μm wide and 3 mm long) of rabbit portal vein and ileum longitudinal smooth muscle were dissected, and isometric tension was measured as published (15Kitazawa T. Kobayashi S. Horiuti K. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5339-5342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kobayashi S. Kitazawa T. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol.

A minimum of 10 small (200 μm wide and 3 mm long) strips of rabbit portal vein or ileum longitudinal smooth muscle were used to provide sufficient protein for reliable separation of cytosolic and particulate fractions. Stimulated and control strips were homogenized in ice-cold homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)bezenesulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin) and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C (Optima™ TLX ultracentrifuge, TLA 120.1 rotor, Beckman Instruments), and the supernatant was collected as the cytosolic fraction. Pellets were resuspended, and membrane proteins were extracted by incubation for 30 min in homogenization buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1% sodium cholate or only 2% Triton X-114. The latter buffer was used to avoid the increase in the cloudy point of Triton X-114 by a second detergent. The extract was centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was collected and is referred to as the particulate fraction, and the pellet was collected and is referred to as the detergent-insoluble particulate fraction. Cytosolic, particulate, and detergent-insoluble particulate fraction proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Only the cytosolic and particulate p21rhoAproteins are shown in most of the figures, as no immunoblot-detectable p21rhoA was found in the detergent-insoluble particulate fraction. The absence of p21rhoA in the detergent-insoluble particulate fraction verified the completion of the extraction of membrane p21rhoA proteins and completion of homogenization. Prompt termination of the reaction in homogenization buffer was verified by the absence of translocation of p21rhoA when control strips were homogenized in GTPγS (50 μm)-containing homogenization buffer. Precondensed Triton X-114 stock solution was added to tissue homogenates or cytosolic fractions to a final concentration of ∼2%, and proteins were extracted by incubation for 30 min on ice with occasional mixing (18Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C; the pellet was solubilized in sample buffer; and proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to determine cellular proteins insoluble in nonionic detergent. The supernatant was collected in a fresh tube and warmed to 37 °C in a water bath until the solution became cloudy (for ∼5 min). Phase separation was achieved by centrifuging the solution in a tabletop centrifuge for 10 min at 800 × g at room temperature. The upper aqueous phase contains soluble proteins, and the lower, detergent-enriched phase contains proteins bearing hydrophobic domains. After transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, the membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h and then incubated with primary antibody for 3 h and secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Corp.) and quantitated by densitometry using a Bio-Rad GS-670 imaging densitometer. Optimal primary antibody concentration was determined by antibody titration (1:100, 1:500, 1:1000, and 1:5000) using a Mini-protein II multiscreen apparatus (Bio-Rad). Preliminary experiments established that the amount of protein loaded was within the range of linearity of the assays. The percent of particulate p21rhoA was calculated according to particulate p21rhoA/(particulate + cytosolic p21rhoA). Monoclonal anti-p21rhoA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) generated against amino acids 120–150 of human p21rhoA was used at a 1:2500 dilution. Polyclonal anti-Gαq/11, anti-Rac1, and anti-Cdc42 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) generated against amino acids 341–359 common to Gαq and Gα11, amino acids 178–191 of Rac1, and amino acids 166–182 of Cdc42 were used at 1:5000, 1:500 and 1:1000 dilutions, respectively. The detergent concentration and the volumes of cytosolic and particulate fractions were adjusted to identical values, and the following reagents were added: 200 μmGTP, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm thymidine, and 1 μg/ml Clostridium botulinum exoenzyme C3. After initiation of ADP-ribosylation by addition of [32P]NAD (final concentration of 50 μCi/ml), the mixture (total volume of 100 μl) was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by trichloroacetic acid (24%, 250 μl) and deoxycholate (2%, 6 μl), and the final volume was adjusted to 1 ml with water. After centrifugation (5000 × g, 10 min), the supernatant was carefully removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of 2 × sample buffer. 10 μl of 1 m Tris base was added to neutralize the pH. Samples were heated at 85 °C for 5 min, and the proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. ADP-ribosylation of p21rhoA in β-escin-permeabilized strips was carried out as described previously (11Gong M.C. Iizuka K. Nixon G. Browne J.P. Hall A. Eccleston J.F. Sugai M. Kobayashi S.

Details of the solutions used for study of permeabilized strips were described previously (15Kitazawa T. Kobayashi S. Horiuti K. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol.

(Campbell, CA). GTPγS was from Boehringer (Mannheim, Germany). ADP-ribosyltransferase C3, tautomycin, and A23187 were from Calbiochem. [32P]NAD (30 Ci/mmol) was from DuPont NEN. Statistical comparisons were made using Student's t test; all values are given as mean ± S.E. Phenylephrine (PE; 100 μm) plus GTP (10 μm) increased force from 13 ± 1.1% (n = 18) to 41 ± 5.4% (n = 6,p < 0.001) of the maximal Ca2+-induced contraction in α-toxin-permeabilized rabbit portal vein strips at constant free Ca2+ (pCa 6.5). Such contractions are the result of increased MLC20 phosphorylation (2Kitazawa T. Masuo M. Somlyo A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9307-9310Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 4Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Nature. 1994; 372: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). Force development was accompanied by translocation of p21rhoAfrom the cytosol to the particulate fraction. The particulate fraction contained 10 ± 1.6% (n = 23) of the total p21rhoA in control pCa 6.5 solution, increasing to 18 ± 5.5% (n = 9, p < 0.05) upon stimulation with PE plus GTP (Fig.1 A). GTPγS translocated p21rhoA from the cytosol to the particulate fraction in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1 B; r = 0.9995, p < 0.001) from 10 ± 1.6% (n = 23) to 21 ± 4.2% (n = 8; 0.3 μm), to 31 ± 3.7% (n = 6; 1 μm), to 50 ± 6.9% (n = 2; 10 μm), and 62 ± 9.5% (n = 4; 50 μm). The translocation of p21rhoA induced by GTPγS was accompanied by Ca2+sensitization of force from 13% ± 1.1% (n = 18;pCa 6.5) to 33 ± 4.7% (n = 6; 0.3 μm), to 49 ± 2.8% (n = 10; 1 μm), to 62 ± 2.1% (n = 8; 10 μm), and to 64 ± 1.4% (n = 8; 50 μm), respectively. If PE-induced activation and translocation of p21rhoA mediates Ca2+ sensitization in portal vein smooth muscle, then ADP-ribosylation of p21rhoA would be expected to inhibit this effect (see the Introduction). ADP-ribosylation of p21rhoA with C3 (see “Materials and Methods”) (19Narumiya S. Morii N. Cell. Signalling. 1993; 5: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 20Aktories K. Hall A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1989; 10: 415-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) significantly inhibited the Ca2+ sensitization of force in β-escin-permeabilized rabbit portal vein by PE plus GTP from 38 ± 3.1% (n = 3) to 7 ± 0.7% (n = 3,p < 0.01) and by GTPγS (50 μm) from 52 ± 2.8% (n = 3) to 33 ± 2.0% (n = 3, p < 0.05). Several agonists acting on receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G-protein can both activate the phosphatidylinositol cascade and cause Ca2+ sensitization, as does AlF4−, an agent previously thought to activate heterotrimeric, but not monomeric, G-proteins (21Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15595-15597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, recently, we (11Gong M.C. Iizuka K. Nixon G. Browne J.P. Hall A. Eccleston J.F. Sugai M. Kobayashi S. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1340-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) and others (9Fujita A. Takeuchi T. Nakajima H. Nishio H. Hata F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 274: 555-561PubMed Google Scholar) observed that ADP-ribosylation of endogenous p21rhoA also inhibited Ca2+sensitization of force by AlF4−. Therefore, we determined whether AlF4−also translocated p21rhoA in portal vein. AlF4− (10 mm NaF + 30 μm AlCl3, 20 min) increased force from 13 ± 1.1% (n = 18) to 53 ± 3.1% (n = 4) of the maximal Ca2+-induced contraction and particulate p21rhoA from the control value of 10 ± 1.6% (n = 23) to 26 ± 8.4% (n = 4, p < 0.01) (Fig.1 A). As shown in Fig. 1 A, the translocation of p21rhoA, up to 50%, was quantitatively correlated (r = 0.91,p < 0.05) with Ca2+ sensitization of force induced by agonist (PE plus GTP), AlF4−, and various concentrations of GTPγS. Higher concentrations (≥10 μm) of GTPγS caused further translocation of p21rhoA without further increase in force, indicating a “ceiling effect.” To ascertain whether the observed translocation is α-adrenergic receptor-specific, we also determined the effect of a muscarinic agonist on the localization of p21rhoA in permeabilized ileum smooth muscles. Surprisingly, a high percentage (61 ± 6.8%,n = 14) of p21rhoA was located in the particulate fraction of unstimulated ileum. This high basal level of particulate p21rhoA was not due to Ca2+(submaximal, pCa 6.5) because 59 ± 1.4% (n = 2) of p21rhoA was particulate even at cytoplasmic [Ca2+] <pCa 8 (no free Ca2+ added, 10 mm EGTA present). In contrast, inclusion of the muscarinic antagonist atropine (10 μm) during and following dissection decreased particulate p21rhoAto 28 ± 11.6% (n = 6, p < 0.05). This significant decrease in particulate p21rhoA by a highly specific muscarinic antagonist indicates that acetylcholine released from nerve endings in the richly innervated ileum causes translocation of p21rhoA to the particulate fraction and that such translocation is not limited to the action of α-adrenergic agonists. To determine the specificity of translocation of p21rhoA by GTPγS, we also determined the distribution of two other Rho family proteins, Rac1 and Cdc42, under conditions identical to those used for determining the partitioning of p21rhoA. GTPγS (50 μm, 20 min) (Fig.2) had no significant effect on the amount of either Rac1 or Cdc42 present in the particulate fraction: 46 ± 2.9% (n = 5) of Rac1 and 14 ± 4.1% (n= 5) of Cdc42 in pCa 6.5 solution and 47 ± 4.2% (n = 6, p > 0.005) of Rac1 and 19 ± 4.8% (n = 6, p > 0.05) of Cdc42 after stimulation with GTPγS. Unlike p21rhoA and Cdc42, which were not detected in the detergent-insoluble particulate fraction, 23 ± 7.0% (n = 5) of Rac1 was in the detergent-insoluble particulate fraction, and this fraction was also not changed by GTPγS (25 ± 5.7%, n = 6,p > 0.05). To determine whether the return of p21rhoA from the particulate to the cytosolic fraction is required for the reversal of Ca2+sensitization, the distribution of p21rhoA after “washout” of the agonist was determined. After increasing the steady-statepCa 6.5-induced contraction by PE plus GTP from 7 ± 2.2% (n = 3) to 32 ± 1.2% (n = 3, p < 0.001), the muscles were transferred into relaxing solution (no added Ca2+, PE, or GTP and containing 1 mm EGTA) and exchanged three times for a total of 25 min. At this time, the pCa 6.5-induced contraction was not significantly different from before exposure to PE plus GTP (9 ± 0.6%, n = 3), indicating that the muscles were no longer Ca2+-sensitized, but 21 ± 4.6% (n = 9) of p21rhoA still remained in the particulate fraction; this was not significantly different from that found in the presence of PE (18 ± 5.5%, n = 9, 5 min, p > 0.05). Even when strips were washed in 10 mm EGTA-containing solution for 60 min, the translocated p21rhoA remained in the particulate fraction (data not shown). The time courses of GTPγS-induced potentiation of force and translocation of p21rhoA were determined to evaluate whether they were kinetically consistent with the potential role of p21rhoA as a mediator of agonist-induced Ca2+ sensitization. As shown in Fig. 3 (A and B), within 1 min following addition of GTPγS to permeabilized portal vein smooth muscle at pCa 6.5, force reached 21 ± 4.2% (n = 10) of the maximal GTPγS-induced contraction; this was accompanied by translocation of p21rhoA to the particulate fraction, increasing from the control value of 10 ± 1.6% (n = 23) to 32 ± 9.7% (n = 6, p < 0.0001). Thus, within the time resolution of this study, the kinetics of translocation of p21rhoA were consistent with its role in GTPγS-induced Ca2+sensitization of force. However, the later time course of GTPγS-induced p21rhoA translocation was slower than that of force development: contraction peaked at 5 min, at which time ∼51 ± 4% (n = 6) of p21rhoA was in the particulate fraction, whereas p21rhoA continued to translocate, reaching its peak of 62 ± 9.5% (n = 4) at 20 min, consistent with the ceiling effect in the translocation-force relationship (Fig. 1 A). We also determined the time course of translocation of Gαq/11, the heterotrimeric G-protein implicated in the activation of phospholipase C, a major contributor to pharmacomechanical coupling in smooth muscle (reviewed in Ref. 4Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Nature. 1994; 372: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). Under control conditions (pCa 6.5), 86 ± 1.7% (n = 25) of the total Gαq/11 was in the particulate fraction, and this was reduced by GTPγS to 60 ± 12% (n = 6, p < 0.01) at 1 min and 70 ± 8.8% (n = 6, p < 0.05) at 5 min (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast to p21rhoA, the translocation of Gαq/11 was transient: by 60 min, the previously translocated protein had returned to the particulate fraction (Fig. 3, A andB). The hydrophobic domain of cytosolic, geranylgeranylated p21rhoA is masked by bound Rho-GDI, and activated p21rhoA is thought to bind to the cell membrane through the unmasked hydrophobic geranylgeranyl group exposed by the release of Rho-GDI (22Mohr C.

Because the particulate fraction obtained through centrifugation may contain both hydrophobic (membrane) and nonhydrophobic (e.g.cytoskeletal) components, we determined by phase separation with Triton X-114 whether the p21rhoA translocated to the particulate fraction by GTPγS in vivo was hydrophobic, as indicated by partitioning into Triton X-114. Indeed, GTPγS (50 μm, 30 min) increased the fraction of p21rhoA partitioned into the detergent phase when whole homogenates were treated with Triton X-114. p21rhoA in the Triton X-114 phase increased from the control value of 22 ± 6.6% (n = 11) to 81 ± 1.8% (n = 6, p < 0.0001), indicating that most of the particulate p21rhoA was associated with hydrophobic (presumably membrane) components. To further evaluate whether cytosolic p21rhoA (complexed with Rho-GDI) is hydrophilic, whereas particulate p21rhoA is hydrophobic, the whole homogenate was first separated into cytosolic and particulate fractions, which were subsequently phase-separated with Triton X-114 (see “Materials and Methods”). As shown in Fig.4, only 5 ± 1.8% (n = 9) of the cytosolic p21rhoA partitioned into the Triton X-114 phase. In contrast, most of the particulate p21rhoA partitioned into the Triton X-114 phase, with only 7 ± 2.5% (n = 8) partitioning into the aqueous phase. Again, there was a dramatic increase from 11 ± 8.6% (n = 3) to 63 ± 13.5% (n = 3, p < 0.05) in the amount of p21rhoA in the Triton X-114-treated particulate fraction of GTPγS (50 μm, 20 min)-stimulated muscles. The small quantities of cytosolic p21rhoA partitioning into the Triton X-114 phase and particulate p21rhoA partitioning into the aqueous phase may result from “carryover” during the experimental procedure. The cytosolic and particulate fractions of control and GTPγS-stimulated tissues were incubated with C3 and [32P]NAD (see “Materials and Methods”) to determine if the translocated p21rhoA is a good substrate for C3-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation. In unstimulated strips, the largely cytosolic p21rhoA (Figs. 1, 2, and 5) was only minimally ADP-ribosylated; a very faint band was detected in the autoradiograph (Fig. 5, upper left panel), whereas the very small amount of particulate p21rhoA was highly ADP-ribosylated (lower left panel). This is consistent with previous results showing that cytosolic p21rhoA is complexed with Rho-GDI and that the complex is a poor substrate for C3-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation (23Bourmeyster N. Stasia M.-J. Garin J. Gagnon J. Boquet P. Vignais P.V. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12863-12869Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 24Fritz G. Lang P. Just I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1222: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), but becomes a better substrate after its dissociation from Rho-GDI. In contrast, the large amount of particulate p21rhoAin GTPγS-stimulated tissues (Figs. 1, 2, 3 and 5) was only minimally ADP-ribosylated (Fig. 5, right panels). This lower level of ADP-ribosylation of particulate p21rhoA in GTPγS-stimulated strips was not due to the loss of a membrane component to the cytosol because ADP-ribosylation was significantly less even in total tissue homogenates containing both cytosolic and particulate fractions of GTPγS-treated tissue compared with controls (data not shown), and cytosolic p21rhoA in GTPγS-stimulated tissue was still not a good substrate for ADP-ribosylation (Fig. 5, right panels). This was also not the result of reassociation with Rho-GDI because the latter was not detectable in any of the particulate fractions. These results suggest that membrane-associated p21rhoA exists in at least two states: a resting state that is a good substrate and an activated (and/or inactivated; see “Discussion”) state that is a poor substrate for C3-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation. To determine whether Ca2+ alone can induce translocation of p21rhoA, α-toxin-permeabilized rabbit portal vein strips were incubated in Ca2+-free solution (no Ca2+ added and containing 10 mm EGTA) for 15 min, homogenized, and fractionated. The particulate fraction under this Ca2+-free condition contained 9 ± 3.0% (n = 6) of the total p21rhoA, which is not significantly different from strips incubated in pCa 6.5 solution: 10 ± 1.6% (n = 23, p > 0.05). However, increasing Ca2+ to very high levels (pCa 4.5, 15 min) increased the p21rhoA content of the particulate fraction to 31 ± 5.8% (n = 10, p < 0.01). This translocation of p21rhoA induced by pCa 4.5 was not due to the release of norepinephrine from nerve endings because inclusion of the α-adrenergic blocker prazosin (10 μm) in the solutions during permeabilization and thereafter had no effect on the pCa 4.5-induced translocation of p21rhoA to the particulate fraction (39 ± 6.9%, n = 8, p > 0.05). To exclude the possibility that the translocation of p21rhoA bypCa 4.5 was due to trapping of cytosolic p21rhoA in the cytoskeletal components of the contracted tissue, cytosolic and particulate fractions of pCa 4.5-stimulated tissues were phase-separated by Triton X-114. Similar to the GTPγS-stimulated tissues, 89 ± 8.6% (n = 3) of p21rhoA in the particulate fraction (29.0 ± 13.9% (n = 3) of the total p21rhoA) was partitioned into the Triton X-114 phase, suggesting that high [Ca2+] alone can translocate p21rhoA to the membrane. To determine whether p21rhoA translocated by high [Ca2+] returns to the cytosol after removal of Ca2+, portal vein strips stimulated with pCa 4.5 for 15 min were washed five times in Ca2+-free solution (no Ca2+ added and containing 10 mm EGTA) for a total of 60 min, and the distribution of p21rhoA was determined. Even after this extensive wash, the same amount (38 ± 2%, n = 3) of translocated p21rhoA remained in the particulate fraction. The Ca2+ dependence of GTPγS-induced translocation of p21rhoA was also determined by adding GTPγS to α-toxin-permeabilized smooth muscle in the presence and absence of Ca2+. GTPγS (50 μm, 60 min) caused similar p21rhoA translocation in Ca2+-free, 10 mm EGTA-containing solution as in pCa 6.5 solution: p21rhoA in the particulate fraction was 65 ± 6.9% (n = 6) versus 62 ± 9.5% (n = 4, p > 0.05), respectively. Tautomycin, a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, (25MacKintosh C. Klumpp S. FEBS Lett. 1990; 277: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) causes substantial MLC20 phosphorylation and smooth muscle contraction even in the absence of Ca2+ (26Gong M.C. Cohen P.

We also wished to localize p21rhoA in tautomycin-stimulated tissues to determine whether phosphorylation of a protein that can be dephosphorylated by phosphatase 1 or 2A is involved in regulating translocation of p21rhoA. No significant translocation of p21rhoA was detected in tautomycin-stimulated tissue at pCa 6.5 (data not shown), although it caused 86 ± 6.3% (n = 3) of the maximal Ca2+-induced contraction. The relationships between the extent and time course of translocation of p21rhoA to the particulate fraction (Figs. 1and 3) and enhancement of force at constant [Ca2+] are consistent with a causal role of p21rhoA recruitment to the membrane in Ca2+"

In a cytoplasmic extract from HeLa cells, the poly(A) tail of mRNA was degraded from the 3′-end. In agreement with earlierin vivo observations, prominent decay intermediates differed in length by about 30 nucleotides. The Mg2+-dependent, poly(A)-specific 3′-exoribonuclease responsible for this poly(A) shortening activity was purified from calf thymus. A polypeptide of 74 kDa copurified with the activity. The deadenylating nuclease (DAN) required a free 3′-OH group, released solely 5′-AMP, degraded RNA in a distributive fashion, and preferred poly(A) as a substrate. At low salt concentration, the activity of purified DAN was strongly dependent on spermidine or other, yet unidentified factors. Under these reaction conditions, DAN was also stimulated by the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein I (PAB I). At physiological salt concentration, the stimulatory effect of spermidine was weak and PAB I was inhibitory. At either salt concentration DAN and PAB I reconstituted poly(A) shortening with the same pattern of intermediates seen in cytoplasmic extract. The properties of DAN suggest that the enzyme might be involved in the deadenylation of mRNA in vivo. 3′-Exonucleolytic removal of the poly(A) tail is the first and often rate-limiting step in the decay of many eucaryotic mRNAs.

The properties of DAN suggest that the enzyme might be involved in the deadenylation of mRNA in vivo. Gene expression depends on the concentration of mRNA, which in turn is determined by the ratio of transcription and turnover. Each mRNA has its own specific half-life, which can sometimes be altered in response to internal or external signals. Rapid degradation is particularly important for mRNAs encoding proteins that are only transiently required, like those of the early response to serum stimulation (1Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Schiavi S.C. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1114: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Whereas it is obvious that mRNA instability is essential for a quick shut-off of protein synthesis after transient transcription, a closer look reveals that a short mRNA half-life also favors rapid induction (1Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In yeast, a pathway of decay has been described that is common to many mRNAs, both stable and unstable (3Muhlrad D. Decker C.J. Parker R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2145-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 4Muhlrad D. Decker C.J. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 855-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 5Caponigro G. Parker R. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 233-249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Degradation is initiated by shortening of the poly(A) tail. Only after the poly(A) tail has been shortened to 15 nucleotides or less is the 5′-cap removed. Cap removal exposes the mRNA to a 5′-3′-exonuclease. Certain sequences within the RNA determine the rate of poly(A) shortening (6Decker C.J. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1632-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 7Muhlrad D. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2100-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Mutations in these sequences lead to altered rates of deadenylation and often to corresponding changes in mRNA half-life (5Caponigro G. Parker R. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 233-249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, deadenylation is not only the first step in mRNA decay, but can be rate-limiting (5Caponigro G. Parker R. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 233-249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Jacobson A. Peltz S.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 693-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). In yeast, poly(A) tail removal requires the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein I (PAB I). 1The abbreviations used are: PAB I, poly(A)-binding protein I; PAB II, poly(A)-binding protein II; DAN, deadenylating nuclease; PAN, poly(A) nuclease. In strains lacking PAB I, the steady state population of mRNA has longer poly(A) tails compared with wild type cells (9Sachs A.B. Davis R.W. Cell. 1989; 58: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The PGK1 and MFA2 mRNAs are deadenylated only after a lag phase, and 3- and 6-fold more slowly, respectively, in these mutants (10Caponigro G. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2421-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Extracts prepared from Δpab1 strains do not degrade poly(A) (11Sachs A.B. Deardorff J.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 961-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Addition of recombinant PAB I restores deadenylation. A Mg2+-dependent poly(A)-specific 3′-exonuclease (poly(A) nuclease (PAN)) requiring PAB I for its activity has been purified. The enzyme contains two polypeptides of 76 and 127 kDa (11Sachs A.B. Deardorff J.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 961-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 12Lowell J.E. Rudner D.Z. Sachs A.B.

Biol. 1996; 16: 5744-5753Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). At low salt concentration, PAN does not attack naked poly(A). The requirement for a RNA-binding cofactor can be satisfied not only by PAB I but also by spermidine (12Lowell J.E. Rudner D.Z. Sachs A.B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2088-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). At high salt concentration, PAN has a PAB I- and spermidine-independent activity. It is not yet clear whether PAN is the enzyme responsible for deadenylation in vivo (14Brown C.E. Tarun S.Z. Boeck R. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5744-5753Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Enzymes that catalyze decapping and 5′-exonucleolytic decay have also been purified, and genes encoding them have been cloned (5Caponigro G. Parker R. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 233-249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Jacobson A. Peltz S.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 693-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). In higher eucaryotes, the mechanism of mRNA decay is less clear. However, for many mRNAs it has been shown that poly(A) removal precedes the decay of the mRNA body (1Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Schiavi S.C. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1114: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 15Wilson T. Treisman R. Nature. 1988; 336: 396-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). As in yeast, mutations in the 3′-untranslated region or the coding region can change the rate of deadenylation and the mRNA half-life (8Jacobson A. Peltz S.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 693-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). While deadenylation is usually the prelude to degradation, this is not necessarily the case. In animal oocytes, deadenylation is used to stop the translation of certain mRNAs. The deadenylated RNAs are stored inactive but intact and may even be readenylated and used again at a later time (16Curtis J. Lehmann R. Zamore P.D. Cell. 1995; 81: 171-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 17Wickens M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 320-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The enzymology of mRNA decay, and in particular of deadenylation, in higher eucaryotes is unknown. It is also uncertain which role PAB I plays in deadenylation. Depletion of PAB I from a cell extract promoted rapid deadenylation and decay of mRNA (18Bernstein P. Peltz S.W. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 659-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Thus, it was suggested that, in contrast to the situation in yeast, PAB I in mammalian cells inhibits mRNA decay by protecting the poly(A) tail. However, since the experiments were carried out in vitro, it is not certain whether the nuclease degrading the poly(A) tail was the same that is responsible for this process in vivo. Overexpression of PAB I in Xenopus oocytes protected mRNA from deadenylation, again suggesting that PAB I may inhibit poly(A) removal rather than promote it (19Wormington M. Searfoss A.M. Hurney C.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 900-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, since deadenylation is used for the purpose of translational control in oocytes and is not followed by complete degradation of the RNA, it is not clear whether the deadenylation reaction in oocytes is the same as in somatic cells. So far, nucleases responsible for poly(A) tail removal have not been identified unequivocally in higher eucaryotes. A poly(A)-specific 3′-exoribonuclease has been partially purified from HeLa cell nuclear extract (20Astrom J. Astrom A. Virtanen A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3067-3071Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 21Astrom J. Astrom A. Virtanen A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18154-18159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A mammalian, polysome-associated 3′-exoribonuclease of 33 kDa has been purified to apparent homogeneity. This nuclease is able to degrade poly(A), but it is not poly(A)-specific. The enzyme is inhibited by yeast PAB I (22Caruccio N. Ross J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31814-31821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several authors have reported a periodic distribution of poly(A) tail lengths in vivo with prominent species differing in length by 25–30 nucleotides. Such a distribution was described in the steady state population of globin mRNA (23Kelly J.M. Cox R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 4173-4179Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 24Krowczynska A. Brawerman G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 397-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Mansbridge J.N. Crossley J.A. Lanyon W.G. Williamson R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 44: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and, less pronounced, also in mRNAs for epidermal growth factor and glyceraldehyde-3′-phosphate dehydrogenase (26Sheflin L.G. Brooks M.E. Keegan B.P. Spaulding S.W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2085-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 27Stoeckle M. Guan L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1613-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Similar molecules were identified as deadenylation intermediates of the gro-α cytokine mRNA (27Stoeckle M. Guan L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1613-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A regular periodic distribution of intermediates of poly(A) tail shortening can also be seen in an analysis of c-fos mRNA (15Wilson T. Treisman R. Nature. 1988; 336: 396-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), although the particular type of experiment carried out precluded an assignment of poly(A) tail lengths. PAB I covers about 27 nucleotides when bound to poly(A) (28Baer W.B. Kornberg R.D. J. Cell. Biol. 1983; 96: 717-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Therefore, the periodicity most probably reflects the binding properties of PAB I. We report here that, in a cytoplasmic extract of HeLa cells, the poly(A) tail is shortened from the 3′-end. The population of deadenylation intermediates has a length periodicity of about 30 nucleotides. We have purified a poly(A)-specific 3′-exoribonuclease from calf thymus. Deadenylation of mRNA fragments by the purified nuclease in the presence of PAB I results in the same periodic pattern of intermediates as seen in cytoplasmic extracts and in vivo. Poly(A), poly(U), poly(dA) (Boehringer Mannheim), and poly(C) (Sigma) were 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). 3′-Labeling of poly(A) was carried out as follows; 8.6 pmol of size-fractionated poly(A) (about 350 nucleotides long) was incubated with 50 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and 1.9 μg of yeast poly(A) polymerase for 30–40 min under reaction conditions for unspecific polyadenylation (30Lingner J. Radtke I. Wahle E. Keller W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8741-8746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the preparation of homogeneously labeled poly(A), 156 pmol of oligo(A) primers, about 30 nucleotides in length, were incubated with 25 nmol of ATP, 50–100 μCi of [α-32P]ATP, and 1.9 μg of yeast poly(A) polymerase for 30–40 min. 5′-Labeled poly(A) with either a 3′-OH group or a mixture of 2′- and 3′-phosphates was prepared as follows; 5′-labeled poly(A) was partially hydrolyzed in 0.2 n NaOH for 5 and 10 min at 37 °C. The samples were neutralized by the addition of 1/3 volume of 1 m Hepes, pH 5.5, combined, and ethanol-precipitated. Cyclic phosphates were opened in 0.2n HCl. The RNA was ethanol-precipitated, and one half (about 3–5 pmol) was dephosphorylated with the 3′-phosphatase activity of T4 polynucleotide kinase (20 units) in the buffer supplied by the manufacturer. These substrates were loaded onto a polyacrylamide gel, and poly(A) smaller than the starting material was gel-purified. Other RNAs were derived from the plasmids pSP6L3pre and pSP6glob. pSP6L3pre contains the L3 polyadenylation signal of the adenovirus 2 major late transcription unit, which is truncated one nucleotide upstream of its natural poly(A) addition site (31Christofori G. Keller W. Cell. 1988; 54: 875-889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The plasmid pSP6glob is a pGEM3 transcription-vector (Promega) carrying a 187-base pair insert from the 3′-end of the human β-globin gene. The insert starts at the EcoRI site in the coding region and stops at the polyadenylation signal (AAUAAA) in the 3′-untranslated region (32Lawn R.M. Efstratiadis A. O'Connell C. Maniatis T. Cell. 1980; 21: 647-651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). This insert was derived from the plasmid pbE (kindly provided by N. J. Proudfoot, University of Oxford) by polymerase chain reaction amplification as follows. Primers were constructed converting theEcoRI site of the third β-globin exon into aBamHI site and introducing an EcoRI site at the polyadenylation signal (AAUAAA). This fragment was ligated into theBamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEM3. Plasmid pSP6L3pre was linearized with RsaI and pSP6glob withEcoRI. Capped, uniformly α-32P-labeled RNAs were obtained by in vitro transcription of the linearized template DNAs with SP6 RNA polymerase in the presence of 7-methyl-G(5′)ppp(5′)G and 50 μCi of [α-32P]ATP as described (33Rüegsegger U. Beyer K. Keller W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6107-6113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), except that the total ATP concentration was 0.05 or 0.1 mm and the UTP concentration 0.5 mm. Polyadenylated transcripts were prepared by the addition of an unlabeled poly(A) tail with yeast poly(A) polymerase. Enzyme (1.1 μg) was used for 1–2.5 pmol of RNA at 30 °C for 30–60 min under conditions of nonspecific polyadenylation (30Lingner J. Radtke I. Wahle E. Keller W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8741-8746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With the exception of homogeneously labeled poly(A) used for the trichloroacetic acid precipitation assay, all RNA substrates were gel-purified as follows. RNA was separated in a polyacrylamide-urea gel. A gel piece containing the desired RNA was cut out and incubated in 500 μl of elution buffer (500 mm ammonium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1% (v/v) phenol) at 37 °C overnight. The eluted RNAs were extracted once with phenol/chloroform (1:1) and ethanol-precipitated. PAB I was purified from calf thymus as described (34Wahle E. Lustig A. Jenö P. Maurer P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2937-2945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A monoclonal antibody (10E10) directed against human PAB I was a gift from M. Görlach and G. Dreyfuss (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia). Purified recombinant yeast poly(A) polymerase containing six histidines at the N terminus was a gift from P. Preker (Biozentrum, University of Basel), and HeLa cell cytoplasmic extract was kindly provided by U. Rüegsegger (Biozentrum, University of Basel). Cytoplasmic extract was prepared from HeLa cell homogenates made according to Wahle and Keller (35Wahle E. Keller W. Hames B.D. Higgins S.J. RNA Processing: A Practical Approach. II/sb:volume-nr>. Oxford University Press, New York1994: 1-34Google Scholar). After pelleting of the nuclei, the supernatant was mixed with 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.02% (v/v) Nonidet-P40, and 0.5 mmdithiothreitol and used as cytoplasmic extract. SP6 RNA polymerase and calf intestinal phosphatase were from Boehringer Mannheim. T4 polynucleotide kinase and acetylated bovine serum albumin were from New England Biolabs. Terminal nucleotidyltransferase was from MBI Fermentas, S1 nuclease from U. S. Biochemical Corp., pepstatin from Fluka, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride from Merck. Ammonium sulfate (ultraPURE™) was from Life Technologies, Inc. DEAE-Sepharose FF and FPLC columns were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Blue Sepharose was the same as described previously (36Bienroth S. Wahle E. Suter-Crazzolara C. Keller W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19768-19776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heparin-Sepharose was prepared according to Ref. 37Pirrotta V. Bickle T.A.

Leupeptin hemisulfate, heparin (H-7005), and polynucleotide phosphorylase (P-1384) were from Sigma. Poly(A) degrading activity was routinely assayed by the release of trichloroacetic acid-soluble products from homogeneously labeled poly(A) (modified from Ref. 12Lowell J.E. Rudner D.Z. Sachs A.B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2088-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In assays used to monitor the purification, up to 5 μl of protein sample was mixed at room temperature with 50 μl of reaction buffer 1 (5 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.02% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.3 mm spermidine), containing 5 ng of homogeneously labeled poly(A) and 1 μg of unlabeled poly(A) of heterogeneous size. The reaction was started by the addition of the protein sample and immediate incubation at 37 °C for 15 min and quenched by the addition of 150 μl of cold 13.3% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min in a microcentrifuge. 100 μl of the supernatant was added to a mixture of 100 μl of 1 m Tris base and 2 ml of scintillation mixture (Quick Safe A, Zinsser Analytik, Frankfurt, Germany). The amount of radioactive nucleotides released was determined by scintillation counting. One unit was defined as the activity that releases 1 nmol of nucleotides/min. To ensure that the measurements were in the linear range of the assay, the nuclease was diluted such that no more than 10% of the substrate was degraded. After improvement of the reaction conditions for the purified nuclease, the following components of reaction buffer 1 were changed: 20 mm Hepes, pH 6.8, 1 mm MgAc, 2 mm spermidine (reaction buffer 2). Deadenylation reactions with polyadenylated mRNA fragments were assembled at room temperature as follows; 25 μl of reaction buffer 2 lacking spermidine was mixed with 2–10 fmol of polyadenylated capped L3pre or globin RNA and 4 units RNA guard (Pharmacia). Salt concentrations were as indicated. PAB I or spermidine was added to final concentrations of 0.3–11.5 nm or 2 mm, respectively, as indicated, and the reaction mix was prewarmed at 37 °C. The reaction was started by the addition of nuclease or HeLa cell cytoplasmic extract. At different times reactions were stopped with 50 μl of 2 × proteinase K buffer (0.2 m Tris HCl, pH 7.9, 0.3 m NaCl, 25 mm EDTA, 2% (w/v) SDS), and 25 μl of water containing 20 μg of proteinase K, 5 μg of glycogen, and 2 μg of rRNA. After incubation for at least 30 min at 37 °C, the RNA was precipitated with ethanol, dissolved in formamide loading buffer, heated for 2 min at 95 °C, and analyzed on sequencing gels (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The gels were either exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film or analyzed with a phosphorimager (Fuji BAS 1000). The decay of poly(A) and poly(U) was analyzed as follows; 5–230 fmol of radioactively labeled homopolymer was added to 50 μl of reaction buffer 2. The reaction was started by the addition of nuclease and incubation at 37 °C. Aliquots were mixed with an equal volume of formamide loading buffer, heated for 2 min at 95 °C, and applied directly to a sequencing gel. In an analysis of the decay direction, aliquots of 5 μl were mixed with 1 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. 2 μl were mixed with loading buffer and applied to a sequencing gel. The residual 4 μl were mixed with 200 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid, and trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactive nucleotides were measured. In tests of substrate specificity, the decay of poly(A) and other homopolymers was analyzed as follows; 60 fmol of 5′-labeled homopolymers were added to 50 μl of reaction buffer 2. Reactions were started by the addition of nuclease and incubation at 37 °C. They were stopped with 50 μl of 2 × proteinase K buffer containing proteinase K, glycogen, and rRNA and analyzed on gels as described above. Routine protein determinations were done by the method of Bradford (38Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Purified protein was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Products of poly(A) decay reactions were analyzed by polyethyleneimine thin-layer chromatography as described (22Caruccio N. Ross J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31814-31821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purification was carried out at or close to 4 °C. Between purification steps, the samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The following buffer was used: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.4 μg/ml leupeptin hemisulfate, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (added fresh before use), and 0.02% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. KCl concentrations indicated for individual steps always refer to KCl in this buffer. Extract was prepared from 1.2 kg of calf thymus in 50 mmKCl as described (40Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3131-3139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crude extract was applied to a 4-liter DEAE-Sepharose FF column, which was washed with 50 mm KCl and eluted with a gradient (2.5 column volumes) from 50 to 600 mm KCl at 3 liters/h. Active fractions, eluted from 75 to 200 mm KCl, were pooled, adjusted to 30% saturation with solid ammonium sulfate, and stirred for 1.5 h on ice. After centrifugation (30 min, 10,800 × g max), the supernatant was adjusted to 50% saturation with solid ammonium sulfate and again stirred on ice and centrifuged. The 50% ammonium sulfate pellet was resuspended in 400 ml of 50 mm KCl, dialyzed for 10 h against 2 × 4.5 liters of 50 mm KCl and clarified by centrifugation. A 1.4-liter blue Sepharose column (7 × 36 cm) was equilibrated with 50 mm KCl, and the dialyzed 50% ammonium sulfate precipitate was applied. The column was washed with 1.5 bed volumes of 250 mm KCl and eluted with 1 bed volume of 1 m KCl at 2 liters/h. At this point, active fractions from two preparations, from 1.2 kg of tissue each, were combined and concentrated by precipitation with 60% ammonium sulfate. After centrifugation the pellet was resuspended in 200 ml of 50 mm KCl, dialyzed for 12 h against 3 × 4 liters of the same buffer, divided, and each half was applied separately to a 115-ml heparin-Sepharose column (2.5 × 37 cm), equilibrated with 50 mm KCl. The column was washed with 1.5 bed volumes of 50 mm KCl and developed with a gradient (10 bed volumes) from 50 to 500 mm KCl at 145 ml/h. DAN activity eluted in a broad peak from 80 to 150 mm KCl. Active fractions were pooled and dialyzed for 4 h against 30 mm KCl. The dialyzed pool was centrifuged, divided, and each half was loaded onto an 8-ml MonoQ FPLC column equilibrated with 50 mm KCl. The column was washed with two bed volumes 50 mm KCl and eluted with a 320-ml gradient from 50 to 500 mm KCl at 2.5 ml/min. DAN activity eluted in a sharp peak around 160 mm KCl. Active fractions from both columns were pooled (40 ml), dialyzed for 4 h against 2 liters of 30 mm KCl, centrifuged, and applied to a 1-ml MonoQ column, equilibrated with 50 mm KCl. DAN was step-eluted with 500 mm KCl at 0.9 ml/min. Four peak fractions were applied separately to a Superdex HR 10/30 FPLC column, equilibrated with 300 mm KCl, at 0.15 ml/min. Active fractions of three Superdex columns were pooled, adjusted to 25% saturation with solid ammonium sulfate and centrifuged. The supernatant was applied to a 1-ml phenyl-Superose FPLC column equilibrated with buffer containing 25% ammonium sulfate. The column was washed with 3 ml of buffer + 25% ammonium sulfate, 1 ml of buffer + 12.5% ammonium sulfate, and further developed with a gradient (15 bed volumes) from 12.5% to 0% ammonium sulfate, at 0.3 ml/min. DAN activity eluted around 8% ammonium sulfate (320 mm). Upon incubation in a cytoplasmic extract of HeLa cells, polyadenylated L3pre RNA suffered a shortening of the poly(A) tail. Predominant decay intermediates differed in length by about 30 nucleotides, and the shortest oligoadenylated RNAs produced during the reaction carried a poly(A) tail of about 15 nucleotides (Fig.1, panels A (lanes 7–11) andB). The amounts of fully deadenylated RNA that accumulated in these assays was variable but generally low. The same degradation pattern was observed at 10 or 100 mm KCl and with different concentrations of Mg2+. Upon fractionation of the extract by step elution from a DEAE-column (0.05, 0.17, 0.35, and 0.5m KCl steps), the deadenylating activity was found in the 0.17 m KCl fraction. Gel electrophoresis showed that this fraction generated the same pattern of deadenylation intermediates as the complete extract. The 0.17 m KCl step contained 75% of the total poly(A) degrading activity recovered from the column as determined by a precipitation assay that measures the release of trichloroacetic acid-soluble material from homogeneously32P-labeled poly(A) (data not shown). A Western blot revealed that the 0.17 m step also contained most of the PAB I present in the extract (data not shown). Based on these results and those described below, we attribute the decay pattern to the cofractionation of a deadenylating nuclease and PAB I. Calf thymus extract was employed for the purification of the deadenylating activity. Fractions were monitored for poly(A) degrading activity with a trichloroacetic acid precipitation assay. To suppress unspecific nucleolytic activity in initial assays, a 400-fold excess ofEscherichia coli rRNA was added to the homogeneously labeled poly(A) used as a substrate. Under these conditions, gradient elution of a DEAE-column revealed only a single activity peak eluted at around 0.12 m KCl (Fig. 2), likely corresponding to the activity identified in the 0.17 m step of the HeLa cell cytoplasmic extract. The poly(A) degrading activity could be slightly stimulated by spermidine (Fig. 2). A Western blot revealed that the PAB I peak was almost identical to the nuclease peak (data not shown). During the subsequent purification the activity was monitored with only poly(A) as a substrate, no rRNA was added. The purification is summarized in Table I. The poor recovery on heparin-Sepharose is unexplained. Mixing of the nuclease peak fractions with other fractions from the same column gave no evidence for removal of a stimulatory factor. The poly(A) degrading activity was purified about 130,000-fold. Inasmuch as the total activity increased in the first purification step, the purification factor is probably overestimated. A profile of the final phenyl-Superose column is shown in Fig. 3 A. A prominent band of about 74 kDa comigrated with the activity (Fig. 3 B). The same band was also associated with the activity on a MonoQ column. The poly(A) degrading activity was named DAN, for deadenylating nuclease.Table IPurification of the deadenylating nucleaseStepProteinActivitySpecific activityYieldPurificationmgunitsunits/mg%-foldExtract92,35046,0300.5100DEAE-Sepharose24,900130,6005.228410Ammonium sulfate precipitation11,250133,500122"
https://openalex.org/W2029521699,"The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor FLT-1 has been shown to be involved in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. The receptor is characterized by seven Ig-like loops within the extracellular domain. Upon VEGF binding FLT-1 becomes phosphorylated, which has been thought to be preceded by receptor dimerization. To further investigate high affinity binding of VEGF to FLT-1 and ligand-induced receptor dimerization, we expressed in Sf9 cells the entire extracellular domain comprising all seven Ig-like loops: sFLT-1(7) and several truncated mutants consisting of loop one, one and two, one to three, one to four, and one to five. The corresponding proteins, named sFLT-1(1), (2), (3), (4), and (5) were purified. Only mutants sFLT-1(3) to (7) were able to bind 125I-VEGF with high affinity. No binding of VEGF was observed with sFLT-1(1) and sFLT-1(2), indicating that the first three Ig-like loops are involved in high affinity binding of VEGF. The binding of VEGF to sFLT-1(3) could be competed with placenta growth factor (PlGF), a VEGF-related ligand, suggesting that high affinity binding of VEGF and PlGF is mediated by the same or closely related contact sites on sFLT-1. Deglycosylation of the sFLT-1(3), (4), (5), and (7) did not abolish VEGF binding. Furthermore, unglycosylated sFLT-1(3), expressed in Escherichia coli, was able to bind VEGF with similar affinity as sFLT-1(3) or sFLT-1(7), both expressed in Sf9 cells. This indicates that receptor glycosylation is not essential for high affinity binding. Dimerization of the extracellular domains of FLT-1 upon addition of VEGF was detected with all mutants containing the Ig-like loop four. Although sFLT-1(3) was able to bind VEGF, dimerization of this mutant was inefficient, indicating that sites on Ig-like loop four are essential to stabilize receptor dimers."

OCT2p was heterologously expressed and characterized in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. OCT2p-mediated uptake of the prototypical organic cation [14C]tetraethylammonium ([14C]TEA) into 293 cells was saturable.

Organic cations, likeN 1The abbreviations used are: TEA, tetraethylammonium; MPP+, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium; RT, reverse transcriptase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; kb, kilobase(s). 1The abbreviations used are: TEA, tetraethylammonium; MPP+, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium; RT, reverse transcriptase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; kb, kilobase(s).-methylnicotinamide, tetraethylammonium (TEA),1 and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), are secreted via transcellular transport,i.e. uptake from the blood across the basolateral membrane into the proximal tubular epithelial cells followed by extrusion across the brush-border membrane into the tubular fluid (1Rennick B.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1981; 240: F83-F89PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence from functional studies on membrane vesicles, isolated tubules, and tissue slices indicates that specific transport mechanisms for organic cations exist in both the luminal and basolateral membranes of proximal tubular cells. Transport across the basolateral membrane is brought about by a facilitated, but passive, mechanism that is accelerated by the inside negative membrane potential. On the other hand, transport across the apical membrane is thought to result from electroneutral exchange of cellular organic cations with tubular protons or organic cations. So far, little is known about the molecular structures of the transporters. However, the recent cloning by Gründemann et al. (2Gründemann D. Gorboulev V. Gambaryan S. Veyhl M. Koepsell H. Nature. 1994; 372: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar) of OCT1r, an organic cation transporter from rat kidney, has opened the field of organic cation transport for molecular studies. OCT1r has been assigned to the basolateral membrane of proximal tubular cells and is also functionally expressed in hepatocytes (3Martel F. Vetter T. Russ H. Gründemann D. Azevedo I. Koepsell H. Schömig E. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1996; 354: 320-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with degenerate oligonucleotides derived from the OCT1r amino acid sequence was employed to search for OCT1-related transporters. Here we report the cloning and functional expression of OCT2p, a transporter from LLC-PK1 cells, with characteristics of the apical type of organic cation transporter, as well as the tissue distribution of OCT2r, the presumptive OCT2p homologue from rat kidney. [14C]TEA ([1-14C]-tetraethylammonium bromide, 0.12 Bq/pmol) was from NEN™ Life Science Products (Bad Homburg, Germany). Corticosterone, cyanine863 (1-ethyl-2-[(1,4-dimethyl-2-phenyl-6-pyrimidinylidene)methyl]quinolinium chloride), decynium22 (1,1′-diethyl-2,2′-cyanine iodide), quinine hemisulfate, and tetraethylammonium bromide were from Sigma-Aldrich (Deisenhofen, Germany); O-methylisoprenaline hydrochloride was from Boehringer (Ingelheim, Germany). Disprocynium24 was synthesized as described previously (4Russ H. Engel W. Schömig E. J. Med. Chem. 1993; 36: 4208-4213Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (5Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). The mRNA was selected twice by affinity chromatography on oligo(dT)-cellulose (6Aviv H. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 1408-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (5173) Google Scholar). cDNA was synthesized by a modification of the strategy of Gubler and Hoffman (7Gubler U. Hoffman B.J. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 25: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (3065) Google Scholar) using aNotI primer-linker and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (RT) (Life Technologies, Eggenstein, Germany). For cDNA library construction, following adapter ligation, adapter phosphorylation, and restriction of the primer-linker, size fractionated cDNA (2.8–4.5 kb) was prepared by UV-protected agarose gel electrophoresis (8Gründemann D. Schömig E. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 898-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).

For PCR on double-stranded cDNA from LLC-PK1 cells, the following degenerate oligonucleotides, derived from the OCT1r amino acid sequence (2Gründemann D. Gorboulev V. Gambaryan S. Veyhl M. Koepsell H. Nature. 1994; 372: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar), were used (see Fig. 2): 5′-GAR CTN TAY CCN AC-3′ (forward primer, corresponding to nucleotide positions 1403–1416 of the OCT1r cDNA), and 5′-TTN GTY TCN GGY AA-3′ (reverse primer, reverse complementary to positions 1601–1614). The PCR reaction mix (50 μl) contained 0.5 μm per primer, 0.2 mmper dNTP, 2.3 mm MgCl2, and 2 units ofTaq DNA polymerase in the buffer provided (Boehringer Ingelheim Bioproducts, Heidelberg, Germany). Thermocycling consisted of 38 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 45 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. The amplification product (0.2 kb) was cloned into pUC19 as described (13Liu Z. Schwartz L.M. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 28-30PubMed Google Scholar) and sequenced by the dideoxy method (14Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar). 20 μg total RNA was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with 2 units of RQ1-DNase (Boehringer Ingelheim Bioproducts, Heidelberg, Germany) in 100 μl of 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm triethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.5, to degrade any residual DNA. The RNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform, precipitated with ethanol and dissolved in water. For cDNA synthesis, 5 μg of the RNA thus prepared was incubated at 45 °C for 1 h in a total volume of 20 μl with 100 units of Superscript II RT (Life Technologies, Eggenstein, Germany) in 10 μm random hexamers, 1.5 mm per dNTP, 7 mmMgCl2, 75 mm KCl, 50 mmtriethanolamine-HCl, pH 8.7 (26 °C), 10 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.75 units/μl RNase inhibitor from human placenta. For paired negative controls, RT was omitted. Following heat inactivation of the proteins (10 min at 95 °C), and addition of 5 μl of 0.5 mg/ml DNase-free RNase A (QIAGEN, Hagen, Germany) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, the cDNA was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, to degrade unreacted mRNA. With 4 μl of this preparation, PCR was performed as described above (60 °C annealing temperature), with the following primers: 5′-CCT GGG CTC CCT GGT TGT GGG TTA-3′ (forward primer OCT1r), 5′-AAT GAG GGG CAG GGC TTG CCA AA-3′ (reverse primer OCT1r), 5′-CCG CTA TCC CTG GGC TGT GTC AAA-3′ (forward primer OCT2r), 5′-TGG CCC ACA GCT CCC TTG GGT ATT-3′ (reverse primer OCT2r), 5′-ACT GGC GTC TTC ACC ACC AT-3′ (forward primer glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), and 5′-TCC ACC ACC CTG TTG CTG TA-3′ (reverse primer glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase). LLC-PK1 cells (ATCC CRL-1392) and 293 cells (ATCC CRL-1573) were cultured on 60-mm polystyrol dishes as described (3Martel F. Vetter T. Russ H. Gründemann D. Azevedo I. Koepsell H. Schömig E. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1996; 354: 320-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Schömig E. Babin-Ebell J. Russ H. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1993; 347: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). After washing with serum-free medium, each culture dish was incubated at 37 °C for 4 h with 2 ml of serum-free medium which contained 10 nmol of Tfx-50 reagent (Boehringer Ingelheim Bioproducts, Heidelberg, Germany) and 0.5 pmol of plasmid DNA. Subsequently, the transfection medium was replaced by standard culture medium. After 2 days, uptake was measured essentially as described elsewhere (3Martel F. Vetter T. Russ H. Gründemann D.

Inhibitors of uptake were present during both the preincubation and incubation periods. In the pH effect experiment, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, containing 5 mm glucose, pH adjusted with HCl, was used. 293 cells stably transfected with pcDNA3OCT2r were selected with G418 according to the protocol of the vendor (Boehringer Mannheim). Expression of OCT2r was verified by RT-PCR and functional characterization. Time courses, saturation, and inhibition curves were analyzed as described (15Schömig E. Babin-Ebell J. Russ H. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1993; 347: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).K i values are given as geometric mean with 95% confidence interval. Hill coefficients are given as arithmetic mean ± S.E. Sequences were analyzed with the GCG package, with default settings, as implemented in HUSAR (DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany). With LLC-PK1 cells grown on plastic dishes for 6 days, the effects on initial rates of specific TEA uptake of various compounds were determined. Specific transport was defined as that fraction of total uptake that is sensitive to 10 μm cyanine863, which is a known inhibitor of renal secretion of organic cations (1Rennick B.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1981; 240: F83-F89PubMed Google Scholar). All tested compounds inhibited apical TEA uptake into LLC-PK1 cells (Fig. 1). TheK i values ranged from 2.5 nm for disprocynium24 to 0.58 mm forO-methylisoprenaline (Table I).Table IInhibition by various compounds of specific [14C]TEA uptake into LLC-PK1 cells grown on impermeable support and 293 cells transfected with pcDNA3OCT2pNo.CompoundLLC-PK1cells293 cells/pcDNA3OCT2pKi95% c.i.n HKi95% c.i.n Hμmol/literμmol/liter1Disprocynium240.00250.0013, 0.00450.85 ± 0.20ND2Decynium220.00620.0047, 0.00780.87 ± 0.090.0510.022, 0.0791.57 ± 0.513Cyanine8630.0990.073, 0.1250.70 ± 0.080.500.067, 0.941.14 ± 0.444Corticosterone0.290.19, 0.390.92 ± 0.130.670.28, 1.050.78 ± 0.185Quinine3.52.3, 4.60.92 ± 0.125.53.2, 7.80.93 ± 0.146Tetraethylammonium2621, 321.03 ± 0.103827, 491.16 ± 0.177O-Methylisoprenaline580430, 7301.11 ± 0.1788048, 17001.02 ± 0.33Given is the Ki with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (c.i.) and the Hill coefficient with the corresponding S.E.

ND, not determined. Degenerate primers were derived from the amino acid sequence of OCT1r, and used in PCR on cDNA from LLC-PK1cells. A 212-base fragment, which was cloned into pUC19 and sequenced, revealed a substantial similarity (89%) to OCT1r. When the PCR fragment was used as a probe in Northern blot analysis of LLC-PK1 mRNA, a single band with a length of approximately 3.6 kb was detected (data not shown). Subsequently, an appropriately size-fractionated cDNA library was generated from LLC-PK1 mRNA and screened by colony hybridization, with a probe derived from the PCR fragment. A clone with a length of 3.0 kb was isolated and sequenced. The amino acid sequence of the clone, generated by conceptual translation of the largest open reading frame of the cDNA (Fig. 2), is remarkably similar to the amino acid sequence of OCT1r (identity 67%, similarity 83%). The clone was named OCT2p (p denoting pig). From hydropathy analysis, OCT2p, with a length of 554 amino acids, is predicted to have a membrane topology much like OCT1r (Fig. 2). Within a framework of 12 transmembrane segments, a large extracellular loop with three potentialN-glycosylation sites is formed between transmembrane segments 1 and 2, and potential intracellular phosphorylation sites are situated after the transmembrane segments 6 and 12. For functional expression, the cDNA of OCT2p was inserted into the eucaryotic expression vector pcDNA3. With the resulting plasmid, pcDNA3OCT2p, 293 cells, a transformed cell line derived from human embryonic kidney (16Graham F.L. Smiley J. Russel W.C. Nairn R. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 36: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (3446) Google Scholar), were transiently transfected. Control cells were transfected with pcDNA3. The cDNA of OCT2p induced expression of specific [3H]MPP+ or [14C]TEA transport activity (data not shown). Since TEA had a higher ratio of specific to nonspecific uptake, it was chosen to characterize OCT2p. A detailed analysis of the time course of uptake of TEA into pcDNA3OCT2p-transfected cells (Fig. 3) revealed rate constants for inwardly (k in) and outwardly (k out) directed TEA fluxes of 0.88 ± 0.07 μl min−1 mg of protein−1 and 0.07 ± 0.01 min−1, respectively (n = 18). The uptake at equilibrium (A max) amounted to 38.0 ± 3 pmol mg of protein−1. Based on an intracellular water space of 6.7 μl mg of protein−1 and a transfection efficiency of 25% (3Martel F. Vetter T. Russ H. Gründemann D. Azevedo I. Koepsell H. Schömig E. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1996; 354: 320-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), at equilibrium an 8-fold accumulation of TEA relative to medium can be estimated. An uptake period of 4 min was chosen for all subsequent experiments to approximate initial rates of transport. Specific uptake of TEA into 293 cells transfected with pcDNA3OCT2p was saturable (Fig. 4). Since the Eadie-Hofstee plot is not compatible with a single uptake mechanism, the saturation curve was resolved into a high affinity component (K m = 20 μm, V max = 7 pmol min−1 mg of protein−1), which was further characterized, and a low affinity component (K m = 620 μm, V max = 106 pmol min−1 mg of protein−1), which was not analyzed in detail in the present study (n = 18). To compare OCT2p with the apical TEA uptake mechanism in LLC-PK1 cells, the pharmacological profile of TEA uptake into pcDNA3OCT2p-transfected 293 cells had to be established. Hence, the effects on initial rates of specific TEA uptake of various compounds were determined. All compounds tested inhibited TEA uptake (Fig. 5). The K i values ranged from 51 nm for decynium22 to 0.88 mm forO-methylisoprenaline (Table I). Comparison of the pharmacological profile of OCT2p transiently expressed in 293 cells to that of the apical TEA uptake mechanism present in LLC-PK1 cells (Fig. 6) revealed a highly significant correlation of the K i values (r = 0.995, n = 6, p < 0.001). This indicates that identical transport mechanisms are expressed in LLC-PK1 cells and in pcDNA3OCT2p-transfected 293 cells. Inhibition by corticosterone of apical TEA uptake into LLC-PK1 cells was analyzed in more detail. Compared with controls (30-min preincubation,K i = 0.20 (0.11, 0.37) μm), corticosterone was equally inhibitory to TEA uptake after a preincubation period of only 1 min (Fig. 7;K i = 0.25 (0.15, 0.41) μm). Saturation analysis (Fig. 8) implies that corticosterone is a competitive inhibitor of TEA uptake, since in the presence of 0.3 μm corticosterone, the apparent K m for TEA was increased from 48 (control) to 124 μm, while theV max remained the same (243 versus266 pmol min−1 mg of protein−1).Figure 8Effect of corticosterone on saturation of specific [14C]TEA uptake into LLC-PK1 cells grown on plastic dishes. Initial rates were determined with various concentrations of TEA at 37 °C with an uptake period of 2 min in the absence (○) and presence (•) of 0.3 μmcorticosterone.

Inset, corresponding Eadie-Hofstee plot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The presumptive OCT2p homologue from rat kidney, OCT2r, was cloned and sequenced as described for OCT2p (see “Discussion”). The tissue distribution of OCT1r and OCT2r mRNA was analyzed by RT-PCR with specific oligonucleotide primers (Fig. 9). OCT1r mRNA was detected in liver, kidney, intestine, and veins, but not in the brain. In peripheral tissues, OCT2r mRNA is confined to the kidney. Interestingly, however, some regions of rat central nervous system contain OCT2r mRNA. The signal was most pronounced in substantia nigra, nucleus accumbens, and striatum. The rate of total TEA uptake at pH 7.2 into 293 cells expressing OCT2r was 15.4 ± 0.7 pmol min−1 mg−1 (control cells, stably transfected with pcDNA3: 0.44 ± 0.03 pmol min−1mg−1). By contrast, at pH 5.4 the rate of uptake was 9.8 ± 0.5 pmol min−1 mg−1 (control: 0.31 ± 0.05 pmol min−1 mg−1). Thus, an increase of the medium proton concentration significantly inhibits uptake of TEA (n = 3; p < 0.01). A comparable proton dependence was observed with HEPES-buffered media at pH 8.5 versus 6.5 (data not shown). LLC-PK1 cells, a widely used established cell line from pig kidney (17Hull R.N. Cherry W.R. Weaver G.W. In Vitro. 1976; 12: 670-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), show many properties of proximal tubular epithelial cells (18Gstraunthaler G. Renal Physiol. Biochem. 1988; 11: 1-42PubMed Google Scholar). These polarized cells attach with their basolateral surface to culture dishes, while the apical membrane domain, which corresponds to the brush-border membrane, faces the culture medium. After several days in culture, they form monolayers, with microvilli and tight junctions (19Pfaller W. Gstraunthaler G. Loidl P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 142: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). LLC-PK1 cells, grown on permeable or impermeable support, have been used for selective exposure of apical or basolateral membranes to substrates and inhibitors (20Miller J.H. Mullin J.M. McAvoy E. Kleinzeller A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1110: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 21Rabito C.A. Kreisberg J.I. Wight D. J. Biol.

LLC-PK1 cells are a model for the renal secretion of organic cations, since with monolayers grown on permeable filters, the transepithelial TEA flux in physiological direction markedly exceeds the flux in the reverse direction (23Fauth C. Rossier B. Roch-Ramel F. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: F351-F357PubMed Google Scholar, 24Fouda A.-K. Fauth C. Roch-Ramel F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 252: 286-292PubMed Google Scholar, 26Saito H. Yamamoto M. Inui K. Hori R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C59-C66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transepithelial transport of TEA from the basolateral side is potently inhibited by decynium22, applied to the apical side, whereas application to the basolateral side has no effect (15Schömig E. Babin-Ebell J. Russ H. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1993; 347: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Moreover, apical membrane vesicles from LLC-PK1 cells contain, analogous to renal brush-border membrane vesicles from various species (27Holohan P.D. Ross C.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1981; 216: 294-298PubMed Google Scholar, 28Takano M. Inui K. Okano T. Saito H. Hori R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 773: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 29Wright S.H. Am.

Physiol. 1989; 256: F290-F297PubMed Google Scholar), an organic cation uptake mechanism that markedly depends on pH (33Inui K. Saito H. Hori R. Biochem. J. 1985; 227: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Together, these findings strongly suggest that LLC-PK1 cells express the apical type of organic cation transporter. Essentially similar results have been obtained with OK cells (34McKinney T.D. Scheller M.B. Hosford M. McAteer J.A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1990; 1: 902-909PubMed Google Scholar, 35Yuan G. Ott R.J. Salgado C. Giacomini K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8978-8986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, LLC-PK1 mRNA was chosen as primary material for the molecular characterization of the apical type of organic cation transporter. A cDNA was isolated, which, upon heterologous expression in 293 cells, induces saturable uptake of TEA and MPP+. The clone was named OCT2p, to distinguish it from OCT1, for two reasons. 1) We have cloned and sequenced another organic cation transporter from rat kidney, OCT2r. Pairwise sequence analysis indicates that OCT2p is closer related to OCT2r (identity 81%, similarity 90%) than to OCT1r (identity 67%, similarity 83%). Interestingly, the overall similarity of structures of OCT1 and OCT2 agrees well with the conclusion of Ullrich et al. (36David C. Rumrich G. Ullrich K.J. Pflügers Arch. 1995; 430: 477-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) from their extensive in vivocharacterization of organic cation transport in rat kidney, that the luminal and contraluminal organic cation transporters are similar, but not identical. Very recently, Okuda et al. (37Okuda M. Saito H. Urakami Y. Takano M. Inui K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 500-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) have published the OCT2r cDNA sequence and reported functional expression in Xenopus oocytes. Our amino acid sequence is identical to the published sequence except for positions 332 (Lys (per Okuda et al.) versus Asn) and 335 (Ileversus Phe). 2) Data from a previous study (3Martel F. Vetter T. Russ H. Gründemann D. Azevedo I. Koepsell H. Schömig E. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1996; 354: 320-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) allow a valid comparison of the affinities of OCT1r and OCT2p for various inhibitors. While theK i values for cyanine863 (0.50 versus0.67 μm for OCT2p and OCT1r, respectively) and quinine (5.5 versus 4.3 μm) are virtually identical, OCT2p has a clearly higher affinity for decynium22 (0.051versus 0.50 μm), but lower affinity forO-methylisoprenaline (25 versus 880 μm). However, the most discriminative compound is corticosterone, which with a K i of 0.67 μm inhibits OCT2p 100 times more potently than OCT1r (K i = 72 μm). OCT1r as found in rat hepatocytes (3Martel F. Vetter T. Russ H. Gründemann D. Azevedo I. Koepsell H. Schömig E. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1996; 354: 320-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or as expressed in Xenopus oocytes (2Gründemann D. Gorboulev V. Gambaryan S. Veyhl M. Koepsell H. Nature. 1994; 372: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar) also is rather resistant to corticosterone, with K ivalues of 14 and >20 μm, respectively. Corticosterone does not qualify as an organic cation. Nevertheless, it is a potent inhibitor (K i = 0.13 μm) of the extraneuronal monoamine transport mechanism (uptake2), which is distinct from, but probably related to, the renal organic cation transporters (38Schömig E. Schönfeld C.L. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1990; 341: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 39Keppler K. Schömig E. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1992; 345: R103Google Scholar, 40Babin-Ebell J. Russ H. Gliese M. Schömig E. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1991; 343: R92Google Scholar). Inhibition of the apical organic cation transporter in LLC-PK1 cells by corticosterone seems to involve a direct interaction with the transporter rather than a genomic effect. Inhibition was competitive and was effective after 1 min of incubation with the inhibitor, whereas genomic effects become apparent only after hours (41McEwen B.S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 141-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Other steroids such as progesterone and testosterone also inhibit apical TEA uptake into LLC-PK1 cells with high potency (data not shown), which does not fit in with any known intracellular steroid receptor. The inferred K m of TEA uptake into pcDNA3OCT2ptransfected 293 cells (20 μm) agrees well with those reported for apical TEA uptake into LLC-PK1 (34 μm (25McKinney T.D. DeLeon C. Speeg K.V. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 137: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), 27 μm (15Schömig E. Babin-Ebell J. Russ H. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1993; 347: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar)), and OK cells (28 μm (35Yuan G. Ott R.J. Salgado C. Giacomini K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8978-8986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). More decisively, comparison of theK i values of structurally unrelated compounds for the inhibition of transiently expressed OCT2p to those of the apical TEA uptake in LLC-PK1 cells revealed a highly significant correlation (Fig. 6). This is firm evidence that OCT2p is functionally expressed in LLC-PK1 cells. Since the LLC-PK1cells were grown on plastic dishes for 6 days prior to measurements, uptake most probably was restricted to the apical membrane domain. Therefore, it must be concluded that OCT2p is identical with the apical organic cation transporter from LLC-PK1 cells. OCT2r, the presumptive OCT2p homologue from rat kidney, was found, when expressed in Xenopus oocytes, to operate independently from medium pH (37Okuda M. Saito H. Urakami Y. Takano M. Inui K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 500-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to these data, our clone of OCT2r, when expressed in 293 cells, was clearly inhibited by an increase in the medium proton concentration. This proton dependence is consistent with the reported characteristics of the apical organic cation transporter (25McKinney T.D. DeLeon C. Speeg K.V. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 137: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, it should be noted that detection of the proton dependence may depend strongly on the experimental conditions, since some attempts have succeeded (26Saito H. Yamamoto M. Inui K. Hori R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C59-C66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Dantzler W.H. Brokl O.H. Wright S.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: F290-F297PubMed Google Scholar,42Dantzler W.H. Brokl O.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: F167-F176PubMed Google Scholar), whereas others have failed (25McKinney T.D. DeLeon C. Speeg K.V. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 137: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 34McKinney T.D. Scheller M.B. Hosford M. McAteer J.A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1990; 1: 902-909PubMed Google Scholar) or produced small effects (35Yuan G. Ott R.J. Salgado C. Giacomini K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8978-8986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Perhaps post-translational modifications or competing driving forces such as membrane potential or intracellular substrates account for variability. Thus, in general, identification of transporters would seem to be more reliable by comparison of pharmacological profiles rather than by analysis of driving forces. The present RT-PCR analysis of tissue distribution of OCT1r mRNA confirms data from Northern analysis (2Gründemann D. Gorboulev V. Gambaryan S. Veyhl M. Koepsell H. Nature. 1994; 372: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). In non-neuronal tissue, OCT2r mRNA was exclusively found in the kidney, which agrees well with previous data from Northern analysis and RT-PCR (37Okuda M. Saito H. Urakami Y. Takano M. Inui K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 500-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In contrast to the data of Okuda et al. (37Okuda M. Saito H. Urakami Y. Takano M. Inui K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 500-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), however, OCT2r mRNA was clearly detectable in various brain regions (Fig. 9). Is there a link between the presumptive expression of OCT2r in the kidney and in distinct brain regions? We speculate that this common denominator could be the monoamine transmitter dopamine. The brain regions with the strongest RT-PCR signals for OCT2r mRNA,i.e. substantia nigra, nucleus accumbens, and striatum, are known to contain high levels of dopamine (20–22, 87–101, and 71–134 ng of dopamine × mg of protein−1, respectively), compared with e.g. frontal cortex (0.2–1.0 ng of dopamine × mg of protein−1) (43Palkovits M. Brownstein M.J. Catecholamines II.in: Trendelenburg U. Weiner N. Springer Verlag, Berlin1989: 1-26Google Scholar). Moreover, the kidney is a major site for extraneuronal production of dopamine (44Aperia A. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 1994; 3: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and renal secretion of dopamine in vivo is sensitive to disprocynium24. 2K.-H. Graefe, B. Friedgen, R. Wölfel, H. Russ, and E. Schömig, manuscript submitted. Finally, OCT2r, expressed in 293 cells, avidly transports radiolabeled dopamine (data not shown). In conclusion, an organic cation transporter, OCT2p, was cloned from LLC-PK1 cells, with characteristics of the apical TEA transporter. Although OCT2p is structurally related to the basolateral transporter OCT1r, the transporters can be clearly distinguished on a pharmacological basis. While expression of OCT1r is limited to peripheral tissues, the present study indicates that OCT2r is expressed both in the kidney and the central nervous system. Since with the isocyanines and pseudoisocyanines very potent and selective inhibitors are available (4Russ H. Engel W. Schömig E. J. Med. Chem. 1993; 36: 4208-4213Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 15Schömig E. Babin-Ebell J. Russ H. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1993; 347: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), OCT2 could become a promising target for biomedical applications. We thank Anke Ripperger and Heike Grieshaber for skillful technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2071673579,"Presently, nothing is known about the function of the Ras-related protein Rheb. Since Rheb shares significant sequence identity with the core effector domains of Ras and KRev-1/Rap1A, it may share functional similarities with these two structurally related, yet functionally distinct, small GTPases. Furthermore, since like Ras, Rheb terminates with a COOH terminus that is likely to signal for farnesylation, it may be a target for the farnesyltransferase inhibitors that block Ras processing and function. To compare Rheb function with those of Ras and KRev-1, we introduced mutations into Rheb that generate constitutively active or dominant negative forms of Ras and Ras-related proteins and were designated Rheb(64L) and Rheb(20N), respectively. Expression of wild type or mutant Rheb did not alter the morphology or growth properties of NIH 3T3 cells. Thus, aberrant Rheb function is distinct from that of Ras and fails to cause cellular transformation. Instead, similar to KRev-1, co-expression of Rheb antagonized oncogenic Ras transformation and signaling. In vitro and in vivo analyses showed that like Ras, Rheb proteins are farnesylated and are sensitive to farnesyltransferase inhibition. Thus, it is possible that Rheb function may be inhibited by farnesyltransferase inhibitors treatment and, consequently, may contribute to the ability of these inhibitors to impair Ras transformation.

Mutated forms of the three ras genes (H-, K-, and N-ras) are associated with 30% of all human cancers and encode potent transforming and oncogenic mutant proteins (1Clark G.J. Der C.J. Dickey B.F. Birnbaumer L. GTPases in Biology I. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1993: 259-288Google Scholar). Normal Ras proteins function as GDP/GTP-regulated molecular switches (2Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (SOS and RasGRF/CDC25) promote formation of the active, GTP-bound state (2Boguski M.S.

McCormick F. Cancer Biol. 1992; 3: 199-208PubMed Google Scholar). Mutated Ras proteins contain single amino acid substitutions (at residues 12, 13, or 61) that render the proteins insensitive to GTPase activating protein stimulation and, consequently, persist as constitutively activated proteins. Ras proteins serve as key intermediate relay switches in diverse signaling pathways that control cell growth and differentiation (6Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1990; 349: 117-127Crossref Scopus (2698) Google Scholar, 7Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 67-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 8Prendergast G.C.

Consequently, mutated Ras proteins cause constitutive, ligand-independent activation of these pathways, thereby promoting to the aberrant growth of tumor cells. Ras proteins are prototypes for a large superfamily of Ras-related proteins (>60 mammalian members) that function as GDP/GTP-regulated molecular switches (2Boguski M.S. McCormick F.

However, despite their strong amino acid sequence identity with Ras proteins (30–55%), the majority of these small GTPases lack the potent transforming potential of Ras proteins.

The transforming activities of TC21 and R-Ras reflect the fact that these two Ras-related proteins share complete identity with the core Ras effector domain (Ras residues 32–40) and, consequently, may activate downstream signaling pathways in common with those that mediate Ras transforming potential (21Marshall M.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 250-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). However, although the Raf-1 serine/threonine kinase is clearly a critical effector important for Ras signaling and transformation (22Kolch W. Heidecker G. Lloyd P. Rapp U.R.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, despite possessing complete identity with the core Ras effector domain, these two Ras-related proteins must cause transformation by activation of Raf-independent effector pathways. Therefore, while the core effector domain sequences of Ras, TC21, and R-Ras are clearly critical for effector interactions, sequences flanking this core region are likely to influence specific effector interactions. Consistent with this, recent mutagenesis studies have extended the boundaries of the Ras effector domain to include Ras residues 25–45 (30Zhang K. Noda M. Vass W.C. Papageorge A.G. Lowy D.R. Science. 1990; 249: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 31Akasaka K. Tamada M. Wang F. Kariya K. Shima F. Kikuchi A. Yamamoto M. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol.

Although KRev-1/Rap1A also shares complete identity with the core Ras effector domain, it lacks any transforming potential and, instead, antagonizes the ability of Ras to transform cells (32Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 33Kitayama H. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Since KRev-1 can interact with the Raf-1 serine/threonine kinase (35Zhang X. Settleman J. Kyriakis J.M. Takeuchi-Suzuki E. Elledge S.J. Marshall M.S. Bruder J.T. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1993; 364: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar), as well as other candidate Ras effectors (e.g. RalGDS and related proteins) (36Spaargaren M. Bischoff J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12609-12613Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 37Peterson S.N. Trabalzini L. Brtva T.R. Fischer T. Altschuler D.L. Martelli P. Lapetina E.G. Der C.J. White G.C., II J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29903-29908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), it is not clearly understood why KRev-1 is not transforming and how it antagonizes Ras function. One possibility is that KRev-1 interacts with, but fails to activate, Ras effectors important for Ras transformation. Thus, KRev-1 may form nonproductive complexes with Raf and other Ras effectors, thereby preventing their association with Ras. Consistent with this possibility KRev-1 fails to activate Raf or other downstream signaling activities that are stimulated by Ras. Rheb (Ras homolog highly enriched in brain) is a recently identified member of the Ras superfamily (38Yamagata K. Sanders L.K. Kaufmann W.E. Yee W. Barnes C.A. Nathans D. Worley P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16333-16339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The overall sequence of Rheb is distinct from other Ras-related proteins, but it shares strongest overall amino acid homology with human Rap2, yeast RAS1, and human H-Ras. Rheb also possesses sequence characteristics in common with Ras and Rap proteins. First, Rheb shows strong identity with the Ras and Rap core effector domains, suggesting that Rheb may share common effector interactions with Ras and KRev-1. The equivalent region of Rheb is quite similar to Ras with the first six amino acids being identical. Second, Rheb terminates with a CAAX motif (C, cysteine, A, aliphatic, andX, terminal amino acid) that is likely to signal for posttranslational modification by the C15 farnesyl isoprenoid (39Maltese W.A. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 3319-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 40Cox A.D. Der C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 1008-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 41Magee A.I. Newman C.M.H. Giannakouros T. Hancock J.F. Fawell E. Armstrong J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1992; 20: 497-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Except for the Ras proteins, Rap2B and two Rho family proteins (RhoB and RhoE) (42Adamson P. Marshall C.J. Hall A. Tilbrook P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20033-20038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Farrell F.X. Yamamoto K. Lapetina E.G. Biochem.

Biol. 1996; 16: 2689-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), all other prenylated Ras superfamily proteins are modified by the related C20geranylgeranyl isoprenoid. Hence, Rheb function may be antagonized by FTIs that block Ras function (45Sattler I. Tamanoi F. Maruta H. Regulation of the RAS Signaling Network. R. G. Landes, Austin, TX1996Google Scholar). In the present study, we introduced putative gain or loss of function mutations into Rheb and evaluated their biological properties in NIH 3T3 cells. We found that overexpression of wild type or mutant Rheb failed to cause morphologic or growth transformation of NIH 3T3 cells. Instead, like KRev-1, we observed that Rheb co-expression inhibited oncogenic Ras signaling and transformation and that Rheb complexed with Raf-1 in vitro. However, whereas KRev-1 is modified by the geranylgeranyl isoprenoid, like Ras, we determined that Rheb is modified by farnesylation, and this processing is blocked by FTI treatment. Finally, Rheb displays a subcellular location that is similar to that of Ras rather than the intracellular membrane location seen with KRev-1. Taken together, these results suggest that Rheb function is similar to that of KRev-1 rather than Ras and that FTI inhibition of Rheb function may be a component of FTI inhibition of Ras transformation. We utilized polymerase chain reaction-mediated DNA amplification to isolate sequences corresponding to rheb from a randomly primed rat fetal liver cDNA library (generous gift of T. Dawson). Five μl (108 plaque-forming units/ml) of the library was subjected to 30 cycles of amplification at an annealing temperature of 55 °C using 5′- and 3′-oligonucleotides that contain the coding sequences for the NH2- or COOH-terminal rat Rheb protein sequence (38Yamagata K. Sanders L.K. Kaufmann W.E. Yee W. Barnes C.A. Nathans D. Worley P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16333-16339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), together with flanking noncoding sequences that containBamHI restriction sites to facilitate subcloning into theBamHI site of the Bluescript SKII plasmid vector. The fidelity of the sequence was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. Therheb cDNA fragment was then subcloned into theBamHI site of the pZIP-NeoSV(x)1 retrovirus for expression from the Moloney long terminal repeat promoter or the pCGN-hyg mammalian expression vector for expression of an NH2-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; FPP, farnesylpyrophosphate; GGPP, geranylgeranylpyrophosphate; FTI, farnesyltransferase inhibitor; GMPPCP, guanylyl β,γ-methylenediphosphonate; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. epitope-tagged fusion protein (HA-Rheb) from the cytomegalovirus promoter (46Cepko C.L.

Cell. 1990; 60: 375-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Therheb cDNA sequence was also subcloned into the pGEX-2T bacterial expression vector to encode a glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-Rheb chimeric fusion protein. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene Chameleon Mutagenesis kit) was used to generate mutant rheb or Krev-1 cDNA sequences. All mutated sequences were sequenced to confirm fidelity. NIH 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum and plasmid DNA transfections were performed by calcium phosphate precipitation using procedures that we have described previously (48Clark G.J. Cox A.D. Graham S.M. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Focus formation inhibition assays were performed by co-transfecting NIH 3T3 cells in triplicate with oncogenic H-Ras(12V) driven by its genomic promoter (pUC-rasH(12V)) and a 10-fold molar excess of each rheb expression construct. The number of transformed foci was determined after 16 days. To determine the consequence of exogenously introduced wild type or mutant Rheb protein expression on the growth of NIH 3T3 cells, cells stably transfected with expression vectors encoding wild type or mutant Rheb proteins were isolated by selection of transfected cells in growth medium supplemented with 500 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin; Life Technologies, Inc.). Multiple, G418-resistant colonies (>100) were pooled to establish cell lines stably transfected with each rhebexpression vector and were then used for in vitro growth assays (on plastic or in soft agar) using procedures described previously (48Clark G.J. Cox A.D. Graham S.M. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Growth curves were performed by plating cells at 4 × 104 cells per 60-mm dish. Transient transfection transcription assays were done to determine if Rheb can activate transcription or block oncogenic Ras stimulation of transcription, from the ets/AP-1 Ras-responsive promoter element using procedures described previously (49Khosravi-Far R. White M.A. Westwick J.K. Solski P.A. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Van Aelst L. Wigler M.H. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3923-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures of NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with the pBL4X-CAT reporter plasmid, where chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene expression is regulated by an ets/AP-1 containing promoter and the indicated Rheb and/or Ras expression plasmids. After 48 h the cells were lysed and assayed for CAT activity as described previously (49Khosravi-Far R. White M.A. Westwick J.K. Solski P.A. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Van Aelst L. Wigler M.H. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3923-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). To generate Rheb-specific antiserum, we utilized Rheb COOH-terminal sequences that are distinct from the sequences of corresponding COOH-terminal sequences of Ras, Rap, and other Ras-related proteins (38Yamagata K. Sanders L.K. Kaufmann W.E. Yee W. Barnes C.A. Nathans D. Worley P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16333-16339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction-mediated DNA amplification was used to introduce sequences corresponding to the Rheb COOH-terminal 33 amino acid residues (designated Rheb/C) into the pGEX-2T bacterial expression vector for expression of the GST·Rheb/C fusion protein. Purified GST·Rheb/C protein was injected intramuscularly into rabbits, followed by a second injection after 6 weeks. Antiserum with reactivity against Rheb was used to isolate affinity purified anti-Rheb antibodies using GST·Rheb/C, and the resulting affinity purified anti-Rheb antibodies were used for Western blot analysis of Rheb protein expression. To determine if Rheb could bind to activated human Raf-1, Sf9 insect cells were co-infected with recombinant baculovirus expressing full-length Raf-1 and activated Ras (generous gift of J. Strom), then lysed in Nonidet P-40-containing detergent lysis buffer, and clarified by centrifugation at 103 rpm. GST-fusion proteins containing Ras, KRev-1, and Rheb sequences were first preloaded with nonhydrolyzable GTP (GMPPCP) and then incubated with 10 μl of the Raf-1 containing insect cell lysate in phosphate-buffered saline, 10 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h at 4 °C. The GST-fusion proteins were then isolated and resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The separated proteins were transferred to Immobilon membrane, probed with an anti-Raf antibody (C-12, Santa Cruz Biotech), and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Oocyte lysate and activated Ras protein were prepared as described previously (50Shibuya E.K. Morris J. Rapp U.R. Ruderman J.V. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 235-241PubMed Google Scholar). GST-Rheb and GST-KRev-1 fusion proteins were first preloaded with GMPPCP (10 μg), then added to the oocyte lysate together with 100 ng of GTP charged H-Ras, an ATP regeneration system, and incubated at 20 °C. Samples were taken at time 0 and at 2 h and then assayed for their ability to phosphorylate myelin basic protein as described previously (51Clark G.J. Drugan J.K. Terrell R.S. Bradham C. Der C.J. Bell R.M. Campbell-Burk S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 93: 1577-1581Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For in vitroprenylation analysis (52Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 46-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), 5 μg of recombinant H-Ras, GST-KRev-1, and GST-Rheb proteins were added to 45 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega), together with [3H]mevalonate, [3H]-farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP), or [3H]geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) (DuPont NEN) (25, 2.5, and 2.5 μCi, respectively), either with or without the indicated concentrations of the FTI-277 FTI. We previously demonstrated that FTI-277 can inhibit potently farnesyltransferase in vitro(IC50 = 500 pm), is highly selective for farnesyltransferase over geranylgeranyltransferase I (IC50= 50 mm), and can selectively inhibit prenylation of H-Ras, but not geranylgeranylated KRev-1, in whole cells (53Lerner E.C. Qian Y. Blaskovich M.A. Fossum R.D. Vogt A. Sun J. Cox A.D. Der C.J. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26802-26806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). For prenylation analysis in NIH 3T3 cells, cells stably expressing wild type Ras or Rheb were incubated with varying concentrations of FTI-277 for 72 h. The cells were then fractionated into crude membrane (P100) and supernatant fractions (S100) as described previously (54Cox A.D. Solski P.A. Jordan J.D. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 195-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), then resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and exposed for autoradiography to visualize incorporated label. Cells expressing HA epitope-tagged H-Ras, Rheb, or KRev-1 protein were grown on coverslips for 18 h at 37 °C and then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in Tris-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.1% NaN3). To determine the localization of the tagged proteins, anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Babco) was diluted 1:50 and used to stain the fixed cells for 1 h at 25 °C. The cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Cappel, Durham, NC) for 1 h at 25 °C. Coverslips were viewed on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope, and fluorescence micrographs were taken on T-max 400 film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Rheb shows strong sequence homology with the Ras effector domain (Fig. 1). To determine whether Rheb function could regulate cell growth, we generated mutant Rheb proteins with mutations analogous to those that convert Ras and other Ras-related proteins into constitutively active or inactive proteins. Whereas Rheb(64L) contains a mutation that is analogous to the Q61L mutation that renders Ras proteins constitutively active and transforming (1Clark G.J. Der C.J. Dickey B.F. Birnbaumer L. GTPases in Biology I. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1993: 259-288Google Scholar), Rheb(20N) contains a mutation that is analogous to the S17N mutation that results in dominant negative mutants of Ras and Ras-related proteins (28Graham S.M. Vojtek A.B. Huff S.Y. Cox A.D. Clark G.J. Cooper J.A. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6132-6140Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 55Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). To evaluate the consequences of Rheb protein expression on the growth properties of NIH 3T3 cells in vitro, we isolated NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with expression vectors that encoded wild type or mutant Rheb proteins. To avoid clonal variation differences that may complicate our comparisons, we utilized early passages of pooled populations of multiple G418-resistant colonies (>100) for our analyses. We first determined if these G418-resistant cell populations expressed the exogenously introduced Rheb sequences. Western blot analysis using a rabbit anti-Rheb polyclonal antiserum that recognized the unique COOH-terminal amino acid sequence of Rheb was done. Consistent with the divergence of this portion of Rheb with other Ras-related proteins (58Valencia A. Chardin P. Wittinghofer A. Sander C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4637-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), this antiserum did not recognize the closely related H-Ras, KRev-1, or TC21/R-Ras2 proteins (data not shown). A 21-kDa protein was detected in the control, empty vector-transfected cells, indicating that Rheb is expressed in NIH 3T3 cells (Fig.2 A). The Rheb(WT)-transfected cells expressed a 2- to 3-fold elevation of protein at this position, whereas a slower migrating band was detected in the Rheb(64L)-transfected cells. This altered mobility is seen when the equivalent mutation is introduced into Ras and Ras-related proteins. Cells transfected with Rheb(20N) did not show elevated nor altered forms of protein. This is similar to observations with 17N mutant versions of Ras and Ras-related proteins, where expression is typically lower than that seen with the wild type protein (29Huff S.Y. Quilliam L.A. Cox A.D. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 55Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). This may be due to a reduced stability of the protein or, alternatively, to the fact that high level expression of this mutant is not tolerated by NIH 3T3 cells. We and others (48Clark G.J. Cox A.D. Graham S.M. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) have shown previously that constitutively activated mutants of Ras cause both morphologic and growth transformation of NIH 3T3 cells. In contrast, we found that cells transfected with wild type or mutant rheb sequences showed morphologies that were indistinguishable from that of untransformed NIH 3T3 cells (data not shown). Additionally, in contrast to observations with pZIP-ras(17N)-transfected NIH 3T3 cells (55Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar), no significant reduction in the appearance of G418-resistant colonies was seen for pZIP-rheb(20N)-transfected cells (data not shown). We then determined if the growth rates of NIH 3T3 cells were altered by expression of exogenously introduced rheb sequences. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the growth rates on plastic of wild type or 64L rheb-transfected cell populations were indistinguishable from those displayed by the empty vector-transfected cells. Furthermore, whereas Ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells will proliferate in growth medium supplemented with low serum (1–5%) (data not shown) (48Clark G.J. Cox A.D. Graham S.M. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), all three Rheb-transfected populations showed a requirement for growth medium supplemented with 10% calf serum (Fig.2 C). Finally, we also tested their ability to form colonies in soft agar and found them to be negative (data not shown). Thus, in contrast to Ras, aberrant wild type or mutant Rheb function did not cause growth transformation, or inhibition, of NIH 3T3 cells. Since Rheb lacked the growth promoting activity seen with constitutively activated mutants of Ras, TC21, or R-Ras, we next determined if Rheb was more similar to KRev-1/Rap1A and, instead, could antagonize Ras function (32Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 33Kitayama H. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4284-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). For these analyses, we used the constitutively activated KRev-1(63E) mutant as a positive control for these co-transfection focus formation inhibition assays (33Kitayama H. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y.

https://openalex.org/W1999140776,"NG2 is a membrane-spanning proteoglycan with a primary structure unique among cell surface or extracellular matrix proteins. To characterize the interaction between NG2 and extracellular matrix proteins, we have used a eukaryotic expression system to produce and purify several recombinant fragments covering not only the entire ectodomain of NG2 but also distinct subdomains of the molecule. Using a solid phase binding assay with various extracellular matrix proteins, we have identified two main ligands for NG2, namely, collagens V and VI. Consistent with previous models of glycosaminoglycan attachment, roughly 50% of the recombinant NG2 fragments containing the central domain have chondroitin sulfate chains attached to the protein core. These glycosaminoglycan chains are not directly involved in collagen binding, since chondroitinase-treated fragments exhibit an unimpaired ability to bind to both collagens. Using more restricted recombinant fragments of NG2, we mapped the binding site for both collagens to the central domain of NG2. Electron microscopy after rotary shadowing of native NG2 molecules indicates that this extended nonglobular domain provides a flexible connection joining the two N- and C-terminal globular regions of NG2. Rotary shadowing of mixtures of NG2 and collagen V or VI confirms a direct interaction between the molecules and indicates that the collagens align with the central region of NG2, giving the appearance of a rod between the N- and C-terminal globules.

The ability of cells to recognize and interact with the extracellular matrix is fundamentally important for normal development and for continued maintenance of tissue architecture and function throughout adulthood. The pathogenesis of a variety of diseases can be traced to defects in cellular recognition of the matrix. Several types of molecules on cell surfaces are able to recognize extracellular matrix components, the most prominent class of receptors being the integrin family of heterodimeric proteins (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8941) Google Scholar). Another group of cellular receptors for extracellular matrix components is constituted by cell surface proteoglycans. An increasing number of structurally different proteoglycan core polypeptides of this type have been identified by cDNA cloning (2Elenius K. Jalkanen M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2975-2982PubMed Google Scholar, 3Stipp C.S. Litwack E.D. Lander A.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). For example, syndecans, the best characterized of the transmembrane proteoglycans, can interact with a variety of matrix molecules, such as collagen I (4Elenius K. Salmivirta M. Inki P. Mali M.

Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), thrombospondin (7Sun X. Mosher D.F. Rapraeger A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2885-2889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and tenascin (8Salmivirta M. Elenius K. Vainio S. Hofer U. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Thesleff I. Jalkanen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7733-7739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our laboratory has described another proteoglycan, NG2, with the potential to serve as a cell surface receptor for matrix components. This chondroitin sulfate-containing, membrane-spanning proteoglycan has a unique primary structure, which shares few obvious protein motifs with any other cell surface or matrix proteins (9Nishiyama A. Dahlin K.J. Prince J.T. Johnstone S.R. Stallcup W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). NG2 is expressed on immature progenitor cells in several types of developing tissues and is down-regulated when these precursors undergo terminal differentiation (10Stallcup W.B. Beasley L. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 2737-2744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Nishiyama A. Dahlin K.J. Stallcup W.B. Development (Camb.). 1991; 111: 933-944PubMed Google Scholar, 12Grako K.A. Stallcup W.B. Exp.

Res. 1996; 43: 299-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). However, high levels of expression are once again observed in some types of malignant cells, such as melanomas, glioblastomas, and chondrosarcomas (14Schrappe M. Klier F.G. Spiro R.C. Waltz T.A. Reisfeld R.A. Gladstone C.L. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4986-4993PubMed Google Scholar, 15Leger O. Johnson-Leger P. Jackson E. Coles B. Dean C. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 58: 700-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Integrin-mediated recognition of the extracellular matrix has been shown to initiate an intracellular cascade of second messenger-dependent signaling events that modulate cellular function such as cell adhesion, spreading, migration, and differentiation (16Lafrenie R.M. Yamada K.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 543-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In contrast, little information is available concerning intracellular events triggered by engagement of transmembrane proteoglycans. On the one hand, both NG2 and syndecan-1 have been shown to interact with the cytoskeleton (17Lin X.-H. Dahlin K. Stallcup W.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 63: 463-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 18Rapraeger A. Jalkanen M. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2683-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 19Carey D.J. Stahl R.C. Cizmeci-Smith G. Asundi V.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has recently been shown that the engagement of syndecan-1 by its specific ligands is able to mediate cell spreading without the involvement of the syndecan cytoplasmic domain (20Lebakken C.S. Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1209-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This casts doubt on the idea that the proteoglycan itself can directly mediate signal transduction that leads to cell spreading. An alternative suggestion is that cell surface proteoglycans may function as co-receptors, acting in concert with other types of matrix recognition molecules. This has been observed in the case of syndecans and the α5β1-integrin (21Chun J.-S. Bernfield M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4 (abstr.): 283aCrossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 22Woods A. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The co-receptor mechanism is thought to operate either by changing the conformation of the matrix ligand or by making it more available in some way. In addition, the human melanoma proteoglycan, sharing high homology with NG2 (23Pluschke G. Vanek M. Evans A. Dittmar T. Schmid P. Itin P. Filardo E.J. Reisfeld R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9710-9715Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), has been shown to participate, along with the α4β1-integrin, in promoting spreading of melanoma cells on a fibronectin fragment (24Iida J. Skubitz A.P.N. Furcht L.T. Wayner E.A. McCarthy J.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 431-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar,25Iida J. Meijne A.M.L. Spiro R.C. Roos E. Furcht L.T. Mc Carthy J.B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2177-2185PubMed Google Scholar). A better understanding of the role played by cell surface proteoglycans in cellular function initially requires precise characterization of the interactions of these molecules with specific extracellular matrix ligands. We began to study matrix ligands for NG2 in a solid phase binding assay using NG2 purified from the B49 cell line (26Burg M.A. Tillet E. Timpl R. Stallcup W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26110-26116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, a major limitation in this work was the difficulty in purifying large amounts of the proteoglycan under native conditions. To overcome this difficulty and to achieve better in vitro characterization of the detailed mechanisms governing NG2-matrix interactions, we have produced recombinant fragments of NG2 covering not only the entire extracellular domain of NG2 but also distinct subdomains of the extracellular portion of the molecule. These fragments have been biochemically characterized and used in a solid phase binding assay along with a variety of potential extracellular matrix ligands. Our results identify two main ligands for NG2, namely, collagens V and VI. We show that both collagens bind to the central portion of NG2, which consists of a flexible rodlike domain separating two globular regions located at the N- and C-terminal ends of the NG2 ectodomain. The full-length NG2 cDNA was excised from the pBluescript vector by digestion with XbaI and partial digestion withHindIII (27Nishiyama A. Stallcup W.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1097-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and then subcloned into the EcoRV site of the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA I/Amp (Invitrogen, La Jolla, CA). This construct (pcDNA Amp NG2) was used to generate several expression vectors coding for different domains of the extracellular part of NG2. cDNA fragments were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; EC, extracellular; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; P, peak; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; GAG, glycosaminoglycan. with thePfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) according to the supplier's instructions. The pcDNA NG2EC construct coding for the entire extracellular part of NG2 (amino acid residues 1–2223) was generated by introducing a stop codon after nucleotide 6738. A fragment containing a stop codon and an XbaI site was obtained by PCR using 5′-primer 1 (nucleotide positions 5605–5622 of NG2 cDNA) and 3′-primer 2 (positions 6724–6739). This product was digested with XhoI and XbaI and ligated into the expression vector pcDNA Amp NG2 digested by the same enzymes, thus replacing the C-terminal end of the coding region with the PCR product and removing nucleotides 6739–7173 of the rat NG2 cDNA. A construct (pcDNA ECΔ3) coding for domain 1 of NG2 and the major part of domain 2 (residues 1–1465) was made similarly by ligating a PCR fragment (5′-primer 3 (nucleotides 3494–3510) and 3′-primer 4 (nucleotides 4450–4464)) digested with SplI-XbaI into the pcDNA Amp NG2 vector digested with the same enzymes, thus introducing a stop codon after nucleotide 4464. For expression of internal domains of NG2, pcDNA Amp NG2 was used as a template for PCR to generate fragments for expression vectors. 5′-Primer 5 (nucleotides 1963–1979) and 3′-primer 6 (nucleotides 4402–4419) were used to construct the vector encoding the central domain of rat NG2 (PCEP4/D2) (amino acid residues 632–1450). 5′-Primer 7 (nucleotides 4828–4846) and 3′-primer 8 (nucleotides 6702–6723) were used to generate the expression vector PCEP4/D3 coding for the third domain of the extracellular part of NG2 (amino acid residues 1587–2218). Both fragments contain a unique 5′-NheI restriction site and introduce at the 3′-end a sequence coding for 6 histidine residues, followed by a stop codon and an XbaI site for cloning (28Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Pöschl E. Bächinger H.P. Gambee J.E. Sakai L.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The expression vector used in these two cases was the construct PCEP4/γ2 III 4 (29Mayer U. Pöschl E. Gerecke D.R. Wagman D.W. Burgeson R.E. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) based on the vector PCEP4 (Invitrogen), kindly provided by Dr. Ernst Pöschl (Max-Planck Connective Tissue Clinical Research Group for Rheumatology, Erlangen, Germany). The NG2 cDNA fragments were fused via theirNheI site with the sequence coding for the signal peptide of human BM40 contained in this vector (30Mayer U. Nischt R. Pöschl E. Mann K. Fukuda K. Gerl M. Yamada Y. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1879-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Expression and processing result in secretion of proteins with four N-terminal amino acid residues (APLA) preceding the authentic NG2 domains. The correct in-frame insertion of the inserts in all constructs was verified by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing. In the case of the pcDNA NG2EC and pcDNA ECΔ3 constructs, human embryonic kidney 293 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were co-transfected with plasmid psv2pac, which confers puromycin resistance. Stably transfected clones were selected by puromycin resistance following previously described procedures (31Nischt R. Pottgiesser J. Krieg T. Mayer U. Aumailley M. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Vectors PCEP4/D2 and PCEP4/D3 were used to transfect the 293 EBNA cell line (Invitrogen), which constitutively expresses the EBNA-1 protein from the Epstein-Barr virus, allowing episomal replication of the vector. Transfected cells were selected by resistance to hygromycin B (300 μg/ml) (29Mayer U. Pöschl E. Gerecke D.R. Wagman D.W. Burgeson R.E. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). 293 cell clones or 293 EBNA-resistant cells were tested for expression of the desired NG2 fragments by SDS-PAGE of serum-free culture supernatants followed by Coomassie Blue staining. NG2 products were verified by Western blotting using a polyclonal antiserum against rat NG2 (32Stallcup W.B. Dahlin K. Healy P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3177-3188Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Large amounts of serum-free medium from positive confluent cells were then obtained for protein purification. 0.5–1 liters of serum-free medium from 293 cells expressing NG2EC or ECΔ3 were applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column equilibrated in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.6, containing 0.2 m NaCl, and eluted by a linear gradient from 0.2 to 0.8 m NaCl in the same buffer. Two peaks were obtained. The first peak elutes around 0.4 m NaCl and contains NG2 fragments free of chondroitin sulfate chains. The second peak (0.55 m NaCl) contains the proteoglycan form of the NG2 fragments. Both peaks were individually pooled and will be referred to as P1 (0.4 m NaCl peak) and P2 (0.55 m NaCl peak). Serum-free media from 293 EBNA cells expressing D2 or D3 were purified on nickel-agarose columns (Qiagen) equilibrated in 20 mmTris/HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 m NaCl (buffer A). The column was washed with buffer A and then with the same buffer containing increasing concentrations of imidazole (5–20 mm). More tightly bound proteins were then eluted with 100 mm and then 200 mm imidazole in buffer A. The different eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and fractions containing recombinant NG2 fragments were pooled. All recombinant fragments were dialyzed against 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate and concentrated by ultrafiltration before storage at −20 °C. Protein concentrations were estimated using a BCA protein assay (Pierce) following the instructions of the supplier. Amino acid sequence analysis was performed by automated Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems 473A protein sequencer. Several additional proteins were used for binding studies. Native rat NG2 was purified from B49 cells according to the method of Burget al. (26Burg M.A. Tillet E. Timpl R. Stallcup W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26110-26116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Pepsin-solubilized collagen VI purified from human placenta (33Odermatt E. Risteli J. van Delden V. Timpl R. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) was a gift of Dr R. Timpl (Max-Planck Institut für Biochimie, Martinsried, Germany). Pepsinized collagen V was purified from human amniotic membranes as described (34Ruggiero F. Champliaud M.-F. Garrone R. Aumailley M. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 210: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Human pepsin-extracted collagen IV, collagen I, and bovine collagen II were purchased from Sigma. Mouse laminin-1 was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Recombinant decorin was obtained from Telios (La Jolla, CA). Purified NG2 fragments were digested for 1 h at 37 °C with chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku) (0.01 units/μg of protein) in 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate. To remove the free glycosaminoglycan fragments after digestion, proteins were in some cases dialyzed against 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.15 m NaCl (TBS) prior to use in microtiter plate binding assays. Complete digestion was verified by SDS-PAGE. Prior toN-glycanase treatments NG2 fragments were denatured by boiling for 5 min in sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6, containing 0.4% SDS and 2% β-mercaptoethanol. Nonidet P-40 was then added to a final concentration of 2.5%. Denatured proteins were digested withN-glycanase (Genzyme) (0.1 units/μg of protein) for 2 h at 37 °C and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Binding assays were performed in microtiter plates (Greiner, Nurtingen, Germany) following previously described protocols (35Aumailley M. Wiedemann H. Mann K. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Wells coated with the first ligand (5 μg/ml, 100 μl) were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in TBS. All further incubation steps were carried out in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. Soluble ligands were used over a concentration range of 0.4–50 μg/ml. In inhibition experiments, a fixed concentration (5 μg/ml) of soluble ligand was incubated 3 h at 4 °C with various concentrations of inhibitors (chondroitin sulfate (Sigma) or recombinant NG2 fragments) prior to addition to the coated wells. For detection of bound ligands, different antibodies were used. Antibodies against rat NG2 were affinity-purified from a polyclonal antiserum on a Sepharose column coupled to the recombinant NG2 fragment NG2EC. A polyclonal antiserum against human pepsin-extracted collagen VI was provided by R. Timpl. Antibodies (purified IgG fraction of a polyclonal antiserum) to human pepsinized collagen V were obtained from Dr. D. J. Hartmann (Institut Pasteur, Lyon, France). NG2 samples were diluted to 10 μg/ml with 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate. For preparation of NG2 complexes, NG2 molecules were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1:1 molar ratios of collagen VI, collagen V, or monoclonal antibodies diluted in 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate. Samples were sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica sheets and immediately placed on the holder of a MED 010 evaporator (Balzers). Rotary shadowing was carried out as described previously (34Ruggiero F. Champliaud M.-F. Garrone R. Aumailley M. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 210: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Observations of replicas were performed with a Philips CM120 microscope at the Center de Microscopie Electronique Appliquée à la Biologie et à la Géologie, Université Claude Bernard Lyon I. Several stable human 293 cell clones were obtained, which expressed different fragments of the NG2 proteoglycan. These fragments are summarized in Fig. 1. The construct NG2EC codes for the entire extracellular part of NG2. This region can be roughly divided into three domains (9Nishiyama A. Dahlin K.J. Prince J.T. Johnstone S.R. Stallcup W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar): domain 1, the N-terminal region containing 8 cysteine residues; the central domain 2 lacking cysteine residues but containing the putative attachment sites for chondroitin sulfate chains; and domain 3, the membrane proximal region containing two cysteine clusters. A construct coding for domain 1 and the main part of domain 2 is designated ECΔ3. Two smaller constructs correspond to the internal domains of NG2, D2 and D3. For production of these four polypeptides, serum-free medium from 293 cell clones or 293 EBNA-transfected cells was screened by SDS-PAGE for the presence of proteins of the expected sizes, which were absent in medium from nontransfected 293 cells (36Tillet E. Wiedemann H. Golbik R. Pan T.-C. Zhang R.-Z. Mann K. Chu M.-L. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Expression of the correct protein was confirmed by Western blotting with a polyclonal antiserum against NG2 (data not shown). Positive cells showed significant production and secretion of recombinant NG2 fragments, ranging from 0.3 μg/ml for D2 to 8 μg/ml for NG2EC. For both fragments NG2EC and ECΔ3, ∼50% of the core proteins were substituted by chondroitin sulfate chains and migrated on SDS-PAGE as broad bands of high molecular mass (∼350–450 kDa). The other portion of these two recombinant proteins is represented by the protein core free of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains (Fig. 2). NG2EC and ECΔ3 could be purified from the cell culture medium by DEAE chromatography. Recombinant proteins were easily separated from media contaminants, since they bind strongly to the anion exchange resin. Moreover, the DEAE column allows separation of the protein core from the proteoglycan form of the same fragment. A first peak, eluting at 0.4 m NaCl, contains the protein core free of GAG chains (P1). The proteoglycan form (P2) requires 0.55m NaCl for elution. In the case of both NG2EC and ECΔ3, digestion of P2 with chondroitinase ABC gives a pattern similar to that seen with proteins from P1 (Fig. 2). The ECΔ3 protein core fragment appears by electrophoresis as a single band of 180 kDa, but SDS-PAGE of the NG2EC fragment reveals the presence of at least four bands ranging from 250 to 290 kDa, all of which are reactive with a polyclonal antiserum against intact NG2. However, using a polyclonal antiserum against a synthetic peptide located at the C-terminal end of the ectodomain of NG2 (residues 2161–2179; Ref. 37Nishiyama A. Lin X.H. Stallcup W.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1819-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), only the high molecular mass 290-kDa species could be detected by Western blotting. This indicates that proteolytic processing of the recombinant NG2EC occurs at the C-terminal end (data not shown).Figure 2SDS electrophoresis of purified recombinant NG2 fragments prior to (−) or after (+) chondroitinase ABC digestion. P1 and P2 designate the two different DEAE pools of purified proteins as described in the text. Proteins were run on a 6% gel (NG2 EC), 7.5% gel (D2 and D3) and 4–12% gradient gel (ECΔ3). Gels were calibrated with globular molecular mass marker standards (indicated in left margins in kilodaltons). Additional bands visible in the + lanes correspond to the chondroitinase ABC itself.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The two internal NG2 fragments D2 and D3 have 6 histidine residues added to their C-terminal ends and were affinity purified by nickel-agarose chromatography. D3 is expressed as a 100-kDa polypeptide free of glycosaminoglycan chains (Fig. 2). Purified D2 appeared on electrophoresis as two bands of 110 and 125 kDa. Edman degradation of both bands showed the same N-terminal sequence, APLARGGPAQD, which corresponds to the expected sequence from the construct PCEP4/D2 (starting at position 632 in the NG2 sequence). Since both the 110- and 125-kDa proteins have been affinity-purified by means of the 6 histidine residues at their C-terminal ends, it seems likely that the difference in electrophoretic migration of the two polypeptides results from posttranslational modifications other than proteolytic processing. These modifications did not involve N-glycosylation, as judged by the electrophoretic pattern seen after N-glycanase treatment; the increase in electrophoretic mobility of both species indicates that they are equally N-glycosylated. In addition, a portion of the recombinant D2 molecules contain some GAG chains and migrate in SDS-PAGE as a broad band of 250–300 kDa. However, the proteoglycan form of D2 does not exceed 20% (Fig. 2). The molecular masses of all NG2 fragments were higher than the calculated masses based on the amino acid sequence. Treatment of the recombinant polypeptides with N-glycanase resulted in a reduction of the apparent molecular masses by 6–15%. The highest extent of glycosylation was observed in the D3 domain. This indicates that most if not all of the predicted N-glycosylation sites are occupied in this domain, whereas only 50% of the sites in the more N-terminal part of the molecule appear to be glycosylated. We have previously shown that the NG2 proteoglycan interacts with collagen VI both in vitro in solid phase assays (26Burg M.A. Tillet E. Timpl R. Stallcup W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26110-26116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and in situ, in which it anchors the collagen at the cell surface (27Nishiyama A. Stallcup W.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1097-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar,32Stallcup W.B. Dahlin K. Healy P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3177-3188Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In addition, NG2 seemed to be able to interact with other collagen types, particularly the fibrillar collagens II and V. The recombinant NG2 fragments give us the ability to study in more detail these interactions between NG2 and collagens. When NG2EC and ECΔ3 fragments were used as soluble ligands for different immobilized collagens, strong and saturable binding of both fragments was obtained to pepsin-solubilized human collagens V and VI (Fig. 3,A and B). In contrast, no binding of either fragment to collagens I and II was detected. Using radiolabeled ligand, apparent dissociation constants of 140 and 70 nm were derived for binding of ECΔ3 to type V and VI collagens, respectively (data not shown). Additional studies were carried out to compare the binding ability of the two different pools of the NG2EC and ECΔ3 recombinant proteins obtained from the DEAE purification, P2 containing GAG chains and P1 representing the protein core. Fig. 3, A and B, shows that only the recombinant fragments possessing chondroitin sulfate chains (P2) are able to bind to immobilized collagens V and VI. Although these results initially indicated to us that NG2 binding to type V and VI collagens was mediated by the chondroitin sulfate chains, additional experiments showed that this was not the case. First, the P2 pools of the fragments NG2 EC and ECΔ3 were digested by chondroitinase ABC prior to use in binding assays. Although digestion appeared complete when analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis (see Fig.2), both undigested and digested P2 samples bound more strongly to collagen V or VI than the corresponding P1 samples (Fig.3 C). Second, we could show that increasing concentrations of free chondroitin sulfate in the binding assay do not inhibit the binding of either P2 recombinant fragment to collagen VI (Fig.4). Finally, when collagens were used as the soluble ligands, no difference was seen between the ability of immobilized P1 and P2 forms of ECΔ3 to bind both collagens V and VI (Fig.5). Similar results were obtained with the NG2EC fragment (not shown). Taken altogether, these results suggest that the chondroitin sulfate chains of NG2 do not participate directly in the binding of NG2 to collagens. The inability of P1 pools of NG2 EC and ECΔ3 to bind effectively to immobilized collagens V and VI remains an anomaly. Although this result may represent a quirk of the solid phase binding assay (involving hidden versus exposed epitopes on the immobilized molecules), it could also indicate that addition of GAG chains to the NG2 core polypeptide induces a conformational state that facilitates binding to the collagens. Adsorption of P1 polypeptides to plastic might produce a conformation that mimics that of the P2 polypeptide.Figure 5Binding of soluble collagens to the recombinant NG2 fragment ECΔ3.

These changes are in addition to grafting of the antigen-binding loops. Although guided by molecular modeling, assessment of which framework changes are beneficial to antigen binding usually requires the analysis of many different antibody mutants. Here we describe a phage display method for optimizing the framework of humanized antibodies by random mutagenesis of important framework residues. We have applied this method to humanization of the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor murine monoclonal antibody A4.6.1. Affinity panning of a library of humanized A4.6.1 antibody mutants led to the selection of one variant with greater than 125-fold enhanced affinity for antigen relative to the initial humanized antibody with no framework changes. A single additional mutation gave a further 6-fold improvement in binding. The affinity of this variant, 9.3 nm, was only 6-fold weaker than that of a murine/human chimera of A4.6.1. This method provides a general means of rapidly selecting framework mutations that improve the binding of humanized antibodies to their cognate antigens and may prove an attractive alternative to current methods of framework optimization based on cycles of site-directed mutagenesis.

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 1The abbreviations used are: mAb, monoclonal antibody; CDR, complementarity-determining region; VL, light chain variable region; VLκI, kappa light chain variable region subgroup I; VH, heavy chain variable region; VHIII, heavy chain variable region subgroup III; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: mAb, monoclonal antibody; CDR, complementarity-determining region; VL, light chain variable region; VLκI, kappa light chain variable region subgroup I; VH, heavy chain variable region; VHIII, heavy chain variable region subgroup III; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. have enormous potential as therapeutic agents; however, most mAbs are derived from murine or other non-human sources, which severely limits their clinical efficacy. In addition to the immunogenicity of rodent mAbs when administered to humans (1Jaffers G.J. Fuller T.C. Cosimi A.B. Russell P.S. Winn H.J. Colvin R.B.

Bebbington C. Nesbitt A. Sopwith M. Athwal D. Novak C. Bodmer M. Immunology. 1995; 85: 668-674PubMed Google Scholar). As a means of circumventing these deficiences, the antigen-binding properties of murine mAbs can be conferred to human antibodies through a process known as antibody “humanization” (4Riechmann L. Clark M. Waldmann H. Winter G. Nature. 1988; 332: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar,8Jones P.T. Dear P.H. Foote J. Neuberger M.S. Winter G. Nature. 1986; 321: 522-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). A humanized antibody contains the amino acid sequences from the six complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of the parent murine mAb, which are grafted onto a human antibody framework. For this reason, humanization of non-human antibodies is commonly referred to as CDR grafting. The low content of non-human sequence in humanized antibodies (∼5%) has proven effective in both reducing the immunogenicity and prolonging the serum half-life in humans (7Stephens S. Emtage S.

Unfortunately, simple grafting of CDR sequences often yields humanized antibodies that bind antigen much more weakly than the parent murine mAb (4Riechmann L. Clark M. Waldmann H. Winter G.

Proteins. 1994; 18: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To restore high affinity, the antibody must be further engineered to fine tune the structure of the antigen-binding loops. This is achieved by replacing key residues in the framework regions of the antibody variable domains with the matching sequence from the parent murine antibody. These framework residues are usually involved in supporting the conformation of the CDR loops (17Chothia C. Lesk A.M. Tramontano A. Levitt M. Smith-Gill S.J. Air G. Sheriff S. Padlan E.A. Davies D. Tulip W.R. Colman P.M. Spinelli S. Alzari P.M. Poljak R.J. Nature. 1989; 342: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar), although some framework residues may themselves directly contact the antigen (18Mian I.S. Bradwell A.R. Olson A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 133-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Chothia and Lesk (19Chothia C. Lesk A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 901-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar) first noted the importance of certain framework residues to CDR conformation, and a comprehensive examination of all framework residues that can affect antigen binding was conducted by Foote and Winter (20Foote J. Winter G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 487-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). These authors tabulated a list of some 30 “Vernier” residues that can potentially contribute to CDR structure. Although higher antigen affinity would likely result from editing the entire set of Vernier residues within a humanized antibody to match the corresponding parent murine sequence, this is not generally desirable given the increased risk of immunogenicity imposed by adding further elements of murine sequence. Thus, from a therapeutic standpoint it is preferable to confine framework changes to the minimum set that affords a high affinity humanized antibody. As shown in the literature (4Riechmann L. Clark M. Waldmann H. Winter G. Nature. 1988; 332: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar, 10Queen C. Schneider W.P. Selick H.E. Payne P.W. Landolfi N.F. Duncan J.F. Avdalovic N.M.

Immunol. 1996; 156: 2840-2850PubMed Google Scholar), the task of identifying framework residues that affect antigen binding is the most challenging and time-consuming aspect of antibody humanization. Although these critical framework residues are generally derived from the large set proposed by Foote and Winter (20Foote J. Winter G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 487-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), a small set of changes will usually suffice to optimize binding, although these often differ from one humanized antibody to the next. Whereas a molecular model of the humanized antibody can provide valuable guidance, the proper combination of mutations must be determined by experiment. Typically, this is achieved by preparing a panel of mutants with “suspect” framework residues replaced by their murine counterparts. These variants are each tested for antigen binding, and favorable mutations that enhance affinity are combined into a final variant. As a means of simplifying antibody humanization, a number of different approaches have been developed. A common method is to select the human framework most homologous in sequence to that of the murine antibody of interest (10Queen C. Schneider W.P. Selick H.E. Payne P.W. Landolfi N.F. Duncan J.F. Avdalovic N.M. Levitt M. Junghans R.P. Waldmann T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 10029-10033Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 11Kettleborough C.A. Saldanha J. Heath V.J. Morrison C.J. Bendig M.M. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 773-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 12Tempest P.R. Bremner P. Lambert M. Taylor G. Furze J.M. Carr F.J. Harris W.J. Biotechnology. 1991; 9: 266-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In this way, the number of mismatches between the humanized and parent murine framework is minimized, and it becomes less likely that a key framework residue will need to be replaced. However, it should be noted that even a single incorrect framework residue can have a dramatic effect on antigen binding (11Kettleborough C.A. Saldanha J. Heath V.J. Morrison C.J. Bendig M.M. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 773-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). An alternative humanization strategy was originally proposed by Padlan (21Padlan E.A. Mol. Immunol. 1991; 28: 489-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar): here, rather than grafting the CDRs onto a human framework, the entire murine variable domains are retained and select framework residues are replaced with human sequence. Only those residues on the surface of the antibody framework, as defined by exposure to solvent, are targeted for replacement. These residues are considered unimportant for antigen binding but most likely to contribute to any potential immunogenicity. On the other hand, buried residues are retained as the murine sequence since these are most likely to affect the structure (and thus antigen binding) of the antibody but are of low immunogenicity since they are in effect “hidden” from the immune system. Although this approach has been successfully used to humanize two different murine mAbs (22Roguska M.A. Pedersen J.T. Keddy C.A. Henry A.H. Searle S.J. Lambert J.M. Goldmacher V.S. Blattler W.A. Rees A.R. Guild B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 969-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar,23Studnicka G.M. Soares S. Better M. Williams R.E. Nadell R. Horwitz A.H. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 805-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), it remains to be seen whether these antibodies are indeed nonimmunogenic, since even buried residues can invoke a T-cell immune response if presented as a denatured peptide by a class II major histocompatability complex molecule (24Allen P.M. Matsueda G.R. Haber E. Unanue E.R. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 368-373PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to these other techniques, an alternative approach is to humanize antibodies using only a single human framework, regardless of the sequence of the parent murine antibody. This method has been successfully used to humanize a number of murine antibodies (13Carter P. Presta L. Gorman C.M. Ridgway J.B. Henner D. Wong W.L. Rowland A.M. Kotts C. Carver M.E. Shepard H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4285-4289Crossref PubMed Scopus (1527) Google Scholar, 14Presta L.G. Lahr S.J. Shields R.L. Porter J.P. Gorman C.M. Fendly B.M. Jardieu P.M. J.

Med. 1992; 175: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) using a framework derived from consensus sequences of the most abundant human subclasses, namely VLκ subgroup I (VLκI) and VH subgroup III (VHIII) (26Kabat E.A. Wu T.T. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S. Foeller C. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest. 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1991Google Scholar). Use of the most common human VLand VH frameworks minimizes any potential immunogenicity of the humanized antibody and also eliminates possible idiosyncracies associated with any one particular framework. In addition, this framework has been demonstrated to give good yields of antibody when expressed recombinantly in either Escherichia coli or eukaryotic expression systems, an important consideration for antibodies that are to go into large scale development for clinical applications. Based on the collective data from these and other unpublished antibody humanizations, we have observed that the framework residues that most often influence antigen binding are consistently derived from a set of only 11 residues. We have incorporated this information into the design of a random mutagenesis approach to antibody humanization. By randomizing this small set of critical framework residues and by monovalent display of the resultant library of antibody molecules on the surface of filamentous phage (27Bass S. Green R. Wells J.A. Proteins. 1990; 8: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 28Lowman H.B. Bass S.H. Simpson N. Wells J.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10832-10838Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), optimal framework sequences can be identified via affinity-based selection. Here we describe the application of this approach to the humanization of the murine antibody A4.6.1 (29Kim K.J. Li B. Houck K. Winer J. Ferrara F. Growth Factors. 1992; 7: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 30Kim K.J. Li B. Winer J. Armanini M. Gillett N. Phillips H.S. Ferrara N. Nature. 1993; 362: 841-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (3253) Google Scholar), an antibody that binds to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The murine anti-VEGF mAb A4.6.1 blocks VEGF receptor binding and has been described previously (29Kim K.J. Li B. Houck K. Winer J. Ferrara F. Growth Factors. 1992; 7: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 30Kim K.J. Li B. Winer J. Armanini M. Gillett N. Phillips H.S. Ferrara N. Nature. 1993; 362: 841-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (3253) Google Scholar). The first Fab variant of humanized A4.6.1, hu2.0, was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using a deoxyuridine-containing template of plasmid pAK2 (13Carter P. Presta L. Gorman C.M. Ridgway J.B. Henner D. Wong W.L. Rowland A.M. Kotts C. Carver M.E. Shepard H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4285-4289Crossref PubMed Scopus (1527) Google Scholar) that codes for a human VLκI-Cκ1 light chain and human VHIII-CH1γ1 heavy chain Fd fragment. The transplanted A4.6.1 CDR sequences were chosen according to the sequence definition of Kabat et al. (26Kabat E.A. Wu T.T. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S. Foeller C. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest. 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1991Google Scholar), except for CDR-H1, which we extended to encompass both sequence and structural (19Chothia C. Lesk A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 901-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar) definitions, viz. VH residues 26–35. The Fab encoding sequence was subcloned into the phagemid vector phGHamg3 (27Bass S. Green R. Wells J.A. Proteins. 1990; 8: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 28Lowman H.B. Bass S.H. Simpson N. Wells J.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10832-10838Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). This final construct, pMB4-19, encodes the initial humanized A4.6.1 Fab, hu2.0, with the carboxyl terminus of the heavy chain fused precisely to the carboxyl portion of the M13 gene III coat protein. pMB4-19 is similar in construction to pDH188, a previously described plasmid for monovalent display of Fab fragments (31Garrard L.J. Yang M. O'Connell M.P. Kelley R.F. Henner D.J. Biotechnology. 1991; 9: 1373-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Notable differences between pMB4-19 and pDH188 include a shorter M13 gene III segment (codons 249–406) and use of an amber stop codon immediately following the antibody heavy chain Fd fragment. This permits expression of both secreted heavy chain or heavy chain-gene III fusions insupE suppressor strains of E. coli. E. coli strain 34B8, a nonsuppressor, was transformed with phagemid pMB4-19 or variants thereof. Single colonies were grown overnight at 37 °C in 5 mL of 2YT medium containing 50 μg/mL carbenicillin. These cultures were diluted into 200 mL of AP5 medium (32Chang C.N. Rey M. Bochner B. Heyneker H. Gray G. Gene. 1987; 55: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) containing 20 μg/mL carbenicillin and incubated for 26 h at 30 °C. The cells were pelleted at 4000 ×g and frozen at −20 °C for at least 2 h. Cell pellets were then resuspended in 5 mL of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) containing 1 mm EDTA, shaken at 4 °C for 90 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was applied to a 1-mL streptococcal protein G-Sepharose column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and washed with 10 mL of 10 mm MES (pH 5.5). The bound Fab fragment was eluted with 2.5 mL of 100 mm acetic acid and immediately neutralized with 0.75 mL of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Fab preparations were buffer-exchanged into PBS and concentrated using Centricon-30 concentrators (Amicon). Typical yields of Fab were ∼1 mg/L culture after protein G purification. Purified Fab samples were characterized by electrospray mass spectrometry, and concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis. The humanized A4.6.1 phagemid library was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis according to the method of Kunkel et al. (33Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). A derivative of pMB4-19 containing TAA stop triplets at VHcodons 24, 37, 67, and 93 was prepared for use as the mutagenesis template (all sequence numbering is according to Kabat et al. (26Kabat E.A. Wu T.T. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S. Foeller C. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest. 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1991Google Scholar)). This modification was to prevent subsequent background contamination by wild type sequences. The codons targeted for randomization were 4 and 71 (light chain) and 24, 37, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 76, 78, 93, and 94 (heavy chain). To randomize heavy chain codons 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 76, 78, 93, and 94 with a single mutagenic oligonucleotide, two 126-mer oligonucleotides were first preassembled from 60-mer and 66-mer fragments by template-assisted enzymatic ligation. Briefly, 1.5 nmol of 5′ phosphorylated oligonucleotide 503-1 (GAT TTC AAA CGT CGTNYT ACT WTT TCT AGA GAC AAC TCC AAA AAC ACABYT TAC CTG CAG ATG AAC) or 503-2 (GAT TTC AAA CGT CGTNYT ACT WTT TCT TTA GACACC TCC GCA AGC ACA BYT TAC CTG CAG ATG AAC) were combined with 1.5 nmol of 503-3 (AGC CTG CGC GCT GAG GAC ACT GCC GTC TAT TAC TGT DYA ARG TAC CCC CAC TAT TAT GGG) (randomized codons underlined; N = A/G/T/C; W = A/T; B = G/T/C; D = G/A/T; R = A/G; Y = C/T). 1.5 nmol of template oligonucleotide (CTC AGC GCG CAG GCT GTT CAT CTG CAG GTA), with complementary sequence to the 5′ ends of 503-1/503-2 and the 3′ end of 503-3, was added to hybridize each end of the ligation junction. Taq ligase and ligase buffer (New England Biolabs) were added, and the reaction mixture was subjected to 40 rounds of thermal cycling, (95 °C for 1.25 min, 50 °C for 5 min) to cycle the template oligonucleotide between ligated and unligated junctions. The product 126-mer oligonucleotides were purified on a 6% urea, TBE polyacrylamide gel and extracted from the polyacrylamide in buffer. The two 126-mer products were combined in equal ratio, ethanol precipitated, and finally solubilized in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA. The mixed 126-mer oligonucleotide product was designated 504-01. Randomization of select framework codons (VL, 4 and 71; VH, 24, 37, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 76, 93, and 94) was effected in two steps. First, VL randomization was achieved by preparing three additional derivatives of the modified pMB4-19 template. Framework codons 4 and 71 in the light chain were replaced individually or pairwise using the two mutagenic oligonucleotides GCT GAT ATC CAG TTG ACC CAG TCC CCG and TCT GGG ACG GATTAC ACT CTG ACC ATC. Deoxyuridine-containing template was prepared from each of these new derivatives. Together with the original template, these four constructs coded for each of the four possible light chain framework sequence combinations (see Table I). VH 71, 73, 75, and 76 randomized to yield the all-murine (L71/T73/A75/S76) or all-human (R71/D73/K75/N76) VHIII tetrad. Oligonucleotides 504-1, a mixture of two 126-mer oligonucleotides (see above), and CGT TTG TCC TGT GCA RYT TCT GGC TAT ACC TTC ACC AAC TAT GGT ATG AAC TGG RTC CGT CAG GCC CCG GGT AAG were used to randomize heavy chain framework codons using each of the four templates just described. The four libraries were electroporated intoE. coli XL-1 Blue cells (Stratagene) and combined. The total number of independent transformants was estimated at >1.2 × 108, approximately 1500-fold greater than the maximum number of DNA sequences in the library. Phagemid particles displaying the humanized A4.6.1 Fab fragments were propagated in E. coli XL-1 Blue cells. Briefly, cells harboring the randomized pMB4-19 construct were grown overnight at 37 °C in 25 mL of 2YT medium containing 50 μg/mL carbenicillin and approximately 1010 M13KO7 helper phage (34Vieira J. Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1976) Google Scholar). Phagemid stocks were purified from culture supernatants by precipitation with a saline polyethylene glycol solution and resuspended in 100 μL of PBS (∼1014 phagemid/mL) Purified VEGF1–121 (100 μL at 10 μg/mL in PBS) was coated onto a microtiter plate well overnight at 4 °C. The coating solution was discarded and this well, in addition to an uncoated well, was blocked with 6% skim milk for 1 h and washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. 10 μL of phagemid stock, diluted to 100 μL with 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween 20, was added to each well. After 2 h the wells were washed and the bound phage eluted with 100 μL of 0.1 mglycine (pH 2.0) and neutralized with 25 μL of 1 m Tris, pH 8.0. An aliquot of this was used to titer the number of phage eluted. The remaining phage eluted from the VEGF-coated well were propagated for use in the next selection cycle. A total of eight rounds of selection was performed, after which time 20 individual clones were selected and sequenced (35Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (51649) Google Scholar). Association and dissociation rate constants for binding of humanized A4.6.1 Fab variants to VEGF1–121 were measured by surface plasmon resonance (36Karlsson R. Michaelsson A. Mattsson L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 145: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar) on a Pharmacia BIAcore instrument. VEGF1–121 was covalently immobilized on the biosensor chip via primary amino groups. Binding of humanized A4.6.1 Fab variants was measured by flowing solutions of Fab in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 over the chip at a flow rate of 20 μL/min. Following each binding measurement, residual Fab was stripped from the immobilized ligand by washing with 5 μL of 50 mm aqueous HCl at 3 μL/min. Binding profiles were analyzed by nonlinear regression using a simple monovalent binding model (BIAevaluation software version 2.0, Pharmacia). An initial humanized A4.6.1 Fab fragment was constructed (hu2.0) (Fig. 1) in which the CDRs from A4.6.1 were grafted onto a human VLκI-VHIII framework. All other residues in hu2.0 were maintained as the human sequence. Binding of this variant to VEGF was so weak that it was undetectable. Based on the relative affinity of other weakly binding humanized A4.6.1 variants (data not shown), the K d for binding of hu2.0 was estimated at >7 μm. This contrasts with an affinity of 1.6 nm for a chimeric Fab construct consisting of the intact VL and VH domains from murine A4.6.1 and human constant domains. Thus, binding of hu2.0 to VEGF was reduced at least 4000-fold relative to the chimera. The absence of detectable VEGF binding by variant hu2.0 highlights the important role of the framework in properly structuring the CDR loops for antigen binding. Based on the cumulative results from humanizing a number of murine antibodies onto a human VLκI-VHIII framework (13Carter P. Presta L. Gorman C.M. Ridgway J.B. Henner D. Wong W.L. Rowland A.M.

https://openalex.org/W2065671146,"Globin synthesis in a wheat germ cell-free translation system was performed in the presence of [<sup>3</sup>H]hemin and [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine to determine the minimal length of the nascent ribosome-bound globin chain capable of heme binding. Nascent polypeptides of predetermined size were synthesized on ribosomes by translation of truncated mRNA molecules. Analysis with the use of sucrose gradient centrifugation and puromycin reaction revealed that the ribosome-bound N-terminal α-globin fragments of 140, 100, and 86 amino acid residues are capable of an efficient heme binding, whereas those of 75, 65, and 34 amino acid residues display a significantly weaker, or just nonspecific, affinity to heme. This indicates that the ribosome-bound nascent chain of 86 amino acid residues has already acquired a spatial structure that allows its interaction with the heme group or that heme attachment promotes the formation of the proper tertiary structure in the ribosome-bound nascent peptide. In any case the cotranslational folding of globin is suggested."

SHIP has homology to several previously identified 5′-inositol phosphatases that have been linked to certain congenital metabolic disorders (42Zhang X. Jefferson A. Auethavekiat V. Majerus P. Proc.

Moreover, SHIP has been shown to dephosphorylate the 5′ position of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-P3 and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (39Damen J. Liu L. Rosten P. Humphries R. Jefferson A.

The precise role of SHIP in regulating inositol lipids in vivo and the influence of these phosphoinositides (generated by SHIP-mediated dephosphorylation) on downstream signaling events remain unclear. SHIP has been implicated in inhibitory signaling via FcγRIIb on mast cells (44Ono M. Bolland S. Tempst P. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar) and mitogenic signaling via macrophage CSF (41Lioubin M.N. Algate P.A. Tsai S. Carlberg K. Aebersold R. Rohrschneider L.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1084-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Since 3′-OH-phosphorylated inositol lipids are generated by the triggering of many receptors (through the action of the enzyme phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) (45Carpenter C. Cantley L.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar), the dephosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-P3 by SHIP could down-regulate signals via phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-P3; alternatively, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-P2, the product of the SHIP-mediated dephosphorylation, could lead to activation of kinases such as Akt (45Carpenter C. Cantley L.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which SHIP regulates signaling via these receptors are not yet understood. In vivo, SHIP may be regulated through alteration of its catalytic activity or through its association with other proteins such as Shc. The initial studies reported that, during macrophage CSF and IL-3 signaling (39Damen J. Liu L. Rosten P. Humphries R. Jefferson A. Majerus P. Krystal G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1689-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 41Lioubin M.N. Algate P.A. Tsai S. Carlberg K. Aebersold R. Rohrschneider L.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1084-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), there was no detectable alteration of the catalytic activity of SHIP following receptor activation. This suggested that the interaction of SHIP with Shc and, in turn, the subcellular localization of the Shc·SHIP complex may be quite important in SHIP-mediated regulation of specific phosphoinositides. The details of the in vivo molecular interaction between Shc and SHIP have not been elucidated. Some in vitro studies indicated a direct binding of the PTB domain to phosphorylated SHIP (21Kavanaugh W. Williams L. Science. 1994; 266: 1862-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 37Ravichandran K.S. Lorenz U. Shoelson S. Burakoff S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 593-600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, Liu et al. (46Liu L. Damen J. Cutler R. Crystal G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6926-6935Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), based on in vitro studies, have proposed that the SH2 domain of SHIP may also reciprocally bind to phosphorylated Shc. In this report, we have addressed the in vivo requirements for the interaction between Shc and SHIP during T cell receptor signaling. Our data show that the Shc-PTB domain and specific tyrosine residues within the COOH terminus of SHIP mediate their association in vivo. The murine T cell hybridoma (BYDP) has been described previously (47Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 727-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and was grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin, and 2-mercaptoethanol (2 × 10−5m).

DNA encoding GST-tagged full-length (FL) wt Shc, FL Shc R175Q, PTB domain alone (Shc-PTB), or the CH and SH2 domains of Shc (Shc CH-SH2) were generated by polymerase chain reaction and subcloning of DNA fragments into the pEBG vector, as described previously (36Pratt J.C.

GST-tagged SHIP constructs were also generated using the same strategy, and a polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis was used to generate the various mutants (36Pratt J.C. Weiss M. Sieff C.

To generate hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged constructs, oligonucleotides encoding three HA tags in tandem were cloned into the pEBB vector (48Tanaka M. Gupta R. Mayer B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6829-6837Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), and the DNA encoding different SHIP regions were subcloned in-frame at the 3′ end of the tag. All constructs were sequenced, and the presence of appropriate mutations was confirmed. The Lck cDNA cloned into pEF vector was kindly provided by Dr. Tomas Mustelin. Antibody specific for the SH2 domain of SHIP has been described previously (39Damen J. Liu L. Rosten P. Humphries R. Jefferson A. Majerus P. Krystal G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Antibodies specific for Shc and GST were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Kentucky) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-Tyr(P) antibody (RC20H) was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-HA antibody 12CA5 was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Transient transfections into COS cells were performed with DEAE-dextran and chloroquine as described previously (36Pratt J.C. Weiss M. Sieff C. Shoelson S. Burakoff S.J. Ravichandran K.S. J. Biol.

Approximately 24 h post-transfection, the cells were starved overnight without serum and harvested, and the proteins were analyzed as described below. Transient transfections into BYDP cells (1 × 107/ml in growth medium) were performed by electroporation using 50 μg of the indicated DNA (Cell Porator, Life Technologies, Inc.) at 250 V and 1180 microfarads. The transfected cells (after approximately 24 h) were stimulated and processed as described below. BYDP cells stably expressing Shc proteins were generated by using the electroporation conditions described above with 20 μg of the relevant plasmids co-transfected with 5 μg of pMHneo plasmid for selection (50Hahn W.C. Menzin E. Saito T. Germain R.N. Bierer B.E. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 127: 267-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours post-transfection, the cells were plated out at 2 × 104 cells/well in 48-well plates in medium containing G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Individual clones were screened by Western blotting for expression of the proteins of interest, and positive clones that expressed roughly equivalent levels of the different proteins were used in further studies. BYDP cells (1–2 × 107/ml) were incubated with anti-TCR antibody (F23.1 at 1 μg/ml) and/or anti-CD4 antibody (OKT4D at 1 μg/ml) for 10 min on ice. Rabbit anti-mouse IgG was added (7.5 μg/ml) for cross-linking, and the cells were incubated for an additional 10 min on ice. The cells were stimulated at 37 °C for 2 min, washed, and lysed (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 10 μg each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were spun at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the proteins were precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (for GST-tagged proteins) or with the indicated antibodies and protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The beads were washed (with a buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm NaF, and 10 μg each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin), and the bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher and Schuell), immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies, and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). We have previously observed (11Ravichandran K.S. Lee K.K. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Burn P. Burakoff S.J. Science. 1993; 262: 902-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 35Ravichandran K.S.

We first determined if this p145 protein represents SHIP (17Damen J.E. Liu L. Cutler R.L. Krystal G. Blood. 1993; 82: 2296-2303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,40Kavanaugh W. Pot D. Chin S.

Nature. 1996; 383: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of Shc following cross-linking of TCR with CD4 and immunoblotting with antibodies specific for SHIP demonstrated that the 145-kDa phosphoprotein is in fact SHIP (Fig.1 a). This band co-migrated with SHIP proteins detected in direct anti-SHIP immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 a). Two additional observations were made. First, SHIP associated with Shc only upon activation. Second, very little tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP was detected in unstimulated T cell lysates. This is in contrast to the previous observations in IL-3-dependent cells where there was considerable basal phosphorylation of SHIP, which was augmented by IL-3 stimulation (39Damen J. Liu L. Rosten P. Humphries R. Jefferson A. Majerus P. Krystal G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1689-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). We observe a similar basal phosphorylation of SHIP in the IL-2-dependent cell line CTLL-20 (data not shown). Thus, different cell types may have variations in the levels of basal tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP, which may have implications for SHIP functional activity. However, it is important to note that despite the basal tyrosine phosphorylation, SHIP associated with Shc only upon IL-2 and IL-3 stimulation (data not shown and Ref. 39Damen J. Liu L. Rosten P. Humphries R. Jefferson A. Majerus P. Krystal G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1689-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). We also observed that cross-linking of the TCR with the co-receptor CD4 enhances the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP. As shown in Fig.1 b, cross-linking of CD4 alone or cross-linking of TCR alone led to detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP, while activation via both receptors significantly enhanced the phosphorylation on SHIP. Since CD4 is physically associated with the tyrosine kinase Lck and the Lck kinase activity is enhanced by CD4 cross-linking, Lck may play a role in phosphorylation of SHIP, either directly or indirectly. Consistent with this notion, co-expression of Lck with SHIP leads to efficient tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP in COS cells (see below). Shc contains two domains capable of interacting with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins: an amino-terminal PTB domain and a COOH-terminal SH2 domain (7Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J.

To determine which region(s) of Shc is necessary for interaction with SHIP, we generated stable murine T cell lines expressing either the Shc-PTB domain alone (GST-Shc-PTB) or the CH and SH2 domains of Shc (GST-Shc CH-SH2), tagged at the amino terminus with GST (Fig. 2 a). Cells expressing comparable amounts of the GST-tagged Shc proteins or control cells expressing the GST tag alone were used in all of the studies described below, and the data shown are representative of several independent clones derived from multiple transfections. When cells expressing the GST-Shc-PTB were activated via the T cell receptor and the cell lysates were precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose beads, SHIP was co-precipitated with Shc-PTB only upon activation (Fig. 2 b). In control cells, the GST tag alone did not precipitate SHIP. This is consistent with our previous in vitro studies (35Ravichandran K.S. Igras V. Shoelson S.E. Fesik S.W. Burakoff S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5275-5280Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) using bacterially expressed Shc proteins which had indicated a PTB-dependent interaction with SHIP. Comparison of cells expressing the PTB or the CH-SH2 domains of Shc indicated that SHIP co-precipitates only with the PTB domain and not with the CH or SH2 domains of Shc (Fig. 2 c). Thus, we conclude that in vivo, the Shc-PTB domain (and not the SH2 domain) is essential for the interaction with SHIP during T cell receptor signaling. In the Shc·SHIP complexes that occur upon receptor activation, both Shc and SHIP are tyrosine-phosphorylated. With the identification of an SH2 domain in SHIP (39Damen J. Liu L. Rosten P.

Carlberg K. Aebersold R. Rohrschneider L.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1084-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), a second interaction involving SHIP-SH2 binding to phosphorylated Shc has also been proposed (39Damen J. Liu L. Rosten P. Humphries R. Jefferson A. Majerus P. Krystal G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1689-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). In fact, Damen et al. (39Damen J. Liu L. Rosten P. Humphries R. Jefferson A. Majerus P. Krystal G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1689-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) have reported that a phosphopeptide containing the Tyr-317 site of Shc (attached to beads) can precipitate SHIP from cell lysates. While our above data using T cell lines expressing individual domains of Shc clearly demonstrated the requirement for the Shc-PTB domain, it did not exclude a parallel role for the SHIP-SH2 domain in binding to Shc. We examined if this interaction occurs in vivo and determined its relative significance compared with the Shc-PTB binding to phosphorylated SHIP. To specifically test the role of SHIP-SH2, we needed a setting where the Shc proteins will be phosphorylated, yet the PTB domain would no longer be able to interact with SHIP. The rationale was that if SHIP-SH2 does play a role in binding to phosphorylated Shc, then SHIP would co-precipitate with a phosphorylated PTB-defective Shc mutant. We and others (36Pratt J.C.

A. 1996; 93: 963-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) have previously shown that mutation of Arg-175 within the PTB domain abrogates binding to Tyr(P)-containing proteins. Using a transient transfection approach in COS cells, we expressed HA-tagged wt SHIP proteins along with GST-tagged FL wt Shc or FL Shc R175Q. To obtain phosphorylation of the expressed Shc and SHIP proteins, we coexpressed the T cell tyrosine kinase Lck under these conditions. GST-Shc was precipitated, and the co-precipitation of HA-SHIP was examined by both anti-Tyr(P) and anti-HA immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 3, the HA-SHIP proteins were co-precipitated efficiently by wt Shc but not by the R175Q Shc. This again highlighted the role for the PTB domain in this interaction. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 3 (top panel), the Shc wt and the Shc R175Q mutant were comparably tyrosine-phosphorylated. This finding is consistent with our previous data that Tyr-317 appears to be the major, if not the only, site of tyrosine phosphorylation on Shc during T cell activation and that this site is efficiently phosphorylated by Lck in vitro (37Ravichandran K.S. Lorenz U. Shoelson S. Burakoff S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 593-600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in vivo. 2K. S. Ravichandran, unpublished observations. However, despite the phosphorylation on the FL Shc R175Q, SHIP failed to interact with this protein, thereby suggesting lack of a role for the SHIP-SH2 domain in binding to phosphorylated Shc. Furthermore, when the Shc-PTB or CH-SH2 domains were coexpressed with HA-SHIP and Lck, the CH-SH2 domain (which contains Tyr-317), despite its tyrosine phosphorylation, failed to co-precipitate SHIP. On the other hand, the PTB domain, despite the lack of phosphorylation, efficiently co-precipitated SHIP. Comparable expression of Shc and SHIP proteins was confirmed by anti-GST or anti-HA immunoblotting (Fig. 3, 2 bottom panels). Based on these data we conclude that the SHIP-SH2 does not contribute to the Shc-SHIP interaction in vivo. We cannot exclude very weak or transient interactions (that do not withstand the precipitation conditions) that may occur between SHIP-SH2 and phosphorylated Shc. However, this clearly cannot be responsible for the strong interaction that is observed between Shc and SHIP. Thus, our data demonstrate that the interaction of Shc-PTB with tyrosine-phosphorylated SHIP is the primary mode of interaction between these two proteins in vivo. We then determined which tyrosine(s) on SHIP provided the binding site(s) for the Shc-PTB. The preferred binding motif for the Shc-PTB domain has been defined as ΨXNXXY (where Ψ represents hydrophobic residues) through analysis of phosphopeptide binding to Shc-PTB (28Kavanaugh W. Turck C.

Based on this motif, two tyrosines in the COOH-terminal region of SHIP, Tyr-917 and Tyr-1020, were identified as putative Shc-PTB binding sites. To determine if these two tyrosines on SHIP contribute to Shc binding, individual or combined mutations of Tyr-917 and Tyr-1020 to phenylalanine were performed (Fig. 4 a). wt SHIP, Y917F, Y1020F, or Y917F/Y1020F double mutant SHIP proteins (all tagged with GST) were transiently expressed in the murine hybridoma cells. After T cell activation, the expressed proteins were precipitated using glutathione-Sepharose beads, and the tyrosine phosphorylation status of these proteins was assessed by anti-Tyr(P) immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 4 b, compared with wt SHIP, the phosphorylation of Y917F and Y1020F proteins was decreased moderately, while phosphorylation of the Y917F/Y1020F double mutant was not detectable. These data suggested that these two tyrosines may represent key phosphorylation sites on SHIP during T cell receptor activation. However, we were unable to monitor co-precipitation of Shc in these experiments due to the insufficient expression levels of the transfected SHIP proteins (data not shown). To test the role of these two tyrosines in greater detail, we transiently expressed HA-tagged wt and mutant SHIP proteins along with GST-tagged Shc-PTB in COS cells. The tyrosine kinase Lck was again coexpressed to mediate phosphorylation of SHIP. The cells were lysed, and the Shc-PTB was precipitated using glutathione-Sepharose beads. The co-precipitating SHIP proteins were visualized by anti-HA immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 4 c, wt SHIP bound to Shc quite efficiently. However, SHIP proteins with a mutation of either Tyr-917 or Tyr-1020 showed a significant decrease in binding to Shc-PTB, while the Y917F/Y1020F double mutation nearly abrogated binding to Shc-PTB. In contrast, deletion of either the SH2 domain of SHIP (ΔSH2) or a point mutation within the SH2 domain of SHIP (R34Q, within the conserved FLVR sequence) had little effect on their interaction with Shc-PTB. Anti-HA immunoblotting of total lysates indicated that all of the mutant HA-SHIP proteins were expressed (Fig.4 c, bottom panel). Direct anti-Tyr(P) blotting of HA-SHIP precipitates indicated a diminished, yet detectable, phosphorylation of the Y917F/Y1020F double mutant. Although tyrosine phosphorylation of the Y917F/Y1020F double mutant was not detectable in transient expression in T cells (Fig. 4 b), phosphorylation of this protein was observed in COS cells (Fig. 4 d). This may be due to the apparently high activity of the Lck when expressed in COS cells, leading to phosphorylation on tyrosines other than Tyr-917 and Tyr-1020 on SHIP. Also, the apparently increased phosphorylation of the Y917F mutant (Fig. 4 d) can be explained by the higher expression of this protein in this experiment. All of the mutant proteins had 5′-inositol phosphatase activity, indicating the mutations did not induce gross structural changes of the protein (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that Tyr-917 and Tyr-1020 represent the two critical tyrosines within SHIP whose phosphorylation is required for the efficient interaction with Shc in vivo. The data presented in this report have several implications for signaling via Shc and SHIP. In the case of FcγRIIB, SHIP has been shown directly to bind to the receptor via its SH2 domain (44Ono M. Bolland S. Tempst P. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). However, we do not observe a direct binding of SHIP to either the TCR complex or the interleukin-2 receptor (data not shown). Under these conditions, the interaction of SHIP with proteins such as Shc may play a much greater role in its localization. At a biochemical level, the interaction between Shc and SHIP could occur via more than one mechanism, i.e. Shc-PTB binding to phosphorylated SHIP and/or the SHIP-SH2 binding to phosphorylated Shc. The data presented in this report demonstrate that in T cells and in COS cells, the Shc-PTB domain binding to phosphorylated SHIP (specifically Tyr-917 and Tyr-1020) is necessary and sufficient for this interaction. Our data also suggest that both sites (Tyr-917 and Tyr-1020) can contribute to Shc binding. Although Liu et al. (46Liu L. Damen J. Cutler R. Crystal G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6926-6935Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), based on peptide competition studies, have indicated a SHIP-SH2 interaction with phosphorylated Shc, we do not observe this interaction in vivo under the conditions we have tested. This suggested that the SH2 domains of both proteins are “free” to interact with other molecules. In the case of the TCR, Shc binds directly via its SH2 domain to the TCR-ζ chain (11Ravichandran K.S. Lee K.K. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Burn P. Burakoff S.J. Science. 1993; 262: 902-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar); in this case, Shc, via its PTB domain, may recruit SHIP to the proximity of the TCR. In our preliminary studies we have failed to observe a co-precipitation of SHIP with components of the TCR·CD3 complex, and the existence of such a trimeric complex during T cell activation remains to be determined. Since the SHIP-SH2 domain does not participate in binding to Shc, an interesting possibility is that the SHIP-SH2 may be free to bind other proteins, which may influence its function. In the case of the IL-2 receptor, Shc directly binds to the IL-2 receptor β chain via its PTB domain (35Ravichandran K.S. Igras V. Shoelson S.E. Fesik S.W. Burakoff S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5275-5280Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Structural studies of the PTB domain indicate the existence of only a single Tyr(P) binding pocket within the Shc-PTB (49Zhou M.M. Ravichandran K.S. Olejniczak E.T. Petros A.M. Meadows R.P. Sattler M. Harlan J.E. Wade W.S. Burakoff S.J. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1995; 378: 584-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Thus, the Shc·IL-2 receptor and Shc·SHIP complexes must exist separately and may perform independent roles. Since Shc interacts via its PTB domain with the βc chain (shared by IL-3, IL-5, and granulocyte-macrophage CSF receptors) (36Pratt J.C. Weiss M. Sieff C. Shoelson S. Burakoff S.J. Ravichandran K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12137-12140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), similar independent complexes may exist during signaling via these cytokines as well. Thus, depending on the type of receptor, recruitment of SHIP to active signaling complexes may occur by different mechanisms and, in turn, may have different functional consequences. We thank Drs. Ulrike Lorenz, Joanne Pratt, Steven Burakoff, Victor Engelhard, Lucia Rameh, and Lewis Cantley for helpful suggestions and Vivien Igras for technical help in early parts of this work."

To dissect the signaling pathway(s) linking FcεRI to MAPK and JNK, we reconstructed their respective biochemical routes by expression of a chimeric interleukin-2 receptor α subunit (Tac)-FcεRI γ chain (Tacγ) in COS-7 cells. Cross-linking of Tacγ did not affect MAPK in COS-7 cells, but when coexpressed with the tyrosine kinase Syk, Tacγ stimulation potently induced Syk and Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and MAPK activation. In contrast, Tacγ did not signal JNK activation, even when coexpressed with Syk. Ectopic expression of a hematopoietic-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), Vav, reconstituted the Tacγ-induced, Syk- and Rac1-dependent JNK activation; and tyrosine-phosphorylation of Vav by Syk stimulated its GEF activity for Rac1. Thus, these data strongly suggest that Vav plays a critical role linking FcεRI and Syk to the Rac1-JNK pathway. Furthermore, these findings define a novel signal transduction pathway involving a multimeric cell surface receptor acting on a cytosolic tyrosine kinase, which, in turn, phosphorylates a GEF, thereby regulating its activity toward a small GTP-binding protein and promoting the activation of a kinase cascade.

Activation of high affinity IgE Fc receptors (FcεRI) in basophils and mast cells induces the rapid release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators from secretory granules, and initiates a cascade of signal transduction events leading to enhanced production and secretion of various biologically active cytokines (1Scharenberg A.M.

One of the earliest events induced upon FcεRI aggregation is the activation of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinases Lyn and Syk, and the tyrosine phosphorylation of cytoplasmic molecules, including phospholipase C-γ (2Eisenman E.

Whereas these second-messenger generating systems appear to be sufficient for the FcεRI-mediated secretory response (4Jabril-Cuenod B. Zhang C. Scharenberg A.M. Paolini R. Numerof R.

Recently, it has been shown that stimulation of FcεRI in mast cell lines, such as RBL-2H3 cells, leads to the activation of members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; RBL, rat basophilic leukemia; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal calf serum; TNP, trinitrophenyl; DNP, dinitrophenyl; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor. superfamily of serine-threonine kinases. The function of these enzymes is to convert extracellular stimuli to intracellular signals which, in turn, participate in gene expression regulation. In particular, engagement of FcεRI receptors in mast cell lines has been shown to result in the activation of MAPK and JNK (5Hirasawa N. Andrew S. Yamamura H. Beaven M.A. Kinet J.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 22: 12762-12766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In this regard, recently available evidence suggests that engagement of FcεRI with antigen leads to the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and the association of Shc with Grb2, thus resulting in the recruitment of Sos and the stimulation of the Ras-MAPK pathway. Furthermore, Shc phosphorylation and MAPK activation was shown to be diminished upon overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of Syk, thus suggesting a central role for this kinase in the biochemical route communicating FcεRI to MAPK (5Hirasawa N. Andrew S. Yamamura H. Beaven M.A. Kinet J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10960-10967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In contrast, how FcεRI stimulation activates JNK is still unknown. In this study, we thought to dissect the signaling pathway(s) linking FcεRI to MAPK and JNK by reconstructing their respective biochemical routes upon ectopic expression of signaling molecules in COS-7 cells. Using this experimental approach, we provide evidence that whereas Syk and Shc connect FcεRI to the Ras-MAPK pathway, signaling from FcεRI to JNK involves the tyrosine phosphorylation by Syk of a hematopoietic specific guanine-nucleotide exchange factor, Vav, the exchange of GDP for GTP-bound to Rac1, and the consequent stimulation of a kinase cascade leading to JNK activation. RBL-2H3 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Before cross-linking of IgE, cells were incubated overnight in DMEM containing 0.1% FBS. Sensitization with anti-trinitrophenyl (TNP) IgE ascites fluid (1:5,000) at 37 °C for 2 h and cross-linking with 0.1 μg/ml dinitrophenyl-coupled to human serum albumin were described previously (7Benhamou M. Gutkind J.S. Robbins K.C. Siraganian R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5327-5330Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids (1 μg/plate) were transfected into subconfluent COS-7 cells by the DEAE-dextran technique (8Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar), adjusting the total amount of DNA to 5 μg/plate with vector DNA (pcDNA3, Invitrogen) when necessary. Forty-eight hours later, cells were cultured overnight in DMEM containing 0.1% FBS. Cells were then left unstimulated or stimulated with EGF (100 ng/ml). Stimulation with antibodies to Tac was performed using 5 μg/ml of biotinylated monoclonal antibody to Tac, B1.49.9 (Amac). After washing with phosphate-buffered saline twice, cells were stimulated in serum-free medium containing 12 μg/ml of avidin (Sigma). After incubation for the times indicated, cells were lysed. Cell lysis, immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, MAPK, and JNK assays were performed as described previously (8Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar). Antiserum to MAPK and to Syk were purchased from Santa Cruz. Antibodies to Shc and to phosphotyrosine (anti-Tyr(P)) were purchased from Transduction Laboratories and ICN Biochemicals, respectively. Syk was cloned from a cDNA library prepared from purified human monocyte poly(A)+ mRNA templates by using a fragment of the porcine Syk cDNA (a gift from H. Yamamura) as a probe. An in frame BamHI site was generated immediately upstream of the initiation codon of Syk using polymerase chain reaction techniques and subcloned into pcDNA3. pcDNA3 Myr-Syk was generated by subcloning the Syk cDNA into pcDNA3-Myr (8Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar). pcDNA3 Myr-Syk was transfected into COS-7 cells. After 48 h, cells were lysed in a hypotonic buffer, and proteins were isolated as cytosolic and membrane fractions, as described (9Fazioli F. Minichiello L. Matoskova B. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5814-5828Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Each fraction was immunoprecipitated with antibodies to Src (Santa Cruz) and immunoblotted with antiserum to Syk (Santa Cruz) and antibody to Tyr(P) (ICN). COS-7 cells were transfected using DEAE-dextran method, and cultured for 48 h, serum-starved in phosphate-free DMEM for 18 h, labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (100 μCi/ml) for 1 h for [32P]GDP accumulation and for 6 h for [32P]GDP and [32P]GTP determinations. Cells were disrupted in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, and 25 μg/ml aprotinin. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody to AU5 (Babco) for 1 h and immunocomplexes recovered using gamma-binding G-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Immunoprecipitates were washed twice in lysis buffer, twice in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mm MgCl2, 500 mm NaCl, and resuspended in 1 mKH2PO4, 5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0). Bound nucleotides were released by heating and fractionated using polyethyleneimine thin layer chromatography plates (J. T. Baker). To begin dissecting the signaling pathway(s) linking FcεRI to MAPK and JNK, we initially studied the temporal relationship between MAPK and JNK activation in RBL-2H3 cells. As expected, engagement of FcεRI by addition of dinitrophenyl (DNP) coupled to human serum albumin to anti-TNP IgE-primed RBL-2H3 cells potently activated MAPK and JNK; however, each followed a distinct temporal pattern (Fig.1, A and B). These data suggested that MAPK and JNK might be activated by different signaling pathways. For MAPK, FcεRI cross-linking is known to activate the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Syk, and it has been suggested recently that Syk phosphorylates the adapter protein Shc, thereby stimulating the Ras-MAPK pathway through Grb2 and Sos (10Jabril-Cuenod B. Zhang C. Scharenberg A.M. Paolini R. Robert N. Beaven M.A. Kinet J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16268-16272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Consistent with that, we observed that in RBL-2H3 cells FcεRI activation leads to the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk and the adapter protein Shc, following a time course similar to that of MAPK stimulation (Fig. 1, Cand D). FcεRI is a multimeric receptor containing a single α and β subunit and a homodimer of γ subunits (11Ravetch J.V. Kinet J.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 457-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). Both β and γ chains exhibit a structural motif termed ITAM, for immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (12Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar), which participate in the recruitment of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases and in the consequent tyrosine phosphorylation of their downstream targets (1Scharenberg A.M. Kinet J.P. Chem. Immunol. 1995; 61: 72-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies with chimeric molecules containing the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the interleukin-2 receptor α subunit (Tac) fused to the cytosolic domain of β (Tacβ) and γ (Tacγ) chains of FcεRI have helped simplify the analysis of early signaling events provoked by FcεRI activation (13Letourneur F. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8905-8909Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). When expressed in RBL-2H3 cells, cross-linking of the Tacγ chimera is sufficient to mimic the majority of the biochemical and biological responses triggered by FcεRI stimulation. In contrast, cross-linking of Tacβ does not appear to elicit signaling responses (13Letourneur F. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8905-8909Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Therefore, to investigate whether activation of Tacγ is sufficient to activate Syk, both were expressed in COS-7 cells, which lack endogenous FcεRI or Syk (see below). Transfected Tacγ was efficiently expressed, as judged by immunofluorescence labeling techniques (data not shown). Cross-linking of Tacγ chimeras with biotinylated anti-Tac antibodies followed by streptavidin induced the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of a coexpressed epitope-tagged Syk (Fig. 2 A). When coexpressed with an epitope-tagged form of Shc, cross-linking of Tacγ induced only a limited increase in Shc tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2 B). However, when Syk was coexpressed, Tacγ engagement provoked a rapid and substantial increase in Shc tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig.2 B). Paralleling Shc phosphorylation, cross-linking of Tacγ induced a very poor MAPK response, but when coexpressed with Syk, Tacγ potently elevated the phosphorylating activity of MAPK to an extent comparable with that elicited in response to EGF (Fig.2 C). Taken together, these results support a central role for the γ subunit of FcεRI and Syk in signaling from IgE receptors to the MAPK pathway. Surprisingly, however, cross-linking of Tacγ chimeras did not result in JNK activation, even when coexpressed with Syk. As a control, EGF effectively elevated JNK activity under identical experimental conditions (Fig. 2 C). Collectively, these data established that coexpression of Tacγ and Syk in COS-7 cells is sufficient to reconstitute the MAPK response to FcεRI stimulation, while suggesting that additional molecules not endogenously expressed in COS-7 cells were necessary to link FcεRI to JNK. Whereas Ras controls the activation of MAPK, we and others have recently observed that two members of the Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins, Rac1 and Cdc42, regulate JNK activity (8Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar). Although most molecules connecting Syk to Ras, including Shc, Grb2, and Sos, are ubiquitously expressed, guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Rho, Rac1, and Cdc42 exhibit a very restricted cell type and tissue distribution (14Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that COS-7 cells might lack an exchange factor acting downstream from Syk in the Rac/Cdc42-JNK pathway. In this regard, as recently shown by others (5Hirasawa N. Andrew S. Yamamura H. Beaven M.A. Kinet J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10960-10967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), FcεRI activation in RBL-2H3 cells induces the rapid and prolonged tyrosine phosphorylation of the Vav proto-oncogene product (Vav) (Fig.3 A), which is preferentially expressed in cells of the hematopoietic lineage. Moreover, Vav exhibits structural motifs frequently found in GEFs for small GTP-binding proteins of the Ras and Rho families (14Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and we have shown recently that truncated, oncogenically active forms of Vav (Onco-Vav), can potently activate JNK, but not MAPK, acting on a Rac-1-dependent signaling pathway (15Crespo P. Bustelo X.R. Aaronson D.S. Coso O.A. Lopez-Barahona M. Barbacid M. Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 455-466PubMed Google Scholar). These results prompted us to explore the possibility that wild-type Vav serves as a link between FcεRI and the Rac-1-JNK pathway. Expression of Vav alone (15Crespo P. Bustelo X.R. Aaronson D.S. Coso O.A. Lopez-Barahona M. Barbacid M. Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 455-466PubMed Google Scholar) or together with the Tacγ chimera failed to induce JNK activation (Fig. 3 B), and cross-linking of Tacγ failed to induce Vav tyrosine phosphorylation when coexpressed in COS-7 cells (Fig. 3 B). However, when Tacγ, Syk and Vav were each simultaneously coexpressed in these cells, Tacγ aggregation resulted in enhanced Vav tyrosine phosphorylation and a remarkable activation of JNK. These data together with results obtained in RBL-2H3 cells demonstrate the importance of Vav in signaling from FcεRI/Syk to JNK. We next asked whether recruitment of Syk to the plasma membrane upon aggregation of FcεRI or cross-linking of Tacγ chimeric molecules is the determining step initiating activity of Syk downstream signaling pathways. To that end, we examined the ability of a membrane-targeted form of Syk to bypass the requirement of Tacγ engagement for signaling to the MAPK and JNK pathway. A chimeric protein containing the NH2-terminal myristoylation signal of Src fused to Syk (Myr-Syk), localized to the plasma membrane when expressed in COS-7 cells, rather than exhibiting the typical cytosolic location of wild-type Syk (Ref. 16Taniguchi T. Kobayashi T. Kondo J. Takahashi K. Nakamura H. Suzuki J. Nagai K. Yamada T. Nakamura S. Yamamura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15790-15796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown). Furthermore, this membrane-targeted form of Syk was heavily tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig.3 C), and its expression was sufficient to elevate the activity of a cotransfected epitope-tagged MAPK (Fig. 3 D). However, Myr-Syk alone did not enhance JNK activity but, when cotransfected with Vav, it effectively induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav (not shown) and potently activated the JNK pathway, to an extent comparable with that provoked by expression of the fully active, transforming vav oncogene (Fig.3 D). These data indicate that once Syk is activated upon recruitment to the plasma membrane, no other FcεRI-associated kinases are required to signal to MAPK or to activate JNK in a Vav-dependent manner. We have reported recently that JNK activation by Onco-Vav can be blocked by expression of a dominant negative mutant of Rac-1, N17 Rac-1 (15Crespo P. Bustelo X.R. Aaronson D.S. Coso O.A. Lopez-Barahona M. Barbacid M. Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 455-466PubMed Google Scholar), thereby inferring that Onco-Vav acts as a GEF for Rac-1. In view of those results and our present data, we next asked whether expression of Vav proteins could promote guanine nucleotide exchange on Rac1in vivo. In this regard, the high intrinsic GTPase activity of Rho, Rac1, and Cdc42 has prevented the detection in living cells of their corresponding GTP-bound forms (17Laudanna C. Campbell J.J. Butcher E.C. Science. 1996; 271: 981-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Thus, for these experiments we took advantage of a recently described technique that uses the levels of 32P-labeled GDP bound to these small GTPases after a brief exposure to [32P]orthophosphate-containing medium as an approach to evaluate their nucleotide exchange in vivo. Initially, we expressed in COS-7 cells AU5-epitope-tagged Ha-Ras, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 (18Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Miyata H. Igishi T. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27225-27228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 19Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar), together with empty expression vector (control), a membrane-targeted form of the catalytic domain of Sos (Myr-Sos) (8Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar), or Onco-Vav (Fig. 4 A). All tagged small GTP-binding proteins were efficiently expressed, as judged by Western blotting with the anti-epitope antibody. Furthermore, when transfected cells were starved and then cultured for a short period of time in the presence of [32P]orthophosphate, each small GTPase incorporated labeled GDP, as determined by thin layer chromatography analysis of anti-AU5 immunoprecipitates. Under these experimental conditions, no labeled nucleotides were observed in mock-transfected cells (not shown), and Myr-Sos consistently enhanced 2–3-fold the level of radioactive GDP bound to Ras, without displaying any demonstrable effect on the other small GTP-binding proteins (Fig.4 A, left panel). As a control, we used the standard, more prolonged incubation with [32P]orthophosphate containing medium. Under those conditions, Myr-Sos induced a dramatic increase in GTP-bound Ras (Fig. 4 A, right panel). In contrast, under either incubation time expression of Onco-Vav did not affect Ras, but increased the level of labeled GDP bound to Rac1 more than 8-fold (Fig.4 A). Collectively, these results indicate that Onco-Vav can promote guanine nucleotide exchange in vivo on Rac1. Under identical experimental condition, neither wild-type Vav nor Myr-Syk induced nucleotide exchange on Rac1 (Fig. 4 B), which was consistent with the failure of each one alone to induce JNK activity (see above). However, when Myr-Syk was coexpressed with Vav, we observed a dramatic increase in the incorporation of labeled GDP into Rac1. These two observations, 1) potent JNK activation provoked by coexpression of Myr-Syk together with Vav or upon cross-linking of Tacγ when coexpressed with Syk and Vav and 2) Syk's ability to effectively tyrosine-phosphorylate Vav in vivo, strongly suggest that Syk-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav increases its GEF toward Rac1, leading to JNK activation. Consistent with this conclusion, JNK stimulation induced by Tacγ cross-linking in Tacγ-, Syk-, and Vav-transfected COS-7 cells was blocked by the dominant negative mutant of Rac1, N17 rac1 (Fig. 4 C). Moreover, we have recently observed that tyrosine phosphorylation of purified Vav protein dramatically enhances its GEF activity on bacterially expressed Rac1 when analyzed in in vitro assays (19Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar), further supporting the emerging notion that Vav behaves as a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent GEF for Rac1. A number of GEFs for small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family have been identified by virtue of their transforming potential in murine fibroblasts (20Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the normal function of these GEFs, as well as the molecular mechanisms controlling their enzymatic activity in their natural setting, is still unknown. In this regard, our findings provide solid evidence that whereas Onco-Vav is constitutively active, wild-type Vav only promotes guanine nucleotide exchange in Rac1 upon activation of an upstream tyrosine kinase, Syk, and that Vav function(s) in this setting are controlled by tyrosine phosphorylation. Thus, these findings define a novel signal transduction pathway involving a cell surface receptor activating a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, which, in turn, phosphorylates a GEF in tyrosine residues, thereby regulating its activity toward a small GTP-binding protein and promoting the activation of a kinase cascade. A schematic representation of such a likely biochemical route, including, sequentially, FcεRI, Syk, Vav, Rac1, and its downstream target, JNK, as well as the pathway connecting Syk to MAPK is depicted in Fig.5. Our present findings might also have important implications regarding the functioning of other multimeric antigen receptors. As discussed above, in mast cells accumulating evidence demonstrates that the γ subunit of FcεRI signals Syk activation. The FcεRI γ chain is functionally analogous to the ζ chain of the antigen T cell receptor, and whereas FcεRIγ subunits recruit Syk, the T cell receptor ζ subunits interact with Zap70 (21Chan A.C. Iwashima M. Turck C.W. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 71: 649-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar, 22Iwashima M. Irving B.A. van Oers N.S. Chan A.C. Weiss A. Science. 1994; 263: 1136-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Furthermore, T cell receptor and B cell receptor activation both lead to Vav tyrosine phosphorylation (23Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Nature. 1992; 356: 68-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 24Margolis B. Nature. 1992; 356: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) and JNK activation (25Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Based upon our results, it is predictable that Vav plays a common role in basophils, mast cells, T cells, and B cells, linking multimeric antigen receptors and their associated downstream nonreceptor tyrosine kinases to the Rac1-JNK signaling pathway.

Science. 1991; 254: 1146-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). Binding of these growth factors to specific cell surface receptors induces receptor dimerization and activation of their intrinsic tyrosine kinase activities. This leads to receptor autophosphorylation and tyrosine phosphorylation of numerous other cellular proteins which then initiate activation of diverse transduction cascades culminating in DNA synthesis and cell division (2Williams L.T. Science. 1989; 243: 1564-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 3Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32023-32026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A general paradigm for the activation and signaling of receptor tyrosine kinases involves the recruitment of cytoplasmic molecules that contain Src homology (SH2) domains (4Rozakis-Adcock M.

Some of these targets have been identified and include phospholipase Cγ, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), GTPase-activating protein of Ras, Src family kinases, and several adaptor proteins (i.e. Shc, Grb2, and Nck) (3Claesson-Welsh L.

However, the precise involvement of these signaling pathways remains unresolved due, in part, to the redundancy in the mitogenic signaling pathways induced by these growth factors (3Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32023-32026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,6Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, cellular responses to each growth factor are distinct. However, the unique signaling mechanisms that impart growth factor specificity at post-receptor levels are still largely unknown. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) are key mediators of signal transduction from the activated receptor to the nucleus. Growth factors stimulate the activation of a protein kinase cascade which sequentially involves Ras, Raf, MAP kinase kinase (MEK), and MAPK (7Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). Although functionally significant differences in mitogenic signaling exist for different growth factor receptors, surprisingly few differences have been documented in the pathways utilized for Ras/MEK/MAPK activation. The major pathway mediated by adaptor proteins (Shc/Grb2), Sos and Ras, links the PDGF and EGF receptors to the MAPK cascade and to the activation of several transcription factors (8Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 273-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). For both growth factors, the activated receptors ultimately target the same effectors for MAPK activation. Recently, PDGF but not EGF was shown to stimulate sphingosine kinase activity in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (9Olivera A. Spiegel S. Nature. 1993; 365: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar) and to increase intracellular concentrations of SPP, a sphingolipid metabolite that stimulates proliferation of many cell types (10Zhang H. Desai N.N. Olivera A. Seki T. Brooker G. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 11Gomez-Muñoz A. Martin A. O'Brien L. Brindley D.N. J. Biol.

Steele L. Pyne N.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Much evidence suggests that SPP is a member of a new class of lipid second messengers derived from metabolism of sphingolipids (reviewed in Ref. 12Spiegel S. Milstien S. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 146: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). PDGF also induced a transient increase in cellular levels of SPP in arterial smooth muscle cells (14Bornfeldt K.E. Graves L.M. Raines E.W. Igarashi Y. Wayman G. Yamamura S. Yatomi Y. Sidhu J.S. Krebs E.G. Hakomori S. Ross R. J.

Biochem. 1996; 237: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and also increased levels of sphingosine, the precursor of SPP, in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (9Olivera A. Spiegel S. Nature. 1993; 365: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar), vascular smooth muscle cells (15Jacobs L.S. Kester M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C740-C747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in glomerular mesangial cells (16Coroneos E. Martinez M. McKenna S. Kester M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23305-23309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). SPP is important for T cell proliferation since cell growth inhibition induced by ISP-1/myriocin, a new type of potent immunosuppressant with structural similarity to sphingosine which inhibits sphingolipid metabolism, was completely abolished by SPP or sphingosine (17Miyake Y. Kozutsumi Y. Nakamura S. Fujita T. Kawasaki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 396-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Moreover, inhibitors of sphingolipid metabolite production specifically and selectively reduce PDGF-induced cellular proliferation (9Olivera A. Spiegel S. Nature. 1993; 365: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 16Coroneos E. Martinez M. McKenna S. Kester M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23305-23309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Although there is increasing evidence that SPP functions as an intracellular second messenger (12Spiegel S. Milstien S. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 146: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 18Spiegel S. J. Lipid Mediators. 1993; 8: 169-175PubMed Google Scholar), little is known of the pathway through which it exerts its effects on DNA synthesis and cell growth. The formation of SPP is catalyzed by sphingosine kinase (19Stoffel W. Heimann G. Hellenbroich B. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1973; 354: 562-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 20Buehrer B.M. Bell R.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1973; 354: 1311-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (22Olivera A. Zhang H. Carlson R.O. Mattie M.E. Schmidt R.R. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17924-17930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is a useful tool for studying the involvement of this enzyme. DHS completely eliminated SPP production in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts induced by PDGF and concomitantly inhibited PDGF-stimulated DNA synthesis (9Olivera A. Spiegel S. Nature. 1993; 365: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). In contrast, this inhibitor did not abrogate cellular proliferation induced by EGF (9Olivera A. Spiegel S. Nature. 1993; 365: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined further the involvement and specificity of SPP in intracellular signaling pathways of PDGF and EGF. We found that DHS blocks a previously uncharacterized signal transduction pathway from PDGF receptors to MAPK. PDGF-BB was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). EGF, insulin, and transferrin were from Collaborative Research (Lexington, MA). Calf serum was from Colorado Serum Co. (Denver, CO). SPP and sphingosine were obtained from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). DHS was from Sigma. Anti-Cdk2 kinase was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-Cdc2 kinase, and anti-Crk antibodies were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Poly(dI-dC) was obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. T4 polynucleotide kinase was from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Oligonucleotides containing the consensus sequence of AP-1, SP-1, and NF1/CTF were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts from the American Type Culture Collection (CCL 92) were cultured as described previously (24Spiegel S. Panagiotopoulos C. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 177: 414-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were subcultured at a density of 1.5 × 104 cells/cm2 in 20 × 100-mm dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biofluids, Inc.) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% calf serum, and used 5–7 days later when the cells were confluent and quiescent. Eighteen hours prior to treatment, the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing transferrin (5 μg/ml) and BSA (20 μg/ml). DHS solubilized in ethanol was added directly to each dish (<0.05% final concentration of ethanol), and SPP was added as a complex with 0.4% BSA. Cells were lysed in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride/50 mm NaF, 80 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, leupeptin, and aprotinin (2.5 μg/ml each). After centrifugation at 14,500 ×g, 250-μg aliquots of supernatant proteins were incubated with 2.5 μg of anti-Cdk2 kinase or anti-Cdc2 kinase antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by the addition of 50 μl of 1:5 slurry of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (25Rani C.S.S. Abe A. Chang Y. Rosenzweig N. Saltiel A.R. Radin N.S. Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2859-2867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). After 1 h at 4 °C, the bound immune complexes were recovered by centrifugation, washed twice with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100 and twice with kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol), and incubated with 30 μl of kinase reaction mixture (40 μg of histone H1, 25 μm ATP (2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) and 10 mmMgCl2 in kinase buffer) for 15 min at room temperature. An aliquot (15 μl) was spotted on phosphocellulose disks, washed in 1% phosphoric acid, twice with water, and the radioactivity on disks measured by liquid scintillation. In some experiments, another aliquot of the reaction mix was boiled with 2 × Laemmli sample buffer and resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, dried, and the phosphorylated histone bands visualized by autoradiography and quantified by densitometry. Lysates were prepared as described for the kinase activity assay and mixed with 1 × Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and 50 μg of protein resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (MSI, Inc., Westboro, MA) and probed with antibodies against Cdc2 kinase. Immunocomplexes were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Corp.). DNA synthesis was measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation as described previously (24Spiegel S. Panagiotopoulos C. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 177: 414-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Serum-starved Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were washed two times and incubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate/HEPES for 1.5 h before use. p42mapk activity was determined by an immune complex kinase assay using p42mapk-specific antibody TR12 and myelin basic protein as substrate as described previously (26Wu J. Spiegel S. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11484-11488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). PI3K activity was determined in total cell lysates directly or following immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (27Susa M. Keeler M. Varticovski L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22951-22956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from quiescent Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (28Dignam J.D. Martin P.L. Shastry B.S. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 582-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed as described previously (29Su Y. Rosenthal D. Smulson M. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16512-16517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosine receptor phosphorylation was analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (25Rani C.S.S. Abe A. Chang Y. Rosenzweig N. Saltiel A.R. Radin N.S. Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2859-2867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Briefly, serum-starved confluent and quiescent Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were treated with PDGF or EGF. Where indicated, DHS was added 5 min prior to the addition of the growth factors and was present during the entire treatment. Cells were then washed and lysed with a buffer consisting of 1% Triton X-100 in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, and a mixture of phosphatase and protease inhibitors (10 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 4 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin). Lysed cells were harvested by scraping and centrifuging at 14,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The lysates were boiled in 1 × Laemmli sample buffer and equal amounts of protein separated by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% gels. Following electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose membrane (MSI, Inc.) using a Bio-Rad transblot apparatus, the phosphotyrosine containing proteins were detected by Western blotting using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (RC20H, Transduction Laboratories) and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents. After treatment with SPP and/or EGF and PDGF, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and cell lysates prepared as described above for receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. Aliquots of about 250 μg of protein were immunoprecipitated with 3 μg of anti-Crk or anti-Shc antibodies, and the immune complexes were washed (30Beitner-Johnson D. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5187-5190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), boiled with Laemmli sample buffer, and resolved on 9% polyacrylamide SDS gels. After transferring to nitrocellulose membranes, the Crk and Shc blots were probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (RC20H). In some experiments, Shc immunoprecipitates were also probed with anti-Grb2 antibody. dl -threo-Dihydrosphingosine Selectively Inhibits PDGF-stimulated Cdk2 Kinase and p34cdc2 Kinase Activities—To elucidate the biochemical basis for the differential effect of DHS on PDGF- and EGF-induced DNA synthesis, we studied the effect of DHS on PDGF and EGF stimulation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK). Progression of eukaryotic cells through the cell cycle is governed by sequential formation and activation of a series of cyclin and CDK complexes. The activation of p34cdc2 kinase (Cdc2) is critical for progression of cells into mitosis (31Moreno S. Nurse P. Cell. 1990; 61: 549-551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), whereas activation of Cdk2, which shares ∼60% homology with Cdc2 kinase and associates with cyclins A and E, is maximal at G1/S transition (32Elledge S.J. Richman R. Hall F.L. Williams R.T. Lodgson N. Harper J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2907-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). After 19 h treatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with PDGF, the activity of Cdk2 and Cdc2 kinases increased 4- and 3-fold, respectively (Fig. 1,A and B). EGF had much smaller effects on these kinases, consistent with its small effect on DNA synthesis in these cells (9Olivera A. Spiegel S. Nature. 1993; 365: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). DHS inhibited PDGF- but not EGF-induced increases in these CDK activities (Fig. 1 , A andB). In agreement with its potent mitogenic effect, SPP also increased the CDK activities (Fig. 1 , A and B). We also examined the effects of PDGF and EGF on the levels of Cdc2 kinase protein by immunoblotting assays (Fig. 1 C). PDGF treatment increased the Cdc2 kinase level by 3.5-fold, whereas DHS markedly inhibited this PDGF effect. In agreement with its effect on CDK kinase activity, EGF treatment caused a smaller increase in Cdc2 kinase levels (1.5-fold) which was not altered by DHS. SPP also induced a 2-fold increase in Cdc2 kinase protein (Fig. 1 C). To establish more rigorously that the DHS effects were mediated via inhibition of sphingosine kinase, we determined whether the inhibitory effects of DHS could be bypassed by addition of exogenous SPP. Inhibition of PDGF-stimulated Cdk2 and Cdc2 kinase activities (Fig.1 , A and B), and inhibition of PDGF-stimulated DNA synthesis (Fig. 1 D) by DHS, can be overcome by co-treatment with SPP. Moreover, as expected, DHS had no effect on the responses to SPP (Fig. 1). dl -threo-Dihydrosphingosine Inhibits PDGF-stimulated but Not EGF-stimulated MAPK Activation—We have shown recently that SPP activates the Raf/MEK/MAPK signaling pathway (26Wu J. Spiegel S. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11484-11488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). To investigate whether activation of sphingosine kinase and concomitant formation of SPP might play a role in PDGF-activated signaling pathways leading to MAPK activation, we examined the effect of DHS on PDGF-stimulated MAPK activity. PDGF markedly stimulated MAPK activity (∼15-fold), showing a maximal effect within 5 min. EGF and SPP also markedly increased MAPK activity (Fig. 2). DHS reduced PDGF-stimulated MAPK activity but had no effect on EGF-stimulated or SPP-stimulated MAPK activation (Fig. 2), indicating the specificity of the inhibitory effect. AP-1, which is composed of dimeric complexes of members of the Fos and Jun subfamilies, is one of the transcription factors known to be activated by the MAPK signaling pathway (33Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous results (29Su Y. Rosenthal D. Smulson M. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16512-16517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3279) Google Scholar), treatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with PDGF, EGF, the phorbol ester TPA, or SPP for 3 h resulted in increased AP-1 DNA binding activity (Fig. 3, A andB). The DNA-protein complex was abolished by addition of 10-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor AP-1 probe but was not affected by 10-fold molar excesses of oligonucleotides containing consensus sequences for SP-1, AP-2, AP-3, NF1/CTF, or mutant AP-1, indicating that the binding is highly specific for the AP-1 sequence (data not shown). DHS not only reduced DNA synthesis induced by PDGF, it also markedly reduced the stimulation of DNA binding activity of AP-1 induced by PDGF (Fig. 3). In sharp contrast, DHS had no effect on DNA binding activity of AP-1 induced by EGF in the presence of insulin, TPA, or SPP (Fig. 3). EGF in the absence of insulin also stimulated DNA binding activity of AP-1 but to a lesser extent than in the presence of insulin, and DHS also had no effect on this response (data not shown). Collectively, these results suggest that part of the growth-associated responses to PDGF are mediated via sphingosine kinase-dependent formation of SPP and are consistent with previous studies on SPP stimulation of DNA binding activity of AP-1 (29Su Y. Rosenthal D. Smulson M. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16512-16517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To define the intracellular targets through which SPP modulates PDGF signaling, we examined the cascade of early signaling events following PDGF binding to its receptors. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGF and EGF receptors was examined by Western blotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. After 5 min treatment with PDGF and EGF, autophosphorylation of the corresponding receptors could readily be detected along with other major tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Pretreatment of cells for 10 min with DHS prior to the addition of the growth factors did not decrease tyrosine phosphorylation of the respective receptors (Fig.4). In addition, SPP itself did not enhance tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGF receptor (data not shown). In agreement with previous studies (35Auger K.R. Serunian L.A. Soltoff S.P. Libby P. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1989; 57: 167-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 36Kazlauskas A. Kashishian A. Cooper J. Valius M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2534-2544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), PDGF markedly stimulated phosphotyrosine-associated PI3K activity in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. In contrast, SPP and sphingosylphosphorylcholine, another potent sphingolipid mitogen, had almost no effects (Fig. 5). Similarly, treatment of cells with mitogenic concentrations of SPP for 1, 3, and 5 min increased levels of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate in whole cell extracts by 1.08 ± 0.2-, 1.9 ± 0.4-, and 1.4 ± 0.3-fold, respectively. Preincubation of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts for 10 min with DHS prior to stimulation with PDGF did not inhibit the PDGF-stimulated increase in phosphotyrosine-associated PI3K activity (Fig. 5), indicating that SPP is not involved in PDGF-induced stimulation of PI3K activity. Both EGF and PDGF induce phosphorylation of Shc proteins (8Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 273-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Although the PDGF and EGF receptors can bind the small adaptor signaling molecule Grb2 directly, Grb2 can also associate with tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc via its SH2 domain (8Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 273-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) and to the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos via its SH3 domain. These complexes are involved in Ras activation by growth factors (8Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 273-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Because activation of Ras is a key step coupling growth factor receptors to MAPK signaling and nuclear events leading to mitogenesis (3Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32023-32026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the involvement of sphingosine kinase in PDGF-induced phosphorylation of Shc and its association with Grb2. PDGF dramatically stimulated the phosphorylation of 46- and 52-kDa Shc proteins in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. However, prior treatment with DHS had no effect on this PDGF-induced phosphorylation (Fig.6). DHS also had no effect on PDGF-induced Grb2 association with Shc, as shown by its co-immunoprecipitation with Shc (Fig. 6). EGF also stimulated Shc tyrosine phosphorylation, similarly to the effect of PDGF, and DHS had no effect on this phosphorylation (data not shown). Moreover, SPP did not stimulate Shc phosphorylation, nor did it increase its association with Grb2 (data not shown). The Crk family, cellular homologs of v-crk, includes Crk II (40 kDa), Crk I (21 kDa), and Crkl (36 kDa) (37Reichman C.T. Mayer B.J. Keshau S. Hanafusa H. Cell Growth & Differ. 1992; 3: 451-460PubMed Google Scholar) which are SH2/SH3 adaptor proteins, related to Grb2 and Nck. Based on the growth factor-independent transforming activity of v-Crk in chicken embryo fibroblasts (38Mayer B. Hamaguchi M. Hanafusa H. Nature. 1988; 90: 5016-5020Google Scholar), its composition of SH2 and SH3 domains, and binding of c-Crk to Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors, mSos (39Gout I. Dhand R. Hiles I.D. Fry M.J.

https://openalex.org/W1963598854,"Annexin V belongs to a family of proteins that interact with phospholipids in a Ca2+-dependent manner. This protein has been demonstrated to have anti-phospholipase A2 activity. However, this effect has never yet been reported with the 85-kDa cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2). We studied, in a model of differentiated and streptolysin O-permeabilized HL-60 cells, the effect of annexin V on cPLA2 activity after stimulation by calcium, GTPγS (guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)), formyl-Met-Leu-Phe, or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Both recombinant and human placental purified annexin V inhibit cPLA2 activity whatever the stimulus used. The decrease of arachidonic acid release is of 40 and 50%, respectively, at [Ca2+] of 3 and 10 μm. The mechanism of inhibition was also analyzed. cPLA2 requires calcium and protein kinase C (PKC) or mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation for its activation. As annexin V was shown to be an endogenous inhibitor of PKC, PKC-stimulated cPLA2 activity was analyzed. Using GF109203x, a specific PKC inhibitor, we demonstrated that this pathway is of minor importance in our model. cPLA2 inhibition by annexin V is not linked to PKC inhibition. To test the hypothesis of phospholipid depletion, mutants of annexin V were constructed using mutagenesis directed to Ca2+ site. We demonstrate that the Ca2+ site located in domain I is necessary for the inhibitory effect of annexin V on cPLA2 activity. The site in domain IV is also involved but with less efficiency. In contrast, mutations in site II and III do not modify this effect. Moreover, annexin V mutated on all sites does not inhibit cPLA2. Thus, we propose a predominant role of module (I/IV) in the biological action of annexin V, which, in physiological conditions, may control cPLA2 activity by depletion of the phospholipid substrate. Annexin V belongs to a family of proteins that interact with phospholipids in a Ca2+-dependent manner. This protein has been demonstrated to have anti-phospholipase A2 activity. However, this effect has never yet been reported with the 85-kDa cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2). We studied, in a model of differentiated and streptolysin O-permeabilized HL-60 cells, the effect of annexin V on cPLA2 activity after stimulation by calcium, GTPγS (guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)), formyl-Met-Leu-Phe, or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Both recombinant and human placental purified annexin V inhibit cPLA2 activity whatever the stimulus used. The decrease of arachidonic acid release is of 40 and 50%, respectively, at [Ca2+] of 3 and 10 μm. The mechanism of inhibition was also analyzed. cPLA2 requires calcium and protein kinase C (PKC) or mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation for its activation. As annexin V was shown to be an endogenous inhibitor of PKC, PKC-stimulated cPLA2 activity was analyzed. Using GF109203x, a specific PKC inhibitor, we demonstrated that this pathway is of minor importance in our model. cPLA2 inhibition by annexin V is not linked to PKC inhibition. To test the hypothesis of phospholipid depletion, mutants of annexin V were constructed using mutagenesis directed to Ca2+ site. We demonstrate that the Ca2+ site located in domain I is necessary for the inhibitory effect of annexin V on cPLA2 activity. The site in domain IV is also involved but with less efficiency. In contrast, mutations in site II and III do not modify this effect. Moreover, annexin V mutated on all sites does not inhibit cPLA2. Thus, we propose a predominant role of module (I/IV) in the biological action of annexin V, which, in physiological conditions, may control cPLA2 activity by depletion of the phospholipid substrate. Annexins constitute a family of at least 13 structurally related cytoplasmic proteins in mammals, which bind to anionic phospholipids in a Ca2+-dependent manner. These proteins are widely distributed in eukaryotic cells and form a class of Ca2+-binding proteins distinct from the “EF-hand” family and from other Ca2+-binding proteins containing the calcium and lipid binding domain such as conventional protein kinase C (cPKC) 1The abbreviations used are: cPKC, conventional protein kinase C; PLA2, phospholipase A2; cPLA2, group IV cytosolic phospholipase A2; sPLA2, secretory phospholipase A2; iPLA2, calcium-independent phospholipase A2; PLD, phospholipase D; PLC, phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C; AA, arachidonic acid; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; PKC, protein kinase C; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; SLO, streptolysin O; fMLP,N-formyl-methionyl-l-leucyl-l-phenylalanine; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); [Ca2+]i, intracellular concentration of calcium; [Ca2+]o, extracellular concentration of calcium; DTT, dithiothreitol; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; AACOCF3, arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone; MAFP, methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate; BEL, bromoenol lactone. 1The abbreviations used are: cPKC, conventional protein kinase C; PLA2, phospholipase A2; cPLA2, group IV cytosolic phospholipase A2; sPLA2, secretory phospholipase A2; iPLA2, calcium-independent phospholipase A2; PLD, phospholipase D; PLC, phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C; AA, arachidonic acid; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; PKC, protein kinase C; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; SLO, streptolysin O; fMLP,N-formyl-methionyl-l-leucyl-l-phenylalanine; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); [Ca2+]i, intracellular concentration of calcium; [Ca2+]o, extracellular concentration of calcium; DTT, dithiothreitol; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; AACOCF3, arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone; MAFP, methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate; BEL, bromoenol lactone. and cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) (1Russo-Marie F.

Acta. 1994; 1197: 63-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). Each annexin consists of two different regions: (i) the N-terminal domain, diverse in sequence and length between the members of the family, which is likely to confer specific biological functions for each of them; and (ii) the C-terminal domain, named “core,” and composed of four repeats (eight for annexin VI) of highly conserved 70–80 amino acid sequence. The Ca2+-dependent membrane association of annexins relies in specific Ca2+-binding sites present in this common conserved core region (3Geisow M.J. Fritsche U. Hexham J.M. Dash B. Johnson T. Nature. 1986; 320: 636-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Although annexins have been implicated in many aspects of cell biology, their exact physiological functions are not yet known. However, it seems likely that their cellular and subcellular locations are related to their biological functions (2Raynal P. Pollard H.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 63-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). Annexin V is the most abundant of these proteins. Its cDNA encodes an unglycosylated protein of 320 residues with a molecular mass of 35,935 Da (4Funakoshi T. Hendrickson L.E. McMullen B.A. Fujikawa K. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8087-8092Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Crystal structure of annexin V has been solved and serves as a structural prototype for the annexin family (5Huber R.

Seaton B.A. Science. 1993; 261: 1321-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of annexin V has a slightly curved shape with four type II, high affinity Ca2+-binding sites located on the convex face, facing the membrane. Both N and C termini are on the opposite face (7Concha N.O. Head J.F. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. Seaton B.A. Science. 1993; 261: 1321-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 8Burger A. Vosges D. Demange P Perez C.R. Huber R. Berendes R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 479-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Moreover, the four repeats form four domains (I–IV), which are packed pairwise into two modules, (I/IV) and (II/III) (7Concha N.O. Head J.F. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. Seaton B.A. Science. 1993; 261: 1321-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 8Burger A. Vosges D. Demange P Perez C.R. Huber R. Berendes R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 479-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). So far, several physiological functions of annexin V have been reported. This protein has been implicated in the control of blood coagulation (4Funakoshi T. Hendrickson L.E. McMullen B.A. Fujikawa K. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8087-8092Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It was shown to form voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (9Liemann S. Benz J. Burger A. Vosges D. Hofmann A. Huber R. Göttig P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and to be a high affinity inhibitor of protein kinase C (10Schlaepfer D.D. Jones J. Haigler H.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1886-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 11Dubois T. Oudinet J.-P. Russo-Marie F. Rothhut B. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Moreover, it can regulate inflammation by inhibiting phospholipase A2activity (12Davidson F.F. Dennis E.A. Powell M. Glenney Jr., J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1698-1705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Comera C. Rothhut B. Russo-Marie F. Eur. J.

However, neither the mechanism of PLA2inhibition by annexin V is fully understood, nor the isoform of PLA2 involved in this effect defined. Phospholipase A2 enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of thesn-2 fatty acyl chain of many different phospholipids to generate free fatty acids and lysophospholipids. Moreover, PLA2-catalyzed release of arachidonic acid (AA) is believed to be the rate-limiting event in the generation of proinflammatory mediators. PLA2 enzymes can be separated into two main classes (16Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13057-13060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (i) The extracellular forms or 14-kDa secretory PLA2s (sPLA2s) that have been extensively characterized and structurally defined (17Davidson F.F. Dennis E.A. J. Mol. Evol. 1990; 31: 228-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Major features of sPLA2s include their requirement of millimolar [Ca2+] and their sensitivity to reducing agents. The crystal structure of the Ca2+-binding loop of extracellular PLA2 is similar to that found in annexin V (5Huber R. Römisch J. Pâques E.P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3867-3974Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). In vitro studies, performed at [Ca2+]o,i.e. in the millimolar range, have indicated that annexins sequester the phospholipid substrate of sPLA2s thus preventing the enzyme access to its substrate (12Davidson F.F. Dennis E.A. Powell M. Glenney Jr., J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1698-1705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Aarsman A.S. Mynbeck G. van der Bosch H. Rothhut B. Prieur B. Comera C. Jordan L. Russo-Marie F. FEBS Lett. 1987; 219: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). (ii) The intracellular class of PLA2 is composed of a Ca2+-independent PLA2 (iPLA2) involved essentially in regulating the incorporation of AA into membrane phospholipids (19Balsinde J. Barbour S.E. Bianco I.D. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11060-11064Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 20Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), and of the group IV cytosolic 85-kDa Ca2+-dependent PLA2(cPLA2) responsible of intracellular AA release (16Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13057-13060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar,21Clark J.D. Schievella A.R. Nalefski E.A. Lin L.-L. J. Lipid Med. Cell Signal. 1995; 12: 83-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). cPLA2 is activated by both micromolar [Ca2+]i and Ser-505 phosphorylation by MAP kinases or PKC (21Clark J.D. Schievella A.R. Nalefski E.A. Lin L.-L. J. Lipid Med. Cell Signal. 1995; 12: 83-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Recently, an effect of annexin I on cPLA2 activity was reported: annexin I would inhibit cPLA2 activity by specific interaction between both proteins (15Kim K.M. Kim D.K. Park Y.M. Kim C.K. Na D.S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This mechanism was also suggested by another group using an annexin I-derived peptide (22Croxtall J.D. Newman S.P. Choudhury Q. Flower R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1996; 220: 491-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Relationships between cPLA2 and the other members of annexin family have never been under investigation. As annexin V and cPLA2 are both ubiquitous and activated by similar [Ca2+]i and as annexin V inhibits cPKCs, which could phosphorylate and activate cPLA2, we studied the effect of annexin V on AA release due to cPLA2activation in differentiated and permeabilized HL 60 cells and found that, in physiological conditions, annexin V was inhibitory for cPLA2 activity. The mechanism of such inhibition was further investigated using Ca2+-binding site-directed mutagenesis of annexin V and specific enzyme inhibitors. HL-60 cells were given by Dr. T. Breitman, NCI, Bethesda, MD. RPMI 1640, glutamine, antibiotics, and HEPES buffer were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.; fetal bovine serum was from Dutcher. Streptolysin O was obtained from Murex (UK). GTPγS and fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF3) was obtained from Calbiochem. Methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate (MAFP) and bromoenol lactone (BEL) were from Cayman Chemical Co. [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H]Arachidonic acid (100 mCi/mmol) was purchased from DuPont NEN. GF109203x was from Tocris Cookson (Glaxo, Les Ulis, France). Scintillant liquid, OptiPhase HiSafe 3, was obtained from EG&G Wallack (Evry, France). Chromatography supports and Q-Sepharose column for fast pressure liquid chromatography were purchased from Pharmacia-LKB (Orsay, France). Oligonucleotides for mutagenesis were obtained from Genset (Paris, France). All other reagents were from Sigma. Annexin V C-terminal peptide (the last 16 residues of annexin V: SGDYKKALLLLCGEDD) was synthetized by Chiron Mimotopes Peptides System (Lyon, France). HL-60 cells were cultured and differentiated into a neutrophil-like phenotype, as described previously (23Xing M. Thevenod F. Mattera R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6602-6610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were routinely grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 25 mm HEPES, 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine 2 mm, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (pH 7.4) under a 95% air and 5% CO2atmosphere. Before differentiation, cells were adjusted to approximately 0.5 × 106 cells/ml and grown for 24 h in the same medium to a density of about 0.8 × 106 cells/ml. Differentiation into a neutrophil-like phenotype was then induced by culturing the cells for 72 h in the presence of 0.5 mm dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Differentiated HL-60 cells were counted and viability was monitored by trypan blue exclusion. It was always over 95%. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 5 min at 1200 rpm at room temperature and washed three times in buffer A, made of 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5.6 mm glucose, pH 7.2. Cells were then resuspended at a concentration of 2 × 107 cells/ml in buffer A and labeled at 37 °C for 1 h with 1 μCi/ml [3H]arachidonic acid. Under these conditions, more than 70% of total radioactive molecules were incorporated into cellular phospholipids. At the end of labeling, cells were washed three times and resuspended at a concentration of 2 × 107cells/ml in buffer B containing 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 20 mm PIPES, and 0.2% protease and fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, pH 6.8. Typical value range for incorporated labeled arachidonate was 0.8–1 × 106dpm/assay tube (106 cells). Labeled cells were equilibrated for 10 min at 37 °C. Cytochalasin B (2 μg/ml final) was added to the cells 2 min before transferring cells to assay tube. Assays were started by adding 50 μl of the packed labeled cell suspension (2 × 107cells/ml) to the same volume of medium (prewarmed at 37 °C) containing permeabilizing agent SLO and stimuli when indicated as described by Stuchfield and Cockcroft (24Stutchfield J. Cockcroft S. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated at 37 °C with SLO (0.4 IU/ml), in the presence of 2 mm Mg-ATP, 2 mm MgCl2, and Ca2+ at various concentrations, in the presence or absence of various stimuli such as GTPγS or DTT. Incubations were carried out at 37 °C for 10 min, under constant shaking. Preliminary experiments studying different incubation times (0–20 min) indicated that maximal arachidonate release occurred at 10 min, confirming previous studies (23Xing M. Thevenod F. Mattera R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6602-6610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped by 5-fold dilution with ice-cold 50 mm Tris/HCl, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA and 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5. After centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min at 1000 × g, aliquots of the supernatants (300 μl) were taken and associated radioactivity was quantified in a Beckman scintillation counter. Arachidonic acid released at the end of cellular reaction was measured by the amount of tritiated AA present in the supernatant and expressed as a percentage of total incorporated cellular radioactivity. In experiments where PKC was stimulated by phorbol ester, 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was added during the 10 min preincubation period. Formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) stimulation was started two minutes before permeabilization of cells. Cell treatment with the different inhibitors (AACOCF3, MAFP, BEL, or GF109203x) was achieved by a 30-min preincubation at 37 °C of labeled intact cells. Calcium buffers were prepared as described by Tatham and Gomperts from solutions of Ca-EGTA and EGTA of identical concentrations, at pH 6.8, which are combined in varying proportions (25Tatham P.E.R. Gomperts B.D. Hutton J.C. Siddle K. Peptide Hormone Secretion: A Practical Approach; Cell Permeabilization. IRL Press, Oxford1990: 257-269Google Scholar, 26Barrowman M.M. Cockcroft S. Gomperts B.D. J. Physiol. 1987; 383: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the reaction, calcium buffers were used at 3 mm EGTA final, giving Ca2+ concentrations ranging from 10−8 to 10−5m(pCa 8 to pCa 5). At pCa 5 and 8, the final ratio of Ca[tot] to EGTA[tot] was 0.938 and O.014, respectively. Free Mg2+ was maintained at 2 mm. Cells were labeled during the 72-h period of differentiation with 0.5 μCi/ml [methyl-3H]choline chloride. Phospholipase D (PLD) activity was measured as described previously (27Geny B. Fensome A. Cockcroft S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, labeled cells were washed and resuspended in isotonic buffer C, containing 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 20 mm PIPES, at 37 °C. 25 μl of labeled cells, corresponding to 106 cells, were transferred to tubes containing an equal volume of the same buffer supplemented with the permeabilizing agent SLO (O.4 units/ml final), Mg-ATP (2 mmfinal), MgCl2 (2 mm final), Ca2+buffered with EGTA (3 mm final) at 10−5m (pCa 5), and GTPγS (10 μmfinal). Fractions containing annexin V to be tested for PLD activity were added in 50-μl aliquots. After incubation at 37 °C, samples were proceeded as reported previously (27Geny B. Fensome A. Cockcroft S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Choline present in the reaction was separated from phosphorus-containing choline metabolites as described by T. W. Martin (28Martin T.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 962: 282-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Phospholipase C activity was measured as described previously (29Geny B. Stutchfield J. Cockcroft S. Cell. Signalling. 1989; 1: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Mutants of annexin V were prepared as followed. Restriction digests, cloning, and isolation of the DNA fragments were performed according to standard procedures (30Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The BamHI/HindIII fragment of the vector pGEX-2T containing the complete annexin V cDNA was cloned into the corresponding site of the Bluescript II KS+ vector. The desired mutation was introduced by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using the procedure of Kunkel et al. (31Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zabour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar). Initial structure analysis of annexin V revealed three high affinity calcium-binding sites located in domains I, II, and IV (6Huber R. Berendes R. Burger A. Schneider M. Karshikov A. Luecke H. Römisch J. Pacques E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 683-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), composed of the structural motif GXGT-(38 residues)-D/E. In each site, the carboxyl acid residue D/E responsible for the bidentate attachment of calcium was suppressed by mutation toward N/Q residue. Thus, Glu-72, Asp-144, and Asp-303 were mutated to Gln, Asn, and Asn, respectively. The mutants Glu-72 → Gln (M1), Asp-144 → Asn (M2), and Asp-303 → Asn (M4) were produced with the synthetic oligonucleotides 5′-PCCTGAAATCACAAGCTGACTGGAAAATTTG-3′, 5′-PGGAAGATGACGTCGTGGGTAACACTTCAGG-3′, and 5′-PGATTTAAGGGAAATACTAGTGGCGACTATAAG-3′ respectively. Recently, another calcium-binding site, related to the presence of Trp-187 and located in domain III, appears to be essential (7Concha N.O. Head J.F. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. Seaton B.A. Science. 1993; 261: 1321-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The related mutant Glu-228 → Ala (M3) was produced with the synthetic oligonucleotide 5′-PCCATTGACCGCGCGACGTCTGGCAATTTAGAGC-3′, which introduced a new AatII site for screening via restriction digests. The appropriate mutated cDNA forms were then selected on the evidence of the restriction site introduced during mutagenesis. The annexin V mutated cDNA inserts were purified by agarose gel and cloned into the pGEX-2T vector. Moreover, multiple calcium-binding sites mutants were produced by digesting and ligating of cDNA from each single mutant into another one. Double mutants M1M2, M1M3, M1M4, and M2M3; triple mutants M1M2M3, M2M3M4, and M1M2M4; and the quadruple mutant M1M2M3M4 were constructed. The cDNA of each mutant was sequenced in its full length to verify the presence of the desired mutation(s) and the absence of others. Wild type and mutated proteins were expressed, isolated, and purified according to previously described procedures (32Rothhut B. Coméra C. Prieur B. Errasfa M Minassian G. Russo-Marie F. FEBS Lett. 1987; 219: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Annexin V was also purified from human placenta using calcium precipitation and anion-exchange chromatography separation (FPLC system; Mono Q column) (32Rothhut B. Coméra C. Prieur B. Errasfa M Minassian G. Russo-Marie F. FEBS Lett. 1987; 219: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, FPLC profiles, and Western blots, proteins were purified to homogeneity. The extinction coefficient of annexin V at 280 nm was used to determine protein concentrations accurately (ε280 = 0, 59 ml/mg·cm−1) (33Evans T.C. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13231-13238Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and to standardize the dye binding assay described by Bradford (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211821) Google Scholar). All determinations were carried out in triplicate, and experiments were repeated on at least three occasions. All data shown are means ± standard error of the means. The release of [3H]arachidonic acid was measured as an index of cPLA2 activity in differentiated HL-60 cells. This enzyme is present in this cell type and was shown to be regulated by calcium, and by kinases: PKCs and/or MAP kinases (21Clark J.D. Schievella A.R. Nalefski E.A. Lin L.-L. J. Lipid Med. Cell Signal. 1995; 12: 83-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A, Ca2+ induces an [3H]AA release in a dose-dependent manner. In our model, up to 0.3 μm of free calcium (pCa = 6.5), no modification in the basal level of arachidonate release is observed. At 1 μmCa2+, AA liberation becomes significant. These data are consistent with previous studies on Ca2+ requirement for cPLA2 activity (21Clark J.D. Schievella A.R. Nalefski E.A. Lin L.-L. J. Lipid Med. Cell Signal. 1995; 12: 83-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), demonstrating that relocation of cPLA2 from cytosol to membrane requires micromolar Ca2+ concentrations (35Clark J.D. Lin L.L. Kriz R.W. Ramesha C.S. Sultzman L.A. Lin A.Y. Milona N. Knopf J.L. Cell. 1991; 65: 1043-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar). Moreover, the non-hydrolyzable nucleotide, GTPγS, which stimulates both small and trimeric G proteins, increases the effect of Ca2+ on AA release. At low levels of calcium, this nucleotide is unable to generate the liberation of AA as observed by another group in electropermeabilized HL-60 granulocytes (Fig. 1 A) (36Xing M. Mattera R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25966-25975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of the phorbol ester, PMA, and of the chemotactic factor, fMLP, were studied (Fig. 1 B). PMA at 100 nm, by itself, has no effect on arachidonate release. However, at 10 μm [Ca2+], this tumor promotor increases AA release by 150%. At such calcium concentrations, it can be hypothesized that calcium-dependent conventional PKCs are activated to a level leading to AA release by cPLA2. A similar observation has been reported in Me2SO-differentiated U937 cells (37Rzigalinski B.A. Rosenthal M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1223: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Moreover, PMA increases to a large extent the effect of GTPγS on arachidonate release as shown on Fig. 1 (A and B). In comparison, fMLP added 2 min before permeabilization, allows a small but significant increase in AA release even at pCa 7. This powerful agonist possesses specific receptors on HL-60 differentiated by dibutyryl cAMP (38Chaplinski T.J. Bennet T.E. Leukemia Res. 1986; 10: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). fMLP stimulation is mediated by Ras and the MAP kinase cascade within minutes after its addition (39Worthen G.S. Avdi N.

Thus, our model of permeabilized differentiated HL-60 cell is adequate to study the regulation of enzyme activity involved in AA release. Free arachidonic acid present in cells can result from the activation of different enzymes (41Piomelli D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). This fatty acid can be liberated after a concerted action of PLC and diacylglycerol lipase (41Piomelli D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Different groups have shown that, in permeabilized HL-60 cells, AA is not the product of the activation of these enzymes, but is due to phospholipid hydrolysis after phospholipase A2 activation (23Xing M.

This family contains two distinct groups of several enzymes, the secretory PLA2 (sPLA2), active in the extracellular compartment and the cytoplasmic PLA2s, active intracellularly (16Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13057-13060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first group is composed of 14-kDa enzymes, which are inactivated by thiol compounds reducing their essential disulfide bonds (12Davidson F.F. Dennis E.A. Powell M. Glenney Jr., J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1698-1705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Streptolysin O is a permeabilizing agent only in its reduced form requiring a reducing medium. Experiments in cells permeabilized with SLO were nevertheless performed with or without 2 mm DTT. As shown in Fig. 2 A, DTT had no effect on calcium-dependent [3H]AA release due to the presence of a reducing agent in SLO. Results similar to those reported above have been obtained with GTPγS, PMA, or fMLP stimulations (not shown). So far, the second group of PLA2 family consists in most cells of two different cytosolic enzymes. The first one is the group IV calcium-dependent 85-kDa cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), selective f"

The deduced amino acid sequence of Aedes preproleucokinin contains a putative signal peptide of 18 amino acid residues and a 210-amino acid residue proleucokinin. Within the proleucokinin are encoded one copy each of the Aedes leucokinins 1, 2, and 3 isolated previously from this species (Veenstra, J. A. (1994)Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.202, 715–719). All threeAedes leucokinins depolarize the transepithelial voltage of the malpighian tubule in concentrations of less than 10−9m and increase the frequency of hindgut contractions at concentrations above 10−8m. At higher concentrations the Aedes leucokinins 1 and 3 but notAedes leucokinin 2 are also able to increase the rate of fluid secretion by the malpighian tubules. The differences of the threeAedes leucokinins in their potencies to induce fluid secretion or depolarizations in the malpighian tubules suggest that there may be more than one type of leucokinin receptor in this tissue.

In insects, diuresis is the final product of fluid secretion by the malpighian tubules and water reabsorption in the hindgut (1Bradley T.J. Kerkut G.A. Gilbert L.I.

In at least two species, these are the same cells that produce the CRF-like diuretic hormones (11Chen Y. Veenstra J.A. Hagedorn H.H. Davis N.T. Cell Tissue Res. 1994; 278: 493-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 24Thompson K.S.J. Rayne R.C. Gibbon C.R. May S.T. Patel M. Coast G.M. Bacon J.P. Peptides. 1995; 16: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In some insects a group of median neurosecretory cells in the brain also contains leucokinin-like immunoreactivity (26Cantera R. Hansson B.S. Hallberg E. Nässel D.R. Cell Tissue Res. 1992; 269: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 28Chen Y. Veenstra J.A. Davis N.T. Hagedorn H.H. Cell Tissue Res. 1994; 276: 69-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). So far only a single cDNA sequence encoding one of the CRF-like diuretic homones from M. sextahas been described (29Digan M.E. Roberts D.N. Enderlin F.E. Woodworth A.R. Kramer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11074-11078Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), but no cDNA or genomic sequences are known for any of the leucokinins. Consequently, it is currently unknown whether the leucokinins are produced from different precursors,e.g. as the insect adipokinetic hormones (30Bogerd J. Kooiman F.P. Pijnenburg M.A.P. Hekking L.H.P. Oudejans R.C.H.M. Van der Horst D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23038-23043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), or from a single precursor like the Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-amides (31Schneider L.E. Taghert P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1993-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Diuresis in mosquitoes has been well studied, particularly inAedes aegypti. This species is known to show an extensive diuresis after eclosion (32Gillett J.D. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1982; 216: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 33Gillett J.D. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1983; 217: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), as well as after a blood meal (34Williams J.C. Hagedorn H.H. Beyenbach K.W. J. Comp. Physiol. 1983; 153: 257-265Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Three diuretic factors from the head have been characterized, two of which are able to stimulate fluid secretion in isolated malpighian tubules (35Petzel D.H. Hagedorn H.H. Beyenbach K.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: R701-R711Google Scholar). Three leucokinins were also recently isolated from this species (19Veenstra J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 715-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Here, we report the structure of a cDNA encoding theAedes leucokinins and show that in the mosquito the leucokinins are active on both the malpighian tubules and the hindgut of this species. A. aegypti were reared as described (36Shapiro J.P. Hagedorn H.H. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 1982; 46: 176-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Abdominal ganglia were dissected from 200 adult females, 0–4 days after emergence. Dissected ganglia were stored frozen at −70 °C until mRNA was extracted using a Micro-FastTrack™ kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The mRNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript and cloned into λ-ZipLox (Life Technologies, Inc.). The phage was packaged using Gold packaging extract (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and amplified onEscherichia coli Y1090(ZL) (Life Technologies, Inc.). The following oligonucleotides were synthetized by the Division of Biotechnology at The University of Arizona: 7575, 3′-AAYAAYCCIAAYGTITTYTAYCCITGGGG-5′, in which I stands for 2′-deoxyinosine; 8242, 3′-CCCCACGCATGGAATGGGTTCCG-5′; 8365, 3′-GCCTGGAATGTGTTCTTGG-5′; 8430, 3′-GCAACTCCAAGTACGTCTCCAAGC-5′; 8432, 3′-GTGTGTGCCGTGCATGAATGG-5′; M13, 3′-TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3′; T7, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG3′; and M13 reverse, 5′-AGGAAACAGCTATGACCATG-3′. A partial cDNA was isolated by using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with Taqpolymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) and two primers, 7575 (based on the sequence of Aedes leucokinin 3) and M13 (based on the cloning vector). As a substrate for the PCR phenol choroform extracted DNA from the amplified library was used. Thirty cycles were programmed consisting of 2 min of denaturation at 94 °C, primer annealing at 44 °C for 2 min, slow rise to 72 °C over 2 min, and extension at 72 °C for 3 min. Full-length clones were isolated by plating theA. aegypti abdominal ganglia cDNA library on LB plates and lifting the plaques on nitrocellulose filters (Biotrace NT from Gelman Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI). The probe was a PCR product labeled with [α-32P]dATP using Klenow polymerase and primers 7575 and 8242. Positive clones were plaque purified and in vivo excised by infecting E. coli DH10B(ZIP) from Life Technologies, Inc. Sequencing reactions were performed withTaq polymerase and fluorescent dideoxynucleotides (Applied Biosystems), and the reaction products were electrophoresed and analyzed on an automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems model 373) by the Division of Biotechnology of the University of Arizona. Sequence was obtained in both directions using primers 8242, 8365, 8430, 8432, T7, and M13. Total RNA was isolated from whole adult mosquitoes that had been killed by freezing them rapidly at −70 °C. They were pulverized in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle and subsequently rapidly extracted using the guanidinium thiocyanate method (37Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After centrifugation through a CsCl2 cushion, poly(A+) RNA was isolated from total RNA using an oligo(dT) spin column from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). RNA was electrophoresed in a 1.1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and blotted onto Nytran membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Hybridization was performed under high stringency conditions using the cDNA, cut from the plasmid with restriction enzyme Mlu1, and labeled with [α-32P]dATP using a random primer kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNA molecular size markers were from Life Technologies, Inc. Synthesis, purification, and quantification ofAedes leucokinin 1 (Asn-Ser-Lys-Tyr-Val-Ser-Lys-Gln-Lys-Phe-Tyr-Ser-Trp-Gly-amide),Aedes leucokinin 2 (Asn-Pro-Phe-His-Ala-Trp-Gly-amide), andAedes leucokinin 3 (Asn-Asn-Pro-Asn-Val-Phe-Tyr-Pro-Trp-Gly-amide) have been described (18Schoofs L. Holman G.M. van Proost D.J. Hayes T.K. de Loof A. Regul. Pept. 1992; 37: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The transepithelial voltage in the malpighian tubules was measured using the method of Burg et al. (38Burg M. Grantham J. Abramow M. Orloff J. Am. J. Physiol. 1966; 210: 1293-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Voltage was recorded in the lumen with respect to ground in the bath using Ag-AgCl electrodes. The recording electrode was placed in the inner perfusion pipette. No distal holding pipette was used, but because the electrical length constant of these tubules (about 300 μm) is considerably less than the length of the tubules used (more than 1.8 mm), this does not significantly affect voltage measurements. Peptides were applied by adding fixed concentrations of the peptides to the superfusing bath saline. Female 3–7-day-old mosquitoes were cold-anesthetized and decapitated, and the digestive tract and adhering malpighian tubules dissected. The proximal ends of the malpighian tubules were severed from the pylorus, and the digestive tract was cut at the pyloric valve. The hindgut with the adhering malpighian tubules was transferred to a 20-μl drop of saline covered with water-saturated light white paraffin oil (Fisher). The proximal ends of the malpighian tubules were pulled into the paraffin oil, and the volume of the fluid secreted into the oil was estimated by measuring the long and short axes of the droplet with an ocular micrometer and by approximating the volume of the droplet as a prolate spheroid. Fluid secretion was measured during a 30-min control period, after which known concentrations of the Aedes leucokinins were added to the saline, and fluid secretion was measured over another 30 min. Results are expressed as an increase in fluid secretion. Each tubule was used for only one concentration. Hindgut contractions were monitored using a modification of the assay system described before (39Mowry T.M. Adams T. Miller J.R. J. Insect Physiol. 1987; 33: 867-873Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 40Messer A.C. Brown M.R. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 2325-2336PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the hindgut of an adult female mosquito is held between an immobile suction pipette holding the rectum and a mobile suction pipette attached just anteriorly to the pyloric valve. Movements of the gut cause movements of a small flag attached to the mobile pipette, which interrupts the light from a photoemitter before it reaches a photodetector. The signal was recorded digitally by computer. The tissue is kept in a 50-μl perfusion bath that is constantly perfused with saline at a rate of 100 μl/min with a peristaltic pump. A. aegypti saline contained the following salts: 1.8 mm CaCl2, 3.4 mm KCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.6 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm NaHCO3, 25 mm HEPES, and 5 mm glucose. The pH was adjusted to 7.2 with NaOH. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for statistical analysis of fluid secretion rates. Oligonucleotide 7575 end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP was initially intended to be used as a probe to screen the abdominal ganglia cDNA library. However, this primer and one based on the vector gave a distinct band in PCR and automated sequence analysis of the purified excised band yielded sequencing signal, which, although very poor, contained in it the sequence for Aedes leucokinin 2. A primer based on the obtained nucleotide sequence for Aedes leucokinin 2 (8242) was next used in PCR together with the M13 reverse primer. This PCR reaction yielded several products, most of which had a size close to 870 base pairs, of which 120 base pairs were vector sequence, whereas two minor products had sizes of approximately 300 and 400 base pairs. Automated sequence analysis of the different products revealed that all were transcribed from the same gene, with the smaller products being incompletely reverse transcribed cDNAs. The library was subsequently screened with a PCR product generated by primers 7575 and 8242 to obtain a full-length clone, which was excised in vivo into plasmid pZL1 and sequenced in both directions. The sequence of the longest cDNA obtained is shown in Fig.1. The first ATG is followed immediately by a stop codon, but the second ATG shows the beginning of a classical signal peptide, which is likely to be cleaved between residues 18 and 19 (41von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar). The putative preproleucokinin also reveals the presence of one copy each of theAedes leucokinins 1, 2, and 3. Classical Lys-Arg proteolytic processing sites delimit the three Aedes leucokinins, and all the Aedes leucokinins have a C-terminal Gly residue that can be processed into the C-terminal amides present in the mature peptides (42Bradbury A.F. Finnie M.D.A. Smyth D.G. Nature. 1982; 298: 686-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Apart from the Aedes leucokinins, none of the possible products of the preproleucokinin have significant sequence similarity with any described protein or peptide, as sequence comparisons with the sequences available in the data base revealed. Analysis of mRNA isolated from whole mosquitoes showed a single message of about 1300 base pairs (Fig. 2), thus suggesting that the isolated cDNA may be lacking about 200 bases at its 5′-end. All three Aedesleucokinins depolarize the malpighian tubules when added to the bathing saline. The concentrations of the peptides needed to obtain a depolarization in 50% of the malpighian tubules are 2.5 ± 1.2 × 10−11m, 3.9 ± 1.7 × 10−10m, and 2.6 ± 1.4 × 10−10m for the Aedes leucokinins 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Transepithelial membrane voltages in unstimulated malpighian tubules are generally between 40 and 60 mV (lumen positive). Such voltages may be either stable or show spontaneous depolarizations. In the presence of low concentration of leucokinins, these depolarizations increase in frequency, and with increasing leucokinin concentrations the depolarization may become continuous (Fig. 3). Previous work has shown that cyclic AMP hyperpolarizes the malpighian tubules (43Williams J.C. Beyenbach K.W. J. Comp. Physiol. 1984; 154: 301-309Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar), but in the presence of depolarizations such as being induced by the leucokinins these hyperpolarizations become only visible after washout. Occasionally after washout of the leucokinins from the bath, the malpighian tubule would be temporarily hyperpolarized, e.g. as in Fig. 3 after washout of 10−10m Aedes leucokinin 3. Although small quantitative differences were noted in the potencies of the three Aedes leucokinins (see above), no consistent qualitative differences were found in the depolarizations induced by the Aedes leucokinins. The Aedes leucokinins were also tested for their effects on fluid secretion by the malpighian tubules. Small increases in the rate of fluid secretion were observed for theAedes leucokinins 1 and 3 but not for Aedesleucokinin 2 in concentrations of 10−8, 10−7, and 10−6m (Fig. 4). When exposed to concentrations of 10−9 or 10−8m of the threeAedes leucokinins, the hindgut contractions always increased in frequency. This effect was reversible, because on washout of the peptides the frequency of the contractions returned to the rate before addition of the peptides. In one out of four preparations tested, we were also able to see a significant effect with a concentration of 10−10m of Aedes leucokinin 2 (Fig.5). The fragility of the mosquito hindgut and the large variability in the rate of contractions under control conditions prevented us from obtaining sufficient data for meaningful dose-response curves. Nevertheless, the data clearly demonstrated that each of the three Aedes leucokinins increases the frequency of contractions in this tissue in concentrations of 10−8–10−9m (Fig. 5). Peptide isolation efforts yielded only three Aedesleucokinins (19Veenstra J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 715-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), whose structures are the same as those predicted by the cDNA isolated here. This strongly suggests that A. aegypti has only three leucokinins and not eight or five like the cockroach L. maderae (13Holman G.M. Cook B.J. Nachman R.J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1986; 84C: 205-211Google Scholar, 14Holman G.M. Cook B.J. Nachman R.J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1986; 84C: 271-276Google Scholar, 15Holman G.M. Cook B.J. Nachman R.J. Comp. Biochem.

Wright M.A McCaffery A.R. Wilson I.D. Chromatography and Isolation of Insect Hormones and Pheromones. Plenum Press, New York1990: 195-204Crossref Google Scholar), respectively. Three leucokinins were also isolated from the moth Helicoverpa zea (21Blackburn M.B. Wagner R.M. Shabanowitz J. Kochansky J.P. Hunt D.F. Raina A.K. J. Insect Physiol. 1995; 41: 723-730Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The leucokinin cDNA did not code for a CRF-like diuretic hormone, and there is not even a small sequence similarity with the M. sexta CRF-like diuretic hormone cDNA, suggesting that these two different insect peptide families are encoded by different genes. It has been shown in vertebrates that the PC1/PC3 convertase, which normally cleaves the peptide preucursor at Lys-Arg dibasic sites, is also able to function as a mono-arginyl convertase, if the Arg residue is present in a favorable context, i.e. there is a basic amino acid four or six amino acid residues N-terminal from the cleavage site (47Delphin F. Trans. R. Entomol. Soc. Lond. 1965; 117: 167-213Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). One mono-arginyl processing site must be cleaved in the proleucokinin to obtain Aedes leucokinin 2. The presence of a Lys five amino acid residues N-terminal of this cleavage site can be expected to be only marginally effective (44Nakayama K. Watanabe T. Nakagawa T. Kim W.-S. Nagahama M. Hosaka M. Hatsuzawa K. Kondoh-Hashiba K. Murakami K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16335-16340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Devi L. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 189-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), but the presence of an Arg three residues more N-terminal is possibly sufficient to induce cleavage (45Devi L. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 189-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). An additional cleavage might occur at the Arg51-Tyr52-Arg53-Lys54sequence of the preproleucokinin (45Devi L. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 189-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The sequence of the preproleucokinin between amino acids 19 and 164 has no similarity with any known protein. Thus, the Aedesleucokinins may be the only biologically active peptides produced from this precursor. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that four Cys residues (or five, depending on whether proteolytic cleavage occurs in the region Arg51-Tyr52-Arg53-Lys54) are present in this part of the precursor. Cys residues in regulatory peptides can be histochemically identified by paraldehyde-fuchsin staining methods (46Gabe M. Techniques Histologiques. Masson et Cie, Paris1968Google Scholar), and the leucokinin-immunoreactive neuroendocrine cells in the abdominal ganglia of hemimetabolous insect species are stained by paraldehyde-fuchsin (28Chen Y. Veenstra J.A. Davis N.T. Hagedorn H.H. Cell Tissue Res. 1994; 276: 69-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 47Delphin F. Trans. R. Entomol. Soc. Lond. 1965; 117: 167-213Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 48Gaude H. Zoology (Jena). 1975; 194: 151-164Google Scholar). This suggests that these Cys residues are responsible for the observed paraldehyde fuchsin staining. Because the paraldehyde-fuchsin staining appears to be conserved between different species, these Cys residues and this part of the precursor are likely to be conserved also. It will thus be of interest to determine the structure of other leucokinin precursors. Several neuropeptides are produced as multiple copies on a single precursor in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Sometimes a single peptide is present in exactly the same sequence in several copies; however in other cases single copies of structurally related peptides are found, as here for the Aedes leucokinins. It is clear from the work on opioid peptides in vertebrates that different peptides from the same precursor interact preferentially with the various receptors, and a wide variety of different opioid receptors has been found in vertebrates (49Kieffer B.L. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1995; 15: 615-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Although there appear to be only threeAedes leucokinins, these are structurally sufficiently diverse to raise the question of whether or not they might have different receptors. The Aedes leucokinins have different threshold concentrations when assayed for depolarizing activity on the malpighian tubules; they also have different potencies on fluid secretion. However, whereas Aedes leucokinin 1 is the most potent depolarizer, Aedes leucokinin 3 is the most potent inducer of fluid secretion, and Aedes leucokinin 2 was without significant effects on fluid secretion. As suggested by an anonymous reviewer, this might be due to the rapid inactivation ofAedes leucokinin 2 during the fluid secretion assay. We therefore performed a fluid secretion assay containing 10−6m Aedes leucokinin 2 and tested the bathing saline after the assay for effects on the transepithelial voltage. The results showed no measurable decrease in activity in the transepithelial assay, even when exposure to the malpighian tubules was increased to 1 h, and hence the absence of significant effects of Aedes leucokinin 2 on fluid secretion is not due to the rapid inactivation of this peptide during the fluid secretion assay. It has been shown previously that strong depolarizing activity is not necessarily correlated with strong effects on fluid secretion. Thus diuretic factor 1 causes the malpighian tubule to depolarize but has little effect on fluid secretion, whereas diuretic factor 3 has only limited depolarizing activity but has strong effects on fluid secretion. The absence of strong effects on fluid secretion suggests that one or more of the Aedes leucokinins may represent the diuretic activity previously described as factor 1 (35Petzel D.H. Hagedorn H.H. Beyenbach K.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: R701-R711Google Scholar). It has been shown elsewhere that the leucokinins regulate the chloride conductance of the malpighian tubule (50Pannabecker T.L. Hayes T.K. Beyenbach K.W. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 132: 63-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 52Davies S.A. Huesmann G.R. Maddrell S.H.P. O'Donnell M.J. Skaer N.J.V. Dow J.A.T. Tublitz N.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: R1321-R1326PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown, that althoughAedes leucokinin 2 depolarizes the malpighian tubule and affects the chloride conductance 2D. H. Petzel, unpublished observation. in the same fashion as the other leucokinins, it does not appear to stimulate fluid secretion by the malpighian tubules. This suggests thatAedes leucokinin 2 may be specifically regulating chloride conductance, and it indicates that increasing chloride conductance in the malpighian tubules by itself may be insufficient to lead to an increase in fluid secretion. Furthermore, these results may also suggest the existence of different receptors for the leucokinins in the malpighian tubules of A. aegypti. Drosophila melanogaster has malpighian tubules that are morphologically similar to those in A. aegypti, and it is likely that the regulatory mechanisms of fluid secretion by the malpighian tubules in these two Dipteran species are also similar (51O'Donnell M.J. Dow J.A.T. Huesmann G.R. Tublitz N.J. Maddrell S.H.P. J. Exp. Biol. 1996; 199: 1163-1165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has recently been shown for Drosophila that the stimulation of fluid secretion by the leucokinins can be augmented by cAMP and cGMP but not by thapsigargin, which induces release of intracellular calcium, whereas thapsigargin is able to augment fluid secretion induced by either cAMP or cGMP. This indicates that the stimulation of fluid secretion by the leucokinins is associated with an increase in intracellular calcium (52Davies S.A. Huesmann G.R. Maddrell S.H.P. O'Donnell M.J. Skaer N.J.V. Dow J.A.T. Tublitz N.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: R1321-R1326PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the secondary messengers induced by the Aedes leucokinins may clarify whether the three Aedes leucokinins activate more than one receptor. The maximal effects on fluid secretion of the Aedesleucokinins are small compared with the effects of crude mosquito head extracts, which are able to induce much larger increases in fluid secretion (35Petzel D.H. Hagedorn H.H. Beyenbach K.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: R701-R711Google Scholar, 53Veenstra J.A. J. Insect Physiol. 1988; 34: 299-304Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar), whereas significant increases in fluid secretion happen only at relatively high leucokinin concentrations. TheAedes leucokinins are therefore unlikely to be the major diuretic hormones regulating diuresis after a blood meal, when urine flow is as high as 40 nl/min (34Williams J.C. Hagedorn H.H. Beyenbach K.W. J. Comp. Physiol. 1983; 153: 257-265Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar), which is equivalent to a fluid secretion rate of 8 nl/min per malpighian tubule. Thus the leucokinins are probably mere modulators of diuresis, as is 5-hydroxytryptamine, which is able to stimulate fluid secretion by the malpighian tubules only at unphysiologically high concentrations (53Veenstra J.A. J. Insect Physiol. 1988; 34: 299-304Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that in the mosquito the leucokinins are able to stimulate both fluid secretion by the malpighian tubules and hindgut contractions, and this appears to be the first instance in which both effects are known for a single species. This is noteworthy, because it has been reported for the locust that locustakinin (the sole identified locust leucokinin homolog) does not stimulate hindgut contractions (18Schoofs L. Holman G.M. van Proost D.J. Hayes T.K. de Loof A. Regul. Pept. 1992; 37: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), although it does stimulate fluid secretion by the malpighian tubules (24Thompson K.S.J. Rayne R.C. Gibbon C.R. May S.T. Patel M. Coast G.M. Bacon J.P. Peptides. 1995; 16: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).

The amino acid sequences responsible for these multiple functions of the amino terminus have been partially identified. The leucine zipper, a sequence of heptad repeats of leucines and isoleucines forming an α-helical structure at the first part of the amino terminus (9Landgraf W. Hofmann F. Pelton J.P. Huggins J.P.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9387-9395Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), has been identified as the dimerization domain. Removal of the leucine zipper along with the autoinhibitory domain (residues 1–78) of cGK Iα results in a permanently active and monomeric enzyme, which still binds cGMP to its two binding sites but with lower affinity than the native enzyme (11Heil W.G. Landgraf W. Hofmann F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The removal of the leucine zipper in cGK Iβ (residues 1–62) results in a monomeric cGK that is still activated by cGMP (2Wolfe L. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4157-4162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the autoinhibitory domain resides in a sequence that is carboxyl-terminal to the leucine zipper. The autoinhibitory sequences contain the main in vitro autophosphorylation sites of cGK Iα (12Aitken A. Hemmings B. Hofmann F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 790: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and cGK Iβ (13Francis S.H. Smith J. Walsh K. Kumar S. Colbran J. Corbin J. FASEB J. 1993; 7: A 1123Google Scholar). To date it has remained unclear which amino acid sequences of the amino terminus regulate the binding affinity for cGMP (1Landgraf W. Hofmann F. Eur. J.

Chem. 1989; 264: 7734-7741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), differ only in their first 89 and 104 amino-terminal residues, respectively. Although these amino termini do not contain the cGMP binding sites, the two isozymes differ 15-fold in their affinity for cGMP. Cyclic GMP binds to a high and a low affinity site with K d values of 10 and 150 nm in cGK Iα (3Ruth P. Landgraf W. Keilbach A. May B. Egleme C. Hofmann F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 1339-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 18Corbin J.D. Doskeland S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11391-11397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but to two low affinity sites withKdvalues of 150 nm in cGK Iβ (3Ruth P. Landgraf W. Keilbach A. May B. Egleme C. Hofmann F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 1339-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These differences in cGMP binding of the two isozymes are also reflected in the dissociation kinetics. Cyclic GMP dissociates with a fast and a slow rate from cGK Iα, but only with a fast rate from cGK Iβ. The decreased binding affinity of the cGK Iβ results in a 15-fold increase in the cGMP concentration needed for half-maximal activation when compared with cGK Iα (3Ruth P. Landgraf W. Keilbach A. May B. Egleme C. Hofmann F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 1339-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 19Pöhler D. Butt E. Meißner J. Müller S. Lohse M. Walter U. Lohmann S.M. Jarchau T. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To identify those amino acid sequences within the amino terminus that determine the affinity of the isozymes for cGMP, chimeras of cGK Iα and cGK Iβ were constructed. The analysis of these chimeras shows that the leucine zipper and the autoinhibitory domain mainly affect the phenotype. [Ser21]protein kinase inhibitor-(14–22) substrate peptide and protein kinase inhibitor-(5–24) amide were synthesized as described (20Keilbach A. Ruth P. Hofmann F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The expression vector pMT3 was obtained from R. Kaufmann, Genetics Institute, Cambridge, MA. An oligo(dT)-primed, size-fractionated cDNA library was constructed in the pcDNAII vector. Colonies (3 × 105) were screened with a 980-base pair cDNA fragment (nucleotides 1635–2616) from mouse cGK II (21Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13586-13591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hybridization was performed under low stringency (50 °C). A clone with an insert of 2.5 kilobase pairs was identified as cGK Iβ. This clone contained the complete coding region of cGK Iβ and confirmed the sequence composed of partial clones (14Wernet W. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. FEBS Lett. 1989; 251: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The cGK Iβ cDNA containing the consensus sequence for optimal expression in Sf9 cells was ligated into pFastBac1 yielding the bacmid transfer vector pFB1/cGKIβ. Transformation of pFB1/cGKIβ into Max Efficiency DH10Bac cells, identification of recombinant clones, and isolation of the recombinant bacmid DNA were performed according to the instructions of the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). Recombinant bacmid DNA was transfected into Sf9 cells. Recombinant viruses were identified by their ability to direct the expression of cGK Iβ. Recombinant virus was amplified without further purification and viral titer estimated by end point dilution. Suspension cultures (1.3 × 1010 Sf9 cells/7.2 liters) were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 10. After 72 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with serum-free TC-100 medium, resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mmdl-dithiothreithol, 2.5 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin), and stored at −80 °C. Cells were lysed by freeze/thawing, homogenized, and centrifuged. The supernatant was loaded onto an cAMP affinity column packed with cAMP-agarose (Sigma, catalog no. A7775) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with buffer A prior to elution of bound cGK Iβ with buffer A supplemented with 100 μm cGMP. The eluate was dialyzed against 20 mm TES buffer (pH 7.1), containing 2.5 mmdl-dithiothreithol, 0.1 mm sodium azide, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. The purified protein was concentrated to ∼4 mg/ml using Macrosep-10 concentrators (Pall Filtron), made up 50% (v/v) in glycerol and stored at −20 °C. The cGK Iα was expressed (22Feil R. Müller S. Hofmann F. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and purified (23Feil R. Kellermann J. Hofmann F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13152-13158Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) as described. The coding DNA sequence of cGK Iα (nucleotides −6 to 2120) and cGK Iβ (nucleotides −23 to 2165) were constructed into the eukaryotic expression vector pMT3 (24Swick A.G. Janicot M. Cheneval-Kastelic T. McLenithan J.C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1812-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). For constructing chimeras, replacement sequences containing amino-terminal domains of cGK Iα and cGK Iβ with the boundaries as given in Fig. 2 were generated by standard polymerase chain reaction overlap extension techniques. All chimeras exhibited the Koczak consensus sequence ACC (nucleotides −3 to −1) prior to the ATG start codon. COS-7 cells were transfected, and cytosolic proteins containing recombinant cGKs were extracted as described previously (3Ruth P. Landgraf W. Keilbach A. May B. Egleme C. Hofmann F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 1339-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The activity of the expressed Iα, Iβ, and chimeric cGK was measured as described (3Ruth P. Landgraf W. Keilbach A. May B. Egleme C. Hofmann F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 1339-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).K a values were obtained by a nonlinear fit of the data according to the Hill equation. Equilibrium binding of [3H]cGMP to the expressed cGK proteins was carried out as described (3Ruth P. Landgraf W. Keilbach A. May B. Egleme C. Hofmann F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 1339-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Binding of [3H]cGMP to sites A and B was determined as described (1Landgraf W. Hofmann F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Calculation of the K d values and the maximal binding capacities was performed by the LIGAND program (25Munson P.J.

The stoichiometry of cGMP binding was calculated by dividing the maximal binding capacity obtained from Scatchard analysis by the amount of cGK present in the cytosolic extract from COS cells. The concentration of cGK in COS cell extracts was determined by the phosphotransferase activity using the specific activity of 2.4 ng of pure cGK added to an identical amount of cytosolic extract from control COS cells. The 2.4 ng of cGK yielded a specific activity of 4 μmol of phosphate transferred/min/mg of pure cGK. Dissociation rate constants were measured as described (3Ruth P. Landgraf W. Keilbach A. May B. Egleme C. Hofmann F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 1339-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Weighting factors were obtained by an iterative procedure using chimeras 1–19 and optimized by one-dimensional interpolation. Data are means ± S.E. of 5–17 (K a) and 3–5 (k −1(fast),k −1(slow)) determinations from at least three different expressions. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test for paired and unpaired data. Ap value less than 0.05 was considered to be significant. A full-length cDNA for the cGK Iβ was cloned from bovine testis that confirmed the previously published cDNA sequence of bovine cGK Iβ deduced from partial clones (14Wernet W. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. FEBS Lett. 1989; 251: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The cloning of a full-length cDNA excluded the possibility that the cGK Iβ differed from the cGK Iα isozyme in regions other than the amino-terminal domain. In contrast, the previously published human cGK Iβ sequence (15Sandberg M. Natarajan V. Ronander I. Kalderon D. Walter U. Lohmann S.M. Jahnsen T. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) differed from the bovine full-length clone at Lys280 and Asn290, which were replaced in the human cGK Iβ by Thr280 and Ser290, respectively. To demonstrate that the differences in cGMP binding and activation between cGK Iα and cGK Iβ (3Ruth P. Landgraf W. Keilbach A. May B. Egleme C. Hofmann F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 1339-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) were intrinsic properties of the isozymes, cGK Iα and cGK Iβ were expressed in Sf9 cells, purified to homogeneity, and subsequently characterized. The phosphotransferase activity of cGK Iα was stimulated 7-fold by cGMP with apparentK a and V max values of 59 nm and 6.2 μmol/min × mg, respectively (Fig.1). The phosphotransferase activity of cGK Iβ was stimulated 35-fold with apparent K a andV max values of 1210 nm and 7.6 μmol/min × mg, respectively. The dissociation kinetics of cGMP from the cGK Iα clearly defined a fast dissociation rate from a low affinity site and a slow dissociation rate from a high affinity site (Fig. 1). In contrast, cGK Iβ exhibited only fast dissociation from two low affinity sites. The corresponding k −1values were 6.2 and 0.009 min−1 for cGK Iα and 5.3 min−1 for cGK Iβ. Equilibrium binding experiments indicated that cGK Iα and cGK Iβ bound 1.8 and 1.6 mol of cGMP/mol of subunit, respectively. The apparent K d values were 98 and 7 nm for cGK Iα and 172 nm for cGK Iβ. These results suggest that the binding and catalytic constants of pure cGK Iα and cGK Iβ expressed in Sf9 cells were similar to those measured in the cytosolic extract of COS cells (3Ruth P. Landgraf W. Keilbach A. May B. Egleme C. Hofmann F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 1339-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To identify the structural basis of their 15–20-fold differences in the K a values, the amino-terminal domains of cGK Iα and cGK Iβ were aligned and subdivided into six domains, S1–S6 (Fig. 2): S1, the extreme amino-terminal sequence; S2, the leucine zipper containing 5 heptad repeats of leucines; S3, the short linker connecting the leucine zipper and the autoinhibitory domain; S4, the autoinhibitory domain containing the substrate-like sequence PRT59TR with the autophosphorylation site (Thr59) of cGK Iα (12Aitken A. Hemmings B. Hofmann F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 790: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and the putative pseudosubstrate sequence KRQAISAE of cGK Iβ (26Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 342-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar); and S5, the first part, and S6, the second part of the hinge domain, which links the amino terminus to the other domains of the cGK. The hinge domain was subdivided since proteolysis at Arg78/Gln79 led to a monomeric and active cGK Iα, which had different cGMP binding properties than the intact cGK Iα (11Heil W.G. Landgraf W. Hofmann F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), suggesting that the sequences amino-terminal from Gln79 considerably influence the binding properties of the enzyme. For the construction of chimeras, the six domains with the boundaries defined above were exchanged between cGK Iα and cGK Iβ. Expression vectors carrying the coding sequence of cGK chimeras or that of cGK Iα and cGK Iβ were transfected into COS cells. The chimeric and wild type cGK proteins were identified in the soluble extracts of transfected cells by an antibody directed against a carboxyl-terminal sequence of the enzyme (20Keilbach A. Ruth P. Hofmann F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The mutant and wild type cGK had apparentM r values of 75 kDa and were expressed at concentrations between 0.5 and 4.5 μg/mg of soluble protein, respectively, as assessed by their maximal cGMP binding capacities. All of the chimeras expressed comigrated with the pure cGK Iα and cGK Iβ in 5–15% sucrose density gradient centrifugation withs 20w values between 7.2 and 7.8, suggesting that they were dimers. Subsequently, the chimeras were characterized by the cGMP concentration needed for half-maximal activation (K a) and the dissociation rate constants (k −1) of cGMP from the high and low affinity site. The K a values for cGMP of the cGK Iα and cGK Iβ expressed in COS cells were 77 and 1748 nm, respectively (Fig. 3). Almost identical values were obtained with the pure isozymes (Fig. 1). Cyclic GMP dissociated with a slow rate (k −1 = 0.008 min−1) and a fast rate (k −1 = 6.5 min−1) from the high and low affinity site of the cGK Iα (Fig. 3). In contrast, only fast dissociation from the two low affinity sites was observed for cGK Iβ (k −1 = 5.0). The two cGMP binding sites of cGK Iβ could not be distinguished kinetically. Studying several chimeras with randomized permutations in the six amino-terminal domains, we identified the sequences necessary to generate the respective phenotype. Chimeras containing the sequence of cGK Iβ in S2 and S4 (chimeras 1–5) exhibitedK a values between 580 and 1136 nm. These constants were only 1.5–3-fold lower than the K avalue of cGK Iβ. The cGK Iβ phenotype of chimeras 1 to 5 was further confirmed by monophasic dissociation with rate constants between 4.4 and 10 min−1. Substitutions of cGK Iα sequence in S1, S3, S5, and S6, alone or in combination, did only marginally affect the kinetic constants of chimeras 1–5. Conversely, chimeras 6–9 containing the cGK Iα sequence in S2 and S4 hadK a values between 112 and 169 nm. These values were only 1.4- and 2.2-fold above that of cGK Iα (Fig. 3). In agreement with the cGK Iα-like activation constants, these chimeras showed biphasic dissociation kinetics with a fast and a slow component (Fig. 3). The presence of cGK Iβ substitutions in S1, S3, S5, and S6 did not substantially alter the high affinity cGK Iα phenotype of these chimeras. These results suggested that the leucine zipper along with the autoinhibitory domain were the main structural elements which determine the affinity of the cGK isozymes. Interestingly, these two domains are very homologous between cGK Iα and cGK Iβ with 28 identical, 4 conservatively substituted, and 22 different amino acids (Fig. 2), suggesting that 29% and 25% of the total residues of the amino terminus (cGK Iα = 89 and cGK Iβ = 104 amino acids) were sufficient to generate the high affinity cGK Iα and the low affinity cGK Iβ phenotype, respectively. Chimera 9 and 5 were exemplarily selected to measure the equilibrium binding of cGMP, because they fulfilled the minimal requirements for the high affinity cGK Iα and low affinity cGK Iβ phenotype, respectively. Both chimeras bound about 4 mol of cGMP/mol of holoenzyme (Fig.4). As expected, chimera 9 bound cGMP to sites 1 and 2 with apparent K d values of 4.3 nm and 439 nm and a stoichiometry of 2.4 and 1.4 mol of cGMP bound/mol of holoenzyme, respectively. The dissociation induced by the addition of a 1000-fold excess of unlabeled cGMP yielded two rates of 0.008 and 6.5 min−1. Chimera 5 bound 4 mol of cGMP/mol of holoenzyme with an apparent K d of 195 nm. A distinct high affinity site was not detected. These results suggested that chimera 5 contained two low affinity binding sites. This finding was confirmed by monophasic dissociation of cGMP with a rate constant of 4.8 min−1. These values are not different from the wild type enzymes and indicate, therefore, that S2 and S4 determine the high affinity cGK Iα and low affinity cGK Iβ phenotype. The results above did not definitely rule out that the cGK Iα or cGK Iβ phenotype would also be obtained by the substitution of S2 or S4 alone. Chimeras 10–17 with substitution in only one domain exhibited an intermediate phenotype with K a values of about 300 nm. These values were roughly 5-fold higher and lower than the values for cGK Iα and cGK Iβ, respectively (Fig. 3). This shift in theK a values was also reflected in the accelerated dissociation of cGMP from the high affinity site in most of these chimeras. However, dissociation was never monophasic as observed for chimeras exhibiting the cGK Iβ phenotype. In addition to the effect on the high affinity site, chimeras 10–13 showed also a slight, statistically not significant deceleration of dissociation from the low affinity site. The rate constants of chimera 14 are disconcordant with those of the other chimeras in the group. The K a of 363 nm is probably caused by a decrease in the association rate. These results obtained with different substitutions in S2 and S4 confirmed the observation that only the combined exchange of both domains alter the phenotype from cGK Iα to cGK Iβ and vice versa. Exceptions from the above rule were observed with some chimeras. Chimeras 18 and 19 containing the sequences of cGK Iβ in S2, S5, and S6 also exhibited the low affinity phenotype withK a values of 1 μm, although the sequence of cGK Iα was present in the autoinhibitory domain S4 (Fig.3). The structural basis of this phenomenon was limited to the short linker sequence between S2 and S4. This linker varied in length between cGK Iα and cGK Iβ (Fig. 2). Apparently, the cGK Iα linker exerted this paradoxical effect since it facilitated the expression of the low affinity cGK Iβ phenotype (Fig. 3). In fact, the exchange of the linker sequence from cGK Iα to cGK Iβ decreased 3-fold theK a from 1 μm in chimeras 18 and 19 to about 380 nm in chimeras 12 and 13. These chimeras suggested that the expression of the respective phenotype was strengthened by inserting the linker sequence of the other cGK isozyme. Similar as found for the low affinity cGK Iβ phenotype, chimeras were identified that express the high affinity cGK Iα phenotype without fulfilling the requirements in S2 and S4. Chimera 20 contained the sequence of cGK Iα in S1-S5 and that of cGK Iβ in S6 but exhibited a 6-fold lower K a value than cGK Iα itself (Fig. 3). Even further cGK Iβ substitutions additional to S6 in S1, S2, and S3 (chimera 21) or in S4 (chimera 22) yielded cGK enzymes, which were stimulated at significantly lower cGMP concentrations (p < 0.03) than cGK Iα. Obviously, a specific constellation, i.e. the combination of cGK Iα substitution in S5 and that of cGK Iβ in S6, resulted in a cGK Iα phenotype with increased affinity for cGMP (Fig. 3). The increased affinity of chimera 20 was apparently caused by slowing the dissociation of cGMP from the high affinity site. In contrast, dissociation of cGMP in chimera 21 was accelerated 5-fold instead of being decelerated when compared with cGK Iα. The high affinity of this chimera was due to a faster association rate for cGMP. Whereas association of cGMP included a fast (k +1 ≈ 0.05 min−1·nm−1) and a slow component (k +1 = 0.00042 min−1·nm−1) in the cGK Iα, only the fast component was observed with chimera 21 resulting in equilibrium binding within 30 s after addition of cGMP. Taken together, the combination of cGK Iα substitution in S5 and that of cGK Iβ in S6 enhanced the K a decreasing effect of cGK Iα substitutions in S2 and S4. Even the effect of cGK Iα sequence in one domain alone, either S2 or S4, exceeded that of cGK Iα sequence in both domains as indicated by the significantly lowerK a value of chimera 21 and 22 when compared with theK a of cGK Iα. These results suggest that the flexibility and anchoring function of the hinge domain increased the interaction of S2 and S4 with the cGMP binding domain under the condition described above. This effect was possibly mediated by altering the position of the the amino-terminal domain relative to the other domains in the cGK holoenzyme structure. The contribution of each of the 6 amino-terminal domains, S1–S6, to induce the high affinity cGK Iα phenotype could be best assessed by assigning arbitrary weighting factors to the individual domains of cGK Iα (Fig.5). The weighting factors were obtained by an iterative procedure. The factors for the leucine zipper and the autoinhibitory domain were found to be most influential with values of 0.2 and 0.3, respectively, thereby confirming the importance of these domains for the high affinity cGK Iα phenotype. On the other hand, the individual effect of the extreme amino-terminal sequence (S1) and the second part of the hinge domain (S6) were marginal with factors of 0.9 and 0.8, respectively. The linker sequence (S3) contributed with the factor 1.8 to the phenotype indicating that it acted in a reverse manner,i.e. cGK Iα substitution therein increasedK a 1.8-fold instead of decreasing it. The weighting factors allowed the estimation of the K a values for most of the chimeras constructed with considerable accuracy (Fig. 5). To obtain the K a value of any chimera, theK a value of cGK Iβ (= 1748 nm) was multiplied with the individual factors for S1 to S6 of each cGK Iα and cGK Iβ domain. With three exceptions, the ratio between theK a values predicted and the K avalues actually measured varied between 0.70 and 1.28 with a mean value of 1.03 ± 0.05 suggesting that the factors reliably described the impact of the individual amino-terminal domains on the high affinity cGK Iα phenotype. This arbitrary equation, however, failed to describe the K a decreasing effect of the specific constellation having cGK Iα substitution in S5 and that of cGK Iβ in S6. The specific requirements in S5 and S6 suggested that this effect depended rather on synergistic than on individual contribution of the two domains. This idea was supported by the finding that the reverse substitution, i.e. substitution of cGK Iβ in S5 and that of cGK Iα in S6 did not generate a “super” cGK Iβ enzyme (see chimeras 1, 6, 11, and 15). Thus, the dramaticK a decreasing effect observed with chimeras 20, 21, and 22 could not be covered by the empirical equation. Of the remaining possibilities for permutations, we selected chimeras 23, 24, and 25 to test the validity of the equation. Chimera 23 was constructed to show that also large portions of the cGK Iβ sequence (in this case almost 70%) were able to generate the cGK Iα phenotype when the K a increasing effect of cGK Iβ substitution in S2 was partially neutralized by the reverse effect of cGK Iβ substitution in S3. The K a of 166 nm was similar to that of cGK Iα. In contrast, chimera 10 with cGK Iβ substitutions in S2 but not in S3 had an intermediateK a of 305 nm (Fig. 6). Furthermore, chimera 23 demonstrated that the weighting factors contributed independently to the K a, even when clustered. Chimera 24 was constructed to show that cGK Iβ substitution in S4 alone did not produce an intermediate phenotype when all other domains contained cGK Iα substitutions. This result was exactly predicted by the equation. The replacement of the cGK Iα substitutions in S3 and S1 in this chimera yielded chimera 25. The exchange decreased the K a as expected, although the proportion of cGK Iβ sequence increased. These results demonstrate that the empirical equation can be used to describe the individual impacts of amino-terminal domains on the high affinity cGK Iα phenotype. The present study demonstrates that the leucine zipper and the autoinhibitory domain determine the affinity of cGK Iα and cGK Iβ for cGMP. These results assign a new role for the two domains. Up to now the leucine zipper and the autoinhibitory domain were thought to mediate holoenzyme formation and to inhibit phosphotransferase activity in the absence of cGMP, respectively. The regulatory effect of the leucine zipper (S2) and the autoinhibitory domain (S4) is mediated indirectly, since the primary structure of the binding domains are identical in cGK Iα and cGK Iβ. The indirect effect mainly concerns the binding site which represents the high affinity site in cGK Iα. Recent evidence suggests that this is the amino-terminal site A (27Reed R.B. Sandberg M. Jahnsen T. Lohmann S.M. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17570-17575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The presence of cGK Iα substitutions in S2 and S4 confers high affinity for cGMP to site A, whereas the presence of cGK Iβ substitutions herein confers low affinity to this site. This interpretation is supported by the dissociation rate constants which indicated that the S2 and S4 substitution affected mainly the slow dissociation rate. High affinity binding to site A in cGK Iα depends on cooperative interaction of site A and B (3Ruth P. Landgraf W. Keilbach A. May B. Egleme C. Hofmann F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 1339-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 4Hofmann F. Gensheimer H.P. Göbel C. Eur. J.

The dissociation from site A of cGK Iα obtained by dilution of the cGK/cGMP complex is about 100-fold faster than that observed by addition of an excess of unlabeled cGMP (4Hofmann F. Gensheimer H.P. Göbel C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 147: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For cGK Iβ, however, the rate constants are similar, regardless whether dissociation has been induced by addition of excess unlabeled cGMP or by dilution of the cGK/cGMP complex (3Ruth P. Landgraf W. Keilbach A. May B. Egleme C. Hofmann F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 1339-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). It has therefore been concluded that cooperativity is diminished or even abolished in cGK Iβ. This study identifies S2 and S4 as the sequences that allow cooperativity between the binding site A and B. S2 and S4 enable high cooperativity when derived from cGK Iα and low cooperativity when derived from cGK Iβ as demonstrated by the dissociation kinetics. The involvement of the autoinhibitory domain in regulating cooperativity was postulated previously. Autophosphorylation of the amino terminus of the purified lung cGK (≥90% cGK Iα) decreases the cooperativity between sites A and B by accelerating the dissociation from site A (4Hofmann F. Gensheimer H.P. Göbel C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 147: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 28Doskeland S.O. Vintermyr O.K. Corbin J.D. Ogreid D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3534-3540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of S2 and S4 to affect cooperativity between cGMP binding site A and B implies that these amino-terminal domains have to be included in any structural model of the cGK and its binding domains. Only the conformation of the cGK induced by S2 and S4 results in the appropriate affinity of the cGMP binding sites. The structure of the RIα subunit of cAMP kinase provides evidence that an interdomain hydrophobic interaction region carries out the communication between the cAMP binding domains A and B in the cAMP kinase (30Su Y. Dostmann W.R.G. Herberg F.W. Durick K. Xuong N-h. Ten Eyck L. Taylor S.S. Varughese K.I. Science. 1995; 269: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). This interdomain region allows that structural alterations in domain B, the site that is initially occupied by cAMP during activation of the kinase, are transmitted to site A. This interdomain region is therefore assumed to play a central role in the cooperativity between the two cAMP binding sites in cAMP kinase. Assuming similar tertiary structure of the cyclic nucleotide binding domains in cGK and cAMP kinase, it is conceivable that S2 and S4 interfere with this interdomain region in the cGK, thereby affecting the cooperativity between the binding sites A and B. While the leucine zipper and the autoinhibitory domain control holoenzyme formation and inhibition of catalytic activity individually, synergistic interactions of both domains are required to develop their full regulatory potential on cGMP binding. The involvement of the two domains in regulating affinity for cGMP is intriguing, as both the S2 and S4 domain represent the amino-terminal sequences with highest homology between cGK Iα and cGK Iβ. Thus, the interaction of the amino terminus with the cGMP binding domains is apparently based on a conserved structure. Non-homologous sequences of the cGK Iα and cGK Iβ amino termini are less important for the regulation of binding affinity. For example, the linker sequence (S3) between the leucine zipper and the autoinhibitory domain, which is variable in length between cGK Iα and cGK Iβ, is not crucial for producing the cGK Iα or cGK Iβ phenotype. Moreover, this linker even exerts a reverse effect as it significantly decreases affinity when it derives from cGK Iα and increases affinity when it derives from cGK Iβ. Specific residues in the linker may contribute to this effect. Other non-homologous amino-terminal domains, such as S1 and S6, only negligibly affect the affinity of binding site A. The domain S5, however, which has been regarded as a part of the hinge domain, still exerts a considerable, but less pronounced effect than S2 and S4. Its contribution to the phenotype suggest that it may be attributed structurally and functionally to the preceding autoinhibitory domain. The molecular basis underlying the effect of the leucine zipper and the autoinhibitory domain is unclear at the moment. The nature of their interactions with the binding site may depend on the net charge of the leucine zipper. Both the cGK Iα and cGK Iβ zipper are interspersed with positive and negative amino acid residues. The negative charges predominate in the cGK Iβ zipper and the positive charges in the cGK Iα zipper (Fig. 2). Thus, the electrostatic interactions resulting from a positioning of the zipper near the cGMP binding domain would be different in cGK Iα and cGK Iβ. The leucine zipper is thought to form an α-helix that allows the dimerization of two cGK subunits (2Wolfe L. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4157-4162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,9Landgraf W. Hofmann F. Pelton J.P. Huggins J.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9921-9928Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 10Atkinson R.A. Saudek V. Huggins J.P.

The absolute length of the leucine zipper and, thus, the length of the putative helix are not crucial for the interaction with the binding site, since two additional helical turns provided by S1 of cGK Iβ do only marginally affect the high or low affinity cGK phenotype. The additional need for the autoinhibitory domain (S4) may also be explained by structural interactions. Autoinhibition of cGK Iα is achieved by a substrate-like sequence including the autophosphorylation site -Thr59- (12Aitken A. Hemmings B. Hofmann F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 790: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and that of cGK Iβ is achieved by the autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate sequence -75KRQAI- (31Francis S.H. Smith J.A. Colbran J.L. Grimes K. Walsh K.A. Kumar S. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20748-20755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that this unique features of cGK Iα and cGK Iβ have influence on the interaction between the autoinhibitory and catalytic domain. As both domains are located on the same polypeptide chain, having the cGMP binding domain in between, different interactions between autoinhibitory and catalytic domain also differently affect the structure of the binding pockets. Consequently, the affinity for cGMP may be increased and decreased through the autoinhibitory domains of cGK Iα and cGK Iβ, respectively. The alteration of the primary structure in the various chimeras changed the structural context of the autoinhibitory domain (S4). Nevertheless, all of the chimeras exhibited less than 10% basal activity, regardless whether they contained the S4 from cGK Iα or cGK Iβ. This suggests that both S4 domains included the essential sequence necessary for autoinhibition. Only a cGK Iα deletion mutant, which lacked the sequence Thr59-Thr60-Arg61 of S4 had a 75% basal activity, 2P. Ruth, unpublished results. thereby confirming that the in vitro autophosphorylated Thr59 (12Aitken A. Hemmings B. Hofmann F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 790: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) is essential for autoinhibition of cGK Iα. Thein vitro autophosphorylated Ser64 of cGK Iβ (13Francis S.H. Smith J. Walsh K. Kumar S. Colbran J. Corbin J. FASEB J. 1993; 7: A 1123Google Scholar), however, is apparently not involved in autoinhibition. This site resides in S3 of cGK Iβ and is not present in S3 of cGK Iα. The exchange of S3 from cGK Iβ by that from cGK Iα does not yield a cGK with increased basal activity. Finally, the identification of specific amino acid sequences that regulate the affinity for cGMP may help to find analogues sequences in other cyclic nucleotide regulated proteins. A specific α-helical segment that regulates the affinity of the cGMP binding site has already been characterized in cGMP-regulated ion channels (32Goulding E.H. Tibbs G.R. Siegelbaum S.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This segment shows considerable homology to part of the leucine zipper of the cGK. We thank L. Koblitz and Stefan Beck for technical help."

We have begun to address the cellular function of IGTP by examining its subcellular distribution and its guanine nucleotide binding status. Using immunofluorescence, electron microscopy, and subcellular fractionation, IGTP was localized predominantly to the endoplasmic reticulum of both RAW 264.7 macrophages and C127 fibroblasts. In the immunostaining experiments, staining of discrete cytoplasmic structures on the periphery of the endoplasmic reticulum was also evident.

Given these results, we propose that IGTP is representative of a new family of endoplasmic reticulum GTPases that may be involved in protein processing or trafficking. Interferon γ (IFNγ) 1The abbreviations used are: IFNγ, interferon γ; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GFP, green fluorescent protein; IGTP, inducibly expressed GTPase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; TLC, thin layer chromatography. is a pleiotropic cytokine that regulates a wide variety of immunological and inflammatory responses (for review see Ref. 1Farrar M.A. Screiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 571-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). While production of IFNγ is limited to T cells (2Vilcek J. Gray P.W. Rinderknecht E. Sevastopoulos C.G. Lymphokines. 1985; 11: 1-32Google Scholar) and natural killer cells (3Handa K. Suzuki R. Matsui H. Scimizu Y. Kumagi K. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 988-992PubMed Google Scholar), its receptor is found on almost all cell types where it elicits diverse physiological responses. For example, in endothelial cells, IFNγ increases the expression of major histocompatibility class I molecules and the cell adhesion molecules, ICAM-1 and ELAM-1, thereby promoting recruitment of immune cells to areas of inflammation (4Munro J.M. Pober J.S. Cotran R.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1989; 135: 121-131PubMed Google Scholar). In macrophages, on the other hand, IFNγ induces expression of major histocompatibility class II molecules (5King D.P. Jones P.P. J. Immunol. 1983; 133: 313-318Google Scholar), thus increasing Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis (6Warren M.K. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 2462-2469PubMed Google Scholar) and mediating removal of neoplastic cells and parasitically and virally infected cells (7Liew F.Y. Li Y. Millott S. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 4306-4310PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, IFNγ is thought to be involved in many pathological responses; in multiple sclerosis for instance, its production exacerbates disease symptoms (8Panitch H.S. Heraci R.I. Schindler J. Johnson K.P. Neurology. 1987; 37: 1097Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and increases the relapse rate (9Paty D.W. Li D.K.B. the UBC MS/MRI Study Group the IFNβ Multiple Schlerosis Study Group Neurology. 1993; 43: 662-667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The potent immunomodulating properties of IFNγ have been utilized in a number of cancer treatment regimens that are currently used clinically or are under development. In particular, the interferons in combination with cytotoxic drugs have been quite effective in treating hairy cell leukemia (10Aulitzky W.E. Huber C. Peschel C. Barbacid M. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1993; 101: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (11Kurzrock R. Talpaz M. Kantarjian H.M. Walters R. Saks S. Trujillo J.M. Gutterman J.U. Blood. 1987; 70: 943-947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary results using IFNγ for treatment of renal cell carcinoma (12Brunda M.J. Luistro L. Hendrzak J.A. Fountoulakis M. Garotta G. Gately M.K. J. Immunother. Emphasis Tumor. Immunol. 1995; 17: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), breast carcinoma (13Ozello L. de Rosa C.M. Cantell K. Kauppinen H.L. Habiv D.V. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 839-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), melanoma (14Kim T.S. Xu W.S. Sun T. Cohen E.P. Melanoma Res. 1995; 5: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and glioma (15Lichtor T. Glick R.P. Kim T.S. Hand R. Cohen E.P. J. Neurosurg. 1995; 83: 1038-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) have also been promising. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie these therapeutic effects as well as those underlying the normal physiological responses of IFNγ are poorly understood and are the subject of active investigation. The inducibly expressed GTPase (IGTP) is a recently identified 48-kDa protein whose expression is markedly up-regulated at the transcriptional level by IFNγ. In cultured macrophages and fibroblasts, IGTP mRNA accumulates within 1 h of exposure to IFNγ, reaching peak levels within 3 h and remaining at high levels for at least 48 h (16Taylor G.A. Jeffers M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20399-20405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar); in the mouse, the mRNA is highly expressed in thymus, spleen, small intestine, and lung (16Taylor G.A.

The IGTP protein, which contains three consensus GTP binding motifs, GXXXXGK(S/T), DXXG, and NTKXD (17Dever T.E. Glynias M.J. Merrick W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1814-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), and inherent GTPase activity (16Taylor G.A. Jeffers M. Largaespada D.A. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Vande Woude G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20399-20405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), is representative of an expanding group of closely related, IFNγ-regulated GTPases. Also included in this group of GTPases are the proteins encoded by the IRG-47 (18Gilly M. Wall R. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3275-3281PubMed Google Scholar), TGTP (19Carlow D.A. Marth J. Clark-Lewis I.

Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 58: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) cDNAs. Although their expression patterns imply that they may be important mediators of IFNγ functions, the cellular and physiological functions of these proteins remain unknown. In the studies described here, we have begun to address the cellular function of IGTP by determining its subcellular localization, using a combination of immunostaining, electron microscopy, and subcellular fractionation procedures. We also examined the influence that the GTPase activity of the protein has on its subcellular localization, by first determining the guanine nucleotides complexed to the protein, and then examining the subcellular localization of a mutant protein that could no longer bind GTP. Based on our results, we propose that IGTP is representative of a family of IFNγ-regulated GTPases that localize to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and may be involved in protein processing or trafficking. The plasmid containing the 1.9-kilobase pair mouse IGTP cDNA in a Bluescript cloning vector (pBS) has been described previously (16Taylor G.A. Jeffers M. Largaespada D.A. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Vande Woude G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20399-20405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). pBS/IGTP(S98N) was created by changing codon 98 from TCA to AAC, using a polymerase chain reaction overlapping primer mutagenesis technique (22Ho S.N. Hunt H.P. Horton D.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). pBS/FLAG-IGTP and pBS/FLAG-IGTP(S98N) were created using the polymerase chain reaction to amplify a segment of pBS/IGTP or pBS/IGTP(S98N) so that the sequence encoding the FLAG amino acids DYKDDDDK would be inserted immediately downstream of the ATG start codon. This was accomplished using one primer that flanked the NcoI site at the ATG start codon (5′-GGCGCCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGACGACAAGGATTTAGTCACAAAGTTGCCACAAAATATCTGG-3′) and contained the sequence encoding the FLAG amino acids, and a second primer that flanked the PflMI site 460 bases downstream of the ATG (5′-CGGGCTAAAACAGGATATCAGG-3′); following amplification of this segment, theNcoI-PflMI-digested product was subcloned intoNcoI-PflMI-digested pBS/IGTP. The products were sequenced to verify the insertion. The FLAG-IGTP and FLAG-IGTP(S98N) SV40 promoter expression vectors were created by cloning the SpeI-EcoRI fragments of pBS/FLAG-IGTP and pBS/FLAG-IGTP(S98N) into theSpeI-EcoRI site of pSVZeo (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The plasmids encoding IGTP and IGTP(S98N) fused at their C termini to green fluorescent protein (GFP) were created using the polymerase chain reaction to amplify the coding regions of IGTP and IGTP(S98N) with primers (5′-AAAGCTAGCCGATTTAGTCACAAGTTGCCACAAAATATC-3′ and 5′-AAAGCTTAGCGTGAATTTCGGGAGGGAGGACAGAGTCCTT-3′) that containedNheI restriction sites. The NheI-digested products were then subcloned into the NheI site of pFRED25, 2G. Gaitanaris, R. Stauber, and G. Pavlakis, manuscript in preparation. a GFP expression plasmid containing a cytomegalovirus promoter and the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal. RAW 264.7 cells (ATCC TIB-71, American Type Culture Collection), C127 cells (ATCC CRL-1616), HeLa cells (ATCC CCL-2), and NIH/3T3 cells (ATCC CRL 1658) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies), 0.292 mg/ml l-glutamine (Life Technologies), 100 units/ml penicillin (Life Technologies), and 100 units/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies). For transient expression assays, plasmids were introduced into cells using a standard calcium phosphate transfection method (23Taylor G.A. Thompson M.J. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13341-13347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). For cells grown on 100-mm culture dishes, 20 μg of plasmid DNA was precipitated in 1 ml of calcium phosphate solution that was then added to 10 ml of culture medium; for culture dishes of different sizes, the amount of DNA used and the volume of the calcium phosphate solution was changed proportionally. C127 cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated, four-well glass chamber slides (12-550-51 SuperCell culture slides; Fisher), until they reached about 50% confluency. Some cells were then exposed for 4 h to 100 units/ml mouse interferon γ (Boehringer Mannheim) that was added directly to the growth medium. The cells were fixed with 4% (v/v) formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, and blocked with 10% (v/v) goat serum, 0.1% (v/v) polyxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate (Tween 20) in PBS for 1 h. The cells were then incubated for 30 min with affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-IGTP (16Taylor G.A. Jeffers M. Largaespada D.A. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Vande Woude G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20399-20405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) diluted to 10 μg/ml in blocking solution, followed by an additional 30-min incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody diluted to 1:1000 in blocking solution (Boehringer Mannheim); between all incubation steps, the cells were washed several times with PBS. After they were mounted, the cells were observed and the images were analyzed using a Zeiss LSM310 confocal laser-scanning microscope; the microscope was configured with a 25-milliwatt argon, internal HeNe laser with the appropriate line (488) for fluorescein isothiocyanate excitation. Normaski images were made using the 543 green laser and appropriate polarizer lenses. Photographs were taken using a Sony color video printer UP5200 MD Mavigraph, Focus Graphics 4700. C127 and RAW cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (v/v) and 0.25% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Following four 20-min washes with PBS, the cells were dehydrated in a series of graded ethanol solutions and embedded in LR White waterphilia resin and polymerized at 48 °C. Thin sections were then cut in LKB Nova and lifted with formvar-coated 200 mesh gold grids. The sections were washed three times with PBS for 10 min each, incubated in 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min, and then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with an affinity-purified anti-Grp78 antibody (PA1–014, Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO) previously conjugated with 5-nm gold particles. Next, following four 20-min washes with PBS and one 30-min incubation with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS, the cells were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with the affinity-purified anti-IGTP antibody (16Taylor G.A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20399-20405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) previously conjugated with 10-nm gold particles. Following the second incubation, the cells were washed four times with PBS for 20 min each, two times with water for 10 min each, and then stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate for 4 min. Control cells were stained with a 5-nm colloidal gold solution without the primary antibody to ensure that background staining was low. Sections were observed and images were recorded with a Philips EM 410 transmission electron microscope. Membrane protein fractions were isolated from RAW 264.7 and C127 cells using a previously established sucrose step gradient fractionation method (24Vidugiriene J. Menon A.K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). All steps of the procedure were performed at 4 °C, and 0.06 μg/ml aprotinin and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin were added to all buffers. In brief, the cells were rinsed three times with PBS, dislodged from the culture dishes by gentle scraping with plastic cells scrapers, and then pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g and 4 °C for 5 min. The cells were gently resuspended in about 20 ml of a hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2) and pelleted at 500 × g for 5 min. Next, the cells were resuspended in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer and incubated on ice for 5 min. The plasma membranes of the cells were broken with 20–25 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer; the integrity of the plasma membrane was monitored by light microscopy. The lysate was then cleared of nuclei by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer and subjected to 10 strokes with a Dounce homogenizer; the nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g, the nuclear pellet was discarded, and the 1000 × g supernatant was combined with the other 1000 × g supernatant. 50% (w/v) sucrose was added to the combined supernatants to a final concentration of 8.5%, and this solution was centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 15 min. The 10,000 × g supernatant was carefully layered on a sucrose step gradient of 0.6-ml layers of 20, 30, and 38% (w/v) sucrose solutions, prepared in hypotonic buffer; the gradient was ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C in an SW60 rotor (Beckman, Sunnyvale, CA). Fractions were then isolated as described under “Results,” and the amount of protein in each fraction was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay system. Immunoprecipitation, protein gel electrophoresis, and Western blotting were performed as described previously (16Taylor G.A. Jeffers M. Largaespada D.A. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Vande Woude G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20399-20405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The anti-IGTP rabbit polyclonal antiserum (16Taylor G.A. Jeffers M. Largaespada D.A.

The mouse monoclonal M2 anti-FLAG antibody (Kodak, New Haven, CT) was used at 20 μg/ml for immunoprecipitation. The goat peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Boehringer Mannheim) was used at a 1:10,000 dilution for Western blotting. The ECL detection system (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) was used for Western blot detection. Cell lysates were prepared, protein was immunoprecipitated (16Taylor G.A. Jeffers M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20399-20405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and the complexed guanine nucleotides were separated by polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer chromatography according to previously described methods (25Gibbs J.B. Marshall M.S. Scolnick E.M. Dixon R.A.F. Vogel U.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20437-20442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A buffer of 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.15m NaCl, 0.02 m MgCl2, 0.06 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin was used for cell lysis, and a 1:100 dilution of the anti-IGTP antiserum (16Taylor G.A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20399-20405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) was used for immunoprecipitation. A control sample of [α-32P]GTP was hydrolyzed in vitro with immunoprecipitated IGTP, as described previously (16Taylor G.A. Jeffers M. Largaespada D.A. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Vande Woude G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20399-20405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), to produce [α-32P]GTP and [α-32P]GDP; this was used, in addition to the fluorescent indicator in the TLC plates, to determine the position of GTP and GDP on the TLC plates. Radiolabeled GTP and GDP were quantitated with a BAS 1000 (Fuji, Stamford, CT) phosphor imager. Cells were seeded onto 60-mm dishes and transfected with pFRED/IGTP and pFRED/IGTP(S98N). 24 h after transfection, the cells were analyzed using a Zeiss LSM 410 Micro System microscope in the confocal mode, with an argon laser line set at 488 nm. To determine the subcellular distribution of IGTP, C127 mouse fibroblasts were exposed to control conditions or to 100 units/ml IFNγ for 4 h to induce expression of the protein, and the cells were used for immunostaining with an anti-IGTP antibody (Fig. 1); this rabbit polyclonal antibody had been raised against the 16 C-terminal amino acids of IGTP and previously was shown to identify a dominant IFNγ-inducible 48-kDa band in both immunoprecipitation and Western blotting experiments (16Taylor G.A. Jeffers M. Largaespada D.A. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Vande Woude G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20399-20405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In C127 cells, immunostaining was localized to the cytoplasm and was concentrated in the perinuclear region on discrete, somewhat globular structures (Fig. 1), a pattern typical of nuclear envelope/ER localization. The overall staining pattern was similar in control and IFNγ-stimulated cells and became more intense following IFNγ treatment, probably as a result of increased IGTP protein synthesis (Fig. 1). Essentially the same staining pattern was obtained when IFNγ-stimulated RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages were stained with the anti-IGTP antibody (data not shown). These results suggested that IGTP was localized to the ER in these cells and, in addition, that IFNγ affected only the quantity of IGTP present and not the subcellular distribution. The localization of IGTP in IFNγ-stimulated C127 and RAW cells was also examined by electron microscopy using the anti-IGTP antibody and an antibody that recognized Grp78 (BiP), a resident ER protein (26Green J.M. Gu L. Ifkovits C. Kaumaya P.T.P. Conrad S. Pierce S.K. Hybridoma. 1995; 14: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In both RAW cells (Fig. 2) and C127 cells (data not shown), IGTP and Grp78 immunoreactivity showed extensive colocalization on ER membranes. In certain cases, the IGTP antibody stained large globular structures whose identity could not be determined (data not shown; see also Fig. 7). These structures seemed too large to be cross-sections of the ER; it is possible that they were vesicles that had budded off of the ER.Figure 7Localization of IGTP-GFP and IGTP(S98N)-GFP in HeLa cells. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with an IGTP-GFP or IGTP(S98N)-GFP expression vector. 24 h after transfection, the living cells were analyzed for protein expression, using a Zeiss LSM 410 microscope in the confocal mode, with the argon laser line at 488 nm. Shown are two representative groups of cells for each expressed protein. Note that the GFP fusion protein staining pattern is identical to the immunocytochemistry staining pattern of the endogenous protein in fixed cells (Fig. 1). Also note the globular pattern clearly evident in the living cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The subcellular distribution of IGTP was also examined biochemically by isolating plasma, Golgi, and ER membrane protein fractions from IFNγ-stimulated RAW cells, using a previously established sucrose step gradient system (24Vidugiriene J. Menon A.K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). A cytosolic cell lysate was prepared from IFNγ-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells in a buffer containing 8.5% (w/v) sucrose, and this solution was layered on steps of 20, 30, and 38% sucrose and centrifuged at 100,000 × g. Five fractions were collected from the top of the gradient, with fractions 1 and 2 coming from the 8.5% sucrose layer, fraction 3 from the combined 20 and 30% layers, fraction 4 from the 38% layer, and fraction 5 from the pellet. It has been shown previously using biochemical markers, that for fractions isolated in this manner, fractions 1 and 2 contain mainly soluble cytosolic and plasma membrane protein, fraction 3 contains Golgi protein, and fractions 4 and 5 contain ER protein (24Vidugiriene J. Menon A.K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). For the present study, each fraction was subjected to Western blotting with the anti-IGTP antibody and control antibodies that recognized the Golgi protein β-COP and the endoplasmic reticulum protein Grp78 (BiP); as expected, β-COP was detected mainly in fraction 3, and Grp78 was detected mainly in fractions 4 and 5 (Fig. 3). IGTP was present predominantly in fraction 5, with lesser amounts in fraction 4, only a trace in fraction 3, and none detectable in fractions 1 and 2 (Fig. 3). In similar experiments using IFNγ-stimulated C127 fibroblasts, IGTP showed the same distribution profile (data not shown). These results supported those of the immunostaining experiments and suggested that the majority of IGTP in macrophages and fibroblasts was not present in the soluble cytosolic pool but was bound to the endoplasmic reticulum. IGTP association with the ER raised the possibility that the protein could have been secreted from these cells. This seemed unlikely, given the lack of a signal sequence at the IGTP N terminus (16Taylor G.A. Jeffers M. Largaespada D.A. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Vande Woude G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20399-20405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the very small amounts of IGTP detected in Golgi protein fractions (Fig.2 B), and the lack of immunodetectable IGTP near the cell periphery (Fig. 1). However, the possibility was addressed by Western blotting of protein isolated from the culture medium of RAW cells exposed to IFNγ for up to 24 h (data not shown). Although IGTP was readily detected in RAW cell lysates, no secreted IGTP was detected in the cell culture medium (data not shown). Previously, IGTP was shown to contain GTP binding motifs, as well as GTPase activity (16Taylor G.A. Jeffers M. Largaespada D.A. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Vande Woude G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20399-20405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar); however, the distribution of guanine nucleotides that were complexed to the protein in vivo was not determined. To address the guanine nucleotide binding status of IGTP, anti-IGTP antibodies were used to precipitate protein from RAW cells exposed to IFNγ or control conditions, and the nucleotides that were complexed to precipitated protein were then separated by thin layer chromatography (Fig.4). Under control conditions, 90.0 ± 5.2% (S.D.) of the detectable guanine nucleotides complexed to IGTP were GTP, and the remaining 10% were GDP (Fig. 4). Following IFNγ exposure, although the total amount of detected guanine nucleotides increased along with the amount of immunodetectable IGTP protein (Fig. 4 and data shown), the overall percentage of GTP complexed to IGTP remained about the same at 93.8 ± 0.9% (S.D.). Because many GTP-binding proteins, such as Ras (27Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779Crossref PubMed Scopus (3783) Google Scholar), are in an active conformation when they are in the GTP-complexed state, these results suggested that the majority of IGTP in these cells was in an active state and, further, that IFNγ did not influence the steady-state activity of the protein. As a control experiment, lysates were prepared from asynchronous NIH/3T3 cells, and the guanine nucleotides bound to immunoprecipitated Ras were also determined using thin layer chromatography (data not shown). About 82% of the Ras-complexed guanine nucleotides were GDP, which was in agreement with previously published results (25Gibbs J.B. Marshall M.S. Scolnick E.M. Dixon R.A.F. Vogel U.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20437-20442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This demonstrated that GDP was easily detected under the assay conditions, and it suggested that detection of low levels of GDP-bound IGTP was not a consequence of inappropriate experimental conditions. There are numerous ways in which the GTP binding status of IGTP could influence its function; one possibility is that the affinity of IGTP for the ER might be regulated by its GTP binding state. Such is true of the Rab GTPases, which are recruited onto membrane vesicles when in the GTP-complexed state (for review, see Ref.28Pfeffer S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of perturbing the GTP binding of IGTP, a mutant IGTP protein was created by mutating serine 98 in the first GTP binding motif (GDSGNGMS) to an asparagine (GDSGNGMN); in the case of the Ras GTPase, the analogous serine is involved in contacting the Mg2+cofactor (29Pai E.F. Kabsch W. Krengel U. Holmes K. John J. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1989; 341: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), and mutation to an asparagine yields a protein with a greatly reduced affinity for GTP (30Feig L.A. Pan B.-T. Roberts T.M.

A FLAG amino acid tag (DYKDDDDK) was also placed at the amino terminus of the mutant IGTP(S98N) protein so that exogenously expressed protein could be distinguished from the endogenous protein. To characterize the GTP binding properties of FLAG-IGTP and FLAG-IGTP(S98N), the two proteins were transiently expressed in NIH/3T3 cells, protein was immunoprecipitated with the anti-IGTP antibody, and the complexed guanine nucleotides were separated by thin layer chromatography (Fig. 5). For FLAG-IGTP, the guanine nucleotide distribution paralleled that of the endogenous protein (Fig. 4), with 96% of the detected guanine nucleotides being GTP and the remaining 4% GDP (Fig. 5 and data not shown); the small amounts of GDP were evident only after long exposure of the TLC plate to film, but they were easily detectable with a phosphor imager (data not shown). Conversely, while small amounts of GDP were also detected complexed to FLAG-IGTP(S98N) (data not shown), no GTP above background levels was detected (Fig. 5). Similar results were obtained when the FLAG-IGTP and FLAG-IGTP(S98N) were transfected into HeLa cells (data not shown), and in all cases, levels of expressed FLAG-IGTP and FLAG-IGTP(S98N) protein were approximately the same (Fig.6 and data not shown). Analogous experiments were performed using an anti-FLAG antibody to immunoprecipitate protein, and in these studies, the detected amounts of GTP and GDP complexed to FLAG-IGTP and FLAG-IGTP(S98N) were essentially the same as those detected using the anti-IGTP antibody (data not shown).Figure 6Distribution of FLAG-IGTP and FLAG-IGTP(S98N) in subcellular fractions. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with a FLAG-IGTP or FLAG-IGTP(S98N) expression vector and then used for preparation of subcellular fractions as described in the legend to Fig.3. Equal amounts of protein from each fraction were used for sequential immunoprecipitation with an M2 anti-FLAG antibody and Western blotting with the anti-IGTP antibody. The position of the 50-kDa molecular weight marker is shown at the left. Other details are described under “Results.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine if the S98N mutation affected IGTP localization to the ER, FLAG-IGTP and FLAG-IGTP(S98N) were transiently expressed in HeLa cells, membrane protein fractions were isolated, and the expressed proteins were detected by immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG antibody and Western blotting with anti-IGTP antibody (Fig. 6). Both FLAG-IGTP and FLAG-IGTP(S98N) were detected almost exclusively in fraction 5, with very small amounts present in fraction 4. These results indicated that greatly reducing the GTP complexed to IGTP had no effect on targeting the protein to the ER; however, they did not rule out that smaller movements within the ER compartment are influenced by GTP. With long exposures of the Western blot, faint bands that migrated slightly more rapidly than FLAG-IGTP and FLAG-IGTP(S98N) were also detected in fraction 5 (Fig. 6 and data not shown). The identity of these bands was not determined; they may have been wild-type IGTP that lacked the 9.9-kDa FLAG epitope and was co-precipitated with FLAG-IGTP, or alternatively, they may have been unrelated co-precipitated bands that were recognized by the anti-IGTP blotting antibody. The localization of IGTP(S98N) was also examined in intact, living cells by transiently expressing IGTP-green fluorescent protein (IGTP-GFP) fusion proteins in HeLa cells (Fig. 7). The IGTP-GFP and IGTP(S98N)-GFP fluorescence patterns (Fig. 7) were very similar to the immunostaining pattern of the endogenous IGTP protein (Fig. 1), with strong perinuclear staining that radiated out into the cytosol but did not extend completely to the cell membrane. Along the periphery of the ER, distinct, globular structures also showed strong staining for both IGTP-GFP and IGTP(S98N)-GFP. The nature of the globular structures could not be determined; they may have been cross-sections of ER membranes or perhaps portions of the ER that were budding off. These results again suggested that GTP-binding did not affect localization of IGTP to the ER. Other experiments were performed that addressed the effect of complexed guanine nucleotides on the binding of IGTP to ER membranes. In one experiment, in vitro translated IGTP was preloaded with GDP, GTP, or GTPγS and then incubated with purified ER membranes, either in the presence of Mg2+ so that the IGTP GTPase would be active, or in the presence of EDTA so that the GTPase would be inactive. Buffer conditions were chosen in which the association of other proteins with purified membranes, such as the association of AP-1 with Golgi membranes (31Traub L.M. Ostrom J.A. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), had been successfully studied in vitro previously. However, under each assay condition, the amount of IGTP that bound to the membranes remained essentially the same (data not shown). In a second experiment, IFNγ-stimulated RAW cells were used for purification of ER membranes that were thus loaded with endogenous IGTP; the membranes were then incubated in buffers containing GTP, GDP, or GTPγS and either Mg2+ or EDTA. Again, under none of the experimental conditions was IGTP released from the membranes (data not shown). Taken together, these results support the above finding that binding of IGTP to ER membranes is not regulated by complexed GTP. Using a combination of immunocytochemical and cellular fractionation methods, we have shown that the majority of IGTP in macrophages and fibroblasts is bound to the endoplasmic reticulum, and very little is present in the soluble cytosolic protein pool. In addition, the protein is predominantly GTP-bound and, consequently, is probably in an active state. However, it does not appear that complexing with GTP regulates IGTP's association with the ER in general, although our data do not rule out that GTP-binding could regulate small movements of the protein within the ER compartment. Based on these findings, we propose that IGTP is representative of a new family of ER GTPases that potentially could be involved in protein processing or trafficking. The nature of the association of IGTP with the endoplasmic reticulum still remains to be addressed experimentally. Many resident ER proteins, such as Grp78, contain a C-terminal KDEL sequence that is necessary and sufficient for their retention in the ER (32Pelham H.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), yet IGTP lacks this sequence. Binding of endogenous IGTP to ER membranes can be completely disrupted with nonionic detergents and partially disrupted with 1.5 m potassium acetate (data not shown), the latter of which suggests that protein-protein interactions may mediate the association. However, an alternative possibility is that IGTP is covalently modified with a lipid moiety, such as a myristoyl or prenyl group, that mediates binding of the protein to the membrane. Because IGTP lacks both a C-terminal CAAX prenylation sequence (33Hancock J.F. Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1167-1177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar) and an N-terminal myristoylation sequence (MGXXX(S/A/T)) (34Towler D.A. Adams S.R. Eubanks S.R. Towery D.S. Jackson-Machelski E. Glaser L. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1784-1790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the nature of a possible lipid moiety is not apparent. In the IGTP-GFP fusion protein studies and also in the immunocytochemical electron microscopy studies, we observed distinct globular structures that were positive for IGTP, but the nature of these structures could not be determined. Because they were located on the periphery of the ER, one possibility is that they were vesicular structures that had budded off of the ER and were perhaps involved in membrane transport from the ER to the Golgi or to some other cellular location. If this were the case, then the lack of substantial amounts of IGTP in the Golgi and plasma membrane fractions suggests that IGTP dissociates rapidly from these putative vesicles once they reach their destination. Characterization of these structures will be important in determining the function of IGTP. There are many families of GTPases that associate with the ER or Golgi and are involved in protein processing or trafficking. Included in these proteins are the RAB proteins, a group of over 30 small GTPases that are recruited onto nascent transport vesicles and target them to their appropriate membrane acceptors (28Pfeffer S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), and the ADP-ribosylation factors, a group of at least 13 Ras-related proteins that regulate reversible binding of coat proteins to Golgi membranes (for review, see Ref. 35Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). These proteins, however, are smaller than IGTP and bear no primary sequence homology to it. One GTPase that does bear limited homology to IGTP is SRP54, the 54-kDa subunit of the signal recognition particle that targets ribosomes with a signal sequence to the ER (36Walter P. Johnson A.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 87-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar); it is 43% similar to IGTP at the amino acid level, including a methionine-rich area near the carboxyl terminus. Future studies should focus on whether SRP54 has a function similar to that of IGTP or whether IGTP and its relatives comprise a distinct class of protein-processing and -trafficking GTPases.

In this study, we characterize the RTR response elements by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay/polymerase chain reaction-based, DNA binding site selection strategy. RTR binds with the greatest affinity to response elements containing TCA(AG(G/T)TCA)2 (consensus RTR response element; conRTRE), to which it binds as a homodimer. RTR is also able to bind as a monomer to a single core motif TCAAG(G/T)TCA, albeit with a lower affinity. Mutation analysis supports the specific requirements of the 5′-flanking sequence and the core motif of the RTRE for optimal binding of RTR. An RTR-specific antiserum (RTR-Ab2) was raised that causes supershift of the RTR-conRTRE complex in EMSA. Based on the sequence of the conRTRE, we located a putative RTRE, referred to as P2-RE, in the 5′ promoter-flanking region of the mouse protamine 2 gene, which is induced during the same stage of spermatogenesis as RTR. The ability of RTR-Ab2 to cause a supershift of an RTR-RTRE complex with nuclear extracts from different tissues correlated with the tissue- and development-specific expression of RTR. Transfection of RTR in CV-1 cells was unable to cause RTRE-dependent transactivation of a CAT reporter gene; however, an RTR-VP16 fusion protein could induce transactivation through several RTREs, including P2-RE.

The DNA-binding domain is the most conserved among the nuclear receptors and is composed of two “zinc finger” motifs that play a role in DNA recognition and protein-protein interactions (10Carlstedt-Duke J.

The ligand-binding domain at the C terminus is involved in several functions including ligand binding, receptor dimerization, nuclear translocation, and transcriptional activation (11Fawell S.E.

The functions of the N-terminal region and the hinge domain that separates the DNA-binding and ligand-binding domains are still poorly understood. Recent studies have indicated that in certain instances the amino-terminal domain contains a transactivation function (17Nagpal S. Saunders M. Kastner P. Durand B. Nakshatri H. Chambon P. Cell. 1992; 70: 1007-1019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) and that the hinge domain contain sites that interact with co-repressors (18Hörlein A.J. Näär A.M. Heinzel T.

Cooney A.J. Wang Y. Law S.W. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1434-1444PubMed Google Scholar). This orphan receptor is highly expressed in the testis and in particular in round spermatids (27Hirose T. O'Brien D.A. Jetten A.M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 152: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that GCNF/RTR functions as an important transcriptional factor in the regulation of gene expression during a very specific stage of spermatogenesis. In this study, we have analyzed the characteristics of the RTR response element (RTRE) more precisely by a DNA binding site selection strategy that is based on a combination of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and by mutation analysis. Based on the consensus RTRE sequence obtained, we located a putative RTR response element (P2-RE) in the 5′ promoter-flanking region of the mouse protamine 2 gene that is induced at the same stage of spermatogenesis as GCNF/RTR (29Eddy E.M. Welch J.E. O'Brien D.A. de Kretser D. Molecular Biology of the Male Reproductive System. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1993: 181-231Google Scholar, 30Johnson P.A. Peschon J.J. Yelick P.C. Palmiter R.D. Hecht N.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 950: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and demonstrated that GCNF/RTR specifically interacts with this DNA sequence. We provide evidence showing that GCNF/RTR can mediate transactivation of a reporter gene through either the consensus RTRE or P2-RE. These results suggest that the protamine 2 gene may belong to a subset of genes that are regulated by GCNF/RTR during the postmeiotic phase of spermatogenesis. The plasmid pBSK-RTR containing the full-length mouse RTR cDNA in pBluescript II SK(−/+) (Stratagene) has been described (27Hirose T. O'Brien D.A. Jetten A.M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 152: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The expression construct pZeoSV-RTR was made by inserting the XbaI-KpnI fragment into theSpeI-KpnI site of the pZeoSV vector (Invitrogen). The plasmid pGEM3Z-RTR, which was used for in vitrotranslation of RTR, was created by inserting theXbaI-KpnI fragment of pBSK-RTR containing the full-length RTR into the expression vector pGEM3Z (Promega). The CAT reporter gene constructs were created by inserting three copies of the consensus RTRE (conRTRE) (TCAAGGTCAAGGTCATAA)3, the half-site RTRE (GGAATCAAGGTCATCT)3, P2-RE (TAGAAGTTCAAGGTCATTC)2TAGAAGTTCAAGGTCAT or a single copy of conRTRE into the HindIII andBamHI sites of pBLCAT5 (31Boshart M. Klüppel M. Schmidt A. Schütz G. Luckow B. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 129-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) to create the reporter plasmids of (conRTRE)3-CAT, (1/2-RTRE)3-CAT, (P2RE)3-CAT, and (conRTRE)1-CAT. The pSG5-VP16-RTR chimeric expression plasmid that encodes a fusion protein consisting of the VP16 activation domain and the full-length coding region of the RTR was created as follows. pGEM3Z-RTR was cut first withEclXI and XhoI enzymes to obtain the full-length RTR fragment, which was then inserted into the Bsp120 I andXhoI sites of pBluescript II SK to create pBSK-RTR-2. pSG5-VP16-RTR was obtained by inserting theKpnI-XhoI fragment of pBSK-RTR-2 into the same sites of pSG5-VP16. The pSG5-VP16 plasmid was obtained from Dr. J. Lehmann (Glaxo-Wellcome) and described previously (32Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3469) Google Scholar). Expression of fusion proteins VP16-RTR was verified by in vitrotranslation and its subsequent characterization by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and EMSA. pGEM3Z-RTR406, which encodes an RTR truncated at amino acid 406, was created by inserting stop codons at the NsiI site. A peptide DSDHSSPGNRASESNQPSC (RTR-pep2) encoding amino acids 189–206 of RTR was synthesized and cross-linked via maleimide to KLH using the Imject kit from Pierce. The antigen was mixed 1:1 with Freund's adjuvant and injected subcutaneously into New Zealand White rabbits as described (33Marvin K.W. George M.D. Fujimoto W. Saunders N.A. Bernacki S.H. Jetten A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11026-11030Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Immunization boosts were given every 4 weeks. Antisera were tested by immunoprecipitation using protein A-agarose as described (33Marvin K.W. George M.D. Fujimoto W. Saunders N.A. Bernacki S.H. Jetten A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nuclear extracts from brain, kidney, testis, and liver of 3-month-old CD-1 mice were prepared as described (34Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar, 35Tamura T.-A. Aoyama A. Inoue T. Miura M. Okano H. Mikoshiba K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3122-3126Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts from juvenile mice at day 17 after birth were also prepared. The SP6 RNA-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) was used to synthesize RTR protein. Oligonucleotide probes for EMSA were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). Approximately 0.2–0.5 ng (50,000 cpm) of the probe was used in a binding reaction with 2 μl of RTR programmed reticulocyte lysate or 1–2 μl of nuclear extract (10–20 μg of protein) in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol. To prevent nonspecific binding, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 1 μg of salmon sperm DNA, and 0.5 μg of nonspecific oligonucleotide were included in the reaction buffer. The programmed lysates/nuclear extracts were first incubated with reaction buffer for 10 min at room temperature and then in the presence of the radiolabeled probe with or without competitor for 30 min. As a control, probes were incubated with the same amount of unprogrammed lysate. For supershift assays, 1 μl of RTR-Ab2 (1:200 final dilution) was preincubated with the in vitro-translated RTR for 30 min at room temperature prior to the addition of radiolabeled probe. The RTR-nucleotide complexes were separated on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (National Diagnostics) containing 0.5 × TBE. To select for the DNA binding sites of RTR, a similar procedure was used as reported previously (21Giguère V. Tini M.,. Flock G. Ong E. Evans R.M. Otulakowski G. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 538-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). A mixture of 70-bp DNA fragments was synthesized by PCR using the random oligomer 5′-CGCGGATCCTGCAGCTCGAGN30GTCGACAAGCTTCTAGAGCA-3′ as a template and 5′-CGCGGATCCTGCAGCTCGAG-3′ (primer 1) and 5′-TGCTCTAGAAGCTTGTCGAC-3′ (primer 2) as the forward and reverse primers, respectively. In a separate selection, the oligomer 5′-CGCGGATCCTGCAGCTCGAGN7GGTCAAGGTCAN7GTCGACAAGCTTCTAGAGCA-3′ was used as template. The PCR amplification was carried out using 20 pmol of oligomer, 100 pmol of 32P-end-labeled forward primer, and 100 pmol of reverse primer for three cycles under the following conditions: 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C for each cycle. The double-stranded mixed DNA fragments generated were purified and incubated with in vitrosynthesized RTR, and complexes were analyzed by EMSA. A band corresponding to the RTR-RTRE complex was excised, and the DNA was eluted in TE buffer. Recovered DNA was amplified by PCR for 15 cycles and used for EMSA analysis with RTR under the conditions described above. This procedure was repeated four times. In the fifth round, PCR products were cloned into TA vector (Invitrogen). The inserts from individual white colonies were amplified and used as competitors in EMSA. DNA that competed in EMSA effectively was subjected to sequence analysis. The sequences of 37 independent clones were analyzed. CV-1 cells were plated in 6-well dishes containing minimal essential medium and 10% fetal bovine serum. The next day, cells were transfected in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) with the expression vector pSG5-VP16-RTR or pZeoSV-RTR and pBL-tk-CAT reporter DNA under the control of various response elements using lipofectamine (Life Technologies) as described (19Hirose T. Apfel R. Pfahl M. Jetten A.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 23Medvedev A. Yan Z-H. Hirose T. Giguère V. Jetten A.M. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 181: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The plasmid β-actin-LUC was used as an internal control to correct for differences in transfection efficiency. The reporter constructs used were (conRTRE)3CAT, (1/2-RTRE)3-CAT, (P2-RE)3-CAT, and (conRTRE)1-CAT. Cells were collected 48 h after transfection, and CAT activity was determined with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Boehringer Mannheim) following the manufacturer's instructions. The amino acid sequence in the C-terminal region of the first zinc finger of nuclear receptors is key in classifying their DNA binding specificity (11Fawell S.E. Lees J.A. White R. Parker M.G. Cell. 1990; 60: 953-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 12Freedman L.P. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 129-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 14Glass C.K. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 391-407PubMed Google Scholar). In RTR, this sequence is CEGCKG, suggesting that RTR, like the retinoid, thyroid hormone, vitamin D, and peroxisome proliferator activating receptors, recognizes response elements containing the consensus core motif AGGTCA (2Giguère V. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 61-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Glass C.K. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 391-407PubMed Google Scholar, 16Truss M. Beato M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 459-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). On this basis, we screened a series of well characterized natural and synthetic response elements that contain the consensus core motif RGGTCA configured either as a direct repeat, palindrome, or inverted palindrome spaced by different numbers of nucleotides for RTR binding. These results showed that RTR was able to bind to a DR0 sequence (not shown). To determine in an unbiased manner the consensus sequence of the response element that binds RTR with high affinity (RTRE), we used a DNA-binding site selection strategy that is based on a combination of PCR and EMSA. A mixture of 70-bp oligonucleotides containing 30 random nucleotides flanked by two 20-bp primers was used as template (see “Experimental Procedures”; Fig. 1 A). After four rounds of selection with in vitro synthesized RTR protein, a strong radiolabeled band consisting of RTR-oligonucleotide complexes was observed in EMSA. The PCR products generated after the fourth selection were cloned into the TA vector, and the sequence of 37 independent clones was analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1 A). From these sequences the percentage of A, G, T, and C at each position was calculated, and the RTRE consensus sequence was derived (Fig. 1 B). These data demonstrated that RTR bound most effectively to a DR0 consisting of a direct repeat of the core motif AG(G/T)TCA. In addition, these results showed that a DR0 preceded by TCA (−9 to −7 position) was preferred for high affinity binding, indicating that the 5′-flanking region rather than the 3′-flanking region is important for optimal binding of RTR. The −10 position did not reveal a strong requirement for a particular nucleotide. In a second DNA binding site selection experiment, a mixture of 65-bp oligomers consisting of 5′-CGCGGATCCTGCAGCTCGAGN7GGTCAAGGTCAN7GTCGACAAGCTTCTAGAGCA-3′ was used as template. This experiment yielded the consensus sequence NNTCAA GGTCAAGGTCA and confirmed that TCA in positions −9 to −7 is necessary for optimal binding of RTR. Based on the sequence analysis above, we synthesized the consensus RTR response element GGAATCAAGGTCAAGGTCATCTAAT (conRTRE) (Fig.2 A) and analyzed its binding to RTR in EMSAs. As shown in Fig. 2 B, in vitro translated RTR formed a complex with conRTRE, while increasing concentrations of the unlabeled conRTRE competed effectively for the binding. Since conRTRE consists of two overlapping TCAAGGTCA motifs, we next determined whether RTR was able to bind to a single core motif (M3-RTRE) consisting of the conRTRE in which the upstream half-site was destroyed by mutating three different nucleotides (Fig. 2 A). Although this single core motif RTRE did compete with 32P-conRTRE for RTR binding, it was not as effective as the conRTRE (Fig.2 B). These observations suggest that RTR can bind well to an RTRE containing one core motif but does so with a lower affinity than to an RTRE consisting of a DR0. A DR1-RTRE, identical to conRTRE except that the two core motifs are separated by one nucleotide and a P0-RTRE containing a palindromic repeat of the core motif (Fig. 2 A), also did not compete as well for binding as the conRTRE (Fig.2 B). It is likely that the binding of RTR to DR1-RTRE and P0-RTRE takes place through interaction with the single motif TCAAGGTCA present in these elements. The apparent lower affinity of M3-RTRE, DR1-RTRE, and P0-RTRE for RTR is in agreement with the results obtained in Fig. 1, demonstrating that a DR0 is most optimal for RTR binding. In addition, these results suggest that RTR very likely binds to DR0 as a homodimer and as a monomer to the single motif TCAAGGTCA. The hypothesis that RTR binds as a homodimer to conRTRE was further investigated by analyzing the binding of the full-length RTR and RTR406, a truncated form of RTR. EMSA with either RTR or RTR406 yielded one single shifted band that migrated at different positions. We then performed EMSA using a mixture of RTR and RTR406. As can be observed in Fig. 3, EMSA analysis of the binding of RTR and RTR406 to32P-conRTRE yielded three shifted bands that would be consistent with the formation of an RTR homodimer, an RTR-RTR406 heterodimer, and an RTR406homodimer. When EMSA was carried out with 32P-M3-RE, which binds RTR or RTR406 as a monomer, only two shifted bands were observed. These findings support the interpretation that RTR binds to conRTRE as a homodimer. As shown in Fig. 2 B, RTR is able to bind to a single core motif (1/2-RTRE). To define more precisely the requirements for high affinity RTR binding, the effect of several mutations in the 5′-flanking sequence of 1/2-RTRE on the ability of these response elements to compete with32P-1/2-RTRE for RTR binding was examined (Fig.4 A). As shown in Fig. 4 B, when one or both of the adenosines at the −6 and −7 positions (H-M2, H-M3, and H-M4) were replaced by cytidine, the ability of the oligonucleotides to compete with 32P-1/2-RTRE for RTR binding was greatly diminished (lanes 9–11, 12–14, and15–17). A single mutation of the C into A at position −8 (H-M8) also reduced dramatically the ability to compete for RTR binding (Fig. 4 C, lanes 31–33). A single mutation of the T into C (H-M5) or G (H-M7) at position −9 slightly reduced the ability to compete with 32P-1/2-RTR (Fig. 4, B,lanes 18–20, andC, lanes 28–30, respectively). The latter is in agreement with the lower requirement for a specific nucleotide at this position as shown in Fig. 1, although T appears to be the preferred nucleotide. Mutations at the positions −10, −11, and +1 (H-M1 and H-M6, respectively) did not significantly alter the affinity for RTR (lanes 6–8 and21–23). Several mutations (H-M10 through H-M13) within the core motif of the 1/2-RTRE had a dramatic effect on the binding of RTR (Fig. 4 D, lanes 41–52). The oligonucleotide H-M9, which contains T instead of G at position −4, competed equally well for binding as the 1/2-RTRE in agreement with obtained consensus sequence (Fig. 1). An antibody, RTR-Ab2, was raised against a specific RTR peptide and tested for its ability to bind RTR. This antiserum, but not the preimmune serum, could immunoprecipitate in vitro translated,35S-labeled RTR, which migrated as a protein with a molecular mass of about 58 kDa (Fig. 5 A,lanes 2 and 3). The addition of the immunizing peptide blocked the immunoprecipitation of RTR (Fig. 5 A,lanes 4 and 5). These results demonstrate that this antiserum is able to recognize RTR protein specifically. The RTR-Ab2 antiserum was then used in a supershift assay. As shown in Fig.5 B, the RTR-RTRE complex migrates more slowly when the reaction is carried out in the presence of RTR-Ab2 (lane 2), whereas no change in migration was observed in the presence of preimmune serum (lane 3). The presence of increasing amounts of the immunizing peptide inhibited the supershift of the RTR-RTRE complex (lanes 4 and 5). Previous observations demonstrated that RTR mRNA is highly expressed in testis and was associated with a specific stage of germ cells differentiation (27Hirose T. O'Brien D.A. Jetten A.M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 152: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 28Chen F. Cooney A.J. Wang Y. Law S.W. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1434-1444PubMed Google Scholar). The highest level of GCNF/RTR mRNA was detected in late round spermatids (27Hirose T. O'Brien D.A. Jetten A.M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 152: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). 2Z. H. Yan, A. Medvedev, T. Hirose, H. Gotoh, and A. M. Jetten, unpublished observations. The association of GCNF/RTR mRNA expression with late round spermatids suggests that GCNF/RTR regulates gene expression during maturation of round spermatids to elongated spermatids. This stage of differentiation is associated with many changes in gene expression (29Eddy E.M. Welch J.E. O'Brien D.A. de Kretser D. Molecular Biology of the Male Reproductive System. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1993: 181-231Google Scholar, 36Wolgemuth D.J. Watrin F. Mammalian Genome. 1991; 1: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We, therefore, examined the 5′-flanking promoter regions of several genes, including protamine 2, reported to be induced at this stage of differentiation for the presence of RTREs. Based on the sequence of the conRTRE, we identified a putative RTRE in the regulatory region of the mouse protamine 2 gene between nucleotides −213 and −228 (30Johnson P.A. Peschon J.J. Yelick P.C. Palmiter R.D. Hecht N.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 950: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) (Fig.6 A). This RTRE, referred to as P2-RE, consists of a DR0 and is almost identical to the conRTRE (Fig.6 A). Northern analysis using poly(A)+ RNA isolated from mouse round spermatids confirmed that the RTR and protamine 2 genes are highly expressed at this stage of spermatogenesis (not shown). The putative P2-RE was synthesized and analyzed for RTR binding in EMSA. As shown in Fig. 6 B, P2-RE could compete with32P-conRTRE for RTR binding almost as well as the unlabeled conRTRE itself. We then performed EMSA with 32P-P2-RE in the absence or presence of a 5-, 25-, and 100-fold excess of unlabeled P2-RE or P2-mRE, which is mutated at two positions (Fig.6 A). These experiments demonstrated that32P-P2-RE forms a complex with RTR (Fig. 6 C,lane 2) and that unlabeled P2-RE competed effectively with this binding (lanes 3–5), while P2-mRE had a greatly reduced ability to compete with 32P-P2-RE for RTR binding (Fig. 6 C, lanes 6–8). These results show that the P2-RE present in the promoter regulatory region of the protamine 2 gene can function as a high affinity binding site for RTR and as such could play a role in the regulation of the expression of this gene. Since RTR is highly expressed in testis, we examined whether proteins in nuclear extracts from testis were able to bind to the P2-RE. When testis nuclear extracts were incubated with 32P-P2-RE and analyzed by EMSA, multiple DNA-protein complexes were observed (Fig.7). This is not surprising, since a number of other nuclear receptors, including SF-1/FTZ-F1 (24Wilson T.E. Fahrner T.J. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5794-5804Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 25Lynch J.P. Lala D.S. Peluso J.J. Luo W."

A colorimetric ATPase assay at pH 7.8 has been applied to reconstituted skeletal muscle thin filaments at actin:S1:TM ratios of 6:1:2. Several TnI fragments (TnI-(104–115), TnI-(1–116), and TnI-(96–148)) and TnI mutants with single amino acid substitutions within the inhibitory region (residues 104–115) were assayed to determine their roles on the regulatory function of TnI. TnI-(104–115) is sufficient for achieving maximum inhibition of the acto-S1-TM ATPase activity and its importance was clearly shown by the reduced potency of TnI mutants with single amino acid substitutions within this region. However, the function of the inhibitory region is modulated by other regions of TnI as observed by the poor inhibitory activity of TnI-(1–116) and the increased potency of the inhibitory region by TnI-(96–148). The regulatory complex composed of TnI-(96–148) plus troponin T-troponin C complex (TnT·C) displays the same Ca2+ sensitivity (pCa50) as intact troponin (Tn) or TnI plus TnT·C while those regulatory complexes composed of TnT·C plus either TnI-(104–115) or TnI-(1–116) had an increase in their pCa50 values. This indicates that the Ca2+sensitivity or responsiveness of the thin filament is controlled by TnI residues 96–148. The ability of Tn to activate the acto-S1-TM ATPase activity in the presence of calcium to the level of the acto-S1 rate was mimicked by the regulatory complex composed of TnI-(1–116) plus TnT·C and was not seen with complexes composed with either TnI-(104–115) or TnI-(96–148). This indicates that the N terminus of TnI in conjunction with TnT controls the degree of activation of the ATPase activity. Although the TnI inhibitory region (104–115) is the Ca2+-sensitive switch which changes binding sites from actin-TM to TnC in the presence of calcium, its function is modulated by both the C-terminal and N-terminal regions of TnI.

The Tn regulatory complex consists of three proteins: troponin I (TnI), the inhibitory protein; troponin T (TnT), which binds to TM; and troponin C (TnC), which binds Ca2+. In the absence of Ca2+, TnI interacts with actin-TM and inhibits the acto-S1-TM ATPase activity while in the presence of Ca2+, TnI interacts with TnC and the inhibition is released. Full biological function which includes inhibition, Ca2+-dependent release (neutralization), activation of the ATPase activity, and Ca2+ sensitivity requires all three Tn components. The activation of the acto-S1-TM ATPase activity to the acto-S1 ATPase rate (unregulated actin) can occur in the presence of Tn and Ca2+ or at high ratios of S1 to actin by TM alone (1Lehrer S.S. Morris E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8073-8080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Full regulation by Tn may be due to changes in the interactions between TnI and actin, TM, TnT, or TnC. Therefore, it is critical to identify and determine the contributions of different regions of TnI toward the various aspects of Tn regulation. Studies of skeletal TnI, using synthetic peptides, proteolytic and/or recombinant fragments have identified several regions of TnI that interact with both actin-TM and TnC (2Farah C.S. Reinach F.C.

In fact, a synthetic peptide, TnI-(104–115), comprised the minimum sequence required for the maximum level of inhibition of the actomyosin or actomyosin fragment S1 ATPase activity (4Van Eyk J.E.

As well, TnI-(104–115) has been shown to replace intact TnI in regulating the Ca2+-dependent contraction and relaxation of skinned muscle fibers (10Van Eyk J.E. Strauss J.D. Hodges R.S. Ruegg J.C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). There are other regions within TnI that are also known to modulate TnI function. For example, the N-terminal synthetic peptide TnI-(1–40) binds to TnC and prevents the Ca2+-dependent release of TnI or TnI-(104–115) inhibition (9Ngai S.-M. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15715-15720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A TnI mutant in which residues 1–57 are deleted, TnI-(del57), has a modified interaction with TnC and does not interact with TnT (11Sheng Z. Pan B.-S. Miller T.E. Potter J.D. J. Biol.

The N terminus of skeletal TnI is critical for the incorporation of TnI into the ternary complex with TnT and TnC. In addition, the C terminus of TnI in conjunction with the inhibitory region is critical for the Ca2+-dependent reconstitution of Tn activity in actomyosin ATPase assays (13Farah C.S. Miyamoto C.A. Ramos C.H.I. da Silva A.C.R. Quaggio R.B. Fujimori K. Smillie L.B. Reinach F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5230-5240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TnI-(96–116) displays an 8-fold increase in affinity for TnC compared with TnI-(104–115) (14Chandra M. McCubbin W.D. Oikawa K. Kay C.M. Smillie L.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2961-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and by extending the sequence toward the C terminus TnI-(96–148) displays an even larger increase in the binding affinity for TnC (15Pearlstone J.R. Smillie L.B. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: A166Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to determine the effect of the N- and C-terminal regions of skeletal TnI (situated adjacent to the inhibitory region 104–115) on the Ca2+-dependent control of the acto-S1-TM ATPase activity and their ability to modulate this inhibitory region. Recombinant TnI fragments corresponding to residues 1–116 (TnI-(1–116)) and residues 96–148 (TnI-(96–148)), a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 104–115 (TnI-(104–115)), and TnI mutants with single amino acid substitutions within the inhibitory region (TnI (K105G) and TnI (L111G)) display different binding affinities for actin-TM and/or the complex of troponin T and troponin C (TnT·C). Therefore, we designed a general protocol for the reconstitution and analysis of regulatory complexes composed of TnI mutants or TnI fragments. This protocol allows for rapid and easy evaluation of TnI fragments or mutants showing different affinities for either actin-TM and/or TnT and TnC. The manipulation of the molar ratio of the TnI fragments or mutants with respect to the other thin filament proteins allows for the reconstitution of a functional regulatory complex in the acto-S1-TM ATPase assay. Under the conditions of maximum Ca2+-response, the composition of the various regulatory complexes reconstituted on the thin filament are similar, even though the concentrations in solution may differ. We have found that the N- and C-terminal regions of TnI work in conjunction with TnT·C to influence different regulatory aspects of the reconstituted thin filament. That is, the C-terminal region of TnI plays a role in controlling the Ca2+ sensitivity or responsiveness of the thin filament and the N-terminal region of TnI is critical for activation of the ATPase activity. Rabbit skeletal muscle Tn was purified according to the protocol of Ebashiet al., (16Ebashi S. Wakabayashi T. Ebashi F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1971; 69: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: the wash buffer contained 20 mm KCl and 2 mm potassium carbonate; the extraction buffer contained 0.6 m lithium chloride and 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5; contaminating TM was removed by isoelectric precipitation, pH 4.5; and the ammonium sulfate cuts were 0–40, 40–50, and 50–60%. Rabbit skeletal troponin T (TnT) and rabbit skeletal troponin C (TnC) subunits were isolated according to the protocol of Pan et al. (17Pan B-S. Gordon A.M. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12432-12438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications; the column buffer contained 8 m urea, 50 mm Tris, 3 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; and the gradient was 0–0.5 m sodium chloride. Rabbit skeletal troponin I was further purified according to Wilkinson (18Wilkinson J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 359: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: the column buffer contained 8m urea, 100 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 4.5; and the gradient used was 0–0.25 m sodium chloride. Recombinant rabbit skeletal muscle TnI (rrTnI) was expressed as described previously (19Kluwe L.V. Maeda Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 325: 83-88Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and the TnI (K105G) and TnI (L111G) mutants were prepared according to Strausset al. (20Strauss J.D. Van Eyk J.E. Zacharias B. Kluwe L. Wiesner R.J. Maeda Y. Ruegg J.C. Pflugers Arch. 1996; 431: 851-863Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Chicken skeletal muscle recombinant TnI (crTnI) and TnI-(1–116) were prepared and purified according to Farah et al. (13Farah C.S. Miyamoto C.A. Ramos C.H.I. da Silva A.C.R. Quaggio R.B. Fujimori K. Smillie L.B. Reinach F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5230-5240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chicken skeletal recombinant TnI-(96–148) was prepared according to Pearlstone et al. (15Pearlstone J.R. Smillie L.B. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: A166Google Scholar). The synthetic TnI peptide, TnI-(104–115), was synthesized and purified by HPLC as described by Van Eyk and Hodges (4Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. Methods (Orlando). 1993; 5: 264-280Google Scholar). The purity and authenticity of the peptides or fragments were verified by amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry. Skeletal actin was prepared according to Spudich and Watts (21Spudich J.A. Watts S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the final polymerization was carried out in either 6.5 mmKCl/ATPase buffer or 100 mm KCl binding buffer as described below. Cardiac αα-tropomyosin was prepared according to Smillie (22Smillie L.B. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 851: 234-241Crossref Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Skeletal myosin subfragment 1 (S1(A1)(A2)) was prepared according to Weed and Taylor (23Weeds A.G. Taylor R.S Nature. 1975; 257: 54-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). The potassium-EDTA ATPase activity of the S1 was 7.2 nmol of phosphate released s−1 nmol−1S1. Myosin S1(A1)(A2) and TM were dialyzed against 6.5 mmKCl/ATPase buffer. The potassium chloride (KCl) concentrations of the assay buffers were varied during the protein preparation and for different ATPase experiments. Therefore, when listing the buffers used for the experiments, the KCl concentration is listed in parentheses. For example, the ATPase (6.5 mm KCl) buffer refers to the assay buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris, 6.5 mmKCl, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% sodium azide (pH 7.8) while the binding buffer (100 mm KCl) contained 20 mmTris, 100 mm KCl, 5.0 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% sodium azide (pH 7.8). The KCl concentration for the ATPase assay was 6.5, 13, or 19 mm for 320 μl or 19 mm KCl for a 200-μl assay volume. The salt concentration of the assay buffer or the assay volume did not affect the relative acto-S1-TM ATPase activity, the pCa50 or n H values of the ATPase/pCa curves (Table I) but did change the absolute ATPase activity. The buffers used to dissolve and dialyze Tn, TnC, or the TnT·C complex contained 50 μm CaCl2 and no EGTA and are identified as ATPase minus EGTA buffers. TnT and TnC were dissolved separately in ATPase (1m KCl) minus EGTA buffer containing 6 m urea at approximately 5–10 mg/ml. The TnT and TnC were then dialyzed against ATPase (1 m KCl) minus EGTA buffer containing 2m urea. TnT and TnC were combined in a 1:1 molar ratio based on peak area obtained from the elution profile at 210 nm from reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (for more details, see the centrifugation studies section). The TnT·C complex was subsequently dialyzed against the following series of buffers consisting of ATPase minus EGTA buffer containing 1, 0.5, 0.25, and 0.1m KCl. TnT·C was further dialyzed to 6.5 mmKCl when TnT·C was used to reconstitute a regulatory complex with rrTnI, TnI (K105G), or TnI (L111G). The mole ratio of TnT to TnC in the final solution ranged between 1:1.5 and 1:1.8. This is the mole ratio required to keep TnT in solution when the concentration of KCl is 0.1m and below. All TnT·C concentrations listed in the article are based on the TnT concentration. CrTnI), TnI-(1–116), rrTnI, TnI (L111G), and TnI (K105G) were prepared using the same dialysis procedure as described for the TnT·C complex except the ATPase buffer contains 0.5 mm EGTA and no CaCl2. The final dialysis buffer for rrTnI, TnI (K105G), TnI (L111G), and crTnI was ATPase (100 mm KCl) buffer and for TnI-(1–116) the final buffer was ATPase (6.5 mm KCl) buffer. Rabbit skeletal TnI was either prepared in the same manner as the two recombinant TnI proteins (final buffer ATPase (100 mm KCl) with final concentration of approximately 1 mg/ml) or dissolved directly in H2O (pH ∼ 3.5) with a final concentration of approximately 4 mg/ml. Due to the higher solubility of TnI at low pH, the volume of TnI added to the assay was small and did not alter the pH of the assay buffer. TnI-(104–115), TnI-(96–148), and rabbit skeletal Tn were dissolved directly in ATPase (6.5 mm KCl) buffer or binding (100 mm KCl) buffer. Prior to use, the proteins and peptides were either centrifuged at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 or 30 min if they were to be used in the centrifugation experiments. The concentrations of the proteins, peptides, and fragments were determined by amino acid analysis except for S1 which was determined by absorbance. A colorimetric method was used to quantitate the amount of Pi liberated by myosin S1. The colorimetric method is based on Heinonen and Lahti (24Heinonen J.K. Lahti R.J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 113: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar) except Tris was used in the ATPase buffer and the pH increased from 7.0 to 7.8. The assay volume was either 200 or 320 μl. The amount of protein added to each assay volume was: 1.5 nmol of F-actin, 0.25 nmol of S1, and 0.429 nmol of TM (dimeric). The reaction was preincubated for 10 min at 25 °C and then initiated with the addition of ATP (2 mm). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 10–35 min depending on the assay. Control experiments demonstrated that the ATPase rate under these conditions were linear. The reaction was stopped and the quantity of liberated inorganic phosphate (Pi) determined by the addition of 2.4 ml of a 2:1:1 (v/v/v) acetone, 5 n sulfuric acid, 10 mm ammonium molybdate solution followed by the addition of 240 μl of a 1 m citric acid solution. The absorbance of the individual tubes were determined at 355 nm. The endogenous S1 ATPase rate was subtracted from the data (i.e.0.065 nmol phosphate released s−1 nmol−1 S1, 6.5 mm KCl, 320-μl assay volume). Each ATPase data point was determined in triplicate. In addition, each pCa versusATPase curve was repeated twice. The standard deviation between these curves were plotted. In the inhibition assays, increasing quantities of TnI or TnI fragments were added until maximum inhibition of the acto-S1-TM ATPase activity was reached. For the Ca2+-dependent release assays the concentration of inhibitor required to reach maximum inhibition was used and increasing quantities of a performed TnT·C complex or TnC was added until maximum Ca2+ activation of the acto-S1-TM ATPase activity was achieved. In the presence of 0.429 nmol of Tn (mole ratio of 1:1 with TM) the acto-S1-TM ATPase activity was determined in both the absence (pCa 8.0) and presence of Ca2+ (pCa 3.5). The pCa versus ATPase curves were obtained using the concentration of TnT·C and TnI, TnI fragments, or TnI mutants that induce the maximum Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity. Increasing quantities of 2.64 or 5.40 mm standardized calcium chloride was added to achieve pCa values between 3.5 and 9.0. Precipitation occurred with TnI-(104–115) and TnI-(1–116) unless there was a low concentration of Ca2+ (pCa ∼6.9) present in the assay prior to the addition of the TnT·C complex. At this low Ca2+ concentration, the ATPase activity was similar for the regulatory complex and the TnI peptide or fragment alone. The ATPase/pCa curves (Fig. 4) for TnI-(104–115) and TnI-(1–116) were done in 320 μl (13 mm KCl); rrTnI, TnI (K105G), and TnI (L111G) plus TnT·C were done in 320 μl (19 mm KCl); while crTnI and TnI-(96–148), were carried out at 200 μl (19 mm KCl). The change in the assay volume from 200 to 320 μl or changes in the salt concentration of the assay buffer did not alter the pCa or n H value of either rabbit skeletal Tn or rabbit skeletal TnI plus TnT·C (Fig. 4 A, Table I). The increase in the volume did lower the overall turnover time of the complex due to the decrease in the concentration of S1 and the individual thin filament components (compare the acto-S1-TM ATPase activities of 0.455 ± 0.015 to 0.656 ± 0.004 nmol of phosphate released s−1 nmol−1 S1 in 320 and 200 μl at 6.5 mm KCl, respectively). The precautionary measures taken to control the calcium concentration have been described (25Golosinska K. Pearlstone J.R. Borgford T. Oikawa K. Kay C.M. Carpenter M.R. Smillie L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15797-15809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Free calcium concentrations were calculated taking into account ionic strength and pH as described by Chandraet al. (14Chandra M. McCubbin W.D. Oikawa K. Kay C.M. Smillie L.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2961-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The log of the individual binding constants used in the present work were as follows: EGTA + H ⇌ EGTA·H, 9.526; EGTA·H + H ⇌ EGTA·H2, 18.454; EGTA·H2 + H ⇌EGTA·H3, 21.254; EGTA·H3 + H ⇌ EGTA·H4, 23.374; EGTA + Ca ⇌ EGTA·Ca, 11.310; EGTA·H + Ca ⇌ EGTA·H·Ca, 14.856; TnC + 2Ca ⇌ TnC·Ca2, 3.400; TnC·Ca2 + 2Ca ⇌ TnC·Ca4, 24.800; EGTA + Mg ⇌ EGTA·Mg, 7.000; EGTA·H + Mg ⇌ EGTA·H·Mg, 12.896; ATP + H ⇌ ATP·H, 7.067; ATP·H + H ⇌ ATP·H2, 4.140; ATP·H2 + H ⇌ ATP·H3, 1.000; ATP·H3 + H ⇌ ATP·H4, 1.000; ATP + Ca ⇌ ATP·Ca, 4.158; ATP·H + Ca ⇌ ATP·H·Ca, 8.851; ATP + Mg ⇌ ATP·Mg, 4.422; ATP·H + Mg ⇌ ATP·H·Mg, 9.831. The pCa/ATPase data were curve fitted to a sigmoidal curve using the kaleidograph program, Apple Macintosh. To quantitate the amount of each regulatory protein bound to the actin thin filament, binding studies were carried out in binding (100 mm KCl) buffer in the presence of 3 mm CaCl2. The concentration of MgCl2 (26Eaton B.L. Kominz D.R. Eisenberg E. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 2718-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 27Wegner A. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 2718-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) were increased compared with the ATPase buffer (5 and 100 mm, respectively) to ensure maximum binding of TM in the absence of Tn. In addition, the higher salt concentrations (100 mm KCl) prevented nonspecific binding of proteins to the centrifuge tubes and ensured quantitative recovery of the proteins. Since lower salt concentrations were used in the ATPase assays than in the binding experiments, it is important to note that the composition of the various regulatory complexes bound to actin-TM in the ATPase assays may be different than that observed in the binding experiments. The total assay volume used was 175 μl. The concentration of actin was 1.31 μm and the mole ratio of actin to TM was 7:2. Actin, TM, Tn, TnI, TnI-(1–116), and TnT·C were dialyzed against the binding buffer. Tn, TnI, or TnI-(1–116) in the presence and absence of the TnT·C were added to the actin and TM mixture. The samples were spun for 30 min at approximately 24 p.s.i. on a Beckman airfuge using a 18 Å-100 rotor. This resulted in 90–99% of the actin being pelleted. The pellets were dissolved in 50 μl of 0.05% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. 40 μl of this solution was injected on a Zorbax C8 SB300 reversed-phase column (4.6 mm inner diameter × 250 mm) on a Hewlett Packard series 1090 LC coupled to a Hewlett Packard Vectra 486166 XM processor. The various proteins and fragments were eluted using a 2% B/min linear gradient where eluent A is 0.05% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid and eluent B is 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile at a flow rate of 1 ml/min (40Ingraham R.H. Hodges R.S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5891-5898Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The peak areas were determined at 210 nm and/or 280 nm and converted to nanomoles using a standard curve obtained for each protein or fragment. The standard deviation of the standard curves ranged from 5 to 8%. The amount of protein (TM, TnT, TnC, and TnI) or TnI fragment pelleted in the absence of actin (2–7.5%) was subtracted from the amount pelleted in the presence of actin. The experiments were done in triplicate and the standard deviations were calculated. All of the skeletal TnI fragments except TnI-(1–116) were able to inhibit the acto-S1-TM ATPase activity to approximately the same degree as native skeletal muscle TnI (10%, Fig.1) or intact Tn in the absence of calcium (18%, data not shown). However, the quantity required to achieve this level of inhibition markedly differed between the various skeletal TnI fragments (Fig. 1). For example, compared with rabbit skeletal TnI, TnI-(104–115) is a less effective inhibitor requiring approximately three times the concentration to reach maximum inhibition (compare IC50 values of 0.84 to 2.25, respectively; TableI). The importance of the inhibitory region (residues 104–115) is also illustrated by comparing rrTnI to either TnI (K105G) or TnI(L111G). These mutants require a 2.2–3-fold higher concentration to induce the same maximum level of inhibition of the acto-S1-TM ATPase activity (compare the IC50 of 0.62 with 1.88 and 1.37, respectively; Table I). This indicates that the single amino acid substitution of lysine at position 105 or leucine at position 111 with glycine in the intact protein reduces its apparent affinity for actin-TM. The fragment, TnI-(96–148), had similar potency as native TnI (IC50 value of 0.77 and 0.84, respectively; Table I) which suggests that TnI-(96–148) contains residues (other than residues 104–115) that enhance the potency of this region. TnI-(1–116) was the least effective inhibitor displaying no inhibition at a molar ratios of 1:1 TnI-(1–116) to TM and only 16% inhibition at a 3:1 mol ratio (Fig. 1 A). Higher mole ratio could not be used since TnI-(1–116) precipitated. These results suggest that the N-terminal region of TnI antagonizes the interaction between the TnI inhibitory region (104–115) and actin-TM either through reducing the quantity of protein bound to the actin filament or by reducing the effectiveness of the inhibitory region. To determine between these two possibilities, actin centrifugation studies were carried out as described below. Fig. 2 A shows the ability of rabbit skeletal TnT·C to release the inhibition of various TnI fragments (in the presence of Ca2+). Rabbit skeletal TnI inhibition is released and the ATPase activity is activated to 224% by the addition of rabbit TnT·C at a 3:6:7 r"

A control group (glycerol-infused) and high plasma FFA group (Liposyn-infused) were clamped at euglycemia (∼6 mm)-hyperinsulinemia (10 milliunits/kg/min) throughout the experiment (180–240 min). In the initial experiment, 13C NMR was used to observe [1-13C]glucose incorporation into [1-13C]glycogen in the rat hindlimb for glycogen synthesis calculations and into [3-13C]lactate and [3-13C]alanine for glycolytic flux calculations. These experiments were followed by 31P NMR measurements of Glu-6-P changes under identical conditions of the initial experiment. Plasma FFA concentrations were 2.25 ± 0.36 and 0.20 ± 0.03 mm in the high plasma FFA and control groups respectively (p < 0.0005). Glucose infusion rates (Ginf) decreased significantly in the Liposyn-infused rats (29.5 ± 0.7 and 27.2 ± 1.2 mg/kg/min for control and high plasma FFA group, respectively, at 15 min to 30.7 ± 2.3 and 17.7 ± 1.3 mg/kg/min, respectively, at the end of the experiment,p < 0.002). Glycogen synthesis rates were 163 ± 32 and 104 ± 17 nmol/g/min, and glycolytic rates were 57.9 ± 8.0 and 19.5 ± 3.6 nmol/g/min (p < 0.002) in the control and high plasma FFA groups, respectively. The relative flux of pyruvate versus free fatty acids and ketones entering the tricarboxylic acid cycle was greater in the control (57 ± 9%) versus high plasma FFA group (25 ± 4%) (p < 0.005) as assessed by [4-13C]glutamate/[3-13C]lactate steady state isotopic enrichment measurements. Finally, Glu-6-P concentrations increased by 29.8 ± 7.0 and 52.8 ± 12.3% (p < 0.05) in the control and high plasma FFA groups, respectively, above their basal concentrations by 180 min.In conclusion, we have demonstrated the ability to use in vivo NMR to elucidate the metabolic fate of glucose within skeletal muscle of an awake rat during a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp and increased levels of plasma FFA. These data suggest that increased concentrations of plasma FFA inhibit insulin-stimulated muscle glucose metabolism in the rat through inhibition of glycolysis.

These data suggest that increased concentrations of plasma FFA inhibit insulin-stimulated muscle glucose metabolism in the rat through inhibition of glycolysis. Increased levels of plasma free fatty acids (FFA) 1The abbreviations used are: FFA, free fatty acid; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; HGP, hepatic glucose production rate; APE, atom percent excess. 1The abbreviations used are: FFA, free fatty acid; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; HGP, hepatic glucose production rate; APE, atom percent excess. are prevalent in people with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and may play an important role in mediating the insulin resistance associated with this disease. A decrease in insulin-dependent glucose uptake by increased FFA was originally observed in vitro in heart and diaphragm muscle by Randle et al. (1Randle P.J. Garland P.B. Hales C.N. Newsholme E.A. Lancet. 1963; i: 785-789Abstract Scopus (3759) Google Scholar). This phenomenon was postulated to be a result of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) enzyme allosteric control by increased intramitochondrial acetyl-CoA/CoA and NADH/NAD+ ratios that activates pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase enzyme which subsequently deactivates the PDH enzyme complex (2Randle P.J. Priestman D.A. Mistry S. Halsall A. Diabetologia.. 1994; 37: 155-161Google Scholar). Intramitochondrial citrate also increases under conditions of increased FFA oxidation and decreased flux through isocitrate dehydrogenase. Citrate is a potent allosteric effector of phosphofructokinase (3Newsholme E.A. Sugden P.H. Williams T. Biochem. J. 1977; 166: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and therefore inhibits this step which will increase glucose 6-phosphate (Glu-6-P). Increased Glu-6-P will allosterically inhibit hexokinase (4Lueck J.D. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 1341-1347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, increased intracellular glucose will diminish the glucose gradient, and glucose transport into the muscle cell will also be inhibited. This metabolic phenomenon, also known as the glucose-free fatty acid cycle, has more recently come into question in skeletal muscle as conflicting results have been presented. Previous studies in rat have shown that an increase in plasma FFA concentration caused an increase (5Jenkins A.B. Storlien L.H. Chisholm D.J. Kraegen E.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), decrease (6Kim J.K. Wi J.K. Youn J.H. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 446-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 7Nolte L.A.

Discrepancies within these previous findings may in large be due to the vastly different techniques used to elucidate skeletal muscle and/or whole body glucose uptake. Most in vivo studies (6Kim J.K.

Due to the quantitatively important contribution of other organs to whole body glycolysis (brain) and whole body FFA oxidation (liver and heart), rates of glycolysis and FFA oxidation must be measured directly in skeletal muscle to accurately assess the effects of FFA on these processes in this tissue. To address these issues, we have developed a method using in vivo 13C NMR to directly measure rates of glycolysis and glycogen synthesis simultaneously in skeletal muscle of awake rats, and additional measurements in skeletal muscle tissue extracts were used to calculate relative rates of pyruvate versus FFA/ketone oxidation. These measurements were combined with 31P NMR temporal measurements of Δ[Glu-6-P] to assess the mechanism for decreased insulin-dependent glucose uptake in rat muscle under conditions of euglycemia-hyperinsulinemia and increased plasma FFA. Harlan Sprague Dawley rats (Charles River, Raleigh, NC) were maintained on standard rat chow (Ralston Purina Co., St. Louis, MO) and housed in an environmentally controlled room with a 12-h light/dark cycle. At weights between 250 and 300 g, rats were chronically catheterized in the right jugular vein and carotid artery. The catheters were externalized through an incision in the skin flap behind its head (16Smith D. Rossetti L. Ferrannini E. Johnson C.M. Cobelli L. Toffolo G. Katz L.D. DeFronzo R.A. Metabolism. 1987; 36: 1167-1174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The rats were allowed to recuperate after surgery for the indwelling catheters until they were at least of pre-operative weight (approximately 5–10 days). All rats were fasted 24 h before the infusion experiment. Rats (250–350 g) were placed in a customized restraining tube that allowed their left hindlimb to be secured to the outside of the tube in a manner to limit free movement of the leg for NMR measurements. The rats were transiently anesthetized (<30 s) with a low dose (2.5 mg) of thiopental (Sigma) to place them in the restraining tube. Two groups were studied. The control group (n = 15) was infused with glycerol to eliminate any contribution of glycerol from triglycerides to metabolic changes in the muscle, and the high plasma FFA group (n = 14) was infused with Liposyn II (1:3 v/v with saline, Abbott), a 20% triglyceride emulsion combined with heparin (continuous infusion, 0.0975 IU/min). Heparin was used to activate lipoprotein lipase and thereby catalyze the hydrolysis of triglycerides. At the end of thein vivo NMR experiment, rats were anesthetized with thiopental (50 mg/kg). Superficial skin was rapidly removed from the left hindquarter followed by in situ freeze clamping of the gastrocnemius and quadriceps muscles. Rats were euthanized with a lethal dose of thiopental. Euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic (10 milliunits/kg/min, Humulin Regular, Lilly) clamps were performed using [1-13C]glucose (99% enriched, 20% w/v, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Cambridge, MA) infused simultaneously with glycerol (0.425 mg/min) or Liposyn II (1:3 v/v saline at 39 μl/min) plus heparin (0.0975 IU/min) at 2.5 min after the commencement of the primed continuous insulin infusion. Plasma glucose concentrations were clamped ∼6 mm. All clamps lasted for 180–240 min. High plasma FFA group clamps were generally 240 min, because of the longer period required for label turnover in lactate and alanine. Blood samples were drawn during base-line NMR measurement, at 7.5 and 15 min and every 15 min thereafter for immediate assessment of plasma glucose and lactate concentrations. All in vivo NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker Biospec 7.0 tesla system (horizontal 22-cm diameter bore magnet). In the initial experiment (control: n = 8, high plasma FFA: n = 9), 13C observe/1H decouple NMR was performed using dual concentric surface coils. The outer 1H coil (30 mm) was tuned to 300.68 MHz, and the inner 13C coil (18 mm) was tuned to 75.65 MHz. The radio frequency isolation between the two coils was 43 db. The rat hindlimb was positioned over the13C coil and placed in magnet isocenter. Global 1H shimming was followed by localized shimming with a STEAM sequence (17Frahm J. Merboldt K.-D. Hänicke W. J. Magn. Res. 1987; 72: 502-508Google Scholar) over a 1 × 2 × 2-cm volume of the leg to optimize magnetic field homogeneity over the volume observed by the13C surface coil. Water line widths of 35–45 Hz were obtained. 1H-decoupled 13C NMR spectroscopy was performed in the following manner. An initial frequency-selective sinc pulse (20 ms) set on the low field side of the methylene carbon of lipids at 30 ppm was immediately followed by a nonselective hard pulse (approximately 70° flip angle, 5 mm from surface coil). The sinc pulse power was adjusted to eliminate most of the signal in that region. Broadband 1H Waltz-16 decoupling was applied during acquisition, and additional nuclear Overhauser effect was achieved using low power decoupling (0.4 watts) during the relaxation delay (TR = 0.5 s, SW = 20 KHz, 4K data). A 15-min base-line spectrum was followed by subsequent 15-min acquisitions throughout the duration of the experiment. All data were processed using a Gaussian filter followed by Fourier transformation. All spectra were base line-subtracted prior to peak analysis, and the (α) [1-13C]glucose peak was set to 93.0 ppm. The C-1 glycogen peak (100.5 ppm) was integrated over the downfield half and multiplied by 2 to limit overlapping contribution from β-glucose (96.8 ppm). C-3 lactate (21.0 ppm) and C-3 alanine (16.9 ppm) were clearly resolved for peak integration. The signal to noise ratio (S/N) of the C-3 lactate and C-3 alanine peaks in the final spectrum as determined by peak to peak noise amplitude were 11.0 ± 3.6 and 14.8 ± 2.8, respectively. In the experiments using 31P NMR (control:n = 7, high plasma FFA: n = 5), the31P observe 1H shim coils were of the same design and geometry as the 13C/1H coil assembly. Shimming was followed in the same manner as described above. Direct 1H-decoupled 31P NMR was performed at 121.72 MHz. A hard pulse (45° flip angle) was optimized 5 mm from the surface coil (TR = 1.4 s, SW = 5 KHz, 4K data). Broadband 1H Waltz-16 decoupling was applied during acquisition, and frequency centered on 6-H2 of Glu-6-P. Data were accumulated into 15-min acquisitions as was done with the carbon data and processed with Gaussian filtering and Fourier transformation. In two experiments, fully relaxed base-line spectra (TR = 30 s, NS = 64) were obtained for saturation correction factors. The phosphocreatine peak was set to 0 ppm and base line manually corrected. A standard solution containing phosphocreatine, Pi, α-glycerol phosphate, IMP, and Glu-6-P at pH = 7 was run to determine peak chemical shift assignments. β-ATP was integrated and used as the internal concentration standard (7.2 mm) (18Bloch G. Chase J.R. Avison M.J. Shulman R.G. Magn. Reson. Med. 1993; 30: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). All spectra were integrated over a frequency window of 7.13–7.36 ppm which corresponds to the downfield side of Glu-6-P and then multiplied by 2. This was done to minimize error in the measurement resulting from α-glycerol phosphate peak overlap at 6.92 ppm (19Rothman D.L. Shulman R.G. Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1069-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The S/N for the basal Glu-6-P peak was determined to be 4.3 ± 0.2. Muscle tissue extracts were prepared for high field NMR analysis by homogenizing approximately 1 g of combined quadriceps and gastrocnemius muscle with a variable high speed electric homogenizer after sample was placed in a vortex tube filled with 0.9% perchloric acid (3 v/w) and 100 μl of 1n sodium formate. The homogenization was performed over ice to keep the sample cold. After homogenization, the sample was centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min (3400 rpm). The supernatant was extracted and the pellet saved for glycogen enrichment measurements. Minimal additional [1-13C]glycogen was detected in the supernatant as determined by high field 13C NMR but was not different between groups. KOH (4 n, 0.675 v/w) was added to the supernatant to precipitate excess chlorate ions. The sample was centrifuged once more at 4 °C for 15 min (3400 rpm). The supernatant was extracted, and 500 mm phosphate buffer, pH = 7, was added to neutralize the sample. The sample was dried in a speed-vac (Savant, Farmingdale, NY) overnight, and 1 ml of D2O was added to the dried powder before placing it in a 5-mm NMR tube for NMR analysis at 8.4 tesla (Bruker WB-360 NMR spectrometer). Proton observed-carbon enhanced spectroscopy was performed on tissue extract samples for fractional enrichment calculations (20Fitzpatrick S.M. Hetherington H.P. Behar K.L. Shulman R.G. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1990; 10: 170-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The broadband13C inversion pulse frequency was placed between C-4 glutamate and C-3 alanine (∼26.2 ppm) and turned on during alternate transients with raw data separated into two data sets providing spectra with heteronuclear coupled spins inverted (spectrum B) and non-inverted (spectrum A). The fractional enrichments (APE) of glutamate, lactate, and alanine were calculated from their respective resonances in spectrum A and B as follows in Equation 1: APE=0.5A−BA×100−1.1Equation 1 Spectra were acquired with TR = 6 s, NS = 512, 16K data, and broadband carbon decoupling. The 4-H2glutamate triplet that appears at 2.33 ppm has overlapping signal contribution from malate and β-hydroxybutyrate. Malate should be similarly enriched at steady state and is low in concentration, and negligible β-hydroxybutyrate was detected at 1.19 ppm (4-H3). Therefore, these co-resonating signals are expected to have little effect on the glutamate enrichment calculation. For quantitation, a correction factor was calculated when a TR = 19 s was used. Glutamate, glutamine, and alanine were quantitated by comparing signal intensity with a known internal concentration standard (sodium formate) that was added during the extraction procedure. High pressure liquid chromatography was used to validate amino acid concentrations measured by NMR (mean 3.8% error). Intramuscular lactate concentration was calculated by extrapolation ofin vivo NMR data (C-3 lactate and C-3 alanine) after correcting for T1 differences. Plasma glucose concentrations were measured by the glucose oxidase method (Glucose Analyzer II; Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). Plasma immunoreactive free insulin was measured with a double antibody radioimmunoassay technique (Linco Research Inc., St. Charles, MO) (21Rosselin G. Assan R. Yalow R.S. Berson S.A. Nature. 1966; 212: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar).13 C enrichment of plasma glucose and alanine was determined by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy using a Hewlett-Packard 5890 gas chromatograph (HP-1 capillary column, 12 m × 0.2 mm × 0.33 mm film thickness) interfaced to a Hewlett-Packard 5971 A mass selective detector operating in the positive chemical ionization mode with methane as a reagent gas. 100-ml aliquots of plasma from each time point were deproteinized with equal amounts of Ba(OH)2 and ZnS04. The samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant was run over a cation exchange chromatography column (AG50W-X8 100–200 mesh Bio-Rad). Both amino acid and glucose fractions were dried using a speed-vac. Glucose was derivatized for gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy analysis as described previously (22Cline G.W. Shulman G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4094-4098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and amino acids were derivatized similar to Leimer et al. (23Leimer K.R. Rice R.H. Gehrke C.W. J. Chromatogr. 1977; 141: 121-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Selective ion analysis was as described previously (22Cline G.W. Shulman G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4094-4098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, ions with m/z = 242, 243, and 244 were detected for alanine. Plasma lactate fractional enrichments were measured by1H NMR. Glycogen 13C fractional enrichments were determined using the precipitated glycogen from the initial muscle perchloric acid extraction. The precipitate was placed in microdialysis tubing (6–8000 molecular weight cut-off, Spectra/Por, Spectrum, Houston, TX) and placed in 5 liters of deionized water. The glycogen pellet was dialyzed for approximately 24 h before it was digested to free glucose with amyloglucosidase in phthalate buffer (50 mm, pH = 4.5). The sample was centrifuged, and supernatant was processed as described above for [13C]glucose fractional enrichment measurement. Absolute glycogen concentrations were measured on a separate portion of muscle as described previously (24Keppler D. Decker K. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim1974: 1127-1131Google Scholar). Plasma free fatty acids were determined using an acyl-CoA oxidase-based colorimetric kit (WAKO NEFA-C, WAKO Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan). Plasma lactate concentrations were measured by a 2300 STAT PLUS lactate analyzer (Yellow Springs Instrument Co., Yellow Springs, OH). Whole body glucose disposal rates (mg/kg/min) were calculated as the sum of the glucose infusion rate (variable) and hepatic glucose production rate (HGP) at 180 min when the plasma glucose enrichment was at steady state. HGP was calculated as described before (25Rossetti L. Giaccari A. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), and using plasma [13C]glucose APE measurements as a marker of hepatic glucose production. The incremental change in C-1 glycogen peak intensity from [1-13C]glucose incorporation was measured at 100.5 ppm. Incremental plasma glucose13C fractional enrichment as well as final glycogen13C enrichment and concentrations were used to back-extrapolate the glycogen concentration (μmol/g which represents μmol of glucosyl units/g muscle wet weight) at each measured time point to base line as described by Bloch et al. (26Bloch G. Chase J.R. Meyer D.B. Avison M.J. Shulman G.I. Shulman R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: E85-E91PubMed Google Scholar). Rates may be underestimated (<1%) due to minimal loss of13C-labeled glycogen in the tissue extraction procedure as discussed above. Glycogen synthesis rates were determined using a linear regression analysis over the individual time point glycogen concentrations. Metabolic steady state conditions were assumed to create a model for calculating carbon flux through the glycolytic pathway into the intermediate triose pool of lactate, pyruvate, and alanine. Differential equations were developed from steady state rate equations (27Mason G.F. Rothman D.L. Behar K.L. Shulman R.G. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1992; 12: 434-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). These equations may be solved for defining V Gly. Equation 2 was used to calculate V Gly: [Lac*+Pyr*+Ala*][Lac+Pyr+Ala]=0.5(a)Glc*Glc1−e−[2VGly][Lac+Pyr+Ala]tEquation 2 where [Lac] = muscle lactate concentration (nmol/g tissue), [Pyr] = muscle pyruvate concentration (nmol/g tissue), [Ala] = muscle alanine concentration (nmol/g tissue), [Lac*] = 3-13C-labeled muscle lactate concentration (nmol/g tissue), [Pyr*] = 3-13C-labeled muscle pyruvate concentration (nmol/g tissue), [Ala*] = 3-13C-labeled muscle alanine concentration (nmol/g tissue),a = label dilution factor resulting from unlabeled substrate contribution via glycogenolysis and pentose phosphate pathway, Glc*/Glc = [1-13C]glucose fractional enrichment, and V Gly = glycolytic flux (nmol/g tissue/min). In this experiment, 13C label incorporation from glucose into lactate and alanine in the hindlimb muscles was observed by13C NMR as an indirect marker of pyruvate labeling that was not detectable by 13C NMR in vivo due to its low concentration (10Berger M. Hagg S.A. Goodman M.N. Ruderman N.B. Biochem. J. 1976; 158: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). [3-13C]Lactate and [3-13C]alanine NMR signals were determined to be predominantly intramuscular as concluded from 13C NMR measurements of the muscle extracts when assuming the [1-13C]glucose NMR signal was entirely of extracellular origin. Label incorporation into lactate and alanine is a qualitative indicator of glycolytic flux (V Gly), which under steady state metabolic conditions and negligible anaerobic glycolysis equals the flux leaving the [alanine + pyruvate + lactate] pool through pyruvate dehydrogenase (V PDH) and pyruvate carboxylase (V pc) (Fig.1). Label turnover in lactate and alanine was measured until there was no longer an increase in NMR signal from these metabolites. The label turnover curve was normalized to the glucose fractional enrichment (Glc*/Glc) which was not stable through the initial 60 min of the experiment. Therefore, at each time point the combined lactate, pyruvate, and alanine pool fractional enrichment [Lac* + Pyr* + Ala*]/[Lac + Pyr + Ala] was divided by the plasma glucose fractional enrichment and a dilution factor (a) which accounts for unlabeled glucose oxidation via glycogenolysis and pentose phosphate pathway where 1-13C label is lost. The label turnover rate constants were calculated for alanine and lactate separately using a single exponential least squares fit analysis (Simfit, W. G. Bardsley, University of Manchester, UK), and the turnover rates were determined to be indistinguishable, consistent with alanine and lactate being in rapid exchange with intracellular pyruvate. The lactate and alanine fractional enrichments at the end of the experiment were equal. Therefore, a single metabolic compartment model was used, and it was assumed that cytosolic Pyr* = mitochondrial Pyr*. Basal intramuscular lactate and alanine concentrations were measured in muscle tissue extracts in a separate group of rats to compare with the metabolite concentrations at the end of the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp experiment. The concentrations were not significantly different, so the pool concentration ([Ala + Pyr + Lac]) was assumed to be constant (steady state) throughout the experiment. Lactate and alanine concentrations were quantitated by NMR, and an intracellular pyruvate concentration of 0.15 μmol/g (10Berger M. Hagg S.A. Goodman M.N. Ruderman N.B. Biochem. J. 1976; 158: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) was used for the calculation ofV Gly. Plasma alanine and lactate fractional enrichments were also measured to assess tissue alanine and lactate exchange with blood. They were determined to follow a similar label turnover as the intramuscular lactate and alanine label turnover, so label dilution from blood was excluded from Equation 2 for the calculation of V Gly. Due to the large contribution of skeletal muscle to total body weight and high proportion of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 transporters, skeletal muscle has been measured to account for the majority (∼88%) of insulin-stimulated whole body glucose uptake in man (28DeFronzo R.A. Ferrannini E. Sato Y. Felig P. Wahren J. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 68: 1468-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Therefore, although the cell membrane transport mechanisms for lactate (29Roth D.A. Brooks G.A. J. Appl. Physiol. 1993; 75: 1559-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and alanine (30Hundal H.S. Rennie M.J. Watt P.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1989; 408: 93-114Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar) have been characterized and influx and efflux activities are high for both substrates, the plasma-labeled lactate and alanine turnover under euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic conditions should be dictated by the skeletal muscle-labeled lactate and alanine turnover rather than by label turnover of these pools in smaller organs (e.g. heart) that have higher glycolytic activity than skeletal muscle. All data are reported as the mean ± S.E. Student's two-tailed t test was performed on data to determine significance at a minimum p ≤ 0.05 threshold. In both control and high plasma FFA groups, the plasma glucose concentrations were clamped at approximately 6 mm, and there was no significant difference between the groups (Fig. 2 A). Plasma insulin concentrations in both groups started at 102 ± 20 and 130 ± 38 pm and increased to a level of 1230 ± 174 and 1356 ± 84 pm in the control and high plasma FFA groups, respectively, at 60 min and were clamped throughout the experiment (Fig. 2 B). Basal plasma free fatty acid concentrations were 0.91 ± 0.11 and 0.96 ± 0.19 mm in the control and high plasma FFA group, respectively (Fig. 2 C). At the first measurement (60 min), the plasma FFA concentrations were 0.28 ± 0.03 and 2.25 ± 0.29 mm in the control and high plasma FFA group (p < 0.005) and remained there for the duration of the study. Plasma lactate concentrations increased rapidly in the control group from 0.86 ± 0.15 mm at base line to 1.42 ± 0.22 mm at 15 min (Fig. 2 D) but less rapidly in the high plasma FFA group (0.92 ± 0.07 mm at base line to 1.45 ± 0.24 at 90 min). Glucose infusion rates (Ginf) were 29.5 ± 0.7 and 27.2 ± 1.2 mg/kg/min at 15 min for control and high plasma FFA groups, respectively. While the Ginf in the high plasma FFA group contin"
https://openalex.org/W2087178990,"Abstract The p55 and p75 tumor necrosis factor receptors are known to mediate their effects on cells through distinct signaling pathways. Under certain circumstances, the two classes of TNF receptors cooperate with each another to produce enhanced cellular responses. The only molecular mechanism proposed thus far to explain this effect is the process of “ligand passing,” whereby TNF is concentrated at cell surfaces by binding to p75 and then following dissociation from this receptor class binds with high efficiency to p55. Using thein vivo model of TNF-induced TNF receptor shedding we have uncovered a novel ligand-dependent interaction of the two TNF receptors that occurs upon exposure of cells to TNF. Using TNF receptor-specific monoclonal antibodies that bind TNF receptors in the presence or absence of ligand, we report that TNF induces the formation of heterocomplexes consisting of both p55 and p75 TNF receptors. Whereas immunoprecipitates from untreated or human TNF-treated cells formed with either p55 or p75 TNF receptor-specific monoclonal antibodies contained only the relevant TNF receptor class, anti-p55 or anti-p75 precipitated both receptor types from murine TNF-treated cells. Ligand-induced complex formation was transient, occurred at physiologically relevant concentrations of TNF, and occurred with receptors lacking intracellular domains or that contained irrelevant transmembrane domains. Formation of TNF receptor heterocomplexes may therefore 1) define a novel molecular mechanism of ligand passing and/or 2) contribute to cooperative TNF receptor signaling via the juxtaposition of the intracellular domains of the two receptor classes and the signaling proteins that they recruit."
https://openalex.org/W1967247919,"Using murine AtT20 pituitary cells transfected with a rat pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) promoter (−706/+64) linked to the luciferase reporter, we showed leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) to strongly potentiate corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) induction of POMC gene expression. We therefore tested mechanisms for molecular interactions between LIF and CRH. Although LIF and CRH synergized to induce an 8-fold induction of POMC transcription, CRH alone (but not LIF) induced cAMP response element-binding protein phosphorylation (5-fold) or an increase of c-fos mRNA levels (>100-fold), suggesting that these pathways are not implicated in LIF transcriptional synergistic effects. Using a DNase I footprint assay, POMC promoter regions protected by AtT20 cell nuclear extracts were identified (−121/−109, and −143/−134, and −173/−160). The protected −173/−160 element fused to a heterologous promoter conferred LIF-CRH synergy (6.5-fold induction of POMC) and formed a specific complex with AtT20 cell nuclear extracts. This complex was supershifted by an anti-phosphoserine antibody, and a serine/threonine kinase inhibitor also altered both this complex and LIF-CRH transcriptional synergy on the POMC promoter-luciferase reporter construct, indicating that these events depend on post-translational serine phosphorylations.

Spiess J. Rivier C. Rivier J. Science. 1981; 213: 1394-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4009) Google Scholar). It stimulates transcription and biosynthesis of POMC, leading to increased adrenal glucocorticoid production (2Autelitano D.J. Lundblad J.R. Blum M. Roberts J.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 715-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). CRH acts through specific CRH receptors (G protein-coupled receptors) to activate adenylate cyclase, thereby increasing intracellular cAMP levels (3Miyazaki K. Reisine T. Kebabian J. Endocrinology. 1984; 115: 1933-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, although cAMP agonists also induce POMC transcription, the POMC gene does not contain a consensus cAMP response element (4Boutellier A.L. Monnier D. Lorang D. Lundblad J.R. Roberts J.L. Loeffler J.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 745-755PubMed Google Scholar). However, CRH also activates the c-fos proto-oncogene, implying cAMP and protein kinase A or Ca2+ and calmodulin kinase signaling (5Boutellier A.L. Sassone-Corsi P. Loeffler J.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1301-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a c-fos-binding element in POMC exon 1 (indistinguishable from an AP-1-binding site) has recently been identified to be responsible for part of the CRH transactivating effect on POMC transcription (4Boutellier A.L. Monnier D. Lorang D. Lundblad J.R. Roberts J.L. Loeffler J.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 745-755PubMed Google Scholar). Another CRH-inducible element centered at position −166 on the POMC promoter has also been described and could be responsible for c-fos-independent induction of POMC transcription by CRH (6Jin W.D.

Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2947-2953Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The biological functions of LIF are mediated through its binding to a high-affinity cell-surface LIF-receptor complex, consisting of a low-affinity LIF-binding subunit (LIF-R) and a gp130 subunit (13Gearing D.P. Thut C.J. Vanden Bos T. Gimpel S.D. Delaney P.B. King J. Price V. Cosman D. Beckmann M.P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2839-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Ligand activation of LIF-R is followed by gp130 and LIF-R heterodimerization and subsequent activation of tyrosine kinases (14Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Stahl N. Pan L. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Ip N.Y. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1993; 260: 1805-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). The Janus-activated kinase family of transmembrane receptor-associated tyrosine kinases is phosphorylated by LIF (15Stahl N. Boulton T.G. Farrugella T. Ip N.Y. Davis S. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Silvennoinen O. Barbieri G. Pellegrini S. Ihle J.N. Yancopoulous G.D. Science. 1994; 263: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar), leading to subsequent activation and translocation into the nucleus of STAT1α (signal transducer and activator oftranscription) and STAT3 (16Ray D.W. Ren S.G. Melmed S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1852-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 17Fu X.-Y. Cell. 1992; 70: 323-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 18Schindler C. Fu X.-Y. Improta T. Aebersold R. Darnell J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7836-7839Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 19Schuai K. Schindler C. Prezioso V.R. Darnell J.E. Science. 1992; 258: 1808-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). LIF also synergizes with CRH to induce secretion of ACTH (20-fold) and to stimulate POMC gene expression (8-fold) in AtT20 cells (16Ray D.W. Ren S.G. Melmed S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1852-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism for this potent synergy is difficult to explain as no specific cytokine response elements have thus far been identified in the POMC gene. In this study, we therefore explored mechanisms of interaction between the LIF and CRH signaling cascades to determine points of confluence that might explain the synergy exerted by both peptides on POMC transcription. We report here that LIF does not influence the cAMP/c-fos-dependent activation of POMC transcription by CRH. However, a LIF- and CRH-responsive element has been identified in the POMC gene (−173/−160) and is defined to be responsible for mediating LIF-CRH synergy on POMC transcription. AtT20 cells, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD), were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B (Life Technologies, Inc.). AtT20 cells were grown in 10-ml dishes to 80% confluency and serum-deprived 24 h before a 30-min treatment with LIF (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), CRH (American Peptide Co., Sunnyvale, CA), LIF and CRH, forskolin, or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma). Cells were then lysed by scraping into 2 × SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer. Samples were separated by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Milford, MA). The membrane was blocked in 5% nonfat milk. Anti-phospho-CREB detection was carried out with polyclonal anti-phosphorylated CREB antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) in blocking buffer for 14 h at 4 °C. Anti-rabbit Ig conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Corp.) was incubated with the membrane in blocking buffer, and detection was accomplished using ECL reagent (Amersham Corp.) as suggested by the manufacturer. To reprobe the membrane, the antibody was stripped using 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.7) at 50 °C for 30 min. Poly(A) RNA was prepared from AtT20 cells treated with LIF, CRH, or both using trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). 10 μg of RNA/lane was size-fractionated under denaturing conditions using formaldehyde-agarose (1.2%) gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and hybridized as described (20Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). A cDNA fragment of c-fos was used as a template for a32P-labeled probe generated using random primers. AtT20 cells were grown to 80% confluency and serum-deprived 24 h before a 1-h treatment with or without LIF, CRH, or both. Cells were then harvested in cold phosphate-buffered saline. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (21Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar). Final concentrations were typically 3 μg/μl as determined by Bio-Rad protein assay. A double-stranded DNA fragment was prepared by polymerase chain reaction. Briefly, the antisense primer was end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]dATP (6000 mCi/mmol; DuPont NEN), purified through a Bio-Spin 30 chromatography column (Bio-Rad), and used in the polymerase chain reaction. The −351/−7 region of the rat POMC promoter was also amplified and purified on a 1.3% agarose gel. DNA was recovered using a USBioclean kit. Nuclear extracts (0–50 μg) were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 1–2 ng of 32P-labeled DNA (25,000 cpm) in binding buffer (22 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 6 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm spermidine, 8% glycerol, and 2% Ficoll) with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC). Samples were briefly treated (1 min at room temperature) with DNase I (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), titrated to determine a partial digestion pattern. Digestion was terminated by addition of 3 volumes of 768 mmsodium acetate, 128 mm EDTA, 0.56% SDS, and 256 μg/ml yeast RNA and by treatment (5 min at 55 °C) with 2 μg of proteinase K. DNA was also extracted with phenol/CHCl3 and ethanol-precipitated. Reaction products were then analyzed on a standard 8 m urea, 8% polyacrylamide gel adjacent to a sequencing ladder (G + A) generated from the same end-labeled DNA fragment to precisely identify borders of DNase protection. All nucleotides were synthesized by the Cedars-Sinai Molecular Biology Core Facility. The superscript numbers are in reference to POMC promoter sequence with the transcription start site as position +1: oligonucleotide A,5′-−175tcgaTCTGCTGTGCGCGCAGCC−158-3′; oligonucleotide B, 5′-−189ACTTTCCAGGCACATCTGCTGT−168-3′; and oligonucleotide C, 5′-−167GCGCGCAGCCCCGACCGGGAAG−146-3′. 10 pmol of double-stranded oligonucleotide were end-labeled with [γ-32P]dATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase, purified through a Bio-Spin 30 chromatography column, resolved on a 10% acrylamide gel, and eluted from the gel in 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 8) and 1 mm EDTA. Approximately 30 pg of labeled DNA (20,000–30,000 cpm) were added to the nuclear extracts. For the binding assays, 7.5 μg of nuclear extracts were preincubated for 15 min at room temperature in 20 μl of binding buffer with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). 32P-Labeled probe was added, and the binding reaction was left at room temperature for 15 min. In competition experiments, a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides was added to the preincubation reaction. Antibody experiments were performed using 1 μl of anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Santa Cruz Bioreagents, Santa Cruz, CA) or 1 μl of anti-phosphoserine antibody (Sigma), which was added to the preincubation reaction and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × Tris borate/EDTA. Gels were dried and autoradiographed with intensifying screens at −70 °C with Amersham Hyperfilm-MP films. Deletion of the −167/−117 region of the POMC promoter was performed with an ExSite polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis kit (Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions. The −173/−160 element-luciferase plasmid was made by synthesizing two complementary DNA sequences (5′-tcgaTCTGCTGTGCGCGCAGC-3′), annealing, and ligating them into pGL3 (Promega) linearized at theKpnI/SacI site. All constructs were sequenced for verification. AtT20 cells were plated in 2-ml dishes (100,000 cells/well) and allowed to adhere for 24 h. Cells were transfected as described (16Ray D.W. Ren S.G. Melmed S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1852-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and 24 h after transfection, they were treated in triplicate for 6 h. After cell lysis, the luciferase activity was measured in a Berthold Lumat LB 9501 luminometer (Wallac, Gaithersburg, MD). Cotransfection of the β-galactosidase reporter showed transfection efficiency to vary <15% within a given experiment. Using the rat POMC promoter (−706/+64) fused to the luciferase reporter gene, we previously showed that LIF induced CRH action on rat POMC transcription (16Ray D.W. Ren S.G. Melmed S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1852-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To determine the specificity of LIF action, the transcriptional effects of other cytokines, notably TNFα and IL-1β, which are also induced by acute inflammatory insults (22Sapolsky R. Rivier C. Yamamoto G. Plotsky P. Vale W. Science. 1987; 238: 522-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar, 23Bernardini R. Kamilavis T.C. Calogero A.E. Johnson E.O. Gomez M.T. Gold P.W. Chrousos G.P. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 2876-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), were examined. AtT20 cells transiently transfected with the POMC promoter-luciferase construct were treated for 6 h with LIF (1 nm), CRH (10 nm), TNFα (1 ng/ml), IL-1β (100 pg/ml), or combinations of CRH and one of the other cytokines. Neither TNFα nor IL-1β alone exerted transcriptional effects, nor did they alter CRH induction of POMC (Fig. 1). Thus, there does not appear to be redundancy in the response of POMC to these inflammatory cytokines, i.e. the LIF synergistic effect with CRH on POMC transcription appears selective. Presumably, the specificity of the LIF response is determined by LIF receptor expression (11Akita S. Webster J. Ren S.-G. Takino H. Said J. Zand O. Melmed S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1288-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Urocortin, a novel neuropeptide related to both urotensin and CRH, activates CRH receptors and, in vivo, is a more powerful stimulant of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis than CRH (24Vaughan J. Donaldson C. Bittencourt J. Perrin M.H. Lewis K. Sutton S. Chan R. Turnbull A.V. Lovejoy D. Rivier C. Rivier J. Sawchenko P.E. Vale W. Nature. 1995; 378: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). We therefore examined urocortin transcriptional activity and demonstrated that it could also activate POMC transcription as well as potentiate LIF effects on POMC (Fig. 1). These results provide evidence for the role of CRH receptor subtype I (25Chen R. Lewis K.A. Perrin P.H. Vale W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8967-8971Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar) in modulating LIF action. Therefore, to determine points of confluence between the two signaling cascades, we explored the hypothesis by which LIF could enhance CRH signaling pathways leading to POMC transcription and ACTH secretion. CRH induction of POMC transcription was reported to be mediated through a cAMP pathway (3Miyazaki K. Reisine T. Kebabian J. Endocrinology. 1984; 115: 1933-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar,26Reisine T. Rougon G. Barbet J. Affolter H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8261-8266Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 27Luini A. Lewis D. Guild S. Corda D. Axelrod J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8034-8038Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 28Guild S. Reisine T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1987; 241: 125-129PubMed Google Scholar, 29Von Dreden G. Loeffler J.P. Grimm C. Hollt V. Neuroendocrinology. 1988; 47: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), although LIF itself did not alter AtT20 cAMP levels (16Ray D.W. Ren S.G. Melmed S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1852-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). cAMP signaling leads to phosphorylation of CREB and to a transient increase of c-fos mRNA levels (30Sheng M. Mc Fadden Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1990; 4: 571-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar, 31Sassone-Corsi P. Visvader J. Ferland L. Mellon P.L. Verma I. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1529-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 32Fisch T.M. Prywes R. Simon M.C. Roeder R.G. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 198-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether LIF could activate these two events. As CRH stimulates accumulation of cAMP and protein kinase A activation in target cells (16Ray D.W. Ren S.G. Melmed S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1852-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 26Reisine T. Rougon G. Barbet J. Affolter H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8261-8266Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we tested whether LIF altered CREB phosphorylation. Using an antibody that exclusively recognizes the phosphorylated form of CREB (33Ginty D.D. Kornhauser J.M. Thompson M.A. Bading H. Mayo K.E. Takahashi J.S. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1993; 260: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar), CRH (10 nm), but not LIF (1 nm), induced a striking increase (>5-fold) in the proportion of intracellular phosphorylated CREB within 30 min (Fig. 2): a doublet that migrated with the 43-kDa marker, the expected size for CREB, was detected by an anti-phospho-CREB antibody. These two inducible bands may be CREBα and CREBΔ, which differ in sequence by 14 amino acids (33Ginty D.D. Kornhauser J.M. Thompson M.A. Bading H. Mayo K.E. Takahashi J.S. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1993; 260: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). These changes were not accompanied by increases in the amount of total intracellular CREB, as measured by an antibody recognizing all forms of CREB. Interestingly, although LIF and CRH powerfully synergize to stimulate POMC expression, LIF does not further enhance CREB phosphorylation over that observed with CRH treatment. We concluded that CREB phosphorylation is therefore not a molecular event responsible for LIF synergistic effects on CRH-induced POMC transcription. c-fos is a member of a family of related acute-phase transcription factors that form heterodimers to bind DNA and activate transcription (34Chin R. Boyle W.J. Meek J. Smeal T. Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1988; 54: 541-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). c-fos mRNA accumulation occurs during treatment of AtT20 cells with CRH, and overexpression of c-fos results in enhanced POMC transcription (5Boutellier A.L. Sassone-Corsi P. Loeffler J.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1301-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition, LIF may, in some systems, enhance c-fos transcription (35Wollert K.C. Taga T. Saito M. Narazaki M. Kishimoto T. Glembotski C.C. Vernallis A.B. Heath J.K. Pennica D. Wood W.I. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9535-9545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Therefore, changes in c-fos mRNA were analyzed after cells were treated for 15 min with LIF and CRH (1 and 10 nm, respectively). Striking inductions (>100-fold) of c-fos mRNA after CRH treatment were observed, in keeping with previous reports (5Boutellier A.L. Sassone-Corsi P. Loeffler J.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1301-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, in these cells, LIF alone failed to induce c-fos expression and furthermore failed to enhance the CRH effect on c-fosmRNA levels (Fig. 3). Therefore, although c-fos may play a role in mediating CRH action, it does not appear to be important for LIF action or, more significantly, for mediating the strong synergy between LIF and CRH. In addition, c-fos has been shown to stimulate POMC transcription through an AP-1 site located in exon 1 of the POMC promoter. Using this site as a probe in the gel-shift assay or a construct containing the POMC promoter mutated at this site and fused to the luciferase reporter, we showed this site not to be critical in the context of LIF and CRH synergy on POMC transcription (data not shown). CRH may also induce POMC transcription and ACTH secretion by a c-fos-independent pathway (4Boutellier A.L. Monnier D. Lorang D. Lundblad J.R. Roberts J.L. Loeffler J.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 745-755PubMed Google Scholar). A region in the POMC promoter (−171/−160), different from the exon 1 AP-1 site, was shown to confer strong CRH stimulation on POMC transcription (6Jin W.D. Boutellier A.L. Glucksman M.J. Salton S.R.J. Loeffler J.P. Roberts J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1377-1399PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore explored whether this element could be the point of convergence of the CRH and LIF pathways. Using a DNase I footprint assay, we examined POMC promoter regions whose DNase sensitivity was protected by bound nuclear proteins present in AtT20 whole cell extracts previously treated for 1 h with CRH (10 nm), LIF (1 nm), and LIF + CRH (1 and 10 nm, respectively) (Fig. 4). We focused on −351/−7 footprinting sequences as this region contains the important regulatory element for the synergy of LIF-CRH on POMC transcription (16Ray D.W. Ren S.G. Melmed S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1852-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). 50 μg of AtT20 cell nuclear extracts protected three elements (−109/−121, −134/−143, and −173/−160) in this region, both in the basal state and after stimulation of the cells by LIF, CRH, or both agents together. These regions have previously been designated as potential overlapping AP-2- and NF-κB-binding sites (−134/−143 element) (6Jin W.D. Boutellier A.L. Glucksman M.J. Salton S.R.J. Loeffler J.P. Roberts J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1377-1399PubMed Google Scholar) and as a mouse metallothionein metal regulatory element (−173/−160 element) (6Jin W.D. Boutellier A.L. Glucksman M.J. Salton S.R.J. Loeffler J.P. Roberts J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1377-1399PubMed Google Scholar). However, we also found that no additional regions were further protected after treatment of the cells with both LIF and CRH compared with LIF or CRH alone. To further analyze whether these regions could be important for the synergy of LIF-CRH on POMC transcription, we performed functional assays by transfecting AtT20 cells treated with LIF (1 nm) and CRH (10 nm) for 6 h with the rat POMC promoter lacking the −167/−117 region and fused to a luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 5). This deletion reduced basal promoter activity and also severely reduced the LIF-CRH synergy (61.5%) on reporter activity. We therefore fused the −173/−160 element to the same luciferase reporter gene with a heterologous SV40 promoter (Fig. 5). We focused on this element first because of its identification during footprint analysis and also because of previous work demonstrating that this region was bound by a CRH-inducible factor and was the major CRH-responsive element in the POMC promoter (6Jin W.D. Boutellier A.L. Glucksman M.J. Salton S.R.J. Loeffler J.P. Roberts J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1377-1399PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, CRH exerted its positive regulation of transcription, but surprisingly, LIF and CRH together strongly enhanced this induction (6.5-fold), thus conferring LIF responsiveness to the heterologous construct. To confirm these results, we analyzed binding protein states in the −173/−160 region by using AtT20 whole cell extracts (after cell treatment with LIF, CRH, or both) and a radioactive probe comprising this element using a gel-shift assay. Nuclear extracts from control, CRH-treated (10 nm, 60 min), LIF-treated (1 nm, 60 min), or (LIF + CRH)-treated (1 and 10 nm, respectively; 60 min) AtT20 cells were prepared as described under “Materials and Methods.” These extracts were also shown to bind efficiently to oligonucleotide A, containing the region (−173/−160) important for the LIF + CRH induction of POMC transcription (Fig.6 A). In fact, three complexes were shifted, and therefore, to determine the exact binding localization of each on the A probe, two oligonucleotides were designed: B and C. After addition of B and C sequences, the entire A nucleotide sequence was covered without overlap, while A–C were the same size. From these experiments, we concluded that only the slowest migrating band (designated Y) was specific for the −167/−158 region as it appeared only with the A and C probes (Fig. 6, A and C, respectively). The “intermediate” complex (designated I) seemed to bind the −175/−168 region (overlapping region between the A and B probes) (Fig. 6, A and B), but was not further considered because of its diffuse nature. The faster migrating band (designated L) was not specific for any region as it appeared with all three probes (A–C) (Fig. 6, A–C). To analyze the binding specificity of the Y complex on the A probe, competition experiments were performed (Fig. 7). The Y complex was shown to be efficiently competed by unlabeled oligonucleotide A (100-fold molar excess) (Fig. 7, lanes 5and 7), whereas an AP-1 oligonucleotide was inefficient in competing (lanes 9–11). The binding specificity of the Y complex on the −167/−158 motif was further confirmed by a less efficient competition with a unlabeled oligonucleotide similar to oligonucleotide A except that it contained a mutation at GCGC (−167/−164) (Fig. 7, lanes 12–14). This −167/−164 region must therefore be at least a component of the binding site of the Y complex. In addition, competition experiments with unlabeled oligonucleotides B and C further strengthened the binding specificity of the Y complex on the −167/−158 region as oligonucleotide B did not compete this binding, whereas oligonucleotide C competed effectively (Fig. 6 A, lanes 6 and 7). In addition, Figs. 6 A and 7 show that greater amounts of the shifted Y complex were detected in assays that contained nuclear extracts from AtT20 cells treated with CRH for 60 min as compared with untreated cell extracts. No quantitative enhancement of the shifted Y complex was observed with extracts from AtT20 cells treated with LIF + CRH for 60 min as compared with those treated with CRH alone for 60 min. We also concluded that LIF, at the concentrations used and for the duration of the treatments, did not further enhance CRH-induced complex shifts or the amount of Y complex. LIF and CRH may also act through the same binding element (−173/−160) by activating similar transcription factor(s) by modifying their conformation or phosphorylation state. Indeed, no significant correlation was observed between the quantitative binding state of these proteins on the −173/−160 element after cell treatment with CRH, LIF, or both or in the corresponding stimulation of POMC transcription in experiments where the −173/−160 element was fused to the heterologous SV40-luciferase reporter gene. The time-dependent activation of the Y complex by both cytokines suggested a post-translational regulation. To explore this hypothesis, we analyzed POMC transcription i"

This PIC can function as coupled antiport (Pi−/Pi− antiport and Pi− net transport, i.e.Pi−/OH− antiport) and uncoupled uniport (mercuric chloride-induced Pi−efflux). The basic kinetic properties of these three transport modes were analyzed. The kinetic properties closely resemble those of the reconstituted PIC from beef heart mitochondria. A competitive inhibitor of phosphate transport by the PIC, phosphonoformic acid, was used to establish functional overlap between the the physiological transport modes and the induced efflux mode. Replacement mutants were used to relate the reversible switch from antiport to uniport to a specific residue of the carrier. There are only three cysteines in the yeast PIC. They are at positions 28, 134, and 300 and were replaced by serine, both individually and in combinations. Cysteine 300 near the C-terminal loop and cysteine 134 located within the third transmembrane segment are accessible to bulky hydrophilic reagents from the cytosolic side, whereas cysteine 28 within the first transmembrane segment is not. None of the three cysteines is relevant to the two antiport modes. Cysteine 134 was identified to be the major target of bulky SH reagents, that lead to complete inactivation of the physiological transport modes. The reversible conversion between coupled antiport and uncoupled uniport of the PIC depends on the presence of one single cysteine (cysteine 28) in the PIC monomer, i.e. two cysteines in the functionally active dimer. The consequences of this result with respect to a functional model of the carrier protein are discussed.

The primary structure of the beef heart PIC was elucidated by protein (Aquilaet al., 1987) and DNA sequencing (33Runswick M.J. Powell S.J. Nyren P. Walker J.E. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1367-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and the PIC gene was cloned and sequenced fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae (30Phelps A. Wohlrab H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19882-19885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PIC is a typical member of the structural family of mitochondrial carriers with six transmembrane segments (1Aquila H. Link T.A. Klingenberg M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2369-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar; 24Kuan J. Saier M.H. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

Procedures have been described to solubilize the PIC from inclusion bodies in a functionally active state (45Wohlrab H. Briggs C.

PIC catalyzes both homologous Pi−/Pi− as well as heterologous Pi−/OH−antiport with high activity (46Wohlrab H. Flowers N. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 28-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; 36Stappen R. Krämer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1149: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 37Stappen R. Krämer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11240-11246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transport kinetics using bireactant initial velocity studies identify the PIC as a member of the mitochondrial carrier family also in functional terms. Its mechanism is of the simultaneous (sequential) type, involving a ternary complex in transport catalysis that requires the binding of two ligands at the same time (37Stappen R. Krämer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11240-11246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An additional property that places the PIC into this functional family is its ability to switch to uniport (efflux) activity after chemical modification with some mercurial reagents (36Stappen R. Krämer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1149: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It was previously shown that the aspartate/glutamate carrier (Dierkset al., 1990a), the ADP/ATP carrier (10Dierks T. Salentin A. Krämer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1028: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and the carnitine carrier (16Indiveri C. Tonazzi A. Palmieri F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1069: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) can reversibly be converted by mercurial reagents from coupled antiport to uncoupled uniport, a function that comprises both carrier-like and channel-like properties. An analysis of this conversion, specifically with the aspartate/glutamate carrier, identified the involvement of at least two cysteines and was interpreted to reveal an intrinsic preformed channel structure as a common element in those carriers (10Dierks T. Salentin A. Krämer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1028: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These kinds of structural domains had already been postulated on the basis of functional considerations (20Klingenberg M. Nature. 1981; 290: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) as well as of transport experiments (4Brustovetsky N. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8483-8488Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar).The aim of the present work was to relate the reversible switch from coupled antiport to uncoupled uniport to a specific residue of the carrier protein by using replacement mutagenesis of the yeast PIC expressed in E. coli. This technique has already been used to identify a number of other residues, which are important for the carrier's physiological function with respect to substrate recognition and inhibitor interaction (45Wohlrab H. Briggs C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9371-9375Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar; 32Phelps A. Briggs C. Mincone L. Wohlrab H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10757-10762Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We demonstrate now that the conversion between antiport and uniport of the PIC exclusively depends on the presence of cysteine 28 in the PIC monomer, i.e. two cysteine 28 residues in the functionally active dimer.DISCUSSIONThe mitochondrial PIC can reversibly be switched from coupled antiport to uncoupled uniport. We have used replacement mutants of the yeast PIC expressed in E. coli to relate this switch to specific residues of this protein. The involvement of cysteine residues in this switch can most appropriately be studied with the yeast PIC, since 1) it has only three cysteines versus eight in the beef heart PIC used in earlier studies, and 2) its preparation is facilitated with E. coli inclusion bodies. We have shown that the yeast PIC, isolated and purified from inclusion bodies, solubilized by SLS and reconstituted into liposomes resembles the beef heart PIC in all the relevant functional aspects.The mercuric chloride-induced uniport has now been definitely identified with the reconstituted PIC. Contaminating mitochondrial channel proteins cannot be responsible for this activity since the PICs are heterologously expressed. Furthermore, we found that PFA, a competitive inhibitor of Pi−/Pi− antiport, effectively inhibits also the induced uniport mode. Since PFA stimulates Pi−/OH−(Pi− net transport), we conclude that it is a transport substrate of the PIC. PFA is not available in labeled form, and thus its true substrate properties could not be directly investigated. Nevertheless, its effect on the mercuric chloride-induced Pi− efflux can be taken as a further indication that the external binding site of the reconstituted PIC has retained its properties. This site, as shown earlier, is the cytosolic site of the PIC (36Stappen R. Krämer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1149: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).It has been shown for many other carrier proteins that cysteines are not essential for basic transport functions (39van Iwaarden P.R. Pastore J.C. Konings W.N. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9595-9600Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 40van Iwaarden P.R. Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1113: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The present results permit us to characterize the functional significance of the yeast PIC cysteines (Fig.6). Cys-300 does not seem to be relevant for transport activity or for uniport induction. We did, however, detect a 50% reduction of transport after its replacement by serine. No additional changes were observed in combination with the Cys-134 → Ser replacement. Cys-134 is responsible for inhibition of all transport modes by mersalylic acid and also by pCMBS. A comparison with published effects on the PIC (36Stappen R. Krämer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1149: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) makes it likely that Cys-134 is also responsible for inhibition by 5,5-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). Although a reaction of mersalyl with Cys-300 seems to be responsible for a slight reduction in antiport activity by the Cys-134 → Ser mutant relative to the Cys-134 → Ser/Cys-300 → Ser and the Cys-28 → Ser/Cys-134 → Ser/Cys-300 → Ser mutants, it is obvious that the major target of mersalyl is Cys-134. The reactivities of the cysteines indicate that Cys-134 (and presumably also Cys-300) is accessible to large, hydrophilic ligands, whereas Cys-28 is accessible only to the small Hg2+ ion. This was documented by the observation that mercurials other than HgCl2 did not affect the reaction of Hg2+ with Cys-28. Whereas the accessibility of Cys-300 from the external (cytosolic) side seems obvious, this is not so for Cys-134. Our results suggest that Cys-134 is in an aqueous environment with connected to the cytosolic side of the protein, whereas Cys-28 is not. Interestingly, Cys-28 has previously been found to be the target for inhibition of phosphate transport by oxygen (31Phelps A. Wohlrab H. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 321Google Scholar). In a recent paper, furthermore, His-32, Glu-126, and Glu-137 were found to be essential for a coupled phosphate/H+ pathway in the PIC (32Phelps A. Briggs C. Mincone L. Wohlrab H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10757-10762Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In fact, these residues line up at the same side of helices A and C, in which Cys-28 and Cys-134 are located. It may be questioned whether a reaction of HgCl2with other residues besides cysteine should be considered. This has in fact been analyzed in detail with respect to the aspartate/glutamate carrier, where a functionally significant reaction was found to be confined to cysteine residues (9Dierks T. Salentin A. Heberger C. Krämer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1028: 68-280Google Scholar, 10Dierks T. Salentin A. Krämer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1028: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In any case, the specific action on Cys-28 and Cys-134 of the PIC was proven here by the absence of these effects in the mutants lacking these cysteines.Most interesting, however, is the observation that the reversible switch from the physiological transport modes to the unphysiological and mercuric chloride-induced uniport depends on the presence of Cys-28. This functional shift from antiport to uniport, which is correlated with the appearance of some channel-type functions, has been observed in several mitochondrial carriers, namely the aspartate/glutamate, the ADP/ATP (9Dierks T. Salentin A. Heberger C. Krämer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1028: 68-280Google Scholar;10Dierks T. Salentin A. Krämer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1028: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and the carnitine carrier (16Indiveri C. Tonazzi A. Palmieri F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1069: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The present results, however, for the first time correlate a specific residue with this phenomenon. The observation that mitochondrial carriers retain their original activation energy of transport after this functional switch was interpreted to indicate that a similar conformational change occurs during solute transfer both in the antiport and the mercuric chloride-induced uniport (15Herick K. Krämer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1238: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Modification of Cys-28 by HgCl2 yields a loss of specificity of ligand interaction at the internal PIC binding site. No such loss of the external binding site is observed (10Dierks T. Salentin A. Krämer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1028: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar; 36Stappen R. Krämer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1149: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In conclusion, our findings suggest that Cys-28 may possess a gating function on the matrix side of the PIC.There is evidence from a large number of investigations that the structural basis for differences in the mechanisms of coupling among antiport, symport and uniport in secondary systems and differences between carrier and channel-type of functions may be very subtle (27Nikaido H. Saier M.H. Science. 1992; 258: 936-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar; 21Krämer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1185: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, for example, a single amino acid replacement in the bacterial lactose carrier (Lac-permease) shifts its transport from a coupled to an uncoupled mechanism (12Eelkema J.A. O'Donnell M.A. Brooker R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4139-4144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; 19King S.C. Wilson T.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1433-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar;17Kaback H.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 137A: 97-125Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a number of studies using electrophysiological techniques provide evidence for channel properties in carrier proteins, e.g. neurotransmitter transporters (5Cammack J.N. Schwartz E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar; 6DeFelice L.J. Blakely R.D. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 579-580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the chloroplast triose phosphate carrier (34Schwarz M. Gross A. Steinkamp T. Flugge U.I. Wagner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29481-29489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier (38Tikhonova I.M. Andreyev A.Y. Antonenko Y.N. Kaulen A.D. Komrakov A.Y. Skulachev V.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar; 4Brustovetsky N. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8483-8488Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). This concept is particularly attractive in view of the fact that conditions are known where large pores appear in the inner mitochondrial membrane (permeability transition pore, “megachannel”) (47Zoratti M. Szabo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2182) Google Scholar; 3Bernardi P. Petronilli V. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Taken together, the distinction between “carrier-type” and “channel-type” of transport mechanisms seems to become minimal, when analyzed in terms of functional elements in both types of solute transport systems (27Nikaido H. Saier M.H. Science. 1992; 258: 936-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar; 21Krämer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1185: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar; 6DeFelice L.J. Blakely R.D. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 579-580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).The data presented here prove that the reversible shift between the coupled and the uncoupled transport mode of the mitochondrial PIC only depends on the modification of a single cysteine. It has to be pointed out, however, that mitochondrial carrier proteins are functional dimers, i.e. there are two cysteines at position 28. Interestingly, earlier investigations of the aspartate/glutamate carrier indicated that the modification of two cysteine residues is necessary for the reversible shift from antiport to uniport (9Dierks T. Salentin A. Heberger C. Krämer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1028: 68-280Google Scholar; 10Dierks T. Salentin A. Krämer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1028: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Although the primary structure of the aspartate/glutamate carrier is not yet known and thus the two cysteines have not been identified, it is obvious that, on the basis of the apparently common mechanism of this antiport/uniport conversion in mitochondrial carriers, the two results are related. Consequently, studying the functional involvement of the two cysteines located in the two homologous monomers of mitochondrial carrier proteins may be an interesting clue for understanding the crosstalk of the individual subunits during transport catalysis. The mitochondrial phosphate carrier (PIC) 1The abbreviations used are: PIC, phosphate carrier; DTT, dithiothreitol; pCMBS,p-(chloromercuri)benzenesulfonate; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; PFA, phosphonoformic acid; SLS, sodium lauroylsarcosinate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: PIC, phosphate carrier; DTT, dithiothreitol; pCMBS,p-(chloromercuri)benzenesulfonate; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; PFA, phosphonoformic acid; SLS, sodium lauroylsarcosinate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. catalyzes transport of inorganic phosphate into the mitochondrial matrix where the phosphate is utilized for phosphorylating ADP to ATP (25LaNoue K.F.

Acta. 1992; 1113: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The present results permit us to characterize the functional significance of the yeast PIC cysteines (Fig.6). Cys-300 does not seem to be relevant for transport activity or for uniport induction. We did, however, detect a 50% reduction of transport after its replacement by serine. No additional changes were observed in combination with the Cys-134 → Ser replacement. Cys-134 is responsible for inhibition of all transport modes by mersalylic acid and also by pCMBS. A comparison with published effects on the PIC (36Stappen R. Krämer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1149: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) makes it likely that Cys-134 is also responsible for inhibition by 5,5-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). Although a reaction of mersalyl with Cys-300 seems to be responsible for a slight reduction in antiport activity by the Cys-134 → Ser mutant relative to the Cys-134 → Ser/Cys-300 → Ser and the Cys-28 → Ser/Cys-134 → Ser/Cys-300 → Ser mutants, it is obvious that the major target of mersalyl is Cys-134. The reactivities of the cysteines indicate that Cys-134 (and presumably also Cys-300) is accessible to large, hydrophilic ligands, whereas Cys-28 is accessible only to the small Hg2+ ion. This was documented by the observation that mercurials other than HgCl2 did not affect the reaction of Hg2+ with Cys-28. Whereas the accessibility of Cys-300 from the external (cytosolic) side seems obvious, this is not so for Cys-134. Our results suggest that Cys-134 is in an aqueous environment with connected to the cytosolic side of the protein, whereas Cys-28 is not. Interestingly, Cys-28 has previously been found to be the target for inhibition of phosphate transport by oxygen (31Phelps A. Wohlrab H. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 321Google Scholar). In a recent paper, furthermore, His-32, Glu-126, and Glu-137 were found to be essential for a coupled phosphate/H+ pathway in the PIC (32Phelps A. Briggs C. Mincone L. Wohlrab H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10757-10762Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In fact, these residues line up at the same side of helices A and C, in which Cys-28 and Cys-134 are located. It may be questioned whether a reaction of HgCl2with other residues besides cysteine should be considered. This has in fact been analyzed in detail with respect to the aspartate/glutamate carrier, where a functionally significant reaction was found to be confined to cysteine residues (9Dierks T. Salentin A. Heberger C. Krämer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1028: 68-280Google Scholar, 10Dierks T. Salentin A. Krämer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1028: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In any case, the specific action on Cys-28 and Cys-134 of the PIC was proven here by the absence of these effects in the mutants lacking these cysteines.Most interesting, however, is the observation that the reversible switch from the physiological transport modes to the unphysiological and mercuric chloride-induced uniport depends on the presence of Cys-28. This functional shift from antiport to uniport, which is correlated with the appearance of some channel-type functions, has been observed in several mitochondrial carriers, namely the aspartate/glutamate, the ADP/ATP (9Dierks T. Salentin A. Heberger C. Krämer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1028: 68-280Google Scholar;10Dierks T. Salentin A. Krämer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1028: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and the carnitine carrier (16Indiveri C. Tonazzi A. Palmieri F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1069: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The present results, however, for the first time correlate a specific residue with this phenomenon. The observation that mitochondrial carriers retain their original activation energy of transport after this functional switch was interpreted to indicate that a similar conformational change occurs during solute transfer both in the antiport and the mercuric chloride-induced uniport (15Herick K. Krämer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1238: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Modification of Cys-28 by HgCl2 yields a loss of specificity of ligand interaction at the internal PIC binding site. No such loss of the external binding site is observed (10Dierks T. Salentin A. Krämer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1028: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar; 36Stappen R. Krämer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1149: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In conclusion, our findings suggest that Cys-28 may possess a gating function on the matrix side of the PIC.There is evidence from a large number of investigations that the structural basis for differences in the mechanisms of coupling among antiport, symport and uniport in secondary systems and differences between carrier and channel-type of functions may be very subtle (27Nikaido H. Saier M.H. Science. 1992; 258: 936-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar; 21Krämer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1185: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, for example, a single amino acid replacement in the bacterial lactose carrier (Lac-permease) shifts its transport from a coupled to an uncoupled mechanism (12Eelkema J.A. O'Donnell M.A. Brooker R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4139-4144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; 19King S.C. Wilson T.H. Mol.

Furthermore, a number of studies using electrophysiological techniques provide evidence for channel properties in carrier proteins, e.g. neurotransmitter transporters (5Cammack J.N. Schwartz E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar; 6DeFelice L.J. Blakely R.D. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 579-580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the chloroplast triose phosphate carrier (34Schwarz M. Gross A. Steinkamp T. Flugge U.I. Wagner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29481-29489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier (38Tikhonova I.M. Andreyev A.Y. Antonenko Y.N. Kaulen A.D. Komrakov A.Y. Skulachev V.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar; 4Brustovetsky N. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8483-8488Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). This concept is particularly attractive in view of the fact that conditions are known where large pores appear in the inner mitochondrial membrane (permeability transition pore, “megachannel”) (47Zoratti M. Szabo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2182) Google Scholar; 3Bernardi P. Petronilli V. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Taken together, the distinction between “carrier-type” and “channel-type” of transport mechanisms seems to become minimal, when analyzed in terms of functional elements in both types of solute transport systems (27Nikaido H. Saier M.H. Science. 1992; 258: 936-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar; 21Krämer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1185: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar; 6DeFelice L.J. Blakely R.D. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 579-580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).The data presented here prove that the reversible shift between the coupled and the uncoupled transport mode of the mitochondrial PIC only depends on the modification of a single cysteine. It has to be pointed out, however, that mitochondrial carrier proteins are functional dimers, i.e. there are two cysteines at position 28. Interestingly, earlier investigations of the aspartate/glutamate carrier indicated that the modification of two cysteine residues is necessary for the reversible shift from antiport to uniport (9Dierks T. Salentin A. Heberger C. Krämer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1028: 68-280Google Scholar; 10Dierks T. Salentin A. Krämer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1028: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Although the primary structure of the aspartate/glutamate carrier is not yet known and thus the two cysteines have not been identified, it is obvious that, on the basis of the apparently common mechanism of this antiport/uniport conversion in mitochondrial carriers, the two results are related. Consequently, studying the functional involvement of the two cysteines located in the two homologous monomers of mitochondrial carrier proteins may be an interesting clue for understanding the crosstalk of the individual subunits during transport catalysis. The mitochondrial PIC can reversibly be switched from coupled antiport to uncoupled uniport. We have used replacement mutants of the yeast PIC expressed in E. coli to relate this switch to specific residues of this protein. The involvement of cysteine residues in this switch can most appropriately be studied with the yeast PIC, since 1) it has only three cysteines versus eight in the beef heart PIC used in earlier studies, and 2) its preparation is facilitated with E. coli inclusion bodies. We have shown that the yeast PIC, isolated and purified from inclusion bodies, solubilized by SLS and reconstituted into liposomes resembles the beef heart PIC in all the relevant functional aspects. The mercuric chloride-induced uniport has now been definitely identified with the reconstituted PIC. Contaminating mitochondrial channel proteins cannot be responsible for this activity since the PICs are heterologously expressed. Furthermore, we found that PFA, a competitive inhibitor of Pi−/Pi− antiport, effectively inhibits also the induced uniport mode. Since PFA stimulates Pi−/OH−(Pi− net transport), we conclude that it is a transport substrate of the PIC. PFA is not available in labeled form, and thus its true substrate properties could not be directly investigated. Nevertheless, its effect on the mercuric chloride-induced Pi− efflux can be taken as a further indication that the external binding site of the reconstituted PIC has retained its properties. This site, as shown earlier, is the cytosolic site of the PIC (36Stappen R. Krämer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1149: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It has been shown for many other carrier proteins that cysteines are not essential for basic transport functions (39van Iwaarden P.R. Pastore J.C. Konings W.N. Kaback H.R.

RGL shares 50% amino acid identity with Ral GDP dissociation stimulator and contains the CDC25-like domain in the central region and the Ras-interacting domain in the C-terminal region. Since the modes of activation and action of RGL have not yet been clarified, in this paper we have analyzed the functions of RGL. In COS cells, RGL interacted with RasG12V/E37G (a Ras mutant in which Gly-12 and Glu-37 were changed to Val and Gly, respectively) which failed to bind to Raf, but not with RasG12V/T35S which bound to Raf. Raf did not inhibit the binding of RGL to RasG12V/E37G under the condition that Raf inhibited that of RGL to RasG12V. Expression of either RGL or Raf into NIH3T3 cells slightly activated c-fos promoter, while coexpression of both proteins greatly stimulated the c-fos promoter activity. RGL stimulated the GDP/GTP exchange of Ral and this action was enhanced by the post-translational modification of Ral. However, RGL was not active on Ras, Rac, CDC42, Rap, or Rho. Furthermore, this action of RGL to stimulate the GDP/GTP exchange of Ral was dependent on Ras in COS cells. These results suggest that RGL constitutes another Ras-signaling pathway which is distinct from the Raf pathway and indicate that the RGL pathway regulates the c-fos promoter activity and the GDP/GTP exchange of Ral.

Ras binds to Raf and promotes the activation of Raf, which in turn activates MAP kinase kinase, which then triggers the activation of MAP kinase. Activated MAP kinase in turn translocates to the nucleus, where it phosphorylates and regulates the activities of nuclear transcription factors which cause changes in gene expression that controls cell proliferation. Recent biochemical and biological evidence has implicated a second Ras-mediated signaling pathway which is distinct from the Raf/MAP kinase pathway and involves Rho family members, Rho, Rac, and CDC42 (15Qiu R.G.

Furthermore, the experiments using the effector loop mutants of Ras have suggested that Ras interacts with diverse effector proteins in the same cells (19Khosravi-Far R. White M.A. Westwick J.K.

Science. 1996; 271: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar).In vitro and yeast two-hybrid studies have shown that RasG12V/T35S (a Ras mutant in which Gly-12 and Thr-35 are changed to Val and Ser, respectively) binds to Raf, RalGDS, RGL, and AF6, that RasG12V/E37G interacts with RalGDS, RGL, yeast byr2, adenylyl cyclase, and AF6, and that RasG12V/Y40Cassociates with AF6. Furthermore, RasG12V/T35S and RasG12V/Y40C activate Raf and Rac, respectively, and these Ras effector loop mutants cooperate to promote DNA synthesis in mammalian cells. Consistent with these results, coexpression of Raf and Rac induces transformation synergistically (15Qiu R.G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M. Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Therefore, the Ras effector pathways could cooperate to exert the functions of Ras. We have identified RGL as a Ras-interacting protein (5Kikuchi A. Demo S.D. Ye Z.H. Chen Y.W. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7483-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). RGL shares 50% amino acid identity with RalGDS (5Kikuchi A. Demo S.D. Ye Z.H. Chen Y.W. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7483-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 23Albright C.F. Giddings B.W. Liu J. Vito M. Weinberg R.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). RGL contains the Ras-interacting domain in the C-terminal region, named RID. RID binds to an active form of Rap, which is a member of the small G protein superfamily and possesses the same amino acid sequence as the effector loop of Ras (24Ikeda M. Koyama S. Okazaki M. Dohi K. Kikuchi A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Expression of RID into Ras- but not Raf-transformed NIH3T3 cells reverses the malignant phenotypes such as growth in low serum condition and anchorage independence (25Okazaki M. Kishida S. Murai H. Hinoi T. Kikuchi A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2387-2392PubMed Google Scholar), and injection of RID into Xenopus oocytes inhibits Ras-dependent maturation and MAP kinase activation (26Koyama S. Chen Y.W. Ikeda M. Muslin A.J. Williams L.T. Kikuchi A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, RID has been well characterized and known to interact with the effector loop of an active form of Ras. Therefore, RGL could mediate some of Ras functions. The amino acid sequence of RGL shows that it contains the CDC25-like domain. Several GDP/GTP exchange proteins including CDC25, SOS, SCD25, Ste6, BUD5, LTE1, C3G, and RalGDS share the CDC25-like domain (23Albright C.F. Giddings B.W. Liu J. Vito M. Weinberg R.A.

However, the functions of RGL are not known since the studies using the full-length of RGL have not yet been done. In this paper we have examined the roles of RGL in the Ras-signaling pathway. We show that RGL constitutes the Ras-mediated signaling pathway which is distinct from the Raf pathway and that it cooperates with Raf to activate c-fos promoter. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RGL stimulates the GDP/GTP exchange of Ral, that the post-translational modification of Ral is important for this action of RGL, and that Ras regulates the RGL activity. These results indicate that RGL mediates the Ras signals to stimulate the gene expression and activate Ral. pBJ-1, pCGN, pfos-luc (a reporter vector in which the expression of luciferase is controlled by c-fos promoter) (33Hu Q.

Briefly, the transformedE. coli were initially grown at 37 °C to an absorbance of 0.5 (optical density at 600 nm) and subsequently transferred to 20 °C, then isopropyl-1-β-d-galactopyranoside was added at a final concentration of 0.1 or 0.3 mm and further incubation was carried out for 16 h at 20 °C.

Chem. 1994; 269: 20054-20059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the proteins of the lysates (240 μg of protein) were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Ras antibody. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204281) Google Scholar), transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and probed with the anti-HA or Ras (F235) antibody. COS cells (60–70% confluent on a 60-mm diameter plate) were transfected with pBJ and pEF-Bos derived constructs described above using the DEAE-dextran method (41Gorman C. A Practical Approach.in: Glover D.M. IRL Press, Oxford1985Google Scholar). After 60 h, the cells were lysed as described (38Kikuchi A. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 588-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and proteins of the lysates (160 μg of protein) were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Ras antibody. Y13–238 was used in the immunoprecipitation experiments except for Fig. 1 B (lane 7), where Y13–259 was used. The precipitates were probed with the anti-Myc or Ras (F235) antibody. To make immobilized RGL-(602–768) on amylose resin, 130 μg of MBP-RGL-(602–768) was incubated with 200 μl of amylose resin in 500 μl of reaction mixture (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, and 200 mm NaCl) for 2 h at 4 °C. The resin was precipitated by centrifugation and washed with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) three times. To make the [35S]GTPγS-bound form of Ras effector loop mutants, each of Ras mutants (25 pmol) was incubated with 10 μm[35S]GTPγS (20,000 cpm/pmol) for 15 min at 30 °C in 40 μl of reaction mixture (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT). After the incubation, 1 mMgCl2 was added at a final concentration of 20 mm. The [35S]GTPγS-bound form of Ras mutants were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with immobilized RGL-(602–768) (50 pmol) in 140 μl of reaction mixture (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 10 μm GTPγS) in the presence or absence of GST-Raf-(1–149). Immobilized RGL-(602–768) were precipitated by centrifugation, the precipitated resin was washed, and the remaining radioactivities were counted. NIH3T3 cells (40–50% confluent on a 35-mm diameter plate) were transfected with the plasmid DNA (2 μg) containing pfos-luc (1 μg) and the indicated plasmids using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). After 60 h, the cells were lysed and luciferase activity was measured using the PicaGene luciferase assay system (Toyo B-NET. Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was expressed as the fold increase compared with the level observed with empty vector. To examine the transfection efficiency, pGL2 (a reporter vector in which the expression of luciferase is controlled by SV40 promoter) was cotransfected instead of pfos-luc as a control in a separate set of experiments. To measure the activity of RGL to stimulate the binding of GTPγS to small G proteins, the post-translationally modified or unmodified form of GST-fused to small G proteins (100 nm) were incubated with 2 μm [35S]GTPγS (1,000–1,500 cpm/pmol) for 7 or 15 min at 30 °C in 50 μl of reaction mixture (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 0.12% CHAPS, 1 mmdl-α-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, 1 mmDTT, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) containing the indicated concentrations of GST-RGL and its deletion mutants. To measure the activity of RGL to stimulate the dissociation of GDP from Ral, the post-translationally modified or unmodified form of GST-Ral (5 pmol) was preincubated with 2 μm [3H]GDP (1,500–3,000 dpm/pmol) for 15 min at 30 °C in 20 μl of reaction mixture (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm EDTA, 0.3% CHAPS, 1 mmdl-α-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). After the incubation, 1 μl of 400 mm MgCl2 was added. To this preincubation mixture, 29 μl of reaction mixture (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 170 μm GTP, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) containing GST-RGL (15 pmol) was added and the mixture was further incubated for the indicated periods of time at 30 °C. Assays were quantified by rapid filtration on nitrocellulose filters (23Albright C.F. Giddings B.W. Liu J. Vito M. Weinberg R.A.

Then the cells were lysed as described (38Kikuchi A. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 588-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and Ral was immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA antibody. After extensive washing of the immunoprecipitates, bound guanine nucleotides were eluted, separated by ascending thin-layer chromatography (42Satoh T. Endo M. Nakafuku M. Nakamura S. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5993-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 43Urano T. Emkey R. Feig L.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), and analyzed with Fuji BAS 2000 image analyzer. The relative molar ratio of GTP and GDP was corrected for the number of phosphates per mol of guanosine, and the amount of the GTP bound form of Ral was expressed as percentage of the total amount of Ral. Protein concentrations were determined with bovine serum albumin as a standard (44Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (208196) Google Scholar). RGL contains the CDC25-like domain which consists of 6 blocks in its central region and RID in the C-terminal region (5Kikuchi A. Demo S.D. Ye Z.H. Chen Y.W. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7483-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 23Albright C.F. Giddings B.W. Liu J. Vito M. Weinberg R.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). Since experiments using the full-length of RGL have not yet been done, we coexpressed RGL with Ras in Sf9 cells to examine whether the full-length of RGL interacts with Ras in intact cells. RGL was tagged with the HA epitope at the N terminus. The expression level of transfected RGL in Sf9 cells expressing RGL alone was similar to that in the cells coexpressing RGL with RasG12V, an active form, or RasS17N, a dominant negative form, as assessed by immunoblotting (Fig. 1 B,lanes 1–3). When the lysates coexpressing RGL with RasG12V were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Ras antibody, both RGL and Ras were detected in the Ras immune complex (Fig.1 B, lane 5). When the lysates expressing RGL alone were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Ras antibody, RGL was not detected (Fig. 1 B, lane 4). When the lysates coexpressing RGL with RasS17N were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Ras antibody, RGL was not coprecipitated with RasS17N (Fig. 1 B, lane 6).

Trypanosoma brucei spp., the causative agent of nagana in ungulates and sleeping sickness in humans, is a parasitic protozoan of economic and public health importance. Studies of this organism have revealed many unusual biological phenomena later observed in other systems, perhaps most remarkably trans-splicing (1Agabian N. Cell. 1990; 61: 1157-1160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) and glycosylphosphatidylinositol protein anchors (2Cross G.A.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The paradigm glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein, the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG), 1The abbreviations used are: VSG, variant surface glycoprotein; BSF, bloodstream form; FP, flagellar pocket; PARP, procyclic acidic repetitive protein; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; EST, expressed sequence tag; ORF, open reading frame; kb, kilobase(s); IVS, intervening sequence (between ORFs); TLCK,N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; rTrab, recombinant Trab. 1The abbreviations used are: VSG, variant surface glycoprotein; BSF, bloodstream form; FP, flagellar pocket; PARP, procyclic acidic repetitive protein; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; EST, expressed sequence tag; ORF, open reading frame; kb, kilobase(s); IVS, intervening sequence (between ORFs); TLCK,N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; rTrab, recombinant Trab. accounts for ∼10% of total protein biosynthesis in the mammalian bloodstream form (BSF) of the parasite and provides an essential immunological barrier. The entire VSG coat, comprising 107 identical molecules, is replaced during antigenic switching in the BSF by a process of continued biosynthesis of new VSG and internalization/shedding of the old coat protein. Much VSG recycles: internalization is concomitant with surface delivery of newly synthesized VSG in the flagellar pocket (FP). In the insect procyclic form, VSG is replaced by the abundant glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored procyclic acidic repetitive protein (PARP) (3Mowatt M.R. Clayton C.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2838-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).Rates of surface protein internalization are comparable with that of a mammalian cell, but in a trypanosome, only the FP, a small area of the cell surface, is available for exo- and endocytic activity due to a subplasmalemmal microtubular network over the rest of the cell body (4Duszenko M. Seyfang A. Advances in Cell and Molecular Biology of Membranes.in: Tartakoff A.M. Plattner H. Jai Press Inc., Greenwich, CT1993: 227-258Google Scholar). The FP has four specialized adjacent microtubules running parallel down one side of the structure, coincident with a specialized area, the cytosome. This may be the site of exo- and endocytosis since it is associated with vesicles carrying VSG arising from the Golgi complex and with vesicular tubules and flattened cisternae structurally similar to the trans-Golgi network. Coated vesicles budding from the FP are observed only in BSF parasites (5Clayton C. Hausler T. Blattner J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 325-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The FP is of interest for several reasons; first, for membrane trafficking of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoproteins; second, for sorting mechanisms, as endo- and exocytosis are presumably simultaneously active within a small membrane area (6Webster P. Russell D.G. Parasitol. Today. 1993; 9: 201-206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 7Brickman M.J. Balber A.E. J. Eukaryotic Microbiol. 1994; 41: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar); and finally, as a potential site for therapeutic attack.Detailed exploration of intracellular trafficking requires suitable markers, but the wide evolutionary distance between trypanosomes and most other eukaryotes is unfortunately reflected in a lack of immunological cross-reactivity between homologues. Marker proteins that are available include trypanosome BiP, an endoplasmic reticulum marker (8Bangs J.D. Uyetake L. Brickman M.J. Balber A.E. Boothroyd J.C. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 1101-1113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bangs J.D. Brouch E.M. Ransom D.M. Roggy J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18387-18393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and CRAM, a cysteine-rich acidic transmembrane protein found in the FP and associated endocytic vesicles (10Lee M.G.-S. Bilhain B.E. Russell D.G. Deckelbaum R.J. Van der Ploeg L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4506-4517Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Also available is an antibody to the CB1 epitope of a developmentally regulated 44-kDa protein of unknown function in the endocytic pathway, found in the FP, endosomes, and lysosomes (7Brickman M.J. Balber A.E. J. Eukaryotic Microbiol. 1994; 41: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).The Rab family consists of GTPases with ∼30% identity to Ras and with most homology confined to four GTP-binding motifs (11Zerial M. Huber L.A. Guidebook to the Small GTPases. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 12-29Google Scholar). Rab proteins are essential for protein trafficking in all eukaryotic organisms. Family members have low intrinsic GTPase activity, requiring activating proteins (GTPase-activating proteins) to increase turnover and act as effectors (12Novick P. Brennwald P. Cell. 1993; 75: 597-601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). GTP- and GDP-bound Ras have distinct conformations (13Wittinghofer A. Pai E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (231) Google Scholar), and it can be inferred that Rab proteins will similarly undergo a conformational change upon GTP hydrolysis since their structure is highly homologous. Each Rab protein binds a subset of organelles; the C terminus is responsible for intracellular localization, while the N terminus recognizes the target organelle and is required for vesicle fusion (14Steele-Mortimer O. Clague M.J. Huber L.A. Chavrier P. Gruenberg J. Gorvel J.-P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The paucity of markers suitable for trafficking studies led us to initiate the cloning ofrab genes from T. brucei (15Field M.C. Boothroyd J.C. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 81: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) since each Rab protein has a discrete subcellular location within the secretory pathway (16Pfeffer S.R. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 41-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 17Nuoffer C. Balch W.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 949-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The study of T. brucei Rab proteins (Trab proteins) will yield new sequences important for targeting proteins to trypanosome organelles, provide information on the compartmentalization of trypanosomes, and generate subcellular markers.A degenerate PCR cloning approach has yielded eight expressed sequence tags (EST) of small GTP-binding proteins from T. brucei, including Ran/TC4 (18Field M.C. Field H. Boothroyd J.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 69: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and seven Trab homologues (15Field M.C. Boothroyd J.C. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 81: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), while separate studies have identified three additional trab genes (19El-Sayed N.M.A. Alarcon C.M. Beck J.C. Sheffield V.C. Donelson J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 73: 75-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar,20Klöckner T. van den Bogaard M. Boshart M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol.Molecular Parasitology Meeting, September 17–21.in: Goldberg D. Parsons M. Ullu E. Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, MA1995: 123Google Scholar). We isolated two trab genes on a single genomic clone (15Field M.C. Boothroyd J.C. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 81: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and here we report the genomic organization of these genes (previously rtb1 and rtb7) and the subcellular location of the encoded proteins.DISCUSSIONWe have identified a pair of small GTPase genes juxtaposed in a head-to-tail orientation in the genome of T. brucei. We were unable to find evidence for a reverse transcriptase-mediated duplication mechanism, e.g. mini-exon or poly(A) tail vestiges. While there are two genes present in the locus (trab1 and trab7), five other trabgenes and the gene for Ran/TC4 are dispersed and exhibit no linkage with each other (15Field M.C. Boothroyd J.C. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 81: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 18Field M.C. Field H. Boothroyd J.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 69: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), suggesting that the trab1/trab7pair is unusual. In addition, all our data suggest thattrab1/trab7 are not part of a more extensive trabgene array. Phylogenetic reconstruction indicates that Trab1p and Trab7p are more similar to each other than to any other Rab sequence, evidence that they are paralogues. Taken together, these data strongly argue that these genes are the result of an ancient tandem duplication event, estimated to have occurred ∼100 million years ago.Duplication, probably by homologous recombination, has resulted in many gene arrays in T. brucei, e.g. the PARP locus with arrays of two or three genes (31Clayton C. Hotz H.-R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and the extensive tubulin locus (39Thomasshow L.S. Milhausen M. Rutter W.J. Agabian N. Cell. 1983; 32: 35-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Homologous recombination is highly active (40ten Asbroek A.L.M.A. Ouellette M. Borst P. Nature. 1996; 348: 174-175Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 41Eid J. Sollner-Webb B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2118-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 42Li F. Gottesdiener K.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 534-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and is probably responsible for producing and manipulating the reservoir of up to 1000 different VSG genes providing diverse antigenicity (34Field M.C. Boothroyd J.C. J. Mol. Evol. 1996; 42: 500-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 43Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Valerio D. de Lange T. Bernards A. Borst P. Grosveld F.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 5905-5923Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Tandem arrangement of genes allowing polycistronic expression is a common strategy in T. brucei and may facilitate coordination of gene expression. Indeed, trab1 and trab7 are transcribed at low levels and in equal amounts (15Field M.C. Boothroyd J.C. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 81: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).By probing of a genomic library of known complexity, the total number of Trab-related genes was estimated to be ∼20. Since 11trab clones and ESTs have been reported to date, it is likely that a representative sampling of trab sequences, covering most of the trypanosome intracellular trafficking pathways, is already in hand. This number is similar to that obtained for S. cerevisiae, also a unicellular eukaryote, and is in agreement with our earlier estimate of total trab numbers (15Field M.C. Boothroyd J.C. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 81: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, these data suggest that, as a first approximation, T. bruceipossesses a secretory pathway of equivalent complexity to yeast.We propose that the continued linkage of trab1 andtrab7 is due to functional selection. Conservation of protein sequence contrasted with saturated synonymous nucleotide replacement strongly suggests a functional selection on the gene products. While both Trab sequences are homologous to a selection of Rab sequences in the data base, neither exhibited strong homology to a particular Rab sequence, which suggests instead that they are trypanosome-specific. The immunolocalization data for Trab7p, indicating association with the kinetoplast and FP, are clearly consistent with this proposal. In addition, we were unable to detect Trab1p or Trab7p in COS-7 cells, either by Western blotting or by immunofluorescence analysis, or in Leishmania major, by Western blotting.3 While the former result was not unexpected, the lack of immunological cross-reactivity between Trab proteins and Leishmania Rab proteins is also consistent with a species-specific function.Trab1p has canonical Rab sequences, including a C-terminal isoprenylation signal, and shows diffuse reticular staining consistent with a Ypt1p/Rab1p function. The homology to sec4 (and the closely related ypt1) detected by searching the S. cerevisiae genome may reflect this. In contrast, Trab7p has several unusual features. An important alteration in Trab7p is an Ala → Ser substitution in the WD box, potentially resulting in a GTP-bound, constitutively active protein like RhoE (35Foster R. Hu K.-Q. Lu Y. Nolan K.M. Thissen J. Settleman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2689-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) or viral Ki-Ras, which has an Ala → Thr mutation (36Shimizu K. Birnbaum D. Ruley M.A. Fasano O. Suard Y. Edlund L. Taparowsky E. Goldfarb M. Wigler M. Nature. 1993; 304: 497-500Crossref Scopus (237) Google Scholar). A second change in Trab7p is a 12-amino acid loop adjacent to the nucleotide-binding pocket. We believe it is likely that Trab7p binds only GTP and does not hydrolyze it, but clearly, this needs to be shown empirically. The subcellular location of Trab7p is also highly unusual, consisting of a single spot in nondividing cells located close to the kinetoplast. This structure divides at a similar time to the kinetoplast, clearly preceding nuclear division, suggesting association of the Trab7p compartment with basal body/FP structures. Like the Trab7p compartment, the basal body and FP are located close to the kinetoplast and divide with it, prior to nuclear division (38Robinson D.R. Gull K. Nature. 1991; 352: 731-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar).Carboxyl-terminal isoprenylation is essential for Rab function and occurs in T. brucei (44Field H. Blench I. Croft S. Field M.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and in all Rab homologues reported in T. brucei with the exception of Trab7p (KWRC), canonical isoprenylation sequences are found, i.e. SCAC (Trab4Bp), GCAC (Trab5Ap), GCCG (Trab5Bp), CCGG (Trab1p), and DSCC (Ypt1p from kinetoplastid L. major). Despite its unusual signal sequence, native Trab7p is membrane-associated, which suggests that it is a substrate for the trypanosome isoprene transferases. It remains to be determined which isoprene is present on Trab7p.The divergence of Trab7p from the canonical Rab sequence and the association with a kinetoplast-specific organelle are suggestive of a novel role for Trab7p in the trypanosome cell. We propose thattrab7 arose by duplication of a progenitor trabgene, with Trab1p now fulfilling a more basic endoplasmic reticulum-associated function and Trab7p co-opted into a specialized role. Trab1p and Trab7p are 43% identical and 64% similar, reminiscent of Arf1 and Arf6, which are 66% homologous and also have different locations (45Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. Ooi C.E. Finazzi D. Teal S.B. Oorschot V. Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. J. Cell. Biol. 1995; 128: 1003-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Because of the absence of clear homologues for Trab1p and Trab7p, the precise functions of these proteins must be determined directly, which is being actively pursued. Efforts to further localize the individual proteins and to gain more insight into their function by overexpression and direct study of the GTPase activities of these potentially important trypanosome proteins are currently under way. In summary, we report the presence of a tandem pair of rab genes in the protozoan parasite T. brucei. Immunolocalization and sequence data suggest a species-specific role for at least one (Trab7p). Thetrab1/trab7 pair has remained together for a considerable period of time, indicative of functional importance. Trypanosoma brucei spp., the causative agent of nagana in ungulates and sleeping sickness in humans, is a parasitic protozoan of economic and public health importance. Studies of this organism have revealed many unusual biological phenomena later observed in other systems, perhaps most remarkably trans-splicing (1Agabian N.

Parasitol. 1995; 81: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and here we report the genomic organization of these genes (previously rtb1 and rtb7) and the subcellular location of the encoded proteins. DISCUSSIONWe have identified a pair of small GTPase genes juxtaposed in a head-to-tail orientation in the genome of T. brucei. We were unable to find evidence for a reverse transcriptase-mediated duplication mechanism, e.g. mini-exon or poly(A) tail vestiges. While there are two genes present in the locus (trab1 and trab7), five other trabgenes and the gene for Ran/TC4 are dispersed and exhibit no linkage with each other (15Field M.C. Boothroyd J.C. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 81: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 18Field M.C. Field H. Boothroyd J.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 69: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), suggesting that the trab1/trab7pair is unusual. In addition, all our data suggest thattrab1/trab7 are not part of a more extensive trabgene array. Phylogenetic reconstruction indicates that Trab1p and Trab7p are more similar to each other than to any other Rab sequence, evidence that they are paralogues. Taken together, these data strongly argue that these genes are the result of an ancient tandem duplication event, estimated to have occurred ∼100 million years ago.Duplication, probably by homologous recombination, has resulted in many gene arrays in T. brucei, e.g. the PARP locus with arrays of two or three genes (31Clayton C. Hotz H.-R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and the extensive tubulin locus (39Thomasshow L.S. Milhausen M. Rutter W.J. Agabian N. Cell. 1983; 32: 35-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Homologous recombination is highly active (40ten Asbroek A.L.M.A. Ouellette M. Borst P. Nature. 1996; 348: 174-175Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 41Eid J. Sollner-Webb B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2118-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 42Li F. Gottesdiener K.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 534-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and is probably responsible for producing and manipulating the reservoir of up to 1000 different VSG genes providing diverse antigenicity (34Field M.C. Boothroyd J.C. J. Mol. Evol. 1996; 42: 500-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 43Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Valerio D. de Lange T. Bernards A. Borst P. Grosveld F.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 5905-5923Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Tandem arrangement of genes allowing polycistronic expression is a common strategy in T. brucei and may facilitate coordination of gene expression. Indeed, trab1 and trab7 are transcribed at low levels and in equal amounts (15Field M.C. Boothroyd J.C. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 81: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).By probing of a genomic library of known complexity, the total number of Trab-related genes was estimated to be ∼20. Since 11trab clones and ESTs have been reported to date, it is likely that a representative sampling of trab sequences, covering most of the trypanosome intracellular trafficking pathways, is already in hand. This number is similar to that obtained for S. cerevisiae, also a unicellular eukaryote, and is in agreement with our earlier estimate of total trab numbers (15Field M.C. Boothroyd J.C. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 81: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, these data suggest that, as a first approximation, T. bruceipossesses a secretory pathway of equivalent complexity to yeast.We propose that the continued linkage of trab1 andtrab7 is due to functional selection. Conservation of protein sequence contrasted with saturated synonymous nucleotide replacement strongly suggests a functional selection on the gene products. While both Trab sequences are homologous to a selection of Rab sequences in the data base, neither exhibited strong homology to a particular Rab sequence, which suggests instead that they are trypanosome-specific. The immunolocalization data for Trab7p, indicating association with the kinetoplast and FP, are clearly consistent with this proposal. In addition, we were unable to detect Trab1p or Trab7p in COS-7 cells, either by Western blotting or by immunofluorescence analysis, or in Leishmania major, by Western blotting.3 While the former result was not unexpected, the lack of immunological cross-reactivity between Trab proteins and Leishmania Rab proteins is also consistent with a species-specific function.Trab1p has canonical Rab sequences, including a C-terminal isoprenylation signal, and shows diffuse reticular staining consistent with a Ypt1p/Rab1p function. The homology to sec4 (and the closely related ypt1) detected by searching the S. cerevisiae genome may reflect this. In contrast, Trab7p has several unusual features. An important alteration in Trab7p is an Ala → Ser substitution in the WD box, potentially resulting in a GTP-bound, constitutively active protein like RhoE (35Foster R. Hu K.-Q. Lu Y. Nolan K.M. Thissen J. Settleman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2689-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) or viral Ki-Ras, which has an Ala → Thr mutation (36Shimizu K. Birnbaum D. Ruley M.A. Fasano O. Suard Y. Edlund L. Taparowsky E. Goldfarb M. Wigler M. Nature. 1993; 304: 497-500Crossref Scopus (237) Google Scholar). A second change in Trab7p is a 12-amino acid loop adjacent to the nucleotide-binding pocket. We believe it is likely that Trab7p binds only GTP and does not hydrolyze it, but clearly, this needs to be shown empirically. The subcellular location of Trab7p is also highly unusual, consisting of a single spot in nondividing cells located close to the kinetoplast. This structure divides at a similar time to the kinetoplast, clearly preceding nuclear division, suggesting association of the Trab7p compartment with basal body/FP structures. Like the Trab7p compartment, the basal body and FP are located close to the kinetoplast and divide with it, prior to nuclear division (38Robinson D.R. Gull K. Nature. 1991; 352: 731-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar).Carboxyl-terminal isoprenylation is essential for Rab function and occurs in T. brucei (44Field H. Blench I. Croft S. Field M.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and in all Rab homologues reported in T. brucei with the exception of Trab7p (KWRC), canonical isoprenylation sequences are found, i.e. SCAC (Trab4Bp), GCAC (Trab5Ap), GCCG (Trab5Bp), CCGG (Trab1p), and DSCC (Ypt1p from kinetoplastid L. major). Despite its unusual signal sequence, native Trab7p is membrane-associated, which suggests that it is a substrate for the trypanosome isoprene transferases. It remains to be determined which isoprene is present on Trab7p.The divergence of Trab7p from the canonical Rab sequence and the association with a kinetoplast-specific organelle are suggestive of a novel role for Trab7p in the trypanosome cell. We propose thattrab7 arose by duplication of a progenitor trabgene, with Trab1p now fulfilling a more basic endoplasmic reticulum-associated function and Trab7p co-opted into a specialized role. Trab1p and Trab7p are 43% identical and 64% similar, reminiscent of Arf1 and Arf6, which are 66% homologous and also have different locations (45Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. Ooi C.E. Finazzi D. Teal S.B. Oorschot V. Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. J. Cell. Biol. 1995; 128: 1003-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Because of the absence of clear homologues for Trab1p and Trab7p, the precise functions of these proteins must be determined directly, which is being actively pursued. Efforts to further localize the individual proteins and to gain more insight into their function by overexpression and direct study of the GTPase activities of these potentially important trypanosome proteins are currently under way. In summary, we report the presence of a tandem pair of rab genes in the protozoan parasite T. brucei. Immunolocalization and sequence data suggest a species-specific role for at least one (Trab7p). Thetrab1/trab7 pair has remained together for a considerable period of time, indicative of functional importance. We have identified a pair of small GTPase genes juxtaposed in a head-to-tail orientation in the genome of T. brucei.

https://openalex.org/W2080327600,"The 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP) is a molecular chaperone for the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), a large endocytic receptor that binds multiple ligands. The primary function of RAP has been defined as promotion of the correct folding of LRP, and prevention of premature interaction of ligands with LRP within the early secretory pathway. Previous examination of the RAP sequence revealed an internal triplication. However, the functional implication of the triplicated repeats was unknown. In the current study using various RAP and LRP domain constructs, we found that the carboxyl-terminal repeat of RAP possesses high affinities to each of the three ligand-binding domains on LRP, whereas the amino-terminal and central repeats of RAP exhibit only low affinity to the second and the fourth ligand-binding domains of LRP, respectively. Using truncated soluble minireceptors of LRP, we identified five independent RAP-binding sites, two on each of the second and fourth, and one on the third ligand-binding domain of LRP. By coexpressing soluble LRP minireceptors and RAP repeat constructs, we found that only the carboxyl-terminal repeat of RAP was able to promote the folding and subsequent secretion of the soluble LRP minireceptors. However, when the ability of each RAP repeat to inhibit ligand interactions with LRP was examined, differential effects were observed for individual LRP ligands. Most striking, both the amino-terminal and central repeats, but not the carboxyl-terminal repeat, of RAP inhibited the interaction of α2-macroglobulin with LRP. These differential functions of the RAP repeats suggest that the roles of RAP in the folding of LRP and in the prevention of premature interaction of ligand with the receptor are independent.

The target receptors for RAP are cysteine-rich endocytic receptors that belong to the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family (1Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). The four representative receptors in this family are the LDL receptor (2Yamamoto T. Davis G.C. Brown M.S. Schneider W.J. Casey M.L. Goldstein J.L. Russell D.W. Cell. 1984; 39: 27-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar), the LDL receptor-related protein (LRP, Ref. 3Herz J. Hamann U. Rogne S. Myklebost O. Gausepohl H. Stanley K.K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4119-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar), glycoprotein gp330/megalin (4Saito A. Pietromonaco S. Loo A.K. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9725-9729Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), and the VLDL receptor (5Takakashi S. Kawarabayasi Y. Nakai T. Sakai J. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9252-9256Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Among these receptors, LRP and gp330/megalin are large multifunctional receptors with multiple ligand-binding domains, which bind several structurally and functionally distinct ligands (for reviews, see Refs. 1Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar and 6Kounnas M.Z. Stefansson S. Loukinova E. Argraves K.M. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). While RAP exhibits high affinities for LRP, gp330/megalin, and the VLDL receptor, it binds only weakly to the LDL receptor (7Medh J.D. Fry G.L. Bowen S.L. Pladet M.W. Strickland D.K. Chappell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 536-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Upon binding to these receptors, RAP inhibits the binding and/or endocytosis of all the ligands by the receptors. This unique feature of RAP has allowed its extensive use in biological studies of these endocytic receptors. Recent evidence has suggested that, under normal physiological conditions, RAP is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident protein and functions within the early secretory pathway (8Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Geuze H. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29874-29882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2632-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Using LRP as the target protein, it was found that RAP retained within the ER functions as a regulator of LRP activity by transiently interacting with LRP and maintaining LRP in an inactive ligand-binding state. As RAP dissociates from LRP in response to the lower pH within the Golgi, LRP becomes active as it transits to the cell surface (9Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The role of RAP in the maturation and trafficking of LRP is further supported by gene-knockout studies (11Willnow T.E. Armstrong S.A. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4537-4541Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), which demonstrate that cells lacking RAP exhibit a 75% reduction of functional LRP. LRP is the largest endocytic receptor identified to date (∼600 kDa). It is synthesized as a single polypeptide chain and cleaved in thetrans-Golgi into two subunits (12Herz J. Kowal R.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1769-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 13Willnow T.E. Moehring J.M. Inocencio N.M. Moehring T.J. Herz J. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The 515-kDa extracellular subunit contains 31 copies of complement-type ligand-binding domains arranged in four clusters with 2, 8, 10, and 11 repeats, respectively (1Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar, 3Herz J. Hamann U. Rogne S. Myklebost O. Gausepohl H. Stanley K.K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4119-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Also present in this subunit are 22 copies of cysteine-rich epidermal growth factor (EGF) precursor-type repeats which flank the ligand-binding domains. The complement-type repeats in LRP are similar to those in the LDL receptor in which the 40-residue-long cysteine-rich repeats exhibit a highly conserved spacing pattern of six cysteine residues that form three intramolecular disulfide bonds (14Daly N.L. Scanlon M.J. Djordjevic J.T. Kroon P. Smith R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6334-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The disulfide bonds are believed to be important for the stability of the ligand-binding sites on the receptor. The complexity of LRP's structure, largely due to the extensive intradomain disulfide bonds, presents a challenging task for proper folding during its biosynthesis. This process may well be assisted by molecular chaperone(s) within the ER. Indeed, using anchor-free, soluble mini-receptors that represent each of the four putative ligand-binding domains of LRP (SLRPs), our most recent studies (15Bu G.J. Rennke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22218-22224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) showed that coexpression of RAP is both necessary and sufficient for the correct folding and subsequent secretion of the SLRPs. Without the coexpression of RAP, SLRPs are misfolded due to the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds and are retained within the ER with little secretion. It is not known at present whether the role of RAP in the receptor's folding is independent from its function in preventing premature ligand interaction with the receptor. The HNEL tetrapeptide at the carboxyl terminus of RAP has been shown to mediate its ER localization and retention (9Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In addition to this ER-retention signal, examination of the RAP sequence also identified an internal triplication (9Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In the present study, using various molecular and cellular approaches, we have analyzed the function of each of the three repeats of RAP. We found that while the carboxyl-terminal repeat of RAP functions similarly to the full-length RAP in terms of interacting with the receptor and in assisting the receptor to fold, inhibition of at least one LRP ligand, α2-macroglobulin, can only be achieved with the amino-terminal or the central repeats of RAP. These differential functions of the RAP repeats suggest that the functions of RAP in receptor folding and inhibition of ligand interactions are independent. Construction of cDNAs for SLRP1, SLRP2, SLRP3, and SLRP4 using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been described previously (15Bu G.J. Rennke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22218-22224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The same strategies were used for generating additional soluble minireceptors of LRP with an HA tag inserted after the signal cleavage site. All oligonucleotides were synthesized in the Washington University School of Medicine Protein Chemistry Laboratory. The regions represented in the new SLRPs are illustrated in Fig. 4, and contain the following amino acid sequences (3Herz J. Hamann U. Rogne S. Myklebost O. Gausepohl H. Stanley K.K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4119-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar): SLRP2N, 787–994; SLRP2C, 995–1244; SLRP2N-EGF, 826–994; SLRP2C-EGF, 995–1164; SLRP3N, 2462–2712; SLRP3C, 2713–3004; SLRP4N, 3274–3553; and SLRP4C, 3554–3843. Construction of RAP repeats for cell-transfection was carried out via two sequential steps of subcloning. In the first step, the 5′ fragment of RAP (signal peptide + amino acids 1–17) was generated by PCR using pcDNA-RAP (9Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) as the template and the following two primers: forward primer (5′-GATCAAGCTTGGATGATGGCGCCGCGGAGGGTCA-3′) and reverse primer (5′-GATCGGATCCCATCATCATCATCATAGCGTAGTCCGGGACGTCGTACGGGTATCCGGACTCGCGTTTCGGGGACGG-3′). The reverse primer contained a sequence encoding an HA epitope and five methionine residues. The HA epitope sequence, YPYDVPDVA, is derived from influenza hemagglutinin and can be recognized by a monoclonal anti-HA antibody, 12CA5 (16Handley-Gearhart P.M. Stephen A.G. Trausch-Azar J.S. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33171-33178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting PCR product was subcloned into pcDNA3 vector, and the resulting plasmid, termed pcDNA-RAP5′, was used as the base vector for generating various constructs of RAP. In the second step, the carboxyl-terminal portions of RAP (amino acids 18–323, 18–110, 91–210, 191–323, or 18–250) were generated by PCR and subcloned into pcDNA-RAP5′. The resulting plasmids were used for cell transfection. The methods for constructing GST/RAP constructs have been described previously (9Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Human glioblastoma U87 cells were cultured in Earle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and maintained at 37 °C in humidified air containing 5% CO2 (8Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Geuze H. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29874-29882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For transient transfection, U87 cells were transfected with various plasmids at 40–60% confluence using a calcium phosphate precipitation method (17Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). For each well of six-well dishes (3.5 cm in diameter), 10 μg of DNA were used in a total volume of 4 ml of medium. Sixteen hours after the start of transfection, cells were washed with medium and cultured continuously for an additional 24 h before use in experiments. The efficiency of transient transfection in these studies was consistently about 20–30% as assessed by immunofluorescent staining of expressed proteins. Metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine or [35S]cysteine was performed essentially as described before (9Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). For pulse-chase experiments, cells were pulse-labeled for 1 h and chased with serum-containing medium for 3 h. Polyclonal anti-RAP and anti-LRP antibodies have been described before (9Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-HA antibody was obtained from BabCo (12CA5). Immunoprecipitations were carried out essentially as described before (18Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13002-13009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except the washing buffer for monoclonal anti-HA antibody contained 0.1% SDS instead of 1% SDS. Preliminary experiments were performed to ensure that the primary antibody used in each immunoprecipitation was in excess. Protein A-agarose beads were used to precipitate protein-IgG complexes. The immunoprecipitated material was released from the beads by boiling each sample for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol) (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). If the immunoprecipitated material was analyzed under reducing conditions, 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol was included in the Laemmli sample buffer. The percentage of SDS-polyacrylamide gels is indicated in each figure legend. Rainbow molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad) were used as the molecular weight standards. GST or GST/RAP constructs were electrophoresed on SDS gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking with tissue culture medium, membranes were incubated with conditioned media harvested from SLRP and RAP cDNAs-cotransfected cells. The bound SLRPs were then detected with anti-HA antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham). For ligand blotting analysis, purified human LRP was electrophoresed on SDS gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Strips of membrane were then incubated with GST or GST/RAP constructs, and bound proteins were detected using anti-GST antibody. For binding and degradation analysis, GST/RAP fusion proteins were subjected to thrombin cleavage and cleaved GST was removed with glutathione agarose beads (20Warshawsky I. Bu G. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22046-22054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting recombinant proteins of RAP constructs (RAP-(1–323), RAP-(1–110), RAP-(91–210), and RAP-(191–323)) were used for competition assays. Each of analyzed RAP and its constructs was iodinated using the IODOGEN method (21Bu G. Morton P.A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15595-15602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of 125I-RAP to U87 cells in the absence or the presence of cold competitor has been described previously (8Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Geuze H. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29874-29882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All the LRP ligands tested have been described before (23Warshawsky I. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6664-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 24Bu G. Williams S. Strickland D.K. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6523-6529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Each of these ligands was iodinated and used for cellular degradation analysis by measuring cell-mediated trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity released into the overlying medium, in the absence or the presence of excess unlabeled RAP constructs. Each assay was carried out in triplicate, and the standard deviations were used for error bars. In our previous studies (9Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), we noted a possible internal triplication in the primary structure of RAP. However, the boundaries and the relationship among the three repeats were not clear. In the present studies, we have used several DNA computer analysis programs to examine the RAP sequence. Shown in Fig.1 is the sequence analysis using the GCG package (Program Manual for the Wisconsin Package, version 8, Genetics Computer Group). The programs Compare and Dotplot examine the sequence homology by identifying both identical and similar residues along the sequence. When RAP was compared with itself using a window of 30 residues and a stringency of 15 residues, we found significant homology between regions within 1–100 and 201–300, as well as between regions 101–200 and 201–300 (Fig. 1 A). Only scattered homology was found between regions of 1–100 and 101–200. Thus, we assigned the RAP sequence into three repeats approximately equal in sizes (repeat 1 = 1–100; repeat 2 = 101–200; repeat 3 = 201–323). Using these boundaries, we compared the sequence homology among the three repeats. The lower homology between repeat 1 and repeat 2 prompted us to compare each of the two repeats separately, using the Gap program of the GCG package. We found that both repeat 1 and repeat 2 have high homology with repeat 3 (46.4% and 45.5% similarity, respectively), whereas repeat 1 and repeat 2 have relatively low homology (38.9% similarity). Thus, we speculate that if the three repeats of RAP were derived from the same ancestral sequence, repeat 1 and repeat 2 may have been derived from repeat 3 separately during evolution. Two regions between repeat 1 and 3 were further identified for high homology, which are represented by the two elongated homology lines in Fig. 1 A. Only one (albeit longer) region was found between repeat 2 and repeat 3 that shares high homology. These homologous regions are graphically illustrated in Fig. 1 B. To analyze whether each of the three triplicated repeats interact similarly with LRP, we performed ligand blotting analysis using GST/RAP constructs representing each of the three repeats (9Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In addition to the full-length RAP (GST/RAP-(1–323)), three GST/RAP repeat constructs were made, which slightly overlapped at the assigned boundaries (i.e. GST/RAP-(1–110), GST/RAP-(91–210), and GST/RAP-(191–323), see Fig. 2 A). When these GST fusion proteins were tested for interaction with LRP via ligand blotting (Fig. 2 B), we found that repeat 3 possessed similar affinity for LRP as full-length RAP. Although they have much lower affinities, repeat 1 and repeat 2 of RAP also appear to be capable of interacting with LRP. Due to low specific radioactivity following iodination of repeats 1 and 2, we were unable to conclusively compare the affinities of RAP repeats with LRP on the cell surface directly. However, to examine the relationships of these interactions at the cell surface, we performed competition analysis for the binding of full-length RAP to U87 cells (8Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Geuze H. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29874-29882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) by each of the RAP repeat constructs. To eliminate potential steric hindrance effects of GST on ligand inhibition, we removed the GST portion from each of the fusion constructs, and thereafter repurified the resulting RAP fragments. Shown in Fig. 2 C are the binding of either125I-RAP-(1–323) or 125I-RAP-(191–323) to U87 cells in the absence or the presence of excess unlabeled competitors (100-fold excess). As seen in the figure, in addition to the full-length RAP, only repeat 3, but not repeats 1 and 2, demonstrated inhibition of the binding of 125I-RAP-(1–323). For binding of 125I-RAP-(191–323), both unlabeled full-length RAP and repeat 3 maximally inhibited, while repeat 1 and repeat 2 inhibited binding slightly. These results suggest that, among the three repeats of RAP, the third repeat possesses the highest affinity for LRP, consistent with the results obtained from the ligand blotting analysis. In our previous studies, we have shown that RAP binds to the second, third, and fourth ligand-binding domains of LRP (15Bu G.J. Rennke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22218-22224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To analyze to which of the ligand-binding domains each of the RAP repeat binds, we performed experiments in which potential interactions between a given RAP repeat and a given ligand-binding domain of LRP were examined. Ligand-binding domains of LRP were represented by SLRPs, which upon coexpression with RAP, are secreted into the media (15Bu G.J. Rennke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22218-22224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) (also see illustrations in Fig. 4 for schematic representations of SLRPs). GST/RAP constructs, separated via SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, were transferred onto nitrocellulose and incubated with conditioned media containing SLRP2 (Fig.3 A), SLRP3 (Fig. 3 B), or SLRP4 (Fig. 3 C). The SLRPs that interacted with GST/RAP constructs were then detected using anti-HA antibody (15Bu G.J. Rennke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22218-22224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). As seen in the figures, no interaction of the negative control, GST, with any SLRP was detected. Both full-length RAP (GST/RAP-(1–323)) and repeat 3 of RAP (GST/RAP-(191–323)) interacted with each of the three SLRPs, suggesting that repeat 3 of RAP contains the binding determinants for interacting with each of the three ligand-binding domains on LRP. Weak interaction of repeat 1 of RAP was detected only with SLRP2, whereas weak interaction of repeat 2 of RAP was seen with only SLRP4. These weaker interactions were enhanced when the amounts of GST/RAP fusion protein were increased by 10-folds (as is the case presented in Fig.3). These results suggest differential interactions of RAP repeats with ligand-binding domains on LRP. Two additional RAP repeat constructs were tested in these experiments, one with the ER-retention signal HNEL deleted (GST/RAP-(1–319)), and one containing repeats 1 and 2, and part of repeat 3 of RAP (GST/RAP-(1–250)). As shown in Fig. 3, GST/RAP-(1–319) interacted similarly to full-length RAP with LRP, indicating that the HNEL signal is not important for RAP interaction with LRP. The fact that GST/RAP-(1–250) does not interact with SLRP3 is consistent with the notion that neither repeat 1, nor repeat 2 of RAP interacts with the third ligand-binding domain of LRP, and suggests residue 250–323 are important for interacting with SLRP3. Our previous cell surface saturation binding analyses have suggested that each LRP molecule contains 5–7 binding sites for RAP (22Iadonato S.P. Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Schwartz A.L. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 867-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, to further define the binding sites of RAP on the subdomains of LRP, we prepared constructs representing approximately each half of the three ligand-binding domains, with or without the flanking EGF precursor type repeats (see “Materials and Methods”). These regions are graphically illustrated in Fig. 4. Using these SLRPs and the coexpression of RAP, we have analyzed the interaction with each of the repeats within RAP, as well as the full-length RAP. The results are summarized in Table I. As seen in the table, the amino-terminal (SLRP2N) and carboxyl-terminal (SLRP2C) halves of the second ligand-binding domain of LRP (SLRP2) interacted equally well with both full-length RAP and the repeat 3 of RAP, suggesting that at least two independent RAP-binding sites exist within the second ligand-binding domain of LRP. Removal of the EGF precursor repeats from either the amino-terminal half (SLRP2N-EGF) or the carboxyl-terminal half (SLRP2C-EGF) had no effect on their interactions with RAP, suggesting that the EGF precursor repeats are not required for RAP's interactions with LRP. When the third ligand-binding domain of LRP was divided in half, only the carboxyl-terminal half (SLRP3C) exhibited interaction, albeit weak, with RAP, consistent with the notion that this repeat contains only one RAP-binding site likely localized near the middle of this repeat. Although the carboxyl-terminal half (SLRP4C) exhibited somewhat weaker interaction, both the amino-terminal (SLRP4N) and carboxyl-terminal (SLRP4C) halves of the fourth ligand-binding domain of LRP reacted with RAP, suggesting that this ligand-binding domain of LRP likely contains two RAP-binding sites. Taken together, we have thus identified at least five independent RAP-binding sites on LRP. The exact number of RAP-binding sites on LRP and their precise localization will require further investigation.Table IInteraction of SLRPs with GST/RAP constructsGSTGST/RAPGST/RAP-(1–110)GST/RAP-(91–210)GST/RAP-(191–323)GST/RAP-(1–319)GST/RAP-(1–250)SLRP1−−−−−−−SLRP2−++++++−+++++++++++SLRP2N−++++++−+++++++++++SLRP2N-EGF−++++++−+++++++++++SLRP2C−++++−−+++++++++++SLRP2C-EGF−++++−−+++++++++++SLRP3−++++−−++++++++−SLRP3N−−−−−−−SLRP3C−+−−++−SLRP4−++++−++++++++++++++SLRP4N−++++−++++++++++++++SLRP4C−++−−++++−GST or GST/RAP constructs were electrophoresed on SDS gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane.

Open table in a new tab GST or GST/RAP constructs were electrophoresed on SDS gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane.

The bound SLRPs were then detected with anti-HA antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham) detection method. −, no detectable interaction; +, ++, +++, and ++++ represent various degree of interactions from minimum to maximum. Also shown in Table I are results of interactions between different SLRPs and the three RAP repeat constructs. It appears that the binding sites for repeats 1 and 2 of RAP are both localized on the amino-terminal halves of the second and fourth repeats of LRP, respectively. To examine the ability of RAP repeats to promote the folding process of LRP, we constructed cDNAs corresponding to the full-length RAP and each of its three repeats of RAP. An HA epitope and five methionine residues were included in the constructs to monitor the expression of these proteins after cell transfection. When these cDNAs were transfected into U87 cells (8Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Geuze H. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29874-29882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we found abundant expression for each of them following metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine and immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody (Fig. 5 A). The expression levels of RAP and its individual repeats after transfection were approximately 50-fold higher when compared with the endogenous RAP (data not shown, see Ref. 15Bu G.J. Rennke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22218-22224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In our previous studies, we developed a system by which the folding of LRP can be evaluated using SLRPs (15Bu G.J. Rennke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22218-22224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Correct folding and the subsequent secretion of each of the three ligand-binding domains of LRP (SLRP2, SLRP3, and SLRP4) require the coexpression of RAP. Shown in Fig. 5 B is an experiment in which SLRP2 is expressed in U87 cells without or with coexpression of full-length RAP (RAP-(1–323)). The secretion level of SLRP2 was monitored by analyzing radiolabeled SLRP2 in the media and cell lysates after pulse labeling with [35S]cysteine for 1 h and chase for 3 h. As seen in the figure, without coexpression of RAP-(1–323), little secretion (∼8% of total radioactivity) of SLRP2 was seen, whereas when RAP-(1–323) was coexpressed, about 50% of total35S-SLRP2 was secreted. Using the same assay, we analyzed the ability of each RAP repeat construct in the secretion of SLRPs. Shown in Fig. 5 C are results from a representative experiment of the four performed. The percent of SLRP secretion after pulse-chase labeling was plotted against individual constructs. As seen in the figure, repeat 3 of RAP (RAP-(191–323)) functioned at least as well (SLRP4) if not better (SLRP2 and SLRP3) than the full-length RAP in its ability to assist the folding and secretion of each of the three SLRPs. Both repeat 1 and 2 of RAP had little effect on the secretion of SLRPs, possibly due to their lower affinity for the SLRPs. Also examined in these experiments was RAP-(1–250), which functioned similarly to the full-length RAP in the secretion of SLRP2 and SLRP4, but not SLRP3, consistent with its ability to bind LRP (see Fig.3). RAP has been used extensively in the study of LRP ligands due to its ability to antagonize ligand interactions with the receptor (1Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). To examine the ability of each of the RAP repeats to inhibit LRP ligands, we analyzed the interaction of several ligands with LRP in the absence or the presence of either the full-length RAP or each of the repeat constructs of RAP. To exclude any possible steric hindrance by GST, we proteolytically removed it from each of the fusion proteins and repurified the RAP constructs. Since the primary binding sites on the cell surface of some LRP ligands are not on LRP (e.g. tissue factor pathway inhibitor, or TFPI; see Ref. 23Warshawsky I. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6664-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), but subsequent internalization and degradation is, we performed ligand degradation assays using U87 cells. Each of the ligands examined was radioiodinated and incubated with U87 cells for 4 h in the absence or the presence of RAP constructs. Shown in Fig. 6 are summaries for four LRP ligands: t-PA (24Bu G. Williams S. Strickland D.K. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7427-7431Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), α2M* (25Strickland D.K. Ashcom J.D. Williams S. Burgess W.H. Migliorini M. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17401-17404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), antithrombin III-thrombin complex (26Kounnas M.Z. Church F.C. Argraves W.S. Strickand D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6523-6529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and TFPI (23Warshawsky I. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6664-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). As seen in the figure, full-length RAP inhibited the degradation of each of the ligands with LRP. Repeat 3 of RAP inhibited the degradation of 125I-t-PA, 125I-antithrombin III-thrombin complex, and 125I-TFPI, but not125I-α2M*. Interestingly, while both repeat 1 and repeat 2 of RAP were generally inefficient in inhibiting other ligands, these repeats were very effective in inhibiting the interaction of α2M* with LRP. Thus, LRP ligands were differentially inhibited by RAP repeat constructs, consistent with the hypothesis that LRP ligands bind to different sites on the receptor. Despite being widely used as an antagonist to LRP on the cell surface, RAP has recently been defined as a specialized ER chaperone and functions during LRP's folding and subsequent trafficking along the early compartments of the secretory pathway (9Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 10Willnow T.E. Rohlmann A. Horton J. Otani H. Braun J.R. Hammer R.E. Herz J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2632-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 15Bu G.J. Rennke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22218-22224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Previously it had been noted that RAP contained a triplicated repeat within its sequence (9Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). However, the functional aspects of these repeats have not been defined. In the current report, we have re-examined the sequence of RAP using several sequence analysis programs. Although no clear boundaries can be defined among the three repeats, we found that the homologous regions are retained within each boundary if RAP is divided into three approximately equally sized regions (i.e. repeat 1, amino acids 1–100; repeat 2, amino acids 101–200; and repeat 3, amino acids 201–323). Several studies have suggested that there are multiple RAP-binding sites on each LRP molecule. However, the exact number of RAP-binding sites on LRP is unknown. Using cell surface binding analyses, we have previously shown that there were approximately 5–7 times more RAP-binding sites on hepatocytes when compared with t-PA binding sites (i.e. functional LRP molecules, see ref. 22Iadonato S.P. Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Schwartz A.L. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 867-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, other reported binding studies of RAP to purified LRP concluded that two RAP-binding sites are present on each LRP molecule (27Williams S.E. Ashcom J.D. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using the soluble LRP minireceptors, we have recently reported that each of the three putative ligand-binding domains of LRP is capable of interacting with RAP (15Bu G.J. Rennke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22218-22224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In the current report, we have further analyzed the RAP-binding sites on LRP using domain and subdomain constructs of LRP. We found that there were at least two RAP-binding sites on the second and fourth, and one on the third ligand-binding domains of LRP, yielding a total of at least five RAP-binding sites on the receptor. It should be pointed out that, given the fact that each half of the second and fourth ligand-binding domains of LRP is capable of binding RAP, these repeats may contain more than two RAP binding sites. The exact number of RAP-binding sites, as well as the regions where RAP binds, will require further investigation. The physiological function of RAP has become more clear during the past 2 years. The fact that RAP is localized primarily within the ER with little or no secretion suggests an intracellular role for this protein. It appears that RAP associates with LRP during or immediately after the biosynthesis of the receptor (9Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Association of RAP with LRP would ensure that LRP remains in an inactive ligand-binding state during its trafficking along the early secretory pathway. This appears to be important for receptor trafficking as LRP ligands are secreted proteins and often expressed in the same cells as the receptor. By associating with the receptor, RAP prevents premature interaction of ligands with the receptor (9Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 10Willnow T.E. Rohlmann A. Horton J. Otani H. Braun J.R. Hammer R.E. Herz J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2632-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). This function of RAP resembles that of the invariant chain in preventing premature binding of peptides with the MHC class II molecules during their trafficking along the secretory pathway (28Sant A.J. Miller J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Interestingly, using the soluble minireceptor system, our recent studies also suggest that RAP is required for the folding process of LRP by preventing the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds (15Bu G.J. Rennke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22218-22224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It is not clear at present whether the function of RAP in the folding of the receptor and in preventing premature ligand interaction with the receptor are related. For example, if a ligand interacts with LRP before the receptor completes its folding, the folding process might be impaired. In this case, preventing ligand interaction with the receptor ensures the proper folding of LRP. On the other hand, it is possible that RAP is independently involved in the folding, but remains associated with the receptor after the folding. Thereafter, premature ligand interaction with the receptor may be prevented. The precise role of RAP as a chaperone for LRP, as well as the mechanisms involved, await further definition. The differential functions of the RAP repeats may also explain their roles and appearance during evolution. Since repeat 3 of RAP is capable of assisting the folding of each of the ligand-binding domains of LRP and of inhibiting most of the ligand interactions with the receptor, it is likely that this repeat is essential for RAP's function and may be the ancestral region for the whole molecule; consistent with the indications from sequence alignment. However, the fact that interaction of some of the LRP ligands (e.g.α2-macroglobulin, shown in this study) is not inhibited by repeat 3 of RAP suggests the need for the first two repeats, which do inhibit these ligand interactions with the receptor. It is interesting to note that LRP is present in an organism as primitive as the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (29Yochem J. Greenwald I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4572-4576Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Examination of theC. elegans gene bank also identifies a 290-amino acid protein sequence (gene accession no. Z75527) that shares high sequence homology with human RAP, particularly in the portion where repeat 2 and repeat 3 of human RAP share most homology. However, no ER-retention signal is present at the carboxyl terminus of this sequence. Whether this protein is the nematode equivalent of RAP requires functional studies. It will be interesting in future studies to examine the appearance of LRP ligands during evolution. For example, α2-macroglobulin has been described in the horseshoe crab (30Armstrong P.B. Mangel W.F. Wall J.S. Hainfield J.F. Van Holde K.E. Ikai A. Quigley J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2526-2530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If most LRP ligands are absent in the nematode, the primary function of RAP may be to aid in receptor folding. The role of RAP in inhibiting ligand interaction with the receptor may have evolved only after LRP expression became high in tissues (e.g. liver and brain) of higher organisms and with the appearance of the diverse array of LRP ligands. We thank Dr. Joachim Herz for providing cDNA for human LRP, Dr. Mark Heiny for assistance in the analysis of RAP sequences, and Dr. Alan Schwartz for general support."

The peak fractions were collected and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization and liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry of the first of two major high-performance liquid chromatographic fractions showed multiple quasi-molecular ions of MNa+ at m/z 1780, 1794, 1808, 1822, and 1836. The positive-ion liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry spectrum also showed a minor series of peaks atm/z 1916, 1930, 1944, 1958, and 1971, consistent with the formation of matrix adducts with 3-nitrobenzyl alcohol. Oxonium ions representing the distal subunit were observed at m/z 1057, 1071, 1085, 1099, and 1113. The second fraction was similarly analyzed and found to contain structural homologs of the first fraction. Based on this study, the major lipid A component of chlamydial lipopolysaccharide is a glucosamine disaccharide that contains five fatty acids and a phosphate in the distal segment. Three fatty acyl groups are in the distal segment, and two are in the reducing end segment. The acyloxyacyl group is located in the distal segment in amide linkage. Two structural series, differing by 14 atomic mass units in the reducing subunit, were observed. Chlamydial lipid A is complex and consists of at least 20 homologous structural components.

Bacteria of the genus Chlamydia are pathogenic, obligatory phagosomal intracellular parasites that cause acute and chronic diseases in animals and humans (1Kiviat N.B. Paavonen J.A. Wolner-Hannsen P.

Chlamydia trachomatis is the major pathogen responsible for pelvic inflammatory disease, a major cause of female infertility in the United States (3United States Department of Health and Human Services (1981). National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases SymposiumPublication 81-2213, United States Department of Health and Human Services, Washington, D. C. (in press).Google Scholar). Chlamydial pelvic infection is often subacute, and infected females may not seek medical attention until many years after infection, perhaps during an evaluation for reproductive difficulties. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide(s); Kdo, 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; MPLA, monophosphoryl lipid A; MS, mass spectrometry; LSIMS, liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry; CID, collision-induced dissociation; MALDI/TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization/time-of-flight; MALDI/IT, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization/ion trap. 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide(s); Kdo, 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; MPLA, monophosphoryl lipid A; MS, mass spectrometry; LSIMS, liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry; CID, collision-induced dissociation; MALDI/TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization/time-of-flight; MALDI/IT, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization/ion trap. from this microorganism appears to be responsible for the generation of cytokines in which C. trachomatis interacts with tissue phagocytes during the initiation of infection (4Ingalls R.R. Rice P.A. Qureshi N. Takayama K. Lin J.S. Golenbock D.T. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3125-3130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In comparison with other bacterial LPS, C. trachomatis LPS is ∼100-fold less stimulatory. The low potency of C. trachomatis LPS provides a biological explanation for the clinical observation that infected females may be asymptomatic. When C. trachomatis is grown in tissue culture, chlamydial LPS appears to lack the characteristic O antigen that is observed in LPS from other Gram-negative bacteria. Thus, only two regions of the LPS have been examined, i.e.the core and lipid A. We have focused our efforts on the lipid A moiety because the acute cytokine response to other LPS results from the interaction of lipid A with phagocyte receptors for LPS (4Ingalls R.R. Rice P.A. Qureshi N. Takayama K. Lin J.S. Golenbock D.T. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3125-3130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chlamydial LPS is similar to the rough forms of enterobacterial LPS. It consists of the lipid A and core regions. The core region of chlamydial LPS is composed of a unique trisaccharide of αKdo(2→8)αKdo(2→4)αKdo (5Holst O. Brade L. Kosma P. Brade H. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1862-1866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Brade L. Holst O. Kosma P. Zhang Y. Paulsen H. Krasse R. Brade H. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 205-213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The LPS of C. trachomatis contains d-glucosamine, fatty acids, Kdo, and phosphorus in a molar ratio of ∼2:5:3:2.6, respectively (7Nurminen M. Rietschel E.T. Brade H. Infect. Immun. 1985; 48: 573-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is a complex mixture of long-chain, normal, 3-hydroxylated, and branched fatty acids. The most prominent fatty acids are tetradecanoic, iso- and anteiso-branched tetradecanoic, hexadecanoic, and 3-hydroxyeicosanoic acids. Minor fatty acids are 3-hydroxyeicosanoic (iso- and anteiso-branched) and 3-hydroxydocosanoic acid. Nurminenet al. (7Nurminen M. Rietschel E.T. Brade H. Infect. Immun. 1985; 48: 573-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) concluded that all hydroxy fatty acids are amide-linked and all nonhydroxylated fatty acids are ester-linked. However, essentially no structural information is presently available on the lipid A moiety of chlamydial LPS, perhaps because of difficulty in obtaining sufficient bacteria for LPS preparation. We previously determined the structures of the LPS from the rough mutants of Escherichia coli (8Qureshi N. Takayama K. Mascagni P. Honovich J. Wong R. Cotter R.J. J. Biol.

We now report the preparation, purification, and characterization of the lipid A derived from the LPS of C. trachomatis using a similar approach. The methyl derivative was purified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and characterized by using soft ionization mass spectrometry. The fatty acyl composition of chlamydial lipid A is complex, but follows a defined structural pattern. HPLC-grade chloroform, methanol, acetonitrile, and isopropyl alcohol were purchased from Burdick & Jackson (Muskegon, MI). Silica Gel H thin layer plates (250 μm) were purchased from Analabs Inc. (North Haven, CT). Dowex 50W-X8, Chelex 100, and Cellex-D were obtained from Bio-Rad. Cells of C. trachomatis serovar F (gift of H. Caldwell, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, Hamilton, MT) were grown in McCoy suspension culture on microcarrier beads as described by Tam et al. (17Tam J.E. Knight S.T. Davis C.H. Wyrick P.B. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 374-378PubMed Google Scholar). The organisms were purified by differential centrifugation followed by centrifugation through 32% Renografin in HSC buffer as described previously (18Tauber A.I. Pavlotsky N. Lin J.S. Rice P.A. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 1108-1112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified elementary bodies were stored at −80 °C in phosphate-buffered saline at a concentration of 109inclusion-forming units/ml. By a combination of scale-up and growing organisms over a long period (2 years), we were able to obtain enough elementary bodies to prepare sufficient amounts of LPS/lipid A for this study. The LPS was extracted by the method of Galanos et al.(19Galanos C. Luderitz O. Westphal O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 9: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar) as modified by Qureshi et al. (12Qureshi N. Mascagni P. Ribi E. Takayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5271-5278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 4.5 × 1013 elementary bodies were extracted sequentially with ethanol (5 ml, three times), acetone (5 ml, twice), and ether (3 ml, once). Dry cells (0.39 g) were extracted with 90% phenol/chloroform/petroleum ether (2:5:8; 5 ml, three times). In the extraction, the cells were sonicated for 10 min and stirred for 1 h. The phenol extracts were pooled, and the organic solvent was removed with a stream of nitrogen. The remaining phenol/water (1.4 ml) was mixed with a sufficient amount of water (1.0 ml) until turbid, and then 1 volume of diethyl ether and 5 volumes of cold acetone were added. This mixture was centrifuged to yield the rough chemotype LPS in the pellet, which was washed with ether and dried (yield, 13 mg). Chlamydial LPS (12 mg) was suspended in 0.1 m HCl and heated to 100 °C for 30 min. The resulting crude MPLA was centrifuged at 8000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was suspended in a two-phase chloroform/methanol/water solvent (10:5:6) and centrifuged. The lower organic layer was recovered, filtered, and evaporated to dryness. The MPLA (6 mg) was converted into the free acid form by passing through Chelex 100 (Na+) and Dowex 50 (H+) columns, as described previously (12Qureshi N. Mascagni P. Ribi E. Takayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5271-5278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and methylated with diazomethane. HPLC was performed with two Waters 6000A solvent delivery systems, a Waters 660 solvent programmer, a U6K universal liquid chromatograph injector, a variable wavelength detector (Model LC-85B, Perkin-Elmer), and a Nova-Pak cartridge (8 mm × 10 cm, C18-bonded, 5 μm, silica; Waters Associates, Milford, MA) used at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. A linear gradient of 30–100% isopropyl alcohol in acetonitrile was used over a period of 60 min. The wavelength of the detector was set at 210 nm. The peak fractions were recovered and analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS). HPLC-purified methylated MPLA (100 μg) was hydrolyzed in 2.5 ml of 4 m HCl at 100 °C for 5 and 18 h for fatty acid analysis. The fatty acids were extracted and derivatized to the methyl or converted to thep-bromophenacyl esters as described previously (16Qureshi N. Takayama K. Seydel U. Wang R. Cotter R.J. Agrawal P.K. Bush C.A. Kurtz R. Berman D.T. J. Endotoxin Res. 1994; 1: 137-148Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Gas chromatography-MS of the methyl esters of fatty acids was carried out on a Carlo Erba Fractovap® 4161 gas chromatograph with a DB5 capillary column (60 m, 1-μm film, 0.32-mm inner diameter). The effluent was coupled directly into an ion source of a Kratos MS-25 mass spectrometer at a resolution of 600 (1 s/decade from 544 to 45 atomic mass units, 2-kV acceleration for 600-atomic mass unit mass range, 50-eV electron energy using electron impact ion source). The injector temperature was 280 °C. The column was programmed at 100–300 °C. The interface and source temperatures were 350 and 300 °C, respectively, as described previously (16Qureshi N. Takayama K. Seydel U. Wang R. Cotter R.J. Agrawal P.K. Bush C.A. Kurtz R. Berman D.T. J. Endotoxin Res. 1994; 1: 137-148Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The p-bromophenacyl esters of the fatty acids were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC as described previously (16Qureshi N. Takayama K. Seydel U. Wang R. Cotter R.J. Agrawal P.K. Bush C.A. Kurtz R. Berman D.T. J. Endotoxin Res. 1994; 1: 137-148Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The fractions were recovered and analyzed by electron impact MS. Liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry (LSIMS) spectra of HPLC-purified dimethylated MPLA were acquired on a Concept IH two-sector mass spectrometer (Kratos Analytical, Manchester, United Kingdom) at a resolution of 1000. A 1-μl aliquot of sample solution in methanol/chloroform (1:2) was mixed with the matrix (either 3-nitrobenzyl alcohol or monothioglycerol) on the tip of the probe. Analyte ions were desorbed from the matrix by an 8-keV Cs+ primary ion beam. The mass spectra were acquired by scanning the magnet in the range of 100–2500 atomic mass units at a scan rate of 10 s/decade. The B/E-linked scans were employed to acquire the spectra of the product ions following collision-induced dissociation (CID; xenon, 50% attenuation) of the precursor ions in the first field-free region of the mass spectrometer (tandem MS utilizing a sector instrument). About 10–20 scans were averaged per spectrum. All matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization/time-of-flight (MALDI/TOF) mass spectra were acquired on a Kompact III time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Kratos Analytical) with a dual-stage reflectron. In most cases, gentisic acid (2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid) was used as a matrix. Analyte ions were desorbed from the matrix with a 337-nm nitrogen laser irradiation. Each spectrum was an average of 50 scans. All matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization/ion trap (MALDI/IT) mass spectra were acquired on an extensively modified Finnigan MAT quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer described elsewhere (20Doroshenko V.M. Cotter R.J. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 10: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Analyte ions were desorbed from the matrix (nicotinic acid) with a fourth harmonic (226 nm) laser irradiation from a neodymium:YAG laser (Quantel International, Santa Clara, CA). Spectra acquired from the ion trap were processed using a TOFware® data system (Ilys Software, Pittsburgh, PA). The LPS of C. trachomatis was acid-hydrolyzed to yield crude MPLA, which was converted to the free acid and methylated with diazomethane. Dimethyl-MPLA was fractionated by reverse-phase HPLC. A representative profile of such a fractionation is shown in Fig. 1. The results of HPLC suggested that this dimethyl-MPLA preparation is an extremely complex mixture of several structural series. By comparison, the HPLC profile of the dimethyl-MPLA derived from the LPS of S. minnesota R595 under similar conditions gave a simple pattern (12Qureshi N. Mascagni P. Ribi E. Takayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5271-5278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). C. trachomatis dimethyl-MPLA revealed one major peak (peak 7) and two other prominent peaks (complex peak 6 and simple peak 8) within the elution time of 36–42 min. Smaller amounts of lower structural series were found within 27–36 min (peaks 1–5), as well as a minor lipid A of higher structural series (peak 9). All of these peak fractions were collected and analyzed for size and fragmentation by secondary ion mass spectrometry. The fatty acyl contents were determined by HPLC. One major peak and several minor peaks were observed at 30–40 min. These peaks were collected and analyzed. Each peak was composed of a very complex mixture of a homologous series of lipid A. Gas chromatography-MS of the methyl esters of the fatty acids obtained from either chlamydial LPS or HPLC peak 7 showed that the pentaacyl-MPLA contains C20OH. The normal fatty acids were C14, C15, C16, C18, C19, C20, and C21, of which C14, C15, and C18 were the most prominent in lipid A. HPLC peak fraction 7 contained traces of C16. C21OH and C22OH were minor components in this fraction. Our results were essentially consistent with those of Nurminen et al. (7Nurminen M. Rietschel E.T. Brade H. Infect. Immun. 1985; 48: 573-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The major HPLC peak fraction 7 showed multiple quasi-molecular ions of MNa+ at m/z 1780, 1794, 1808, 1822, and 1836 in each of the mass spectra acquired using MALDI MS and LSIMS (Fig. 2). The positive-ion MALDI/TOF MS and MALDI/IT mass spectra showed that the distal phosphate group was cleaved, giving rise to MNa+-PO4H(CH3)2 peaks at m/z 1654, 1668, 1682, 1696, and 1710. The loss of the ester-linked C14 was observed in the positive-ion MALDI/IT spectrum at m/z 1553, 1567, 1581, 1595, and 1609. The loss of both phosphate groups and C14 gave rise to MNa+-PO4H(CH3)-C14peaks at m/z 1426, 1440, 1454, 1468, and 1482. These results show that the major lipid A of the LPS of C. trachomatis is a complex mixture of structural homologs containing five fatty acids (pentaacyl lipid A). The positive-ion LSIMS spectrum also showed a minor series of peaks atm/z 1916, 1930, 1944, 1958, and 1971. These peaks were consistent with the formation of matrix adducts with 3-nitrobenzyl alcohol (Fig. 2 C). The negative-ion LSIMS spectrum (Fig.3) showed even more facile cluster ion formation when using 3-nitrobenzyl alcohol as a matrix, and the major high-mass peaks were observed at m/z 1909, 1923, 1937, 1951, and 1965. It should be noted that [M − H]− and [M − 2H + Na]− ions were also present in the negative-ion LSIMS spectrum, but were not as abundant as the matrix adducts. Only [M − H]− ion peaks could be seen in the high-mass region of the negative-ion LSIMS spectrum when monothioglycerol was used as a matrix (data not shown). The positive-ion LSIMS spectrum contained structurally informative fragment ions in the lower mass region (Fig. 2 C). The five most abundant peaks in the 800–1500-atomic mass unit mass region werem/z 1057, 1071, 1085, 1099, and 1113, corresponding to oxonium ions that represented the distal subunit (B1fragment ions) (Fig. 4) (12Qureshi N. Mascagni P. Ribi E. Takayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5271-5278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Costello C.E. Vath J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 738-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The number of peaks and their intensity distribution within these oxonium ions suggested that they are derived from the corresponding quasi-molecular ions (MNa+) and that these subunits are the source of structural heterogeneity of HPLC peak fraction 7 (variation in the fatty acyl content). This fragmentation showed that the distal subunit contains three fatty acyl groups, while the reducing subunit has just two fatty acyl groups. Structural information regarding the kinds of fatty acids present in lipid A was obtained from the low-mass portion of the negative-ion LSIMS spectrum (data not shown). An abundant peak at 125 atomic mass units corresponded to a phosphate fragment ion of PO4H(CH3)2−, while peaks at 227, 241, and 255 atomic mass units indicated the presence of C14, C15, and C16 fatty acyl groups. Interestingly, a peak at 269 atomic mass units due to C17 was not present in the spectrum, while peaks at 283, 297, 311, and 326 atomic mass units suggested the presence of C18, C19, C20, and C21fatty acyl groups. There was no evidence of ester-linked hydroxy fatty acids. These observations are in good agreement with the results of normal fatty acid analysis by gas chromatography-MS. No peak corresponding to hydroxy fatty acid was detected in the low-mass region of the negative-ion LSIMS spectrum, suggesting that these groups are linked to the sugar moiety via stable amide bonds, while normal fatty acyl groups are linked via labile ester bonds. To provide further insight into the structure of lipid A, product-ion spectra of high-energy CID of MNa+ quasi-molecular ions were acquired on a sector instrument using B/E-linked scans. Since the mass window in these experiments is rather wide, products of more than just one precursor were detected in each experiment. Nevertheless, these experiments provided very useful structural information about chlamydial lipid A. Although CID spectra were acquired for four precursor ions in HPLC peak fraction 7 (at m/z 1780, 1794, 1808, and 1822), we will only discuss the CID spectrum of the precursor ion at m/z 1794 (Fig. 5). The high-mass fragments corresponded to loss of a C18 fatty acyl group as well as consecutive losses of a phosphate group and a C14fatty acyl group (loss of C15 was also possible). The loss of only one phosphate group was observed in the spectrum, confirming that this lipid A preparation is monophosphorylated. The CID spectra also gave information regarding the structures of the distal subunit of methylated MPLA. The oxonium ion resulting from the dissociation of lipid A with MNa+ at m/z 1794 was at m/z 1071. The appearance of a fragment ion peak at 787 atomic mass units showed that the C18 fatty acyl group is present in the distal subunit of lipid A (1071-C18). The other fatty acyl group was C15 since we observed a peak atm/z419, atomic mass units, probably corresponding to B1-C18-C15-PO4H(CH3)2. There was no evidence of the presence of C17. These fragment ions also established that the phosphate group is present at the distal subunit of lipid A. This suggests that the fatty acyl groups in the distal segment are probably C15 (R1) and C20OC18 (R2). A minor component containing C14 (R1) and C21OC18 (R2) is also possible. The other alternative would be the presence of C18(R1) and C20OC15(R2). The reducing end segment of lipid A would then contain C14(R3) and C20OH (R4) (TableI). The two remaining fragment ion peaks at 696 and 710 atomic mass units can now be assigned as Y1+and 0,1X1+ (22Takayama K. Qureshi N. Morrison D.C. Ryan J.L. Bacterial Endotoxin Lipopolysaccharides. I. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 44-65Google Scholar), respectively (Fig.4). The proposed structures for the major homologous series present in HPLC peak fraction 7 are listed in Table I. These results allow us to propose the fatty acyl distribution in the reducing and distal subunits of a major dimethyl-MPLA component. It is not presently possible to determine which structure represents the major component; however, it is clear that we have a mixture. The quasi-molecular ions were subjected to high-energy CID, and the spectra of product ions were acquired (an example is shown in Fig. 5). The fragments identified as oxonium ions allowed us to determine the ester-linked fatty acyl content in the distal segments. Since the loss of the acyloxyacyl and hydroxy fatty acyl groups was not observed, we concluded that they are amide-linked. Positive-ion MALDI/TOF MS and LSIMS of HPLC peak fraction 8 yielded molecular ions (MNa+) at m/z 1808, 1822, 1836, 1850, and 1864 (Fig. 6 and TableII). The CID spectra of the above-listed molecular ions showed oxonium ions at m/z 1071, 1085, 1099, 1113, and 1127, respectively (data not shown). A similarly sized range of molecular ions was observed in HPLC peak fraction 7 (Fig. 2 and Table I). Only the quasi-molecular ion at m/z 1836 was subjected to high-energy CID, and the spectrum of product ions was acquired (data not shown). The fragment identified as the oxonium ion allowed us to determine the ester-linked fatty acyl content in the distal segment. Since the loss of the acyloxyacyl and hydroxy fatty acyl groups was not observed, we concluded that they are amide-linked. HPLC peak fraction 9 was also analyzed by MALDI/TOF MS and LSIMS (data not shown). The results suggested that this trace component represents the incompletely hydrolyzed component of chlamydial lipid A. HPLC peak fractions 1–6 were similarly analyzed and found to be tetraacyl-MPLA. No further work was done on these fractions. It is not clear whether some tetraacyl-LPS existed in the original sample since treatment of LPS with 0.1 m HCl at 100 °C causes the release of ester-linked fatty acids (22Takayama K. Qureshi N. Morrison D.C. Ryan J.L. Bacterial Endotoxin Lipopolysaccharides. I. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 44-65Google Scholar). The literature on the structure of the LPS from C. trachomatis is meager. One significant study directly relates to the structure of the lipid A moiety (7Nurminen M. Rietschel E.T. Brade H. Infect. Immun. 1985; 48: 573-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, chemical analyses of the LPS revealed the presence of d-glucosamine, normal and hydroxy fatty acids, Kdo, and phosphate. This composition suggested that it is a rough chemotype LPS. The normal fatty acids were C12, C14, C15, C16, C18, and C20, and the hydroxy fatty acids were C20OH, C21OH, and C22OH. Evidence was found that only normal fatty acids are ester-linked. A limited supply of LPS (due to difficulties in preparing the bacteria in tissue culture) has prevented further in-depth study. By a combination of scale-up and growing organisms over a long period, we were able to obtain enough elementary bodies to prepare a sufficient amount of LPS. This allowed us to begin to examine the structure of the lipid A moiety of the LPS. About 12 mg of LPS were hydrolyzed under mild acid conditions to yield MPLA (with ∼50% yield); this was converted to the methyl esters (phosphate esters) and purified by reverse-phase HPLC. The HPLC elution pattern immediately suggested that the lipid A derived from this LPS is a complex mixture (Fig. 1). We collected nine peak fractions, examined them by mass spectrometry, and identified peak fractions 1–6 as tetraacyl-MPLA, peak fractions 7 and 8 as pentaacyl-MPLA, and peak fraction 9 as the incompletely hydrolyzed bisphosphoryl lipid A. We selected the major HPLC peak fractions 7 and 8 to study the chemical structure of the lipid A moiety of chlamydial LPS. Fatty acid analysis of these HPLC peak fractions after acid hydrolysis by gas chromatography-MS revealed the composition to be similar to that found by Nurminen et al. (7Nurminen M. Rietschel E.T. Brade H. Infect. Immun. 1985; 48: 573-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We then examined these two select fractions by MALDI MS and LSIMS. The negative-ion spectra showed the presence of quasi-molecular ions (MNa+) (listed in Table I) that gave us the molecular masses of each of the dimethyl-MPLA components. Each of the HPLC peak fractions 7 and 8 showed the presence of five different structural components based on size. Furthermore, the spectra showed the presence of oxonium ions that represented the distal fragment of dimethyl-MPLA. Each oxonium ion was structurally related to the corresponding molecular ion. This allowed us to estimate the size of the reducing segment of each dimethyl-MPLA. We showed the results of analysis of the quasi-molecular ion (MNa+) at m/z 1794 (a major component of HPLC peak fraction 7) by high-energy CID. High-mass fragments were present in the spectrum, showing the loss of C14, C15, and C16 fatty acids. With this knowledge, we were able to assign the R values for the distal segment of this component (Table I). We proposed possible structures for the distal segment of this representative dimethyl-MPLA. Similar CID analysis was performed on the other molecular ions in HPLC peak fractions 7 and 8. Because HPLC peak fractions 7 and 8 showed identical structural series for the oxonium ions (Tables I and II), suggesting that the distal segments of the two series are also identical, the structural differences between the two fractions must be due to differences in the reducing segments. Because we now knew the sizes of the reducing segments of dimethyl-MPLAs and the fatty acid composition of lipid A (i.e. normal fatty acids are ester-linked, the hydroxy fatty acids are amide-linked, and the reducing segment has only two fatty acids), we were able to determine the fatty acid distribution in the reducing segment of chlamydial lipid A (Tables I and II). In HPLC peak fraction 7, the most probable structure is where R3 is C14 and R4 is C20OH. In HPLC peak fraction 8, the major component might have R3 as C15 and R4 as C20OH. It is to be noted that these two structural series differ by 14 atomic mass units. Thus, the structural series representing HPLC peak fractions 7 and 8 only differ by one methylene in the fatty acid in the reducing segment. Based on this study, the major lipid A component of chlamydial LPS is a glucosamine disaccharide that contains five fatty acids (pentaacyl) and a phosphate group in the distal segment. A minor lipid A component might be the tetraacyl lipid A that we identified in the acid-hydrolyzed product. Although not studied (at the bisphosphoryl lipid A level), we suspect the presence of a second phosphate group, presumably at the anomeric carbon of the disaccharide. Three fatty acyl groups were in the distal segment, and two were in the reducing segment. The acyloxyacyl group was located in the distal segment in amide linkage. All normal fatty acids were ester-linked, and all hydroxy fatty acids were amide-linked. These results are consistent with the classical structure of lipid A derived from LPS of other Gram-negative bacteria (22Takayama K. Qureshi N. Morrison D.C. Ryan J.L. Bacterial Endotoxin Lipopolysaccharides. I. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 44-65Google Scholar). The position of the 4′-phosphate and the (β1→6) linkage of the glucosamine disaccharide will be confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The proposed general structure of the dimethyl-MPLA derived from chlamydial LPS is shown in Fig. 4, along with the assignment of the R (fatty acyl) groups in Tables Iand II. A general pattern of the structure of lipid A of chlamydial LPS has emerged from this study. There are two basic structural series based on separation by reverse-phase HPLC. These are HPLC peak fractions 7 and 8, where the structural difference (14 atomic mass units) occurs within the reducing segment. Within each of these two series, there are nearly identical secondary series. This is a homologous series that differs by 14 atomic mass units, and this difference resides in the distal segment. Thus, the major chlamydial lipid A consists of at least 20 homologous structural components. Chlamydial LPS was less potent than Enterobacteriaceae LPS, as defined by its ability to activate mononuclear phagocytes and a Chinese hamster ovary cell line transfected with the putative LPS receptor CD14 (4Ingalls R.R. Rice P.A. Qureshi N. Takayama K. Lin J.S. Golenbock D.T. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3125-3130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structural basis for this low potency might be due to the following differences in the lipid A structure of chlamydial LPS. (a) It has five rather than six fatty acyl groups; (b) its fatty acyl groups are longer than C14; and (c) it contains normal fatty acids rather than hydroxy fatty acids attached directly to the glucosamine disaccharide in ester linkage. Such structural information provides a meaningful explanation for the clinical syndrome associated with Chlamydia, which often results in severe infections without significant local and systemic symptoms."

Machlin L.J. Handbook of Vitamins. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1991: 341-392Google Scholar). Mammals cannot synthesize PLP de novo and require dietary precursors such as pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, and pyridoxine (classified collectively as vitamin B6). Synthesis of PLP from these inactive precursors requires a phosphorylation reaction that is catalyzed by pyridoxal kinase (EC2.7.1.35). This enzyme activity has also been detected in bacteria where it functions in a related PLP salvage pathway (2Hill R.E. Spenser I.D. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium.2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 695-704Google Scholar). Dietary precursors of PLP are phosphorylated by pyridoxal kinase in the liver and released to the bloodstream in association with albumin (3Merrill A.H. Henderson J.M. Wang E. McDonald B.W. Millikan W.J. J. Nutr. 1984; 114: 1664-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 4Brin M. J. Nutr.Human Vitamin B6 Requirements. National Academy of Sciences, Washington, D.

Food and Nutrition Press, Westport, Connecticut1980: 27-51Google Scholar). However, circulating PLP must be dephosphorylated by membrane-associated phosphatases before gaining entry to target cells. After diffusing through cell membranes, it is converted back to the active cofactor by intracellular pyridoxal kinase. In consequence, there is a requirement for ubiquitous expression of the kinase in mammalian tissues. Although the major pathways of vitamin B6 metabolism have been established for many years, there remains little understanding of how PLP homeostasis is controlled in mammals. Recently, valuable insights to this problem have been provided by genetic manipulation of an enzyme involved with PLP dephosphorylation (6Waymire K.G. Mahuren J.D. Jaje J.M. Guilarte T.R. Coburn S.P. MacGregor G.R. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). However, similar studies on the role of pyridoxal kinase have not been possible owing to the absence of any identified pyridoxal kinase genes from eukaryotic sources. Previously, a cytosolic protein of unknown function was purified from porcine brain by benzodiazepine-affinity chromatography (7Kirkness E.F. Turner A.J. J. Neurochem. 1988; 50: 356-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Here, peptide fragments of this protein were used to isolate a homologous human cDNA. This cDNA encodes a protein that exhibits both the physical and enzymic properties of pyridoxal kinase. The activity of the recombinant enzyme was shown to be modulated by ligands of mammalian benzodiazepine receptors. In addition, the cDNA sequence was used to determine the tissue-expression pattern and chromosomal location of the human pyridoxal kinase gene. Flunitrazepam and ethyl-β-carboline-3-carboxylate were purchased from Research Biochemicals International. 1012S (N-(2-aminoethyl)-8-chloro-6-(2-chlorophenyl)-4H-(1,2,4)- triazolo-(1,5-a)-benzodiazepine-2-carboxamide) was donated by Dr. K. Hirai, Shinogi Research (Osaka, Japan). PK-11195 (1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide) was a gift from Dr. G. Le Fur, Pharmuka Industries (Gennevilliers, France). Pyridoxal, PLP, and 4-deoxypyridoxine were from Sigma. The HEK-293 cell line (ATCC CRL 1573) was obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Purified P36 protein (7Kirkness E.F. Turner A.J. J. Neurochem. 1988; 50: 356-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) was cleaved with cyanogen bromide, and three peptides were resolved by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography using standard methodology (8Harris J. Benedict F. A Biometric Study of Basal Metabolism in Man. Carnegie Institution, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Washington, DC1919Google Scholar). Each of the purified peptides was coupled tod-phenylenediisothiocyanate glass, and subjected to solid-phase Edman degradation as described previously (9Findlay J.B.C. Pappin D.J.C. Keen J.N. Findlay J.B.C. Geisow M. Protein Sequencing: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 69-84Google Scholar). The three P36 peptide sequences were searched against the human cDNA data base (HCD) (10Kirkness E.F. Kerlavage A.R. Cowell I.G. Austin C.A. cDNA Library Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, New Jersey1996: 261-268Google Scholar), using the TBLASTN algorithm (11Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (64694) Google Scholar). All three peptides displayed significant homology with the same translated cDNA sequence (see Fig. 1). This cDNA assembly (1210 bp) contained an open reading frame of 936 bp from the first in-frame methionine residue (see Fig. 1). The open reading frame was amplified from human testes cDNA (CLONTECH) using the primers, 5′-ccggccctcgaggatCCAGGCCCGGCATGGAGGAGGAGT and 5′-ccggccatgcatCAGGGACAAACACGGAGACACCAA. Amplification at 95 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min was performed for 35 cycles using the XL PCR system (Perkin-Elmer). Reaction products were purified from agarose gels and either sequenced directly or ligated into pCDM8 (Invitrogen) for expression studies. The cloned cDNA was sequenced over its entire length to ensure that no mutations had been introduced during amplification. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with calf serum (10%), penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). Cells were plated at ∼20% confluence 24 h prior to transfection. Transfection of the PKH cDNA, cloned in pCDM8, was performed with a calcium phosphate-DNA precipitate in HEPES buffer (8Harris J. Benedict F. A Biometric Study of Basal Metabolism in Man. Carnegie Institution, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Washington, DC1919Google Scholar). Following incubation with the precipitate for 24 h, the cells were washed and cultured for a further 48 h before harvesting. Transfection efficiency was assessed by using pCMVβ (CLONTECH) for expression of β-galactosidase activity in the transfected cells (12Herbomel P. Bourachot B. Yaniv M. Cell. 1984; 39: 653-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Prior to harvesting, the adherent cells were washed five times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm sodium phosphate, 140 mm sodium chloride, 5 mm potassium chloride, pH 7.4). The cells were then scraped in phosphate-buffered saline, collected by centrifugation (1000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), and hand-homogenized. Following centrifugation (40000 ×g, 60 min, 4 °C), the supernatant was frozen and stored at −80 °C. The pyridoxal kinase activity of cell extracts was measured by a fluorometric assay (13Sussmane S. Koontz J. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 225: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell extracts (5–10 μg of protein) were incubated at 37 °C in 200 μl of a substrate solution containing 0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 6.4), 1 mm ATP, 0.1 mm zinc chloride, and 1–20 μm pyridoxal. After 60 min, 40 μl of 6 mm hydoxylamine was added, and the fluorescence was measured using a CytoFluor 2350 fluorometer (Millipore). Excitation and emission wavelengths were 360 and 460 nm, respectively. A unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of protein that catalyzes the formation of 1 nmol of PLP/min at 37 °C. Preparatory studies demonstrated that the rate of PLP production was constant for at least 60 min under these assay conditions. The open reading frame of the PKH cDNA (Fig. 1) was labeled with 32P using the NEblot random priming system (New England Biolabs). This probe was hybridized with human RNA blots (CLONTECH) according to manufacturer instructions. The blots were washed at 60 °C in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS prior to exposure. Blots were stripped of probe by boiling in 0.5% SDS and re-hybridized with a32P-labeled fragment of the human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA (nucleotides 789–1140) (14Tokunaga K. Nakamura Y. Sakata K. Fujimori K. Ohkubo M. Sawada K. Sakiyama S. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 5616-5619PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, a cytosolic protein (P36) of unknown function was purified from porcine brain by benzodiazepine-affinity chromatography (7Kirkness E.F. Turner A.J. J. Neurochem. 1988; 50: 356-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). A purified preparation of this protein was cleaved with cyanogen bromide, and three peptide fragments were resolved by high performance liquid chromatography. The sequences of these peptides (see Fig.1) were used to search the HCD data base of translated human cDNAs. The cDNA sequences in HCD are assembled from overlapping expressed sequence tags (ESTs) that were derived from a random selection of human cDNA clones (10Kirkness E.F. Kerlavage A.R. Cowell I.G. Austin C.A. cDNA Library Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, New Jersey1996: 261-268Google Scholar). All three peptides displayed homology to the same translated cDNA assembly (86–94% identity). This assembly (1210 bp) contains a large open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 312 amino acid residues (Fig. 1). The sequence of the open reading frame was confirmed after obtaining an independent cDNA clone from human testes mRNA. The sequence of the open reading frame was used to search data bases of DNA and protein sequences. This search identified many anonymous fragments of human DNA that display exact identity with the cDNA sequence (see below). In addition, several genes of non-human origin were found to exhibit significant homology (Table I). Of these, the most similar sequences are hypothetical proteins of unknown function, derived from yeast or bacteria. However, it was also possible to detect significant homology with the pdxK gene ofEscherichia coli (27% amino acid identity with 5 gaps, Fig.2 A). This gene encodes a pyridoxine/pyridoxal/pyridoxamine kinase that functions in a salvage pathway of vitamin B6 metabolism (15Yang Y. Zhao G. Walker M.E. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 141: 89-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An enzyme with similar properties is known to exist in eukaryotic cells (16McCormick D.B. Gregory M.E. Snell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2076-2084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kwok F. Churchich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6489-6495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) though the genes that encode it have not yet been identified. Preparations of pyridoxal kinase have been purified from several mammalian sources (17Kwok F. Churchich J.E. J. Biol.

Significantly, both of these peptides are homologous to the translated cDNA sequence (Fig.2 B). These sequence comparisons indicate that the cloned cDNA encodes a human homologue of pyridoxal kinase (termed PKH).Table IHomologous proteins in GenBank data baseHomologueGenBank accession No.Amino acid residues% Identity (gaps)Hypothetical protein (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)U1853031238 (9)Hypothetical protein (S. cerevisiae)Z7164231736 (10)Hypothetical protein (Haemophilus influenzae)U3272328829 (6)Pyridoxal kinase (pdxK) (E. coli)U5370028327 (5)Hypothetical protein (Salmonella typhimurium)U1124328727 (6)Ribokinase (E. coli)M1316930923 (10) Open table in a new tab To examine the PKH protein for enzymic activity, the cDNA was expressed transiently in human embryonic kidney cells. These cells normally contain only low levels of pyridoxal kinase activity (<0.01 units/mg of protein at 20 μm pyridoxal). However, this activity was increased by more than 100-fold following transfection with the PKH cDNA (1.2–1.5 units/mg of protein). The recombinant enzyme displayed a K m value of 3.3 μmfor pyridoxal (Fig. 3 A). It was inactive in the presence of 5 mm EDTA or in the absence of ATP. Enzymic activity was inhibited by 4-deoxypyridoxine (K i = 2.8 μm). This inhibition was competitive with respect to pyridoxal (Fig. 3 A). Previously, the porcine homologue of PKH was purified to homogeneity by virtue of its specific interaction with an immobilized benzodiazepine, 1012S. This interaction could be blocked by low concentrations (10–100 μm) of β-carbolines or free 1012S but was insensitive to all other benzodiazepine-receptor ligands that were examined (7Kirkness E.F. Turner A.J. J. Neurochem. 1988; 50: 356-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In the presence of a high concentration of pyridoxal (20 μm), both 1012S and ethyl-β-carboline-3-carboxylate were potent inhibitors of the human enzyme (IC50 = 2 and 5 μm, respectively; Fig. 3 B). Inhibition was not competitive with respect to either pyridoxal or ATP but displayed a complex pattern that could not be explained adequately by simple noncompetitive or uncompetitive mechanisms (data not shown). Other ligands of benzodiazepine receptors, such as flunitrazepam and PK-11195, had little effect on recombinant PKH activity (Fig.3 B). Expression of the PKH gene in human tissues was assessed by probing mRNA blots with the PKH cDNA at high stringency (Fig.4). A major transcript of 1.5 kb was detectable in all tissues examined, and was particularly abundant in the testes. Two larger transcripts (4.4 and 7.9 kb) were also detectable in most tissues. In brain, the 7.9-kb transcript was the major hybridizing species. However, in all other tissues examined, the larger transcripts were of relatively low abundance. The GenBankTM data base of DNA sequences contains several accessions that are exact matches to fragments of the PKH cDNA. These anonymous sequences are either human ESTs, sequence-tagged sites, products of exon-trapping, or large fragments of genomic DNA. Several of the accessions are known to be derived from chromosome 21q22 (e.g.Z47290) and thereby provide the location of the PKH gene. Furthermore, efforts by Stanford Human Genome Center to sequence a potential disease locus at chromosome 21q22.3 have revealed a BAC clone from this region (BAC B159G9) that contains almost the entire PKH gene on 10 distinct exons. 2The sequence of BAC B159G9 can be obtained athttp://shgc. stanford.edu/. This study describes the first example of a eukaryotic gene that encodes pyridoxal kinase activity. Identification of the PKH gene arose from analysis of an unusual benzodiazepine-binding protein (P36) that was isolated previously from porcine brain (7Kirkness E.F. Turner A.J. J. Neurochem. 1988; 50: 356-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The PKH protein is the human homologue of P36 and displays significant sequence similarity to a pyridoxal kinase of E. coli. Regions of the PKH protein are also homologous to peptide fragments of purified ovine pyridoxal kinase. Together, these data indicate that PKH and P36 are human and porcine pyridoxal kinases, respectively. Previously, P36 was detected in the cytosolic fraction of several porcine tissues and was demonstrated to consist of two subunits (each ∼36,000 Da) (7Kirkness E.F. Turner A.J. J. Neurochem. 1988; 50: 356-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). These properties are consistent with the reported properties of purified ovine pyridoxal kinase (18Kerry J.A. Rohde M. Kwok F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 153: 581-585Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To provide conclusive identification, the PKH cDNA was expressed transiently in human embryonic kidney cells. The pyridoxal kinase activity of these cells was increased by more than 100-fold following transfection with the PKH cDNA. The recombinant enzyme displayed aK m value for pyridoxal (3.3 μm) that is within the range of values reported for mammalian preparations of pyridoxal kinase (3–50 μm) (16McCormick D.B. Gregory M.E. Snell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2076-2084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kwok F. Churchich J.E. J. Biol.

Competitive inhibition by 4-deoxypyridoxine and a requirement for ATP and divalent cations are properties of PKH that are also consistent with mammalian pyridoxal kinases (16McCormick D.B. Gregory M.E. Snell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2076-2084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kwok F. Churchich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6489-6495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies of the porcine P36 protein, demonstrated that it could bind to an immobilized benzodiazepine-receptor ligand, 1012S. This binding could be blocked by low concentrations of β-carboline derivatives but not by other structural classes of benzodiazepine-receptor ligands (7Kirkness E.F. Turner A.J. J. Neurochem. 1988; 50: 356-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). It was therefore predicted that 1012S and β-carbolines, but not flunitrazapam or PK-11195, would bind to recombinant PKH. Consistent with this prediction, 1012S and ethyl-β-carboline-3-carboxylate were found to be potent inhibitors of PKH activity while flunitrazapam and PK-11195 had no effect. The site through which this inhibition is mediated appears to be distinct from the binding sites for pyridoxal or ATP and may represent a new target to probe the structural requirements for PKH catalysis. It also provides a convenient means for purification of pyridoxal kinase. Consistent with its ubiquitous role in vitamin B6metabolism, pyridoxal kinase activity has been detected in a wide variety of mammalian tissues (16McCormick D.B. Gregory M.E. Snell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2076-2084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and transcripts of the PKH gene were detected in all tissues examined (Fig. 4). The authors are unaware of any previous studies in which the pyridoxal kinase activity of testes has been examined. The very high level of hybridizing mRNA in this tissue indicate that it may be a rich source of the enzyme. For the majority of tissues examined, the most abundant species of hybridizing transcript is approximately 1.5 kb in length. However, larger transcripts (4.4 and 7.9 kb) were also detectable in most tissues and were particularly abundant in the brain. These mRNAs may reflect the use of alternative polyadenylation sites or the existence of highly homologous genes. Human homologues of the PKH cDNA were not detected in current EST data bases. However, it may be relevant that an antiserum raised against porcine P36 cross-reacted with a larger protein (M r = 73,000) that is located in brain membranes (7Kirkness E.F. Turner A.J. J. Neurochem. 1988; 50: 356-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Future screening of human genomic DNA libraries with the PKH cDNA should help to resolve the question of potential gene homologues. The PKH gene is located on chromosome 21q22.3. Consistent with this finding, individuals with chromosome 21 trisomy (Down's syndrome) have been reported to display increased pyridoxal kinase activity (23Coburn S.P. Mahuren J.D. Schaltenbrand W.E. J. Ment. Defic. Res. 1991; 35: 543-547PubMed Google Scholar). Although vitamin B6 metabolism is known to be altered in Down's syndrome (24McCoy E.E. Colombini C. Ebadi M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1969; 166: 116-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), its relevance to symptoms of the disorder is unknown at present. A genetic disease of unknown etiology, autoimmune polyglandular disease type 1, has also been mapped to chromosome 21q22.3 (25Aaltonen J. Bjorses P. Sandkuijl L. Perheentupa J. Peltonen L. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 26Bjorses P. Aaltonen J. Vikman A. Perheentupa J. Ben-Zion G. Chiumello G. Dahl N. Heideman P. Hoorweg-Nijman J.J.G. Mathivon L.

Although there is no obvious connection between vitamin B6 metabolism and this unusual disorder, the PKH gene is clearly a candidate for mutational analysis in affected families. Identification of the PKH gene now permits detailed analyses of pyridoxal kinase function at both the molecular and physiological levels. Site-directed mutagenesis will complement studies of protein-modification (20Dominici P. Scholz G. Kwok F. Churchich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14712-14716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Churchich J.E. J. Protein Chem. 1990; 9: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) that have begun to define the structural requirements for catalytic activity. The future use of transgenic animals to explore the physiological consequences of disrupting the function of pyridoxal kinase is also likely to provide valuable insights to its role in the control of vitamin B6metabolism.

We report here that newly synthesized docosahexaenoyl (DHA) phospholipids are sequestered and cotransported by rhodopsin-bearing post-Golgi vesicles to ROS. Frog retinas were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine and [3H]DHA prior to ROS isolation and subcellular fractionation. After a 1-h pulse, relatively uniform [3H]DHA-lipid labeling (DPM/μg protein) was observed in all fractions enriched in post-Golgi vesicles, TGN, Golgi, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. During the subsequent 2-h chase translocation of free [3H]DHA from ROS to the photoreceptor inner segment contributed to an additional overall increase in labeling of lipids. The specific activity (dpm/nmol DHA) in ER-enriched fraction was similar or higher than in other subcellular fractions after both the pulse and the chase, indicating that the bulk of [3H]DHA-lipids was synthesized in the ER. After the chase a 2-fold increase in labeling of lipids in the ER and Golgi and a 2.6-fold in lighter TGN-enriched fractions was observed. The highest labeling was in the post-Golgi vesicle fraction (4-fold increase), with [3H]DHA-phosphatidylcholine and [3H]DHA-phosphatidylethanolamine showing the greatest increase. At the same time, newly synthesized [35S]rhodopsin shifted from the ER and Golgi toward TGN and post-Golgi fractions. Therefore, sequestration and association of [35S]rhodopsin and [3H]DHA-lipids in a TGN membrane domain occurs prior to their exit and subsequent vectorial cotransport on post-Golgi vesicles to ROS. Labeling of ROS lipids was very low, with phosphatidylinositol and diacylglycerols displaying the highest labeling. This indicates that other mechanisms by-passing Golgi, i.e. facilitated by lipid carrier proteins, may also contribute to molecular replacement of disc membrane DHA-phospholipids, particularly phosphatidylinositol.

This indicates that other mechanisms by-passing Golgi, i.e. facilitated by lipid carrier proteins, may also contribute to molecular replacement of disc membrane DHA-phospholipids, particularly phosphatidylinositol. Vertebrate photoreceptors are polarized and compartmentalized cells, with a photosensitive outer segment and a synaptic terminal domain at opposite ends of the cell. These domains are attached through a connecting cilium and a short axon, respectively, to a central region, the inner segment. The inner segment is the site where lipid and protein synthesis, polarized sorting of molecules, and initiation of membrane biogenesis for both the outer segment and synaptic terminals take place.

The visual pigment rhodopsin, which accounts for more than 85% of disc membrane proteins (1Papermaster D.S. Dreyer W.J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), is embedded within a highly fluid lipid bilayer comprised of phospholipids (PLs) highly enriched in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) (2Aveldaño de Caldironi M.I.

Amphibian photoreceptor cells are a useful experimental model to study protein and lipid trafficking in a polarized cell. Photoreceptors actively synthesize proteins (mainly rhodopsin) and DHA-PLs to support the dynamic daily renewal of 50–80 large disc membranes in each rod cell that results in the addition of membrane at ≃3 μm2/min (7Besharse J.C. The Retina: A Model for Cell Biological Studies.in: Adler R. Farber D. Academic Press, Inc., New York1986: 297-352Google Scholar, 8Deretic D. Papermaster D.S. Progress in Retinal and Eye Research.in: Osborne N.N. Chadek G.J. 14. Pergamon Press Inc., Tarrytown, NY1995: 249-265Google Scholar). ROS lack the capacity for de novo synthesis of PLs (4Fliesler S.J. Anderson R.E. Prog. Lipid Res. 1983; 22: 79-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar, 9Choe H.-G. Ghalayini A.J. Anderson R.E. Exp. Eye Res. 1990; 51: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Therefore, they depend entirely on an external supply of PLs from the inner segment where they are synthesized mainly in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (10Mercurio A.M. Holtzman E. J. Neurocytol. 1982; 11: 295-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). How these highly unsaturated lipids become components of ROS membranes and at which stage of membrane biosynthesis and disc morphogenesis they become associated with rhodopsin is not yet clear. Newly synthesized rhodopsin is vectorially transported from its site of synthesis in the rough ER to ROS by vesicles that bud from the trans-Golgi network (TGN), cluster beneath the connecting cilium, and fuse with the inner segment plasma membrane within the periciliary ridge complex (11Papermaster D.S.

Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1281-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A very low buoyant density (ρ = 1.09 g/ml) post-Golgi vesicular subcellular fraction carrying newly synthesized rhodopsin has been isolated and characterized from frog retinal photoreceptor cells (12Deretic D. Papermaster D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1281-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 13Deretic D. Papermaster D.S. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 803-813PubMed Google Scholar, 14Deretic D.

Papermaster D.S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 215-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas rhodopsin and the bulk of DHA-PLs are synthesized in the rough ER and both can follow a vesicle-mediated traffic through the biosynthetic pathway, other mechanisms can contribute to trafficking and selective delivery of PLs to intracellular organelles (16Bishop W.R. Bell R.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 579-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 17Pagano R.E. Curr. Opin.

For example, the rapid monomer transport of PLs is facilitated by transfer proteins (TP) through the cytosol (19Cleves A. McGee T. Bankaitis V. Trends Cell Biol. 1991; 1: 30-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). A transfer protein that with high affinity transfers PC to ROS membranes has also been described (20Dudley P.A. Anderson R.E. FEBS Lett. 1978; 95: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and immunohistochemical analysis of chicken retinas at hatching revealed the presence of phosphatidylinositol (PI)-TP in retinal cells including the inner segment of photoreceptors (21Sellner P.A. Dalton T.P. Helmkamp G.M. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci.ARVO. 1991; 32: 1149Google Scholar). Phospholipid renewal of ROS membranes involves both membrane replacement (as new disc membranes are assembled at the base of the ROS) and molecular replacement (i.e. PL transfer protein mediated and remodeling of disc PLs by turnover) (22Bibb C. Young R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 61: 327-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 23Young R.W. Invest. Ophthalmol. 1976; 15: 700-725Google Scholar). Using various radiolabeled lipid precursors under experimental conditions that inhibit protein synthesis or vesicle-mediated transport, lipids can be transported to ROS by independent pathways by-passing the Golgi (24Fliesler S.J. Basinger S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17516-17523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Fliesler S.J. Florman R. Keller R.K. Exp.

J. Neurocytol. 1993; 22: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However sorting of DHA-PLs, vectorial transport to ROS, and the contribution of alternative pathways to their trafficking has not been experimentally addressed. This question is especially intriguing because biochemical and autoradiographic studies of [3H]DHA trafficking in frog photoreceptors after in vitro (29Rodriguez de Turco E.B. Gordon W.C. Bazan N.G. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3667-3678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Rodriguez de Turco E.B. Gordon W.C. Bazan N.G. Curr. Eye Res. 1993; 13: 21-28Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and in vivo (31Gordon W.C. Bazan N.G. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 2190-2202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Gordon W.C. Bazan N.G. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1993; 34: 2402-2411PubMed Google Scholar) labeling have disclosed that newly synthesized [3H]DHA-PLs display a polarized delivery to ROS, where they are incorporated at the base as new discs are formed, in a pattern paralleling incorporation of radiolabeled amino acids into disk membrane proteins. The aim of the current study was to investigate if newly synthesized DHA-lipids could be, at least in part, segregated and cotransported with rhodopsin in vesicles budding from the TGN and then enter the ROS as new membranes are formed (membrane replacement). To address this question, we pulse-labeled frog retinas for 1 h in the presence of [3H]DHA and [35S]methionine/cysteine, followed by a 2-h chase in a cold buffer prior to subcellular fractionation (12Deretic D. Papermaster D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1281-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 33Deretic D. Papermaster D.S. Methods for the Study of Photoreceptor Cells.in: Hargrave P. 15. Rockefeller University Press, New York1993: 108-120Google Scholar). [3H]DHA was chosen because this precursor is actively esterified into PLs in the inner segment of photoreceptor (34Louie K.

Gordon W.C. Bazan N.G. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3667-3678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,30Rodriguez de Turco E.B. Gordon W.C. Bazan N.G. Curr. Eye Res. 1993; 13: 21-28Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Our results reveal that newly synthesized [3H]DHA-PLs, especially the main components of disc membranes (i.e. DHA-phosphatidylcholine (PC) and DHA-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)), are segregated and loaded together with newly synthesized [35S]rhodopsin in post-Golgi vesicles. Some lipids, i.e. [3H]DHA-PI and [3H]DHA-diacylglycerols (DAG), are very rapidly synthesized and delivered to ROS probably by alternative pathways that by-pass the Golgi and may be facilitated by carrier proteins. Frogs, Rana berlandieri (100–250 g), were purchased from Rana Co. (Brownsville, TX), maintained in a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle, and fed crickets for a week prior to the experiment. [4, 5-3H]DHA (specific activity 17 Ci/mmol) and [35S]Express protein labeling mixture (1,000 Ci/mmol) were from DuPont NEN. High performance thin layer chromatographic plates (10 × 10 cm, 150 μm thickness) were from Analtech (Newark, DE). Lipids and fatty acid methyl ester standards and protease inhibitors were from Sigma. High performance liquid chromatography grade solvents were from EM Science (Gibbstown, NJ). All other reagents used were of the highest purity available. Retinas recovered from frog eyecups 2 h before the time of light offset were dissected and subsequently incubated under dim red light. Two sets of 21 retinas were incubated in 30 ml of an oxygenated medium as described (14Deretic D. Aebersold R.H. Morrison H.D. Papermaster D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16853-16861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Bazan N.G. Phospholipids in the Nervous System.in: Horrocks L.A. Ansell G.B. Porcellati G. Raven Press, NY1982: 49-62Google Scholar) at 22 °C in the presence of [3H]DHA (5.7 μCi/retina, final DHA concentration 0.24 μm), and [35S]Express protein labeling mixture (25 μCi/retina) for 1 h. One set of retinas was further incubated for 2 h in cold buffer containing unlabeled amino acids (pulse-chase samples) prior to subcellular fractionation. Since the in vitroretinal metabolism of [3H]DHA is altered at μm DHA concentrations (29Rodriguez de Turco E.B. Gordon W.C. Bazan N.G. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3667-3678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Rodriguez de Turco E.B. Gordon W.C. Bazan N.G. Curr.

Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci..ARVO. 1992; 32: 702Google Scholar), cold DHA was not added during the chase. Therefore, this chase period will hereafter be identified as “chase” to reflect this condition. All the procedures followed for the isolation of ROS and subcellular fractionation have been described in detail elsewhere (12Deretic D. Papermaster D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1281-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 33Deretic D. Papermaster D.S. Methods for the Study of Photoreceptor Cells.in: Hargrave P. 15. Rockefeller University Press, New York1993: 108-120Google Scholar). Briefly, following the pulse and pulse-chase labeling, retinas were sheared through a 14-gauge needle, and ROS were separated by flotation on 34% sucrose. Retinal pellets were rehomogenized in 0.25 m sucrose in 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm MgCl2 and centrifuged for 4 min at 4,000 rpm (1250 g av, JA20 rotor, Beckman Instruments, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). The postnuclear supernatant (3 ml) recovered after this centrifugation is enriched in photoreceptor biosynthetic membranes and organelles involved in rhodopsin transport (12Deretic D. Papermaster D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1281-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 33Deretic D. Papermaster D.S. Methods for the Study of Photoreceptor Cells.in: Hargrave P. 15. Rockefeller University Press, New York1993: 108-120Google Scholar). To isolate post-Golgi vesicles from TGN, Golgi, and ER membranes, the postnuclear supernatant was overlaid on a 10-ml linear 20–39% (w/w) sucrose gradient in 10 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitors and 1 mm MgCl2, above a 0.5-ml cushion of 49% (w/w) sucrose in the same buffer. Gradients were centrifuged for 13 h at 4 °C in a SW40 rotor (Beckman) at 28,000 rpm (100,000g av). Fourteen fractions (0.9 ml each) were reproducibly collected from the top of the gradient. A Buchler Auto Densi-Flow fractionator was used to prepare the gradient and to collect the fractions. The subcellular fractions were diluted 4-fold with 10 mm Tris-HCl and pelleted at 50,000 rpm (240,000g av) for 40 min in a SW50 rotor. The pellets were resuspended in 210 μl of Tris acetate, pH 7.4, and divided into two aliquots, one-third for protein analysis and two-thirds for lipid analysis. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described previously (12Deretic D. Papermaster D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1281-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). 35S-Labeled rhodopsin was determined in subcellular fractions by exposure of dried SDS gels to storage phosphor screens, and the intensity of luminescence associated with the rhodopsin band was measured and analyzed by a PhosphorImager densitometer (Molecular Dynamics). Total proteins were quantified according to Fanger (40Fanger B.O. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Lipids were extracted from the fractions by adding 3 ml of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v) following the Folch procedure (41Folch J. Lees M. Stanley G.H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Individual phospholipids and neutral lipids were isolated in the same TLC plate following a two-dimensional, three-step TLC procedure (6Choe H.-G. Anderson R.E. Exp. Eye Res. 1990; 51: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) as follows: an aliquot of the labeled lipid extract containing phospholipid and neutral lipid standards as a carriers was applied on the lower right corner (1.5 cm from each border) of 10 × 10 cm high performance thin layer chromatography plates previously sprayed with 3% magnesium acetate and activated for at least 1 h at 100 °C. The plate was developed in the first dimension twice using the Rouser I chromatographic system (chloroform/methanol/ammonia, 65:25:5, v/v) until the solvent front reached 2 cm from the top of the plate. After drying with cold air, the plate was turned to the right 90°, and neutral lipid standards (cholesterol ester, triacylglycerol, diacylglycerol, and monoacylglycerol) were spotted 1.5 cm from the bottom and 0.5 cm from the right border. Plates were then developed in hexane/ether (60:40, v/v) to isolate individual neutral lipids that had accumulated at the front of the first chromatographic system. The silica gel was cut with a vertical line to isolate neutral lipid (right) from phospholipid (left) areas of the plate (approximately 3 cm from the right border), and the silica was scraped off from the bottom right corner prior to running the plates in the Rouser II system (chloroform/acetone/ methanol/acetic acid, 30:40:10:10:5, v/v). This third chromatographic step, run in the same direction as the second step, allows the isolation of individual phospholipid classes and free fatty acids that run with the solvent front above PE. Lipid spots were visualized by iodine staining, and the radioactivity was determined in a Beckman scintillation counter. Aliquots of lipid extracts were taken for gas-liquid chromatography analysis of endogenous fatty acid content and composition. Fatty acid methyl esters were prepared in glass tubes by transmethylation with 2 ml of toluene/methanol/sulfuric acid (100:100:4, v/v) for 4 h at 65 °C, after flushing the tubes with nitrogen and capping with a Teflon-lined cap. The tubes were cooled at room temperature, and 1 ml of water, 3 ml of hexane, and a mixture of two internal standards (17:0 and 21:0 methyl esters) were added. Fatty acid methyl esters resuspended in hexane were separated onto a SP-2330 column (30 m, 0.25 mm inner diameter, 0.2-μm film thickness, Suppelco, Bellefonte, PA) by using helium as a carrier gas, in a Varian Vista 401 gas chromatograph (Palo Alto, CA). The injector and detector temperatures were 220 and 250 °C, respectively, and the column temperature was programmed from 70 to 230 °C (42Marcheselli V.L. Bazan N.G. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1990; 1: 231-237Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The peaks were detected by flame ionization, identified by comparison with the retention times of authentic fatty acid methyl esters standard, and quantified using the internal standards. Values for [3H]DHA lipid labeling and [35S]rhodopsin are presented as a mean ± S.E. for n = four individual experiments. Data were compared using Student's t test for pair samples. Ap value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To determine whether newly synthesized [3H]DHA-PLs and [35S]rhodopsin are transported together in the same population of post-Golgi vesicles recovered in fraction 5 of the sucrose gradient, retinas were pulse-labeled for 1 h in the presence of both precursors and further incubated for 2 h (chase) in cold buffer prior to subcellular fractionation. This experimental protocol gives sufficient labeling of newly synthesized rhodopsin within 1-h pulse and a maximum labeling of the vesicles (fraction 5) during the following 2-h chase (12Deretic D. Papermaster D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1281-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 43Deretic D. Puleo-Scheppke B. Trippe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2279-2286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). While the total [35S]rhodopsin labeling recovered from the combined 14 fractions was similar for pulse and chase samples (data not shown), total esterified [3H]DHA was increased by 2.6 ± 0.2-fold: from 1.2 × 106 dpm/21 retinas after a 1-h pulse to 3.2 × 106 dpm/21 retinas after a 2-h chase. After 1 h of pulse labeling, 58% of total [35S]rhodopsin was recovered in TGN and Golgi (fractions 7–11) (Fig. 1) as expected (12Deretic D. Papermaster D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1281-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). After a 2-h “chase,” a shift toward post-Golgi fractions 4–6 was observed, with fraction 5 displaying the greatest increase (ratio chase/pulse: 2.4 ± 0.5). The profile of total esterified [3H]DHA among subcellular fractions was similar to that of [35S]rhodopsin (Fig. 1), with the highest percent values observed in those fractions that also accumulated the largest proportion of membranes (Fig. 2 D). Remarkably after the 2-h chase only post-Golgi fraction 5 displayed significantly higher [3H]DHA percent labeling (ratio chase/pulse, 1.7 ± 0.2) at the time when newly synthesized [35S]rhodopsin accumulated in this fraction. Simultaneously, percent labeling in fractions 12 and 13 was lower than during the pulse. Labeling recovered from individual subcellular fractions based upon protein content is shown in Fig. 2 and reveals four features. First, after a 1-h pulse, all fractions displayed similar labeling of esterified [3H]DHA (Fig. 2 B). Second, after the subsequent 2-h “chase,” labeling of DHA-lipids increased at least 2-fold in the heavy fractions that correspond to the density of ER (13Deretic D. Papermaster D.S. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 803-813PubMed Google Scholar, 14Deretic D. Aebersold R.H. Morrison H.D. Papermaster D.S. J. Biol.

Cytochem. 1986; 34: 5-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 12Deretic D. Papermaster D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1281-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and TGN (10Mercurio A.M. Holtzman E. J. Neurocytol. 1982; 11: 295-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), by 2.6-fold in lighter TGN fractions 7–9, and peaking at 4-fold higher labeling in post-Golgi vesicles recovered in fraction 5 as compared with pulse-labeled values (Fig. 2, B-C). Third, no significant difference between pulse and chase labeling was observed in the free [3H]DHA pool, indicating an equilibrium between the arrival of the precursor to these membrane compartments and its esterification into lipids either by de novo synthesis and/or turnover (Fig. 2 A). The peak of labeling observed in fraction 8 may be the result of free [3H]DHA contributed by a small proportion of heavily labeled ROS cosedimenting between fractions 7 and 9 at a buoyant density of 1.13 g/ml (12Deretic D. Papermaster D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1281-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Fourth, most of the label recovered from ROS after pulse and chase labeling was found as free DHA (92 ± 1 and 76 ± 1%, respectively) (Fig.2 A), whereas ROS lipids labeling was the lowest among all subcellular fractions analyzed (Fig. 2 B). A 2.5-fold increase in ROS [3H]DHA-lipids labeling after the “chase” (from 138 ± 25 to 350 ± 40 dpm/μg protein) accounted for by the concomitant loss of only 15% of free [3H]DHA (from 2600 to 1160 dpm/μg protein). The specific activity of total [3H]DHA-lipids (dpm/nmol of endogenous DHA content) showed that fraction 14 (ER) displayed, after both the pulse (2790 ± 245 dpm/nmol DHA) and the “chase” (5060 ± 840 dpm/nmol DHA) labeling, similar or higher values than other fractions. After the pulse labeling, the specific activity of fraction 5 (1990 ± 115 dpm/nmol DHA) was significantly lower than that of fraction 14 (p < 0.05). After the chase, the specific activity of fraction 5 increased 3-fold (6580 ± 550 dpm/nmol DHA) but was not significantly different from the specific activity of fraction 14 (p> 0.19). The two most abundant PLs in retinal membranes, PC and PE, reveal a similar labeling profile after a 2-h “chase” (Fig. 3). [3H]DHA-PC and [3H]DHA-PE gradually increased from fractions enriched in ER to heavy fractions of the TGN, with a sharp peak in post-Golgi fraction 5 reaching a 5.2- and 4.6-fold increase, respectively, above pulse labeling. The profile of [3H]DHA-PI was very similar to that of [3H]diacylglycerol (DAG), and their labeling was significantly increased only in TGN fractions 7–9, with the highest increase in post-Golgi fraction 5 (3.9- and 2.5-fold, respectively). PS was the only phospholipid that did not show a peak of labeling in fraction 5 but displayed 3-fold increase between fractions 5 and 7. Phosphatidic acid (PA) labeling gradually increased from ER fractions to post-Golgi fraction 5 with no significant differences from the 1-h pulse labeling. [3H]DHA-PL labeling in ROS was very low (Fig. 3,insets) with a different pattern of distribution than all other subcellular fractions (Fig. 4). Although the small amount of ROS that is recovered in the gradient between fraction 7 and 9 may contribute to their highly free [3H]DHA labeling (Fig. 2), it cannot contribute to but rather results in an underestimation of lipid labeling in these fractions that arise from inner segment membranes. [3H]DHA-PI displayed, by far, the highest labeling in ROS, with a 7.9-fold increase after a 2-h “chase,” followed by DAG (4.8-fold), PC, and PS (3-fold each). No differences were observed between a 1-h pulse and 2-h “chase” labeling in [3H]DHA-PE and [3H]DHA-PA (Fig.3, insets). This short-term incubation may reflect the labeling of disc membrane lipids by molecular replacement including (a) [3H]DHA incorporation by turnover, (b) the fast transport from the inner segment of a portion of newly synthesized [3H]DHA-lipids (i.e.[3H]DHA-PI), and/or (c) further metabolism of newly incorporated [3H]DHA-PLs into ROS such asN-methylation of [3H]DHA-PE to [3H]DHA-PC (4Fliesler S.J. Anderson R.E. Prog. Lipid Res. 1983; 22: 79-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar, 44Roque M.E. Giusto N.M. Exp. Eye Res. 1995; 60: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The percent distribution of esterified [3H]DHA displayed high values for PI, PC, and PE in all fractions except for ROS (Fig.4). In fraction 5"

Here we describe a naturally truncated isoform, NFI-B3, which is derived from the human NFI-B gene, in addition to characterizing further human NFI-B1 and NFI-B2, two differentially spliced variants previously isolated from hamster and chicken. Although NFI-B1 and NFI-B2 proteins are translated from an 8.7-kilobase message, the mRNA for NFI-B3 has a size of only 1.8 kilobases. The NFI-B3 message originates from the failure to excise the first intron downstream of the exons encoding the DNA binding domain and subsequent processing of this transcript at an intron-internal polyadenylation signal. The translation product includes the proposed DNA binding and dimerization domain and terminates after translation of two additional “intron” encoded codons. In SL-2 cells, which are void of endogenous NFI, NFI-B3 by itself had no effect on transcriptional regulation and failed to bind DNA. Coexpression of NFI-B3 with other isoforms of the NFI-B, -C, and -X family, however, led to a strong reduction of transcriptional activation compared with the expression of these factors alone. Gel shift analysis indicated that NFI-B3 disrupts the function of other NFI proteins by reducing their DNA binding activity by heterodimer formation. The efficiency of NFI-B3 heterodimers to bind to DNA correlated with the degree of transcriptional repression.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2607-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The highly conserved 189-amino acid NH2-terminal region of NFI is required for DNA binding and dimerization (1Mermod N. O'Neill E.A. Kelly T.J. Tjian R.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal transactivation domain diverges extensively, both among factors derived from different genes as well as between different spliced isoforms derived from the same gene. A high proportion of proline residues is common to all of them, suggesting that transcriptional activation occurs through proline-rich sequences (1Mermod N. O'Neill E.A. Kelly T.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 58: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). The proline-rich region of NFI/CTF seems dispensable for transcriptional activation in yeast, however (19Altmann H.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3825-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) suggests that the individual isoforms may have distinct functions. NFI/CTF isoforms, first isolated from human HeLa epithelial cells and later from pig liver, function as transcriptional activators with a broad range of transactivation potential in different cellular environments (1Mermod N. O'Neill E.A. Kelly T.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 58: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 19Altmann H. Wendler W. Winnacker E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2416-2421Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We and others have shown recently that differentially spliced isoforms from the human (24Apt D. Liu Y. Bernard H.U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3825-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and mouse (26Nebl G. Cato A.C. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1995; 41: 85-95PubMed Google Scholar) NFI-X genes can function as transcriptional repressors, and some of these isoforms are expressed differentially in different human tissues (24Apt D. Liu Y. Bernard H.U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3825-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 27Sumner C. Shinohara T. Durham L. Major E.O. Amemiya K. J. Neurovirol. 1996; 2: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A novel repressor domain, which inhibits DNA binding in vitro, was also characterized for Xenopus laevis NFI-X isoforms (28Roulet E. Armentero M.T. Krey G. Corthesy B. Dreyer C. Mermod N. Wahli W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5552-5562Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The underlying mechanism for the varying function of the different isoforms is not clearly understood. It has been demonstrated that the transcriptional activation of NFI/CTF-1 in yeast depends on a sequence motif related to the heptapeptide repeat of the COOH-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (29Xiao H. Lis J.T. Xiao H. Greenblatt J. Friesen J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1966-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 30Wendler W. Altmann H. Winnacker E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2601-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Another member of the NFI-C family which lacks this domain was found to be an even more potent activator, however (25Wenzelides S. Altmann H. Wendler W. Winnacker E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2416-2421Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The activity of individual NFI isoforms may also be modulated by other factors as observed with the transforming growth factor-β responsive region, located in the proline-rich activation domain of NFI/CTF-1 (31Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Tsai-Pflugfelder M. von der Weid T. Wahli W. Mermod N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3051-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Our earlier studies indicated that NFI plays a crucial role in the epithelial cell type-specific transcription of human papillomaviruses (9Apt D. Chong T. Liu Y. Bernard H.U. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4455-4463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Gloss B. Yeo-Gloss M. Meisterernst M. Rogge L. Winnacker E.L. Bernard H.U.

Differences in the gel shift pattern of NFI proteins between human epithelial cells, where the viral enhancer is active, and human fibroblast cells, which do not support viral transcription, suggested that fibroblast cells express a different subset of NFI proteins than do epithelial cells, which express mainly factors of the NFI-C family (9Apt D. Chong T. Liu Y. Bernard H.U. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4455-4463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Santoro C. Mermod N. Andrews P.C. Tjian R. Nature. 1988; 334: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The screening of a human fibroblast library led to the isolation of NFI-X1, an isoform that represses the activity of NFI/CTF by the formation of heterodimers (24Apt D. Liu Y. Bernard H.U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3825-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition to different spliced isoforms of the NFI-X family, we also isolated a novel clone of the NFI-B family from human fibroblast cells. Two spliced isoforms of the NFI-B gene, NFI-B1 and NFI-B2, have been isolated before from chicken and hamster liver cells (13Gil G. Smith J.R. Goldstein J.L. Slaughter C.A. Orth K. Brown M.S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2607-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), but no human homologs have been characterized so far. Here we describe a novel NFI-B form, NFI-B3, and its expression pattern and functional characteristics. We show that NFI-B3 is encoded on a 1.8-kb mRNA, which is generated by use of a premature polyadenylation site located in an intron. In contrast, NFI-B1 and NFI-B2 are generated by alternative splicing, leading to an 8.7-kb message. NFI-B3 is a truncated protein that lacks the transcriptional activation domain. It cannot bind to DNA as a homodimer or as a heterodimer with NFI-B2, but it binds in the form of a heterodimer with isoforms of the NFI-C and NFI-X family. For functional analysis we also cloned the human homolog of chicken NFI-B2 and show that the truncated NFI-B3 protein can repress the transcriptional activity of NFI-B,- -C, and -X isoforms containing full-length activation domains. The chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT)-reporter construct pαCAT3xAd contains the wild-type α-globin promoter and three consensus NFI binding sites from the adenovirus origin of replication (1Mermod N. O'Neill E.A. Kelly T.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 58: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). The NFI expression vectors pXJ-NFI-X1, pXJ-NFI-X2, and pCGND-CTF-1, pADH-CTF-2, and pADH-CTF-3 have been described previously (9Apt D. Chong T. Liu Y. Bernard H.U. J.

To construct the expression vectors pXJ-NFI-B3 and pXJ-NFI-B2, the cDNA inserts were isolated from the respective phage clones by polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) using cDNA insert-flanking primers (cDNA insert-screening amplifiers,Clontech) and cloned into the EcoRI site of a cytomegalovirus promoter-driven expression plasmid pXJ40 (34Xiao J.H.

A commercially available human skin fibroblast cDNA library (Clontech HL 1052a) was screened with a previously isolated 1.2-kb NFI-X cDNA clone, FN6, under hybridization conditions as described (9Apt D. Chong T. Liu Y. Bernard H.U. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4455-4463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From a total of 5 × 105 individual plaques, eight positive clones were purified. The cDNA inserts were amplified by PCR and subcloned into the EcoRI site of pUC19, and both strands of the cDNAs were sequenced. Genomic DNA (SiHa cells) and total RNA (HeLa, MRHF, H4 and HISM cells) for PCRs was prepared using TRIzol Reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction (Life Technologies, Inc.). First strand cDNA synthesis and subsequent PCRs were performed as described (9Apt D. Chong T. Liu Y. Bernard H.U. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4455-4463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primer pairs YB14-YB15, YB14-YB31, and Do108-Do109 were used for PCR analysis. YB14 (5′-AGTACCGATGGAGAGCG-3′) and YB15 (5′-CCATCTGTGACAGCTCA-3′) are located on the NFI-B3 cDNA; YB31 (5′-GATCATTGTGGCTTGGACT-3′) and YB11 (5′-ATGATGTGGCTGGACAC-3′) on the NFI-B1 and NFI-B2 cDNAs as shown in Fig.1 A. Two primers with the sequence 5′-ATGATGTATTCTCCAATCT-3′ (Do108) and 5′-CTCAGTTGCTGCTTTCTGCT-3′ (Do109) are located at the 5′ and the 3′ regions of chicken NFI-B1 and NFI-B2 cDNA. The PCR products were directly sequenced with the PCR primers using Seqi Therm Cycle Sequencing Kits (Epicentre Technologies). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from total RNA using the Poly(A)Ttract mRNA isolation system (Promega). Approximately 1.5 μg of mRNA was separated on a 1% agarose gel and blotted to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham Corp.). The multiple tissue Northern blot containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA of each of various human tissues was obtained from Clontech. DNA probes containing the 5′-untranslated region (position 76–440 bp) and the novel 3′ sequence of NFI-B3 (position 1009–1270 bp) were created by PCR with NFI-B3 cDNA template. The filters were probed in a hybridization solution containing 0.5m sodium phosphate, pH 7.9, 7% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 15% formamide, and about 107 cpm/ml of the random primed labeled novel 3′ sequence of NFI-B3 (random primed DNA labeling kit, Boehringer Mannheim). After a 16-h incubation at 65 °C, filters were washed in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.9, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate for 30 min at room temperature, followed by wahsing three times for 10 min at 65 °C. The filters were reprobed under the same conditions with the 5′-untranslated probe, after stripping them in boiling washing solution, three times for 1 min. After exposing the filter to an autoradiographic film, the radiographic signals were quantified on a PhosphorImager and Image Quant program (Molecular Dynamics). The human epithelial cell lines HeLa, SiHa, and Caski as well as the fibroblast line MRHF were cultured as described before (33Chong T. Apt D. Gloss B. Isa M. Bernard H.U. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5933-5943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The human smooth muscle cell line HISM (ATCC, CRL-92) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The H4 human neuroglioma line (ATCC, HTB-148) was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g glucose/liter and 10% fetal calf serum. Drosophila Schneider SL-2 cells were grown in Schneider's insect medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 25 °C. Twenty-four h before transfection, the cells were seeded at a density of 106cells/ml and then transfected by calcium phosphate coprecipitation as described (36Chan W.K. Klock G. Bernard H.U. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3261-3269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three μg of an NFI expression vector (pXJ-NFI-B3, -B2, -X2, or pCGND-CTF-1) was cotransfected with 3 μg of the reporter construct pαCAT3xAd, and pUC19 plasmid DNA was added as a carrier to a total of 10 μg of DNA. Cells were harvested 36–38 h after transfection, and 50 μg of protein was used for each CAT assay. The correct expression of NFI-B3 and NFI-B2 from the pXJ40 vector construct, which contains a T7 promoter upstream of the cloning site, was tested by in vitro transcription and translation. The plasmids (0.5 μg) were added separately to 50 μl of a reaction mix containing T7 RNA polymerase and rabbit reticulocyte lysate (TNT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System, Promega). The electrophoretically separated protein products, which had incorporated [35S]methionine, were observed by autoradiography. Nuclear extracts of Drosophila SL-2 cells transfected with 5 μg of pXJ-NFI-B3, pXJ-NFI-B2, pXJ-NFI-X2, and pCGND-CTF-1 were prepared according to Schreiber et al. (37Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3916) Google Scholar). Gel shift assays were performed with an oligonucleotide representing an Ad-NFI consensus binding site as described previously (9Apt D. Chong T. Liu Y. Bernard H.U. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4455-4463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA-protein complexes were separated on a 4.5% polyacrylamide, 0.25 × TBE gel. We have reported previously the isolation of a human NFI-X isoform in a screen of a human fibroblast cDNA library with an NFI-C probe and the detection of further NFI-X isoforms by rescreening the same library using this NFI-X clone as a probe (24Apt D. Liu Y. Bernard H.U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3825-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The same study led to the detection of a novel NFI-B cDNA. The 5′ region to this cDNA was homologous to the cDNA clones NFI-B1 and NFI-B2 originally isolated from hamster and chicken (13Gil G. Smith J.R. Goldstein J.L. Slaughter C.A. Orth K. Brown M.S. Osborne T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8963-8967Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 16Rupp R.A.W. Kruse U. Multhaup G. Gobel U. Beyreuther V. Sippel A.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2607-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar); however, sequences downstream of the DNA binding domain diverged from those of all known NFI sequences. This clone was termed YL11. Clone YL11 (GenBank™ accession number U70862) is 1,299 bp long, starting 457 bp upstream of an ATG initiation codon and terminating in a poly(A) tail downstream of a putative AATAAA consensus polyadenylation signal. The 3′-untranslated region of YL11 is 267 bp long. The sequence of 502 bp of the DNA binding domain is 99.8% similar to a human NFI-B segment amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR (18Qian F. Kruse U. Lichter P. Sippel A.E. Genomics. 1995; 28: 66-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). No homology with other known sequences could be found downstream of nucleotide 1015. Translation of the cDNA sequence reveals an open reading frame of 564 bp, coding for a 188-amino acid polypeptide chain. The NH2-terminal 186 amino acids are conserved among all known members of the NFI family and comprise the DNA binding domain. The remaining two amino acids, an alanine and arginine, replace the whole COOH-terminal transactivation domains observed in hamster NFI-B1 and chicken NFI-B1 and NFI-B2. Since the sequence similarity indicated that the COOH-terminal truncated YL-11 clone belonged to the NFI-B family, it was designated NFI-B3. To analyze the novel human NFI-B3 isoform and to compare it with other proteins and cDNAs derived from the NFI-B gene, we attempted to clone the human homologs of the hamster and chicken NFI-B1 and NFI-B2 isoforms. Reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed with RNA from MRHF fibroblast cells using a pair of primers, Do108 and Do109, flanking the full-length coding frames of chicken NFI-B1 and NFI-B2 cDNAs. No PCR product could be isolated and characterized from MRHF fibroblasts. We then performed similar PCR analyses with cDNAs generated from epithelial cells (HeLa and C33A) which resulted in a PCR product of 1.37 kb in both cell lines. The product from HeLa cells was subcloned and sequenced. Sequence alignment indicated that this cDNA is the human counterpart of chicken NFI-B2. A partial human NFI-B cDNA was recently amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR from human HepG2 cells (18Qian F. Kruse U. Lichter P. Sippel A.E. Genomics. 1995; 28: 66-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) which showed sequence identity to our NFI-B2 clone. No product of 1.68 kb, which would account for NFI-B1, could be amplified from the cDNAs used. To determine if the lack of a NFI-B1 PCR product is the result of an inefficient amplification of the larger product, PCR primers overlapping shorter segments were used. Using primer Do108 and YB11, which are located at the 5′ homologous region of the NFI-B cDNAs, a single band of the predicted size of 505 bp could be amplified from HeLa cDNA. Primer pair YB14 and Do109 led to the predicted fragment of 1,252 bp for NFI-B1 and 941 bp for NFI-B2. The identity of the fragments was verified by sequence analysis. A schematic diagram of the NFI-B isoforms and the location of the PCR primers are given in Fig. 1 A. The detection of a unique NFI-B gene in human genomic DNA by Southern blot hybridization (18Qian F. Kruse U. Lichter P. Sippel A.E. Genomics. 1995; 28: 66-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) suggests that all NFI-B isoforms are generated by alternative RNA processing from the same NFI-B gene. The region where the NFI-B3 cDNA diverges from NFI-B2 contains an AG/GCAAGG sequence similar to that of a consensus exon-intron junction (38Jackson I.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3795-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). It is possible that the novel sequence downstream of nucleotide 1015 bp of the NFI-B3 mRNA arises from splicing the 5′ exon to a new exon with an internal polyadenylation site. Alternatively, a polyadenylation signal in the adjacent intron may have been used to terminate the NFI-B3 transcript. To distinguish between these two hypotheses we performed PCR analysis on cDNA and genomic DNA with PCR primers flanking the potential splice junction site. If the novel sequence were derived from a intron contiguous to the sequence encoding the DNA binding domain, the PCR should generate identical fragments in cDNA and genomic DNA; however, if alternative splicing is employed, the PCR product from genomic DNA should be larger than the cDNA product, or, in case of very large intron, undetectable. PCR primer YB14 was derived from the known exon sequence, and primer YB15 from the novel sequence as indicated in Fig. 1 A. A PCR product of 267 bp was amplified from HeLa cDNA (Fig. 1 B, lane 1), MRHF cDNA (lane 2), and SiHa genomic DNA (lane 3). Sequencing analysis showed that the amplified fragment was identical in both genomic DNA and cDNAs. The specificity of the reaction was tested by a PCR performed with the reaction mix, including the primers, but substituting water for the DNA template. No product was amplified (data not shown). In control experiments PCRs on the same genomic DNA and cDNA preparations, primer YB14 was paired with primer YB31, derived from the known exon sequence of NFI-B1 and NFI-B2 (Fig.1 A). A PCR product of the expected size of 163 bp could be amplified from the cDNA preparations (lanes 4 and5) but not from genomic DNA (lane 6), confirming the presence of an intronic sequence between these two exons. These PCR results show that the NFI-B3 mRNA is generated by using a polyadenylation site present in the intron adjacent to the intermediary coding sequence, a mechanism thus far not described for any other NFI isoform. The expression of human NFI-B isoforms in epithelial and fibroblast cell lines as well as in different human tissues was analyzed by Northern blot hybridization. Filters containing poly(A)+ RNA from HeLa epithelial cells (Fig.2 A, lane 1), MRHF fibroblasts (lane 2), and different human tissue samples (lanes 3–10) were hybridized with the novel 3′ sequence of the NFI-B3 cDNA. One mRNA species of about 1.8 kb was detected in both cell lines in similar amounts and with significant quantitative variations in different human tissues. To confirm the identity of the 1.8-kb message the filters were reprobed with a 5′ fragment of NFI-B3. Since the first 550 bp of the coding region are highly similar among all members of the NFI family, we used the 5′-untranslated region of NFI-B3, which is conserved within the NFI-B family but which has no known homology to the NFI-A, -C, and -X cDNAs. A major mRNA species of about 8.7 kb was detected in HeLa cells and different tissues (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1 and 3–10) but not in MRHF fibroblast cells (Fig.2 B, lane 2). This 8.7-kb mRNA was also detected by reprobing the filter with the full-length NFI-B2 cDNA (data not shown), and a message of similar length has been described previously for NFI-B1 in hamster liver cells (13Gil G. Smith J.R. Goldstein J.L. Slaughter C.A. Orth K. Brown M.S. Osborne T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8963-8967Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The 1.8-kb mRNA was observed with the 5′ probe in all lanes only after longer exposure of the filter because of the lower expression of this message. In several human tissues and HeLa cells NFI-B3 mRNA is expressed about 6-fold lower than the 8.7-kb NFI-B1 and NFI-B2 mRNA, whereas it is the only detectable NFI-B mRNA in MRHF fibroblasts. The absence of the 8.7-kb message in fibroblast cells correlates with our observation from PCR analysis that NFI-B1 and NF1-B2 are not expressed or only at extremely low levels in human fibroblast cells. Fig.2 C shows the same filter probed with β-actin as control. The truncated NFI-B3 protein lacks a transcriptional activation domain but contains all four cysteine residues essential for DNA binding of full-length NFI proteins (39Novak A. Goyal N"
https://openalex.org/W2053308116,"Many steroid receptors, including chicken progesterone receptor, have been shown to be activated in the absence of their cognate ligands by modulators of kinases and phosphatases. To investigate the molecular mechanism of ligand-independent activation, chicken progesterone receptor mutants in which either one or all four of the previously identified phosphorylation sites have been changed to nonphosphorylatable alanine were analyzed for their ability to be activated by progesterone, 8-bromoadenosine 3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate, or a dopamine agonist, SKF82958. Our current study shows that the receptor is differently phosphorylated in ligand-dependent and ligand-independent activation. The transcriptional activity of the receptor in response to 8-bromoadenosine 3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate is affected by mutation of either Ser211 or Ser260. In addition, our data demonstrated that none of the four sites is absolutely required for the activation of the receptor by either 8-bromoadenosine 3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate or the dopamine agonist. Treatment with 8-bromoadenosine 3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate did not increase the overall level of receptor phosphorylation or cause phosphorylation of the receptor at alternate sites. These data raise the possibility that ligand-independent activation of the chicken progesterone receptor may be mediated through changes in the phosphorylation of coregulators or other protein factors interacting with the receptors.

In contrast to peptide hormones whose signals are transduced into the nucleus through membrane receptor-activated signal transduction pathways, steroid hormones act through intracellular receptors which themselves are ligand-regulated transcription factors (1Beato M.

The lipophilic hormones diffuse through the cell membrane, bind the receptors inside the cell, and transform them into active transcription factors. In this way, the signal carried by steroids is directly transduced into long term changes in gene expression without an absolute requirement for a phosphorylation cascade to mediate the effect. Studies in recent years have provided increasing evidence that there is cross-talk between the signaling processes induced by growth factors and steroids, and phosphorylation plays an important role in these processes. First, most, if not all, steroid receptors are phosphoproteins (8Denner L.A. Schrader W.T. O'Malley B.W. Weigel N.L. J. Biol.

Ligand-independent activation of steroid receptors may have important physiological and clinical implications for the study and treatment of the tumors of hormone-responsive organs. Very little is known about the molecular mechanism of ligand-independent activation for any of the receptors. Since steroid receptors are phosphoproteins, it is possible that alteration of receptor phosphorylation in response to different treatments mediates the ligand-independent activation. Chicken progesterone receptor (cPR) 1The abbreviations used are: cPR, chicken progesterone receptor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; AF, activation function; TAF, transactivation function; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; GRE, glucocorticoid response element(s); FBS, fetal bovine serum; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: cPR, chicken progesterone receptor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; AF, activation function; TAF, transactivation function; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; GRE, glucocorticoid response element(s); FBS, fetal bovine serum; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. is one of the steroid receptors that has been shown to be activated in a ligand-independent manner by modulators of kinases and phosphatases such as 8-bromoadenosine 3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate (8-bromo-cAMP), okadaic acid, vanadate, growth factors (e.g. EGF), and neurotransmitters (e.g. dopamine) (25Power R.F.

The phosphorylation sites in cPR have been identified (8Denner L.A. Schrader W.T. O'Malley B.W. Weigel N.L. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 241-246PubMed Google Scholar), making it possible to answer the question of whether the phosphorylation of the receptor is involved in or mediates the ligand-independent activation of the receptor. cPR is expressed as two forms, cPRB and cPRA, which lack the amino-terminal 128 amino acids of cPRB. Like the other members of the steroid/thyroid superfamily, cPR is composed of separable domains such as domains for DNA binding, hormone binding, and transcriptional activation (37Gronemeyer H.

Different from the DNA binding and hormone binding domains which are not further separable, two separable transcriptional activation domains have been identified in chicken progesterone receptor (37Gronemeyer H. Turcotte B. Quirin-Stricker C. Bocquel M.T. Meyer M.E. Krozowski Z. Jeltsch J.M. Lerouge T. Garnier J.M. Chambon P.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2581-2594Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The activation function 2 (AF-2, previously named transactivation function 2 or TAF-2), within the hormone binding domain is known to be regulated by hormone. In contrast to AF-2, the activation function 1 (AF-1, previously named transcriptional activation function 1 or TAF-1) is located in the amino-terminal region (37Gronemeyer H. Turcotte B. Quirin-Stricker C. Bocquel M.T. Meyer M.E. Krozowski Z. Jeltsch J.M. Lerouge T. Garnier J.M. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3985-3994Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 40Bocquel M.T. Kumar V. Stricker C. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2581-2594Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The fact that AF-1 is located in the sequence outside the hormone binding domain raises the possibility that the activity of AF-1 might be regulated by means such as phosphorylation rather than by ligand binding. Consistent with this idea, three out of the four phosphorylation sites identified in cPR are located in the A/B region (8Denner L.A. Schrader W.T. O'Malley B.W. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16548-16555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Poletti A. Weigel N.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 241-246PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the primary sequence of cPRB, the four identified phosphorylation sites are Ser211, Ser260, Ser367, and Ser530 (8Denner L.A. Schrader W.T. O'Malley B.W. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16548-16555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Poletti A. Weigel N.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 241-246PubMed Google Scholar). All four sites are in Ser-Pro motifs (8Denner L.A. Schrader W.T. O'Malley B.W. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16548-16555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Poletti A. Weigel N.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 241-246PubMed Google Scholar), and they account for all the Ser-Pro motifs in the receptor. The same phosphorylation pattern was detected in both cPRA and cPRB and is conserved between the endogenous receptor isolated from chicken oviduct and the recombinant receptor expressed in and purified from yeast (41Poletti A. Conneely O.M. McDonnell D.P. Schrader W.T. O'Malley B.W. Weigel N.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9563-9569Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Among the four sites, Ser211 and Ser260 are basally phosphorylated, but their phosphorylation is enhanced in response to hormone stimulation; Ser367 and Ser530 are phosphorylated primarily in response to progesterone treatment (8Denner L.A. Schrader W.T. O'Malley B.W. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16548-16555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,36Poletti A. Weigel N.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 241-246PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether any of the known phosphorylation sites in cPR is involved in or mediates the ligand-independent activation of the receptor, the four phosphorylation sites were mutated either individually or simultaneously to nonphosphorylatable alanines, and the responses of these mutant receptors to 8-bromo-cAMP and a dopamine agonist were assayed and compared with that of the wild type receptor. Our data show that receptor phosphorylation is not absolutely required for ligand-independent activation, raising the possibility that the ligand-independent activation of cPR might be mediated through changes in the phosphorylation of receptor-associated proteins such as coactivators and chaperone proteins that are known to play important roles in receptor function.

GRE2 e1bCAT (provided by Dr. John Cidlowski) is a simple promoter-based reporter composed of two progesterone/glucocorticoid response elements (GREs), the TATA box from the adenovirus e1b gene, and the cDNA sequence for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) (42Allgood V.E.

Biochemistry. 1996; 36: 224-232Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Replication-deficient adenovirus, dl312, was grown in human 293 embryonic kidney cells. The virus was released from the cells by three successive freeze/thaws of the cell pellet in phosphate-buffered saline. Following centrifugation at 2,500 rpm in a clinical centrifuge, the resulting supernatant was layered on top of a cesium chloride step gradient (1.5, 1.35, and 1.25 g/ml CsCl). Following centrifugation of the CsCl gradient at 150,000 ×g for 1 h at 10 °C, the adenovirus band (between the 1.25 and 1.35 g/ml layers) was removed and brought to a final concentration of 1.35 g/ml CsCl. The adenovirus was centrifuged again at 150,000 × g for 5 h at 10 °C, and the adenovirus band was collected and dialyzed against HEPES-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3) for 16 h at 4 °C with 50,000 molecular weight cutoff dialysis tubing. The dialysate was exposed to short wavelength UV light (254 nm) for 3 min. 8-Methoxypsoralen was added to the supernatant at a final concentration of 0.33 mg/ml, and the sample was exposed to long wavelength UV light (366 nm) for 20 min. The preceding treatments inactivated the viral genome without significant loss of infectivity. These treatments were a modification from a previously published method designed to inactivate adenovirus particles (44Cotten M. Saltik M. Kursa M. Wagner E. Maass G. Birnstiel M.L. Virology. 1994; 205: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 45Cotten M. Wagner E. Zatloukal K. Phillips S. Curiel D.T. Birnstiel M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6094-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). 8-Methoxypsoralen was removed from the virus preparation by G25 gel filtration chromatography. Adenovirus (1.4 × 1011 particles) was mixed with 160 μl of 10 mg/ml poly-l-lysine and 6.5 μl of 80 mm 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide in a sterile polystyrene tube in a final volume of 4 ml of HEPES-buffered saline and incubated for 4 h on ice with mixing every 30 min. The coupled virus was brought to a final concentration of 1.35 g/ml CsCl. The adenovirus was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 5 h at 10 °C, and the adenovirus band was collected and dialyzed against HEPES-buffered saline for 16 h at 4 °C. Viral DNA was quantitated by measuring the optical density at 260 nm. Briefly, 25 μl of purified virus was mixed with 465 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and 10 μl of 5% SDS. The mixture was vortexed for 2 min and then centrifuged for 2 min at room temperature in a microcentrifuge. The optical density of the resulting supernatant was measured at 260 nm (1 optical density unit equals approximately 1 × 1012 virus particles/ml). Cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin). Twenty-four hours before transfection, cells were plated in 6-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells per well in the same medium. Before transfection, cells were rinsed with Hank's balanced salt solution, and 2 ml of DMEM was added to each well. DNA and polylysine-coupled viruses were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and additional polylysine (polylysine/DNA ratio is 1:1.3) was added. The DNA-virus-polylysine complex was incubated at room temperature for another 30 min. During the incubations, the DNA-virus complex was kept in the dark. After the incubations, the complex was added dropwise to the cells. Cell were incubated with DNA-virus complex for 2 h. Then 2 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10% stripped FBS was added to each well. On the next day, progesterone and compounds such as 8-bromo-cAMP at the indicated concentrations were added to the cells, and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h before being harvested and assayed for CAT activity. For CAT assays, cells were harvested by scraping and subsequently lysed by three cycles of freeze-thawing. The protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent according to the manufacturer's protocols. Equal amounts of protein (usually 5–10 μg) were then used for a liquid CAT assay that has been described (46Brian S. Sheen J. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar) and used in our previous studies (15Bai W. Tullos S. Weigel N.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1465-1473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Bai W. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12801-12806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 32Zhang Y. Bai W. Allgood V.E. Weigel N.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The samples were heated at 60 °C for 8 min before the addition of the substrates, and the reactions were terminated and extracted before the substrates become a limiting factor to ensure the accurate determination of the CAT activity. Duplicate samples were assayed for each data point. CV-1 monkey kidney cells were plated on 150-mm dishes (2 × 106 cells/dish) and cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in DMEM with 10% FBS that had been stripped of steroid hormones by treatment with dextran-coated charcoal. After 24 h in culture, cells were subjected to adenovirus infection (virus to cell ratio, 750:1) with 0.2 μg of cPRA expression vector/plate and cultured for an additional 24 h. To remove endogenous phosphate pools from the cells, the culture medium was removed, and phosphate-free DMEM was added to the cells for 1 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, this medium was removed, and cells were cultured in phosphate-free DMEM with 1% dialyzed, stripped FBS. 6 mCi of [32P]H3PO4(2 mCi/ml) was added to each plate of CV-1 cells, and cells were cultured for 1 h at 37 °C. Treatment was as follows. For 10-h treatments, either 8-bromo-cAMP (final concentration 2 mm) or progesterone (final concentration 10−8m) was added to cell cultures 1 h after [32P]H3PO4 addition, and cells were cultured for 10 h prior to harvest. For 30-min treatments, 8-bromo-cAMP (final concentration 2 mm) was added to cell cultures 10.5 h after [32P]H3PO4 addition, and cells were cultured for 30 min prior to harvest. cPR protein was purified and subjected to trypsin digestion and HPLC analysis as described previously (8Denner L.A. Schrader W.T. O'Malley B.W. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16548-16555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Briefly, cells were scraped from the plates in phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in homogenization buffer (50 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 10 mm sodium molybdate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mmEGTA, 0.4 m sodium chloride, 5 mmα-monothioglycerol) (8Denner L.A. Schrader W.T. O'Malley B.W. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16548-16555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with 1% Triton X-100 and vortexed for 30 s. Following centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, 3 volumes of homogenization buffer without Triton X-100 was added to the supernatant to reduce the detergent concentration. The receptor was then purified by passing the entire supernatant over a 1-ml PR22-Protein-A-Sepharose immunoaffinity column as described previously (8Denner L.A. Schrader W.T. O'Malley B.W. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16548-16555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified receptor was electrophoresed on a 6.5% SDS-PAGE gel, and the wet gel was exposed to X-AR film (Eastman Kodak) for 2–4 h at 4 °C. The phosphorylated receptor band was cut out of the gel, and the gel slice was digested with trypsin to prepare the tryptic cPRA peptides (8Denner L.A. Schrader W.T. O'Malley B.W. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16548-16555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HPLC analysis of tryptic peptides was performed as described previously (8Denner L.A. Schrader W.T. O'Malley B.W. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16548-16555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, phosphopeptides were loaded onto a C-18 reverse phase HPLC column in HPLC-grade H20 containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Phosphopeptides were separated by elution from the C-18 column using a 0–45% gradient of acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over a period of 90 min. Purified cPRA was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The receptor was detected using the monoclonal antibody, PR22, followed by chemiluminescent detection using enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Corp.) as described (47Weigel N.L. Carter T.H. Schrader W.T. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 8-14PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the molecular mechanism of the ligand-independent activation of cPR by 8-bromo-cAMP, we individually mutated each of the four known phosphorylation sites to alanine, and the transcriptional activity of each of the four single-site cPRA mutants was analyzed and compared with the wild type receptor after treatment with either 2 mm8-bromo-cAMP or 10 nm progesterone. As shown in Fig.1, the transcriptional activity of the Ala211 and Ala260 mutants in response to either progesterone or 8-bromo-cAMP is significantly lower than that of the wild type. As reported previously (15Bai W. Tullos S. Weigel N.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1465-1473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the activity of Ala530 is not statistically different from that of the wild type at this hormone concentration. The mutation of Ser367to alanine appears not to affect the transcriptional activity of the receptor. From Fig. 1, it is obvious that the transcriptional activity of Ala211 and Ala260 in response to 8-bromo-cAMP is affected by the mutations to a magnitude similar to the activity in response to progesterone, suggesting that the receptor phosphorylation at these two sites can regulate the ligand-independent activation. The fact that all four mutants can still be activated by 8-bromo-cAMP suggests that phosphorylation at any of the individual sites is not absolutely required for the ligand-independent activation. However, this experiment did not rule out the possibility that phosphorylation of cPR at the remaining sites compensates for the loss at one position in mediating the receptor activation. To investigate the possibility that phosphorylations at the four known sites compensate for one another during the ligand-independent activation of the receptor, all four sites were mutated simultaneously to alanines, and the activity of this quadruple mutant (AAAA) was compared with that of the wild type after stimulation with either 8-bromo-cAMP or 10 nm progesterone.

https://openalex.org/W2154703079,"The vacuolar type proton pump of clathrin-coated vesicles has a multisubunit ATP hydrolytic center that is peripheral to the membrane. Polypeptides present in this domain include the well characterized subunits A, B, C, D, E, and F; SFD, a dimer composed of 50- and 57-kDa polypeptides; and polypeptides termed G and H. Of these, subunits A, B, C, and E have been shown to be necessary but not sufficient for significant ATPase activity; in addition, either polypeptide G or H is also required for ATP hydrolysis (Xie, X.-S. (1996) J. Biol. Chem.271, 30980–30985).In this study, the polypeptides G and H were purified and directly sequenced. Subsequent molecular analysis has revealed that these proteins are isoforms, which we designate G1 and G2. The cDNAs encoding the rat and bovine brain and chicken osteoclast forms of G1 have been cloned. The open reading frames of the rat and bovine clones encode hydrophilic proteins of 118 amino acids that differ at only five residues; bovine G1 has 36% identity with VMA10, a component of the proton channel of yeast. Northern blot analysis revealed a 1.0-kilobase pair transcript encoding G1 in bovine brain, kidney, heart, and spleen. The cDNA encoding bovine polypeptide H was cloned and sequenced, revealing this protein to be 64% identical to G1, constituting isoform G2. In Northern blot analysis, a single 1.7-kilobase pair transcript hybridized with a probe to G2 in brain, but not in heart, kidney, or spleen. An antibody against a bovine G1-specific domain reacts with V pump from bovine brain, kidney, and chromaffin granule, whereas an anti-G2 antibody reacts only with proton pump from brain. The bovine forms of G1 and G2 were subsequently expressed in Escherichia coli and Sf9 cells, respectively, and purified to homogeneity. Reconstitution of ATP hydrolysis was achieved by combination of recombinant subunits A, B, C, and E with either recombinant G1 or G2, demonstrating the role of these isoforms in pump function.

Vacuolar, or V-type, proton pumps are remarkable for their wide distribution within eukaryotic cells, where they are found in most organelles, as well as for their intense phylogenetic conservation. Physiologically, these pumps are responsible for urinary acidification and bone resorption and participate in the respiratory burst phenomenon of macrophages. At a constitutive level, V-type proton pumps are essential for glycosylation in Golgi membranes, degradation of cellular debris in lysosomes, and processing of endocytosed receptor-ligand complexes in endosomes. In regulated secretory pathways, these proton-translocating ATPases energize neurotransmitter and catecholamine storage and facilitate processing of insulin as well as packaging of histamine and heparin (1Stone D.K.

Investigation of the structure and function of the V-pump of clathrin-coated vesicles has revealed that the peripheral sector is composed of polypeptides of 70, 58, 40, 33, and 14 kDa, termed subunits A, B, C, E, and F, respectively (7Peng S.-B.

Recent work has also identified other components of this sector. These include a dimer composed of 57- and 50-kDa polypeptides termed SFD (sub-fifty-eight kDadimer) (12Xie X.-S. Crider B.P. Ma Y.-M. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25809-25815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), subunit D (13Nelson H. Mandiyan S. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and two polypeptides that we have designated G and H (14Xie X.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30980-30985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Definition of these components of the catalytic sector has been approached in several ways. It has been shown that the peripheral components of V-type pumps can be released from the proton channel by incubation with chaotropic agents, and/or nucleotides at 4 °C (15Moriyama Y. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3577-3582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Forgac M. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 155-169PubMed Google Scholar). These released polypeptides have been termed V1, in analogy to the peripheral sector of the mitochondrial ATPase, which was termed F1, (for Factor 1) (1Stone D.K. Xie X.S. Kidney Int. 1988; 33: 403-413Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (45) Google Scholar). There has been no report of ATPase activity associated with these released subunits, and thus V1 constitutes a group of peripheral subunits that are hypothesized to catalyze ATP hydrolysis. This supposition is well supported by nucleotide labeling experiments and identification of signature sites for ATP binding/hydrolysis in two of these peripheral components (subunits A and B) (17Manolson M.F.

By another approach, we have sought to define by a functional analysis the elements responsible for ATP hydrolysis in V-type pumps. This has required dissociating the enzyme, isolating the separated subunits and/or subcomplexes, and determining by add-back experiments the requirement for ATP hydrolysis. Dissociation of the enzyme by several biochemical procedures (e.g. urea treatment) results in a change in the characteristics of the ATPase activity of the pump; namely, the enzyme loses its capability of hydrolyzing MgATP and switches to a form capable of only CaATP hydrolysis (22Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9859-9867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have termed this peripheral catalytic sector VC, to distinguish these functional (and possibly structural) features from those of V1. Recently, evidence has emerged that the catalytic sector of V pumps exists as a multisubunit subcomplex, has Ca2+-activated ATPase activity, and reversibly associates with the transmembranous sector to increase pump number under physiological stimuli (23Lepier A. Graf R. Azuma M. Merzendorfer H. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8502-8508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Our goal of defining the components of the pump responsible for ATP hydrolysis has centered upon identification of the minimal polypeptide requirements for CaATPase activity. This has resulted in the findings that four subunits (A, B, C, and E) are necessary, but not sufficient, for significant ATPase activity (7Peng S.-B. Stone D.K. Xie X.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23519-23523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Peng S.-B. Zhang Y. Tsai S.J. Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. J. Biol.

Recently, it was found that an additional subunit was also necessary for ATPase activity and that either polypeptide G or H could fulfill this need. These studies were performed with recombinant subunits A, B, C, and E and biochemically prepared G and H polypeptides, and they were further remarkable for the fact that both CaATPase and MgATPase activity were reconstituted by these components (14Xie X.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30980-30985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further explore the roles of these polypeptides in proton pump function, the molecular identities of polypeptides G and H have been investigated. Direct peptide sequencing, and cloning of their cDNAs reveal these components be highly homologous to each other and also to subunit G of the V pumps of yeast (24Supekova L. Supek F. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13726-13732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), Manduca sexta (23Lepier A. Graf R. Azuma M. Merzendorfer H. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 199: 1147-1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These isoforms, which we term G1 and G2, differ in their tissue distributions. Northern blot analysis reveals that G2 is present in brain but not in kidney, liver, or spleen, whereas G1 is present in all tissues examined. G1 and G2 have been expressed in Escherichia coli and Sf9 cells, respectively, and purified to homogeneity. Reconstitution of MgATPase and CaATPase activity was achieved with recombinant subunits G1, G2, A, B, C, and E. In these experiments, it was determined that either G1 or G2, but not both, are required for reconstitution of ATP hydrolysis. Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and a nick translation kit for DNA probe labeling were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim; the GeneAmp PCR reagent kit with Thermus aquaticus Taq DNA polymerase and DNA sequencing materials and reagents were from Perkin-Elmer; a bovine brain cDNA library and a rat brain cDNA library in λZAPII, their host E. colicells BB4 and XL1-Blue, and helper phage R408 were from Stratagene;E. coli expression vector pET16b and its host cell BL21(DE3) were from Novagen; baculovirus expression vector pVL1392 and baculovirus (AcNPA) DNA were from PharMingen; [α-32P]dCTP, [α-32P]ATP, and an ECL kit for Western blot analysis were from Amersham Corp.; nitrocellulose membranes for plaque lift were from Millipore Corp.; and chemicals for SDS-PAGE were from Bio-Rad. Bovine adrenal chromaffin granule membranes were the generous gift of Dr. Joseph Albanesi (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Polypeptides G and H were separated by SDS-PAGE (15% acrylamide), and proteins were electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon Psc filters, from which both polypeptide bands were excised and digested with trypsin (26Fernandez J. Demlott M. Aatterton D. Mische S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Released peptides were separated by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography using a 2.1 × 150-mm RP300 column (Perkin-Elmer) and were subjected to automated Edman degradation with a model 477A amino acid sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) using the manufacturer's standard program and chemicals. λZAPII phage DNA from an amplified rat brain cDNA library was purified by standard methods (26Fernandez J. Demlott M. Aatterton D. Mische S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and used as a template for PCR, which was performed with 1 μg of purified λZAPII DNA and 20 pmol of two synthetic oligonucleotide primers: 5′-GAAAGAACCGGAGGCTGAAGC-3′ and 5′-CGGAAGTATGTCTGGAGGATGG-3′. The sequences of these primers were based on direct peptide sequences and a homologous human EST sequence C-IHF03 (EMBL accession number Z43645). A 183-bp 1The abbreviations used are: bp, base pair; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; NTA, nitrolotriacetic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SFD,sub-fifty-eight-kDa dimer, 50–57-kDa polypeptide heterodimer required for function of the vacuolar proton pump of clathrin-coated vesicles; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; VB, the bafilomycin-sensitive proton channel of V-type proton pumps; VC, the peripheral, catalytic sector of V-type proton pumps; EST, expressed sequence tag. PCR product was cloned into pCR™II vector using a commercial TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). After positive selection by restriction enzyme digestion, the insert was excised with EcoRI and purified by preparative agarose gel electrophoresis. The 183-bp PCR fragment was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by nick translation and used to screen a rat brain cDNA library in λZAPII that had been transfected into E. coli strain BB4. Plaques were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by a double-lift procedure (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The membranes were then prehybridized for at least 4 h at 60 °C in a solution containing 5 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.1 mg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA, and 0.1% SDS. Hybridization was performed at 42 °C overnight with the same solution plus labeled probe, which was added at a concentration of 5–10 × 105 cpm/ml of hybridization solution. Duplicate positive clones were rescreened through one or more cycles until purified plaques were obtained. Subunit G1 cDNA was cloned from a bovine brain cDNA library in λZAPII, using the same conditions for screening the rat brain library, except for a different probe, which was a 685-bp insert of a clone (R3–1) encoding rat brain subunit G1. cDNA encoding chicken subunit G1 was cloned from a λZAP Express cDNA library prepared from chicken osteoclasts 2P. Andersen and L. Lundberg, unpublished data. using procedures similar to those described for cloning the cDNAs encoding the rat and bovine forms of subunit G1. Specifically, 1 μg of λZAP Express phage DNA was used as template, and two synthetic oligonucleotides (5′-ATGGCIAG(T/C)CA(A/G)TCIGAGGGIAT-3′ and 5′-CGGTAITT(T/C)TC(G/A)TGGATTTCIGG-3′) were used as primers for PCR amplification. The resulting 342-bp PCR product was sequenced and found to be homologous to the cDNA encoding the rat and bovine forms of subunit G1. Subsequently, probe labeling and screening were carried out as described for cloning of the rat brain cDNA, exceptE. coli strain XL1 Blue MRF′ was infected with the λZAP Express lysate. Purified clones were in vivo excised into pBK-CMV using helper phage ExAssist and E. coli strain XLOLR. Four positive cDNA clones were identified as chicken subunit G1. Only one clone (COG03) contained the putative start codon and a 28-bp upstream sequence. Two oligonucleotide primers, 5′-AAGGAGGAGGCICA(A/G)ATGGA(A/G)GT-3′ and 5′-CTGCATICC(C/T)TGIAC(C/T)TGIC-3′, were synthesized in accord with two of the peptide sequences. Deoxyinosine (I) was used in the third position of some codons with a degeneracy of two or more. λZAP phage DNA from amplified bovine brain cDNA library was purified by standard methods (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and used as a template for polymerase chain reaction. A 283-bp PCR product was cloned into pCR™II vector. The insert was excised with BamHI andEcoRV, purified by preparative agarose gel electrophoresis, and used to screen a bovine brain cDNA library by a double-lift procedure, as described above. Inserts from all positive clones were excised and cloned into pBluescript or pBK-CMV, with helper phage R408. Plasmid DNA was prepared by alkaline lysis, and DNA sequencing reactions were carried out with the ABI PRISM™dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase, and subjected to sequencing analysis using a model 377 ABI PRISM DNA sequencer. The positive clones were fully sequenced in both orientations using T7, T3 promotor sequences, and sequence-specific oligonucleotides as primers. DNA and protein data base searches were performed using a PC/GENE-based program. Poly(A)+ RNA (2 μg) from designated bovine tissues was denatured and fractionated by 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to a Zeta-Probe blotting membrane (Bio-Rad). After baking at 80 °C in a vacuum oven for 1 h, the membrane was prehybridized for 4 h at 50 °C in a solution consisting of 50% formaldehyde, 1.5 × saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 1% SDS, 0.5% nonfat dry milk, 0.5 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. The probes for subunits G1 and G2, and β-actin were labeled with [α32P]dCTP by nick translation and added to the hybridization solution at a concentration of 1 × 106 cpm/ml of solution. Hybridization was then carried out at 50 °C overnight. The membrane was sequentially washed for 15 min at room temperature with 2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS, 0.5 × SSC and 0.1% SDS, and subsequently 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS. A final wash was carried out at 60 °C with 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS for 30 min, and autoradiography was performed with an intensifier screen at −80 °C for 5 days. The coding region for bovine subunit G1 was amplified by PCR using cloned cDNA B33–1 as template and two synthetic oligonucleotides (5′-AGCCATACATATGGCCAGTCAGTCGCAGGG-3′ and 5′-GCAATAGGAGATCTAGAGCTGCCTCTATCCATTTATGCGG-3′) as primers, which were designed to contain NdeI and BglII restriction sites and initiator and stop codons at the 5′-ends, respectively, to enable cloning into the bacterial expression vector pET16b. The amplification reaction was performed in a Gene Machine thermal cycler using the following conditions: 1 min at 94 °C and 5 min at 68 °C, for a total of 30 cycles. The PCR product was size-fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis, from which a single 380-bp fragment was purified; the fragment was identical to the cDNA sequence as determined by direct DNA sequencing. Expression vector pET16bG1 was constructed by replacing the NdeI andBamHI fragment of pET16b with the PCR-amplified fragment, which had been digested with NdeI and BglII. For expression of subunit G, E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) was transformed with expression vector pET16bG1 and grown and induced with IPTG at 37 °C as described (28Studier F.W. Rosenberg H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar). pET16bG1 encodes a fusion protein containing a histidine tag at the amino terminus of the subunit G1, potentially allowing the protein to be readily purified with Ni-NTA resin. However, the expressed subunit G1 was largely aggregated into insoluble form (inclusion bodies) inE. coli, and thus the following purification protocol was developed. 500 ml of IPTG-induced BL21 (DE3) cells harboring pET16bG1 were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 6 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaC1) containing 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme. The mixture was kept on ice and stirred occasionally for 20 min. Subsequently, 300 μl of 20% sodium cholate was added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C and continuously stirred with a glass rod for 5–10 min. When the lysate became viscous, 40 μl of DNase I (1 mg/ml) was added. The lysate was kept at room temperature until it was no longer viscous (30–40 min), and then it was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was suspended in 10 ml of denaturing buffer consisting of 6 m guanidium HCl, 0.1 mNaH2PO4, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was used for Ni-NTA resin chromatography. The supernatant from step 1 was mixed with 1 ml of equilibrated Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen), and the mixture was shaken for 1 h at room temperature. After centrifugation, the Ni-NTA resin was loaded into a small column, which was then washed with 120 ml of wash buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaC1, 15 mm imidazole, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing a continuous urea gradient from 6 to 3m with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The protein was eluted with 10 ml of wash buffer containing 3 m urea and 200 mm imidazole, and 1-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For further purification and refolding of recombinant subunit G1, selected fractions from Ni-NTA chromatography were loaded onto a 10–20% glycerol gradient, which was prepared in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm EDTA, 3 mm dithiothreitol, and 1m urea. After centrifugation at 180,000 ×g for 22 h at 4 °C, fractions were harvested from the upper fractions of the gradient, subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis, and used for reconstitution experiments. The coding region for subunit G2 of H+-ATPase was amplified by PCR using cloned cDNA as template and two oligonucleotides (5′-AACAACACATATGGCCAGTCAATCCCAGGGT-3′ and 5′-GGAGTCGGATCCTAGGTTAGGTCCTAGGCAG-3′) and cloned into the vector pET16b. Bacterial expression vector pET16bG2 was constructed by replacing the NdeI-BamHI fragment of plasmid pET16b with the PCR product after digestion with the same restriction enzymes. pET16bG2 was digested with XbaI andBamHI. The resultant 0.5-kilobase pair fragment, which contained the entire coding region for subunit G2, was cloned into theXbaI and BamHI sites of vector pVLL1392 to generate the baculovirus expression vector pVLL1392-G2. Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells were grown in monolayer or in suspension culture at 27 °C in either Grace's or IPL-41 medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum plus 0.1% pluronic polyol F68. Cells were split 1:5 for propagation every 3–4 days. Recombinant baculovirus was generated by co-transfection of Sf9 cells by the Lipofectin method with purified vector pVL1392-G2 DNA and linearized AcNPA viral DNA (9Peng S.-B. Zhang Y. Crider B.P. White A.E. Fried V.A. Stone D.K. Xie X.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27778-27782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Positive viral clones were isolated by plaque assay and identified by their ability to direct the expression of subunit G2 protein, as determined by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. For expression and production of recombinant protein, Sf9 cells (2 × 106 cells/ml medium) were infected with pure recombinant baculovirus and grown in suspension at 27 °C for 60–72 h. 500 ml of infected Sf9 cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 15 min. The cells were then resuspended in 50 ml of lysis buffer consisting of 50 mmNa2HPO4, 300 mm NaCl, 0.25% Tween 20, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete™, Boehringer Mannheim), and sonicated three times for 1 min on ice. The lysate was then centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C with a Beckman Ti 70 rotor. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was suspended in 10 ml of denaturing buffer, consisting of 6 m guanidium HCl, 0.1m NaH2PO4, and 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0. After centrifugation at 15,000 × gfor 15 min, recombinant subunit G2 was purified by Ni-NTA resin chromatography and refolded, using procedures similar to those described for recombinant subunit G. All of these components used for ATPase reconstitution are described herein and elsewhere (8Peng S.-B. Zhang Y. Tsai S.J. Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. J. Biol.

ATPase activities were measured by the liberation of 32Pi from [γ32P]ATP. The assay solution consisted of 30 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris/MES (pH 7.0), 2.5 mm CaCl2 or MgCl2, and 2 mm [γ32P]ATP (200–400 cpm/nmol). ATPase samples were preincubated with 2.5 μg of phosphatidylserine for 2–5 min at room temperature, and reactions were initiated by the addition of 100 μl of assay solution. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 1 ml of 1.25n perchloric acid, and the liberated32Pi was extracted and counted as described (29Stone D.K. Xie X-S. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2701-2703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two peptides, CEKETQEKMTILQTYFRQNRDE (specific to subunit G1) and CEQATRRQVQGMQSSQQRNRER (specific to subunit G2), were synthesized based on deduced protein sequence, coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and used for immunization of New Zealand White rabbits as described previously (30Sudhof T.C.

For Western blot analysis, protein samples were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose paper. Immunodetection was performed using immune serum at a 1:5,000 dilution and an Amersham ECL Western blotting system. Bovine brain clathrin-coated vesicle H+-ATPase, its peripheral catalytic sector (VC), and integral membrane proton channel (VB) were purified as described (22Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. J. Biol.

Briefly, VC was prepared by treating purified pump with urea, followed by glycerol gradient centrifugation, and VB was harvested from upper fractions of glycerol gradients used for purification of the intact proton pump. H+-ATPases from bovine kidney and chromaffin granule membranes were isolated as described for the pump of bovine brain clathrin-coated vesicles (22Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. J. Biol.

Our physicochemical studies of PorB class 2 protein furnish significant insight regarding the structural and functional properties of this meningococcal outer membrane protein within the porin superfamily. Porins are integral outer membrane proteins that function as molecular sieves in Gram-negative bacteria, mediating the aqueous diffusion of solutes through the water-filled channels derived from their unique folding/assembly (1Nikaido H. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 2Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3905-3908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although meningococcal outer membranes may contain as many as five major proteins, much of the observed serotype specificity can be attributed to PorB class 2 and class 3 proteins, both of which are mutually exclusive within different meningococcal strains and alleles from the porB gene (3Frasch C.E. Zollinger W.D. Poolman J.T. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1985; 7: 504-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Studies on meningococcal outer membranes (3Frasch C.E. Zollinger W.D. Poolman J.T. Rev.

Bacteriol. 1978; 136: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) originally suggested that class 2 protein might function as a bacterial porin on the basis of noted similarities with Escherichia coli protein I (5Palva E.T. Randall L.L. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 133: 279-286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The strongest argument to date regarding porin function arises from comparative studies with other neisserial strains (i.e.gonococcal) for which equivalents of class 2 and class 3 proteins have been proposed (6Frasch C.E. Rubinstein Y. Nguyen N. Ewell J. Proceedings of the 7th International Pathogenic Neisseria Conference, Berlin, Germany. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1990: 213-217Google Scholar). Evidence regarding the porin function of protein I from Neisseria gonorrhoeae has been furnished by Douglaset al. (7Douglas J.T. Lee M.D. Nikaido H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1981; 12: 305-309Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and extended through further biophysical characterization (8Young J.D.-E. Blake M. Mauro A. Cohn Z.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Meningococcal porin function has also been assessed in vivo by characterizing the relative sensitivity of native and mutant strains to hydrophilic antibiotics (10Poolman J.T. Marie S. Zanen H.C.

A remarkable finding that appears exclusive to pathogenic neisserial strains (including the class 2-expressing serotypes) is the spontaneous transfer of porin molecules from the outer membrane of whole cells into artificial lipid bilayers (12Lynch E.C.

Immun. 1989; 57: 2318-2323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is a relatively low sequence homology observed within the porin superfamily of proteins, yet intra- and interspecies correlation of structure and function reveals significant relatedness (16Jeanteur D. Lakey J.H. Pattus F. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2153-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar).

Science. 1995; 267: 512-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) obtained from x-ray crystallographic studies confirm the remarkable structural similarity within this family of proteins. Since high resolution structures are not available for the majority of porins isolated to date, indirect methods of analysis have been employed to glean basic structural information. These include epitope mapping, limited proteolysis of whole cells, and gene variability (21van der Ley P. Heckels J.E. Mumtaz V. Hoogerhout P. Poolman J.T. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 2963-2971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Bash M.C. Leasiak K.B. Banks S.D. Frasch C.E. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1484-1490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in conjunction with sequence alignment and secondary structure predictions (16Jeanteur D. Lakey J.H. Pattus F. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2153-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Although a number of studies have attempted to characterize the structural stability of E. coli porins (23 and references contained therein), a comprehensive and systematic investigation of porins from different species is an essential prerequisite for identifying those forces and mechanisms governing the overall conformational stability of these outer membrane proteins. Porin toxicity has generally impeded efforts to develop effective expression systems in heterologous cells (24Carbonetti N.H. Simnad V.I. Seiferd H.S. So M. Sparling P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6841-6845Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, recent studies have demonstrated that neisserial porins can be overexpressed at sufficiently high levels in E. coli as inclusion bodies (IBs) 1The abbreviations used are: IBs, inclusion bodies; IPTG, isopropyl-thiogalactopyranoside; OMP, outer membrane protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; rclass 2, recombinant class 2 protein; Z 3-14, Zwittergen 3–14. without impairing host cell viability (25Qi H.L. Tai J.Y. Blake M.S. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 2432-2439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This unique advantage has enabled us to overexpress class 2 protein in E. coli and thereby conduct a comprehensive series of physicochemical studies designed to elucidate specific structural and functional properties of this bacterial porin. Consequently, the primary objectives of the present study are 2-fold, namely to 1) furnish the requisite physicochemical evidence that the recombinant porin retains specific conformational properties integral to full biological activity following detergent-assisted renaturation, and 2) assess the inherent functional and structural features of class 2 protein in the absence of homologous cell wall components and other neisserial outer membrane proteins. Such studies are especially relevant in the case of meningococcal porins from which limited structural and functional information have been derived primarily on the basis of indirect comparisons with porins from other bacterial strains. Genomic DNA was isolated from Group B N. meningitidisnonencapsulated variant of strain M986 (serotype 2a) employing standard procedures and used as a polymerase chain reaction template for amplification of the class 2 protein gene as described elsewhere (25Qi H.L. Tai J.Y. Blake M.S. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 2432-2439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amplified product was cloned into NdeI andXhoI sites of the pET17b plasmid (Novagen, Inc.) that was used to transform competent E. coli DH5α. Plasmid DNA from selected DH5α clones was isolated and employed to transform E. coli BL21 (DE3)-ΔompA. The transformants were selected by carbenicillin and expression induced by addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 0.4 mm. The levels of class 2 protein expressed at various times after induction were monitored by SDS-PAGE of whole cell lysates followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Meningococcal class 2 protein expressed in E. coli was purified in accordance with the procedure of Qi et al. (25Qi H.L. Tai J.Y. Blake M.S. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 2432-2439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) incorporating several minor modifications. The overexpressed class 2 protein was isolated by resuspending and lysing the bacterial cells with a Stansted air-driven cell disrupter (Stansted Fluid Power Ltd.) in TEN buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mmNaCl, pH 8.0) followed by centrifugation and isolation of the pellet containing class 2 protein aggregated in the form of inclusion bodies (IBs). After washing the pellet with 0.5% deoxycholate in TEN buffer, followed by two rinses with TEN buffer, the protein was solubilized by resuspending and sonicating the IBs in freshly prepared 8 murea solution for 5 min using a water bath sonicator. Refolding of class 2 protein into its native conformation was achieved by employing a detergent-assisted refolding procedure (25Qi H.L. Tai J.Y. Blake M.S. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 2432-2439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Pullen J.K. Liang S. Blake M.S. Mates S. Tai J.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 152: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Equal volumes of urea-dissolved IBs and 10% Z 3-14 (Calbiochem) were combined and the final porin extract applied to a Sephacryl S-300 (5 × 100 cm) column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated in a buffer comprised of 100 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mmEDTA, 20 mm CaCl2, and 0.05% Z 3-14, pH 8.0. Fractions containing class 2 protein were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and applied to a Hiload Q-Sepharose HP ion exchange (2.6 × 20 cm) column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in 25 mmTris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm EDTA, and 0.05% Z 3-14 pH 8.0. A gradient of 0.2–1.0 m NaCl was applied and class 2 protein eluted as a single peak. Protein concentration was estimated based on a molar extinction coefficient of 45,800 calculated for class 2 protein according to the procedure of Mach et al. (27Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Native meningococcal PorB (strain M986) class 2 protein was purified as described elsewhere (28Wetzler L.M. Blake M.S. Gotschlich E.C. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 1883-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). OmpF employed as a reference in the present study was isolated from uninduced E. coliBL21 cell envelopes by the chaotrope/detergent extraction technique used to refold/purify class 2 protein from IBs. N-terminal sequence analysis confirmed a purity of 95% for E. coli OmpF. The primary diagnostic procedures employed to ascertain that refolded porins attain their native conformation selectively monitor SDS and trypsin resistance behavior. Electrophoresis was performed in Tris-HCl/glycine/SDS buffer using a Novex system and 8–16% gradient gels. Samples were incubated with loading buffer containing 0.5% SDS and either heated at 95 °C for 5 min or maintained at room temperature for visualization of monomeric and trimeric species, respectively. Trypsin resistance was conducted using tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma) at a ratio of 1:10 (enzyme:protein). Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of 20 mm CaCl2 and the reaction terminated by addition of leupeptin. The effects of SDS on both the oligomeric state and conformation of class 2 protein as a function of temperature were assessed by evaluating the electrophoretic mobility in SDS-PAGE and correlating these results with detergent-induced perturbations in the circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence spectra to monitor changes in secondary and tertiary structure, respectively. The pore-forming activity of native and recombinant class 2 protein was assessed by the liposome swelling technique (29Nikaido H. Nikaido K. Harayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 770-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteoliposome suspensions of class 2 protein (10 μl) were diluted into 690 μl of isosmotic solutions containing different molecular weight solutes. Oligosaccharides (Sigma) employed in this study included l-arabinose (M r 150), galactose (M r180), rhamnose (M r 182),N-acetylglucosamine (M r 221), sucrose (M r 342), raffinose (M r504), and stachyose (M r 666). The isosmotic concentration was determined by diluting the proteoliposomes into stachyose solutions of different concentrations according to Nikaidoet al. (29Nikaido H. Nikaido K. Harayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 770-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The permeability of native and recombinant class 2 protein was calculated from initial rates of change in the optical density of proteoliposomes monitored at 450 nm normalized to the rate of liposome swelling in isosmotic solutions ofl-arabinose. Permeability changes were recorded at 1.0-s intervals over a total sampling period of 180 s using a Hewlett-Packard model 8453 UV/Vis spectrophotometer operated in the kinetic measurement mode. The secondary and tertiary structures of native and recombinant class 2 protein were evaluated by CD spectroscopy in the far UV (180–250 nm) and near UV (250–350 nm) regions, respectively. Concentrated stock solutions of protein were dialyzed against buffer systems comprised of either 25 mmTris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm EDTA, and 0.05% Z 3-14, pH 8.0, or 50 mm NaPO4 and 0.05% Z 3-14, pH 7.5. Spectra of samples containing 1.0 mg/ml protein were recorded at 0.1-nm wavelength intervals on a Jasco model 710 CD spectropolarimeter employing a scan speed of 5 nm/min and average response time of 1 s. A minimum of four consecutive scans was accumulated, and the average spectra were stored. The temperature of the samples was maintained at either 25 or 95 °C through the use of water-jacketed 0.01- and 1.0-cm pathlength cells in the far and near UV, respectively. Fluorescence measurements were performed on an SLM AMINCO-Bowman 8100 Series 2 spectrofluorometer. Fluorescence spectra of samples containing 100 μg/ml protein in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, 1.0 mmEDTA, and 0.05% Z 3-14, pH 8.0, were recorded over the range of 300 to 500 nm employing an excitation wavelength of 290 nm and slit widths of 2 nm. Temperature stability was maintained through use of a water-jacketed 1.0-cm quartz cuvette thermostatted at either 25 or 95 °C. Absorption spectra of samples containing 400 μg/ml protein in 25 mmTris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm EDTA, and 0.05% Z 3-14, pH 8.0, were recorded over the range of 200–500 nm on a Hewlett-Packard model 8453 UV/Vis rapid scan spectrophotometer equipped with a diode array detector and a Peltier junction temperature-controlled sample compartment. Exposure of tyrosyl residues was determined by plotting second derivative peak-trough absorbance differences as a function of chemical denaturant concentration in accordance with the procedure of Ragone et al. (30Ragone R. Colonna G. Balestrieri C. Servillo L. Irace G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1871-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The ratio of a (∂2 A 288 − ∂2 A 285) to b(∂2 A 294 − ∂2 A 291) facilitates evaluation of tyrosyl exposure by eliminating the contribution of tryptophan residues that normally interferes in the analysis. N-Acetyltyrosine and N-acetyltryptophan (Sigma) were employed as model compounds at a molar ratio of 18:4 to approximate the total content of tyrosine and tryptophan residues in class 2 protein. The degree of tyrosyl exposure has been calculated using the relation (Equation 1): α=(rn−ra)/(ru−ra)Equation 1 where rn and ru represent numerical values of the ratio a:b determined for the native (0.05% Z 3-14) and unfolded (6.0 m Gdn·HCl) states, respectively, and ra is the value of a:b obtained for the solution of model compounds in ethylene glycol. The latter reflects 0% exposure of aromatic residues since this solvent reportedly mimics the hydrophobic protein matrix (30Ragone R. Colonna G. Balestrieri C. Servillo L. Irace G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1871-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The conformational stability of class 2 protein was also investigated by monitoring temperature-dependent CD spectral changes in the far and near UV regions. These studies were performed by recording changes in the mean molar residue ellipticity at 217 and 290 nm during thermal denaturation over the temperature range of 25–95 °C. The reversibility of thermal unfolding/refolding was assessed by cooling the samples and rescanning CD spectra for both the native and recombinant proteins at 25 °C. Fig.1, panel A, presents a schematic illustration of the plasmid construct that exhibits a size corresponding to 4.4 kilobase pairs and comprises the pET17b plasmid containing the gene encoding the class 2 protein under control of the T7 promoter (25Qi H.L. Tai J.Y. Blake M.S. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 2432-2439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Pullen J.K. Liang S. Blake M.S. Mates S. Tai J.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 152: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The expression levels of class 2 protein inE. coli BL21(DE3) ΔompA upon induction with IPTG is presented as a function of time in Fig. 1 , panel B. Densitometric analysis indicates that maximal expression levels are achieved approximately 3 h following IPTG addition. Overexpressed rclass 2 aggregates as insoluble IBs that are readily separated from the majority of E. coli proteins by centrifugation of the whole cell lysates. The protein pellet is washed with TEN buffer containing 0.5% deoxycholate to ensure that contaminants such as endotoxin are removed from the sample (31Knuth M.W. Burgess R. Protein Purification: Micro to Macro. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1987: 279-305Google Scholar) since class 2 protein is not soluble in this detergent (3Frasch C.E. Zollinger W.D. Poolman J.T. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1985; 7: 504-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Subsequent purification using a combination of gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography yields protein of 98% purity as evidenced by silver-stained gels and spectrophotometric analysis. Pyrogenic tests and limulus amebocyte lysate assays indicate that the purified protein is endotoxin-free. Fig. 2furnishes a comparison of the purity levels for rclass 2 with respect to solubilized IBs. Optimal levels of properly refolded class 2 protein are achieved with initial protein concentrations of 4 mg/ml or less in 8 m urea solution. Under such conditions, the final purified protein yield is approximately 50 mg per liter of cell culture. To ascertain that the porin obtained by the renaturation procedure described above retains the structural features of native class 2 protein, several functional and physicochemical characteristics have been assessed. The results of these experiments including several novel aspects of class 2 protein as a bacterial porin are presented in the following sections. For comparison purposes and validation of the detergent-assisted refolding procedure reported in the present study, OmpF has been extracted from E. coliouter membranes under denaturing conditions (i.e. 8 m urea), refolded and purified in accordance with the experimental protocol employed for rclass 2 IBs. Fig. 3 depicts the typical SDS resistance behavior observed for oligomeric OmpF and reveals a striking similarity with rclass 2. These results are entirely consistent with the properties reported previously for the native E. coli porin (32Eisele J.-L. Rosenbusch J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Characterization of the pore-forming activity of porins by the liposome swelling assay requires accurate determination of the isosmotic concentration, particularly if pore sizes are to be determined (29Nikaido H. Nikaido K. Harayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 770-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The oligosaccharide stachyose (M r 666) has been employed for determination of the isosmotic concentration to dextran-containing proteoliposomes prepared with either class 2 protein or OmpF, since this sugar does not permeate at significant rates through these protein channels (29, present study). Although protein-free liposomes exhibit no swelling in the presence of isosmotic solutions of l-arabinose (M r 150), both class 2 protein and OmpF promote significant permeability increases when inserted into the liposomes. Fig. 4 (upper panel) is a representative experiment depicting the time course of the decrease in optical density at 450 nm of dextran-containing class 2 proteoliposomes in isosmotic solutions of various oligosaccharides. In the present study, the permeability rates of rclass 2 are similar regardless of the detergent in which the porin samples are resuspended prior to proteoliposome preparation. Identical rates are obtained for rclass 2 prepared in either 0.05% Z 3-14 or 1% octylglucoside (data not shown). In both cases, the final detergent concentrations in the proteoliposome preparation are sufficiently below the established interference level of 100 μg/μmol phospholipids for this assay (29Nikaido H. Nikaido K. Harayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 770-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 4(lower panel inset) compares the diffusion rates of various sugars as a function of solute molecular weight. Analysis of the relative permeability rates to l-arabinose in the logarithmic plot of the data (Fig. 4, lower panel) reveals similar behavior for native and rclass 2 protein channels. Using the value corresponding to 10% of the l-arabinose diffusion rate (i.e. M r (0.1 Ara)) as an index of the pore size (29Nikaido H. Nikaido K. Harayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 770-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the M r (0.1 Ara) for OmpF and class 2 protein are approximately 280 and 400, respectively (Fig. 4,lower panel). A nonlinear least squares fit of the data to Renkin's equation (33Renkin E.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1954; 38: 225-243PubMed Google Scholar) yields a pore radius of approximately 0.8 nm for this particular PorB class 2 protein. Trypsin digestion was performed to study the conformational properties of class 2 protein under different experimental conditions and compared with those of E. coliOmpF (Fig. 5). Panel A depicts the results of trypsin digestion for class 2 and OmpF under the indicated pre-digestion conditions, followed by incubation with SDS-loading buffer at 25 °C. Both class 2 and OmpF exhibit typical trimeric migration patterns (designated T), and preincubation with SDS (lanes 2 and 5) does not affect the protein trypsin resistance significantly. A small amount of SDS-sensitive monomeric species (designated M) is also observed under the control conditions (lane 1) and digested upon preincubation in SDS at room temperature (lane 2) yielding low molecular weight peptides. Conversely, complete digestion occurs when the porin samples are preincubated with SDS at 95 °C prior to trypsin digestion (panels A and B, lanes 3 and6). Panel B presents the results of trypsin digestion following incubation with SDS-loading buffer at 95 °C. Under these denaturing conditions, the trimeric conformation is disrupted for both class 2 and OmpF as evidenced by the appearance of monomeric species. Interestingly, a fraction of class 2 monomers exhibits a lower apparent molecular weight, indicative of cleavage by trypsin (lanes 1 and 2). This finding is observed irrespective of the protein concentration or trypsin incubation time and occurs in both native and recombinant class 2 proteins (results not shown) and has also been detected previously in N. meningitidis whole cell extracts (6Frasch C.E. Rubinstein Y. Nguyen N. Ewell J. Proceedings of the 7th International Pathogenic Neisseria Conference, Berlin, Germany. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1990: 213-217Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of trypsin-digested class 2 samples indicates that a 2.6-kDa peptide is shed from the N terminus (6Frasch C.E. Rubinstein Y. Nguyen N. Ewell J. Proceedings of the 7th International Pathogenic Neisseria Conference, Berlin, Germany.

https://openalex.org/W1990503857,"Iron-sulfur proteins acquire their clusters by posttranslational assembly. To identify components involved in this process an in vitro assay for holoprotein formation was established using the [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin of the cyanobacteriumSynechocystis as a model. Conversion of apoferredoxin to the holo- form was observed in an anaerobic reaction medium containing Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2,l-cysteine, glutathione, and catalytic amounts ofSynechocystis extract, specifically depleted of endogeneous ferredoxin. An approximate 2500-fold purification of the converter activity yielded a monomeric, 43-kDa, pyridoxal phosphate-containing enzyme, which catalyzed the breakdown of l-cysteine to yield sulfide (assembled in ferredoxin), pyruvate, and ammonia; 1 mol of [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin was formed per 2 mol of cysteine utilized.The purified enzyme also catalyzed the β-elimination reaction with cysteine in the absence of apoferredoxin. An increased reactivity was found with cystine instead of cysteine, which should yield cysteine persulfide as the primary product.These results provide a function-based identification of a cysteine/cystine C-S-lyase as a participant in ferredoxin Fe-S cluster formation. A substrate-derived cysteine persulfide could be involved in this reaction. Iron-sulfur proteins acquire their clusters by posttranslational assembly.

A substrate-derived cysteine persulfide could be involved in this reaction. Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters are found as functional units in numerous electron-transferring proteins. They are essential in basic biological processes such as oxidative phosphorylation, photosynthesis, and nitrogen fixation. More recently, they have also been identified as components of enzymes not concerned with redox reactions (1Beinert H. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2483-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Lately they have been implicated in gene regulation (2Beinert H. Kiley P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 218-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Despite these important and diverse functions and thorough biochemical investigations of Fe-S proteins, the biosynthetic steps leading to Fe-S cluster assembly have not been established. While it seems likely that enzyme-catalyzed reactions are involved in the formation of Fe-S clusters in vivo, the chemical reconstitution of apoproteins with free ferrous ion and sulfide in the presence of thiols (3Malkin R. Rabinowitz J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1966; 23: 822-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) has been most intensively exploited for cluster build-up in vitro. Nevertheless, several proteins have been suggested as candidates in the biosynthetic process. Rhodanese (4Cerletti P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 369-372Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (5Taniguchi T. Kimura T. Biochim. Biophys.

Analysis of yeast respiration-deficient mutants suggested a role for the BCS1 gene product (6Nobrega F.G. Nobrega M.P. Tzagoloff A.

More recently,nifS was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli; the gene product (NifS) was characterized as a pyridoxal phosphate-containing l-cysteine desulfurase, which yielded alanine and elemental sulfur as products (8Zheng L.

A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar); with dithiothreitol present in the reaction mixture, sulfide was produced instead of sulfur. Further work showed that the apo- form of the nitrogenase iron protein component could be activated by NifS-catalyzed reassembly of its [4Fe-4S] cluster in vitro (9Zheng L. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18723-18726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NifS was also successfully used for the in vitro reconstitution of the [4Fe-4S] cluster of a mutant FNR protein (10Khoroshilova N. Beinert H. Kiley P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2499-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) as well as of the [2Fe-2S] cluster of SoxR (11Hidalgo E. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7269-7272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), both E. coli proteins. Most recently, a NifS-like protein was isolated from E. coli and found to reactivate apodihydroxy acid dehydratase in vitro(12Flint D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16068-16074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The significance of these various findings depends on the nature of thein vivo sulfur source for Fe-S clusters. Feeding experiments with E. coli assigned this role to cysteine (13White R.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 112: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Cysteine sulfur was also incorporated into the [2Fe-2S] cluster of ferredoxin in isolated, intact chloroplasts (14Takahashi Y. Mitsui A. Hase T. Matsubara H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2434-2437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the chloroplast system, ferredoxin cluster formation was found to be a stroma-located process, consisting of two separate steps: first, the NADPH-stimulated liberation of sulfide from cysteine followed by the ATP-dependent sulfide incorporation into ferredoxin (15Takahashi Y. Mitsui A. Fujita Y. Matsubara H. Plant Physiol. 1991; 95: 104-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). With the cyanobacterium Synechocystis as a procaryotic model for the chloroplast organelle we now established an apo- to holoferredoxin conversion assay. The procaryotic system was chosen because of the relative ease of obtaining large quantities of cell material without the problem of compartmentalization. The endogeneous [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin was adopted as the Fe-S protein studied because of its abundance and the well characterized chemical procedures of reversible cluster removal (16Meyer J. Moulis J.-M. Lutz M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 871: 243-249Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Moreover, the physiological existence of apoferredoxin has been demonstrated for the chloroplast system, where cluster assembly occurs in the stroma after proteolytic processing of preferredoxin that is imported from the cytosol (17Pilon M. de Kruijff B. Weisbeek P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2548-2556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We here report on the set up of the assay, the purification and characterization of the converter protein (provisionally named C-DES because of its cysteine desulfhydrase activity), and the stoichiometry of the cluster formation reaction. l-Cysteine andl-propargylglycine were from Fluka;l-allylglycine, l-vinylglycine, and pyridoxal phosphate were from Sigma; d-cysteine was from Novabiochem; and l-cystine was from SERVA. Glutathione and glutathione reductase were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Other chemicals were of the highest purity commercially available.l-[U-14C]Cystine (302.2 mCi/mmol) was obtained from Du Pont NEN. Sephadex G-25 and G-75, DEAE-Sephadex A-25, Q-Sepharose FF, Mono P HR5/5, and Polybuffer 74 were from Pharmacia; Ultrogel AcA 44 and Dowex 50 WX8 were from SERVA; and DE52 cellulose was from Whatman. Ferredoxin-NADP reductase was purified from frozen spinach leaves (18Shin M. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 23: 440-447Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar); the final crystallization step was omitted. Unless otherwise stated, proteins were concentrated by ultrafiltration using PM 10 membranes or Centricon 10 units, both of which were supplied by Amicon. Buffer exchanges were performed using a Sephadex G-25 column. Synechocystis PCC 6714 (ATCC 27178) was grown at 30 °C in BG-11 medium (19Rippka R. Deruelles J. Waterbury J.B. Herdman M. Stanier R.Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 111: 1-61Crossref Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.9 g/liter KHCO3 in an 18-liter fermenter at pH 7.5–8.5. Cultures were illuminated with fluorescent tubes and gassed continuously with 5% CO2. After 4 days of growth, typically 15 g of cell paste was harvested by centrifugation, shock-frozen, and stored at −70 °C. 30 g of frozen cells were thawed, resuspended in 130 ml of 50 mmMops 1The abbreviations used are: Mops, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. /NaOH, pH 8.0, containing 5 mmdithiothreitol and 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and disrupted by sonication. After centrifugation (105 ×g, 90 min) the extract (1500 mg of protein) was concentrated, transferred into 0.15 m Tris/Cl, pH 7.8, containing 0.3 m NaCl (final volume 80 ml), and loaded onto a DEAE-Sephadex A-25 column (20 cm2 × 5 cm, 10 cm/h). The column was washed with 80 ml of starting buffer; all unadsorbed protein (≥1450 mg) was collected and reduced for 30 min at 30 °C with 10 mm dithiothreitol. Then the buffer was exchanged for 50 mm Mops/NaOH, pH 7.6, and this protein preparation was used for experiments requiring deferredoxinized extract. Bound ferredoxin was eluted from the DEAE-Sephadex column with 190 ml of 0.15 m Tris/Cl, pH 7.8, containing 0.5m NaCl. The eluate was treated with DNase and RNase (15 mg each) in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2 (48 h, 4 °C). Ferredoxin was purified to homogeneity (yield 7–8 mg) by ammonium sulfate fractionation and DE52 cellulose chromatography according to Ref. 20Hutson K.G. Rogers L.J. Haslett B.G. Boulter D. Cammack R. Biochem. J. 1978; 172: 465-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar. It was converted to the apo- form by double precipitation with 0.5 N HCl under argon according to Ref.16Meyer J. Moulis J.-M. Lutz M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 871: 243-249Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar. The pellet was dissolved in 50 mm Mops/KOH, pH 8, containing 20 μm EDTA and kept under argon. Apoferredoxin concentration (usually ∼60 μm) was determined by the Bradford method (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215905) Google Scholar) calibrated with holoferredoxin, which was spectrophotometrically quantified (M r = 10,259 (Ref. 22Hase T. Inoue K. Matsubara H. Williams M.M. Rogers L.J. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1982; 92: 1357-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar); ε276 nm = 12,550 m−1cm−1, ε423 nm = 6400m−1 cm−1 (Ref. 23Hutson K.G. Rogers L.J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1980; 7: 279-284Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar)). For purification of C-DES, deferredoxinized extract (80 ml) was gel-filtered on Ultrogel AcA 44 (20 cm2 × 85 cm; 5 cm/h) in 50 mm Mops/NaOH, pH 7.6, containing 20 μmEDTA. C-DES was collected in fractions corresponding toK av values between 0.525 and 0.575. These fractions were diluted with 4 volumes of 50 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.8, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 20 μmEDTA and loaded onto DE52 cellulose (20 cm2 × 3.5 cm; 8 cm/h) equilibrated with this buffer. A linear gradient (560 ml) to 160 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.8, containing 320 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 μm EDTA was applied. C-DES was eluted in the trailing shoulder of the major protein peak. This eluate fraction was diluted with 7 volumes of 50 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mmdithiothreitol and 20 μm EDTA and pumped onto Q-Sepharose FF (5 cm2 × 1.5 cm; 20 cm/h) equilibrated with this buffer. A linear gradient (100 ml) to 150 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.4, containing 300 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 20 μm EDTA was applied. C-DES was eluted just in front of the main protein peak. This fraction was transferred into 25 mm 1-methylpiperazine/iminodiacetic acid, pH 5.7, and applied to a Mono P HR 5/5 column (5 cm/min). Homogeneous C-DES was eluted at a pH of 4.4 using Polybuffer 74 (diluted 1:29 (v/v) and adjusted to pH 4.0 with iminodiacetic acid) as eluant. Separation of C-DES from Polybuffer and transfer into 50 mm Mops/NaOH, pH 7.6, was achieved by gel filtration on Sephadex G-75. All operations were carried out at 4 °C except for chromatofocusing, which was performed at room temperature. The final C-DES preparation was stored at −70 °C; its activity proved to be stable for several months. The standard assay for holoferredoxin formation, run at 30 °C under argon, contained 10 μm apoferredoxin, which was incubated with samples of deferredoxinized Synechocystis extract (or purified fractions thereof) in 55 mm Mops/KOH, pH 7.5, 9 mm glutathione, 0.15 mm pyridoxal phosphate, and 90 μml-cysteine. The reaction was started by the addition of Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 to a final concentration of 0.4 mm (final volume 30 μl to 0.35 ml). The reaction was stopped, routinely after 1 h, by the addition of 1.7 mm EDTA and 10% glycerol. The holoferredoxin content of the sample was analyzed by native PAGE (20% resolving gel, Laemmli buffer system (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207094) Google Scholar) with SDS omitted); the same result was obtained whether the sample was analyzed immediately or after freezing. The gels were stained with the carbocyanine dye “stains all” (4, 5, 4′, 5′-dibenzo-3, 3′-diethyl-9-methylthiacarbocyanine bromide) (25Green M.R. Pastewka J.V. Peacock A.C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar); the amount of holoferredoxin (0.1–1 μg/lane) was estimated by comparison with known standards of ferredoxin. Exact quantities of holoferredoxin were determined (after transfer into 50 mm Mops/NaOH, pH 7.6) by activity measurements made according to Ref. 26Brandt M.E. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17126-17130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; the rate of cytochrome c reduction by NADPH via ferredoxin, which is mediated by ferredoxin-NADP reductase, was measured, and 1 μg of ferredoxin in 0.5 ml gave a ΔA 550 of 0.2 min−1cm−1 under the conditions employed. Where specified, substrate concentrations in the standard assay were varied as follows. Free sulfide (up to 0.4 mm), mercaptopyruvate (up to 5 mm), coenzyme A (0.5 mm), or thiosulfate (0.5 mm) was used instead of cysteine; the concentration of cysteine employed was varied from 20 μm to 2 mm, and the concentration of Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 was varied from 20 μm to 0.5 mm. ATP and NADPH (up to 5 mm each) were added to some reactions. The standard assay composition was modified as follows. 45 μm[14C]cystine (adjusted to 11,200 dpm/nmol), reducedin situ prior to the addition of apoferredoxin by a 100-fold excess of glutathione to yield [14C]cysteine (5600 dpm/nmol) was employed. [14C]Pyruvate formed during the reaction was quantified both by Dowex 50 WX8 passage and phenylhydrazine derivatization. Following the addition of 2N HCl to a final concentration of 285 mm, a 30-μl aliquot (13,000 dpm) of the assay mix was diluted to 1 ml with H2O and applied to a 1-ml column of Dowex 50 WX8 (H+ form), equilibrated with 5 mm HCl. The14C content of the total eluate, including a 1.5-ml wash with 5 mm HCl, was determined and valued as pyruvate. A further 30-μl aliquot was mixed with 10 μmol of unlabeled pyruvate; after the addition of HClO4 (final concentration 75 mm), 50 μmol of phenylhydrazine were added to give a final volume of 1 ml. The precipitated pyruvate phenylhydrazone was collected, and its specific radioactivity was determined. Each nmol of [14C]pyruvate (in the sample) raised the value obtained by 560 dpm/μmol. About 50 mg (wet weight) of freshly grownSynechocystis cells were suspended in 0.5 ml of 0.1m HClO4 containing 10 mm EDTA and disrupted by vigorous shaking (7 min) with 500 mg of glass beads (125–200 μm). The suspension was neutralized with 0.1 mKOH and centrifuged. Glutathione contained in the supernatant was determined using the kinetic glutathione reductase assay coupled to the reduction of 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) (27Akerboom T.P.M. Sies H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). Native separations at pH 7–8 were performed using 8% resolving gels and the buffer system of Williams and Reisfeld (28Williams D.E. Reisfeld R.A. Annu. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis (1.3 watts, 3 h) the gel was sliced in horizontal strips of 2 mm × 7 cm, and proteins were eluted with gentle shaking overnight in 2 ml of 50 mmMops/NaOH, pH 7.6, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 20 μm EDTA. SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207094) Google Scholar) was routinely performed with 12% acrylamide gels; proteins were visualized by Coomassie staining. The following molecular mass standards were used: bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), aldolase (40 kDa), carboanhydrase (30 kDa), and cytochromec (12.5 kDa). To perform the apo- to holoferredoxin conversion assay, it was necessary to resolve the crude extract of Synechocystis wild type cells into two fractions: one containing specifically the abundant endogenous (holo)ferredoxin and the other comprising all remaining proteins. The strategy pursued is outlined in Fig. 1. The extract proteins were transferred into a high salt buffer (0.43 m chloride) and then applied to a DEAE-Sephadex A-25 column. The stringent buffer conditions and the small pore size of the gel matrix (exclusion limit 30 kDa) permitted essentially all proteins to pass through the column (Table I, Fig. 2). However, a very small amount of protein was retained, namely all of the ferredoxin and a few other polypeptides that could be detected by SDS-PAGE after elution from the column with 0.63 m chloride (Fig. 2, lane C). The ferredoxin in this fraction was purified to homogeneity and converted to the apo- form via acidic precipitation. This preparation was used for studying holoferredoxin formation mediated by deferredoxinized extract.Table IPurification of C-DESPurification stageProteinSpecific activityYieldDependence on l-cysteinemgμg holo-fd1-aholoferredoxin./h mg%Cell extract1500NDbnot determinable because of interference from endogenous holoferredoxin.NDDeferredoxinized extract≥14503100NoneAcA442201366NoneDE52 cellulose257040WeakQ-Sepharose FF1014032PartialMono P0.08800015Totala holoferredoxin.b not determinable because of interference from endogenous holoferredoxin.

Protein samples, boiled with 1% SDS, 2% mercaptoethanol before application to the gel (12% acrylamide), were as follows: crude extract (25 μg, lane A), deferredoxinized extract (25 μg, lane B), DEAE-Sephadex fraction containing ferredoxin (amount corresponding to 345 μg of extract proteins, lane C), and C-DES (1 μg,lane D). Coomassie Blue was used for staining. Numbers (representing kilodaltons) indicate marker protein migration. The position taken by Synechocystis ferredoxin is indicated by an arrow; it displays reduced mobility as typical of acidic proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Apo- to holoferredoxin conversion was analyzed routinely by native PAGE (Fig. 3) making use of the dramatic increase in electrophoretic mobility of ferredoxin upon acquisition of its [2Fe-2S] cluster. Deferredoxinized extract (up to 150 μg of protein/lane) contained no other protein that could have interfered by migrating in a similar position (Fig. 3, lane 0). This method also displayed the redox status of residual apoprotein; the intact species, with its 6 cysteinyl residues, which was the only one that could be reconstituted, had the lowest mobility compared with the oxidized species, containing internal disulfide bonds (Fig. 3). The assay composition was optimized for holoferredoxin formation with deferredoxinized Synechocystis extract as enzyme source. Basic features of the system were the absolute requirement for extract proteins and free ferrous ion for conversion to occur. All assays were performed under argon and with glutathione present as reductant to protect apoferredoxin from any oxidation. The addition of any further sulfur compound (cysteine, sulfide, mercaptopyruvate, coenzyme A, thiosulfate; see “Experimental Procedures”) was not needed. However, later in purification l-cysteine was required (Table I), and sulfide (favored initially because of the findings reported in Ref. 15Takahashi Y. Mitsui A. Fujita Y. Matsubara H. Plant Physiol. 1991; 95: 104-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) as well as the other sulfur compounds tested was ineffective. With sulfide-supplemented assays, the order of the additions was critical; our standard assay protocol, with ferrous ion added last, did not result in any spontaneous chemical reconstitution. The addition of pyridoxal phosphate, ATP, or NADPH had no significant effect. Substitution of deferredoxinized extract by a corresponding amount of the resuspended membranous pellet did not support apo- to holoferredoxin conversion. It should be noted that the occurrence of glutathione (reported for several cyanobacteria; Ref. 29Schmidt A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 572-583Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar) in Synechocystis cells was verified; per gram wet cells, 1.8 μmol of glutathione were found, corresponding to an intracellular concentration of about 4 mm. The purification procedure is outlined in Fig. 1 and detailed in Table I; included in the table is the dependence of holoferredoxin formation, mediated by the various protein fractions, on the presence ofl-cysteine. An initial approach to estimate the number and size of proteins involved in conversion was to perform a frontal analysis experiment; deferredoxinized extract was continuously applied to an Ultrogel AcA 44 column. Effluent fractions were assayed; holoferredoxin formation started from a K av value of 0.5. About the sameK av value was determined from a zonal gel filtration run (Fig. 4); only protein(s) with a molecular mass of 40 ± 5 kDa should therefore be involved. Further purification employed ion exchange chromatography on DE 52 cellulose. However, recovery of conversion activity was rather poor (about 10%) without an extra sulfur compound added. Therefore, again the assay mixture was supplemented with the various sulfur compounds (see above). Only l-cysteine was found to restore holoferredoxin formation (recovery 60–70%), whereby a concentration of 90 μm proved to be sufficient; pyridoxal phosphate stimulated slightly, whereas ATP did not exert any effect. These properties were retained after chromatography on Q-Sepharose FF. Thus, by using ion exchange-purified C-DES preparations, the standard assay conditions with 90 μml-cysteine, 0.15 mm pyridoxal phosphate, and 0.4 mmFe(NH4)2(SO4)2 could be established. Nevertheless, the active fractions were still rather impure. Therefore, Q-Sepharose fractions were carried through native PAGE or chromatofocusing. Proteins eluted from slices of native gels were tested for conversion and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, which revealed a 43-kDa polypeptide contained in the active eluates (data not shown). Detection of the same single polypeptide correlated with conversion activity recovered after separation of Q-Sepharose fractions by chromatofocusing on a Mono P column (Fig. 2, lane D; Table I). Since both strategies independently identified the same 43-kDa polypeptide, this protein was considered as the active component. With homogenous C-DES, l-cysteine was an absolute requirement for holoferredoxin formation (Table I), implicating cysteine as the relevant sulfur source for this enzyme. The omission of pyridoxal phosphate from the standard assay mixture approximately halved the reaction rate, suggesting that C-DES is pyridoxal phosphate-dependent. From the literature, the following product patterns are known to result from cysteine cleavage by pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes: sulfide, pyruvate, and ammonia (31Kredich N.M. Foote L.J. Keenan B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6187-6196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or sulfur and alanine (8Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). For every 2 mol of cysteine utilized, approximately 1 mol of holoferredoxin and 2 mol of pyruvate were produced (Fig.5); residual cysteine was quantified after derivatization with vinylpyridine (data not shown), and ammonia was not measured. To obtain these quantitative data, holoferredoxin activity was determined by the cytochrome c reduction assay. The fate of cysteine was traced by employing the 14C-labeled compound. [14C]Pyruvate formed was distinguished from alanine by passage through Dowex 50 at pH 2 and further identified by coderivatization with unlabeled pyruvate using phenylhydrazine (Fig.5). During the time course of the reaction, 37 nmol of ferredoxin were formed per nmol of C-DES employed (Fig. 5). Therefore, C-DES serves as catalyst that mediates the following overall reaction. Apoferredoxin+2L­cysteine+2Fe2++22O→ [2Fe­2S]ferredoxin+2pyruvate+2NH3 REACTION 1To determine the specificity of C-DES for l-cysteine in supporting holoferredoxin formation, several related substances were tested as potential substitutes; neither d-cysteine (90 μm), cysteamine (90 μm to 0.5 mm), l-cysteinylglycine (0.2–1 mm), N-acetyl-l-cysteine (90 μm), nor l-homocysteine (90 μmto 0.5 mm) was effective. Having established the stoichiometry of the complete reaction system (Reaction 1), we investigated whether cysteine was processed by C-DES in the absence of apoferredoxin. In fact, pyruvate formation occurred at the same rate as before (28 nmol min−1 mg−1 with 90 μm cysteine; see Figs. 5 and 6). In this context we also examined reactions with l-cystine included instead of cysteine (glutathione omitted; Fig. 6). Surprisingly, pyruvate formation occurred readily; with 45 μm cystine instead of 90 μm cysteine an approximately 15-fold higher rate was observed. When the reaction was run until substrate depletion, finally 2 mol of pyruvate were yielded per mol of cystine employed. The sulfur-containing product, possibly H2S2, was not characterized. In light of these findings, C-DES should more properly be considered as a cysteine/cystine C-S-lyase. The question of whether cystine is also a better substrate in the holoferredoxin formation assay could not be investigated, since in the presence of excess glutathione (required for apoferredoxin protection) cystine is predominantly reduced to cysteine. The molecular mass of C-DES was determined as 40 ± 5 kDa by gel filtration (Fig. 4) and as 43 ± 2 kDa by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). These data identified the enzyme as a monomer. Stimulation of C-DES activity by the addition of pyridoxal phosphate in context with the β-elimination reaction observed with either cysteine or cystine as substrate was taken as evidence for C-DES being a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme whereby about 50% of the molecules retain their coenzyme after purification. Given the small amount of protein available, this assumption could not be directly tested by chemical or spectroscopic analyses. However, NaBH4 treatment of C-DES (10 mmNaBH4 for 1 h at 30 °C, pH 7.5–7.2) resulted in complete inactivation of the pyridoxal phosphate-loaded enzyme, indicating susceptibility to Schiff base reduction (32Fischer E.H. Kent A.B. Snyder E.R. Krebs E.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1958; 80: 2906-2907Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). NifS protein (producing sulfur and alanine from cysteine) has been reported to be particularly sensitive to inactivation by various thiol-alkylating agents including unsaturated amino acid derivatives (8Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 33Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4714-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the susceptibility of C-DES towardN-ethylmaleimide (0.1 mm), iodoacetamide (1 mm), l-allylglycine (5 mm), andl-vinylglycine (5 mm). After an incubation period of 30 min at 30 °C, C-DES was separated from excess reagent and assayed for apo- to holoferredoxin conversion. Its activity proved to be virtually unimpaired. A further experiment was conducted employing 5 mml-propargylglycine, which is an irreversible inhibitor of γ-cystathionase (34Washtien W. Abeles R.H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2485-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Again C-DES activity remained stable. Based on a self-contained assay system derived from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis we pursued a systematic search for a protein capable of directing [2Fe-2S] cluster assembly of ferredoxin. Purification identified a monomeric, 43-kDa, pyridoxal phosphate containing lyase named C-DES, which specifically and efficiently used l-cysteine as precursor for cluster sulfide. From our purification results, the cellular concentration of ferredoxin is estimated to be 60–120 μm, and the concentration of C-DES is estimated to be 0.15–1 μm. The resulting molar ratio of about 150:1 is of the same order as that employed in our assays (e.g. 120:1 for the experiment outlined in Fig. 5). Taking into account the doubling time of about 10 h under the growth conditions employed, Synechocystis cells synthesize approximately 1 mg of ferredoxin/30 g of wet cells/h. The endogenous ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] cluster-forming activity detected by our assay was more than sufficient to meet the cells' requirements (TableI). In the initial purification stages, the addition ofl-cysteine was not required for in vitro cluster formation. Obviously, some enzyme component(s) of the crude extract supplied the sulfur source, probably by utilizing glutathione. Free sulfide did not exert any effect in our system at any stage of purification, which is in contrast to the chloroplast system (15Takahashi Y. Mitsui A. Fujita Y. Matsubara H. Plant Physiol. 1991; 95: 104-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A further difference is the lack of any requirement for ATP. The product pattern resulting from l-cysteine is identical to that of cysteine desulfhydrase of Salmonella typhimurium(31Kredich N.M. Foote L.J. Keenan B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6187-6196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in contrast to C-DES the S. typhimuriumprotein is tetrameric and is a more typical catabolic enzyme, with its high specific activity (450 μmol min−1 mg−1with 2 mm cysteine as substrate; Ref. 35Kredich N.M.

From a functional point of view, isolation of a NifS-like protein might have been expected, especially when considering the widespread occurrence of NifS-type sequences (8Zheng L. White R.H.

Wada T. Watanabe A. Yamada M. Yasuda M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 109-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2120) Google Scholar). Indeed, C-DES and NifS are both pyridoxal phosphate-containing enzymes, degradingl-cysteine with similar rates (89 nmol min−1mg−1 for NifS with 0.5 mm cysteine (8Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), 28 nmol min−1 mg−1 for C-DES with 90 μm cysteine). Both catalyze cysteine cleavage in the absence as well as in the presence of apoprotein; therefore, the release of sulfur from cysteine and its insertion into the Fe-S cluster do not seem to be necessarily coupled processes with these enzymes. However, it should be emphasized that cysteine sulfur released by C-DES was quantitatively found assembled in the [2Fe-2S] cluster of ferredoxin (see Fig. 5), indicating interaction between C-DES and the apoprotein substrate. Distinct from NifS, C-DES is monomeric, produces pyruvate, ammonia, and sulfide instead of alanine and sulfur, and cannot be inhibited by thiol-alkylating reagents. A striking feature of C-DES is its reactivity with cystine, which finally yields two equivalents of pyruvate. This reaction is known as a secondary activity of certain β- and γ-cystathionases (37Delavier-Klutchko C. Flavin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 99: 375-377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Flavin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 768-777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which are all homooligomeric enzymes. Including cysteine in the presence of excess glutathione in our reaction medium, we initially thought of this reduced compound as the primary sulfur donor species for [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin formation. By the increased reactivity of C-DES with cystine, we became aware of the possibility that the equilibrium concentration of cystine during conversion might be crucial. β-Elimination starting with cystine should yield cysteine persulfide as substrate-derived sulfane carrier compound. Whether this persulfidic intermediate is formed during catalysis by C-DES and is involved in sulfur transfer to apoferredoxin awaits further studies. Work on such mechanistic problems will be greatly aided by the availability of substantial amounts of purified C-DES. Cloning, sequencing of the gene, and overexpression of C-DES in E. coli are in progress. Based on the sequence information, targeted inactivation should reveal the physiological consequences of a defective C-DES gene in Synechocystis. Using this approach we hope to examine the in vivo role of C-DES in ferredoxin Fe-S cluster formation.

Calcium transport ATPases associated with intracellular calcium storage organelles play a major role in controlling this process by accumulating calcium from the cytosol into intracellular calcium pools. In this study the modulation of the expression of the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium transport ATPase (SERCA) isoenzymes has been studied in lymphocytes undergoing phorbol myristate acetate and ionomycin-induced activation.

The formation of diacylglycerol results in the activation of various cellular protein kinase C isoenzymes, and the binding of IP3 to its receptor induces the release of calcium into the cytosol from intracellular calcium storage organelles (1Weiss A.

Because the increase of cytosolic calcium concentration, as well as the depletion of intracellular calcium pools, generate several activatory signals (5Berridge M.J.

The IID8 antibody recognizes the SERCA 2b isoform at 100 kDa, whereas the PLIM430 antibody, obtained by immunizing with purified platelet internal membrane preparations (19Hack N. Wilkinson J.M.

To better elucidate the functional specialization of the coexpressed calcium pump isoforms, in the present work we investigated the modulation of the expression of these enzymes during in vitro lymphocyte activation, a process where significant changes of cell function, structure, and signaling occur. Ionomycin and the IID8 anti-SERCA 2 monoclonal antibody were purchased from BioMol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). PMA and avidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate were from Sigma. Cyclosporine-A was purchased from Calbiochem. Biotin-conjugated anti-recombinant human IL-2 receptor α chain antibody and the IL-2 immunoassay kit (Quantikine ELISA) were from R & D Systems Europe Ltd. and were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Peroxidase-conjugated as well as fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). The Jurkat-derived JurE6–1 clone (22Weiss A. Wiscocil R. Stobo J.D. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 123-128PubMed Google Scholar), as well as the Molt-4 and the CCRF-CEM cell lines were obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium with Glutamax-I supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a humidified cell culture incubator at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Glutamax-I and glutamine were used in combination to compensate for the increased metabolic requirements of the cells due to the experimentally induced increase of calcium permeability. Exponentially growing cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in fresh complete medium at a density of 2 × 105 cells/ml and placed in 9-cm-diameter Petri dishes. Cells were then placed for 1 h in the cell culture incubator before stimulation. Drugs were then added from concentrated stock solutions in Me2So. The concentration of Me2So did not exceed 0.1%, was included in control experiments, and did not interfere with the assays. Cyclosporine-A was added 1 h prior to PMA or ionomycin treatment. Following the treatments for the time periods indicated on the figures, cell counts and viabilities were determined by the trypan blue exclusion method, and the cells were harvested by centrifugation. The supernatant was saved for IL-2 determination, and the cells were resuspended in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, spun down in microcentrifuge tubes, and immediately frozen as a pellet on dry ice. The cell pellets were thawed at a density of 107 cells/ml in a lysis buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 100 mmdithiothreitol, 2 m urea, and 0.02% bromphenol blue (23Heim R.

Cells were homogenized by aspiration (15–20 strokes) using a 2-ml Hamilton syringe. Samples containing the lysates of 2 × 105 cells (20 μl) were run on 7.5% alkaline Läemmli-type polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Saturation of nitrocellulose and immunostaining was performed in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5% dry milk, and 0.1% Tween 20 as described previously (24Kovàcs T. Corvazier E. Papp B. Magnier C. Bredoux R. Enyedi A. Sarkadi B. Enouf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6177-6184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Luminescent signal was generated and detected using the Enhanced Chemiluminescence system (ECL) of Amersham. Luminograms were scanned and quantitated using an LKB Ultroscan XL Laser Densitometer. In control experiments we determined that the conditions used for immunostaining and detection gave signals proportional to the amount of SERCA protein loaded on the gels, and thus these conditions were suitable for the quantitative detection of SERCA protein in whole cell lysates. Immunofluorescent staining was performed on acetone-fixed cells as described previously (25Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 359-420Google Scholar). SERCAPLIM430 and SERCA 2b mRNA levels were estimated using a semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR method described previously (48Bobe R. Bredoux R. Wuytack F. Quarck R. Kovàcs T. Papp B. Corvazier E. Magnier C. Enouf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1417-1424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA from cells treated for 4 days with PMA plus ionomycin or vehicle control was reverse transcribed and amplified using the Perkin-Elmer GeneAmp RNA PCR kit and TaqDNA polymerase according to the manufacturers instructions by 30 cycles (each cycle consisting of 30 s at 94 °C, 2 min at 55 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C). The primers used to amplify SERCA 2b were TCATCTTCCAGATCACACCGCT and GTCAAGACCAGAACATATC, which cover the region from base pairs 2861 to 3132 of the human sequence (48Bobe R. Bredoux R. Wuytack F. Quarck R. Kovàcs T. Papp B. Corvazier E. Magnier C. Enouf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1417-1424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SERCAPLIM430 was amplified using the primers GAGTCACGCTTCCCCACCACC and TCAACTTCTGGCTCATTTCTT, which cover the region located between base pairs 2674 and 3000 (15Dode L. Wuytack F. Kools P.F. Baba-Aissa F. Raeymaekers L. Brik F. Van de Ven W.J.M. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Data presented in this paper represent the results of at least four independent experiments. JurE6–1 cells were treated for 4 days with 0.5 μm ionomycin, 10 nm PMA, or a combination of the two drugs. Whole cell lysates were electrophoresed and immunoblotted using the SERCA isoform-specific discriminating antibodies IID8 and PLIM430. IL-2 secretion by the cells was quantitated by ELISA. In accordance with previous studies (17Papp B. Enyedi A. Kovàcs T. Sarkadi B. Wuytack F. Thastrup O. Gàrdos G. Bredoux R. Levy-Toledano S. Enouf J. J. Biol.

As shown on Fig. 1, untreated cells expressed similar amounts of the two pump isoforms (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1 and 5), whereas a combined treatment with the two drugs resulted in an approximately 90% decrease of the expression of SERCAPLIM430 (Fig. 1, A, lane 2, andB) and an approximately 2-fold increase of the expression of SERCA 2b (Fig. 1, A, lane 6, and B). Ionomycin or PMA, when applied alone, did not modify significantly the expression of either calcium pump isoform in this system (Fig. 1,A, lanes 3, 4, 7, and8, and B). The differential modulation of the expression of the two pump species was also manifest on the mRNA level. As shown on Fig. 1 C, treatment of JurE6–1 cells by PMA plus ionomycin resulted in an approximately 2-fold decrease of SERCAPLIM430 mRNA (lane 3, untreated;lane 4, treated), whereas in the same cells SERCA 2b mRNA was increased approximately 2-fold (lanes 1 and2). Supernatants of JurE6–1 cells treated as above were collected, and their IL-2 content was quantitated by ELISA. In accordance with previous data (22Weiss A. Wiscocil R. Stobo J.D. J.

In accordance with data in the literature (22Weiss A. Wiscocil R. Stobo J.D. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 123-128PubMed Google Scholar, 26Truneh A. Albert F. Golstein P. Schmitt-Verhulst A-M.

JurE6–1 cells were treated for various time periods with PMA together with ionomycin, and SERCA expression was determined by immunoblotting. As shown on Fig. 2(A and B), SERCAPLIM430 expression started to decline at hour 9 after treatment. The induction of SERCA 2b expression followed a somewhat slower time course, being manifest starting at day 2 (Fig. 2, A and C). The state of activation of the cells was monitored in parallel by immunostaining for the α chain of the IL-2 receptor and by measuring IL-2 secretion, two established markers of T lymphocyte activation. SERCAPLIM430 down-regulation and the induction of IL-2 synthesis (Fig. 2 E) followed a similar time course, whereas the expression of the α chain of the IL-2 receptor expression appeared somewhat delayed (Fig. 2, A and D). In accordance with previous data (31Tsutsumi A. Kubo M. Fujii H. Freire-Moar J. Turck C.W. Ransom J.T. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1746-1754PubMed Google Scholar), PMA plus ionomycin treatment resulted in growth arrest of Jurkat cells with maintained viability. SERCAPLIM430down-regulation by PMA together with ionomycin was also manifested at the single cell level. In untreated cells a granular staining was seen for both SERCA isoforms in the cytoplasmic space, corresponding to the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 3, A andC). Although the fluorescence signal for SERCA 2b was not detectably modified by a treatment with PMA plus ionomycin (Fig.3 B), a marked decrease of staining for SERCAPLIM430 could be seen in PMA plus ionomycin-treated cells (Fig. 3 D). JurE6–1 cells were preincubated with various concentrations of cyclosporine-A for 1 h and then treated for 4 days with PMA and ionomycin. As shown on Fig. 4, cyclosporine-A in the submicromolar range abolished in a concentration-dependent manner the modulation of the expression of SERCAPLIM430 (Fig.4 A) and of SERCA 2b (Fig. 4 B) as well as IL-2 synthesis (Fig. 4 C) induced by PMA plus ionomycin. Cyclosporine-A applied alone had no effect on SERCA expression (not shown). Second messenger mediated calcium mobilization and protein kinase C activation are key events in lymphocyte signaling. In this work these signals were induced simultaneously by the combined treatment of cells by ionomycin and PMA. This technique is widely employed in the literature to obtain T cell activation and induces IL-2 synthesis and the expression of the α chain of the IL-2 receptor (22Weiss A. Wiscocil R. Stobo J.D. J.

As shown in the present work, such a treatment results in the isoform-specific modulation of the expression of the SERCA enzymes expressed in Jurkat T lymphoblastoid cells. The SERCAPLIM430 calcium pump isoform is almost completely down-modulated, whereas the expression of SERCA 2b is increased 2-fold in the same cells. This results in a more than 15-fold overall increase in the relative ratio of the expression of SERCA 2b versusSERCAPLIM430. Similar results were obtained with Molt-4 and CCRF-CEM T lymphocytes as well (not shown). The modulation of SERCAPLIM430 expression in Jurkat cells occurred in parallel with the induction of IL-2 secretion and preceded the induction of the expression of the α chain of the IL-2 receptor. Similarly to the induction of IL-2 expression (22Weiss A. Wiscocil R. Stobo J.D. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 123-128PubMed Google Scholar, 26Truneh A. Albert F. Golstein P. Schmitt-Verhulst A-M. Nature. 1985; 313: 318-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar), the effect on SERCA expression was strictly dependent on the simultaneous presence of both drugs, because PMA or ionomycin, when applied alone, was without effect either on SERCA expression or on IL-2 expression. Cyclosporine-A is a major, clinically used immunosuppressant that forms trimeric complexes with cyclophyllins and the calcium-calmodulin-dependent serin-threonin phosphatase, calcineurin. The formation of such a ternary complex leads to the inhibition of calcineurin enzyme activity and impaired signal transduction to the nucleus by NFAT (33Wesselborg S. Fruman D.A. Sagoo J.K.

In this work the PMA plus ionomycin-induced IL-2 secretion and the modulation of SERCA 2b and SERCAPLIM430 expression were abolished by cyclosporine-A in the submicromolar range. This suggests that calcineurin-dependent signaling, a key component in T cell activation, is involved in the control of the expression of SERCA enzymes in lymphocytes. It has been shown earlier that lymphocyte activation produces modifications of the calcium storage and release characteristics of the cell (38Clementi E. Martino G. Grimaldi L.M. Brambilla E. Meldolesi J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 1365-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and that SERCA enzyme activity is involved in the control of cell proliferation and of lymphocyte activation (39Breittmayer J-P. Ticchioni M. Ferrua B. Bernard A. Aussel C. Cell. Immunol. 1993; 149: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 40Papp B. Byrn R.A. J. Biol.

However, the role and the modulation of the expression of the various SERCA isoforms, coexpressed in the cell, have not been previously investigated. The data presented in this work indicate that striking differences exist in the regulation of expression of the SERCA isoforms during lymphocyte activation. This phenomenon probably reflects that various SERCA isoforms play functionally distinct roles and are associated with functionally distinct subcompartments of the endoplasmic reticulum. SERCAPLIM430 is believed to be a variant of SERCA 3, the expression of which is restricted to cells of hemopoietic origin (15Dode L. Wuytack F. Kools P.F. Baba-Aissa F. Raeymaekers L. Brik F.

The observation, shown in this paper, that SERCAPLIM430 and SERCA 2b mRNA levels are differentially modulated by PMA plus ionomycin suggests that transcriptional regulation may be involved in the control of SERCA expression during lymphocyte activation. Indeed, simultaneous calcium mobilization and protein kinase C activation sets in motion a complex intracellular signaling network including calmodulin-dependent protein kinases and calcineurin (49Enslen H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20872-20877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as the Jun-N-terminal kinase pathway (47Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neirah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). This leads to the modulation of the activity of several transcription factors such as NFκB, NFAT or AP-1 (9Rothenberg E.V. Ward S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9358-9365Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), resulting in a complex set of modifications of gene expression, including, as shown in this work, intracellular calcium pump isoenzymes. The use of specific inhibitors of the different key factors of this complex signaling system and experiments addressing SERCA gene transcription and mRNA stability will permit a more detailed analysis of the mechanisms involved in the regulation of SERCA expression. The plasticity of expression of the various SERCA isoforms upon cell activation represents a previously unrecognized level of complexity of lymphocyte calcium homeostasis and shows that different SERCA isoforms and therefore presumably different calcium pools may play distinct roles in cell activation. This finding points at the dinamic nature of the structure and function of calcium homeostatic systems of differentiating cells and may open new perspectives in the understanding of intracellular calcium homeostasis and in the pharmacological control of lymphocyte function.

It phosphorylates four proteins with estimated molecular masses of 22, 34, 46, and 90 kDa from the T. brucei bloodstream-form lysatein vitro. KFR1 bears significant sequence similarity to the yeast MAP kinases KSS1 and FUS3 but cannot functionally complement thekss1/fus3 yeast mutant. It is encoded by a single-copy gene in the diploid T. brucei, and only one of the two alleles can be successfully disrupted, suggesting an essential function ofKFR1 in T. brucei. KFR1 activity is present at a much enhanced level in the bloodstream form of T. bruceiwhen compared with that in the insect (procyclic) form. This enhanced activity can be eliminated in vitro by the treatment with protein phosphatase HVH2 known to act specifically on MAP kinases. It can also be decreased in the bloodstream form of T. bruceiby serum starvation but induced specifically by interferon-γ. The production of interferon-γ in the mammalian host is known to be triggered by T. brucei infection, and this cytokine, as has been reported, promotes the proliferation of T. brucei in the mammalian blood. Since none of these phenomena can be observed in the procyclic form of T. brucei, activation of KFR1 is most likely involved in mediating the interferon-γ-induced proliferation of T. brucei in the mammalian host.

Many parasites employ unique strategies to escape the host immunity by taking advantage of their environmental niches. For example, Trypanosoma cruzi, a protozoan parasite causing chronic debilitating Chagas' disease in Latin America, avoids the host immune response by invading host cells. This invasion is mediated by activation transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) 1The abbreviations used are: TGF-β, transforming growth factor β; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PARP, procyclic acidic repetitive protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GST, glutathione S-transferase. 1The abbreviations used are: TGF-β, transforming growth factor β; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PARP, procyclic acidic repetitive protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GST, glutathione S-transferase. signaling pathway in the mammalian cells (1Ming M.

On the other hand, Trypanosoma brucei, an extracellular parasite that causes African sleeping sickness in man and nagana in cattle, escapes the host defense system primarily by repeatedly changing its variant surface glycoprotein coat (2Cross G.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 83-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 3Mansfield J.M. Parasitol. Today. 1994; 10: 267-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This flagellated parasite exists primarily in two distinct forms in its life cycle, the bloodstream form in the mammalian host and the procyclic form in the transmitting vector, the tsetse fly. It has been reported that there is a bidirectional interaction between T. bruceiand the mammalian host immune system (4Bakhiet M. Olsson T. van der Meide P. Kristensson K. Clin. Exp.

Cell. 1993; 72: 715-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Upon invasion of the host,T. brucei releases a 44-kDa lymphocyte-triggering factor (8Bakhiet M. Olsson T. Edlund C. Hojeberg B. Holmberg K. Lorentzen J. Kristensson K. Scand. J. Immunol. 1993; 37: 165-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), which binds to host CD8+ T cells and triggers interferon-γ production in the host (7Olsson T. Bakhiet M. Hojeberg B.

By injecting monoclonal antibody against the lymphocyte-triggering factor or depleting CD8+ cells in T. brucei-infected animals, interferon-γ production was abrogated, growth of trypanosome suppressed, and survival of the infected animals prolonged (4Bakhiet M.

Bakhiet M. Edlund C. Hojeberg B. Van der Meide P. Kristensson K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 2447-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Administration of interferon-γ antibody to the infected animals can reduce parasitemia and prolong the survival of the animals (7Olsson T. Bakhiet M. Hojeberg B. Ljungdahl A. Edlund C. Andersson G. Ekre H.P. Fung L.W. Mak T. Wigzell H. Cell. 1993; 72: 715-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of this interferon-γ action is, however, unclear at present. Interferons, which exhibit a wide range of biological effects on cells and animals, play important roles in modulating the immune system (9Pestka S. Langer J.A. Zoon K.C. Samuel C.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 727-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar, 10De Maeyer E. De Maeyer-Guignard J. Interferons and Other Regulatory Cytokines. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988Google Scholar, 11Sen G.C. Lengyel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5017-5020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among the three major classes of interferons (IFN-α, IFN-β, and IFN-γ), interferon-γ is the most important immunomodulator. It induces major histocompatibility complex class I and class II, regulates isotype expression of Igs, and activates monocytes and macrophages by enhancing Fc receptor expression (12Pearse R.N. Feinman R. Shuai K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Ravetch J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4314-4318Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 13Farrar M.A. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 571-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). It also has antiviral, antitumor, and antiproliferation activities in mammals (9Pestka S. Langer J.A. Zoon K.C. Samuel C.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 727-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar, 10De Maeyer E. De Maeyer-Guignard J. Interferons and Other Regulatory Cytokines. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988Google Scholar). The antiproliferation activity is partly through blockage of the protein kinase C-dependent mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation pathway (14Xu J. Rockow S. Kim S. Xiong W. Li W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8018-8027Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 15Xu J. Kim S. Chen M. Rockow S. Yi S.E. Wagner A.J. Hay N. Weichselbaum R.R. Li W. Blood. 1995; 86: 2774-2788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interferon-γ can specifically block platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)- and phorbol ester-stimulated activation of Raf-1 and MAP kinases in fibroblast cells (14Xu J. Rockow S. Kim S. Xiong W. Li W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8018-8027Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It can also block the colony-stimulating factor-1-stimulated MAP kinase activation via Jak1/Jak2 (Janus kinase) in macrophages (15Xu J. Kim S. Chen M. Rockow S. Yi S.E. Wagner A.J. Hay N. Weichselbaum R.R. Li W. Blood. 1995; 86: 2774-2788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This blockage of MAP kinase activation contributes to the antiproliferation effects of interferons in mammals (15Xu J. Kim S. Chen M. Rockow S. Yi S.E. Wagner A.J. Hay N. Weichselbaum R.R. Li W. Blood. 1995; 86: 2774-2788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously cloned a gene encoding a MAP kinase homologue,KFR1, from T. brucei that bears significant sequence homologies to the yeast MAP kinase homologues,KSS1/FUS3, and other Xenopus and mammalian MAP kinases, ERK1 and ERK2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) (16Hua S.B. Wang C.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 54: 20-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The characteristic MAP kinase motif, including the amino acid residues TEY between protein kinase subregions VII and VIII, is very well conserved in KFR1. The KFR1messenger RNA level in the bloodstream form of T. brucei is much higher than that in the insect (procyclic) form (16Hua S.B. Wang C.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 54: 20-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), suggesting that KFR1 may play an important role in the former. Here we report that KFR1 is capable of phosphorylating the serine residues in histone H-1, myelin basic protein, and β-casein. This KFR1 activity is much higher in the bloodstream form of T. brucei than in the procyclic form, and it can be inactivated by a MAP kinase-specific phosphatase HVH2 in vitro. This activity in the bloodstream form can also be drastically reduced by serum starvation, which also arrests the cell growth. Several growth factors were tried to stimulate the KFR1 activity. Only interferon-γ strongly enhanced the KFR1 activity as well as the cell proliferation. The lower KFR1 activity in procyclic form was, however, unaffected by interferon-γ. Trypanosoma brucei bruceistrain 427 bloodstream-form cells (antigen variant clone MITat 1.4 (117)) were cultured in HMI-10 medium (17Hirumi H. Hirumi K. J. Parasitol. 1989; 75: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar), and the procyclic form cells were cultured in Cunningham's medium (18Cunningham I. J. Protozool. 1977; 24: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Inc., Atlanta, GA). Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain IH2725 (MAT a trp1 leu2 ura3 his4 can1 fus3::URA3 kss1::URA3) was from Dr. I. Herskowitz and cultured in YPD standard rich medium. Murine interferon-γ, recombinant human basic fibroblast growth factor, histone H-1, and myelin basic protein were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. β-Casein was from Sigma. Recombinant human PDGF B/B was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Yeast plasmids pRS314, pRS-FUS3, and pFus1-LacZ were from Dr. I. Herskowitz. pRS-FUS3 containsFUS3 gene in pRS314 under GAL1 promoter. pFus1-LacZ contains the Fus1-LacZ gene and theLEU2 gene (19Trueheart J. Boeke J.D. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1991; 56: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To clone KFR1 into pRS314 vector, BamHI and SalI sites were generated flanking the KFR1 (16Hua S.B. Wang C.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 54: 20-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primer B (5′-GAAGGATCCATGGTGTCGTTCAGCATC) and primer S (5′-GGAGGTCGACTATGGCTGAGCAACATTTC). The PCR-amplified fragment was inserted into vector pCR1000 (Invitrogen, La Jolla, CA). The nucleotide sequence of the KFR1 fragment was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The fragment was released byBamHI/SalI digestion and subsequently inserted into the BamHI/SalI site of pRS314, which is located downstream of GAL1 promoter. The plasmid thus constructed is named pRS-KFR1. S. cerevisiae strain IH2725 cells were transformed withSphI-linearized pFus1-LacZ and selected on a leucine-free plate for the stable transformants resulting in the strain SH101 (MAT a trp1 leu2 ura3 his4 can1 fus3::URA3 kss1::URA3 FUS1-LacZ). SH101 cells were then transformed with pRS314, pRS-FUS3, and pRS-KFR1, respectively. GAL1promoter was activated by dextrose-free SC medium containing 2% galactose, 0.5% sucrose, 2% glycerol, 1% raffinose, and tryptophan-free amino acid mixture. After a 1-h induction by α-factor, LacZ expression was monitored as described (19Trueheart J. Boeke J.D. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2316-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The KFR1 cDNA insert in pBluescript SK(−), designated pB-KFR1 (16Hua S.B. Wang C.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 54: 20-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), was amplified by PCR using the 5′ primer (5′-AAACCATATGGTGTCGTTCAGCATCGATG) and the T3 primer (5′-ATTAACCCTCACTAAAG). The PCR-amplified fragment was treated with Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and further digested withBamHI. The digested PCR fragment was inserted into the trypanosome overexpression vector, pTSA-HYG2 (21Sommer J.M. Peterson G. Keller G.A. Parsons M. Wang C.C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 316: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which had been treated with XhoI and Klenow and further withBamHI. The plasmid thus constructed was designated pTKH-Hyg. The orientation and nucleotide sequence of KFR1 in pTKH-Hyg were confirmed by sequencing. Expression of both KFR1 andhyg r is under the control of the PARP promoter, and there is a splicing signal site upstream of each open reading frame (22Sommer J.M. Cheng Q.L. Keller G.A. Wang C.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Purified plasmid DNA of pTKH-Hyg was linearized at theMluI site in the trypanosome tubulin intergenic region in the plasmid and transformed into procyclic T. brucei cells by electroporation (22Sommer J.M. Cheng Q.L. Keller G.A. Wang C.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). After stable transformants were selected with 50 μg/ml hygromycin B (Calbiochem), cell lines were cloned by limiting dilution (22Sommer J.M. Cheng Q.L. Keller G.A. Wang C.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Expression of KFR1 was examined at mRNA and protein levels by Northern hybridization and Western blotting, respectively, as described (16Hua S.B. Wang C.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 54: 20-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A DNA fragment containing the PARP promoter and hyg r was released from pTSA-HYG2 (21Sommer J.M. Peterson G. Keller G.A. Parsons M. Wang C.C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 316: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) by treating with SacI and T4 DNA polymerase and followed by BssHII. Likewise, a fragment containing the PARP promoter and neo r was released from pTSA-NEO2 (22Sommer J.M. Cheng Q.L. Keller G.A. Wang C.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) with SacI and T4 DNA polymerase and followed by a partial digestion of BssHII. Due to the presence ofBssHII site in the open reading frame ofneo r, only the fragment containing the completeneo r open reading frame was recovered from an agarose gel. The recovered DNA fragments, containinghyg r or neo r, were ligated into pB-KFR1 after SnaBI and BssHII digestion, which released a 250-base pair fragment at the center of theKFR1 open reading frame. Thus constructed plasmids were designated pNKH-Hyg and pNKH-Neo, respectively. Correct inserts were confirmed by restriction mapping. Purified plasmid DNA of pNKH-Hyg was digested with SspI and SacI and transformed into procyclic trypanosome cells by electroporation. Stable transformants were selected by hygromycin B, and cell lines were cloned as described above. Cell lines were examined by Southern hybridization. One allele of KFR1 gene in the T. brucei genome was successfully disrupted in all the cell lines examined. To disrupt the second allele of KFR1, one of the above cell lines was transformed with pNKH-Neo digested with SspI andSacI. The transformants were then selected under both hygromycin B (50 μg/ml) and G418 (50 μg/ml) (geneticin, Life Technologies, Inc.). Cell lines were then cloned and examined by genomic Southern hybridization after overnight digestion withPstI or BamHI as described previously (16Hua S.B. Wang C.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 54: 20-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). T. brucei cells (5 × 106 cells) were harvested by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min. Cells were lysed on ice for 1 h in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% sodium cholate, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 100 nm okadaic acid, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml chymostatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml phenanthroline, and 15 μg/ml benzamidine HCl). The lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was precleared with preimmune serum (16Hua S.B. Wang C.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 54: 20-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and Pansorbin (Calbiochem) essentially as described (23Hua S.B. Li X. Coffino P. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10264-10271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 24Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The precleared lysate was incubated with 40 μl of 50% protein-A beads (Zymed, Inc.) on ice for 1 h with shaking. KFR1 protein was then precipitated with 5 μl of protein-A beads cross-linked with rabbit antibody against the unique carboxyl-terminal region of KFR1 (16Hua S.B. Wang C.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 54: 20-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The antibody beads had been presaturated with 6% bovine serum albumin in lysis buffer. Alternatively, 5 μl of bovine serum albumin-saturated regular rabbit IgG beads (Zymed, Inc.) was used as controls in the immunoprecipitation. The immunocomplex was washed three times with lysis buffer, followed by two times in kinase assay buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μm ATP). The immunocomplex was then suspended in 10 μl of kinase assay buffer. Five micrograms of substrate protein and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Corp.) were added to the immunocomplex. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h, and the reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of SDS-PAGE loading solution (2% SDS, 65 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol) and immediately heated in a boiling water bath for 5 min. The phosphorylated substrates were subsequently separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon membrane (Millipore), and visualized by autoradiography. The radioactive bands were excised, and their radioactivities were quantitated by Cerenkov counting in a scintillation counter (Beckman). Phosphorylated substrate proteins (32P-labeled) were separated by SDS-PAGE, and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The phosphorylated substrate bands were visualized by autoradiography, excised, and hydrolyzed by constant boiling of HCl at 110 °C for 1.5 h. The phosphoamino acids were separated by electrophoresis at pH 3.5 on a TLC plate essentially as described (25Cooper J.A. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 387-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Plasmid pGEX-HVH2 was from Dr. K.-L. Guan. GST-HVH2 fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (26Guan K.L. Butch E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7197-7203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Proteins were quantitated by densitometry analysis of Coomassie R-250-stained SDS-PAGE gels using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Purified GST-HVH2 protein was mixed with immunoprecipitated KFR1 on protein-A beads (described above) in 20 μl of phosphatase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol) with occasional shaking at 37 °C for 60 min. After four washes with lysis buffer and two washes in kinase buffer, the kinase activity of GST-HVH2-treated KFR1 was determined by in vitro kinase assay described above. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated and analyzed by Northern blotting as described (16Hua S.B. Wang C.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 54: 20-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Immunostaining was performed as described previously (16Hua S.B. Wang C.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 54: 20-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Antibody against KFR1 was diluted 3,000-fold. The MAP kinase homologue KFR1 from T. brucei has a deduced amino acid sequence bearing over 40% identity to those ofKSS1/FUS3 (16Hua S.B. Wang C.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 54: 20-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To analyze whether KFR1 is a functional homologue of KSS1/FUS3 in S. cerevisiae, we used KFR1 to complement a yeastkss1/fus3 double mutant. It has been shown that the pheromone α-factor can activate FUS3/KSS1, and either KSS1 or FUS3 is sufficient to activate the expression of another gene FUS1(20Elion E.A. Brill J.A. Fink G.R. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1991; 56: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We therefore transformed KFR1 under the control ofGAL1 promoter into a yeast strain containing aFUS1-LacZ gene and a kss1/fus3 double mutation (see “Experimental Procedures”). After induction of KFR1 expression with galactose and treatment with α-factor, the yeast cells were assayed for β-galactosidase activity. As shown in Fig.1 A, KFR1 did not complementkss1/fus3 on FUS1-LacZ gene expression, even though KFR1 protein was successfully translated in the transformant and detected by Western blot using antibody against a unique carboxyl-terminal peptide of KFR1 protein, TbKH1 (16Hua S.B. Wang C.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 54: 20-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 B). In contrast, an introduced FUS3 gene could efficiently activate FUS1 expression. These results suggest that KFR1 is functionally distinct from KSS1 andFUS3. To further study the biological function ofKFR1, we overexpressed KFR1 in the procyclic form of T. brucei. The KFR1 cDNA was inserted into a trypanosome expression vector, pTSA-HYG2, and transfected into procyclic T. brucei cells (21Sommer J.M. Peterson G. Keller G.A. Parsons M. Wang C.C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 316: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Expression ofKFR1 and its downstream hyg r gene was controlled by the same constitutive PARP promoter and the polycistronic transcript processed by trans-splicing (27Agabian N. Cell. 1990; 61: 1157-1160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Stable transfectants were selected under hygromycin B and were subsequently cloned by limiting dilution (22Sommer J.M. Cheng Q.L. Keller G.A. Wang C.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Northern hybridizations indicated that the transfected KFR1 gene was successfully transcribed (Fig. 2 A). There are two species of the transcripts; the 1.3-kilobase species is of the same size as the wild type mRNA (16Hua S.B. Wang C.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 54: 20-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The 2.8-kilobase species is probably the unspliced polycistronic transcript of KFR1-hyg r, because both KFR1 and hyg r probes hybridized with the same band (Fig. 2,A and B). TheKFR1 transfectant has approximately a 20-fold higher level of KFR1 messenger RNA than those in the untransfected or vector-transfected T. brucei (Fig. 2 A). However, when the cell lysates were immunostained with the antibodies against TbKH1 (16Hua S.B. Wang C.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 54: 20-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), the KFR1 transfectant exhibited the same level of KFR1 protein as in the controls (Fig. 2 D). These results suggest that expression of KFR1 is post-transcriptionally regulated to maintain its protein at a fixed level in the transfected procyclic cells of trypanosome. KFR1 gene disruption experiments were also carried out.KFR1 is present as a single-copy gene in the diploidT. brucei genome (16Hua S.B. Wang C.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 54: 20-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Driven by a PARP promoter, eitherhyg r or neo r gene was inserted into the plasmid pB-KFR1 to replace a central portion of theKFR1 coding region resulting in pNKH-Hyg and pNKH-Neo, respectively (see “Experimental Procedures”). The pNKH-Hyg construct was electroporated into the procyclic T. bruceicells, and the transfected cells were selected under hygromycin B and subsequently cloned by limiting dilutions. Genomic Southern hybridizations showed that one allele of the KFR1 gene was successfully disrupted in all the cloned cell lines (data not shown). We then proceeded to disrupt the second allele of KFR1 gene in the diploid T. brucei. A cell line, with one allele of the KFR1 gene disrupted, was transfected with the pNKH-Neo construct. The transfected cells were selected under both hygromycin B and G418 and further cloned. Genomic Southern analysis revealed that all 18 cloned double drug-resistant cell lines still contained the intact second allele of KFR1 gene (data not shown), while the neo r gene was integrated into other loci in the T. brucei genome. The failure in disrupting the second allele of KFR1 gene cannot be attributed to theneo r gene because two alleles of theODC (ornithine decarboxylase) gene were successfully disrupted in T. brucei by using an identical strategy (28Li F. Hua S.-B. Wang C.C. Gottesdiener K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These results suggest that KFR1 gene is essential for growth of T. brucei procyclic cells. To assay for its kinase activity, KFR1 protein was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates (5 × 106 cells) of both bloodstream and procyclic forms of T. brucei using antibodies against the unique carboxyl-terminal peptide of KFR1 protein (16Hua S.B. Wang C.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 54: 20-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated protein was then assayed for phosphorylation of histone H-1, myelin basic protein, and β-casein, respectively, in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (29Hoshi M. Nishida E. Sakai H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 30Sanghera J.S. Paddon H.B. Bader S.A. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 52-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylated substrates were then separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. The results indicated that all three protein substrates were effectively phosphorylated (Fig. 3 A). The KFR1 from bloodstream cells has much higher specific activities than that from procyclic cells in these assays, even though the KFR1 protein levels in the bloodstream and procyclic form are about equal (16Hua S.B. Wang C.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 54: 20-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Densitometry analysis of the autoradiograms indicated that the former is approximately 4–10-fold higher than the latter. A dual specific phosphatase HVH2 has been reported to selectively dephosphorylate and inactivate MAP kinases, ERK1 and ERK2, from mammalian cells (26Guan K.L. Butch E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7197-7203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). KFR1 immunoprecipitated from 5 × 106 bloodstream cells was first treated with approximately 110 ng of the purified GST-HVH2 fusion protein from transformedE. coli for 1 h at 37 °C (26Guan K.L. Butch E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7197-7203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and then analyzed in the kinase assay. The KFR1 kinase activity was completely abolished by the HVH2 pretreatment, whereas the level of KFR1 protein was not changed by the treatment as demonstrated in the immunostains (Fig.3 B). Thus, like mammalian MAP kinases, the activity of KFR1 can be regulated by the status of phosphorylation with the phosphorylated KFR1 being the activated form. It is also possible that KFR1 is present in different states of phosphorylation in the bloodstream and procyclic forms. A major distinction between the bloodstream and procyclic forms of T. brucei is that the former propagates"

Cell. 1991; 66: 11-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and was the first such gene identified in mammals. The protein was originally identified from HeLa cells by its ability to bind tandemly repeated GT-IIC or Sph motifs from the Simian virus 40 (SV40) (2Davidson I. Xiao J.H. Rosales R. Staub A. Chambon P. Cell. 1988; 54: 931-942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 3Xiao J.H. Davidson I. Matthes H. Garnier J.M. Chambon P.

It was subsequently shown to bind the P97 promoter of human papilloma virus-16 and act in the regulation of transcription of the E6 and E7 oncogenes (4Ishiji T. Lace M.J. Parkkinen S. Anderson R.D.

Results from transfection and biochemical fractionation experiments showed that the transcriptional activation of TEF-1 requires co-operation between several domains of the molecule and is modulated by transcriptional intermediary factors (TIFs) as well as at least two negatively acting factors (5Chaudhary S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 3631-3637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The identity of these factors at present remains unknown. TEF-1 homologues have been identified in Drosophila, mouse, chick, Aspergillus, and yeast, and the TEA domains of these genes show a remarkable degree of conservation (7Mirabito P.M. Adams T.H.

Recent studies on the different mammalian TEFs suggest that these genes play partially overlapping roles in the development of the nervous system and musculature (13Chen Z. Friedrich G.A. Soriano P. Gene & Dev. 1994; 8: 2293-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 14Jacquemin P. Hwang J-J. Martial J.A. Dollé P. Davidson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21775-21785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The Drosophila homologue,scalloped, (sd), has also been shown to play roles in the development of the nervous system and musculature, and viable alleles show aberrations in their response to taste stimuli (15Inamdar M. VijayRaghavan K. Rodrigues V. J. Neurogenetics. 1993; 9: 123-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). 2A. Chopra, unpublished data. 2A. Chopra, unpublished data. In TEF-1, the TEA domain has been shown to be sufficient for specific DNA binding of GT-IIC and Sph enhancer sequences (16Hwang J. Chambon P. Davidson I. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2337-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This domain in Drosophila Sd, which differs from that of TEF-1 by a single amino acid, is incapable of binding these sequences. Furthermore, the Sd protein fails to transactivate these sequences in cell lines where the TEF-1 protein acts at high efficiency (16Hwang J. Chambon P. Davidson I. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2337-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Interestingly, conversion of the serine residue in the Sd TEA to alanine (the corresponding residue in TEF-1) did not confer binding ability similar to that of TEF-1. The altered Sd molecule could bind GT-IIC weakly and still failed to bind Sph enhancer sequences. Similarly, a mutation of alanine to serine in the TEF-1 TEA domain did not significantly alter its DNA binding properties. These observations together suggest that DNA binding in both TEF-1 and Sd molecules is modulated by regions outside the TEA domain. This conclusion is further strengthened by experiments in which deletions of the C-terminal domain of TEF-1 were found to reduce the DNA binding efficiency, thus leading to the identification of putative activation domains of TEF-1. The mechanisms by which the activation domains of TEF-1 influence DNA binding efficiency have not been investigated. The existence of a TEF-1 homologue in Drosophila raises the possibility of exploiting the rich repertoire of genetic information in the fly to the study of the regulation of the mammalian gene and the pathways in which it participates. In this paper, we use the wingblade phenotypes of sd mutants to show that TEF-1 can substitute for Sd in vivo. This observation allows the study of the role of TEF-1 in the context in which sd participates.sd along with several other genes, namely, engrailed (en), wingless (wg), hedgehog (hh), apterous (ap), Serrate (Ser), Notch (N), and vestigial (vg) plays an important role in the development of the wingblade (17Cohen S.M. Bate M. Martinez Arias A. The Development of Drosophila melanogaster. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1993: 747-843Google Scholar). 3M. Inamdar, unpublished data. 3M. Inamdar, unpublished data.The Drosophila wingblade is an excellent system for the study of how complex genetic hierarchies operate during development. The exquisite design of the wing of the fly allows for the facile identification of mutations that cause even subtle changes in its structure (18Waddington C.H. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1939; 25: 299-307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Vertebrate homologues of several of genes involved in wing development have now been identified, and it is becoming increasingly clear that despite several million years of evolutionary divergence between flies and mammals, molecular mechanisms fathomed from one system may not be too far removed from those occurring in another (19Scott M.P. Cell. 1994; 79: 1121-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 20Holland P. Ingham P. Krauss S. Nature. 1995; 358: 627-628Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Our observation that TEF-1 can function inDrosophila could provide a means by which the regulation of TEF-1 and its partners can be studied using a combination of genetics and biochemistry. All standard molecular biology procedures were performed as described in Sambrook et al. (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N. Y.1989Google Scholar). The full-length TEF-1 cDNA was kindly provided by Pierre Chambon and Irwin Davidson, CNRS, Inserm, Strasbourg, France. The pCaSpeR-hs plasmid was obtained from Vince Pirotta, University of Geneva. The hs-sd strain carries four copies of P(w + hs-sd) and was a kind gift from Sean Carroll, University of Wisconsin, Madison. The insertions in this strain were located on the second and third chromosomes, respectively. Flies carrying the transposase source P(δ 2–3ry +)Sb/TM2 P(δ 2–3ry +) Ubx were kindly provided by Hugh Robertson. Details about all marker and balancer strains can be obtained from Lindsley and Zimm (22Lindsley D. Zimm G. The Genome of Drosophila melanogaster. Academic Press Inc., San Diego, CA1992Google Scholar). The 1.2 kb TEF-1 cDNA was released from the PXJ40 plasmid by digestion withEcoRI and BglII and subcloned into the pCaSpeR-hs plasmid in frame with the Drosophilahsp70 promoter. The recombinant vector (Pw +hsTEF-1) was microinjected along with pπwc into w 1118embryos following protocols described by Rubin and Spradling (23Rubin G.M. Spradling A.C. Science. 1982; 218: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2303) Google Scholar). Germline transformants were selected by monitoring thew + marker in subsequent generations. One transgenic line (hs-TEF-1(3.1)) was obtained in which the insertion mapped on the third chromosome and allowed homozygous viability. The third chromosome insertion was mobilized by standard genetic crosses using the δ 2–3 transposase source to generate additional lines designated hs-TEF-1(2.1) and hs-TEF-1(2.6). Both these lines had insertions on the second chromosome, and the hs-TEF-1(2.1) insertion resulted in recessive lethality. All three lines were crossed again to a transposase source to generate lines in which the P element had been completely lost. The excision lines which were selected on the basis of their eye color and verified in Southern blots using 32P-labeled TEF-1 cDNA as a probe. Excision lines, in which the P(w +hs-TEF-1) had been precisely excised were served as controls for subsequent experiments. Polytene chromosomes were dissected from salivary glands of third instar larvae as described by Ashburner (24Ashburner M. Drosophila: A Laboratory Handbook. CSH Lab Press, U. S. A.1989Google Scholar) and probed with digoxygenin-labeled TEF-1 cDNA. Embryos from the hs-TEF-1(3.1) and w 1118 strains were collected 12 h after egg laying and were heat shocked in a water bath at 37 °C for 30 min. Total RNA was extracted as described in Ashburner (24Ashburner M. Drosophila: A Laboratory Handbook. CSH Lab Press, U. S. A.1989Google Scholar), separated on formaldehyde/agarose gels, and transferred to nylon membranes as described in Sambrook et al. (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N. Y.1989Google Scholar). Filters were probed using 32P-labeled TEF-1 cDNA and autoradiographed according to standard protocols. All flies to be analyzed were stored in 70% ethanol for at least 24 h prior to preparation. Wings were mounted in a drop of Faure's solution (34% v/v chloral hydrate, 13% v/v glycerol, 20 mg/ml gum arabic, and 0.3% cocaine chloralhydrate) and left at 70 °C overnight to clear. Larval imaginal wing discs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and stained using the chromogenic substrate X-gal according to the method described by Wilson et al.(25Wilson C. Pearson R.K. Bellen H.J. O'Kane C.J. Grossniklaus U. Gehring W.J. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 1301-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Stained discs were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and mounted on slides with geltol. The sd locus encodes at least three different transcripts which arise by alternative splicing of an approximately 12 kb transcription unit. The cDNA clone designated E21 corresponds to one of the transcripts and shares striking similarity with the sequence of TEF-1 (10Campbell S. Inamdar M. Rodrigues V. VijayRaghavan K. Palazzolo M. Chovnick A. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 26Campbell S.R. Duttaroy A. Katzen A.L. Chovnick A. Genetics. 1991; 127: 367-380PubMed Google Scholar). In Fig. 1, we have presented a comparison between Sd and the mammalian TEF-1-like genes containing the TEA domains that have been recently identified by Jacquemin et al. (14Jacquemin P. Hwang J-J. Martial J.A. Dollé P. Davidson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21775-21785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The conceptual amino acid sequences encoded by the transcripts are 98% identical in the TEA domain with a single amino acid difference. The similarity in the rest of the molecule is over several relatively small stretches. The region between amino acids 160 and 249 of Sd has no homology with TEF-1. Gel retardation and reporter assays measuring the binding abilities of Sd and TEF-1 suggested that these molecules do not share common binding properties in vitro (16Hwang J. Chambon P. Davidson I. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2337-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In an effort to test whether human TEF-1 could substitute for Sd in vivo, we transformedw 1118 embryos with a vector containing the full-length TEF-1 cDNA downstream of the Drosophilahsp70 promoter. The original P(w + hs-TEF-1) line (3.1) obtained from the transformation experiment carries two insertions at 68F and 90E on the third chromosome. Two further lines were generated from this by mobilization of the P element to new chromosomal positions. We designate these lines that had insertions at 51C and at 30F/31A as hs-TEF-1(2.1) and hs-TEF-1(2.6), respectively. We showed that TEF-1 mRNA was transcribed inDrosophila under control of the hsp70 promoter. Embryos homozygous for hs-TEF-1(3.1) were heat shocked at 37 °C for 1 h, and the mRNA was probed on Northern blots for the presence of TEF-1 transcripts. There was no endogenous TEF-1-like expression in control embryos while the hs-TEF-1 animals showed high levels of TEF-1 transcripts (data not shown). High levels of TEF expression induced by heat shock resulted in variable levels of lethality throughout embryonic life. The extent of lethality observed was dependent upon the stage during embryogenesis when the temperature pulse was given. Previous studies using an enhancer trap allele of sd showed that the native expression of the sd gene was first detected at about stage 9 of embryonic development (10Campbell S. Inamdar M. Rodrigues V. VijayRaghavan K. Palazzolo M. Chovnick A. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Overexpression of TEF in the larval stages did not lead to significant lethality, but pupal pulses caused a high degree of lethality. Survivors that had experienced embryonic or pupal pulses did not, however, show any phenotypic defects typical ofsd mutations. The production of lethality when TEF-1 was induced during embryonic and/or pupal life correlates well with the observation that all lethal alleles of sd die either during embryonic or the pupal stage. Most viable alleles at the sd locus show defects in wingblade development, resulting in a gapped or eroded appearance on the anterior and lateral margin (24Ashburner M. Drosophila: A Laboratory Handbook. CSH Lab Press, U. S. A.1989Google Scholar). The extent of this phenotype is easy to quantitate and thus provides an attractive system by which we could monitor the functioning of TEF-1 in the animal. We chose the enhancer trap allelesd P(ry+ETX4) (henceforth called as sd ETX4) as our assay system because of its relatively high expressivity of the wingblade phenotype (Fig.2 B). sd ETX4 carries an insertion of a P(lacZ ry +) element within the first intron of the transcription unit (10Campbell S. Inamdar M. Rodrigues V. VijayRaghavan K. Palazzolo M. Chovnick A. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 27Anand A. Fernandes J. Arunan M.C. Bhosekar S. Chopra A. Dedhia N. Sequiera K. Hasan G. Palazzolo M.J. VijayRaghavan K. Rodrigues V. J. Genet. 1990; 69: 151-168Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Genetic analysis suggests that sd ETX4 is a partial loss-of-function allele since the phenotype in trans with a deficiency of the sd region is significantly more severe than that of the homozygous insertion strain (10Campbell S. Inamdar M. Rodrigues V. VijayRaghavan K. Palazzolo M. Chovnick A. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 15Inamdar M. VijayRaghavan K. Rodrigues V. J. Neurogenetics. 1993; 9: 123-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Males from the transgenic lines were crossed to females homozygous forsd ETX4 and reared at 25 °C. The rescue of the wingblade defects in sd ETX4 was scored in the male progeny. The wing defects observed were scored on an arbitrary scale of −1 to −5 where −5 denotes the strongest mutant phenotype and + indicates wild-type wings (Fig. 2 A). Insd ETX4 males, approximately 80% of the animals had wings corresponding to −3 (Fig. 2 B). We compared the efficiency of different hs-TEF-1 bearing strains with that of hs-sd in rescuing the wingblade phenotypes in partial loss-of-function mutants. When sd ETX4 was crossed to either the hs-sd or hs-TEF-1 transformants, the phenotype of the progeny was shifted significantly toward the wild-type (Fig. 2,C–E). 36% of sd ETX4 carrying a single copy of the hs-TEF-1(2.1) transgene had completely normal wingblades; normal wings were never observed in the mutant strain in the absence of hs-TEF-1. While two copies of the hs-sdtransformant significantly reduced the severity of the phenotype (Fig.2 C), four copies led to completely wild-type wings (data not shown). Of the three hs-TEF transformants that we used in this study, hs-TEF(2.1) was most effective at rescuing the wingblade phenotypes ofsd ETX4 (Fig. 2, D compared withE, data from hs-TEF(2.6) is comparable to hs-TEF(3.1)). This is in spite of the fact that the 3.1 line had two insertions of the hs-TEF-1 insertion on the chromosome. The hs-TEF(2.1) strain was also more efficient at rescuing the wingblade phenotype than the hs-sd transgenic. These differences could arise from positional influences on the regulation of genes inserted in different positions on the chromosome. These data demonstrate that the expression of TEF-1 in flies leads to a striking rescue of the wingblade phenotype of sd mutants. A rescue of the sd mutant phenotype would also have been obtained if the insertion of the transposon resulted in mutations that could act as extragenic suppressors of sd mutation. If the rescue of the sd phenotype was indeed due to the expression of TEF-1, then, aberrations in the TEF-1 sequence within the transposon induced by imprecise excision would result in a loss of “rescue.” We generated lines in which the P(w +, hs-TEF-1) insertion was “excised” under the influence of transposase activity. Excision events were monitored by following thew + marker on the transposon, and the chromosomes were analyzed on Southern blots using labeled TEF-1 cDNA as a probe. Lines in which no TEF-1 hybridization was detected were taken as complete excisions; and those in which hybridization was detected, but the restriction pattern had changed compared with the original line, were identified as events in which the P(w +, TEF-1) was incompletely excised (data not shown). In the latter case, while some part of the transposon was still present, the TEF-1 gene would not be normally expressed. Several representative lines of both “complete” and “incomplete” excision events were crossed intosd ETX4 backgrounds, and the phenotype of the wings of the progeny were observed. In both cases, the phenotype was not significantly altered from that of sd ETX4, indicating that the expression of an intact TEF-1 sequence, and not merely the presence of an insertion into certain loci, was required for the rescue of the sd mutant wingblade defects (Fig. 2,F and G). While weak (partial loss-of-function) alleles ofsd show defects in the wingblade, strong mutants show embryonic or pupal lethality. The cause of lethality in embryonic lethal alleles is not clear although sd +function has been implicated in axonal guidance as well as muscle development.2 In these roles, Sd presumably participates in a genetic pathway distinct from that involved in wingblade development. We tested whether TEF-1 could substitute for sd in this cellular context as well.sd P(ry+ETX81) (henceforth called sd ETX81) dies in mid-pupation; genomic analysis revealed the presence of two insertions, one in the 5′ intron before the translational start site and a second within a 2-kb region located toward the 3′ end of the gene (26Campbell S.R. Duttaroy A. Katzen A.L. Chovnick A. Genetics. 1991; 127: 367-380PubMed Google Scholar).2 Most of the lethal lesions in sd map to the latter interval (10Campbell S. Inamdar M. Rodrigues V. VijayRaghavan K. Palazzolo M. Chovnick A. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Progeny of crosses of sd ETX81 with the hs-TEF-1 and hs-sd transformants were reared at 30 °C, and the progeny were scored (Table I). Growth at 28 °C produced a smaller number of surviving males than at 30 °C. The viable mutant animals emerging from the crosses with the hs-sd and hs-TEF-1 transgenes still showed defects in wing morphology. This could mean that the levels and/or timings of sd/TEF-1 expression generated by the hsp70 promoter was insufficient to rescue the wingblade phenotypes even though this expression could rescue lethality. This explanation also applies to the roughened eye and maxillary palp phenotypes observed in sd ETX81, hs-TEF-1/+ and sd ETX81, and hs-sd/+ survivors. The pattern of β-galactosidase activity in the developing compound eye and maxillary palp analage in the enhancer trap linesd ETX4 suggests that sd + is expressed in these regions (10Campbell S. Inamdar M. Rodrigues V. VijayRaghavan K. Palazzolo M. Chovnick A. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The number of non-FM7 males emerging from the cross ofsd ETX81/FM7 with the hs-TEF-1 males were counted and expressed as a percentage of the number of FM7 males. Each data point is based on the observation of at least 400 progeny from the cross.exc., excision. Both sd ETX4 andsd ETX81 are alleles of sd generated by insertion of a P(ry + lacZ) transposon and express β-galactosidase in the wing disc (27Anand A. Fernandes J. Arunan M.C. Bhosekar S. Chopra A. Dedhia N. Sequiera K. Hasan G. Palazzolo M.J. VijayRaghavan K. Rodrigues V. J. Genet. 1990; 69: 151-168Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Insd ETX4, the domain of β-galactosidase expression in the third instar wing discs parallels that of the mRNA expression seen in whole mount RNA in situ using sdE21 as a probe (10Campbell S. Inamdar M. Rodrigues V. VijayRaghavan K. Palazzolo M. Chovnick A. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).2 We could neither detect Sd mRNA, nor any β-galactosidase reporter activity in the wing discs ofsd ETX81 hemizygous male larvae (Fig.3 A). The discs ofsd ETX81/+ heterozygous females, on the other hand, showed some staining in the third larval instar discs (Fig.3 B). The domain of expression was, however, significantly reduced over that seen in sd ETX4/+ (10Campbell S. Inamdar M. Rodrigues V. VijayRaghavan K. Palazzolo M. Chovnick A. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Insd ETX81/+, reporter enzyme expression was restricted to the dorsal/ventral boundary of the putative wing wheresd + expression is maximal.3 It is unlikely that this restricted pattern is due to an absence of precursors in the wing pouch region that would normally stain sincesd ETX81/+ adult wingblades are completely normal in morphology. These results together suggest thatsd + activity is required for driving reporter activity. Hence in sd ETX4, a partial loss-of-function allele, the reporter activity more closely resembles the native gene expression than in the null allele (sd ETX81) in trans with a wild-type chromosome. The lack of staining in sd ETX81 males can thus be explained by an absence of sd +activity. We tested whether reporter enzyme activity could be enhanced by ectopic expression of Sd or TEF-1 using the hs-sd or hs-TEF-1 transgenes. β-Galactosidase activity was observed in wing discs ofsd ETX81 males carrying either hs-sd or any of the hs-TEF-1 insertions (arrowheads in Fig. 3,D and F). Interestingly, the effect observed with hs-TEF-1(2.1) was significantly greater than with hs-sd, and β-galactosidase staining was observed outside the expected wingpouch region (arrowheads in Fig. 3 F). Insd ETX81/+, the intensity as well as the domain of expression were enhanced by sd (Fig. 3 E), as well as TEF-1 expression (data not shown). The ability of the hs-TEF-1 and hs-sd transgenes to induce reporter activity suggests that the sd locus is autoregulated. Ectopic expression ofsd/TEF-1 under a heat-shock promoter, interestingly, did not result in ubiquitous reporter enzyme activity, but this was restricted mainly to the wingblade region of the discs. This observation suggests that sd/TEF-1 may be necessary, but not sufficient, to drivesd activity, thus implicating the existence of other tissue specific factors. We have shown that human TEF-1 can substitute for Sd in several different contexts during Drosophila development. Expression of this gene in Drosophila under control of the hsp70 promoter rescues the wingblade defects as well as the lethality seen in different sd mutations. Furthermore, TEF-1 functions as effectively as Sd in promoting expression of a sd reporter in the developing wing imaginal disc. Does TEF-1 protein interact with the same molecular targets as Sd when expressed in the fly? Data from biochemical experiments suggested that Sd and TEF-1 have different DNA binding capabilities and that the activation domains of the molecules resided outside the highly conserved TEA domains. The demonstration that TEF-1 can adopt most of the pleiotropic roles of Sd suggests that both molecules are capable of similar functions. sd plays an important role in establishing the dorso-ventral patterning in the developing wingblade (28Williams J.A. Paddock S.W. Vorwerk K. Carroll S.B. Nature. 1994; 368: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar).3 Cells in the dorsal compartment of the disc are selected through the expression ofap which in turn activates fringe (fr) and Ser in these cells. Ser, which encodes a ligand for the N receptor induces the expression ofwg in the ventral cells (17Cohen S.M. Bate M. Martinez Arias A. The Development of Drosophila melanogaster. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1993: 747-843Google Scholar). sd is classified as a pro-wing gene and, like vg, has an expression pattern that straddles the D/V boundary; vg has recently been shown to be necessary and sufficient for the generation of wings inDrosophila (29Kim J. Sebring A. Esch J.J. Kraus M.E. Vorwerk K. Mager J. Carroll S.B. Nature. 1996; 382: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). It is intriguing that TEF-1, a protein with only 68% homology, can participate in the complex interactions involved in wingblade development as efficiently as itsDrosophila homologue. Recently other TEA domain-containing genes were identified in vertebrates that were similar to TEF-1 (14Jacquemin P. Hwang J-J. Martial J.A. Dollé P. Davidson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21775-21785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Alignment of the amino acid sequences of various TEFs (TEF-1, TEF-3, and TEF-4) showed that the TEA domains were identical in all of them, and 200 amino acids in the C domain were well conserved. In contrast, the N-terminal regions of all TEFs and the region immediately following the TEA domain showed a considerable degree of divergence. In Drosophila, the complexity of expression and the pleiotropic effects of sd mutations suggests a role for the different alternatively spliced variants from the locus. In addition, preliminary evidence does exist for the existence of additional genes with some resemblance to sd in the Drosophilagenome.3 The biological function of TEF-1 is still unclear. The expression pattern is relatively widespread, and the results from mouse knockout experiments are difficult to interpret possibly due to redundancies of function (13Chen Z. Friedrich G.A. Soriano P. Gene & Dev. 1994; 8: 2293-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Studies of TEF-1 function in flies is a promising means by which to decipher its biological role. We are in the process of generating transgenic flies with other TEF-2 and TEF-4 genes along with chimeras of the activation domains and DNA binding domains and hope that this will contribute to a better understanding of the evolution and functions of the TEA domain family. Many of the experiments mentioned in this paper were carried out in collaboration with K. VijayRaghavan. We are grateful to him for this and for discussions and advice throughout this work. We are indebted to Pierre Chambon and Irwin Davidson for providing the TEF-1 cDNA clone and Sean Carroll for sending the hs-sd transformant strain even before its publication. We are grateful to the referees for perceptive comments that helped improve the previous manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2087674894,"A 35-nucleotide sequence in the liver fatty acid-binding protein gene (Fabpl) has been identified that interacts with nuclear proteins present in adult mouse liver, kidney, stomach, small intestine, and colon. The binding site consists of a direct heptad repeat (TTCTGNNTT) separated by five nucleotides. Both heptads are required for formation of stable complexes with nuclear proteins in gel mobility shift assays. Thein vivo functions mediated by the repeats were determined by comparing the expression of four Fabpl/human growth hormone fusion genes in multiple pedigrees of adult transgenic mice. The transgenes contained (i) nucleotides −596 to +21 ofFabpl linked to the human growth hormone reporter, (ii) 4 additional copies of the 35-base pair element placed at nucleotide −596 of Fabpl, (iii) 4 additional copies of the sequence placed just upstream of its endogenous site at nucleotide −132, and (iv) a sequence identical to (iii) but with all heptad repeats mutated within each of the 4 additional copies of the 35-base pair element. Transgene expression was defined by RNA blot hybridizations and by light and electron microscopic immunohistochemistry. The heptad repeat functions to suppress expression in tubular epithelial cells of the proximal nephron, in hepatocytes, in the mucus-producing pit cells of the gastric epithelium, and in absorptive enterocytes located in the proximal small intestine. There is a gradient of escape from enterocytic suppression as one moves from the proximal to distal small intestine. This escape progresses to involve successively less differentiated cells located closer and closer to the stem cell zone in crypts of Lieberkühn. The heptad repeat activates gene expression in the colonic epithelium so that all proliferating and nonproliferating cells in colonic crypts distributed from the cecum to the rectum support transgene expression. The heptad has no obvious sequence similarities to known transcription factor binding sites, suggesting that mediators of its in vivo activities are likely to be novel. One candidate factor is a 90-kDa protein identified in Southwestern blots. The 90-kDa protein also binds to an element in the matrix metalloproteinase-2 gene that functions as an enhancer in renal cells, shares sequence homology with the heptad, and generates similar-sized complexes in gel mobility shift assays as theFabpl repeat. The heptad repeat represents a target for identifying transcription factors that regulate gene expression between gut and renal epithelia and that also regulate the differentiation program of the intestine's principal epithelial lineage as a function of its location along the duodenal-colonic axis. Finally, theFabpl regulatory elements described in this report should be useful for delivering a variety of gene products throughout the colonic epithelium of transgenic mice.

Finally, theFabpl regulatory elements described in this report should be useful for delivering a variety of gene products throughout the colonic epithelium of transgenic mice. Epithelial cells that line the intestine and the nephrons of the kidney share many common functions. The molecular mechanisms that regulate gene transcription within and between these epithelia are largely uncharacterized. The “liver” fatty acid-binding protein gene (Fabpl) 1The abbreviations used are: Fabpl, liver fatty acid-binding protein gene; L-FABP, liver fatty acid-binding protein; GMSA, gel mobility shift assay; hGH, human growth hormone; MMP-2, matrix metalloproteinase-2 gene; DAB, 3′,3′-diaminobenzidine;Fabpi, intestinal fatty acid- binding protein gene; BrdUrd, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; oligos, oligodeoxynucleotides; bp, base pair(s). 1The abbreviations used are: Fabpl, liver fatty acid-binding protein gene; L-FABP, liver fatty acid-binding protein; GMSA, gel mobility shift assay; hGH, human growth hormone; MMP-2, matrix metalloproteinase-2 gene; DAB, 3′,3′-diaminobenzidine;Fabpi, intestinal fatty acid- binding protein gene; BrdUrd, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; oligos, oligodeoxynucleotides; bp, base pair(s). provides a model for investigating these mechanisms.In the adult mouse and rat, Fabpl is transcribed in hepatocytes and in polarized absorptive enterocytes, the principal epithelial cell lineage of the small intestine (1Simon T.C. Roth K.A. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18345-18358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fabplexhibits a cephalocaudal gradient of expression within the intestine; highest levels of its mRNA and protein products are encountered in differentiated enterocytes that overlie villi located in the middle third of the small intestine; levels diminish as one moves proximally or distally. The gene is silent in the gastric and distal colonic epithelium of both species and in all other epithelia not associated with the gastrointestinal tract.The contribution of cis-acting suppressors to maintaining this pattern of expression was revealed from studies in transgenic mice (1Simon T.C. Roth K.A. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18345-18358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Seven fusion genes were produced by sequential deletions of the proximal 4000 nucleotides of rat Fabpl's 5′-nontranscribed domain and linkage of each truncated product to nucleotides +3 to +2150 of the human growth hormone (hGH) gene. The cellular and spatial patterns of expression of each fusion gene were defined in multiple pedigrees of adult transgenic mice. Cis-acting suppressors of cecal and colonic transcription were identified between nucleotides −4000 and −1600. Suppressors of gastric expression are positioned outside of nucleotides −4000 to +21. Multiple suppressor elements, distributed between nucleotides −4000 and +21, help determine the intestinal epithelial cell lineage-specific patterns of Fabpl expression (1Simon T.C. Roth K.A. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18345-18358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).A suppressor of kidney expression was also found. Although the endogenous gene remains silent in the mouse and rat kidney throughout adulthood, analyses of transgenic mice containing nucleotides −132 to +21 of Fabpl revealed that the steady state concentration of the hGH reporter mRNA was 10 times higher in kidney than in the four other tissues where it was expressed (1Simon T.C. Roth K.A. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18345-18358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Renal expression of hGH was confined to epithelial cells located in the proximal tubules of nephrons. The relative levels of hGH mRNA in the other tissues were small intestine > colon > stomach = liver. Addition of a 54-bp sequence spanning nucleotides −186 to −133 suppressed kidney hGH expression 40-fold relative to these four other tissues (1Simon T.C. Roth K.A. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18345-18358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In the present report, we have determined that this 54-bp element contains a direct heptad repeat that binds nuclear proteins from kidney, small intestine, colon, and liver. The transcriptional regulatory activities of this repeat in kidney and gut epithelial cell lineages have been defined using transgenic mice. The results indicate that the heptad sequence binds novel transcription factors that modulate gene expression within and between different epithelia.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of Nuclear ExtractsNuclear extracts were prepared from tissues harvested from 6- to 20-week-old male or female FVB/N mice. The entire extraction protocol was performed at 4 °C. The distal half of the small intestine was removed immediately after sacrifice, clamped at one end, infused with buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 15 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2) supplemented with protease inhibitors (2 mm Pefabloc SC, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 0.3 μm aprotinin, 130 μm bestatin) until it became distended, then opened with a longitudinal incision, placed in 20 ml of buffer A, and shaken for ∼5 s. The washed segment was transferred to fresh buffer A and shaken again. The cycle was repeated three times. Luminal contents were manually extruded from the intact colon prior to preparation of nuclear extracts. All other tissues were placed directly in buffer A.A Polytron (Tekmar) was used to disrupt each tissue (five 7-s bursts at full speed). The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 750 ×g. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of buffer A plus Nonidet P-40 (0.25%, v/v). Following a 1-min incubation, the suspension was centrifuged as above, and the nuclear pellet was resuspended to a final volume of 10 ml in buffer B (10% glycerol, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mmEDTA, plus the protease inhibitors listed above). Ammonium sulfate was added (1 ml of a 3 m solution). The suspension was shaken for 30 min to lyse nuclei and subsequently spun at 123,000 ×g for 60 min to pellet chromatin. An equal volume of 3m ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant, and the solution was shaken for 30 min to precipitate nuclear proteins. After centrifugation at 123,000 × g for 30 min, the protein pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of buffer C (10% glycerol, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mmEDTA, 1 mm DTT) and desalted by passage through a Biospin 6GD Sephadex G25 column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in buffer C. Ten-microliter aliquots of the column effluent were snap-frozen in liquid N2 and stored under liquid N2 until use. The protein content of each extract was determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit.The integrity of nuclear proteins was verified using a gel mobility shift assay (GMSA) with a template consisting of an orphan steroid hormone receptor binding site. This previously characterized element (5′-TCTCTTGAACTTTGAACTTCCACA-3′) was derived from nucleotides −86 to −63 of the rat intestinal fatty acid-binding protein gene promoter (Fabpi) (2Sweetser D.A. Birkenmeier E.H. Klisak I.J. Zollman S. Sparkes R.S. Mohandas T. Lusis A.J. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16060-16071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Rottman J.N. Gordon J.I. J.

Oligos were end-labeled with 33P using polynucleotide kinase (Boehringer Mannheim). Each gel shift reaction (total volume = 20 μl) contained 12.5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 40 mmKCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 7.5% glycerol (w/v), 33P-labeled probe (50 fmol), poly(dI·dC) (6 ng, Boehringer Mannheim), herring sperm DNA (6 ng, Sigma), and nuclear extract (50–8000 ng protein). Following a 20-min incubation at room temperature, the reaction was terminated by subjecting the mixture to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (5% of 29:1 acrylamide:N,N′-methylene-bisacrylamide in 45 mm Tris borate buffer, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). All GMSA assays were performed at least twice and with at least two independent preparations of tissue nuclear protein extracts.Southwestern BlotsNuclear extracts (80 μg of protein/tissue) were fractionated by electrophoresis through 7% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS according to the protocol described in Ausubel et al. (4Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.

Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to supported nitrocellulose membranes (Life Technologies, Inc.). Triplicate blots were preincubated for 30 min at 4 °C in 5% Blotto (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 μg/ml sheared herring sperm DNA, and 5% nonfat dry milk (w/v)) followed by a 60-min incubation at the same temperature in 0.5% Blotto. Each blot was probed with one of three concatenated32P-labeled double-stranded oligos: (i) 5′-ACAAACTTCTGCCTTGCCCATTCTGATTTTTATCG-3′ (nucleotides −167 to −133 of rat Fabpl); (ii) 5′-ACAAACggagtCCggGCCCAggagtATggTTATCG-3′ (identical to (i) but with mutated bases indicated in lowercase); and (iii) 5′-AGTGGGTTTCTGACAAGTTCAGACTTGCCCAGCAG-3′ (nucleotides −1319 to −1285 of the rat matrix metalloproteinase 2 gene; Ref. 5Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Mertens P.R. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18786-18796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Concatenation was accomplished using the Rapid Ligation kit from Boehringer Mannheim and 40 pmol of the double-stranded oligo per 20-μl reaction. The specific activity of each double-stranded oligo was identical (6000 Ci/mmol). The entire reaction mixture was added to 5 ml of hybridization buffer (0.5% Blotto). Following an overnight incubation with the concatenated probe at 4 °C, blots were washed in 0.5% Blotto for 5 min and then in a solution containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA (3 washes of 5 min, each wash done at 4 °C). DNA-protein complexes were visualized using a storage PhosphorImaging system (Molecular Dynamics).Generation of Transgenic MiceConstruction of Fabpl/hGH Fusion GenesThree recombinant DNAs were produced. Fabpl 4× at −596/hGH was created as follows. A BamHI/EcoRI fragment spanning nucleotides −596 to +21 of Fabpl was liberated from pEPLFABP (6Sweetser D.A. Birkenmeier E.H. Hoppe P.C. McKeel D.W. Gordon J.I. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1318-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and ligated toBamHI/EcoRI-digested pBluescript II SK+ (Stratagene), yielding pTS9. Nucleotides +3 to +2150 of hGH were removed from pBShGH (1Simon T.C. Roth K.A. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18345-18358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with BamHI and ligated toBamHI-digested pTS9. pTS10 was identified by diagnostic restriction digests as a ligation product with the 5′ end of the hGH gene joined to the 3′ end of the Fabpl sequence. Two pairs of complementary synthetic oligos were phosphorylated and annealed to one another. 5′­CGATTTAGAACAAACTTCTG¯CCTT¯GCCCATTCTG¯ATTT¯TTATCGTTA­ 3′­TAAATCTTGTTTGAAGACGGAACGGGTAAGACTAAAAATAGCAAT­ GAACAAACTTCTG¯CCTT¯GCCCATTCTG¯ATTT¯TTATCGTTAGA­3' CTTGTTTGAAGACGGAACGGGTAAGACTAAAA­5' OLIGO1 5′­ACAAACTTCTG¯CCTT¯GCCCATTCTG¯ATTT¯TTATCGTT­ 3'­ATAGCAATCTTGTTTGAAGACGGAACGGGTAAGACTAAAAATAGCAA­ AGAACAAACTTCTG¯CCTT¯GCCCATT¯CTG¯ATTT¯TTATCGG­3' TCTTGTTTGAAGACGGAACGGGTAAGACTAAAAATAGCCTTAA­5' OLIGO2Double-stranded oligo 1 was synthesized so one end would be compatible for ligation to ClaI-digested DNA and the other end would contain a 10-base overhang compatible for ligation with double-stranded oligo 2. Oligo 2 was synthesized so that one end would be compatible for ligation with oligo 1 and the other end compatible for ligation with EcoRI-digested DNA. These two double-stranded oligos each contain two copies of Fabplnucleotides −172 to −133. Each copy, in turn, contains two copies of the heptad sequence underlined above. Both oligos were simultaneously ligated toClaI/EcoRI-digested pTS10, producing pTS5. pTS5 contains nucleotides −596 to +21 of Fabplwith four tandem repeats of nucleotides −172 to −133 added at Fabplnucleotide −596 (Fabpl 4× at −596/hGH). Sequence analysis verified this arrangement.Fabpl 4× at −596/hGH was liberated from pTS5 by SalI/XmnI digestion.A similar strategy was used to create a second fusion gene,Fabpl 4× at −132/hGH, which contains four tandem copies of the same sequence as inFabpl 4× at −596/hGH (i.e.nucleotides −172 to −133) but inserted at Fabpl nucleotide −132. 5′­AAATTAGAACAAACTTCTG¯CCTT¯GCCCATTCTG¯ATTT¯TTATCGTTAGA­ 3′­TTTAATCTTGTTTGAAGACGGAACGGGTAAGACTAAAAATAGCAATCT­ ACAAACTTCTG¯CCTT¯GCCCATTCTG¯ATTT¯TTATCGTTAGA­3′ TGTTTGAAGACGGAACGGGTAAGACTAAAA­5′ OLIGO3 5′­ACAAACTTCTG¯CCTT¯GCCCATTCTG¯ATTT¯TTATCGTT­ 3′­ATAGCAATCTTGTTTGAAGACGGAACGGGTAAGACTAAAAATAGCAA­ AGAACAAACTTCTG¯CCTT¯GCCCATTCTG¯ATTT¯TGATT­3′ TCTTGTTTGAAGACGGAACGGGTAAGACTAAAACTAA­5′ OLIGO4Double-stranded oligo 3 was synthesized so that one end would be compatible for ligation to BsaBI-digested DNA and the other end would contain a 10-base overhang compatible for ligation to double-stranded oligo 4. Double-stranded oligo 4 was synthesized so one end would be compatible for ligation to oligo 3 and the other end to BsaBI-digested DNA. Oligos 3 and 4 andBsaBI-digested pTS10 were incubated with T4 DNA ligase, yielding pTS4 (Fabpl 4× at −132/hGH). Sequence analysis verified the correct positioning of the tandem repeats. Fabpl 4× at −132/hGH was then liberated from pTS4 vector sequences byEcoRI/XmnI digestion.The same strategy used to createFabpl 4× at −132/hGH was exploited to generate the third fusion gene,Fabpl 4× mutated at −132/hGH, which contains nucleotides −596 to +21 of Fabplwith four tandem repeats added at Fabplnucleotide −132. These repeats were mutated copies of nucleotides −172 to −133, where each purine in each heptad repeat was replaced with a pyrimidine from the opposite base pair and vice versa. 5′­AAATTAGAACAAACggagtCCggGCCCAggagtATggTTATCGTTAG­ 3′­TTTAATCTTGTTTGCCTCAGGCCCGGGTCCTCATACCAATAGCAATC­ AACAAACggagtCCggGCCCAggagtATggTTATCGTTAGA­3′ TTGTTTGCCTCAGGCCCGGGTCCTCATACCA­5′ OLIGO5 5′­ACAAACggagtCCggGCCCAggagtATggTTATCGTT­ 3′­ATAGCAATCTTGTTTGCCTCAGGCCCGGGTCCTCATACCAATAGCAA­ AGAACAAACggagtCCggGCCCAggagtATggTGATT­3′ TCTTGTTTGCCTCAGGCCCGGGTCCTCATACCACTAA­5′ OLIGO6The resulting plasmid containingFabpl 4× mutated at −132/hGH was designated pTS14 and its insert excised with EcoRI/XmnI.DNA fragments containing the three fusion genes were each purified from their vector sequences by agarose gel electrophoresis, extracted from the gel using the Qiaex system (Qiagen), and then used for pronuclear injection into fertilized FVB/N oocytes (7Taketo M.

Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986: 79-187Google Scholar).Identification and Housing of Transgenic AnimalsLive-born animals were screened at 10 days of age for the presence of transgenes using the following protocol. DNA was isolated from 1-cm tail snips after an overnight digestion at 55 °C in 0.4 ml of digestion buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K (Boehringer Mannheim)). Following phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the DNA pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of water (typical yield of DNA = 50–100 μg). Polymerase chain reaction was performed in 20-μl incubations containing 50 mm KCl, 20 mmTris, pH 8.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 3% glycerol, 10 μm cresol red, dNTPs (200 μm each), 0.5 unit of AmpliTaq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer), 100–500 ng of tail DNA, and primers that recognize hGH and mouse α-actin gene sequences (0.8 pmol of each). The hGH primers (5′-AGGTGGCCTTTGACACCTACCAGG-3′ and 5′-TCTGTTGTGTTTCCTCCCTGTTGG-3′) span intron 2 and produce a 360-bp product. The α-actin primers (5′-CACCACACCTTCTACAATGAGCTG-3′ and 5′-TCATCAGGTAGTCAGTGAGGTCGC-3′) span intron 3 and produce a 451-bp product. The reaction mixture was overlaid with wax (Chill-Out 14, MJ Research), and subjected to 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 55 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C.Pedigrees from transgenic founder animals were established and maintained by crosses to non-transgenic FVB/N littermates. Serum hGH levels were measured by radioimmunoassay (Nichols Diagnostic). Pedigrees with high serum levels of hGH (>1 μg/ml) had to be maintained by ovarian transplantation (9Brem G. Baunack E. Muller M. Winnacker E.L. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1990; 25: 42-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). All mice were housed in microisolators on a 12-h light/dark cycle and given an irradiated diet (Pico rodent chow 20, PMI Feeds) ad libitum. Mice were determined to be specific pathogen-free based on the results of screening sentinel animals for hepatitis, minute, lymphocytic choriomeningitis, ectromelia, polyoma, Sendai, pneumonia, and mouse adenoviruses, enteric bacterial pathogens, and parasites.Analyses of Transgene ExpressionTransgenic mice and their normal littermates were sacrificed between postnatal days 35 (P35) and 42. Some animals received an intraperitoneal injection of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd, 120 mg/kg body wt) and 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (12 mg/kg) 90 min prior to their death.Immediately after sacrifice, several tissue samples were recovered. The small intestine was divided into quarters. A 2-cm section was taken from the center of each quarter and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent RNA isolation. The colon was divided in half and a 2-cm section was taken from the centers of the proximal and distal halves, also for isolation of RNA. The stomach was divided in half along its greater and lesser curvatures. One-half was used for RNA extraction. A wedge of liver and one-half of one kidney were also used to prepare RNA. The remainder of these tissues, plus portions of heart, lung, spleen, pancreas, skin, white adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and brain were fixed in Bouin's solution at room temperature for 8–18 h, rinsed in ethanol, and embedded in paraffin for immunohistochemical analysis.Quantitative RNA Hybridization StudiesTotal cellular RNA was isolated from frozen pulverized tissues using RNeasy columns (Qiagen). RNA samples were fractionated by denaturing formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to Nylon-1 membranes by capillary blotting (Life Technologies, Inc.). The membranes were probed with hGH+3 to +2150 DNA labeled with 33P using random primers (1Simon T.C. Roth K.A. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18345-18358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each blot contained reference RNA samples containing known amounts of hGH mRNA. The intensity of the hybridization signal from each mouse tissue RNA sample was quantitated using a storage PhosphorImaging system. Blots were stripped and reprobed with a 33P-labeled human glyceraldehyde-6-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA (American Tissue Culture Collection). hGH mRNA concentrations in tissue RNAs were calculated by comparing the sample signal to the signals from the RNA standards after normalizing to glyceraldehyde-6-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA levels.Single and Multi-label ImmunohistochemistryFive-micron thick sections prepared from paraffin-embedded samples of stomach, small intestine, cecum, colon, liver, kidney, pancreas, spleen, white adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, brain, heart, and lung were incubated overnight at 4 °C with sheep anti-hGH (Cortex Biochem; diluted 1:10,000 in blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% non-fat dry milk, 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS)). Bound antibodies were detected by adding biotinylated donkey anti-sheep immunoglobulins (Ig; Jackson ImmunoResearch; 1:1000) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by streptavidin peroxidase conjugate (Vector Laboratories) for 30 min. Metal-enhanced 3′,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB, Pierce Chemical) was used as the peroxidase substrate (incubation = 15 s at room temperature). Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin.Triple label fluorescent visualization of liver fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP), hGH, and BrdUrd in the intestinal epithelium was accomplished using the following multistep protocol: (i) bovine pancreas α-chymotrypsin (1 mg/ml in 0.1% CaCl2) for 15 min at 37 °C (antigen unmasking step); (ii) rabbit anti-L-FABP sera (1:500; Ref. 6Sweetser D.A.

Stained sections prepared from normal and transgenic mice were then scanned with a Molecular Dynamics Multiprobe 2001 inverted confocal microscope system.Electron Microscopic ImmunohistochemistryFull thickness pieces of gut (each 1 × 6 mm) were cut from the center of each quarter of the small intestine and from the center of each half of the colon. Each piece was immersed for 4 h at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde. The fixed fragments were washed 3 times with PBS, 3% sucrose, left in fresh buffer overnight at 4 °C, dehydrated with graded ethanols, and embedded in Lowicryl K4M (Polysciences). Sections (50–70 nm) were cut along the plane of the crypt-villus axis and picked up on slotted nickel grids that were coated with Formvar and stabilized with evaporated carbon film (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Grids were floated for 30 min at room temperature on drops of Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), containing 10% normal mouse serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and 0.3% Tween 20. Blocked grids were then transferred to drops of sheep anti-hGH (diluted 1:100 in TBS, 5% normal mouse serum, 0.3% Tween 20). After a 2-h incubation at room temperature, grids were washed with TBS/Tween (3 cycles; 5 min each). Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized with 18 nm colloidal gold conjugated-goat anti-rabbit IgG as described previously (11Simon T.C. Roberts L.J.J. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8685-8689Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Air-dried sections were stained with 4% aqueous uranyl acetate and Reynolds lead citrate (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and viewed under a JOEL Model X100 electron microscope. The specificity of the immunostaining was established by performing two types of control experiments: omitting the hGH antisera or incubating intestinal specimens obtained from normal (nontransgenic) mice with both primary and secondary antibodies.RESULTSIn Vitro AnalysesFabpl Contains a Direct Heptad Repeat That Binds Proteins Present in Kidney Nuclear ExtractsGel mobility shift assays (GMSA) were performed to identify transcription factor binding sites that mediate suppression of Fabplin renal proximal tubular epithelial cells. Nuclear extracts, prepared from adult FVB/N mouse kidneys, formed a prominent complex with a double-stranded oligo spanning nucleotides −187 to −123 of rat Fabpl(Fig.1 A plus Fig. 1 B, lane 5). A 64-fold molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded template markedly reduced the amount of labeled complex formed (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2–5).A series of shorter double-stranded olig"

The truncations containing the C terminus of the protein were fused with the cleavable N-terminal signal sequence of glycophorin A to facilitate the correct orientation of the most N-terminal band 3 membrane span. Cleavage of the glycophorin A signal sequence was observed, except when the truncation was in the first exofacial loop where the signal peptidase cleavage site was probably too close to the membrane. The anion transport activity of co-expressed complementary pairs of truncations which together contained the entire band 3 membrane domain was examined. The pairs of fragments divided in the third and fourth exofacial loops yielded transport activity, but the pair separated within the second exofacial loop was not active. We conclude that the integrity of the second exofacial loop, but not the third and fourth exofacial loops, is necessary for transport activity. The unusually stable association between the fragments divided in the second exofacial loop suggests that interactions may occur between polar surfaces on amphiphilic portions of the third and fifth transmembrane spans.

The human erythrocyte anion transporter (band 3, AE1) is the most abundant integral membrane protein present in the red cell membrane (1Tanner M.J.A. Semin. Hematol. 1993; 30: 34-57PubMed Google Scholar, 2Reithmeier R.A.F. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 515-523Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 3Tanner M.J.A.

Cell Res. 1992; 2: 1-358Google Scholar). Band 3 has two domains with distinct structures and functions; the C-terminal transmembrane domain mediates anion transport, whereas the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain associates with ankyrin to anchor the erythrocyte skeleton to the membrane and also binds several peripheral membrane proteins. The membrane domain of band 3 contains a substantial proportion of α-helical structure (6Oikawa K. Lieberman D.M. Reithmeier R.A.F. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2843-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and models for the structure of this region of the protein suggest the polypeptide chain spans the membrane up to 14 times (1Tanner M.J.A.

Structural analysis of two-dimensional crystals of the membrane domain of band 3 at low resolution suggests that it contains three subdomains, and one of these, which is rather mobile, may be comprised of portions of the membrane domain located at the cytoplasmic surface (7Wang D.N. Kuhlbrandt W. Sarabia V.E. Reithmeier R.A.F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2233-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 8Wang D.N. Sarabia V.E. Reithmeier R.A.F. Kuhlbrandt W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3230-3235Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We reported recently that co-expression of two pairs of complementary fragments of band 3 resulted in the generation of a stilbene disulfonate-sensitive uptake of chloride into Xenopusoocytes, similar to expressed intact band 3 (9Groves J.D. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9097-9105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The pairs of fragments contained the first 8 and last 6 membrane spans (8 + 6) and the first 12 and last 2 membrane spans (12 + 2) and were separated within cytoplasmic surface loops of the membrane domain. These studies showed that the integrity of some cytoplasmic loops of band 3 is not essential for assembly into an anion transport-active structure and that there is no unique signal sequence for inserting the different transmembrane spans of band 3 into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; N-benzoyl-Asn-Leu-Thr-N-methylamide (NLT); DNDS, 4,4′-dinitro-2,2′-stilbene disulfonate; GPA, glycophorin A; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. membrane (9Groves J.D. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9097-9105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this paper we demonstrate that pairs of complementary fragments separated within exofacial surface loops of the membrane domain of band 3 can also assemble into transport-active structures. The constructs pBSXG1.b3 and pBSXG.GPA have been described previously (10Groves J.D. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22163-22170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They contain the cDNAs encoding human red cell band 3 (AE1) and glycophorin A (GPA), respectively, flanked by the 5′- and 3′-noncoding regions of Xenopus β-globin. cDNA constructs encoding five pairs of complementary N- and C-terminally truncated band 3 mutants (Fig. 1) were prepared from pBSXG1.b3 and pBSXG.GPA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mutagenesis as follows. The recombinants encoding fragments containing the N-terminal portion of band 3 (i.e. truncated at the C terminus) were constructed as described previously (9Groves J.D. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9097-9105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Each antisense PCR primer annealed to the band 3 cDNA sequence immediately before the point of truncation and introduced a translation termination codon followed by a BstEII restriction enzyme site at this position. PCR products were digested with BstEII, recircularized, and cloned into Escherichia coli TG2. The nomenclature of the constructs and the amino acids of band 3 they encode is shown in Fig.1. The recombinants encoding fragments containing the C-terminal portion of band 3 (i.e. truncated at the N terminus) were constructed as chimeras with the cleavable signal sequence of GPA. This was inserted upstream of the truncated 5′-end of the band 3 cDNA. First, the recombinant encoding the polypeptide corresponding to the last 13 membrane spans of band 3 (designated (2:14), see Fig. 1) was prepared by PCR from pBSXG1.b3. The sense primer (NtOut1-S) was 5′-GGGAGCGAAGCTAGCGGTAACCAGATGGGAGTGTC-3′ which introduced an NheI restriction site (underlined) and an additional glycine codon immediately upstream of the cDNA encoding amino acids 433–911 of band 3. The antisense primer was the universal M13 reverse primer that annealed to a site in the vector downstream of the 3′-noncoding region of Xenopus β-globin and theHindIII site in pBSXG1.b3. The cDNA encoding the signal sequence of GPA (from Met-1 to Ala-19 in the sequence of the GPA preprotein) was prepared by PCR from pBSXG.GPA. The antisense primer (Out-AS) was 5′-GGAGCAACCGCTAGCTGATATGCTCACAATTT-3′ which exactly matched 19 nucleotides encoding Glu-12 to Ala-19 in the sequence of pBSXG.GPA and incorporated an NheI restriction enzyme site (underlined) at the 3′-side of the GPA coding sequence. The sense primer in the PCR reaction annealed to a site upstream of theHindIII site in pBSXG.GPA. Both PCR products were digested with NheI and HindIII, ligated, and cloned intoE. coli TG2 to give pBSXG.ND1 (Fig. 2). The translation product of pBSXG.ND1 contained the signal peptidase cleavage site of the GPA signal sequence (between Ala-19 and Ser-20) followed by a glycine spacer before the start of the band 3-derived sequence. After signal peptidase cleavage, the resulting band 3 portion would be expected to have the N-terminal sequence Ser-Gly- followed by amino acid residues 433–911 of band 3. pBSXG.ND1 was used to prepare the four mutants of band 3 that were truncated at the N terminus. A series of sense primers (each analogous to NtOut1-S) were used to incorporate an NheI site and a glycine codon upstream of the appropriate band 3 coding sequence. Following PCR in combination with the antisense primer Out-AS (described above), each PCR product was digested with NheI, recircularized, and cloned into E. coli TG2. After signal peptidase cleavage, the resulting band 3 fragments would be expected to have the N-terminal amino acid sequence Ser-Gly- followed by amino acid residues 482–911 of band 3 for the construct designated (4:14), residues 554–911 of band 3 for (6:14), residues 640–911 of band 3 for (8:14)a, or residues 647–911 of band 3 for (8:14)b, as shown in Figs.1 and 2. The cDNA coding sequences of all 10 recombinants were verified using either a DuPont Genesis 2000 automated sequencer or manually by double-stranded dideoxy sequencing with Sequenase or cycle sequencing with Taq polymerase (both from U. S. Biochemical Corp.). DNA sequencing showed that all the recombinants had the correct sequences, except that fragments (8:14)a and (8:14)b each contained a mutation that was probably introduced in the PCR step (Arg-879 → Gly in (8:14)a; Phe-702 → Ile in (8:14)b; numbering based on the intact band 3 sequence) although neither of these appeared to affect the functional activity of the constructs (see “Results”). The methods used for in vitro transcription of cRNA with T7 RNA polymerase, cell-free translation in the rabbit reticulocyte system with canine pancreatic microsomes, purification of microsomes, alkaline extraction, inhibition of N-glycosylation using the acceptor tripeptide N-benzoyl-Asn-Leu-Thr-N-methylamide (NLT), as well as the isolation of Xenopus oocytes, injection with cRNA, chloride transport assay,35S-amino-acid labeling, immunoprecipitation and chymotrypsin treatment of oocytes have been described previously (9Groves J.D. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9097-9105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 10Groves J.D. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol.

Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207516) Google Scholar) using either linear or gradient gels (4–20% acrylamide, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hemel Hempstead, UK) and subjected to autoradiography or fluorography as detailed in the figure legends. Fragments expressed in microsomes were treated with trypsin (5 μg/ml) as described previously (9Groves J.D. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9097-9105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Samples of three of the expressed fragments truncated at the N terminus (2:14), (4:14), and (6:14) were prepared by cell-free translation (50-μl reaction mixture) as above. Expressed protein was labeled with l-[35S]methionine at 0.9 μCi/μl. The fragment (4:14) was double-labeled with the addition ofl-[4,5-3H]leucine at 0.5 μCi/μl. In this case l-[35S]methionine was added to enhance the visualization of the bands after autoradiography. After translation, the microsomes were purified by centrifugation and solubilized, and radiolabeled proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto Problott membrane (Applied Biosystems). After autoradiography to identify the positions of the radiolabeled proteins, the bands were excised from the Problott membrane and subjected to Edman degradation on an automatic protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems 477A). In previous studies we showed that two pairs of complementary band 3 fragments divided in cytoplasmically oriented loops were able to assemble into an anion transport-active structure (9Groves J.D. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9097-9105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To investigate whether functional complementation was a general structural feature of the protein, a series of recombinants were constructed from pBSXG1.b3 (which encodes the intact band 3 polypeptide (10Groves J.D. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22163-22170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) to allow co-expression of pairs of fragments divided in exofacial loops. Each pair of fragments taken together provides all 911 amino acid residues of human red cell band 3. Fig. 1 illustrates the five complementary pairs of fragments encoded in these constructs that were separated in the first, second, third, and fourth exofacial loops. The fourth exofacial loop of band 3 contains the N-glycosylation site, and two pairs of constructs were made with the division located at the N-terminal side (b3(1:7)a and (8:14)a and at the C-terminal side (b3(1:7b) and 8:14)b of the N-glycan addition site (see Fig. 1). It was unclear whether the sequence information present in the most N-terminal membrane span of the C-terminal partner of each pair would be sufficient to ensure this span became oriented in the membrane with its N terminus exofacial (see “Discussion”). To drive the N termini of these band 3 fragments to the luminal side of the ER membrane, we fused the cleavable N-terminal signal sequence of glycophorin A (GPA) to the N terminus of the band 3 fragments with a short linker (Fig.2). After translocation into the ER lumen, we expected the GPA signal sequence to be cleaved by signal peptidase at Ala-19, leaving two amino acid residues of the linker (Ser-Gly) preceding the band 3 sequence. The band 3 fragments were expressed from cRNAs in the rabbit reticulocyte cell-free translation system in the presence or absence of canine pancreatic microsomes. Fig.3 A shows that all five C-terminally truncated fragments (b3(1), b3(1:3), b3(1:5), b3(1:7)a, and b3(1:7)b) migrated on SDS-PAGE with the mobilities predicted from their molecular weight. Fragment b3(1:7)a, which is truncated after residue Lys-639 and does not include the band 3 N-glycosylation site at residue Asn-642, ran as a single band on the gel. In contrast, b3(1:7)b which contains the N-glycan addition site gave two major bands, the lower of which had similar mobility to that of b3(1:7)a. Translation of b3(1:7)b in the presence of the N-linked glycosylation competitive acceptor peptide benzoyl-Asn-Leu-Thr-N-methylamide (NLT) caused a noticeable decrease in intensity of the upper N-glycosylated band and increase of the lower unglycosylated band. These results show that the C terminus of b3(1:7)b becomes N-glycosylated in the cell-free translation system, albeit somewhat inefficiently. Similar inefficient glycosylation of band 3 fragments carrying anN-glycan addition site at the C terminus has also been reported (13Tam L.Y. Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32542-32550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All the fragments remained associated with the microsomal membranes after centrifugation through an alkaline sucrose cushion to strip off polypeptides associated with the membranes in a peripheral fashion (data not shown). This demonstrated that all the fragments, including b3(1) which contains only the first membrane span, integrate into the microsomal membrane. The series of band 3 fragments truncated at the N terminus ((2:14), (4:14), (6:14), (8:14)a, and (8:14)b) were also examined in the cell-free translation system (Fig. 3 B). Translation was carried out (i) with microsomes, which should result in bothN-glycosylation and cleavage of the GPA signal sequence; (ii) with microsomes and the NLT peptide, which should inhibitN-glycosylation but permit cleavage of the GPA signal sequence; and (iii) without either microsomes or the NLT peptide, so that neither N-glycosylation nor GPA signal sequence cleavage should occur. Since the cleavage of the GPA signal sequence from the N terminus of the band 3 fragments occurs only within the lumen of the microsomal membranes, this experiment should help establish whether the N terminus of the C-terminal band 3 fragments was correctly translocated to the luminal (exofacial) side of the membranes. Fragment (8:14)b does not contain the band 3 N-glycan addition site and as expected did not show any difference in molecular weight when the NLT inhibitor peptide was present but did show the expected change in molecular weight resulting from cleavage of the GPA signal sequence (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, (8:14)a was efficiently N-glycosylated, and the GPA signal sequence was cleaved by the microsomes. Since the N-glycan chain is at the extreme N terminus of the processed polypeptide derived from this construct, this confirms that the N terminus of the band 3 fragment produced is efficiently translocated to the luminal side of the microsomal membranes. The changes in apparent molecular weight observed for (6:14) in this experiment demonstrate that the signal sequence is cleaved from the N terminus of this fragment and that it isN-glycosylated. The results in Fig. 3 B showed that (2:14) and (4:14) were N-glycosylated, but it was much more difficult to establish whether the GPA signal sequence was cleaved from these larger fragments because the cleaved and uncleaved polypeptides could not be resolved clearly from each other. The change in SDS-PAGE mobility resulting from the addition of theN-glycan chain (approximately 2.2 kDa) was much greater than that observed from the loss of the GPA signal sequence (approximately 1.8 kDa). This probably results from the well known anomalous SDS-PAGE mobility effects observed with integral membrane proteins. The GPA signal sequence probably behaves like an additional membrane span in the polypeptide. To establish whether the GPA signal sequence was cleaved from (2:14) and (4:14), the translation products were radioactively labeled at methionine or leucine residues. After purification the radiolabeled translation products were subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing. A parallel experiment was done with fragment (6:14) as a control, since the experiment in Fig. 3 B demonstrated that the GPA signal sequence was cleaved from this fragment very efficiently in the microsomes. Fragment (6:14) with an uncleaved GPA signal sequence would contain methionine at residue 1, whereas the processed form of (6:14) with the GPA leader sequence cleaved would contain methionine at residue 8 (Fig. 4 A). The release of radioactivity during amino acid sequencing for 15 cycles of (6:14) radiolabeled with [35S]methionine is shown in Fig.4 A. Comparison of the substantial amount of radioactivity released at cycle 8 with the small amount released at cycle 1 (which probably also includes some initial wash off of the intact labeled fragment from the membrane) indicates that >90% of the GPA signal sequence was cleaved. With fragment (2:14), methionine would be expected at residue 5 of the cleaved form compared with position 1 of the uncleaved polypeptide (Fig. 4 B). The results of sequencing fragment (2:14) labeled with [35S]methionine are shown in Fig. 4 B. Only about 40% of the radioactivity was released at cycle 5, with 60% of the radioactivity being released at cycle 1. This suggests that the GPA signal sequence is rather inefficiently cleaved from (2:14) with less than half of the fragment being processed by the signal peptidase. While the N terminus of correctly processed material is on the exofacial side of the membrane, we cannot be certain of the location of the N terminus of the uncleaved material, although it is likely that the N-terminal end of the band 3-containing portion forms part of an exofacial loop attached to the GPA signal sequence. Signal peptidase-processed fragment (4:14) does not contain a methionine residue close to the N terminus but contains leucine at residue 5 (see Fig. 4 C). The GPA signal sequence contains leucines at residues 9, 10, and 11. Fig. 4 C shows the results of sequencing (4:14) labeled with [3H]leucine. A large peak of radioactivity was released at cycle 5, and there was a small peak released at cycle 9. The high background release of radioactivity in the later cycles of this sequencer run makes it difficult to quantify the release of radioactivity from the three leucines at residues 9, 10, and 11 of the GPA signal sequence, but the results suggest there was substantial, if not almost complete, cleavage of the GPA signal sequence from (4:14). Taken together these results show that, with the exception of (2:14), the GPA signal sequences are cleaved in the microsomes from the fragments containing the C-terminal portions of band 3. This confirms that the N termini of these fragments are translocated to the luminal face of the microsomes. However, only a proportion of the GPA signal sequence is cleaved from (2:14). Trypsin proteolysis of microsomes containing the truncated constructs prepared by cell-free translation was used to assess whether they were integrated into the membrane in a manner similar to the intact protein using conditions described previously (9Groves J.D. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9097-9105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Microsomes containing intact band 3 and the series of band 3 recombinant constructs truncated at the C terminus were treated in parallel with the protease (results not shown). As expected all the samples yielded the intact 43-kDa N-terminal cytoplasmic domain resulting from cleavage at Lys-360 (14Mawby W.J. Findlay J.B.C. Biochem. J. 1982; 205: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and fragments of 26, 24, and 21 kDa as well as traces of an 8.5-kDa fragment, all of which probably originate from further cleavage of the 43-kDa N-terminal cytoplasmic domain (15Low P.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 864: 145-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Intact band 3 also gave a 75-kDa fragment that results from cleavage within the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain (9Groves J.D. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9097-9105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and the entire membrane domain comprising residues 361 to the C terminus. The b3(1) truncation did not show any additional fragment derived from the membrane-bound portion, since this portion (residues 361–432) does not contain any methionine residues and therefore does not carry any radiolabel. The constructs b3(1:3), b3(1:5), b3(1:7)a, and b3(1:7)b showed a ladder of distinctive major proteolysis products of increasing size migrating at 8.5, 19, 25, and 30 kDa, which contain the portions from residue 361 to the C terminus of the constructs. The b3(1:7)a and b3(1:7)b truncations also showed a ladder of minor tryptic cleavage products at 12 and 16 kDa. As expected, the fragments derived from b3(1:7)b gave doublets from the presence of both N-glycosylated and nonglycosylated forms. Microsomes containing the constructs truncated at the N terminus were also treated in parallel with intact band 3 (results not shown). All the samples yielded a 24-kDa band that represents the C-terminal fragment resulting from cleavage at Lys-743 (16Jennings M.L. Anderson M.P. Monaghan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9002-9010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of intact band 3 this fragment co-migrated with the 24-kDa fragment derived from the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain. A ladder of distinctive proteolytic fragments was again observed, migrating at approximately 30, 27, 24, 19, and 9 kDa for (2:14), (4:14), (6:14), (8:14)a, and (8:14)b, respectively. These represent the portions of the constructs from the N terminus to Lys-743. All the constructs except (8:14)b can beN-glycosylated and, as expected, (8:14)b gave a single band while the other fragments gave doublets resulting from the presence of both N-glycosylated and nonglycosylated forms. These results show that the trypsin susceptibility of the constructs in microsomes is comparable with that of intact band 3. The limited protease susceptibility observed together with the results of the GPA signal peptide cleavage and N-glycosylation studies suggest that the constructs insert into membranes with the correct topology and with tightly folded structures similar to that adopted by the intact protein. However, a significant portion of the (2:14) construct retains the GPA signal sequence appended at the N terminus. The cRNAs encoding band 3 fragments were injected intoXenopus oocytes either individually or co-injected as complementary pairs. Oocytes were co-injected with a high concentration of band 3 cRNA (15 ng/oocyte) or a molar equivalent of band 3 fragment cRNA, together with GPA cRNA (3.5 ng/oocyte). GPA is known to enhance the cell surface expression of intact band 3 (10Groves J.D. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22163-22170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Groves J.D. Tanner M.J.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 140: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and of complementary pairs of band 3 fragments (9Groves J.D. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9097-9105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) in Xenopusoocytes. After 48 h at 18 °C to allow expression, the uptake of36Cl− into the cells was measured over a 1-h period. The band 3-specific chloride uptake was estimated from the difference in chloride uptake by the oocytes in the absence and presence of 4,4′-dinitro-2,2′-stilbene disulfonate (DNDS). The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 5. None of the band 3 fragments induced significant DNDS-sensitive36Cl− uptake when expressed individually with GPA. However, co-expression of equimolar amounts of the pairs of cRNAs encoding fragments b3(1:5) + (6:14), b3(1:7)a + (8:14)a, and b3(1:7)b + (8:14)b induced DNDS-sensitive36Cl− uptake into the oocytes at levels similar to that obtained with intact band 3. In contrast, no significant DNDS-sensitive anion transport was obtained with either of the pairs of fragments b3(1) + (2:14) or b3(1:3) + (4:14). Similar results (not shown) were obtained in another experiment using the latter two pairs of complementary fragments but at lower cRNA concentrations (7.5 ng/oocyte). To examine the rate at which stilbene disulfonate-sensitive chloride transport was expressed in the cells, oocytes were co-injected with relatively low concentrations (equimolar to 1.5 ng/oocyte of band 3) of the cRNAs encoding either intact band 3 or the three pairs of complementary fragments that had shown functional reconstitution in Fig. 5, together with 0.5 ng of GPA cRNA, and influx of chloride was measured over 15 min. The level of DNDS-sensitive chloride influx increased steadily over a period of 48-h expression of the cRNAs (data not shown). Stilbene-sensitive chloride influx of 3.6 nmol/oocyte over 15 min was obtained with intact band 3 after 48-h expression in this experiment. The stilbene-sensitive anion transport activities induced by the pairs of fragments b3(1:5) + (6:14) and b3(1:7)a + (8:14)a were comparable with that of intact band 3, suggesting that these fragments assemble with a functional activity similar to that of intact band 3. At these lower cRNA concentrations, after 48-h expression the pair of fragments b3(1:7)b + (8:14)b induced only 18% of the DNDS-sensitive chloride transport obtained with intact band 3. It was important to establish whether the pairs of complementary constructs b3(1) + (2:14) and b3(1:3) + (4:14) were unable to induce DNDS-sensitive anion transport in oocytes because they could not assemble into an anion transport-active structure or because they were not translocated to the cell surface after biosynthesis. Band 3 in red cells is cleaved by chymotrypsin at a site in the third exofacial loop (Tyr-553) to yield a 60-kDa N-terminal fragment and a 35-kDa C-terminal fragment (17Steck T.L. Ramos B. Strapazon E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1154-1161Crossref Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The truncated band 3 constructs that contain the chymotrypsin cleavage site can be detected at the oocyte cell surface by the formation of either the 60-kDa chymotryptic product (from truncations containing the N terminus of the protein) or the 35-kDa chymotryptic product (from truncations containing the C terminus of the protein) after treating intact oocytes with chymotrypsin (9Groves J.D. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9097-9105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Internally located truncated band 3 is not accessible to the protease and remains uncleaved. After expression of the cRNAs in the presence of35S-amino-acids, chymotrypsin digestion and detergent solubilization, the proportion of each band 3 truncation polypeptide expressed at the oocyte cell surface was estimated by immunoprecipitation of both the intact truncation polypeptide and the chymotryptic product using either the monoclonal antibody BRIC 1"

Up-regulation of Pim-1 by signaling through the GM-CSF receptor family requires the presence of the GM-CSF receptor membrane proximal domain and may involve the JAK2 tyrosine kinase (19Lilly M. Le T.

STAT1 sites within the pim-1 gene support this hypothesis (18Yip-Schneider M.T. Horie M. Broxmeyer H.E. Blood. 1995; 12: 3494-3502Crossref Google Scholar). During GM-CSF stimulation, Pim-1 is involved in a DNA synthetic pathway rather than an apoptotic inhibition pathway (24Kinoshita T. Yokota T. Arai K. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2266-2275Crossref Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Relatively little is known concerning the post-translational regulation of Pim-1, even though it was identified as a protein kinase more than a decade ago (3Selten G. Cuypers H.T. Berns A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1793-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). There has been no evidence (e.g. band shifts of Pim-1 during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) to support the phosphorylation of Pim-1 during signal transduction. Nor has the phosphotransferase activity of the kinase been shown to be affected by phosphorylation. Pim-1 can autophosphorylate, but the sites of autophosphorylation and the functional consequences of this event have not yet been determined (14Saris C.J.M. Domen J. Berns A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 25Meeker T.C. Nagarajan L. ar-Rushdi A. Croce C.M. J. Cell.

As Pim-1 phosphotransferase activity has not yet been shown to be regulated by upstream kinases, it is possible that an autophosphorylation event may modulate the activity of the kinase. One of the goals of this study was to identify the major autophosphorylation site in Pim-1 and to assess its role. Pim-1 has not yet been examined from non-mammalian systems, nor has it been purified to homogeneity. In this study, we have cloned Pim-1 from Xenopus laevis and characterized a purified glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion form of this kinase that was expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant GST-Pim-1 was highly active and exhibited strong autophosphorylating activityin vitro. Immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) and high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) were employed to identify the main autophosphorylation site as Ser-190. Mutational analysis confirmed that Ser-190 was indeed the major site of autophosphorylation and indicated that phosphorylation of this residue serves to activate this kinase. The Pim-1-CT and the Tel anti-Pim-1 antibodies were kind gifts from Dr. Michael Lilly (Seattle VA Hospital) and Drs. R. Amson and A. Telerman (CEPH, Paris, France), respectively. The anti-GST antibody was obtained from Molecular Probes, and the anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibodies PY-20 and 4G10 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Upstate Biotechnology Inc., respectively. The blotting grade affinity-purified goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) alkaline phosphatase conjugate was from Bio-Rad, and the electroimmunoassay grade affinity-purified goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) alkaline phosphatase conjugate was obtained from Calbiochem. Pim-1 substrate peptide (AKRRRLSA) was produced on an Applied Biosystems 430A peptide synthesizer and purified in the laboratory of Dr. Ian Clark-Lewis (Biomedical Research Center, University of British Columbia). Phosphatase HPTPβ was a kind gift from Ken Harder (Biomedical Research Center). The pGEX-2T vector was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. The E. coli bacterial strain UT5600 as well as restriction enzymes BamHI and HindIII were from New England Biolabs. The isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was from Fisher. The cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor peptide, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and other reagents were from Sigma. All oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 392 DNA synthesizer. Stage VI immature oocytes were isolated from the ovaries of mature female X. laevis (28Belle R. Mulner-Lorillon O. Marot J. Ozon R. Cell Differ. 1986; 19: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and washed with 1 × Xenopus oocyte medium (29Zhang S.C. Masui Y. J. Exp. Zool. 1992; 262: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from these oocytes and used as a template to make cDNA (30Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). A Xenopus pim-1 probe was constructed using oligonucleotides based on the sequences of human and murinepim-1 sequences (31Zakut-Houri R. Hazum S. Givol D. Telerman A. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 54: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Sense and antisense primers (5′-CTG ACC CGG GCT CGA GGC ICC IGG IAA (G/A)GA (G/A)AA (G/A)GA (G/A)CC-3′ and 5′-CTG ACC CGG GCT CGA GAT (C/T)TC (C/T)TC (G/A)TC (G/A)TG TTC (G/A)AA IGG-3′, respectively) were expected to yield a 669-base pair product. PCRs were carried out for 29 cycles with an initiation temperature of 94 °C for 35 s, annealing at 50 °C for 90 s, and elongation for 73 °C for 90 s. PCR products were subcloned into pBluescript, amplified, examined by restriction digest analysis, and the identity of the PCR clones was confirmed by sequencing, using a double template protocol as dictated by the Pharmacia kit. A Xenopus oocyte cDNA library was kindly supplied by Dr. Leonard Zon (Children's Hospital, Boston) and was screened with the amplifiedXenopus PCR fragment by standard methods (30Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Positive clones were amplified and sequenced using the standard dideoxy chain termination method (32Sanger F. Coulson A.R. Barrell B.G. Smith A.J.H. Roe B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 143: 161-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (2197) Google Scholar). Sequence searches were performed with a software package developed by Dr. Allen Delaney (Biomedical Research Center). The coding region of the X. laevis pim-1 was amplified from a cDNA clone by PCR using the pim-1 based oligonucleotides, 5′-CGA TGG ATC CAT GCT TCT CTC TAA ATT CGG-3′ and 5′-GAT CGA ATT CCA GAC TCT CGT TGC TTG A-3′, which allowed directional, in-frame insertion into the pGEX-2T vector. To create the kinase-inactive (K69A) Pim-1 mutant, PCR was used with the 5′ sense primer and the antisense primer K1, 5′-CTC CTT AGC TAC GTG GCG CAC AGC GAC CGG CTG-3′ (corresponding to amino acids 64–74, with the lysine codon, TCC (nucleotides 205–207), changed to an alanine codon, GCG). To create Ser-190 mutants of Pim-1, sense primer PM1 (5′-CTG ATC GAT TTT GGC GCC GGG GCG CTA CTC-3′) was used to make a serine to alanine mutant (S190A) and the sense primer PM2 (5′-CTG ATC GAT TTT GGC GAA GGG GCG CTA CTC-3′) was used to make a serine to glutamic acid mutant (S190E) of Pim-1. Both sense primers were used with PM3 (5′-GAT CGA ATT CCA GAC TCT CGT TGC TTG A-3′) to amplify a 415-base pair fragment that was used to replace theClaI/EcoRI fragment of WT Xenopus pim-1. PCR products were purified, digested, and ligated into appropriate restriction sites of pGEX-2T. The ligations were used to transform DH5a high competence cells (Life Technologies, Inc.), and positive clones were selected on the basis of ampicillin resistance. All clones were sequenced to confirm that the mutations were as expected. The pGEX-2T vectors containing Xenopus WT and mutant pim-1 inserts were used to produce GST-Pim-1 fusion protein. In brief, UT5600E. coli (New England Biolabs) was transfected with thepim-1-containing pGEX-2T vectors and grown in 2 × YT medium (30Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) in the presence of 75 μg/ml ampicillin. The expression of the fusion protein was induced with 200 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h. The bacterial were pelleted by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 15 min, the pellet was washed in 25 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml) aprotinin, leupeptin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor. Lysozyme (200 μg/ml) and DNase (50 mg/ml) were added to each pellet, followed by incubation on ice for 30 min. The lysate was centrifuged (12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant was removed and added to glutathione-agarose beads and mixed gently on a rotator at 4 °C for 30 min. The beads were then poured into a 1-cm-diameter column and washed with 10 volumes of STE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100), followed by 10 volumes of STEC buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mmNaCl, 6 mm CaCl2). The fusion protein was eluted from the beads with 10 mm glutathione in STEC buffer and immediately frozen at −70 °C. The affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal Pim-1 anti-peptide antibodies were prepared as described by Sanghera et al. (33Sanghera J. Peter M. Nigg E. Pelech S.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and are commercially available from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Pim-1-III was based on the kinase subdomain III region of the human Pim-1 (amino acid residues 70–91). Pim-1-NT was patterned after the amino terminus of human Pim-1 (amino acid residues 1–37). Anti-Pim-1-XI was raised against a peptide modeled on the catalytic subdomain XI of xPim-1 (residues 275–292). Rabbit polyclonal antiserum was produced against the full-length GST-xPim-1 bacterial fusion protein eluted from the glutathione beads after concentration. Rabbits were first injected with 250 μg of GST-xPim-1 in incomplete Freund's adjuvant; 200 μg was used for the second and third injections, and 100 μg of the fusion protein was used for each successive injection. The rabbits were bled and the serum purified by protein G purification following the manufacturer's protocol (Pharmacia). The protein G-purified serum (1.5 ml) was incubated with rotation for 30 min at 4 °C with GST beads (500 μl) to remove any antibodies specific for GST. The beads were centrifuged and washed once with 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (4 °C), and the supernatants were combined, aliquoted, and frozen. The coding region of Xenopus WTpim-1 was amplified using PCR oligomutagenesis using oligonucleotides 5H6PM (5′-(P) ATG GAA GAG GAA GAG GAA GAG CTT CTC TCT AAA TTC GGA TCG - 3′) and PM3′ (5′-CAA AGC TTT ACA GAC TCT CGT TGC TTG AGC-3′), which added a 5′ tag of six glutamic acid residues on the Pim-1 protein. The PCR fragment was subcloned into the SmaI site of the PEF1 expression, vector and then the Pim-PEF1 vectors were transformed into DH5a/P3 bacteria. Transformed bacteria were grown on plates containing both ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and tetracycline (10 μg/ml). Clones were selected for the presence of an insert by digestion with SalI, the orientation of the inserts was determined by BglII digestion, and the ends of the WT and the mutants were sequenced to confirm that the ligation was as expected. Positive clones were transfected into the COS cells and grown 72 h before harvesting. Cells were homogenized in buffer containing 10 mm MES, pH 6.0, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm Na3VO4, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin. The homogenates were sonicated then centrifuged at 12,000 × g to separate the supernatant and pellets, which were frozen immediately. Samples of the homogenates, supernatants, and pellets were analyzed by Western blotting. Glutamic acid-tagged Pim-1 proteins were partially purified by fractionation on Resource Q column chromatography. COS extract (2 mg) was applied to a 2-ml Resource Q column and eluted with a 0–0.8m NaCl gradient over 10 ml, in buffer containing 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mmNa3VO4. Fractions of 0.25 ml were collected and analyzed for the presence of Pim-1 by assays with Pim-1 substrate peptide and Western blotting. Phosphorylations were performed in a final volume of 50 μl, with 1–25 μg of GST-xPim-1 in 5 μl of STEC buffer, 250 μm [γ-32P]ATP (6 × 103cpm/pmol), 500 nm cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor, and assay dilution buffer containing 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1.25 mmMnCl2. Preincubations were performed over ice, and the kinase reaction at 30 °C for 30 min was started with the inclusion of the ATP and terminated by the addition of 50 μl of 2 × SDS-sample buffer. The sample was boiled for 5 min and clarified by centrifugation and the supernatant electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. In some experiments, the gels were stained to ensure that the amount of protein loaded per lane was consistent. The gels were dried, and radioactive bands were cut from the gel and counted by scintillation counting. Stoichiometry of autophosphorylation was determined by measuring the mol of ATP incorporated per mol of GST-xPim-1. In other experiments, the GST-xPim-1 was transferred from the SDS-polyacrylamide gel onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for Western blotting and autoradiography. The peptide (AKRRRLSA) was determined previously to be an optimal substrate for Pim-1. 2C. K. Palaty, G. Kalmar, S. L. Pelech, and Ian Clark-Lewis, submitted for publication. Pim-1 substrate peptide phosphorylations were performed in a final volume of 25 μl, with 1 mg/ml peptide, 0.5 μg of GST-xPim-1 in 5 μl of STEC buffer, 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (2,000 cpm/pmol), 1.5 mm MnCl2 or 25 mmMgCl2, 0.5 μm cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor peptide, and assay dilution buffer. All preincubations were performed on ice, and the kinase reactions at 30 °C for 10 min were started with the addition of the ATP and terminated by application of 20 μl of the reaction mixture onto a 1.5-cm2 piece of Whatman P81 phosphocellulose paper. Filter papers were washed in phosphoric acid (1% v/v) and the radioactivity quantitated in an LKB Wallac 1410 scintillation counter. 32P-Labeled GST-xPim-1 (by autophosphorylation) on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was visualized by autoradiography, excised from membrane, and chopped into 0.5-mm2 pieces. For phosphoamino acid analysis, membrane-bound protein was digested in 300 μl of constant boiling HCl at 105 °C for 1.5 h. The acid was removed, and the membrane was washed briefly with dH2O to remove residual amino acids. Water and acid were removed by evaporation in a vacuum centrifuge, and amino acids were sequentially washed and vacuum dried. Amino acids were redissolved in water/acetic acid/pyridine buffer (94.5/5/0.5 v/v/v) containing 1 mg/ml each of phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine standards. Phenol red (0.5% in buffer (w/v)) was spotted on the origin as a control. Approximately 2,000 cpm were spotted 2 cm from the bottom of a cellulose sheet (Kodak chromogram) and electrophoresed for 1.5 h at 750 volts until the phenol red spot had migrated 7–8 cm from the origin. The plate was air dried and sprayed with ninhydrin solution (0.25% in ethanol) and developed to visualize standards either by heating with a hairdryer or by baking in an oven at 90 °C for 5 min. X-ray film was exposed to the cellulose sheet for 18 h and subsequently developed. The full-length radiolabeled xPim-1 fusion protein was detected by autoradiography and excised from the gel for tryptic two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping (34Hutner W.B. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5402-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed on resolved phosphopeptides that were extracted from the cellulose plate with two washes of 200 μl of 20% acetonitrile (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and once with 200 μl of 60% acetonitrile, with sonication in a water bath sonicator for 5 min between extractions to break up the cellulose. Two samples of expressed GST-xPim-1 were prepared, with an estimated 4.2 mg of fusion protein bound to 5 mg of glutathione beads/sample. One sample was autophosphorylated in vitro with cold ATP, and the other was assumed to be autophosphorylated or phosphorylated in vivo. Both samples were washed extensively with thrombin buffer and digested with 10 μg of thrombin for 1 h at room temperature. After thrombinization, the slurries were poured into columns and the flow-through and eluate collected. The columns were washed with 2 volumes of thrombin buffer and the flow-through and eluate were concentrated in Centricon-10 tubes by sequential centrifugation and washes with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer. Once the volume of the Pim-1 was reduced to 100 μl, 10 μl of trypsin was added, and the sample was allowed to digest for 24 h at 37 °C, with constant agitation. Following tryptic digestion of the GST-xPim-1, the resultant phosphopeptides were analyzed by IMAC-HPLC-ESI-MS. Micro-IMAC-HPLC-ESI-MS was performed using instrumentation and protocols as detailed elsewhere (35Watts J.D. Affolter M. Krebs D.L. Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Aebersold R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29520-29529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were subjected to ESI-MS analysis on a PE Sciex (Thornhill, Ontario) APIIII triple quadruple mass spectrometer equipped with a pneumatically assisted ESI source (ion spray). The mass to charge ratio (m/z) was scanned repetitively over the range of 300–2,000. The output data from the mass spectrometer were analyzed with computer software provided with the machine. Mass spectra were displayed for observed peaks of ion detection events, and mass ranges from the data set could be extracted. Peptide masses were calculated based on computer matching of observed signals with the predictedm/z values for the various possible charge states of the same peptide and the theoretical fragmentation of the peptide sequence listing all possible fragments along with predicted charged mass values. Degenerate oligonucleotides based on the human pim-1 sequence were successfully used to amplify part of the pim-1 coding region from X. laeviscDNA. This pim-1 PCR fragment was used as a probe to detect and identify the amphibian cognate from an Xenopusoocyte cDNA library. The full-length Xenopus pim-1cDNA clones were approximately 2.7 kilobases in length, similar in size to that found in other species (25Meeker T.C. Nagarajan L. ar-Rushdi A. Croce C.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1987; 35: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 26Padma R. Nagarajan L. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2486-2489PubMed Google Scholar, 31Zakut-Houri R. Hazum S. Givol D. Telerman A.

A 969-base pair open reading frame was included in the 1,348 nucleotides sequenced, which specified a 323-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 36,970 daltons (Fig. 1). Xenopus Pim-1 (xPim-1) shares a high degree of amino acid sequence similarity with its mammalian counterparts (Fig. 1). The xPim-1 amino acid sequence has 86% overall homology and 65% overall identity with human Pim-1, with the regions of highest homology in the catalytic domain (71% identity). Although the xPim-1 NH2terminus shares 49% identity with human Pim-1, the two proteins only exhibit 15% identity within their COOH termini, and the amphibian Pim-1 is eight amino acids longer. xPim-1 was expressed as a bacterial fusion protein. Analysis by Western blotting demonstrated that the expected 549-amino acid, 63.3-kDa fusion protein was produced (Fig.2 A). Of the seven different Pim-1 antibodies tested, those that were developed against xPim-1 amino acid sequences gave the strongest signals on Western blots. Bacterial expression of GST-xPim-1 yielded a relatively pure preparation with few degradation products as shown by Amido Black staining (Fig. 2 B,lane 5), and the full-length fusion protein was the major species radiolabeled in an in vitro autophosphorylation reaction of GST-xPim-1 (Fig. 2 B, lane 7). However, the stoichiometry of autophosphorylation of GST-xPim-1 was less than 0.01 mol/mol; as discussed later this reflected substantial phosphorylation of the GST-xPim-1 in E. coli prior to cell lysis. Only the full-length GST-xPim-1 was analyzed in detail because thrombin cleavage yielded poor recoveries of phosphotransferase activity (>3%) and xPim-1 protein (data not shown). Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that GST-xPim-1 autophosphorylates primarily on serine and threonine residues and to a minor extent on tyrosine residues (Fig. 2 C). In vitroautophosphorylation of GST-Pim-1 on tyrosine was also demonstrated by detection by anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies on a Western blot (Fig. 2,lanes 9 and 10). Likewise, we observed that human GST-Pim-1 also autophosphorylates on phosphotyrosine by phosphoamino acid analysis and Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibod"
https://openalex.org/W2077332652,"Reconstitution of the tyrosyl radical in ribonucleotide reductase protein R2 requires oxidation of a diferrous site by oxygen. The reaction involves one externally supplied electron in addition to the three electrons provided by oxidation of the Tyr-122 side chain and formation of the μ-oxo-bridged diferric site. Reconstitution of R2 protein Y122F, lacking the internal pathway involving Tyr-122, earlier identified two radical intermediates at Trp-107 and Trp-111 in the vicinity of the di-iron site, suggesting a novel internal transfer pathway (Sahlin, M., Lassmann, G., Potsch, S., Sjoberg, B.-M., and Graslund, A. (1995)J. Biol. Chem.270, 12361–12372). Here, we report the construction of the double mutant W107Y/Y122F and its three-dimensional structure and demonstrate that the tyrosine Tyr-107 can harbor a transient, neutral radical (Tyr-107⋅). The Tyr-107⋅signal exhibits the hyperfine structure of a quintet with coupling constants of 1.3 mT for one β-methylene proton and 0.75 mT for each of the 3 and 5 hydrogens of the phenyl ring. Rapid freeze quench kinetics of EPR-visible intermediates reveal a preferred radical transfer pathway via Trp-111, Glu-204, and Fe-2, followed by a proton coupled electron transfer through the π-interaction of the aromatic rings of Trp-(Tyr-)107 and Trp-111. The kinetic pattern observed in W107Y/Y122F is considerably changed as compared with Y122F: the Trp-111⋅ EPR signal has vanished, and the Tyr-107⋅ has the same formation rate as does Trp-111⋅ in Y122F. According to the proposed consecutive reaction, Trp-111⋅ becomes very short lived and is no longer detectable because of the faster formation of Tyr-107⋅. We conclude that the phenyl rings of Trp-111 and Tyr-107 form a better stacking complex so that the proton-coupled electron transfer is facilitated compared with the single mutant. Comparison with the formation kinetics of the stable tyrosyl radical in wild type R2 suggests that these protein-linked radicals are substitutes for the missing Tyr-122. However, in contrast to Tyr-122⋅ these radicals lack a direct connection to the radical transfer pathway utilized during catalysis."

On the other hand, removal of IL-3 from cultures of BAF3 cells resulted in down-regulation of thymidine kinase activity, rapid imbalance in dNTP levels, and apoptosis. In this study we show that overexpression of a heterologous thymidine kinase, herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK), in BAF3 cells protects these cells from apoptosis induced by either inhibitors of dNTP synthesis or IL-3 deprivation. This protection against apoptosis is abrogated by 9-(4-hydroxybutyl)-N 2-phenylguanine, a specific inhibitor of herpes simplex virus-1 TK.

Cell population dynamics depend upon changes in the balance between cell proliferation and death. Transformed cells may be those that either proliferate in the absence of growth factors or fail to undergo apoptosis upon factor removal (1Liebermann D.A. Hoffman B. Steinman R.A. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 199-210PubMed Google Scholar). Tumor cells are susceptible to apoptosis, and certain therapeutic strategies for cancer have been developed to induce apoptosis. Indeed, a number of antineoplastic drugs and treatments exert their cytotoxic effect by inducing apoptosis (2Smets L.A. Anticancer Drugs. 1994; 5: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the drug and radiation resistance of many tumors can be ascribed to the failure of cancer cells to enter apoptosis due, for example, to mutations in p53 or deregulation of the expression of proteins of the bcl-2 family (1Liebermann D.A. Hoffman B. Steinman R.A. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 199-210PubMed Google Scholar, 3Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5407-5411PubMed Google Scholar). The maintenance of balanced dNTP 1The abbreviations used are: dNTP, deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate; IL-3, interleukin-3; FdUrd, 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine; HBPG, 9-(4-hydroxybutyl)-N 2-phenylguanine; HSV, herpes simplex virus; TK, thymidine kinase; HU, hydroxyurea; MTX, methotrexate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: dNTP, deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate; IL-3, interleukin-3; FdUrd, 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine; HBPG, 9-(4-hydroxybutyl)-N 2-phenylguanine; HSV, herpes simplex virus; TK, thymidine kinase; HU, hydroxyurea; MTX, methotrexate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. pools is critical for DNA replication and repair; under normal culture conditions, it is mainly achieved by regulation of the activity of enzymes of the de novo pathway of synthesis of dNTPs (4Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Whereas moderate perturbation of dNTP pools affects genetic stability of cells (5Mathews C.K. Ji J. BioEssays. 1992; 14: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), with the appearance of frequent mutations (6Bradley M.O. Sharkey N.A. Nature. 1978; 274: 707-709Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and strand breaks (7Brox L. Ng A. Pollock E. Belch A. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 934-940PubMed Google Scholar), severe imbalance of dNTP pools causes cell death (8Yoshioka A. Tanaka S. Hiraoka O. Koyama Y. Hirota Y. Ayusawa D. Seno T. Garrett C. Wataya Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8235-8241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several antineoplastic agents that inhibit DNA precursor synthesis have been reported to kill lymphoid cells by induction of apoptosis (3Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5407-5411PubMed Google Scholar), and inherited deficiencies in enzymes such as adenosine deaminase and purine nucleoside phosphorylase, which produce imbalanced accumulation of dNTPs, result in lymphoid cell death (9Martin D.W. Gelfand E.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 845-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Previous results from our laboratory have shown that inhibition of thymidylate synthase (an enzyme of the de novo synthesis of dNTP) with 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine, which perturbs deoxyribonucleotide metabolism, drives the IL-3-dependent cell line BAF3 to enter apoptosis even in the presence of IL-3 (10Oliver F.J. Marvel J. Collins M.K.L. López-Rivas A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Furthermore, removal of IL-3 from BAF3 cell cultures leads to an early imbalance in dNTP pools during apoptosis (11Oliver F.J. Collins M.K.L. López-Rivas A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In addition to the de novo pathway for dNTP synthesis, mammalian cells, in particular those of the immune system, contain kinase activities for deoxyribonucleosides (4Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). These salvage enzymes function in the reutilization of degradation products from nucleic acids or precursors from the extracellular medium. Thymidine kinase is perhaps the best characterized of these enzymes; its substrates are thymidine and deoxyuridine, and it is inhibited by dTTP (4Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). It has been used as a malignancy marker for a variety of tumors (12Yusa T. Yamaguchi Y. Ohwada H. Hayashi Y. Morita T. Asanagi M. Moriyama I. Fujimura S. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 5001-5006PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hallek M. Wanders L. Strohmeyer S. Emmerich B. Ann. Hematol. 1992; 65: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and tumor cells deficient in this enzyme show a lower oncogenic potential than the wild-type cells from which they derive (14Rothschild H. Black P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 67: 1042-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Moreover, a recent report has also demonstrated that TK is a major radioresponse determinant in rat glioma cells (15Al-Nabulsi I. Takayima Y. Volishin Y. Dritschilo A. Martuza R.L. Jorgensen T. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5614-5617PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that this reutilization pathway, acting in a concerted manner with other salvage enzymes and the de novopathway, could also regulate intracellular levels of dNTPs (4Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) and protect cells from apoptosis (16Koury M.J. Horne D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4067-4071Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 17Curtin N.J. Harris A.L. Aherne G.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2346-2352PubMed Google Scholar, 18Van Mouwerick T.J. Pangallo C.A. Willson J.K. Fisher P.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the potentiation of this salvage pathway either by the supply of dNTP precursors or by overexpression of a heterologous TK (HSV-1 TK) delays programmed cell death induced by IL-3 deprivation and drugs that inhibit dNTP metabolism in BAF3 cells. RPMI 1640 medium and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Methotrexate was from Cyanamid Iberica, Division Lederle. Deoxy[8-3H]ATP (24 Ci/mmol), deoxy[8-3H]GTP (16.9 Ci/mmol), deoxy[5-3H]CTP (18 Ci/mmol), and [methyl-3H]thymidine (49 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham. [methyl-3H]TTP (40 Ci/mmol) was purchased from ICN Biochemicals. Synthetic DNA templates, 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine, hydroxyurea, and other reagents of the purest grade available were obtained from Sigma and Boehringer Mannheim. The HSV-1 TK inhibitor 9-(4-hydroxybutyl)-N 2-phenylguanine (HBPG) was kindly provided by Dr. George E. Wright (University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA). Murine IL-3-dependent BAF3 cells (19Palacios R. Steimetz M. Cell. 1985; 41: 727-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) were maintained in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mmglutamine, and 10% conditioned medium from the IL-3-producing cell line Wehi-3B. For transient expression experiments, BAF3 cells were transfected with HSV1-TK cDNA cloned into MFG-S plasmid (Somatix) or with a control cDNA (the neomycin-resistance gene,neo) by electroporation of 10–20 μg of DNA at 350 V or alternatively by lipofection with 5 μg of Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 2.5 μg of DNA. Cells were cultured in the presence of IL-3 for 24–48 h, and thymidine kinase activity was measured. For stable expression of HSV thymidine kinase activity, cells were cotransfected by electroporation with the previous TK cDNA and a plasmid conferring resistance to puromycin, pBabe Puro (20Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1879) Google Scholar). Puromycin was added at 4 μg/ml to the cultures to select cells expressing resistance to this marker. Analysis of DNA fragmentation and cell cycle were performed according to published procedures (21Collins M.K.L. Marvel J. Malde P. López-Rivas A. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 176: 1043-1051Crossref Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Preparation of cell extracts was essentially as described (22Lindberg U. Skoog L. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 34: 152-160Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar). dNTPs were determined by the DNA polymerase assay (23North T.W. Bestwick R.K. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6640-6645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a synthetic DNA template and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase. The intracellular concentrations of dNTP were estimated from calibration curves obtained using pure standards. Cells were pelleted and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. The pellet was then resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 20 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, subjected to Dounce homogenization, and sonicated to completely disrupt the cells. The extract was cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation, and the remaining supernatant containing a minimum of 2 mg of protein/ml was assayed for TK activity essentially as described (24Chang Z.-F. Huang D.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1266-1271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The statistical significance of the data was determined after applying Student's t test. Dihydrofolate reductase and ribonucleotide reductase catalyze key steps in the de novo production of dNTPs. Inhibitors of these enzymes, such as methotrexate (MTX) and hydroxyurea (HU), are commonly used in antineoplastic treatment, and they also induce apoptosis in hemopoietic BAF3 cells even in the presence of IL-3 (10Oliver F.J. Marvel J. Collins M.K.L. López-Rivas A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). After 8 h of treatment with either drug, loss of cell viability, as assessed by cell membrane integrity, was not observed (Fig. 1 A); however, at this time DNA was digested into oligonucleosome-sized fragments (Fig. 1 B). Cell death could be clearly observed after 15 h of treatment with either inhibitor. Addition of deoxyribonucleosides to the medium facilitates dNTP synthesis; these precursors are transported by a nonspecific permease across the cell membrane and modified by the action of deoxyribonucleosides kinases to generate dNTP pools (4Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar), thus bypassing the de novo synthesis pathway. The presence of 50 μm thymidine in the culture medium completely prevented the appearance of the sub-G1 peak of apoptotic cells in cultures of BAF3 cells treated with MTX for 15 h (Fig.1 C) and inhibited DNA fragmentation and cell death (data not shown). Inhibition of HU-induced apoptosis was achieved by incubating the cells with 1 μm deoxyadenosine and 100 μm deoxyguanosine (Fig. 1 C). This precursor combination was used in the study of Lagergren and Reichard (25Lagergren J. Reichard P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 2985-2991Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), in which it reversed the inhibition of DNA synthesis by HU. These data suggest that salvage enzymes involved in the phosphorylation of these precursors are probably important in the maintenance of dNTP balance and the inhibition of cell death (17Curtin N.J. Harris A.L. Aherne G.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2346-2352PubMed Google Scholar, 18Van Mouwerick T.J. Pangallo C.A. Willson J.K. Fisher P.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A similar role of this salvage pathway has been demonstrated in erythroblasts from mice with experimental folate deficiency anemia, in which the addition of thymidine is sufficient to protect cells from apoptosis (16Koury M.J. Horne D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4067-4071Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To determine the role of TK activity in the regulation of apoptosis, we have examined the effect of overexpressing heterologous HSV-1 TK (26Honess R.W. Watson D.H. J. Gen. Virol. 1974; 22: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) on the entry of cells into apoptosis after IL-3 withdrawal or drug treatment. Initially, we transiently expressed HSV-1 TK in BAF3 cells and determined both the level of TK activity and apoptosis in bulk-transfected cells. Bulk-transfected cell populations were deprived of IL-3 for 24 h, and viability was measured at this time. The results from eight independent transfection experiments are shown in Fig. 2 A; a correlation was found between the level of expression of TK activity and protection from cell death. Whereas cell viability decreased to 20% in control (vector-transfected) cells, transfection of HSV-1 TK resulted in up to 83% viable cells after IL-3 deprivation. These trypan blue-excluding cells in the HSV-1 TK-transfected cultures were viable because they were able to grow in response to IL-3, with a generation time similar to that of cells not subjected to IL-3 withdrawal (data not shown). We next determined whether stable HSV-1 TK expression could inhibit apoptosis. By transfecting BAF3 cells with the HSV-1 TK cDNA, several clones were generated that expressed high levels of TK activity. From these clones, clone TK2 was chosen because it did not release any soluble factor to the culture media to allow cell survival in the absence of IL-3, which would mask the effect of TK overexpression. Cell viability in a control clone expressing only resistance to puromycin (puro3) decreased to less than 30% after 24 h in the absence of IL-3, and there was a complete loss of cell viability after 48 h of cytokine deprivation (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, viability of TK2 cells was maintained at values higher than 90 and 30% after 24 and 48 h of IL-3 withdrawal, respectively (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, the clone overexpressing HSV-1 TK was able to maintain TK activity after deprivation of IL-3, in contrast to what was observed in puro3 cells (data not shown) and parental BAF3 cells (11Oliver F.J. Collins M.K.L. López-Rivas A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We have also determined the effect of HSV-1 TK overexpression on the viability of cells treated with inhibitors of dNTP metabolism such as MTX and FdUrd, which rapidly deplete the cells of dTTP. Results in Fig. 3 Aand B show that cells overexpressing HSV-1 TK are more resistant to cell death induced by increasing doses of FdUrd or MTX. We also measured intracellular dNTP levels after MTX treatment or IL-3 withdrawal in control and HSV-1 TK-transfected cells. The dNTP pools in untreated cultures from both cell types were not significantly different (Fig. 4, legend), but the cell response to an antimetabolite drug or IL-3 deprivation was markedly different (Fig.4). Control cells treated for 3 h with 5 μm MTX exhibited a 66% decrease in dTTP and dGTP levels, whereas dATP and dCTP remained unchanged. In IL-3 deprivation experiments, the levels of dATP, dGTP, and dTTP after 8 h in the absence of IL-3 decreased to about 40–50% of the initial levels, whereas the dCTP level was only slightly changed, as reported previously (11Oliver F.J. Collins M.K.L. López-Rivas A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in cells overexpressing HSV-1 TK, treatment with MTX had no effect on the intracellular dATP, dGTP, and dTTP levels and had little effect on the dCTP pool (67% of the level found in untreated cells). Furthermore, removal of IL-3 from these cells did not induce a decrease in the values of all four dNTPs, showing a general maintenance of dNTP levels as a result of TK overexpression. Although one would have expected only the dTTP level to be maintained in HSV TK-overexpressing cells, allosteric activation of ribonucleotide reductase by dTTP might be responsible for the elevated pool of dGTP, which in turn can stimulate the reduction of ADP to dADP (27Thelander L. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 133-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). Earlier reports have shown that introduction of herpes virus DNA into TK-deficient cells was able per se to alter the sensitivity to β-interferon, irrespective of the acquisition of TK activity (28Lewis J.A. Esteban M. Virology. 1984; 133: 464-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar,29Lewis J.A. Mengheri E. Esteban M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To rule out this possibility in our experiments, we took advantage of a recently characterized specific inhibitor of HSV-1 TK (30Xu H. Maga G. Focher F. Smith E.R. Spadari S. Gambino J. Wright G.E. J. Med. Chem. 1984; 38: 49-57Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This compound, HBPG, did not inhibit cellular TK activity as assayedin vitro on cell extracts from control cells and had no effect on [3H]thymidine incorporation in growing cells (data not shown). Fig. 5 A shows that HBPG did not affect the cell viability of control cells in either the presence or absence of IL-3. However, in clones overexpressing HSV-1 TK, 10 μm HBPG produced a 67% inhibition of the TK activity present in cell extracts from these cells (data not shown). In these cells, the inhibitor did not induce apoptosis in the presence of IL-3 (Fig. 5 B). However, in IL-3-deprived TK-transfected cells, HBPG significantly reduced cell viability (Fig. 5 B) and induced a sub-G1 population of apoptotic cells (Fig.5 D) to values similar to those of control cells (Fig. 5,A and D). The inhibition of viral TK by HBPG also increased the sensitivity of TK2 cells to FdUrd and MTX as determined by measuring cell viability (Fig. 5 C) or by the generation of sub-G1 cells in cell cycle analysis experiments (Fig.5 D). In summary, these results indicated that the protection from apoptosis in cells overexpressing HSV-1 TK was the direct outcome of the presence of the viral TK activity and not a consequence of the introduction of viral DNA. Whereas many intracellular signals are known to decline after removal of IL-3 from dependent cells (31Whetton D. Dexter T.M. Nature. 1983; 30: 639-642Google Scholar, 32Linnekin D. Farrar W.L. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 33Whetton A.D. Vallance S.J. Monk P.N. Cragoe E.J. Dexter T.M. Heyworth C.M. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 585-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), only overexpression of oncogenes such as myc (34Askew D.S. Ashmun R. Simmons B.C. Cleveland J.L. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1915-1922PubMed Google Scholar) or bcl-2 (21Collins M.K.L. Marvel J. Malde P. López-Rivas A. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 176: 1043-1051Crossref Scopus (215) Google Scholar), activators of theras pathway (35Sato N. Sakamaki K. Terada N. Arai K. Mikayima A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4181-4189Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 36Perkins G.R. Marshall C.J. Collins M.K.L. Blood. 1996; 87: 3669-3675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or activated abl kinase (37McGahon A. Bissonnette R. Schmitt M. Cotter K.M. Green D.R. Cotter T.G. Blood. 1994; 83: 1179-1187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has previously been shown to modulate apoptosis. Our data demonstrate that a single enzyme involved in nucleotide metabolism can exert a similar effect, which suggests that regulation of the dNTP supply may be a control point in apoptosis. Although mammalian TK expression is cell cycle-regulated, with peak gene expression occurring immediately before entry into S-phase (38Adler R. McAuslan B.R. Cell. 1974; 2 (, 1974): 113-117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we have demonstrated that IL-3 also regulates TK activity posttranslationally (11Oliver F.J. Collins M.K.L. López-Rivas A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Serum has also been shown to regulate the phosphorylation state and activity of TK in HL-60 cells (24Chang Z.-F. Huang D.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1266-1271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The vector used in our transfection experiments constitutively expresses HSV TK throughout the cell cycle, and the viral TK does not seem to be down-regulated after withdrawal of IL-3, resulting in increased TK activity even in the absence of IL-3. Under normal culture conditions, the viability and growth of cells do not seem to require the uptake of exogenous deoxynucleosides unless the endogenous synthesis of dNTP has been inhibited by treatment with drugs (17Curtin N.J. Harris A.L. Aherne G.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2346-2352PubMed Google Scholar, 18Van Mouwerick T.J. Pangallo C.A. Willson J.K. Fisher P.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This is because most culture media contain high levels of folic acid, which allows the continued synthesis of tetrahydrofolate derivatives required for the synthesis of nucleotides and particularly of thymidylate. However, in culture media containing concentrations of folic acid comparable to the serum levels, the growth of cells is dependent on the supply of exogenous thymidine, and therefore, under these conditions, TK activity should play an important role in the pathway leading to dTTP formation for DNA synthesis and repair (39Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Rozengurt E. Exp. Cell Res. 1979; 119: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Therefore, in cells such as hemopoietic BAF3 cells that are strictly dependent on growth factors for cell viability and proliferation, regulation of TK activity by IL-3 (11Oliver F.J. Collins M.K.L. López-Rivas A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) could be an important event in the maintenance of balanced dNTP pools when the extracellular concentration of folic acid is comparable with that of serum. Due to the complexity of dNTP metabolism and the multiple allosteric mechanisms involved in this metabolism, at present it is difficult to identify the critical variable that induces apoptosis during dNTP pool imbalances. The fact that inhibition of one specific pathway such as that leading to de novo dTTP synthesis might influence the formation of other dNTPs (27Thelander L. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 133-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar) makes it difficult to propose a more specific model. The mechanism by which viral TK overexpression might protect cells from IL-3 removal or dNTP synthesis inhibitors is probably related to the increased capacity of the cell to maintain dNTP pools for DNA repair and synthesis (40Kit S. Leung W.-C. Trkula D. Jorgensen G. Int. J. Cancer. 1974; 13: 203-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). dNTP pool balance has been shown to be essential for fidelity in DNA synthesis in dividing cells (4Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). In BAF3 cells, IL-3 withdrawal does not result in cell cycle arrest (21Collins M.K.L. Marvel J. Malde P. López-Rivas A. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 176: 1043-1051Crossref Scopus (215) Google Scholar), thus DNA synthesis is probably taking place in cells with imbalanced dNTP pools. In other cells, promotion of entry into S-phase by disregulated myc (41Evan G.I. Wyllie A.H. Gilbert C.S. Littlewood T.D. Land H. Brooks M. Waters C.M. Penn L.Z. Hancock D.C. Cell. 1992; 69: 119-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar) or E2F (42Shan B. Lee W.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8166-8173Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) expression in the absence of growth factors also induces apoptosis. It has been previously shown that nucleotide misincorporation during DNA replication and repair under limiting metabolic conditions (43Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4946-4950Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) may serve as a signal to initiate a death program (8Yoshioka A. Tanaka S. Hiraoka O. Koyama Y. Hirota Y. Ayusawa D. Seno T. Garrett C. Wataya Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8235-8241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to avoid the appearance of genetic variants with chromosomal abnormalities. Although the dNTP pool imbalances observed in BAF3 cells may not be sufficiently large to induce an important increase in replication error rates, it is possible to speculate that small changes in DNA replication accuracy or misincorporation of uracil residues into DNA might activate genes that are important for the execution of apoptosis (8Yoshioka A. Tanaka S. Hiraoka O. Koyama Y. Hirota Y. Ayusawa D. Seno T. Garrett C. Wataya Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8235-8241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or induce the accumulation of proteins such as p53 that trigger the apoptotic program (44Almasan A. Yin Y. Kelly R.E. Lee E.Y.-H.P. Bradley A. Li W. Bertino J.R. Wahl G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5436-5440Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Cells lacking TK activity have been shown to have a lower rate of DNA synthesis, a longer generation time (45Höglund L. Pontis E. Reichard P. Cancer Res. 1987; 48 (, 1987): 3681-3690Google Scholar), and an increased sensitivity to DNA alkylating agents (46Wakazono Y. Kubota M. Furusho K. Liu L. Gerson S.L. Mutat. Res. 1996; 362: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) that is probably related to their inability to maintain dTTP pools. These agents are also potent inducers of apoptosis (47Schreiber V. Hunting D. Trucco C. Gowans B. Grunwald D. de Murcia G. Ménissier de Murcia J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 11: 4753-4757Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Our results raise the hypothesis that regulation of TK activity by growth factors, and therefore the cellular dNTP levels, could be a checkpoint to signal proliferating cells whether to continue the progression through the cell cycle or to enter a program of cell death by apoptosis. Deregulated expression of cellular TK activity has been reported to be correlated with tumorigenicity (12Yusa T. Yamaguchi Y. Ohwada H. Hayashi Y. Morita T. Asanagi M. Moriyama I. Fujimura S. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 5001-5006PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hallek M. Wanders L. Strohmeyer S. Emmerich B. Ann. Hematol. 1992; 65: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and cell resistance to radiation (15Al-Nabulsi I. Takayima Y. Volishin Y. Dritschilo A. Martuza R.L. Jorgensen T. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5614-5617PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, viral TK could be an apoptosis-inhibiting factor during productive or latent infection of cells with herpes simplex virus, acting perhaps in a concerted manner with the viral proteins γ34.5 and ICP4, recently described as inhibitors of apoptosis (48Leopardi R.

https://openalex.org/W1969638791,"A cell wall component of a smooth variant ofGordona hydrophobica 1775/15 was isolated and purified, and its structure was determined by various chemical methods, including chemical synthesis of part structures, Edman degradation, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-post-source decay (MALDI-PSD) tandem mass spectrometry, and 1H and 13C NMR using one- and two-dimensional, homo- and heteronuclear correlated spectroscopy. The cell wall component was found to be a (mono-) glycosylated peptidolipid (GPL) consisting of a tridecapeptide interlinked by a β-hydroxylated fatty acid (3-hydroxyeicosanoic acid, 20:0 (3-OH)) to form a cyclic lactone ring structure. The main fraction of GPL, for which we propose the name gordonin, was identified as 3-hydroxyeicosanoyl-l-seryl-l-phenylalanyl-l-seryl-l-seryl-d-alanyl-l-(O-β-d-glucopyranosyl)-threonyl-glycyl-d-leucyl-l-valyl-l-seryl-l-phenylalanyl-glycyl-l-valyl lactone. The other GPLs constitute structural variations within the nature of the β-hydroxylated fatty acid (20:0(3-OH)versus 22:1(3-OH)) in a ratio of about 1:0.9 as well as within one amino acid (d-Leu versus l-Phe) in about 30%. Sequence information was obtained in part by Edman degradation as well as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis of di- and tripeptide fragments. However, the complete amino acid sequence could only be established by MALDI-PSD from the linear molecule, i.e. after ring opening of the lactone.In contrast, rough variants of G. hydrophobica 1775/15 lack these peptidolipids or synthesize them to a much lesser extent indicating that gordonin contributes significantly to the physicochemical character of the cell surface.

Biofiltration is the method of choice for the treatment of waste gases with high volumes and low concentrations of organic pollutants. This technology requires low investment and operation costs and guarantees high reliability. Although biofiltration is already widely used, knowledge about the biology underlying this technology is lacking. Only a few studies have so far been conducted on the microorganisms involved in the process of exhaust-air treatment. Recently, Bendinger et al. (1Bendinger B. Kroppenstedt R.M. Klatte S. Altendorf K. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1992; 42: 474-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) isolated coryneform bacteria from a biofilter that was loaded with the waste gas from an animal-rendering plant. On the basis of chemotaxonomic differentiation they were able to identify strains of the genusCorynebacterium, Gordona,Mycobacterium, and Arthrobacter. Some biofilter isolates of Gordona hydrophobica (2Bendinger B. Rainey F.A. Kroppenstedt R.M. Moormann M. Klatte S. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1995; 45: 544-548Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar) showed colony morphologies, which gave rise to different physicochemical properties of their cell surface. The rough variants possess an extremely hydrophobic cell surface due to a hydrophobic mycolic acid layer. In contrast, the smooth variants exhibit a hydrophilic to moderate hydrophobic surface (3Bendinger B. Rijnaarts H.H.M. Altendorf K. Zehnder A.J.B. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 3973-3977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although they are also surrounded by a hydrophobic mycolic acid layer. Obviously, the smooth ones incorporate into their cell wall an additional surface component, which exposes its hydrophilic part toward the medium. The observation that rough colonies of Gordona only gave rise to rough colonies whereas smooth colonies gave rise to smooth as well as rough ones when grown on complex media indicated that the rough variants lost the ability to cover their extremely hydrophobic surface with a more hydrophilic compound. A similar change in colony morphology was reported for mycobacterial species that are closely related to the genus Gordona. Camphausen et al. (4Camphausen R.T. McNeil M. Jardine I. Brennan P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 5473-5480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found a trehalose containing lipooligosaccharide to be responsible for the observed change inMycobacterium paratuberculosis. Fregnan et al.(5Fregnan G.B. Smith D.W. Randall H.M. J. Bacteriol. 1962; 83: 828-836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that smooth variants of an unclassified scotochromogenicMycobacterium possessed a mycoside D that is absent in the rough variants. However, Barrow and Brennan (6Barrow W.W. Brennan P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 150: 381-384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) pointed out that mycoside D is likely to be a mixture of polar and apolar C mycoside glycopeptidolipids (GPLs). 1The abbreviations used are: GPL, glycosylated peptidolipid; GC/MS, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry; MALDI-PSD, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization post source decay; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; TOF-SIMS, time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry; GLC, gas-liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: GPL, glycosylated peptidolipid; GC/MS, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry; MALDI-PSD, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization post source decay; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; TOF-SIMS, time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry; GLC, gas-liquid chromatography. Belisle and Brennan (7Belisle J.T. Brennan P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3465-3470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the smooth variants of Mycobacterium kansasii possess trehalose-containing lipooligosaccharides, whereas the rough variants were devoid of such surface components. Such a change of morphology within the nocardioform actinomycetes has so far only been described for mycobacteria and not for other members of this taxon. Therefore, it was of interest to establish whether the morphological change observed with G. hydrophobica was due to the loss of mycosides or lipooligosaccharides or whether a different cell wall component is responsible for the more hydrophilic cell surface. Our studies revealed that the smooth variant of G. hydrophobica carries an additional glycosylated peptidolipid, which we named gordonin. Such peptidolipids have been described as surfactants or antibiotics (8Aydin, M., Lucht, N., König, W. A., Lupp, R., Jung, G., and Winkelmann, G. (1985) Liebigs Ann. Chem. 2285–2300.Google Scholar, 9Nakajima M. Inukai M. Haneishi T. Terahara S. Arai M. Kinoshita T. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1978; 31: 426-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 10Arima K.

Gordona bronchialis DSM 43247T andGordona rubropertinctus DSM 43197T were obtained from the Deutsche Sammlung für Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH (DSM), Braunschweig, Germany. The isolation and classification ofG. hydrophobica DSM 44015T has been published previously (1Bendinger B. Kroppenstedt R.M. Klatte S. Altendorf K. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1992; 42: 474-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 2Bendinger B. Rainey F.A. Kroppenstedt R.M. Moormann M. Klatte S. Int. J. Syst.

A detailed description of chemotaxonomical and physiological markers of G. hydrophobica DSM 44015Tr (=1610/1b), G. hydrophobica DSM 44015Ts (=1610/1a), G. hydrophobica 1775/15r andG. hydrophobica 1775/15s has been published (1Bendinger B. Kroppenstedt R.M. Klatte S. Altendorf K. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1992; 42: 474-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (s = smooth variants, r = rough variants). G. hydrophobica 1775/15s was cultivated in 2 liters of brain-heart infusion broth (Difco) at 30 °C (pH 7.4) for 3–4 days. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation (3000 ×g, 30 min), washed twice with deionized water, and lyophilized. 2 g of lyophilized cells were extracted twice with 60 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, by volume) and once with chloroform/methanol (1:1, by volume). 40 ml of chloroform and 40 ml of 0.3% NaCl were added to the combined extracts. After gentle shaking the phases were separated by centrifugation (3000 × g, 20 min). The organic phase was evaporated to dryness on a rotary evaporator, and the pellet was redissolved in 50 ml of chloroform. This fraction was applied to a DEAE-cellulose column (20 × 2 cm) that was equilibrated with chloroform. The column was washed with chloroform, and gordonin was eluted with chloroform/methanol (9:1, by volume). The eluate was evaporated to dryness by rotary evaporation, and the pellet was redissolved in 30 ml of chloroform/methanol/glacial acetic acid/water (186:34:5:3). It was further purified by column chromatography (50 × 1 cm) on silica gel 60 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Gordonin was eluted by a linear gradient of chloroform/methanol/glacial acetic acid/water (186:34:5:3) as solvent A and chloroform/methanol/glacial acetic acid/water (90:40:15:9) as solvent B. The gordonin-containing fractions were collected and dried by rotary evaporation. 2–5 μg of a sample were dissolved in an appropriate solvent and spotted on a silica 60-plate (Merck). Plates were developed in chloroform/glacial acetic acid/methanol/water (80:15:12:4). After drying, lipids were detected by wetting the plate with 20% sulfuric acid in ethanol and heating (120 °C) for 2–5 min. Sugar residues were detected by spraying the plate with 0.1% orcinol in 40% sulfuric acid followed by heating at 120 °C for 15 min. For detection of amino groups, plates were sprayed with ninhydrin solution (Riedel de Haen, Seelze, Germany) and heated at 100 °C for 10 min. An aliquot (2 mg) of gordonin was methanolyzed with either 0.5m HCl/MeOH (65 °C, 45 min) or 2 m HCl in methanol (85 °C, 16 h) followed by per-acetylation. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) of resulting fragments of gordonin was carried out with a Hewlett-Packard model 5985 instrument. GLC was performed with a Varian model 3700 chromatograph equipped with a capillary column of SPB-5 using a temperature gradient 150–320 °C at 5 °C/min. GLC-MS was carried out with a Hewlett-Packard model 5989 instrument equipped with a capillary column of HP-1 under the same chromatographic conditions as in GLC. Electron impact spectra were recorded at 70 keV, and chemical ionization was done using ammonia as reactant gas. 1 mg of gordonin was dissolved in 500 μl of 100 mmsodium methylate and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. After neutralization with 2 m HCl in methanol the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure, and the saponified gordonin was dissolved in chloroform. The precipitated NaCl was discarded. An aliquot (100 μg) of gordonin was methanolyzed with 2m HCl in methanol (85 °C, 16 h). GC/MS of the resulting fragments was carried out with a Hewlett-Packard model 5890 series II gas chromatograph equipped with a capillary column of HP-5 (0.25 mm × 30 m) and a Hewlett-Packard model 5972 MSD. The temperature gradient was 120–300 °C at 5 °C/min. Electron impact spectra were recorded at 70 keV. Fatty acid methyl esters were identified by comparison of retention times and mass spectra using standards from Sigma (Germany). Gordonin was hydrolyzed in a gas-phase hydrolyzer with 6m HCl at 150 °C for 1–4 h. The amino acid composition was analyzed with a ABI type 421 amino acid analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA). 100 nmol gordonin were hydrolyzed as described above. The separation of enantiomeric amino acids was achieved after derivatization withN α-(2,4-dinitro-5-fluorophenyl)-l-alaninamide. Derivatization was performed as described (11Kochhar S. Christen P. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 178: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Amino acid derivatives were separated at 50 °C by HPLC on a C18 reversed-phase column (Hewlett-Packard ODS Hypersil, 5 μm, 250 × 4 mm) fitted with a LiChrospher®100 RP-18 guard column (5 μm, 4 × 4 mm). The separation was achieved by a linear gradient of 50 mm triethylaminophosphate, pH 2.9 (buffer A), and acetonitrile (buffer B). The gradient increased from 15 to 50% buffer B in 35 min. The flow rate was 500 μl/min and amino acid derivatives were detected at 340 nm. Peaks were recorded and quantified with the Hewlett-Packard 3D Chem Station software. For the synthesis of [(R)-3-hydroxytetradecanamido]-d-valine methyl ester (2), 24 mg (0.1 mmol) of optically pure (R)-3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid (14:0(3-OH)) were dissolved in 6 ml of 1,2-dimethoxyethane (Fluka), and 10 mg (0.9 mmol) ofN-hydroxysuccinimide (Aldrich) and 29 mg ofN,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (0.14 mmol, Sigma) were added to the solution. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 36 h at 4 °C, and precipitating material was removed by filtration. The solution was evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen, and the product was dissolved in 1 ml of pyridine. 10 mg ofd-valine methyl ester (freshly prepared fromd-valine (Sigma) and diazomethane in ether) were added to the solution, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h at room temperature. The product (2) was applied to a small silica gel column (0.5 × 5 cm, Kiesel gel 60, 230–400 mesh, Merck) and stepwise eluted with ether/hexane (10:90, by volume), chloroform, chloroform/methanol (95:5 and 90:10, by volume). The product (2) eluted in the chloroform fraction (yield 3 mg, 0.01 mmol, 10%) and was further characterized by GC/MS and NMR spectroscopy. (R)-3-O-[2-N-(Acetamido)-d-valinoxy]-tetradecanoic acid methyl ester (3) was synthesized starting from 15 mg ofd-Val (0.1 mmol) that were N-acetylated as described (12Hase S. Rietschel E.Th. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 63: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To the resulting 2-N-(acetamido)-d-valine, 1 ml of trifluoroacetic acid anhydride was added, and the reaction was kept at 40 °C for 24 h. After removal of trifluoroacetic acid anhydride under a stream of nitrogen, 5 mg (0.02 mmol) of (R)-3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid methyl ester were added together with 0.55 ml of pyridine containing catalytic amounts of 2,6-dimethylaminopyridine. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 16 h at 85 °C. GC/MS analysis revealed that the product obtained was (R)-3-O-[2-N-(trifluoroacetamido)-d-valinoxy]-tetradecanoic acid methyl ester from which the N-trifluoroacetamido residue was removed by treatment with 0.25 ml of methanol/water (4:1, by volume) at room temperature. After the product was dried in vacuo, it was dissolved in 1 ml of pyridine/acetanhydride (2:1, by volume) thus yielding the desired (R)-3-O-[2-N-(acetamido)-d-valinoxy]-tetradecanoic acid methyl ester (3), which was purified on a small silica gel column as mentioned above (yield 3 mg, 0.01 mmol, 50%). Gordonin was partially hydrolyzed with 2 m HCl (90 °C, 2–4 h) or with 12 m HCl (37 °C, 4 days). The hydrolysates were purified by C18 reversed-phase HPLC. The main peaks (monitored at 220 nm) were collected and analyzed with a peptide sequencer ABI 476A (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA). Since peptides resulting from the hydrolysis were short and hydrophobic, an arylamine-modified membrane (Sequelon AA; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) was used to covalently bind the carboxyl-terminal amino acid. Partial hydrolysis of gordonin was carried out after saponification as described above. Preparation of trifluoroacetylated peptide esters was performed as described elsewhere (13König, W. A., Engelfried, C., Hagenmaier, H., and Kneifel, H. (1976) Liebigs Ann. Chem. 2011–2020.Google Scholar). The resulting trifluoroacetyl peptide methyl esters were identified by performing gas chromatography-mass spectrometry using a Hewlett-Packard model 5890 series II gas chromatograph equipped with a 5% phenyl methyl silicone capillary column (0.25 mm by 30 m) and a model 5972 mass selective detector. Helium was used as carrier gas; the injection volume was 5 μl, and the injector temperature was 250 °C. Split was set at 1:37. The initial column temperature was 70 °C, which was held for 2 min and than increased to 300 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry transfer line temperature was 280 °C. The TOF-SIMS determinations were carried out with a TOF II instrument developed at the University of Münster (14Niehuis E. Heller T. Feld H. Benninghoven A. J. Vac. Sci. Technol. 1987; 5: 1243-1246Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). It consists of a primary ion source with a pulsed 90° deflector, a reflectron TOF analyzer, and a single ion counting registration system. The primary ions generated by the ion source bombard the surface as short mass separated ion packets (0.8 ns, 10 keV Ar+) in an area of about 70 nm diameter. The generated secondary ions are accelerated to 1.8 keV, mass-separated in a field free flight path, and then detected with an ion electron-photon conversion system. For the insulating surfaces, the instrument is equipped with a charge compensation system, which consists of an electron flood gun producing low energy electrons. For TOF-SIMS determinations gordonin was dissolved in chloroform/methanol/glacial acetic acid/water (80:12:15:4) at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml and deposited on a clean silver support. MALDI specimens were prepared by dissolving 50–200 pmol of the analyte in 10 μl of chloroform/glacial acetic acid/methanol/water (80:15:12:4). To this solution 10 μl of acetone saturated with 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid was added. A 5–10-μl aliquot of this mixture was pipetted on the surface of a slightly preheated sample holder, on which the solvent evaporated within a few seconds. Transfer of the sample into the instrument was performed as quickly as possible. The TOF-mass spectrometer is a reflectron-type instrument employing a gridded two-stage reflectron at the end of a first field drift path of 204 cm in length. Its second field drift path (reflectron to detector) extends over 175 cm. Standard acceleration voltage in this instrument is 10 kV. For ion detection a 75-mm diameter dual microchannel plate is employed. The ion source in the instrument is a coaxial optical/ion optical device which simultaneously serves for laser focusing, sample imaging, and optical beam collimation, all in a common axis strictly perpendicular to the surface plane of the sample. The acceleration stage is a split device (2/6 mm) with the option to apply delayed extraction conditions. This means that desorbed ions are initially (for 50–500 μs) allowed to expand against a slightly retarding field before the accelerating field is turned on (fast HV switch). If the delay time and the ratio of field strength in the two acceleration stages are properly chosen (settings dependent on the mass range of interest), so-called velocity focusing conditions can be fulfilled, resulting in a dramatic improvement of mass resolution. In the present investigation delay times between the desorption pulse and the onset of the extraction field of 230–440 μs were chosen, and a ratio of 0.47 for the field strength in the first and second acceleration stages, respectively, was found to perform best with respect to mass resolution of the quasimolecular ion species. Typical values obtained under these conditions were 2500–4000 M/dM (FWHM). The TOF-mass spectrometer was equipped with a so-called precursor ion selector. This is an electrostatically switched ion gate located at a distance of about 220 mm from the sample. It allows a precursor ion selection with a mass selectivity of about 60 M/dM and is a mandatory device for post-source decay fragment ion mass analysis in nonhomogenous samples. PSD fragment ion spectra were sequentially recorded over 12–15 mass windows by incremental reduction of the reflectron voltages. In each spectral window 30–100 single-shot spectra were averaged depending on sample conditions. For signal recording, the output of the detector was fed to a 300-MHz digital oscilloscope (Le Croy 9450A Chestnut Ridge, NY) and digitized at a sampling rate of either 10 or 5 ns. Signal averaging and processing were carried out using a 486 PC with Ulysses software (version 7.31, Chips at Work, Bonn, Germany). A subroutine provides for easy PSD ion mass assignment without the need to calibrate the instrument by PSD reference standards (for further details see Ref.15Kaufmann R. Kirsch D. Spengler B. Int. J. Mass Spectrom. Ion Proc. 1994; 131: 356-385Crossref Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Accuracy and precision of PSD mass assignments reach ± 0.2–0.3 atomic mass units in the mass range of m/z500–1000. Compilation (stitching) of a set of PSD mass windows was performed by a subroutine contained in the MALDI-PSD Peptide Sequencer software (version 3.2, copyright by Frank Lützenkirchen, ILM, Düsseldorf, Germany). 1H and 13C NMR spectra were obtained with a Bruker AM-360 spectrometer for solutions in Me2SO-d 6 containing 2% D2O at room temperature referenced to dimethyl sulfoxide (H 2.49, C 39.5). For the detection of NH protons and correlated signals, additional one-dimensional and two-dimensional 1H spectra were run containing 2% water (by volume) under the same conditions. Standard Bruker software was used for two-dimensional COSY, relayed COSY, homo- and heteronuclear correlated experiments. A systematic analysis of complex lipids in G. hydrophobica 1775/15s and G. hydrophobica 1775/15r according to the method of Dobson et al. (16Dobson G. Minnikin D.E. Minnikin S.M. Parlett J.H. Goodfellow M. Ridell M. Magnusson M. Goodfellow M. Minnikin D.E. Chemical Methods in Bacterial Systematics. Academic Press, London1985: 237-265Google Scholar) revealed that an additional compound was present in the fraction of the most polar lipids of the smooth variants compared with that of the rough ones. The less polar lipids were identical between smooth and rough variants (data not shown). In TLC analysis this compound showed anR f value of 0.23 (Fig. 1). In contrast to the rough variants, all investigated smooth ones synthesize this compound. The ninhydrin reaction was negative, whereas the reaction with orcinol was positive. This indicated that the lipid contains no free amino group but instead carries a sugar moiety. We therefore tentatively concluded that the isolated compound is a glycolipid, which was named gordonin. For structural analysis we used the glycolipid of the strain 1775/15s, which was confirmed to beG. hydrophobica by DNA-DNA hybridization with G. hydrophobica DSM 44015T and that was the object of further physiological investigations. 2M. Moormann and K. Altendorf, unpublished results. After weak methanolysis and subsequent peracetylation of the purified gordonin, glucose could be detected as peracetylated methyl glycoside by GC/MS analysis to be the only sugar component (TableI). Strong methanolysis released glucose, serine, and two fatty acids. Two further fragments, in which the valine was bound to two different fatty acids, could be identified, but it was not possible to decide whether the amino acid was amide- or ester-linked to the fatty acid.Table ICalculated molecular weight of gordonin and its homologueResidueM rNumber of residuesMolecular weightSerine1054420420Glycine752150150Threonine1191119119Alanine8918989Valine1172234234Leucine1311131131Phenylalanine1652330330Glucose1801180180FA C20–3OH3281328FA C22:1–30H3541354Sum19812007H2O subtracted15−270−270Calculated molecular weight17111737 Open table in a new tab After strong hydrolysis and subsequent amino acid analysis the amino acids alanine, leucine, threonine, glycine, valine, phenylalanine, and serine could be identified in a molar ratio of 1:1:1:2:2:2:4, respectively (Table I). The determination of the absolute configuration of the amino acids was achieved by separation of diastereomericN α-(2,4-dinitro-5-fluorophenyl)-l-alaninamide-amino acid derivatives by HPLC (data not shown) and showed that only leucine and alanine were present in the d configuration. The fatty acids were isolated, methylated, and analyzed by GC/MS. Two main peaks were detected. One of them belonged to a saturated 3-OH fatty acid since its basal peak at m/z 103 originated from [CH(OH)CH2COOCH3]+. The other one was an unsaturated 3-OH fatty acid with a significant peak atm/z 103 and a basal peak at m/z 55 due to [H3C(CH)2CH2]+. The parental peaks of the methyl esters were difficult to detect by this ionization method and were only observed for the unsaturated fatty acid, but their molecular weight could be obtained from the peaks atm/z = M-50, which are of significant height in the case of 3-OH fatty acids (17Ryhage R. Stenhagen E. J. Lipid Res. 1960; 5: 361-390Google Scholar). The data indicated that the fatty acid fraction was a mixture of two components, 20:0 (3-OH) and 22:1 (3-OH) (Table I). Using strong methanolysis and subsequent peracetylation, GC/MS analysis revealed that valine was attached to 20:0 (3-OH) as a major compound. It was expected that ester-bound valine would not have resisted the strong methanolysis conditions applied (2 m HCl/MeOH, 85 °C, 2 h). As judged by GLC/MS analysis it was difficult to decide whether valine is ester- or amide-linked to the 20:0 (3-OH), since both derivatives exhibit identical molecular weights. To solve this problem, the peracetylated derivatives [(R)-3-hydroxy-tetradecanamido]-d-valine methyl ester (2) and [(R)-3-O-[2-N-(acetamido)-d-valinoxy]-tetradecanoic acid methyl ester (3) have been synthesized whereby the (R)-3-hydroxymyristic acid (14:0 (3-OH)) was used instead of 3-hydroxyeicosanoic acid (20:0 (3-OH)), since it was the only (R)-configurated 3-hydroxylated fatty acid available. As compared with GC/MS analysis, compounds 2 and3 displayed in the electron impact-mass spectrum characteristic fragment ions for either the amide- or the ester-linked valine to the β-hydroxylated fatty acid (compounds 2 and3, Figs. 2, a and b). Comparing the electron impact-mass spectra of 2 and3 with that of the compound isolated and derivatized in a similar way from gordonin, it was unequivocally proven that valine is ester linked to the β-hydroxy group of the β-hydroxylated fatty acid (Fig. 2 c). Therefore, the valine residue in the intact gordonin is either amino-terminally blocked or gordonin is a cyclic depsipeptide, because it is ninhydrin-negative. To determine the amino acid sequence of gordonin, the compound was partially hydrolyzed. After separation on C18 reversed-phase HPLC, resulting fragments were analyzed by Edman degradation. The separation pattern of partially hydrolyzed peptides (a–f) and their amino acid sequences are shown in Fig. 3. Edman degradation of the other fragments has been unsuccessful because of amino-terminal blocking. Hydrolysis, trifluoracetylation, and GC/MS analysis revealed that besides the monomeric amino acids, dimeric fragments being composed of Thr-Gly, Gly-Val, Val-Ser, Leu-Val, Ser-Phe, Phe-Ser, and Phe-Val and also a trimeric Ser-Ser-Ala fragment could be found (Fig.4).Figure 4Separation pattern of partially hydrolyzed peptides. Gordonin was partially hydrolyzed with 6 mHCl at 105 °C for 2 h. After trifluoracetylation and methylation, peptide fragments were separated by gas chromatography on a 5% methyl-silicone column. Peptides were identified by their electron-impact mass spectra in comparison to known standards and according to published fragmentation schemes (33Weygand F. Prox A. Fessel H.H. Sun K.K. Z.

Recently we demonstrated that NPY is expressed within islet beta cells of the rat pancreas following treatment with dexamethasone in vivo. In this study we examined the cellular expression of NPY following dexamethasone treatment of the insulin-producing cell line RINm5F, which under control conditions does not express or release NPY. The cells were cultured with or without dexamethasone (100 nm) for 5 days. Over the 5-day culture period, dexamethasone time dependently induced an increased release of NPY with a concomitant decrease in the release of insulin. Northern blot andin situ hybridization revealed a corresponding time-dependent increase in the amount of NPY transcripts and in the number of cells labeled for NPY mRNA, whereas immunocytochemistry for NPY revealed only a few immunoreactive cells, indicating a rapid release of the formed peptide. Following 5 days of culture with dexamethasone, acute stimulation withd-glyceraldehyde (10 mm) or KCl (20 mm) Ca2+ dependently stimulated the release of insulin. In contrast neither stimulation withd-glyceraldehyde or KCl nor removal of extracellular Ca2+ affected the release of NPY. Furthermore thed-glyceraldehyde- and KCl-induced increase in cytosolic Ca2+, evident in control RINm5F cells, was impaired after dexamethasone treatment. We conclude that RINm5F cells show steroid-sensitive plasticity and express NPY after dexamethasone treatment concomitantly with a decreased insulin secretion and impaired increase in cytosolic Ca2+ upon depolarization with KCl or stimulation with d-glyceraldehyde. We also conclude that NPY and insulin secretion are regulated differently and suggest that the inability of the removal of extracellular Ca2+ to inhibit NPY secretion and the failure of d-glyceraldehyde and KCl to stimulate NPY secretion reflect a constitutive release of this peptide from the cells in contrast to the regulated release of insulin.

In the pancreas of several species, including the rat, NPY has been demonstrated in adrenergic as well as in non-adrenergic nerve fibers around blood vessels, ducts, and acini as well as within the islets (4Sundler F.

Diabetes. 1991; 40: 660-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed expression of NPY also in islet cells, e.g. in hamster islet somatostatin cells (8Myrsén U. Sundler F. Regul. Pept. 1995; 57: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), in mouse islet glucagon cells (9Teitelman G. Alpert S. Polak J.M. Martinez A. Hanahan D. Development. 1993; 118: 1031-1039PubMed Google Scholar), and in rat islet cells following in vivo treatment or treatment of isolated islets with dexamethasone (10Jamal H. Jones P.M. Byrne J. Suda K.

The dexamethasone-induced expression of NPY in rat islet cells has been localized predominantly to the insulin-producing beta cells (11Myrsén U. Ahrén B. Sundler F. Regul. Pept. 1995; 60: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 12Myrsén U. Ahrén B. Sundler F. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1306-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms of dexamethasone-induced NPY expression and the regulation of NPY secretion from insulin-producing cells after dexamethasone treatment are not yet established. To study whether insulin-producing cells show steroid plasticity and display induced expression and secretion of NPY after dexamethasone treatment in a defined environment without influence of peptides derived from other islet cells, we examined the RINm5F cells by using Northern blot, in situ hybridization (ISH), and immunocytochemistry. Furthermore, we examined the release of insulin and NPY by radioimmunoassay from the RINm5F cells after dexamethasone treatment during basal conditions and after stimulation withd-glyceraldehyde and KCl in the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+. The levels of cytosolic Ca2+ in control- and dexamethasone-treated cells during basal and stimulated conditions were also measured. Stock cultures of RINm5F cells were grown continuously at 37 °C in humified air equilibrated with 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2.5 μg/ml amphothericin B. Cells were subcultured once weekly after trypsination and the medium was changed every 3–4 days. All experimental work was performed with cells in passages number 76–80. RINm5F cells were cultured on glass slides for 1 to 5 days in control medium and in medium supplemented with dexamethasone (100 nm), respectively. Each day of the culture period, slides were processed for immunocytochemistry or ISH. For immunocytochemistry, each slide was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2, and then fixed in Stefanini's fixative (2% formaldehyde and 0.2% picric acid in phosphate buffer, pH 7.2) for 15 min at room temperature, then rinsed repeatedly with PBS, and immediately processed for the immunocytochemical demonstration of NPY, insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, PP, and PYY. The slides were incubated overnight with primary antibodies against pro-NPY68–97 (C-PON) (1:1280; code CA 300, Cambridge Research Biochemicals, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Incubation was also performed with primary antibodies against proinsulin (1:1280, code 9003), glucagon (1:2560, code 7811), PYY (1:2560, code 8415), PP (1:1280, code 7823) (EuroDiagnostica, Malmö, Sweden), and somatostatin (1:1600, code N-SOM, Incstar, Stillwater, MN). The site of the antigen-antibody reaction was visualized by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody to rabbit IgG raised in pig (Dakopatts, Copenhagen, Denmark). For ISH, slides were rinsed twice with PBS and then fixed for 10 min in buffered 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.2), permeabilized in 0.25% Triton X-100, rinsed in PBS for 5 min, and dehydrated. For detection of NPY mRNA, a 36-mer probe complementary to the nucleotide sequence 266–301 of rat NPY cDNA was used. The probe has been checked for complementarity to other genes present in the GenBankTMdata base, using the NCBI BLAST E-mail server, but no such complementarity was found (11Myrsén U. Ahrén B. Sundler F. Regul. Pept. 1995; 60: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 12Myrsén U. Ahrén B. Sundler F. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1306-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For detection of insulin mRNA, a probe mixture consisting of six different 30-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotides was used (BPR 236; R & D Systems, Abingdon, Oxfordshire, UK). ISH was also performed for glucagon mRNA using a probe complementary to nucleotides 153–182 of rat glucagon cDNA, for somatostatin mRNA using a probe complementary to nucleotides 310–339 (code NEP-503, DuPont NEN, Solna, Sweden) of rat somatostatin cDNA, for PYY and PP mRNAs using probes complementary to nucleotides 266–295 of rat PYY cDNA, and nucleotides 265–294 of rat PP cDNA. The probes were 3′-end-labeled with35S-dATP using a terminal transferase (both supplied by DuPont NEN, Stockholm, Sweden) yielding a specific activity of approximately 2 × 109 cpm/μg. Hybridization was carried out overnight at 37 °C in sealed moisturizing chambers using a probe concentration of 1.3 pmol/ml. After hybridization, the slides were washed first in 1 × SSC (0.15 m NaCl, 0.015m sodium citrate) at room temperature, then in 0.5 × SSC (four times for 15 min at 55 °C), and finally in 1 × SSC (once for 30 min at room temperature), followed by dehydration. The slides were coated with Ilford K-5 emulsion and stored in light-sealed boxes at 4 °C for 3–4 days. They were then developed and counterstained with hematoxylin. For control purposes, hybridization was also performed after incubation in RNase A (Sigma) (45 μg/ml for 30 min at 37 °C) or in the presence of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled probe. In the control experiments no autoradiographic labeling was obtained. The percentage of NPY mRNA-labeled cells of the total number of cells counted was calculated for each day during the 5-day culture period with and without dexamethasone. At least 2 slides from three separate experiments for each day (control and dexamethasone-treated cells) were examined. In each slide approximately 1000 cells, in randomly selected visual fields in the microscope, were counted and checked for NPY mRNA labeling. Cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 15 × 104 cells per well (n = 6) and cultured for 5 days with or without dexamethasone (100 nm). The medium was replaced, and 800 μl were sampled from each well daily and then centrifuged at 200 rpm for 5 min. Aliquots for assay of insulin (50 μl) and NPY (100 μl) were stored at −20 °C until assayed. The number of cells per well was counted each day during the culture period. After removal of the medium, the cells were rinsed with 2 × 500 μl of PBS. Washed cells were then trypsinated (200 μl, Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, Scotland) and collected in vials. To inactivate the trypsin, 200 μl of 10% fetal calf serum were added to each vial. The vials were then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the remaining cell pellet was resuspended with 2 ml of RPMI 1640. The cells were then counted in a Bürker chamber. After 3 days of culture in flasks with or without dexamethasone (100 nm) cells were detached with trypsin, then seeded in 24-well plates at a concentration of 23 × 104 cells per well (n = 6), and cultured for 2 more days (reaching about 80% confluence) with or without dexamethasone. The cells were then washed twice in a HEPES medium containing in mm: 125 NaCl, 5.9 KCl, 1.28 CaCl2, 1.2 MgCl2, 25 HEPES, and 0.1% human serum albumin (pH 7.36). Thereafter, the cells were incubated in the HEPES medium in a volume of 200 μl supplemented with 3.3 mm glucose, 10 mmd-glyceraldehyde, or 20 mm KCl. The influence of Ca2+ deficiency was studied by excluding CaCl2 in the incubation medium at incubations with 3.3 mm glucose and 20 mm KCl. After a 60-min incubation at 37 °C in 95% O2, 5% CO2, 150 μl of the medium were collected and centrifuged at 200 rpm for 5 min. Aliquots for insulin (50 μl) and NPY (50 μl) were then frozen and stored at −20 °C until assayed. For the radioimmunoassay of NPY, a rabbit antiserum to synthetic porcine NPY was used (gift from Dr. P. C. Emson, Cambridge, UK). Porcine 125I-NPY was used as a tracer. The antiserum used has been characterized previously (13Widerlöv E. Lindström L.H. Wahlestedt C. Ekman R. J. Psychiat. Res. 1988; 22: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). For the radioimmunoassay of insulin, we used a guinea pig anti-rat insulin antibody, 125I-labeled human insulin, as tracer and rat insulin as standard (Linco Research, St. Louis, MO). The separation of free and bound radioactivity was performed by the double antibody technique. Total RNA was isolated from cells cultured without or with dexamethasone (100 nm) for 1–5 days by extraction in guanidium thiocyanate using the single step method described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (14Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62888) Google Scholar). RNA was quantified spectrophotometrically. In each lane, 20 μg of total cellular RNA were separated electrophoretically on a denaturing 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham International plc, Bucks, UK) by capillary transfer in 20 × SSC. RNA was cross-linked to the filter by exposure to UV light (120,000 μJ). Prehybridization was performed at 63 °C for 60 min. Hybridization with the [γ-32P]ATP 5′-end-labeled (Amersham International plc) NPY oligoprobe (same sequence as used for ISH) (1.6 × 106 cpm/ml hybridization solution) was carried out at 63 °C overnight. The filter was then washed as follows: twice for 15 min, 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, at room temperature; once for 15 min, 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, at room temperature; and once for 15 min, 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C. As control for the amount of total RNA application, the filter was hybridized with a randomly [α-32P]dCTP-labeled actin probe (15Minty A.J. Caravatti M. Robert B. Cohen A. Daubas P. Weydert A. Gros F. Buckingham M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1008-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Autoradiography was performed at −70 °C for 5 days for both actin and NPY by exposing the filter to imaging film (CEA AB, Strängnäs, Sweden) and developed according to standard procedures. Densitometric laser scanning of each autoradiograph was performed. Quantitation of NPY mRNA was obtained by expressing the autoradiographic signal after hybridization with the NPY probe relative to the autoradiographic signal after hybridization with the actin probe. The free cytoplasmic calcium concentration [Ca2+]i was analyzed with the fluorescent probe FURA-2AM (Sigma) as described elsewhere (16Karlsson S. Ahrén B. Peptides. 1996; 17: 909-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Cells cultured in control medium or dexamethasone-supplemented medium for 1, 3, and 5 days were trypsinated and thereafter allowed to recover at a concentration of 0.5 × 106 cells/ml for 2 h in 10 ml of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C. During this period the cells were continuously shaken to avoid attachment. The cells were then loaded with 1 μm indicator for 45 min, rinsed three times in HEPES buffer, and allowed to equilibrate for 20 min in the HEPES medium at room temperature. The cells were again rinsed, counted in a Bürker chamber, resuspended in the HEPES medium at a concentration of 0.5 × 106 cells/ml, and transferred to a cuvette for measurement of [Ca2+]i. [Ca2+]i was measured by dual wavelength spectrophotofluorimetry in a Perkin-Elmer LS-50 spectrophotofluorometer. The excitation wavelength was continuously altered between 340 and 380 nm, and the emission wavelength was 510 nm. The cell suspension was continuously stirred with a stir bar mounted at the side of the cuvette. d-Glyceraldehyde (10 mm) and KCl (20 mm) were added to the cuvette in microliter volumes from stock solutions of high concentrations at specific time points as indicated in the figures. When experimental and control series were compared, the substances under study were always added at identical time points from the start of the experiment: at 200 s for d-glyceraldehyde and at 900 s for KCl. At the end of each experiment, fluorescence maximum was obtained by adding 0.03% Triton X-100, and fluorescence minimum was obtained by adding EGTA in excess to the cell suspensions. The [Ca2+]i was calculated according to the previously described formula (17Grynkiewics G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The K d was assumed to be 224 nm. The data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Statistical comparisons of differences between mean values were performed by the use of the Student's t test or with the Mann-Whitney U test. Bonferroni correction was used when multiple comparisons were performed. ISH performed on control RINm5F cells displayed no labeling for NPY mRNA at any time (Fig. 1), and no signal for NPY mRNA could be detected with Northern blot (Fig. 2). In contrast, after dexamethasone treatment of RINm5F cells, a time-dependent increase in the amount of NPY mRNA transcripts (Fig. 2) and in the number of NPY mRNA-labeled cells (Fig. 1) was observed. Thus, after 1 day of dexamethasone treatment, Northern blot displayed a weak signal (Fig. 2), and only 5 ± 1% of the cells displayed labeling (Fig. 1 and Fig. 3). However, after 5 days of culture with dexamethasone, there was a 13-fold increase in the amount of NPY mRNA transcripts compared with 1 day of dexamethasone treatment (Fig. 2), and 91 ± 1% of the cells displayed intense labeling (Figs. 1 and 3). ISH for insulin mRNA revealed labeling of all cells, and there was no obvious difference in labeling intensity between dexamethasone-treated and control cells (data not shown). ISH for glucagon, somatostatin, PP, or PYY revealed no labeling for respective mRNA in dexamethasone-treated or control cells during the 5-day culture period. NPY immunoreactivity, located in the cell cytoplasm, was detected in a minor population of cells treated with dexamethasone for 2–5 days (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, control cells (Fig.4 B) and cells cultured with dexamethasone for only 1 day did not stain for NPY. In all groups studied glucagon, somatostatin, PP, or PYY immunoreactivities could not be detected, whereas a subpopulation of cells displayed insulin immunoreactivity.Figure 2Time-dependent increase of NPY mRNA in RINm5F cells when treated with dexamethasone. Cells were cultured without (−) or with (+) dexamethasone (100 nm) for 5 days. At indicated times cells were harvested, and RNA was extracted.

Thus, the content of NPY in the medium after a 5-day culture period with dexamethasone was increased 58-fold compared with 1 day of culture with dexamethasone (p < 0.001). In contrast NPY could not be detected in the medium of control cells (Table I). Insulin was detected in the medium of both control and dexamethasone-treated cells. In the medium of control cells, the insulin content increased gradually during the first 3 days of culture and then leveled off, whereas the insulin content in the medium of dexamethasone-treated cells was significantly lower compared with controls (p < 0.001) (Table I) at all time points throughout the 5-day culture period. During the 5-day culture period, the cells displayed a steady increase in number. However, treatment with dexamethasone decreased cell recovery by approximately 30% at day 5 compared with control cells (data not shown). When calculating the release of insulin and NPY per cell for 24 h, insulin release from control and dexamethasone-treated cells decreased with time, and by day 5 had decreased to approximately 35% from control cells (p < 0.001) and approximately 5% from dexamethasone-treated cells (p < 0.001) compared with cells cultured for 1 day (Fig. 5). In contrast, the release of NPY displayed a time-dependent increase from cells cultured with dexamethasone by a 22-fold increase (p < 0.001) at day 5 compared with cells cultured with dexamethasone for 1 day (Fig.5).Table IEffects of dexamethasone on the release of insulin and NPY from RINm5F cellsDays of cultureInsulinNPY1234512345nm/24 hpm/24 hControl24.2 ± 1.039.5 ± 1.063.5 ± 2.456.8 ± 3.356.6 ± 2.6ND1-aND, not detectable.NDNDNDNDDexamethasone15.1 ± 0.416.9 ± 0.512.0 ± 0.49.9 ± 1.84.0 ± 0.212 ± 6168 ± 7450 ± 21355 ± 32690 ± 34Cells were cultured for 5 days in the absence (control) or presence of dexamethasone (100 nm).

The media were changed every 24 h, and samples were taken daily and analyzed with radioimmunoassay. The values represent the mean ± S.E.,n = 6. Base-line [Ca2+]i levels in RINm5F cells was 89 ± 3 nm. d-Glyceraldehyde (10 mm) induced a gradual increase in [Ca2+]i. At 1 day after initiation of culture, [Ca2+]i increased to 212 ± 4 nm at 300 s after addition ofd-glyceraldehyde (p < 0.001). A similar pattern of influence was observed at days 3 and 5 after initiation of culture (Fig. 6). When the cells were cultured in the presence of dexamethasone for 1 day, thed-glyceraldehyde-induced increase in [Ca2+]i was the same as in control cells, both in pattern and magnitude (Fig. 6). However, thed-glyceraldehyde-induced increase in [Ca2+]i was markedly impaired at day 3 when cultured with dexamethasone and more pronounced at day 5. In fact after 5 days of culture with dexamethasone, d-glyceraldehyde failed to increase [Ca2+]i. In contrast, base-line [Ca2+]i was not affected by dexamethasone. Depolarization by KCl (20 mm) markedly increased [Ca2+]i due to opening of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels (Fig. 6). After 5 days of culture in the presence of dexamethasone, this depolarization-induced increase in [Ca2+]i was reduced by approximately 50% (p < 0.001). Acute stimulation with 10 mmd-glyceraldehyde or 20 mm KCl for 60 min significantly increased insulin release from both control and dexamethasone-treated RINm5F cells (p < 0.001). However, the insulin secretory response to d-glyceraldehyde and KCl from cells treated with dexamethasone was much lower than the response from control cells (p < 0.001) (Table II). Removal of extracellular Ca2+ abolished the KCl-stimulated release of insulin from both control and dexamethasone-treated cells (Table II). In contrast neither stimulation with d-glyceraldehyde or KCl nor removal of Ca2+ from the incubation medium affected the release of NPY from cells cultured with dexamethasone as determined with radioimmunoassay (Table II).

The interaction between rhIL-1β and these glycoproteins was lectin-like, since it was inhibited in the presence of specific saccharides, i.e. mannose 6-phosphate or synthetic Ac-NH·CH2·CH2·PO4−→6Manα1→(±2Manα1→±6Manα1→)propyl at about 1 μm. On the other hand, a wide variety of compounds including biantennary sugar chains derived from these glycoproteins as well as ethanolamine phosphate, inositol phosphate, mannose 6-sulfate, mannose 1-phosphate, glucose 6-phosphate, and mannitol 6-phosphate did not show any inhibitory effect at concentrations up to 1 mm. These results indicate that rhIL-1β interacts with these glycoproteins via the mannose 6-phosphate diester of glycans on the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. Furthermore, when monolayers of polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells on polycarbonate filter membranes were incubated with 35S-rhIL-1β in either the apical or basolateral chamber, 35S-interleukin-1β was found to bind specifically to the apical membranes with a K avalue of 4.6 × 107m−1, and the specific interaction was inhibited by 1 μm mannose 6-phosphate. Since the mannose 6-phosphate diester moiety exists only in the GPI glycans on plasma membranes, it was evident that interleukin-1β can directly interact with the mannose 6-phosphate diester component of the intact glycan of GPI anchors on plasma membranes.

Until now, over 50 types of cytokines have been reported that mediate the regulatory network established between lymphoid cells, hematopoietic cells, and endothelial cells that control their differentiation and proliferation (1Arai K. Lee F. Miyajima A. Miyatake S. Arai N. Yokota T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 783-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). In this cytokine network, a single cytokine can act as both a positive signal and a negative one, depending on the type of target cells. In contrast, in some instances multiple cytokines act on a single cell and show the same biological effects. The response of target cells to a given cytokine is determined by the expression of the cytokine receptor and/or the nature of the link between the receptor and the signal transduction pathways of the target cells. We have been interested in the lectin-like character of cytokines in relation to their role as signal transducers or effectors. On the basis of their lectin-like character, various cytokines have been categorized into several groups. Growth factors such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (2Gordon M.Y.

To elucidate the physiological role of the lectin-like interaction between cytokines and target molecules, the carbohydrate binding specificities of cytokines should first be determined. We describe in this paper the lectin-like interaction between recombinant human IL-1β (rhIL-1β) and target glycoproteins by measuring the binding of 35S-labeled rhIL-1β to various glycoproteins immobilized on Sepharose 4B, on plates coated with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC)-treated human placental alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and on polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and also by assaying the inhibition of this interaction by various haptenic compounds. Human transferrin, bovine ribonuclease B, mannose 6-phosphate, mannose 1-phosphate, glucose 6-phosphate,myo-inositol 1-phosphate, mannose 6-sulfate, and ethanolamine phosphate were purchased from Sigma.

Nakamura K. Takeyama H. Yanagihara K. Inazu T. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1994; 67: 1359-1366Crossref Google Scholar). Uromodulin was prepared from pooled urine (1 liter) from a pregnant donor (in the 12th week of pregnancy) as follows (18Tamm I. Horsfall Jr., F.L. J. Exp. Med. 1952; 95: 71-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). 0.58 mol of NaCl was added to the urine, and it was stirred at 4 °C overnight. The precipitate formed was collected by centrifugation and dialyzed against distilled water. After centrifugation, the supernatant was freeze-dried and dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Trypanosomes (Trypanosoma brucei gambiense) isolated from the blood of an infected mouse according to the method described by Cross (19Cross G.A. Parasitology. 1975; 71: 393-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. Y. Tachibana (Tokai University, Japan). A 100-μl sample of packed trypanosomes was digested with B. thuringiensis PI-PLC (0.5 units/ml in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 37 °C, 5 h), and the solubilized variant surface glycoproteins (VSG) were purified by Superose 12 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) gel permeation chromatography. Upon analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to the method of Laemmli (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207479) Google Scholar) followed by silver staining, the purified VSG appeared as a broad single band with a molecular mass of about 60 kDa. cDNA encoding human IL-1β (R&D Systems Europe Ltd., Abingdon, United Kingdom) was used to produce rhIL-1β in Escherichia coli. Plasmid pET3a (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI) was used as the T7 expression plasmid (21Joseph-Liauzun E. Leplatosis P. Legoux R. Guerveno V. Marchese E. Ferrara P. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 86: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). ANdeI-BamHI fragment corresponding to the synthetic human IL-1β gene was inserted between the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET3a to produce the expression plasmid. The rhIL-1β gene was expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) under the control of the T7 promoter. The recombinant protein was released from the cells by osmotic shock, concentrated with an Amicon PM10 Diaflo membrane, and applied to a Sephacryl S-200 column. Fractions containing rhIL-1β were pooled and stored at −20 °C until use. The cloned cDNA encoding IL-1β (R&D Systems Europe Ltd., Abingdon, UK) inserted downstream from the T7 RNA polymerase promoter in plasmid pET3a was used as a template for in vitro transcription and translation in the Single Tube Protein System 2, T7 (Novagen, Inc.) in the presence of [35S]methionine. The translation products were separated from free [35S]methionine using a PD-10 column (Pharmacia). One reaction using 2.5 μg of plasmid DNA templates, 200 μl of lysate, and 200 μCi of [35S]methionine provided approximately 500 fmol of35S-rhIL-1β (0.9 × 107 dpm/pmol). The binding of35S-labeled rhIL-1β to various glycoproteins was measured by a solid-phase binding assay. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates (Corning, Inc., Corning, NY) were coated with glycoproteins at 10 μg/ml in 20 mm carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, at 4 °C overnight. The plates were washed with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, pH 7.3, blocked with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 1% BSA and then treated with 1 × 105 dpm of 35S-rhIL-1β in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.1% BSA at 37 °C for 2 h. After washing with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, the bound 35S-rhIL-1β was released by treatment with 100 μl of 1 m acetic acid, and the radioactivity was measured by means of a liquid scintillation counter. ALP (1.2 mg) was dissolved in 1 ml of coupling buffer (0.1 mNaHCO3 (pH 8.3) containing 0.5 m NaCl). 1 ml of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) in a column (inner diameter 0.7 cm × 5 cm long) was washed with 1 mm HCl (20 ml), and the HCl was replaced with the coupling buffer. The ALP solution was quickly added to the CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B resin. After gentle mixing at 4 °C for 18 h, the gel was washed with 5 gel volumes of coupling buffer. The gel was shaken in an equal volume of 0.2m glycine, pH 8.0, at room temperature for 2 h and washed with 0.1 m acetate buffer containing 1 mNaCl, pH 4.0, and with coupling buffer (three times each). The amount of ALP bound to the Sepharose 4B (based on the amount of ALP remaining in the coupling reaction filtrate) was estimated to be approximately 1 mg/ml gel. Bovine ribonuclease B-Sepharose (10 mg/ml gel), trypanosome VSG-Sepharose (1 mg/ml gel), uromodulin-Sepharose (1 mg/ml gel), and human transferrin-Sepharose (10 mg/ml gel) were prepared according to the same procedures as those employed for ALP-Sepharose. 5000 dpm of35S-rhIL-1β was applied to a column (inner diameter, 0.7 cm × 5 cm long) of ALP-, VSG-, uromodulin-, transferrin-, or ribonuclease B-Sepharose (1 ml), which was equilibrated with PBS containing 0.1% BSA (PBS-BSA) at 4 °C. After standing for 30 min, the respective columns were washed with 5 column volumes of PBS-BSA and the bound 35S-rhIL-1β was eluted with PBS-BSA containing 1 mm mannose 6-phosphate. MDCK strain II cells were maintained in minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For binding experiments, MDCK cells that were plated at confluent density (approximately 3.5 × 105 cells) in 6.5-mm Transwell filter chambers (Costar) and cultured for 4 days after plating were used. The polarity of cells was assessed by polarized uptake of [35S]methionine from the basolateral side (>10:1, basolateral:apical) (22Baclarova-Stander J. Pfeiffer S.E. Fuller S.D. Simon K. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2687-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The polarized monolayers on Transwell filters were washed with ice-cold MEM (200 μl), the same medium was added to both the apical (0.1-ml) and basolateral (0.5-ml) chambers, and the cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The medium in both chambers was changed to media with or without 200 μg/ml rhIL-1β, and the cells were incubated for another hour at 4 °C. For assay of apical binding, the medium in the apical compartment was replaced with 50 μl of medium containing 0.2 μCi/ml 35S-rhIL-1β with or without 200 μg/ml rhIL-1β, and the Transwell filters were placed onto 50 μl of MEM medium on a piece of parafilm. For assay of basolateral binding, the non-radioactive medium and the radioactive medium were added to opposite chambers, and the cells were then incubated for the indicated times at 4 °C. The binding assays were terminated by rapid washing of each compartment with ice-cold PBS four times. The cells were lysed in 100 μl of ice-cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Hcl, pH 8, containing 10 mmEDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% SDS) and removed by gentle scraping. The lysates were centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 10,000 ×g for 10 min to precipitate debris and intact nuclei. Proteins in the supernatants were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C for 30 min, and the samples were centrifuged. The pellets were washed with ethyl ether, and radioactivity was counted using a scintillation counter. It has been reported that rhIL-1β exhibits lectin-like characteristics (7Muchmore A.V. Decker J.M. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 2541-2546PubMed Google Scholar, 9Muchmore A.V. Shifrin S. Decker J.M. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 2547-2553PubMed Google Scholar). As the first step to examine the lectin-like characteristics of IL-1β, the binding of35S-rhIL-1β to various glycoproteins immobilized on Sepharose 4B columns was investigated. As shown in Fig.1, 35S-rhIL-1β bound to PI-PLC-treated ALP-Sepharose, PI-PLC-treated VSG-Sepharose, or uromodulin-Sepharose (1 mg/ml gel) columns, and the bound 35S-rhIL-1β was eluted with PBS-BSA containing 1 mm mannose 6-phosphate, which is a constituent of the glycan portion of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (Fig. 1, A, B, and C). In contrast, rhIL-1β did not bind to human transferrin-Sepharose or bovine ribonuclease B-Sepharose (10 mg/ml gel) columns, where the glycan moiety linked to the protein consists of sialylated biantennary sugar chains (23Spik G. Bayard B. Fournet B. Strecker G. Bouquelet S. Montreuil J. FEBS Lett. 1975; 50: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and high mannose-type sugar chains, respectively (24Liang C-J. Yamashita K. Kobata A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1980; 88: 51-58PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, D and E). The glycoproteins interacting with rhIL-1β not only have asparagine-linked sugar chains but also glycans of the GPI anchor at the carboxyl-terminal end. The structures of the glycan portions of the GPI anchor of ALP (25Redman C.A. Thomas-Oates J.E. Ogata S. Ikehara Y. Ferguson M.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 861-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and trypanosome VSG (26Ferguson M.A. Low M.G. Cross G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14547-14555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have already been determined, and their side chain structures differ from each other as shown below. O∥ALP:Protein·CNH·CH2·CH2·PO4−→6(±NH2·CH2·CH2·PO4−→) (Manα1→2Manα1→6Manα1→4GlcNH2)→inositol·PO4− O∥VSG:Protein·CNH·CH2·CH2·PO4−→6Manα1→2Manα1→6(±Galα1 →2Galα1→6(Galα1→2)Galα1→3)Manα1→4GlcNH2→inositol·PO4− STRUCTUREI Since the 1-O-alkyl-2-O-acylglycerol moiety of the GPI anchor is removed by PI-PLC digestion, it was evident that rhIL-1β recognizes the common structure, NH2·CH2·CH2·PO4−→ 6Manα1→2Manα1→6Manα1→4GlcNH2, of the glycans in the GPI anchor. In binding assays using plates coated with each of the five glycoproteins (10 μg/ml),35S-rhIL-1β bound to PI-PLC-treated ALP, PI-PLC-treated VSG, and uromodulin in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). For determination of the character of the interaction between rhIL-1β and these glycoproteins, an assay of inhibition of solid-phase binding by specific haptens was employed. PI-PLC-treated human placental ALP was used as the glycoprotein to be immobilized on plates because the structures of both the N-linked sugar chain (27Endo T. Ohbayashi H. Hayashi Y. Ikehara Y. Kochibe N. Kobata A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 103: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and the glycan portion of the GPI anchor (25Redman C.A. Thomas-Oates J.E. Ogata S. Ikehara Y. Ferguson M.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 861-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) had been previously determined and are rather simple in comparison with other glycoproteins. We investigated the inhibitory effects of the biantennary sugar chain and various simple components of the glycan portion of the GPI anchor on the interaction between35S-rhIL-1β and ALP-coated plates. At first, we investigated the conditions for solid-phase binding of35S-rhIL-1β to ALP-coated plates. As for the time dependence, the linearity of the binding activity was maintained for at least 3 h (Fig. 2 A, •), and the binding activity was inhibited in the presence of excess amounts of unlabeled rhIL-1β (Fig. 2 A, ○). These results indicated that the binding of 35S-rhIL-1β to ALP is specific and is competitive with unlabeled rhIL-1β. The binding of35S-rhIL-1β was dependent on the concentration of both ALP (Fig. 2 B) and 35S-rhIL-1β (Fig.2 C, •), and the concentration dependence was linear at least up to 20 μg/ml (ALP) and 1 × 106 dpm/ml (35S-rhIL-1β), respectively. The reactivity did not change in the presence of 1 mm EDTA, 10 mmHEPES buffer, pH 7.3, 0.1% BSA (Fig. 2 C, ○) or 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.3, 0.1% BSA (Fig. 2 C, ▴) showing that the lectin-like interaction between rhIL-1β and ALP at least does not require calcium ions. On the basis of these results, the following inhibitory effects of various haptens were investigated in the proportional range of the protein concentration dependence and time dependence. The inhibitory effects of various saccharides listed in Table I on the lectin-like interaction between IL-1β and ALP-coated plates were examined, and the inhibition curves obtained are shown in Fig. 3. The biantennary sugar chain of ALP, which is an asialo-N-linked sugar chain, did not show any inhibitory effect at concentrations up to 10 mm (Fig. 3 A, Table I). Since the same results were obtained even when the plates were coated with sialidase-treated ALP (data not shown), the result is not due to a sialylated biantennary sugar chain of ALP. In contrast, mannose 6-phosphate, which is a component of the glycan of the GPI anchor, was an effective inhibitor (Fig. 3 B). However, other components of this glycan such as ethanolamine phosphate and inositol phosphate did not show any inhibitory effect at 1 mm (see Table I). To elucidate whether mannose 6-phosphate-diester derivatives show inhibitory effects, three synthetic phosphodiester derivatives as shown in Table Iwere studied. Ac-NH·CH2·CH2·PO4−→ 6Manα1→propyl, Ac-NH·CH2·CH2·PO4−→6Manα1→2Manα1→ propyl, and Ac-NH·CH2·CH2·PO4−→6Manα1→2Manα1→6Manα1→propyl showed the same strong inhibitory effects as mannose 6-phosphate (Fig.3, C, D, and E). Mannose 6-sulfate, mannose 1-phosphate, and glucose 6-phosphate did not show any inhibitory effect at concentrations up to 1 mm (Table I), indicating that mannose substituted with phosphate at the C-6 position is necessary for lectin-like binding. Furthermore, mannitol-6-phosphate and NH2CH2·CH2·PO4−→6mannitol, which are reduced forms of mannose 6-phosphate and the phosphodiester derivative, did not show any inhibitory effect at concentrations up to 1 mm. These results showed that a mannopyranoside substituted with phosphate at the C-6 position represents an important locus for the lectin-like interaction between IL-1β and ALP, and IL-1β recognizes the mannose 6-phosphate diester moieties of the glycan of GPI-anchored glycoproteins.Table IInhibition of 35S-rhIL-1β binding to plates coated with ALP by various compoundsCompoundsConcentration for 50% inhibitionH2N·CH2·CH2·HPO4−No inhibition at 1 mmHPO4− → inositolNo inhibition at 1 mmHPO4− → 6mannose0.001 mmHPO4− → 6glucoseNo inhibition at 1 mmHPO4− → 1mannoseNo inhibition at 1 mmHSO4− → 6mannoseNo inhibition at 1 mmHPO4− → 6mannitolNo inhibition at 1 mmH2N·CH2·CH2·PO4− → 6mannitolNo inhibition at 1 mmAcNH·CH2·CH2·PO4− → 6Manα1 → OCH2·CH2·CH30.001 mmAc·NH·CH2·CH2·PO4− → 6Manα1 → 2Manα1 → OCH2·CH2·CH30.001 mmAcNH·CH2·CH2·PO4− → 6Manα1 → 2Manα1 → 6Manα1 → OCH2·CH2·CH30.001 mmGalβ1 → 4GlcNAcβ1 → 2Manα1 ↘6Manβ1 → 4GlcNAcNo inhibition at 10 mm3Galβ1 → 4GlcNAcβ1 → 2Manα1 ↗Binding of 35S-rhIL-1β to ALP was measured by a solid-phase binding assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Binding of 35S-rhIL-1β to ALP was measured by a solid-phase binding assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All of the results so far described were obtained using PI-PLC-treated glycoproteins. To determine whether intact GPI-anchored glycoproteins on plasma membranes interact with35S-rhIL-1β, the following experiments were performed. Because it has been reported that GPI-anchored glycoproteins are distributed on the apical surface of the plasma membrane of polarized MDCK cells (28Lisanti M.P. Sargiacomo M. Graeve L. Saltiel A.R. Rodriguez B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9557-9561Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), and no IL-1 receptor on the plasma membrane of MDCK cells has been reported, we examined the lectin-like interaction between rhIL-1β and cell surface glycoproteins using polarized MDCK cells as a model. Polarized MDCK cells on polycarbonate filter membranes were incubated with 0.2 pmol/ml 35S-rhIL-1β in either the apical or basolateral chamber. The time course of binding at 4 °C is shown in Fig. 4. The amount of35S-rhIL-1β bound to the cells (Fig. 4, ▪) was reduced by the addition of excess unlabeled rhIL-1β (Fig. 4, ○), suggesting that 35S-rhIL-1β and unlabeled rhIL-1β compete for a limited number of specific binding sites. The specific binding of rhIL-1β to the apical surface of MDCK cells, which was defined as the difference between the amounts of radioactivity bound in the absence and presence of excess unlabeled rhIL-1β, had reached a steady state after incubation for 4 h at 4 °C (Fig. 4, •). In contrast, the extent of specific binding to the basolateral surface was low throughout the incubation period for up to 3 h (Fig.4 B). The specific binding was not observed in assays of non-polarized MDCK cells cultured in monolayers (data not shown), suggesting that rhIL-1β binds to GPI-anchored proteins on the apical membranes. Fig. 5 shows Scatchard plots (29Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 600-672Crossref Scopus (17809) Google Scholar) for35S-rhIL-1β binding to the apical cell surface of polarized MDCK monolayers, where B is moles of bound rhIL-1β/dpm as a proportion of the total rhIL-1β/well andF is moles of unbound rhIL-1β. The plots gave a straight line, indicating homogeneity with respect to affinity for the GPI-anchored glycan. The K a value for binding was calculated to be 4.6 × 107m−1. These values were several orders lower than those determined for both type I and type II IL-1 receptors (30McMahan C.J. Slack J.L. Mosley B. Cosman D. Lupton S.D. Brunton L.L. Grubin C.E.

Science. 1988; 241: 585-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar), the expression of IL-1 receptors in renal epithelial cell lines has not been reported. The specific binding shown in Fig. 4indicated that rhIL-1β binds to neither type I nor type II IL-1 receptors. To determine whether the ligands required for rhIL-1β binding to polarized MDCK cells are present within the glycan portion of GPI-anchored proteins, the effect of various amounts of mannose 6-phosphate, mannose 1-phosphate, or mannose 6-sulfate on the specific binding was examined (Fig. 6). The specific binding was dose dependently inhibited by the addition of mannose 6-phosphate (Fig.6, •), which is the common core structure of the glycan portion; in contrast, mannose 1-phosphate (○) or mannose 6-sulfate (▪) did not show any inhibitory effect up to 1 mm. These results support the view that the mannose 6-phosphate diester component of the glycan portions of GPI-anchored proteins in the polarized MDCK cells is the moiety recognized by rhIL-1β in the lectin-like binding interaction. This paper demonstrates that rhIL-1β recognizes mannose 6-phosphate diester within the glycans of GPI-anchored proteins immobilized on plates or immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B. It is also shown that 35S-rhIL-1β binds to intact GPI-anchored proteins present on the apical membranes of polarized MDCK cells with the K a value of 4.6 × 107m−1, and this binding is inhibited in the presence of approximately 1 × 10−6m mannose 6-phosphate. The lectin-like interaction between rhIL-1β and mannose 6-phosphate (diester) in the GPI anchor was calcium-independent as shown in Fig.2 C. It is well known that one of two receptors for lysosomal enzymes trafficking into the lysosome is a Ca2+-independent mannose 6-phosphate binding lectin with a molecular weight of 275,000 (32Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 307-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). It recognizes mannose 6-phosphate residues in high mannose-type sugar chains with a K a value of 7–8 × 106m−1 (32Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 307-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar), but not mannose 6-phosphate diester (33Li M.M. Distler M.L. Jourdian G.W. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 179: 304-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), while IL-1β recognizes both mannose 6-phosphate and its diester equally as described in this study. Since no homology was observed between the amino acid sequences of the Ca2+-independent mannose 6-phosphate-binding lectin and IL-1β using the FASTA method (34Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9391) Google Scholar), IL-1β may have a different type of carbohydrate binding domain from that of the Ca2+-independent mannose 6-phosphate-binding lectin for lysosomal enzymes. It has been reported that not only IL-1β but also TNF-α and lymphotoxin bind to uromodulin immobilized on plates, and in each case this binding is partially inhibited by high concentrations ofN,N′-diacetylchitobiose (7Muchmore A.V. Decker J.M. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 2541-2546PubMed Google Scholar, 8Fukushima K. Watanabe H. Takeo K. Nomura M. Asahi T. Yamashita K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 304: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Since uromodulin has not only asparagine-N-linked sugar chains but also a GPI-anchored glycan at the carboxyl-terminal end (35Rindler M.J. Naik S.S. Li N. Hoops T.C. Peraldi M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20784-20789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it seems important to ascertain in the near future whether TNF-α and lymphotoxin have the same carbohydrate binding specificities as IL-1β. Although the physiological function of the lectin-like character of these cytokines remains to be studied, several possible roles may be considered as follows. It has been reported that TNF-α exerts a direct trypanolytic activity on salivarian trypanosomes (36Lucas R. Magez S. De Leys R. Fransen L. Scheerlinck J-P. Rampelberg M. Sablon E. De Baetselier P. Science. 1994; 263: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This activity is not blocked by soluble 55-kDa and 75-kDa TNF receptors, but is potently inhibited by N,N′-diacetylchitobiose and the hexapeptide of TNF-α, Thr105 to Glu110, implying the existence of an alternative recognition domain of TNF-α for constituents of trypanosome parasites (36Lucas R. Magez S. De Leys R. Fransen L. Scheerlinck J-P. Rampelberg M. Sablon E. De Baetselier P. Science. 1994; 263: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). It is of interest to determine whether this recognition region of TNF-α shows binding activity specific for mannose 6-phosphate diester in the glycan of the GPI anchor, i.e. the same lectin-like specificity as IL-1β. Such a lectin-like activity of TNF-α may exhibit such alternative recognition of microbial constituents. As another physiological role of the lectin-like interaction between rhIL-1β and the GPI anchor, the latter may function as a modulator of IL-1 receptors. Although two types of IL-1 receptors have been identified (37Slack J. McMahan C.J. Waugh S. Schooley K. Spriggs M.K. Sims J.E. Dower S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2513-2524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it remains to be established whether the cloned IL-1 receptor by itself has the ability to generate signals or whether it is linked to an unidentified signal transducer or effector. It is clear only that the two different IL-1 receptors function independently at the level of ligand binding and do not form a heterodimeric receptor complex even when they are present on the same cell (37Slack J. McMahan C.J. Waugh S. Schooley K. Spriggs M.K. Sims J.E. Dower S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2513-2524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The GPI anchor portions that are recognized with low affinity by IL-1β may serve only to bind ligand and deliver it or enhance binding to the type I and/or II receptor(s), which would be capable of binding ligands and delivering the signal into cells, as in the case of the interleukin-2 system (38Hatakeyama M. Tsudo M. Minamoto S. Kono T. Doi T. Miyata T. Miyasaka M. Taniguchi T. Science. 1989; 244: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar) or growth factors such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (2Gordon M.Y. Riley G.P. Watt S.M. Greaves M.F. Nature. 1987; 326: 403-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), heparin-binding growth factor (3Rosengart T.K. Johnson W.V. Friesel R. Clark R. Maciag T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 152: 432-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), basic fibroblast growth factor (4Bashkin P. Doctrow S. Klagsbrun M. Svahn C. Folkman J. Vlodavsky I. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1737-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 5Seno M. Sasada R. Kurokawa T. Igarashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 188: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), or the midkine-heparan sulfate interaction (6Tomomura M. Kadomatsu K. Nakamoto M. Muramatsu H. Kondoh H. Imagawa K. Muramatsu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The growth factors show low affinity for heparan sulfate, which behaves as an accessory molecule required for binding of growth factors to the high affinity receptors on the plasma membrane. Such an obligatory relationship of low and high affinity cytokine receptors suggests a physiological role for heparan sulfate and the GPI anchor as low affinity receptors and constitutes a novel mechanism for the regulation of cytokine-mediated signal transduction. It is reported that some IL-1β-specific binding structures with low affinity are present on the cell wall of virulent bacteria (39Porat R. Clark B.D. Wolff S.M. Dinarello C.A. Science. 1991; 254: 430-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and in supernatants from vaccinia virus-infected CV-1 cells (40Spriggs M.K. Hruby D.E. Maliszewski C.R. Pickup D.J. Sims J.E. Buller R.M. Vanslyke J. Cell. 1992; 71: 145-152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In these cases, the role of binding to IL-1β is thought to prohibit or diminish the inflammatory effects of the cytokine produced by infected cells. The low affinity binding of the GPI anchor portion to IL-1β may have a similar role in regulating the effects of IL-1β, which are induced by binding of IL-1β to type I and/or II receptor(s). The results so far described support the view that these lectin-like activities of cytokines are fundamental to immunology and bring some additional information to light concerning the functional role of the GPI anchor."

Dramatic morphological changes occur in the parietal cell during the gastric acid secretory cycle: that is (a) the fusion of intracellular tubulovesicles that contain proton pump (gastric H+,K+-ATPase) with the apical membranes upon stimulation of acid secretion and (b) subsequent membrane retrieval and recycling (1Helander H.F.

Cytoskeletal proteins such as actin, spectrin, and ankyrin have been shown to be involved in the fusion process (3Mercier F. Reggio H. Devilliers G. Bataille D. Mangeat P. J.

Then DLs were dialyzed at 4 °C for more than 16 h against the same buffer solution. The final liposome concentration was about 0.4 μmol of NBD-labeled phospholipid/ml. A gastric microsomal fraction prepared from hog gastric mucosa was used (15Takeguchi N. Joshima R. Inoue Y. Kashiwagura T. Morii M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3094-3098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When this microsomal fraction is one-step further purified by discontinuous density gradient ultracentrifugation, so-called gastric vesicles are obtained (15Takeguchi N. Joshima R. Inoue Y. Kashiwagura T. Morii M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3094-3098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As found for the case of DLs and secretory vesicles (10Ruetz S. Gros P. Cell. 1994; 77: 1071-1081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar), NBD-labeled phospholipids were transferred from DLs into the mostly outer leaflet of the bilayer of the microsomes by simple incubation of a mixture of the microsomal fraction and DLs for 30 min on ice, where the concentration of NBD-phospholipid in the mixture was adjusted to about 5 nmol NBD-phospholipid/mg protein. Then this mixture was applied on the top layer of discontinuous density gradient solutions consisting of a 250 mm sucrose solution (top layer), a mixture of 3.1% Ficoll 400 and 250 mm sucrose (middle layer), and a mixture of 7% Ficoll 400 and 250 mm sucrose (bottom layer), and ultracentrifuged using a vertical rotor (Hitachi RPV50T, 132,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C). This centrifugation separated the gastric microsomal fraction from DLs, accompanying further purification of the microsomes and resulting in production of gastric vesicles. Gastric vesicles (their diameter was about 0.2 μm) were recovered from the boundary between the middle and bottom layers. Small DLs (their diameter was about 0.03 μm) were recovered from the boundary between the top and middle layers. The tightness of the vesicle membrane was determined by the increase in K+stimulation of ATPase activity in the presence of KCl due to the ionophore, nigericin (16Shin J.M. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1904-1908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The K+-ATPase activity in the presence of 1 μg/ml nigericin, 20 mm KCl, 130 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, and 40 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.40) in the presence of an ATP regeneration system (see the following section of “Assay of Mg2+-ATPase Activity”), was 50.5 μmol Pi/mg·h at 37 °C, and in the absence of nigericin, 3.7 μmol Pi/mg·h. These results indicated that about 93% of vesicles were tightly sealed. Similar experiments at 25 °C gave 97%, indicating that almost all gastric vesicles were tightly sealed. The tightness of the vesicle membrane was also evaluated by their ability to accumulate proton into the vesicles; the rate of active H+ uptake of NBD-labeled vesicles was almost the same as that of unlabeled control vesicles. Gastric vesicles containing NBD-labeled phospholipid were stored at −85 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al.(17Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. When indicated, isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles containing NBD-C12-HPC were used in place of gastric vesicles. Sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles were prepared from rabbit leg and back muscles (18Morii M. Danko S. Kim D.H. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2343-2348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and were incubated with DLs and separated by ultracentrifugation. The labeling efficiency of sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles with NBD-C12-HPC was the same as that of gastric vesicles, and the integrity of sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane bilayer was not damaged by this labeling. Gastric vesicles (typically, 20 μg/ml) labeled with NBD-phospholipid were preincubated at 37 °C for 10 min in 2 ml of solution containing 130 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, and 40 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.40) in a fluorescence cuvette. Unless indicated, K+ was absent in this solution. Fluorescence emission from NBD-labeled phospholipid associated with the outer and inner leaflets of the membranes bilayer of tight gastric vesicles was monitored using a Shimadzu Spectrofluorophotometer (RF-5000) equipped with a temperature-controlled water jacket and a magnetic stirrer. Fluorescence intensity was recorded at a wavelength of 530 nm with a 10-nm slit width using an excitation wavelength of 470 nm with a 5-nm slit width. After another incubation for the predetermined periods (10–480 min) in the absence and the presence of ATP and chemicals indicated, the fluorescence intensity was recorded (FT). Then 20 μl of 1 m sodium dithionite in 1 mTris (pH 10) was added to reduce the fluorescent aryl-nitro group of NBD-labeled phospholipid associated with the outer leaflet of the vesicle membrane bilayer, and the fluorescence intensity was recorded after 10 min (FD). Membrane-impermeable sodium dithionite reduced only the NBD-labeled phospholipid present in the outer leaflet (10Ruetz S. Gros P. Cell. 1994; 77: 1071-1081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Then NBD-phospholipid fluorescence associated with the inner leaflet of the vesicle membrane bilayer was quenched by sodium dithionite after disrupting the vesicles by the addition of 80 μl of a 25% (w/v) Triton X-100, and the fluorescence intensity was recorded (F0). The fraction of NBD-labeled phospholipid in the outer leaflet was calculated by the following equation (10Ruetz S. Gros P. Cell. 1994; 77: 1071-1081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar): percentage of outer leaflet = 100 [(FT − FD)/(FT − F0)], and that of inner leaflet was calculated by: percentage of inner leaflet = 100 [(FD − F0)/(FT − F0)]. When indicated, the translocation (flippase) activity, as evidenced by increase in “% of inner leaflet” was measured as a function of ATP concentrations (2–1,000 μm), where the ATP concentration was kept constant during the incubation period of 20 min by an ATP regeneration system (see the following section of “Assay of Mg2+-ATPase Activity”). The rate of H+ uptake into gastric vesicles was measured from the quench of fluorescence of acridine orange (19Morii M. Hayata Y. Mizoguchi K. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4068-4072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 10 μg/ml of gastric vesicles, 4 mmMgCl2, 130 mm KCl, 40 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.40), 5 μm acridine orange, and 10 μg/ml of valinomycin. The rate of H+ uptake was determined as the initial slope of fluorescence quench after the addition of 2 mm ATP at 37 °C. The fluorescence intensity was recorded at a wavelength of 525 nm with a 3-nm slit width using an excitation wavelength of 495 nm with a 3-nm slit width. When Mg2+-ATPase activity was measured as a function of ATP concentrations from 2 to 1,000 μm, the ATP concentrations were kept constant during the experiments by use of a pyruvate kinase-lactate dehydrogenase-linked reaction where hydrolysis of ATP is coupled with oxidation of NADH (19Morii M. Hayata Y. Mizoguchi K. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4068-4072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 20Scharschmidt B.F. Keeffe E.B. Blankenship N.M. Ockner R.K. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1979; 93: 790-799PubMed Google Scholar). Although pyruvate kinase requires K+ under normal conditions, we employed the condition that did not require K+, taking the fact into consideration that high concentrations of Na+ activate pyruvate kinase without K+ (21Kayne F.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 143: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 20 μg/ml of gastric vesicles, 40 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.40), 130 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 100 μm NADH, 0.8 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 10 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 15.5 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, and ATP at the indicated concentrations. The decrease in the amount of NADH was measured at 37 °C with a Beckman DU7500 photodiode array spectrophotometer in a dual wavelength mode at 340 and 500 nm. ATP hydrolyzing activity was calibrated by the addition of a known amount of ADP to a reaction mixture. Mg2+-activated ATP hydrolyzing activity was expressed as μmol of liberated inorganic phosphate/mg protein·h (μmol Pi/mg·h). When indicated, Mg2+-ATPase activity was measured by the Yoda-Hokin method (22Yoda A. Hokin L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 40: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), where the reaction was performed in the presence of 2 mm ATP without the ATP regeneration system. Fig.1 shows effects of a 120-min incubation in the presence and the absence of ATP on the fluorescence that comes from both the inner and outer leaflets of the membrane bilayer of gastric vesicles. The absolute fluorescence level of gastric vesicles incubated in the presence of ATP did not differ from that incubated in the absence of ATP. Then 10 mm sodium dithionite was added, which induced the decrease in the fluorescence. The fluorescence level depended on the presence and the absence of ATP (Fig. 1). This decrease was attributed to the reduction of the aryl-nitro group of NBD-C12-HPC to the aryl-amino group in the outer leaflet. The subsequent addition of Triton X-100 (its final concentration was 1%) destroyed the vesicle membrane, and sodium dithionite reduced NBD-C12-HPC in the inner leaflet (maybe, also in the intravesicular space). The final level (F0) did not depend on the presence and the absence of ATP. From this particular experiment shown in Fig. 1, the fraction of NBD-C12-HPC in the inner leaflet after a 130-min incubation was calculated to be 11.5 and 20.9% in the absence and the presence of ATP, respectively. Incubation with 2 mm ATP, therefore, increased the fraction of inner NBD-C12-HPC by about 82%. Fig. 2 shows the time-dependent increase in the fraction of inner NBD-C12-HPC. This result indicates that NBD-C12-HPC in the outer leaflet of the vesicle lipid bilayer was significantly translocated into the inner leaflet and/or the inner space of vesicles. The translocation was saturable.Figure 2Time-dependent translocation of NBD-C12-HPC from the outer (cytosolic) to inner (luminal) leaflet of the gastric vesicle membrane. The fraction of NBD-C12-HPC in the inner leaflet of gastric vesicle membrane was measured as described in the legend of Fig. 1 at various incubation periods at 37 °C in the presence (○) and the absence of 2 mm ATP (•). Two mm ATP was supplemented to the medium after a 3-h incubation period. The values are the means ± S.E. (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) When AMP or AMPPNP was used in place of ATP, the flippase activity was not found (Fig. 3). In the case of ADP, an apparent flippase activity was observed. However, this activity was completely inhibited by Ap5A, a specific inhibitor of adenylate kinase (23Lienhard G.E. Secemski I.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 1121-1123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that part of ADP was changed into ATP and AMP by adenylate kinase which was reported to be present in the gastric vesicle preparation (24Rabon E. Sachs G. Mårdh S. Wallmark B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 688: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Without Mg2+, no ATP-dependent flippase activity was observed, indicating that this NBD-C12-HPC flippase activity requests not the binding but hydrolysis of ATP. Fig. 4 shows that transbilayer motion of glycerophospholipids occurs identically for phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine in the presence of ATP and Mg2+. AMPPNP was not effective. We could not find the phosphatidylcholine flippase activity in isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles that contain Ca2+-ATPase (data not shown), indicating that the flippase activity found in gastric vesicles, therefore, is not commonly associated with P-type ATPases. Effects of K+ (0.3–65 mm) on the phospholipid flippase activity were measured in the solution containing 20 μg/ml NBD-C12-HPC-labeled gastric vesicles, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 40 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.40), and various concentrations of KCl and NaCl, where the sum of the K+ and Na+concentrations was constant (130 mm). Under the conditions, K+ gives no effect on the phospholipid flippase activity (data not shown). The concentration-dependent inhibition of the flippase activity by orthovanadate is shown in Fig.5. Orthovanadate at 10 and 100 μm inhibits the flippase activity by 10 and 25%, respectively. At the same concentrations of orthovanadate, the rate of H+ uptake into gastric vesicles was inhibited by 20 and 88%, respectively. TableI shows that 100 μm N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, an inhibitor of mitochondrial F0F1-ATPase, does not inhibit the flippase activity. Verapamil, which inhibits both activities of the mouse mdr2 gene product (phosphatidylcholine flippase) and the mouse mdr3 gene product (multidrug resistance efflux pump) (10Ruetz S. Gros P. Cell. 1994; 77: 1071-1081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar), did not inhibit the present flippase activity (Table I). DIDS (10 μm), which is used as an anion channel inhibitor, significantly inhibited the flippase activity, although diphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid (100 μm), which is also an anion channel inhibitor, did not inhibit the flippase activity (Table I). 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, which at 2 mm inhibited the ATP-dependent phosphatidylserine translocation from the luminal to cytosolic leaflet of the bilayer of chromaffin granule membrane (9Zachowski A. Henry J.P. Devaux P.F. Nature. 1989; 340: 75-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), did not inhibit the present gastric flippase activity. Progesterone, vinblastine, and tamoxifen, which are substrates of multidrug resistance pump and inhibit multidrug resistance pump, did not inhibit the flippase activity (Table I).Table IEffects of several agents on the ATP-dependent flippase activityAgentPercentage of controlDCCD (100 μm)112.7 ± 19.0 (3)DIDS (10 μm)16.1 ± 12.1 (3)1-aThe difference between control and DIDS is significant (p < 0.01 by unpaired Student's t test).DPC (100 μm)117.0 ± 12.0 (4)Verapamil (10 μm)97.1 ± 17.0 (3)Progesterone (10 μm)82.7 ± 2.8 (3)Vinblastine (10 μm)88.7 ± 17.2 (3)Tamoxifen (10 μm)116.5 ± 12.5 (3)N-Ethylmaleimide (1 mm)100.7 ± 19.6 (3)a The difference between control and DIDS is significant (p < 0.01 by unpaired Student's t test). Open table in a new tab Next, we studied effects of ATP concentrations on activities of phosphatidylcholine translocation and Mg2+-ATPase under the same conditions, that is, both solutions contained 20 μg/ml of gastric vesicles, 40 mmTris/HCl (pH 7.40), 130 mm NaCl, 4 mmMgCl2, 100 μm NADH, 0.8 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 10 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 15.5 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, and ATP at the indicated concentrations, which were kept constant during the incubation period. Fig.6 A demonstrates that the Mg2+-ATPase activity shows high and low affinities for ATP (K m = 1.6 and 80 μm determined from the double reciprocal plot), whereas the flippase activity shows one affinity for ATP (K m = 3.1 μm). Fig.6 B shows detailed comparison of the ATP dependences between the flippase and Mg2+-ATPase activities in the range of low ATP concentrations (0–50 μm ATP). In this range, both the flippase activity (the amount of NBD-C12-HPC translocated in 20 min) and the Mg2+-ATPase activity followed single Michaelis-Menten enzyme reaction equations. These results indicate that NBD-C12-HPC was translocated as a substrate by the putative Mg2+-ATP-dependent flippase. SCH 28080 is a reversible K+-competitive inhibitor of gastric H+,K+-ATPase (25Wallmark B. Briving C. Fryklund J. Munson K. Jackson R. Mendlein J. Rabon E. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2077-2084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Effects of SCH 28080 on the flippase and Mg2+-ATPase activities were measured under the same conditions: that is, the both experimental solutions contained 20 μg/ml of gastric vesicles, 130 mmNaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, and 40 mmTris/HCl (pH 7.40). After a 10-min incubation with various concentration of SCH 28080, 2 mm ATP was added to start the flippase reaction. Here, the amount of NBD-C12-HPC translocated from the outer to inner leaflet of the bilayer for 1 h in the presence of 2 mm ATP was measured. The amount of liberated inorganic phosphate for 1 h was measured by the Yoda-Hokin method (22Yoda A. Hokin L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 40: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Fig. 7 shows that SCH 28080 concentration-dependently inhibits the flippase activity, its IC50 value for NBD-C12-HPC being about 0.14 μm. Furthermore, we measured the inhibition of NBD-PS and NBD-PE translocations by SCH 28080 and found the IC50values of 0.25 and 0.20 μm, respectively. These IC50 values were not significantly different. The K+-ATPase activity of gastric vesicles measured in the presence of 15 mm KCl and 10 μg/ml of valinomycin was inhibited by SCH 28080 (IC50 = 0.2 μm) (26Asano S. Inoie M. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13263-13268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that SCH 28080 partially inhibited the Mg2+-ATPase activity of gastric vesicles (27Keeling D.J. Laing S.M. Senn-Bilfinger J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 2231-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Fig. 7shows that about 56% of the Mg2+-ATPase activity is inhibited by 10 μm SCH 28080, whereas 96% of the flippase activity is inhibited by 10 μm SCH 28080, suggesting that only part of the Mg2+-ATPase activity contributed to the flippase activity. From Fig. 7, IC50value for the SCH 28080-inhibitable fraction of the Mg2+-ATPase activity was obtained to be 0.13 μm. We have found that the Mg2+-ATP-dependent phospholipid flippase is present in hog gastric vesicles. Fluorescent analogues of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylethanolamine, which are distributed more densely in the outer (cytosolic) leaflet of the vesicle membrane bilayer than in the inner (luminal) leaflet (6Olaisson H. Mårdh S. Arvidson G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11262-11267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were translocated from the outer to inner leaflet of the bilayer in a same manner. It does not require the presence of K+ and is relatively insensitive to orthovanadate, discriminating this flippase from H+,K+-ATPase. The translocation (flippase) activity depends on the ATP concentration. The K mvalue of 3.1 μm was obtained from the experiments of a 20-min incubation (Fig. 6). When the incubation period was increased to 1 h, the value of K m increased to 9 μm (data not shown), indicating that theK m value would be smaller than 3.1 μmif the initial rate of the flippase activity were plotted against the ATP concentration. Therefore, the K m value of 3.1 μm may be comparable with that of the high affinity Mg2+-ATPase activity of gastric vesicles (1.6 μm). The low affinity Mg2+-ATPase activity (K m = 80 μm) seems to have no contribution to the flippase activity (Fig. 6 A). From these results, we suggest that the phospholipid flippase activity may be attributed mostly to the high affinity Mg2+-ATPase activity of gastric vesicles. Furthermore, the IC50 value obtained from the inhibition of the flippase activity by SCH 28080 (IC50 = 0.14–0.25 μm; Fig. 7, 1-h incubation) was comparable with the value obtained from the SCH 28080-sensitive Mg2+-ATPase activity (0.13 μm). This fact may indicate that the flippase activity mostly owes to the SCH 28080-sensitive Mg2+-ATPase activity. Verapamil is known to inhibit the flippase activity of mousemdr2 gene product (10Ruetz S. Gros P. Cell. 1994; 77: 1071-1081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). As shown in Table I, verapamil did not inhibit the present flippase activity in gastric vesicles. Furthermore, substrates of multidrug resistance pump (P-glycoprotein) such as progesterone, tamoxifen, and vinblastine did not inhibit this flippase activity (Table I). Tamoxifen is also known to inhibit the volume-activated Cl− channel (28Valverde M.A. Mintenig G.M. Sepulveda F.V. Pflügers Archiv. Eur. J. Physiol. 1993; 425: 552-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 29Tominaga M. Tominaga T. Miwa A. Okada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27887-27893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Similarly, a Cl−channel inhibitor diphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid did not inhibit this phospholipid flippase, although DIDS, which binds to amino residue and inhibits anion channels, inhibits the flippase. The direction of the ATP-dependent phospholipid transporting activity of the present gastric flippase andmdr2 gene product is from the cytosolic to luminal leaflet of the lipid bilayer, whereas that of ATP-dependent aminophospholipid translocase in erythrocyte and chromaffin granules is opposite. Mouse mdr2 gene product plays an essential role in the secretion of phosphatidylcholine across the canalicular membrane into bile (10Ruetz S. Gros P. Cell. 1994; 77: 1071-1081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Aminophospholipids such as phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine are confined to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane by aminophospholipid translocase (8Seigneuret M. Devaux P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3751-3755Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar), and the appearance of phosphatidylserine on the surface of animal cells triggers phagocytosis (30Fadok V.A. Voelker D.R. Campbell P.A. Cohen J.J. Bratton D.L. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2207-2216PubMed Google Scholar) and blood coagulation (31Schroit A. Zwaal R.F.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 313-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). ATPase II of chromaffin granule membrane was assigned to be this aminophospholipid translocase (32Moriyama Y. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8521-8527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the gene that codes for this ATPase was cloned (33Tang X. Halleck M.S. Schlegel R.A. Williamson P. Science. 1996; 272: 1495-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The ATPase II is a member of an ancient subfamily of P-type ATPases. The role of the present flippase is unknown. Several types of flippase functions are considered to be involved in the acid secretory and cytoprotective mechanisms. First, stimulation of the parietal cell by histamine and gastrin causes great morphological changes. One such event is the fusion of tubulovesicles (gastric vesicles) with the apical membrane accompanying increase in the area of the external plasma membrane as evidenced by increase in the external membrane capacitance (34Hashimoto A. Hazama A. Kotera T. Ueda S. Okada Y. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1992; 422: 84-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The fusion process will request the presence of flippase to readjust the balance of phospholipids between the outer and inner leaflets of the lipid bilayer, for example, enabling a curvature change in the membrane. Second, there are several lines of evidence that gastric mucus is protected against the back diffusion of acid by a hydrophobic barrier comprising of surface-active phospholipids (35Hills B.A. Butler B.D. Lichtenberger L.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 244: G561-G568PubMed Google Scholar). Electron microscopic observations indicated that deeper mucus-free epithelial surfaces of oxyntic ducts and parietal cells were also covered by oligolamellar lining of phospholipids mainly phosphatidylcholine (36Hills B.A. Aust. N. Z. J. Med. 1992; 22: 441-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), which may be secreted by flippase. Other roles of flippases are also considered. The role of the present flippase in gastric parietal cells is necessary to be clarified in future studies. The present new gastric phospholipid flippase is an interesting object because only several ATP-dependent flippases are known, and the properties of the present flippase are different from previously known phospholipid flippases."

In this study, the mechanism of arachidonic acid export has been examined using inside-out plasma membrane vesicles from pig polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Tritiated arachidonic acid associated rapidly with the membrane vesicles and crossed the membrane into the intravesicular space in a time-dependent and saturable manner. Half the maximal influx rate was measured at an arachidonate concentration of 5.7 μm, and a maximal influx velocity of 3.0 nmol/mg × min was determined at pH 6.8. Influx into vesicles was sensitive to a number of common anion transport inhibitors including pentachlorophenol, phloretin, diiodosalicylic acid, and quercetin as well as to the proteases trypsin and Pronase, suggesting a protein-dependent process. Furthermore, influx was temperature-sensitive with an energy of activation of 11.6 kcal/mol. Varying extravesicular concentration of ATP, Na+, or K+ had no impact on arachidonate influx, whereas changes in pH had a profound effect; optimum transport activity was observed at an extravesicular pH of 6, whereas raising the pH to 9.5 essentially abolished uptake.

Haematol. 1993; 6: 593-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) into the plasma where they may amplify or perpetuate the acute inflammatory response. Recent progress in leukotriene research has led to a more detailed understanding of the molecular biology and enzymology of the oxidative metabolism of arachidonic acid and to the development of potent inhibitors of biosynthesis as well as receptor antagonists interfering with signal transduction (6Bjornsdottir U.S. Bush R.K. Immunol. Allergy Clin. North Am. 1993; 13: 861-890Google Scholar, 7Cohen N. Yagaloff K.A. Curr. Opin. Invest. Drugs. 1994; 3: 13-22Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The mechanism of how eicosanoids, once biosynthesized, leave the producer cell to reach their target cell is, however, still poorly understood. Recently, an ATP-driven export pump for cysteinyl leukotrienes has been identified in hepatocytes (8Ishikawa T. Müller M. Klünemann C. Schaub T. Keppler D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19279-19286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), erythrocytes (9Ishikawa T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 463-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar), and heart cells (9Ishikawa T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 463-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 10Ishikawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17343-17348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, in intact PMN a LTB4 export carrier has been identified and characterized (11Lam B.K. Gagnon L. Austen K.F. Soberman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13438-13441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To study the cellular export mechanism, whole cell systems are too complex to allow the accurate measurement of transport kinetics and of the effects of inhibitors. Furthermore, the situation for PMN is particularly complex since these cells do not only biosynthesize and release eicosanoids but also avidly take up and metabolize arachidonic acid, LTA4 (1Grimminger F. Sibelius U. Seeger W. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: L195-L203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Sala A. Bolla M. Zarini S. Muller-Peddinghaus R. Folco G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17944-17948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and LTB4 (12Brom J. Konig W. Immunology. 1989; 68: 479-485PubMed Google Scholar). To overcome those restrictions imposed by whole cell systems to the investigation of transport mechanisms, we prepared inside-out plasma membrane vesicles from PMN and investigated the usefulness of this system to study eicosanoid transport using arachidonic acid as a ligand. Inside-out plasma membrane vesicles without contamination with right side-out vesicles were prepared by isolating phagocytic vesicles from PMN. When a PMN engulfs particles, the ingested material is encased within a vesicle derived from the plasma membrane with an inside-out orientation (13Stossel T.P. Pollard T.D. Mason R.J. Vaughan M. J. Clin. Invest. 1971; 50: 1745-1747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After phagocytosis of albumin-coated mineral oil droplets, those phagocytic vesicles can readily be isolated and have been used for Ca2+ export studies (14Volpi M. Naccache P.H. Sha'afi R.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 106: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The mechanism of the translocation process of fatty acids through the plasma membrane in general is controversial (15Berk P.D. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1996; 212: 1-4Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On one hand, it is argued that fatty acid movement through the phospholipid bilayer is an entirely unregulated process in which diffusion of fatty acids in either direction of the membrane is driven by concentration gradients (16Zakim D. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1996; 212: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Juxtaposed to the diffusion hypotheses, there is increasing evidence for a facilitated protein-dependent transport pathway for long chain fatty acids. Five putative fatty acid transport proteins have been identified in the plasma membrane of several tissues including adipocytes, liver, endothelium, brain, intestine, kidney, lung, skeletal, and cardiac muscle. For three of these cDNA clones have been isolated (reviewed in Ref. 15Berk P.D. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1996; 212: 1-4Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Schaffer and Lodish (17Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar) first succeeded not only in expression cloning and purification of one putative carrier protein but could also reconstitute transport function, thus directly demonstrating its physiological role. The results reported herein meet several criteria for a protein-facilitated export mechanism for arachidonic acid in PMN plasma membrane vesicles, such as substrate saturation, inhibition by a variety of anion transport inhibitors (18Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C761-C782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and sensitivity toward proteases. The ionic mechanism seems to be that of an H+ + arachidonate cotransport system operating with an energy of activation of 11.6 kcal/mol. With the transport assay presented here, it may be possible to separate the transport processes out of the complex cascade of events starting after activation of PMN by various stimuli to study the mechanism(s) of putative eicosanoid transporters and to investigate the impact of leukotriene inhibitors on transport. Mineral oil (M-5904), lipopolysaccharide O26:B6 (L-3755), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Triton X-100, and PIPES dipotassium salt were from Sigma. Ficoll-Paque, dextran T-500, and ConA-Sepharose were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Arachidonic acid was from Fluka, and [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H]arachidonic acid (230.5 Ci/mmol) was purchased from DuPont NEN. Fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin was from Boehringer Mannheim. Arterial blood was collected from 3 to 4-month old pigs using sterile Na2EDTA (2.14 g/liter) as an anticoagulant. The whole blood was centrifuged at 200 × g for 15 min, and the platelet-rich supernatant was discarded. PMN were prepared by dextran sedimentation, hypotonic lysis of remaining erythrocytes, and centrifugation on Ficoll-Paque, as described (19Jakobsson P.J. Odlander B. Claesson H.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Purified PMN (50 × 106/ml) were resuspended in modified Hank's buffer (124 mm NaCl, 4.9 mm KCl, 0.66 mmNa2HPO4, 0.64 mmKH2PO4, 15 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and incubated with a mineral oil emulsion, essentially as described (13Stossel T.P. Pollard T.D. Mason R.J. Vaughan M. J. Clin. Invest. 1971; 50: 1745-1747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 volume of mineral oil and 4 volumes of modified Hank's buffer containing 20 mg/ml fatty acid-free albumin were mixed and sonicated in a Branson Sonicator (Cell Disrupter B15), with a micro tip for 2 × 1 min, setting 5. The oil emulsion was centrifuged for 5 min at 1600 × g, and the thin layer of coacervated droplets at the surface was removed. The remaining stable emulsion was mixed with 1 volume of fresh pig serum. One volume of this oil emulsion was added to 10 volumes of PMN suspension at 4 °C. Phagocytosis was initiated by the addition of 0.9 mm CaCl2, 1.27 mmMgCl2, and 10 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide and warmed to 37 °C. After 30 min incubation at 37 °C under gentle stirring, cells were separated from residual emulsion by centrifugation at 250 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and washed twice with Hank's buffer. Finally, the cells were suspended in modified relaxation buffer (20Borregaard N. Heiple J.M. Simons E.R. Clark R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar) (100 mm KCl, 3 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm PIPES-HCl, pH 6.8), treated with 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm1,4-dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.25 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor and subjected to nitrogen cavitation (200 p.s.i. for 20 min). After addition of 1.25 mm EGTA, the suspension was centrifuged at 48,000 ×g for 30 min. Liberated phagocytic vesicles floating on the top of the tubes were collected with a spatula and resuspended in 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Inside-out plasma membrane vesicles were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −20 °C until use. Protein was determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (21Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar). ConA affinity chromatography was performed at 4 °C as described by Del Buono et al. (22Del Buono B.J. Luscinskas F.W. Simons E.R. J. Cell Physiol. 1989; 141: 636-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). ConA-Sepharose was added to polypropylene columns to give a packed bed volume of 3 ml, and columns were washed with degassed relaxation buffer with and without addition of 0.1% BSA. Samples of membrane vesicles or intact PMN in modified relaxation buffer were added to the columns in a volume of 1–3 ml and incubated for 10 min. Nonadherent vesicles were eluted with ice-cold modified relaxation buffer, and protein in the fractions was quantified by the bicinchoninic acid assay (21Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar). About 95–98% of the phagocytic vesicles were found in the first 6 ml of the eluate, whereas intact PMN almost completely (>95%) adhered to the columns. Based on the assumption that ConA receptors are found exclusively on the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane of PMN (22Del Buono B.J. Luscinskas F.W. Simons E.R. J. Cell Physiol. 1989; 141: 636-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), from these experiments a low contamination of the inside-out membrane vesicles by right side-out vesicles or plasma membrane fragments was concluded. Vesicles in modified relaxation buffer were fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde at 4 °C overnight. Material was rinsed with relaxation buffer, followed by a 1.5-h fixation with osmium tetroxide in the same buffer. For en bloc staining, vesicles were incubated with 1% uranyl acetate in 20% acetone for 1.5 h, and dehydration was performed with a graded acetone series. Samples were then infiltrated and embedded in Spurr's low viscosity resin. After polymerization, sections were cut, mounted on colloidin-coated copper grids, and post-stained with aqueous lead citrate (3%, pH 13.0). All micrographs were taken on an EM 109 electron microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) The standard incubation medium contained plasma membrane vesicles (20 μg of protein) in modified relaxation buffer (100 mm KCl, 3 mm NaCl, 3.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm PIPES-HCl, pH 6.8) in a final volume of 200 μl. Tritiated arachidonic acid was added as a 50% ethanolic solution. The final ethanol concentrations never exceeded 0.5% and did not influence transport activity. Since a substantial portion of the added arachidonate bound to the walls of the container, the actual arachidonate concentration in each experiment was determined by scintillation counting of an aliquot of the incubations. All concentrations of arachidonate were corrected for adsorption losses to container walls. The incubations were carried out at 37 °C and terminated by the addition of 800 μl of ice-cold stop solution containing modified relaxation buffer, pH 6.8, 0.5 mmpentachlorophenol, and 0.5% albumin and then further incubated for 5 min on ice. The sample was pipetted onto a Schleicher & Schuell filter GF 52 (24 mm) and filtered using a filtration manifold (DN 025/1, Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany). Subsequently, vesicles were washed with 1 ml of stop solution and 3 ml of relaxation buffer. The filters were placed in scintillation vials and left overnight in 5 ml of Rotizint Eco Plus (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) before radioactivity was counted and corrected for adsorption of unbound arachidonate to the filters. Vesicles prepared for electron microscopy consisted primarily of membrane-bound vesicles (0.1–1.2 μm) and some associated granules. These isolated vesicles were identical to the phagocytic vesicles seen in intact cells after phagocytosis of albumin-coated mineral oil droplets. The vesicle membrane was clearly trilaminar and identical in appearance and dimensions to the plasma membrane. The membrane encloses the lipid droplet with an amorphous electron-dense periphery representing the albumin coat of the lipid droplet. There was essentially no contamination of the vesicles by mitochondria, glycogen particles, nuclei, or other cytoplasmic matter except for some granules associated with the vesicles, Fig.1. Application of phagosomes to a ConA affinity column revealed that only a small fraction (<2–5%) of the vesicles was bound to the column, whereas intact PMN adhered to the affinity material (>95%), demonstrating that the vesicles had indeed the inside-out orientation with little contamination of plasma membranes with exposed ConA receptors. Various concentrations of [3H]arachidonic acid were added as an ethanolic solution to a vesicle suspension (20 μg of protein in modified 200 μl of modified relaxation buffer) and incubated at 37 °C. A significant and constant portion of the added [3H]arachidonate was bound to the walls of the incubation container. About 50% of the added [3H]arachidonate was recovered when the incubation mixture from the Eppendorf tube was transferred to a scintillation vial and counted for radioactivity. From the residual arachidonate in the buffer (50%), a constant arachidonate portion (70.1%) associated with the vesicles in the concentration range tested (0.24–9772 pmol/sample) and was recovered with the vesicle membranes after rapid filtration (Fig. 2). During a 30-min incubation, the vesicle-associated arachidonate concentrations did not change. Adsorption of arachidonate to container walls is a common observation (23Samples D.R. Sprague E.A. Harper M.J. Herlihy J.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C1166-C1170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which makes it necessary to correct arachidonate concentrations for adsorption losses in every experiment. Vesicle association of unbound arachidonate is thought to represent absorption to the plasma membrane (24Dwight J.F. Hendry B.M. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1995; 238: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and uptake into the intravesicular space. To measure uptake accurately and to distinguish internalized ligand from that merely bound to the external surface of the vesicles, it is essential to employ a wash solution that blocks influx and efflux after certain periods of incubation and removes ligand bound to the external membrane of the vesicles (25Stremmel W. Berk P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3086-3090Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In previous studies, washes with a 0.1–0.5% albumin solution with or without addition of 200 μm of the transport inhibitor phloretin were generally used to remove fatty acids, which are exchangeably bound to the outer membrane leaflet, while preventing efflux (25Stremmel W. Berk P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3086-3090Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 26Gore J. Hoinard C. Couet C. Lipids. 1994; 29: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 27Schurer N.Y. Stremmel W. Grundmann J.U. Schliep V. Kleinert H. Bass N.M. Williams M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1211: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 28Zhou S.L. Stump D. Isola L. Berk P.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 29Abumrad N.A. Perkins R.C. Park J.H. Park C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9183-9191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We employed a 0.4% albumin solution containing 0.4 mm pentachlorophenol (PCP) for this purpose since PCP is a stronger influx/efflux inhibitor in our system. To evaluate the effectiveness of this wash solution in incubations with vesicle preparations, vesicle aliquots (20 μg of membrane protein) were incubated at 37 °C with various amounts of [3H]arachidonic acid at different time points, and vesicle association of radioactivity was measured after treatment with ice-cold BSA/PCP (stop/chase solution) as described under “Materials and Methods.” The vesicle-associated arachidonate resistance toward BSA/PCP extraction increased linearly within the first 120 s of incubation at 37 °C. The linear regression line of this time course was extrapolated to zero time to give the amount of arachidonate that could not be extracted by the BSA/PCP wash (determined for every arachidonate concentration tested). As much as 98.3% of the merely bound arachidonate at zero time could be extracted from the vesicles with BSA/PCP stop solution. A similar result was obtained when vesicles were incubated at 0 °C instead of 37 °C, even after prolonged incubation times. The non-extractable arachidonate increased in a linear fashion with increasing amounts of arachidonate (0.24–9772 pmol), Fig. 2. Thus, under the conditions employed, no saturable binding to putative receptors became apparent in the concentration range (1.22 nm to 48.9 μm) tested. Vesicles were incubated with 20 nm[3H]arachidonate (4 pmol/200 μl) in modified relaxation buffer, pH 6.8 at 37 °C, and reactions were terminated after various time points by treatment with ice-cold BSA/PCP stop solution as described under “Materials and Methods.” During incubation, the non-extractable portion of vesicle-associated arachidonate increased from 68 fmol (1.7%) at zero time to approximately 1 pmol (58.8%) after 60 min (total arachidonate corrected for losses to the test tube represents 1.7 pmol = 100%), Fig. 3. Increase of non-extractable arachidonate associated with the membrane vesicles could either reflect a time-dependent tight binding to high affinity binding sites at or in the membrane vesicles or influx to an as yet undefined compartment within the vesicles that is not accessible to BSA/PCP extraction. To distinguish between these possibilities, incubation of vesicles at 37 °C was terminated after 150 min by addition of ice-cold BSA/PCP stop solution and subjected to a 3 × 10-s sonication treatment on ice and filtered. Almost complete loss of vesicle-associated arachidonate that had been accumulated during incubation at 37 °C was observed after physical destruction of the vesicles by sonication, Fig. 3. To check whether the loss of radioactivity was due to the loss of sonicated membranes, aliquots of the same incubation mixture were subjected to sonication and filtration in the same way as before, except that the BSA/PCP solution was replaced by albumin-free modified relaxation buffer. These control experiments revealed that the recovery of vesicle membranes was not influenced by the sonication procedure, suggesting that the loss of radioactivity was due to liberation of arachidonic acid from the intravesicular space. Thus, the time-dependent vesicle association of non-extractable arachidonate is consistent with influx but not with binding to high affinity binding sites on the vesicle membranes. Vesicles (20 μg of protein/200 μl) were incubated with 4 pmol of arachidonic acid at 37 °C, and internalized [3H]arachidonic acid was quantitated after BSA/PCP treatment after various time points by rapid filtration and scintillation counting. Uptake was linear over a period of 120 s. To measure influx inhibition by PCP, PCP was added (0.4 mmfinal concentration) to aliquots of the suspension after 0 or 75 s. Addition of 0.4 mm PCP prevented influx of arachidonate. Furthermore, internalized arachidonate concentrations at the time of PCP addition remained almost at the same level over the entire incubation period of 1000 s, demonstrating an efficient and long lasting influx inhibition effect of PCP, Fig. 4. Since PCP did not only block influx into vesicles over prolonged incubation times at 37 °C, but also prevented losses of internalized arachidonic acid during the incubation, we tested the hypothesis whether PCP could also prevent vesicle efflux. Incubation of vesicles (20 μg of protein/200 μl) with 4 pmol of arachidonic acid resulted in a time-dependent increase of internalized arachidonate. Addition of BSA (0.4% final concentration) stopped the accumulation of arachidonate in the vesicles, and a time-dependent loss of intravesicular arachidonate was observed, reaching close to zero time levels after 50 min. In contrast, addition of BSA/PCP (0.4 mm PCP, 0.4% BSA) only resulted in a very little loss of internalized arachidonate. Inhibition of vesicle association as well as vesicle dissociation of the non-BSA/PCP extractable arachidonate cannot be explained on the basis of high affinity binding to putative receptors. Furthermore, inhibition of influx and efflux of arachidonate by the anion transport inhibitor PCP suggested a non-diffusional uptake and release of arachidonate. To study the effect of common anion transport inhibitors on arachidonate transport, a variety of structurally different inhibitors were preincubated with vesicles in modified relaxation buffer for 15 min before 4 pmol/200 μl of [3H]arachidonic acid were added. To determine internalized arachidonate after various incubation periods, 200-μl aliquots of the suspension (20 μg protein) were pipetted at desired time points into 0.8 ml of cold 0.5% BSA, 0.5 mm PCP and filtered after 5 min extraction time. Incubations were performed in triplicate, and initial influx rates were computed from the slope of the linear regression line over the first 120 s after arachidonate addition. Strong inhibition of the initial influx was observed by 1 mm quercetin (11.5 ± 1.5% of control, mean ± S.D.), 0.5 mm phloretin (9 ± 5.6%), 0.5 mm diiodosalicylic acid (10.3 ± 6.8%), and 0.5 mm pentachlorophenol (1.3 ± 0%), respectively (Fig.5). N-Ethylmaleimide had little, if any, effect on arachidonate influx. However, three other compounds that inhibit monocarboxylate (18Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C761-C782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or prostaglandin transport (30Kanai N. Lu R. Satriano J.A. Bao Y. Wolkoff A.W. Schuster V.L. Science. 1995; 268: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), 4-acetamido-4′-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid, α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate, and the dye bromcresol green, showed no effect on arachidonate influx. The effectiveness of common anion transport inhibitors is suggestive of non-diffusive uptake of arachidonic acid into the vesicles. Proteolytic digestion of vesicles is often employed as a key experiment to decide whether or not proteins are involved in transport processes. Since proteins facilitating transmembrane movement of ligands are often partially exposed on the membrane surface, they can be digested by proteases without damaging the membrane barrier (31Fitscher B.A. Elsing C. Riedel H.D. Gorski J. Stremmel W. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1996; 212: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Vesicles were preincubated in modified relaxation buffer with or without addition of Pronase (1 mg/ml) or trypsin (2.5 mg/ml) overnight. Preincubation with either Pronase or trypsin at 37 °C strongly inhibited the initial arachidonate influx into the vesicles. Pronase and trypsin digestion reduced initial influx rates to 12.7 ± 4.6 and 5.6 ± 2.1% of control (mean ± S.D., n= 3), respectively. Preincubation at 0 °C had no effect on the influx rates, suggesting that influx inhibition is indeed mediated by the enzymatic properties of the proteases and not by unspecific protein binding as seen with albumin. Inhibition of arachidonate influx by proteases suggested that at least one step in the mechanism of arachidonate influx is protein-dependent. Thus, arachidonic acid influx should be saturable by arachidonate. Initial arachidonic acid influx rates were determined as described above after addition of various amounts of arachidonate (final concentration 1.2 nm to 86.5 μm, corrected for adsorption losses to the container). At low ligand concentrations, the initial influx rates increased in a linear fashion with increasing arachidonic acid concentrations and appeared to saturate at higher arachidonate concentration (Fig. 6). The data were fitted against the Michaelis-Menten equation by nonlinear regression analysis. At a vesicle protein concentration of 100 μg/ml, a half-maximal influx rate was calculated for an arachidonate concentration of 5.7 ± 1.9 μm, and a V max of 3.0 ± 0.2 nmol/min × mg was obtained. The data were replotted according to Lineweaver-Burk giving a linear regression line (Fig. 6,inset). To determine whether arachidonate influx is a temperature-dependent process, vesicles were incubated at temperatures between 0 and 71 °C, and initial influx rates were determined over the first 120 s as described above. Arachidonate influx demonstrated a marked temperature dependence, Fig. 7. At 0 °C influx was almost completely abrogated (0.22 pmol/min × mg), and an optimum transport rate was measured at 51 °C (7.2 pmol/min × mg), Fig. 7, inset. The temperature dependence of the initial influx rates (0–47 °C) was tested according to Arrhenius where ln V max is plotted against 1/Tas shown in Fig. 7, inset. A linear relationship was found (r = −0.9890), and from the slope of the Arrhenius plot an activation energy of 11.6 ± 0.3 kcal/mol (mean ± S.D., n = 3) could be calculated. Essentially no influx could be observed at 71 °C (0 pmol/min × mg) and transport competence could not be restored by lowering the temperature back to 37 °C. Inactivation of transport function might be due to denaturation of a putative carrier protein or physical damage of the vesicles. Electron micrographic pictures taken from the vesicles before and after a 10-min incubation at 70 °C showed that the vesicles were indeed heavily damaged by heat treatment. In fact, it was not possible to find any intact vesicle in representative pictures of more than 100 vesicles (data not sho"
https://openalex.org/W2069377949,"We have previously identified several positivecis-acting regulatory regions in the promoters of the bovine and human nuclear-encoded mitochondrial F0F1-ATP synthase α-subunit genes (ATPA). One of these cis-acting regions contains the sequence 5′-CACGTG-3′ (an E-box), to which a number of transcription factors containing a basic helix-loop-helix motif can bind. This E-box element is required for maximum activity of theATPA promoter in HeLa cells. The present study identifies the human transcription factor, upstream stimulatory factor 2 (USF2), as a nuclear factor that binds to the ATPA E-box and demonstrates that USF2 plays a critical role in the activation of theATPA gene in vivo. Evidence includes the following. Antiserum directed against USF2 recognized factors present in HeLa nuclear extracts that interact with the ATPApromoter in mobility shift assays. Wild-type USF2 proteins synthesized from expression vectors trans-activated theATPA promoter through the E-box, whereas truncated USF2 proteins devoid of the amino-terminal activation domains did not. Importantly, expression of a dominant-negative mutant of USF2 lacking the basic DNA binding domain but able to dimerize with endogenous USF proteins significantly reduced the level of activation of theATPA promoter caused by ectopically coexpressed USF2, demonstrating the importance of endogenous USF2 in activation of theATPA gene."
https://openalex.org/W2088650434,"Prothymosin α (ProTα) is an acidic protein involved in cell proliferation. Its phosphorylation status is correlated with proliferative activity. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a ProTα-phosphorylating kinase (ProTαK) from mouse splenocytes that seems to be responsible for the in vivo phosphorylation of ProTα and that differs from other protein kinases reported to date. This enzyme, mainly located in the cytosol, has an molecular mass of 180 kDa and appears to be made up of two proteins of 64 and 60 kDa. Its activity was markedly enhanced by mitogenic activation of cells. The ProTα residues phosphorylated by the enzyme in vitro are a Thr at position 7 and another Thr at positions 12 or 13, both located within casein kinase 2 (CK-2) consensus motifs; these are the same residues as are phosphorylatedin vivo. The new enzyme shows a number of clear structural and catalytic differences from CK-2. It phosphorylates histones H2B and H3, although with weaker activity than ProTα. An enzyme with the same characteristics was also found in other murine tissues and cell lines. Prothymosin α (ProTα) is an acidic protein involved in cell proliferation. Its phosphorylation status is correlated with proliferative activity. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a ProTα-phosphorylating kinase (ProTαK) from mouse splenocytes that seems to be responsible for the in vivo phosphorylation of ProTα and that differs from other protein kinases reported to date.

This is in agreement with the efficiency of antisense oligonucleotides complementary to ProTα mRNA for paralyzing cell growth (15Sburlati A.R. Manrow R.E. Berger S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the proposed implication of the c-Myc protein in the transcriptional regulation of the ProTα gene (16Eilers M. Schirm S. Bishop J.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 17Mori M. Barnard G.F. Staniunas R.J. Jessup J.M. Steel Jr., G.D. Chen L.B.

Lee L. Dang C. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 6949-7009Crossref Google Scholar), would support this hypothesis. Although the precise function of ProTα remains unclear (for review, see Ref. 20Smith M.R. Leuk. & Lymphoma. 1995; 18: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), there is strong evidence to suggest a nuclear role: its C terminus region bears a karyophilic signal (21Gómez-Márquez J. Segade F. FEBS Lett. 1988; 226: 217-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and ProTα migrates to the nucleus in proliferating cells (22Manrow R.E. Sburlati A.R. Hanover J.A. Berger S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3916-3924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Clinton M. Graeve L. El-Dorry H. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Horecker B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6608-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Recent work in our laboratory has shown that ProTα binds histones and cooperates in nucleosome assembly in vitro (24Diaz-Jullien C. Pérez A. Covelo G. Freire M. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1296: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), suggesting that the putative nuclear function may be related to chromatin remodeling; this possibility is consistent with the structural similarities between ProTα and various nuclear proteins known to be involved in chromatin activity (25Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1479-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 26Philpott A. Leno G.H. Cell. 1992; 69: 759-767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of ProTα has recently been reported by us (27Barcia M.G. Castro J.M. Jullien C.D. Freire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4704-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and corroborated by other authors (28Sburlati A.R. De La Rosa A. Batey D.W. Kurys G.L. Manrow R.E. Pannell L.K. Martin B.M. Sheeley D.M. Berger S.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4587-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This post-translational modification constitutes an additional clue to its biological role. The available data indicate that the extent of phosphorylation of ProTα is positively correlated with cell proliferation activity (27Barcia M.G. Castro J.M. Jullien C.D. Freire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4704-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Sburlati A.R. De La Rosa A. Batey D.W. Kurys G.L. Manrow R.E. Pannell L.K. Martin B.M. Sheeley D.M. Berger S.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4587-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation sites are included in the first 14 amino acids of the sequence: however, there is controversy as to whether the residues which undergo phosphorylation are Thr residues (our findings; Ref. 27Barcia M.G. Castro J.M. Jullien C.D. Freire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4704-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or Ser residues (Sburlati et al. (28Sburlati A.R. De La Rosa A. Batey D.W. Kurys G.L. Manrow R.E. Pannell L.K. Martin B.M. Sheeley D.M. Berger S.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4587-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar)). Regardless of whether the residues phosphorylated are Thr or Ser, the N-terminal sequence of ProTα (AcSer-Asp-Ala-Ala-Val-Asp-Thr-Ser-Ser-Glu-Ile-Thr-Thr-Lys) suggests that the in vivo phosphorylation sites are casein kinase 2 (CK-2) consensus sites (29Pinna L.A. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1054: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). This is in accordance with our previous results which show that CK-2 is able to phosphorylate the 14-residue N-terminal fragment of ProTα in vitro (30Barcia M.G. Castro J.M. Jullien C.D. González C.G. Freire M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, phosphoamino acid analysis showed that in vitrophosphorylation with CK-2 leads to phosphorylation of both Thr and Ser residues, in approximately equal proportion. In the work reported here, we aimed to characterize the enzyme responsible for the phosphorylation of ProTα in proliferating cells. At the same time, we set out to resolve the controversy as to which amino acid residues undergo phosphorylation. Fractionation of cell extracts by affinity chromatography on a ProTα-Sepharose column and then by ion-exchange HPLC yielded a protein kinase, different from CK-2, which phosphorylated the N-terminal 14-mer of ProTα. Analysis of the sites phosphorylated both in vivo and by the purified enzyme in vitro confirmed that the residues phosphorylated in the N-terminal peptide of ProTα are Thr residues, and indicate that the purified enzyme is probably responsible for the phosphorylation of ProTα observed in vivo. The triethylammonium salts of adenosine 5′-[γ-32P]triphosphate ([γ-32P]ATP, 3000 Ci/mmol) and guanosine 5′-[γ-32P]triphosphate ([γ-32P]GTP, 5000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham International. [32P]Orthophosphate (1 Ci/mmol) was from DuPont NEN. TPCK-treated trypsin, alkaline phosphatase from bovine intestinal mucosa, poly-l-lysine hydrobromide, dephosphorylated β-casein from bovine milk, protamine (grade IV) from salmon, and concanavalin A were from Sigma. Thin-layer cellulose plates (0.1 mm) were from Merck. Interleukin-2, DNase I, RNase I, histones, the artificial casein kinase II substrate RRRDDDSDDD and protease V8 (sequencing grade) from Staphylococus aureus were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Antibodies to human casein kinase II were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. and casein kinase II from Promega. ProTα was purified from calf thymocytes as described (10Franco F.J. Diaz C. Barcia M. Freire M. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1120: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). All other reagents and materials were of analytical grade. Splenocytes, thymocytes, and hepatocytes were obtained from 45-day-old female BALB/c mice. Cells were isolated by pressing a suspension of the freshly excised and minced tissue in RPMI 1640 medium through a 65-μm mesh stainless steel screen. In all cases the resulting suspension was treated with erythrocyte lysis buffer (0.75% NH4Cl, 0.21% Tris-HCl, pH 7.2) and washed twice in RPMI 1640 before use. Splenocytes and thymocytes (5 × 106 cells/ml) were grown for various times in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units ml−1 of penicillin, and 100 μg ml−1 of streptomycin, in the presence or absence of concanavalin A (2.5 μg ml−1) and interleukin-2 (10 units ml−1), in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. HeLa and NC37 cells were grown in minimum Eagle's medium or RPMI 1640, respectively, at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 atmosphere. In both cases the medium contained 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units ml−1 of penicillin, and 100 μg ml−1 of streptomycin. Subcellular fractionation of the different cell types was as follows. Cells were collected from culture, washed twice, suspended (about 5 × 107 cells/ml) in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mmEDTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin), incubated on ice for 10 min, homogenized (10 strokes) in a Potter Teflon glass blender, then centrifuged (2000 ×g for 10 min) to yield pellet I (nuclei). The supernatant was ultracentrifuged (110,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C) to yield pellet II (microsomes) and a supernatant which was dialyzed against buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) to yield the cytosol fraction. Pellet II was suspended in buffer A containing 0.5m NaCl and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, incubated at 0 °C for 10 min, and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min: the supernatant was then dialyzed against buffer A to yield the microsomal fraction. Nuclei were suspended (about 2 × 108 nuclei/ml) in buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with 80 μg/ml DNase I and 10 μg/ml RNase I, incubated at 0 °C for 1 h, and then centrifuged at 20,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was dialyzed against buffer A to yield the nucleoplasm fraction. The pellet was suspended in buffer B containing 0.5 m NaCl, incubated for 5 min at 0 °C, and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min; the supernatant was then dialyzed against buffer A to yield the nuclear envelope fraction. All fractions were either used immediately or stored at −70 °C until use. The various subcellular fractions were chromatographed on ProTα-Sepharose columns as described previously (24Diaz-Jullien C. Pérez A. Covelo G. Freire M. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1296: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, the fraction under study, in buffer A, was first passed through a bovine serum albumin-Sepharose column (1 mg of bovine serum albumin/ml of Sepharose) at a ratio of about 10 mg of protein per ml of bovine serum albumin-Sepharose matrix. The flow-through fractions were then slowly loaded onto a 1-ml column of ProTα-Sepharose (0.8 mg of ProTα per ml of Sepharose). The column was then sequentially eluted with 0.3m NaCl and with 1 m NaCl in buffer A. The flow-through fraction and the two eluate fractions were dialyzed against buffer A and concentrated to final volumes of 0.5 ml. ProTα kinase activities of the different concentrates were then assayed as described below. All operations were carried out at 4 °C. To further purify components in the affinity chromatography fractions with ProTα kinase activity, these fractions were loaded onto a Spherogel-TSK DEAE-SPW column (7.5 × 75 mm) previously equilibrated with buffer A, in a Beckman Gold HPLC system. The column was developed for 10 min with buffer A and then eluted with 0–0.8m NaCl (linear gradient) in the same buffer. Flow rate was 0.5 ml/min and fractions were collected every minute. ProTα kinase activity was assayed in aliquots of each fraction as described below. Fractions with the highest ProTα kinase activity were collected and concentrated at final volumes of 0.5 ml in a Centricon 10 and stored at 4 °C or −70 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211232) Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled ProTα was obtained from proliferating cells following modification of the procedure of Haritos et al. (32Haritos A.A. Goodall G.J. Horecker B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1008-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), as we have described previously (27Barcia M.G. Castro J.M. Jullien C.D. Freire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4704-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, splenic lymphocytes activated with concanavalin A and interleukin-2 were incubated with [32P]orthophosphate (50 μCi/ml), then frozen in liquid nitrogen, powdered, and suspended in boiling 0.15 m NaCl. After cooling, the suspension was centrifuged and the supernatant brought to pH 2.5, clarified by centrifugation, made up to 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) and 70 mm NaCl, and applied to a DEAE-cellulose column, which was eluted with 3 volumes of loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8) containing 0.2 mNaCl, followed by 6 volumes containing 0.5 m NaCl. The components eluted with the latter buffer were purified by reverse-phase HPLC. Phosphorylated ProTα, which co-purified with calf ProTα, was characterized by SDS-PAGE and isoelectric focusing, and on the basis of immunoreactivity with an antibody raised against the first 28 amino acids of ProTα (27Barcia M.G. Castro J.M. Jullien C.D. Freire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4704-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This procedure has previously been shown by us (10Franco F.J. Diaz C. Barcia M. Freire M. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1120: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and by others (5Frillingos S. Frangou-Lazaridis M. Seferiadis K. Humes J.D. Pan Y-C.E. Tsolas O. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 108: 3853-3862Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 9Clinton M. Frangou-Lazaridis M. Panneerselvam C. Horecker B.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 269: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) to yield 43–130 μg of ProTα/g of cell, depending on tissue. In the present study, the yields of radioactive ProTα after HPLC purification were about 4 × 105cpm/108 mitogen-activated splenic lymphocytes. Peptide mapping on the basis of tryptic digestion of 32P-labeled phosphorylated ProTα, and phosphoamino acid analysis of the ProTα fragments were as described (27Barcia M.G. Castro J.M. Jullien C.D. Freire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4704-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 32P-ProTα, either purified from metabolically labeled cells or from kinase-assay reaction mixtures, was digested with TPCK-trypsin for 10 h at 37 °C. Tryptic peptides were then separated by reverse-phase HPLC. Aliquots of the radioactive peak coeluting with the 14-residue N-terminal fragment of calf ProTα were then subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis, by hydrolysis with 6 n HCl, mixing with nonradioactive phosphoamino acid standards, thin-layer electrophoresis, and autoradiography. Alternatively, aliquots of the radioactive peak (of the HPLC-separated tryptic digests, whether from metabolically labeled cells or from kinase-assay reaction mixtures) were further digested with endopeptidase V8 (Boehringer Manheim) (protease:peptide ratio 1:10) in 25 mm ammonium carbonate (pH 7.8). The resulting peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC in an Ultrasphere-ODS column (5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm), and phosphoamino acid analysis was performed as above. The amino acid compositions of the peptides derived from V8 digestion of the N-terminal fragment were determined after acid hydrolysis in a Biochrom 20 analyzer (Pharmacia). Assays of the ProTα phosphorylating activity of cell extracts or rat liver CK-2 were performed in 25-μl reaction mixtures containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm KCl, 26 mmMgCl2, 1.6 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 3.3 mm dithiothreitol, 80 ng/ml protamine, 83 mmβ-glycerol phosphate, and 100 μm[32P]ATP. Dephosphorylated calf thymus ProTα (5 μg), or that indicated under “Results,” was used as substrate. After 30 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped with 5 μl of 100 mm ATP. Activity was quantified (a) by separating the components of the reaction mixture by SDS-PAGE (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205307) Google Scholar), with autoradiography to estimate 32P-ProTα concentration and kinase activity subsequently expressed in arbitrary units, or (b) by separating the components by reverse-phase HPLC (as described above), then quantifying the radioactivity co-eluting with ProTα, with activity expressed as amount of 32P incorporated into the substrate. Assays of immunoreactivity with antibodies raised against the first 28 amino acids of ProTα (see above) were also used to characterize 32P-ProTα in the various reaction mixtures. Immunodepletion assays were carried out in 50-μl aliquots of reaction mixture buffer, without ATP, containing 30 μl of the purified kinase and different concentrations of antibody to the α subunit of CK-2. The mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking. Forty μl of Sepharose-bound protein A in reaction mixture buffer was then added, and the mixture gently shaken for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were collected by centrifugation and kinase activity was assayed in the supernatant after adding 100 μm[32P]ATP. Phosphorylation of ProTα is particularly marked in mitogen-activated splenic lymphocytes, as compared with non-activated lymphocytes and other proliferating cell types (27Barcia M.G. Castro J.M. Jullien C.D. Freire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4704-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Sburlati A.R. De La Rosa A. Batey D.W. Kurys G.L. Manrow R.E. Pannell L.K. Martin B.M. Sheeley D.M. Berger S.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4587-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We thus searched for the ProTα kinase (ProTαK) in extracts of these cells. The first step was to isolate cellular components which show affinity for ProTα by using a ProTα-Sepharose column that we have previously shown to be effective for this purpose (24Diaz-Jullien C. Pérez A. Covelo G. Freire M. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1296: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). ProTα phosphorylation activity in the various affinity chromatography fractions was assayed under conditions equivalent to those used for assaying CK-2 activity, since the in vivo phosphorylation sites of ProTα are similar to those of this enzyme (27Barcia M.G. Castro J.M. Jullien C.D. Freire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4704-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Sburlati A.R. De La Rosa A. Batey D.W. Kurys G.L. Manrow R.E. Pannell L.K. Martin B.M. Sheeley D.M. Berger S.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4587-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Subcellular fractions (cytosol, nucleoplasm, microsome, and nuclear envelope) from mitogen-activated splenic lymphocytes were chromatographed on ProTα-Sepharose columns and ProTα phosphorylation activity was assayed in the different eluates. As shown in Fig. 1, components with high affinity for ProTα-Sepharose (lanes 4) in the cytosol (Fig. 1 A), nuclear envelope (Fig.1 B), and nucleoplasm (Fig. 1 C) fractions all showed ProTα phosphorylation activity, as judged by the radioactivity migrating with ProTα in the SDS-PAGE analysis, whereas no such activity was observed when ProTα was omitted from the reaction mixtures (Fig. 1, lanes 3). Components obtained from the microsome fraction showed no detectable ProTα phosphorylation activity (data not shown). Affinity chromatography appears to be efficient for isolating the ProTα phosphorylating activity, since no phosphorylated product migrating with ProTα was detected in the flow-through fractions (Fig. 1, lane 1), and since the phosphorylated product was absent (Fig. 1, B and C, lanes 2) or present in only low concentration (Fig. 1 A, lane 2) in the moderate-affinity fractions. ProTα phosphorylation activity was imperceptible in the various crude subcellular fractions (not shown). Similar results were obtained when an HPLC-based assay (see “Methods”; results not shown) was used for determination of ProTα phosphorylation activity in the different fractions. That the radioactive peaks co-eluting with calf ProTα in HPLC were indeed radiolabeled ProTα was confirmed by immunoprecipitation with the anti-28-mer antibody (see “Methods”; results not shown). Densitometric scanning of the gels shown in Fig. 1 indicates that ProTα phosphorylation activity is highest in the high-affinity fraction (HAF, lane 4) of the cytosol extract. Activities in the HAFs of the nuclear envelope and nucleoplasm extracts were about 25 and 5.9%, respectively, of that in the HAF of the cytosol extract. Activity in the moderate-affinity fraction of the cytosol extract was about 4.8% of that in the HAF of the cytosol extract. Total protein concentrations were 15, 9, and 4 μg/108 cells in the HAFs of cytosol, nucleoplasm, and nuclear envelope extracts, respectively. ProTα phosphorylation activity in the HAF of the cytosol extract from non-activated splenic lymphocytes was about 14% of that in the HAF of the cytosol extract from mitogen-activated splenic lymphocytes (Fig.2). As is also shown in Fig. 2, activity in the HAF of the nuclear envelope extract from non-activated cells was about 35% of that in this fraction from activated cells, whereas activity in the HAF of the nucleoplasm extract from non-activated cells was scarcely detectable. Taken together, these results indicate that the ProTαK activity in splenic lymphocytes is influenced by proliferation status and is largely contained in the cytosol. Some activity is contained in nuclear envelopes, while activity in the nucleoplasm is negligible. To characterize this activity, we further purified components of the cytosol, nuclear envelope, and nucleoplasm extracts of activated splenic lymphocytes with affinity for ProTα-Sepharose by ion-exchange HPLC. ProTα phosphorylation activity in the HAFs of the cytosol and nuclear envelope fractions showed different elution patterns, but was in both cases concentrated in single clearly defined peaks (Fig.3 A). Kinase activity eluting at the same position as that in the HAFs from cytosol was scarcely detectable either in the eluate fractions obtained by ion-exchange HPLC of the HAFs of the nucleoplasm fraction or in eluate fractions obtained by ion-exchange HPLC of moderate-affinity fractions (see Fig. 1 A, lane 2) from cytosol (result not shown). The specific activity of the HPLC-purified ProTαK from cytosol extract was about 300-fold higher than in the extract prior to HPLC. No such assessment of the effectiveness of the second purification step is possible for the nuclear envelope extract, since protein content in the peak-activity HPLC fraction was below detection limits. Gel filtration (Fig.3 B) indicated that the HPLC-purified kinase from the cytosol extract has a molecular mass of about 180 kDa, while the molecular mass of the kinase from the nuclear envelope extract was about 130 kDa. To investigate whether the purified kinases are responsible for the phosphorylation of ProTα observed in vivo, we performed experiments aimed at more detailed characterization. In various animal cells ProTα has been shown to be phosphorylated in its 14-residue N-terminal region. However, controversy remains as to whether the residues phosphorylated are Thr, as we have found (27Barcia M.G. Castro J.M. Jullien C.D. Freire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4704-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or Ser, as proposed by Sburlatiet al. (28Sburlati A.R. De La Rosa A. Batey D.W. Kurys G.L. Manrow R.E. Pannell L.K. Martin B.M. Sheeley D.M. Berger S.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4587-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We thus set out to identify sites phosphorylated in vivo and sites phosphorylated in vitro by the kinases purified from cytosol and nuclear envelopes. To this end, 32P-ProTα purified by reverse-phase HPLC (see “Methods”) from metabolically labeled mouse splenocytes, or from kinase activity assay reaction mixtures, was trypsin-digested, and the resulting peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC. The elution pattern of the peptides derived from the tryptic digestion of32P-ProTα phosphorylated in vitro by the cytosol-fraction ProTαK is shown in Fig.4 A. The observed pattern is identical to those obtained with ProTα phosphorylated in vitro by the nuclear envelope fraction ProTαK or with ProTα phosphorylatedin vivo (results not shown). As can be seen from Fig.4 A, all the radioactivity co-eluted with the 14-residue N-terminal fragment of ProTα. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the radioactive tryptic peptides derived from ProTα phosphorylatedin vivo or in vitro by the purified enzymes are shown in Fig. 4 B. This result indicates that only Thr residues were phosphorylated by the cytosolic enzyme and in the ProTα phosphorylated in vivo, whereas both Ser and Thr residues, in similar proportion, were phosphorylated by the kinase from nuclear envelopes. This result confirms our previous findings as regards the phosphorylation of ProTα in vivo (27Barcia M.G. Castro J.M. Jullien C.D. Freire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4704-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and at the same time indicates that the cytosolic ProTαK, which phosphorylates only Thr residues, is probably that responsible for the phosphorylation observed in vivo. To investigate this hypothesis, we next performed a structural study of the radioactive tryptic fragments of ProTα phosphorylated in vivo and in vitro which co-purified with the N-terminal fragment. The sequence of the first 14 amino acid residues of ProTα ("

We demonstrate that the interaction of the factor with its target RNA sequence, the hairpin structure located at the 3′ end of mature histone mRNA, is sequence-specific and highly salt-resistant. We have developed a simple in vitro system which allows detection of activities stimulating histone pre-mRNA 3′ end processing, based on mouse cell nuclear extract fractionated by Mono Q column chromatography. Using this system, we show that the bovine hairpin-binding factor participates in histone pre-mRNA 3′ end processing in vitro. We have further purified the hairpin-binding factor in form of a RNA·protein complex by RNA-mediated elution from phosphocellulose. This led to a fraction highly enriched for 2 proteins of 40 and 43 kDa.

In higher eukaryotes, replication-dependent histone genes are expressed during S phase, in parallel to DNA synthesis (for review, see Refs. 1Schümperli D. Trends Genet. 1988; 4: 187-191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar and 2Osley M.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 827-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). This is essential for the conservation of chromatin structure during the cell cycle. Regulation of gene expression occurs at transcriptional and post-transcriptional level and, at the post-transcriptional level, involves pre-mRNA 3′ end processing and histone mRNA stability (3Harris M.E.

Unlike the majority of mRNAs, these histone mRNAs do not end in a poly(A) tail, but terminate a few nucleotides after a hairpin structure that is highly conserved between animal histone genes (1Schümperli D.

This 3′ end is formed by a cell cycle-regulated endonucleolytic cleavage between the hairpin structure and a purine-rich spacer element 3′ of the cleavage site (4Gick O. Krämer A. Keller W.

These cis-acting sequences required for the cleavage reaction are well defined and three trans-acting factors have been identified, the U7 snRNP 1The abbreviations used are: snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein; HBF, hairpin-binding factor; DTT, dithiothreitol; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility-shift assay; SLBP, stem-loop-binding protein; HBP, human hairpin-binding protein. 1The abbreviations used are: snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein; HBF, hairpin-binding factor; DTT, dithiothreitol; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility-shift assay; SLBP, stem-loop-binding protein; HBP, human hairpin-binding protein.

However, of these factors only the U7 snRNP, which interacts with the spacer element (9Mowry K.L. Oh R. Steitz J.A. Mol. Cell.

The U7 snRNA sequence from several organisms has been determined (11Soldati D. Schümperli D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1518-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Strub K. Galli G.

Science. 1987; 238: 1682-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and the protein composition of the U7 snRNP was analyzed (15Smith H.O. Tabiti K. Schaffner G. Soldati D. Albrecht U.

To better understand the mechanism and the regulation of the processing reaction, we intend to purify and characterize the other trans-acting factors involved in this reaction, with the ultimate goal to establish an in vitro processing system composed of purified components. Here, we describe the characterization and purification of the bovine HBF involved in histone RNA processing. Evidence for the role of this factor in histone gene expression is mostly indirect and was obtained by introducing mutations in the RNA hairpin, which were designed to change the RNA sequence but not the RNA structure. These mutations reduced RNA processing, nuclear export, and cytoplasmic regulation (16Pandey N.B. Williams A.S. Sun J.-H. Brown V.D. Bond U. Marzluff W.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1709-1720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Williams A.S. Ingledue III, T.C. Kay B.K. Marzluff W.F.

The binding of the HBF to mutant RNA hairpin structures paralleled the effect of these mutations on gene expression (16Pandey N.B. Williams A.S. Sun J.-H. Brown V.D. Bond U. Marzluff W.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1709-1720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Williams A.S. Ingledue III, T.C. Kay B.K. Marzluff W.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4660-4666Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), suggesting a direct involvement of the HBF in all of these steps. Factors binding to the hairpin are present in nuclear as well as in cytoplasmic fractions of mouse cell extracts (19Pandey N.B. Sun J. Marzluff W.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5653-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 20Eckner R. Birnstiel M.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and the cytoplasmic fraction is able to participate in in vitrohistone RNA processing, indicating that the nuclear and cytoplasmic factors are related (21Dominski Z. Sumerel J. Hanson R. Marzluff W. RNA (N.Y.). 1996; 1: 915-923Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic factor has been partially purified (22Hanson R.J. Sun J.H. Willis D.G. Marzluff W.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2146-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and, using NorthWestern blotting, a 45-kDa protein has been identified as the RNA-binding protein. In this manuscript, we describe the enrichment of the HBF from calf thymus extract by phosphocellulose, Affi-Gel blue, hydroxyapatite, and Mono Q column chromatography. Using a new in vitrocomplementation assay for components of the histone pre-mRNA processing machinery, we demonstrate that this enriched fraction is able to participate in histone pre-mRNA processing. We have further purified the HBF from the enriched fraction by RNA-mediated elution from a phosphocellulose column to a fraction enriched for two main proteins of 40 and 43 kDa. Buffer A contained, if not otherwise indicated, 20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 μm pepstatin A, 2 μm leupeptin, and 0.1 mm benzamidine. Buffer B was 20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 μm pepstatin A, 2 μm leupeptin, and 0.1 mm benzamidine. Buffer C was 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm PMSF. Substrate RNAs with wild-type histone stem loop sequence derived from the mouse histone H4-12 gene (23Meier V.S. Böhni R. Schümperli D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 795Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (wtHP; 5′-GGAGCUCAACAAAAGGCCCUUUUCAGGGCCACCC), mutant stem-loop sequence (mutHP; 5′-GGAGCUCAACAAAACCGGAAAGCCUUCCGGACCC), and mutant stem sequence (cgHP; 5′-GGACAAAACCCCCUUUUCAGGGGGACCC) were prepared in vitro by T7 RNA polymerase-mediated transcription and purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Templates for transcription were either plasmids derived from pSP65 linearized withSmaI (24Schaller, A. (1995) Characterization and Partial Purification of the Hairpin-binding Factor Involved in Histone Gene Expression.Diploma thesis, University Bern.Google Scholar) or partially double-stranded oligonucleotides (25Milligan J.F. Groebe D.R. Whitherell G.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8783-8794Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar). The template for the histone H4wt pre-mRNA 3′ fragment, a gift from M. L. Birnstiel (7Vasserot A.P. Schaufele F.J. Birnstiel M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4345-4349Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), was linearized with PstI and transcribed with SP6 RNA polymerase. Uniformly labeled RNA was made by including either [α-32P]UTP or [α-32P]GTP into the transcription reaction. RNA concentrations were determined either by absorption at 260 nm (assuming 1 OD = 40 μg/ml RNA) or by determination of the amount of [α-32P]UTP or [α-32P]GTP incorporated into the 32P-labeled RNA. Unless indicated otherwise, all manipulations were performed on ice or at 4–6 °C. Fractions were frozen in liquid nitrogen, stored at −80 °C, and thawed quickly by incubation in H2O at room temperature. For the purification summarized in Table I, 2 × 150 g of frozen calf thymus (Schlachthof, Bern) were partially thawed by incubation in 300 ml of buffer A containing 5 mm EDTA and 1 mm DTT each and homogenized separately in a Waring blender for 3 × 15 s and then centrifuged for 1 h at 9500 × g. The supernatants (600 ml) (fraction I) was first filtered through a cheesecloth and then directly applied to a 150-ml P11 phosphocellulose column (Whatmann) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 2 column volumes of buffer A and eluted with an 800-ml gradient from 100 to 1000 mm KCl in buffer A. The activity eluted between 200 and 400 mm KCl (fraction II). The pooled fractions were applied directly onto a 50-ml Affi-Gel blue column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with buffer A containing 300 mm KCl. The column was washed with 2 column volumes of buffer A supplemented with 300 mm KCl and eluted with a 400-ml gradient from 300 to 1000 mm KCl in buffer A. The activity eluted in a broad peak between 750 and 1000 mm KCl (fraction III). The pooled fractions were adjusted to 3 mmCaCl2 and directly applied to a 25-ml hydroxyapatite column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with buffer B. The column was washed with 2 volumes of buffer B and eluted with a 160-ml gradient from 0 to 400 mm potassium phosphate in buffer B. The activity eluted between 50 and 210 mm potassium phosphate (fraction IV). The active fractions were pooled, dialyzed against buffer A, and applied onto a 1-ml Mono Q column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The column was washed with 2 volumes of buffer A and eluted with a 12-ml gradient from 100 to 500 mm KCl in buffer A. The activity eluted as a broad peak between 180 and 320 mm KCl (fraction V). The pooled fractions were dialyzed against buffer A and applied onto a 5-ml phosphocellulose column in buffer A. The column was washed with 12.5 ml of buffer A collected in ∼1.5-ml fractions. Proteins were eluted with 1 nmol of weakly radiolabeled wtHP RNA (5 × 105dpm/nmol), applied in 300 μl of buffer A, and collected in 300-μl fractions (fraction VI). During the purification procedure, RNA·protein complexes with faster mobility were observed by mobility-shift assay. Fractions containing disproportionate amounts (>30%) of this activity were discarded. The amounts of HBF present in fractions I–V were determined using either 2.5, 5, or 10 μl of each fraction in a 20-μl binding reaction, and the products were analyzed as described under “Materials and Methods.” The amount of HBF present in fraction VI was calculated from the fraction of 32P wtHP RNA eluted from phosphocellulose as HBF · RNA complexes. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (207893) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a reference. To determine the amount of HBF present in the different fractions, binding reactions were performed with 2.5 nm wtHP RNA as described below and different amount of proteins and the amount of RNA bound per mg of protein was calculated. For the affinity elution, the amount of HBF was assumed to correspond to the amount of RNA complexed, as detected by mobility-shift assay. For electrophoresis on a SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel, the fractions were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (15%). Proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue followed by silver staining. Protein markers were from Bio-Rad. A Superdex 75 gel filtration column (Pharmacia) was equilibrated with 300 mm KCl in buffer A. 50 μl of fraction V were applied onto the column, and 50-μl fractions were collected and assayed for the presence of HBF. The relative amount of HBF in the various fractions was determined by calculating the ratio of HBF·RNA complexes divided by the amount of free RNA. Marker proteins (Pharmacia) phosphorylase b (94 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (30 kDa), trypsin inhibitor (20.1 kDa), and α-lactalbumin (14.4 kDa) were run in parallel, detected by UV absorption at 280 nm, and identified by SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Unless indicated otherwise, 2.5 nm32P-labeled RNA were incubated with protein (usually 50% of reaction volume) in the presence of 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mg/ml yeast tRNA in 10–20 μl for 20 min on ice. Subsequently, the reaction products were analyzed directly by electrophoretic mobility-shift assay (EMSA). 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was done at 4–6 °C with 10 V/cm, using 50 mm Tris, 50 mm glycine as buffer system. Reaction products were visualized by autoradiography or analyzed by a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Alternatively, RNA and proteins were cross-linked by UV light and the photoadducts analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Uniformly labeled RNA prepared with [α-32P]UTP and, if indicated, mixed with competitor RNA, were incubated with proteins as above and, after 20 min on ice, irradiated with 840–960 mJ of 260-nm UV light in a UV Stratalinker (Stratagene) and analyzed by SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The photoadducts were detected by autoradiography or using a PhosphorImager. Prestained protein standards were from Bio-Rad. Mouse K21 cell nuclear extract was prepared as described, except that 1 mm PMSF was included in the hypotonic buffer (27Dignam J.D. Llebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9104) Google Scholar). 5 ml of extract (40 mg of protein) was applied onto a 1-ml Mono Q column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with buffer C. The column was washed with 2 column volumes of buffer C and eluted with a 12-ml 100–500 mm KCl gradient in buffer C. HBF and U7 snRNP eluted in two overlapping, but separate, peaks. HBF eluted in fractions 18–24, at 200–340 mm KCl, and the peak was in fractions 19–22, between 220 and 300 mm KCl. U7 snRNP started to elute in fraction 22, at 300 mm KCl, and most eluted between 320 and 340 mm KCl in fractions 23 and 24. All fractions were tested for histone pre-mRNA 3′ end processing, and the peak of processing activity was in fractions 22 and 23, indicating that a factor other then U7 snRNP is limiting in fraction 24. Therefore, fraction 24 was used to test for stimulation of processing by HBF. Processing reactions were essentially as described (28Spycher C. Streit A. Stefanovic B. Albrecht D. Koning T.H.W. Schümperli D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4023-4030Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and contained 20 mm EDTA, 0.3 mg/ml tRNA, 1 unit/μl RNasin (Promega), 2.5 nm histone H4wt pre-mRNA 3′ end fragment labeled with [α-32P]GTP, the indicated amounts of the different fractions and, where necessary, buffer A, 200 mm KCl up to 50% of the reaction volume, in 10 μl. The reaction products were analyzed by 7 m urea, 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Visualization and quantitation of results was as described above. Processing efficiency (percentage of RNA processed) was calculated from the fraction of RNA present as 5′ cleavage product, taking into account the proportion of radiolabeled nucleotide in this fragment. To better understand the mechanism of histone pre-mRNA 3′ end processing, we have initially characterized the interaction of the hairpin structure at the mRNA 3′ end with HBF using mouse cell nuclear extract as the HBF source. This interaction was not sensitive to mild heat treatment and not dependent on the presence of a functional U7 snRNP, but was sensitive to proteinase K (data not shown), confirming earlier results (7Vasserot A.P. Schaufele F.J. Birnstiel M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4345-4349Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we attempted to purify the HBF from mouse cell nuclear extract. Unfortunately, the amount of factor in nuclear extracts, estimated by EMSA using RNA containing a histone hairpin sequence as substrate (see below), was low (∼8000 molecules/nucleus). However, we detected HBF in calf thymus, a more abundant source of material, and enriched HBF from calf thymus whole cell extract using phosphocellulose, Affi-Gel blue, hydroxyapatite, Mono Q column chromatography, followed by RNA-mediated elution from phosphocellulose (Table I). To detect the HBF during the fractionation, and also to determine its enrichment, we used the mobility-shift of radiolabeled wtHP RNA, a 34-nucleotide RNA fragment containing the hairpin sequence of a mouse histone H4 gene (illustrated in Fig. 1 A), as an assay. The first four purification steps leading to fraction V enriched HBF ∼115-fold. However, in the crude extract and in fraction II, nonspecific complexes were formed (data not shown); therefore, the HBF content determined for these fractions, as well as the enrichment calculated for these and the subsequent fractions, are the lowest estimates. Fraction VI, the product of the last purification step (described in the legend to Fig. 5), contained HBF in form of a RNP complex, consisting of proteins and wtHP RNA. The HBF-hairpin RNA interaction is very stable (see Table II), and fraction VI could therefore not be used for characterization of the calf thymus HBF. Instead, we used fraction V and tested first whether HBF bound to RNA in a sequence-specific manner.Figure 5RNA-mediated elution of the HBF from phosphocellulose. 0.6 ml of fraction V (0.5 mg/ml) was applied to a 2-ml phosphocellulose column. The column was first washed with 15 ml of buffer A, 100 mm KCl, and HBF was then eluted with buffer A, 100 mm KCl supplemented with 17 pmol of wtHP RNA32P-labeled with high specific activity (1.5 × 106 dpm/pmol) as described under “Materials and Methods.” A, lanes 1–11, 15-μl aliquots of fraction V (lane 1) and of the wash fractions (lanes 2–11) were mixed with 32P-labeled wtHP RNA in 30 μl and the products analyzed by EMSA as described under “Materials and Methods.” Lane 12, 32P-labeled wtHP RNA incubated in the absence of protein. Lanes 13–21, 60 μl of fractions 11–19 prepared by 32P-labeled wtHP RNA-mediated elution from phosphocellulose were analyzed directly by EMSA. B, lanes 1–4, 50 μl of phosphocellulose fractions 11–14 (lanes 13–16 in A) were cross-linked with UV light, analyzed by 10% SDS, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and cross-links visualized by autoradiography. The major UV cross-links are indicated by a bracket. C, 3 ml of fraction V (0.3 mg/ml, preparation described in Table I) were applied to a 5-ml phosphocellulose column as described under “Materials and Methods.” The column was washed, and HBF was eluted with 1 nmol of weakly32P-labeled wtHP RNA as described under “Materials and Methods.” Lane 1, fractions containing HBF were pooled and precipitated with 15% trichloroacetic acid as described under “Materials and Methods.” Lane 2, 40 μl of fraction V precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. Lane 3, molecular mass standard: phosphorylase b (97.4 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66.2 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (31 kDa), and trypsin inhibitor (21.5 kDa).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table IIEffect of KCl concentration, MgCl2, and ATP on HBF · RNA complex formationReaction conditionComplexes%100 mm KCl25.2400 mm KCl45550 mm KCl47.4700 mm KCl48.9850 mm KCl43.11000 mm KCl46.35 mm MgCl248.15 mmMgCl2, 1 mm ATP48HBF · RNA complex formation was determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” Open table in a new tab HBF · RNA complex formation was determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” To test for sequence-specific binding, we prepared the two mutant RNA molecules mutHP RNA and cgHP RNA shown in Fig. 1 A. In mutHP RNA, the hairpin sequence was changed in the stem and the loop, but the flanking sequences were unchanged. In vitro processing experiments have shown that this mutant hairpin structure does not interact with HBF (29Streit A. Wittop Koning T. Soldati D. Melin L. Schümperli D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1569-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In cgHP RNA, the sequence was changed to form a stem composed of five C-G base pairs and an U-A base pair, and the 5′-flanking sequence was shortened by 6 nucleotides. When we compared the binding of the HBF to the wtHP RNA with the binding to the two mutant RNAs, we found that a complex was formed only with wtHP RNA (Fig. 1 B, lanes 4–6). In addition, only wtHP competitor RNA could efficiently compete for the factor (lanes 7 and8), indicating that the binding to RNA is sequence- and structure-specific. To rule out that, using this assay, we detected La protein, a ubiquitous RNA-binding protein with a preference for U-tracts, we performed competition experiments with an artificial tRNA precursor ending in UUUUOH (30Lin-Marq N. Clarkson S.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Inclusion of a 100-fold excess of this RNA, which is bound efficiently by La protein, did not influence the binding of the HBF to wtHP RNA (data not shown), thus excluding La protein as a candidate. To estimate the molecular mass of the HBF, wtHP RNA prepared with [32P]UTP of high specific activity was incubated with fraction V, either in the presence or absence of excess wtHP or mutHP competitor RNA. Proteins and RNA were then covalently linked by irradiation with 260-nm UV light and analyzed subsequently by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fig. 1 C shows that fraction V contains two main double bands of ∼48–50 and ∼55–57 kDa (lane 1), which are sensitive to competition with wtHP, but not with mutHP RNA (lanes 3 and 2, respectively), indicating that these double bands are formed by a sequence-specific interaction, as are the HBF·RNA complexes in Fig.1 B. Incubation of these samples with RNase decreased the molecular mass of these complexes to between ∼40 and 50 kDa, giving a more accurate mass estimate for the protein component (data not shown). To determine whether HBF in fraction V is involved in histone pre-mRNA processing, we tested fraction V in a simple in vitro RNA processing system that allows us to identify components of the 3′ end processing reaction. To prepare this system, histone pre-mRNA processing proficient mouse cell nuclear extract was fractionated by Mono Q column chromatography, leading to a separation of HBF from U7 snRNP. We then tested whether the mouse HBF was part of the histone pre-mRNA processing machinery. Fig. 2shows that Mono Q fraction 20, containing the mouse HBF, did not cleave a short RNA fragment containing all the sequence elements required for histone pre-mRNA processing (lane 3) (7Vasserot A.P. Schaufele F.J. Birnstiel M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4345-4349Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), while processing using Mono Q fraction 24, containing U7 snRNP and little HBF, was very low (lane 4). However, mixing these two fractions stimulated RNA processing ∼5-fold, to about 20% of processing observed with a peak fraction (compare lanes 2and 5). When the mouse HBF-containing fraction 20 was replaced by the calf thymus fraction V, which did not process RNA by itself (lane 6), processing was stimulated ∼5-fold (lane 7), similar to the reaction in the presence of the mouse Mono Q fraction 20. This stimulation was reduced to near background level by the inclusion of wtHP competitor RNA (lane 9), but not by mutHP competitor RNA (lane 8), indicating that the HBF in fraction V is involved in histone pre-mRNA processing. To exclude the possibility that stimulation of histone pre-mRNA processing by a fraction enriched for HBF is coincidental, we tested whether HBF co-eluted with the processing-stimulating activity from hydroxyapatite and Mono Q columns. HBF eluted from the Mono Q column in fractions 6–10 (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3–7), with the main peak in fractions 7–9. In parallel, we tested these fractions for stimulation of histone pre-mRNA processing, using the assay described above. About 3-fold stimulation of processing was observed in reactions with the peak fractions 7–9 (Fig. 3 B, lanes 11, 13, and 15), ∼2-fold stimulation with fraction 6 (lane 9), and ∼1.4-fold stimulation with fraction 10 (lane 17), in parallel to the amount of HBF present in these fractions. This demonstrates that HBF and processing-stimulating activity co-elute form the Mono Q column. Co-elution of these activities was also observed in fractions from the hydroxyapatite column (in fractions 2–7, 6.3, 46.3, 67.1, 44.2, 24.1, and 11.9% wtHP RNA was bound by HBF, and stimulation of processing with these fractions was 1-, 2-, 2.2-, 1.3-, 1-, and 0.9-fold, respectively). These results confirm that HBF enriched in fraction V is involved in histone pre-mRNA processing. The polypeptides detected by UV cross-linking to wtHP RNA in fraction V (Fig. 1 C) have similar sequence requirements for hairpin RNA binding as the HBF detected by EMSA (Fig. 1 B), indicating that they are part of the HBF. To test whether these polypeptides co-elute with HBF from the Mono Q column, we mixed Mono Q fractions 4–12 with 32P-wtHP RNA and cross-linked RNA-protein interactions with UV light. The cross-links were then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and Fig. 3 C shows that the double bands of ∼48–50 and ∼55–57 kDa present in fraction V (Fig. 1 C) co-elute with processing-stimulating activity and HBF in Mono Q fractions 7–9, as expected for HBF components. Possibly, each of the two double bands observed in the cross-linking experiments represents one polypeptide, cross-linked to two RNAs which differ in length. This length difference might be caused by a weak RNase activity present in the preparation (data not shown). Alternatively, it is possible that several polypeptides bind to wtHP RNA. As mentioned above, digestion of RNA with RNase A reduced the apparent molecular mass of the main protein·RNA complexes to ∼40–50 kDa, but not the number of complexes (data not shown). This does not rule out that two peptides bind to different length RNAs, since it is possible that the RNase in the HBF preparation and RNase A have different cleavage requirements, thus leaving different RNA fragments cross-linked to the same polypeptide. To investigate further the nature of the double bands, an aliquot of fraction V was analyzed by gel filtration chromatography. Using fractionation on a Superdex 75 column, two peaks of HBF activity were detected, with apparent molecular masses of ∼53 and ∼43 kDa (Fig.4). Activities in these peaks form complexes A and B, respectively, and their mass determined by gel filtration is in reasonable agreement with the UV cross-linked double bands between 48–57 kDa observed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, suggesting that the double bands may be formed by two polypeptides interacting with different length RNAs. However, the nature of the difference between the two activities is not clear. Both behave similar in RNA competition experiments and co-sediment through glycerol gradients (data not shown). Interestingly, we have observed the activity forming complex A in all our preparations, and early fractions formed exclusively complex A. Complex B appeared during the purification of HBF from calf thymus extract as well as from HeLa and K21 cell nuclear extracts (data not shown), suggesting that HBF might be easily modified. To better characterize the conditions for HBF·wtHP complex formation, salt concentrations were varied in binding reactions with fraction V. Complex formation was stimulated by increasing the KCl concentration from 100 to 400 mm and not inhibited by the presence of up to 1 m KCl (Table II). Binding at still higher salt concentrations was observed but not quantitated, since the migration during electrophoresis was affected (data not shown). Our standard binding assay is performed in the presence of EDTA; however, inclusion of MgCl2 and ATP had no influence on complex formation (Table II). To further purify the HBF from fraction V, we exploited the high affinity of the factor for wtHP RNA and made use of the observation that the HBF, but not HBF·RNA complexes, binds to phosphocellulose at 100 mm KCl. We applied an aliquot of fraction V onto a small phosphocellulose column and washed the column with buffer containing 100 mm KCl. Fig. 5 Ashows that using a normal binding assay followed by EMSA, we did not detect HBF in the wash fractions (lanes 2–11). HBF was then eluted with wtHP RNA radiolabeled with high specific activity UTP, and analyzed directly by EMSA (lanes 13–21). The amount of HBF·RNA complexes in each fraction paralleled the amount of free radiolabeled RNA, and complexes were present mainly in fractions 12 and 13 (lanes 14 and 15). Comparison with the HBF in fraction V (lane 1), detected using a standard binding assay, showed no significant differences in appearance of the HBF. To visualize the wtHP RNA-binding proteins in the peak fractions 11–14 (Fig. 5 A, lanes 13–16), samples of these fractions were cross-linked with UV light immediately after 32P-labeled RNA-mediated elution from the phosphocellulose column and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The pattern of RNA·protein complexes in these fractions is best visible in the cross-linked fraction 12 and consists of 3–4 RNA·protein complexes between ∼48 and 57 kDa (Fig. 5B, lane 2), very similar to the cross-links with Mono Q fractions and fraction V (Figs. 1 Cand 3 C). This indicates that the proteins eluted with wtHP RNA are (components of) the HBF. The small differences revealed by closer inspection are probably caused by a weak RNase activity during RNA-mediated elution from phosphocellulose, as indicated by the appearance of shorter RNA fragments in Fig. 5 A, lanes 14–17. Fractions 12 and 13 were pooled, precipitated with 15% trichloroacetic acid, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Extensive staining with silver revealed the presence of two polypeptides of apparent molecular mass of ∼40 and ∼43 kDa in these pooled fractions (data not shown), arguing again that the double bands produced by UV cross-linking were caused by two proteins. These polypeptides are better visible in fraction VI (Fig. 5 C, lane 1) of a large-scale HBF preparation (summarized in Table I). As already mentioned above, RNase A digestion reduced the apparent molecular mass of these RNA·protein complexes from ∼48–57 to ∼40–50 kDa. Assuming a minimal HBF binding site of ∼22 nucleotides, and keeping in mind that the loop in the hairpin structure and the sequences immediately 5′ of the hairpin structure are accessible to RNase A in complexes formed with crude preparations of a mouse factor binding to histone hairpin RNA (31Williams A.S. Marzluff W.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 654-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), it is likely that RNA fragments from 5 to 22 nucleotides may remain cross-linked to HBF upon RNase A digestion. This is in good agreement with the apparent molecular mass of 40 and 43 kDa for the proteins enriched in fraction VI. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that an assay for factors involved in histone pre-mRNA processing can be used to determine whether enriched fractions, and probably also pure proteins, take part in histone pre-mRNA processing. Furthermore, we describe the purification of the HBF involved in this RNA processing reaction from calf thymus. To separate two components of the processing machinery, HBF and U7 snRNP, processing-proficient mouse cell nuclear extract was fractionated by Mono Q column chromatography. The two activities overlapped only in a few fractions, and not surprisingly, the peak of histone RNA processing activity was found to be in these fractions. For the in vitro complementation assay, a side fraction enriched for HBF was mixed with a side fraction enriched for U7 snRNP, leading to processing at ∼20% of processing with a peak activity fraction. These side fractions were chosen such as that neither U7 snRNP nor the HBF were limiting. Therefore, the low level of restoration suggests that another factor, perhaps the heat-labile activity, was limiting in this reaction. This assay system was used to confirm that the bovine HBF enriched from calf thymus whole cell extract by ion exchange chromatography is able to participate in histone pre-mRNA processing. HBF, as detected by EMSA, co-eluted with an activity stimulating histone pre-mRNA processing from hydroxyapatite and Mono Q columns, indicating that they are identical. In addition, in reactions with fraction V of the purification, which was at least 115-fold enriched for HBF, stimulation of processing was prevented by the inclusion of wtHP, but not mutHP competitor RNA. Since HBF binds specifically and with high affinity to wtHP RNA, this is further proof that HBF is involved in histone pre-mRNA 3′ end processing. This assay system will be very useful during the further characterization of HBF and in addition promises to be an essential tool to study additional factors involved in processing, such as the heat-labile activity. Attempts to further purify HBF from fraction V revealed a common problem in the purification of RNA-binding proteins, an extreme stability of RNA·protein complexes. This stability did not allow for an affinity purification step, using the dissociation of nucleic acid-protein interactions by high salt concentrations, a method commonly used for the dissociation of DNA·protein complexes. Instead, we used hairpin RNA to specifically elute the HBF from phosphocellulose at low salt. UV cross-linked RNA·protein complexes eluted from phosphocellulose had the same apparent molecular mass (48–57 kDa) as complexes formed with HBF in Mono Q fractions and fraction V, indicating that only minor changes, if at all, occurred during the last purification step. Analysis of proteins in fraction VI showed that two proteins of ∼40 and ∼43 kDa were enriched by the RNA-mediated elution. The presence of two enriched proteins agrees well with the observation that fraction V contained two hairpin RNA binding activities of apparent molecular masses of ∼43 and ∼53 kDa detected by gel filtration and that the HBF appears as double bands of ∼48–50 and ∼55–57 kDa in UV cross-linked samples. Our interpretation of these observations is that the HBF consists of two polypeptides with different molecular mass, interacting in a sequence-specific manner with histone hairpin RNA. Currently, we assume that the mass difference is due to different modifications of the same polypeptide, which might arise during cell cycle regulation, perhaps by phosphorylation, and perhaps reflect a regulatory step in the processing reaction. Alternatively, it is possible that the polypeptide itself is unstable and that truncated forms appear during the purification. However, we cannot presently exclude the possibility that the HBF consists of two different RNA-binding proteins. The protein purification procedure described here consists of four standard ion exchange chromatography steps, followed by RNA-mediated elution from phosphocellulose. This procedure reproducibly leads to the enrichment of two polypeptides of ∼40 and ∼43 kDa. However, we observed that the appearance of HBF analyzed by EMSA was variable from purification to purification. This variability was reflected in different ratios between the HBF·RNA complexes A and B in different HBF preparations. In addition, HBF·RNA complexes with lower molecular mass were sometimes observed, perhaps caused by proteolytic degradation. The activity forming these complexes was not able to bind to phosphocellulose at the last purification step and was removed. This illustrates that the last step is a useful alternative to more established purification steps exploiting the affinity to RNA, such as incubations with biotinylated RNA followed by an enrichment using streptavidin coupled to agarose or magnetic beads. This step enriches first by removing proteins not binding to phosphocellulose and then by retaining proteins not eluted by the addition of RNA. A stem-loop-binding protein (SLBP) occurring in nuclear extract and preparations of polysomes from a mouse myeloma cell line and binding specifically to histone RNA hairpin structures was described by Marzluff and co-workers (19Pandey N.B. Sun J. Marzluff W.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5653-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). SLBP·RNA complexes occur at similar high salt concentrations as HBF·wtHP complexes (19Pandey N.B. Sun J. Marzluff W.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5653-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), SLBP has a similar apparent molecular mass (45–50 kDa) (19Pandey N.B. Sun J. Marzluff W.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5653-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 22Hanson R.J. Sun J.H. Willis D.G. Marzluff W.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2146-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and similar binding specificity as HBF (31Williams A.S. Marzluff W.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 654-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), indicating strongly that SLBP is the mouse homologue of the bovine HBF. Partial purification of the polysomal SLBP produced a fraction containing three proteins from ∼36 to ∼52 kDa, and one of the polypeptides (of ∼45 kDa) was identified as the RNA-binding protein by NorthWestern blotting (22Hanson R.J. Sun J.H. Willis D.G. Marzluff W.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2146-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Using a genetic screening system developed to isolate RNA-binding proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we, as well as Marzluff and co-workers, have recently isolated the cDNA encoding for a human hairpin-binding protein (HBP) (32Sengupta D.J.

Genes Dev. 1997; 10: 3028-3040Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Comparison of calf thymus fraction V and fraction VI with the human HBP will be important to demonstrate that HBP is indeed involved in histone RNA processing. First comparisons of protease digestion patterns of the human HBP and of calf thymus HBF labeled by UV cross-linking to radiolabeled wtHP RNA already indicate that they are closely related (data not shown).
