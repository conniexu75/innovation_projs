Host defense mechanisms mediated by the immune system protect the host from the invading pathogens that continuously attempt to breach the mucosal and skin barriers. Individuals with diminished immune responses from inborn or acquired causes have an increased susceptibility to infections (Blot et al., 2002Blot S.I. Vandewoude K.H. Hoste E.A. Colardyn F.A.

Conversely, individuals with an overactive immune system are more susceptible to autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis, and inflammatory diseases such as gout, Crohn’s disease, and atherosclerosis (Gandhi et al., 2010Gandhi R.

Role of immune system in type 1 diabetes mellitus pathogenesis.Int. Immunopharmacol. 2014; 22: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Variability in the immune responses also influences susceptibility to other important pathologies such as malignant processes (de Visser et al., 2006de Visser K.E. Eichten A. Coussens L.M. Paradoxical roles of the immune system during cancer development.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 24-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1786) Google Scholar) and neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease (Heneka et al., 2015Heneka M.T. Golenbock D.T. Latz E. Innate immunity in Alzheimer’s disease.Nat. Immunol. 2015; 16: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, Mosley et al., 2012Mosley R.L. Hutter-Saunders J.A. Stone D.K. Gendelman H.E. Inflammation and adaptive immunity in Parkinson’s disease.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2012; 2: a009381Crossref Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This variability in immune responses is likely affected by factors already known to influence disease prevalence such as age, gender, and seasonality. For instance, women are more likely to suffer from autoimmune diseases, it gets more difficult to fight off infections with age, and influenza infections peak in winter. However, the differences in susceptibility to immune-mediated diseases between individuals cannot be fully accounted for by what is currently known, and a systems biology-based approach to comprehensively assess the environmental and host-related factors that influence immune responses is needed. Production and release of proinflammatory cytokines is one of the most important components of host defense mechanisms, representing the communication network within the immune system. So far, variation of cytokine production capacity in the general population has been investigated only in small studies, and this limitation resulted in conflicting conclusions (Aulock et al., 2006Aulock S.V.

The only large-scale studies of the immune system published to date are genome-wide studies focused on the regulatory effect of genetic variation on cytokine gene transcription levels (eQTLs) rather than on protein expression levels (Berry et al., 2010Berry M.P.

These studies were based on a limited number of stimulations or used unstimulated cells. The few studies assessing variability of cytokine production are all based on responses to standard immune stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Fairfax et al., 2014Fairfax B.P. Humburg P.

A comprehensive assessment of environmental and host factors influencing cytokine responses to a wide range of pathological and physiological stimuli is still lacking. The Human Functional Genomics Project (HFGP; www.humanfunctionalgenomics.org) aims to fill this gap. Within HFGP, the first major study that intends to assess the variability of human cytokine responses is the 500 Functional Genomics (500FG) study, comprising of a group of ∼500 healthy volunteers of Western-European ancestry. The specific aim of the 500FG cohort is to assess and integrate the various factors influencing individual human cytokine responses. The 500FG study has two important advantages compared to previous studies: first, it comprises the largest cohort of healthy individuals studied to date, and second, the cytokine production was assessed in response to a large panel of microbial and metabolic stimuli and in three different cellular systems. The current manuscript is the first in a series of three studies presented in this issue of Cell, that aim to provide a systematic assessment of the impact of various intrinsic and environmental factors (this manuscript), the host genome (Li et al., 2016Li Y. Oosting M. Smeekens S. Jaeger M. Aguirre-Gamboa R. Le K.T.T. Deelen P. Ricaño-Ponce I. Schoffelen T. Jansen A.F.M. et al.A functional genomics approach to understand variation in cytokine production in humans.Cell. 2016; 167 (this issue): 1099-1110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), and the gut microbiome (Schirmer et al., 2016Schirmer M. Smeekens S.P. Vlamakis H. Jaeger M. Oosting M. Franzosa E.A. Jansen T. Jacobs L. Bonder M.J. Kurilshikov A. et al.Linking the human gut microbiome to inflammatory cytokine production capacity.Cell. 2016; 167 (this issue): 1125-1136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), on baseline immune status and cytokine production in a systems biology-based approach. A schematic overview of these three studies on the 500FG cohort is presented in Figure 1. In this first study, we focus on environmental and non-genetic host factors that have been described to influence the immune response and/or disease prevalence (e.g., age, gender, BMI, oral contraceptive usage, smoking, vitamin D, and seasonality), but for which a comprehensive assessment of their effect on cytokine responses is missing. We observe that several of the studied factors directly influence immune parameters and host defense and we describe a novel vitamin D-independent/alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT)-dependent effect of seasonality on inflammation. To study variation in baseline immune status, we measured circulating concentrations of some of the most important families of parameters responsible for host defense in the circulation: acute phase proteins (CRP and AAT), immunoglobulins (IgA, IgM, IgG, and 4 IgG+ sub-classes), adipokines (leptin, adiponectin, and resistin), IL-6, IL-18, IL-18-binding protein (IL-18BP), IL-1β, and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra). Measurement of resting levels of low abundance cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-18, and VEGF are below the lower limit of quantification by standard ELISAs in a healthy cohort; therefore, the Ella microfluidic analyzer was used to assess cytokine concentrations in the fg/mL to low pg/mL range. For instance, the mean level of IL-6 concentrations of the cohort was 1.25 ± 0.06 pg/mL (range 0.15–8.1 pg/mL; see the STAR Methods for levels of all circulating mediators). The assessment of these parameters provides a comprehensive view of baseline immune characteristics, most importantly of inflammatory status and humoral immunity. The immune parameters were analyzed as a function of a set of environmental and intrinsic non-genetic host factors (age, gender, BMI, oral contraceptive usage, smoking, vitamin D concentrations, and seasonality) (Figure 2). As displayed in Figures 3A, 3B , and S2A, some cytokine levels show positive correlations with other cytokine levels. IL-1β concentrations show a strong correlation with IL-6 (p < 0.0001), a particularly relevant observation, because treatment of patients with IL-1β blocking therapies reveals a consistent fall in circulating IL-6 levels (Dinarello et al., 2012Dinarello C.A. Simon A. van der Meer J.W. Treating inflammation by blocking interleukin-1 in a broad spectrum of diseases.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2012; 11: 633-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar). IL-1Ra and IL-6 concentrations also correlate significantly because these are both markers of inflammation (Figure 3B). IL-1β circulating concentrations also correlated with IL-1Ra (p < 0.05), and this is in agreement with in vitro and human trial data demonstrating that IL-1β induces its own receptor antagonist. In line with the well-known anti-inflammatory effects of AAT (Bergin et al., 2012Bergin D.A. Hurley K. McElvaney N.G. Reeves E.P. Alpha-1 antitrypsin: a potent anti-inflammatory and potential novel therapeutic agent.Arch. Immunol. Ther. Exp. (Warsz.). 2012; 60: 81-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, Lewis, 2012Lewis E.C. Expanding the clinical indications for α(1)-antitrypsin therapy.Mol. Med. 2012; 18: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), the only strong negative correlation was found between AAT and IL-1β concentrations (Figure 3B). The concentrations of IL-6 and IL-1Ra are increased in the circulation of older individuals (Figure 3C, with relevant examples in Figure 3D). An increased low-level inflammation during the aging process (inflammaging) has been proposed as a culprit for metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases (Kovacic et al., 2011aKovacic J.C. Moreno P. Hachinski V. Nabel E.G. Fuster V. Cellular senescence, vascular disease, and aging: part 1 of a 2-part review.Circulation. 2011; 123: 1650-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, Kovacic et al., 2011bKovacic J.C. Moreno P.

Esther R.R. Aging, metabolic syndrome and the heart.Aging Dis. 2012; 3: 269-279PubMed Google Scholar), and in our study, the higher IL-6 and IL-1Ra concentrations with age gives weight to this hypothesis. The effect of age on IL-6 levels is also supported by the validation of these findings in a second independent cohort of 300 individuals from the HFGP (p = 1.12e-03, Figure S2E). With regard to gender, we find significantly higher circulating concentrations of IL-1Ra in women. This was previously observed in a cohort of type II diabetes patients (Ybarra et al., 2008Ybarra J. Lehmann T.N. Golay A. Juge-Aubry C.E. Roux-Lombard P. Dayer J.M. Meier C.A. Gender-based dimorphic pattern for interleukin-1 receptor antagonist in type 2 diabetes mellitus.Diabetes Metab. 2008; 34: 75-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), which we now confirm in healthy individuals. We also observe an increase in IL-18BP concentrations in older individuals (Figure 3C), and IL-18BP levels were also significantly higher in men than in women, while total IL-18 concentrations remained unaffected by both age and gender. However, in patients with cardiovascular disease, IL-18 levels are higher in men than in women (Opstad et al., 2011Opstad T.B. Pettersen A.A. Arnesen H. Seljeflot I. Circulating levels of IL-18 are significantly influenced by the IL-18 +183 A/G polymorphism in coronary artery disease patients with diabetes type 2 and the metabolic syndrome: an observational study.Cardiovasc. Diabetol. 2011; 10: 110Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). IgA immunoglobulin concentrations also increase with age (Figure 3C), as was previously detected in saliva (Gonzalez-Quintela et al., 2008Gonzalez-Quintela A. Alende R. Gude F. Campos J. Rey J. Meijide L.M. Fernandez-Merino C. Vidal C.

Salivary IgA and IgE levels in healthy subjects: relation to age and gender.Braz. Oral Res. 2010; 24: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). IgA has been implicated with several age-related diseases such as macular degeneration and diabetes, which makes IgA a potential therapeutic agent for prophylaxis and/or treatment (Rodriguez-Segade et al., 1996Rodriguez-Segade S. Camiña M.F. Carnero A. Lorenzo M.J. Alban A. Quinteiro C. Lojo S. High serum IgA concentrations in patients with diabetes mellitus: agewise distribution and relation to chronic complications.Clin.

Higher IgA was also detected in men compared to women, as supported by earlier studies, while circulating concentrations of IgM were higher in women (Cassidy et al., 1974Cassidy J.T. Nordby G.L.

In another study from the HFGP (Aguirre-Gamboa et al., 2016Aguirre-Gamboa R. Joosten I. P.C.M. U. van der Molen R.G. van Rijssen E. van Cranenbroek B. Oosting M. Smeekens S.P. Jaeger M.

Due to the larger number of factors corrected for, and stronger multiple testing correction applied in this manuscript, we observe only a borderline significant effect. However, using similar corrections we find false discovery rates (FDRs) of 4.06e-3 and 2.20e-3 for IgG2 and IgG4, respectively. Concentrations of leptin and adiponectin are higher in women than in men (Figure 3C). This is due to the higher percentage of adipose tissue in females compared to males, as well as a higher secretion rate of leptin in females compared to males as previously shown by others (Böttner et al., 2004Böttner A.

Adiponectin levels were also raised in older individuals. CRP levels show a positive association with the use of oral contraceptives, as shown by several earlier studies (Buchbinder et al., 2008Buchbinder S. Kratzsch J. Fiedler G.M. Yar V. Brügel M. Leichtle A. Weber W. Alexander H. Matthes G. Thiery J. Body weight and oral contraceptives are the most important modulators of serum CRP levels.Scand. J. Clin. Lab.

Treatment with combined oral contraceptives induces a rise in serum C-reactive protein in the absence of a general inflammatory response.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2006; 4: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, plasma VEGF was higher in women using oral contraceptives (Charnock-Jones et al., 2000Charnock-Jones D.S. Macpherson A.M. Archer D.F. Leslie S. Makkink W.K. Sharkey A.M. Smith S.K.

Reprod. 1999; 14: 3080-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) (Figure 3C), whereas circulating IL-18BP were lower. These findings provide clinical validation that biomarkers such as circulating low abundance cytokines reflect fundamental physiologic parameters in the absence of disease. To comprehensively capture cytokine responses of immune cells, we measured the production of both monocyte-derived (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6) and lymphocyte-derived cytokines (IFNγ, IL-17, IL-22) after stimulation in three ex vivo systems (whole blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMCs], and monocyte-derived macrophages) with 1 of 19 stimuli (eight bacterial, four fungal, one virus, four purified microbial ligands, and two metabolic stimuli). We used these complex cellular systems with 24-hr (monocyte-derived cytokines) and 7-day (lymphocyte-derived cytokines) stimulation times in order to mimic real-life situations, as opposed to artificial systems using purified cell populations. This resulted in a total of 128 cytokine measurements for each of the 534 individuals included in this study. This is by far the largest set of stimuli-cytokine combinations measured to date, with previous studies generally studying one or two stimuli in one experimental setting. In addition, the choice was made to focus on protein levels (that confer biological activity) rather than gene expression (as in earlier eQTL studies), because protein levels are a better representation of an individual’s immune state. Gene expression and protein expression levels of cytokines are not always correlated to one another, because post-transcriptional processes play a crucial role in determining the rate of cytokine synthesis and release (Anderson, 2008Anderson P. Post-transcriptional control of cytokine production.Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). A complete list of measurements is provided in Table S1, and example distributions are shown in Figure S1. The data for each participant (including all measurements of circulating immune parameters) can be found at https://hfgp.bbmri.nl/ (database is described in detail in the STAR Methods). Production of monocyte-derived cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6) after stimulation was similar across the ages of the volunteers, with the exception of Staphylococcus aureus-induced IL-1β and Candida albicans hyphae-induced IL-6, that showed a moderately higher production in the elderly. In contrast, there was a consistent effect of age on lymphocyte function, with the production of IFNγ and IL-22 being significantly lower in elderly individuals after stimulation with most pathogens, in line with the concept of immune-senescence (Baylis et al., 2013Baylis D. Bartlett D.B. Patel H.P. Roberts H.C. Understanding how we age: insights into inflammaging.Longev. Healthspan. 2013; 2: 8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, no such impairment with age was observed for the production of IL-17, an important product of Th17 cells. The strongest decrease of cytokine production in the older participants was observed after stimulation with Borrelia spp., as detailed and analyzed in the HFGP manuscript by Oosting et al., 2016Oosting M. Kerstholt M. ter Horst R. Li Y. Deelen P. Smeekens S. Jaeger M. Lachmandas E. Vrijmoeth H. Lupse M. et al.Functional and genomic architecture of Borrelia burgdorferi-induced cytokine responses in humans.Cell Host Microbe. 2016; (Published online November 3, 2016)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2016.10.006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar. The impact of age on cytokine production capacity induced by various microbial and metabolic stimuli is schematically depicted in Figure 4A, with relevant examples provided in Figure 4C. The production of proinflammatory cytokines released from monocytes was higher in men after stimulation with several stimuli. In the whole-blood system, these cytokines were increased in men after LPS stimulation, while in PBMCs this effect was apparent especially after stimulation of C. albicans conidia. Figure 4B presents an overview of the gender effects on cytokine production, with examples shown in Figure 4E. Although the use of oral contraceptives did not have strong effects on cytokine production capacity in vitro, women using oral contraceptives did show an even further decreased IFNγ and TNF-α response after LPS stimulation (Figures 4D and 4E). Th17 responses were mostly similar between men and women, although IL-17 and IL-22 production was higher in women after stimulation with C. albicans hyphae (Figure 4B). To investigate whether differences in circulating hormone levels may have a role in the above-described gender effects, we assessed the correlation of inflammatory markers with the levels of progesterone and testosterone in men and women separately. The majority of the cytokines and mediators identified to differ between men and women showed no correlation with progesterone and testosterone concentrations, excluding a potential role of hormones in explaining the gender differences. However, we identified several notable exceptions, with the significant correlations displayed in Figure 4F (all correlations in Figure S2C ). One of the most important findings is that leptin concentrations"

Culture-independent microbiome studies have increased our understanding of the complexity and metabolic potential of microbial communities. However, to understand the contribution of individual microbiome members to community functions, it is important to determine which bacteria are actively replicating. We developed an algorithm, iRep, that uses draft-quality genome sequences and single time-point metagenome sequencing to infer microbial population replication rates. The algorithm calculates an index of replication (iRep) based on the sequencing coverage trend that results from bi-directional genome replication from a single origin of replication. We apply this method to show that microbial replication rates increase after antibiotic administration in human infants. We also show that uncultivated, groundwater-associated, Candidate Phyla Radiation bacteria only rarely replicate quickly in subsurface communities undergoing substantial changes in geochemistry. Our method can be applied to any genome-resolved microbiome study to track organism responses to varying conditions, identify actively growing populations and measure replication rates for use in modeling studies."

In addition to 17 novel genome-wide significant cytokine QTLs (cQTLs), our study provides a comprehensive picture of the genetic variants that influence six different cytokines in whole blood, blood mononuclear cells, and macrophages. Important biological pathways that contain cytokine QTLs map to pattern recognition receptors (TLR1-6-10 cluster), cytokine and complement inhibitors, and the kallikrein system. The cytokine QTLs show enrichment for monocyte-specific enhancers, are more often located in regions under positive selection, and are significantly enriched among SNPs associated with infections and immune-mediated diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2547071550,"Detailed descriptions of brain-scale sensorimotor circuits underlying vertebrate behavior remain elusive. Recent advances in zebrafish neuroscience offer new opportunities to dissect such circuits via whole-brain imaging, behavioral analysis, functional perturbations, and network modeling. Here, we harness these tools to generate a brain-scale circuit model of the optomotor response, an orienting behavior evoked by visual motion. We show that such motion is processed by diverse neural response types distributed across multiple brain regions. To transform sensory input into action, these regions sequentially integrate eye- and direction-specific sensory streams, refine representations via interhemispheric inhibition, and demix locomotor instructions to independently drive turning and forward swimming. While experiments revealed many neural response types throughout the brain, modeling identified the dimensions of functional connectivity most critical for the behavior. We thus reveal how distributed neurons collaborate to generate behavior and illustrate a paradigm for distilling functional circuit models from whole-brain data."
https://openalex.org/W2548399475,"In obesity, macrophages and other immune cells accumulate in insulin target tissues, promoting a chronic inflammatory state and insulin resistance. Galectin-3 (Gal3), a lectin mainly secreted by macrophages, is elevated in both obese subjects and mice. Administration of Gal3 to mice causes insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, whereas inhibition of Gal3, through either genetic or pharmacologic loss of function, improved insulin sensitivity in obese mice. In vitro treatment with Gal3 directly enhanced macrophage chemotaxis, reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in myocytes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes and impaired insulin-mediated suppression of glucose output in primary mouse hepatocytes. Importantly, we found that Gal3 can bind directly to the insulin receptor (IR) and inhibit downstream IR signaling. These observations elucidate a novel role for Gal3 in hepatocyte, adipocyte, and myocyte insulin resistance, suggesting that Gal3 can link inflammation to decreased insulin sensitivity. Inhibition of Gal3 could be a new approach to treat insulin resistance."

It began following the cross-species transmission of EBOV from an animal reservoir, most likely bats, into humans, with phylogenetic analysis revealing the co-circulation of several viral lineages. We hypothesized that this prolonged human circulation led to genomic changes that increased viral transmissibility in humans. We generated a synthetic glycoprotein (GP) construct based on the earliest reported isolate and introduced amino acid substitutions that defined viral lineages. Mutant GPs were used to generate a panel of pseudoviruses, which were used to infect different human and bat cell lines.

Since its beginnings in December 2013, the West African outbreak of Ebola virus (EBOV; Makona variant) has resulted in more than 28,000 confirmed or suspected cases and more than 11,000 deaths (W.H.O., 2016W.H.O. (2016). Ebola Situation Report, W.H. Organisation, ed.Google Scholar). As with previous human outbreaks, the West African epidemic began following the successful cross-species transmission of EBOV from an animal reservoir into humans, with mounting evidence that a number of bat species are the likely natural reservoir and maintain the virus between human outbreaks (Leroy et al., 2005Leroy E.M.

We speculated that a number of GP substitutions, including those at potential N-linked glycosylation sites and those within and around the mucin-like domain (Lee et al., 2008Lee J.E. Fusco M.L. Hessell A.J. Oswald W.B. Burton D.R. Saphire E.O. Structure of the Ebola virus glycoprotein bound to an antibody from a human survivor.Nature. 2008; 454: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), could affect GP-mediated entry and, in turn, facilitate human adaptation. To identify GP amino acid changes that may have increased viral transmissibility in humans, we compared 1,610 full-length genome sequences of EBOV Makona viruses from the West African outbreak of 2013–2016. These viruses were sampled from Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Mali. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences revealed the presence of two major lineages: lineage A, which only comprised sequences obtained from Guinea, including the earliest sampled viruses from the outbreak as a whole; and lineage B, which contained a much larger number of sequences (including those previously assigned to lineages SL1, SL2, and SL3 [Gire et al., 2014Gire S.K. Goba A. Andersen K.G. Sealfon R.S. Park D.J. Kanneh L. Jalloh S. Momoh M. Fullah M. Dudas G. et al.Genomic surveillance elucidates Ebola virus origin and transmission during the 2014 outbreak.Science. 2014; 345: 1369-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar]) from all of the affected countries and hence has a far wider geographic distribution (Figure 1 and Data S1). Mapping all GP amino acid substitutions onto our whole-genome phylogeny revealed that lineages A and B are distinguished by a single Ala-Val amino acid substitution in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of GP at residue 82 (A82V; Figure 1). In addition, both lineages A and B contained a number of sub-lineages that were defined by additional amino acid substitutions elsewhere in the GP (Figure 1 and Data S1). To determine whether these lineage-specific amino acid substitutions resulted in more efficient human cell infection, and hence increased fitness, we generated a panel of GP mutants based on the earliest sampled Makona isolate, Kissidougou-C15 (GenBank: KJ660346, sampled from Guinea in March 2014; Figure 2), and tested their ability to support entry into a range of human and bat cell lines using a lentiviral pseudotype assay (Urbanowicz et al., 2016Urbanowicz R.A. McClure C.P. King B. Mason C.P. Ball J.K. Tarr A.W. Novel functional hepatitis C virus glycoprotein isolates identified using an optimized viral pseudotype entry assay.J. Gen. Virol. 2016; 97: 2265-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although variants from both lineages A and B reached higher infectivity in human cells than Kissidougou-C15 (Figure 3), the A82V change appears to have set the GP on separate evolutionary pathways, as we observed distinct sets of additional amino acid changes in each lineage that increased entry efficacy in human cells. However, despite the evolutionary diversification that was apparent in both lineages, the V82 background (lineage B) appeared conducive to reaching higher infectivity than viruses with A82 (lineage A; Figure 3).Figure 3Differential Infectivity of Pseudoviruses Supplemented with EBOV Makona GP Mutants in Human CellsShow full caption(A–C) Relative infectivity of each glycoprotein was expressed as a proportion (%) of that observed for the Kissidougou-C15 strain in HuH7 (A), BEAS-2B (B), and A549 (C) cells.

(D–F) Plots of normalized infectivity for the three human cell lines and correlations were calculated using Pearson’s correlation test. See also Figure S2. The A82V substitution (variant B1) alone resulted in an almost 2-fold increase in infectivity in human cells compared to the reference Kissidougou-C15 strain (Figure 3; p < 0.01). Other amino acid changes further increased the effect of A82V. For example, R29K (variant B7), which falls within the GP signal peptide, resulted in a major increase in entry efficacy. Similarly, substitutions T206M (variant B12) and T230A (variant B13) in the GP glycan cap, which resulted in a loss of conserved N-glycosylation branching at N204 and N228, respectively, strongly increased GP entry in human cells. Subsequent substitutions in the T230A cluster of EBOV sequences, such as T485A (variant B14) in the mucin-like domain of GP or D637G at the end of GP2 (variant B16), did not appear to modulate viral entry further. Within the more geographically restricted lineage A, variant A1, containing a single W291R substitution in the glycan cap, resulted in a marked increase in entry efficacy in HuH7 and BEAS-2B cells (Figure 3; p < 0.01). These data also revealed the importance of epistatic interactions to viral adaptation. In lineage A, we observed strong positive epistasis involving residue 330. Specifically, following an initial G480D change, a P330S substitution occurred with either N107D (variant A6) or H407Y after a reversion of G480D (variant A5; Figure 1). Strikingly, the co-occurrence of P330S with G480D evolved independently in lineage B (Data S1), compatible with the idea that, in combination, these mutants increase fitness. Indeed, in our HuH7 entry assay, mutants A5 and A6 were significantly more entry efficient than the reference Kissidougou-C15 strain (Figure 3; p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). In contrast, variants with the P330S substitution alone (mutant A′2), or in combination with either G480D (mutant A′3) or N107D (mutant A′4), were all less infectious than the reference sequence in HuH7 cells (p < 0.05); none of these changes were sampled during the outbreak. The impact of epistasis can also be seen within lineage B involving glycan cap domain residues P202L and L239S. While the initial P202L substitution (variant B4) decreased infectivity in HuH7 cells compared to the A82V mutant, the subsequent emergence of L239S (variant B6), which occurred in two different branches within this cluster (Data S1), resulted in significantly higher infectivity than the A82V change alone in all human cell lines tested (p < 0.01). Importantly, the L239S substitution alone, which was not observed during the outbreak, did not result in increased entry (variant B′5; Figure 3). This again suggests that fitness increases result from epistatic interactions. GP residue 82 was also seemingly involved in epistatic interactions. For example, the I371V change (variant B2), which defines a large cluster of sequences from Sierra Leone (Data S1), increased entry efficacy up to 2-fold in the 82V background (lineage B). However, in the context of the 82A background that defines lineage A, I371V (variant AB′3) decreased HuH7 cell infectivity (p < 0.001). The AB′3 variant was not sampled during the outbreak. Conversely, the presence of P375S, in association with 82A, increased infectivity (variant AB′11) but decreased infectivity in the presence of 82V (variant B10; Figure 3). While the majority of amino acid substitutions observed in the outbreak improved human cell entry, some changes in lineage B, including R410S (variant B8), resulted in reduced fitness. Notably, a subset of viruses in this cluster acquired an additional K439E change (variant B9) that enhanced entry efficacy 3-fold (p < 0.01) in HuH7 cells. Interestingly, a set of lineage B viruses with R410S and K439E were sampled in a community of fishermen in Sierra Leone, characterized by an unusually severe disease presentation (Capobianchi et al., 2015Capobianchi M.R. Gruber C.E. Carletti F. Meschi S. Castilletti C. Vairo F. Biava M. Minosse C. Strada G. Portella G. et al.Molecular signature of the ebola virus associated with the fishermen community outbreak in Aberdeen, Sierra Leone, in February 2015.Genome Announc. 2015; (Published online September 24, 2015)https://dx.doi.org/10.1128/genomeA.01093-15Google Scholar). Finally, it is important to note that pseudovirus entry in one human cell line correlated well with the infectivity observed in the other human lines tested (Figures 3D–3F), indicating that the effect was independent of the anatomical site from where the cells were derived. Having seen evidence of adaptation to human cells, we next determined whether EBOV evolution during the outbreak impacted the entry into liver and kidney cell lines derived from Hypsignathus monstrosus, one of the putative fruit bat hosts. The most striking feature of this analysis was the general reversal in infectivity compared to human cells (Figure 4); indeed, there was a statistically significant negative correlation between infectivity in H. monstrosus compared to human cell lines (Figure 5). Obvious reversals in phenotype were apparent for individual mutants. For example, the lineage B variant R410S (variant B8), which resulted in low entry efficacy in human cells, was highly efficient in infecting H. monstrosus cells. In contrast, the additional K439E substitution (variant B9), which enhanced infectivity in human cells, abolished this effect (p < 0.05; Figure 4). This pattern of decreased infectivity in fruit bat cells concomitant with GP evolution was also observed for kidney cells derived from Epomops buettikoferi (Figure S1A) and Rousettus aegyptiacus bats (Figure S1B), although the strength of the effect, and hence the correlations of infectivity in human cells compared to these alternative fruit bat cells, were less pronounced (Figure S2). Finally, we assessed EBOV-GP-mediated entry in cell lines derived from the insectivorous bats Hipposideros abae and Myotis daubentonii. Neither of these could be infected by EBOV GP pseudoviruses but were permissive for entry by PVs supplemented with control VSV G protein (data not shown).Figure 5Negative Correlation of GP Mutant Infectivity between Hypsignathus Monstrosus Cells and Human CellsShow full caption(A–F) Normalized infectivity data for each GP mutant were plotted for HypLu/45.1 cells versus HuH7 (A), BEAS-2B (B), and A549 (C) and HypNi/1.1 cells versus HuH7 (D), BEAS-2B (E), and A549 (F).

As selectively advantageous mutations that spread through the viral population will fall on deeper branches on the phylogeny, we identified a number of lineage-defining GP amino acid substitutions and, using a pseudotype entry assay, showed that many of these conferred increased human cell entry. Hence, these data strongly suggest that a number of specific amino acid substitutions in EBOV, particularly although not exclusively A82V, increased tropism for human cells and facilitated adaptive evolution. Interestingly, the reported increase in overall viremia in the Conakry (Guinea) area during the summer of 2014 (Faye et al., 2015Faye O. Andronico A. Faye O. Salje H. Boëlle P.Y. Magassouba N.

Diallo A.A. et al.Use of Viremia to Evaluate the Baseline Case Fatality Ratio of Ebola Virus Disease and Inform Treatment Studies: A Retrospective Cohort Study.PLoS Med. 2015; 12: e1001908Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) is coincident with the introduction of lineage B variants from Sierra Leone. An accompanying manuscript from Diehl and colleagues in this issue of Cell independently shows that A82V increased viral infectivity in a variety of human primary cells and continuous cell lines, supporting the hypothesis that A82V is a fitness adaptation (Diehl et al., 2016Diehl W.E. Lin A.E. Grubaugh N.D. Carvalho L.M. Kyusik K. Kyawe P.P. McCauley S.M. Donnard E. Kucukural A. McDonel P. et al.Ebola virus glycoprotein with increased infectivity dominated the 2013-2016 epidemic.Cell. 2016; 167 (this issue): 1088-1098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Residue 82 lies in a short α-helix (termed α1) of the RBD, which is involved in binding the filovirus receptor protein Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1). In the helix, residue 82 points toward the hydrophobic core of GP in the face opposing the one contacted by NPC1. The crystal structure of the complex (Wang et al., 2016Wang H. Shi Y. Song J. Qi J. Lu G. Yan J. Gao G.F. Ebola Viral Glycoprotein Bound to Its Endosomal Receptor Niemann-Pick C1.Cell. 2016; 164: 258-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) shows that the interaction with the receptor results in displacement (gliding) of the helix along the hydrophobic core of the GP (Figure 6), implying that the nature of the side chain at position 82 will affect this gliding. Homology modeling (data not shown) shows that the presence of valine instead of alanine makes the α1 helix slightly protrude outward to accommodate the two extra methyl groups of its side chain. Although the residues in bat NPC1 that are directly contacted by the GP α1 helix are conserved with respect to human NPC1, some changes fall nearby, for instance, residue NPC1 127 (labeled in green in Figure 6), which is a charged lysine in human NPC1 and a hydrophobic isoleucine in bats. This could lead to a more favorable overall interaction with human versus bat NPC1. Indeed, single substitutions in the two protruding loops of NPC1 that contact the GP were shown to restrict host susceptibility to EBOV (Ng et al., 2015Ng M. Ndungo E. Kaczmarek M.E. Herbert A.S. Binger T. Kuehne A.I. Jangra R.K. Hawkins J.A. Gifford R.J. Biswas R. et al.Filovirus receptor NPC1 contributes to species-specific patterns of ebolavirus susceptibility in bats.eLife. 2015; 4: e11785PubMed Google Scholar). The reduction of infectivity in bat cells associated with the lineage-defining A82V substitution further highlights the key role played by amino acid changes in and around the α1 helix of the GP in modulating EBOV entry in different mammalian hosts (Martinez et al., 2013Martinez O. Ndungo E. Tantral L. Miller E.H. Leung L.W. Chandran K. Basler C.F. A mutation in the Ebola virus envelope glycoprotein restricts viral entry in a host species- and cell-type-specific manner.J. Virol. 2013; 87: 3324-3334Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In addition, because there is a rearrangement of the GP in the region of the α1 helix upon receptor binding, it is possible that the A82V change may also affect the dynamics of the conformational changes that occur during the entry process. Indeed, a number of epistatic changes, for example, I371V and P375S, were associated with residue 82, and these observations hint at functional interactions between the mucin-like domain, cleaved during GP priming, and the receptor-binding domain, which must be uncovered after cleavage for NPC1 binding to take place (Figure 6A). In addition to A82V, a number of additional amino acid changes that arose during the outbreak also conferred increased efficiency for human cell entry. One of these—R29K (variant B7) —was located in the signal peptide, mutations in which have previously been associated with changes in glycosylation and the enhancement of infectivity (Marzi et al., 2006Marzi A. Akhavan A. Simmons G. Gramberg T. Hofmann H. Bates P. Lingappa V.R. Pöhlmann S. The signal peptide of the ebolavirus glycoprotein influences interaction with the cellular lectins DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR.J. Virol. 2006; 80: 6305-6317Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Similarly, mutations that resulted in the loss of conserved N-glycosylation sites (T206M in variant B12 and T230A in variant B13, affecting N-glycosylation on N204 and N228) strongly increased GP entry into human cells. Removal of N-glycosylation sites has been shown to enhance viral entry in vitro, although leaving the GP more susceptible to neutralization (Lennemann et al., 2014Lennemann N.J. Rhein B.A. Ndungo E. Chandran K. Qiu X. Maury W. Comprehensive functional analysis of N-linked glycans on Ebola virus GP1.MBio. 2014; 5 (e00862–e13)Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2546431897,"The magnitude of the 2013-2016 Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic enabled an unprecedented number of viral mutations to occur over successive human-to-human transmission events, increasing the probability that adaptation to the human host occurred during the outbreak. We investigated one nonsynonymous mutation, Ebola virus (EBOV) glycoprotein (GP) mutant A82V, for its effect on viral infectivity. This mutation, located at the NPC1-binding site on EBOV GP, occurred early in the 2013-2016 outbreak and rose to high frequency. We found that GP-A82V had heightened ability to infect primate cells, including human dendritic cells. The increased infectivity was restricted to cells that have primate-specific NPC1 sequences at the EBOV interface, suggesting that this mutation was indeed an adaptation to the human host. GP-A82V was associated with increased mortality, consistent with the hypothesis that the heightened intrinsic infectivity of GP-A82V contributed to disease severity during the EVD epidemic."

https://openalex.org/W2547330414,"Recent theories of limb control emphasize motor cortex as a dynamical system, with planning setting the initial neural state, and execution arising from the self-limiting evolution of the intrinsic neural dynamics. Therefore, movements that share an initial trajectory but then diverge might have different neural states during the execution of the identical initial trajectories. We hypothesized that motor adaptation maps neural states to changes in motor command. This predicts that two opposing perturbations, which interfere when experienced over the same movement, could be learned if each is associated with a different plan even if not executed. We show that planning, but not executing, different follow-through movements allow opposing perturbations to be learned simultaneously over the same movement. However, no learning occurs if different follow throughs are executed, but not planned prior to movement initiation. Our results suggest neural, rather than physical states, are the critical factor associated with motor adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W2547533539,"Cell types more advanced in development than embryonic stem cells, such as EpiSCs, fail to contribute to chimeras when injected into pre-implantation-stage blastocysts, apparently because the injected cells undergo apoptosis. Here we show that transient promotion of cell survival through expression of the anti-apoptotic gene BCL2 enables EpiSCs and Sox17+ endoderm progenitors to integrate into blastocysts and contribute to chimeric embryos. Upon injection into blastocyst, BCL2-expressing EpiSCs contributed to all bodily tissues in chimeric animals while Sox17+ endoderm progenitors specifically contributed in a region-specific fashion to endodermal tissues. In addition, BCL2 expression enabled rat EpiSCs to contribute to mouse embryonic chimeras, thereby forming interspecies chimeras that could survive to adulthood. Our system therefore provides a method to overcome cellular compatibility issues that typically restrict chimera formation. Application of this type of approach could broaden the use of embryonic chimeras, including region-specific chimeras, for basic developmental biology research and regenerative medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2548784951,"It is widely believed that inflammation associated with obesity has an important role in the development of type 2 diabetes. IκB kinase beta (IKKβ) is a crucial kinase that responds to inflammatory stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) by initiating a variety of intracellular signaling cascades and is considered to be a key element in the inflammation-mediated development of insulin resistance. We show here, contrary to expectation, that IKKβ-mediated inflammation is a positive regulator of hepatic glucose homeostasis. IKKβ phosphorylates the spliced form of X-Box Binding Protein 1 (XBP1s) and increases the activity of XBP1s. We have used three experimental approaches to enhance the IKKβ activity in the liver of obese mice and observed increased XBP1s activity, reduced ER stress, and a significant improvement in insulin sensitivity and consequently in glucose homeostasis. Our results reveal a beneficial role of IKKβ-mediated hepatic inflammation in glucose homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2547809526,"The prevalence of obesity is increasing worldwide and has tripled in men of reproductive age since the 1970s. Concerningly, obesity is not only comorbid with other chronic diseases, but there is mounting evidence that it increases the non-communicable disease load in their children (eg mortality, obesity, autism). Animal studies have demonstrated that paternal obesity increases the risk of metabolic (eg glucose metabolism defects, obesity) and reproductive disorders in offspring. Epigenetic changes within sperm are clear mechanistic candidates that are associated with both changes to the father’s environment and offspring phenotype. Specifically there is emerging evidence that a father’s sperm microRNA content both responds to paternal environmental cues and alters the gene expression profile and subsequent development of the early embryo. We used a mouse model of high fat diet (HFD) induced obesity to investigate whether male obesity could modulate sperm microRNA content. We also investigated whether this alteration to a father’s sperm microRNA content lead to a similar change in the sperm of male offspring. Our investigations were initially guided by a Taqman PCR array, which indicated the differential abundance of 28 sperm borne microRNAs in HFD mice. qPCR confirmation in a much larger cohort of founder males demonstrated that 13 of these microRNAs were differentially abundant (11 up-regulated; 2 down-regulated) due to HFD feeding. Despite metabolic and reproductive phenotypes also being observed in grand-offspring fathered via the male offspring lineage, there was no evidence that any of the 13 microRNAs were also dysregulated in male offspring sperm. This was presumably due to the variation seen within both groups of offspring and suggests other mechanisms might act between offspring and grand-offspring. Thus 13 sperm borne microRNAs are modulated by a father’s HFD and the presumed transfer of this altered microRNA payload to the embryo at fertilisation potentially acts to alter the embryonic molecular makeup post-fertilisation, altering its growth trajectory, ultimately affecting adult offspring phenotype and may contribute to paternal programming."
https://openalex.org/W2548394795,"Because novel neurotechnologies may alter human identity and society in profound ways, we advocate for the early integration of ethics into neurotechnology. We recommend developing and adopting a set of guidelines, like the Belmont Report on human subject research, as a framework for development and use of brain-related technologies. Because novel neurotechnologies may alter human identity and society in profound ways, we advocate for the early integration of ethics into neurotechnology. We recommend developing and adopting a set of guidelines, like the Belmont Report on human subject research, as a framework for development and use of brain-related technologies. The Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative, as well as other such large-scale projects around the world, is poised to revolutionize our capacity for recording and manipulating large-scale neuronal activity. These methods could spur a new era in the scientific understanding of neural circuits and also enable powerful novel therapeutic approaches to mental and neurological diseases. At the same time, these methods will provide access to the core mechanisms that underlie human identify, memories, emotions, personality and, more generally, our minds. As such, they could have profound consequences for human identity and society. Spurred by a recent workshop that brought together neurotechnologists and bioethicists (http://ntc-symposium.org), in this Commentary we highlight the need for strong advocacy toward developing and funding neuroethical work to accompany these advances in neuroscience and to guide the development of neurotechnologies. We think that the time is ripe, given that neural interventions currently being studied in many animal models already demonstrate the capacity to decode imagery and intentions, stimulate or alter sensory perceptions, enhance and combine brain processing power, and alter animal behavior. Even scientists working directly in these areas can recognize the rich opportunities to better understand neural processing while still expressing some trepidation about the kind of future we may be bringing about. This situation calls for the development of a clear set of guidelines, similar to the Belmont Commission Report, to integrate the development and use of these technologies with our core societal and human values. These guidelines could be developed by multidisciplinary panels, composed of scientific, medical, bioethical, and legal experts, as well as representatives of the citizenry at large. Such panels would help to ensure that neurotechnology is developed in ways that are sensitive to some of the profound qualities that serve as the condition of human experience: private mental life, agential action on the world, and an understanding of individuals as bounded by their bodies. The BRAIN initiative, sponsored by the White House in 2013, is a large-scale, 12-year-long project aimed at creating tools to interrogate and alter neural circuits in experimental animals and humans with unprecedented detail (https://www.whitehouse.gov/BRAIN). Similar initiatives are now underway in the European Union, Japan, Korea, Canada, Australia, Israel, and China. As a consequence of these projects, more than two hundred laboratories around the world are now funded to systematically develop new methods for recording and manipulating the activity of neural circuits, including awake behaving animals or human subjects. These methods use optical, electrical, or chemical platforms, aided by novel computational tools that help decipher this trove of neural activity. While we are still far from properly “breaking the code” that any nervous system uses to generate behavior or mental states, decoding efforts are progressing swiftly. For example, using the relatively low spatio-temporal resolution method of fMRI, researchers can start to predict the activity patterns associated with complex visual stimuli that a human subject has been exposed to (Kay et al., 2008Kay K.N. Naselaris T. Prenger R.J. Gallant J.L. Nature. 2008; 452: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar), and the ability to access high-quality recordings of neural activity will make these efforts more powerful. Once encoding models are accurate, researchers may be able to decode visual imagery from active human subjects, enabling a technology-based kind of “mind reading.” Visual imagery is just one of many possibilities for decoding: other scenarios such as the decoding of speech, thoughts (including lies), and dreams, or even the decoding of internal states of animals, can be envisioned. Brain decoding could become ubiquitous. Human subjects using portable decoders could also perhaps covertly communicate with each other without the need to speak, sign, or type their thoughts. In addition, powerful methods can start to manipulate neuronal activity with single-cell precision. In experimental animals, such as worms, Drosophila, zebra fish, or mice, optogenetics is routinely used to alter behavior (Yizhar et al., 2011Yizhar O. Fenno L.E. Davidson T.J. Mogri M. Deisseroth K. Neuron. 2011; 71: 9-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar), including triggering of memories (Ramirez et al., 2013Ramirez S. Liu X. Lin P.-A. Suh J. Pignatelli M. Redondo R.L. Ryan T.J. Tonegawa S. Science. 2013; 341: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Two-photon optogenetics enables researchers to implant, and later replay, patterns of activity into the cerebral cortex of awake mice (Carrillo-Reid et al., 2016Carrillo-Reid L. Yang W. Bando Y. Peterka D.S. Yuste R. Science. 2016; 353: 691-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). While optogenetics is unlikely to be applied to humans in the near future because it involves genetic manipulation, other optical stimulation methods using optochemical compound or nanoparticles do not require any genetic manipulation and could be more easily adaptable to humans. Such interventions offer considerable promise for managing unwanted patterns of thought and behavior in human patients but also raise daunting possibilities for control. Manipulating neural circuits to alter behavior in human subjects is not new. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) devices are routinely used as treatment for many neurological diseases with some success, though, in some cases, they lead to changes in personality and behavior. In others cases, subjects report feeling the need to use DBS in order to “become themselves” (Vlek et al., 2012Vlek R.J. Steines D. Szibbo D. Kübler A. Schneider M.J. Haselager P. Nijboer F. J. Neurol. Phys. Ther. 2012; 36: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition, brain computer interfaces (BCI) are routinely used in a wide variety of clinical applications to record neuronal activity and connect it via computer systems to control robotic or prosthetic limbs or devices. With BCIs, subjects can be trained to operate robotic prostheses with their thoughts. Such interfaces have provided the ability for paralyzed patients to move prosthetic limbs (Hochberg et al., 2006Hochberg L.R. Serruya M.D. Friehs G.M. Mukand J.A. Saleh M. Caplan A.H. Branner A. Chen D. Penn R.D. Donoghue J.P. Nature. 2006; 442: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (2430) Google Scholar). Again, once high-quality recordings on neural activity become routine, BCI will become much more powerful. In particular, if neural recordings are performed in a non-invasive fashion, BCI could become widely used to augment the physical or intellectual capabilities of humans. In addition, several human subjects could jointly train connected BCIs to perform a joint task, blurring the identity (and responsibility) of individual users. While some would say that these scenarios are still in the realm of science-fiction, we believe that they are coming down the pipeline, given ongoing research. Thus, they warrant the question of how the application of novel neurotechnologies to humans should be properly guided and regulated. This problem is not novel, since humankind has been experimenting with methods to alter and manipulate brain activity for thousands of years, for example with alcohol, recreational drugs, or pharmacology. But while those methods normally affect the brain in a relatively coarse fashion, the more we learn about neural processing and the more powerful neuromodulation methods become, the more profound will be the effect of these manipulations on mental states and behavior. Ethical, legal, and societal issues arising from novel neurotechnologies are many and could unfold progressively: some issues may arise in the very near term, whereas others are farther out and will depend on how research in the intervening period proceeds. Here, we review just a few issues on the horizon, given topics within currently funded neuroscientific research. One of the more important ethical and philosophical issues ahead is the possibility of substantial changes in the concept of self. While at present we tend to identify ourselves as relatively separate, private entities bounded by our bodies (and even on more dynamic, relational views, like Baylis, 2013Baylis F. Neuroethics. 2013; 6: 513-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, we still have private consciousness and distinct agency), the use of novel neurotechnologies may lead to a partial dissolution of traditional ideas of self. Access to neural activity will also call into the question the privacy of our internal lives (Farah and Wolpe, 2004Farah M.J. Wolpe P.R. Hastings Cent. Rep. 2004; 34: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), while the capacity to neuromodulate that activity may alter our sense of agency (Haselager, 2013Haselager P. Minds Mach. 2013; 23: 405-418Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar), along with issues of moral and legal responsibility for our thoughts and actions (Farahany, 2012Farahany N. Stanford Law Rev. 2012; 64: 351-408Google Scholar). If our neural activity can control devices beyond our bodies through thought alone (via BCI devices), our internal body schemas may stretch to encompass the devices under our immediate conscious control, essentially extending our sense of self beyond the boundaries of our bodies. BCI users can already learn to control a robotic arm just by thinking; what if they could send it out of the room to collect a needed item? Where is the user in this scenario? In the other direction, we can also envision changes to our sense of self through the possibility of collecting multiple BCI users into a shared task in a way that results in a common action. Brain-to-brain interface experiments (Stocco et al., 2015Stocco A. Prat C.S. Losey D.M. Cronin J.A. Wu J. Abernethy J.A. Rao R.P. PLoS ONE. 2015; 10: e0137303https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0137303Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar), while still primitive in many respects, demonstrate the possibility of sending neural activity from one person’s brain directly into another person’s brain. Some experiments have demonstrated the capacity to connect neural activity of even three different experimental animals for a common purpose (Pais-Vieira et al., 2015Pais-Vieira M. Chiuffa G. Lebedev M. Yadav A. Nicolelis M.A. Sci. Rep. 2015; 5: 11869Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In these scenarios, assignments of responsibility and understandings of self and agency will be complicated. The boundary of self (as body) becomes permeable to another’s consciousness and control. These issues are philosophically profound and morally and legally momentous. Traditional understandings of who (and where) we are and what we are responsible for are foundational for our legal systems and our moral interactions with each other. Proper protections for private internal spaces and agential identity will need to be integrated into our understandings of human rights. The use of methods that may substantially alter one’s personality, thoughts, and sensorimotor experience requires attention to individual and societal protections. In addition, the ability to augment one’s physical or mental performance raises a host of issues about fairness and justice regarding how those augmenting technologies should be accessed or regulated. Are they intended for mass consumption, or should they be restricted to human users who have identifiable impairments (Aas and Wasserman, 2016Aas S. Wasserman D. J. Med. Ethics. 2016; 42: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar)? How should we think about the standards of “normal functioning” and ability expectation (Wolbring and Diep, 2016Wolbring G. Diep L. Cognitive/Neuroenhancement Through an Ability Studies Lens.in: Jotterand F. Dubljevic V. Cognitive Enhancement: Ethical and Policy Implications in International Perspectives. Oxford University Press, 2016: 57-75Crossref Google Scholar) in the context of technologies that suggest a kind of ability revolution? If such technology is expensive, as it is bound to be at the beginning, it could generate or exacerbate societal divisions among the population or among inhabitants of different countries. Pertinent to this discussion are the mobile “smart” devices, such as cell phones, that are increasingly part of our decision making and that could be interpreted as a basic, low-tech BCI devices. The current generation of smart phones is the precursor of future, more powerful prosthetic devices, which could be worn or implanted. The profound impact that smart phones have had in our society and culture over the last decade presages an even larger effect that brain-controlled wearable electronics devices may have. Importantly, in addition to enhancing our access to information, these interactive neural devices incorporate machine-learning algorithms (e.g., in the service of facial recognition software) that may incorporate and reproduce implicit bias, reinforcing negative stereotypes among racial groups or minorities. Although many of the novel neurotechnologies are currently being explored in the context of medical research and patient care, or in the frame of assistive devices, as with all technology, they are also likely to have commercial applications that would, of necessity, involve different forms of regulation and oversight. Furthermore, one can easily envision military or security applications. As with issues such as chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons or, more recently, cyber warfare, this raises the concern as to the rules under which novel neurotechnologies should be used, if at all, in human conflagrations. We think it is fair to say that, to date, we lack any agreed-upon guidelines to responsibly shape the development and application of these novel neurotechnologies. How could one approach the task of building such ethical guidelines? One possibility is to follow the case of medicine as a natural example, given that medical technology also represents a set of methods that interfere with the function of the human body. Indeed, in medicine, the use of technologies to monitor and alter the capabilities of the human body has always been guided by a common humanistic goal: to help patients in need or, more generally, to promote, without borders, the health of the entire population of the world. Over millennia, at least since the Hippocratic Oath, medicine has developed a corpus of ethical rules that have formed a deontology. These medical ethics principles are taught in medical schools and adhered to closely by practitioners of medicine throughout much of the world and across history. Principles of medical ethics are also respected by society as a whole, including scientists, governments, the private sector, and the military. After the Second World War, modern medical ethics were institutionalized by the Belmont Report, a document generated by the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research in the US (http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/index.html). This report proposed ethical principles and guidelines for research involving human subjects under three core principles: respect, beneficence, and justice. Issues such as informed consent, assessment of risks and benefits, and selection of subjects are dealt with in a practical fashion. The Belmont report is widely respected and constitutes the core set of values underlying modern medical practice. We think that the time is ripe for a similar set of principles, a Belmont report for neuroethics. These principles should offer guidelines for the effective protection of human subjects and values in conjunction with the ongoing research in this new area. But who should generate such a set of ethical and societal guidelines for the new technologies? Scientific experts who are developing these methods should be involved, given that they know better than anyone the current and likely future capabilities of the technologies. In addition, medical practitioners can contribute their experience interacting with patients seeking help for neurologically related disorders and people interested in assistive devices. Bioethicists, who work at the interface between ethical issues and biomedicine, are also clearly needed. Legal experts can provide important insights regarding human rights protections and approaches to the integration of these technologies in the legal codes of society. Finally, we think that representatives of the citizenship at large should also be involved, including of disabled people who are members of the likely early target populations for BCI and neuromodulation experiments designed to address impairments or offer assistive devices. The progress of science, while it should be freely pursued for curiosity’s sake as the best way of enhancing knowledge, should also be informed by the needs and circumstances of the society that, after all, funds and supports all scientific work (Kitcher, 2011Kitcher P. Science in a Democratic Society. Prometheus Books, 2011Google Scholar). Representatives of the citizens could also play a critical role in translating to the wider society the importance of these methods and discussions and the guidelines that are recommended. Given the amount of hype that abounds in the press and in science-fiction literature and movies, it is of great importance that citizens clearly understand, without any exaggeration, the potential benefits of these technologies, as well as their potential dystopian outcomes. To complement and sustain the work of these panels, we recommend robust funding of neuroethics in order to develop it further as a subfield of bioethics. This could enable a vigorous academic and societal debate regarding the meaning and consequences of this technology and ensure that the guidelines reflect the best ideas generated by the community. The current NIH BRAIN initiative program to fund neuroethics work (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-MH-16-014.html), together with the recent creation of a Neuroethics working group (https://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/about/newg.htm), is a good start but still small steps relative to the significance of the issues at hand. In closing, our aim here is not to contribute to or feed fear for doomsday scenarios but to ensure that we are reflective and intentional as we prepare ourselves for the neurotechnological future, which we believe can be a momentous positive change in our history. Indeed, novel neurotechnologies could serve as a liberating force for humankind. Humans have been defined by our tool making, and new technologies and the knowledge accumulated through them have enabled us to free ourselves from some of the tyrannies of prejudice and, in a way, of space and time. Scientific progress has enabled impressive opportunities for health and well-being, communication, and trade. Similar benefits probably lie ahead with the incorporation of novel neurotechnologies to our society. But these advances should be shared equitably, and a responsible society should aim to develop them in ways that are both broadly beneficial and sensitive to individual rights and needs. As we turn our impressive powers of investigation to the task of exploring and understanding the brain—the organ central to the physiological processes that make us who we are—we ought to think hard about the kinds of beings we might want to become and the kind of society we are building for our children. Public confidence in science should be anchored on responsible deployment of scientific advances. Technological advances must be shaped by our collective moral sensibilities in order to ensure that these advances are smoothly incorporated into our culture and indeed contribute to the common good."
https://openalex.org/W2547112756,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the independent associations between nausea, vomiting, fatigue and health-related quality of life of women in early pregnancy in the Generation R study, which is a prospective mother and child cohort. Analyses were based on 5079 women in early pregnancy in the Rotterdam area, the Netherlands. The information on nausea, vomiting and fatigue in the previous three months was measured in the questionnaire at enrollment, as well as potential confounders (i.e., maternal/gestational age, ethnic background, educational level, parity, marital status, body mass index, tobacco and alcohol use, chronic/infectious conditions, uro-genital conditions/symptoms, sleep quality, headache, anxiety, and depression). Health-related quality of life was assessed by the 12-item Short Form Health Survey and physical and mental component summary scores were calculated. Multivariate regression models were performed to evaluate the independent associations of the presence of nausea, vomiting and fatigue with health-related quality of life, adjusting for potential confounders. 33.6% of women experienced daily presence of nausea, 9.6% for vomiting and 44.4% for fatigue. Comparing with women who never reported nausea, vomiting and fatigue, women with daily presence of at least one of these symptoms had significantly lower scores of physical component summary and mental component summary, after adjusting for potential confounders. Our study shows how common nausea, vomiting and fatigue are among women in early pregnancy and how much each of these symptoms negatively impact on health-related quality of life. We call for awareness of this issue from health care professionals, pregnant women and their families."
https://openalex.org/W2548064717,"Wheat leaf non-sequential senescence at the late grain-filling stage involves the early senescence of younger flag leaves compared to that observed in older second leaves. On the other hand, sequential senescence involves leaf senescence that follows an age-related pattern, in which flag leaves are the latest to undergo senescence. The characteristics of sugar metabolism in two sequential senescence cultivars and two non-sequential senescence cultivars under both natural and drought conditions were studied to elucidate the underlying mechanism of drought tolerance in two different senescence modes. The results showed that compared to sequential senescence wheat cultivars, under natural and drought conditions, non-sequential senescence wheat cultivars showed a higher leaf net photosynthetic rate, higher soluble sugar levels in leaves, leaf sheaths, and internodes, higher leaf sucrose synthase (SS) and sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) activity, and higher grain SS activity, thereby suggesting that non-sequential senescence wheat cultivars had stronger source activity. Spike weight, grain weight per spike, and 100-grain weight of non-sequential senescence cultivars at maturity were significantly higher than those of sequential senescence cultivars under both natural and drought conditions. These findings indicate that the higher rate of accumulation and the higher mobilization of soluble sugar in the leaves, leaf sheaths and internodes of non-sequential senescence cultivars improve grain weight and drought tolerance. At the late grain-filling stage, drought conditions adversely affected leaf chlorophyll content, net photosynthetic rate, soluble sugar and sucrose content, SS and SPS activity, gain SS activity, and weight. This study showed that higher rates of soluble sugar accumulation in the source was one of the reasons of triggering leaf non-sequential senescence, and higher rates of soluble sugar mobilization during leaf non-sequential senescence promoted high and stable wheat yield and drought tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2548681684,"Rhizoctonia solani represents an important plant pathogenic Basidiomycota species complex and the host of many different mycoviruses, as indicated by frequent detection of dsRNA elements in natural populations of the fungus. To date, eight different mycoviruses have been characterized in Rhizoctonia and some of them have been reported to modulate its virulence. DsRNA extracts of the avirulent R. solani isolate DC17 (AG2-2-IV) displayed a diverse pattern, indicating multiple infections with mycoviruses. Deep sequencing analysis of the dsRNA extract, converted to cDNA, revealed that this isolate harbors at least 17 different mycovirus species. Based on the alignment of the conserved RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) domain, this viral community included putative members of the families Narnaviridae, Endornaviridae, Partitiviridae and Megabirnaviridae as well as of the order Tymovirales. Furthermore, viruses, which could not be assigned to any existing family or order, but showed similarities to so far unassigned species like Sclerotinia sclerotiorum RNA virus L, Rhizoctonia solani dsRNA virus 1, Aspergillus foetidus slow virus 2 or Rhizoctonia fumigata virus 1, were identified. This is the first report of a fungal isolate infected by 17 different viral species and a valuable study case to explore the diversity of mycoviruses infecting R. solani."
https://openalex.org/W2549027334,"In this study, we present a quadruple immunostaining method for rapid muscle fiber typing of mice and rats using antibodies specific to the adult myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms MyHC1, 2A, 2X, and 2B, which are common marker proteins of distinct muscle fiber types. We developed rat monoclonal antibodies specific to each MyHC isoform and conjugated these four antibodies to fluorophores with distinct excitation and emission wavelengths. By mixing the four types of conjugated antibodies, MyHC1, 2A, 2X, and 2B could be distinguished within a single specimen allowing for facile delineation of skeletal muscle fiber types. Furthermore, we could observe hybrid fibers expressing MyHC2X and MyHC2B together in single longitudinal muscle sections from mice and rats, that was not attained in previous techniques. This staining method is expected to be applied to study muscle fiber type transition in response to environmental factors, and to ultimately develop techniques to regulate animal muscle fiber types."
https://openalex.org/W2549134075,"John Storey, David Blei and colleagues present a method, TeraStructure, for estimating population structure from human genomic data sets on a scale not possible with current methods. TeraStructure is able to analyze data from the Human Genome Diversity Panel and the 1000 Genomes Project in less than three hours. A major goal of population genetics is to quantitatively understand variation of genetic polymorphisms among individuals. The aggregated number of genotyped humans is currently on the order of millions of individuals, and existing methods do not scale to data of this size. To solve this problem, we developed TeraStructure, an algorithm to fit Bayesian models of genetic variation in structured human populations on tera-sample-sized data sets (1012 observed genotypes; for example, 1 million individuals at 1 million SNPs). TeraStructure is a scalable approach to Bayesian inference in which subsamples of markers are used to update an estimate of the latent population structure among individuals. We demonstrate that TeraStructure performs as well as existing methods on current globally sampled data, and we show using simulations that TeraStructure continues to be accurate and is the only method that can scale to tera-sample sizes."
https://openalex.org/W2547465013,"Apelin, a (neuro)vasoactive peptide, plays a prominent role in controlling cardiovascular functions and water balance. Because the in vivo apelin half-life is in the minute range, we aimed to identify metabolically stable apelin-17 (K17F) analogs. We generated P92 by classic chemical substitutions and LIT01–196 by original addition of a fluorocarbon chain to the N terminus of K17F. Both analogs were much more stable in plasma (half-life >24 h for LIT01–196) than K17F (4.6 min). Analogs displayed a subnanomolar affinity for the apelin receptor and behaved as full agonists with regard to cAMP production, ERK phosphorylation, and apelin receptor internalization. Ex vivo, these compounds induced vasorelaxation of rat aortas and glomerular arterioles, respectively, precontracted with norepinephrine and angiotensin II, and increased cardiac contractility. In vivo, after intracerebroventricular administration in water-deprived mice, P92 and LIT01–196 were 6 and 160 times, respectively, more efficient at inhibiting systemic vasopressin release than K17F. Administered intravenously (nmol/kg range) in normotensive rats, these analogs potently increased urine output and induced a profound and sustained decrease in arterial blood pressure. In summary, these new compounds, which favor diuresis and improve cardiac contractility while reducing vascular resistances, represent promising candidates for the treatment of heart failure and water retention/ hyponatremic disorders.—Gerbier, R., Alvear-Perez, R., Margathe, J.-F., Flahault, A., Couvineau, P., Gao, J., De Mota, N., Dabire, H., Li, B., Ceraudo, E., Hus-Citharel, A., Esteoulle, L., Bisoo, C., Hibert, M., Berdeaux, A., Iturrioz, X., Bonnet, D., Llorens-Cortes, C.

https://openalex.org/W2548373020,"Laminin α2 is one of the constituent components of the basement membrane (BM) in adult rat testes. Earlier studies that used a mouse genetic model have shown that a deletion of laminin α2 impedes male fertility by disrupting ectoplasmic specialization (ES; a testis-specific, actin-rich anchoring junction) function along the length of Sertoli cell in the testis. This includes ES at the Sertoli cell-elongating/elongated spermatid interface, which is known as apical ES and possibly the Sertoli-Sertoli cell interface, known as basal ES, at the blood-testis barrier (BTB). Studies have also illustrated that there is a local regulatory axis that functionally links cellular events of spermiation that occur near the luminal edge of tubule lumen at the apical ES and the basal ES/BTB remodeling near the BM at opposite ends of the seminiferous epithelium during the epithelial cycle, known as the apical ES-BTB-BM axis. However, the precise role of BM in this axis remains unknown. Here, we show that laminin α2 in the BM serves as the crucial regulator in this axis as laminin α2, likely its 80-kDa fragment from the C terminus, was found to be transported across the seminiferous epithelium at stages VIII-IX of the epithelial cycle, from the BM to the luminal edge of the tubule, possibly being used to modulate apical ES restructuring at these stages. Of more importance, a knockdown of laminin α2 in Sertoli cells was shown to induce the Sertoli cell tight junction permeability barrier disruption via changes in localization of adhesion proteins at the tight junction and basal ES at the Sertoli cell BTB. These changes were found to be mediated by a disruption of F-actin organization that was induced by changes in the spatiotemporal expression of actin binding/regulatory proteins. Furthermore, laminin α2 knockdown also perturbed microtubule (MT) organization by considerable down-regulation of MT polymerization via changes in the spatiotemporal expression of EB1 (end-binding protein 1), a +TIP (MT plus-end tracking protein). In short, laminin α2 in the BM seems to play a crucial role in the BTB-BM axis by modulating BTB dynamics during spermatogenesis.-Gao, Y., Mruk, D., Chen, H., Lui, W.-Y., Lee, W. M., Cheng, C. Y.

https://openalex.org/W2547590999,"Hormone-sensitive acute steroid biosynthesis requires trafficking of cholesterol from intracellular sources to the inner mitochondrial membrane. The precise location of the intracellular cholesterol and its transport mechanism are uncertain. Perfringolysin O, produced by Clostridium perfringens, binds cholesterol. Its fourth domain (D4) retains cholesterol-binding properties but not cytotoxicity. We transfected steroidogenic MA-10 cells of mouse Leydig cell tumors with the mCherry-D4 plasmid. Tagged D4 with fluorescent proteins enabled us to track cholesterol. The staining was primarily localized to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane and was partially released upon treatment with dibutyryl-cAMP (Bt2cAMP), a cAMP analog. Inhibitors of cholesterol import into mitochondria blocked steroidogenesis and prevented release of D4 (and presumably cholesterol) from the plasma membrane. We conclude that the bulk of the steroidogenic pool of cholesterol, mobilized by Bt2cAMP for acute steroidogenesis, originates from the plasma membrane. Treatment of the cells with steroid metabolites, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and pregnenolone, also reduced D4 release from the plasma membrane, perhaps evidence for a feedback effect of elevated steroid formation on cholesterol release. Interestingly, D4 staining was localized to endosomes during Bt2cAMP stimulation suggesting that these organelles are on the route of cholesterol trafficking from the plasma membrane to mitochondria. Finally, D4 was expressed in primary rat Leydig cells with a lentivirus and was released from the plasma membrane following Bt2cAMP treatment. We conclude that the plasma membrane is the source of cholesterol for steroidogenesis in these cells as well as in MA-10 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2547483420,"The liquid streams in a microchannel are hardly mixed to form laminar flow, and the mixing issue is well described by a low Reynolds number scheme. The staggered herringbone mixer (SHM) using repeated patterns of grooves in the microchannel have been proved to be an efficient passive micro-mixer. However, only a negative pattern of the staggered herringbone mixer has been used so far after it was first suggested, to the best of our knowledge. In this study, the mixing efficiencies from negative and positive staggered herringbone mixer patterns as well as from opposite flow directions were tested to investigate the effect of the micro-structure geometry on the surrounding laminar flow. The positive herringbone pattern showed better mixing efficiency than the conventionally used negative pattern. Also, generally used forward flow gives better mixing efficiency than reverse flow. The mixing was completed after two cycles of staggered herringbone mixer with both forward and reverse flow in a positive pattern. The traditional negative pattern showed complete mixing after four and five cycles in forward and reverse flow direction, respectively. The mixing effect in all geometries was numerically simulated, and the results confirmed more efficient mixing in the positive pattern than the negative. The results can further enable the design of a more efficient microfluidic mixer, as well as in depth understanding of the phenomena of positive and negative patterns existing in nature with regards to the surrounding fluids."
https://openalex.org/W2548392462,"mtDNA damage in cardiac myocytes resulting from increased oxidative stress is emerging as an important factor in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy. A prevalent lesion that occurs in mtDNA damage is the formation of 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), which can cause mutations when not repaired properly by 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (Ogg1). Although the mtDNA repair machinery has been described in cardiac myocytes, the regulation of this repair has been incompletely investigated. Here we report that the hearts of type 1 diabetic mice, despite having increased Ogg1 protein levels, had significantly lower Ogg1 activity than the hearts of control, non-type 1 diabetic mice. In diabetic hearts, we further observed increased levels of 8-OHdG and an increased amount of mtDNA damage. Interestingly, Ogg1 was found to be highly O-GlcNAcylated in diabetic mice compared with controls. In vitro experiments demonstrated that O-GlcNAcylation inhibits Ogg1 activity, which could explain the mtDNA lesion accumulation observed in vivo. Reducing Ogg1 O-GlcNAcylation in vivo by introducing a dominant negative O-GlcNAc transferase mutant (F460A) restored Ogg1 enzymatic activity and, consequently, reduced 8-OHdG and mtDNA damage despite the adverse hyperglycemic milieu. Taken together, our results implicate hyperglycemia-induced O-GlcNAcylation of Ogg1 in increased mtDNA damage and, therefore, provide a new plausible biochemical mechanism for diabetic cardiomyopathy. mtDNA damage in cardiac myocytes resulting from increased oxidative stress is emerging as an important factor in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy.

In diabetes mellitus, inadequate glucose regulation and the resultant hyperglycemia are widely regarded as significant contributors to diabetic complications (1.Rolo A.P. Palmeira C.M.

Because diabetes is accompanied by increased free radical production and/or impaired antioxidant defense capabilities, excessive ROS production has been proposed as the link between high glucose and the pathways responsible for hyperglycemic damage in diabetes (1.Rolo A.P.

It does not contain introns and encodes 13 polypeptides for complexes I, III, IV, and V of the electron transport system as well as 22 tRNAs and two rRNAs (7.Falkenberg M. Larsson N.G.

Thus, any damage to mtDNA could potentially induce dysfunctional mitochondrial transcripts that could lead to reduced oxidative phosphorylation and decreased mitochondrial function (9.Ballinger S.W.

Another common posttranslational modification particularly relevant to diabetes occurs by O-linked N-acetylglucosamine addition (O-GlcNAcylation). O-GlcNAcylation of serine or threonine residues of nuclear, cytoplasmic, and mitochondrial proteins is a dynamic and ubiquitous protein modification (16.Kreppel L.K. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W.

Ogg1 O-GlcNAcylation is completely unexplored in either physiological or pathological conditions. Here we report that Ogg1 is highly O-GlcNAcylated in our type 1 diabetes (T1D) murine model and that reducing O-GlcNAcylation with a dominant negative mutant OGT restores Ogg1 activity, likely by competition for Ogg1 binding, which leads to improved mtDNA quality in T1D hearts. To study whether mtDNA is affectedby hyperglycemia-dependent oxidative stress, we compared 10-week diabetic (T1D) mice (glucose levels in the blood > 500 mg/dl) with control (CTR) mice (glucose levels in the blood < 150 mg/dl). Compared with CTR, we found significantly higher (10-fold) levels of 8-OHdG staining in T1D hearts (Fig. 1A). We then performed an assay to examine mtDNA damage and found a statistically significant increase with T1D. Fig. 1B shows that amplification of a 10-kb fragment from isolated mtDNA was selectively inhibited in T1D versus CTR, indicating that a higher number of lesions were present in mtDNA from diabetic hearts. In addition, we observed increased levels of cleaved caspase 3 in diabetic hearts (Fig. 1C), which indicates an increase in apoptosis. Ogg1 is a key enzyme in mtDNA repair (38.Mirbahai L. Kershaw R.M. Green R.M. Hayden R.E. Meldrum R.A. Hodges N.J. Use of a molecular beacon to track the activity of base excision repair protein OGG1 in live cells.DNA Repair. 2010; 9: 144-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The Ogg1 DNA glycosylase recognizes and hydrolyzes the modified base 8-OHdG, removing the mutagenic 8-OHdG lesion situated opposite cytosine, whereas MutY glycosylase removes adenine from 8-OHdG/A mismatches with its adenine glycosylase activity (39.Nakabeppu Y.

Because we detected increased 8-OHdG levels, which may result in the mtDNA damage registered in T1D hearts, we focused our investigation on determining whether Ogg1, and, thus, the dependent DNA repair process, was somehow affected. We assessed Ogg1 enzymatic activity using a specifically designed fluorescent molecular beacon carrying an oxidized guanosine residue in the stem portion of the molecule annealed to a cytosine residue and compared it with the protein level. We observed a 50% decrease in Ogg1 enzymatic activity in T1D murine heart lysates compared with CTR (Fig. 1D); however, Ogg1 protein levels (detected as a 45-kDa protein) were found to be increased (Fig. 1E). High levels of protein O-GlcNAcylation have been associated with hyperglycemia (32.Hu Y. Suarez J. Fricovsky E. Wang H. Scott B.T. Trauger S.A. Han W. Hu Y. Oyeleye M.O. Dillmann W.H.

We found that OGT (Fig. 1F) and OGA (Fig. 1G) protein levels were increased and decreased, respectively, in T1D versus CTR hearts; therefore, we checked whether Ogg1 was differently O-GlcNAcylated. Fig. 1H shows that increased Ogg1 O-GlcNAcylation was detected in T1D versus CTR. Next we investigated whether Ogg1 activity was affected by O-GlcNAcylation. We expressed and purified a 40-kDa FLAG-tagged Ogg1 and a 120-kDa OGT from HEK 293T cells and a 130-kDa His-tagged OGA from “Rosetta” Escherichia coli (Fig. 2, A–C). In vitro O-GlcNAcylation of Ogg1 was performed by incubating eluted FLAG-Ogg1 and FLAG-OGT at 37 °C in OGT assay buffer in the presence of 50 μm UDP-GlcNAc. Ogg1 activity was then assayed every 30 min by taking 50 μl from the reaction mixture. The data reported in Fig. 2D show an ∼50% decrease in Ogg1 activity after 30 min from the start of the O-GlcNAcylation reaction. We observed no further inhibition at the 90- and 210-min time points, suggesting that OGT activity was sufficient to saturate Ogg1 O-GlcNAcylation sites in the first 30 min. We then introduced recombinant His-OGA, in excess with respect to OGT (0.2 mg/ml versus 0.1 mg/ml), and, after 60 min, we found complete restoration of basal Ogg1 activity. Aliquots of the reaction mixture taken at 0, 210, and 270 min were used to detect the O-GlcNAcylation status of Ogg1. Samples were Ogg1-immunoprecipitated, and Western blots (WB) with anti-O-GlcNAc (RL2), anti-FLAG, or anti-Ogg1 were performed. Fig. 2E shows an increased, ∼40-kDa Ogg1-specific protein O-GlcNAcylation signal (measured with the RL2 antibody) at 210 min compared with 0 min and a decreased signal at 270 min compared with 210 min, suggesting that the observed inhibition of Ogg1 activity was due to the increased O-GlcNAcylation mediated by OGT and that de-O-GlcNAcylating Ogg1 with OGA restored the basal activity. Interestingly, both anti-FLAG and anti-Ogg1 WB show lower Ogg1 levels in the immunoprecipitated sample at 210 min, suggesting that O-GlcNAcylation altered Ogg1 interaction with the Ogg1-specific IgG. As a control, WB analysis of non-Ogg1-precipitated aliquots of reaction mixture showed OGT and Ogg1 at equal levels throughout the experiment and OGA presence only after 210 min of the in vitro O-GlcNAc reaction (Fig. 2F). To test methods to reduce Ogg1 O-GlcNAcylation, we used an ex vivo model where NCM primary cultures were exposed to high glucose levels (HG = 25 mm) for 72 h to mimic diabetes-associated hyperglycemia. As in T1D, 8-OHdG levels were significantly increased in HG versus cells cultured with normal glucose levels (NG = 5.5 mm glucose + 19.5 mm mannitol) (Fig. 3A). 8-OHdG also co-localized with the mitochondrial import receptor (TOM20), indicating that the observed DNA oxidation was primarily extranuclear. We then visualized Ogg1 by IF and again observed predominantly extranuclear localization based on closely overlapping signals from Ogg1 and from the mitochondrial marker complex 3 IF (Fig. 3B). Ogg1 localization and in situ activity were examined by visualizing an 8-OHdG-containing mo"
https://openalex.org/W2548138149,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating illness characterized by a progressive loss of cognitive, social, and emotional functions, including memory impairments and more global cognitive deficits. Clinical-epidemiological evidence suggests that neuropsychiatric symptoms precede the onset of cognitive symptoms both in humans with early and late onset AD. The behavioural profile promoted by the AD pathology is believed to associate with degeneration of the serotonergic system. Using the APPswe/PS1δE9 model of AD-like pathology starting with 9 months old mice, we characterised long term non-cognitive behavioural changes measured at 9, 12, 15, and 18 months of age and applied principal component analysis on data obtained from open field, elevated plus maze, and social interaction tests. Long-term treatment with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) paroxetine was applied to assess the role of 5-HT on the behavioural profile; duration of treatment was 9 months, initiated when mice were 9 months of age. Treatment with paroxetine delays the decline in locomotion, in exploration and risk assessment behaviour, found in the APP/PS1 mice. APP/PS1 mice also exhibit low social activity and less aggressiveness, both of which are not affected by treatment with paroxetine. The APP/PS1 behavioural phenotype, demonstrated in this study, only begins to manifest itself from 12 months of age. Our results indicate that treatment with SSRI might ameliorate some of the behavioural deficits found in aged APP/PS1 mice."

The standard use of cell lines as in vitro pre-clinical models to study the molecular mechanisms that drive tumorigenesis and access drug sensitivity/effectiveness is of undisputable importance. Label-free mass spectrometry and bioinformatics were employed to study the proteomic profiles of two representative lung cancer cell lines and to unravel the specific biological processes. Adenocarcinoma A549 cells were enriched in proteins related to cellular respiration, ubiquitination, apoptosis and response to drug/hypoxia/oxidative stress. In turn, squamous carcinoma SW900 cells were enriched in proteins related to translation, apoptosis, response to inorganic/organic substances and cytoskeleton organization. Several proteins with differential expression were related to cancer transformation, tumor resistance, proliferation, migration, invasion and metastasis. Combined analysis of proteome and interactome data highlighted key proteins and suggested that adenocarcinoma might be more prone to PI3K/Akt/mTOR and topoisomerase IIα inhibitors, and squamous carcinoma to Ck2 inhibitors. Moreover, ILF3 overexpression in adenocarcinoma, and PCNA and NEDD8 in squamous carcinoma shows them as promising candidates for therapeutic purposes. This study highlights the functional proteomic differences of two main subtypes of lung cancer models and hints several targeted therapies that might assist in this type of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2547741754,"IQ motif-containing GTPase activating protein 1 (IQGAP1) plays a central role in the physical assembly of relevant signaling networks that are responsible for various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, polarity, and transmigration. The RHO family proteins CDC42 and RAC1 have been shown to mainly interact with the GAP-related domain (GRD) of IQGAP1. However, the role of its RASGAP C-terminal (RGCT) and C-terminal domains in the interactions with RHO proteins has remained obscure. Here, we demonstrate that IQGAP1 interactions with RHO proteins underlie a multiple-step binding mechanism: (i) a high affinity, GTP-dependent binding of RGCT to the switch regions of CDC42 or RAC1 and (ii) a very low affinity binding of GRD and a C terminus adjacent to the switch regions. These data were confirmed by phosphomimetic mutation of serine 1443 to glutamate within RGCT, which led to a significant reduction of IQGAP1 affinity for CDC42 and RAC1, clearly disclosing the critical role of RGCT for these interactions. Unlike CDC42, an extremely low affinity was determined for the RAC1-GRD interaction, suggesting that the molecular nature of IQGAP1 interaction with CDC42 partially differs from that of RAC1. Our study provides new insights into the interaction characteristics of IQGAP1 with RHO family proteins and highlights the complementary importance of kinetic and equilibrium analyses. We propose that the ability of IQGAP1 to interact with RHO proteins is based on a multiple-step binding process, which is a prerequisite for the dynamic functions of IQGAP1 as a scaffolding protein and a critical mechanism in temporal regulation and integration of IQGAP1-mediated cellular responses."

https://openalex.org/W2548597549,"In recent years, there has been a significant increase in detection of Enterovirus D-68 (EV-D68) among patients with severe respiratory infections worldwide. EV-D68 is now recognized as a re-emerging pathogen; however, due to lack of a permissive animal model for EV-D68, a comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis and immune response against EV-D68 has been hampered. Recently, it was shown that EV-D68 has a strong affinity for α2,6-linked sialic acids (SAs) and we have shown previously that α2,6-linked SAs are abundantly present in the respiratory tract of cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus). Thus, we hypothesized that cotton rats could be a potential model for EV-D68 infection. Here, we evaluated the ability of two recently isolated EV-D68 strains (VANBT/1 and MO/14/49), along with the historical prototype Fermon strain (ATCC), to infect cotton rats. We found that cotton rats are permissive to EV-D68 infection without virus adaptation. The different strains of EV-D68 showed variable infection profiles and the ability to produce neutralizing antibody (NA) upon intranasal infection or intramuscular immunization. Infection with the VANBT/1 resulted in significant induction of pulmonary cytokine gene expression and lung pathology. Intramuscular immunization with live VANBT/1 or MO/14/49 induced strong homologous antibody responses, but a moderate heterologous NA response. We showed that passive prophylactic administration of serum with high content of NA against VANBT/1 resulted in an efficient antiviral therapy. VANBT/1-immunized animals showed complete protection from VANBT/1 challenge, but induced strong pulmonary Th1 and Th2 cytokine responses and enhanced lung pathology, indicating the generation of exacerbated immune response by immunization. In conclusion, our data illustrate that the cotton rat is a powerful animal model that provides an experimental platform to investigate pathogenesis, immune response, anti-viral therapies and vaccines against EV-D68 infection."

We show that the arrhythmia-associated CaM mutants support growth and viability of DT40 cells in the absence of WT CaM except for the long QT syndrome mutant CaM D129G. Of the six CaM mutants tested (N53I, F89L, D95V, N97S, D129G, and F141L), three showed a decreased activation of Ca2+/CaM-dependent kinase II, most prominently the D129G CaM mutation, which was incapable of stimulating Thr286 autophosphorylation.

https://openalex.org/W2548329900,"SAMHD1 (sterile α motif and HD domain-containing protein 1) is a mammalian protein that regulates intracellular dNTP levels through its hydrolysis of dNTPs. SAMHD1 functions as an important retroviral restriction factor through a mechanism relying on its dNTPase activity. We and others have reported that human SAMHD1 interacts with the cell cycle regulatory proteins cyclin A, CDK1, and CDK2, which mediates phosphorylation of SAMHD1 at threonine 592, a post-translational modification that has been implicated in abrogating SAMHD1 restriction function and ability to form stable tetramers. Utilizing co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization approaches, we show that endogenous SAMHD1 is able to interact with the cyclin A-CDK1-CDK2 complexin monocytic THP-1 cells and primary monocyte-derived macrophages. Sequence analysis of SAMHD1 identifies a putative cyclin-binding motif found in many cyclin-CDK complex substrates. Using a mutagenesis-based approach, we demonstrate that the conserved residues in the putative cyclin-binding motif are important for protein expression, protein half-life, and optimal phosphorylation of SAMHD1 at Thr592. Furthermore, we observed that SAMHD1 mutants of the cyclin-binding motif mislocalized to a nuclear compartment and had reduced ability to interact with cyclin A-CDK complexes and to form the tetramer. These findings help define the mechanisms by which SAMHD1 is phosphorylated and suggest the contribution of cyclin binding to SAMHD1 expression and stability in dividing cells."
https://openalex.org/W2546929642,"Complement factor H-related protein 1 (CFHR1) is a complement regulator which has been reported to regulate complement by blocking C5 convertase activity and interfering with C5b surface association. CFHR1 also competes with complement factor H (CFH) for binding to C3b, and may act as an antagonist of CFH-directed regulation on cell surfaces. We have employed site-directed mutagenesis in conjunction with ELISA-based and functional assays to isolate the binding interaction that CFHR1 undertakes with complement components C3b and C3d to a single shared interface. The C3b/C3d:CFHR1 interface is identical to that which occurs between the two C-terminal domains (SCR19-20) of CFH and C3b. Moreover, we have been able to corroborate that dimerization of CFHR1 is necessary for this molecule to bind effectively to C3b and C3d, or compete with CFH. Finally, we have established that CFHR1 competes with complement factor H-like protein 1 (CFHL-1) for binding to C3b. CFHL-1 is a CFH gene splice variant, which is almost identical to the N-terminal 7 domains of CFH (SCR1-7). CFHR1, therefore, not only competes with the C-terminus of CFH for binding to C3b, but also sterically blocks the interaction that the N-terminus of CFH undertakes with C3b, and which is required for CFH-regulation."

Negative cooperativity occurs in human glutathione transferase (GST) GSTP1-1 when it binds and neutralizes a toxic nitric oxide adduct, the dinitrosyl-diglutathionyl iron complex (DNDGIC). However, the generality of this behavior across the divergent GST family and its evolutionary significance were unclear. To investigate, we studied 16 different GSTs, revealing that negative cooperativity is present only in more recently evolved GSTs, indicating evolutionary drift in this direction. In some variants, Hill coefficients were close to 0.5, the highest degree of negative cooperativity commonly observed (although smaller values of nH are theoretically possible). As DNDGIC is also a strong inhibitor of GSTs, we suggest negative cooperativity might have evolved to maintain a residual conjugating activity of GST against toxins even in the presence of high DNDGIC concentrations. Interestingly, two human isoenzymes that play a special protective role, safeguarding DNA from DNDGIC, display a classical half-of-the-sites interaction. Analysis of GST structures identified elements that could play a role in negative cooperativity in GSTs. Beside the well known lock-and-key and clasp motifs, other alternative structural interactions between subunits may be proposed for a few GSTs.

https://openalex.org/W2548346609,"Free listing is a methodological tool that is widely used in various scientific disciplines. A typical assumption of this approach is that individual lists reflect a subset of total knowledge and that the first items listed are the most culturally important. However, little is known about how cognitive processes influence free lists. In this study, we assess how recent memory of use, autonoetic and anoetic memory, and long-term associative memory can affect the composition and order of items in free lists and evaluate whether free lists indicate the most important items. Based on a model of local knowledge about medicinal plants and their therapeutic targets, which was collected via individual semi-structured interviews, we classify each item recorded in free lists according to the last time that the item was used by the informant (recently or long ago), the type of relevant memory (autonoetic or anoetic memory) and the existing associations between therapeutic targets (similar or random). We find that individuals have a tendency to recall information about medicinal plants used during the preceding year and that the recalled plants were also the most important plants during this period. However, we find no trend in the recall of plants from long-term associative memory, although this phenomenon is well established in studies on cognitive psychology. We suggest that such evidence should be considered in studies that use lists of medicinal plants because this temporal cognitive limit on the retrieval of knowledge affects data interpretation."

IL-2 expression is blocked in naive, but not activated or memory, Th cells by the transcription factor Ets-2 that binds to the antigen receptor response element (ARRE)-2 of the proximal IL-2 promoter. Ets-2 acts as an independent preinduction repressor in naive Th cells and does not interact physically with the transcription factor NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells) that binds to the ARRE-2 in activated Th cells. In naive Th cells, Ets-2 mRNA expression, Ets-2 protein levels, and Ets-2 binding to ARRE-2 decrease upon cell activation followed by the concomitant expression of IL-2. Cyclosporine A stabilizes Ets-2 mRNA and protein when the cells are activated. Ets-2 silences directly constitutive or induced IL-2 expression through the ARRE-2. Conversely, Ets-2 silencing allows for constitutive IL-2 expression in unstimulated cells. Ets-2 binding to ARRE-2 in chromatin is stronger in naive compared with activated or memory Th cells; in the latter, Ets-2 participates in a change of the IL-2 promoter architecture, possibly to facilitate a quick response when the cells re-encounter antigen. We propose that Ets-2 expression and protein binding to the ARRE-2 of the IL-2 promoter are part of a strictly regulated process that results in a physiological transition of naive Th cells to Th0 cells upon antigenic stimulation. Malfunction of such a repression mechanism at the molecular level could lead to a disturbance of later events in Th cell plasticity, leading to autoimmune diseases or other pathological conditions.

Ets-2 binding to ARRE-2 in chromatin is stronger in naive compared with activated or memory Th cells; in the latter, Ets-2 participates in a change of the IL-2 promoter architecture, possibly to facilitate a quick response when the cells re-encounter antigen. We propose that Ets-2 expression and protein binding to the ARRE-2 of the IL-2 promoter are part of a strictly regulated process that results in a physiological transition of naive Th cells to Th0 cells upon antigenic stimulation. Malfunction of such a repression mechanism at the molecular level could lead to a disturbance of later events in Th cell plasticity, leading to autoimmune diseases or other pathological conditions.

Malfunctions of their existence, activation, and/or function lead to autoimmune diseases or to the inability of the organism to combat infectious diseases or deal with other pathological conditions. The special functions that Th cells exert presume their previous activation, which begins with the engagement of the T-cell receptor (TCR) (1.Smith-Garvin J.E. Koretzky G.A. Jordan M.S. T cell activation.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 591-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar). TCR-mediated stimulation and the cytokine environment where cell activation takes place influence the fate decisions of Th cells toward different Th cell lineages at the early stages of activation (2.Yamane H. Paul W.E. Early signaling events that underlie fate decisions of naive CD4+ T cells toward distinct T-helper cell subsets.Immunol. Rev. 2013; 252: 12-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Stimulation of TCR induces a complex downstream cascade of events in Th cells, including the activation, nuclear translocation, and coordinated function of a defined set of transcription factors, including NFAT, AP-1, Oct-1, and NF-κB (1.Smith-Garvin J.E.

Transcriptional control of T-cell development.Int. Immunol. 2011; 23: 661-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). IL-2 is the first cytokine produced when naive Th cells are activated and differentiate into proliferating pre-Th0 precursors (4.Travers P. Janeway C.A. Walport M. Shlomchik M.J. Immunobiology: the Immune System in Health and Disease. Garland Publishing, New York2001: 323Google Scholar). Precise regulation of IL-2 expression is of great importance because it promotes peripheral naive Th cells to enter the S phase and divide (5.Firpo E.J. Koff A. Solomon M.J. Roberts J.M. Inactivation of a Cdk2 inhibitor during interleukin 2-induced proliferation of human T lymphocytes.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4889-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Positive and negative regulation of IL-2 gene expression requires a relatively small segment of DNA, ∼300 bp, localized immediately upstream from the transcriptional start site integrating the positive and negative action of a number of different transcriptional regulators (6.Serfling E.

Control of interleukin-2 gene transcription: a paradigm for inducible, tissue-specific gene expression.Vitam. Horm. 2006; 74: 105-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Previous studies have provided significant information regarding the activation of the IL-2 gene; nevertheless, less is known about IL-2 gene repression mechanisms. IL-2 gene repression occurs at two stages, the preinduction and the postinduction, i.e. when T-cells are in the resting state and after TCR signaling when a feedback inhibition of cell activation takes place to cease the expression of IL-2 gene and terminate T-cell activation (7.Bunting K.

These known negative regulators of IL-2 expression act either directly by binding to the IL-2 promoter or indirectly to repress IL-2 transcription (7.Bunting K. Wang J. Shannon M.F.

The yins of T cell activation.Sci. STKE. 2005; 2005: re1PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously identified an IL-2 promoter protein binding activity, present in nuclear extracts prepared from naive Th cells isolated from cord blood or adult peripheral blood but not from activated or memory Th cells, capable of repressing IL-2 gene expression (9.Mouzaki A. Weil R. Muster L. Rungger D.

Properties of transcription factors regulating interleukin-2 gene transcription through the NFAT binding site in untreated or drug-treated naive and memory T-helper cells.Blood. 1994; 84: 2612-2621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This repressor activity is exerted through the distal IL-2 purine-rich response element (PU-d) or antigen receptor response element (ARRE)-2 (−292 to −273), which is also an NFAT binding site in activated Th cells. Following naive Th cell activation, the repressor activity disappears and is replaced by a newly synthesized activator (9.Mouzaki A. Weil R. Muster L. Rungger D.

These observations are consistent with a model where repressors bound to the IL-2 promoter during the preinduction state are replaced by activators during Th cell induction. Importantly, the preinduction repressors appear to be different from the repressors involved in turning off IL-2 transcription postinduction. A search in public gene expression databases for DNA-binding proteins with the properties of the putative IL-2 repressor revealed that the ets-2 oncogene is a strong candidate as a repressor of IL-2 transcription in naive Th lymphocytes (12.Argyropoulos C.

Ets-2 is a member of the ETS family of transcription factors that bind to purine-rich DNA sequences with GGA(A/T) as a central core consensus through a highly conserved DNA binding domain (13.Oikawa T.

Genomic and biochemical insights into the specificity of ETS transcription factors.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2011; 80: 437-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Ets proteins function as activators or repressors of transcription in partnership with other DNA-binding proteins and coregulators and control the expression of genes involved in diverse biological functions, such as mitosis, growth, development, differentiation, apoptosis, and regulation of immunity (13.Oikawa T.

Ets-2 plays an important role in the maturation, proliferation, and survival of mouse thymocytes, possibly by regulating the expression of c-Myc (23.Zaldumbide A. Carlotti F. Pognonec P.

In Th2 cells, Ets-2 together with Ets-1 is responsible for the activation of IL-5 transcription (24.Blumenthal S.G. Aichele G. Wirth T. Czernilofsky A.P. Nordheim A. Dittmer J.

The role of Ets-2 in regulating the expression of the IL-2 gene remains elusive because its core DNA binding motif GGAA exists in both the ARRE-2 and ARRE-1 of the IL-2 promoter (6.Serfling E.

Med. 2000; 6: 377-390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ARRE-1 is involved in the transcriptional activation of IL-2, and it is also bound by NFAT. In addition, there is no known connection among the biological function of Ets-2, IL-2 transcription, and the differentiation status of Th cells. In this work, we show that Ets-2 acts as a preinduction repressor of IL-2 transcription in naive Th cells and describe its properties. We aim to show that Ets-2 expression and protein binding to the ARRE-2 of the IL-2 promoter are part of a strictly regulated process that results in a physiological transition of naive Th cells to Th0 cells upon antigenic stimulation. To investigate the role of Ets-2 in IL-2 transcription, we determined the levels of Ets-2 mRNA by real time PCR in PBMCs and different populations thereof isolated from healthy young adults (Fig. 1A, upper panel). Ets-2 mRNA was expressed in PBMCs ex vivo or when cultured in plain culture medium (CM) at similar levels, and its expression was slightly decreased when PBMCs were activated with the mitogens phorbol myristate acetate and ionomycin (P/I) (Fig. 1A, PBMC). Ex vivo CD14+ monocytes expressed Ets-2 mRNA at levels similar to ex vivo PBMCs, and its expression was increased when cultured ±P/I (Fig. 1A, CD14). CD19+ B-cells expressed low amounts of Ets-2 mRNA regardless of their activation status (Fig. 1A, CD19). Finally, CD3+ T-cells expressed high levels of Ets-2 mRNA that were significantly decreased following P/I stimulation (Fig. 1A, CD3). In parallel, we analyzed IL-2 expression (Fig. 1A, lower panel) and discovered a negative correlation between Ets-2 and IL-2 expression in T-cells because elevated levels of IL-2 mRNA during mitogenic activation coincided with diminished amounts of Ets-2 mRNA. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that Ets-2 expression is differentially regulated in the various PBMC populations with T-cells showing a negative correlation between Ets-2 and IL-2 expression. To assess the levels of Ets-2 expression in distinct T-cell populations, we determined the levels of Ets-2 mRNA in ex vivo isolated T-cell populations: Ets-2 was expressed in all T-cell populations at various levels (Fig. 1B). There was a significant difference in Ets-2 mRNA levels between naive (CD4+CD45RA+CD25−) (Fig. 1B, CD4CD45RA) and memory (CD4+CD45RO+CD25−) (Fig. 1B, CD4CD45RO) Th cells with naive cells expressing Ets-2 at a significantly higher level. By comparison, cytotoxic CD3+CD8+CD25− T-cells (Fig. 1B, CD8) expressed the lowest levels of Ets-2, whereas CD4+CD25+ Tregs (Fig. 1B, CD25) expressed Ets-2 at levels similar to CD3+CD4+CD25− Th (Fig. 1B, CD4) and memory Th cells. As expected, none of the ex vivo T-cell populations expressed IL-2 (Fig. 1C). To correlate Ets-2 mRNA synthesis with Ets-2 protein DNA binding activity, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) using nuclear extracts prepared from PBMC-derived T-cells, monocytes, B-cells, and naive and memory Th cells using the IL-2 ARRE-2 as a probe (Fig. 1D). The results show a strong DNA binding activity when extracts from T-cells or naive Th cells were used, whereas protein extracts prepared from memory Th cells, B-cells, or monocytes had no binding activity to ARRE-2. To test for specificity of binding activity to the ARRE-2, we performed competition assays mixing naive Th cell extracts with a 5-, 20-, or 50-fold excess of unlabeled ARRE-2 oligonucleotides. The resulting EMSA demonstrated that even at 5-fold excess of unlabeled ARRE-2 the binding activity to the probe was competed (Fig. 1D, right panel). To verify Ets-2 protein binding to ARRE-2, we performed EMSA with Ets-2-depleted extracts from naive Th cells and demonstrated diminished binding activity (Fig. 1D, middle panel, Ets-2 Depletion). In addition, we performed EMSA with purified Ets-2 extracts isolated from peripheral blood T-cells. The protein extracts were passed through an Ets-2 antibody-binding column, and EMSAs were performed using the ARRE-2 probe mixed with consecutive protein eluates. As shown in Fig. 1E, Ets-2 protein bound to the ARRE-2 in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, Ets-2 expression correlates with DNA binding at the ARRE-2 promoter element. Naive Th cells and Tregs, as a control, were isolated from cord blood-derived T-cells by negative and positive selection respectively. Naive Th cells were tested for their purity by flow cytometry (Fig. 2C, left panel) and were subsequently cultured ±PI ±CsA for 4 or 12 h. The levels of Ets-2, Foxp3, and IL-2 mRNA were determined by real time PCR. Ets-2 mRNA levels in naive Th cells were reduced to 31.1% at 4 h and 21.1% expression at 12 h after P/I stimulation compared with CM (−CsA) (Fig. 2A). Inversely, IL-2 mRNA was highly expressed in naive Th cells after P/I stimulation (Fig. 2A). The addition of CsA blocked IL-2 expression in naive Th cells and led to a reduction of the Ets-2 mRNA to 47.8 and 48.9% of the level of expression at 4 and 12 h after P/I activation, respectively, compared with CM (−CsA) (Fig. 2A). The same experiments were performed with memory Th cells and Tregs, as a control, isolated from adult PBMCs by negative and positive selection, respectively. Memory Th cells were tested for their purity by flow cytometry (Fig. 2C, right panel) and were subsequently cultured ±PI ±CsA for either 4 or 12 h. The levels of Ets-2, Foxp3, and IL-2 mRNA were determined by real time PCR analysis, which revealed distinct patterns of Ets-2 mRNA expression in memory versus naive Th cells: Ets-2 mRNA expression was ×4.7-fold lower in memory Th cells compared with naive Th cells (Fig. 2A, CM). Mitogenic stimulation of memory Th cells for 4 and 12 h induced the expression of Ets-2 mRNA ×1.5- and ×1.6-fold, respectively, compared with Ets-2 mRNA levels in unstimulated (CM) memory Th cells, whereas IL-2 mRNA was expressed normally. In contrast, mitogenic activation in the presence of CsA blocked IL-2 expression without affecting significantly Ets-2 mRNA expression (Fig. 2A). Foxp3 was not expressed in either naive or memory Th cells under any of the culture conditions tested (Fig. 2A), whereas it was expressed in cord blood or PBMC-derived Tregs (Fig. 2A). Because Foxp3 is a known repressor of IL-2 expression in Tregs, acting through binding to the ARRE-2 and ARRE-1 of the IL-2 promoter (NFAT binding sites) (26.Marson A. Kretschmer K. Frampton G.M. Jacobsen E.S. Polansky J.K. MacIsaac K.D. Levine S.S. Fraenkel E. von Boehmer H. Young R.A. Foxp3 occupancy and regulation of key target genes during T-cell stimulation.Nature. 2007; 445: 931-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), our results demonstrate that Ets-2 is a different suppressor of IL-2 expression from Foxp3 with the two factors acting in different types of Th cells. To note, Tregs expressed Ets-2 mRNA at different levels: adult PBMC-derived Tregs expressed 3× less Ets-2 mRNA than cord blood-derived Tregs (Fig. 2A). Western blotting analysis (Fig. 2B) demonstrated that the changes in the quantity of the Ets-2 protein correlated with the changes in Ets-2 mRNA expression and the effect of CsA thereof, thus suggesting that regulation of Ets-2 expression in naive and memory Th cells occurs at the transcriptional level. To study further the relationship between Ets-2 and IL-2 gene expression, we performed a time course analysis. Cord blood-derived naive Th cells were activated with P/I for a time period spanning 16 h, and the relative levels of Ets-2 and IL-2 mRNA were determined by real time PCR (Fig. 2D). The results showed that Ets-2 mRNA levels began to decline at 2 h postactivation to reach minimum levels at 14 h, whereas IL-2 mRNA was evident at 2 h postactivation and increased steadily over the 16-h culture period; i.e. Ets-2 mRNA gene expression in naive Th cells correlated negatively with IL-2 mRNA gene expression (r = −0.9833) (Fig. 2E). Taken together, these results suggest that IL-2 and Ets-2 are differentially regulated in naive and memory Th cells in that only in naive Th cells does a high level of Ets-2 expression coincide with the transcriptional repression of IL-2, and IL-2 activation coincides with the disappearance of Ets-2 mRNA and protein. To assess the direct role of Ets-2 on the transcriptional activity of the IL-2 promoter, we transfected Jurkat T-cells with an Ets-2-expressing vector (pcDNA3-ets-2) and determined the levels of IL-2 mRNA expression after P/I activation in the presence or absence of CsA. Jurkat cells were chosen because they express high levels of IL-2 after P/I stimulation, and this activation is inhibited by CsA (27.Emmel E.A. Verweij C.L. Durand D.B. Higgins K.M. Lacy E. Crabtree G.R. Cyclosporin A specifically inhibits function of nuclear proteins involved in T cell activation.Science. 1989; 246: 1617-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). Jurkat cells express Ets-2 mRNA in CM, and after 4 h of mitogenic stimulation Ets-2 mRNA and protein levels begin to decrease (Fig. 3, A and B, −CsA). Furthermore, CsA stabilizes Ets-2 mRNA and protein in Jurkat cells (Fig. 3, A and B, +CsA). Thus, as is the case for naive Th cells, a negative correlation exists between Ets-2 mRNA/protein levels and IL-2 mRNA expression in Jurkat cells. Fig. 3C shows that expression of increasing amounts of Ets-2 caused a gradual decrease of the P/I-induced activation of the endogenous IL-2 expression. This decrease continued at a standard rate as the amount of overproduced Ets-2 increased, reaching a 60% drop when the maximum amount of the pcDNA3-ets-2 plasmid was used for transfection. Overexpression of the Ets-2 protein was verified by Western blotting (Fig. 3D). To investigate whether silencing of the Ets-2 factor per se results in constitutive IL-2 gene expression, we transfected Jurkat cells with lentivirus vectors containing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) clones to silence the endogenous Ets-2 mRNA. The cells were cultured ±P/I for 6 h. Reduction of the Ets-2 protein was verified by Western blotting analysis (Fig. 3F), and IL-2 mRNA expression was assayed by real time PCR. The results (Fig. 3E) show that when Ets-2 expression is inhibited in unstimulated Jurkat cells, i.e. in the absence of functional NFAT (CM + ets-2 shRNA), low expression of IL-2 mRNA ensues, confirming that Ets-2 acts as an independent repressor of IL-2 expression. Conversely, in P/I-stimulated Jurkat cells, the reduction of Ets-2 expression by shRNAs does not affect IL-2 expression. Taken together, these data confirm the negative causality between Ets-2 and IL-2 expression and that Ets-2 acts as a preinduction repressor of IL-2 transcription. Because the putative repressor of IL-2 expression works through the ARRE-2 of the IL-2 promoter, we next sought to determine whether Ets-2 represses IL-2 transcription via the ARRE-2. To this end, we cotransfected P/I-stimulated Jurkat cells with increasing amounts of the pcDNA3-ets-2 expression vector together with (i) a CAT reporter plasmid bearing the human proximal IL-2 promoter (−300/+1), (ii) a CAT reporter plasmid bearing the human proximal IL-2 promoter (−300/+1) with a mutation in the ARRE-2 (the GGAA Ets-2 binding site was changed to CTAA), (iii) a CAT reporter bearing four copies of the ARRE-2, (iv) a CAT reporter bearing four mutant copies of the ARRE-2, or (v) a CMV-CAT plasmid as a control. The results (Fig. 4) show that high level expression of Ets-2 resulted in a significant reduction of expression of both the IL-2-CAT (Fig. 4A) and 4xARRE-CAT (Fig. 4C) reporters in a dose-dependent manner but had no effect on the expression of IL-2-CAT reporter with the mutated ARRE-2 (Fig. 4B), 4xmutantARRE-CAT (Fig. 4D), and CMV-CAT (Fig. 4E). The above results are in accordance with the EMSA results depicted in Fig. 1, D and E, and show that the repression of the IL-2 gene expression is mediated through the binding of the Ets-2 protein to the ARRE-2 promoter element. To test whether Ets-2 alone can repress IL-2 expression, i.e. in a non-T-cell environment, we searched for cell lines that express IL-2 mRNA constitutively and investigated whether overexpression of Ets-2 reduces their IL-2 mRNA levels. We found that the leukemic cell lines U266, RPMI 1788, Sultan, THP1, IM9, U937, Raji, and multiple myeloma (MM) cells express the endogenous Ets-2 and IL-2 genes at varied levels with MM and THP1 cells showing the highest constitutive expression of Ets-2 and Raji cells showing the highest constitutive expression for IL-2 (Fig. 5A). Raji cells were chosen to assess whether overexpression of Ets-2 protein can down-regulate IL-2 expression levels. To this end, they were transfected with increasing amounts of the Ets-2 expression vector pcDNA3-ets-2, and the levels of the endogenous IL-2 mRNA were determined by real time PCR. The levels of overexpressed Ets-2 were determined by Western blotting (Fig. 5C). The results show that overexpression of Ets-2 in Raji cells blocks the synthesis of endogenous IL-2 mRNA (Fig. 5B). Therefore, Ets-2 can also act as a repressor of IL-2 expression in a heterologous system, such as the B-cell line Raji, suggesting that it is a general repressor of IL-2 expression. To assay the physiological interactions between Ets-2 and IL-2 promoter in vivo, we performed ChIP analysis using chromatin prepared from Jurkat cells, cord blood-derived naive Th cells, and adult PBMC-derived and in vitro expanded memory Th cells cultured in the presence or absence of P/I or CsA for 6 h. Cross-linked chromatin was subjected to immunoprecipitation using antibodies against human Ets-2 and POLII or a negative control antibody to IgG; the association of Ets-2 or POLII with the IL-2 promoter was detected by real time PCR using specific sets of primers. We examined Ets-2 binding at the ARRE-2 and the region of the core IL-2 promoter that includes the TATA box and ARRE-1 (that also contains Ets-2/NFAT binding sequences) (Fig. 6A). A chromatin region that encompasses the human β2-m gene promoter, including the TATA element, was chosen as a negative control for Ets-2 binding (Fig. 6B). The results show that in unstimula"
https://openalex.org/W2546727772,"Disorders of sexual development (DSD) encompass a broad spectrum of urogenital malformations and are amongst the most common congenital birth defects. Although key genetic factors such as the hedgehog (Hh) family have been identified, a unifying postnatally viable model displaying the spectrum of male and female urogenital malformations has not yet been reported. Since human cases are diagnosed and treated at various stages postnatally, equivalent mouse models enabling analysis at similar stages are of significant interest. Additionally, all non-Hh based genetic models investigating DSD display normal females, leaving female urogenital development largely unknown. Here, we generated compound mutant mice, Gli2+/-;Gli3Δ699/+, which exhibit a spectrum of urogenital malformations in both males and females upon birth, and also carried them well into adulthood. Analysis of embryonic day (E)18.5 and adult mice revealed shortened anogenital distance (AGD), open ventral urethral groove, incomplete fusion of scrotal sac, abnormal penile size and structure, and incomplete testicular descent with hypoplasia in male mice, whereas female mutant mice displayed reduced AGD, urinary incontinence, and a number of uterine anomalies such as vaginal duplication. Male and female fertility was also investigated via breeding cages, and it was identified that male mice were infertile while females were unable to deliver despite becoming impregnated. We propose that Gli2+/-;Gli3Δ699/+ mice can serve as a genetic mouse model for common DSD such as cryptorchidism, hypospadias, and incomplete fusion of the scrotal sac in males, and a spectrum of uterine and vaginal abnormalities along with urinary incontinence in females, which could prove essential in revealing new insights into their equivalent diseases in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2547680875,"To test the hypothesis that pleasure from artistic music is intellectual while that from popular music is physiological, this study investigated the different functional mechanisms between aesthetic appreciation of artistic and popular music using fMRI. 18 male non-musicians were scanned while they performed an aesthetic rating task for excerpts of artistic music, popular music and musical notes playing and singing (control). The rating scores of artistic and popular music excerpts were both significantly higher than that of control materials while the scores of them were not different. The fMRI results showed both artistic and popular conditions activated the VS and vmPFC, compared with control condition. When contrasted popular and artistic condition directly, we found popular music activated right putamen, while artistic music activated right mPFC. By parametric analysis, we found the activation of right putamen tracked the aesthetic ratings of popular music, whereas the BOLD signal in right mPFC tracked the aesthetic ratings of artistic music. These results indicate the reward induced by popular music is closer to a primary reward while that induced by artistic music is closer to a secondary reward. We also found artistic music activated ToM areas, including PCC/PC, arMFC and TPJ, when compared with popular music. And these areas also tracked aesthetic ratings of artistic music but not those of popular music. These results imply that the pleasure from former comes from cognitive empathy. In conclusion, this study gives clear neuronal evidences supporting the view that artistic music is of intelligence and social cognition involved while the popular music is of physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2547886119,"In heterogeneous wireless networks, wireless local area network (WLAN) is highly preferred by mobile terminals (MTs) owing to its high transmission bandwidth and low access cost. However, in high-speed environment, handover from a cellular network to a WLAN cell will lead to a high number of handover failures and unnecessary handovers due to the WLAN coverage limitation and will become worse at high speed. A new vertical handover method is proposed to minimize the probability of handover failure and unnecessary handover while maximizing the usage of WLAN in high-speed environment. The simulation results show that the proposed method kept the probability of handover failure and unnecessary handover below 0.5% and 1%, respectively. Compared with previous studies, the proposed method reduced the number of handover failures and unnecessary handovers up to 80.0% and 97.7%, respectively, while the MT is highly mobile. Using the proposed prediction method, the MT can benefit high bandwidth and low network access cost from the WLAN with minimum interruption regardless of speed."
https://openalex.org/W2548057701,"Tilletia indica causes the disease Karnal bunt in wheat. The disease is under international quarantine regulations. Comparative mitochondrial (mt) genome analysis of T. indica (KX394364 and DQ993184) and T. walkeri (EF536375) has found 325 to 328 SNPs, 57 to 60 short InDels (from 1 to 13 nt), two InDels (30 and 61 nt) and five (>200 nt) presence/absence variations (PAVs) between the two species. The mt genomes of both species have identical gene order. The numbers of SNPs and InDels between the mt genomes of the two species are approximately nine times of the corresponding numbers between the two T. indica isolates. There are eight SNPs between T. indica and T. walkeri that resulted in amino acid substitutions in the mt genes of cob, nad2 and nad5. In contrast, there is no amino acid substitution in the mt genes of the T. indica isolates from the SNPs found. The five PAVs present in T. indica (DQ993184) are absent in T. walkeri. Four PAVs are more than 1 kb and are not present in every T. indica isolate. Analysis of their presence and absence separates a collection of T. indica isolates into 11 subgroups. Two PAVs have ORFs for the LAGLIDAG endonuclease and two have ORFs for the GIY-YIG endonuclease family, which are representatives of homing endonuclease genes (HEGs). These intron- encoded HEGs confer intron mobility and account for their fluid distribution in T. indica isolates. The small PAV of 221 bp, present in every T. indica isolate and unique to the species, was used as the genetic fingerprint for the successful development of a rapid, highly sensitive and specific loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay. The simple procedure of the LAMP assay and the easy detection formats will enable the assay to be automated for high throughput diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2546830231,"For marine invertebrates with a benthic adult form and a planktonic larva phase, the connectivity among populations is mainly based on larval dispersal. While an extended larval phase will promote gene flow, other factors such as an intensive fishery and geographical barriers could lead to changes in genetic variability. In this study, the population genetic structure of the commercial crab Metacarcinus edwardsii was analyzed along 700 km of the Chilean coast. The analysis, based on eight microsatellite loci genotyped from megalopae and adult crabs, considered temporal and spatial patterns of genetic variation. The results showed no evidence of spatial patterns in genetic structure, suggesting high connectivity among the sampling sites. The temporal analysis showed no evidence of changes in allele frequencies and no evidence of a recent bottleneck. The lack of spatial structure and allele variation over time could be explained by the interaction of factors such as i) low reproductive variance due to the capability of females to store sperm in the seminal receptacle, which can be used for successive broods, ii) high larval dispersal and iii) high individual reproductive output. Using our data as priors, a genetic modelling approach coincided, predicting this temporal and spatial stability. The same analysis showed that a reduction in population size leads to the loss of genetic variability in populations, as well as of the genetic cohesiveness between populations, pointing out the importance management for species under exploitation, such as M. edwardsii."
https://openalex.org/W2547795814,"Accumulating evidence suggests a cardioprotective role of pacing postconditioning (PPC) maneuvers in animal models and more recently in humans. The procedure however remains to be optimized and its interaction with physiological systems remains to be further explored. The renin angiotensin system (RAS) plays a dual role in ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. The interaction between RAS and PPC induced cardiac protection is however not clearly understood. We have recently demonstrated that angiotensin (1-7) via Mas receptor played a significant role in PPC mediated cardiac protection against I/R injury.The objective of this study was to investigate the role of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-chymase-angiotensin II (Ang II)-angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1) axes of RAS in PPC mediated cardiac protection.Isolated rat hearts were subjected to I/R (control) or PPC in the presence or absence of Ang II, chymostatin (inhibitor of locally produced Ang II), ACE blocker (captopril) or AT1 antagonist (irbesartan). Hemodynamics data was computed digitally and infarct size was determined histologically using TTC staining and biochemically by measuring creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase levels.Cardiac hemodynamics were significantly (P<0.001) improved and infarct size and cardiac enzymes were significantly (P<0.001) reduced in hearts subjected to PPC relative to hearts subjected to I/R injury. Exogenous administration of Ang II did not affect I/R injury or PPC mediated protection. Nonetheless inhibition of endogenously synthesized Ang II protected against I/R induced cardiac damage yet did not block or augment the protective effects of PPC. The administration of AT1 antagonist did not alleviate I/R induced damage. Interestingly it abrogated PPC induced cardiac protection in isolated rat hearts. Finally, PPC induced protection and blockade of locally produced Ang II involved enhanced activation of ERK1/2 and Akt components of the reperfusion injury salvage kinase (RISK) pathway.This study demonstrate a novel role of endogenously produced Ang II in mediating I/R injury and highlights the significance of AT1 signaling in PPC mediated cardiac protection in isolated rodents hearts ex vivo. The interaction between Ang II-AT1 and PPC appears to involve alterations in the activation state of ERK1/2 and Akt components of the RISK pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2548167937,"dUTPases catalyze the hydrolysis of dUTP into dUMP and pyrophosphate to maintain the proper nucleotide pool for DNA metabolism. Recent evidence suggests that dUTPases may also represent a selective drug target in mycobacteria because of the crucial role of these enzymes in maintaining DNA integrity. Nucleotide-hydrolyzing enzymes typically harbor a buried ligand-binding pocket at interdomain or intersubunit clefts, facilitating proper solvent shielding for the catalyzed reaction. The mechanism by which substrate binds this hidden pocket and product is released in dUTPases is unresolved because of conflicting crystallographic and spectroscopic data. We sought to resolve this conflict by using a combination of random acceleration molecular dynamics (RAMD) methodology and structural and biochemical methods to study the dUTPase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In particular, the RAMD approach used in this study provided invaluable insights into the nucleotide dissociation process that reconciles all previous experimental observations. Specifically, our data suggest that nucleotide binding takes place as a small stretch of amino acids transiently slides away and partially uncovers the active site. The in silico data further revealed a new dUTPase conformation on the pathway to a relatively open active site. To probe this model, we developed the Trp21 reporter and collected crystallographic, spectroscopic, and kinetic data that confirmed the interaction of Trp21 with the active site shielding C-terminal arm, suggesting that the RAMD method is effective. In summary, our computational simulations and spectroscopic results support the idea that small loop movements in dUTPase allow the shuttlingof the nucleotides between the binding pocket and the solvent."
https://openalex.org/W2548641281,"Learning is widely documented across animal taxa but studies stringently scrutinizing the causes of constitutive or operational variation of learning among populations and individuals are scarce. The ability to learn is genetically determined and subject to constitutive variation while the performance in learning depends on the immediate circumstances and is subject to operational variation. We assessed variation in learning ability and performance of plant-inhabiting predatory mites, Amblyseius swirskii, caused by population origin, rearing diet, and type of experience. Using an early learning foraging paradigm, we determined that homogeneous single prey environments did not select for reduced learning ability, as compared to natural prey-diverse environments, whereas a multi-generational pollen diet resulted in loss of learning, as compared to a diet of live prey. Associative learning produced stronger effects than non-associative learning but both types of experience produced persistent memory. Our study represents a key example of environmentally caused variation in learning ability and performance."
https://openalex.org/W2548726575,"Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), a critical member of the basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-containing Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) protein family, is a master transcription factor involved in maintaining oxygen homeostasis. In the present study, we isolated and characterized a novel bHLH-PAS family member, CgHIFα-like gene, from the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, and determined its importance during hypoxia stress. The 3020-bp CgHIFα-like cDNA encoded a protein of 888 amino acids. The predicted CgHIFα-like amino acid sequence was conserved in the N-terminal bHLH, PAS, and PAC domains (but not in the C-terminal domain) and was most closely related to the HIF family in the bHLH-PAS protein phylogenic tree. Similar to the mammalian HIF-1α, CgHIFα-like could be expressed as four mRNA isoforms containing alternative 5′-untranslated regions and different translation initiation codons. At the mRNA level, these isoforms were expressed in a tissue-specific manner and showed increased transcription to varying degrees under hypoxic conditions. Additionally, the western blot analysis demonstrated that CgHIFα-like was induced by hypoxia. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay indicated that CgHIFα-like could bind to the hypoxia responsive element (HRE), whereas dual-luciferase reporter analysis demonstrated that CgHIFα-like could transactivate the reporter gene containing the HREs. In addition to CgHIFα-like, we identified CgARNT from the C. gigas, analyzed its expression pattern, and confirmed its interaction with CgHIFα-like using a yeast two-hybrid assay. In conclusion, this is the first report on the cloning and characterization of a novel hypoxia transcription factor in mollusks, which could accumulate under hypoxia and regulate hypoxia related gene expression by binding to HRE and dimerizing with CgARNT. As only one member of HIF has been identified in invertebrates to date, our results provide new insights into the unique mechanisms of hypoxia tolerance in mollusks."
https://openalex.org/W2548205487,"Clinical familiarity plays a role in health outcomes; the relationship between emergency department (ED) volume and outcomes for atrial fibrillation and flutter (AFF) are not clear. We compared ED presentation outcomes for AFF between high (HV) and low volume (LV) EDs in Alberta, Canada.45,372 AFF presentations for patients aged ≥ 35 years from all 104 EDs in Alberta during 1999 to 2011 using administrative health databases formed a retrospective cohort. EDs were grouped by annual AFF volume: 11 high (>100 presentations) or 93 low (≤100 presentations). Outcomes included hospital admission rate, return to ED for AFF within 30 and 90 days, and death within 30 and 90 days. Analyses included statistical tests and mixed effects modeling.Mean age at ED presentation was 69.8 years (52% male). HV ED presentations were associated with lower admissions (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64, 0.72; p-value [p]<0.001), ED returns at 90 (aOR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.73, 0.90; p<0.001) days, and a higher likelihood of specialist visits at 30 (aOR = 1.81, 95% CI 1.68, 1.94; p<0.001) and 90 (aOR = 1.82, 95% CI 1.76, 2.03; p<0.001) days. For admitted patients, there were fewer returns to HV EDs at 30 (aOR = 0.37, 95% CI 0.15, 0.87; p = 0.02) and 90 (aOR = 0.48, 95% CI 0.26, 0.89; p = 0.02) days after hospital discharge. There was no difference in death between the two groups.AFF patients presenting to HV EDs experienced fewer admissions and AFF ED revisit and higher specialist referrals compared to LV EDs."
https://openalex.org/W2546427024,"It has recently been found that B cell activating factor (BAFF) plays an important role in the regulation of energy homeostasis. We also have previously reported that BAFF deficiency reverses high-fat (HF) diet-induced glucose intolerance by potentiating adipose tissue function. In the present study, we found that BAFF deficient (BAFF-/-) mice exhibit gender-specific differences in protection against diet-induced glucose intolerance, and aimed to characterize the gender-dependent molecular alterations in energy metabolism. Under HF feeding conditions, serum BAFF level of female wild-type (WT) mice was considerably higher than that of male mice. Despite increased body weight gain, both male and female BAFF-/- mice showed significantly improved glucose tolerance compared to their WT counterparts. Expressions of genes involved in glucose transport, thermogenesis and lipid oxidation were up-regulated in brown adipose tissues of both male and female BAFF-/- mice. Interestingly, the expression of thermogenic genes in subcutaneous adipose tissue was significantly enhanced in female BAFF-/- compared to WT mice, but the difference was not observed between male BAFF-/- and WT mice. The enhanced thermogenic program was confirmed by higher protein levels of UCP1 and irisin in female BAFF-/- than in WT mice. Additionally, adiponectin production in white adipose tissues and AMPK phosphorylation in subcutaneous adipose tissue were also significantly elevated in female BAFF-/- compared to WT mice, but not in male BAFF-/- mice. Our findings define a comprehensive scenario for the enhancing effect of BAFF depletion on glucose tolerance wherein the underlying mechanism is, at least in part, gender-specific, and suggest that gender difference should be considered as an important factor in the use of BAFF blockade as a therapeutic approach for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2548390672,"Growing evidence suggests that people overvalue their own objects compared to those owned by others, even when the two objects are virtually identical (i.e., ownership effect). Most researchers seem to consider self-enhancement as the underlying mechanism while neglecting the possible process of other-derogation. Here, we attempted to compare these two perspectives, adopting both implicit and neurocognitive methodologies to overcome social desirability confounds. In Study 1, we found that the ownership effect (measured by Implicit Association Test), was correlated with other-derogation but not with self-enhancement (both measured by the Go/No-Go Association Task). In Study 2, by using the event-related potentials (ERPs) technique, we showed that positive-framed other-owned objects elicited significant evaluative incongruity (i.e. indexed by late positive potentials) compared to negative-framed other-owned objects. In contrast, negative-framed self-owned objects did not evoke significant evaluative incongruity relative to positive-framed self-owned objects. Our research suggests that, in addition to the self-enhancement that has been widely demonstrated, it is also important to keep other-derogation in mind when examining the ownership effect."
https://openalex.org/W2546570901,"When it comes to nightime routines, we all have our ways to best mark the end to a hectic day. Maybe you enjoy a hot bath or you surf the Internet right up until bedtime. Whatever helps you unplug and wind down, indulging in a cup of tea or milk—or simply drinking a glass of water—is often part of the bedtime ritual. A recent study may be able to explain why. Charles Bourque and colleagues at McGill University closely monitored water intake in mice, confirming prior observations that nocturnal rodents consume more water in the hours before sleep time. Surprisingly, such behavior is not motivated by a physiological need caused by dehydration arising from changes in blood volume or composition or by increased body temperature (Gizowski et al., 2016Gizowski C. Zaelzer C. Bourque C.W. Nature. 2016; 537: 685-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). So why drink if you don’t need to? To test whether increased water intake preceding sleep had a physiological benefit, mice were denied water during this surge period. These animals experienced dehydration toward the end of the sleep cycle, suggesting that anticipatory thirst serves a homeostatic function, protecting the animal against overnight dehydration. The authors asked whether, if not motivated by “need,” it might be driven by the central clock. By combining optogenetics with electrophysiology, they reveal a functional link between clock neurons within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and osmosensory neurons located in a brain region named the organum vasculosum lamina terminalis (OVLT). How might these connections stimulate thirst before sleep? Late-night release of vasopressin, an anti-diuretic hormone, helps retain water and minimize the impact of water deprivation during sleep (Trudel and Bourque, 2010Trudel E. Bourque C.W. Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 467-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In their new paper, Bourque and co-workers find that OVLT neurons display increased firing during the anticipatory period (the 2 hours before the start of the sleep cycle), which is mediated by excitatory vasopressin neurotransmission in the SCN. Interestingly, light-induced vasopressin release from the terminals of clock neurons onto OVLT neurons is necessary and sufficient to drive the anticipatory surge in water intake (Gizowski et al., 2016Gizowski C. Zaelzer C. Bourque C.W. Nature. 2016; 537: 685-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). But how do you know when your thirst is sated? A companion paper from Zachary Knight and colleagues at the University of California, San Francisco, looks into this question (Zimmerman et al., 2016Zimmerman C.A. Lin Y.C. Leib D.E. Guo L. Huey E.L. Daly G.E. Chen Y. Knight Z.A. Nature. 2016; 537: 680-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Prior work had shown that a population of specialized neurons, which lay deep in the subfornical organ (SFO), can detect changes in blood volume and osmolarity. Importantly, activation of SFO neurons generates thirst (reviewed in Bourque, 2008Bourque C.W. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 9: 519-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Now, the Knight lab has recorded the activity of these thirst neurons in behaving animals. As anticipated, they observe that SFO neurons are very active in thirsty mice. What is more surprising is the speed—seconds even—with which these neurons respond to drinking. This is in stark contrast with the prediction that neuronal activity would decrease slowly as the mice drinks and water enters the blood circulation to restore homeostasis—as proposed by the traditional homeostatic model. We typically enjoy a drink with food, and mice do too. Food intake increases the osmolarity of the blood and therefore intensifies the need for water; however, eating stimulates thirst well before changes in tonicity occur. To investigate how thirst neurons respond to a meal, Knight and colleagues also recorded their activity while mice were feeding. Food consumption rapidly activates SFO neurons in hungry mice —explaining the prevalence of drinking during meals— whereas subsequent water intake promptly inhibits activity of the same neurons. As the activity of thirst neurons goes up and down very quickly, regulation of thirst cannot be explained solely in light of the homeostatic model. The authors then hypothesized that sensors in the oral cavity might communicate with the thirst neurons directly. Such sensors would recognize when the animal is drinking—indicating that SFO neuronal activity should go down—and also when the animal is eating—boosting neuronal activity to trigger thirst in anticipation of the fluid imbalances arising from food absorption. Indeed, this seems to be the case, as ingestion of a liquid that cannot restore homeostasis, such as hypertonic saline, also rapidly inhibits SFO neurons. As the next step, Knight and colleagues investigate the nature of the mouthsensor. Because cold drinks are typically more thirst quenching, Knight and colleagues ask whether sensing temperature is important for thirst regulation. To test this idea, they offered thirsty mice water at different temperatures while monitoring the activity of the SFO neurons. Regardless of the temperature, mice drank sufficient water to bring SFO activity back to baseline. Remarkably, cold water inhibits these neurons much more quickly than warm water. Together, these observations point to a mechanism that integrates inputs from the oral cavity during drinking and eating with the level of physiological need. This way, thirst neurons can monitor and calibrate water consumption, clarifying how thirst can be quickly quenched and why we don’t over-drink. By showing that drinking behavior is anticipatory in nature and works to prevent homeostatic imbalances that could be harmful for the organism, the studies from the Bourque and Knight labs change the way that we think about thirst. So keep having that drink of water before tucking in. And should you be tempted by a nightcap of a harder sort, bear in mind that effects of alcohol on these thirst neurons remain to be explored."
